The western branch of the Harpers―the ''Order of the Silver Moon and Harp'', headquartered in [[Berdusk]]―maintained a formal hierarchy, and orchestrated far-reaching plots many months in advance of their execution. The eastern branch―known as the ''Senior Harpers'' or ''Harpers in the Shadows'', based out of [[Shadowdale]]―preferred instead to sponsor parties of young [[adventurer]]s, wielding subtle influence rather than taking direct action. Both branches strived to achieve the same goals, and regularly shared intelligence with their comrades across the Realms. Beyond their operational differences, the collective members of the two branches each held contrasting attitudes and world-views.\n\nFor a few decades, there existed an offshoot branch of the Harpers, known as the [[Moonstars]]. This splinter sect acted separately from the two branches of the Harpers, operating in the sprawling metropolis of [[Waterdeep]], and at times undermining the efforts of true Waterdhavian Harpers.",

That's why so many Harpers are bards: to preserve a knowledge of our past.|source=[[Khelben Arunsun]]}}\nConsidering the vastly different backgrounds and cultures from which Harper members were drawn, each cell or individual agent maintained their own, unique outlook on how to best conduct Harper business. Generally speaking, they took care of how their actions affected the greater world. Senior members tended to act with caution and circumspection, while younger Harpers often believed it was upon them to personally make the world a better place. Yet all members were taught to uphold the virtues of dedication and comradery and honestly assess their own shortcomings. Harpers knew they could only earn respect not by attaining power or holding lofty titles, but by demonstrating sound judgement and acting with integrity. \n\nSome enemies of the Harpers accused them of treating their more manipulative schemes as some sort of grand game, that the people they directed were mere pieces on a [[Chess (game)|chess]] board. The Harpers demonstrated a type of altruistic arrogance, insisting that their machinations were taken for folks' own good and the overall betterment of the world.\n\nHarper agents were determined individuals. They never quit on their missions and took however long was needed to see them to completion. If an agent was slain in the field, their comrades would never forget their sacrifice and vowed to bring justice to their killer.",
            "Culture": "It was said that the secretiveness of the Harpers extended beyond the organization as a whole, trickling down to its individual members and their personal lives. While often boisterous and lighthearted in public, Harpers tended not to share genuine sentiments with others–save for occasions when they were alone with their comrades.\n\nOverall, the Harpers were one of the most tolerant factions of the Realms. They accepted people from all walks of life, even those with unsavory pasts, so long as they swore the Harper Code and did not violate its tenets.",
            "Harper Code": "{{Quote|I shall do no less.|The response given to the Harpers' watchwords.}}\nThe code of the Harpers was a series of outwardly simple statements that were in truth exceptionally difficult to maintain in earnest. They were not written down in any [[book]] or tome, but were expressed as a series of 'watchwords' used to swear in new members, an occasion known as the [[ritual of recognition]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}\n\nThe Code of the Harpers, or the Harper Code, was as follows:\n* \"Harpers work against villainy and wickedness wherever they find it—but they work ever mindful of the consequences of what they do.\"\n* \"All beings should walk free of fear, with the right to live their lives as they wish.\"\n* \"The rule of law aids peace and fosters freedom, so long as the laws are just and those who enforce them lenient and understanding.\"\n* \"No extreme is good. For freedom to flourish, all must be in balance: the powers of realms, the reaches of the cities and the wilderlands into each other, and the influence of one being over another.\"\n* \"Whatever it takes, a Harper will do. Pride never rules the deeds of a true Harper.\"\n* \"Harpers can spare themselves less freedom than those they work to protect must have—but even a Harper must be free.\"\n* \"Harpers police their own. A Harper who hears the call of personal power can no longer hear the sweet song of the harp. A Harper who seizes power, and holds it above all else, is a traitor to the harp. Traitors must die, for freedom to live.\"\n* \"Without a past, no being can appreciate what they have, and where they may be going.\"\nIn summary and practice, it meant to oppose tyranny and evil; to protect the oppressed; to maintain freedom, peace, and order; to support fair and just laws; and to prevent extremes and imbalances of power, wealth, influence, and opportunity. They should do whatever they must, no matter how mundane or boring; no matter how hard, uncomfortable, or demeaning; and no matter how risky or life-altering. They were expected to help one another without hesitation or concern for cost and to ask nothing in return for the works they did. They could freely disagree with or criticize each other, and were to police their own and punish treachery. Finally, they were to accumulate knowledge for the good of everyone and to record and preserve the past, for it was said that history provided the light with which a Harper could see the future ahead.\n\nThroughout the course of history, the code of the Harpers spread beyond its members, influencing the shaping the laws of cities across the Heartlands and [[the North]]."

Senior members who wielded significant influence―known as spymasters―who took on quests that furthered the Harpers' interests.\n\nSpecial Harpers known as handlers served as intermediaries between spymasters orchestrating events, and other members completing field work. They were more often deployed in cities and regions that were considered more perilous for an agent's safety and well-being.\n\nMost Harper agents lived some form of a double life."

        "Tactics": "{{Quote|Isn't that how the Harpers operate? They send one person to slip in and do a job where an army couldn't go. If the agent fails, they've lost only once. But if the agent succeeds...|[[Caledan Caldorien]]}}\nWhenever possible, Harpers made most of their moves outside of public view so they could not be tracked and studied and they acted \"behind the scenes\" either in places of power or at opportune moments. They analyzed power dynamics within a realm and took action when needed to prevent power imbalance or stop one faction from achieving domininance over others. These techniques were how Harpers ensured the greatest chance of success during their missions; it was on occasions when agents revealed themselves and acted openly that the group committed its greatest blunders. \n\nKnown amongst their own as \"weaponless Harpers\", some lived as spies as informants Some others acted as political manipulators and information brokers, working with commoners and merchants to spread rumors in aid of the Harpers' cause. Yet others fed intelligence to their more foolhardy comrades, focusing on deception and subterfuge over steel and spell. \n\nIn order to correct economic disparities that were prevalent across the Realms, \nthe Harpers were known to occasionally rob wealthy nobles and merchants, in order to redistribute their wealth to poorer folk. If needed, those agents took some of their ill-gotten gains for themselves, to finance future Harper operations. To further support other members, the Harpers employed a network of drop boxes, hidden caches, and safe houses, at which their agents could find communiques, supplies, or even a safe place to rest. It was believed there were at least thirty such drop-offs in the city of Waterdeep alone.\n\nIndividual Harpers agents often used the grand, boisterous [[Midsummer]] celebrations sponsored by the [[church of Tymora]] as occasions to meet with their comrades.\n\n====Communication====\n{{Quote|Information and knowledge gained is half the battle won against any foe.|Harper maxim}}\nMembers shared information with each other in myriad ways, often employing magical means of communication or employing allies as intermediaries. \n\nElder Harpers developed their own form of non-verbal cant, known as ''[[harpspeak]]''. The Harper sign language dated back to the years before the [[Era of Upheaval]], and fell into disuse during that era.\n\n[[File:Harper Symbols.png|thumb|right|300px|''Harper symbols were used to discreetly communicate messages to fellow members and allies. An additional dot added to a rune denoted it as false. This was used as a means to throw off foes familiar with the script.'']]\nThe Harpers also employed a secret, rudimentary language of [[rune]]s, each of which had a unique meaning to other Harpers. These runes were inscribed at certain locations to warn, attract, comfort, or otherwise notify other members―or anyone else that knew their meaning―about nearby dangers or local support. To mislead their foes, this system included extraneous marks that only other agents would know how to interpret and know to disregard them.\n\nThey also utilized a series of passwords and code words to facilitate secret communication. Some of the known words and phrases included:{{Cite dungeon/188/Whispered Words|4-6}}\n* ''Bad crops, as I recall'', used in the Eastern Heartlands to warn others of impending danger.\n* ''Bitter water in that well,'' a phrase used by [[Selgaunt]]an Harpers to solicit immediate privacy.\n* ''Dove'', which meant to take reconnaissance of an area.\n* ''Maskertander'', a nonsense word referring to cargo, used with \"good\" or \"bad\" to declare whether it could be utilized or should be avoided. \n* ''Rolling heads'', a term used in Cormyr and the Dales to convey the message that magic was not to be used. Conversely, ''wiser heads'' was used when agents had to prepare to defend themselves from impending magics.\n* ''Salaeriko'', the meaning of which was not entirely clear.\n* ''Sarkyn'', which identified others as Harper allies or otherwise trustworthy individuals.\n* ''Taland'', used by [[Athkatla]]n Harpers to tell others to go into hiding; also used by agents in [[Ormpur]] for agents to identify or otherwise reveal themselves.\n\nSome Harpers received magical [[tattoo]]s of the group's harp-and-moon symbol to allow themselves to be clearly identified by allies. These appeared as innocuous, mundane tattoos at first, but transformed into the Harpers' symbol when the proper [[activation word]] was spoken.",

While the protections unfortunately lasted for only a few years, the Harpers spread rumors that attracted local adventuring groups to help slay the fiends that made it out of the ruins.\n\nSome decades later, in the {{YearlinkName|916}}, Harpers worked with [[Church of Lathander|clerics of Lathander]] to slay [[Sammaster]], founder of the Cult of the Dragon. The Harpers' increasingly public actions brought them into more frequent conflict with the church of Bane and the nation of [[Thay]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|996}},<ref group=\"note\" name=\"992 DR\">''[[Power of Faerûn]]'' and ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' both state this occurred in [[992 DR]]. the Harpers founded the [[Heralds of Faerûn]] to prevent the unscrupulous from blaming others for their misdeeds. The Heralds also used their power to provide Harpers with cover identities.\n\nWhen the Harpers eradicated the [[Wearers of the Skull]] and drew the ire of the [[church of Myrkul]], the Lord of the Dead's followers dispatched [[lich]]es to seek out and assail the Harpers. The undead spellcasters were turned away and subsequently destroyed. The church then raised armies to hunt down them and the remaining Harper agents.

''[[Spellbound]]'' and ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' explicitly states Thay was responsible.",
            "Second Reformation": "After the loss of many members during the previous year, Elminster and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun decided in the {{YearlinkName|1022}}, that new recruits were needed and that the revitalized Harpers would be an \"underground army of adventurers\". Recruits who met the pair's standards took time to be found, but eventually Elminster happened upon the [[Wanderers of Espar]], a band of a dozen [[bard]]s, druids, and rangers led by [[Finder Wyvernspur]] and [[Ulzund Hawkshield]] in [[Cormyr]]. Through a series of manipulations, these adventurers were introduced to surviving Harper veterans and ended up successfully battling many of the Harpers' enemies.\n\nThe fates aided the Harpers in these efforts in the {{YearlinkName|1065}}, when they acquired significant treasure after successfully delving into the lair of the undead dragon [[Alglaudyx]], and destroyed the mighty [[dracolich]]. They used their newfound riches to make wise investments, purchasing properties and buying up businesses in cities all along the Sword Coast.\n\nThe group continued to be quietly manipulated by Elminster and Khelben, who appointed certain members as \"Master Harpers\". These Harpers received directions from the duo, via dreams bestowed on them by Mystra, that led them to a cache of ''[[Harper pin]]s'' in [[Gochall's Tomb]]. Elminster then traveled across the Realms with two of Mystra's children, the sisters [[Dove Falconhand|Dove]] and Storm Silverhand, to bolster the ranks of the Harpers. They posed as traveling minstrels, cultivated an air of mystique about the order, and attracted new members with their music.\n\nOver time, the Harpers re-established their information network but were drawn into ever more public fights with evil churches, the Cult of the Dragon, and the nation of Thay, and other malign forces. Casualties began to mount again and, to avoid a repeat of history, Khelben and Elminster had all senior Harpers go into hiding. \n\nAt some point, the legendary Harper bard Finder Wyvernspur was corrupted by his own vanity and hunger for artistic immortality. The \"Nameless Bard,\" as he was known, was put on trial before the Harpers, who found him guilty of [[Harpers#Harper Code|allowing his pride to bring harm to others]] and imprisoned him within the [[Citadel of White Exile]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1116}}, seeing the Harpers no better than cultists of Bane, the Heralds decided that they could no longer be openly associated with the Harpers and split from them.\n\nMeanwhile, junior members grew tired of the new, low-key direction the group was headed in and started getting themselves killed in foolish fights. In the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, Elminster gave them a unified direction—by pulling them into his ongoing conflict with malaugrym, horrific shapechangers native to the [[Plane of Shadow]]. The Harpers' ongoing secret war with the malevolent [[outsider]]s came to be known as the [[Harpstar Wars]].",

His ambition, therefore, was to replace the organization's leadership and reshape it to his own ends. He desired to be the power behind every throne in the North and while planning how to achieve this he happened to meet one [[Szass Tam]], a Red Wizard of Thay.\n\nThe two came to an agreement: Szass Tam would funnel Rundorl information on his rivals in Thay and Rundorl would gain prestige by sending Harpers to win victories over them. To justify this focus on Thay, a land previously neglected by the Harpers, Rundorl spread the story of \"the spell of Undeath\". According to information he'd 'discovered', the Red Wizards were developing a new spell capable of instantly turning the populations of whole cities into undead slaves with a single casting to quickly produce armies and threaten and enslave all of [[Faerûn]]. According to Rundorl, the only things stopping them were some issues in implementation—and the Harpers. The plan went perfectly, Rundorl led and sent his fellows into battle against those Red Wizards and even [[zulkir]]s whom he claimed had involvement in \"the spell of Undeath\" and both he and Tam advanced in power.\n\nEventually, though, more Harpers were dying than Thayans and Rundorl led a reluctant retreat out of Thay. His exhausted men were being assassinated and reanimated as undead, however, and Rundorl rightly suspected that Tam had betrayed him. Rundorl broke off the alliance, then appealed to another lich named [[Thavverdasz]]. He promised the Harpers' services in return for his help defeating his reanimated comrades. Thavverdasz agreed, but then dominated Rundorl's mind and read his thoughts, mockingly took for himself the name \"Harper King\" after learning of Rundorl's ambition, and made the man his undead minion. The undead Harpers were easily wrested from Tam's control but Thavverdasz betrayed his other allies, the Cult of the Dragon.\n\nIt was this situation that the surviving Harpstar veterans encountered when they returned to Faerûn in the {{YearlinkName|1222}}. The Cult of the Dragon had raised an army and sent it against Thavverdasz's Harpers while Szass Tam challenged the Harper King directly. Thavverdasz used a powerful magic item to defeat Tam, but Elminster surprised and assassinated the Harper King shortly thereafter.",
            "Third Reformation": "Grimly, Storm and Dove set about replacing their massive losses while Khelben and the remaining veterans licked their wounds.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Third Reformation\">According to ''[[Hall of Heroes]]'' and ''[[The Seven Sisters (sourcebook)|The Seven Sisters]]'', Storm helped Syluné found the Harpers in the 13{{th}} century DR. Elminster pulled strings among the [[Wychlaran]] in [[Rashemen]] to keep the Thayans busy and turned the lair of the Harper King into a deathtrap to destroy the inevitable Cult of the Dragon reinforcements. Luckily, the Harper information network remained intact and largely ignorant of the organization's recent corruption.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1230}}, the Harpers helped defend the great city of Silverymoon, when it was threatened by a rampaging hoard of orcs.\n\nIn gratitude for the Harpers help in defending the city, Storm Silverhand was granted permission to build Moongleam Tower in Everlund. It was around that time that Storm took on leadership of the Harpers' [[Harpers#Branches|eastern branch]].\n\n{{Fq|text=Over long years, the Zhentarim became the main opposition for the Harpers, corrupting merchants and minor nobles across the greater Heartlands and becoming the prime force in the Moonsea.|float=left|source=[[Asgir Lefrenn]], Underscribe of Candlekeep.{{Cite dragon/415/History Check: The Many Deaths of Manshoon|1-2}}}}\nIt was in the {{YearlinkName|1269}}, that the Harpers first received intelligence about an emerging threat in [[North Faerûn|northern Faerûn]]—the Zhentarim. Over the course of the next century, the Harpers and the Zhentarim would all but wage war on each other. Each faction seemed to gain an edge for a time, before the other struck back once again. While Khelben took over as leader of the Harpers on the Sword Coast, \n\nHowever, in the {{YearlinkName|1321}}, Khelben sponsored the Harpstar veteran [[Cylyria Dragonbreast]] in her bid to become High Lady of Berdusk, and gave over to her leadership of the western branch of the Harpers. The Harpers of Twilight Hall, as they were colloquially known, acted openly against the Zhentarim and [[Amn]]ian interests and even came close to crippling the Rundeen. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1349}}, Harper agents managed to put an end to the Rundeen's financial stranglehold over [[Chult]]. They disrupted the organization's major operations in Calimshan and killed three of their leaders.\n\nThey suffered tremendous loss a few decades later, however. In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, [[Syluné Silverhand]]―eldest of the [[Seven Sisters]]―and several Harpers were slain when a [[flight of dragons]] was called down upon Faerûn. But her [[spirit]] persisted in the mortal world as one of the group's famed [[spectral harpist]]s, and would appear when summoned to certain Harpers in times of peril.",
            "Early Era of Upheaval": "[[File:Harpers banner.png|thumb|right|130px|''The Harpers of Faerûn have lasted the test of time''.]]\n{{Quote|Tis more important that the Shadowmasters have no benefit from what I've left undone than that the Harpers or Shandril―or Toril itself―gain strength by what we do.|Elminster the Sage.}}\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the [[Avatar Crisis]] struck Faerûn when the gods above were forced to walk the Realms as mortals. Amidst the numerous conflicts and catastrophes, the Harpers fought to defend Shadowdale against the invading armies of the [[Zhentilar]], particularly in the [[Battle of Swords Creek]]. Elminster and the spectral Syluné led a band of Harpers in a series of skirmishes against the [[Shadowmaster]] and his sect of the malaugrym.\n\nOver the following decade, the Harpers engaged the Zhentarim in skirmishes across Faerûn. They fought an open war against the Zhents in the [[Sunset Vale]], and helped unite the [[Bedine]] people against Black Network agents in the oases of the [[Anauroch]] desert. A [[1361 DR|few years later]], Harper agents were systematically tracked down and slain by an individual known as the \"Harper Assassin\". In time, the Harpers discovered the deaths were the work of a [[Kymil Nimesin|disgruntled sun elf]] who had been working in league with the Zhentarim. Conflicts between the two groups broke out in cities across the Heartlands, from [[Iriaebor]] to [[Hluthvar]] and even [[Baldur's Gate]].\n\nWhile the Harpers remained engaged in conflict with nefarious groups, it was observed by some they had been failing in their role as lore-keepers for quite some time. In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the disgruntled former Harper [[Iriador Wintermist]]―who subscribed to this belief―used a [[Morninglark|powerful magical instrument]] to curse the Harpers, altering the tales they told and ballads they sang. She focused her vengeance against the city of Waterdeep and its archmage, Khelben Arunsun. Fortunately for the storytellers and balladeers of Faerûn, her plot was foiled by Khelben and his Harper apprentice [[Danilo Thann]]. As misguided as it was, Iriador's message was received in earnest by the people of Waterdeep. Soon after these events they refounded the bardic college of [[New Olamn]] in the City of Splendors.\n\nThat same year the Harpers were forced to face off with the Cult of the Dragon yet again, in a series of engagements that culminated in a massive battle in the city of Elversult. They struck out against the cult a few years later, working to prevent the cult from establishing [[Alasklerbanbastos|a dracolich]] as the monarch of the politically unstable nation of [[Chessenta]]. \n\nWith the downfall of Bane and the rise of [[Cyricism]]―and its subsequent entanglement with the Zhentarim―new foes developed evil plots to which the Harpers could not ignore. Harper agents acted against the followers of the Dark Sun as they sought after murderous artifacts on the Sword Coast, and chased down [[Malik el Sami|Cyric's chosen]] in order to bring him to justice.{{Cite dragon/245/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of the Trial of Cyric the Mad|65-68}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Harpers were able to put an end to a major threat that imperiled much of the North. Their members utilized powerful magic to destroy Hellgate Keep, and send back to the Hells nearly all the [[baatezu]] that remained within.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Hellgate Keep\">While the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'' states this occurred in [[1368 DR]], ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]'', ''[[Silver Marches (sourcebook)|Silver Marches]]'', the blurb for the [[Hellgate Keep (adventure)|Hellgate Keep adventure]], and ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' all state this occurred in [[1369 DR]].",

In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, investigators discovered evidence that implicated Khelben in the theft of an [[artifact]], the ''[[Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings]]'', which had then found its way into the hands of the Zhentarim. Khelben admitted to all of the charges set against him. Khelben and Laeral both left the Harpers,<ref name=SCAG-p123-124> along with Alustriel, who felt she could not uphold her commitment to the group, as High Lady of the [[Silver Marches]]. and many of Khelben's closest friends and allies, founding their own group: the Moonstars.<ref name=SCAG-p123-124 />\n\nThe government of Waterdeep refused to help the Harpers of Twilight Hall prosecute Khelben, so the Harpers proceeded to ward their stores against Khelben and Laeral, while Khelben erected a ward that prevented any Harper from approaching [[Blackstaff Tower]]. Influenced by [[Bran Skorlsun]], the Harpers of Twilight Hall went on a witch hunt to purge their ranks of perceived traitors while Storm's eastern branch tried to carry on with their business regardless of events in the west.\n\nWhen the church of Bane reformed with the Zhentarim—following the wane of Cyricism and the [[return of Bane]] to godhood―the Harpers were once again targeted by agents of their longtime foes. \n\nThe Harpers were overwhelmed as a whole during the [[Wailing Years]], a series of disasters that followed the [[Spellplague]] that wracked the Realms in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. Many Harpers died while others vanished. Those who survived were cut off from one another, so they focused solely on the perils that menaced their homes and neighbors. While the original organization was divided and its members scattered across the continent, the hope of returning the Harpers to their former glory didn't die.",
            "Fourth Reformation": "{{Quote|Yet I very much doubt it will surprise any of you to learn that the Harpers did not, in fact, cease to exist. An extremely secretive, underground fellowship of some two dozen Harpers continued―as they do to this very day.|[[Oskrul Meddanthyr]], [[1479 DR]].}}\nOne bastion of Harper strength remained, however: Moongleam Tower. As of the {{YearlinkName|1419}}, [[Eaerlraun Shadowlyn]] re-founded the group as the \"Harpers of Luruar\" to secretly counter the forces of returned [[Netheril]], hoping to keep the Harper ideals alive. Following their example, other Harper cells formed throughout the Realms. Some of these groups were collectives that adopted the Harpers' name and traditional ideology, while others comprised former Harpers that had survived the collapse and had gone underground before returning to action.<ref name=DU188-p55>{{Cite dungeon/188/Whispered Words|55}} Notable among the latter were the \"Harpers of Waterdeep\" and Storm Silverhand's \"Harpers of Cormyr and the Dales\", which many felt were the spiritual successors of the original organization.\n\nSeveral other groups who called themselves Harpers appeared in the following years. The \"Harpers of [[Athkatla]]\" worked against the [[Council of Five]] and other Amnian authorities, but although they claimed to share the ideals of the Harpers of old, they did not and merely claimed to in order to gain support. The \"Harpers of Selgaunt\" and the \"Harpers of Ormpur\" were also rebels who did not really cleave to Harper ideals.<ref name=DU188-p55/> These new Harpers brought with them enemies of their own, such as the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], Szass Tam's Thay, the Zhentarim, and the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]].\n\nAt some point, Harpers seem to have acquired or stolen{{speculation}} the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' that had been used by Szass Tam to turn much of the population of Thay into undead servants some years beforeFrom ''Honor Among Thieves'', it is unknown how the horn managed to pass from Szass Tam's possession and into the Harpers', and when this occurred. Most likely, they stole it to prevent him using it again. While speculative, the event is included here for context.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1475}}, the \"Harpers of Luruar\" had managed to cripple the efforts of the Netherese in significant ways. \n\nWithin [[1479 DR|four years]], the Harpers of Waterdeep were led by a Harper agent known as [[Aron Vishter|Aron \"the Fisher\" Vishter]], who was actually a double agent working for the Zhentarim to undermine Harper operations. Although [[Tam Zawad]] and other Harpers were able to bring the Fisher to justice, he did great damage to the Harpers of Waterdeep. Even after [[1486 DR|seven years]], Zawad was still dealing with corrupt Harpers within his Harper cell.\n\nThe Harpers of Neverwinter also suffered a devastating blow that same year. The group's leader [[Cymril]] was in the middle of aiding the [[Sons of Alagondar]] openly oppose the rule of [[Dagult Neverember]]. Cymril was slain when her group was ambushed by [[Mintarn Mercenaries]]. After the attack, it was revealed that she was also working for Neverember. After her treachery was revealed, the reputation of the Harpers of Neverwinter significantly tarnished for some time.\n\nIn the time of [[Mystra's Return]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Storm Silverhand began to revitalize the Harper organization in Cormyr. She sought out people from all walks of life: smiths, merchants, leather workers, and even those who worked in brothels. Her revitalizing actions were known and tolerated by the [[War Wizards]] of Cormyr. The Harpers prevented the assassination of King's Lord [[Lothan Durncaskyn]] who was sheltering [[Mirt]]'s lady, [[Rensharra Ironstave]]. Since then, the Harpers became an active organization across the Realms again.<ref>{{Cite web/Factions: The Harpers}}",
            "Second Sundering Era": "In the years following the [[Second Sundering]]—which occurred over the course of the 1480s DR―the Harpers bolstered their numbers, recovered their resources, and once again embarked upon secret missions to better the Realms. The network of spies and adventurers held no leadership as before, but remained scattered across the breadth of Faerûn. They focused their efforts on their long-standing mission to oppose tyrants and other purveyors of injustice.\n\nThe Harpers in the Moonsea region began investigating a series of raids and kidnappings in Hillsfar and the surrounding farmlands.{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|8}} They successfully helped foment rebellion in the city, to overthrow its cunning First Lord, [[Torin Nomerthal]].{{Cite adventurers league/Death on the Wall|26}} Meanwhile, in Hillsfar, they became aware of strange happenings in the Underdark.{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|8}} They helped forge an alliance between the people of Hillsfar and the drow of [[Szith Morcane]] to meet the emergent danger of [[Graz'zt]] and other prominent [[demon lord]]s, all appearing on Toril at once.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|80}}\n\nYet other agents began looking into rumors circulating about a new iteration of the old Cult of the Dragon.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|68}} Rather than worshiping dracoliches, the new dragon cult devoted itself to [[Tiamat]], the evil Queen of Dragons. When the cultists attempted to bring their goddess to the [[Material Plane]], in the 1480s DR, the Harpers were among the many factions who rose up to oppose Tiamat's attempt at freedom. Their agents tracked cultist activity across the Sword Coast, gathered leaders of the free cities in the [[Council of Waterdeep]],\n\nDuring their involvement with the Dragon Cult's schemes, the Harpers began to keep a closer eye on its strongest allies: the Red Wizards of Thay. The Red Wizards had made strong inroads into the North and the Sword Coast during their alliance with the Cult. On one mission in the mid–1480s DR,{{HAT-time}} a trio of Harpers captured a Red Wizard in his treasure-stuffed lair. Among them was the recent recruit [[Edgin Darvis]], who stole a [[gold]] token, little thinking it might be magically marked. By tracing that gold, four Red Wizards rode into [[Targos]] seeking revenge and murdered Edgin's wife [[Zia]]. Afterward, Edgin blamed himself, abandoned his oath to the Harpers, and burned his [[book]] of the Harper Code upon Zia's funeral pyre.\n\nSome years later, the cults of [[Elemental Evil]] arose in the [[Dessarin Valley]] and the [[Moonsea]], and were a threat to the people in and around those lands. The Harpers were among the factions of the west that acted against the cults, working against the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] in Mulmaster and their activities in nearby mines.{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|12}}\n\nWhen the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] of [[giant]]-kind was abolished in the latter half of the 1480s DR and giants of all kinds ran amok in the North, the Harpers went on alert to protect the towns and cities they called home.\n\nSome years later, the [[death curse]] struck the Realms, and [[divine magic]] could no longer bring back the [[soul]]s of the recently deceased and restore their bodies to life. Around that time, the Harpers of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in Chult worked alongside the [[Ytepka Society]] to uncover a hidden foe within their city.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|3}} Working with other groups, they established a base of operations in the jungles of Chult and began to investigate a possible source of the curse.{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|26}}{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|3}} They finally determined the curse originated from an unholy and otherworldly artifact known as the ''[[Soulmonger]]'', hidden deep within the jungles of Chult.\n\nThey once again took actions against the ever-meddling Red Wizards of Thay, who had uncovered an [[Xorvintroth|ancient Abeiran city]] that was infused with the dark energies of the [[Far Realm]].

They triggered an alarm and fought with Harper guards, but Sofina betrayed the thieves and escaped with her prize—Szass Tam's ''horn of beckoning death''. Edgin and Holga were left at the scene of the crime and captured by the Harpers, convicted of crimes of skullduggery and grand larceny by the justice of the Lords' Alliance, and incarcerated in the [[Revel's End]] prison. Two years later, Sofina would be revealed as a Red Wizard of Thay and servant of Szass Tam, and used the ''horn of beckoning death'' in an attempt to transform Neverwinter's population into undead servants of Szass Tam, but was thankfully foiled by Edgin and his thieves."
