The Holy Ones were a group of religious scholars in the city of Yeshpek, in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
This group operated as part of the larger staff of Drestin, When not working inside the palace, they administered Yeshpeks local shrines to the goddesses Umberlee and Waukeen.
The Holy Ones were entirely composed of rather haughty individuals who had, prior to Waukeens disappearance, been high-ranking priests in the Church of Waukeen.
