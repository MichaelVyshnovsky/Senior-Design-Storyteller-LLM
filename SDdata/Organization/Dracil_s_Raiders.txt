'''Dracil's Raiders''' was an adventuring group inhabiting the [[Forest of Amtar]] in [[Dambrath]] around [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Though small with only ten members, this group was composed entirely of wicked individuals who enjoyed accosting small caravans that traveled the roads located to the east of the forest. Their leader was a [[dwarf]] named [[Dracil]].

==Tactics==
This bandit group chose their targets carefully, avoiding large and/or well-defended caravans. They preferred to extort goods and money out of smaller and weaker groups that they could surprise or intimidate without a fight.

==Base of Operations==
Dracil's Raiders camped on the eastern edge of the Amtar forest and threatened smaller trade caravans.

==Possessions==
The group possessed a variety of magical items that aided them during their raids and made them formidable opponents. At least half the band wore ''[[boots of elvenkind]]''.

==History==
The group was mostly disbanded or dead by the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|60}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 49: The Road to Kh√¥ltar, Part 2}}

==Members==
In addition to their leader, Dracil, the band had a [[priest]] and two [[mage]]s among their number.
