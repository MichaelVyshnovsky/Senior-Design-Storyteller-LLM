        "mainbody": "he High Moor Heroes Guild was a guild of adventurers based in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands around 1358 DR.\nThe closest thing to a rogues guild permitted by the High Rider, Lord Dhelt, it was a legal outlet for the poor, desperate, unruly, maladjusted, or just violent people of the city.\nThis adventuring band made regular expeditions onto the High Moor, \"scouring\" whatever they found. Guild members also tutored each other and other adventurers for a fee, with a discount for members."
