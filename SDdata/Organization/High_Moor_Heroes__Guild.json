        "mainbody": "The '''High Moor Heroes' Guild''' was a guild of adventurers based in the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] around [[1358 DR]].\n\nThe closest thing to a rogue's guild permitted by the High Rider, Lord [[Dhelt]], it was a legal outlet for the poor, desperate, unruly, maladjusted, or just violent people of the city.\n\nThis adventuring band made regular expeditions onto the [[High Moor]], \"scouring\" whatever they found. Guild members also tutored each other and other adventurers for a fee, with a discount for members."
