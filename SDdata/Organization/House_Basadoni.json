        "mainbody": "'''House Basadoni''', also known as the '''Basadoni Cabal''' and the '''Basadoni Guild''', was one of the more powerful [[thieves' guild]]s of [[Calimport]] in [[Calimshan]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "It was led for many years by its namesake, Pasha [[Basadoni]].\n\nThe Basadoni Cabal took in a young [[Artemis Entreri]] as a member. He rose to the rank of lieutenant in the guild before leaving to work for Pasha [[Pook]].\n\nWhen Enteri returned to Calimport in the {{yearlinkName|1364}}, Pasha Basadoni invited him to join again, but Entreri refused. Soon after, some high-ranking members of House Basadoni tried to kill Entreri to maintain the guild's prestige, but Entreri killed them all&mdash;at the price of involving [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. At last Entreri and the [[drow]] assaulted Basadoni's palace and confronted the pasha. Basadoni acknowledged the power of the drow and offered instead an alliance with them with himself as figurehead leader and Jarlaxle commanding from shadows. Entreri seemingly accepted the pact but then killed Basadoni in cold blood, claiming the leadership of House Basadoni for himself.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, House Basadoni became the front for Jarlaxle's attempts to widen his band of rogue drow's influence to the surface world. Artemis served as the figurehead of the house during the ruse. However, Jarlaxle increasingly fell under the influence of ''[[Crenshinibon]]'' until his two lieutenants, [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] and [[Rai-guy]], enacted a plot to overthrow him. He was only rescued from his own follies by Entreri, who claimed to need Jarlaxle alive to protect him from the two drow lieutenants. Jarlaxle made an agreement with Kimmuriel for co-leadership of Bregan D'aerthe while he and Artemis went traveling around the surface. This coup within Bregan Daerthe left House Basadoni in turmoil."
