        "mainbody": "House Basadoni, also known as the Basadoni Cabal and the Basadoni Guild, was one of the more powerful thieves guilds of Calimport in Calimshan in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nIt was led for many years by its namesake, Pasha Basadoni.\nThe Basadoni Cabal took in a young Artemis Entreri as a member. He rose to the rank of lieutenant in the guild before leaving to work for Pasha Pook.\nWhen Enteri returned to Calimport in the , Pasha Basadoni invited him to join again, but Entreri refused. Soon after, some high-ranking members of House Basadoni tried to kill Entreri to maintain the guilds prestige, but Entreri killed them all&mdashat the price of involving Jarlaxle and Bregan Daerthe. At last Entreri and the drow assaulted Basadonis palace and confronted the pasha. Basadoni acknowledged the power of the drow and offered instead an alliance with them with himself as figurehead leader and Jarlaxle commanding from shadows. Entreri seemingly accepted the pact but then killed Basadoni in cold blood, claiming the leadership of House Basadoni for himself.\nIn the , House Basadoni became the front for Jarlaxles attempts to widen his band of rogue drows influence to the surface world. Artemis served as the figurehead of the house during the ruse. However, Jarlaxle increasingly fell under the influence of Crenshinibon until his two lieutenants, Kimmuriel Oblodra and Rai-guy, enacted a plot to overthrow him. He was only rescued from his own follies by Entreri, who claimed to need Jarlaxle alive to protect him from the two drow lieutenants. Jarlaxle made an agreement with Kimmuriel for co-leadership of Bregan Daerthe while he and Artemis went traveling around the surface. This coup within Bregan Daerthe left House Basadoni in turmoil."
