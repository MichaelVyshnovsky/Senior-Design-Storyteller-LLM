They solely focused on moving goods along the route that linked the metropolis of Waterdeep with the nation of Sembia. Their prices were competitive with other trading companies.
The group kept their headquarters in the city of Daerlun.
Firehands caravans were regularly sabotaged by agents of the Iron Throne.
