        "mainbody": "Eilistraees Wanderers were a group of drow that worked to aid the rebuilding of Myth Drannor in 1374 DR. They were closely aligned with the Elves of Cormanthor led by Tannivh Dahast, which had similar goals.\nThe group was formed when Kelgoth Darksong found an ancient chronicle describing the raising of the citys mythal in 261 DR, and realized that it also described the key to the mythal. With this knowledge, the damaged mythal could be repaired and controlled, and provide a powerful first step in the recovery of the city. Kelgoth assembled his friends and allies and set off to Myth Drannor, joining the Cormanthor Elves at their camp in the outskirts of the ruins. Unfortunately, the Elves were already hard-pressed by the many threats in the area and were not able or willing to strike into the city to pursue what seemed like rumors. Unwilling to wait, Kelgoth, Zeliira, and Uhlsdrin set off on their own missions, but were each overcome or blocked by the threats lurking within the city.\nThe Wanderers were made up of various drow who agreed with Kelgoths plan, including some from as far away as Imberlur. Their members included\n* Kelgoth Darksong, their leader.\n* Irrwyss Frettar\n* Izzinid Claddafin\n* Greyarra Auvryath\n* Uhlsdrin Nirveth \n* Durfryn Alearn\n* Chessae Baenrahel\n* Zeliira"
