The Doom Raiders were an adventuring party that specialized in cleaning out the lairs of liches (known as "dooms") during the late 15 century DR. They eventually joined the reformed Zhentarim in the late 1480s.
In 1489 DR, the Doom Raiders were sent to establish a Zhent foothold in Waterdeep.
In 1492 DR, Davil Starsong and other Zhents were captured by the City Watch, following the Gralhund Villa Bloodbath.
