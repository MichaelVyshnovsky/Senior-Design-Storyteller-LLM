The Smiths Guild was a craftsman guild in Cormyr that served the needs of blacksmiths and members of similar professions, active around 1367 DR.
They were a benevolent fraternity of folk who practiced the same trade, who joined for the camaraderie and to share knowledge and advance their skills.
Like other Cormyrean craftsman guilds, it was intended to take care of its members, improve working conditions, try to guarantee supplies, provide business opportunities, and oppose taxes. However, they were not especially influential in the kingdom.
The symbol of the smiths guild was a certain sigil. Members would wear this as a badge with a feather on an article of clothing such as a hat.
