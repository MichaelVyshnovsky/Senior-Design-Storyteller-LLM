        "mainbody": "The Society of Stalwart Adventurers was an exclusive club in Suzail, Cormyr, founded to bring together renowned world travelers and adventurers.\nTo be invited to join, a prospective member must have achieved some noteworthy feat and have it recognized by the societys committee. However, over the course of its thousand-year history, the society was infiltrated by wealthy individuals of Cormyr. Despite providing financial support for the expeditions of the legitimate members, these individuals, referred to by Artus Cimber as \"Warts\" rather than Stalwarts, diminished the prestige of the society.\nThe Society of Stalwart Adventurers was founded around the 2 century DR by Dhalmass Rayburton and four other members. However, Dhalmas later confessed to Artus Cimber that hed just allowed the use of his name to the original founders of the society.\n* Dhalmass Rayburton, a member of House Rayburton, and member of the barae of Mezro in Chult.\n* Artus Cimber, the famous Cormyrean adventurer who for decades carried the burden of bearing the legendary Ring of Winter.\n* Hydel Pontifax, a devoted follower of Mystra and a companion of Artus Cimber.\n* Theron Silvermace, a Harper and a member of the Silvermace noble family of Cormyr.\n* Philyra, a druid and an accomplished adventurer.\n* Lady Elynna, the president of the society as of 1362 DR, who had a pet leopard.\n* Uther, the butler of the society in the 1360s, who looked like an Abyssal denizen because of a spell cast by Danilo Thann"
