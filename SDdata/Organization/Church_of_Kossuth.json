        "mainbody": "The Church of Kossuth () was the organization of Kossuthan priests in Faer√ªn.\nThe Church was divided into a strict hierarchy. At the very top were the Eternal Flames of Kossuth. Each Eternal Flame was the leader of a single temple and was over three Most Fervid Fires. Below each Most Fervid Fire were two Numinous Blazes. The priestly ranks below this were, from highest to lowest\n* Inspired Forge\n* Flamebrother/Flamesister\n* Fury of the Faith\n* Pillar of Flame\n* Zealous Pyre\n* Devoted Blaze\n* Righteous Flame\n* Torch of the Faith\nEach temple had exactly six Inspired Forges, Flamebrothers or Flamesisters, Furies of the Faith, Pillars of Flame, and Zealous Pyres and many of the lower ranking priests. One could only achieve a rank higher than Devoted Blaze through recommendation of two higher-ranking priests, and only if their was an opening in the ranks. Collectively, these priests were called the Promised.\nthumb|right|508x508px|A priest of Kossuth.\nThose acolytes who had not yet taken the Oath of Firewalking were known as the Lightless. In addition, there were specialty priests of Kossuth known as firewalkers, and monks in Kossuths service were called Faithful Flames.\nThe church was well-protected by the militant knights of the Order of the Fire Drake.\nThey often utilized assassins from the Order of the Black Flame to strike at those considered to be enemies of Kossuth.\nPrior to the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the preeminent temple to Kossuth was the Burning House of Kossuth in Thay. However, that temple burned down sometime shortly before , at which point the Flaming Brazier became the most important temple.\nFollowing the Spellplague, while Gond was in a weakened state and the nation of Lantan was in another world, the Kossuthan clergy tried to spread a claim that gunpowders inert state on Toril was the doing of their god."
