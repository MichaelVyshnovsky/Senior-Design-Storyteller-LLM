        "mainbody": "The Mercenaries Guild of Westgate was a mercenary recruitment organization based in Westgate around 1358 DR.\nThe Guild was proud to recruit only from the best merchant families of Westgate.\nUsually, the Guild used cavalry attacks, despite their recruits sometimes being too untrained to use them efficiently.\nThe Guild charged 250 gold pieces per week for services of 100 men, with more money needed if the employers wanted something more. With the presence of Palla in the field, they needed to pay double.\nThe Guild operated exclusively in the Western Heartlands. They defeated pirates in the Sea of Fallen Stars, orcs in the Hullack Forest, and fought together with the Dalefolk against Lashan Aumersair."
