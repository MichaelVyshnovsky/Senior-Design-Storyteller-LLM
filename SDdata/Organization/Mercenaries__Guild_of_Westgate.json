        "mainbody": "The '''Mercenaries' Guild of Westgate''' was a mercenary recruitment organization based in [[Westgate]] around [[1358 DR]].",
        "Membership": "The Guild was proud to recruit only from the best merchant families of Westgate.",
        "Tactics": "Usually, the Guild used cavalry attacks, despite their recruits sometimes being too untrained to use them efficiently.",
        "Contracts": "The Guild charged 250 [[gold piece]]s per week for services of 100 men, with more money needed if the employers wanted something more. With the presence of [[Palla]] in the field, they needed to pay double.",
