        "mainbody": "rolgyets Legion was a large and diverse but well-disciplined army of goblinoids and giantkin amassed by the hobgoblin warlord Mrolgyet in the late 15 century DR. They operated out of the ruined Chaunteas Citadel on Harvestshield Mountain, and aspired to invade all the lands of the Lords Alliance.\nThe Legion believed that by claiming Harvestshield Mountain, they would be well-situated to strike at any member of the Lords Allaince. They thus focused on securing that location and on building up their forces.\nThe Legions strategy was to send out a chaotic first wave&mdashconsisting mostly of reckless, undisciplined, and voracious gnolls&mdashto clear an area, which was followed by a more disciplined line&mdashled by bugbear troops&mdashwho quietly secured the perimeter and held the line. They put their weaker forces out front, and claimed that their army only grew stronger as this cannon fodder was slain.\nWhen Mrolgyet and his Legion arrived on Harvestshield Mountain in the late 15 century DR, they claimed Chaunteas Citadel and focused on reinforcing and fortifying it. At the same time, Mrolgyet subjugated local tribes of giantkin, and sent them on a mission to Frostsilver Mines to retrieve dwarven Frostsilver armor as well as the famed Anvil of Dumathoin for the Legion. At first their plans proceeded without any interference from nearby Waterdeep as the city had been blinded to their activity by the subtle treachery of the Lightfinger family, but they were discovered when a group of adventurers intercepted their efforts in Frostsilver Mines.\nJust as Mrolgyets armies were ready to march, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand, sent a team of adventurers backed by an army to defeat them. The adventurers took advantage of the light patrols in the woods on the south side of the mountain to approach Chaunteas Citadel while Mrolgyets advance forces were slowed by clashes with local packs of ghouls that roved the blighted parts of the mountain. As the battle started, the Legions tactics fell apart when the adventurers slew the leaders of the their gnoll and bugbear forces, forcing the Legion to spread out its troops.\nThe adventurers then left the front lines to try and recruit powerful allies in the form of the Harvestshield Reapers, but while they succeeded in unleashing these flesh golems on the Legion, they were unable to gain control over them as allies.\nAs the Legion was pushed closer and closer to the Citadel, the adventurers managed to infiltrate the fortress and battle through the Legions forces to find Mrolgyet himself. Their actions soon prompted him to confront them personally, but he was defeated and had to withdraw. Unfortunately, this did not seem to shake the Legion, and it seemed that slaying Mrolgyet would simply prompt them to appoint a new commander and continue as usual. Sure enough, the injured Mrolgyet sent a \"champion\" to represent him on the battlefield a helmed horror wearing special armor seized from the Frostsilver Mine. The adventurers defeated his champion, and then turned their attention to sealing the tunnel that connected the Citadel to the Mines. This was complicated, however, by the surprise appearance of stone giant refugees from the Heartcoil Deeps, who opposed the efforts to close the the tunnel.\nAs the battle continued, the tide finally turned against the Legion. However, it was at that moment that Argathakul, a red dragon who laired nearby, appeared in the skies above the Citadel to assert his claim over Harvestshield Mountain. Fearing the damage that the dragon might cause, the adventurers defeated him and drove him away. In the aftermath, the Legion scattered and fled down into the Heartcoil Deeps, however they did not abandon their aspirations to claim Harvestshield Mountain despite knowing that this would once again anger Argathakul.\nIn addition to hobgoblins, the Legion included forces from the Burntbone Horde, including goblins, kobolds, ogres, and orcs. Additionally, a number of other groups were recruited as allies to fulfill specialized roles&mdashsuch as Hnalguks fast-moving gnoll scouts or Ganarks disciplined bugbear sentries&mdashor were subjugated and forced to serve the Legion&mdashsuch as Grocknocks ettins and Snarlclaws trolls. They also offered large bribes to recruit chimeras, such as Haelphar. They further made attempts to tame local owlbears as shock troops, and were known to make use of rust monsters.\nMembers of the Legion were branded with Mrolgyets symbol."
