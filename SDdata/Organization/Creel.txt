The '''Creel''' were one of the smallest tribes of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] found in  [[Narfell]]. There were 750 Creel in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Because of their humiliating defeat at the hands of the [[undead]] forces under the command of [[Zhengyi]], the Creel were notoriously violent toward anyone found on their land, including other tribes of Nar.

==Base of Operations==
The Creel inhabited the lands in northwestern Narfell along the shores of [[Icelace Lake]].
