'''Clan Battlehammer''' was a clan of [[Shield dwarf|shield dwarves]] based in [[Mithral Hall]] in [[the North]]. They were ruled by a king of Battlehammer blood, until the bloodline was lost with the apparent death of [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] and [[Banak Brawnanvil]] became king.

==History==
{{main|Mithral Hall}}
===Mithral Hall===
The original residence of the clan was Mithral Hall, where [[Gandalug Battlehammer]] reigned as the First King. However, it was his third son, [[Bruenor Battlehammer I]], who led the thousand dwarves of the clan to Mithral Hall and commenced work on building the Undercity. Gandalug chose him as his successor, the second king. The hall was an underground town and mine, as the mountain was rich in [[mithral]] ore.

Mithral Hall was abandoned in the 1100s DR when the [[shadow dragon]] [[Shimmergloom]] and hordes of [[duergar]] claimed the settlement for themselves after the dwarves in Mithral Hall dug too deep in search for mithral and disturbed the dragon. Only a small number of the clan escaped, including young Bruenor.

===Icewind Dale===
The survivors of Mithral Hall migrated away, the majority ultimately settling in a valley in front of [[Kelvin's Cairn]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. They created a new home for themselves in the dale, where they remained for two centuries. They traded dwarven-made equipment to the [[Ten Towns]].

===Return to Mithral Hall===
In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Bruenor Battlehammer returned to Mithral Hall.

In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, Bruenor abdicated his throne to Gandalug, the founder of Mithral Hall who had returned from the dead, making him both First and Ninth King of Mithral Hall. Bruenor took a few hundred of his dwarves back to Icewind Dale, but when Gandalug died, he returned in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, to rule as the Tenth King of Mithral Hall.

However, a few dwarves remained in the mines in Icewind Dale. ''Circa'' [[1483 DR]], they were led by [[Stokely Silverstream]].
