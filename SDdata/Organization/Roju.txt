The '''roju''' was the Council of Elders of [[Wa]], one of the three primary offices of the shogunate.

==Organization==
Members of the roju were selected from among the [[fudai daimyo]], the so-called "house daimyo" who were most loyal to the shogun, and approved by him. This was a very honored role in Wa society, and to hold the position, one must have owned property equivalent to at leaat 25,000 [[koku]] of [[rice]].

The leader of the roju held the title of kahan.

==Activities==
The primary role of the roju was to supervise the lesser daimyo. They also performed other administrative tasks, such as the regulation of official currency, overseeing internal government affairs within [[Uwaji Province]], administration of government shrines and temples, and the commissioning of official maps.

The kahan had the additional role of stamping the shogun's official seal upon all government documents.
