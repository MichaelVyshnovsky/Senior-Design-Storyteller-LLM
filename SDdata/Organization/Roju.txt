The roju was the Council of Elders of Wa, one of the three primary offices of the shogunate.
Members of the roju were selected from among the fudai daimyo, the so-called "house daimyo" who were most loyal to the shogun, and approved by him. This was a very honored role in Wa society, and to hold the position, one must have owned property equivalent to at leaat 25,000 koku of rice.
The leader of the roju held the title of kahan.
The primary role of the roju was to supervise the lesser daimyo. They also performed other administrative tasks, such as the regulation of official currency, overseeing internal government affairs within Uwaji Province, administration of government shrines and temples, and the commissioning of official maps.
The kahan had the additional role of stamping the shoguns official seal upon all government documents.
