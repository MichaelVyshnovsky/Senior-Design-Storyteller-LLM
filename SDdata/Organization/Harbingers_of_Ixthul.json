Much of what occured between that time and the orders shift into a cult was lost to time, as few of their writings or records survived, but at some point a major change occured. Deymoden changed their name to Ixthul and began striving to become a deity of demigod or exarch status.\nThe other paladins, dedicated to Ixthuls cause, followed their lead in creating a divine artifact of war Before the Harbingers of Ixthul had a chance to use their divine artifact of war, they were struck by internal betrayal and quickly fell apart."
