The '''Durthans''' were a secretive group of women who operated in [[Rashemen]].

==Activities==
They called upon the darker spirits of the country. They were the antithesis of the [[Witches of Rashemen]] and worked against them for the rulership of the realm.

They wore masks like the [[hathran]]s to disguise their identities and pretended that they were of the same order.

They used dark magic and were very seductive.

In the {{YearlinkName|595}}, the durthans attempted to overthrow the order and seize Rashemen. Strife between the hathrans and their dark sisters lasted for decades, but the durthans were eventually defeated.

==Base of Operations==
The durthans secretly used the [[Erech Forest]] similar to how the hathrans used the [[Urlingwood]]. They constructed [[Citadel Tralkarn]] within the forest.
