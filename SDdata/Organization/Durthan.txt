The Durthans were a secretive group of women who operated in Rashemen.
They called upon the darker spirits of the country. They were the antithesis of the Witches of Rashemen and worked against them for the rulership of the realm.
They wore masks like the hathrans to disguise their identities and pretended that they were of the same order.
They used dark magic and were very seductive.
In the , the durthans attempted to overthrow the order and seize Rashemen. Strife between the hathrans and their dark sisters lasted for decades, but the durthans were eventually defeated.
The durthans secretly used the Erech Forest similar to how the hathrans used the Urlingwood. They constructed Citadel Tralkarn within the forest.
