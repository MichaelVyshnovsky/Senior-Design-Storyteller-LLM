The '''Muckgrunters''' were a group of [[troll]]s who dwelt in [[Forestfall Fen]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Owing to the ideal conditions in the swampy Forestfall Fen, the Muckgrunter trolls were right at home. They clashed with the [[Queenstooth]] [[kobold]]s, intent on taking the territory around [[Throden]] that the kobolds were trying to defend. The trolls took advantage of their regenerative abilities to keep the fighting going almost constantly.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the trolls' conflicts with the kobolds served as part of the escalation that awoke the bloodthirsty [[holdfast vine]]s of Forestfall Fen. Not long after, [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]] arrived in the swamp, and humbled the Muckgrunter leader, [[Knucklespine]], on their way to investigate why the swamp was rapidly expanding.
