The '''Handful of Coins''', who were also simply called the '''Coins''', were a secret group of merchants within [[Zhentil Keep]] who were not affiliated with the [[Zhentarim]]. They were an informal group who protected their members from abuse by the lords and/or the Zhentarim. They also protected themselves from the magistrate and tried to improve foreign trade in the Keep. Their true power, however, derived from the sponsorship by some [[beholder]]s that provided secret aid for the Coins against the Zhentish assaults. The [[beholder]]s helped them behind the scenes in order to balance the Zhent's power and also involved anti-Zhent groups like [[Knights of the North]].

==History==
The Handful of Coins disbanded after the [[1368 DR]] invasion by [[Cyric]]'s monstrous army, with many of their members dead or fleeing the city. They reformed sometime after and pledged their loyalty to Lord [[Orgauth]]. In [[1373 DR]] the Handful still existed but ran a black market.
