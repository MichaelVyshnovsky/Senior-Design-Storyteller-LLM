        "mainbody": "The Circus of Wonders was a traveling circus run by the kenku Corvus Nightfeather in the late 15 century DR. The circus traveled throughout Tethyr and other regions in southern Faer√ªn and was used by Corvus as a cover for his activities as a spy for various factions.  Acts included clowns, historical reenactments, a strongman and aerial performances. Prominent members around 1479 DR included Tobin, Mattias Farseer, Trill, and the twin halfling aerialists Shan and Cynda."
