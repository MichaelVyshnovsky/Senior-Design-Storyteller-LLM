        "mainbody": "The '''Circus of Wonders''' was a traveling circus run by the [[kenku]] [[Corvus Nightfeather]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The circus traveled throughout [[Tethyr]] and other regions in southern [[Faerûn]] and was used by Corvus as a cover for his activities as a spy for various factions.  Acts included clowns, historical reenactments, a strongman and aerial performances. Prominent members around [[1479 DR]] included [[Tobin]], [[Mattias Farseer]], [[Trill]], and the twin [[halfling]] aerialists [[Shan]] and [[Cynda]]."
