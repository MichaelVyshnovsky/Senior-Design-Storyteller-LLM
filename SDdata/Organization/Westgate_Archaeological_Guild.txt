'''Westgate Archaeological Guild''' was an archeological organization that operated in the city of [[Westgate]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Starting with the {{YearlinkName|1354}}, Westgate Archaeological Guild started petitioning the Council of Westgate for a permit to excavate in the [[Hills of the Seven Lost Gods]], just outside the city walls. The guild re-submitted petitions annually, continuing to do so at least through the end of the 14{{th}} century DR.

To educate the citizens and visitors of Westgate, the guild contracted a public [[Optic aid|telescope]] in the city's [[Market Triangle]], affixed aimed at the Seven Hills to the southwest. The lens was activated by depositing five meager [[gold]] [[coin]]s into a slot. By the telescope, the guild installed a plaque that recounted the Hills' history. The information covered the ''Templeban Edict'' of the {{YearlinkName|927}}; the formation of shrines to [[Seven Lost Gods|seven god]]s on the hills, to [[Moander]], [[Garagos]], [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Jergal]], [[Savras]], [[Silvanus]], and a final long-forgotten deity; as well as the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, when the Hills stopped being used as places of worship and the ''Templeban Edict'' was lifted.

Westgate Archaeological Guild's interest in the Hills' excavation was due to their religious use that predated Westgate and dated as far back as the [[Jhaamdath Empire]]. The guild sought to uncover historical information hidden deep within the Seven Hills. However, the Council of Westgate declined petitions, citing religious respect for the site.
