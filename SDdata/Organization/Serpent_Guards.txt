The Serpent Guards were a fellowship of warriors and crusaders based in Unther devoted to the Dragon Queen Tiamat and her spawn in the mid–14 century DR.
These fanatics were charged with guarding Tiamats cult in Unther and the surrounding lands. They did this by defending temples, hunting down and slaying trespassers and those who would investigate the cults activities, and robbing and assassinating people and other churches who worked to bring order to chaotic Unther. They also worked as henchmen to dragons and hunted dragon-slayers. They were known to attack Mulhorandi soldiers during the invasion in the early 1370s DR.
Their ranks included monks who could cross-train freely as fighters, rogues, assassins, and divine champions.
