The '''Serpent Guards''' were a fellowship of warriors and [[crusader]]s based in [[Unther]] devoted to the Dragon Queen [[Tiamat]] and her spawn in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}}

==Activities==
These fanatics were charged with guarding Tiamat's cult in Unther and the surrounding lands. They did this by defending temples, hunting down and slaying trespassers and those who would investigate the cult's activities, and robbing and assassinating people and other churches who worked to bring order to chaotic Unther. They also worked as henchmen to [[dragon]]s and hunted dragon-slayers. They were known to attack [[Mulhorandi]] soldiers during the invasion in the early 1370s DR.

==Members==
Their ranks included [[monk]]s who could cross-train freely as [[fighter]]s, [[rogue]]s, [[assassin]]s, and [[divine champion]]s.
