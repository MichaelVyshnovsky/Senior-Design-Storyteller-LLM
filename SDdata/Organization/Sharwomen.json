        "mainbody": "The '''Sharwomen''' were a [[thieves]] [[guild]] based in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]] in the 1360s [[DR]].",
        "Leadership": "The Sharwomen were directly controlled by the [[Cult of the Shadow]], the local [[temple]] and worshipers of [[Shar]]. Their head was the high priestess of Shar, but her identity was unknown in both roles.",
        "Base": "The Sharwomen's headquarters were in the temple itself, such that the temple doubled as a thieves' guild.",
        "Organization": "As their name suggested, the Sharwomen were originally only open to female members. Tsurlagol once had two thieves' guilds, divided by gender. However, when the separate men-only thieves' guild was wiped out years before, the Sharwomen began accepting male members into their ranks.\n\nAlthough open to both genders by [[1367 DR]], the guild remained unequal. Male thieves held lesser positions and did most of the work, while the original female thieves dominated in high-ranking positions, and received much of the gold and credit. There were still relatively few male members by [[1370 DR]].",
