        "mainbody": "The Brightstar Sash was an adventuring band operating in Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR.\nAt some point, the Brightstar Sash recruited Caladnei, then a minor sorceress, while they passed through Turmish. Though at first she was put off somewhat by their lecherous ways, she was too tempted by gold and adventure to refuse. She was a part of the team during a successful adventure that netted them in excess of 6,000 gp. She also saw, and used, her first portal while a part of the company.\nAlso while Caladnei was a member, Bertro was slain by a wyvern and Rimardo and Vonda were killed while trying to rob a nobleman in Waterdeep, also bringing the wrath of that nobles guards on the rest of the Sash, running them out of the city. Caladnei briefly returned to Turmish upon learning of her mothers death, to see her father. The last one of the original group to die while she was a part of the group was Thloram Flambaertyn, who died of a fall in the Great Rift.\nCaladnei and Marcon were the last two survivors of the group. During an adventure in which they tracked down a house heir for Sarde Telchaedrin in Halruaa, Caladnei received word from Meleghost Telchaedrin that her father was dying and was urged to leave Halruaa quickly. She cast a teleport spell, effectively dismissing herself from the party and leaving Marcon as the only person who was part of the group when she joined. He later found new blades to replace the old party members.\n* Caladnei, later Royal Mage of Cormyr\n* Thloram Flambaertyn\n* Vonda\n* Bertro\n* Marcon\n* Rimardo"
