        "History": "The members met when [[Bran Oakenshire]] was 24 years old, in a tavern near the docks of [[Waterdeep]]. At that time, [[Syussa Broar]] was on the run from a bounty hunter of [[Cormyr]], and [[Elthure Vildenof]] had turned his back on the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. They initially struck out for [[Myth Drannor]], and while they barely escaped with their lives, they continued to adventure together, eventually becoming regarded as protectors of the heartlands.\n\nThe Stalwart Lions founded Crosswinds Keep after one of their members, Bran Oakenshire, proposed to [[Moala Adrell]]; due to the disparity in their lifespans, Bran being a [[human]] and Moala an [[elf]], they decided to settle down in the [[Astral Plane]] after she was given the mission by [[Chauntea]] through a vision.",
