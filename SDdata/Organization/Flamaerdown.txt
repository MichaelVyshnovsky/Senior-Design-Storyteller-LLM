'''Flamaerdown''' was a noble family from [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Flamaerdowns were presumed extinct. The family's huge estate stood in the [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]] on [[Aundle's Walk]]. Subsequently, the estate was repurposed into the [[Temple Bell]], a shop that dealt in religious paraphernalia, [[holy symbol]]s, and religious texts from numerous denominations.
