The '''Shieldsar''' was the standing army of the city of [[Sundabar]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Duties==
The Shieldsar patrolled the wilderness on [[horse]]back, fully armed. Ever vigilant, and wary of potential ambushes, patrol leaders got to know every foot of their respective routes.

==Forces==
The Shieldsar possessed the following numbers, in given roles:
;[[1372 DR]]:
:646 heavy infantry
:308 archers
:325 light cavalry
:173 heavy cavalry

Under the leadership of [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]], the Sundabar lent 200 of their soldiers to the [[Argent Legion]] after the formation of the [[League of the Silver Marches]].

===Members===
The Shieldsar would often take in members of of the [[Watchful]] or [[Stone Shields]] that became complacent, or who flirted with corruption. By the same token, "problematic" soldiers of the Shieldsar were often transferred to a post with the [[Watchblade]].
