The Order of the Dawn was a secretive religious cult that venerated the slumbering Primordials of Laerakond.
The Order of Dawn preached that before dragons Laerakond was a peaceful land inhabited by humanoids who lived in harmony with the Dawn Titans, and that, in their slumber, the Dawn Titans were aware of all that had befell to the good people of Laerakond. They believed that, if the worship of the order was pure and strong enough, the Dawn Titans would return to the world and reclaim the dragons as the steeds they were meant to be, restoring Laerakond to a golden age of freedom.
The Order of Dawn, like other cults to the Primordials, did not have any esoteric knowledge or rituals, and thus their secret meetings were merely for show. The Order of the Dawn was unique because they purported to possess relics of the Dawn Titans. Among those relics was a massive skull that would sometimes speak. Members believed the skull was from an ancient primordial killed by the dragon Gorloun.
The Order of the Dawn was founded in the city of Mreyelundar by Rowan Babar a few years before 1479 DR. In the first years of the order, some members once alleged that Rowan was the one talking behind the Primordial skull, and that he sought to dupe the cultists. All those members met untimely ends, and the newest lot knew nothing about this event.
At some point, members of the order printed a book called Primordials and their Servitors, that was banned by the dragons of Laerakond.
