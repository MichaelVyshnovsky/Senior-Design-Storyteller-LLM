'''Shoreside Shipping Consortium''' was a shipping company part of the [[Mariners' Alliance]] of [[Daggerford]] that operated throughout the length of [[Delimbiyr River]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Relationships==
Like many other shipping companies, Shoreside Shipping Consortium was a member of the Mariners' Alliance, receiving and facilitating contracts and connecting traders of sea and river merchant shipments. Shoreside Shipping Consortium also had ties to a businessman turned Baron, [[Matagar Bugo]].

==History==
In 1372 DR , Mariners' Alliance stoke a profitable trading deal via Shoreside Shipping Consortium. ''Barracuda'' was involved in regular shippings of weapons and armor that passed through Daggerford. Suspiciously enough, Barracuda's final destination was omitted from the logs kept in Mariners' Alliance guildhall.

[[Astriel Shalyn]], an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]] suspected foul play and asked a group of adventurers allied with her to investigate the Mariners' Alliance. The adventurers infiltrated the guildhall, eventually recovering the thick ledger that led them to Shoreside Shipping Consortium's vessel ''Barracuda''.

This led them to discover the Mariners' Alliance affiliation with [[Zhentarim]] in the evil organization's intricate plot of taking over Daggerford's rulership. Shoreside Shipping Consortium's vessel ''Barracuda'' was smuggling numerous shipments of weapons and armor to the [[orc]] and [[tanarukk]] hordes swelling outside the city preparing an invasion, with Zhentarim's sponsorship.
