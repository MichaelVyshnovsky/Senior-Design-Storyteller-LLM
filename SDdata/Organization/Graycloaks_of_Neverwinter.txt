The '''Graycloaks''' was the militia that protected the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the 14{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==Background==
The Graycloaks earned their name from the grey cloaks they wore, as they didn't have the funds to afford proper uniforms.

==Organization==
The Graycloaks had 400 members, a mounted force of archers and spearmen, although they were trained in the use of other weapons.

In peacetime, 60 Greycloaks always acted as Neverwinter's police force while 60 of them were on leave and another 60 were re-training.

==Headquarters==
The Graycloaks had two garrisons, at the northeastern and southeastern gates.

==Possessions==
Besides their arms and grey cloaks, the militia had the [[blastglobe]]s made by the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] [[wizard]]s, although they used such magic items only in times of need.

==History==
After the short but brutal war between Neverwinter and [[Luskan]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}} and the [[Shadow War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Neverwinter's wealth was grained, and the region's economy teetering on the edge of collapse. In these dire circumstances, the Graycloaks of Neverwinter were left poorly funded and equipped. Some members of the militia were not equipped even with the simplest grey-dyed cloth armor due to the lack of funds, but even then, they wore the titular grey cloaks. During that period of time, most Greycloaks were civilian-soldiers who received poor training, while veterans of the two wars held higher ranks in the organization. But by mid-1370s [[DR]], the Graycloaks' financing was slowly recovering with the aid of the region's economy being rebuilt with the aid of several mercantile groups of Neverwinter, including the [[Mercantile House]] of merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]].

The Graycloaks were disbanded after the destruction of Neverwinter.

==Legacy==
The Graycloaks faction of the [[Sons of Alagondar]] got their name from the milita.
