The '''She-Wolves''' were an all-female [[amazon]] mercenary company based in the island of [[Ixinos]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The She-Wolves had two units of infantry, one of cavalry and one of archers, each of 50 members. There were also 10 scouts, 10 [[sorceress]]es, and 20 [[priestess]]es.

==Tactics==
They were a very cohesive group, able to fight on all kinds of terrain. They were also very skilled at changing tactics during a battle thanks to a rapid code.

==Contracts==
The She-Wolves never accepted work from men that looked down on women, andÂ followed a code of honor trying to help all women in need. They also acted as the army of Ixinos, and charged 500 [[gold piece]]s per week for their services.

==History==
The She-Wolves were founded ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1258}}, to allow the amazons of Ixinos to satisfy their wanderlust and earn coin for their island home.

On the isle of [[Ixinos]] in the Vilhon Reach lived a matriarchal [[human]] culture where women were trained as warriors from birth. Around [[1258 DR]], they started going outside the island and acted as a mercenary company. In time, they destroyed a large number of pirate groups in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The amazon society of Ixinos existed in seclusion from the rest of the Reach. They engaged in trade but kept it exclusive to female-captained merchant ships.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the She-Wolves [[Brianna Tarvison]] and [[Pahelhe Firecaster]], were among the guests of Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Cormyr]].

As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, amazons of the She-Wolves company continued to helm mercenary campaigns in the Vilhon Reach and defended the shores of Ixinos from pirate incursions.
