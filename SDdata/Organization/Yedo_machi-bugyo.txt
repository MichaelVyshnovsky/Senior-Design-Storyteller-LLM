The '''yedo machi-bugyo''' was the office that oversaw the police force of [[Wa]] and its local governments.

There were two officials in this office, both honored by Wa's citizens, like all other officers in the shogun's government. The shogun had to approve any appointments to the yedo machi-bugyo.
