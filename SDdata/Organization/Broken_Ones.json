        "mainbody": "The Broken Ones were a monastic order devoted to the god Ilmater.\nThe Broken Ones numbered both monks and swordsages among their ranks. The order had no temple or monastery to call a base, and nor did they have a fixed hierarchy.\nThe Broken One monks were kind and enduring, and they acted purely in the name of Ilmater. Swordsages of the order were ascetics who remained detached from the world and lacked zeal.\nMembers of the order were responsible for the defense of Ilmaters temples and shrines, as well as his followers. They also sought to track down and punish those who inflicted cruelty, especially followers of Loviatar. They performed good deeds and righted bad ones.\nThe Broken Ones regularly traveled as pilgrims through the Dalelands, stopping at temples of Ilmater if no other lodging was available. They often visited the many shrines in the region.\nA Broken One monk pursued the paths of a healer and a hunter in service to the faith. As a healer, they learned the skills of treating injuries and dispensing medicine, and could even develop the ability to lay on hands and heal injuries with a touch. As a hunter, they also learned the skills of wilderness survival and tracking. They were dogged in the pursuit of tormentors, and could develop supernatural skill in following the tracks of Loviatans. Such hunters had only to touch the body of one recently harmed by a Loviatan to see the true face of their attacker. Some could even learn a locate creature spell specific to locating worshipers of Loviatar.\nSome Broken Ones learned tactics in combat by which they could swiftly intervene and save an ally from an attack, at the cost of suffering the blow in their place. This effort could leave them wearied, if not slain by the blow.\nMonks of the Broken Ones could cross-train freely as clerics, as well as divine champions, divine disciples, divine seekers, hierophants, arcane devotees, and swordsages.\nPeople often mistook the monks of the Order of the Long Death, who regularly disguised themselves as beggars, for Broken Ones. This angered the Ilmatari.\nCategoryMonastic orders\nCategoryIlmatari organizations\nCategoryReligious organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Faer√ªn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nrpxn8ynyik378975nby875tynlnqeke"
