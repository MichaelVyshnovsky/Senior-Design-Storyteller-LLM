}}The '''Doom Brigade''' was a group of ten [[helmed horror]]s under orders of the [[beholder]] [[Vaxall]].{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|69-70}}

==History==
The Doom Brigade was crafted by [[Teldorn Darkhope]] using the [[doom of Bane]] [[spell]].

In [[1370 DR]], the Doom Brigade was led by [[Gauntlet (battle horror)|Gauntlet]] and accompanied by [[Skullpyr]]. They tried to stop the awakening of the [[Knights of the Crescent Moon]], considering them a threat for its master.

==Organization==
The Doom Brigade worked as a very efficient war-machine thanks to [[telepathy|telepathic]] coordination by Gauntlet. Each of the helmed horrors had some kind of individuality but they were totally loyal to Gauntlet and to Vaxall.
