The Doom Brigade was a group of ten helmed horrors under orders of the beholder Vaxall.
The Doom Brigade was crafted by Teldorn Darkhope using the doom of Bane spell.
In 1370 DR, the Doom Brigade was led by Gauntlet and accompanied by Skullpyr. They tried to stop the awakening of the Knights of the Crescent Moon, considering them a threat for its master.
The Doom Brigade worked as a very efficient war-machine thanks to telepathic coordination by Gauntlet. Each of the helmed horrors had some kind of individuality but they were totally loyal to Gauntlet and to Vaxall.
