        "mainbody": "he Nail was a mercantile secret society based in the realm of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach in the mid–14 century DR.\nThey comprised a loose but widespread web of traders and shopkeepers. They identified each other by means of a nail cupped in one hand while they tried to make contact.\nInstead of operating in the open like most mercantile organizations, and thus attracting the attention of thieves and bandits, members of the Nail had ambitions of infiltrating and covertly taking over their rivals in trade. For example, they had plans to infiltrate facilities that provided exclusive service to certain costers and caravan companies and operate them for Nail members as well, providing themselves with better prices and better service. They also wished to establish local buyers, moneychangers, and warehouses that would offer beneficial services to Nail members similar to how costers aided their own moment, but in secret. For this, they had their eyes on key neighboring cities, including Airspur, Arrabar, Lheshayl, Nimpeth, Ormath, Reth, Riatavin, and Westgate. But most outrageously, they called for the covert takeover of pirate ships on the Sea of Fallen Stars and turning them into privateers who would engage in trade beneficial to Turmishan interests while still preying on the ships of rival realms.\nOnly recently formed by 1360 DR, they seemed to be growing quickly. However, they were still just a muddled assortment of individual merchants who could help one another out, usually with an underhanded deal at a discount.\nDespite this, the Nail were under investigation by both the Ghost Swords and Alagôns Free Council, with several councilors hiring adventurers to identify their leadership and ascertain their direction. There were fears that the Zhentarim or powers in Thay were behind the Nail and would seize full control after it was established, or else that some pirates were using it to fund their retirement."
