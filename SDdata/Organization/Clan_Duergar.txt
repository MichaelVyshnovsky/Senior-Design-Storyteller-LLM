'''Clan Duergar''' was a [[shield dwarf]] clan of [[Shanatar]] whose members were eventually enslaved by the [[illithid]]s and became the [[duergar]], a race of gray dwarves.

==History==
The Clan was one of many who splintered off to form a new kingdom in the early days of Shanatar, venerating [[Laduguer]] in a strict theocracy, naming it [[Barakuir]]. The sub-kingdom held fierce rivalries with neighbouring [[Drakkalor]] and [[Ultoksamrin]], which became conflict from about {{Yearlink|-9000}} in the [[Spawn Wars]].{{Cite dragon/267/The City of Sunken Spires|40}}

Barakuir swore allegiance to Shanatar and the [[Wyrmskull Throne]] but Clan Duergar, the ruling clan of the sub-kingdom, became more and more tyrannical, leading more and more dwarves of other clans to flee.

During the [[Mindstalker Wars]] around {{Yearlink|-8100}}, Barakuir became cut off from the rest of Shanatar, and fell to its illithid conquerers, who enslaved its populace for thousands of years. Eventually, as slaves, the inhabitants transformed into a new dwarven race known as the duergar (or gray dwarves). It rose up and liberated itself around {{Yearlink|-4000}}, spreading out into the [[Underdark]].
