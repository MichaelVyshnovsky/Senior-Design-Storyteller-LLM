        "History": "Several members of the little-known drow house were captured by a [[solar]] known as the [[the Winged]] to be sent to [[Thay]] in [[1369 DR]]. There, the drow were forced to participate in [[Dennaton]]'s gladiatorial battles against other captives. Among the members of the house sent to the [[Red Wizard]]'s arena were several male warriors, a [[wizard]], and even a [[priestess]]. The drow were killed when they were set against the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pits]]."
