Security was provided by their own guards or hired mercenaries and adventurers.\nThe Torch and Shield had offices on the North Way, one of the main thoroughfares in the Iron City that ran between Farrgaunlar and Handrornlar (the southern and northern gates through the walls of Khôltar, respectively)."
