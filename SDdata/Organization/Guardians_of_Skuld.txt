The '''Guardians of Skuld''' were a religious order devoted to gods of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] and dedicated to protect the city of [[Skuld]], the capital of [[Mulhorand]].

==Members==
This organization counted priests of [[Anhur]], [[Horus-Re]], [[Osiris]], and [[Isis]] (via the [[Sisters of Life]]) among its members.

==Activities==
They guarded the capital city against invasion and betrayal.

==History==
Previously unofficial, the existence of the Guardians of Skuld was formalized after the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. They were still active by [[1369 DR]].

==Leadership==
Leadership of the Guardians cycled between the different priesthoods. By 1369 DR, it had passed from the clergy of Horus-Re back to the church of [[Anhur]].
