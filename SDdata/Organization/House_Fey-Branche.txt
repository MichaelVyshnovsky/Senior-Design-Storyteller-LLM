'''House Fey-Branche''' was the fifth house of the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1484 DR]].

==Activities==
House Fey-Branche served as a lackey to a number of houses, most notably [[House Baenre]], hoping to curry favor with them.

==Headquarters==
House Fey-Branche was based in a defensive, triangular shaped compound in the [[Narbondellyn]] district of Menzoberranzan. The outer part of the compound consisted of a very high adamantine wall and the only entrance was a single gate. Anyone who approached within 30 feet of the walls in any area other than the gate were shot with ''[[lightning bolt]]'' spells. [[Shrieker]]s throughout the compound also called out alarms if anyone not wearing the house insignia was seen. 

Three towers anchored each corner of the compound and were used for defensive purposes. Within the walls were four main sets of buildings: slave pens (for about 400 slaves), a temple to [[Lolth]] (where the noble females lived), troop quarters (for about 200 soldiers), and family quarters (housing the rest of the house's commoners and male nobles).

==History==
House Fey-Branche was one of the oldest houses of Menzoberranzan, having been formed around âˆ’2500 DR. However, it experienced a great deal of bad luck over the centuries, especially the nobles, who have died in untimely accidents or assassinations.

During the [[Sable Years]], House Fey-Branche began as eleventh house. However, it rose to the position of eighth house in [[1338 DR]] as a result of the fall of [[House Do'Urden]] In [[1484 DR]], it became the fifth house after the departure of [[House Xorlarrin]] to [[Q'Xorlarrin]].

In [[1372 DR]], the Fey-Branche contingent was destroyed at the [[Pillars of Woe]].

In [[1484 DR]], First [[Matron Mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]] dined at House Fey-Branche for the [[Festival of the Founding]]. During the gathering, the ''[[Yor'thae]]'' of [[Lolth]] appeared, an indication that Quenthel was in Lolth's favor. That same year, [[Minolin Fey]] married [[Gromph Baenre]], the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]], and carried his child. The child was to be named Yvonnel and would become Quenthel's successor.
