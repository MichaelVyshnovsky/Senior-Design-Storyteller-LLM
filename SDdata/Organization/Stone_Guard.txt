The Stone Guard was a military corp in Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR. They served Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V as bodyguards, elite soldiers, and secret police.
In the 14 century DR, Horgar Steelshadow IV purged the Stone Guard of corrupt elements and installed captains and soldiers who were loyal to him, thus establishing a power base for when he took power circa 1372 DR.
Circa 1486 DR, corrupt members like Gorglak were present again within the organization, but high-ranking members and their commander Errde Blackskull were busy hunting for a more demonic corruption within the people of the city.
