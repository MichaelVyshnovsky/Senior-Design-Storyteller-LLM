        "mainbody": "Handmaidens of the Spider Queen, also known as the Daughters of the Yochlol, was an all-female order of Lolthite crusaders.\nThis organization acted as the instrument of Lolths will. They typically operated in small companies that were scattered throughout the Underdark, harassing merchant trains that viewed Vhaeraun as their protector and conducting hit-and-run raids on cities that were ruled by the clergy of Vhaeraun or Ghaunadaur.\nOn rare occasions they were assembled together into an army to bring Lolth-worshiping cities into line.\nThe members of this organization had no permanent ties to any specific city.\nThroughout the history of this organization, there were at least three known incidences in which they caused the destruction of a drow city that was drifting away from the worship of Lolth."
