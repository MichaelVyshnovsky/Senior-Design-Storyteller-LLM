The Council of Elders was the government of the city of Everlund in the Silver Marches. It was a council of individuals in prominent positions charged with running the city. It was led by the First Elder, who was able to hold the position until challenged by another member.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s, the Council of Elders voted 3-2 in favor of withdrawing Everlund from the Lords Alliance. Public belief about the reasons for this decision varied, but many believed that it was either a show of support for Sundabar and its treatment during the War of the Silver Marches or an attempt by the Zoar family to gain influence in the city.
