The '''Council of Elders''' was the government of the city of [[Everlund]] in the [[Silver Marches]]. It was a council of individuals in prominent positions charged with running the city. It was led by the First Elder, who was able to hold the position until challenged by another member.

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s, the Council of Elders voted 3-2 in favor of withdrawing Everlund from the [[Lords' Alliance]]. Public belief about the reasons for this decision varied, but many believed that it was either a show of support for [[Sundabar]] and its treatment during the [[War of the Silver Marches]] or an attempt by the [[Zoar]] family to gain influence in the city.
