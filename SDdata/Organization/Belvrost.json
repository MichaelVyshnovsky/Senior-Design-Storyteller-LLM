        "mainbody": "The '''Belvrost''' clan was a magically powerful family of [[Reddansyr]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] known in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|76-77}}",
        "Description": "Belvrosts were mostly burly, with brown hair and eyes on faces described as bearlike and friendly. However, some female members of their blood instead grew slender, with green eyes and red hair. Almost all of them had the spark for [[the Art]].",
        "History": "The clan was based out of Reddansyr, where its members had largely numbered root-crop farmers and masons. They also owned some of the local inns. During his reign as the Magister from {{yearlink|1322}} to {{yearlink|1328}}, [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]] arranged for marriages in this clan that would produce more mages.\n\nBy {{yearlink|1370}}, the best known Belvrosts were [[Chasler Belvrost]] and [[Telgerd Belvrost]].",
        "Structure": "The clan had outposts in [[Baernwood]], [[Redwater (settlement)|Redwater]], and [[Nathlekh]]. They numbered maybe two hundred mages of some skill, twenty of them being quite worthy of the title of a wizard. The patriarch and matriarch, [[Maelaeve Belvrost]] and [[Arildan Belvrost]], lived in the manor of [[Sundstone]] in [[Baernwood]] by {{yearlink|1370}}.",
        "Powers": "One or two Belvrosts every generation could \"read items\", perceiving mental scenes of the past events or owners of those items by touch, and the ability to send and receive mental missives in a manner akin to ''[[sending]]''. All Belvrosts had the ability to respond to such a ''sending''.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Belvrosts were largely considered trustworthy, if a bit strange. They themselves believed [[Mystra]] had created them for a purpose yet unknown, and liked to pass down legends of their magically powerful members, such as [[Narvar Belvrost]] and [[Halbadan Belvrost]].",
        "Notable Belvrosts": "* [[Arildan Belvrost]]\n* [[Chasler Belvrost]]\n* [[Halbadan Belvrost]]\n* [[Maelaeve Belvrost]]\n* [[Narvar Belvrost]]\n* [[Telgerd Belvrost]]\n* [[Jadaster Belvrost]]\n* [[Orlimar Belvrost]]"
