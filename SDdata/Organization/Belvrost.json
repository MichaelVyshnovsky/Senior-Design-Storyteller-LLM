The patriarch and matriarch, Maelaeve Belvrost and Arildan Belvrost, lived in the manor of Sundstone in Baernwood by .\nOne or two Belvrosts every generation could \"read items\", perceiving mental scenes of the past events or owners of those items by touch, and the ability to send and receive mental missives in a manner akin to sending. All Belvrosts had the ability to respond to such a sending.\nBelvrosts were largely considered trustworthy, if a bit strange. They themselves believed Mystra had created them for a purpose yet unknown, and liked to pass down legends of their magically powerful members, such as Narvar Belvrost and Halbadan Belvrost.\n* Arildan Belvrost\n* Chasler Belvrost\n* Halbadan Belvrost\n* Maelaeve Belvrost\n* Narvar Belvrost\n* Telgerd Belvrost\n* Jadaster Belvrost\n* Orlimar Belvrost"
