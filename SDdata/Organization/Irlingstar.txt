The members of House Irlingstar resided at the three- and four-story buildings collectively known as [[Irlingstar Villa]] in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] on the northwest corner of [[Sul Street]] and [[Delzorin Street]]. They also had a rowhouse in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] called Sablehearth, on [[Swords Street]] between [[Blackstaff Tower]] and the [[Font of Knowledge]].

==History==
In the early 1340s DR, the patriarch's consort, Nael, was replaced by a [[malaugrym]] named [[Amarune]]. She had a daughter named [[Sintre]], who died, leaving the family without a direct heir. In [[1370 DR]], [[Hlaavin]] of the Unseen discovered Amarune's true identity and began extorting her.
