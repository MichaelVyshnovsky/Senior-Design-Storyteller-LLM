The members of House Irlingstar resided at the three- and four-story buildings collectively known as Irlingstar Villa in the Sea Ward on the northwest corner of Sul Street and Delzorin Street. They also had a rowhouse in the Castle Ward called Sablehearth, on Swords Street between Blackstaff Tower and the Font of Knowledge.
In the early 1340s DR, the patriarchs consort, Nael, was replaced by a malaugrym named Amarune. She had a daughter named Sintre, who died, leaving the family without a direct heir. In 1370 DR, Hlaavin of the Unseen discovered Amarunes true identity and began extorting her.
