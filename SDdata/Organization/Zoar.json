Coin, commerce, trade, call it what you will, but it is what drives this great city. Granted, the Lords rule it wisely and well, but the Guilds constantly believe that, since they control the majority of the city's lifeblood, they should control the city.

        "History": "The historic conflict known as the [[Guildwars]] concluded in Waterdeep in the {{YearlinkName|1262}}, leaving [[Ehlemm Zoar]] of the [[Gemcutters Guild]] – one of the two guildmasters to survive. The two – Ehlemm Zoar and [[Lhorar Gildeggh]], soon after declared themselves Two Lords Magister of the City of Splendors. in an uproar of Waterdhavian nobility. The rulership of Waterdeep was restructured, and both Lords Magister's families were exiled.\n\nThe Zoar family removed themselves from Waterdeep and relocated to Everlund after the scandal that stripped them of nobility. Over the century that followed, they gained political and financial power in Everlund, and by the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Zoar family held a position on Everlund's [[Council of Elders]]. Other locales where the Zoars could be found by the mid-14{{th}} century DR were the cities of [[Luskan]], [[Scornubel]], and the nation of [[Amn]]. The family considered the rulers of Waterdeep their sworn enemies.\n\nAt some point between the {{YearlinkName|1346}} and the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, during [[Tamaeril Bladesemmer]]'s tenure as a [[Lord of Waterdeep]], a member of the Zoar family was slain by a knight of [[Waterdeep]]. That man was the father of [[Amril Zoar]]. In the years since, Amril Zoar came to possess a book written by a mage lord [[Ahghairon]] on the use of ''[[echo gate]]s'', capable of bypassing most of the wards in Waterdeep.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}} he resolved to get revenge for his father's death, and using the ''echo gates''. Amril ambushed [[Piergeiron Paladinson]], the Open Lord at the time, and ''[[charm person|charm]]ed'' him, finding out the identities of all the [[Masked Lord]]s of Waterdeep. He then attacked the Open Lord, severely wounding him.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|126|9}}{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|115-120|7}} His attempts on the lives of [[Mirt the Moneylender]], [[Durnan]], and [[Laeral Silverhand]], however, were unsuccessful.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|153-156|10}} Eventually, young Zoar was confronted and defeated by [[Storm Silverhand]], [[Elminster Aumar]], Piergeiron Paladinson, [[Asper]], and Mirt. Before they could kill him, Storm pleaded for them to have mercy on him as he was worthy of becoming a [[Harper]], and swore that she would kill him herself if he returned to his murderous ways.\n\nSometime before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a young girl from the Zoar family brunch that settled in Amn was murdered. [[Cahorl Krimmevol]] was framed for the murder by his older brother Lord [[Jharvex Krimmevol]] in order to claim his lands.\n\nBy the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]], the Zoar family were among the three leaders and founders of the secret society called the [[Three-Headed Helm]]. [[Andrethra Zoar]], a resentful [[sorceress]] scion of the outcast family, was one of the three founders.{{Cite dragon/430/Eye on the Realms: The Three-headed Helm|45-46}} \n\nIn the late 1480s or early [[1490 DR|1490s DR]], [[Tamalin Zoar]] became the new owner of the [[Calling Horns Inn]] not far from [[Yartar]] after retirement. ''Circa'' the same period of time, the Zoars purchased [[Danivarr's House]] in Everlund, a popular inn frequented by adventures.",
