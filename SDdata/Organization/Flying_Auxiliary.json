They were differentiated from the [[Pegasus Archery Company]], ironically enough, by the fact the mercenaries were only mounted upon [[horse]]s.",
        "Formation": "This military unit was assembled by the [[High Constable]] of High Dale, [[Irreph Mulmar]] in the late 1360's [[DR]]. In their inaugural iteration, they were commanded by a young [[paladin]] named [[Sothinar]]."
