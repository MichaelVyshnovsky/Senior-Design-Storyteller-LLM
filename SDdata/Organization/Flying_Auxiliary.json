        "mainbody": "The Flying Auxiliary was a squadron of 20 horse-archers of High Dale, each with a pegasus mount, who defended the dale in coordination with its local militia and hired mercenary company. They were differentiated from the Pegasus Archery Company, ironically enough, by the fact the mercenaries were only mounted upon horses.\nThis military unit was assembled by the High Constable of High Dale, Irreph Mulmar in the late 1360s DR. In their inaugural iteration, they were commanded by a young paladin named Sothinar."
