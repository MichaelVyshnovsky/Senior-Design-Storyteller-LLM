        "mainbody": "ouse Dhuurniv was a drow house in Maerimydra and the only house to survive the fall of Maerimydra in 1372 DR. This was due in part to the fact that they had holdings outside the city. Following their escape from the city, they fell in with the Zhentarims conquest of Shadowdale.\nPrior to the Weeping War, Matron Mother Laele Dhuurniv led the Maerimydran forces who wished to reclaim the Land Under Shadow. She accepted the truce that Aolis Ildacer offered the drow but was killed by Aoliss wife Amara Ildacer.\nAfter the events of the Weeping War (711â€“714 DR), House Dhuurniv was shunned by the other drow houses in Maerimydra for negotiating with the surface elves, despite regaining the Twisted Tower in the process. The three Matron Sisters withdrew largely from Maerimydra and took up residence mostly beneath the Twisted Tower.\nAfter the Silence of Lolth of 1372/1373 DR, the drow of Dhuurniv found themselves as the most powerful house left in Maerimydra. Despite the deaths of both Kurgoth Hellspawn and Irae Tsarran to a band of adventurers, House Dhuurniv was unsuccessful in reclaiming the city and decided to relocate fully to the Twisted Tower.\nSome time afterward, House Dhuurniv was contacted by Esvele Greycastle and agreed to an alliance between the Zhentarim, the Church of Shar, and their House. Together they took over Shadowdale briefly in 1374 DR.\nAunrae Dhuurniv Eldest of the Matron Sisters\nGreyanna Dhuurniv Middle sister of the Matron Sisters\nXullrae Dhuurniv Youngest of the Matron Sisters\nAzmaer Dhuurniv Last drow marshal of the Twisted Tower\nLaele Dhuurniv Former Matron Mother of House Dhuurniv\nLirdnolu Dhuurniv A drow cleric who guarded the Skull Subterranes"
