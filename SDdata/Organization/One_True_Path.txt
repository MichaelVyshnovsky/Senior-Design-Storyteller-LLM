==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, at a feast in [[Felmorel]], [[Barundryn Harbright]] enthusiastically introduced the One True Path after [[Thessamel Arunder]], a mage at the same feast, joked the reason for all mages committing the same mistakes over history was that they didn't have him to keep them from straying off the One True Path. According to Barundryn Harbright, they were a small sect of which he was a member, already holding power over a dozen towns, and with their sights set on a realm next.
