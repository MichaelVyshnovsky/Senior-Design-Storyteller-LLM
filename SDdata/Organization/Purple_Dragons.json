        "History": {
            "Precursors": "Cormyr was once part of the woodland empire of [[Cormanthyr]], where [[elves]] and [[dragon]]s fought for dominance. The most prominent of these was the [[black dragon]] [[Thauglor]], who was so old that his scales had acquired a purple hue. After the Cormyreans later defeated Thauglor and took the land for themselves, the purple-tinged scales of Thauglor would inspire the name of the Purple Dragons.\n\nIn the 420s DR, the Purple Dragons were originally an [[adventuring company]] comprising several Cormyrean nobles: [[Elvarin Crownsilver]], [[Glorin Truesilver]], [[Jotor Turcassan]], [[Omalra Dracohorn]], and [[Dintheron Bleth]]. Then, when the kingdom collapsed after the treacherous [[Melineth Turcassan]] sold the city of [[Suzail]] to the pirate lord [[Magrath the Minotaur]] in the {{YearlinkName|429}}, the Purple Dragons remained loyal to King [[Duar Obarskyr|Duar \"Longyears\" Obarskyr]]. They formed the core of a rebel army under the king's command, together with [[Amedahast]] and a dwindling number of rank-and-file soldiers following them. They strove for three long years to retake Cormyr from the pirate lord and the traitors that had allied themselves with him.\n\nThe increasingly ragtag band had great difficulty retaking the nation even though they had the full support of Cormyr's commoners. In the {{YearlinkName|432}}, another loyalist unit managed to take [[High Horn]] and the soldiers inside agreed to pledge themselves to the king if the Purple Dragons could win a single victory by themselves. Duar and Amedahast chose the remote [[Dhedluk (town)|Dheolur]], the hold of one of the traitorous noble families. With the help of a farmer named [[Dhedluk (human)|Dhedluk]] (whom Dheolur was later named after), and [[Threena Cormaeril]], the group stormed the main building. Magrath was being entertained there at the time, which allowed King Duar to kill the minotaur. This dealt a crippling blow to the traitors and earned the Dragons the allegiance of High Horn's troops, who helped to quickly bring the realm under Duar's rightful control.\n\nAlthough not explicitly stated, the royal army was most likely named in honor of this group.{{Speculation}}"
        },
        "Tactics": "In battlefields, the Purple Dragons were rarely pitted against fortifications. Thus, they had little use for [[siege machine]]s, and often relied on [[War Wizards]]' spells.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-11/Cormyrean battlefield tactics}}\n\nPurple Dragon Officers maintained an environment of excitement by sending their subordinates to surprise missions. This was done to stymie inactivity, agitation, or general dissatisfaction - all of which could lead to mischief or misplaced loyalties.\n\n{{quote|''Go get the glory you deserve! For Cormyr! For the glory of your house! For Cormyr!''}}\n\nAn old tradition within the Purple Dragons involved speedy creation of \"strike cavalry\" units, and filling its roster with nobles who sought laurels, but lacked temperance and experience in equal measure. These \"special forces\" served as excellent diversions and cannon fodder.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-04-24/Purple Dragons \"strike cavalry\"}}",
        "Leaving the Purple Dragons": {
            "Retirement": "Purple Dragons that served for a cumulative 12 years or more could retire as \"'''grayswords'''\". They qualified for being healed, cured of diseases, as well as getting any missing limbs restored. A test for [[lycanthropy]] followed (with treatment, if needed). Grayswords could bear weapons without need of peace-bonds or charters. Grayswords were offered the choice between a pension of 6 gold coins a month, and a \"glint\" / \"pepper\" pension of 2 gold coins a month alongwith a land grant. Such lands were usually along the [[Sembia]]n border & coast, or along the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] facing [[Tunlands]]. This served the crown well, for the civilisation and protection of such areas was desired.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-04-16/Purple Dragon retirement}}\n\nAn early retirement as a graysword was rare, but granted if the Purple Dragon underwent severe trauma, or grew sick of their work after dispensation of noteworthy deeds.\n\nIf the Purple Dragon lacked discipline (but was loyal to Cormyr or a good combatant) or the Crown had too many Purple Dragons, an honourable discharge could follow. A lumpsum payment of 10 gold coins was provided, no honour was considered lost, and the tenure served could counted towards the aforementioned 12 years for an eventual full retirement.\n\nIf subjected to dishonourable discharge or an outright dismissal, a Purple Dragon faced exile or deprivation of any pension & respect. This was usually the case when the crown did not wish to punish them, or could not validate their wrongdoings.",
            "Re-Enlistment": "In principle, it was possible to \"wear the Purple\" again. Frequent enlistments and departures from the Purple Dragon ranks, however, were looked upon with scrutiny.\n\nSuch aspirants had to approach a standing garrison larger than a mere watchpost or waypost. A [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] and an officer would then ask why the former Purple Dragon wished to serve again. Given sufficient cause for suspicion, the War Wizard employed [[Mind ream]]ing to ensure no blackmail, magical coercion, or subterfuge was at play. The applicant was asked where and how they wish to serve once more, but their assignment could very well be otherwise.\n\nGenerally, they were assigned to one rank lower than as they had left (unless they were a [[Blade (rank)|Blade]] - the lowest rank). After a period of good service (usually a \"season\"), they found themselves at their original rank and salary."
