        "mainbody": "The Phangarl family was wealthy and influential in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. They were one of twenty Houses that had a seat on the Onsruur&mdashthe council of lords that governed the Iron City.\nThis bloodline had no obvious distinguishing features. As a clan, they enjoyed acting, especially comedy, and enthusiastically supported playwrights and troupes that wrote and performed humorous works.\nIn Khôltar, the Phangarls owned a hinge-making company, several coach manufacturers, and some businesses that specialized in decoration. Foreign investments included various trading companies in Var the Golden. They also bred horses for sale, but were not equestrians by any means.\nThere was nothing funny about their trading tactics. The Phangarl clan secretly dealt with Shaaryan raiders, paying them to attack caravans belonging to or being used by their rivals, while leaving costers in which they had an interest alone."
