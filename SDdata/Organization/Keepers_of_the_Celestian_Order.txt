The Keepers of the Celestian Order was a secret society that defended the material plane from Far Realm incursions.
The Keepers of the Celestian Order operated in a decentralized structure. By the late 15 century DR, the order had few active members. 
Different groups of the Keepers of the Celestian Order existed, each of which adopted a specific name. One such group was the Black Arrows, which was based in the Vilhon Reach. Another group called the Tigers of Light operated near Ragheb. A third group was known as the Concord of Swords.
The Keepers of the Celestian Order was founded in the ancient past of the world of Nerath.
By the late 1400s DR, the organization was active in Faer√ªn.
