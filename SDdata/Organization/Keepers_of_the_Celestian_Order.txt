The '''Keepers of the Celestian Order''' was a secret society that defended the [[material plane]] from [[Far Realm]] incursions.

==Organization==
The Keepers of the Celestian Order operated in a decentralized structure. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the order had few active members. 

Different groups of the Keepers of the Celestian Order existed, each of which adopted a specific name. One such group was the Black Arrows, which was based in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Another group called the Tigers of Light operated near [[Ragheb]]. A third group was known as the Concord of Swords.

==History==
The Keepers of the Celestian Order was founded in the ancient past of the world of [[Nerath]].{{Cite dragon
