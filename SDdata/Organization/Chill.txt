The Chill was a military band of goblinoids and others. Its symbol, worn on the upper arm, was a fist surrounded by a white nimbus.
The Chill refrained from raiding nearby settlements in order to maintain good relations with the cities of the North, who would clandestinely hire the group to fight their enemies, notably trolls, orcs, and the Uthgardt.
The group charged 500 gold pieces per week.
Its base was Chill Tower in the Lurkwood.
The organization was opposed to the Bloodaxes and the Blue Sigil, and although not well-received by the orcs in the region, they were sometimes hired by them.
The Chill weâ€™re formed from the survivors of the Second Battle of Urml and led by Ardenor Crush (a reincarnation in a hobgoblin body). Its members headed into the North to slay the adventurers who had killed Ardenor.
Hobgoblin members of the Chill could be found along the Sword Coast circa 1368 DR. 
By the late 15 century DR, the Chill was a noteworthy mercenary force in the North, and comprised several Lurkwood goblinoid clans who had joined together.
* Ardenor Crush, leader of the organization as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
* Grangor, the wizard who reincarnated Ardenor.
* Cold Steel, 150 orc swordsmen
* Frigid Fists, 50 ogres
* Frost Riders, 100 hobgoblin axemen riding warhorses
* Icicles, 200 kobold archers and ambush specialists
* Winter Wolves, 100 goblin spearmen riding winter wolves
Each of the divisions was led by a lieutenant of the divisions race.
