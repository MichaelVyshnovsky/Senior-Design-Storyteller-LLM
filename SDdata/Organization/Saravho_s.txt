Saravhos was a coster that was headquartered in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This business signed up individual merchants, travelers, and smaller wagon trains to travel together in caravans and provided security in the way of their own guards or hired mercenaries and adventurers.
Saravhos maintained offices on the North Way, one of the main thoroughfares in Khôltar.
