        "mainbody": "'''Turvuld's Swords''' was a reserved mercenary company from [[Murghôm]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "Turvuld's Swords, like all other mercenary companies of Murghôm, was established by the country's military veterans who were forced into hired work by the army shrinkage decreed by the [[Princes of Murghôm]] over several decades. All companies, Turvuld's Swords included, were not bigger than 40 ex-military members in the full employment of the organization.\n\nThe company's insignia was the image of two crossed [[silver]] [[sable]]s on a dun-brown background. Both were depicted with sharp edges up, the weapon on the right laid atop the left blade. Between the two stood a silver [[spear]] pointing up.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}}century DR, Turvuld's Swords became well-known for being conservative professionals, stern and silent mercenaries who valued low risk and attention to detail."
