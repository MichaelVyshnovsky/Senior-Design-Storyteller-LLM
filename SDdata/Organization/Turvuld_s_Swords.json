        "mainbody": "Turvulds Swords was a reserved mercenary company from Murghôm, in the late 15 century DR.\nTurvulds Swords, like all other mercenary companies of Murghôm, was established by the countrys military veterans who were forced into hired work by the army shrinkage decreed by the Princes of Murghôm over several decades. All companies, Turvulds Swords included, were not bigger than 40 ex-military members in the full employment of the organization.\nThe companys insignia was the image of two crossed silver sables on a dun-brown background. Both were depicted with sharp edges up, the weapon on the right laid atop the left blade. Between the two stood a silver spear pointing up.\nBy the late 15century DR, Turvulds Swords became well-known for being conservative professionals, stern and silent mercenaries who valued low risk and attention to detail."
