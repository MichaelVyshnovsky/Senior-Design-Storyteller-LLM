The Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose were an order of paladins dedicated to the deity Sune, active during the 14 century DR.
These paladins of Lady Firehair sought to defend beauty and destroy those evil beings of Faer√ªn that were exceptionally repulsive in their deeds. They were particularly adept at destroying the undead.
