The '''Conclave of Spirits''' was a collection of [[spirit naga]]s who met annually within the [[Chultengar]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Activities==
Each spirit naga of the Conclave was a chieftain over a tribe of [[pterafolk]] within the jungles of the Chultengar. The spirit nagas met annually deep within the jungles. The Conclave of Spirits was led by a trio of [[ha-naga]]s. This meeting was extremely secretive and, as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, only two outsiders had ever witnessed it and escaped with their lives.
