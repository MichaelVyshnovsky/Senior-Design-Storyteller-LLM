        "mainbody": "The '''Onusclan''' was an [[orc]] clan that claimed the northern reaches of the [[Orsraun Mountains]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relations": "Around {{Yearlink|1370}}, the Onusclan was ruled by King [[Highstead]]. Under his competent leadership, the clan occasionally raided neighboring territories of the southern [[Ancient Ax]] [[goblin]] clan and the eastern [[Tattered Cloth]] [[kobold]]s. The orcs of Onusclan kept both neighboring kobolds and goblins in check and preoccupied, keeping them from growing or successfully waging wars against other enemies. However, whenever the Onusclan orcs trespassed in the [[Orbrekh]], the territory of a group of [[giant]]s calling themselves the [[community of the high brows]] that just wanted to be left alone, the giants decimated the orcs involved."
