The '''Wolf lodge''' was a lodge of [[Rashemaar berserkers]] based in the town of [[Taporan]] as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
As with most buildings in Taporan, the Wolf lodge's longhouse hugged the waterfront of the [[River Tir]].

==Activities==
The Wolf lodge was the largest of Taporan's many berserkers lodges. Most of these berserkers laid their enemies out before tearing them to pieces while they were downed.
