The '''Lords of War and Victory''' was a religious organization of elite [[crusader]]s who worshiped [[Gilgeam]], the Supreme Ruler of [[Unther]].

==Base of Operations==
As with all organizations devoted to Gilgeam that survived the [[Godswar]], the Lords of War and Victory were based within the [[Citadel of Black Ash]] in the [[Smoking Mountains]] of Unther.

==Organization==
The order was composed of 200 crusaders during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They guarded the entrances to the Citadel of Black Ash and used the nearby [[Black Ash Plain]] to drill and train. Crusaders of the Lords of War and Victory were recognizable for their black [[scale armor]] or [[plate mail]] and full [[helm]]s shaped to resemble their [[god]]'s visage.
