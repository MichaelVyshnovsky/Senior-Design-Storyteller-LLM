The '''Fengraths''' were a [[human]] family of mercenaries who became the rulers of village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. 

==History==
Originally a family of mercenaries, the Fengraths were hired to escort caravans between [[Loudwater]] and the elven colony of Thelthin'dul. However, the last caravan, some time before [[1272 DR]], returned to Thelthin'dul and discovered all of the citizens had vanished. The few remaining [[elves]] in the caravan refused to ever come near the place, so the fearless Fengraths moved into the Granite Tower at the center of the village. They declared themselves rulers of the renamed town, adopting the traditional local title [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlet]]. No one contested their claim.

Gauntlet Walenburh Fengrath invited [[strongheart halfling]]s to settle in the village in the 1280s DR. They came and they flourished. The Fengraths would rule for the next century.

By the early 1370s DR, her great grandson, Deogol Fengrath, was the Gauntlet of Shining Falls. Some time after [[Shieldmeet]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Deogol went missing for at least a month, his fate and whereabouts unknown.<ref>

==Base==
The Fengraths lived in [[Granite Tower (Shining Falls)|Granite Tower]] with their family, servants, and guards, who tended also to be family.
