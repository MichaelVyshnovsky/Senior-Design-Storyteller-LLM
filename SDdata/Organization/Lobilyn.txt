'''House Lobilyn''' was a wealthy noble family from the city of [[Hlath]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

===Activities===
The Lobilyn family made its fortune via logging operations in [[Nunwood]]. Like most noble merchant houses of [[Chondath]], House Lobilyn employed mercenaries to fight their battles and guard their logging interests. One such company was the [[Iron Lion Mercenary Band]].

==History==
On [[Tarsakh 16]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, House Lobilyn's logging operation in Nunwood was interrupted. Most of the logging camp's guards – Iron Lion Mercenary Band, were slaughtered by an army that claimed to be from Hlath's bitter competitor, the city of [[Reth]]. The takeover was to turn Hlath's and Reth's noble houses against each other and was secretly financed by a conspiring cabal of nobles in [[Arrabar]].
