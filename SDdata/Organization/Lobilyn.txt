On Tarsakh 16 of the , House Lobilyns logging operation in Nunwood was interrupted. Most of the logging camps guards – Iron Lion Mercenary Band, were slaughtered by an army that claimed to be from Hlaths bitter competitor, the city of Reth. The takeover was to turn Hlaths and Reths noble houses against each other and was secretly financed by a conspiring cabal of nobles in Arrabar.
