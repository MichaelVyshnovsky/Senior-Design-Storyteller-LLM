The Councilium of Prelates was the governing body of the fortified city of Saelmur, in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn.
The Councilium was made up of the high priests of each of Saelmurs seven largest faiths&mdashthe Church of Chauntea, the Church of Helm, the Church of Ilmater, the Church of Lathander, the Church of Oghma, the Church of Torm, and the Church of Tyr.
Around the later 14 century DR, a frequent topic of discussion during the Counciliums meetings was the Knights of the Black Gauntlet. and the neighboring city-state of Kzelter since 1370 DR. Many within the Councilium felt that war between Saelmur and the Knights was inevitable, but could not agree on how to approach the situation. The leader of the Church of Torm felt that they should strike soon, even threatening to wage an attack with just his own forces, while the leader of the Church of Tyr felt that the Saelmurrans had no chance of facing the Knights forces without outside aid.
