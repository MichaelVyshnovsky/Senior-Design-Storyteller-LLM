Using a ''[[portal]]'' to their outpost of [[Kyorlamshin]], led by Matron [[Haelra Tanor'Thal]]'s niece [[Kesra Tanor'Thal|Kesra]], they captured any potential slaves that they could and sold them in the bazaars of Skullport. House Tanor'Thal was, in fact, Skullport's most prominent drow slaving organization.\n\nPolitical pressure was being put on Matron Tanor'Thal back in Karsoluthiyl to allow access to Kyorlamshin's ''portal'' for the other houses of the city. This was a concession the matron mother did not wish to make.\n\nHouse Tanor'Thal also established itself in [[Spiderhaven]], where a lot of displaced drow had recently begun to dwell as of [[1375 DR]]."
