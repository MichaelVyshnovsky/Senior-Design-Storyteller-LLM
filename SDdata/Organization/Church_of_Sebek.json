        "mainbody": "The Church of Sebek was a collection of specialty priests called swamplords and clerics devoted to Sebek, the Crocodile God of the Mulhorandi pantheon. \nMost of the clergy within the church were swamplords and werecrocodiles. Titles used among the clergy included Glistening Jaws, Watery Death, Scales of Vengeance, Hungry Maw, and Bloody Teeth. Members of the clergy advanced in rank by besting their peers in combat. \nMembers of Sebeks clergy were required to slay at least one sentient creature per month to retain their powers. They were also required to create at least one werecrocodile per year from the population of Mulhorand.\nSebeks clergy whispered their thanks with each kill and left a small portion for Sebek to claim if he so desired.\nSebeks worship was isolated mostly within the Old Empires region of east Faer√ªn in Unther, Mulhorand, and Chessenta. The vast majority of Sebeks temples were simple huts or shrines found in or near swamps. The largest temple, the Rivers Maw was located in the city of Sekras in Unther.\nThere existed no knightly orders devoted to Sebek.\nThe Church of Sebek was nearly annhilated in the , by paladins of Osiris who slew most of Sebeks faithful in Sekras. Those who survived fled, later gathering in Chessenta within the Adder Swamp."
