The Wheelarit family was a local Amnian merchant house of Amnwater during the 14 century DR.
The Wheelarits had heavy investments in the local wheelwrights and caravan runners of Amnwater, giving them a strong influence over the crossroads town. They cooperated with the Ironseth and Yhliivast families to completely dominate the local economy, and by 1320 DR they had formed an oligarchy that unofficially owned the town. By 1370 DR, the Wheelarits followed the lead of the wealthier and more powerful Yhliivasts due to the financial debts accrued between them.
