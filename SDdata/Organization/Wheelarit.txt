The '''Wheelarit''' family was a local [[Amn]]ian merchant house of [[Amnwater]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Wheelarits had heavy investments in the local wheelwrights and caravan runners of Amnwater, giving them a strong influence over the crossroads town. They cooperated with the [[Ironseth]] and [[Yhliivast]] families to completely dominate the local economy, and by [[1320 DR]] they had formed an oligarchy that unofficially owned the town. By [[1370 DR]], the Wheelarits followed the lead of the wealthier and more powerful Yhliivasts due to the financial debts accrued between them.

==Members==
* Master [[Coram Wheelarit]], the family leader in 1370 DR.
