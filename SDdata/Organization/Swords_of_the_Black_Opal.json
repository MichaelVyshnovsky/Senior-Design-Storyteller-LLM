        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Swords of the Black Opal were among several formidable groups that protected the [[Firedrake Shores]] area of Tethyr. There were rumors that the Black Opal were paid by some pirates to serve as shore \"goods-guards.\" Travelers needed not worry about the Swords of the Black Opal or other bands unless they decided to despoil the Shores' natural beauty."
