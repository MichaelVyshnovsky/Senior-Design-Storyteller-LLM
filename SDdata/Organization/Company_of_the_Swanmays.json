        "mainbody": "The '''Company of the Swanmays''', or simply '''the Swanmays''', was a somewhat well-known all-female adventuring group of seven, active in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Alias's first adventuring party, the Swanmays, had been like that, all flash and fanfare. One encounter with trolls had taught them the wiser course of stealth and surprise.''|[[Alias]] of [[Westgate]]}}",
        "History": "The Company of the Swanmays had a long history that dated to the days of the old [[Myth Drannor]]. Princess [[Daemir]] was one of the group's ancient members.\n\nBefore Swanmays' alleged disbandment ''circa'' [[1350 DR]], the adventuring company often adventured around [[Suzail]], the [[Dalelands]], and surrounding regions. When they earned their living by guarding and guiding trader caravans through [[Cormanthor]], they often passed through [[Shadow Gap]] and stayed in the [[North Gate Inn]]. When seasons changed, they spent their winters in [[Shadowdale]], enjoying the warm company and strong drinks with [[Jhaele Silvermane]] at the [[Old Skull Inn]].\n\nEven though Alias' false memories suggested the adventuring group to be long-disbanded, they were very much still active. In [[1357 DR]], the Swanmays aided the adventuring party possessing the [[Azure Bonds]] to kill [[Dracandros]].\n\nA few years later, the Swanmays found themselves captured by a group of [[drow]] after they spent a night at [[Zhentil Keep]]. The drow occupied the keep, holding hostage some of the citizens, and all the Swanmays members but [[Silk (drow)|Silk]]. To the residents of Zhentil Keep's dismay, the drow were allowed to run amok as the leaders of the keep turned a blind eye to it all. The reason behind the abductions was that one of [[Bane]]'s three lieutenants, the [[marilith]] [[Kaliste]], was using the abductees as sacrifices. Silk managed to recruit heroes from [[Phlan]] to aid her in the rescue mission.",
        "Members": "* [[Silk (drow)|Silk]], the Swanmays' leader. She was very young for a drow, had lighter purplish skin tone, and black hair with a silver streak. She introduced herself as a rebel.\n* [[Cynthia]], a member of the Swanmays who went undercover while they were opposing Kaliste and lost her life in the process.\n* [[Alias]] of Westgate had false memories of being a member of the Swanmays in the past.\n* [[Kith]], the youngest member who was trained in magic under [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]] of Shadowdale.\n* [[Belinda]], the rowdy Swanmay who befriended Jhaele Silvermane."
