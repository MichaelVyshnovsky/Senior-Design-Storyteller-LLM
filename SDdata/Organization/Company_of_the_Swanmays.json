        "mainbody": "he Company of the Swanmays, or simply the Swanmays, was a somewhat well-known all-female adventuring group of seven, active in the mid–14 century DR.\nThe Company of the Swanmays had a long history that dated to the days of the old Myth Drannor. Princess Daemir was one of the groups ancient members.\nBefore Swanmays alleged disbandment circa 1350 DR, the adventuring company often adventured around Suzail, the Dalelands, and surrounding regions. When they earned their living by guarding and guiding trader caravans through Cormanthor, they often passed through Shadow Gap and stayed in the North Gate Inn. When seasons changed, they spent their winters in Shadowdale, enjoying the warm company and strong drinks with Jhaele Silvermane at the Old Skull Inn.\nEven though Alias false memories suggested the adventuring group to be long-disbanded, they were very much still active. In 1357 DR, the Swanmays aided the adventuring party possessing the Azure Bonds to kill Dracandros.\nA few years later, the Swanmays found themselves captured by a group of drow after they spent a night at Zhentil Keep. The drow occupied the keep, holding hostage some of the citizens, and all the Swanmays members but Silk. To the residents of Zhentil Keeps dismay, the drow were allowed to run amok as the leaders of the keep turned a blind eye to it all. The reason behind the abductions was that one of Banes three lieutenants, the marilith Kaliste, was using the abductees as sacrifices. Silk managed to recruit heroes from Phlan to aid her in the rescue mission.\n* Silk, the Swanmays leader. She was very young for a drow, had lighter purplish skin tone, and black hair with a silver streak. She introduced herself as a rebel.\n* Cynthia, a member of the Swanmays who went undercover while they were opposing Kaliste and lost her life in the process.\n* Alias of Westgate had false memories of being a member of the Swanmays in the past.\n* Kith, the youngest member who was trained in magic under Anastra Syluné Silverhand of Shadowdale.\n* Belinda, the rowdy Swanmay who befriended Jhaele Silvermane."
