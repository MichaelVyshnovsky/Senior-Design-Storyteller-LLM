The '''House of Asad''', also called the '''Children of the Lion''', was a powerful desert tribe of [[Al-Badia]] found in the [[High Desert]] of [[west Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p36-37">

==Organization==
Nearly five thousand [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]] men and women, divided into twenty separate clans, formed the House of Asad. With strong camels, beautiful daughters, and fine sons, this tribe was one of the wealthiest throughout the vast High Desert. Their pride as a whole bordered on sheer arrogance. Members of the House of Asad were typically very friendly but also easily offended.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p36-37"/>

==Base of Operations==
The House of Asad claimed the [[Jamal Oasis]], though they allowed enlightened nomads to use the life-giving oasis as well.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p36-37"/>

==Members==
The leader of the House of Asad in 1367 DR was Sheikh [[Najib bin Kamal al-Asad]]. Najib's wife, [[Alia al-Jamal umm Nabil|Alia al-Jamal]], took an active role in the leadership of the tribe.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p36-37"/>
