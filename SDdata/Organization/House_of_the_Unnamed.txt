The '''House of the Unnamed''' was an academy devoted to the study of [[truespeak]] in [[Velprintalar]], [[Aglarond]], during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The organization was basically just four study groups under the leadership of [[Elthenhelm Hamastyl]].

==Activities==
The four study groups concentrated on [[truespeak]]. Every member spent at least three hours, four times a [[tenday]],As weeks do not exist in the Realms and the minimum does not change when tendays are used instead, it is rendered as tendays. improving the library, at least 26 times a year.

==Resources==
While [[Candlekeep]] and the [[Leaves of Learning]] had bigger libraries with more volumes on truespeak, they were nowhere near as correctly catalogued and concentrated.

==Base of Operations==
They worked out of a small building next to the [[House of the Four Moons]].

==Members==
The four study groups were led by [[Sarlisha Kjenth]], [[Maaruel Vench]], [[Nelinarian Tansmith]], and [[Maerw√ªn Venedel]]. Other members included ten other [[human]]s, one other [[half-elf]], and three [[gnome]]s.
