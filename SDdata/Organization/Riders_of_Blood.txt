The Riders of Blood were renegades from the House of Hanif who operated along Dihl al-Taif in 1367 DR.
Located somewhere within the Haunted Lands, the Riders of Blood struck with the speed and savage efficiency of a sandstorm.
Because of their dislike of the subjugation of their tribe to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz, the Riders of Blood frequently targeted trade caravans traveling between Huzuz and Halwa.
All potential caravan targets were carefully scouted before any attack was made. A favored tactic was to have several wind mages batter the caravans with wind and sand for a few days before striking with lancers and bowmen.
The Riders of Blood fielded 250 skilled fighting men and women and several wizards. Fasim Kaldur was their leader.
Many of the Riders favored the jambiya since it was a symbol of freedom throughout the Land of Fate.
Though most of its members were humans, elves and half-elves were welcomed so long as they proved their loyalty to the Riders.
