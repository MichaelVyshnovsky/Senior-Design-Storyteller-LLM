Ship Rethnor was one of the five factions of Luskan ruled by a High Captain. It was named for and originally led by High Captain Rethnor.
In 1376 DR, the dwarf Athrogate, was employed by High Captain Kensidan Rethnor as a guard and informant. That implied a connection to the drow mercenary group Bregan Daerthe, since Athrogate was known to work with Jarlaxle, the leader of Bregan Daerthe.
Ship Rethnor was originally founded by Rethnor.
In 1376 DR, the current captain died and his son, Kensidan the Crow became the new High Captain.
As of 1483 DR, thugs from Ship Rethnor demanded tolls from any who wished to cross the crumbling Upstream Span.
Sometime before the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR, Hartouchen became the High Captain and took Rethnor as his surname.
