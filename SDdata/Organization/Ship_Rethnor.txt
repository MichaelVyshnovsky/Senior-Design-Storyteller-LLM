'''Ship Rethnor''' was one of the five factions of [[Luskan]] ruled by a [[High Captains (Luskan)|High Captain]]. It was named for and originally led by High Captain [[Rethnor]].

==Relationships==
In [[1376 DR]], the [[dwarf]] [[Athrogate]], was employed by High Captain [[Kensidan|Kensidan Rethnor]] as a guard and informant. That implied a connection to the [[drow]] mercenary group [[Bregan D'aerthe]], since Athrogate was known to work with [[Jarlaxle]], the leader of Bregan D'aerthe.

==History==
Ship Rethnor was originally founded by [[Rethnor]].<ref name="VoloN-p111" >

In [[1376 DR]], the current captain died and his son, [[Kensidan|Kensidan the Crow]] became the new High Captain.

As of [[1483 DR]], thugs from Ship Rethnor demanded tolls from any who wished to cross the crumbling [[Upstream Span]].{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle||26-27}}

Sometime before the [[1489 DR|Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR]], Hartouchen became the High Captain and took Rethnor as his surname.
