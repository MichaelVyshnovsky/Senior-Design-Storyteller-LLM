        "mainbody": "Clan Daardendrien was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther.\nMembers of Clan Daardendrien used six bone or ivory studs on the left side of their faces as their distinctive clan piercings. Their coat of arms were six white circles on a black background.\nClan Daardendrien was renowned for the martial prowess of its members. Members of this clan were trained to be able to fight with or without weapons. This and their excessive focus on the martial virtues make common people compare them to Chessentans.\nClan Daardendrien was one of the few Tymantheran clans that allowed among its members followers of the gods, as the clan elders considered the mystical abilities of users of divine magic to be useful. Because of that, they were looked down by other, more traditionalist clans.\nIn 1479 DR, members of Clan Daardendrien were among the heroes that stopped Brimstones xorvintaal, an ash giant invasion of Tymanther, and a potential war with Chessenta, raising the status of the clan in Thymari society. They were allies in good standing of the Brotherhood of the Griffon mercenary group, and the official guardians of the Platinum Cadre.\nAs of 1487 DR, Clan Daardendrien was the most renowned Thymari clan in many nations across Faer√ªn.\n* Daardendrien Turan, the clan elder as of 1487 DR (see notes).\n* Daardendrien Medrash, a national Thymari hero and the scion of the clan in 1487 DR.\n* Daardendrien Balasar, another Daardendrien hero.\n* Daardendrien Nijana, a survivor of the First Tymanther-Unther War."
