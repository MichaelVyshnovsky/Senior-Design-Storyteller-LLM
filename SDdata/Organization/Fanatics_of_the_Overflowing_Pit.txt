The Fanatics of the Overflowing Pit were an elite order of drow Ghaunadauran crusaders.
This organization waged warfare on the clergies of rival faiths.
In the 14 century DR this organization was based in the city of Llurth Dreier, where they made up part of the citys armed forces.
This crusader organization traced its origins back to the Ilythiir, when that empire was at its height. Following the fall of Ilythiir and the drow races exile into the Underdark by the Seldarine, an event known as the "Descent of the Drow", the organization went silent.
The organization was long rumored to still survive in the city of Llurth Dreier, in the conflict known as the Webfire Wars. Following the end of that conflict, the organization would continue to operate in the southern Underdark for millennia.
