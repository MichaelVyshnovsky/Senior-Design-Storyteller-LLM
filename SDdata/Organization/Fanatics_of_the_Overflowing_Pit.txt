The '''Fanatics of the Overflowing Pit''' were an elite order of [[drow]] [[Church of Ghaunadaur|Ghaunadauran]] [[crusader]]s.

==Activities==
This organization waged warfare on the clergies of rival faiths.

==Base of Operations==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] this organization was based in the city of [[Llurth Dreier]], where they made up part of the city's armed forces.

==History==
This crusader organization traced its origins back to the [[Ilythiir]], when that empire was at its height. Following the fall of Ilythiir and the drow race's exile into the [[Underdark]] by the [[Seldarine]], an event known as the "Descent of the Drow", the organization went silent.

The organization was long rumored to still survive in the city of Llurth Dreier, in the conflict known as the [[Webfire Wars]]. Following the end of that conflict, the organization would continue to operate in the southern Underdark for millennia.
