        "mainbody": "The Bear-Tooth tribe was barbarian tribe, led by its shaman, Leustrarax, active sometime before 1372 DR.\nThe Bear-Tooth tribe was led by Leustrarax, its shaman, who successfully fought off a knight who tried to expand his fiefdom into the tribes territory. A set of enchanted armor called the Deep Dark Red was pulled off the defeated knights body. Sometime soon, the Bear-Tooth tribes village was attacked by the Bloody Tusk orcish tribe. The Bear-Tooth warriors managed to repel a series of onslaughts and pushed the orcs back into the caverns where the Bloody Tusks emerged from. Donning Deep Dark Red for its enchantments that allowed the wearer to see in the dark, Leustrarax ventured into the caves, eventually tracking down and assassinating the orc chieftain with a single poisoned arrow.\nSometime later, the barbarians unsuccessfully attacked a well-guarded merchant caravan, losing Deep Dark Red in the process."
