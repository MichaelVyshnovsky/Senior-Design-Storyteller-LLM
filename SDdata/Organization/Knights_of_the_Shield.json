        "mainbody": "The '''Knights of the Shield''' were a group of information dealers and political manipulators that operated within the [[Sword Coast]], [[Lands of Intrigue]] and, to a lesser extent [[the North]], for over a thousand years, dating back before [[Dale Reckoning]]. \n\nWhile on the surface they appeared to be a secret society of merchants and nobles who were interested in the mercantile and civic matters of their respective lands, their high leadership were in fact guardians of a secret in service to the [[archdevil]]-turned-[[deity]], [[Gargauth]]. This was a secret to the citizens of [[Faerûn]] who knew of their existence, as well as most of their membership.",
        "Areas of influence": "Though they were based primarily in [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]], the realm of influence of the Knights reached from [[Calimshan]] to [[Waterdeep]]. They had little influence in the ''City of Splendors'' however, thanks to a failed coup against the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].",
        "Activities": "Since the disappearance of the ''[[Shield of Silvam]]'', the \"knights\" of the organization would have their agents gather vital and valuable information from throughout [[West Faerûn|western Faerûn]] and share it amongst one another. For many years they used this knowledge in mercantile practice, making wise financial investments and political connections to become richer and more powerful than the rest of the aristocracy in their respective cities. After the establishment of the [[Shield Council]] they used their network of spies and informants to manipulate and influence social, economical and military developments across the west as they saw them arise. Of course these machinations still benefited the members of the Shield in great measure.\n\nWhile most of the Knights of the Shield believed their ultimate aim was the accumulation of wealth and influence, they were mistaken. The most senior-ranking members of the council served the whims of Gargauth, the god of betrayal and political corruption.\n\nThe Knights of the Shield minted their own coin, appropriately enough in the ''[[Athkatla|City of Coins]]'' as was common among guilds in [[Lands of Intrigue|the South]]. It was the same size as normal currency but was a particularly dense, [[gold]] coin, three times the weight of others.\n\n{{sectstub}}",
        "Organization": {
            "Hierarchy": "The hierarchy of the Knights of the Shield serving under the council was a loose collection of members, agents and hirelings. Seeing as how their members were well-seperated by geography and culture they rarely collected in meetings larger than six. Old bylaws dictated that any given member could reveal their membership within the network to no more than three individuals, regardless of their identity or allegiance."
        },
        "History": "The Knights of the Shield were originally founded in the time of the [[Tyrant Eye Wars]] in {{Yearlink|-170}} by a gathering exceptional minds to defend the kingdom of Tethyr; they adopted this name from the [[artifact]], the ''Shield of Silvam'', a magic [[artifact]] supposedly created by the [[wizard]] [[Zhyra Bardson-Ithal]].\n\nA decisive factor emerged in the {{YearlinkName|889}} when the [[Duke]] [[Tithkar Illehhune]] entered in the Knights of the Shield. He brought with him a mystical shield known as the ''[[Shield of the Hidden Lord]]'', which he claimed was a [[divine]] gift that heralded the group's return to glory and prominence throughout the Realms. Duke Illehhune and the allies he quickly made within the organization instituted the Shield Council, an even-more-secret cabal tasked with further increasing the power of the order.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1235}}, the Shield had a hand in the defeat of the [[Black Horde]]\n\nDespite their usual discretion, the Knights of the Shield did manage to raise their own mercenary in {{YearlinkName|1356}} to march against the forces of [[Dragonspear Castle]], disrupting trade throughout the region. When the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] manage to rally the [[Amn]]ian army, the Knights turned their forces over to the military's leadership.\n\nDuring the [[Reclamation Wars]] of Tethyr in the late 1360s, they heavily influenced trade policy and even aided in [[Zaranda Star]] claiming the throne of [[Darromar]].",
        "Relationships": "In order to carry out their various political machinations, the Knights of the Shield groomed their own militaristic enforcers known as [[vengeance knight]]s. Using various bits of misinformation while clouding their own identity, the Knights presented themselves to their zealous warriors as benevolent patrons.\n\nEach agent of the Knights of the Shield employed a number of vengeance knights at their disposal. Referred to as a 'patron' each Knight acted as a sort of mentor to their warrior-enforcers."
