century DR
The Free Space Alliance was a military cooperation between the spacefaring races of Realmspace, Greyspace, and Krynnspace, formed in the mid‒14 century DR as a defense against the threat of invasion by the Vodoni Empire during the War of the Spheres.
The Alliance led an attack into Vodonispace in order to counter their offensive and defeat their leader, Vulkaran.
The first meeting of the Alliance took place in the Rock of Bral in the Tears of Selûne. Subsequent meetings were organized aboard the flagship of the Alliance fleet, the armada Arrow of Justice, commanded by admiral Icarus of Realmspace.
The Free Space Alliance was led by the Arrow of Justice. Its forces included large contingents of humans, elves, dwarves, and gnomes, as well as smaller numbers of mind flayers, beholders, lizardfolk, ogres, and, initially, neogi.
In the late stages of the war, the neogi switched sides and turned against the Alliance.
