        "mainbody": "he Knights of the Vigil was an order of Helmite knights that were tasked with the oversight and maintenance of Watchers Keep, a powerful mortal prison designed to imprison evil beings at behest of Helm himself.\nThe sole purpose of the Vigil was to ensure that the Imprisoned One was sealed away deep beneath Watchers Keep. The supremely evil being was never to be freed, lest it bring chaos and destruction upon the world, nor slain, as it would be released from bondage and returned to its domain in the Abyss.\nThe knights were dedicated to the preservation of Watchers Keep in western Tethyr. While the topmost level of the keep was a dedicated temple to Helm, it was unknown if that is where the knights kept their residence.\nUnlike other well-known Helmite orders, such as the Vigilant Eyes of the God or the Watchers over the Fallen, the Knights of the vigil were rather secretive in nature.\nThe order was founded during the Time of Troubles, in the . When the avatars of the Faerûnian pantheon were set to walk the Realms of Faerûn, the magical wards found deep within the keep began to falter.\nAs Helm was the only being to retain his divinity at that time, he called upon a group of his knights and swore them to an oath that designated their role as guardians of Watchers Keep, and the Imprisoned One trapped within. The knights had to perform a specific ritual every so often, sacrificing their lives in order to maintain the keeps wards and prevent the Imprisoned One from wreaking havoc across Toril.\nThe knights dedication to their oath waned over the next decade. In the , the knights leader Odren chose not to continue with their tradition, and deceptively called out for any adventurers who were willing to perform the ritual in their stead. He and his knights gave no inclination about the sacrifice needed to perform the ritual, and concocted a flimsy story about how his order were too weak to defeat the horrors that overran the keeps upper levels.\nThe group comprised various knights, clerics, and even mages dedicated to the worship and dogma of Helm."
