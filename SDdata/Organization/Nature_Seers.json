Their domain was the [[Grove of Renewal]], located deep beneath the surface of the planet,{{Cite web enhancement/A Druid's Grove|5}} though they each had domains in locations related to their trials, spread out across all the Realms.{{Cite web enhancement/A Druid's Grove|6}} Those mortals who sought out these elemental [[druid]]s within their groves were presented with a series of challenges known as the [[Purging]], which would allow them to understand their history, know their place in the balance of the world, and prepare for a new future.\n\nA number of rumors surrounded the druids and their grove and had spread across the realms. One purported that [[Silvanus]] had exiled them beneath the earth after one of their members angered the god, while others stated that the magic of the grove had faded or that evil cult members had taken over the natural holy site.{{Cite web enhancement/A Druid's Grove|3}}\n\n{{Quote|''\"The Mother shall tire of her children's profanities and shall spew forth her fire upon the land to cleanse and renew it. On that day, the Nature Seers shall enact their final purging.\"''|A prophecy regarding the Nature Seers}}",
