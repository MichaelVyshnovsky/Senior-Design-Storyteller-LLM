The '''Everlasting''', or the '''Brotherhood of the Everlasting''', was perhaps the largest group of [[holy slayer]]s in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

The symbol of the Everlasting was a golden scimitar.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|25}}

==Activities==
Through an agreement with the [[Grey Fire]], the territories of the Everlasting included the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]], [[Qudra]], [[Hiyal]], [[Hilm]], and [[Talab]].

It was not unheard of for either the Grey Fire or the Everlasting to operate outside of their territories by using the other's spy networks.

==Members==
The Everlasting was ruled by the "Grandfather" who, in 1367 DR, was [[Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali]].

==Factions==
Known factions within the Everlasting included:
* [[Loyalists]]
* [[Preachers]]
* [[Unclean (Zakhara)|Unclean]]
* [[Sword Dancers]]
* [[Winged Bulls]]
