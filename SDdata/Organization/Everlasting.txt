The Everlasting, or the Brotherhood of the Everlasting, was perhaps the largest group of holy slayers in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The symbol of the Everlasting was a golden scimitar.
Through an agreement with the Grey Fire, the territories of the Everlasting included the Free Cities of Zakhara, Qudra, Hiyal, Hilm, and Talab.
It was not unheard of for either the Grey Fire or the Everlasting to operate outside of their territories by using the others spy networks.
The Everlasting was ruled by the "Grandfather" who, in 1367 DR, was Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali.
Known factions within the Everlasting included
* Loyalists
* Preachers
* Unclean
* Sword Dancers
* Winged Bulls
