'''Clan Brightblade''' was a [[dwarven]] clan that had resided in [[Daggerdale]] since before the founding of the [[human]] settlement of [[Dagger Falls]].

==Organization==
The clan was led by its chieftain in most matters but the chief priest of [[Dumathoin]] also carried a great deal of authority in the clan. The degree to which their instructions were respected was evidenced when they commanded the rest of their clan to flee Eagles' Eyrie when it was attacked by Mage-Lord Colderan Morn.

==Activities==
In Anathar's Dell, the clan had extensive [[silver]] mines that they still worked as of [[1370 DR]].

==Tactics==
The dwarves made ingenious [[trap]]s to keep intruders away from their holdings and were highly adept at concealing their entrances.

==Base of Operations==
For the most part, Clan Brightblade was based in [[Anathar's Dell]] in southern Daggerdale.

==Possessions==
The Brightblade dwarves were famed for their craftsmanship of jewels and had reputedly crafted a piece of such quality that it caused a dispute between them and the Morn family.

Before their defeat at the hands of Colderan Morn, the clan leader, [[Dorn the Grim]], and the chief priest, [[Elshar Kurl]], crafted the [[magic]] [[short sword]], ''[[Olar]]'', to defeat the mage-lord. The blade still lay in the hands of Dorn the Grim as of 1367 DR.

==Relationships==
In the early history of Dagger Falls, the dwarves had a fine relationship with the humans that settled the small trading post near Eagle's Eyrie until sometime in or before 1267 DR when they fell into a great dispute with the tyrannical mage-lord, Colderan Morn, over a perceived slight against his wife, Belesaria. This resulted in the dwarves being driven out of that part of the dale and the beginning of a feud between the [[Morn]] family and Brightblade dwarves. The blood feud was still evident as late as [[1372 DR]], even after [[Randal Morn]]'s reclamation of the Dale from the [[Zhentarim]].

In southern Daggerdale, the Brightblade dwarves came to an arrangement with the [[wizard]] [[Anathar]], who wished to build a tower where the later [[Anathar's Hall]] was situated.

==History==
Since the fall of [[Tethyamar]] in the {{yearlinkName|1104}}, when Dorn the Grim's kinsman [[Belgin]] died and the dwarves were driven out,{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale|6}} They eventually made a home for themselves in nearby Daggerdale, where they could mine silver in Anathar's Dell and trade goods at Eagles' Eyrie.

At some point, a wizard named Anathar came to the southern holdings of the Brightblade.

However, one cold day in autumn in or before [[1267 DR]],This is "At least 100 years ago" on page 32 of ''Doom of Daggerdale'', which has a date of 1367 DR. the Brightblades' peace with the Morn family came to an abrupt end when the dwarves refused to sell a prized jewel to [[Belesaria Morn]], the proud wife of Mage-Lord [[Colderan Morn]]. Vengeful, Belesaria returned to her husband and told him that they had spurned and insulted her, and this drove the tyrannical mage-lord into a fit of rage. Colderan returned to the Brightblade dwarves and demanded that they grant him an enormous tribute of [[gold]] and forged [[steel]] as an apology, otherwise he would place a dire curse upon them. Although the dwarves stubbornly refused to give in to Colderan's demands, they were well aware of his magical might. Therefore, the leaders of the clan, Chieftain Dorn the Grim and Head Priest Elshar Kurl, devised a plan to delay the mage-lord while the rest of their kin escaped towards the [[Mines of Tethyamar]]. Together they forged the magical short sword ''Olar'' and made their last stand at Eagles' Eyrie. Despite their efforts however, Colderan managed to slay the champions and plundered Eagles' Eyrie, though not before the bulk of their kin escaped.

Afterward, Clan Brightblade was all but driven out of Daggerdale and swore an oath of enmity against the Morn family, which was still enforced even as late as [[1372 DR]].

By [[1480 DR]], the Brightblade clan still worked the mines of Anathar's Dell and had even begun gathering in larger numbers to reclaim Tethyamar again.{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale|5}}
