        "mainbody": "he Graycloaks was the militia that protected the city of Neverwinter in the 14 century DR.\nThe Graycloaks earned their name from the grey cloaks they wore, as they didnt have the funds to afford proper uniforms.\nThe Graycloaks had 400 members, a mounted force of archers and spearmen, although they were trained in the use of other weapons.\nIn peacetime, 60 Greycloaks always acted as Neverwinters police force while 60 of them were on leave and another 60 were re-training.\nThe Graycloaks had two garrisons, at the northeastern and southeastern gates.\nBesides their arms and grey cloaks, the militia had the blastglobes made by the Many-Starred Cloak wizards, although they used such magic items only in times of need.\nAfter the short but brutal war between Neverwinter and Luskan of the  and the Shadow War of the , Neverwinters wealth was grained, and the regions economy teetering on the edge of collapse. In these dire circumstances, the Graycloaks of Neverwinter were left poorly funded and equipped. Some members of the militia were not equipped even with the simplest grey-dyed cloth armor due to the lack of funds, but even then, they wore the titular grey cloaks. During that period of time, most Greycloaks were civilian-soldiers who received poor training, while veterans of the two wars held higher ranks in the organization. But by mid-1370s DR, the Graycloaks financing was slowly recovering with the aid of the regions economy being rebuilt with the aid of several mercantile groups of Neverwinter, including the Mercantile House of merchant princess SaSani.\nThe Graycloaks were disbanded after the destruction of Neverwinter.\nThe Graycloaks faction of the Sons of Alagondar got their name from the milita."
