They were esteemed for saving the lives of soldiers who would otherwise have died if they hadnt received medical treatment or divine healing.\nEach of the groups members possessed a vast knowledge of battlefield healing and were skilled casters in combat. They had the fortitude to survive a number of attacks in battle while tending to the wounds of a fallen comrade."
