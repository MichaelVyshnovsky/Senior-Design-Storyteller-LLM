Indesm was a noble house of Cormyr.
They were situated in Arabel.
The Indesms owned the hold of Hawkhar, which lay north-east of the Wyvernwater and northwest of Firefall Vale.
The Indesms supported the Lost King Gondegal in his brief insurrection in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR.
Following the death of King Azoun IV during the Abraxus affair, the Indesm family preferred to have Vangerdahast as regent, rather government by a ruling council, as did many families with country estates.
