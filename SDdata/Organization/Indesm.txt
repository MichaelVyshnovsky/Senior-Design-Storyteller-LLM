'''Indesm''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]].

==Bases==
They were situated in [[Arabel]].

The Indesms owned the hold of [[Hawkhar]], which lay north-east of the Wyvernwater and northwest of [[Firefall Vale]].<ref>

==History==
The Indesms supported the Lost King [[Gondegal]] in his brief insurrection in the [[1352 DR|Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR]].

Following the death of King [[Azoun IV]] during the [[Abraxus affair]], the Indesm family preferred to have [[Vangerdahast]] as regent, rather government by a ruling council, as did many families with country estates.
