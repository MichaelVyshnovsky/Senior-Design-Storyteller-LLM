Ship Suljack was one of the five factions of Luskan ruled by a High Captain. It was named for and originally led by Suljack.
Ship Suljack was allied with Ship Rethnor in 1376 DR.
Ship Suljack was the only Ship represented when Captain Deudermont proclaimed his plan for the new city of Luskan in 1376 DR. Suljack was killed by Athrogate, by the order of High Captain Kensidian of Ship Rethnor, soon after.
Circa 1490 DR, pirates of Ship Suljack were involved in smuggling of a highly addictive and illegal substance known as the travelers dust. The substance was considered dangerous contraband even in relatively lawless places, like Luskan. Thoradin was involved in the smuggling operation for Ship Suljack.
