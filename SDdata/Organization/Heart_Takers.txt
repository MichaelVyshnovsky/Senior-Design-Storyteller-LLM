The '''Heart Takers''' were a tribe of [[orc]]s that dwelled within the [[Rauvin Mountains]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Heart Takers earned their name from the ceremonial sacrifices they made in the name of the orc deity [[Gruumsh]]. They regularly cut out, cooked, and ate the hearts of animals and foes.

==Base of Operations==
The tribe dwelled within the eastern peaks of the Rauvins, somewhat nearest to the [[Tornskulls]].

==Relationships==
The tribe considered the nearby [[Red Fangs]] tribe to be their rivals. Conversely, they truly feared the Tornskull orcs, due to their great numbers and ferocity in battle.

==Rumors & Legends==
[[Dead Orc Pass]] was so named for a great battle that took place between the Heart Takers and Tornskulls tribes.
