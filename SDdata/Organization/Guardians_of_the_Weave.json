        "mainbody": "e organization was founded in [[1372 DR]] by [[Aluvauna Thornym]] of [[Waterdeep]], and concerned agents of Mystra. After she encountered a [[Zhentarim]] mage who was wielding magic sourced from the Shadow Weave, she gathered some of her friends, voiced her concerns about this new threat and agreed they must form a group dedicated to the protection of [[raw magic]]. She pulled some strings, and gained an official sanction from the church of Mystra, and swiftly garnered the support of churches of allied and [[good]]-aligned faiths. \n\nEventually they had rallied representatives from the [[church of Azuth|churches of Azuth]], [[Deneir]], [[Isis]], [[Savras]], [[Selûne]], who hailed from as far away as [[Halruaa]]. [[Elven]] and [[gnome]] spellcasters who worshiped their respective deities of [[arcane magic]]. Aluvauna took command of the group and designated them lieutenants of the organization, to serve in their home cities assisted by a Guardian.\n\nThe Guardians expanded rapidly and were fairly well-known to the public, but experienced some growing pains. It was a vast network of allies from a variety of cultures, who spoke a multitude of languages and had an only recently established hierarchy. While they operated in relative stability, there were worries about spies having infiltrated their ranks.\n\nThe group had their largest meeting in [[1373 DR]], during which thirty members were in attendance. The other allies of the network were out on missions throughout [[Faerûn]].",
        "Attitude": "Above all, the Guardians believed in the power and beauty of the Weave, that it was more important than life itself.\n\nThey were of the shared opinion that the greatest threat to the Weave was the [[church of Shar]], their revered [[Shar|goddess]] and the [[Shadow Weave]] itself. They believed the Mistress of the Night and her followers were scheming to challenge Mystra and completely devour the Weave.",
        "Activities": "The actions taken by the members of the alliance varied somewhat, depending on the individual. Some would stay in their home realm, while others would venture far and wide, but all remained vigilant for rumors or news that suggested the harming of the Weave, or the wielding of the Shadow Weave. They readily worked together as needed, as they saw the practice of [[the Art]] as a bond between brothers and sisters of Toril.\n\nThey were wise enough to realize they had to know their enemies if they truly wanted to defeat them. They studied the common practices of evil spellcasters, along with their casting techniques, and systematically recorded [[dead-magic zone]]s and areas of [[wild magic]]. They regularly led expeditions into subterranean ruins and tombs in search of potentially destructive [[artifact]]s and [[relic]]s in an effort to lock them away.",
        "Members": "All manner of [[mage]]s from every corner of Faerûn joined the ranks of the Guardians. Aluvauna was quite progressive in her recruitment methods, as the Guardians sought to bring in more anodyne [[necromancer]]s of [[Velsharoon]] and [[Thay]]an wizards who sought new magic for the sake of knowledge, rather than power. This open ideology gave them access to information and agents that were otherwise unavailable to most. \n\nDue to their continuous operations, members typically never met many of their fellow Guardians.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Allies": "First and foremost among the allies of the Guardians were the clergies of [[Mystra]] and [[Azuth]]. They had an amiable relationship with the [[good]]-aligned [[magic domain]] deities of the [[Seldarine]] and the [[Lords of the Golden Hills]]. The [[church of Torm|churches of Torm]] and [[church of Kelemvor|Kelemvor]] had strong respect for the group because of their efforts to make Faerûn safe from [[wild magic]] and evil [[necromancer]]s.\n\nTheir role as protectors of magic on Faerûn, along with their ties to [[church of Mystra|Mystra's church]], made it easy for the Guardians to form strong ties with the [[Lords' Alliance]] of [[the North]] and the altruists within the [[Harpers]] and [[Moonstars]] and the reformed peacekeepers in the [[Covenant]].",
            "Foes": "The enemies of the Guardians were numerous, and overarching across the face of Faerûn. The power-hungry [[Zhentarim]], magic-exploiting [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]], and perverse followers of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] were among some of their more established adversaries. Of course, there were many smaller cabals and independent evil mages whose operations the Guardians sought out and shut down.\n\nFirst and foremost, their foes were the [[Shadovar]] [[wizard]]s of returned [[Netheril]], whose existence and [[shadow adept|adepts]] were infused with the corruption of Shar and Shadow Weave. While the Guardians had orders to apprehend any solitary wizards who were known to wield the Shadow Weave, the agents of Netheril rarely, if ever, openly struck out against their number."
