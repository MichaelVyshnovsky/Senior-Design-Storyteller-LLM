Burntbone Horde was a bandit group active along the roads around Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
The Horde attacked travelers along the roads between Waterdeep, Sharpstone Keep, and Frostsilver Mines. They also engaged in treasure hunting efforts at the Frostsilver Mines.
The Burntbone Horde was based out of Sharpstone Keep near Waterdeep, and retreated there when they encountered resistance along the roads. After being driven from the Keep by adventurers, they fled to Frostsilver Mines.
They may have had a relationship with Kurgaloth, a pit fiend who leveraged an infernal contract with the Lightfinger family of Waterdeep to distract the city from the Hordes base in Sharpstone Keep in order to undermine the citys security.
The brazenness of the Burntbone Horde spurred Open Lord Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep to recruit adventurers directly in order to clean up the problem. The adventurers quickly drove the Horde back to Sharpstone Keep, where they also defeated the Hordes leaders before pursuing the stragglers to Frostsilver Mine. There, the Horde was searching for treasure, but was stymied by a skeleton known as "The Bonebreaker". After the adventurers encountered and destroyed the skeleton, the Horde began a mad dash deeper into the Mines in search of treasure, particularly Frostsilver armor said to have been blessed by Dumathoin. This led to a race with the adventurers, which the adventurers ultimately won.
The surviving members of the Horde made their way to Harvestshield Mountain and joined Mrolgyets Legion.
The Horde was composed of goblins, kobolds, ogres, and orcs, and their ranks boasted many shamans and spellcasters. The self-styled ruler of the Horde was Harkald Firesworn, a fire giant, and below him were leaders including the ogre Vargor the Fierce and the orc Smasheye.
