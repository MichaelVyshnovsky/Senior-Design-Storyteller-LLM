Spysong was a scouting organization that collected information about threats to the kingdom of Damara.
In the 14 Century DR, Spysong operated throughout the Bloodstone Lands on behalf of King Gareth Dragonsbane of Damara.
As of 1480 DR, Spysong was headed by Riordan Parnell and based out of the Cave of the Whispering Wind in the Galena Mountains. The organization was still active throughout Damara and Vaasa, but had become dedicated to undermining and overthrowing the current King of Damara, Yarin Frostmantle, who they believed to have been behind the death of Queen Brianne Dragonsbane.
*Kane, who handled the long-range missions by way of his carpet of flying and spirit walking ability.
*Celedon Kierney, who kept a close watch on the Grandfather of Assassins.
*Riordan Parnell, who with the help of some fifteen bards around Vaasa and Damara, coded important messages for Gareth into songs. Riordan also had a mobile strike force of a hundred fighters under his exclusive command, including twenty centaur cavalrymen.
There were also a number of rangers who kept a close eye on and protected these three important leaders as much as they could when they were out on the land.
