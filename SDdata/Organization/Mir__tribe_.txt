The '''Mir''' were a tribe of horsemen around the [[Tun Marshes]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The land claimed by the Mir surrounded the Tun Marshes in the [[Tunlands]] of [[Cormyr]]. Their resistance to rule put the Mir into conflict with both the [[Purple Dragons]] and [[Zhentarim]] of nearby [[Darkhold]].

==Organization==
The tribe was lead by Tralmir [[Numac]] during this time period.
