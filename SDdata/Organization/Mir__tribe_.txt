The Mir were a tribe of horsemen around the Tun Marshes during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The land claimed by the Mir surrounded the Tun Marshes in the Tunlands of Cormyr. Their resistance to rule put the Mir into conflict with both the Purple Dragons and Zhentarim of nearby Darkhold.
The tribe was lead by Tralmir Numac during this time period.
