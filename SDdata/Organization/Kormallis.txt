The '''Kormallis''' ({{Pronounce|KOR|mal|eess|ref=}}) family were part of the [[nobility of Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They recruited people for mercenary work or other jobs that required [[adventurer]]-types. They also had an interest in supplying travel-related gear to folks on the move. Sometime in the darker part of their history, they dabbled in the [[Slavery|slave]] trade.

==Organization==
Lord [[Helm Kormallis]] (nicknamed "The Torturer") was the patriarch of the family from at least the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, If Harkas renounced the title, it would then fall to Helm's younger brother [[Pall Kormallis|Pall]].

As of the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the seneschal of the estate was secretly a refugee of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] and his son, [[Felvor Elcaskur]], was a Scion (priest) of [[Siamorphe]].

==Base of Operations==

The Kormallis family had a villa in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] at the southeast corner of [[Hassantyr's Street]] and [[Ussilbran Street]]. It consisted of a few one- and two-story buildings inside a walled compound. [[Endcliff Lane]] touched the back side of the property.

==History==
House Kormallis was involved in slave trading in the first half of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], before they were ennobled. In the {{YearlinkName|1248}}, when over two dozen families were inducted into the nobility, the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] required them to renounce slavery as part of the process. When the Kormallis family was elevated to the nobility in the {{YearlinkName|1258}}, they publicly declared they had ceased slave trafficking, but did not completely abandon the illegal practice until the {{YearlinkName|1273}}.
