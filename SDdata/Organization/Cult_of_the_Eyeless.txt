The '''Cult of the Eyeless''' was a [[beholder]] cult active in [[Athkatla]] in around [[1369 DR]] and in the city or [[Berdusk]] sometime before [[1312 DR]].

==Description==
Outwardly, its blind priests preached that all the gods were fakes, and that the only true one was the [[Unseeing Eye]], whom the cult served. This helped it gain some followers among ordinary people who were disillusioned with the gods. In actual fact, the Unseeing Eye was a blind but immensely powerful [[beholder]], who used the cult in its search for the second half of the [[Planar rift device|Rift Device]], an artifact of such great destructive power that the gods themselves had hidden it to prevent anyone from using it.<ref>
