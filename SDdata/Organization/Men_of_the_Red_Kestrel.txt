The '''Men of the Red Kestrel''' were a group of stalwart adventurers, active ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

==History==
In 1358 DR, the Men of the Red Kestrel sought a way through the [[Great Glacier]] to the east from the [[Bloodstone Lands]]. When they arrived at the village of [[Sundice]], they shared stories of encountering [[dwarves]], frozen within the Great Glacier. These mysterious dwarves wore exquisitely crafted sets of armor and weapons, unseen within the Realms of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The adventurers brought two of these pieces of rare weaponry along from the trip across the Glacier, a [[long sword]] and a [[warhammer]] of great quality.

Both items were bought by [[Eldaerim]] of [[Sossal]], who decided to become a sponsor for the Men of the Red Kestrel's next foray into the Great Glacier.
