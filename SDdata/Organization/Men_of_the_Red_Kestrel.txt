The Men of the Red Kestrel were a group of stalwart adventurers, active circa 1358 DR.
In 1358 DR, the Men of the Red Kestrel sought a way through the Great Glacier to the east from the Bloodstone Lands. When they arrived at the village of Sundice, they shared stories of encountering dwarves, frozen within the Great Glacier. These mysterious dwarves wore exquisitely crafted sets of armor and weapons, unseen within the Realms of the 14 century DR. The adventurers brought two of these pieces of rare weaponry along from the trip across the Glacier, a long sword and a warhammer of great quality.
Both items were bought by Eldaerim of Sossal, who decided to become a sponsor for the Men of the Red Kestrels next foray into the Great Glacier.
