House Lurian was a noble family of the city of Procampur in the Vast. They were an ancient and highly respected house famed for their talented goldsmiths.
The Lurian goldsmiths were reputed to be able to design and craft any item of the specified weight, size, and shape to perfection and with intricate detail. In their designs for various utensils and other items fashioned from gold or silver, the Lurians were without peer.
Once, House Lurian and House Kailin were the closest of allies and they collaborated regularly on creating works of art of the highest quality. However, following a contest to determine the best goldsmith in the city, which the Kailins lost, a surprise argument and jealousy led to a feud that had lasted for some three decades as of 1370 DR. In this time, the families did not communicate, let alone work with one another, though Lord Consul Povalo and others of his family made frequent and indeed heroic attempts to rebuild relations.
House Lurian purchased much of the output of House Eisners mines, keeping that family in business.
The Lurians were on favorable terms with House Hannith and on less favorable terms with House Steen. As an older house, the Lurians were among those that despised Houses Allison and Reilly for their swift rise and ennoblement.
They had a house in the Nobles District of the city.
