        "mainbody": "he House of Al-Cinel was one of the richest merchant families in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThe House of Al-Cinel was based out of the Warehouse District of Huzuz.\nThe House of Al-Cinel specialized in procuring larger rare items including statues, fountains, and tapestries.\nThis merchant family was able to acquire a Halruaan skyship. They kept it locked away within a warehouse where only members of the family were allowed to enter. Two elven mages worked tirelessly to determine how the ship was able to achieve flight, though since they lacked the necessary control rod, their efforts were probably in vain."
