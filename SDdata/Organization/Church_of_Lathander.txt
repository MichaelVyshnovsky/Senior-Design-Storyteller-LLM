The Church of Lathander was an organization that comprised the collective practitioners of the faith surrounding Lathander the Morninglord. It was among the most well-respected, Lathanders church languished for decades following the Morninglords apparent "death", and true to his divine domain of rebirth, was restored following the conclusion of the Era of Upheaval.
The Lathanderian faith held no singular authority over the faith or hierarchy that bound individual churches to one another. Each priest held sole jurisdiction over their own temple, shrine, or congregation, regardless of their rank or title within the church.
Heads of Lathanders temples occasionally met at conferences whenever issues affecting the church at large had to be addressed.
Titles within the church included (in descending order) Sunrise Lord, High Mornmaster, Mornmaster, High Morninglord, Morninglord, Dawnmaster, High Dawnlord, Dawnlord, Dawngreeter, Dawnbringer, and Awakened for novitiates. Despite the numerous titles, Lathanderian clergy commonly referred to one another as "Dawnbringer" or "Dawn Priest". 
In old Athalantar, clergy members were referred to as "Lights of Lathander".
It was customary for priests to take on a new name for themselves, as revealed to them by Lathander. This act symbolized their "rebirth" as an official member of the clergy. 
Within the greater church was a faction that believed Lathander was in fact the reincarnation of the Netherese god Amaunator. This divine theory led to the rise of the Risen Sun heresy, the belief that Lathander would transform into a resurrected Amaunator within a matter of years.
Yet others subscribed to the Three-Faced Sun heresy, that the sun itself was trisected overdeity—that comprised the three aspects of dawn, highsun, and dusk—only two of which could be witnessed by mortals at any given time. To these individuals, Lathander supplanted Amaunator as the aspect of dawn and became dominant over highsun and dusk. Opinions differed on whether Lathander or another deity would ascend as the aspect of highsun, and what would become of the aspect of dawn.

Followers of Lathander were directed to provide aid unto others and foster innovation to better the lives of folks in the Realms. They cultivated lands that were otherwise barren, culled monstrous creatures to make way for new settlements, fought off the forces of evil, and imparted civilized ideals to discordant locales. Lathanderians offered much assistance to adventurers, pilgrims, or others that traveled across the Realms. They made efforts to recover long-lost relics, magic items, or creative works such as literature or art in order to further their own innovative endeavors.
Priests offered a wide variety of services to their parishioners, including marriages, birthings, funerary services,  and even public announcements of new public works projects.
Lathanderian temples often sponsored non-combative athletic events, such as wrestling, archery, riding, running, swimming, and the like. They also honored creative competition in the arts, including the arts such as literature. More often, local clergy hosted grand revels for forward-thinking scholars and intellectuals, in order to stimulate their creativity and inspire new ideas that would further advance culture and civilization across Faerûn.
Priests of Lathander often concerned themselves with new business ventures, offering loans to business people seeking more startup capital than their neighborhood moneylender could offer. Some of them took this entrepreneurial spirit even further, becoming investors, merchants, and financial brokers for their own personal enrichment. They were often viewed as overly enthusiastic hucksters. Yet other priests chose to propagate more humanistic unions, serving as matchmakers to prospective lovers that had yet to find their partners. 
Befitting Lathanders title of Morninglord, rituals, ceremonies, and daily prayers led by his clergy were held at dawn each day. Formal unions such as official contracts or marriages held during that time were considered especially blessed. An additional prayer to Lathander was held by some temples at highsun each day, and were considered a solemn but joyous rite of the faith. A ceremony known as the Going Down was performed at funerals, which were always held at dusk.
Lathanders faithful often invoked Lathanders blessing before setting out on long travels or embarking upon new ventures.
The Song of the Morning, or Song of Dawn, was sung in Lathanderian temples on certain days throughout the year, notably on the mornings of Midsummer and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. The elegant song honored Lathander with an intricate combination of choral harmonies.
The holiday of Rhyestertide celebrated in Waterdeep was held in honor of Rhyester, Lathanders first prophet.
Another Waterdhavian festival called Sornyn was observed by both the Lathanderian and Waukeenar clergies of the city. It was a blessed occasion to forge new business agreements, formalize pacts and contracts, build relations with foreign entities, and interestingly enough, overindulge in wine and other drink.
In Mulmaster, Lathanderians celebrated the Festival of Fiery Night, a night-long revel that was to many little more than an excuse to get exceedingly drunk.
Initiates and other clergy of the Lathanderian faith were granted immediate use of magical spells that involved the creation or manipulation of light. crusaders of Lathander were notably not granted this ability.
Worship of Lathander was prevalent or influential throughout the Western and Eastern Heartlands. The faith was especially concentrated in certain regions including Chessenta, Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Lake of Steam region, the Moonshaes, the North, Samarach, Sembia, the Silver Marches, the Sword Coast, including Waterdeep, and the greater Western Heartlands.
The faith was so widespread that at least one priest of Lathander was took residence in the distinctly chaotic town of Haven on the plane of Mechanus.

The churchs clergy were specialty priests were known as morninglords, which comprised just over one third of its clergy. Some of the faith even took up some of the most dangerous occupations among the adventuring types, namely as exorcists or fiend hunters.

Despite the popularity of the Lathanderian faith at the time, the church itself was faced with a ever-growing divide. Daelegoth Orndeir of Elversult began giving sermons that declared Lathander was actually the restored god Amaunator, who would soon reveal his true nature. Belief in the Risen Sun began to grow increasingly popular and Amaunatori sunlords were regularly offered support by the church. By Ches of the , the influential Tower of Morning in Telpir proclaimed support for the new Risen Sun belief offering it credence by one of the Morninglords most grand temples. Within months belief of the Risen Sun had spread as far away as Sembia and clergy of Saerb that did not subscribe to the Risen Sun were exiled from their community.
After Daelegoth performed a miracle to spare his city from the disastrous effects of the melting of the High Ice, his brand of Lathanderism spread far and wide along the Trade Way. A conclave of Cormyrean priests from Marsember declared Daelegoth a heretic, while conversely the head of the Sun Soul monks offered their him their full support. On Midsummer that year, the Risen Sun prophet cast an epic spell that created a second sun that remained above the city of Elversult. While the church of Lathander remained divided, the church of Amaunator was reborn.
When the calamitous Spellplague struck the Realms in the , it was believed by some scholars that Lathander had died, while others insisted that he was actually the reincarnation of Amaunator. Yet another group theorized that Lathander was an aspect of Amaunator, a divine persona used to conceal his true nature during his centuries of absence.
During the time of the Second Sundering, in the , the child Chosen of Lathander Stedd Whitehorn arrived in Turmish and performed powerful magic while the druids of the Emerald Enclave recited the Hymn of Still Waters to end the realms devastating drought.
