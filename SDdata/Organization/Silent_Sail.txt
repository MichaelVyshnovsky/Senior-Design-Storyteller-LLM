The Silent Sail was a trading cabal operating in the Cormyrean city of Marsember.  The group took its name from the Marsemban slang word for a ship whose ownership could not be traced.  Membership consisted of eleven aging Marsemban merchants who made their fortunes in the shipping trade.  The guild was active in smuggling and secretly controlled several Sembian trading companies.
