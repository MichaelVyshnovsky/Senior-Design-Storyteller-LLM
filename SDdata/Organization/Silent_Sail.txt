The '''Silent Sail''' was a trading cabal operating in the [[Cormyr|Cormyrean]] city of [[Marsember]].  The group took its name from the Marsemban slang word for a ship whose ownership could not be traced.  Membership consisted of eleven aging Marsemban merchants who made their fortunes in the shipping trade.  The guild was active in smuggling and secretly controlled several [[Sembia|Sembian]] trading companies.{{Cite dungeon/185/Eye on the Realms: Silent Sail}}
