            "Lordship": "The daily lives of the knights were split between the defense of Nimbral and the local needs of their homestead. Upon admittance, knights were required to establish a hold, in accordance with their standing within the order. While the estate of a recruit may have been a manor house in the countryside, the established veteran knights were expected to maintain a walled fortress in the name of the realm.\n\nAs master of their hold, and the surrounding farmlands, a knight of the Hunt tended to the needs of his or her community, settled disputes, provided protection, and gathered a tithing. If the knight was away on duty, their staff and servants would take care of the administration of their hold.",
            "Hunts": "If knights were not in training, patrol, or soaring through the skies in mock combat drills with their brethren, they were expected to serve in a \"hunt\". Every seven days, a squadron of 10â€“40 knights would gather at an outpost within the mountains and sweep over the entire island of Nimbral, as well as the waters and coasts surrounding their entire realm, vigilant for potential dangers such as pirates or slavers."

They led patrols and hunts by mere virtue of the fact that they had more experience in combat and in the skies. They were considered as \"first among equals\" within the order.\n\n;Knight\n:Upon promotion to a knight in full standing, members were granted a set of ''[[storm armor]]'', a shimmering symbol of order.\n\n;Novice\n:Newly admitted knights were clearly identified by their [[Flying Hunt armor|unique armor]], which differed from those given to full-fledged members of the Flying Hunt."

        "History": "[[File:Flying Hunt.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''A [[Knight of the Flying Hunt]] battling a [[half-fiend]] [[yuan-ti]].'']]\nWhile the exact origin of the Knights of the Flying Hunt was unknown, it dated back to the actual formation of the nation of Nimbral itself. Originally settled by a group of moon elves, the nation didn't truly come into its identity until they were joined by a sect of [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaans]] from the [[Shining South]]. Leaving the mainland because to their devoted veneration of [[Leira]], these exiles from the [[arcane]] kingdom quickly intermingled with their elven neighbors. As two cultures became one, their view of the world expanded beyond the island and saw dangers beyond the sea.\n\nThe order of the Flying Hunt knights was the response to these perils. Under the guidance of the [[church of Leira]], the island-nation's [[magic]]al crafters came to develop [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[lance]]s and the iconic, luminescent [[glassteel]] [[Storm armor|armor]] that became synonymous the pegasus knights.\n\nIn [[1367 DR]], Commander Knight [[Baltir Merivolst]] led an expedition to the [[Nelanther Isles]] to stop a fleet of pirate ships that endangered the seas.",
