The Royal Constabulary was a law enforcement organization that operated in Tsurlagol in the Vast, in the 7th century DR.
In the early 7th century DR, the Royal Constabulary discovered the infamous pirate Urthag the Knife boldly carousing in the Bloated Gargoyle Inn. They tried to arrest him but he fled across the rooftops of the city, and was forced to drop the sword Galathos. Urthag escaped and his sword was given to King Lamoth.
