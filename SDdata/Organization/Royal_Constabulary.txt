The '''Royal Constabulary''' was a law enforcement organization that operated in [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]], in the 7th century [[DR]].

==History==
In the early 7th century [[DR]], the Royal Constabulary discovered the infamous pirate [[Urthag|Urthag the Knife]] boldly carousing in the [[Bloated Gargoyle Inn]]. They tried to arrest him but he fled across the rooftops of the city, and was forced to drop the sword [[Galathos]]. Urthag escaped and his sword was given to King [[Lamoth]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|88–89}}
