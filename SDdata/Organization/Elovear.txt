The '''Elovear''' family was a noble merchant family of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]]. The head of the family sat on the [[High Council]] that governed Tantras.

In [[1358 DR]], shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]], the Elovears were allied with the [[Channath]], [[Laranadda]], [[Tithlin]], and [[Vandover]] families.
