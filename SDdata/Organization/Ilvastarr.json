Within it were the familys historical records, the remains of their forebears, and a number of familial relics including the Bulwark of Ilvastarr. It was guarded by a spectator known as Qilnax.\nThe family has a storied history in Waterdeep and its surrounding lands, even before their ennoblement in the .\nMembers of the family were present during the Battle of Blood-Drenched Swords of the Second Trollwar. Following the defeat of the Black Claw horde, members of the Ilvastarr family looted the corpse of Lord Palinor Belabranta and stole the griffontack of Belabranta from his griffon mount.\nDuring the Guild Wars of the 1250s DR, Lord Haran of the City Watch pulled his watchmen from the streets, allowing members of an allied family to destroy the estate of House Zoar.
