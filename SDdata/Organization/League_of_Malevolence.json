        "mainbody": "5\nThe League of Malevolence was an order of evil adventurers that dedicated themselves to the constant acquisition of more and greater power.\nThe League was founded and led by Kelek, an egomaniacal sorcerer that fostered scant comradery or loyalty among its other members. It was kept together by shared feelings of greed and ambition, with the belief it would be mutually advantageous for all to work alongside one anotherâ€”until the time they could individually seize more for themselves.\nThese bonds were not strong however. The groups cleric Zargash intended to eventually take over leadership of the League by force, while the thief Zarak was detested by every member, to they point where they held no regard for his wellbeing. The warlock Skylla even abandoned the group, defecting from their ranks to expose one of their dastardly plots to a coven of hags.\nThe League took on any quest they believed would held garner more powerful, no matter how detestable. On one occasion they sought to recover the horn of a unicorn that had been cleaved from its head.\nFor a time the League dwelled within the Palace of Hearts Desire, the fortress of the archfey Zybilna, while she remained imprisoned within.\nThe League of Malevolence was always under threat by the company known as Valors Call, a band of heroic adventurers that hunted down the League for their villainous ways.\nSometime after its formation, Kelek led the League of Malevolence into the domain of Prismeer in the Feywild. He had somehow learned that the ruling archfey Zybilna was in fact Iggwilv, the adopted mortal daughter of Baba Yaga. Kelek and the League schemed to extort Zybilna into claiming a powerful arcane weapon from the wizard Ringlerun, who was traveling within Prismeer with Valors Call. It was shortly thereafter that Skylla betrayed the group by revealing Keleks plan to the Hourglass Coven, the three fey daughters of Baba Yaga that detested Zybilna for her wealth of power.\nAs the League of Malevolence entered into Zybilnas Palace of Hearts Desire, the hags of the Hourglass Coven readied a trap to freeze Zybilna in time. The hags of Hourglass Coven used ensuing chaos to spring their trap,\nIn the aftermath, the Hourglass Coven manipulated the remaining members of the League with protecting Zybilnas cauldron, ensuring her continued imprisonment.\n* Kelek, the groups rapacious leader that quested for the staff of power belonging to his rival Ringlerun.\n* Warduke, the heartless mercenary whose visage remained ever-hidden beneath his characteristic dread helm.\n* Skylla, a warlock that forged a pact with Baba Yaga, the Mother of all Witches.\n* Zarak, an unconscionable orc assassin whose smaller stature made him resemble a gruesome dwarf.\n* Zargash, a cleric of Orcus whose soul had been corrupted beyond redemption."
