The '''Spleen Eaters''' were a tribe of [[orc]]s that dwelled within the [[Stonelands]]. Their thirst for blood, specifically that of [[human]]s, was the stuff of legends.

==Base of Operations==
The tribe made their home in the infamous fortress of [[Big Bone Deep]].

==Possessions==
The Spleen Eaters were the keepers of the [[Gruumsh]]ar [[relic]] known as the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]''.

==History==
According to the legends that surrounded the tribe, they had lived in the Stonelands since before the [[Storm Horns|Storm Horn mountains]] had formed.

In the latter half of the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, tribesmen of the Spleen Eaters made a great trek across [[interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] to recover the ''Eye of Gruumsh'' when it was stolen from their home. They were guided by the divine intervention of Gruumsh himself and by his followers from across the region.

==Members==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the tribe was led by Chief [[Hadarog]]. He was aided in his leadership by the [[shaman]] called [[Glomred]].
