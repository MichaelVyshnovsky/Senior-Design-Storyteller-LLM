The Spleen Eaters were a tribe of orcs that dwelled within the Stonelands. Their thirst for blood, specifically that of humans, was the stuff of legends.
The tribe made their home in the infamous fortress of Big Bone Deep.
The Spleen Eaters were the keepers of the Gruumshar relic known as the Eye of Gruumsh.
According to the legends that surrounded the tribe, they had lived in the Stonelands since before the Storm Horn mountains had formed.
In the latter half of the , tribesmen of the Spleen Eaters made a great trek across central Faer√ªn to recover the Eye of Gruumsh when it was stolen from their home. They were guided by the divine intervention of Gruumsh himself and by his followers from across the region.
As of the late 15 century DR, the tribe was led by Chief Hadarog. He was aided in his leadership by the shaman called Glomred.
