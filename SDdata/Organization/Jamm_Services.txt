Jamm Services was a company on the planet Coliar that provided information and services to visiting spelljammers.
Since some time before 1350 DR, the director of Jamm Services was a rude and arrogant lizardman named Schlith Darkscale.
It is not known how many office locations there were for Jamm Services nor where its headquarters was located, but at least one office was found on the major port island of Hisssta.
Jamm Services provided information about restaurants, taverns, adventure sites, and other notable locations.
