'''Clan Marlserpent''' was an extinct [[dragonheir]] clan of the [[Sword Lands]] of [[Laerakond]].

==History==
Clan Marlserpent was one of the oldest clans of Laerakond. Its members were descendants of the first [[human]] roostmasters of the [[primordial]]s, who lived millennia before the [[Spellplague]].

In the late years of the 15th century [[DR]], clan Marlserpent was considered by most to have been completely wiped out by their enemies of old, the [[dragons]], with their last members having being killed around [[1459 DR]].

However, in [[1479 DR]], it was discovered that a member of this clan, [[Jada Marlserpent]], had survived the purge of her clan and was living in the village of [[Wandering Stones]], in [[Skelkor]].

==Known Members ==
* [[Jada Marlserpent]], the last survivor of Clan Marlserpent in [[1479 DR]].
