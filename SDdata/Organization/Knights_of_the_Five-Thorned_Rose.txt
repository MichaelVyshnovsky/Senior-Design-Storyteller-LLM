Originally, the Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose were drawn from the elite ranks of the [[Serpent Guards]] and were tasked with the destruction of the followers of [[Bahamut]], especially [[metallic dragon]]s. In the ten years from [[1360 DR|1360]] to [[1370 DR]], the Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose had killed many good-aligned dragons, and they had many libraries that guarded the dragon lore they had accumulated over the millennia.

The Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose survived the destruction of their country during the [[Spellplague]]. By [[1479 DR]], it was believed that the high-ranking members of the [[dragonborn]] [[clan Vkriss]], believed to be involved in many criminal activities, were members of the order of the Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose.
