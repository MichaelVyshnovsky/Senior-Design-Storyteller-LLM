        "mainbody": "he Grayclaws were a thieves guild located in the city of Tantras in the Vast in the 14th century DR.\nThe Grayclaws were composed of thieves and smugglers. Most thieves and other rogues in Tantras were Grayclaws. Those who were not either made an arrangement with the guild or were soon killed.\nAround 1358 DR, the Grayclaws were commanded by two men Amlithor Harlguss, a thief, and Othniir Xalast, a priest of Mask.\nAn effective thieves guild, the Grayclaws were largely engaged in both theft and smuggling. Being somewhat loyal to their city, they mostly only preyed upon visitors to Tantras and those native Tantrans whom they felt to have grown too wealthy, too arrogant, or too immoral. The Grayclaws watched each other and made certain that they did not attract undue attention, not wishing to making many enemies nor to raise the ire of the High Council of Tantras.\nThe Grayclaws were named for the claw-like weapons they favored in combat, also called grayclaws. Armed with these blades, Grayclaws could deliver a devastating sneak attack on their targets, though they were less effective with other weapons. The claws also help them to climb walls. A skilled grayclaw-wielder was dangerous in a fight and could scale a wall with ease, though they could hardly pick a pocket with them on.\nThe Grayclaws were loyal to Tantras and defended their home city against outside factions attempting to muscle into the underworld. They opposed such efforts by the Cult of the Dragon, the Red Wizards of Thay, the Zhentarim of Zhentil Keep, Inner Sea pirates sponsored by Calishite slavers, and even the Harpers. Only the Harpers were strong in Tantras, and they steered clear of the Grayclaws, as they had common enemies in the other groups.\nThe Grayclaws were well entrenched in Tantras by 1358 DR, by which time they had fought off, at one time or another, the Dragon Cult, the Red Wizards, the Zhentarim, and the slavers. They remained active through 1367 DR and past 1370 DR."
