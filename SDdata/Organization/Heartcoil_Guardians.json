        "mainbody": "The '''Heartcoil Guardians''' were a small army of [[stone golem]]s created to protect [[Chauntea's Citadel]] and the [[Harvestshield Mountain]] area against threats from the [[Underdark]]. They were designed to only respond to orders from the [[wizard]]s who created them.",
        "History": "The Guardians were created by wizards from Chauntea's Citadel to patrol the tunnels leading to the [[Heartcoil Deeps]], an area of the Underdark directly beneath Harvestshield Mountain. They were intended to complement the [[Harvestshield Reapers]], a cadre of [[flesh golem]]s who defended the area from above-ground raiders.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, no one remained who could control the Guardians. Despite the years of fighting threats from the Underdark, and an upswing in conflict that accompanied the rise of [[Mrolgyet's Legion]] on the surface and [[Qholillaroon]] in the Deeps, the Guardians endured."
