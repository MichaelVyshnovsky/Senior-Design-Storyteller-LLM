The '''Grand Fist''' were a group of [[adventurer]]s who operated ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]. They were well-meaning and kind people, but not particularly capable or competent.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Runners attended a party hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. The occasion was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.

==Known Grand Fists==
* [[Jacer Wind-dancer]]
* [[Brandy Fumblebuckle]]
