The '''Hammers of Grimjaws''' are the highest ranking and most elite order of [[paladin]]s who dedicate their lives and services to [[Tyr]].

==Membership==
Members of the Grimjaws are sponsored by existing members from the ranks of only two orders of Tyr, the [[Knights of Holy Judgment]] and the [[Knights of the Merciful Sword]].

===Vision===
The choosing of the Hammers' members is in part done by Tyr himself, in order to ascend the order's ranks, a candidate must pray and receive a vision from Tyr. A vision of Tyr's warhammer shows the god's favor and permits immediate acceptance into the order. A vision of Tyr's sword means that the aspiring Hammer has failed in some way and must atone before entering the ranks. A successful atonement quest allows the aspirant to join the Order as though he had seen the vision of the warhammer. Currently there are less than 12 Hammers in active service, a testament to the purity and power required to become one of the order.
