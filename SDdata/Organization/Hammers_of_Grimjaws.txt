The Hammers of Grimjaws are the highest ranking and most elite order of paladins who dedicate their lives and services to Tyr.
Members of the Grimjaws are sponsored by existing members from the ranks of only two orders of Tyr, the Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the Merciful Sword.
The choosing of the Hammers members is in part done by Tyr himself, in order to ascend the orders ranks, a candidate must pray and receive a vision from Tyr. A vision of Tyrs warhammer shows the gods favor and permits immediate acceptance into the order. A vision of Tyrs sword means that the aspiring Hammer has failed in some way and must atone before entering the ranks. A successful atonement quest allows the aspirant to join the Order as though he had seen the vision of the warhammer. Currently there are less than 12 Hammers in active service, a testament to the purity and power required to become one of the order.
