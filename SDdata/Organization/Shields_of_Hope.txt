The '''Shields of Hope''' was a sisterhood of [[swanmay]] [[ranger]]s devoted to [[Mielikki]], the Forest Queen.

==Activities==
Though dedicated to Mielikki, the sisters of the Shields of Hope spent most of their time protecting the [[priestess]]es of [[Shiallia]], who were called the [[Sisters of Life and Mercy]], within the [[High Forest]], safely escorting them in groups of three through the more dangerous sections of the forest.
