'''True Souls''' were high-ranking members of [[Cult of the Absolute]].

==Activities==
These servants of [[the Absolute]] were empowered by the the will of their "god". As such, they often commanded lesser members of the cult. Each True Soul appeared to be implanted by a magically modified [[mind flayer]] tadpole, and gained a set of abilities, including some form of [[telepathy]]. As such, a True Soul could enter another True Soul's mind.

==Base of Operations==
True Souls were known to be based around the [[Western Heartlands]].{{Cite comic/Mindbreaker 1}}

==History==
True Souls were first recognised in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
