True Souls were high-ranking members of Cult of the Absolute.
These servants of the Absolute were empowered by the the will of their "god". As such, they often commanded lesser members of the cult. Each True Soul appeared to be implanted by a magically modified mind flayer tadpole, and gained a set of abilities, including some form of telepathy. As such, a True Soul could enter another True Souls mind.
True Souls were known to be based around the Western Heartlands.
True Souls were first recognised in the 15 century DR.
