        "Description": "The Twilight Brigade consisted of 32 veteran mercenaries equipped with [[chain mail]], [[longsword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[shortbow]]s and [[flight arrow]]s.",
        "History": "{{quote\n|No! You're dead! You're all dead! You were all necessary casualties! It was war!\n|''[[Tobias Querl]], facing the consequences of his own actions''\n}}\nDuring Gondegal's war in 1352 DR, the Twilight Brigade operated in the [[Stonelands]], attacking targets of opportunity. They went uncontested by the [[Starburst Swords]] [[Purple Dragons]] unit and attacked the undefended village of [[Darkenshield]], razing it and slaughtering the entire population without mercy.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], they had found employment with Lord Aris, who wished to achieve the conquest of [[Cormyr]]. Along with other mercenaries such as the [[Eye Killers]], the 32 members of the unit gathered in [[Wyvernwatch Castle]], with one of them, [[Tobias Querl]], becoming Captain of the guard.\n\nWhen they marched on the ruins of Darkenshield in preparation for a greater campaign, they were instead met by the furious spirits of the village, returned for vengeance, and the spirits of the Starburst Swords, performing a final duty. The Twilight Brigade was torn apart by their own dead victims, with none surviving the battle."
