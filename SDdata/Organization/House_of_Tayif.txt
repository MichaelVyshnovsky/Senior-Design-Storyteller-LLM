The House of Tayif, also called the Ghost-Warriors, was a smaller tribe of unenlightened Al-Badia found in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.
The House of Tayif ranged from just outside of Qudra in the north all the way to the Realm of Bleeding Trees in the south. True to the name of "Ghost-Warriors," their movements did not seem humanly possible given the speed at which they struck.
A thousand unenlightened Zakharans formed the tribe. In truth, the tribes numbers seemed to be much higher since they roamed the entire expanse of the High Desert.
This tribe survived purely by raiding. All of the raiders were masked and wore white during battle to hide their appearance.
Sheikh Mouli al-Ajami ruled the House of Tayif in 1367 DR.
The other tribes of the High Desert did not deal with the House of Tayif unless it was to clash arms.
