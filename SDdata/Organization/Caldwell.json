        "orgname": "the Caldwell family",
        "mainbody": "The '''Caldwell''' family was one of the oldest and wealthiest of the [[patriar]] families of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Caldwells originally made their fortune on the the extensive orchards of [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s that were grown south of Baldur's Gate. In the 1400s DR, they branched out  into importing raw timber and exporting cut and treated lumber, thanks to their own treatment process. This was used by the majority of builders, carpenters, coopers, shipwrights, and wheelwrights in the region. By the 1480s DR, they'd expanded into shipping upriver and bought and operated two caravels, ''[[Abelea]]'' and ''[[Sweetseed]]''.\n\nThey were very well regarded within the city for their numerous charitable endeavors and financial investments in businesses located throughout the [[Lower City]]. They made generous donations to several temples: the [[High House of Wonders]], the [[Watchful Shield (shrine)|Watchful Shield]], the [[Shrine of the Suffering]], and the [[Church of Last Hope]]. Nevertheless, their riches were still not a patch on those of the [[Silvershield]] family.",
        "History": "For many years, the Caldwell family owed their wealth to the vast orchards that were located south of their home city. Around the {{YearlinkName|1432}}, however, these were destroyed by a disease that caused the trees to rot away. Wvllyck Caldwell, then a young alchemist, worked to find a cure, but the blight had run its course and the orchards recovered, before he could ever find one.\n\nOn the way, though, Wvllyck developed a new method of treating wood that water-proofed timber more effectively than paints or polishes. Lady Abelea Caldwell saw the benefits and made good use of it, taking over the family's businesses rebuilding their fortunes.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Lord Wyllyck Caldwell was considered a candidate for joining the [[Council of Four]], but was eventually passed over in favor of Lord [[Ulder Ravengard]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Baldur's Gate became plagued by a series of murders and disappearances. The members of the [[Flaming Fist]] showed little interest in addressing the incidents, but after the patriar families of Caldwell, [[Oberon (family)|Oberon]], and [[Linnacher]] became affected, the pressure from Flaming Fist demanding investigations from their superiors started to increase.",
