        "mainbody": "he Donakkis family of Coliar was the largest aarakocra family on that planet,\nLike all family leaders of Coliar society, the leader of the Donakkises was voted into office democratically from a pool of five candidates. For at least 1,200 years, only a female had served in this position of power.\nIn around 1360 DR, the Donakkises were led by Alekra Donakkis, a powerful female known for utilizing the aid of dragons and adventurers to maintain her power and great wealth.\nThe family collectively owned twelve spelljamming trade locations in the southeast hemisphere of Coliar,\nBecause of the vast network of spelljamming facilities owned by the Donakkises, many conflicts arose between the Donakkises and other aarakocra families and between the Donakkises and the lizardfolk of Coliar. Alekra had forged an alliance with the dragons of the planet, and they often came to the defense of the aarakocra family during inter-family disputes or fighting with the lizardfolk tribes. In return, Alekra paid them handsomely and also provided free access to spelljamming services for those dragons wanting to travel Realmspace."
