The '''Brotherhood of the Pick''' was a society affiliated with the church of [[Geb]] in [[Mulhorand]] around [[1369 DR]].

The majority of miners in the country were members. Its representatives presented their needs and wants to the nobility and handled negotiations, so it functioned much like a union.<ref>
