The '''Warhawks''' were an [[adventurer]] company who operated ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Warhawks attended a party hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. The occasion was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.
