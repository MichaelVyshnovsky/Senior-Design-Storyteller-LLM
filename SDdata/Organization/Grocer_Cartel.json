        "mainbody": "during Karsuss Folly\nThe Grocer Cartel was a powerful guild of traders and retailers that influenced the food trade in ancient Netheril.\nThe guild was led in a fair but unflinching manner by Ravenar Andarlis, who also owned Andarlis Transport. It had a heavy influence on the trade and transport of food in Netheril, and helped regulate prices and the economy in general. In Yeomans Loft, it took a particular role in controlling the flow of goods acquired via spelljamming expeditions, which were often hotly competed for.\nThe guilds headquarters was found on Helm Road in Yeomans Loft, and owned many other locations in that city and elsewhere, including Eileanar."
