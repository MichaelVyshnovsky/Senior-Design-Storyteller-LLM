The Goshukara clan, mostly known as Northern Goshukara, were one of the most powerful families in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR.
The Goshukara was a very ancient family, able to trace their ancestry directly to the emperor. Their members had ceremonial offices in the Emperors court. Secretly, they planned to supplant the Funada clan as rulers of Nakamaru.
