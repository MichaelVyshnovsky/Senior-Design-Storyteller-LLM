The '''Goshukara clan''', mostly known as '''Northern Goshukara''', were one of the most powerful families in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

The Goshukara was a very ancient family, able to trace their ancestry directly to the emperor. Their members had ceremonial offices in the Emperor's court. Secretly, they planned to supplant the [[Funada clan]] as rulers of Nakamaru.
