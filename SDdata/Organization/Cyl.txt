'''Cyl''' was a wealthy family of [[Neverwinter]] that reached prominence sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Cyl was already a well-established family in Neverwinter. The family elders hoped to cobble together a beneficial mercantile alliance by wedding their daughter, [[Anali Cyl]], into a wealthy merchant family from [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors. This plan coincided with the [[Luskan]]-[[Neverwinter]] war of 1372 DR, and Anali was to be shipped away from the conflict to her betrothed in Waterdeep.

The young woman was outraged over this plan and would rather perish defending Neverwinter than be wed against her will. Anali's parents sneered at their daughter's words until she grabbed the family heirloom [[falchion]] ''[[Decision]]'' off the wall, and stormed out.

Anali Cyl joined the defending forces of Neverwinter and, over the course of the war, became a renowned General. She wielded ''Decision'' in every battle since leaving her family estate behind.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, there remained no members of the Cyl clan in Neverwinter. However, branches of the family were still active in [[Athkatla]], [[Silverymoon]], and [[Zazesspur]]. A bastard Cyl, who chose not to use his family name, could be found living in [[Scornubel]].
