The '''Circus of Doctor Trundles''' was a circus, run by [[Trundles|Dr. Trundles]] and [[Tanaroo Quinson]], that traveled [[Impiltur]] and [[Damara]] with a collection of monsters in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Whenever the circus went through the town of [[Valls]], there was always excitement. The parade often started at noon. Each creature was set in a ''cage of imprisonment'' that resembles a circus wagon, which neutralized any magical abilities from the creatures within. The magic did not, however, inhibit the physical strength of the creatures.

==The Monsters==
In [[1357 DR]], when the circus visited the town of Valls, the monsters were:
* a [[bulette]],
* a [[chimera]],
* an ancient [[blue dragon]],
* a [[lamia]],
* a [[foxwoman]],
* a [[xorn]], and
* a [[gibbering mouther]].

==History==
In [[Valls]] in late summer or early autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the [[bulette]] burst out of its magical cage and furiously attacked the other cages, freeing the other monsters. All monsters except the bulette were recaptured, as the bulette went on to terrorize [[Halfling Downs]] in [[Carmathan]] for the next two years. While only minor losses were inflicted on Valls, the disaster damaged the circus's reputation. Trundles handed the reins of ringmaster to [[Tanaroo Quinson]] and stepped back to a less-active role. The circus moved south to Impiltur in effort to rebuild the circus's reputation and business. It was at the scene of the disaster, however, that [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his companions helped recapture the rampaging monsters and caught the attention of two refugees from [[Bloodstone Village]], leading eventually to the town's liberation from evil [[Vaasa]]ns.

In Impiltur, Trundles and his circus were accepted by the [[Lords of Imphras II]] provided that security be enhanced. The circus employed 27 [[fighter]]s, with three guarding each cage and instructed how to best deal with the monsters within.

As of [[1359 DR]], the bulette was gone and four new creatures had joined the cast:
* a pair of [[leucrotta]],
* a [[manticore]], and
* an [[umber hulk]].
