'''House Agrach Dyrr''' was a [[drow]] house of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Structure==
House Agrach Dyrr was the fifth house in [[1372 DR]].
 
The house was located on [[Qu'ellarz'orl]] and built around nine stalagmites. It was surrounded by adamantine and stone. It had flying buttresses around its spires and a railless bridge across a moat-like chasm. The house had multiple reception halls, as well as a small sitting room with coral, [[limestone]], and [[kuo-toa]] motifs. The compound itself formed of concentric circles, with a domed temple to [[Lolth]] in the center of the complex.

House Agrach Dyrr's temple had a sacrificial altar limned in purple faerie fire and candles. There was a large black sculpture of a spider (a guardian golem), which was home to the Lichdrow's phylactery. There were high-backed stone benches in the chapel, with weblike curtains, spider motifs, and actual spiders and webs.

The house had strong magical wards, many of which were placed by the [[Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]], including the master ward, which activated all wards in the compound in the event the lich's [[phylactery]] was destroyed.

==Activities==
Until [[1372 DR]], members of House Agrach Dyrr were the main soldiers at the [[Rhazzt's Dilemma]] outpost some 30 miles south of Menzoberranzan.

==History==
House Agrach Dyrr was more than 5,000 years old. Only House Baenre was older.

[[Matron Mother]] [[Auro'pol Dyrr]] was killed during the drow attack on [[Mithral Hall]] in [[1358 DR]]. After Auro'pol's death, [[Yasraena Dyrr]] became matron mother.

In [[1372 DR]], House Agrach Dyrr entered into a secret alliance with the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], which had chosen that house because of the de facto male ruler, the ([[Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]]). In exchange for the assassination of Matron Mother [[Ghenni Tlabbar]], they worked with [[Nimor Imphraezl]] to betray Menzoberranzan's [[Army of the Black Spider]] to the armies of [[Gracklstugh]] and [[Kaanyr Vhok]]. Nimor posed as Captain "Zhayemd" of House Agrach Dyrr in order to complete the deception. 

After the house's betrayal was revealed, the house compound was besieged by [[House Xorlarrin]] and its allies. [[Gromph Baenre]] battled Lord Dyrr, destroying his corporeal form and infiltrating the house to destroy the lich's [[phylactery]]. Destroying the phylactery activated the master ward, destroying the house temple.  Before the Xorlarrins could move in, [[Triel Baenre]] arrived and halted the assault. She met with [[Anival Dyrr]], daughter of [[Yasraena Dyrr|Yasraena]], and made an agreement: House Agrach Dyrr were to become vassals of House Baenre for centuries, "essentially an extension of House Baenre." House Agrach Dyrr was also removed from the Ruling Council.

==Members==
Agrach Dyrr had [[orc]] and [[bugbear]] slaves. They also had [[ogre]]s and [[troll]]s. In [[1373 DR]], there were at least two [[vrock]]s serving House Agrach Dyrr.
