        "mainbody": "The '''Alliance of Belt Watchers''' was a military organization in [[Damara]] in the [[Bloodstone Lands]] in [[1359 DR]], formed by a pact between three races.",
        "Organization": "The Alliance gathered the [[dwarves]] and the [[halfling]]s of the [[Barony of Bloodstone]], later joined also by the [[centaur]]s. The alliance was only a defensive one but used brilliant tactics, thanks to capable tacticians like [[Gailan]], [[Fredegast]], and [[Valon]].",
        "Activities": "Dwarves, halflings, and centaurs who had a shared interest in mining comprised the pact, but the Alliance of Beltwatchers also helped protect Bloodstone Barony during times of need.",
        "History": "The Alliance was established in [[1357 DR]] by the halflings and the dwarves of Bloodstone, who had already had a strong bond from long before [[human]]s arrived in the area. They organized themselves into an army in order to protect themselves from the army of [[Zhengyi]]. Later, the halflings brought the centaurs into the alliance. The alliance remained active after Zhengyi was defeated and in 1359 DR the dwarves offered for the [[deep gnome]] King [[Ruggedo]] to join the alliance.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Alliance was primarily active within Bloodstone Barony, particularly within [[Warrenwood]] and the miles of tunnels found beneath the ground around the [[Warren]]."
