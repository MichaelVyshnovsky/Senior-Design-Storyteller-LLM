        "mainbody": "The '''Marekh Dynasty'''{{Marekh spelling}} was the last of the twelve dynasties of the [[First Age of Calimshan]], though it was the first of that nation's many dynasties whose name is remembered by history.",
        "Organization": "The leaders of the Marekh Dynasty were [[bakkal]]s, or high [[priest]]s, of their people.",
        "Activities": "The rulers of this dynasty were relatively peaceful, with the exception of a few skirmishes with the [[dwarves]] of [[Shanatar]].",
        "Base of Operations": "The bakkal's palace was located in the city of [[Calimport]].",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Daud el Marekh]], a ship captain and the final bakkal of the dynasty.",
        "History": "This dynasty began during an era of some 1300 years of peace following the unification of [[Coramshan]] and [[Mir]] into the nation of Calimshan by the warlord [[Ukhar IV]].\n\nLike many of the dozen dynasties of this age, the Marekhs faced the threat of plagues, which many modern Calishite scholars believed were created intentionally by the [[Jhaamdath]]an Empire.''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' claims that this plague and the devastation of the Marekh dynasty occurred ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-4770}}, but this is an error, a result of merging the entries for &minus;4770 and {{Yearlink|-3332}} in the timeline provided on p. 14 of the [[Calimport (sourcebook)|''Calimport'']] sourcebook. The heir, Daud yn Khadil el Marekh, survived the plague and ruled, but he could not do so from decimated Calimport, as people feared living there again. When his reign of twelve years ended, so did his dynasty and the First Age.\n\nIt would not be until {{Yearlink|-3250}}, nearly a century later, that a bakkal would rule in Calimport again. That bakkal was the first member of the [[Pahlemn Dynasty]]{{Pahlemn spelling}} and ushered in Calimshan's [[Second Age of Calimshan|Second Age]].",
        "Trivia": "One of the ''[[sabbans]]'' in the city of Calimport was named after this dynasty, [[Marekh Sabban]] in [[Emerald Ward]]."
