        "mainbody": "kulking Dragon was a kobold raider tribe that was once ruled by Sholsarrath the Lame, sometime before the late 14 century DR.\nSholsarrath was a kobold shaman who, in order to avoid a grisly death, entered a warlocks pact with the demon Yargulbuzul. Empowered by the pact, Sholsarrath committed to taking care of his tribe and keeping it happy and well-fed – for a kobold, that meant raiding local farms. With help from the tribes old chief, Sholsarrath trained the kobold warriors to be a fearsome force. Soon after the plunder began, the Skulking Dragons became hated and feared among the locals. The clans infamy rose so much that a band of traveling adventurers decided to end the kobold menace.\nThe five adventurers rode out of the village of Houndstown and quickly were able to track the Skulking Dragon clan. The kobolds might have been a nightmare for the local peasantry, but they were naught but pests for weathered adventures, who slaughtered the clans best warriors en masse. Desperate once again to escape sure doom, Sholsarrath the Lame evoked Yargulbuzuls name once again, demanding salvation and a way to escape. Yargulbuzul claimed that it would be a tough feat to accomplish and demanded one last payment from the kobold, a payment greater than anything he paid before. The dim-witted warlock agreed frantically to Yargulbuzuls demands – the kobolds head. When the five adventurers reached the shamans lair, they witnessed a happy imp decapitating Sholsarrath and carrying his soul to the Abyss."
