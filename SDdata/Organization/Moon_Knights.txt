The moon knights were specialty priests of the Church of Sel没ne and members of a highly militant order of soldier-priests devoted to the Moonmaiden.
Sel没ne ordered the establishment of the moon knights in response to hostility by her sister Shar. They were active by 1369 DR.
The moon knights were joyous and good humored when celebrating, but they fostered a deep hatred of the goddess Shar and her faithful, reacting with rage and even bloodlust whenever they encountered them.
Supplementing the crusaders of the Sel没nite church, the moon knights were charged with defending the church against threats from Shar and even to take the fight to the Sharrans directly.
The moon knights were intimately linked to the goddess and her divine power, such that their abilities waxed and waned with the moonGiven the close similarity and association with the Sel没nite faith, this is assumed to be lunar magic. During the full moon, three days each month, a moon knight became generally more capable and could turn undead with more force. However, during the new moon, three days each month, a moon knight was generally less capable and could not turn undead at all. Moreover, a lycanthrope moon knight had a better chance of controlling themselves, both during the full moon and in their beast forms.
In addition, a moon knight was unable to cast spells or even use magic items that produced darkness. Nevertheless, they trained to fight in the dark and while blinded, to counter Sharran tactics.
Some learned the skills of navigation.
The moon knights uniformly wore splint armor colored silver and white with the two eyes of the goddess emblazoned across the chest, together with a helmet with a blue crest and a cloak of midnight blue. They preferred the moons hand mace favored by the church.
