The wedding ceremony was held in Waterdeep but was darkened by the bride's sister, [[Tryola Perrentine]]'s disappearance. In reality, Tryola was captured by [[orc]]s of [[Horazak]]'s a marauding group that was allied with [[drow]] who were plotting Waterdeep's downfall. Several months later, Tryola emerged from [[Undermountain]], alive, traumatized, but not broken. The noblewoman was rescued by an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]].\n\nIn [[1371 DR]], Lady Hlanta Melshimber was caught in a scandal after her bitter rival, Lady [[Hyara Talmost]], perished under strange circumstances, right after Lady Melshimber publicly embarrassed Hyara by revealing some of the juicy details of the woman's youthful indiscretions. Hyara came back as a [[ghost]] and resumed the status of the family's matriarch and accused Hlanta Melshimber of treachery.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5}}"
