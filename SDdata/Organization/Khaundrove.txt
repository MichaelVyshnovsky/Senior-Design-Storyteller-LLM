The Khaundrove family was one of the twenty wealthy families that made up the Onsruur (the hereditary council of lords) in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This family tended toward short, stocky bodies with lots of muscle but no distinguishing facial features. They studied war and battle strategy as a hobby, setting up large gaming tables decorated to look like various plots of actual locations around Faerûn in miniature.
They were ultraconservative, believing that humans and not dwarves should hold all the power and wealth in Khôltar (gnomes and halflings were dismissed as insignificant). They were staunchly adamant that the Onsruur should not allow any new members to have a seat at the table.
The Khaundroves inserted themselves into the business and political arenas of Tashalar, and (with an inflated view of their own importance) thought they were a rising power in that country.
In addition to their many manufacturing properties, the Khaundroves owned the hole-in-the-wall blurdren (food counter) known as Mother Talaskos.
This family owned foundries and stamping factories that produced cheap knock-offs of many high-quality goods exported by the dwarves of the Great Rift. They used the lowest priced raw materials and flooded the markets in the Vilhon Reach and Calimshan.
The klathlaaedin (fancy sculpted stone mansion) of the Khaundroves was a fairly tasteful edifice named Baharrokhbrur located on the North Way very close to Farrgaunlar (the southern gate into Khôltar).
They were rancorous rivals of the Horthander clan, whom they nicknamed the "Horsefaces".
