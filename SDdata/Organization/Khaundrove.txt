The '''Khaundrove''' family was one of the twenty wealthy families that made up the [[Onsruur]] (the hereditary council of lords) in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|69}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 54: Khôltar, Part 5, The Farrgaunlar}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|87}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 66: Khôltar, Part 17, More on the Onsruur}}

==Organization==
This family tended toward short, stocky bodies with lots of muscle but no distinguishing facial features. They studied war and battle strategy as a hobby, setting up large gaming tables decorated to look like various plots of actual locations around [[Faerûn]] in miniature.

They were ultraconservative, believing that humans and not dwarves should hold all the power and wealth in Khôltar ([[gnomes]] and [[halflings]] were dismissed as insignificant). They were staunchly adamant that the Onsruur should not allow any new members to have a seat at the table.

==Activities==
The Khaundroves inserted themselves into the business and political arenas of [[Tashalar]], and (with an inflated view of their own importance) thought they were a rising power in that country.

In addition to their many manufacturing properties, the Khaundroves owned the hole-in-the-wall blurdren (food counter) known as [[Mother Talasko's]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|70}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 55: Khôltar, Part 6, Looking Around the Farrgaunlar}}

==Tactics==

This family owned foundries and stamping factories that produced cheap knock-offs of many high-quality goods exported by the dwarves of the [[Great Rift]]. They used the lowest priced raw materials and flooded the markets in the [[Vilhon Reach]] and [[Calimshan]].

==Base of Operations==
The klathlaaedin (fancy sculpted stone mansion) of the Khaundroves was a fairly tasteful edifice named [[Baharrokhbrur]] located on the [[North Way]] very close to Farrgaunlar (the southern gate into Khôltar).

==Relationships==
They were rancorous rivals of the [[Horthander]] clan, whom they nicknamed the "Horsefaces".
