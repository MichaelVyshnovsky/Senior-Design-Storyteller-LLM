        "mainbody": "The '''Shining Crusade''' was an quasi-religious army that formed in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, in the [[Sword Coast]] region of the [[Western Heartlands]]. It was formed and led by [[Caelar Argent]], the charismatic individual that united many people under the shared faith of their cause. \n\nTheir ultimate goal was to descend into [[Avernus]] through the ''[[portal]]'' beneath [[Dragonspear Castle]], slay the [[devil]]s within, and bring back to [[Faerûn]] those who died during the [[Dragonspear Wars]]. Caelar Argent misled her followers to believe the souls of the dead would be restored during the Crusade. In truth, she sought the return of one soul that mattered to her, that of [[Aun Argent|her uncle]].",
        "Organization": "{{Quote|Many souls were lost during the [[Dragonspear Wars]]. I will see justice done and restore them to the light.|[[Caelar Argent]]}}\nThe Shining Crusade was led by Caelar Argent, a [[paladin]] within the [[Order of the Aster]]. Her [[Aasimar|divine heritage]] and zealous nature made her something of a saint to those that followed her. She was served by several spiritual leaders and field commanders, who were drawn from many walks of life.{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|21}}\n\nThe crusade attracted a few different, distinct types of people from the [[Western Heartlands]] within its ranks. Many of those who fought in the [[First Dragonspear War|first]] and [[second Dragonspear War]]s were eager to join Caelar Argent's cause and undo the damage they inflicted upon the region. Supplementing the experienced soldiers were mercenaries, taken from a variety of [[humanoid]] races such as [[gnoll]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s and [[half-orc]]s.{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|10}}\n\nBeyond those that were skilled in combat, many common folk took up arms for the crusade. Quite a few were pressed into service, either through intimidation or as a replacement for their livelihood that had been taken by the army's destruction. Yet others joined by virtue of the charisma and zeal that Caelar Argent displayed.",
        "Activities": "To recruit new members, the crusade distributed pamphlets across the lands through which they marched. They promised [[currency|gold]] and glory to anyone that joined their ranks.\n\nThey celebrated an event called ''The Lightning'' that involved a large bonfire and collective chanting led by a [[priest]]. During the event, participants claimed to have \"seen the light\" or felt a \"fire\" in their chest.",
        "Tactics": "As the crusade moved across the Sword Coast, many settlements were raided and devastated by loss. While some townsfolk offered them resources as tribute, the crusade used to force to get what else they wanted – weapons, supplies, and even recruits. The Shining Lady's zealous and charismatic cult of personality even attracted enthusiastic conscripts from among the towns destroyed by her crusade.  \n\nDespite their perception as a divine cause, the leaders of the Shining Crusade were not above employing [[assassin]]-like agents wielding [[poison]]s.",
        "Base of Operations": "[[File:DragonspearExt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Shining Crusade garrisoned at Dragonspear Castle]]\nThe crusade established itself within Dragonspear Castle, located on the southern edge of the [[High Moor]].",
        "Possessions": "As they operated as an army did, crusaders were expected to wear a certain uniform. Members in high–standing were given [[Ring of the Crusade|rings]] that signified their devotion to Caelar and her movement.",
        "Relationships": "{{Quote|This is madness! The crusade has offered us the opportunity to walk away from this alive if we surrender the fort. Those who have actually made this place their home seem willing to accept the terms. But those refugees who've taken shelter here the past weeks refuse to listen to reason. They've lost their lands to Caelar Argent's mercenaries and their families to her charm.|Excerpt from the diary of [[Kelef Rhon]], [[Everwatch Knights|Knight of the Everwatch]]. }}\n\nSurprisingly, the crusade held a complicated relationship with the people of the Sword Coast. While their actions caused great destruction and chaos in the region, Caelar was often seen favorably by those she \"conquered\".",
        "History": "{{See also|War of the Shining Crusade}}\nThe crusade began with Caelar and a few followers that appeared around the High Moor in month of [[Eleasis]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|32}} After growing in numbers rather rapidly, they garrisoned themselves in Dragonspear Castle. They extended their territory and took control of the surrounding lands, from the [[Serpent Hills]] to within the [[Trollbark Forest]], as far south as the [[Winding Water]]. As they expanded further, hundreds were killed and tens of thousands were sent fleeing from their homes for shelter.  \n\nIn early [[Uktar]], member-states of the [[Lords' Alliance]] – including the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], the [[Grand Duke]]s of Baldur's Gate, and the mayor of [[Daggerford]] – rallied soldiers from their respective armed forces and formed a [[Coalition|coalition army]], to march upon Dragonspear Castle and meet the threat of the crusade.  \n\nThe Shining Crusade and the Coalition engaged in a number of battles over the following weeks. After crusade besieged the walled settlement of [[Bridgefort]], the [[Flaming Fist]] countered and marched their mercenary soldiers north and rallied with the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Waterdhavian guardsmen]] and [[Army of Daggerford|Daggerford militia]].  \n\nAlthough Caelar Argent attempted to broker a truce with a coalition representative at [[Dead Man's Pass]], negotiations failed and the crusade took up arms once again. They launched a failed assault on the Coalition war camp and were forced to retreat to Dragonspear Castle. The Coalition forces quickly recuperated and launched their own offensive on the castle. They breached its walls, laid siege to the fortress and forced the Shining Lady, her top advisor [[Hephernaan]], and a mere handful of crusaders to retreat to the castle's basement.\n\nJust as the Hero of Baldur's Gate, his companions, and the Coalition soldiers closed in on the pair, the Revered Brother revealed his true intentions. He placed everyone in temporary ''stasis'' and stole some divine blood from the famous [[Bhaalspawn]] in order to open the ''portal'' to the Hells. He sought to open a path for his master [[Belhifet]] and his army of devils to invade [[Faerûn]]. Caelar Argent led her crusaders in quick pursuit, and the Hero and his companions followed shortly after. While it was unknown exactly what transpired in Avernus, Belhifet was permanently slain on his home plane and the Shining Crusade was put to an end.",
