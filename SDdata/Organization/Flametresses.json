        "mainbody": "The Flametresses were a band of traveling priestesses of Sune who traveled, among other places, throughout the Dalelands during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThey priestesses were particularly well known at the Pushy Pixie Inn within the town of Velarsburg, where they would stop once a month and display their skill in the art of dancing. These performances would often show up the local, more risque dancers at the Pixie, though the rowdy nature of the establishment may have hid any resentment or animosity."
