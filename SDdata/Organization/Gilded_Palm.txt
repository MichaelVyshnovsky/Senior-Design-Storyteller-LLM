The Gilded Palm was a holy slayer organization in Zakhara whose members followed the teachings of Jisan, the Zakharan goddess of fruitfulness.
The symbol and favored weapon of the Gilded Palm was a dagger that had a coin-encrusted hilt.
The practices of the Guilded Palm almost made them appear as a group of assassins who could be hired. Holy slayers of the Gilded Palms regularly took jobs from merchants and other businessmen, since they believed anything that hindered bounty should be destroyed.
Agents of the Gilded Palm were found throughout Zakhara.
