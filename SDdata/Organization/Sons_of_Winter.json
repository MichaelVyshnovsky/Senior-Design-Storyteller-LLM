        "mainbody": "The Sons of Winter was a primordial cult dedicated to Cirotralech that operated out of the Fimbrul in Laerakond.\nIn 1480 DR, the Sons of Winter were founded by the scholar Rathloff, in order to awaken the primordial Cirotralech.\nTo fulfill their goals, Rathloff and his followers raided the ruins of Darkturret in Gontal, searching for powerful magic items. This alerted Queen Imreera Hethkantan of their existence, and the Queen quickly assembled a group of adventurers to deal with the cultists.\nThe adventurers faced the Sons in Fimbrul, where they were conducting foul rituals to unleash Cirotralech, having previously released the Bride, Cirotralechs consort. The adventurers were able to stop the ritual and kill all the Sons, but is uncertain whether or not they could stop them unleashing Cirotralech.\nThe Sons of Winter was composed of madmen who believed in the primordials.\n* Rathloff, leader of the cult.\nCategoryCults\nCategoryReligious organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Fimbrul\nCategoryOrganizations in Laerakond\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\naikxs7ahn4xo0ij3peskq6k0aebbk8c"
