        "mainbody": "ouse Fey-Branche was the fifth house of the drow city of Menzoberranzan in 1484 DR.\nHouse Fey-Branche served as a lackey to a number of houses, most notably House Baenre, hoping to curry favor with them.\nHouse Fey-Branche was based in a defensive, triangular shaped compound in the Narbondellyn district of Menzoberranzan. The outer part of the compound consisted of a very high adamantine wall and the only entrance was a single gate. Anyone who approached within 30 feet of the walls in any area other than the gate were shot with lightning bolt spells. Shriekers throughout the compound also called out alarms if anyone not wearing the house insignia was seen. \nThree towers anchored each corner of the compound and were used for defensive purposes. Within the walls were four main sets of buildings slave pens (for about 400 slaves), a temple to Lolth (where the noble females lived), troop quarters (for about 200 soldiers), and family quarters (housing the rest of the houses commoners and male nobles).\nHouse Fey-Branche was one of the oldest houses of Menzoberranzan, having been formed around âˆ’2500 DR. However, it experienced a great deal of bad luck over the centuries, especially the nobles, who have died in untimely accidents or assassinations.\nDuring the Sable Years, House Fey-Branche began as eleventh house. However, it rose to the position of eighth house in 1338 DR as a result of the fall of House DoUrden In 1484 DR, it became the fifth house after the departure of House Xorlarrin to QXorlarrin.\nIn 1372 DR, the Fey-Branche contingent was destroyed at the Pillars of Woe.\nIn 1484 DR, First Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre dined at House Fey-Branche for the Festival of the Founding.
