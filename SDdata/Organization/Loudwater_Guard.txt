The '''Loudwater Guard''' was the militia of the city of [[Loudwater]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. They were also known as the '''Loudwater Riders'''.<ref group="note">The ''Legacy of the Green Regent'' sources do not make it clear what the Loudwater Riders actually are. As it's clear they're not an adventuring company, nor related to any other faction, it is presumed they are a militia of Loudwater. For convenience, it's assumed they're a part of or the same as the better-known Loudwater Guard.

==Organization==
It comprised 300 soldiers, typically divided into patrols of up to 20. Regular members, called 'guards', were proficient [[warrior]]s, while the sergeants, titled 'fists', were capable [[fighter]]s. They were aided by mages, namely [[evoker]]s and [[sorcerer]]s, and [[cleric]]s, typically of [[Helm]], the [[Red Knight]], or [[Torm]].

The militia was ultimately commanded by the two [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlets]] of Loudwater.

A particular patrol was [[Thelbrimm's Nine]], also known as Thelbrimm's Four. Serving under Gauntlet Thelbrimm, they were one of the units that patrolled and protected the eastern lands of Loudwater's domain.<ref group="note">Given the contradictory and dubious rumors in which they are mentioned, it's possible Thelbrimm's Nine/Four does not actually exist.

==Possessions==
Warriors were equipped with [[chainmail]], a wooden [[light shield]], [[longsword]], [[light crossbow]], and [[bolt]]s. They wore uniforms of electric-blue [[tabard]]s emblazoned front and back with the city's three golden crescent moons, over dark-brown [[breech]]es and blouses.

The sergeants instead wore white tabards and were granted masterwork longswords and magical ''+1 chainmail'' and ''+1 wooden light shields'', including [[alchemical silver]] bolts and ''[[potion]]s of [[cure light wounds]]''.

==Activities==
Typically, when there was trouble in the city, the citizens called for the Loudwater Guard, who responded within a minute with a group of up to a dozen guards led by a fist, and possibly with a spellcaster.

The Loudwater Riders ranged further afield, as far as the [[Grey Highlands]]. They would use boats to cross the [[River Greyflow]] at [[Celdor's Crossing]].

Occasionally, the Loudwater Riders needed to clear bandits or [[bugbear]]s out of the ruined [[Phantoms' Cloister]] in [[Southwood]].

==Bases of Operations==
Within the city, the Loudwater Guard was divided by and based in a number of buildings known as 'armories'. These didn't just store and supply weapons, but also served as police stations for maintaining order in their respective neighborhoods. Each armory was commanded by a fist captain, who had a staff of 3 to 5 fists, who each led patrols of 5 to 10 guards. One was the Geenfunt Armory, which was located in Funt Market at the end of [[Geenfunt Way]], and had three fists.

The Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches had their headquarters in the Eastenhall

==History==
{{fq

In the {{yearlinkName|1358}}, a troop of [[Zhentarim]] and [[Zhentilar]] commanded by [[Vaalgamon]] invaded the main street of Loudwater to ambush the [[Heroes of Ascore]], a band of [[adventurer]]s carrying the magical statuettes of [[Ascore]]. With their [[manticore]]s, they blocked the main street and patrolled side streets looking for them. However, for some reason, Lord Greysword dared not move openly against the Zhents. Making use of Loudwater's winding roads and side streets, the adventurers thinned the Zhents' numbers and routed them, and the Loudwater Guard joined them for the final fight. However, Vaalgamon escaped and burned his headquarters as he left, causing much damage in the area and necessitating rebuilding. In the [[tenday]]s afterward, one guardsman declared Vaalgamon had done it to prevent the Guard seizing his plans, lest they thwart the whole Zhentish invasion. The fellow boasted he had been in the frontline and nearly struck the Zhent commander before he escaped.

During the [[Gray Migrations]] of the [[High Forest orc]]s in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, by the month of [[Eleasis]] a story was going around the [[Grayvale]] that Thelbrimm's Nine had found five families in a homestead east of [[Orlbar]] massacred by orcs and their homes destroyed, and that the orcs had taken nothing and done it for kicks. Another version said it was Thelbrimm's Four, that it was only two families killed but also all their animals, including the [[cat]]s.

In late Eleasis, the Loudwater Riders reported seeing [[Xerxillis|a red dragon]] near a place called [[Tangletrees]].
