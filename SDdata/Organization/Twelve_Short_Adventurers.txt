The Twelve Short Adventurers was a popular circus troupe that traveled across the Sea of Swords and throughout the Nelanther Isles, hosting lavish and imaginative performances to thunderous applause, sometime before 1372 DR.
The Twelve Short Adventurers was a group of twelve halflings that consisted of acrobats, escape artists, and jugglers.
Most notable items that were either created for the Twelve Short Adventurers or inspired by them were appropriately named magical Juggling Axes of the Twelve Short Adventurers.
