The '''Seven''' were the first apprentices of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] who ventured with him into [[Undermountain]]. 

==Members==
* [[Rantantar]]: Described as dour man scarred by fire.
* [[Marambra Nyghtsteel]]: Said to be an evocation mage.
* [[Trobriand]]: Called "the Metal Mage", Trobriand had a gift for building metal [[construct]]s and monstrosities.
* [[Muiral]]: Called "the Misshapen", Muiral was originally a great warrior who served as Halaster's bodyguard. He later became an apprentice to the Mad Mage and used his power to augment his considerable strength and fighting prowess. Finally, as the madness of Undermountain overcame him, he grafted his body onto a [[giant scorpion]].<ref>
* [[Arcturia]]: Much like Muiral, Arcturia's madness led her to experiment with bodies, both hers and others. Perhaps Halaster's most ambitious apprentice, she was known for her cruel experiments with [[polymorph]]ing others to suit her whims.
* [[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]]: For reasons unknown, Jhesiyra transformed herself into a living ''[[wish]]'' spell to escape from Halaster, but he brought her back to Undermountain. She later ruled over other [[living spell]]s in Undermountain's [[Citadel of the Bloody Hand]]. Driven half mad by her transformation, she ruled over the living spells the Mad Mage forced her to create, and it is uncertain whether she was truly aware of Halaster's demise.
* [[Nester]]: A handsome man and [[necromancer]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|307}}, they abandoned [[Halaster's Hold]] and moved into Undermountain.

As of [[1372 DR]], it was believed one of the Seven was dead, two others remained alive, and the fate of the others was still unknown. The two known to still be alive were Trobriand the Metal Mage and Muiral the Misshapen.

==Other Known Apprentices==
[[Shradin Mulophor]]: Shradin was a powerful [[Netherese]] [[necromancer]] who'd survived the [[Netheril#The Fall|collapse of his civilization]]. While he was not an original apprentice, in the {{YearlinkName|1148}}, he learned of [[Sargauth Enclave]] and petitioned to become an apprentice to the Mad Mage. Halaster agreed and also allowed him to take the Enclave as his own. Shradin, calling himself the "Lord of Bones", turned the Enclave into [[Skullport]], a neutral way-station permanently linking Undermountain to the Underdark.
