'''Clan Boldenbar''' was one of the two [[shield dwarf]] clans in [[the Vast]] chiefly responsible for the construction of the city of [[Sarbreen]], part of the larger kingdom of [[Roldilar]],<ref> and the rulers of it in all but name.{{Cite organized play/LC/Approaching Doom|33}}

==History==
An heirloom of this clan that was passed down through the generations, a ''[[Hammer of Thunderbolts]]'', was the source of Sarbreen's alias, "City of the Hammer". When the kingdom of Roldilar fell, Unteius led the city's refugees to safety. While traveling through the [[Underdark]], his ''Hammer of thunderbolts'' was lost somewhere during an ambush, though the events of that day went unrecorded.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Clan Boldenbar was making efforts to reestablish its presence and authority within the Vast, reopening many of its old clan halls.
