'''The Fulfilled Heart''' was a matchmaking agency in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''The men and women of this city can be so awfully picky sometimes. Might I suggest that you try submitting a portrait that presents you in a different light? Not that there's anything wrong with a blacksmith, but I wonder if that might be one of the prejudices that we are unfortunately running into where tastes are concerned.''|Maestro Hartstrum}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, master smith [[Gyldro Angleiron]] of the [[Rivington General]] smithy attempted to find a mate using the services of The Fulfilled Heart's Maestro [[Hartstrum]]. Despite Hartstrum's best attempts, the agency continuously failed to find anyone interested in a date with a simple blacksmith. In his letter to the proprietor of Rivington General, Maestro Hartstrum recommended Gyldro to commission a portrait that looked less like a blacksmith and more conventionally attractive. But even without a revised portrait, The Fulfilled Heart promised never to stop trying to arrange a date for the gruff [[melancholic]] man.
