House Dauntinghorn was a noble family of Cormyr. Their seat was Dauntinghorn House in Suzail in Cormyr.  The family was distantly related to the Truesilvers.
The family was very keen on expanding Cormyrs shipping interests and enlarging the official presence of Cormyrs navy in the Inner Sea, and allied with the Truesilvers in this goal.  The relocation of Cormyrs navy to Suzail from Marsember in the late 15th century DR boosted the familys power.
The Three Ravens was considered a seat of power for a group of nobles consolidated under the Lord of House Dauntinghorn in the late 15th Century DR.
