'''House Dauntinghorn''' was a noble family of [[Cormyr]]. Their seat was [[Dauntinghorn House]] in [[Suzail]] in Cormyr.  The family was distantly related to the [[Truesilver]]s.

The family was very keen on expanding Cormyr's shipping interests and enlarging the official presence of Cormyr's navy in the [[Inner Sea]], and allied with the Truesilvers in this goal.  The relocation of Cormyr's navy to Suzail from [[Marsember]] in the late 15th century DR boosted the family's power.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}

[[The Three Ravens]] was considered a seat of power for a group of nobles consolidated under the Lord of House Dauntinghorn in the late 15th Century DR.
