The Foresters were elite members of the Aglarondan army. These troops were rangers and patrolled the Yuirwood. They were skilled at using coastboats for transportation and raids, particularly against invading forces. Most (but not all) Foresters were half-elves. They gathered at Foresters Hall in Velprintalar.
