The '''Foresters''' were elite members of the [[Aglarond]]an army. These troops were [[ranger]]s and patrolled the [[Yuirwood]]. They were skilled at using [[coastboat]]s for transportation and raids, particularly against invading forces. Most (but not all) Foresters were [[half-elf|half-elves]]. They gathered at [[Foresters' Hall]] in [[Veltalar|Velprintalar]].
