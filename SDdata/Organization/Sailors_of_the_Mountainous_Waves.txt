The Sailors of the Mountainous Waves were a group of sea-faring dwarves active around  on the island of Ruathym, which was then known as Arauwurbarak.
Originally from Haunghdannar, the dwarves constructed the fortress of Sonnmorndin on Ruathym to use as a base of operations for their sailing excursions.
