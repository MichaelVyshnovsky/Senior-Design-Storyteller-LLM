        "mainbody": "The '''church of Myrkul''', also known as the '''Gray Ones''', or (disparagingly) '''Fingerbones''',  was the predominant organization dedicated to the worship and veneration of the Lord of the Dead, [[Myrkul]]. It was not a popular faith in [[Faerûn]], whose members were often looked upon as secretive, morbid loners, who were obsessed with death and enjoyed seeing fear in others. While that might have been the case in some instances, they were dedicated to the care of the dying and deceased.\n\nMyrkulytes viewed death with profound respect and took great care to help those who were dying feel as comfortable as possible,\n\n{{quote|''If you have ever caused the death of another, you dwell in Myrkul's shadow. Even in dying, you serve Myrkul and strengthen his kingdom. Thus, his worshippers and followers are everywhere.''|[[Koluhm Bonecutter]]}}",
        "Dogma": {
            "Beliefs": "They believed that death was an inevitability of life, an aspect that mortals should not attempt to flee. As such, they held the influence of the dead in extremely high regard.",
            "Attitudes": "While many Faerûnians openly made offerings to Myrkul out of fear, such as during funeral services or when honoring their dead, his clergy were more secretive in their worship. As was the common perception, these faithful were a reclusive and macabre lot who remained stoic, almost aloof, to their surroundings. They often concealed their pre-church lives from their fellow clergy and membership within the church from those outside. Yet there were some followers of Myrkul that sincerely romanticized the concept of death and joined due to their attraction to the teachings of Myrkul's high priests.",
            "Sayings": "\"The sacred hand that reaches from the grave\" - a phrase in reference to the sway the deceased had over the living."
        },
        "Activities": {
            "Studies": "Priests of Myrkul were experienced ''necrologists'', in that they spent much of their time studying lore regarding the [[undead]]. They were well-versed in their identification abilities."

        "Organization": {
            "Titles": "The titles within the church of Myrkul were tied to specific rituals and duties they performed upon ascension to that rank. In descending order they were: <br/>\n\n[[Elder Doom]] &bull; [[Deathbringer (Myrkul)|Deathbringer]] &bull; [[Withering Lord]] &bull; Undead Master &bull; [[Ritual Consecrator]] &bull; [[Bone Dancer]] &bull; Crypt Carver &bull; Shroud Wearer &bull; Bone Talker &bull; Night Walker &bull; Daring One",

        },
        "Rituals": {
            "Holy Days": "The church of Myrkul observed one day of remembrance that was linked to the [[calendar of Harptos]]. The [[Day the Dead are Most With Us]], which landed between the months of [[Uktar]] and [[Nightal]], was seen as the time of the year where the spirits of the dead would rise from the Underworld and float unseen across Toril. It was believed they would seek out their surviving loved ones and descendants, and leave silent messages to them throughout the day. Mykulytes would celebrate the dead with chants and hymns, culminating in the [[Flagons of the Fallen]] ritual which was performed at midnight."

        "Bases": {
            "Temples": "*[[Legacy of Deep Death]]: The only temple of Myrkul that was established after the Time of Troubles was established by three Myrkulyte [[lich]]es on the sea bed under the [[Sea of Swords]].\n\n*[[Skullspire]]: This massive spire in [[Tulmon]] was the meeting place of the [[Conclave of Doom]], serving as the training area for initiates and staging area for activities performed by the lesser clerics.\n\n*Temple of Myrkul in [[Undermountain]]: The temple that held the holy artifact, the ''[[Black Wand of Myrkul]]''. After Myrkul's death, the temple was mostly abandoned, with just a few loyal worshipers attending to the shrines inside. By [[1370 DR]], the temple was briefly torn between two factions trying to calm it. The followers of [[Kelemvor]] were trying to claim the temple as their deity inherited Myrkul's portfolio, and the [[Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar]] were attempting to convert it to their own religion."
        },
        "Items": {
            "Dress": "Priests of Myrkul wore black, hooded [[robe]]s, tied around the waist with a single white [[sash]]. While they always wore skull-shaped half-masks in public, they would show their faces and walk barefoot when within their temples. Any exposed skin would be concealed with ash. When venturing out in the Realms, they wore the finest [[armor]] underneath their hooded cloaks.",
            "Spells": "In addition to their proclivity for necromantic [[magic]], Myrkulytes had a few exclusive [[spell]]s: <br/>\n''[[Bone bite]]'' &bull; ''[[corrupt]]'' &bull; ''[[wither]]'' &bull; ''[[dolorous decay]]'' &bull; ''[[quench the spirit]]''",
            "Magic Items": "*''[[Black Wand of Myrkul]]'': The holy item that was wielded by the High Priests of Myrkul of the temple in [[Undermountain]]. The ''Black Wand'' held a sliver of the god's divinity. The ''wand'' was presumed destroyed in [[1368 DR]].\n*''[[Manyskull wand]]'': These were the favored [[magic]]al weapons of the Gray Ones."
        },
        "Relationships": "The various branches of Myrkulyte temples got along with one another quite well, as no individual had enough power to hold it over their fellow faithful.",
        "History": "While Myrkul himself ascended to godhood from a mortal life eons ago, the divinity was first encountered by his future initiates when a ''[[speak with dead]]'' [[spell]] was cast upon the head priest of some ancient temple. The Lord of the Dead conveyed his dogma through the vessel of the body. \n\nAfter the death of Myrkul in the [[Time of Troubles]], his divine domain was transferred by [[Ao]] to the newly-ascended [[Cyric]], or \"Cyruk\" as he was known to Myrkulytes. The stoic and largely-emotionless priests were unfazed by this change, and they offered no organized resistance or any emotional reaction. A [[1368 DR|decade later]] when Cyric was defeated by [[Kelemvor]] in the [[City of Strife]],<ref> the transition of worship from the Myrkulyte-Cyricists to the new god of the dead was just as smooth of a transition. While some remnant Myrkul's energy was transferred into the nearby artifact, the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', for all intents and purposes, the church of Myrkul was considered dead by the people of Faerûn. \n\n{{Quote|\"(They were) merely changing the name on the letterhead and putting a purple sunburst around the skull outside the temples.\"|{{Small|[[Zeboaster]] \"the Still Alive-For Now\", on the conversion of Myrkulytes to Cyricists}}}}\n\nHowever, that which was dead could not truly die. After Myrkul's death, a temple in his name was constructed beneath the Sea of Swords, in the area where [[Midnight]] [[dimension door|cast away]] the brown miasma that was released upon the destruction of the deity's avatar. \n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]] Myrkul was restored as ''the Reaper'', the god of death who brought the souls he had claimed to Kelemvor, the god of the dead. Kelemvor would then judge the fate of the souls. There were few actual temples of Myrkul in the late 15{{th}} century, but nearly every human cemetery or mausoleum was engraved with Myrkul's [[holy symbol]]."
