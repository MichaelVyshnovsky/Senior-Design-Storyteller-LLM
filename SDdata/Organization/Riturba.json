If I had killed him with a [[dagger]] in the back, I should surely have hung. Instead, I run him through before two dozen witnesses and am reckoned to be a gentleman.''|[[Gilberto Ilégo]]}}",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1217 DR]] House Riturba fell on hard times, and they loaned a significant sum of [[ducat]]s from Gilberto Ilégo, a [[Blade Captain]] from a major Blade House of Sumbria. Ilégo was a cold, power-hungry, and cruel man. The Blade Captain foreclosed on House Riturba's loan, s deed that caused outrage. House Riturba accused Gilberto Ilégo of being a contemptible cheat, in response, Ilégo challenged the young noble Riturba accuser to a duel.\n\nThe duel took place during the [[Blade Festival]] that followed one of the Blade Kingdoms' annual \"white wars.\" The Riturba youth was no match for a master duelist. The youth fenced using a [[rapier]] and a [[buckler]], while Gilberto Ilégo used a rapier and a short [[swordbreaker]]. The House Riturba nobleman was slain in the duel, surrounded by witnesses and overseen by a gray-bearded umpire."
