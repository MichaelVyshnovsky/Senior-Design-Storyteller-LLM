Ilégo was a cold, power-hungry, and cruel man. The Blade Captain foreclosed on House Riturbas loan, s deed that caused outrage. House Riturba accused Gilberto Ilégo of being a contemptible cheat, in response, Ilégo challenged the young noble Riturba accuser to a duel.\nThe duel took place during the Blade Festival that followed one of the Blade Kingdoms annual \"white wars.\" The Riturba youth was no match for a master duelist. The youth fenced using a rapier and a buckler, while Gilberto Ilégo used a rapier and a short swordbreaker. The House Riturba nobleman was slain in the duel, surrounded by witnesses and overseen by a gray-bearded umpire."
