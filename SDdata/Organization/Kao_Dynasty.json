        "mainbody": "The '''Kao Dynasty''' (meaning \"the High Dynasty\") was a dynasty of the empire of [[Shou Lung]] that lasted from [[-225 DR|Shou Year 1025 (−225 DR)]] to [[800 DR|Shou Year 2050 (800 DR)]].",
        "History": "In [[-225 DR|Shou Year 1025 (−225 DR)]], [[Wo Mai]], a noble who claimed descent from the first emperor [[Nung Fu]] himself, retrieved the [[Emblems of Imperial Authority]] from the crypts under the [[Imperial City]]. He rallied the armies and nobles to his cause and put down rebellions in the outer provinces of Shou Lung. Wo Mai was coronated as the first [[Emperor Chin]] of the Kao Dynasty, thus ending the [[Black Cycle of Years]].\n\nWo Mai, now called Chin Hu, opted to expunge various records of the past dynasty, as was a dynastic founder's prerogative. Chin Hu was quoted by scribes as saying \"All knowledge must come from my rule, as all streams come from the mountain fastness.\"<ref group=\"note\">Page 3 of ''[[Ochimo: The Spirit Warrior]]'' names the first emperor of the Kao Dynasty as Chin Hu, but page 4 names him Wo Mai. All Shou Lung emperors adopt the name \"Chin\" while they reign, but it is unclear where \"Hu\" comes from.\n\nIn [[-178 DR|Shou Year 1072 (−178 DR)]], the second Emperor Chin of the Kao Dynasty was crowned and decreed the [[Spreading of Knowledge]], also called the [[Opening of Wa]]. This demanded that the people of [[Wa]] be pacified and instilled with Shou customs. Wa's war-torn and fractious [[daimyo]]s acquiesced.<ref name=tGHotR-p54>\n\nFollowing the [[Invasion of the Horse Barbarians]], the fifth Emperor Chin of the Kao Dynasty and an army mostly recruited from [[T'u Lung]] routed them in the [[Battle of the Silver Grasslands]] in [[80 DR|Shou Year 1330 (80 DR)]].\n\nAfter Shou forces were driven from [[Wa]] two years before, and facing defeat there, the twelfth Emperor Chin of the Kao Dynasty instead decreed [[The Unleashing of Shackles]] in [[253 DR|Shou Year 1503 (253 DR)]], formally recognizing Wa as an independent state. The remnants of the [[Grey Blossom Regiment|Regiment of the Grey Blossom]] were withdrawn. In the Imperial City, monuments were erected depicting the emperor as a wonderful and wise emancipator of noble foreign peoples.\n\nIn [[511 DR|Shou Year 1761 (511 DR)]], the sixteenth Emperor Chin of the Kao Dynasty decreed [[The Revealing of Scrolls]], which encouraged intellectual discussion and the founding of many rival schools. This triggered a golden age for astronomy, alchemy, and [[geomancy]]. Meanwhile, missionary priests of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] were sent out to far-flung lands such as [[Kozakura]] to establish shrines.\n\nIn [[800 DR|Shou Year 2050 (800 DR)]], the last Emperor Chin of the Kao Dynasty and his family died in a fire that razed the then Imperial City. This was the end of Kao Dynasty. [[Ton Bor]], the emperor's third cousin, was named the first Emperor Chin of a new dynasty, known as the [[La Dynasty]].",
        "Influence": "The Kao Dynasty exerted Shou cultural and military influence into the eastern borders of the [[Hordelands]] and the nations of [[southeast Faerûn]].\n\nThe Kao treated all nations under their influence as vassal states. If these states paid their tribute and obeyed all laws of the [[Shou]], then the Kao left them to their own will.\n\nHowever, the cultural influence of the Shou had a more profound effect upon the tribes of the [[Endless Wastes]], resulting in strong \"eastern\" trends in weaponry, language, and magic.",
