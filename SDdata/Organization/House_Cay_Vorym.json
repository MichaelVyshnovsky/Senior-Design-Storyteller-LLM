        "mainbody": "House CayVorym was a notable Lolthite drow house of the city of Sschindylryn in the 15 century DR. They had a particular interest in gladiatorial combat, gambling, and entertainment.\nCayVorym preferred not to get directly involved in risky activities. They operated the CayVorym Fighting Pit and Underdark Arena near Sschindylryn, where they managed gladiatorial combat bouts between professional contestants, prisoners, and wild beasts.\nDuring the Darkening in the mid-1480s DR, House CayVorym mostly stayed out of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar led by other houses, with the exception of raids upon the dryadic Great Tree. The drow assault allowed the mass capture of surfacers from Cormyr, and while many were handled as slaves by House Avithoul some ended up in the hands of CayVorym. These Purple Dragons, War Wizards, and other folk were given the fate of fighting in the CayVorym arenas for the entertainment of their customers.\nAlthough their involvement was less obvious than that of Avithoul, Szind, and DunRobar, CayVorym and their abuse of Cormyrean prisoners was discerned by the scholar Sorina Parnock. She sent a team to their secret fighting pits in the Underdark near Sschindylryn with the mission of rescuing any Purple Dragons there and dismantling the whole operation. On arrival, the CayVorym guards and agents regarded the surfacers with a mixture of curiosity and professionalism, treating them more as customers than a threat. However, the master of the arena Feryl CayVorym simply dumped the captives and rescuers into the pit, forcing them to fight against various threats for the entertainment of the crowd. Things went awry when Feryls attempts at attracting purple worms drew up the massive and unmanageable worm Sineater, which tore apart the arena, devoured most of the paying customers in the crowd, and then ate both Feryl and the surfacers. After a fraught battle in the worms guts, the surfacers eventually cut their way out with Feryls special blade earthcarver and slew it, though not after it had thoroughly demolished the CayVorym business and fulfilled the Cormyrean objectives for them.\nDuring the invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15 century DR, the house included the following notable drow\n* Feryl CayVorym, master of the fighting pit.\n* Pelree CayVorym, house purser.\n* Zeslyn CayVorym, gate guard.\nProminent servants and agents of the house included\n* Djir Garpeth, duergar arena recruiter.\n* Azenaar, drider arena master."
