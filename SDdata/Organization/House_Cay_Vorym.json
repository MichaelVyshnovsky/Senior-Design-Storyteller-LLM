Then we'll see about freeing up these caravans again.\n|High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]]'s missive\n}}": "=Activities==",

        "History": "During the [[Darkening]] in the mid-1480s DR, House Cay'Vorym mostly stayed out of the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] led by other houses, with the exception of raids upon the [[dryad]]ic [[Great Tree]]. The drow assault allowed the mass capture of surfacers from Cormyr, and while many were handled as slaves by [[House Avithoul]] some ended up in the hands of Cay'Vorym. These [[Purple Dragons]], [[War Wizards]], and other folk were given the fate of fighting in the Cay'Vorym arenas for the entertainment of their customers.\n\nAlthough their involvement was less obvious than that of [[Avithoul]], [[Szind]], and [[Dun'Robar]], Cay'Vorym and their abuse of Cormyrean prisoners was discerned by the scholar [[Sorina Parnock]]. She sent a team to their secret fighting pits in the [[Underdark]] near Sschindylryn with the mission of rescuing any Purple Dragons there and dismantling the whole operation. On arrival, the Cay'Vorym guards and agents regarded the surfacers with a mixture of curiosity and professionalism, treating them more as customers than a threat. However, the master of the arena [[Feryl Cay'Vorym]] simply dumped the captives and rescuers into the pit, forcing them to fight against various threats for the entertainment of the crowd. Things went awry when Feryl's attempts at attracting [[purple worm]]s drew up the massive and unmanageable worm [[Sineater]], which tore apart the arena, devoured most of the paying customers in the crowd, and then ate both Feryl and the surfacers. After a fraught battle in the worm's guts, the surfacers eventually cut their way out with Feryl's special blade ''[[earthcarver]]'' and slew it, though not after it had thoroughly demolished the Cay'Vorym business and fulfilled the Cormyrean objectives for them.",
        "Members": "During the invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the house included the following notable drow:\n\n* [[Feryl Cay'Vorym]], master of the fighting pit.\n* [[Pelree Cay'Vorym]], house purser.\n* [[Zeslyn Cay'Vorym]], gate guard.\n\nProminent servants and agents of the house included:\n* [[Djir Garpeth]], [[duergar]] arena recruiter.\n* [[Azena'ar]], [[drider]] arena master."
