House Faen Tlabbar was a drow house of Menzoberranzan.
House Faen Tlabbar was based in a large castle of dark stone. It was one of the largest houses not on the plateau of Quellarzorl. It was located along the southern wall and had tall spires. It was defended by lizard-mounted guards who wielded crossbows and lances. However, the house had a blind spot in its connection to the roof.
House Faen Tlabbar was protected by a spell of forbidding. Something that the guards wore allowed them passage. The doors of the house were made of pale zurkhwood. There was a large hall which included studies, parlors, and trophy rooms. The floor was shiny black marble. There was a shrine to Lolth at the end with a large double door the shrine itself was a dome encrusted with gems. The chapel had a guardian demon resembling a skeleton covered in green flames with a flowing scimitar.
House Faen Tlabbar was considered to be one of the most fanatical of all the drow houses of Menzoberranzan.
In 1358 DR, Matron Mother Ghennitiroth Tlabbar was killed by Kyorl Odran.
Some time prior to 1372 DR, the human sorceress and psionicist Smylla Nathos dwelt with House Faen Tlabbar. Smylla grew sick however and her hosts divine healing powers couldnt help her. They believed that this was a curse from Lolth and tried to have Smylla assassinated but the human survived. The House spread the rumor that they had grown tired of her novelty and cast her out to save face.
To secure an alliance with House Agrach Dyrr during the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin snuck into the house chapel and slew both Matron Mother Ghenni Tlabbar and her daughter Silzet. The fifth daughter, Vadalma, was also present but survived and became the next matron mother.
House Melarn tried to forge an alliance with House Faen Tlabbar due to the religious devotion of both Houses in 1480 DR. Such was Matron Vadalmas hatred for House Melarn however, that although she did not outright refuse their offer for political reasons, neither did she accept.
In 1297 DR, Faen Tlabbar was the seventh house. They ascended to sixth after the destruction of House DeVir. By 1328 DR, thanks to the destruction of House Hunett and House Hrost Uluar, they had ascended to 4th. When House Oblodra was destroyed after the Time of Troubles, they replaced them as 3rd but then, after the Spellplague, House Xorlarrin became more powerful and took over as third house, forcing Faen Tlabbar back to fourth. In 1484 DR, House Faen Tlabbar retook their place as the third house after House Xorlarrin left the city for QXorlarrin.
