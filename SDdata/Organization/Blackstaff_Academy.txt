Blackstaff Academy was a loosely organized group of elite apprentices and students who studied under the Blackstaff at Blackstaff Tower in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
The Blackstaff served as the master/mistress of the school, under whom trained senior apprentices who were responsible for most of the day-to-day running of the academy, including the conducting of lessons for junior students, as well as the defense of the Academy against monsters and hostile mages.
The school trained wizards and sorcerers who sought to learn from the Blackstaff,
Studying under the purview of the Blackstaff offered students access to some rare or even unique spells designed by the Blackstaff or other notable members of the Academy, including blackstaff, Khelbens dweomerdoom, Khelbens suspended silence, Laerals cutting hand, and Laerals silver lance.
It was a priority to make sure that no student was treated badly or was not given the opportunity to keep busy with studies. This was done to ensure that graduates would continue to regard the Academy as allies, and so even when an apprentice decided to leave, the Academy helped them to establish themselves in their new endeavors. As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, this strategy had proven to be effective at minimizing any treachery within the school.
The Academy operated out of Blackstaff Tower, These areas included multiple libraries and laboratories.
The role of protecting the Tower fell to the senior apprentices, who were always well-trained in defensive magics.
The school was founded following the arrival of Laeral Silverhand to live at Blackstaff Tower with the original Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun, in the . Magic practitioners flocked to seek apprenticeship under the two legendary mages, and as those apprentices took on their own students in turn, they formed an elite yet makeshift and informal school that came to be known as Blackstaff Academy. In those initial years, Khelben and Laeral held the titles of master and mistress of the school. and as of the , Laeral had assumed most of the administrative duties of the Academy, which boasted 54 students and apprentices.
Wizards continued to train with the Academy after Khelbens death and into the late 15 century DR when Vajra Safahr took up the mantle of Blackstaff in the . and made it her mission to see the Academy become the center of magical studies in Faer√ªn, even pursuing multiple plans at once to make this a reality. She was known to roam the Academy wearing magically silent boots, which allowed her both to avoid disrupting the apprentices studies or to make a sudden appearance for a pop quiz or to provide crucial insight. She was rumored to invite particularly talented apprentices to read and copy spells from her own spellbook, and sometimes extended the even greater honor of having them add a spell of their own invention to it.
At one point during Laeral Silverhands tenure as Open Lord of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR, a group of adventurers in her service recovered a sample of Frostsilver armor from Frostsilver Mines, and sent it to the Academy at Laerals behest in hopes that the students would be able to learn its secrets.
The school was made up of an everchanging roster of about fifty apprentices and students to the Blackstaff, with new arrivals always ready to replenish the ranks as graduates moved on.
Acceptance to the Academy was predicated on either demonstrating extraordinary magical aptitude (those who could not cast arcane spells were very rarely admitted) or having a particularly compelling personal history. Joining the Academy was free, however monthly dues were required to continue attendance. These fees started at 10 gp per month and increased as a student gained seniority and required more advanced tutelage. In addition, it was a requirement that any new spell that was discovered or researched by an apprentice had to be added to Blackstaff Towers library.
