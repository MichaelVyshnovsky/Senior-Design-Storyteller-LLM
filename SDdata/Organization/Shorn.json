        "mainbody": "he Shorn was a group of cultists inhabiting the ruined city of Moradask on the Sea of Salt in the Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara circa 1367 DR.\nA mystic from Talab named Saib al-Banu once experienced a vision while adventuring through the jungles of the Cities of the Ancients. In this vision the Gods of the Pantheon inferred that having hair was a filthy trait and to be closer to the gods one needed to shave all the hair from their body. Saib preached this new belief system, called the Path of the Shorn in Talab to anyone who would listen. He eventually gathered a strong following but was exiled from the city for smuggling weapons. Saib and his followers began calling themselves the Shorn.\nThe Shorn eventually settled in Moradask after Saib followed another cryptic vision. It was here that Saib discovered the Temple of Ishistu in the catacombs beneath the ruined city. Ishistu was a living idol who appeared as a large hairless rat and promised protection in exchange for sacrifices that came in the form of laying their hair upon an altar. Some of the Shorn were hesitant at first, but Ishistus power grew with each sacrifice.\nThe Shorn were led by Imam Saib al-Banu in 1367 DR."
