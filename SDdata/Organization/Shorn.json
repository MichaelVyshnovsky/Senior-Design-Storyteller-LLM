        "History": "A [[Mystic (Zakhara)|mystic]] from [[Talab]] named [[Sa'ib al-Banu]] once experienced a vision while adventuring through the jungles of the [[Cities of the Ancients]]. In this vision the [[Gods of the Pantheon]] inferred that having hair was a filthy trait and to be closer to the gods one needed to shave all the hair from their body. Sa'ib preached this new belief system, called the [[Path of the Shorn]] in Talab to anyone who would listen. He eventually gathered a strong following but was exiled from the city for smuggling weapons. Sa'ib and his followers began calling themselves the Shorn.\n\nThe Shorn eventually settled in Moradask after Sa'ib followed another cryptic vision. It was here that Sa'ib discovered the [[Temple of Ishistu]] in the catacombs beneath the ruined city. Ishistu was a [[living idol]] who appeared as a large hairless rat and promised protection in exchange for sacrifices that came in the form of laying their hair upon an altar. Some of the Shorn were hesitant at first, but Ishistu's power grew with each sacrifice.",
        "Organization": "The Shorn were led by Imam Sa'ib al-Banu in 1367 DR."
