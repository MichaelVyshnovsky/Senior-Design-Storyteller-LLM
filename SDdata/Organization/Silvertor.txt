'''Silvertor''' was among the oldest [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble houses]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the early 14{{th}} century DR, but as of 1368 DR it was no longer considered nobility.<ref group="note">No other source on Waterdeep, such as ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)|City of Splendors]]'', lists the Silvertors amongst the Waterdhavian nobility, suggesting they disappeared, likely by the time of ''[[Waterdeep and the North]]'', [[1347 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1325}},<ref>{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} the young Lord [[Corin Silvertor]] had recently assumed the title after his father's passing, when he was lost on a hunting trip into [[Undermountain]] below Waterdeep. The [[half-orc]] thief [[Artek Ar'talen]], called 'the Knife', was hired by Lord [[Darien Thal]] to rescue Lord Silvertor from Undermountain, and with the help of the wizard [[Beckla Shadesar]], they located the young nobleman, and the three of them battled their way through Undermountain.

==Members==
