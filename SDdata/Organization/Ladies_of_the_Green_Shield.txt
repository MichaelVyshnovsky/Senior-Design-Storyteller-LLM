The Ladies of the Green Shield was an adventuring company that operated in the Vast in the 1360s DR.
The Ladies of the Green Shield were all slain outside the city of Calaunt in Mirtul of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR. Some believed theyd happened upon a band of drow one evening, perhaps the same drow spotted lurking on the streets of Calaunt at nights.
