The '''Ladies of the Green Shield''' was an [[adventuring company]] that operated in [[the Vast]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

The Ladies of the Green Shield were all slain outside the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[Mirtul]] of the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]]. Some believed they'd happened upon a band of [[drow]] one evening, perhaps the same drow spotted lurking on the streets of Calaunt at nights.
