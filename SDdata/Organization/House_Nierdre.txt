'''House Nierdre''' was a [[sun elf]] house originally founded in [[Myth Drannor]].

==Base of Operations==
The house's estate in [[Leuthilspar]] was constructed from a rare and unusual shiny black stone. The house symbol was a silhouette of a [[black dragon]].

==History==
During the [[Weeping War]], only two of the house's members survived and escaped to the island of [[Evermeet]] where the house has gradually replenished its numbers. By [[1367 DR]], the house was led by Lord [[Maiele Nierdre]]. 

==Members==
;[[Maiele Nierdre]]: Leader of the house in 1367 DR.
