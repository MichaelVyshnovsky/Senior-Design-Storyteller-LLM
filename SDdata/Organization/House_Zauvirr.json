It operated the storehouses of the Black Claw Mercantile Company, which was owned by House Melarn and the Menzoberranyr House Baenre.\nIn 1372 DR, House Zauvirr attempted to defeat House Melarn. Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr hired the duergar mercenary band Clan Xornbane to assist. She took over the Black Claw storehouses, killing Matron Mother Drisinil Melarn. Ssipriinas daughter, Faeryl Zauvirr, also betrayed Quenthel Baenre and her protector Jeggred by leading the two to her mother to be captured.\nHowever, Clan Xornbane was given the direction to attack House Melarn prematurely. Their stonefire bombs contributed to chaos in the city. Angry at the disruption to her plans, Ssiipriina turned on them, killing the leader of the clan, Khorrl Xornbane, and causing the rest of the band to flee. However, the duergars stonefire (as part of a Jaezred Chaulssin plot directed by Zammzt) rapidly destroyed the city.\n* Ssipriina Zauvirr, matron mother in 1372 DR.\n* Faeryl Zauvirr, ambassador to Menzoberranzan from ca. 1358 DR to 1372 DR.\n* Merinid, former weapons master.
