        "Description": "House Zauvirr was a minor merchant house of Ched Nasad. It operated the storehouses of the [[Black Claw Mercantile Company]], which was owned by [[House Melarn (Ched Nasad)|House Melarn]] and the [[Menzoberranzan|Menzoberranyr]] [[House Baenre]].",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], House Zauvirr attempted to defeat House Melarn. Matron Mother [[Ssipriina Zauvirr]] hired the [[duergar]] mercenary band [[Clan Xornbane]] to assist. She took over the Black Claw storehouses, killing Matron Mother [[Drisinil Melarn]]. Ssipriina's daughter, [[Faeryl Zauvirr]], also betrayed [[Quenthel Baenre]] and her protector [[Jeggred Baenre|Jeggred]] by leading the two to her mother to be captured.\n\nHowever, Clan Xornbane was given the direction to attack House Melarn prematurely. Their [[stonefire]] bombs contributed to chaos in the city. Angry at the disruption to her plans, Ssiipriina turned on them, killing the leader of the clan, [[Khorrl Xornbane]], and causing the rest of the band to flee. However, the duergar's stonefire (as part of a [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] plot directed by [[Zammzt]]) rapidly destroyed the city.",
