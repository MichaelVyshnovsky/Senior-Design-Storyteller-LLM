'''Her Majesty's Reconnaissance Team''' was a group of [[adventurer]]s based in the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The group was originally organized to help a noblewoman retrieve family heirlooms lost in [[Netheril]]. Upon her death a curse fell upon the group, slowly killing them off at a rate of one member per year.  

==Members==
By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR only a handful of the original seventeen members were still alive. [[Cadogan]] of Daggerford was one such individual.
