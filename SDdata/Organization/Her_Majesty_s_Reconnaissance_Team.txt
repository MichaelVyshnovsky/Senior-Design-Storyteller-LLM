Her Majestys Reconnaissance Team was a group of adventurers based in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The group was originally organized to help a noblewoman retrieve family heirlooms lost in Netheril. Upon her death a curse fell upon the group, slowly killing them off at a rate of one member per year.  
By the mid-to-late 14 century DR only a handful of the original seventeen members were still alive. Cadogan of Daggerford was one such individual.
