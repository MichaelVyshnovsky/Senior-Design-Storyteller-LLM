        "mainbody": "The Unclaimed was the personal memoir of a Sharran priestess who surrendered all of her memories to the Lady of Loss before entering into the afterlife.\nThe tome shared the tale of the devout priestess of Shar during existence in the City of Judgement after her death. After spending her life ridding herself of memories and attachments—in accordance with Shars doctrine—the priestess succumbed to death and waited for eternity to be claimed by Shars embrace.\nShar never appeared before the unnamed priestess and offered no guidance nor final destination for her soul. Immeasurable time passed by as the Sharran faithful remained unclaimed by her goddess, to the point where even the Lord of the Dead Kelemvor took pity on her."
