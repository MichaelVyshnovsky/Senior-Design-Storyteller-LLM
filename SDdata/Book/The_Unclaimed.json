After spending her life ridding herself of memories and attachments—in accordance with Shar's doctrine—the priestess succumbed to death and waited for eternity to be claimed by Shar's embrace.\n\nShar never appeared before the unnamed priestess and offered no guidance nor final destination for her soul. Immeasurable time passed by as the Sharran faithful remained unclaimed by her goddess, to the point where even the Lord of the Dead [[Kelemvor]] took pity on her."
