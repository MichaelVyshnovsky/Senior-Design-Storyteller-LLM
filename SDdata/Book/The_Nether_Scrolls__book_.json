        "mainbody": "'''''The Nether Scrolls''''' was a history book that collected scarce knowledge on the legendary [[Netheril|Netherese]] magics  and the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'', published before [[1372 DR]].",
        "Contents": "The book described the discovery of the ancient writings known as the Nether Scrolls by an unnamed adventurer. The book listed the arcane knowledge that was hidden within the Scrolls. It claimed that many of them have been lost or solved over the two thousand years of their existence.\n\nThe second part of the book talked about many forms of magic developed by the ancient empire of Netheril, namely by the [[wizard]] [[Ioulaum]] who invented ''[[mythallar]]'' magic.\n\nIn conclusion, the book briefly touched upon the politics and interactions between Netheril and other races and civilizations that existed at the time.",
        "History": "Copies of ''The Nether Scrolls'' book could be found around the areas of [[Neverwinter]], [[Daggerford]], and the [[Sword Coast North]]  ''circa'' 1372 DR."
