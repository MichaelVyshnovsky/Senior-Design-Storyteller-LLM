        "mainbody": "The Throne of Bloodstone is a 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure that was set in the Forgotten Realms.\nThe Throne of Bloodstone was written by Douglas Niles and Michael Dobson, with a cover by Keith Parkinson and interior art was by Graham Nolan, and was published by TSR in 1988 as a 96-page book. \nThis module is part four of four, though it is not required to have played the previous three modules. While this is the fourth adventure in the Bloodstone pass saga, and the second that sets the saga in the Forgotten Realms, it is the first publication that bears the official Forgotten Realms logo.\nAt 96 pages the module is larger than was common at the time of publication and is the longest in the Bloodstone Saga. It comes in a loose cardboard cover the maps are not printed on the inside but in the book itself, and on a foldout poster. \nThis module is recommended for characters between levels 18 and 100. The wide range of levels the module is for is dealt with in several ways as well as the general principles described above for dealing with 100th level characters. For some encounters either the number and/or type of opponents vary or the NPCs reaction to the characters vary depending on the total level of the party. Some areas in the module like the city of liches or the city of 100,000 demons, are really too difficult for any party to overcome directly and require approaches other than brute force. \nThe Throne of Bloodstone includes two sets of pre-generated characters. The first set is the same seven characters that have run through the Bloodstone Saga, most of which are now 19th level. The second set are based on great characters of mythology and all have at least one class at 100th level. These characters, who are much more powerful than the versions appearing in the Legends & Lore are Perseus, Circe, Hermes and Artemis. \nIn The Throne of Bloodstone, the player characters go to the Abyss to steal the powerful wand from Orcus. They play the rulers of Bloodstone Pass. A war against the Witch-King of Vaasa has come to a standstill. The players venture into the Abyss, destroy a mighty demon, steal the Wand of Orcus and take it to the Seven Heavens to be destroyed.\nThe battle between the mighty undead army of the Witch-King of Vaasa and the forces of Bloodstone has come to a standstill. As long as the source of the Witch-Kings power is at work, his evil forces will never be defeated! This module requires the player characters, as the rulers of Bloodstone Pass if following the series, to find the true power behind the Witch-King and defeat it.\nThe module requires the players to journey to the Abyss, confront Orcus, one of its greatest demons, steal the Wand of Orcus, and destroy it. \n* Introduction\n* Running 100th-Level Characters\n* Prologue\n* Chapter 1 Citadel of the Witch-King\n* Chapter 2 Into the Abyss\n* Chapter 3 Realm of the Undead\n* Chapter 4 The Abyssian Fortress\n* Chapter 5 Into the Seven Heavens\n* Epilogue Return to Bloodstone Pass\n* People of Bloodstone Pass\n* Pregenerated Player Characters\n* Pregenerated 100th-Level Characters\n* Mazes\n* Cover Maps for the Palace of Orcus\n* City Maze of Orcusgate\n* Battle Arena\nFyrillicusGlyphimhorOrcusZhengyi\nCastle Perilous\n)\nThe Throne of Bloodstone Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Design Douglas Niles, Michael Dobson\n* Editing Mike Breault\n* Cover Art Keith Parkinson\n* Interior Art Graham Nolan\n* Cartography David C.
