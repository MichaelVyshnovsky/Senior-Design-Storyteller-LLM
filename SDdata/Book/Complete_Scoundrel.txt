{{Quote|'''''Fair Fights are for Suckers'''

''In a world filled with monsters and villains, a little deception and boldness goes a long way. You know how to take advantage of every situation, and you don’t mind getting your hands dirty. Take the gloves off? Ha! You never put them on. You infuriate your foes and amaze your allies with your ingenuity, resourcefulness, and style. For you, every new predicament is an opportunity in disguise, and with each sweet victory your notoriety grows. That is how legends are made.''

''This D&D supplement gives you everything you need to get the drop on your foes and escape sticky situations. In addition to new feats, spells, items, and prestige classes, ''Complete Scoundrel'' presents new mechanics that put luck on your side and a special system of skill tricks that allow any character to play the part of a scoundrel. Tricky tactics aren't just for [[rogue]]s anymore.''}}

==Description==
''Complete Scoundrel'' provides feats, prestige classes, 49 new spells, and other options for characters interested in playing trickster characters. It has introduced the idea of Skill tricks, which are feat-like character moves that cost skill points to learn and may only be used once per encounter.

The accessory introduces thirteen new prestige classes: Avenging Executioner, Battle Trickster, Cloaked Dancer, Combat Trapsmith, Fortunes's Friend, Gray Guard, Magical Trickster, Malconvoker, Master Of Masks, Mountebank, Psibond Agent, Spellwarp Sniper, and the Uncanny Trickster.

Some of the feats in this book have been specialized for the Sneak attack. There are also Luck feats, which give the character a reroll on certain actions in order to get a better result. There are also Bardic Music feats, which give the bard the option to use up one of his daily bard performance in order to gain specific effects.
