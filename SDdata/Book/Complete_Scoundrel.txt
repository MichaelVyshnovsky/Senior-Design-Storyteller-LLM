Complete Scoundrel provides feats, prestige classes, 49 new spells, and other options for characters interested in playing trickster characters. It has introduced the idea of Skill tricks, which are feat-like character moves that cost skill points to learn and may only be used once per encounter.
The accessory introduces thirteen new prestige classes Avenging Executioner, Battle Trickster, Cloaked Dancer, Combat Trapsmith, Fortuness Friend, Gray Guard, Magical Trickster, Malconvoker, Master Of Masks, Mountebank, Psibond Agent, Spellwarp Sniper, and the Uncanny Trickster.
Some of the feats in this book have been specialized for the Sneak attack. There are also Luck feats, which give the character a reroll on certain actions in order to get a better result. There are also Bardic Music feats, which give the bard the option to use up one of his daily bard performance in order to gain specific effects.
