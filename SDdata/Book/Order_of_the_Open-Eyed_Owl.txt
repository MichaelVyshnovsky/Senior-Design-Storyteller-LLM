Order of the Open-Eyed Owl was a renowned play, penned sometime in or before the mid-13 century DR.
Order of the Open-Eyed Owl was a play about knights and by the mid-14 century DR, undamaged copies of the playbook were valued at twenty gold pieces. A copy of the play was preserved within the once-wondrous Bard Keep, a temple and library dedicated to Oghma, that fell into ruin in the mid-13 century DR. The book was stored within the Concert Hall and hid a page with the Dethek "O" rune, part of the set that was required to control the Keeps moving rooms.
