'''''Planescape: Torment''''' is a ''[[Planescape Campaign Setting|Planescape]]'' novel by Ray and Valerie Vallese, first published in November 1999. It is loosely based on the story of the [[Planescape: Torment|video game by the same name]].<ref group="note">There is an additional novel written by Rhys Hess that was packaged with some releases of the game as an unofficial extra and never published as a standalone book. Unlike the Ray and Valerie Vallese one, it was created by assembling the dialogue from the descriptions and dialogues from the video game, and is much closer to the canon confirmed by later Forgotten Realms and Planescape media. 

{{Quote|''An Eternal War''

''The endless [[Blood War]] rages, a never-ending battle between the fiends of the planes. Amid this horrific conflict, a single hero with no memory of his past seeks to discover his true identity.''

''Of course, this being the planes, his companions on his quest are ... unusual. But if you can't trust a floating skull, an eccentric investor, and a succubus, who can you trust?''

''Practically no one.''

''Based on the best-selling computer game from Interplay.''}}
