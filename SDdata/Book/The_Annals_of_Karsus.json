        "mainbody": "The Annals of Karsus was a legendary tome of knowledge penned by Karsus, the Momentary God, before the fall of Netheril.\nThe book was ancient and hand-written. By the 15 century DR, the book had been rebounded at least twice, with the latest cover adorned with the insignia of the Red Wizards of Thay. The entirety of the tome was a collection of notes written in Karsuss personal wizards cipher, except for the final page.\nThe legendary book was kept in magically secured and trapped vaults of Ramaziths Tower in the late 15 century DR, under the ownership of Athkatlan mage Lorroakan. The section of the vault was unimaginatively named after Karsus himself. A copy of the rare spell was tucked within the book â€“ the spell of dethrone."
