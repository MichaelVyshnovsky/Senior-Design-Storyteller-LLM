Dungeon Master Option High-Level Campaigns is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.
Dungeon Master Option High-Level Campaigns focuses on providing guidelines and rules for running campaigns that involve high-level characters, which usually means characters above the 10 level. It introduces new rules and options to enhance the gameplay experience for high-level characters. This includes more powerful spells, abilities, and equipment suitable for these experienced adventurers.
The book provides advice and ideas for creating adventures and challenges that are appropriately scaled for high-level characters.
