        "mainbody": "Prayers to Umgatlik was a collection of religious sermons by and for worshipers of the ancient Netherese lich Umgatlik.\nThe tome was dedicated to keeping the worship of Umgatlik alive and preparing his cult for the lichs return to Toril. The readers were encouraged to weather any and all strife because, in the end, they were to be rewarded by their \"deity.\" The prayers recorded in the book talked about the lich rising once again, bringing blessings and greatness. These orisons talked about the cult staying in the shadows and growing in power as their enemies wilted and died.\nIt was unknown how much organized following Umgatlik retained by the late 14 century DR, but at least one follower was still in existence in the . A copy of Prayers to Umgatlik could be recovered from the \"deitys\" lost shrine, encrusted by the deadly cliffs of the Crabs Claw Coast."
