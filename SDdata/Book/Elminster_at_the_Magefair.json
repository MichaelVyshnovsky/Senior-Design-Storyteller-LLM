        "Summary": "This short story chronicles a visit by [[Elminster]], accompanied by [[Storm Silverhand]], to a [[magefair]] in [[1336 DR]].\n\nAt the magefair, Elminster searches for a key, which he receives surreptitiously through a kiss by a new [[Harper]], [[Duara]]. A man searching for the key accosts Elminster and takes his staff, which he assumes is the key. Elminster in turn challenges him to a ''[[fireball]]''-throwing contest and wins hands down with an incredibly impressive display. Elminster and Storm then return to the [[Twisted Tower]] in [[Shadowdale]], where the Old Mage reveals that the key belonged to his closet and had been stolen by one of his brief apprentices named [[Raerlin]]. Upon opening the closet, the pair comes face to face with Raelin, who has become a [[lich]]. A spell battle ensues, with Storm defeating the lich by burning the pages of a tome (possibly its [[phylactery]]). When [[Lhaeo]] returns with tea, all is well again, even if the combatants are a little singed.",
