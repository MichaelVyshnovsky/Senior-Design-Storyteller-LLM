        "mainbody": "The Book of Bats was an ancient spellbook of uncertain origin that contained a number of uncommon arcane and divine spells.\nThis was a tall and narrow tome, measuring approximately three handwidths wide and nine handwidths tall. All 22 pages were made from polished electrum and these were etched and stamped with the scripts and symbols of spell-craft, with each page containing a different spell. The front and rear covers of the book were plates made of sealed and blackened oak and these bound with the tattered leathery hides and wings of real bats of large size, many of which still contained their claws. These of course gave it a gruesome appearance.\nThe origin and creator of the Book of Bats were unknown. Though the book held spells from the early wizards Beltyn and Shaeroon, it was possibly put together quite some time after their deaths. The first recorded sighting of the Book of Bats was in Calimshan around 1147 DR, where it was a part of a satraps treasures.This was \"some two hundred and ten winters ago\" from an assumed date of 1357 for The Magister.\nAfter that, the book changed hands surprisingly many times over its history, often by thievery or force as one mage or minor ruler after killed the prior owner.\nAt one point, the merchant Chulu Thall of Ithmong somehow acquired the Book of Bats and sold it to the mage Khondall Sszundar. But he had it but briefly before an unknown enemy dispatched demons that demolished his tower, and the tome was lost. Shortly after, the Book of Bats resurfaced in Innarlith, then was swiftly stolen.\nCirca 1357 DR, the archmage Malharduu apparently purchased the tome and made arrangements to have it shipped to Tashluta. However, in summer, the ship carrying the book was looted by thieves before it could leave the dock in Calimport. The fate of the book remained unknown.This was \"last summer\". Its unclear if this is summer of 1356, of 1357, or of some other year.\nKhondall was able to catalog the tomes spells while it was under his care. The Book of Bats contained the following spells\ncensure &bull hold vapor &bull feign death &bull protection from good 10 radius &bull slow &bull Beltyns burning blood &bull dimension door &bull fear &bull polymorph other &bull wall of fire &bull animate dead &bull cloudkill &bull cone of cold &bull feeblemind &bull telekinesis &bull wall of iron &bull anti-magic shell &bull death spell &bull geas &bull invisible stalker &bull project image &bull blade of doom (here called Shaeroons scimitar)."
