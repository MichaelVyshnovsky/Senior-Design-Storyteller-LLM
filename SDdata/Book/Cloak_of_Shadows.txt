'''''Cloak of Shadows''''' is a novel by [[Ed Greenwood]] and the second book in [[The Shadow of the Avatar Trilogy]].

{{quote|''The [[Time of Troubles]] had arrived. The chaos of spilled blood, lawless strife, monsters unleashed, and [[avatar]]s roaming [[Faerûn]] had come.''

''But wrathful and warring gods were not Faerûn's only problem.''

''The dreaded and insidious [[malaugrym|Shadowmasters]] had seized the opportunity to increase their influence and power while [[Mystra]] and her minions were otherwise engaged. The Shadowmasters had woven a magical cloak of spells that would render the wearer invisible to their rival's magic.''

''The shadow over Faerûn spreads.''|[http://www.amazon.com/Cloak-Shadows-Forgotten-Realms-Shadow/dp/0786903015/ Amazon.com]}}

==Index==
===Characters===
:[[Arashta Tharbrow]] • [[Eldargh]] • [[Elminster]] • [[Masked One]] • [[Mystra]] • [[Ramtharage Druin]] • [[Thalart]] • [[Belkram Hardeth]] • [[Itharr Jathram]] • [[Sharantyr]] • [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]] • [[Storm Silverhand]] • [[Simbul]]

==Summary==
The [[Malaugrym]] sense the Time of Troubles and use it as an opportunity to destroy [[Elminster]], and the other [[Chosen of Mystra]]. The Chosen set an ambush, creating a false Elminster controlled by [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand|Syluné]] and watched over by [[Sharantyr]], [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]], and [[Belkram]]. The Malaugrym take the bait and attack, only for many of them to be destroyed by the [[Simbul]]. They begin to test the Cloak of Shadows, a creation made by Milhvar, one of their number who bound a priest of Mystra into an item created to hide them from magic. An aspect of Mystra appears to Sharantyr, guiding her to a tomb of the Elven Court, where she claims a sword to use against the Malaugrym. Elminster encounters [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]], but [[Ao]] intervenes to stop her from ascending too soon. While Elminster helps keep the peace across Faerun, the three rangers, along with Sylune, teleport to the [[Castle of Shadows]], slaying Milhvar and others and destroying the Shadow Throne. Elminster is trapped briefly by Milhvar but freed by his death.
