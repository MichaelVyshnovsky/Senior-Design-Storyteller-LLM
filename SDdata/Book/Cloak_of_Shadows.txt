The Malaugrym sense the Time of Troubles and use it as an opportunity to destroy Elminster, and the other Chosen of Mystra. The Chosen set an ambush, creating a false Elminster controlled by Syluné and watched over by Sharantyr, Itharr, and Belkram. The Malaugrym take the bait and attack, only for many of them to be destroyed by the Simbul. They begin to test the Cloak of Shadows, a creation made by Milhvar, one of their number who bound a priest of Mystra into an item created to hide them from magic. An aspect of Mystra appears to Sharantyr, guiding her to a tomb of the Elven Court, where she claims a sword to use against the Malaugrym. Elminster encounters Midnight, but Ao intervenes to stop her from ascending too soon. While Elminster helps keep the peace across Faerun, the three rangers, along with Sylune, teleport to the Castle of Shadows, slaying Milhvar and others and destroying the Shadow Throne. Elminster is trapped briefly by Milhvar but freed by his death.
