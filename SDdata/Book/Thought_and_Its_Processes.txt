'''''Thought and Its Processes''''' by [[Trelaphin]] was a nonfiction book published in [[Faerûn]]. It discussed logic, reasoning, and deduction.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}} It had one volume.

The retired [[War Wizard]] and sage [[Benelaius]] had a copy in his library at his home near [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]]. His servant [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] read it in [[1366]]/[[1367 DR]]. He dared to suggest that the deductions of the great detective [[Camber Fosrick]] in ''[[The Adventures of Camber Fosrick]]'' was "the same sort of thing" as in ''Thought and Its Processes'', which outraged Benelaius, who hated the Fosrick stories.

A copy was kept in [[Candlekeep]] around [[1372 DR]].
