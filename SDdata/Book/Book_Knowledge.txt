Book Knowledge is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.
Adventurers out of Undermountain recently sold a local sage a book detailing the history of the first three Green Regents. Bizarrely, it seems as though everyone who has come into contact with the book has vanished. The adventurers and the sage have all disappeared and the Sages wife wants him back.
