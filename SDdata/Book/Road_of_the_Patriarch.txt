{{quote|''"To her, to her dying breath, you were the untouchable one, the one whose flesh her dagger could not penetrate."''

''The Assassin''

''A cold and emotionless killer for whom every soul has a price, even his own, embarks on a path to find out just how high that price can be.''

''The Mercenary''

''A [[drow|dark elf]] of limitless guile dares to challenge a [[Gareth Dragonsbane|king]], and carve for himself a place in the inhospitable World Above.''

''[[Ilnezhara]] and [[Tazmikella]] are ancient dragons of great power, accustomed to easily manipulating the humans around them. But not all humans are so easily led. When they pushed [[Artemis Entreri|Entreri]] and [[Jarlaxle]] into the heart of the [[Bloodstone Lands]], not even they could have imagined the strength of the human assassin’s resolve, or the limitless expanse of the drow mercenary’s ambition.''}}

== Summary ==
[[Ilnezhara]] and [[Tazmikella]] have ceased their working relationships with [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Artemis Entreri|Artemis]]. The pair have attracted the attention of both the [[Citadel of Assassins]] (especially Entreri) and [[Spysong]]. Entreri is becoming more confused and self-reflective about himself which is complicated by the fact that he has taken [[Calihye]] as his lover. Jarlaxle is more interested in his surface empire, hoping to use the [[Zhengyi|Zhengyian construct]] as the center of his new realm. [[Athrogate]] the [[dwarf]] takes to spending the harsh [[Damara|Damaran]] winter drinking himself into a stupor, planning on resuming his monster hunting in the spring.
