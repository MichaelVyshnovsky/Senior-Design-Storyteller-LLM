Entreri is becoming more confused and self-reflective about himself which is complicated by the fact that he has taken Calihye as his lover. Jarlaxle is more interested in his surface empire, hoping to use the Zhengyian construct as the center of his new realm. Athrogate the dwarf takes to spending the harsh Damaran winter drinking himself into a stupor, planning on resuming his monster hunting in the spring.
