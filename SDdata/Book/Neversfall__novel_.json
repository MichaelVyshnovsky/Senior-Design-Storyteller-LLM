It was released on November 27, 2007.\n\n{{quote|''[[Neversfall (fortress)|Neversfall]] was supposed to be [[Estagund]]'s stronghold in the wilds of monster-ridden [[Veldorn]], an unassailable citadel to protect the southern lands. Then the regiment holding Neversfall disappeared, leaving no hint of what took them. The replacement forces find themselves attacked from both within and without the fortress's walls. Besieged by monsters and men, a mercenary captain and an elite warrior must work together to discover who their enemy really is.''}}",
