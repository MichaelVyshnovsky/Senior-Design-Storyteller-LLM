        "History": "By [[1492 DR]], ''Baldur's Bash'' was an established product that had accumulated some notoriety and reputation. The ''Bash'' supported the regulation on only allowing animals not bigger than a [[peacock]] into the city. This law was considered archaic by some â€” namely, Mr. [[R. Pickles]], a rich Balduran who owned a [[bear]] named [[Giselle]] and was infuriated that he could not keep his \"child\" in the Gate, forcing him to travel all the way to his summer home in [[Cormyr]] to spend time with the said well-behaved bear. Mister Pickles called for the law's review by the [[Parliament of Peers]] of Baldur's Gate, claiming that it negatively affected the psychological well-being of his fellow Baldurans. Furthermore, Mister Pickles blamed [[Grand Duke]] [[Ulder Ravengard]] for separating him from his bear-child."
