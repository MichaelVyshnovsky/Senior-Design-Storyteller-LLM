        "mainbody": "Baldurs Bash was a tabloid chapbook from Baldurs Gate, notorious for its scandalous and controversial writing.\nLike other periodicals of the Realms, Baldurs Bash was helmed by the editor.\nBy 1492 DR, Baldurs Bash was an established product that had accumulated some notoriety and reputation. The Bash supported the regulation on only allowing animals not bigger than a peacock into the city. This law was considered archaic by some â€” namely, Mr. R. Pickles, a rich Balduran who owned a bear named Giselle and was infuriated that he could not keep his \"child\" in the Gate, forcing him to travel all the way to his summer home in Cormyr to spend time with the said well-behaved bear. Mister Pickles called for the laws review by the Parliament of Peers of Baldurs Gate, claiming that it negatively affected the psychological well-being of his fellow Baldurans. Furthermore, Mister Pickles blamed Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard for separating him from his bear-child."
