        "mainbody": "'''''The Codicil of White''''' was a magical book containing basic rites, rituals, services, and major ceremonies of [[Auril]]'s faith. The book also had several pages devoted to the goddess' favorite arcane [[magic]].{{Cite dungeon/15/The Glass House|38}}{{Cite web/The Codicil of White}}",
        "Description": "''The Codicil of White'' was described as a tall, thin book bound between two planks of seasoned white pine with a spine of leather. The cover of the front, back, and spine was a single piece of white ermine fur sewn onto the pine boards, which showed signs of wear around the edges.\"The Glass House\" in ''Dungeon'' #15 and ''Pages from the Mages'' both incorrectly state this book has 27 pages. This number is the title page, plus 13 pages of minor rituals and 13 pages of major ceremonies, leaving no room for the spells at the end. The \"Magic Books of Faerûn\" article revises this to 40 pages. thirty-eight of which were vellum with silver-painted borders, sewn into the spine with laces of sinew. The text was written in dark blue [[ink]]. The last two pages were penned by a different hand, did not have the argent edges, and appeared to have been added after the book was created.\n\nThe book radiated a faint [[abjuration]] aura.",
        "Powers": "The book granted [[Resist fire or cold|cold resistance]] (as a ''[[ring of minor energy resistance]]'') to anyone carrying it on their person and was completely waterproof.",
        "Contents": "[[File:Symbol of Auril.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''The holy symbol of Auril.'']]\nThe first page declared the book's title and contained the holy symbol of Auril&mdash;a six-pointed snowflake outlined in white on a gray lozenge. The next thirteen pages described basic rites, rituals, and services of the [[church of Auril]], most of which [[good]]-[[alignment|aligned]] individuals would find abhorrent. Here was also found the proper phrases to use when summoning an [[ice para-elemental]].\n\nThe following thirteen pages dealt with major ceremonies of [[Auril]]'s faith, including dedication of holy sites, ordination of priests, burial rites, a coming of age ceremony, investiture and transfer of authority, and ceremonial vows for services and contracts.\n\nThe remainder of the pages were all devoted to arcane spellcasters and could be used as a spellbook for learning the following spells:\n* ''[[Chill touch]]''\n* ''[[Frost fingers]]''\n* ''[[Gust of wind]]''\n* ''[[Shatter]]''\n* ''[[Wall of ice]]''\nThe last two pages of this tome described how to widen the effect of the ''frost fingers'' spell.",
        "History": "The author of ''The Codicil of White'' remains unknown, but he or she was likely a priest of Auril as well as an accomplished wizard. Knowledge of the book comes from the sage [[Erpalio]] of [[Neverwinter]], who purchased the tome from the [[Company of Seven Stars]] late in the [[1348 DR|Year of the Spur, 1348 DR]]. They had recovered it as spoils from foiling a bandit attack on a caravan to Neverwinter they were guarding. Erpalio published the only known description of the book (outside the church of Auril) and this apparently brought his doom upon him&mdash;he was found frozen to death later that winter in his heated home and the tome was missing.\n\nThe ''Codicil'' was eventually sent to the [[House of Auril's Breath]] in [[Glister]] where it remained for a number of years. In the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], the high priestess of an isolated town requested the book be loaned to her for the ordination ceremony of her son, [[Tamall Horndusk]], and the request was granted when an [[air elemental]] arrived and delivered the book to her. The ceremony was to take place on the next new moon, but on the last night of the preceding full moon a horde of [[werewolves]], followers of [[Malar]] the Beastlord, sacked the town. In the mayhem and confusion, a disgruntled priestess of Auril, [[Cefra Windrivver]], removed the book from the high priestess's home and absconded into the night.\n\nAfter weeks of wandering, Cefra made careful contact with a tribe of [[bugbear]]s and, through bribes and helpful applications of her magic, wheedled her way into the tribe, made a pact with the chief, and became their priestess. She converted the tribe to the worship of Auril, setting up an organization following her ideas of how things should be conducted.\n\nA possible sighting of the book was on [[Hammer 13]], [[1372 DR]], by a survivor of a bugbear attack in the hills north of the [[Cold Wood]] in [[Luruar]], [[north Faerûn]]. He reported seeing a woman in the distance holding a rectangular piece of white fur above her head as she shouted at the bugbears.\n\nThe ''Codicil'' was later located at the fortress of [[Grimskalle]] on the island of [[Solstice]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] during the [[Everlasting Rime]].<ref>"
