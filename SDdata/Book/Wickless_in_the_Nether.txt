==Summary==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Artemis Entreri]] and [[Jarlaxle]] encounter the [[dragon]] sisters [[Tazmikella]] and [[Ilnezhara]] in [[Heliogabalus]], [[Damara]]. 

Tazmikella, appearing as a plain shopkeeper, tells the duo how an item of great sentimental value is in the possession of Ilnezhara, and hires Entreri and Jarlaxle to steal it. They soon realize they are in way over their heads when they discover their mark is an ancient and powerful [[copper dragon]]. Ilnezhara commands the two to go and kill Tazmikella for her in exchange for their lives. They journey back to kill Tazmikella and find out Tazmikella is ''also'' a copper dragon&mdash;and Ilnezhara's sister. Jarlaxle and Entreri agree to work for the two dragon sisters.
