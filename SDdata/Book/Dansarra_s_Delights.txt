'''''Dansarra's Delights''''' was a periodical [[chapbook]] published in the city of [[Riatavin]] of [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
''Dansarra's Delights'' was inspired by [[Dansarra]], a lippy courtesan and dancer from [[Amn]] who was turned undead against her will but continued to practice her craft in the new less-appealing body. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Dansarra was long gone and turned into dust. Still, the aforementioned chapbook adapted her name and bitter, critical attitude to publishing biting reviews of Riatavin's restaurants, theatrical performances, and opinions of local public figures.
