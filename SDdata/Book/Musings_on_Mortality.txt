{{quote|''Great things befall when one is brave enough to do something bold, strange, and unusual. Something off one's daily trail, apart from one's chosen character and station and presented-to-the-world mask. Great things or terrible. Or merely pratfalls and troublesome chaos in their wake. All of which proves one thing beyond all doubt: Whatever gods watch over us, they're starved for amusement, and richly reward those who entertain them.''|Excerpt from ''Musings on Mortality''.}}

==Contents==
''Musings on Mortality'' was a collection of ponderings and ruminations on the nature of life, the purpose of the said life, great deeds, and how they were achieved. All the things that are done to entertain the mighty gods.
