'''''Spider and Stone''''' is an ebook novel by [[Jaleigh Johnson]] and the last of the loosely connected novels of the [[Rise of the Underdark]].

{{quote|''[[Lolth]]—patron deity of the [[drow]], Spider Queen, regent of the [[Demonweb Pits|Demon Web Pits]]—has once again stirred the dark elves into roiling aggression against the rest of [[Faerûn]], reveling in the chaos born from her dark schemata. This is the Rise of the [[Underdark]].''
 
''In [[Iltkazar]], the last subterranean kingdom of the once resplendent [[dwarf|dwarven]] realm of [[Shanatar]], King [[Mithbarakaz|Mith Barak]] faces a siege of drow soldiers, spies, and assassins looking to seize the powerful city and the ancient magical artifacts hidden there.  Somewhere in the city, the [[Arcane Script Sphere]]—a mystical orb touched by [[Mystra]], the long-dead goddess magic—calls out to heroes and adventurers, beckoning with whispers of power and knowledge. Mith Barak hears it and knows he cannot hold the artifact much longer, but fears what the drow may do with it.''
 
''Enter [[Icelin]], [[Ruen]], and [[Sull (the butcher)|Sull]], [[Waterdeep|Waterdavian]] wanderers whose desire to understand their own [[spellscar]]s sets them in search of Mystran mysteries—they hope to understand magic and thus understand its plague. As they move from town to town, city to city in search of knowledge, Icelin hears the siren call of the Arcane Script Sphere, and it draws the trio deep into rocks of the Underdark where they find themselves at the center of the struggle between the dwarves and drow.''
 
''Only King Mith Barak can initiate them into the mysteries they hope to illuminate. But first they must help him with a mystery of his own—a dark elf assassin, himself a seeker of the sphere, lies in Iltkazar's dungeons shrouded in the mystery and magic of Lolth. Icelin might be the one to see past that shroud and determine the true goal of the Spider Queen's schemes.'' 
 
''As the dark elves intensify their attacks, the trio realizes their quest for knowledge has taken them into a new and dangerous realm . . . a realm dictated by the whims of spider and stone.''|[http://www.amazon.com/Spider-Stone-Jaleigh-Johnson-ebook/dp/B009MY9QXM/]}}
