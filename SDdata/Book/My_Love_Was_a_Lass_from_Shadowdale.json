        "mainbody": "y Love Was a Lass from Shadowdale was a sea shanty popularized by sailors and pirates of the Sea of Fallen Stars sometime before the midâ€“14 century DR.\nMy Love was a cyclical song that told a story of a sailor who fell in love with a woman, only to lose her to another maritime professional. The song started with a silver-haired paramour from Shadowdale who left the narrator for a pirate from the Isle of Presper. The next one was a woman from Marsember who left the singer for a whaleer from Westgate. The song continued on about women from other cities from the Inner Sea.\nEven thought the shanty originated in the Sea of Fallen Stars, it moved to the Sword Coast, Sea of Swords, and the Shining Sea along with the crew of Captain Bawrs Narwhal. In 1362 DR, Artus Cimber and Hydel Pontifax heard the shanty onboard Bawrs galleon on their way from Baldurs Gate to Chult."
