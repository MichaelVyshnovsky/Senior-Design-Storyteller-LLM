        "Description": "''My Love'' was a cyclical song that told a story of a sailor who fell in love with a woman, only to lose her to another maritime professional. The song started with a silver-haired paramour from [[Shadowdale]] who left the narrator for a pirate from the [[Isle of Presper]]. The next one was a woman from [[Marsember]] who left the singer for a [[whale]]er from [[Westgate]]. The song continued on about women from other cities from the Inner Sea.\n\n{{Quote|\n''My love was a lass from Shadowdale,''<br />''A beauty with hair of silver.''<br />''A pirate from Presper stole her away.''<br />''The sea take all pirates from Presper, brave boys,''<br />''The sea take the pirates of Presper.''<br />''My love was a lass from Marsember,''<br />''And we were to wed last [[Mirtul]].''<br />''A whaler from Westgate stole her away.''<br />''The sea take all whalers from Westgate, brave boys,''<br />''The sea take the whalers of Westgate.''}}",
        "History": "Even thought the shanty originated in the Sea of Fallen Stars, it moved to the [[Sword Coast]], [[Sea of Swords]], and the [[Shining Sea]] along with the crew of Captain [[Bawr]]'s ''[[Narwhal (galleon)|Narwhal]]''. In [[1362 DR]], [[Artus Cimber]] and [[Hydel Pontifax]] heard the shanty onboard Bawr's [[galleon]] on their way from [[Baldur's Gate]] to [[Chult]]."
