Ninja Wars is an adventure for 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. It is part of the Oriental Adventures campaign setting and set in Kara-Tur.
Ninja Wars was published in 1990 by TSR, Inc.. Cover art is by Fred Fields and interior art is by Mark Nelson. It includes a poster map of Aru by John Knecht.
Coming soon after Ronin Challenge (OA6) and Test of the Samurai (OA7), both published in 1990, Ninja Wars appears intended to be the third in a series of adventures named for Oriental Adventures classes. But whereas the first two have a loosely connected storyline, Ninja Wars has no links to either of them, apart from also being set in Wa like OA7. It even recommends Blood of the Yakuza (OA4, published in 1987) for background on Wa. Moreover, it has a new module code, FROA. While this hints at a planned stronger connection to the Forgotten Realms setting, Ninja Wars also contains no links to Faerûn. It is possible TSRs plans for this supposed trilogy were changed at a late stage. In any case, Ninja Wars was to be the final release in the original Oriental Adventures series for the Kara-Tur setting, until Oriental Adventures for 3 edition in 2001, which would use the new setting of Rokugan.
Set in the town of Aru in the nation of Wa in Kara-Tur, it presents a large variety of adventures, from a lengthy 24-act campaign to five smaller adventures to a number of mini-adventures and incidents. Several subplots and themes run through them, many involving conflicts with ninja factions, as the name suggests, as well as intrigue, politics, romance, monsters, and the mythical "tiger-bird spirit". In the main campaign, PCs are recruited by Benju Matsutomo, daimyo of Aru, to investigate various strange incidents in the lead-up to the important Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps, eventually uncovering a conspiracy to sabotage it. Many events in the main campaign may proceed without PC involvement or are optional, allowing a DM to tailor or adapt the campaign to their own plans and to PC choices, so each play-through may take a very different form. Aru itself can appear as non-static setting where things happen independently of PCs.
