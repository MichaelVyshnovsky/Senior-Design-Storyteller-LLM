The Procampur City Expansion Packet was a document released for the Living City organized play program run by the RPGA in 1997. The Players Edition expands on the existing city of Procampur in the Vast for use as background in RPGA campaigns.
In 1997, the RPGA announced the Procampur Project an expansion for Living City set in the city of Procampur, Jewel of the Vast, overseen by the Universe Construction Company (a group of Living City designers UCC) led by Jay Fisher and Daniel Cooper. They were split into a City Development Team (responsible for the design of the city and its lore) and a Tournament Development Team (responsible for creating the tournament adventures).
The initial plan was for a 10-part (or 11-part) series of connected adventures set in the Jewel of the Vast&mdashwhat would eventually be known as the Cracked Jewel Saga&mdashbut the team was also open to adventure submissions not related to the main storyline. While players could submit adventures, locations, and characters for Procampur to the UCC, the city was not player-controlled like Ravens Bluff was and all material needed to be approved by TSR.
The Expansion Packet was first made available at Gen Con 1997.
