The Cookbook of Nemalas was an incredibly rare and legendary cookbook in Faer√ªn.
The Cookbook of Nemalas contained recipes for a variety of dishes that were once made by the Netherese.
At some point in time, Elminster Aumar gifted a copy of this book to the Harpers, who then kept it within Harpers Hold.
