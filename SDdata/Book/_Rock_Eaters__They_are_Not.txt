'''''"Rock Eaters" They are Not!''''' was a [[book]] dedicated to debunking perceived stereotypes about [[dwarves]], found in the libraries of the [[Hand of the Seldarine]] before the stronghold's fall centuries before [[1281 DR]].

==Content==
The elven author of the book took upon themselves the task of researching many misconceptions and false beliefs held by the Fair Folk about dwarves. The research was performed after the author was invited to visit a dwarven citadel, [[Dorn's Deep]]. There they first witnessed dwarves' eating habits, which did not, contrary to popular belief, include eating dirt and rocks. The tome also praised Dorn's Deep's grand architecture as the author expected to be covered in dirt and soot during the visit, unbefitting a [[high elf]]. Friendly dwarves proudly demonstrated every wonder and beautiful detail of the underground realm to the fair visitor.

Despite being impressed with the stout folk of Dorn's Deep, the author, who hailed from the grand Hand of the Seldarine, still considered dwarves a "lesser race" and claimed that wonders created by the [[Tel-quessir]] were by far superior. However, the high elf did not feel comfortable pointing out dwarven inferiority during the tour.

==History==
''"Rock Eaters" They are Not!'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' [[900 DR]] and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One copy could be found in the citadel's library curated by [[Custhantos]], along with many other rare tomes.
