The Dragon Cried was a ballad that told the story of the fall of archmage Archveult Tattercloak who was presumed to had perished in a sky battle over Ravens Bluff battling an exotic breed of a gigantic dragon. The song was penned by an anonymous bard of the Vast sometime before the late 14 century DR.
