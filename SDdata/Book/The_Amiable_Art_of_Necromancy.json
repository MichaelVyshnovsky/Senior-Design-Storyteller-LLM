She chafes against the shibboleth. Who needs necromancy? What could such a gross thing possibly be for? These questions are very valid. I hope my answer satisfies. Necromancy is a social magic.''|Excerpt from ''The Amiable Art of Necromancy''}}",
        "Contents": "The book's author recorded her musings and views on the art of necromancy and her attitudes toward outer people's opinions on the subject. Even though many frowned on necromancy, Cherish Hollow claimed that it was a \"social magic.\" She then continued making that point by walking about her [[zombie]] servant – the creature that once was [[Nascent Owens]]. Cherish stated that the zombie remembered naught of its former life and that it found pleasure in serving his mistress [[tea]], performing foul-smelling yet relaxing backrubs, or attacking her enemies and consuming their brains. Cherish stated that the discarded body – a husk, was given direction and purpose in the most economic sense as well as in the metaphysical sense. The author concluded by stating that necromancy was is useful to those who sought to challenge the cultural notions of death and to those who were lonely.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, several copies of ''The Amiable Art of Necromancy'' could be found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. One belonged to the [[Jannath (family)|Jannath]] family, stashed in the [[Jannath estate]] and another belonged to [[Lucretious]], the proprietress of the planar [[Circus of the Last Days]]."
