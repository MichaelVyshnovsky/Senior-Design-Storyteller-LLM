Even though many frowned on necromancy, Cherish Hollow claimed that it was a \"social magic.\" She then continued making that point by walking about her zombie servant – the creature that once was Nascent Owens. Cherish stated that the zombie remembered naught of its former life and that it found pleasure in serving his mistress tea, performing foul-smelling yet relaxing backrubs, or attacking her enemies and consuming their brains. Cherish stated that the discarded body – a husk, was given direction and purpose in the most economic sense as well as in the metaphysical sense. The author concluded by stating that necromancy was is useful to those who sought to challenge the cultural notions of death and to those who were lonely.\nCirca the , several copies of The Amiable Art of Necromancy could be found in the city of Baldurs Gate. One belonged to the Jannath family, stashed in the Jannath estate and another belonged to Lucretious, the proprietress of the planar Circus of the Last Days."
