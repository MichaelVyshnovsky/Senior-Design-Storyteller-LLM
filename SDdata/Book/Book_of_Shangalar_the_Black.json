        "mainbody": "The '''''Book of Shangalar the Black''''' was one of the [[spellbook]]s of the former [[Grand Vizar]] of [[Calimshan]], and runemaster of the [[Twisted Rune]]<ref name=EotSS-p183> known as [[Shangalar]]. It was one volume within the collection of the [[lich]]'s larger body of work.",
        "Description": "This surprisingly heavy tome was thinner than a finger and had a blank cover, save for the name \"''Shangalar''\" written in [[Thorass]] on the bottom-right corner. It contained four pages of [[electrum]], linked to the binding with small, tarnished [[silver]] rings.",
        "History": "After forgoing the leadership as Grand Vizar, but before achieving lichdom, Shangalar journeyed through a ruined city in the desert of [[Anauroch]] and was robbed of his spellbook by the master [[thief]], [[Athchos|Athchos the Black]]. Athchos escaped the desert wasteland for [[Iriaebor]], where he proceeded to recite the book to a cabal of wizards led by [[Orlstar Meir]] for the tome's reproduction. The thief then attempted to lease the tome to a mage in [[Elturel]] but was slain by a swarm of [[crawling claw]]s. Although the book was lost, Shangalar renamed himself \"Shangalar the Black\", a designation of pride for his slaying of the thief.\n\nThe spellbook popped up years later in [[Neverwinter]], having been unmistakably recited by a sage named [[Ourgos]]. Soon after it was stolen by agents operating out of [[Luskan]] and its whereabouts have been unknown since.",
        "Contents": "The ''Book of Shangalar the Black'' contained four spells of his creation:\n* ''[[Bone javelin]]'' (unique)\n* ''[[Negative plane protection]]'' (unique [[arcane]] variant)\n* ''[[Repel undead]]''\n* ''[[Bone blade]]'' (unique)"
