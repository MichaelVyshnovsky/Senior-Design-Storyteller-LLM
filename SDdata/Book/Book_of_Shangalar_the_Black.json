It was one volume within the collection of the lichs larger body of work.\nThis surprisingly heavy tome was thinner than a finger and had a blank cover, save for the name \"Shangalar\" written in Thorass on the bottom-right corner. It contained four pages of electrum, linked to the binding with small, tarnished silver rings.\nAfter forgoing the leadership as Grand Vizar, but before achieving lichdom, Shangalar journeyed through a ruined city in the desert of Anauroch and was robbed of his spellbook by the master thief, Athchos the Black. Athchos escaped the desert wasteland for Iriaebor, where he proceeded to recite the book to a cabal of wizards led by Orlstar Meir for the tomes reproduction. The thief then attempted to lease the tome to a mage in Elturel but was slain by a swarm of crawling claws. Although the book was lost, Shangalar renamed himself \"Shangalar the Black\", a designation of pride for his slaying of the thief.\nThe spellbook popped up years later in Neverwinter, having been unmistakably recited by a sage named Ourgos. Soon after it was stolen by agents operating out of Luskan and its whereabouts have been unknown since. \nThe Book of Shangalar the Black contained four spells of his creation\n* Bone javelin (unique)\n* Negative plane protection (unique arcane variant)\n* Repel undead\n* Bone blade (unique)"
