The book subsequently passed among many hands, within the church first then lost after attacks from other churches.\n\nDuring the {{YearlinkName|1300}}, the book resurfaced and was offered by a priest to a divine minion of Set as payment for services. Since that time the deity had the tome guarded by his minions, tasking them to lending it to his mortal followers so the spells could remain in use among his church&mdash;any worshiper knowing the prayers to summon a minion could to so to request the permission to study the spells found in the Hate of the Cobra.\n\n''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], the book was in possession of [[Thah Rahalar]], a corrupted [[Hound archon]] of [[Anubis]] who became a minion of Set."
