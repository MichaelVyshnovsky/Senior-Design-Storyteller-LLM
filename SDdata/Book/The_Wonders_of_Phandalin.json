        "mainbody": "he Wonders of Phandalin was a book detailing the rising glory of the town known as Phandalin.\nThe book itself was bound with a hardback cover, though over time it became aged such that the pages cracked at a touch.\nThe Wonders of Phandalin described Phandalin as extremely prosperous, even claiming that it would rival Neverwinter for the title of Jewel of the North. The tome also detailed the Phandelvers Pact and the Forge of Spells, along with the alliance of humans, dwarves, and gnomes.\nThis book was written in 950 DR, when Phandalin was at the peak of its renown under the leadership of Mayor Alderleaf.This is most likely the ancestor of Qelline and Carp Alderleaf, a mother and son who live in Phandalin in the 15 century DR, the time in which Baldurs Gate III is set. One year later, the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt raided and destroyed the whole town, ending Phandalins glory."
