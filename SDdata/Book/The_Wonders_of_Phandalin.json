        "Description": "The book itself was bound with a hardback cover, though over time it became aged such that the pages cracked at a touch.\n\nThe ''Wonders of Phandalin'' described Phandalin as extremely prosperous, even claiming that it would rival [[Neverwinter]] for the title of 'Jewel of the North'. The tome also detailed the [[Phandelver's Pact]] and the [[Forge of Spells]], along with the alliance of [[human]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[gnomes]].",
        "History": "This book was written in [[950 DR]], when Phandalin was at the peak of its renown under the leadership of [[Alderleaf|Mayor Alderleaf]].This is most likely the ancestor of [[Qelline Alderleaf|Qelline]] and [[Carp Alderleaf]], a mother and son who live in [[Phandalin]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the time in which ''[[Baldur's Gate III]]'' is set. One year later, the orcs of [[Uruth Ukrypt]] raided and destroyed the whole town, ending Phandalin's glory."
