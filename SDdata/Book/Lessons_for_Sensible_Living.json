        "mainbody": "Lessons for Sensible Living was a multi-volume series written by Harrington Nethalin that instructed folks of the Realms on how to live their most practical and reasonable life.\nEach volume was rather small and poorly made. The cover featured a depiction of Harringtons likeness, complete with a scowling grimace.\nThe book made multiple appeals to people who Harrington referred to as \"Sensible Folk.\" Each volume included advice on how to maintain that commonsense and sensibility.\nThis volume discussed how Sensible Folk could best conduct themselves if they mistakenly decided to ever visit a large city. While the best advice Harrington had to offer was to avoid cities outright, he offered additional insights regarding marketplaces, taverns, and even sewer systems. He also warned that most cities are simply too large, and any visitor is guaranteed to find themselves immediately lost.\nThis volume told an abridged story of Zariel, a celestial being who was charged with monitoring the great Blood War, and her fall from grace, as Zariel thought that a mere observation was not righteous. The author compared Zariel to a drunk oaf at a tavern who witnessed two people brawling over spilled beer and, instead of staying out of it, got involved and started a tavern-wide brawl. Her war ended in a loss, and Zariel was corrupted by evil, ending up being a ruler of Hells. The lesson for the sensible folk from Zariels fall was, \"Do not strive to correct what cannot be corrected.\" It encouraged good folk to mind their own business, stay at home, and not look to help others.\nThe book talked about things that common folk should keep out of, things like the Blood War."
