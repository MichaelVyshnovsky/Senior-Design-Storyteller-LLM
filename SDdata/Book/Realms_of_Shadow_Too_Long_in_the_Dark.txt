'''"Too Long in the Dark"''' is a short story by [[Paul S. Kemp]] that appeared in the ''[[Realms of Shadow]]'' anthology of stories from the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', published in April 2002.

==Summary==
In the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, the powerful Netherese archwizard Zossimus is content in his lavish mansion on [[Shade Enclave]], even as the [[Princes of Shade]] have straddled it on the border of the [[Plane of Shadow]], leaving the enclave to float in eternal twilight. But as [[Karsus]] challenges [[Mystryl]] for her divinity and the [[Weave]] fails, the twelve princes draw upon the [[Shadow Weave]] to keep the city flying, pulling it wholly into the dark demiplane. Yet Zossimus' wife despairs of living forever in the dark...
