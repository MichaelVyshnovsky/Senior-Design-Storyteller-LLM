        "mainbody": "The '''''Heart of Winter''''' was one of the [[book]]s in a series dedicated to the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]] history of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].",
        "Contents": "The ''Heart of Winter'' talked about the events of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, that took place shortly after the attacks of [[Belhifet]] on [[Kuldahar]] and Ten Towns. The book opened by dispelling confusion about the term \"Heart of Winter\". Some erroneously thought it to be the name of the legendary ''[[Heartstone Gem]]'' at the center of Kuldahar. In reality, the term \"Heart of Winter\" was an [[Uthgardt]] saying that referred to a person or a creature that operated with a single goalâ€”revenge.\n\nThe most famous bearer of the title was the [[barbarian]] lord [[Wylfdene]], who assembled the northern tribes under his banner and led them against the Ten Towns in 1281 DR. The book stated that Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of [[Jerrod]], a legendary barbarian hero who gave up his life to end the reign of the dreaded [[archmage]] [[Arakon]] several hundreds of years before the 13{{th}} century DR. Such claims made it easy for the Uthgardt to become united under a single man's leadership. Wylfdene wanted to reclaim lands taken by the southern people.\n\nLord Wylfdene built a siege camp on [[Bremen's Run]] beneath the shadow of [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. The war counted several small-scale battles against the Ten Towns and [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Battlehammer]] until the [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]] came to try and broker peace in the north. The historic records of what followed were vague, but most agreed that diplomacy failed, and Wylfdene was slain by the adventurers. All sages agreed, however, that the deeds of the Heroes were the reason why the Ten Towns continued to exist and thrive.\n\nFinally, the book's author did not know the final fate of the Heroes of Icewind Dale. The last known record stated that the adventurers met a [[halfling]] outlander in the [[Whistling Gallows Inn]] in [[Lonelywood]] and accompanied him to a place of hidden riches somewhere in the [[Anauroch]]. The Heroes were never heard of again."
