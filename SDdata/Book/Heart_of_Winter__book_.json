        "mainbody": "The Heart of Winter was one of the books in a series dedicated to the early 14 century DR history of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.\nThe Heart of Winter talked about the events of the , that took place shortly after the attacks of Belhifet on Kuldahar and Ten Towns. The book opened by dispelling confusion about the term \"Heart of Winter\". Some erroneously thought it to be the name of the legendary Heartstone Gem at the center of Kuldahar. In reality, the term \"Heart of Winter\" was an Uthgardt saying that referred to a person or a creature that operated with a single goalâ€”revenge.\nThe most famous bearer of the title was the barbarian lord Wylfdene, who assembled the northern tribes under his banner and led them against the Ten Towns in 1281 DR. The book stated that Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of Jerrod, a legendary barbarian hero who gave up his life to end the reign of the dreaded archmage Arakon several hundreds of years before the 13 century DR. Such claims made it easy for the Uthgardt to become united under a single mans leadership. Wylfdene wanted to reclaim lands taken by the southern people.\nLord Wylfdene built a siege camp on Bremens Run beneath the shadow of Kelvins Cairn. The war counted several small-scale battles against the Ten Towns and dwarves of Clan Battlehammer until the Heroes of Icewind Dale came to try and broker peace in the north. The historic records of what followed were vague, but most agreed that diplomacy failed, and Wylfdene was slain by the adventurers. All sages agreed, however, that the deeds of the Heroes were the reason why the Ten Towns continued to exist and thrive.\nFinally, the books author did not know the final fate of the Heroes of Icewind Dale. The last known record stated that the adventurers met a halfling outlander in the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood and accompanied him to a place of hidden riches somewhere in the Anauroch. The Heroes were never heard of again."
