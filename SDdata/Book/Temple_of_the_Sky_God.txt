{{Quote|'''{{SmallCaps|Death From Above}}'''

For centuries, [[pilgrim]]s have sought prophecies from an oracle in the sky, traveling astride flying [[mount]]s to reach the oracle's temple. In recent months, however, visitors seeking the oracle have not returned, and the sky has turned a sinister crimson. Now you must take to the air to face whatever perils lie above and restore the temple to safety. If you fail, it's a long way down. 

''Temple of the Sky God''™ is a ''Dungeons & Dragons® Roleplaying Game'' challenge designed for the 2012 winter installment of the D&D {{SmallCaps|Lair Assault}} official play program. It includes one full-color battle map, one sheet of tokens, a laminated play aid, a pack of mount cards, and information on the D&D {{SmallCaps|Lair Assault}} program.}}
