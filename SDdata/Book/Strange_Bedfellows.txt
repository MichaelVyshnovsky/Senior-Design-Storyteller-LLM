'''Strange Bedfellows''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign. It is part 3 of the Tides of War miniseries, but was never published, somewhat spoiling its effect on the campaign. Information on the plot was taken from the following module.

==Plot==
The [[Zhentarim]] are indeed about to attack [[Loudwater]]. They have allied with a group of [[devil]]s and a surviving member of the [[Calishite]] [[Rensha]] family who used to rule over Loudwater. [[Otar]], the [[Green Regent]] is leading an expedition to [[Silverymoon]] to see if he can gather allies to help defend against the upcoming attack.
