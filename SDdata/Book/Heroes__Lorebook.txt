Heroes Lorebook is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
Heroes Lorebook describes popular heroic characters from various Forgotten Realms novels. It is the follow-up to Hall of Heroes, a similar accessory published in 1989.
Heroes Lorebook presents detailed profiles of 61 prominent characters from the setting, with each profile offering complete game statistics, background information, and campaign notes. These profiles are based on novels and game products published up to the end of 1995. Within the 160 pages, about 60 heroes are elaborated upon.
For each character, the book provides an extensive array of information. After presenting the characters statistics, it delves into their proficiencies, equipment, magical items, and combat tactics. It also examines their companions, enemies, appearance, personality, location, history, and motivations. Furthermore, each profile includes suggestions for how to use the character in campaigns and references for further reading.
Following the character profiles, the book features sections dedicated to the special magical items possessed by these heroes, as well as specialist spells mentioned throughout the book. This comprehensive approach makes the book an invaluable resource for players and Dungeon Masters looking to integrate these characters into their campaigns.
Heroes Lorebook includes a central 16-page section (spanning pages 73â€“88) showcasing a collection of color illustrations. Many of these artworks were specifically created for this publication and feature nearly half of the characters profiled in the book. These illustrations depict the characters in an array of scenes, adding a visual dimension to their descriptions.
The book contains supplemental material on pages 136-158, which encompasses a variety of topics. This section includes notes on the Chosen of Mystra, detailing these unique characters and their roles. It also covers magical items and effects, providing insights into various enchanted objects and their uses. Additionally, the section offers information on special wizard spells, enhancing the magical repertoire available in the game.
Furthermore, the supplement explores heroic groups such as the Harpers and the Knights of Myth Drannor, giving an overview of these organizations and their significance in the setting. An index to the book is also included in these pages, aiding in navigation and reference.

* The book incorrectly assigns the races to several character. For example, for the characters from War in Tethyr, it wrongly calls Vander Stillhawk an elf and Tobiworth Hedgeblossom a half-elf, when the two are a human and halfling, respectively.
