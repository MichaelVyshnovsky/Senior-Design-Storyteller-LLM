It was written in two volumes.\n\nAmong other things, Arthaeuil wrote of the rites of the [[Green Priests]] at the [[Shell House]] in [[Ilyaport]], [[Lapaliiya]], and their use of the holy relic known as ''[[The Orglara]]''.\n\nThe original was kept in the great fortress-library of [[Candlekeep]] around [[1372 DR]]."
