'''''Mistress of the Night and Friends''''' was a collection of short stories, written for children, that promoted the [[Sharran]] faith. It was published some time during or before [[1492 DR]].

==Contents==
One story in ''Mistress of the Night'' told the tale of a beautiful woman who was courted by folks from all across the lands. Her mother worried for a time that she would never find true joy and happiness. But tragedy struck and the woman's mother died.

The beautiful woman was entirely distraught. Her joy and charm were stripped away as she became overwhelmed with grief and sorrow. It was then that the goddess [[Shar]] spoke to her. Shar told the woman that only she truly loved her, no matter the sorrow she carried.

Shar instructed the woman to carry a specific vial and drop it into a well that served a local community. When folks drank from the well, they became sick and eventually died. Nevertheless, the woman maintained her love for Shar.

People from across the realm visited the woman once again. They did not visit because of her beauty or her charm, but because she was Shar's High Priestess and her word was indisputable.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one copy of ''Mistress of the Night and Friends'' remained in the possession Auntie [[Ethel]], the [[hag]] of the [[Sunlit Wetlands]].
