'''''The Castle of Forever''''' was a popular book of fiction in the [[Heartlands]] of the [[Realms]].

==Contents==
The book featured a series of fictional rulers of [[Dragonspear Castle]], interred within the castle's walls on their deaths. In the course of the story, their [[ghost]]s emerged and met with each other to one-up each other with tales of their reigns, and debate issues at hand such as the allegiance of a newly-arrived visitor.

Although historically-themed, only a few isolated instances of true historical events or architectural details were found in the book. The most compelling part of the book were the fictional ghostly rulers, who were actually thinly-disguised depictions of real, current political figures and embodied their counterpart's real opinions, personalities, and speeches. Figures used in this way included King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] of [[Cormyr]], King [[Harbromm]] of [[Citadel Adbar]], various [[Calishite]] pashas, and members of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] of [[Amn]].

==History==
Written in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] by [[Hildark Marblesard]], the book quickly became a classic not on the strength of its prose and storytelling, but the personalities within. People bought and studied ''The Castle of Forever'' so as to study the personages, so as to gain practical advantages in the fields of diplomacy and intrigue. It was considered a reliable guide to understanding them, allowing one to better anticipate, befriend, or manipulate the target.
