'''''Moonshae''''' is a 1st-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory that was set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. 
{{Quote|''Amid the storm-tossed vastness of the [[Trackless Sea]] west of the mainland, a group of rocky islands lies exposed to the full brunt of winter gales. These isles&mdash;[[Moonshae Isles|the Moonshaes]]&mdash;are home to some of the hardiest folk of the [[Forgotten Realms]].''

''Now the Moonshaes&mdash;the setting of the first FORGOTTEN REALMS novel, ''[[Darkwalker on Moonshae]]''&mdash;are detailed for your role-playing campaign. The cultures, [[deity|deities]], and locales of the isles are described in AD&D<sup>&reg;</sup> game terms. This source book includes full-color maps displaying the Moonshaes and surrounding islands, many close-up maps depicting particular regions of the Moonshaes, and all the information you need to establish a campaign on these misty lands with Celtic roots.''}}

==Description==
''Moonshae'' is a 64-page booklet comes wrapped in a removable cover. Included is a fold-out color poster map of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. This large color insert has maps of the Moonshae Isles printed on both sides. One side is at a scale of 20 miles per inch, while the reverse is scaled at 30 miles per inch. Both maps contain the same amount of detail, the major difference being that there is less open sea surrounding the 20-miles-per-inch map. One of the maps lines up with the edges of the maps in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]''. Two appendixes explain using the Moonshaes in a campaign and the magical items of the Moonshaes. 

''Moonshae'' describes the climate, topography, and economy of the region, including the [[Korinn Archipelago]], which was created by [[Aaron Allston]] and first detailed in the module ''[[Treasure Hunt]]''. It also details two regional cultures and their lands: the indigenous people known as the [[Ffolk]], and the invading [[Northmen]].

''Moonshae'' discusses the character races, character classes, politics, conflicts, geography, and economics within the Moonshaes. It also describes the major supernatural entities which exist in the countryside and seas. Several specific locales of the Moonshaes are also described, from the perspective of [[Elminster]] as a tour of the people and places he has visited. The style of presentation is similar to that used in the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Set''.
