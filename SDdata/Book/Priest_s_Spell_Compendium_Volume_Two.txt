Priests Spell Compendium Volume Two is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.
Priests Spell Compendium Volume Two specifically tailored for clerics, druids, and other priestly classes. It contains alphabetically sorted spells from garments of elvenkind to spiderform.
The compendium is an extensive collection of divine spells, gathered from various Advanced Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks, campaign settings, and adventure modules. Its primary aim is to provide a comprehensive and easily accessible reference for players and Dungeon Masters alike.
Each spell entry includes detailed information such as the spells name, level, range, duration, area of effect, components required, and a thorough description of what the spell does. Priests Spell Compendium Volume Two not only revisits classic spells familiar to long-time players but also introduces modifications and clarifications to existing spells where necessary. It also addresses any ambiguities in the spell descriptions from earlier publications, providing clarifications to ensure a consistent interpretation of the rules.
