        "mainbody": "everwinter Nights was an epic poem written by Pomplo the Elder.This was the first usage of the term Neverwinter Nights within lore terms. Treasures of the Savage Frontier and the original Neverwinter Nights were developed at a similar time by the same developers, so the poem that appeared in the former game was most likely a reference to the latter. The latter game revolves around the Knights of Neverwinter (the player characters in the MMO), i.e., the Neverwinter Knights. Hence, the name Neverwinter Nights is probably a witty equivoque of Neverwinter Knights.\nThe poem was often performed in an entertainment hall in the colony of Farr Windward. Neverwinter Nights was acted out as a play, where three men would stand against each side of a square chamber, and recite the epic work of literature. They would do this whilst balancing bowls of kumquats on their heads."
