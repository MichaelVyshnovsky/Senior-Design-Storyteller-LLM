        "mainbody": "'''''Neverwinter Nights''''' was an epic poem written by [[Pomplo]] the Elder.<ref group=\"note\">This was the first usage of the term ''Neverwinter Nights'' within lore terms. ''[[Treasures of the Savage Frontier]]'' and the [[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|original ''Neverwinter Nights'']] were developed at a similar time by the same developers, so the poem that appeared in the former game was most likely a reference to the latter. The latter game revolves around the Knights of Neverwinter (the player characters in the MMO), i.e., the Neverwinter Knights. Hence, the name ''Neverwinter Nights'' is probably a witty equivoque of Neverwinter Knights.",
        "Description": "The poem was often performed in an entertainment hall in the colony of [[Farr Windward]]. ''Neverwinter Nights'' was acted out as a play, where three men would stand against each side of a square chamber, and recite the epic work of literature. They would do this whilst balancing bowls of [[kumquat]]s on their heads."
