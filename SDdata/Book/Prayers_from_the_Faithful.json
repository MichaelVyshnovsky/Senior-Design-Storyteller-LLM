        "mainbody": "Prayers from the Faithful is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.\nPrayers from the Faithful details a number of holy books and relics of the Faer√ªnian pantheon, providing a collection of unique, lesser-known deities, their clerics, and the specific prayers, spells, and rituals associated with their worship.\nThe accessory also introduces a range of minor gods and goddesses who had not been deeply explored in previous publications. Each entry in Prayers from the Faithful details a specific deity, including their history, motivations, and the manner in which they interact with their followers.\nThe core of the accessory is its presentation of new spells and prayer rituals that reflect the unique aspects of each featured deity. These game mechanics allow players to access divine powers that are not only effective in gameplay but also rich in cultural and religious significance within the Realms. The spells and prayers are designed to be integrated seamlessly into the daily life of clerics and other divine spellcasters.\nPrayers from the Faithful also includes suggestions on how Dungeon Masters can incorporate these new deities and their followers into existing campaigns, providing advice on creating quests, conflicts, and encounters that are themed around religious events or crises of faith.\n* Introduction\n* The Argyr\n* Balance of Belaros\n* The Black Blook\n* Book of Fangs and Talons\n* Chanting Chain\n* Flame of the Spirit\n* The Glarathra\n* Gorothirs Girdle\n* Helm of Helm\n* Key of Faith\n* Lash of Loviatar\n* Leaves of Green\n* Mask of Mysteries\n* Mighty Rune of the Master\n* The Moonweb\n* The Orglara\n* Sash of Sune\n* Scepter of Mystra\n* Silver Supplicant\n* Testament of Vraer\n* Tome of the Morning\n* Tome of Torment\n* Veloghon of Vigilance\n* Vorthryns Archivir\n* Wythyndles Round Book\n* Yornars Trail Companion\n* Appendix I Common Spells\n* Appendix II Spell Index\nSpells\n  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nBooks\n  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nPrayers from the Faithful Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Design Ed Greenwood\n* Editing Doug Stewart\n* Project Coordinator Thomas M.
