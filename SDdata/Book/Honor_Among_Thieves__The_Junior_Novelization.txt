Edgin the bard lost everything when he and his barbarian friend, Holga, were captured during a risky heist years ago. Recently free, the two journey to the city of Neverwinter to reconnect with their former partners in crime. Can Edgin and Holga reassemble their band of scrappy scoundrels for one last mission, even in the face of constant danger and insurmountable odds?

The junior novelization of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: HONOR AMONG THIEVES retells key moments from the exciting film and features an eight-page full-color insert!|Back-cover text}}

==Description==
''The Junior Novelization'' is an abridged retelling of the events of ''Honor Among Thieves'', covering roughly the first half of the movie, that is, from Edgin and Holga's time at Revel's End to the retrieval of the Helmet of Disjunction from the ruins of Dolblunde and the battle with Themberchaud. It is based on an earlier version of the script than what was filmed, as indicated by variations in a number of lines and by a number of lines and scenes cut from the movie. The prose style is sparse and perfunctory.
