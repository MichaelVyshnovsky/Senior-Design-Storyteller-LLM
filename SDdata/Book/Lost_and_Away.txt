{{quote|''Even the sun, it looks for my love<br/>Where lies she now, where can she be?<br/>Cruel [[hawk]]'s talons a-downed my [[dove]]<br/>Look in valley, deep glade and lea<br/><br/>Even the wind is calling my love<br/>Crying mournful, crying high<br/><br/>Cruel hawk's talons a-downed my dove<br/>Laughter lost e'er, in silence die<br/><br/>Even the moon, it weeps for my love<br/>Lost and fallen, oh so far away<br/>Cruel hawk's talons a-downed my dove<br/>Where she lies now, none can say<br/><br/>Even the deepnight remembers my love<br/>Cold of the tomb, patient the grave<br/>Cruel hawk's talons a-downed my dove<br/>Too late too late her life to save<br/><br/>Even her [[sword]] it sings for my love<br/>Singing, sighing, echoing her name<br/>Cruel hawk's talons a-downed my dove<br/>So I'll fall on it now, this sadness to tame<br/><br/>Even the forests will miss our love<br/>No more our dancing, no more our glee<br/>Cruel hawk's talons a-downed my dove<br/>I'll join her in silence, from sadness be free...''|Excerpt from ''Lost and Away'' translated into [[Common]]}}
