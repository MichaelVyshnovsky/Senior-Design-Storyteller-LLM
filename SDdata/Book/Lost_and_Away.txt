Lost and Away was a traditional elfin fireside ballad sang by the Fair Folk of Faerûn.
This folksong was known to adventuress and a Harper Sharanralee of the 14 century DR. This ballad in full was likely included in Sharanralees recorded work – Ballads and Lore of One Dusty Road, that can be found in the library fortress of Candlekeep.
