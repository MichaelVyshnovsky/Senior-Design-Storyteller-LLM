{{Quote|''Only those who are pure in word, thought, and deed may look upon the knowledge gathered within this blessed tome. For the blinding truths inscribed within offer nothing but redemption or destruction for the wicked. May these consecrated pages forever illuminate the paths of the righteous.''

:''- [[Raziel]] the Crusader, ruler of the Platinum Heaven

As the [[Book of Vile Darkness (sourcebook)|''Book of Vile Darkness'']] was a resource book on the most evil elements of campaign play, the ''Book of Exalted Deeds'' focuses instead on the availability of good resources and features in the D&D spectrum.
Included are new exalted feats, prestige classes, races, spells, magic items, and descriptions and statistics for a host of creatures and celestial paragons to ally with virtuous characters. ''The Book of Exalted Deeds'' also provides descriptions and statistics for a host of creatures and [[celestial paragon]]s to ally with virtuous characters.}}
