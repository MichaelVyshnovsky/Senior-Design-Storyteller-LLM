'''''Menzoberranzan''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' boxed set for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|'''''Home of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and famed city of the [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]]&hellip;'''''
''Ruled by the feared and respected Houses and their [[Matron Mother]]s, Menzoberranzan is a place of great nobility and great treachery. The priestesses of [[Lloth]], the Spider Queen, demand (and receive) complete respect from the citizens of this mighty city. But what of the common folkâ€”the drow of non-noble birth, the [[humans]], and others? What is their lot in life, in this magnificent den of intrigue?''

''Three books in this boxed set explain the ways of Menzoberranzan in detail. '''Book One: The City''' gives the reader a tour of the streets and districts, a wealth of information on various practices and customs, and an overview of daily life for each class of citizen (and non-citizen). '''Book Two: The Houses''' presents all eighteen major and minor Houses of the city, including the Matron Mothers and their immediate families, as well as any important advisers and associates. '''Book Three: The Adventure''' gives players a chance to take their characters into the web of deceit and intrigue woven by the denizens of this famed city.''
