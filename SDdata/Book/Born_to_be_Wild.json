        "Contents": "The pamphlet contained a magical adventure wherein Elminster lambasted Volo over the inaccuracies and fiction in his accounts of the mating rituals found in the [[Feywild]]. The good sage then proceeded to demonstrate the true facts of the matter, described with highly evocative, imagination-stirring prose.",
        "History": "There was a copy of this book in the \"stern librarian\" themed room in the [[Sharess' Caress]] brothel in [[1492 DR]]."
