        "Content": "In the letter, Abigail told Benji she was sick and tired of hearing about the virtues of the Emerald Enclave. She believed they opposed cultural and societal progress, specifically that of technological advancement. She implored Benji to visit her at Gond's High House in [[Baldur's Gate]] and see the wonders her fellow clergy have manufactured.\n\nAbigail closed with an appeal for Benji to write her back soon, and reminded him of their father's upcoming birthday.",
        "History": "Abigail printed several copies of this letter using the mechanical printing press in the High House of Wonders."
