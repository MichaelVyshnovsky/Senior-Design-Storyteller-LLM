        "mainbody": "On the Subject of Gond and Progress was a piece of correspondence between Abigail, a follower of Gond at the High House of Wonders and her brother Benji, a member of the Emerald Enclave.\nIn the letter, Abigail told Benji she was sick and tired of hearing about the virtues of the Emerald Enclave. She believed they opposed cultural and societal progress, specifically that of technological advancement. She implored Benji to visit her at Gonds High House in Baldurs Gate and see the wonders her fellow clergy have manufactured.\nAbigail closed with an appeal for Benji to write her back soon, and reminded him of their fathers upcoming birthday.\nAbigail printed several copies of this letter using the mechanical printing press in the High House of Wonders."
