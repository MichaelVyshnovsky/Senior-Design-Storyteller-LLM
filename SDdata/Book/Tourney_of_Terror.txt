'''''Tourney of Terror''''' is a children's book by [[Madeleine Roux]]. It is the second book in the [[Dungeon Academy (series)|Dungeon Academy series]].
{{Quote|''Someething BIG has come knocking on the gates of [[Dungeon Academy]]! The undefeated [[Waterdeep Dragons]] have arrived for the [[Tourney of Terror]] games, which occur every half century. The [[Dungeon Academy Flumphs|Academy Flumphs]] are outnumbered, outsized and outmonstered. But our her [[Zellidora Stormclash|Zelli Stormclash]]&mdash;is no stranger to impossible odds, and neither are her friends, the [[Danger Club]], who recently battled [[Carrion (necromancer)|a necromancer]] and his army of [[undead]]!<br />
''If the Waterdeep Dragons weren't enough to raise scales, Zelli's recurring nightmare of a dark entity annihilating her world may be more than just a bad dream. Something sinister lurks in the halls of the school, and only Zelli seems to notice. But when Zelli uncovers a dark past hidden deep beneath Dungeon Academy, she unlocks something that will endanger her school, the tournament, and everything within the [[Forgotten Realms]].''
