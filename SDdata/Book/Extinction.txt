'''''Extinction''''' by [[Lisa Smedman]] is the fourth book in the [[War of the Spider Queen]] series.

{{Quote|''Lies, Faith, and Oblivion.''

''The [[Lolth|Queen of the Demonweb Pits]] may have turned her back on even her most faithful servants, or she may now hang lifeless in her own hellish webs. For [[Quenthel Baenre|one priestess]], the only course left open to her is to discover the truth, even if she must return to a place from whence few have returned even once—a place where souls of the dead go to serve for eternity. For [[Halisstra Melarn|another priestess]], the prospect of an [[afterlife]] without the Spider Queen drives her into the arms of another goddess, shattering the tenuous alliances that have brought the [[drow]] to the threshold of the [[Abyss]].''}}

==Summary==
The group of [[drow]] adventurers—[[Quenthel Baenre]], [[Pharaun Mizzrym]], [[Jeggred Baenre]], [[Valas Hune]], [[Ryld Argith]], [[Halisstra Melarn]], and [[Danifae Yauntyrr]] -- continue to seek answers about the [[Silence of Lolth]] after fleeing [[House Jaelre]]. Quenthel sends Halisstra to [[Menzoberranzan]] to report on their progress, then orders Pharaun to summon the [[glabrezu]] [[Belshazu]] in order to determine a way to return to the [[Demonweb Pits]]. While the others are distracted with the demon, Ryld sneaks off to join Halisstra.

After this point, the novel revolves around three distinct plot threads. After abandoning the group, Halisstra and Ryld run into followers of [[Eilistraee]] once again. Halisstra, her faith in [[Lolth]] now shaken, decides to convert to the worship of Eilistraee, despite Ryld's doubts. The two continue to develop a relationship that they even come to term "love," an emotion usually unknown to the drow. After killing a spider as a test of Eilistraee—an unforgivable act in pure defiance of Lolth—Halisstra has a vision telling her that her destiny is to find an ancient magical blade called the [[Crescent Blade]]. The blade is said to be able to cut through anything; she realizes she can use it to slay Lolth. The blade, however, has been lost in the [[Cold Field]]s by Halisstra's ancestor, [[Mathira Melarn]], so Halisstra sets out to find it, Ryld following despite being ordered to stay behind. The guardian of the blade (in that the blade lay in its stomach) is a [[purple worm]], which Ryld helps defeat after Halisstra is swallowed whole by the worm. However, Ryld is badly poisoned; Halisstra retrieves the blade and summons a mount to ride to the forest edge seeking help. Once there, she collapses with cold. She awakens to [[Feliane]] and [[Uluyara]], priestesses of Eilistraee, healing her and Ryld of their wounds.

Meanwhile, in the World Below, Quenthel, Jeggred, Danifae, Pharaun, and Valas follow Belshazu's lead for a route into the [[Abyss]]: a [[ship of chaos]] that can traverse the planes. They travel to [[Lake Thoroot]] and Valas, given a spell of water-breathing by Pharaun, scouts out the water on the search for [[Zanhoriloch]], an [[aboleth]] city where they might locate additional information about the ship of chaos. Valas is captured by the aboleths, who turn him into a mutated sea-dwelling drow. Valas manages to escape and contacts his companions. Pharaun returns him to drow form via [[polymorph]] spell (which can potentially be dispelled). Pharaun and Danifae then go to Zanhoriloch to parlay with [[Oothoon]], the matriarch of the aboleths. Pharaun openly offers to give her Quenthel as payment to knowledge of the whereabouts of the ship. Danifae warns Quenthel, who turns the betrayal around by working with Oothoon to fake her death and allow Pharaun to be eaten. However, a [[contingency]] spell cast of Pharaun allows him to escape and the group sets off together again, this time for the [[Lake of Shadows]] where the ship of chaos is located. They find the ship stuck in a permanent whirlpool, but Pharaun is able to bind the [[uridezu]] captain and set it a sail.

Throughout all of this, Menzoberranzan has been under siege. [[Gromph Baenre]], missing for several weeks after being [[imprisonment|imprisoned]] by [[Lord Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]], escapes his prison with the help of his rat familiar [[Kyorli]] and a [[mindflayer]] named [[Sluuguth]], whom Gromph tricks, through promises of great power, into casting a spell that frees him and imprisons the caster in an axe of souls.  After bolstering the defense of the besieged city, the freed Gromph gathers the mages of [[House Baenre]] to attempt to kill [[Nimor Imphraezl]] through a special [[scrying]] gem.  With each attempt either the spell is turned against the caster, or Nimor uses one of his rings to retreat to the [[Plane of Shadow]] before he can be killed. Taking advantage of this, Gromph and [[Andzrel Baenre]] approach Nimor in the disguise of [[tanarukk]] warriors from the [[Scourged Legion]]. Gromph tricks Nimor into holding a prism of light that has been covered in glue. When he retreats to the Shadow Plane, he is then trapped there since a patch of shadow is required in order to return to the [[Material Plane]]. However, the light from the magical prism leaves Gromph blind. His attempts to heal his eyes fail, so he masks the disability by magically viewing the world through the eyes of his rat familiar.
