        "Powers": "This obviously [[magic item]] was a [[book]] bound in tree bark with pages of pressed dried tree leaves. The book did not have bindings nor glue, instead being held together by magic. When the ''Book of Leaves'' was held by a [[druid]] whose feet touched the ground, tree bark rose from the earth and grew over the druid's body, giving them the defensive benefit of the ''[[barkskin]]'' [[spell]].",
