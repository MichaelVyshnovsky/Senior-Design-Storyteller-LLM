'''''Secret Societies of the Sword Coast: Exposed''''' was a non-fiction [[book]] that outlined several secretive groups that operated throughout the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century.

==Content==
The book shared some insight into four secret societies of the region, some of which were more well-known than others.

===Harpers===
The [[Harpers]] organization was said to be the most famous―or infamous―of the groups described within, even if their actual activities were more secretive. While its members famously said they detested the acquisition of power, the author doubted that was entirely true. The Harpers understood that knowledge is power and, by shrouding their own schemes, they managed to keep a tight grip over both.

===Shadow Druids===
The [[Shadow Druids]] was a group dedicated to the preservation of natural life at the cost of the more-intelligent [[humanoid]] species. They were said to be extremely dangerous, with an ideal about the natural order that would be considered depraved by nearly all peoples.

===The Order of Klurd===
The [[Order of Klurd]] was a sect of conspiratorial killers, despots, and sadists who found pleasure in delivering pain and suffering to others. They were among the lesser-known of the orders outlined in ''Secret Societies''.

===Dark Justiciars===
The author shared no information about the [[Dark Justiciars]], save for their worship of the goddess [[Shar]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Secret Societies of the Sword Coast: Exposed'' could be found in a secret trove in the depths of the [[Emerald Grove]].
