        "Description": "''Player's Option: Skills & Powers'' introduces comprehensive modifications to character creation and development by incorporating a new \"character point\" system. Players utilize these points to acquire abilities for their characters, contingent upon the sufficiency of points available and the compatibility of the ability with the character's class and race.\n\nThe supplement revises the method for generating the six fundamental ability scores, offering players options to adjust these scores post-creation. Each ability score is further divided into two sub-statistics, enabling characters to specialize more deeply by modifying these sub-scores; increasing one at the expense of the other.\n\n''Player's Option: Skills & Powers'' enriches character backstory development with a variety of tools including a table that helps determine the inciting event that led each character into adventuring. It also introduces \"character kits,\" which are thematic packages that establish a character's social rank and modify their abilities accordingly. The book significantly expands the magical framework of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' by introducing four new schools of magic and revising the psionics system.\n\nThe text is structured into nine chapters, preceded by a foreword from authors Niles and Donovan. Chapter One discusses the mechanics of the character points system. Chapter Two elaborates on the division of ability scores into subabilities. Chapter Three examines racial prerequisites for character classes. Chapter Four details modifications to how character classes function within this new system. Chapter Five offers thirty different character kits for detailed character customization. Chapter Six outlines the application of nonweapon proficiencies in gameplay. Chapter Seven explores advanced weapon proficiency and mastery. Chapter Eight introduces five new schools of magic, expanding upon the previous count. Chapter Nine provides a comprehensive update on psionics.\n\nThe supplement concludes with an appendix consolidating various tables used throughout the book and an index.",
