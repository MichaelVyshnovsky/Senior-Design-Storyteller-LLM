The '''''Diaries of Connel Bay''''' were a set of personal journals belonging to the [[warlock]] [[Connel Bay]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Ages Best Forgotten|26}}

==Description==
These tomes described in great detail the [[ritual]] for entering into an [[infernal contract]] with [[Asmodeus]], the same ritual that Connel Bay had undertaken long ago.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Ages Best Forgotten|20-21}} They also contained detailed notes on powerful individuals whom Connel Bay had bribed into providing assistance to his nefarious schemes,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Ages Best Forgotten|4}} as well as notes on various individuals in [[Faer√ªn]] that the warlock had subverted into entering pacts with Asmodeus. These included such people as [[Actilis]] of [[Rashemen]], [[Dreveshnu]] of [[Amn]], and [[Jard le Karn]] of [[Waterdeep]].

The tomes had a [[magic]]al nature to them, making their written word disappear before the eyes of any who looked upon them. Any attempt to cast a [[ritual]] upon them would also make the tomes lose their contents. Only by handling them with the proper magics could one feasibly read their contents.

==History==
Following his death, Connel Bay's diaries were buried with him in his [[Tomb of Connel Bay|tomb]], kept within a chest guarded by many traps.

Around [[1479 DR]],{{4e-time}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from Waterdeep tracked down the long lost Tomb of Connel Bay in [[Ganathwood]] and uncovered these diaries within. They went on to hand the books over to members of the [[Church of Oghma]], one of the few groups at the time that could properly decipher their contents without destroying them in the process.
