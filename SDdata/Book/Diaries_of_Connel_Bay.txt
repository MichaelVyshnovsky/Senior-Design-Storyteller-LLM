The Diaries of Connel Bay were a set of personal journals belonging to the warlock Connel Bay.
These tomes described in great detail the ritual for entering into an infernal contract with Asmodeus, the same ritual that Connel Bay had undertaken long ago. They also contained detailed notes on powerful individuals whom Connel Bay had bribed into providing assistance to his nefarious schemes, as well as notes on various individuals in Faer√ªn that the warlock had subverted into entering pacts with Asmodeus. These included such people as Actilis of Rashemen, Dreveshnu of Amn, and Jard le Karn of Waterdeep.
The tomes had a magical nature to them, making their written word disappear before the eyes of any who looked upon them. Any attempt to cast a ritual upon them would also make the tomes lose their contents. Only by handling them with the proper magics could one feasibly read their contents.
Following his death, Connel Bays diaries were buried with him in his tomb, kept within a chest guarded by many traps.
Around 1479 DR, a group of adventurers from Waterdeep tracked down the long lost Tomb of Connel Bay in Ganathwood and uncovered these diaries within. They went on to hand the books over to members of the Church of Oghma, one of the few groups at the time that could properly decipher their contents without destroying them in the process.
