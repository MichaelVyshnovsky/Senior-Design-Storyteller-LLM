The second volume covered giant insects. And the third volume covered the behaviors of insects that had been created through magical means, such as by the spells creeping doom and insect plague.\nAll three volumes in this series had a green cover.\nA copy of each volume in this series laid within one of the main reading rooms of Bard Keep, a library and temple of Oghma that stood within the North near Silverymoon."
