Lords of [[air]] and [[water]]. This tome is the definitive sourcebook for creating and playing characters with ties to the [[Elemental Chaos]] and the [[primordial]] beings that dwell there. It shows how the elements can influence heroes of the natural world and presents elemental-themed character options for players.''\n\n''In addition to discussing elemental power and presenting new character themes with strong story hooks, this book includes three new class builds—the [[elementalist]], the [[sha'ir]], and the [[shugenja]]—and new feats and paragon paths designed to tie existing characters more closely to the Elemental Chaos.''}}\n[[Category:4th edition sourcebooks]]\n[[Category:Published in 2012]]\n[[Category:Sourcebooks]]\n[[Category:Works by Richard Baker]]\n[[Category:Works by Robert J.
