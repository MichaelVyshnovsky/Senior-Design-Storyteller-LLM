'''''Resurrection''''' by [[Paul S. Kemp]] is the sixth and final book in the [[War of the Spider Queen (novel series)|War of the Spider Queen]] series.

{{Quote|''The [[Lolth|Spider Queen]] has been asleep for a long time, leaving the [[Underdark]] to suffer war and ruin. But if she finally returns, will things get better... or worse?''<br /><br />

''The plot was scripted by the Lady of Chaos, and that was the most perplexing and tantalizing of all. For any road paved by Lolth would not run straight, nor to any expected destination. That was the beauty. The spiders knew it. The time was approaching. The spiders knew it. Eight legs eight clattered on the stones, ticking, ticking, tapping, tapping, patience twisted, stretched and torn asunder. Eight legs, eight.''}}

==Summary==
In the new [[Demonweb Pits]] the story of [[Quenthel Baenre]]'s group comes to a close as they trek across the barren plane to [[Lolth]]'s temple to see who will became the new ''[[Chosen#Chosen of Lolth|Yor'thae]]'' (the Chosen of Lolth)

Quenthel, her strength and faith apparently fully restored, continues to move towards Lolth, fully under the belief that she is the ''Yor'thae''.  With her are [[Pharaun Mizzrym]], [[Jeggred Baenre]], and [[Danifae Yauntyrr]]. Jeggred is now fully devoted to Danifae, while Pharaun's allegiance leans towards Quenthel, though no trust is held between them. Meanwhile, [[Halisstra Melarn]], having joined up with fellow priestesses of [[Eilistraee]], [[Uluyara]] and [[Feliane]], continues on her journey to kill Lolth, but determines that she must first kill the ''Yor'thae''. Halisstra believes that person to be [[Quenthel Baenre]].

Quenthel's and Halisstra's groups meet at the [[Pass of the Soulreaver]], a mysterious place located by the [[Soulreaver]] beast and individual trials that the faithful must pass to reach Lolth. Before entering the pass, Halisstra and her fellow priestesses attack Quenthel, relying on Danifae's aid. However, Danifae betrays them; Feliane and Uluyara are killed and Halisstra is fatally wounded by Danifae. Cursing the betrayal, and lack of intervention by Eilistraee, she renounces her faith yet again, returning to the darkness of Lolth. She manages a healing spell, saving herself from death, and she follows Danifae, Quenthel, Jeggred and Pharaun into the Path of the Soulreaver. In order to pass over to Lolth's realm, the females who enter the pass undergo tests of faith, including viewing themselves in the future having been rejected as the ''Yor'thae''. 

In [[Menzoberranzan]], the [[duergar]] invasion has been squashed, and [[House Xorlarrin]] lays siege to the traitor [[House Agrach Dyrr]] on orders from Matron Mother [[Triel Baenre]]. The [[phylactery]] of the [[Lord Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]] is hidden away within the house, and [[Gromph Baenre]] undergoes a mission to breach the wards placed around the house and destroy it. Using [[scrying]] techniques, he discovers the phylactery is hidden within the house's temple, and disguises himself to gain entry. Once inside, he engages in a battle with an obsidian golem, the protector of the phylactery. He defeats the golem in the form of [[Larikal Dyrr]]. Once he passes the wards on the phylactery, he cleaves it with an enchanted axe, trapping the Lichdrow's soul within the axe. Upon the destruction of the phylactery, the master ward is activated, causing the complete destruction of the temple and damage to the rest of the Agrach Dyrr complex. However, Gromph teleports out just in time due to a ''[[contingency]]'' evasion spell.

Back in the Demonweb Pits, the Quenthel and company come upon the [[Plains of Soulfire]] and encounter the [[Black Horn Regiment]] led by [[Inthracis]] of [[Corpsehaven]], a [[yugoloth]] ordered by the god [[Vhaeraun]] to kill the [[Chosen#Chosen of Lolth|Yor'thae]]. Quenthel summons a great demon to assist their fight, while Danifae calls upon Lolth to send millions of spiders to their aid. Pharaun takes on Inthracis himself, and eventually defeats the yugoloth. However, in the process he essentially petrifies himself, although he is able use his magical ring to fly back to Quenthel for aid. Quenthel, however, takes his ring and leaves him to be devoured by hordes of black spiders; only his finger (later retrieved up by [[Aliisza]]) remains.

With the battle raging, Halisstra joins the others on the Planes of Soulfire. The three priestesses make their way to Lolth's tabernacle. Once inside, Danifae is consumed by the eighth of Lolth's eight spider manifestations. Suddenly the other seven manifestations attack the eighth, and from the carnage steps Danifae Yauntyrr, transformed into half-drow and half-spider, the ''Yor'thae'' and the new face of Lolth. Quenthel is ordered to go back to Menzoberranzan and be restored as the Mistress of [[Arach-Tinilith]]. Halisstra, however, is punished for her unforgivable acts of disloyalty and sacrilege, and is ordered to serve as Lolth's [[Lady Penitent]]. Upon her exit from the tabernacle, Quenthel sacrifices Jeggred to the new incarnation of Lolth, allowing spiders to feed on his flesh.

Thus ends the War of the Spider Queen.
