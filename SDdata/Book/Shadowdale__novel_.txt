Shadowdale by Scott CiencinThe first three novels of the Avatar series were originally released under the pen-name "Richard Awlinson." is the first book of the Avatar series.
In the first part of the book, the adventurers Kelemvor Lyonsbane, Midnight, Cyric, and Adon are presented as they join in a party to rescue a lady, who actually is the goddess Mystra, held captive by the avatar of Bane. Midnight also receives a token of Mystras power during the quest. The group eventually manage to help the goddess, who proceeds to defeat Bane. Mystra then tries to ascend to the gods world to provide Ao with the names of those responsible for the theft of the Tablets of Fate, but she is destroyed by Helm by Aos order, since the Overgod wants the Tablets themselves back. In her last moment, the goddess pleads for the adventurers to rescue the Tablets and to ask for Elminsters help on their quest.
In the second part of the book, the adventurers face a difficult travel to Shadowdale, home of Elminster. All the land is scarred and deformed by the violent death of the goddess Mystra, making travel dangerous and deadly. The party manages to reach Shadowdale only thanks to the power Mystra granted to Midnight. During the journey, Midnight and Kelemvor establish a sentimental bond between each other, while Cyric starts to develop some feeling toward the woman. In the meanwhile, Adons faith in Sune is shattered as a consequence of a serious face injury, which gives him a disfiguring scar. The adventurers reach Shadowdale just before a battle begins Bane marches to war on Shadowdale with two goals in his mind destruction and preventing the involvement of Elminster. The battle is won and Bane apparently destroyed by an apparition of Mystra, but Elminster disappears in the huge energy generated by the event. The book ends with the adventurers accused of the death of Old Sage.
