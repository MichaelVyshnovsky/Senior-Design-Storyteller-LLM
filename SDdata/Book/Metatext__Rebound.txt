'''''Metatext: Rebound''''' was a collection of writings by [[Iosefa Elgin]] that sought to reconstruct the ''[[Metatext]]'', the collection of esoteric knowledge that once granted [[Deneir]] his status as a [[deity]].

{{Quote|If a true assessment of the journey is to be made, then there is simply no replacement for embarking upon it oneself. Perhaps, one day, this great volume of learning will make me worthy enough to walk that path - and wealthy enough to return.|''Excerpt from Iosefa Elgin's Metatext: Rebound, discussing the topic of resurrection.''}}

==Description==
The various volumes of the book were described as being rather thin.

==Contents==
===On Death & Resurrection===
This section of the book spoke to the measurable value of a life and a soul, as it was assigned the judgement of the god [[Kelemvor]]. It noted that while those that lived a life worthy to be [[resurrection (spell)|brought back from the dead]] could seldom afford such a blessing, those that could hardly lived in a manner that warranted the return trip.

The author sought to gain firsthand experience about the journey of death and return, once she was both deserving and rich enough to afford it.

===The Leadership of the Zhentarim===
Iosefa Elgin wrote about the continued influence the [[Banite]] church had on the Zhentarim of the late 15{{th}} century. The section spoke of the [[Pereghost]], the mysterious armored warlord who ruled over the fortress of [[Darkhold]] in the [[Sunset Mountains]]. It asserted that the Zhentarim had not in fact changed their ultimate goal of dominion over the Realms, as some were led to believe, but merely changed their overarching strategy.

==History==
Iosefa Elgin was outcast from the [[church of Deneir]] for the heresy of writing ''Metatext: Rebound''.
