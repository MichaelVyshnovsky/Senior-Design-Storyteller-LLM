        "Summary": "The Lone Drow starts with the orc chieftain [[Obould Many-Arrows]] addressing his followers. He wishes to destroy the [[dwarves]] of [[Mithral Hall]]. Drizzt in the meantime thinks only about one thing, the fact that he saw an entire tower of stone fall upon his friends, [[Catti-brie]], [[Bruenor]], [[Regis]] and [[Wulfgar]]. They are, unbeknownst to him, still alive, but he blames the orcs and goes into a wild frenzy in which he becomes a feared hunter and killer. Tarathiel and Innovindel try to engage Drizzt to learn the fate of their female companion, [[Ellifain Tuuserail|Ellifain]]. Later the orc [[shaman]] [[Arganth Snarrl]] proclaims Obould a god. In a special ceremony, Obould is confronted by both a large mountain [[cat]] and a bull to prove that he is as strong as Snarrl had claimed, with [[Gruumsh]] on his side. If Snarrl had been mistaken, and Obould had not been able to break the cat's back and turn the bull's head around, Obould would have, as he claimed, staked Snarrl to a wall and eaten him alive. Obould sends his son to war in order to tire the forces of [[Clan Battlehammer]].",
