The Shadowtome was an arcane spellbook penned by the mysterious wizard known only as Shadowhands. It contained 9 spells ranging from common to unique or rare.
A pair of wooden covers protected the beaten electrum pages within the book. Stretched black and silver crocodile skin covered the wood. The book had a single clasp that looked like a black human hand that swiveled to grab a bestial hooked tail.
The Shadowtome contained the following spells
dispel magic • missile mastery • nightscar • polymorph other • animate dead • cloudkill • lesser ironguard • death spell • backlash
The tome was initially found in Calimport by Azkhazan. It changed hands several times after that, even passing into Elminsters care for a brief period.
