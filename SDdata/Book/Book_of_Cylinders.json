            "Contents": "The writing on the cylinders was mostly [[Dethek]] characters interspersed with pictographs that, when combined, told a story about the plight of a grippli community.\n\nThe first cylinder explained how grippli harvested [[giant crab]]s and sold these to seagoing vessels. The second showed yuan-ti lurking at the edges of the grippli village before suddenly attacking, killing or capturing the grippli they could get their hands on; the giant crabs of the grippli escaping from their cages in the tumult. The third cylinder showed the aftermath of the assault: the village flattened and devoid of life, the village temple taken over by yuan-ti."

        "History": "The ''Book of Cylinders'' arrived at [[Candlekeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, as part of a greater collection discovered in the ruins of an old keep in [[Tethyr]]. The [[adventurer]]s who delivered the collection warned the [[Avowed]] that the ''Book of Cylinders'' prophesied events that would come to pass at some point in the future.\n[[File:Book of Cylinders cylinders.png|thumb|250px|''The cylinders contained within the \"book\".]]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a grippli community in the [[Cloak Wood]] suffered depredations much like those described in the ''Book of Cylinders''. This village was a trading partner of Candlekeep, providing the fortress library with giant crab meat through intermediary traders. Having been warned of how the grippli village was under attack by \"serpent creatures\" by the merchant [[Mitor Jans]], the Avowed [[Pelk]] put two and two together: the ''Book of Cylinders'' must have been describing this exact scenario. She approached a group of visiting adventurers hoping to convince them to aid the ailing grippli."
