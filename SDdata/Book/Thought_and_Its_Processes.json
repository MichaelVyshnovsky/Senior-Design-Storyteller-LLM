        "mainbody": "Thought and Its Processes by Trelaphin was a nonfiction book published in Faer√ªn. It discussed logic, reasoning, and deduction. It had one volume.\nThe retired War Wizard and sage Benelaius had a copy in his library at his home near Ghars, Cormyr. His servant Jasper read it in 1366/1367 DR. He dared to suggest that the deductions of the great detective Camber Fosrick in The Adventures of Camber Fosrick was \"the same sort of thing\" as in Thought and Its Processes, which outraged Benelaius, who hated the Fosrick stories.\nA copy was kept in Candlekeep around 1372 DR."
