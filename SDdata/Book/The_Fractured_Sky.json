        "mainbody": "The Fractured Sky is the second book in The Empyrean Odyssey trilogy by Thomas M. Reid.\nHaving successfully reached the House of the Triad by deceiving Kaanyr Vhok, the Cyricist priest Zasian Menz possesses the body of the storm dragon Tekthyrios and heads for the magical waters of the Lifespring. Along the way, Myshik Morueme, who had been following Zasian and Vhok, passes through the portal in the dragons stomach and agrees to serve Tekthyrios, not knowing it is fact one of the men he is hunting.\nMeanwhile, the astral deva Tauran convinces Vhok to agree to go under geas to help him stop Zasian in exchange for Vhok being allowed to bathe in the Lifespring, his goal all along. Aliisza joins Tauran, Vhok, and her Kael in searching for Zasian. As they search, destructive storms batter the plane as the gods Helm and Tyr fight in the heavens. Tauran and his group stop to rescue helpless citizens of the house, Vhok forced by the geas and Aliisza developing a moral code.\nTauran and his group stand before the High Council in Tyrs Court and proclaim their intentions to hunt down Zasian. The High Council refuses to be involved with fiends such as Vhok and Aliisza and orders Tauran to leave the matter alone. Tauran, however, feels that Tyrs judgment has been compromised and Cyric is involved, and so he feels obligated to continue his search even without the Councils approval. As they argue, Tyr slays Helm and the sky fractures, destroying the room where the High Council meets.\nAt the same time, Zasian and Myshik free Kashada the Nightwraith, a servant of Shar who had been imprisoned for twelve years after posing as Helm Dwarf-Friends maidservant Ansa (the same role Aliisza had played before her capture by Banites). They head for the gateway between the House of the Triad and the World Tree, where they destroy a village of dryads in order to leave a trail for Tauran.\nTauran is attacked by his friend Micus and other archons, who believe that Tauran has lost his faith and become a rogue force. Vhok is captured but freed by Aliisza, who disguises herself as Micus. The group then travels to Dweomerheart to seek the aid of Savras the All-Seeing. They are detained by guards upon entering Dweomerheart and given food that puts them asleep. When they wake and realize theyve been tricked, they escape, but not before learning that Micus is behind their detainment. \nAfter escaping, Tauran and his group travel to the Third Eye, where they see visions of Zasian and Kashada stealing Azuths staff for Cyric to kill Mystra. Somehow the group is split Aliisza is left behind, while Tauran, Kael, and Vhok travel to the Hall of Petitions to warn Azuth. Micus approaches Aliisza and asks her to convince Tauran to stand down peacefully Aliisza agrees, thinking she can prevent the chaos that would allow Zasian and Kashada to steal Azuths staff. However, when the three groups converge — Taurans group, Zasian and Kashada, and Micus and Aliisza — Kashada kills Zasian and is revealed to be an aspect of the goddess Shar.\n*Kaanyr Vhok, cambion\n*Aliisza, alu-fiend\n*Tauran, astral deva servant of Tyr\n*Eirwyn, deva augur of Helm\n*Kael, half-drow paladin of Torm\n*Kashada, servant/aspect of Shar\n*Micus, astral deva servant of Tyr\n*Myshik Morueme, draconic hobgoblin\n*Tekthyrios, storm dragon\n*Zasian Menz, priest of Cyric\n*Azuth, god\n*Garin, angel\n*Helm Dwarf-Friend, leader of Sundabar\n*Shar, goddess\n*Mystra\n*Helm\n*Savras\n*Tyr\n*House of the Triad\n*World Tree\n*Dweomerheart\n*Plane of Shadow\n*Prime Material Plane/Toril Sundabar\nAstral deva • Draconic hobgoblin (half-blue dragon, half-hobgoblin) • Dryad • Ghaele • Hound archon • Lantern archon • Mercane • Planetar • Solar • Shadow • Storm dragon • Treant • wood element creature (dire bear) • Zelekhut\nAzuths staff • Burnblood • Lifespring • Spitefang"
