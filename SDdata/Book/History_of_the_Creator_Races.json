        "mainbody": "'''''History of the Creator Races''''' was a history book that compiled knowledge of [[Iquar'Tel'Quessir]], published sometime before the [[Old One]]s' resurgence in [[1372 DR]]. Sages argued over the book's reliability and sources.",
        "Contents": "The book talked about the period of time called the [[Days of Thunder]] when the Iquar'Tel'Quessir, or [[creator race]]s reigned over [[Toril]]. These ancient civilizations were said to erect grand cities, cover the wildlands with roads, and  were in a constant state of war with each other.\n\nThe first creator race the book named was a saurial race (likely referring to [[Sarrukh]] or Old Ones), that eventually splintered into the races of [[naga]]s, [[lizardfolk]], [[troglodyte]]s and other races that shared the lizard traits. The book claimed their civilization was known to be sprawling but not blessed with longevity.\n\nThe book named [[dragon]]s as the second of the creator races, to a dismissal of many sages. These creator dragons were known for their fierce power and them raising other creator races' cities. The book gave the ancient dragons the majority of the land during the Days of Thunder, claiming they battled each other as much as they did other races over dominance, status, and mating privileges. The book also claimed the dragons' dominance was thwarted by the lesser races' developing the use of arcane magic.\n\nThe third creator race was the aquatic one, developing in the later stage of the saurial race's existence, as per the book's author (this race was likely the [[Batrachi]]). This race was known for its [[shapechange]]ing abilities. They build their empire in the seas and oceans as well as inland. According to the book, their invasion of the land territories contributed to the saurial race's eventual downfall. This race eventually degraded culturally, depending into barbarism from the creeping younger races of [[sahuagin]], [[merfolk]], and [[triton]]s. The sages claimed [[locathah]], [[tako]], and [[doppelganger]]s were the results of the aquatic race's decline.\n\nThe book named the sylvan race as one of the other creator races (likely referring to the [[fey]]). They dominated the forest regions of the ancient world. The self-sustaining harmonic existence with nature was the civilization's main trait. The book's author assumed the sylvan race was fractured after a great plague caused by either dragons or [[demon]]s. This race spawned [[sprite]]s, [[korred]]s, and other fey creatures, according to the ''History of the Creator Races''.\n\nThe last creator race this book named were [[human]]s, the race that was renowned for their adaptability and its more prolonged period of primitive development. The decline and fall of other creator races allowed the humans to swiftly develop into the modern humans of the 14{{th}} century DR when the brook was written.\n\nThe book closed on the statement that all of the creator races but humans and dragons were long gone. In the years that followed, that statement became outdated.",
        "History": "Copies of ''History of the Creator Races'' book could be found around [[Neverwinter]], and the general area of the [[Sword Coast North]] ''circa'' 1372 DR."
