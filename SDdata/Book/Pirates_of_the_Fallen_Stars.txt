Pirates of the Fallen Stars is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
Pirates of the Fallen Stars is the 3 book in the FOR series.
Pirates of the Fallen Stars begins with a one-page introduction titled "A Pirates Life for Me." The initial chapter explores the psyche and way of life characteristic of pirates. It provides an elucidation of piracy, an historical overview of piracy within the Forgotten Realms setting, descriptions of a selection of notable pirate organizations, and an exploration of the religious practices common among pirates. The subsequent chapter outlines guidelines for the creation of pirate characters and introduces new spells. The third chapter examines the nations bordering the inner sea, including Cormyr and Sembia, highlighting their interactions with piracy and smuggling activities. In the fourth chapter, a detailed account of the geography and socio-political landscape of the Pirate Isles is presented. The fifth chapter profiles nine infamous pirates who navigate the Sea of Fallen Stars. Chapter six catalogs various vessels that sail the inner sea, such as galleys and galleons, which are prevalent in the Sea of Fallen Stars. The seventh chapter introduces specific rules governing movement and combat at sea. Chapter eight contains an adventure scenario titled Raid on Teziir, designed for 5-8 player characters at levels 5-7. The closing pages feature a glossary of nautical vernacular, or "pirate-speak," commonly used aboard ships.
