What separates it from past volumes is the level of detail given to each creature subtype, including probable behavior in combat and even a complete pre-prepared encounter complete with a map.\nEach entry also contains a table listing DC ratings for skill checks made using the Knowledge ability. In general, a low DC check results in revealing all the monsters subtype traits to the player, while higher ratings reveal their origins or various special offensive and defensive abilities. \nMonster Manual IV uses the new stat block format that was introduced in the Dungeon Masters Guide II. Monster Manual IV contained fewer actual monsters than Monster Manual II and Monster Manual III, but had sample lairs and encounters for them, gave stats for classes and templates applied to old creatures, and full page maps.\n (, , , ) •  •  •  (, , ) •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  (, , , ) •  (, , ) •  •  (, , , ) •  •  (, , ) •  (, , ) •  •  () •  •  •  •  (, , , , ) •  •  (, , ) •  •  •  •  •  •  •  (, , ) •  (, , , , ) •  •  •  •  •  (, , , , , , , , , , , , , ) •  (, ) •  () •  •  •  (, ) •  •  •  (, , , ) •  (, , ) •  (, )\nMonster Manual IV Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover"
