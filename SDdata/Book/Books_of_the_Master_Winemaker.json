        "mainbody": "The Books of the Master Winemaker was an extremely valuable set of twelve books that detailed the art of growing, caring for, and harvesting of grapes and the fermentation of quality wine.\nCollectively, the twelve volumes were a complete guide to winemaking. The information within was detailed and guided the reader in selecting the land where a vineyard could be built, designed, and constructed growing and tending to grapevines and harvesting techniques. The tomes also detailed differences between varieties of grapes, the fermentation process, and various techniques and tools needed to produce the best-quality wines. Their guidance was detailed enough to offer a guide on tailoring flavors and aromas of the produced wine.\nBeing one of the most detailed guides to the art of winemaking, Books of the Master Winemaker was an excellent teaching tool. Diligent students could use the books to master the skill, given enough time and a winery with which to practice. They required a year of study and practice to become masters of the craft.\nA full set of the Books of the Master Winemaker was kept at the Morden Winery near the town of Dragon Falls in the Vast, before the region suffered from the Grand Army of the Tuigan invading Faer√ªn and being repelled in the . A decade later, the winery was under the management of the maedar Vorlon, and over the years of running the enterprise, he learned and mastered the winemaking skill from the books. When the winerys rightful owner, Shauna Morden, reclaimed the land, a group of adventurers helped her and Vorlon come to an agreement. As one of the rewards, the heroes were granted the full set of the Books of the Master Winemaker or at least a copy of the set."
