"Assassins Shadow" is a short story by Jess LeBow that appeared in the Realms of Shadow anthology of stories from the Forgotten Realms, published in April 2002.
In a musty cellar Olostin met with a veiled figure, they reminisced about Olostins successes over the years thanks to the knowledge and power the figure gave him. Olostin vowed to end the archwizards rule, and the figure asked him to eliminate the archwizard Shadow before he could learn more about the Shadow Weave and become a significant threat. The action shifted to Cy, one of Olostins raiders. During an attack on the Low Netherese village of Kath, Cy killed a powerful, chain-wielding man. Having seen his valor, Cys commander Lume recruited him to assassinate Shadow. Cy took a two day long griffon ride to the floating city Karsus. He failed to assassinate Shadow but learned Shadow had a powerful wand, before he escaped while another group attempted to kill Shadow. When he returned to Lume, the commander revealed he had sent countless others to accomplish the same task, and Cy was the only one ever to return. They went together to try again, against Cys better judgment. Lume stole and used the wand, but it backfired and killed him instead of Shadow.
Olostin was said to have perished from incineration by a fireball cast at higher than 34th level in -477 DR, 10 years prior to the date in the story. No one in the story acknowledged his death, but rather talked as if he was alive. There is not a clear, single, correct way to rectify this discrepancy.
