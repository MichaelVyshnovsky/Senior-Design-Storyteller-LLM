        "mainbody": "he Mines of Bloodstone is a 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure that was later retconned into the Forgotten Realms. It features the Battlesystem tabletop rules.\nThe Mines of Bloodstone is a sequel to Bloodstone Pass which although originally a stand-alone adventure, was now to be the first in the four part Bloodstone Pass saga. This module continued the generic campaign setting of Bloodstone Pass, although later modules in the series retconned Bloodstone into the Forgotten Realms.\nThe modules contains options for use of the Dungeoneers Survival Guide and Wilderness Survival Guide game manuals, both new at the time. It also includes two battles where players command an army using the Battlesystem rules. For players without Battlesytem these battles can occur \"off stage\" while the players make a raid that otherwise occurs after the battles.\nThe characters need to journey through a blizzard to get to the Bloodstone Mines, which lead to the duergar kingdom of Deepearth, and the Temple of Orcus.\nThe adventure begins with a set of village encounters, before some further encounters in a big valley. The player characters then proceed into the Mines of Bloodstone, where the duergar and svirfneblin are at war, and then on to the demonic temple of Orcus of the duergar. This is an attempt to gain an ancient treasure to help the beleaguered innocent citizens of Bloodstone Pass.\n* Introduction\n* Chapter 1 A Hard Winter\n* Chapter 2 The Big Valley\n* Chapter 3 The Bloodstone Mines\n* Chapter 4 Kingdoms of Deepearth\n* Chapter 5 Council of War\n* Chapter 6 The Temple of Orcus\n* Epilogue\n* Pregenerated Player Characters\n* New Monsters\n • Aldric •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • Orcolla • Orcus • Quillan •  •  •  •  •  • Tranth •  • \n •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • catoblepas • centaur • displacer beast •  • duergar •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • hill dwarf •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • svirfneblin •  •  • vampire •  •  •  • worg • \n •  •  •  •  • \nBuildings\nInns\nLandmarks Bloodstone Mines\nMountains Galena Mountains\nNations  ()\nRegions Northeast Faerûn • Underdark\nRoads Bloodstone Pass\nSettlements Bloodstone Village • Deepearth\nClothing\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPotions\n •  •  • \nPsionics\n •  •  • \nSpellscontinual light •  •  •  •  • gate • magic jar\nWeapons\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n • \nOrcus • St. Sollars\nArmor chain mail • plate mail • shield\nEvents\n •  • \nFood & Drinks  • \nGemstones bloodstone\nItems  •  •  •  • pick •  •  •  • \n • \nVessels \nWeapons crossbow • short sword • throwing axe • warhammer\nThe Mines of Bloodstone Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Design Michael Dobson, Douglas Niles\n* Editing Mike Breault\n* Cover Art Keith Parkinson\n* Interior Art Graham Nolan\n* Cartography Dave LaForce, Tom Darden, Gloria Habriga\n* Typography Betty Elmore\n* Graphic Design Cohen OMalley, Dennis Kauth, Stephanie Tabat"
