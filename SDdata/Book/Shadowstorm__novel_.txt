'''Shadowstorm''' is the second book in the [[The Twilight War]] trilogy by [[Paul S. Kemp]].

{{quote|''The archwizards of [[Thultanthar|Shade Enclave]] have come out of the [[Anauroch|desert]] with a message of peace, and an act of war. Split by petty disputes and causeless feuds, the merchant realm of [[Sembia]] is wide open for invasion, and with no shortage of Sembians more than happy to sell out to the [[Shadovar]], can only one man—even if that man is [[Erevis Cale]]—do anything to stop it?''}}

==Summary==
After escaping [[Sakkors]] with [[Magadon Kest]] in tow, the trio find themselves in [[Cania]] at the whim of [[Mephistopheles]].  [[Erevis Cale]] makes a deal with the [[archdevil]], for their freedom.  It is only after the bargain is struck that Mephistopheles rips his son's soul in two, keeping part for himself to ensure Erevis keeps his word.

Setting forth into the [[Plane of Shadow]], the three set out to do as Cale has promised, only to find they are set upon by the shadow dragon [[Furlinastis]]. They make yet another bargain, this time to hunt down [[Kesson Rel]].  All the while, [[Netheril]] continues its plotting and scheming to bring Sembia into their empire.  It is [[Selgaunt]] versus Sembia while the [[Saerb]] just try to survive the civil war with the help of [[Abelar Corrinthal]] and his father.
