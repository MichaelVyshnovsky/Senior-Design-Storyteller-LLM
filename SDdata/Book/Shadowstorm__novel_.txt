Shadowstorm is the second book in the The Twilight War trilogy by Paul S. Kemp.
After escaping Sakkors with Magadon Kest in tow, the trio find themselves in Cania at the whim of Mephistopheles.  Erevis Cale makes a deal with the archdevil, for their freedom.  It is only after the bargain is struck that Mephistopheles rips his sons soul in two, keeping part for himself to ensure Erevis keeps his word.
Setting forth into the Plane of Shadow, the three set out to do as Cale has promised, only to find they are set upon by the shadow dragon Furlinastis. They make yet another bargain, this time to hunt down Kesson Rel.  All the while, Netheril continues its plotting and scheming to bring Sembia into their empire.  It is Selgaunt versus Sembia while the Saerb just try to survive the civil war with the help of Abelar Corrinthal and his father.
