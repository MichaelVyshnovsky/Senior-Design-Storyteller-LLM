The '''Tome of Twelve Seals''' was a unique, [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[book]].

==Description==
This tome was a thick book whose cover was made from the [[dragonhide|underbelly hide]] of a [[red dragon]]. Bound within the book was a total of twelve thick, black leather pages. Attached to each of these pages was a single, rune-inscribed metal disk, evocative of a seal like one might find on a door or urn.

Originally all twelve of these seals were made made of [[gold]] and quite shiny, but over time they lost their luster, became charred, and turned into lead.

==Powers==
The runes etched on each seal within the ''Tome of Twelve Seals'' was a [[command word]] that activated their seal's effect. The golden seals, when activated, would conjure one of many types of monster as if by a ''[[summon monster]]'' [[spell]].

The first seal would conjure an [[air elemental]], the second would conjure a [[fire elemental]], the fourth would conjure an [[earth elemental]], the fifth would conjure a [[dragon horse]], the eighth would conjure a [[gibbering mouther]], the ninth would conjure a [[jann]], and the tenth would conjure a [[marid]]. Those pages not mentioned had lost their magic and would not conjure anything.

Upon activating one of these seals, they would unleash a blinding flash and transform into lead, becoming inert.

==History==
By [[1358 DR]], five of the tome's seals had become inert. The seals that had become inert were on pages three, six, seven, eleven, and twelve.

In 1358 DR, the tome was one of many belongings of a reclusive [[wizard]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] that were being sold at an estate auction. During this auction, a group of [[thieves]] and an [[illusionist]] stole the ''Tome of Twelve Seals'', fleeing with it to the [[Kraken Society]]'s headquarters in [[Yartar]].

By [[1372 DR]], two more of the tome's seals had become inert. These seals were those that had contained a dragon horse and marid.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some speculated that other books similar to the Tome of Twelve Seals might have existed, but with a different cover or creatures sealed within them.
