        "mainbody": "he Ghost of Conyberry was a book about the infamous banshee of the Conyberry area, Agatha, popular circa 1372 DR.\nThe Ghost of Conyberry talked about the ghost of Neverwinter Wood, who, in reality, was a banshee named Agatha. Her name was likely a corruption of the elven last name \"Auglathla\" which meant \"Winterbreeze\" in an old dialect. The book described Agathas Grove, her lair to be located in Neverwinter Wood, northwest of Conyberry, at the end of a path marked by a strand of birch trees.\nThe book next goes into describing Agathas lairs past defenses, such as the magic mirror spell that was set up to pummel intruders with magic. The book mentions two adventurers who broke that defense, Drizzt DoUrden and Wulfgar son of Beornegar in 1356 DR. Since then, Agatha expanded her treasure hoard by stealing precious items under the cover of night, ambushing and killing traveling merchants, and scavenging through ancient ruins. She remembered Drizzt and Wulfgars theft and retaliated with death against anyone foolish enough to search for the banshees treasure.\nThe book also talks about the most recent updates on the Ghosts of Conyberry activities circa 1370s DR. By that time, Agatha expanded her lairs defenses. She used her magic to charm people of Conyberry into constructing pitfall traps all throughout the pathway to her grove and posting regular enthralled guards. Apart from these magical commands, she did not bother the people of Conyberry, seeing them as allies rather than enemies or slaves. In exchange for their unwilling labor, Agatha sent them the beasts of Neverwinter Wood in the times of tumult and bad winters and killed any orc bands off that threatened the village. The book stated that the villages of Conyberry treated Agatha with respect and called her a guardian and a friend.\nCopies of the Ghost of Conyberry book could be found around the areas of Neverwinter, Daggerford, and the Sword Coast North  circa 1372 DR."
