The Hound and the Hand was a book of the Tyrran faith printed sometime in the late 15 century DR.
The book retold the story of how the deity of law Tyr lost his hand to the primordial evil of Kezef the Chaos Hound. The story talked about how the gods stood united against Kezef, forcing him to the Barrens of Doom and Despair. They ended up offering the primordial a deal if Kezef was able to break chains forged by Gond, using Cocytus metal, and reinforced by Mystras magic, then the hound would be left alone by the deities. Kezef agreed, but only if Tyr held his hand in the hounds mouth. Kezef knew that he would not be able to break free but if he were to be chained, he could take Tyrs hand. Since then, the Maimed God was one-handed.
In the , a copy of The Hound and the Hand could be found in the library of the Stormshore Tabernacle in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate, stored near the altar and statue dedicated to Tyr.
