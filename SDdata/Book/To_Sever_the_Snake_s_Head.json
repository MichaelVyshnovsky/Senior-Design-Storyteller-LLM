        "mainbody": "'''To Sever the Snake's Head''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.\n\nThis was the final Tides of War adventure and also the final Legacy of the Green Regent module to be published before the campaign was abandoned. It was hoped that the campaign would continue and one more module had already been planned but it was never written.",
        "Plot": "With a massive attack against the city of [[Loudwater]] expected to come within a week and allies from Silverymoon being sparse, the party are asked to slip past enemy lines and kill the leaders of the [[Zhentarim]] and [[devil]]ish army. Loudwater's leaders hope that if the party cause enough deaths in the higher ranks of the coming force that they will be easier to defeat or, even better, the enemy will abandon the attack altogether."
