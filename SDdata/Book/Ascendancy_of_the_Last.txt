Ascendancy of the Last is the third and final novel in The Lady Penitent trilogy by Lisa Smedman.
The end to the Lady Penitent trilogy reveals the epic climax and aftermath of the sava match between Lolth and Eilistraee.
Lolth unleashes an all-out assault against Eilistraees worshipers in the form of Ghaunadaur and his minions, both ooze and drow, and succeeds in killing both Eilistraee and her high priestess Qilue. While Lolths offensive is a success, Eilistraee proves she is just as capable as her mother of weaving webs of deceit and misdirection (courtesy of her merger with Vhaeraun) as she uses Qarlynd yet again to achieve victory from within the depths of defeat by neutralizing the taint that the demon lord Wendonai had corrupted the ancient drow bloodlines at Lolths behest. While Lolths plan succeeds in finally defeating her wayward daughter Eilistraees final ploy introduces an even more powerful player to the sava gameboard to take her place.
