'''''Ascendancy of the Last''''' is the third and final novel in [[The Lady Penitent]] trilogy by [[Lisa Smedman]].

{{Quote|''Is it the end for the [[Lady Penitent]]? Is it the end for [[Lolth]]?''

''Lolth has come out of hibernation with a plan that may seem too ambitious even for her, and to pull it off she'll need the help of a [[drow]] who's betrayed her at least once already—a drow she's transformed into the [[demon]]ic Lady Penitent. The shocking conclusion to a trilogy that will change the [[Forgotten Realms]] world forever.''|Ascendancy of the Last}}

== Summary ==
The end to the Lady Penitent trilogy reveals the epic climax and aftermath of the [[sava]] match between [[Lolth]] and [[Eilistraee]].

Lolth unleashes an all-out assault against Eilistraee's worshipers in the form of [[Ghaunadaur]] and his minions, both [[ooze]] and [[drow]], and succeeds in killing both Eilistraee and her high priestess [[Qilue]]. While Lolth's offensive is a success, Eilistraee proves she is just as capable as her mother of weaving webs of deceit and misdirection (courtesy of her merger with [[Vhaeraun]]) as she uses [[Q'arlynd]] yet again to achieve victory from within the depths of defeat by neutralizing the taint that the demon lord [[Wendonai]] had corrupted the ancient drow bloodlines at Lolth's behest. While Lolth's plan succeeds in finally defeating her wayward daughter; Eilistraee's final ploy introduces an even more powerful player to the sava gameboard to take her place.
