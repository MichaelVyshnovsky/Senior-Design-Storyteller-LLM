        "mainbody": "History of the North was a seven-volume collection of history books that chronicled the tumultuous history of North Faerûn, published sometime before 1312 DR. The volumes were not published in chronological other, and rather were broken up thematically.\nThe first volume covered the period of time known as the First Flowering. The book opened with the realms of Illefarn and Eaerlann, inhabited by gold elves for millennia before the city of Waterdeep was settled. The elves of the frost cities traded with ancient human nations of Netheril and Illusk. During that time, goblin raids were a common threat that was regularly repelled away from the civilized lands. The dwarven kingdom of Delzoun was the union of various clans under the leadership of the dwarf named Delzoun. The dwarven nation existed under the stretch of land from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. The volume ended with the invasion of the orcs from the Spine of the World. The gold elves defeated the horde. The defeat cemented the Spine of the World as the homeland of the orcs and their kin in the North Faerûn.\nThe second volume of the series focused on the arrival of humans to the North and the Crown Wars. The tome stated that the humans of the North arrived from the Shining Sea, tricking in small bands of settlers. They moved up the Sword Coast, settling the lands. With time humans became seafarers and spread to the Moonshae Isles, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the Northern islands of the Sea of Swords. Eventually, the humans and orcs rose from the ruins of infighting left behind by the elven civilization. Another major factor that contributed to the decline of the Fair Folk was the event called the Dark Disaster. The Disaster manifested as a dark cloud of deathly magics that swallowed the kingdom of Miyeritar, sapping the life out of the region, turning it into the swamps of the High Moor. With the elven decline, the court of power in Evereska forged an alliance with humans, dwarves, and the surviving elven kingdoms. Together, the alliance stood against marauding orcs, barbarian humans, ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, and gnolls, led by increasing powers of the giant kin in the North. These alliances brought the golden age to grand cities of the North - Myth Drannor, Silverymoon, and the Fallen Kingdoms.\nWhile these struggles played out in the west, the eastern shores of the Narrow Sea saw a transformation of small fishing villages into towns, and eventually - into the Empire of Netheril. The book stated that sages theorized the human communities were gathered under the leadership of a single human wizard who owned a great book of magics from the Days of Thunder. That book became what was later known as the Nether Scrolls. The wizards name was lost to the time, but under his guidance, the Empire of Netheril rose to great power in the North. The books authors believed this era to be the birth of human wizardry and transition away from shamanism to the arcane. The volume closed with Netherils empire standing strong for three thousand years until the doom brought by Karsuss Folly.\nThe next volume starts with chronicling the latter part of summer 1367 DR when a horde of orcs descended from the Spine of the Word, led by King Greneire. The horde waged war on the lands south of the Spine, from the Moonwood and the Cold Wood to the Citadel of Many Arrows. To everyones surprise, King Obould of the Many Arrows was opposed to another war with the humans of the North and the demons of the Hellgate Keep. Even so, Oboulds shamans prophesied the fall of the Citadel of Many Arrows at the hands of his own orcs.\nThe volume continued describing the siege of the Citadel of Many Arrows by King Greneire and his threats against Obould in the name of Gruumsh. The siege lasted for four excruciating months until the Battle of the Citadel of Many Arrows in Uktar. The historians believed that King Greneire charged with all of his men and broke through the Citadels gates. As Oboulds stronghold burned, both orc kings battled to the death. The book collected testimonials of the battles eyewitnesses, and it chronicled the death of both rulers. His opponents blade ran through Greneire, and Obould passed from the battles wounds. With the leaders of both sides, a chaotic battle raged until the winner of the conflict emerged - the dwarves of Clan Warcrown. The dwarven warriors, aided by troops from Silverymoon, charged at the weekend orc armies, killing and scattering the survivors.\nThe final part of the third volume of the History of the North talked about King Emerus Warcrown, who claimed the Citadel of Many Arrows from the orcs renaming it to Citadel Felbarr. When the book was published, Emerus Warcrown still ruled the Citadel, reinforcing the structure and amassing the forces in case another orcish horde decided to reclaim their prize. The rumors of newly discovered veins of gold and silver also attracted dwarven population to the Citadel.\nVolume four covered the events that surrounded the departure of elves from the North to the island of Evermeet. That period of time brought pillaging of the elven cities by orcs and humans. The same timeframe also marked the end of the human empire of Netheril. The empires fall came following the disappearance of the Narrow Sea and the region being turned into dessert - the Anauroch. Historians believed that the surviving Netherese citizens scattered far and wide and brought the ancient secrets of the arcane with them. However, many gases believed that the scarleting was not as immediate, and many said it was. Instead, the migration was slow and lasted through fifteen hundred years of the Netherese Empires existence. Along with the empire of magic disappearing, the dwarven kingdoms of the North and the Delzoun stronghold were pushed out by another orcish horde from the Spine of the World. The Greypeak Mountains mines were lost, and dwarves abandoned Ice Mountains, Nether Mountains, and the High Moon Mountains.\nThe only survivors of the orc horde were the elves of Eaerlann, aided by the treants of Turlang. But they merely won a few more centuries before leaving as well. Before falling, Eaerlann built the stronghold of Ascalhorn that was given to the survivors of the fall of Netheril, who later built the town of Karse of the High Forest. The same Netherese survivors settled Llorkh and Loudwater, Silverymoon, Everlund, Sundabar, and birthed the Uthgardt folk of the north.\nThis volume primarily talks about the humans of the North. Humanity flourished in the North due to their adaptability and the magics they inherited from the Proud Peoples. Humans managed to stave away their enemies, including the giants and orcs. With humanity on the rise, elves were in decline, with the pureblooded Fair Folk dying out and breeding with humans, creating many half-elves in the North. Humans were also responsible for funding the city of Waterdeep that was to grow to be the City of Splendor.\nAnother group of humans inhabited the northwest - the Ice Hunters. The book called them to be wise, clever, but primitive humanoids. That branch of humanity dwelled there since before the Dale Reckoning, predating the foundation of the Netherese Empire. These Ice Hunters were displaced by the invasion of tall, light-haired, warring humans who came there via longships. These humans became known as the Northmen and quickly spread along the Winding Waters and Mirar. The Northmen humans drove Ice Hunter into the deep North, pushed goblins and their ilk deeper into the mountains, and within five hundred years of their arrival, Illefarn was gone, as well as elves of the land migrated to Evermeet. From there, the book recounted the Northmen settling Ruathym and Gundarlun, as well as Icewind Dale.\nThe last part of the volume talked about Ascalhorn becoming the fiend-infested Hellgate Keep and the fall of Eaerlann at the hands of yet another orc horde. And finally, the book mentioned the rise and fall of the Fallen Kingdom and the long-term damage the realm dealt to the goblin kin of the North.\nThe sixth volume talked about the rise to power of humans after the fall of Illefarn. The book talked about the merchants from the south, northerner warriors, and sailors from the west establishing the small trading post and the village of Nimoars Hold (later known as Waterdeep). The book mentioned the name Nimoar of the Uthgardt tribes who fortified the village. Nimoar and his successors took the names of the War Lords and became the leaders of Waterdeep. The volume then covered the grand battle between Waterdeep and an invading gang of trolls, won thanks to Ahghairon of Silverymoon and his magics. The inheritor of Netherese magic was said to inhabit Waterdeep until he turned 112 years old and created the Lords of Waterdeep. Eventually, Waterdeep grew to become a megapolis - the greatest in the North. During that time, the ruins of Illusk were taken back from orcs and steeled by humans - becoming the city of Luskan. The book also mentioned settling of Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Secomber, and Longsaddle by waterdhavians and with the financial aid of wealthy merchant houses of Waterdeep.\nThe book continued talking about more recent events at the time of printing. The North hasnt been menaced by orc hordes in centuries by the mid 14 century DR, yet the region was not safe. Northern barbarian tribes remained a danger and Northmen pirates in the waters of the Sea of Swords. The city of Luskan was a mercantile competitor of Waterdeep and waged wars - notably against Ruathym. That misbegotten lasted for a year until stopped by the Lords Alliance threatening was against Luskan. Following the war, the volume continued talking about political tension between Luskan, Ruathym, and Waterdeep. The book cited suspicion of Luskans presence on the island of Ruathym and continuing to wage a guerrilla war of terrorism.\nThe last part of the book talked about the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale and them being rebuilt following the war waged by Akar Kessell and his goblinoid and giant allies. With the help of the Reghedmen barbarians, the Ten Towns recovered. The book concludes with the statement from traveling merchants who visited Icewind Dale, stating that the locals and barbarians were living together in unity - an amazing display for the time.\nThe last published volume of the book covered the most recent developments in the North as of 1368 DR, the Year of the Banner. A quick mention of dwarves preparing for winter in the reclaimed city of Felbarr was followed by the record of Zhentarim-allied adventurers killing Elrem the Wise - the leader of the Great Worm tribe, after infiltrating the Great Worm Cavern. The adventurers were evacuated via magic from the caverns. They were gone, along with the treasures of the tribe, before the barbarians were able to slay the criminals. The volume stated that Elrem promised to protect his tribe in spirit form after death, but the Great Worm tribe suffered a tough winter, low food, and poor morale.\nThe book recounted the first-hand reports of visitors to the tribe after the death of Elrem. They claimed that Themrin Talistars and Gweshen \"Ironhand\" Talistars - the new leaders, were adorned in enchanted armor crafted out of Elrems scales. Reportedly, the body of the tribes shaman being used for \"protection\" arrived to the new leaders in their dreams. It was believed that the enchanted armor appeared as simple leathers but was as tough as the best plate mail suit.\nThe next account came from the town of Nesmé. The book recorded increasing troll attacks from the Evermoors and cited several sources claiming the trolls were being driven out by something or someone. The book settled on not knowing the true reason for the toll attacks until a group of adventurers was going to be found to deal with the issue.\nFinally, the last part was dedicated to the Blue Bear tribe. The tribes shaman Tanta Hagara was reported marching her tribe against the Hellgate Keep. The book claimed that according to multiple sources, Tanta Hagara snatched control of the fortress.\nBy 1368 DR, copies of all seven volumes of the History of the North could be commonly found throughout the Sword Coast, the city of Baldurs Gate, the fortress library of Candlekeep,"
