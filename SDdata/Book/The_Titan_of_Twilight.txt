'''''The Titan of Twilight''''' by [[Troy Denning]] is book three in [[The Twilight Giants]] trilogy.

{{Quote | For untold centuries, a banished titan has lurked in the cold, forbidden dusk of the [[Twilight Vale]] &mdash; imprisoned for a crime as black as the boreal night.

With the birth of a new king comes his freedom.

The kingdom hangs in the balance as the queen's consort is forced to choose between his love for his son and the dark prophecy that says his child will unleash a cataclysmic war. But before he can choose, a thief steals both the boy and the choice away from him.[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/frnovel/969917400 Wizard.com Listing]}}

==Synopsis==
When pregnant Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] of [[Hartsvale]] is in the [[Gorge of the Silver Wyrm]] to grant a blessing to one of Earl [[Radborne Wynn]]'s new silver mines, she finds her entourage under attack from a band of [[fire giant]]s. Her high scout and husband [[Tavis Burdun]] and the [[Company of the Royal Snow Bear]] risk their lives defending her.

[[Firbolg]]s from [[Meadowhome]] arrive, led by [[Raeyadfourne]] and the seer [[Galgadayle]]. They battle with the fire giants but attempt to kidnap Brianna, believing Galgadayle's prophecy that her child would break destruction to both [[human]]s and [[giant-kin]]. [[Avner]] stabs Galgadayle in the back, causing him to drop Brianna, but in his thrashing, he accidentally tramples Earl Radborne to death. Avner and six of her surviving riders carry Brianna uphill to the relative safety of a mine called the [[Silver Duchess]].

Within the opening of that mine, Brianna struggles to give birth, and Avner is forced to cut the child from her womb with a knife before the firbolgs are able to locate them again.

Tavis wakes up to find himself, badly injured, at the bottom of the gorge after a fire giant had kicked him.
