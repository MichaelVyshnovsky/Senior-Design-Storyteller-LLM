        "mainbody": "Circes Cookbook was a copy of Circe the Black Sorceresss personal reflections on potion making. Though it contained no formulas, it was still worth a hefty sum of two hundred gold pieces.Due to the lack of information provided on Circes Cookbook, one could take the approach that the \"Circe\" who authored it was either an unknown sorceress in the Realms or the Circe of Greek myth. This wiki leans towards the latter, since Circe is detailed in Deities & Demigods as having the title \"black sorceress\" and because the adventure features a book on the Greek deity Hephaestus. That being said though, its important to keep in mind that this is still a speculation and that both views are valid.\nThe book had a solid black cover.\nThis tome laid within Bard Keep, a temple of Oghma that stood within the North near Silverymoon."
