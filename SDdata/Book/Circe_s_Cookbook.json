        "mainbody": "'''''Circe's Cookbook''''' was a copy of [[Circe|Circe the Black Sorceress's]] personal reflections on [[potion]] making. Though it contained no formulas, it was still worth a hefty sum of two hundred [[gold piece]]s.Due to the lack of information provided on ''Circe's Cookbook'', one could take the approach that the \"Circe\" who authored it was either an unknown sorceress in the Realms or the Circe of Greek myth. This wiki leans towards the latter, since Circe is detailed in [[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities & Demigods'']] as having the title \"black sorceress\" and because the adventure features a book on the Greek deity [[Hephaestus (deity)|Hephaestus]]. That being said though, it's important to keep in mind that this is still a speculation and that both views are valid.",
        "Description": "The [[book]] had a solid black cover.",
        "History": "This tome laid within [[Bard Keep]], a temple of [[Oghma]] that stood within [[the North]] near [[Silverymoon]]."
