'''''Starless Night''''' is the second book in the [[Legacy of the Drow]] series by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. It was later reissued as book eight of the [[Legend of Drizzt]] series.

{{quote|''The [[Underdark]]. A place of brooding darkness, where no shadows exist, and where [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] does not wish to go. The noble [[drow|dark elf]] must return there, though, must go back to find his friends in the [[Svirfneblin|gnome]] city of [[Blingdenstone]], and on to [[Menzoberranzan]], the city of drow. Only then can Drizzt discern what perils might reach out from that dark place to threaten his friends in [[Mithril Hall]].''}}
==Summary==
<!--The title, Starless Night, refers to the unlit nights in Menzoberranzan, where Drizzt travels to Menzoberranzan to keep the drow armies from going after his friends and invading Mithral Hall. He gives the statuette of Guenhwyvar to [[Regis]] and tells him not to tell anyone where he went. When Cattie-brie later has suspicions and questioned Regis, she was skeptical and decided to follow Drizzt. When [[Bruenor]] finds out from Regis, he goes into deeper grieving, already saddened by the loss of Wulfgar.

Drizzt goes first to Blingdenstone and stays for a short while after being unwillingly involved in a raid and captured. There, he meets up with Belwar Dissengulp, and old friend, before leaving. Then in Menzoberranzan, Drizzt is able to disguise himself for a little while as a guard to gain entry into the central districts, but is later found out. He is captured and taken to Matron Baenre's dungeon and introduced to six Baenre nobles, before being brutally tortured by Vendes Baenre, the chief torturer who earned the title Duk'Tak (Literally, Unholy Executioner). Meanwhile, Cattie-brie uses the magical mask to disguise herself as a drow priestess. She teams up with Artemis Entreri, who has gone to Menzoberranzan in the protection of [[Jarlaxle]], and frees Drizzt. Drizzt kills Vendes out of sheer hatred, then later fights Dantrag Baenre, who was considered the second-best to Zaknafein, so he wanted to kill Drizzt because he was Zaknafein's son and protege, to come out of Zak's shadow. Drizzt defeated him and obtained the speed-enhancing bracers that he wore, while Cattie-brie took the sword Khazid'hea "Cutter" from Dantrag and narrowly escaping the Baenre complex. Artemis Entreri escapes as well, and goes his own way, while Cattie-brie and Drizzt return to Mithral Hall to meet Bruenor with apologies.-->

In the first part of the book, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] leaves [[Mithral Hall]] directed to [[Menzoberranzan]]. He is afraid that the [[drow]] still represent a threat to his friends and he is ready to do anything to stop them. He meets [[Ellifain Tuuserail|Ellifain]], an elf he saved from a drow raid when he was still living among his kin, and then he reaches [[Mooshie's Grove]], which he finds now inhabited by a [[unicorn]]. Meanwhile, [[Catti-brie]] sets up in pursuit as soon as she learns of the drow's departure, starting to realize that she has been harboring feelings for him. She reaches [[Silverymoon]] where Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand|Alustriel]] helps her with directions and equipment. In the meantime Matron Mother [[Yvonnel Baenre]] is carrying out preparations for her long planned conquest of Mithral Hall.

In the second part of the book Drizzt sneaks and fights his way through the tunnels of the [[Underdark]]. He comes close to the [[svirfneblin]] city of [[Blingdenstone]] where he helps some of the deep gnomes against a drow party, but he is knocked unconscious. Also Catti-brie, together with [[Guenhwyvar]], reaches the Underdark, and after a nearly fatal encounter with a group of [[goblin|goblins]], she uses [[Agatha's_mask|Agatha's Mask]] to take drow aspect. In the meanwhile, in Mithral Hall, [[Regis]] tries to set the dwarven army ready in case of a drow attack, while [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] still cannot get rid of his apathy and depression for the loss of his friends. We also learn that [[Artemis Entreri]] has been saved by the drow and is now in Menzoberranzan, and that, while [[House Baenre]] is gathering allies and getting ready to launch the attack to Mithral Hall, the greatest weapon masters of the drow city are eager to face in combat the famous Drizzt.

In the third part of the book Drizzt recovers in Blingdenstone and meets his old friend [[Belwar Dissengulp]], while the drow mercenary [[Jarlaxle]] finds out about his presence. Drizzt proceeds to Menzoberranzan, but soon Jarlaxle's men find him and battle ensues. In the meanwhile Catti-brie reaches Blingdenstone, and the svirfnebli, recognizing Guenhwyvar, let her proceed to Menzoberranzan as well. She manages to pass some guards thanks to her enchanted mask and, hearing the battle noises from the fight in which Drizzt is involved, she runs to her friend's aid.

In the fourth part of the book, Drizzt and Catti-brie are defeated by Jarlaxle's men, helped by Artemis Entreri. Drizzt is captured by House Baenre, but the woman is kept by Jarlaxle. Drizzt is brutally tortured and Matron Baenre tries to have his mind read for information about Mithral Hall. Jarlaxle, following his own agenda, subtly leads Entreri to a plan to rescue Drizzt with the aid of Catti-brie. The two humans first sneak into the quarters of [[Gromph Baenre]] to steal the [[spider mask]], the only tool that make the access to House Baenre compound possible. The two proceed to fight their way into the compound and manage to reach Drizzt, when they are met by House Baenre's forces.

In the fifth and last part of the book, Drizzt, Catti-brie, Guenhwyvar and Entreri desperately fight their way out of Baenre's compound. Eventually they find a tunnel that leads out of the drow city, they slow down their pursuers with an explosion that causes a huge stalactite to crash down on part of the compound, and Drizzt defeats House Baenre's weapon master [[Dantrag Baenre]]. The companions can then proceed toward the surface after a last meeting with Jarlaxle, who apparently masterminded everything that happened to Drizzt, Catti-brie and Entreri in Menzoberranzan.

The book ends with the companions reaching the surface, Entreri departing by himself and Drizzt and Catti-brie entering Mithral Hall, where the dwarven army is ready for battle. They are reunited with Regis, now an army commander, and Bruenor.
