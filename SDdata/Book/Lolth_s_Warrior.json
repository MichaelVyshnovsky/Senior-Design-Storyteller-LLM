It was published in 2023.{{Cite web/Lolth's Warrior}} \n\n{{Quote|\n'''The epic conclusion to ''New York Times'' bestselling author R. A. Salvatore's electrifying trilogy, The Way of the Drow, finds Drizzt Do'Urden coming to understand his role as a friend, a father, and a man caught between the darkness and the light.\n\nThe drow city of [[Menzoberranzan]] has fallen into discontent, sowed by the growing legend of the one who escaped: Drizzt Do'Urden. Now many of the drow—including the city's most powerful house, led by the Matron Mother—are questioning the influence of the [[Lolth|Spider Queen]] and the very history of the city's founding.\n\nWhat secrets lie ahead? The drow are determined to find out, and they’ll stop at nothing to dismantle the very structure they've called home.\n\nAs social tensions rise and the demands for answers boom, a fight erupts between the adherents of Lolth's chaotic evil and those drow who demand more, demand better. In the [[Underdark]] there are only absolutes and no compromise will be found. With winner taking all, Drizzt Do'Urden cannot and will not remain on the sidelines anymore. This will be an uprising Menzoberranzan will never forget, and the rest of the Forgotten Realms won’t be able to look away.|Publisher's description}}"
