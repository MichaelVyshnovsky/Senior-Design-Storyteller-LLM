The '''''Lay of the Purple Dragons''''' was a ballad about King [[Azoun IV]]'s crusade against the [[Tuigan Horde]] in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]].

==Description==
The ''Lay'' embellished the historical account for added heroism, adding extra [[dragon]]s, [[knight]]s, and [[magic]]. At one point, even the [[god]]s appear before King Azoun to bless his crusade.

==History==
The [[bard]] [[Talamic]] sang the ''Lay of the Purple Dragons'' at the [[Griffin's Claw]] in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}. A young scribe at the [[Temple of Deneir (Procampur)|Temple of Deneir]] in Procampur preferred it to the more accurate ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]'' he was working on, prompting its author, [[Koja]], to attempt to have his own work mass-published to counter the ''Lay'' and other populist versions of the war.
