Expedition to Undermountain is designed for 1- to 10-level characters and is the 3-edition supplement for Undermountain.
The book is split into an Introduction, briefly describing Halasters death and a synopsis of the adventure, the first chapter, which briefly describes Undermountain, with maps of most levels and sublevels, chapters 2-5, which are the campaign adventure, and an appendix of new creatures, such as the Eyeball Swarm, and new items, such as the Crown Adamant.
Expedition to Undermountain presents an adventure campaign designed to cover a number of levels of play. Undermountain, as it is presented here, is a huge adventuring area for any D&D campaign, containing nine main levels and more than twenty sublevels, connecting to more extensive dungeons and caverns, and ultimately to the Underdark. The book treats Undermountain as an unexplored underground region, and provides plots, power groups, and lore to enable a Dungeon Master to detail any corner of Undermountain to create a long-term adventure setting. Encounters are presented in the book, which are designed to take a party of player characters from 1st level to 10th level. With an appendix it also describes a set of new creatures, such as the Eyeball Swarm, and new items, such as the Crown Adamant.
