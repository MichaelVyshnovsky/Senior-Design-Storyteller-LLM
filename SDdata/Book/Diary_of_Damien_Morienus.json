        "Description": "It was a black leather-clad old book with an embroidered \"M\" on its cover, which stood for the name of the diary's owner. The diary was old but readable, after spending a century in the dark and damp underground. The book was about {{SI|11|in|c|long=yes}} by {{SI|7|in|c|long=yes}}, and {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}} in thickness.",
        "Contents": "''The Diary of Damien Morienus'' was written in an ''arcane script'' that could be deciphered by a magic-user or read using a ''[[read magic]]'' spell.\n\nThe diary itself contained copious notes and theories on the nature of life and death, the necromancer's research into the power of lichdom, formulas, spells, and recipes. Most importantly, the diary contained an incomplete recipe for a magic [[potion]] that would, if the research was finished, turn the drinker into a [[lich]].",
        "History": "''The Diary of Damien Morienus'' was the bounty sought after by evil wizards of the Host Tower of the Arcane [[Celerum|Celerum the Black]] and [[Kaladar the Cruel]] in [[1369 DR]].\n\nThe Diary was still in Damien's possession ''circa'' [[1269 DR]] when the [[Accursed Tower]] of the necromancer was swallowed by the mud of the [[Great Thaw]]. The inhabitants of the tower perished and were raised as [[undead]] because of the curse of one of [[Myrkul]]'s clerics. Damien himself was transformed into a [[crypt thing]] who was clutching the diary when a group of adventurers discovered the tower in search of the diary."
