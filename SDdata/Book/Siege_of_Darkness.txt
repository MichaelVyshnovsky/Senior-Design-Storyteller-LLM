{{quote|''"Let the damned [[drow]] come!"''

''All about me I saw excitement, in the [[Battlehammer (clan)|dwarves]], in [[Catti-brie]], even in [[Regis]], the [[halfling]] known more for preparing lunch and nap than for war. I felt it, too. That tingling anticipation, that camaraderie that had me and all the others patting each other on the back, offering praises for the simplest of additions to the [[Mithral Hall|common defense]], and raising our voices together in cheer whenever good news was announced. What was it? It was more than shared fear, more than giving thanks for what we had while realizing that it might soon be stolen away. I didn't understand it then, in that time of frenzy, in that euphoria of frantic preparations. Now, looking back, it is an easy thing to recognize.''

''It was hope.''}}
== Summary ==
In the first part of the book, the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Clan Battlehammer]] in [[Mithral Hall]] are preparing to face a [[drow]] attack from [[Menzoberranzan]]. [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and Catti-brie are tasked with securing the alliance of the barbarians of [[Settlestone]]. Catti-brie has to beat their leader [[Berkthgar|Berkthgar the Bold]] in a duel in order to convince him. In the meantime in [[Menzoberranzan]] the very air seems to whisper of something big to happen. [[House Baenre]] is afraid of a conspiracy against them by the other houses; they fear that they may have lost the favor of [[Lolth]]. The [[svirfneblin]] of [[Blingdenstone]] also feel something in the air. We learn that the [[Spider Queen]] fears she might be unable to keep an eye on Menzoberranzan for a time and she asks the [[demon]] [[Errtu]] to take her place.

In the second part of the book, the effects of the [[Time of Troubles]] present themselves, with magic going awry. [[Harkle Harpell]] fails to teleport himself in Mithral Hall; [[Guenhwyvar]] becomes stuck while traveling between the [[plane]]s but is saved by Catti-brie, who destroys the panther's statuette. The human woman is later possessed by the sentient sword [[Khazid'hea]] and does not become herself again until Drizzt takes the sword from her. The magical prison holding [[Gandalug Battlehammer]] for thousands of years fails. In Menzoberranzan, drow society, based on magic, is in chaos. [[House Oblodra]], a house of [[psionicist]]s, is the only house able to retain their powers and so plans a coup. However, the [[avatar]] of Lolth appears and suggests an alliance of the greater houses against the Oblodrans, giving them the means to summon Errtu's demonic minions to their aid.

In the third part of the book, the Time of Troubles ends and magic is restored. The [[Harpell]]s reach Mithral Hall, Catti-brie dominates the will of her sentient sword, and Guenhwyvar's statuette is repaired. Drizzt and Catti-brie speak about their feelings for each other and decide to be merely friends for the time being. In Menzoberranzan, House Baenre moves against House Oblodra, which is besieged by Errtu's demons. [[Yvonnel Baenre|Matron Baenre]], with the powers given to her by Lolth, gives a great display of strength and sends Matron [[K'yorl Odran]] to the [[Abyss]]. That settled, Baenre resumes her planning to attack Mithral Hall.

In the fourth part of the book, the drow army marches to Mithral Hall. The svirfneblin of Blingdenstone evacuate their city when the drow pass by and decide to secretly follow the drow in order to aid the dwarves. When the battle begins, the forces of Mithral Hall quickly dispose of the drow slaves (mostly [[kobolds]] and [[goblins]]), but then the true enemy, the drow, enter the fray. On the surface, Mithral Hall's allies from Settlestone, [[Silverymoon]], [[Longsaddle]], and [[Nesme]] are in danger of being outmaneuvered and outnumbered by the drow.

In the fifth part of the book, the most significant part of the battle for Mithral Hall is fought. The drow, in greater number, drive back the dwarves and their allies both from the lower tunnels and on the surface. The defences hold due to the intervention of Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand|Alustriel]] and the svirfneblin from Blingdenstone, and soon the disloyal drow start deserting. The weapon master [[Uthegental Armgo]] is killed by [[Bidderdoo Harpell]], and dawn catches the drow on the surface by surprise. Eventually Drizzt and his companions, hunting for the leaders of the drow, meet Matron Baenre and her party in the deep tunnels. In the ensuing fight, thanks to the indirect intervention of Errtu, Bruenor manages to kill the Matron Mother, avenging the death of [[Wulfgar]].

The book ends with celebrations in Mithral Hall, with alliances made stronger. We also witness a happy Lolth handing in an unknown prisoner to Errtu for the demon's service: a prisoner who would be the key to Drizzt, the only one who can break Errtu's banishment.
