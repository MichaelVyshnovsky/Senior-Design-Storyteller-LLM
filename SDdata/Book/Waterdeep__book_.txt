'''''[[Waterdeep]]''''' was an aptly named history book of the City of Splendors, written and published before the [[Wailing Death]] crisis of [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
The book opened with the City of Splendors' general geographical information and listed its population to be almost one and a half million citizens with the number carrying depending on the season. The book listed its rich trade businesses and the number of races living inside the city walls. The book noted that [[halfling]] population was the most rapidly growing and was likely to become the largest demi-human race in residence.

The second part of the book recited Waterdeep's history starting with the city's origins - that of a trading site over two millennia's before the book's writing. A thousand years before the book's publishing, the trading post became growing farming communities around it. The first time the city was mentioned by its name in history was around four hundred years before the book's release, and the city was nothing but a group of local warlords.

The third chapter cited the city's establishment to happen by [[1302 DR]] and its first Lord to be [[Ahghairon]]. By [[1248 DR]] Waterdeep was said to develop guilds and the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]]. Following that, the book recited the period of the unrest known as the [[Guildwars]]. By [[1273 DR]] the city rulership system was established as it was known in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], creating the positions of the Magisters and the sector Lords of Waterdeep.

The final chapter of the book described the more recent period of time that showed significant growth in the city's trade and nobility with merchants establishing guilds and rising in status. The city established the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] to be its light-handed law enforcement. These factors made Waterdeep cosmopolitan and much more tolerant of cultures, races, and religion in contrast with other places in the Realms. The city's diversity was credited for its growth and prosperity, truly earning its nickname - the City of Splendors.

==History==
Copies of ''Waterdeep'' book could be found around the areas of [[Neverwinter]], [[Daggerford]], and the [[Sword Coast North]]  ''circa'' 1372 DR.
