        "mainbody": "The Demonomicon, also known as the Fiendomicon,\nAll volumes of the Demonomicon were brassbound pages of parchment with dark purple covers made of demon leather. It was held shut by a clasp in the shape of a three-fingered demonic hand.\nAmong some historical information on demon lords, the book detailed the ascension of Orcus to demon lord status, specifying that he spent some time as a nalfeshnee inhabiting the 400 layer of the Abyss at the same time that the gith race revolted against the mind flayers. The book also contained treatises on Fraz-Urbluu, Juiblex, Pazuzu, and Zuggtmoy.\nThe book contained not only information about the demon lords, but also abundant demonic lore in general. It specified what kinds of demons certain evil individuals became after death. Each volume of the Demonomicon contained the true names of multiple different demons.\nThe Demonomicon also contained information on the Abyss itself. It stated that the plane could regenerate a previously destroyed demon lord.\nInformation on other creatures was also available in the Demonomicon. When discussing the obyrith Pale Night, the book argued that she also spawned other races that inhabited the Prime Material plane, such as lamias and harpies.\nEvery volume of the Demonomicon contained information on the same spells, all created by Iggwilv dolor, ensnarement, exaction, imbrue, implore, minimus containment, and torment.\nPossession of the complete Demonomicon was believed to grant the reader with power to dominate all the demon lords described in its pages, paralleling the power Iggwilv herself had over those entities. However, over the books history, no wizard succeeded in obtaining all volumes.\nAny volume of the book was capable of increasing the strength of conjuration spells such as planar binding against demons and other evil creatures. The first few pages of each volume were blank and functioned as renewable material components for soul-binding spells such as magic jar, minimus containment, and trap the soul. Whenever a creature was imprisoned within a volume of the Demonomicon, its visage appeared as a drawing on that pages parchment whose appearance changed every time the book was opened. Creatures trapped inside the book could communicate with outsiders via spells such as detect thoughts, dream, and Rarys telepathic bond.\nThe Demonomicon was based on a previous work known as the Tome of Zyx, All content from the original tomes were copied over to the Demonomicon, but it also contained abundant original research conducted by Iggwilv over the years.\nAlthough it was generally believed that the Demonomicon only had six volumes,"
