A desperate rescue attempt succeeds, with Drizzt and [[Innovindil]] rescuing the latter's [[pegasus]], which Obould had captured and chained as a trophy, and Drizzt is unexpectedly reunited with the Companions that he long thought dead. Drizzt and the surface elf Innovindil bring their quest for the captured pegasus to a conclusion. A few more characters meet their demise in this novel.\n{{sectstub}}",
