Through the testimony of a thief named Kadian, ghosts of Talek Talembar and Kera, and the presence of shadow creatures in a Zhentarim hideout, Mari Almaren and Morhion Gendahar learn that Caledan Caldorien is the direct descendant of both Talek Talembar and Verraketh, and that he is becoming the Shadowking, having committed the murders against his will. \nBelhuar Thantarth orders Mari to kill Caledan and sends a hunter, K’Shar, after him when Mari refuses and is branded a renegade. By promising his body to Serafi, Morhion learns of the Shadowstar, the artifact that Verraketh discovered that originally created the shadow magic, and its potential to reverse the transformation, and that it is owned by a thief named Stiletto. \nMari and Morhion set out to track Caledan to Stiletto along with Kellen and the thieves Jewel Talondim (Ferret’s grandmother) and Cormik, who are hoping to sell Stiletto’s location to the many guilds losing money to them. They find Caledan has killed some gibberlings, and are hunted by Shadevar, find the witch Isela in the forgotten city of Talis in the Reaching Woods, and find Stiletto, who turns out to be Ferret (having survived being locked in the Crypt of the Shadowking), in Soubar, although Caledan steals the Shadowstar. \nFerret trades places with Jewel and Cormik and the adventurers set out for the High Moor, once home to Varraketh’s kingdom of Ebenfar, where Caledan will sit on the shadowking’s throne and become the shadowking. They learn that the shadevari are actually powerful entities sealed away and the Shadowstar is the key to their prison. They use the primordial magic Valesong to kill the shadowking and save Caledan. K’shar has a change of heart and sacrifices his life to open a door. Caledan uses the last of his shadow magic to banish Serafi to the Abyss, and Kellen recovers the Shadowstar\n* Caledan Caldorien\n* Ferret Talondim\n* Mari Almaren\n* Morhion Gendahar\n* Kellen Caldorien\n* Cormik\n* Jewel Talondim\n* Talek Talembar\n* Verraketh\n* Tyveris\n* Estah\n* Jolle\n* Serafi\n* K’shar\n* Belhuar Thantarth\n* Bron (mentioned)\n* Kera\n* Tam Acorn\n* Beris\n* Sarig\n* Elvar the Grainlord\n* Isela\n* Shadevar\n* Shadow dragon\n* Shadow hound\n* Shadowsteeds\n* Shadow beasts\n* Raystingers (mentioned)\n* Shadowstar\n* Sugarberry pie\n* On the Nature of Shadows\nCategoryNovels\nCategoryBooks\nCategoryWorks by Mark Anthony\nCategoryPublished in 1995\n8hub0kax5wc0krd8p4j49aehn0fgk0j"
