'''''Rise of the King''''' is the second book of the [[Companions Codex]] series by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. 
{{Quote|''In the second book of the Companions Codex, the latest series in the New York Times best-selling saga of dark elf [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], R.A. Salvatore picks up with the fan-favorite storyline of dwarf king [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] and his bloody feud with the [[orc]] kingdom of [[Many-Arrows|Many Arrows]].''}}

==Summary==
As the [[Darkening]] settles across the land, the [[drow]] minions of [[Quenthel Baenre]] incite the [[frost giant]]s of the [[Shining White]] and two [[white dragon]]s, [[Arauthator]] and [[Aurbangras]], to go to war against the [[Silver Marches]] alongside the [[orc]]s of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]]. This is all done, unbeknownst to any but the drow, for the glory of the [[Spider Queen]] in her quest to gain the [[domain]] of [[Mystra]] and get revenge against the renegade [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].

Meanwhile, Drizzt and the other [[Companions of the Hall]]—[[Catti-brie]], [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], [[Regis]], and [[Wulfgar]]—are resting in [[Port Llast]] after their escape from [[Gauntlgrym]]/[[Q'Xorlarrin]]. They run into [[Effron]] and reveal to him the apparent demise of his mother, [[Dahlia Sin'felle]], as they leave town for [[Longsaddle]] in order to redeem their friend [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] from his [[vampire|vampiric]] curse.

However, it is revealed that Dahlia is not in fact dead, but has been restored to life as the insane ''darthiir'' (non-drow) [[matron mother]] of [[House Do'Urden]], which has been reformed by Quenthel at Lolth's bidding. The nobles of the house were taken from [[House Baenre]] and [[House Xorlarrin]], with many of the foot soldiers requisitioned from [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. The new House Do'Urden is the face of the drow on the surface as they secretly incite the war against the Silver Marches.

The twin kings of [[Citadel Adbar]], [[Bromm]] and [[Harnoth]], when faced with orc forces at the door of [[Citadel Felbarr]] and [[Mithral Hall]], sally forth to bring aid to their fellow dwarves, but while traveling, Bromm is killed by [[Tiago Baenre]] riding a white dragon. The three remaining kings of the [[dwarf|dwarven]] kingdoms meet and agree to band together, forsaking the Confederation of the Silver Marches and leaving the [[human]] and [[elf|elven]] nations to their fates.

The Companions of the Hall arrive in Longsaddle and find that a fighting image of Pwent lingers on in the horn of summoning once carried by Wulfgar. The Companions continue on and learn of the Darkening and the return of House Do'Urden from the [[Uthgardt]] [[Griffon tribe]]. They travel through the [[Evermoors]], being joined by [[Athrogate]] and rescuing a wayward [[Riders of Nesmé|Rider of Nesmé]], [[Giselle Malcomb]], and escort her to [[Nesmé]], which has been under assault by orcs and [[goblin]]s. Regis, disguised as a goblin shaman, manages to help weaken the orc army but, while doing so, discovers that the scale of the attack is much larger than he and his friends had previously understood. Now Nesmé, [[Sundabar]], [[Silverymoon]], and all three dwarven kingdoms are beset with orc armies. The Companions remain in Nesmé to defend the town, delaying their return to Mithral Hall.

Meanwhile, [[Jarlaxle]] learns of the return of the Companions of the Hall and sets out to involve himself in their affairs. He travels to [[Helgabal]] and provokes the [[copper dragon]] sisters [[Tazmikella]] and [[Ilnezhara]] into returning with him to the Silver Marches. He also recruits [[Ambergris (person)|Ambergris]] and [[Afafrenfere]], who is given the blessing of Grandmaster [[Kane]] himself from the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].

As Sundabar falls to the orcs and drow, the Companions (and Athrogate) leave Nesmé for the [[Underdark]], seeking an underground road to [[Mithral Hall]]. Near to their destination, however, the party is split, with Regis and Wulfgar falling into a torture chamber run by an [[ogrillon]], and with the others managing to break through the Mithral Hall and convince the king, [[Connerad Brawnanvil]], of their true identities.
