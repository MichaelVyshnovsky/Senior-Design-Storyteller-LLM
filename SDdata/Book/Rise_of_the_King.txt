Rise of the King is the second book of the Companions Codex series by R.A. Salvatore. 
As the Darkening settles across the land, the drow minions of Quenthel Baenre incite the frost giants of the Shining White and two white dragons, Arauthator and Aurbangras, to go to war against the Silver Marches alongside the orcs of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows. This is all done, unbeknownst to any but the drow, for the glory of the Spider Queen in her quest to gain the domain of Mystra and get revenge against the renegade Drizzt DoUrden.
Meanwhile, Drizzt and the other Companions of the Hall—Catti-brie, Bruenor Battlehammer, Regis, and Wulfgar—are resting in Port Llast after their escape from Gauntlgrym/QXorlarrin. They run into Effron and reveal to him the apparent demise of his mother, Dahlia Sinfelle, as they leave town for Longsaddle in order to redeem their friend Thibbledorf Pwent from his vampiric curse.
However, it is revealed that Dahlia is not in fact dead, but has been restored to life as the insane darthiir (non-drow) matron mother of House DoUrden, which has been reformed by Quenthel at Lolths bidding. The nobles of the house were taken from House Baenre and House Xorlarrin, with many of the foot soldiers requisitioned from Bregan Daerthe. The new House DoUrden is the face of the drow on the surface as they secretly incite the war against the Silver Marches.
The twin kings of Citadel Adbar, Bromm and Harnoth, when faced with orc forces at the door of Citadel Felbarr and Mithral Hall, sally forth to bring aid to their fellow dwarves, but while traveling, Bromm is killed by Tiago Baenre riding a white dragon. The three remaining kings of the dwarven kingdoms meet and agree to band together, forsaking the Confederation of the Silver Marches and leaving the human and elven nations to their fates.
The Companions of the Hall arrive in Longsaddle and find that a fighting image of Pwent lingers on in the horn of summoning once carried by Wulfgar. The Companions continue on and learn of the Darkening and the return of House DoUrden from the Uthgardt Griffon tribe. They travel through the Evermoors, being joined by Athrogate and rescuing a wayward Rider of Nesmé, Giselle Malcomb, and escort her to Nesmé, which has been under assault by orcs and goblins. Regis, disguised as a goblin shaman, manages to help weaken the orc army but, while doing so, discovers that the scale of the attack is much larger than he and his friends had previously understood. Now Nesmé, Sundabar, Silverymoon, and all three dwarven kingdoms are beset with orc armies. The Companions remain in Nesmé to defend the town, delaying their return to Mithral Hall.
Meanwhile, Jarlaxle learns of the return of the Companions of the Hall and sets out to involve himself in their affairs. He travels to Helgabal and provokes the copper dragon sisters Tazmikella and Ilnezhara into returning with him to the Silver Marches. He also recruits Ambergris and Afafrenfere, who is given the blessing of Grandmaster Kane himself from the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
As Sundabar falls to the orcs and drow, the Companions (and Athrogate) leave Nesmé for the Underdark, seeking an underground road to Mithral Hall. Near to their destination, however, the party is split, with Regis and Wulfgar falling into a torture chamber run by an ogrillon, and with the others managing to break through the Mithral Hall and convince the king, Connerad Brawnanvil, of their true identities.
