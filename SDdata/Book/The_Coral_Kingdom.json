        "Summary": "[[Talos]] aligns with [[Malar]] and gives [[Deirdre Kendrick]] a scrying mirror, through which he and Malar can spy on the Kendricks. Coss Axell Sinioth delivers [[Tristan Kendrick|Tristan Kendrick's]] hand and a ransom demand to [[Robyn Kendrick]] at the moot to determine the new king. Robyn, [[Alicia Kendrick]], Hanrald Blackstone, [[Keane]], [[Pawldo]], and Brandon Olaffson set off to try to rescue him. Knowing that elves once could send ships below the sea, they head to [[Myrloch Vale]], which is under attack by [[Ityak-Ortheel]], the Elf-Eater, a legendary demon sent by Malar. The Elf-Eater wreaks devastation on Myrloch Vale and kills Pawldo before being banished by Keane, with the help of Deirdre. [[Brigit]] joins the group, revealing that the magic they seek is in [[Evermeet]]. They sail to Evermeet on Brandon’s new ship, the Princess of Moonshae, pursued by [[Scrag|scrags]] and [[sahuagin]] and Coss Axell Sinioth in the form of a giant squid. They successfully enter Evermeet, and are met with initial xenophobia but eventual acceptance. They meet with [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] and are gifted a Helm of Zulae that will bring their ship to the bottom of the sea. Tristan Kendrick begins to escape alongside Marqillor, a merman king, and the Princess of Moonshae rescues him. Talos gives Deirdre Coss Axell-Sinioth’s true name to punish him for his failure, then shatters the scrying mirror and pierces her with its shards, intending to use her as an avatar.",
