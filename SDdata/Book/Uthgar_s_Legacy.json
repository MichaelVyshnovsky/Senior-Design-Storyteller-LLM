        "mainbody": "'''''Uthgar's Legacy''''' was a tome that delved into the history of [[Uthgar]] the Battle Father and his mortal origins.",
        "Contents": "This book tales about the namesake and the creator of the [[Uthgardt]] barbarian tribes of the [[north Faer√ªn]]. The author talked about several historical theories of Uthgar's origins. Some believed that he was offspring of [[Beorunna]]'s, the namesake of [[Beorunna's Well]], and others claimed that he was the child of [[Tempus]] himself.\n\nOne thing was clear, however, the man who was believed to be Uthgar lived a life three times longer that a life of an ordinary [[human]]. He was a powerful and proud warrior who was elevated to divinity after dying in a one-on-onw battle against a [[frost giant]] [[Gurt]]. The legends said Uthgar conquered primeval best spirits in battle and shared their immortal gifts with his followers that became the Uthgardt barbarian at his death and apotheosis.\n\nScholars concluded what it was very likely that the fabled Uthgar was a [[Ruathym]] northman [[Uther Gardolfsson]]. His long life left historical footprints of many raids and looting of [[Illuskan]], before assembling his barbarian dynasty. The author of the book argued that Uthgar's accession indeed happen but at the barbarian king's deathbed, sponsored by a deity of war who was impressed by his fighting spirit and accomplishments.",
        "History": "Copies of ''Uthgar's Legacy'' could be found around [[Neverwinter]], and the general area of the [[Sword Coast North]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]] and the [[Moonsea]] region around [[1373 DR]]."
