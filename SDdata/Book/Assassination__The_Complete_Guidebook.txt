Assassination The Complete Guidebook was an assassination manual published several decades before 1372 DR.
As of the , a copy of Assassination The Complete Guidebook was stashed on a bookshelf in Castle Exeltiss basement. The familys scion mismanaged the once-flourishing winery, and the bookshelves in the castle basement were covered in a thick layer of dust, evidence of a dire literary neglect. Unlike all other books there, the Assassination tome was clean and well-used. The shelf also hid a secret passage from the basement to the castles second floor and the lords chambers with the secret switch hidden behind the copy of the Assassination.
