        "mainbody": "Surgery and Physiology A Sharrans Primer was a medical textbook written through the prism of the Sharran faith, sometime before the 15 century DR.\nSurgery and Physiology was a hand-written tome penned by the Sharran surgeon Malus Thorm of Reithwin. The books pages were immaculately clean and neat, written in precise penmanship. The books medical studies were speckled with dark aphorisms and philosophies of the Lady of Loss, alongside detailed diagrams and, anatomical drawings and directions. Eventually, Thorms book concluded that the true mastery of surgical art came with sacrifice. Once the master surgeon had nothing else to teach them, he should lay under the scalpels of his Sisters to lead them to surgical skill mastery."
