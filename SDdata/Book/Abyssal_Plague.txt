The '''''Abyssal Plague''''' is a multiverse-spanning series of seven novels and one novella, published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] between 2010 and 2012. The event revolves around the [[Voidharrow]], an entity from a dead universe that is unleashed across multiple worlds. Two of the novels in the ''Abyssal Plague'' series are set in the [[Forgotten Realms]].{{Cite web/Design & Development: The Abyssal Plague}}

{{quote|In a dark dimension beyond the known planes of existence, the Chained God thirsts for freedom. Infusing his will into the residue of a long-dead universe—scarlet liquid shot through with veins of silver and flecks of gold—he sends this liquid crystal between worlds to prepare his way. But his will is not the only force that drives the Voidharrow.

Imbued with the power of the Voidharrow, the dragon Vestapalk creates a horde of demonic minions to spread the Abyssal Plague across the Nentir Vale. But the threat is not contained within a single world: Faerûn and Athas must contend with their own outbreaks of tainted demons and virulent plague. Will the Voidharrow consume the multiverse? Will the Chained God break free? Or will the heroes of the age put a stop to the Abyssal Plague?<ref name= "WotC Abyssal">[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Feature.aspx?x=dnd/feature/abyssalplague Wizards of the Coast event page]}}

==Description==
[[File:The Abyssal Plague Compilation.jpg|thumb|Narrative structure of the Abyssal Plague event.]]
The Abyssal Plague event was divided into three parts:
*'''Origins:''' the beginning of the Plague, and introductions to most of the main characters
*'''Plague Strikes:''' the main trilogy of novels, set on the world of [[Nerath]]
*'''Plague Spreads:''' how the Plague affected the worlds of [[Toril]] and [[wikipedia:Dark Sun|Athas]]

==Plot==
===Origins===
The Chained God [[Tharizdun]] stirs in his prison in [[Pandemonium]]. On the world of [[Nerath]], Tharizdun makes contact with one of his disciples, who is instructed to use a fragment of an artifact known as the [[Living Gate]] to pierce Tharizdun's prison and allow the god to free himself. As Tharizdun's plan is underway, the benevolent deities Ioun and Pelor move to foil him through their own mortal champions, among which is [[Demascus]], the Sword of the Gods. The champions chase the disciple and his minions from Nerath unto [[Sigil]] and finally into Pandemonium itself, but are unable to stop the ritual in time. The entity known as the [[Voidharrow]] slips out of Tharizdun's prison, imbued with a fraction of the god's willpower. The Voidharrow manifests itself as a liquid, crystalline substance, and in the ensuing fight, parts of the Voidharrow fall into portals leading to the worlds of Athas and Toril. Demascus also falls through one of the portals.

On Nerath, the Voidharrow is captured by a wizard.{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|1057}} Through a convoluted series of events involving the green dragon Vestapalk,{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|2228}} Orcus,{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|4553}} and an agent of the Voidharrow known as Nu Alin,{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|3115}} the Voidharrow is eventually freed and possesses Vestapalk.{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|4897}}
