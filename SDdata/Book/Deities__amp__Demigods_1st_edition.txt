Printing
Deities & Demigods is a 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.
Deities & Demigods presents the game statistics and background information for the gods, heroes, and legendary monsters from different mythologies. Deities & Demigods was the first print appearance of various fictional non-human deities, such as Corellon, Moradin, Gruumsh, and others, many of which have become standard features of Dungeons & Dragons and its derivatives. These deities were the creation of James Ward. 
The original edition covered 12 pantheons of gods from myth and folklore, plus gods for various nonhumans, and four fictional groups the Arthurian heroes, Fritz Leibers Nehwon mythos, Michael Moorcocks Melnibonéan mythos, and H. P. Lovecrafts Cthulhu Mythos. These statistics are presented in a fashion similar to that of the Monster Manual, and the statistics are accompanied by illustrations, as well as a short descriptive piece that details under what circumstances the god will appear, what the god might do if he does appear, and what his responsibilities and penchants may be. The book also details the mythoi of these religions, as well as how their clerics should behave, and describes the known planes of existence and how the afterlife applies to characters.
Later printings of Deities & Demigods, beginning in 1981, removed some material present in the 1980 printings. The Cthulhu and Melnibonéan sections were removed from the 1981 edition, making it a 128-page hardcover. In that form, it is functionally identical to Legends & Lore
