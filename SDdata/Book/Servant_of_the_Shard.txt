'''''Servant of the Shard''''' is the first book of [[The Sellswords]] trilogy by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. It was originally book three in the [[Paths of Darkness]] series, but as it did not focus on its central character, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], or his companions, Salvatore decided to make a separate trilogy based on the events in ''Servant of the Shard'', which ended in ''[[Road of the Patriarch]]''.

{{quote|''The Assassin.''

''Surrounded by [[drow|dark elves]], [[Artemis Entreri]] tightens his grip on the streets of [[Calimport]]. While he urges caution, his black-skinned sponsor grows ever more ambitious. The assassin will soon find himself on a path his most hated enemy has walked before himâ€”a path that leads to a place where someone like Entreri would never be welcome.''

''The Drow''

''[[Jarlaxle]] has ascended from dark [[Menzoberranzan]] with only evil intentions. The malevolent [[Crenshinibon|Crystal Shard]]'s influence on him intensifies until even the [[drow]] [[Bregan D'aerthe|agents]] he brought with him grow fearful. When [[Bregan D'aerthe]] itself begins to turn on him, Jarlaxle will be forced to find a savior in the man he's come to enslave.''}}

==Summary==
Artemis Entreri and the rest of the the Basadoni Guild continue their "war" against all neighboring guilds of  Calimport, killing many people. This time, however, there is a difference, which is that the Basadonis have a legion of drow ([[Bregan D'aerthe]]) on their side. Artemis Entreri sees the opportunity to gain a sword, [[Charon's Claw (sword)|Charon's Claw]], and goes for it. Meanwhile, despite his great willpower, Jarlaxle is being seduced by the power of Crenshinibon, or the Crystal Shard. Artemis Entreri feels that it is necessary to help him get rid of the artifact. The two come across a great opportunity to destroy the Crenshinibon in the form of the man named [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], a [[Chosen]] of [[Deneir]]. They must take the artifact to the cave of a great [[wyrm]], [[Hephaestus]], in order for to be destroyed. [[Danica Maupoissant|Danica]] also comes along for the destruction of the Shard. [[Rai-guy]], however, a [[cleric]], traitor to Jarlaxle Baenre, tries to stop them. When the Crenshinibon is encased in a globe of darkness, the wyrm, threatened, breathes upon it and that being the way to destroy it, makes the Shard explode, which kills the main antagonist Rai-guy in a flash of blinding light that burns him to a crisp.
