Besmer Altuth, a brigand from Scornubel, is at that time fleeing justice after slaying a merchant for a wand of fireballs useable by anyone he encounters Evaereol Rathrane, who devours all the energy from his wand, and gets killed by the warriors who are still after him. The caravan reaches Triel.\nAt Triel, Orthil Voldovan stops at Duskview House, where he hires new guards, and also gets slain, then impersonated, by a Red Wizard, Thavaun.

Someone backstabs Narm, and her spellfire goes haywire she attempts to heal Narm, and completely loses control, unable to verify its working.

She is then confronted by Laeral and Alustriel, but is only stopped when she decides to self-immolate and be at peace. Narm is broken by Shandrils passing, but is later visited by an apparition of her that claims she now serves Mystra being everywhere spellfire is used, bidding him find himself another wife and start a family, for hes still young.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •"
