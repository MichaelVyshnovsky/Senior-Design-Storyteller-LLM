        "mainbody": "The '''''Book of the World''''' was an enigmatic tome that discussed creation myth related to [[dragon]]s and [[dragonkind]]. \n\n{{Quote|And so Asgorath bent her form around the Crystal Sun, and touched her breath to it. And the Crystal Sun burst into fragments that pierced the flesh of Asgorath, and her blood fell on the World.|''Excerpt from the Book of the World.''}}",
        "Description": "The book consisted of some 300 sheets of a thin, flexible metal upon which a simplified runic script in an extremely ancient form of [[Thorass language|Thorass]] had been scribed. Only a single copy of the book was ever found, but it was evidently once the center of a body of religious beliefs. \n\nIt contained a massive amount of mythological content, apparently having sprung from a sophisticated culture of a kind never known to have formed in Asram.\n\nThe ''Book of the World'' was notable for providing an origin myth for [[dragon]]kind, apparently a mythologized recount of the [[Tearfall]] in the [[Days of Thunder]]. Godlike beings mentioned in the myth include [[Asgorath]], [[Zotha]], and a dragon called the Renegade, credited for the creation of [[metallic dragon]]s. The Thorass word for renegade is ''bahmat'', very similar to the modern name [[Bahamut]].\n\nBecause there were no humanoid mythological figures in the myths, it's been speculated that the myths originated among dragons, probably [[red dragon]]s because it credits red dragons as the original draconic species, and subsequently spread to whatever humanoid culture created the book.",
        "History": "It was discovered in [[Asram]] in approximately [[1254 DR]]; from the oxidation of the pages, the copy discovered book was probably created some 400 years before that. \n\nThe book itself was written about to some extent in ''[[The Origin Myths – A Treatise]]'', by the author [[Dunkelzahn]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some scholars speculated that the book did not originate from [[Toril]] itself, though these theories were disregarded by many."
