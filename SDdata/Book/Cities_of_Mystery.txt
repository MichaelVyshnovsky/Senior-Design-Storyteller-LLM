Cities of Mystery is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
is the 8 book in the FR series
This supplement is a system for designing fantasy role-playing game urban adventure settings, with 25mm-scale, three-dimensional, full-color, glue-together buildings and full-color, fold-out street and building layouts included in the box. The urban setting scenarios employ the 3-D buildings and street layouts. The buildings include details such as chimneys, dormers, overhanging eaves, and little roof-ridgeline stands for character miniatures that must perch on peaked roofs.
Cities of Mystery describes a fantasy city, and includes five adventure scenario suggestions and descriptions of important non-player characters. The boxed set includes two large maps and 33 cardstock fold-together buildings, enough for an entire city block.
It contains four accordion sections, with each section containing the punch-out sheets needed to assemble 7–9 buildings the buildings are printed in color on heavy construction paper. The house pieces needed for construction are pre-cut, and the buildings depicted on the sheets represent a variety of types present during the Middle Ages. The kit also contains two large mats with different floor and street plans. Each layout mat has three different floor plans which represent well developed urban areas with buildings and stone avenues, courtyards with wells and fountains, and palace grounds with more open area than buildings. Also included is a 64-page booklet of urban background and adventures.
