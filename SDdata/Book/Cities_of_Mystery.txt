'''''Cities of Mystery''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|''Dungeon delving can be delightful. Wandering in the wilderness can be a wonderful way to pass the time. But for the ultimate in opportunity, intrigue, and unexpected danger, try visiting the nearest village, town, or city.''

''A city is much more than a rest stop, a watering hole, or a place to buy equipment. Any opportunity, from the smallest hamlet to the most crowded medieval metropolis, offers adventuring possibilities that cannot be found in any other environment. ''Cities of Mystery'' describes for the Dungeon Master how to create realistic, exciting, and vibrant communities - and gives him the tools to make his creations come alive.''

''Inside this folder are 12 different street layout patterns that can be combined in a multitude of ways, plus 33 buildings of various shapes and sizes that can be cut out and assembled. The components, scaled for use with 25mm miniature figures, allow you to create three-dimensional city scenes for characters to explore. Also included is a 64-page book that takes you step by step through the process of defining and designing the villages, towns, and cities of your campaign world. The book contains five adventure scenarios that make use of the street layouts and fold-up buildings - ideas designed to get you started on the way to making your cites come alive.''}}
==Description==
is the 8{{th}} book in the [[FR series]]
This supplement is a system for designing fantasy role-playing game urban adventure settings, with 25mm-scale, three-dimensional, full-color, glue-together buildings and full-color, fold-out street and building layouts included in the box. The urban setting scenarios employ the 3-D buildings and street layouts. The buildings include details such as chimneys, dormers, overhanging eaves, and little roof-ridgeline stands for character miniatures that must perch on peaked roofs.{{Cite dragon/156/Role-playing Reviews|85–86}}
==Contents==
''Cities of Mystery'' describes a fantasy city, and includes five adventure scenario suggestions and descriptions of important non-player characters. The boxed set includes two large maps and 33 cardstock fold-together buildings, enough for an entire city block.{{Cite dragon/152/Through the Looking Glass}}

It contains four accordion sections, with each section containing the punch-out sheets needed to assemble 7–9 buildings; the buildings are printed in color on heavy construction paper. The house pieces needed for construction are pre-cut, and the buildings depicted on the sheets represent a variety of types present during the Middle Ages. The kit also contains two large mats with different floor and street plans. Each layout mat has three different floor plans which represent well developed urban areas with buildings and stone avenues, courtyards with wells and fountains, and palace grounds with more open area than buildings. Also included is a 64-page booklet of urban background and adventures.
