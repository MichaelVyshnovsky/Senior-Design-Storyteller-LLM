'''''The Realm According to Bumpo''''' was a mass-printed [[chapbook]] that told of adventures of a fictional character named Gabbin Bumpo, released before [[1492 DR]].

{{quote|''...But they weren't half so strange as the bird folk. First [[aarakocra]] I met had the head of a [[parrot]], the body of a [[human]], and wings also of a parrot. I tried not to stare but it was real hard.''|Excerpt from ''The Realm According to Bumpo''}}

==Description==
Like other chapbooks in [[Faerûn]], ''The Realm According to Bumpo'' was a soft-cover [[book]].

==Contents==
The chapbook's protagonist was a simple country bumpkin Gabbin Bumpo who recorded his travels across the Realms. One passage of note talked abut Bumpo's first meeting with more exotic [[humanoid]] species of Faerûn. Aarakocra were strange to him and he found it hard not to stare at the strange parrot-headed man. Along with the bird-folk traveled a [[tabaxi]], or [[cat]]-folk, a [[genasi]], or element folk, and even a [[tortle]] – a [[turtle]] folk. Bumpo asked the strange gang what they were, but the quarry remained unanswered. The rube concluded that he must've appeared as nothing more but one of a million boring humans to them.
