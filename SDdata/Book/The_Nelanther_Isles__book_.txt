'''''The Nelanther Isles''''' was an aptly named history book dedicated to the so-called Pirate Isles off the [[Sword Coast]], written and published before the [[Wailing Death]] crisis of [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
The first part of the tome detailed the location of the Nelanther Isles, a collection of scattered islands to the west of the Sword Coast. The Nelanther included nearly a thousand small islands sprinkled in the [[Sea of Swords]] between the border of [[Amn]] and the waters of the [[Trackless Sea]]. Some bigger islands, such as [[Spindrift Town]], were lawless ports, while others served no other purpose but to crush reckless ships. These inhabited islands belonged to a wide range of various political powers of [[Faer√ªn]], and some remained independent.

The book stated that the growth of trade in the nations of Amn, [[Waterdeep]], [[Luskan]], and other cities, led the scattered islands to become popular sea trade routes, which in turn, attracted piracy. As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Nelanther Isles were home to many pirate vessels, evil worshipers of the Bitch Queen [[Umberlee]], and a violent, dangerous cutthroat culture.

==History==
Copies of ''The Nelanther Isles'' book could be found around the areas of [[Neverwinter]], and in Spindrift Town of Nelanther ''circa'' 1372 DR.
