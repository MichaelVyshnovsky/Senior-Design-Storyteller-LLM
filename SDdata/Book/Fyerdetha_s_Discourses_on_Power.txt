'''''Fyerdetha's Discourses on Power''''' was a [[book|treatise]] [[scroll]] on the topic of supernatural power and its sources, written and published sometime before the destruction of the city of [[Phlan]] in the beginning of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Fountains and pools hold great power that can only be reached by performing proper ceremonies. Most sure of these is immersion, for in this way the bather surrenders himself to the spirit of the water. That spirit or some portion of it thereafter enters into the bather, whereby he gains great powers. Woe to the weak-willed whose spirits are sure to be consumed by demons that put even the strong at great risk. Yurax holds that the Falls of lxce are greatest of all these. Morden writes that the Pool of Radiance is greater still.''|Excerpt from ''Fyerdetha's Discourses on Power''}}

==History==
A copy of ''Fyerdetha's Discourses on Power'' was left in [[Mantor's Library]] in the city of Phlan as the city fell into ruins during a [[Rage of Dragons]] of the {{YearlinkName|1306}}. The [[Heroes of Phlan]] came across the scroll in the library's philosophy section in the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, during the campaign to liberate the Old City from its master â€“ [[Tyranthraxus]]. The treatise also shed some light on the mysterious ''[[pool of radiance]]'' from which the Possessing Spirit drew strength.
