        "mainbody": "Tribunal of Myth Drannor was the voluminous collection of court records of esteemed human judge Rothilion the Honorable.\nThe Tribunal of Myth Drannor consisted of many volumes that could completely take over a small archive library. The large and heavy books were made using parchment, and bound in masterwork leather covers. Each volume had its name written in common or elven on its spine, along with the date ranges of the volume.\nOne copy of the Tribunal of Myth Drannor set of volumes was placed inside the Crypt of Rothilion, in its library room. Upon Rothilions death of old age, he was buried in a large crypt in Myth Drannors Polyandrium that matched his status. Unfortunately, some of the defensive and preserving enchantments placed on the crypt were faulty, expediting the aging of all the materials inside the tomb. \nBy 1369 DR, the copies of the Tribunal of Myth Drannor locked in the crypt were mostly destroyed by the ravages of time, their parchment disintegrating upon opening. The volumes could be restored using the make whole spell."
