        "mainbody": "'''''The Dukes of Baldur's Gate''''' was a [[book]] dedicated to the Dukes of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], written in [[1492 DR]] and reporting on the latest political situation at the time of book's release.",
        "Content": "The book coveys information on the groups that lead the Gare: the [[Parliament of Peers]], which consisted of the city's [[patriar]]s, and the [[Council of Four]], on which the most powerful Dukes sat, including the city's Grand Duke. The book stated that this traditional structure held strong through the Gate's history, apart from occasional times of crisis.\n\nThe current state of the government in Baldur's Gate at the time of the book's publishing was, indeed, in crisis that brought changes to the administration. In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the Council of Four consisted of Duke [[Belynne Stelmane]], Duke [[Dillard Portyr]], and Duke [[Thalamra Vanthampur]], led by Grand Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]]. The changes came with the death of Duke [[Vanthampur]] and the disappearance of Grand Duke Ravengard during the events that came to be known as the [[Fall of Elturel]]. The Council remained incomplete until the Grand Duke could be returned or confirmed dead. In this time of political uncertainty, a new face appeared on the scene â€“ Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. The young Lord came into the spotlight with grand promises of strong leadership and a strong hand to squash the rampant crime.\n\nWhen Ulder Ravengard inevitably emerged alive from the Fall of Elturel, Lord Gortash received his endorsement, and the title of the new Grand Duke was sure to follow.",
        "History": "Soon after the book's printing in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, its copies found its way into the hands of inhabitants of Baldur's Gate, including [[The Bibliophile]], a book shop run by [[Nansi Gretta]], and the [[Baldur's Mouth]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]."
