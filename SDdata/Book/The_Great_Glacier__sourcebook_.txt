The Great Glacier is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
The Great Glacier provides an in-depth look at the Great Glacier itself and is the 14 book in the FOR series.
It contains information on the creatures, both mundane and magical, that inhabit the glacier, as well as the cultures and societies that have adapted to life in such an extreme environment. This included races and tribes, their customs, and how they survive in the harsh glacial conditions. It also covers specialized spells, equipment, and items suited for survival and exploration in glacial conditions.
The Great Glacier provides suggestions for adventures or entire campaigns set on the Great Glacier, offering Dungeon Masters ready-made ideas or inspiration for creating their own stories. It has rules and guidelines for handling the environmental challenges of a glacial setting, such as extreme cold, navigating slippery ice, crevasse hazards, and whiteout conditions.
