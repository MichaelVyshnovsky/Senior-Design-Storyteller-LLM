The '''''Nether Scrolls''''', originally known as the '''''Golden Skins of the World Serpent''''', was the name given to one set of fifty scrolls that dealt with fundamental [[magic]] theory. It was paired with a second set that was transformed by the [[elves]] of [[Faerûn]] into the ''[[Quess Ar Teranthvar]]'', or the Golden Grove of Hidden Knowledge, the magical tree to which The People could attune. Unlike the elven tree, that was only stolen once, the ''Nether Scrolls'' that always remained in their original form had been continually lost, stolen, and even partially destroyed throughout the course of five millennia.
{{Quote|One look at the ''Nether scroll'' and I've learned what a spell ''is''. I've been collecting spells as if every one were different. That's illusion...spells are all the same. They're all a path through illusion to truth. One look, and I've seen the fundamental truth of magic.|The mage [[Druhallen]].}} 

==Description==
The ''Nether Scrolls'' were a set of small scrolls that described fundamental magical theory. The contents were written over fifty scrolls divided into five chapters, each consisting of ten scrolls. Each scroll was made of a precious metal, namely [[gold]] made flexible like [[paper]] with silvery letters floating upon the surface. Each time a page was read, new knowledge appeared, allowing the scroll to contain more information than the small size should have allowed. 

While the ''Nether Scrolls'' had no direct magical powers, they provided a vast body of supply of arcane knowledge. When a reader gained sufficient understanding, re-reading the scrolls provided additional knowledge and information. There did not seem to be any limit to the amount of information one scroll could contain, although the amount of knowledge contained wasn't endless, it would still require an entire month to read through.

No destructive magics, even disintegration could affect the scrolls. They could be physically altered to the point of being unrecognizable, but would always reform themselves eventually.

==Influence==
{{Quote
|It's hard to give this up. This is a Nether Scroll, after all. It was made when we humans were ignorant wretches living in caves, and it contains power beyond imagining. If I read all the Nether Scrolls, I'd be as powerful as a god — nay, I'd be a god! Of course, the scrolls would drive me mad long before I finished reading them.

The ''Nether Scrolls'' were among the most influential artifacts in Faerûn.

An adventurer from Netheril known only as [[Finder (Netheril)|Finder]], After the discovery, the [[Netherese]] started to base their magic on the scrolls' theory, instead of the elves', for their magic followed inferior standards. 

After the discovery of the ''Nether Scrolls'', the arcane might of Netheril increased immeasurably. They learnt to craft ''[[mythallar]]'' and utilized that magical technology to create the fantastic [[Netherese enclave|flying cities]] of their empire, This newfound power only lasted for the short duration before the empire's fall, due to the catastrophe of [[Karsus's Folly]]. 

Numerous powerful Netherese [[artifact]]s were created using information from the ''Ars Factum'' chapter of the scrolls, including the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'' and the  ''[[Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings]]''. and ''[[History of the Nether Scrolls]]'', the latter of which was quite rare and valued at over 5,000 [[gp]].

==Known Scrolls==
{{Quote|Things are not as they seem. Seeming is illusion. Illusion is change. Things change.|Line one of column one, ''Arcanum Fundare Tiersus:'' Of fundamental or basic magic or mystery, the third lesson or chapter.}}

The tomb of [[Hssthak]] once contained ''Nether Scrolls'' known to the ancient elves to contain a pair of spells that could allow [[lizardfolk]] to gain much power and prestige. These scrolls contained the ''[[awaken intelligence]]'' and ''[[alter beast]]'' spells.

As mentioned above, every mage, knowing or not, based their magic on the theory of the ''Nether Scrolls''. Reading the ten scrolls that made up a chapter gave a reader comprehensive and holistic knowledge that expressed itself in special permanent abilities.

===Chapters===
The five chapters of the ''Nether Scrolls'' were:
;''Arcanus Fundare''
: The chapter "Foundations of Magic" was about fundamental magic. It gave the reader an instant boost to their spells' effectiveness and magical skill matching and/or surpassing that of true masters, but no additional base magical power.
;''Magicus Creare''
: The chapter "Spells of Creation" was about [[magic item]] creation. Reading it provided the user with the ability to create new magic items and the ability to create any magic item with less expenditure of one's essence.
;''Maior Creare''
: The chapter "Major Creation" dealt also with the creation of magic items but with the focus on [[construct]]s. It made the reader not only understand how to create constructs but also how to reliably create them at top quality without any fluctuation.
;''Planus Mechanus''
: The chapter "Studies of the Planes" dealt with the [[planes]] and allowed the reader to use ''[[plane shift]]'' and not suffer any negative effects from other planes' environments.
;''Ars Factum''
: The chapter "Of the Creation of Artifacts" Its contents were unknown, though naturally it was suspected to deal with making [[artifact]]s. This chapter's scrolls required some kind of key to be read, but it was never discovered.

==History==
{{Quote|You may have heard of them before as the ''Nether Scrolls'', from which the [[arcanist]]s of that ancient nation built their power and magical tradition. But let me tell you, the scrolls were ancient before the first towns of humans were founded on the shores of the [[Narrow Sea]].|The [[Terraseer]] ''circa'' [[1375 DR]].}}
In around {{Yearlink|-30000}}, the ''Nether Scrolls'' were created in [[Oreme]] by the [[sarrukh]]. They sought to gather all magical knowledge from their vast empire's borders into one location, in order to consolidate their arcane power. This effort spawned its own secret society, the [[Ba'etith]], and lasted thousands of years after the fall of the empires of the [[Creator Races]]. Their creation included magic from the [[batrachi]] and [[aearee]], but did not include that of the [[fey]] or humans.

The Netherese discovered the scrolls amid the ruins of [[Aryvandaar]] in {{Yearlink|-3533}}, marking the beginning of the [[Netheril#History|Nether Age]] of the empire.

They abandoned the forms of magic being taught to them by their elven neighbors, and refocused their search for arcane power with the newly-found scrolls. The enigmatic being known as the [[Terraseer]] arrived in Netheril about a century later, aiding its people with the translation and understanding of many of the ''Nether Scrolls'', as part of a grand experiment.

After over 400 years of study, the elves of [[Cormanthyr]] stole one set of the ''Nether Scrolls'' in {{Yearlink|-3095}} and hid it away in [[Windsong Tower]] in the city of [[Myth Drannor|Cormanthor]]. At an unknown date afterwards, [[Tyvollus Aluviirsan]] transformed one set of the ''Nether Scrolls'' into the ''Quess'Ar'Teranthvar''.

Several centuries later, in {{Yearlink|-2436}}, seven of Netheril's remaining ''Nether Scrolls'' were stolen by an unknown thief and returned to several creator race ruins: three were returned to the [[Hall of Mists]] underneath the [[Grandfather Tree]] in the [[High Forest]], two to the [[Crypt of Hssthak]] in the western stretch of what would become the Anauroch desert, and two remained unaccounted for as of the 14{{th}} century DR.

In {{Yearlink|-1896}}, a band of thieves stole 24 parts of the ''Nether Scrolls'' from the chambers of [[Ioulaum]]. Frightened of being discovered, they mashed the scrolls into golden lumps and sold them. All the remaining ''Nether Scrolls'' were stolen from their Netherese keepers in {{Yearlink|-664}}, while they were being transported from [[Seveton]] to the enclave of [[Eileanar]], enclave of the famous [[Karsus]].

After the fall of Netheril, during the time of the [[Lost Kingdoms|Lost Kingdom]] of [[Anauria]], one of the scrolls was recovered by Prince [[Hamukai]] and interred within a crypt in the city of [[Azumar]]. After almost being stolen by the [[blue dragon]] [[Zikzokrishka]], the prince offered to sacrifice his life in a manner to seal the vault with magic and protect the scroll from future theft.

During the 14{{th}} century DR, in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, the three scrolls that lay within the Hall of Mists were taken by the [[bard]] [[Mintiper Moonsilver]] and taken to other destinations.

In {{YearlinkName|1361}}, one of the scrolls was found in the ruins of [[Dekanter]] by a lone [[Beast Lord|alhoon]] that ascended up from the [[Underdark]]. For seven years, the scroll was used by the alhoon to conduct experiments on the [[Dekanter goblin|local goblin]] populations, before it was recovered by a hedge mage named [[Druhallen]]. The mage then gave the scroll to [[Wyndyfarh|Lady Wyndyfarh]], a mysterious agent of [[Mystra]], who secreted away for safe-keeping.

The whereabouts one of the scrolls were uncovered around the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, by the former [[Red Wizard]] [[Edwin Odesseiron]]. He tracked down the scroll to an underground crypt beneath the [[Athkatla/Grave District|Graveyard District]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[West Faerûn|western Faerûn]].

Six years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, [[Hadrhune]] and [[Shadovar]] agents of [[Thultanthar]] managed to break into the reemergent city of [[Myth Drannor]] and stole the ''Quess'Ar'Teranthvar'' from beneath Windsong Tower. In response, [[Darcassan]] the Farseer conscripted a band of adventurers to ensure the tree, and thus [[the Weave]] itself, was not corrupted by the followers of Shar. The adventurers used the ''[[Chalice of Amaunator]]'' to dissolve the tree into the original scrolls, and scattered them across the Realms.

In the mid-1480s [[DR]], the [[Shadovar]] of Thultanthar used the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'' to launch a covert [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon|invasion of Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] by using it to open and stabilize the [[Shadowfell Nexus]]. While this plan worked early on, it was eventually discovered and defeated by the forces of Cormyr, and the ''Nether Scroll'' was taken away by [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]]. This led to a length chase across Cormyr, culminating in Oriphaun hiding pieces of it along the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]]. Though the [[Harpers]] fought to keep the ''Nether Scroll'' out of Netherese hands, the Shadovar arcanists managed to reassemble it, only to accidentally open a ''[[portal]]'' to the Abyss and summon the [[demon]] [[Razagnol]]. After a brief battle, the ''Nether Scroll'' was taken by [[Elminster]] for safekeeping.

During the late 15{{th}} century DR, in the {{yearlinkName|1492}}, a group of adventurers discovered the ''Nether Scroll'' of [[Azumar]], though its final fate was unknown.

==Rumors & Legends==
The origin of the scrolls was known to very few beings. Some scholars could attribute their creation to one or more of the [[creator race]]s, without knowledge of which were involved, while others believed they came from another [[crystal sphere]], or were bestowed upon humanity by the goddess [[Mystryl]].
