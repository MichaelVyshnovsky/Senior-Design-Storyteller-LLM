{{quote|''This is the first in a series of reference books aimed at the recreationist. In these pages are the battles fought by [[Yamun Khahan]], [[Batu Min Ho]], and all the others caught up in the sweeping [[Tuigan|Horde]] campaigns. The strategies and disposition of forces are set forth in plain terms. Sixteen color plates show the arms and armor used by each army. BATTLESYSTEM™ Rules statistics allow for the complete recreation of each battle fought in this massive campaign. Ten interior maps delineate the terrain and forces involved in each major confrontation. With this book you, too, can fight from the edges of far eastern [[Kara-Tur]] across [[Hordelands|the steppes]] into the heartlands of [[Faerûn|Faerun]]. Whether you wish to replay the wars in precise detail, or try your own strategies, this is the book that will help you achieve your goal. ''}}
