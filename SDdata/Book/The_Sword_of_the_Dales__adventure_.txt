'''''The Sword of the Dales''''' is a <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">[[Forgotten Realms]]</span> adventure published in 1995 by [[TSR]]. It is designed for four to six characters of levels 1-4.

{{Quote|''The ''[[Sword of the Dales]]'', an icon of the [[Dalelands]] symbolizing the unity and strength of the people, has reappeared! Created by [[Shraevyn]] the weapons-mage hundreds of years ago, the lost ''Sword'' had become nothing more than a fantastic children's tale&mdash;until now.''

''A group of warriors led by [[Randal Morn]], rightful ruler of [[Daggerdale]], rushed to the ''Sword's'' resting place to recover it, but dark forces awaited them, and Randal and his men fell to an ambush. Only one man escaped, yet he brought hope with him that Randal Morn yet lives. Resolved to rescue his leader, that lone survivor turned to [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]] for aid.''

''But [[Elminster]] is gone, off plane-hoping while the fate of [[Daggerdale]] hangs in the balance. Hence, it is up to [[Lhaeo]], scribe to the old mage, to find a group of heroes who have mettle enough to face down the menace which claimed Randal Morn and his hearty followers...''

''This is the first of three modules that grant the player characters the opportunity to determine the fate of [[Daggerdale]]. The Saga continues with ''[[The Secret of Spiderhaunt]]'' and concludes with ''[[The Return of Randal Morn]]''}}
