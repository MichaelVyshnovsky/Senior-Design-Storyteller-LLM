        "mainbody": "'''''The Veiled Dancer of Calimport''''' was the ballad that made the courtesan only remembered as the titular Veiled Dancer of [[Calimport]] into a famous character, penned ''circa'' the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Contents": "Even though her name was long forgotten by the 14{{th}} century, the Veiled Dancer of Calimport was a courtesan who became famous after her death. The song ''The Veiled Dancer of Calimport'' immortalized the woman, penned by an anonymous musician. The song was composed of numerous verses, each ending in the unlikely happening – the Veiled Dancer of Calimport dancing across the events described in the verse. Such events included battlefields, moonlit glades used for enthusiastic trysts, the clouds across from tower windows of a king's throne room just after his assassination, leaving newly opened crypts after it was sealed for untold centuries, etc."
