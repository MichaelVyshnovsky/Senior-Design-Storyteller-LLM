The song The Veiled Dancer of Calimport immortalized the woman, penned by an anonymous musician. The song was composed of numerous verses, each ending in the unlikely happening â€“ the Veiled Dancer of Calimport dancing across the events described in the verse. Such events included battlefields, moonlit glades used for enthusiastic trysts, the clouds across from tower windows of a kings throne room just after his assassination, leaving newly opened crypts after it was sealed for untold centuries, etc."
