'''''Runepowder and the Modern Gnome''''' was a [[tome]] that contained a treatise on the recreation of the mythical ''[[runepowder]]'', penned sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I ask my most renervated and prodigiously talented audience to suppose the following: Runepowder as we know of it may no longer exist at our particular space time-environment, but it most absolutely exists within our minds. both singular and collective. And now we've landed upon a fascinating bit of philosophy. Think (ha!) of the following formula: thought <nowiki>+</nowiki> behavior <nowiki>=</nowiki> action. Then why not the following? Thought <nowiki>+</nowiki> idea <nowiki>=</nowiki> action. With our knowledge of runepowder's unique properties, why can we - the reader, myself, anyone with an interest, really, not manifest that which we can imagine?''|Excerpt from ''Runepowder and the Modern Gnome''}}

==Contents==
This extremely wordy tome collected lore and [[gnome|gnomish]] legends regarding the mythical and deadly explosive substance called ''runepowder.'' It also presented a possibility of the lost substance's recreation by the modern gnomish masters. The book also mused on such seemingly random topics as the space-time environment and the thought-behavior-action philosophy.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Runepowder and the Modern Gnome'' belonged to [[Gyldro Angleiron]] the Smith and the proprietor of [[Rivington General]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district of Baldur's Gate.
