'''''Quests from the Infinite Staircase''''' is an adventure anthology for 5{{th}}-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' published in July 2024.

{{Quote|
'''Step through a Door to Adventure'''

The Infinite Staircase spirals in a dreamlike expanse, with doors leading to fantastic realms. It's home to the noble genie Nafas, who hears wishes made throughout the multiverse and recruits heroes to fulfill them. These pleas summon adventurers to lost caverns suffused with planar energy, fairytale gardens in the [[Feywild]], futuristic spaceships, and other wondrous locales.

This anthology weaves together six classic {{SmallCaps|Dungeons & Dragons}}<sup>Â®</sup> adventures while updating them for the game's fifth edition. You can run these quests individually or as a campaign that takes characters from level 1 to level 13.

This book includes the following adventures:
* ''Beyond the Crystal Cave''
* ''Expedition to the Barrier Peaks''
* ''Pharaoh''
* ''The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth''
* ''The Lost City''
* ''When a Star Falls''
|Back-cover text}}

==Description==
''Quests from the Infinite Staircase'' updates and adapts six well-known adventurers from earlier editions of {{dnd}}: ''The Lost City'', ''When a Star Falls'', ''Beyond the Crystal Cave'', ''Pharaoh'', ''The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth'', and ''Expedition to the Barrier Peaks'', suiting player-characters of levels 1 to 13. These use the [[Infinite Staircase]] as a linking story.

As adaptations, these adventurers are not considered canon for this wiki, though ''Pharaoh'' was previously adapted to the ''Forgotten Realms'' in ''[[Desert of Desolation]]'', which is considered to be canon.
