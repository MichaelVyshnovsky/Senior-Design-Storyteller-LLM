Monster Manual 3 is an expansion upon the first and second monster sources, including many new monsters, as well as new versions of older ones. Unlike its predecessors, this book contains no information on playable monster races.
The chapters are as follow
# Monsters A to Z — This chapter, by far the largest, includes roughly 200 monsters, from abyssal hulks to yuan-ti, listed alphabetically. Each section focuses on a particular monster type, with a small amount of background information for use in games, along with statistics for use in an encounter.
# Glossary — An explanation of the terms used in the book, such as creature origins (including natural creatures and elementals) as well as game mechanics terms.
# Monsters by Level - A listing of all the monsters detailed in the book, sorted alphabetically by level and monster role.
