The Final Sacrifice of the Moon Daughter was a Sharran text, penned before the 15 century DR.
The scroll was a prophecy or more of an instruction regarding a powerful sacred spear of Shars faith. The weapon was said to had been wielded by the goddess herself, then placed in the Silent Library by the elders of the Gauntlet of Shar â€“ a hidden Sharran temple complex under the town of Reithwin in the Western Heartlands. The spear would one day be wielded by Shars chosen champion to perform the final sacrifice of the Nightsong and bring grief to the Moonmaiden. The text warned even true believers away from trying to use the spear, as in their hands the weapon would have no magic, and all they could do was guard it for the prophesied wielder.
