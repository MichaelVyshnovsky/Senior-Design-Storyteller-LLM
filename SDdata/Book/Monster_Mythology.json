        "mainbody": "Monster Mythology is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.\nMonster Mythology is the 4 book in the Dungeon Masters Guide Rules series and details the gods of the non-human races and various monsters.\nThe introductory section of the book delineates the central motif, focusing on deities beyond the human realm. It furnishes an overview on the incorporation of deities within a narrative campaign, elucidating their ubiquitous abilities and categorizing them into a hierarchical structure spanning four levels of potency from Demigod to Greater God.\nThe bulk of the accessory is dedicated to 131 divine entities, organized into eight segments based on differing mythologies. For each deity, the text provides a comprehensive description, game-related statistics (including the deitys alignment, the prevalent alignment among its followers, its domain of influence, and its emblem). Additionally, each segment offers insights into the deitys avatars and its clergy.\nThe first appendix offers additional guidance on the development of avatars within the gameplay, covering various scenarios such as the avatars potential abode, instances where it might become a patron to a group of adventurers or elect an adventurer as a companion, situations necessitating rescue, the loss of a magical item, requirements for discovery by player characters, or scenarios where the avatar develops an affection for a mortal character.\nThe second appendix provides references for Dungeon Masters seeking detailed information on the deities specific to the game worlds within Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.\n* Chapter 1 Introduction\n* Chapter 2 Gods of the Demihumans\n* Chapter 3 Goblinoid Deities\n* Chapter 4 Gods of the Underdark\n* Chapter 5 Gods of the Giants\n* Chapter 6 Gods of the Seas and Skies\n* Chapter 7 Gods of the Scaly Folk\n* Chapter 8 Gods of the Dark Folk\n* Chapter 9 The Sylvan Gods\n* Appendix 1 Avatars in Game Play\n* Appendix 2 Deities and Game Worlds\n Elven deities   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n Dwarven deities   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n Gnomish deities   •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n Halfling deities   •  •  •  •  • \n Orcish deities   •  •  •  •  • \n Goblinoid deities   •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n Kobold deities   •  • \n Drow deities   •  •  • \n The Lost Gods   •  • \n Giant deities   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n Draconic deities   •  •  •  •  • \n Lycanthrope deities   •  •  •  • \n The Seelie Court   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n Other deities   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n Demon lords   •  •  •  • \n Great heros   •  •  •  • \nMonster Mythology Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Writer Carl Sargent\n* Editor Scott Haring\n* Illustration Terry Dykstra\n* Color Illustration John and Laura Lakey, Keith Parkinson\n* Typography Gaye OKeefe\n* Production Sarah Feggestad"
