Of the Fall of Netheril was a book written by Rhaugilath the Ageless, also known as the Shackled Scribe of Larloch, a Netherese archlich dwelling at Warlocks Crypt.
The book detailed Netherils complete history. However, Rhaugilath considered the Netherese Diaspora after Netherils fall to be an integral part of the history, as well as the expected restoration of Netheril, thought to be only beginning in 1374 DR. Thus, Of the Fall of Netheril was never likely to be finished, though it had reached several volumes by that time.
Larloch reviewed each chapter as it was completed, and they were delivered to Candlekeep to be archived in the library there.
In one passage, Rhaugilath discussed the phaerimm, the formation of the Anauroch, and historys perception of Netheril. The book also provided important information about the mysterious Terraseer and mentioned the castle of Spellgard.
