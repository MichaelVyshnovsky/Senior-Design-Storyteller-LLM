        "mainbody": "Rock Eaters\" They are Not! was a book dedicated to debunking perceived stereotypes about dwarves, found in the libraries of the Hand of the Seldarine before the strongholds fall centuries before 1281 DR.\nThe elven author of the book took upon themselves the task of researching many misconceptions and false beliefs held by the Fair Folk about dwarves. The research was performed after the author was invited to visit a dwarven citadel, Dorns Deep. There they first witnessed dwarves eating habits, which did not, contrary to popular belief, include eating dirt and rocks. The tome also praised Dorns Deeps grand architecture as the author expected to be covered in dirt and soot during the visit, unbefitting a high elf. Friendly dwarves proudly demonstrated every wonder and beautiful detail of the underground realm to the fair visitor.\nDespite being impressed with the stout folk of Dorns Deep, the author, who hailed from the grand Hand of the Seldarine, still considered dwarves a \"lesser race\" and claimed that wonders created by the Tel-quessir were by far superior. However, the high elf did not feel comfortable pointing out dwarven inferiority during the tour.\n\"Rock Eaters\" They are Not! was written and printed sometime between the citadels construction circa 900 DR and its fall in the Battle of Seldarines Hand. By the , the citadel was ruined and inhabited by ghostly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One copy could be found in the citadels library curated by Custhantos, along with many other rare tomes."
