'''''"The Crafty Maid's Policy"''''' was a song about the eponymous crafty maid and the target of her cunning, performed and enjoyed in [[Faer√ªn]].The title of the song is unknown, but the lyrics are very closely derived from the real-world folk song The Crafty Maid's Policy. The name of its real counterpart is used for convenience.

==History==
[[File:Beckside song.jpg|thumb|300px|''Lunasa (right) and Merlin (left) performing for no particular audience.'']]
The song was performed as a duet by the [[bard]] [[Lunasa Eveningwood]] and her companion [[Merlin Fastfoot]] while they stayed at [[Beckside Castle]] in [[Cormyr]] one night during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They also sang ''[[Here's a Health to the Company]]'' and ''[[The Mermaid]]'' together.

==Lyrics==
{{quote|''Come listen a while and I'll tell you a story,<br/>of three merry gentlemen riding along.<br/>They met a fair maiden and unto her did say,<br/>"We're afraid this cold morning might do you some harm."<br/><br/>"Oh no, kind sir," said the maid, "you're mistaken,<br/>to think this cold morning might do me some harm.<br/>Yet there is one thing I crave, and it lies twixt your legs sir,<br/>if you give me that it will keep me warm."<br/><br/>"Oh since you do crave it, my dear you shall have it,<br/>if you'll come with me under yonder green tree.<br/>Oh since you do crave it, my dear you shall have it,<br/>I'll make these two gentlemen witness to thee."<br/><br/>The gentleman lighted and straight way she mounted,<br/>and looking the gentlemen hard in the face,<br/>said, "ye knew not my meaning, you wrong understood me."<br/>And away she went galloping down the long lane.<br/><br/>"Come gentlemen lend me one of your horses,<br/>that I might ride after her down the long lane.<br/>If I over-take her, I warrant I'll make her,<br/>return unto me own horse again."<br/><br/>This young maid was watching, she saw them a-coming,<br/>she instantly then took her pistol in hand,<br/>said, "doubt not my skill, or it's you I shall kill,<br/>and I'll have you stand back or you are a dead man."<br/><br/>"Oh why do you spend all your time here in talking,<br/>oh why do you spend all of your time here in vain?<br/>Come give her a penny, it's what she deserves,<br/>and I warrant she'll give you your horse back again."<br/><br/>"Oh no, kind sir," said the maid, "you're mistaken,<br/>for if it's his loss then it is my gain,<br/>and you are a witness that he gave it to me."<br/>And away she went galloping over the plain.''
|The lyrics, as sung by Lunasa and Merlin}}
