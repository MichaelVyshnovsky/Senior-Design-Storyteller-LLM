        "mainbody": "The '''''Great Goblin Recipes''''' was a two-volume [[book]] that collected recipes for the culinary masterpieces of the [[goblin]]folk of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].",
        "Contents": "Both volumes listed a handful of strange goblin recipes. One notable recipe from the volume was called \"Cheesy Skewers.\" It called for five [[rat]]s, five [[skewer]]s, one [[bucket]], one [[basket]], some [[goat cheese]], [[salt]], [[beer]], and [[oil]]. The instructions for the dish were as follows: Step one—drink beer. Step two—place [[goat]] [[cheese]] on the ground and hide. Drink more beer while hiding. When the cheese attracted rats, catch them with a bucket and transfer them into a basket. Throw more cheese in the basket to fatten up the rats. More beer. Put each rat on a skewer, dip in more beer, and roll in salt. The rat skewers were then submerged in boiling hot oil until all fur was burned off. When cooked, rats were served on a platter with yet more beer for dipping.\n\nVolume two featured such treats as \"Stinky Beef Stew.\" Each recipe called for one whole deceased [[cow]], including innards, a handful of black [[mold]], a handful of [[mushroom]]s, seven pints of beer, seven pints of scrumpy [[cider]], and some thorny bush. The cow carcass was separated into four pieces. Entrails were wrapped tight around each cow piece and pinned with a sharp [[toothpick]] to stay in place. Each cow piece was held over the fire until the cook knew it was ready due to an eye-watering stench. Cow pieces were chopped up and tossed into a [[stew pot]]. The cook then drank all the beer and poured the cider into the pot, then boiled. Mold, mushrooms, and thorny bush were then tossed into the stew, and the entire pot was cooked until burnt. The stew was served with a sprig of [[parsley]] and a [[lemon]] wedge.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, ''Great Goblin Recipes'' were the inspiration for the cattle theft by goblins of the [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]]'s army, hidden in the caves of the [[Wild Pastures]] outside of the city of [[Daggerford]]."
