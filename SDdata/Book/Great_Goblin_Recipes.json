        "mainbody": "The Great Goblin Recipes was a two-volume book that collected recipes for the culinary masterpieces of the goblinfolk of the Delimbiyr Vale.\nBoth volumes listed a handful of strange goblin recipes. One notable recipe from the volume was called \"Cheesy Skewers.\" It called for five rats, five skewers, one bucket, one basket, some goat cheese, salt, beer, and oil. The instructions for the dish were as follows Step one—drink beer. Step two—place goat cheese on the ground and hide. Drink more beer while hiding. When the cheese attracted rats, catch them with a bucket and transfer them into a basket. Throw more cheese in the basket to fatten up the rats. More beer. Put each rat on a skewer, dip in more beer, and roll in salt. The rat skewers were then submerged in boiling hot oil until all fur was burned off. When cooked, rats were served on a platter with yet more beer for dipping.\nVolume two featured such treats as \"Stinky Beef Stew.\" Each recipe called for one whole deceased cow, including innards, a handful of black mold, a handful of mushrooms, seven pints of beer, seven pints of scrumpy cider, and some thorny bush. The cow carcass was separated into four pieces. Entrails were wrapped tight around each cow piece and pinned with a sharp toothpick to stay in place. Each cow piece was held over the fire until the cook knew it was ready due to an eye-watering stench. Cow pieces were chopped up and tossed into a stew pot. The cook then drank all the beer and poured the cider into the pot, then boiled. Mold, mushrooms, and thorny bush were then tossed into the stew, and the entire pot was cooked until burnt. The stew was served with a sprig of parsley and a lemon wedge.\nIn the , Great Goblin Recipes were the inspiration for the cattle theft by goblins of the devil Gorgomorzs army, hidden in the caves of the Wild Pastures outside of the city of Daggerford."
