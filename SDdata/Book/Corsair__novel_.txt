{{quote|''[[Kamoth Kastelmar]], Lord of the Black Moon''

''He was a sadistic young lord who charmed his way into the marrying the Harmach of [[Hulburg]]'s sister before he was exiled for conspiring against his new brother-in-law.''

''Now he is Captain of the [[Kraken Queen]], High Captain of the [[Black Moon Corsairs]]—a ruthless pirate fleet that scours the [[Moonsea]], raping, pillaging, and burning wherever they go.''

''He was willing to let bygones be bygones, but when the Harmach of Hulburg arms a warship to thwart his piracy, he starts taking their actions against him personally.''

''It's time to teach the harmach a lesson in respect.''

''It's time to raze Hulburg.''}}
