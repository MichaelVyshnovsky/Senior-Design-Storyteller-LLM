        "mainbody": "The ''''' Book of the Silver Talon''''' was the personal [[spellbook]] of the feared [[archmage]] [[Asmiak]].",
        "Description": "Asmiak's workbook was a black, leather-bound tome that held 25 pages made of papyrus. The edges of the pages had been painted red, a detail that was visible whether the book was closed or open. Inlaid into the front cover was a small claw, or talon made of [[silver]] but it had no outward marks of ownership.",
        "History": "Originally, the ''Book of the Silver Talon'' was used by its author Asmiak as a workbook, during his apprenticeship\nto the [[wizard]] [[Thurl]]. It is unknown how it slipped from his possession, but the book exchanged hands many times in the years to follow. Many of the mages who temporarily possessed the book have died at the hands of Asmiak's agents, in his attempts to reacquire his stolen volume.\n\nOne such mage was [[Casimur]], who was slain by a group of [[gargoyle]]s on Asmiak's command. After they recovered the tome, the gargoyles flew east across mountains and deserts towards the home of Asmiak. When they passed over the [[High Forest]], they soared to rest and were shot down by a volley of [[silver]] [[arrow]]s. The book however was not recovered by the [[elven]] archers and would wind up in the stewardship of another mage.\n\nThe ''Book of the Silver Talon'' was next known to be in the hands of the magician [[Phandal]], after finding it in a bazaar. He in turn traded it to the [[thaumaturgist]] [[Alphon]], who wound up fleeing from numerous [[goblin]] raids upon his home. Next in possession was the [[druid]] [[Rairun|Rairun \"Blackbrow\"]], who shipped it in a caravan to a colleague, only to learn of that caravan vanishing in the moorlands. It was next found by the adventurer [[Shoon (adventurer)|Shoon]], who brought it with him to [[Waterdeep]]. Shoon traded it to the merchant [[Deragus]], who lost it when his shop was robbed by the master thief [[Dunas]]. Its next owner or owners were unknown and as of [[1359 DR]] the spellbook was still unaccounted for.",
        "Contents": {
            "Variant spells": {
                "''[[Burning hands]]''": "Asmiak's version of this spell had a longer verbal component but allowed for an extended range, from two to eight feet. The mage [[Casimur]] noted it could be fanned back and forth, which when combined with the longer scope, made it much more powerful.",
                "''[[Flame ray]]''": "This improved variant further increased its potency, creating a more destructive and wider cone of flame extended for 20 feet or more. This version was of higher level",
                "''[[Darkness, 15' radius]]''": "The notes Asmiak included for this spell had the caster using a clump of [[bat]] fur and a smashed vial of [[giant octopus]] [[ink]], rather than [[coal]] or [[pitch]], which was smashed on the ground as the material component. This gave the spell a shorter duration, which was reduced even further if [[giant squid]] sepia was used as substitution.",
                "''[[Ray of enfeeblement]]''": "A different verbal component was used; this increased the casting time by 50% and fixed the range to 60 yards and the duration to that of a moderately high-level [[wizard]].",
                "''[[Gust of wind]]''": "Asmiak's version included a different somatic and material component, using a [[sycamore]] tree seed cluster and a [[milkweed]] pod. These changes gave directionality to the spell, allowing the caster to rapidly change the course of flow for the wind."
            },
            "Spell list": "It contained the following spells:\n''[[Read magic]]'' &bull; ''burning hands'' &bull; ''[[comprehend languages]]'' &bull; ''[[detect magic]]'' &bull; ''[[erase]]'' &bull; ''[[write]]'' &bull; ''[[identify]]'' &bull; ''[[message]]'' &bull; ''[[shocking grasp]]'' &bull; ''[[shield]]'' &bull; ''[[phantasmal force]]'' &bull; ''darkness, 15' radius'' &bull; ''[[detect invisibility]]'' &bull; ''[[knock]]'' &bull; ''ray of enfeeblement'' &bull; ''[[web]]'' &bull; ''[[wizard lock]]'' &bull; ''[[blink]]'' &bull; ''[[dispel magic]]'' &bull; ''gust of wind'' &bull; ''[[infravision (spell)|infravision]]'' &bull; ''[[protection from normal missiles]]''\n\nThe last pages of the spellbook contained Asmiak's notes on the ingredients and preparation for the inks used to inscribe its lowest-level spells, or the first ten entries in the preceding list."
