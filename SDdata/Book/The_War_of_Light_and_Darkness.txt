'''''The War of Light and Darkness''''' was a tome of religious lore dedicated to the ancient feud between [[Selûne]] and [[Shar]] copies of which were in wide circulation along the [[Sword Coast]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
The told the tale of Lord [[Ao]] and the creation of [[Toril]] in which existed the realm of shadows, before the creation of light and darkness. The shadow void condensed and turned into the twin goddess sisters. The sisters created [[Chauntea]] and one of them, Selûne became the source of cool radiance, while the other - exuded darkness of the night. Newborn Chauntea pleaded for warmth so she could create life and that request caused a rift between the twins. They fought with each other in the conflict that birthed gods of war, pestilence, death, murder, and other tumultuous spheres of influence.

The book continues the tale with Selûne opening a rift into the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and creating a sun to warm Chauntea. This act infuriated Shar and she started sniffing out lights and draining the heat out of the crystal sphere. Fighting back in desperation, Selûne ripped magic out of her own body and thew it on sister's body to stop her destruction. The magic pulled the twin's magical energies as well which led to the creation of [[Mystryl]]. Bearing both light and darkness in her, Mystryl balanced the twins' conflict achieving a truce.

The book concluded by describing the status quo of the sisters' war. Shar remained wrapped in darkness and loneliness, was plotting her bitter revenge, as Selûne being bathed in light and surrounded by her daughters.
