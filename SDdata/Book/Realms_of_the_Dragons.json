All the short stories relate in some way to the [[Year of Rogue Dragons]].\n\n{{Quote|''Raging dragons threaten to destroy civilization on Faerûn, but that hasn't always been the case. There have even been times when humans and dragons have worked together to preserve life and combat evil.''\n\n''Of course, that doesn't happen very often. Most of the time, they just try to kill each other and steal as much treasure as they can in the process.''\n\n''This collection of all new stories by Forgotten Realms creator Ed Greenwood; ''New York Times'' best-selling authors Elaine Cunningham, Richard Baker, Lisa Smedman, and R. A. Salvatore; The Year of Rogue Dragons author Richard Lee Byers; and many more, bring the myriad sides of the dragons of Faerûn to life.''\n\n''The Year of Rogue Dragons has only just begun, but the history of that powerful race of enchanted creatures is long, frightening, and beautiful indeed.''}}",
