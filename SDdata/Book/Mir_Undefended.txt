{{quote|''And if we are now come at last to the inevitable<br/>To the meal that shall end in bitter confrontation<br/>Where hard words shall be loudly spoken<br/>And sharp swords sing and shed much blood<br/>To leave lives splattered across the floor<br/>The succulence of the dishes swift forgotten<br/>Well then, before all the violence begins,<br/>Let it at least be deemed a memorable feast.''|An excerpt from Act II, Scene IV, of ''Mir Undefended''}}
