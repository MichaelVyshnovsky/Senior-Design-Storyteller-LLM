It is the first real insight into why Elminster is \"Elminster\". It starts with an overview of his tragic childhood, on to his even rougher life growing up trying to hide who he is. Then as a thief he sneaks into a closed temple of Mystra to defile it. He is about to set to his task when he is spotted by a mage but then saved by the Lady of mysteries and given a chance to slay the mage that was to slay him. After he debated with the Goddess over whether or not it is right to use magic he let the mage go. Mystra then helps to hide him from those who might want him to be used in their plots, or just kill him, until he has the power to take his revenge.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n () •  ( •  •  • ) •  •  •  •  •  ( • )  •  •  •  ()\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSubstances\n •  •  •  •  • \nWeapons\n • \nBuildings\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nGeographic Features\n •  •  •  •  • \nRegions\n •  •  • \nSettlements\n •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  • \nMiscellaneous\n •  •  •  • \nSpells\n •  •  • \nArt & Literature\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther\n • \nPlants\n • \n •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •"
