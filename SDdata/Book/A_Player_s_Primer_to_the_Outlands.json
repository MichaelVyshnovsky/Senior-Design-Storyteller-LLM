It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|''You've never seen a skull like this one, cutter - it's made of a silvery metal, with rainbow hues cascading over its shiny surface. Local bashers call it a mimir. Toss it into the air, and ask it questions: What is Ecstasy? Do fiends patrol the Outlands? The floating skull slicks softly, scouring its enchanted vaults for the answers. Then its bone-box opens, driven by ancient pistons, and it begins to speak....''\n\n''A PLANESCAPE accessory for player characters of all levels, the Player's Primer provides a look at the Outlands, which surround the great city of Sigil - the gateway to all the Outer Planes. In this box, a cutter'll find:''\n\n* ''An audio compact disc that represents the mimir, a new magical item offering a strange and thrilling tour of the Outlands. More than 40 CD tracks allow players to hear what their characters would hear when consulting this handy (and some say dangerous) oracle.''\n* ''A 32-page guide to the most important sites and features of the Outlands.''\n*''A full-color poster map of the Outlands with never-before-seen maps of gate-towns.''}}",
