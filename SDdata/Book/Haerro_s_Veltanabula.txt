Haerros Veltanabula Being the Triumphal Battle Spells of Vultivar Haerro, Monsterslayer was an academic magic textbook written by the Netherese arcanist Vultivar Haerro.
The book was a collection of Haerros favorite combat spells. The spells included many early forms of more modern spells, such as a movable form of cloud of daggers, wall of force, forcecage, various mindworm spells that retributed against illithid attacks, ray-based spells designed to melt tentacles, and spells that shot cones of beads of force.
Haerros Veltanabula was considered a foundational classic by the arcanists of Netheril during the Age of Discovery ( onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy of it, along with other works such as Sarturls Study of Magical Fields, Skouloonds Spell Studies, Ivrynxras Exploration of Enchantments, and Oloams on Serpentine Matters.
