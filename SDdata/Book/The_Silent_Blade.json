        "mainbody": "The Silent Blade is the first book in the Paths of Darkness series by R.A. Salvatore. It was later reissued as book eleven of the Legend of Drizzt series.\nThe Silent Blade follows Drizzt DoUrden. It starts out with many characters but mainly him, Wulfgar, Bruenor, Catti-brie and finally the halfling Regis. Drizzt is carrying the Crenshinibon through Icewind Dale and Wulfgar has just been rescued from the demon Errtu. The story also looks at Artemis Entreri, who spends most of it in Calimport, a realm in Calimshan. Wulfgar, on the other side of the world ends up slapping Catti-brie, mistaking her for a succubus and flees, angry with the world. The other four main characters understand what a difficult time he has been having after having been tortured, but Bruenor is angry. Wulfgar kills an entire orc tribe to find that each kill does not sate him, but rather makes him worse, his bloodlust growing with every throat he slits. Later, Wulfgar walks into the city of Luskan, where he is hired as a bouncer and begins a relationship with Delly Curtie, one of the wenches at the bar. He is left out of the rest of the story but finds a friend in Morik the Rogue. Meanwhile Regis finds that many evil and wicked beings are seemingly enchanted by his ruby, which had belonged to Pasha Pook. The truth is that one of his \"friends\", a giant, is following him because of The Call of Crenshinibon. Entreri, meanwhile, kills Pasha Basadoni and gains considerable control of the Basadoni Guild. Drizzt and Entreri are brought together at the end of the book, courtesy of the drow Jarlaxle to do battle."
