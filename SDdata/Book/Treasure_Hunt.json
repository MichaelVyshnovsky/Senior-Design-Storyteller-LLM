It was published by TSR in 1986 as a 36-page booklet with a 3-panel outer folder. Included in the module is a 12-page removable inner section. \nTreasure Hunt is an adventure designed for zero-level characters. The player characters earn their way to 1st level. The scenario allows the characters to evolve into their roles as adventurers, instead of starting them out on that career. Those who fight well become fighters, those who study the magical items found along the way become magic-users, those who attempt thieving activities become thieves, and so on. Each characters actions and attitudes determine that characters character class.\nEach characters behavior also determines their alignment. The Dungeon Master (DM) makes alignment checks, and keeps track of how the characters behave in terms of role-playing and with handling magic and combat, recording how a character is developing towards a first-level character with a character class. The module includes record sheets as handouts for the DM to track PC behaviors.\nThere is a two-page \"Players Introduction\" at the beginning of the adventure that each player is supposed to read themself. The adventure includes a two-page appendix entitled \"If Things Go Wrong\", which is a detailed, episode-by-episode treatment of ways to handle the player characters if they dont do what they are expected to do during the course of the adventure.\nThe player characters must evolve into their roles as the adventure progresses, beginning as slaves on a galley who become freed after a shipwreck on an island where orcs and goblins contend over a treasure.\nThe characters begin in the Korinn Archipelago, and have been captured by slavers. A sea storm sends the pirate ship on which the characters are being held off course, and it crashes on an island once ruled by Viledel, the Sea King. On this island, a treasure has become the cause of a battle between orcs and goblins. The characters begin with no weapons, no money, and no possessions. After the shipwreck, the characters freedom is able to develop gradually, allowing them to make meaningful choices which will help them determine their career\n •  •  •  • •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nRegions  •  • \nSettlements  • \nBuildings & Structures  • \nTemples \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nItems •  •  •  • \nSpells  •  • \nTreasure Hunt Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nTreasure Hunt - goddess.png|The goddess of the Island of Viledel, Korinn Archipelago.\nManor of the Sea King.png|Survivors of a shipwreck, making their way through the Manor of the Sea King.\nViledel.png|Viledel the Sea King, raising to greet his unwanted guests."
