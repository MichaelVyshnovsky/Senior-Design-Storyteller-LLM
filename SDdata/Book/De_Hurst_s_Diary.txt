'''''De Hurst's Diary''''' was the personal journal of the cleric of [[Mystra]] and arcane scholar, [[Lenore De Hurst]]. It was written for a period of years during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Who would have thought, three years ago, that I would start a diary – not a research journal, but a real diary. I guess when every soul is more like to kill you than converse with you, talking to a book starts making sense.|Entry dated [[Alturiak 2]] [[1481 DR]].}}

==Description==
The diary contained the personal thoughts and musings that De Hurst believed relevant enough to scribe during their three-year expedition into the Underdark. It was kept separate from De Hurst's research work, which was focused on the study of [[sussur]] trees and their use in the creation of [[magical]] items and use as a source of power.

It was scribed in De Hurst's distinct cursive script in silver ink.
