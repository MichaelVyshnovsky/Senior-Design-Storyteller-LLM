        "mainbody": "The Magister is a 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory that was set in the Forgotten Realms.\nThe Magister was written by Ed Greenwood and Steve Perrin, with a cover by Jeff Easley. It was published by TSR in 1988 as a 64-page book.\nThe Magister is a supplement which describes magic items and spells specific to the Forgotten Realms setting, and includes rules for magic item creation, random tables for generating magical treasure, and descriptions of new magic items. Elminster narrates the book, and provides descriptive detail, history, and game mechanics for the magic he presents. The spells and spell descriptions are explicit and detailed, and the tomes that contain these spells are described in appearance and history. The book provides lore and descriptions of magical armor, clothing, rings, wands, swords, and miscellaneous magical items, as well as a short section on the creation of magical items.\nThe 64-page book includes a one-page foreword and introduction by Ed Greenwood, which outlines the subject of the book—new spells and magic items—and cites Pages from the Mages, a series of articles from Dragon magazine in which some of the content had previously appeared. \n\"How To Use This Book\", an article by Steve Perrin, explains how the book can be useful to both Dungeon Masters and players. The book details magical books of the Realms, each of which has its own unique properties and contains a number of spells. The spells themselves are elaborated by means of a chart which lists them by level, name, spell school, and which spellbook they may be found in. The book describes a variety of magic items unique to the Realms, including magic armor, clothing, miscellaneous magic items, potions, rings, rods, staves, and wands, unique swords, and other weapons. It details various methods by which characters may create magic items. The books inside front cover contains a table for randomly determining magical treasure found in this book, and the inside back cover details saving throws involved in creating magical items.\n* Forward and Introduction\n* How to Use This Book\n* Magical Books of the Realms\n* Magical Items of the Realms\n** Armor\n** Clothing\n** Miscellaneous Magical Items\n** Potions\n** Rings\n** Rods, Staves, and Wands\n** Swords\n** Weapons\n* Creating Magical Items\nBeltyn • Elminster Aumar • Khelben Arunsun • Khondall Sszundar • Nezram • Ragefast • Rathdaen • Shaeroon • Vaerendroon • Vangerdahast Aeiulvana\nArmor\nDzances guardian • Grimjaw • Hawkstones bulwark • Laerals storm armor • Laerals spell shield • Reptars wall • Shoons buckler • Thurbrands protector\nBooks\nBook of Bats • Book of Thorns • Caddelyns Workbook • Dethos Libram • Jalusters Orizon • Libram of Lathintel • Selvars Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms • Shadowtome • Shandarils Workbook • Tome of Rathdaen • Unique Mageries • Tome of Rathdaen • Unique Mageries • Vaerendroons Ineffable Enchantments\nClothing\nCloak of battle • cloak of comfort • cloak of delight • cloak of echoes • cloak of fangs • cloak of guarding • cloak of many colors • cloak of reflection • cloak of stars • cloak of survival • cloak of symbiotic protection • cloak of the shield • girdle of lions • Rhuns horned cloak •  • the wonderful hand\nMiscellaneous\nAzlaers harp •  • Doves harp • Esheens harp • Censer of thaumaturgy • Fire Gyregam • Flagon of dragons • Glowing globe • Goblet of glory • Greenstone amulet • Helm of darkness • Janthras harp • Kybals cords • Methilds harp • Mierests Starlit Sphere • Nithanalors harp • Orb of holiness • Rhingalades harp • Trumpet of doom • Valardes harp • Zunzalors harp\nPotions\nMist of rapture\nRings\nJhessails Silver Ring • Ring of lore\nRods, Staves, and Wands\nCatstaff • Nidus Wand of Endless Repetition • Staff of ethereal action • Staff of skulls • Wand of armory • Wand of banishment • Wand of darkness • Wand of displacement • Wand of eyes • Wand of hammerblows • Wand of knock • Wand of magical mirrors • Wand of obliteration • Wand of Ochalors Eye • Wand of teeth • Wand of warding • Wand of whips • Whispers Rod of Transportation\nSwords\nAlbruin • Adjatha • Arbanes Sword of Agility • Demonbane • Ilbratha • Namarra • Shazzellim • Singing sword • Susk • Syrars Silver Sword • Taragarth\nWeapons\nDarts of Branding\nBacklash • Beltyns burning blood • Blacklight • Caddelyns catastrophe • Catapult • Censure • Circle dance • Control vapor • Decastave • Dethos delirium • Dire charm • Firebrand • Flying fist • Ghost pipes • Greenwood • Icelance • Ironguard • Hold vapor • Hover • Khelbens warding whip • Magemask • Mailed might • Missile mastery • Nezrams ruby ray • Night scar • Phezults sleep of ages • Plague • Power word, silence • Quimbys enchanting gourmet • Ray of Ondovir • Shaeroons scimitar • Shandarils tracer • Skyhook • Spellstrike • Spelltrap • Spell ward • Spidereyes • Synostodweomer • Tome guardian • Turnshadow • Vipergout • Wall of sand • Waves of weariness • Xults magical doom\nThe Magister Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nMagister Cover.jpg|Full cover\n* Design Ed Greenwood, Steve Perrin\n* Editing Karen S.
