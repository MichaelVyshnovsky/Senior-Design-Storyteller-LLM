'''''The Dalelands''''' is a 2nd-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|''Between [[Cormyr]] and the [[Moonsea]] lie the beautiful forests and fields of the [[Dalelands]], home to some of the most powerful characters and exciting adventures in the Heartlands. Proud and free, these scattered realms stand against the dark evil of [[Zhentil Keep]] and the savage raiders of the mountains and forests. Ancient magic lies buried in dangerous ruins within the vast Elven Woods, waiting for the hand bold enough to seize it.''

''The Dalelands are a place where adventurers are welcomed, and heroes rewarded with gold, honor, and power. Enemies, old and new, move against the Dales constantly, and the call goes out for brave and true heroes to defend the land!''

''The Dalelands are the oldest campaign setting of the Forgotten Realms, finally described in detail. New and exciting information about each of these independent lands is contained in this accessory. Of course, the dark and sinister enemies who plot against the Dales are described as well! Prepare to meet the challenges of the Dalelands!''}}
