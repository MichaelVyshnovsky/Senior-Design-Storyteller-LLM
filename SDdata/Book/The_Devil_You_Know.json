Evans]].\n\n{{quote|''The long-awaited finale of SCRIBE award winning-author Erin M. Evans’s riveting ''Brimstone Angels'' series, featuring her signature character, [[Farideh]], as she’s caught up in an epic battle of good versus evil, rife with deception and intrigue, where the question is as much who is evil, as how they can be defeated. The stakes have never been higher, and the fallout will shake the Hells, and through them, the Forgotten Realms.''\n\n''Before Farideh took a [[Warlock#Infernal pact (The Fiend, in 5th Edition)|devil's pact]], before she was [[Chosen]] by the [[Asmodeus|god-king]] of the [[Nine Hells|Hells]], before any of this started, there was [[Bryseis Kakistos]], the original Brimstone Angel, first of Farideh’s line. Now, at the end, there is also Bryseis Kakistos—but this time, instead of helping the king of the Hells achieve godhood, she’s going to kill him. All she needs is a little help from Farideh—which she should, by all accounts, be happy to give. After all, who could object to killing the king of the Hells? Except, it turns out, Farideh. Because as always, things are far more complicated than they seem.''}}\n\n{{refs}}\n[[Category:Novels]]\n[[Category:Books]]\n[[Category:Published in 2016]]\n[[Category:Works by Erin M.
