Let all of Lady Shar's children be honored to protect the sacred instrument.''|Excerpt from ''The Final Sacrifice of the Moon Daughter''}}",
        "Content": "The scroll was a prophecy or more of an instruction regarding a powerful sacred [[spear]] of Shar's faith. The weapon was said to had been wielded by the goddess herself, then placed in the Silent Library by the elders of the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] â€“ a hidden Sharran temple complex under the town of [[Reithwin]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. The spear would one day be wielded by Shar's chosen champion to perform the final sacrifice of the [[Nightsong]] and bring grief to the Moonmaiden. The text warned even true believers away from trying to use the spear, as in their hands the weapon would have no magic, and all they could do was guard it for the prophesied wielder."
