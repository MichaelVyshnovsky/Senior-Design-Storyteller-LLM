        "mainbody": "altims Tome of Fire was a spellbook written by the wizard and psionicist Daltim Flamefist of Halruaa. It contained a number of rare and unique fire-based spells, details on several light- and fire-themed magical items, and brief treatises on fire magic, psionics, and the creation of psionically empowered items. It was lost, presumed stolen, in Tethyr in the 1360s DR.\nDaltims Tome of Fire was a small book, only around  high,  wide and  thick. It contained only fifty pages of thick paper light gray in color. It was bound in rich red leather, said to be the hide of a salamander, and a dragon-like design—Daltims sigil—was stamped on the front cover. The cover was unnaturally warm to the touch, but the pages unnaturally cool. They could not be burned.\nIn addition to the written spells it contained, the book was protected by Daltims proof against fire, rendering it impervious to flame and Daltims fiery protector, which summoned a minor fire elemental to guard it if opened by anyone but Daltim.\nDaltim lost the tome in Tethyr in the 1360s DR, while his mercenary company, the Destroyers, were involved in the civil war there. The book was presumed stolen, as he was unlikely to forget or lose it. Daltim fortunately had other copies of the spells, but wished to recover for the book for the many notes hed made in it.\nHe still hadnt located his Tome of Fire by the mid-1370s DR, and was offering a hefty 10,000-gp reward for its return, with 1,000 gp for credible information as to its whereabouts.\nThe pages contained a number of rare and even unique fire-themed spells, including\n* Daltims flaming fist\n* Daltims fiery protector\n* Daltims proof against fire\n* everlasting fire\n* flameproof\n* fire gate\n* shroud of flame\n* unburn\nThe book also gave details of a number of magical items related to light and fire, namely\n* magic match\n* magic tinderbox\n* glow ring\n* one-way lantern\nIt also gave instructions for fashioning the magic tinderbox.\nFinally, the book had notes on creating psionically empowered items, together with a brief treatise on their benefits, as well as more general treatises on psionic powers and fire magic.\nCategoryBooks (in-universe)\nCategorySpellbooks\nCategoryItems from Halruaa\nCategoryItems from the Shining South\nCategoryItems from South Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\n46y08oiappf8oj1nnumf8x10f8epogq"
