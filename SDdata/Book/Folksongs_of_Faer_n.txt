'''''Folksongs of Faerûn''''' was an unfinished [[bard]]ic [[book]] that collected many of [[Faerûn]]'s simpler songs, available in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''[[Myconid Song]]''. By [[Oghma]], I hear it AND I see it AND I know it AND I feel it. But I can't write it. Or can I?|Excerpt from the ''Folksongs of Faerûn''.}}

==Description==
The book was an unfinished and poorly organized manuscript, bound in a simple light green cover, decorated with golden frame and script.

==Content==
The tome collected tablature, folk, and tavern songs from across Faerûn and recorded their lyrics. The book contained records of several musical stiles from various regions of the Realms. One song of note was the ''Myconid Song''. The author found it difficult to record or even describe the composition as it was of a psychic nature and was comprised of feelings, rather than lyrics and notes.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], the manuscript could be found discarded in the vicinity of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
