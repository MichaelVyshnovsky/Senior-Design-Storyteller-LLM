        "mainbody": "AD&D Miniatures was a line of metal miniatures produced by Ral Partha for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons between 1987 and 1997. The line consisted of thirty box-sets and hundreds of blister packs focused around D&D and its many settings. Elements of the Forgotten Realms setting featured in a number of ranges, with the Battlesystem range in particular drawing upon a number of books that used the streamlined second edition of the eponymous rule set, Battlesystem Miniatures Rules.\nAD&D Miniatures began production in 1987 after TSR, Inc signed a licensing agreement with Ral Partha. One of the lines earliest Forgotten Realms box-sets was announced by James Ward in the Game Wizards column in Dragon #132, saying it would be shown off at that years Gen Con Game Fair. During the companies nine years of production the two worked closely together on releases to ensure quality and logical consistency with proportions or scale.\nIn 1996, as part of their War with Myrkyssa Jelan storyline, the Living City organized play program held an Interactive event at that years Gen Con Game Fair involving AD&D Miniatures. Those wishing to participate were instructed to purchase and paint a blister pack of the 15mm scale Battlesystem, or Ral Parthas generic Rank & File, figure lines and bring them to the convention. Only select blister packs were permitted to be fielded, with each costing in-game gold pieces to muster. And rather than the Battlesystem Miniatures Rules, the event used the mass combat rules presented in Players Option Combat & Tactics.The units that were allowed to be fielded at the Gen Con 96 Living City event included the following Cormyr Lancers of the Eastern March (25k gp), Cormyr Militia (2000 gp), Cormyr Swordsmen (7500 gp), Elf Foresters (15k gp), Elf Horse Archers (30k gp), Lances of Cormyr Mounted Knights (50k gp), Elven Noble Archers of Evereska (20k gp), Iron Dwarven Axemen of Tethyamir (15k gp), Iron Dwarven Regulars of Tethyamir (10k), Longbowmen of Cormyr (15k gp), Peasant Levy (100 gp), Silver Elf Pikemen of Evereska (15k gp), and Tethyamir Crossbowmen (15k gp).\nFollowing their acquisition of TSR in 1997, Wizards of the Coast terminated Ral Parthas licensing agreement, ending the AD&D Miniatures line.\nA two boxed-set range consisting of various 25mm scale characters from Forgotten Realms novels, such as The Finders Stone trilogy and Legend of Drizzt. The notable exception to this is the warrior Thunderstorm (sans horse), who is featured on the box art of the Heroes set, which is a reuse of Keith Parkinsons cover art for the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set. This set was notably the first product to give Thunderstorm his name. The box art for the Menzoberannzan set is also a reuse, taken from the original cover for Homeland.\nthumb|250px|Heroes of the Forgotten Realms gather together for a group photo.\nReleased April 27, 1988Catalog Number 10-550Cover Illustrator Keith ParkinsonSculptor Dennis Mize\nthumb|250px|The (heroes?) of Menzoberranzan gather together for a group photo.\nReleased July 1, 1993Catalog Number 10-551Cover Illustrator Jeff EasleySculptor Dennis Mize\nA range of 37 blister packs consisting of individual characters from the Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms settings.\nThe earliest line of figures produced by Ral Partha. Each of the boxed-sets in this range consisted of a brigade that were advertised as being led by a noteworthy hero or villain from the Forgotten Realms, with two of them being from Kara-Tur.

Unlike the AD&D Forgotten Realms box-sets, each of these had wholly original artwork for their covers.\nEach of the boxed-sets included a campaign scenario designed for the streamlined second edition of the Battlesystem tabletop rules, Battlesystem Miniatures Rules. Each of these campaign scenarios provided background, a battle setting, and statistics for the combatants involved.\nThe Horde and Billid√ªm shared a campaign scenario pitting the two forces against each other, entitled \"Battle of Ejen Horo\", set in the valley of Ejen Horo sometime prior to Yamuns rise to the position of Khan of the Hoekun.
