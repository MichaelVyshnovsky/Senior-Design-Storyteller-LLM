'''''The Poet's Song''''' was a series of [[enchanted]] [[scroll]]s with songs written by the blind poet of the ancient [[Daargard Keep]],  on the shores of [[Torslunda]], sometime long before [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
Each magical scroll of ''The Poet's Song'' contained one ballad about a different theme and had different magical powers. The ''Song'' found among [[Torleth Mindulspeer]]'s treasures was written about the blind poet's fear of death. When a [[bard]] sang it, they gained a temporary mastery over death while the words of the song drained the life out of surrounding enemies.

==History==
Many, many years before 1372 DR, a nameless blind poet resided in the lone crumbling Daargard Keep on the shores of Torslunda. For years, nightly, the blind poet worked tirelessly under flickering [[candle]]light, putting his thoughts on scrolls in verse. The poet knew a secret method of imbuing his works with magic through powerful blood-scribed runes. Later in his life, the blind poet started feeling the coming cold breath of death, yet he lived long enough to bury his son. 

Many more years later, an unnamed lord and lady arrived at the shores of Torslunda in search of adventure. The couple explored the abandoned Daargard Keep and discovered several of the blind poet's magic-imbued scrolls. These wondrous items became the noble family's heirlooms and were guarded, preserved, and passed along from generation to generation. The blind poet's songs were sung often, entertaining and captivating the minds of those who had the honor of hearing these ballads.

In 1372 DR, one of ''the Poet's Song'' scrolls was discovered among the seemingly mundane antiques in [[Torleth's Treasures]] in [[Gillian's Hill]]. The proprietor was not aware of the scroll's magic nor history and was selling it for mere 400 pieces of [[gold]].
