Avernus Survival Guide was a book about the art of alchemy and the Part V of the Basics of Alchemy series penned by Haskinn Xhesilaphin, a dragonborn alchemist sometime before the late 15 century DR.
One of the books chapters was titled On Traversing the First Layer and described the grim unwelcoming landscape of the Avernus, the first layer of Baator â€“ stretches of desolate barren rocky land menaced by a black sky, cut across with rivers of blood. The author echoed common guidance for those brave or stupid enough to venture into the Hells "turn around and run."
In the , copies of Avernus Survival Guide were sold at The Bibliophile book shop in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate by its proprietress, Nansi Gretta.
