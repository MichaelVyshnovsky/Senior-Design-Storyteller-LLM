        "Description": "''The Mad Worship'' was a heavy tome bound in [[iron]]. It was wrapped in fabric and locked with iron [[chain]]s preventing anyone from opening the forbidden book. This tome radiated palpable evil.\n\nThe book, apparently, possessed [[sentient item|sentience]] and malicious intent, if freed from the metal bounds and opened, the evil book started loudly chant something sinister in an unknown language, calling upon Juiblex.",
        "History": "Sometime before the fall of Myth Drannor, the dwarves of the city created the arcane ''Pyre of Silence'' in the Deep Halls of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. The ''pyre'' was used to safely dispose of evil [[magical item]]s. During the chaos of the [[Weeping War]], a collection of evil books that included ''The Mad Worship of Juiblex, God of Slime, the Ancient God of the Underdark'' was bound for destruction but because of the fall of the city the books were left scattered around the many levels of the dungeons. ''The Mad Worship'' could be found in one of the locked rooms in the ''Halls of Stone'' level of the dungeon in [[1369 DR]]."
