The Malebdala, or The Book of the Shadows when translated from the ancient Talfirian tongue, was an ancient book of Talfir. The author was unknown, but there may have been more than one author that contributed to the book.
Similar to an encyclopedia, it detailed many ancient matters long forgotten by the 14 century DR, such as magic, monsters, and magical items. A passage of the book described the rise of the Shadowking, and his defeat at the hands of the bard Talek Talembar. It was perhaps the only known source of information on the thirteen shadevar as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The original was destroyed in battle when two mages fought each other to the death. Nearly all copies were lost or ruined by the mid-1300s. One copy was in the library of Elversult, where it had laid for two centuries until it was stolen in 1363 DR by Tembris for Ravendas. Another copy was made by a loremaster of Oghma, Loremaster Erill, in a monastery in the Sunset Mountains. That copy was given to the wizard Morhion Gendahar in 1363 DR and since then resided in his tower in Iriaebor.
