The '''''Mal'eb'dala''''', or '''''The Book of the Shadows''''' when translated from the ancient [[Talfiric|Talfirian]] tongue, was an ancient book of [[Talfir]]. The author was unknown, but there may have been more than one author that contributed to the book.

==Contents==
Similar to an encyclopedia, it detailed many ancient matters long forgotten by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], such as [[magic]], monsters, and [[magical item]]s. A passage of the book described the rise of the [[Shadowking]], and his defeat at the hands of the bard [[Talek Talembar]].<ref> It was perhaps the only known source of information on the thirteen [[shadevar]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

==History==
The original was destroyed in battle when two mages fought each other to the death. Nearly all copies were lost or ruined by the mid-1300s. One copy was in the library of [[Elversult]], where it had laid for two centuries until it was stolen in [[1363 DR]] by Tembris for [[Cutter (person)|Ravendas]].<ref> Another copy was made by a loremaster of [[Oghma]], Loremaster Erill, in a monastery in the [[Sunset Mountains]].<ref> That copy was given to the [[wizard]] [[Morhion Gen'dahar]] in 1363 DR and since then resided in his tower in [[Iriaebor]].<ref>
