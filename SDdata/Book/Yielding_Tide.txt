The Yielding Tide was an ancient book written about a long-lost city-state that existed in the area that came to be known as the High Moors.
The book told a story about how the adept wizards of a lost realm once trapped a lesser goddess on Toril, in an attempt to steal her power. Legends said that the deity was still trapped beneath the ruins of that forgotten city.
A copy of Yielding Tide was available from within the library of Candlekeep in the Sword Coast. It originated with an anonymous author from Cormyr.
