The '''''Yielding Tide''''' was an ancient [[book]] written about a long-lost city-state that existed in the area that came to be known as the [[High Moors]].

==Contents==
The book told a story about how the adept [[wizard]]s of a lost realm once trapped a lesser [[god]]dess on [[Toril]], in an attempt to steal her power. Legends said that the deity was still trapped beneath the ruins of that forgotten city.

==Notable Owners==
A copy of ''Yielding Tide'' was available from within the library of [[Candlekeep]] in the [[Sword Coast]]. It originated with an anonymous author from [[Cormyr]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}
