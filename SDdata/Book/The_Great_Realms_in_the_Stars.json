        "mainbody": "'''The Great Realms in the Stars''' was a significant philosophical dissertation on the subject of cosmology. It was written by [[Jhevven Dree]] during the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Contents": "Within the book, the author introduced the idea of [[elven]] [[spelljammer|skyships]] and explored the possibility of [[crystal sphere|other worlds]] to which they may have traveled. He offered enough details about these locations, along with those about other [[planes of existence]], to suggest that he had visited them personally.\n\nDree implied that the divinity of the [[deity|gods]] was derived from the energy of these other worlds. He believed they could draw upon these forces and imbue these worlds with a portion of their own divinity, thereby ensuring it could not be affected by any living mortal. He theorized that mortal beings could achieve this same fate through mastery of [[the Art]].",
        "History": "''Great Realms'' was considered an important work as was not written with a bias towards a particular deity of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]], as many others philosophical writings were."
