Maztica Campaign Set is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
Maztica Campaign Set is organized into three primary volumes. The initial volume, a 96-page book titled Journey to the True World, provides an extensive overview of Maztican history and setting, serving as a foundational reference for the campaign. The second volume, Maztica Alive!, expands upon this foundation with detailed discussions on aspects such as terrain and climate, regional descriptions of Maztica, navigational routes from the Sword Coast to Maztica, concepts of the afterlife, a concise adventure, and descriptions of four novel monsters. The concluding volume, a 32-page book named Gods and Battles, is dedicated to delineating the rules and information pertinent to the Maztican deities, in addition to including maps for navigation and exploration.
A Journey to the True World intricately details the process for generating characters suited to the Maztican setting. It introduces races such as desert dwarves, halflings, and humans, and features two distinct warrior kits the Eagle Knight and the Jaguar Knight. These kits are notable for their specialized armor and access to Pluma and Hishna spells at lower levels, respectively. Furthermore, it addresses the role of priests in accessing Pluma or Hishna magic, while exclusively permitting artisans—introduced as two new rogue classes, Plumaweavers and Hishnashapers—to master the highest levels of these spells. Additionally, the volume offers a comprehensive guide to Maztican currency, armaments, and spellcraft, enriching the campaigns depth and authenticity.
