        "mainbody": "Soldiers of Ice, by David Cook, is the seventh book in the loosely related The Harpers series.\nMartine of Sembia, a Harper trainee, is sent by a senior Harper Jazrac to close a rift to the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice in the Great Glacier. She meets a former paladin of Torm called Vilheim Baltson, who assists her. She seals the rift successfully, but not before Vreesar, an ice elemental, escapes, taking control of the Burnt Fur gnolls  and leading them to attack the nearby Vani gnome village. \nJazrac arrives and is revealed to be a coward who only sends others to carry out missions. Martine plans to give the stone used to seal the rift to Vreesar, sending him to try to reopen the rift. Krote Word-Maker, a gnoll shaman who she captured, will attempt to take control of the tribe and make peace, while Martine and Vilheim try to stop Vreesar and Jazrac teleports to Shadowdale and sends Harper backup. The plan fails when Vreesar attacks the gnomes, killing Jazrac. Ultimately, Martine, Krote, and the gnomes kill Vreesar, although Vilheim dies in the process. Martine and Krote set out for Harper business in Mulmaster.\nMain Characters\n •  •  • \nOthers\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \nLandmarks\nRegions\n •  •  •  • \nSettlements\n • \n •  •  •  •  • \n • \n •  • \nFood & Drink\n •  •  () •  •  •  • \nClothing\n •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  • \nMaterials & Substances\n •  •  •  •  • \nPlants\n •  •  •  • \n •  •"
