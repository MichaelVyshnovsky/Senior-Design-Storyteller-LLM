        "Summary": "[[Pawldo]], a [[halfling]] adventurer and resident of [[Lowhill]], is sought out by the youngling [[Stefanik]], who found a strange, gemmed dagger in the nearby [[Llyrath Forest]]. They soon deduce the treasure to be from the [[Palace of Skulls]], the home of Prince [[Ketheryll]], tyrant of [[Gwynneth]] from the past. After a thorough search, they find the Palace, full of treasures. While they are hoarding the valuables, they venture deeper and deeper into the Palace, only to find the [[undead]] remnant of Prince Ketheryll. It turns out the Prince himself lured them to his palace, so he can transform them into trinkets&mdash;the treasures in the Palace. In the ensuing battle they manage to escape the place and bring away the only real treasure in the Palace: a pair of rings that Pawldo intends to give to [[Tristan Kendrick|King Tristan]] and [[Robyn Kendrick|Queen Robyn]].",
