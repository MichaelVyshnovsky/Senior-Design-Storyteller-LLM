        "mainbody": "The Dirge of Delzoun was an epic dwarven ballad that told the grim tale of the shield dwarves of the North. It has never been translated from any language other than Dwarvish and was only known by a handful of dwarven bards. Over the years, only a select few elves and humans had ever heard the song performed in its entirety, a feat that would would take almost thirty hours.\nThe Dirge of Delzoun recounted the rise of the Citadels in the Northdark, to the shield dwarves settling of the Silver Marches. Throughout the ballad, listeners were regaled with legendary tales of Delzouns most famous heroes,\nIn the late 14 century DR, King Emerus Warcrown designated Ollyn Grimtongue as Citadel Felbarrs \"dirgekeeper,\" the sole dwarf who was granted permission to contribute to the dirge."
