'''''Monster Manual v.3.5''''' is a core sourcebook for the 3.5{{th}}-edition of {{dnd}} ruleset.

{{Quote|''Fearsome and formidable foes lurk within. Encounter a horde of monsters armed and ready to battle your boldest heroes or fight alongside them. The fully illustrated pages of this book are overrun with all the creatures, statistics, spells, and strategies you need to challenge the heroic characters of any ''Dungeons & Dragons'' roleplaying game.''

''Over 200 creeps, critters, and creatures keep players on their toes. From [[aboleth]]s to [[zombies]], the revised ''Monster Manual'' holds a diverse cast of enemies and allies essential for any ''Dungeons & Dragons'' campaign. There are hundreds of monsters ready for action, including many new creatures never seen before. The revised ''Monster Manual'' now contains an adjusted layout that makes monster statistics easier to understand and use. It has 31 new illustrations and a new index, and contains expanded information on monster classes and playing monsters as heroes, along with information on how to take full advantage of the tie-in ''D&D'' miniatures line planned for the fall of 2003 from [[Wizards of the Coast]], Inc.''}}

==Description==
''Monster Manual v.3.5'' has a slightly different entry on each monster than ''[[Monster Manual 3rd edition]]''. Notably, each monster's attack has been divided into attack and full attack entries. Some creatures from the ''[[Psionics Handbook]]'' and the ''[[Manual of the Planes 3rd edition|Manual of the Planes]]'' were added. Further revision included the addition of an enhanced version of most monsters as an example of advancement (usually either with a template or with class levels). Many monsters also included instructions on how to use them as player characters. 

''Monster Manual v.3.5'' was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012.
