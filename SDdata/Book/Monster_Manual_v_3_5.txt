Monster Manual v.3.5 has a slightly different entry on each monster than Monster Manual 3rd edition. Notably, each monsters attack has been divided into attack and full attack entries. Some creatures from the Psionics Handbook and the Manual of the Planes were added. Further revision included the addition of an enhanced version of most monsters as an example of advancement (usually either with a template or with class levels). Many monsters also included instructions on how to use them as player characters.
