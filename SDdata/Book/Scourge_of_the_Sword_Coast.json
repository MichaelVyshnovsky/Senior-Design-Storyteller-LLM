This adventure is the first part of the Dreams of the Red Wizards campaign, which continues with the Dead in Thay adventure.Tito Leati, Matthew Sernett and Chris Sims (February 2014). Scourge of the Sword Coast. (Wizards of the Coast), p. 2\nRecent events caused the brief reactivation of the portal to Avernus in Dragonspear Castle. During that window of opportunity, the shade of the pit fiend Baazka reentered Faerûn. Baazka has allied himself with the Red Wizards of Thay whose plans for the Sword Coast, although disrupted by the adventurers hired by Sir Isteval, continue regardless. Baazka has revealed a portal network to the Thayans that they hope to co-opt and use to bring a stream of reinforcements from their homeland. To prevent more setbacks caused by adventurers, Baazkas allies have tasked him to rouse the local monster population into raiding the countryside around Daggerford.\nRefugees, fleeing from these raids, are now being turned away from Daggerford. A dwarven relic belonging to Duke Maldwyn has been stolen, which has infuriated him and placed Sir Isteval under suspicion in connection to the theft. Adventurers in Daggerford travel to various sites in the area, disrupting the plans of the Red Wizards until finally learning the location of the Thayan base - Bloodgate Keep.\nBaazka • Flubnak • Gabulla • Hustil Benzur • Isteval • Jekk Ironfist • Lutha • Maldwyn Daggerford • Nalifarn • Noyerghu • Oyfanen • Pencheska • Sezibul • Shalendra Floshin • Shorg • Thegger Grynn • Tyrob • Wartsnak\n •  •  •  •  •  • \n • darkenbeast • dread warrior • duergar • earth grue •  • giant viper • gnoll • grick •  • hobgoblin • lemure • mane • orc warrior • orog • rat • shadow • skeleton • tiger •  • wolf • wraith • zombie\nItems\n+1 chainmail • +1 dagger • +1 longsword • +1 silvered greataxe • +1 warhammer • bag of holding • cloak of elvenkind • face of gorm • pearl of power • spellguard shield\nPotions\npotion of climbing • potion of diminution • potion of healing • potion of mind reading • potion of poison\nDaggerford • Firehammer Hold • Floshin Estate • Harpshield Castle • Phylund Lodge • Julkoun\n • \nAmaunator •  •  •  • \nArmor \nGemstones  •  •  •  • \nFood & Drinks  • \nItems  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nTools\n  •  •  • \nMaterials & Substances  •  •  •  •  • \nPlants \nVessels"
