        "mainbody": "The Illustrated Adventures of Balduran was an adventure book containing the tales of the hero Balduran.\nThis story book was bound with a hardback cover that was somewhat ornately designed, however, most remaining copies were ragged with faded ink. The illustrations were said to be crude, though drawn with a passion. The creatures and characters described within appeared to be over-exaggerated.\nOne particular tale told of the time when Balduran was approached by a devil. The devil demanded his soul, and Balduran agreed, but only for something else in return. Balduran wished for a turnip in exchange. Later in the story, Balduran has the devil kneeling at his feet, who is now bound to his service. The story concludes with Balduran laughing at the bound devil, and boasts \"Never underestimate the power of a turnip!\""
