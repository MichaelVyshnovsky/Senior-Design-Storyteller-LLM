Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. It is part of the Planescape campaign setting.
The Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix was published by TSR, Inc. in 1994 as a loose-leaf binder filled with monster sheets, which could be added to a Dungeon Masters binder of monsters for use in their game.
The Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix includes information on various creatures that players and Dungeon Masters may encounter in the Planescape setting. Each monster entry includes details on the creatures physical appearance, abilities, behavior, and habitat.
The Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix is intended to be used in conjunction with the Monstrous Manual, which provides more comprehensive information on monsters from various D&D settings.
