        "mainbody": "Beldrouks Bright Banners was a periodical chapbook published in the city of Hillsfar of the Moonsea region in the late 15 century DR.\nBeldrouks Bright Banners could be considered a local cult favorite publication for its blunt political opinions and commentaries written by anonymous contributors. All Beldrouks writers had to remain unnamed because Hillsfars government was trying to track them down. Publishers and printers of Beldrouks Bright Banners were also unknown, with bundles of the chapbooks mysteriously appearing in Hillsfars docks and picked up in bulk by festhalls, taverns, and other distributors."
