        "Description": "''Beldrouk's Bright Banners'' could be considered a local cult favorite publication for its blunt political opinions and commentaries written by anonymous contributors. All ''Beldrouk's'' writers had to remain unnamed because Hillsfar's government was trying to track them down. Publishers and printers of ''Beldrouk's Bright Banners'' were also unknown, with bundles of the chapbooks mysteriously appearing in Hillsfar's docks and picked up in bulk by festhalls, taverns, and other distributors."
