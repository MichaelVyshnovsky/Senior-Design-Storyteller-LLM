[[Artemis Entreri]] and [[Jarlaxle]], having journeyed for some time together working as bodyguards and bounty hunters, join a band of poor highwaymen for Jarlaxle's entertainment. They spend nearly two tendays with the group, capturing the baker [[Piter McRuggle]], before the band's thugs bring in two young women as captives. Jarlaxle and Entreri turn on the group, soundly defeating them; Jarlaxle insists that they also free the young women and return them to their families.
