        "mainbody": "'''''Undermountain: Stardock''''', written by [[Steven E. Schend]], was released by [[TSR, Inc.]] in 1996. It is the last of three [[Dungeon Crawl series|Dungeon Crawl]] adventures to be set in the largest, most dangerous dungeon in the [[Forgotten Realms]]: [[Undermountain]]. The adventure is meant for 4-6 characters, levels 10-14.\n\n{{quote|''Had I not seen the chaos that ensued, I would never have believed the tale [[Elminster|Shadowdale's sage]] wove for me that day... Who would have believed that anything had the power to rip [[Halaster Blackcloak]] bodily from his Undermountain? Who again could predict the maelstrom of dangers that a dungeon gone mad would unleash upon an unsuspecting Realms? It is thanks to the brave and noble souls who dared reach into the villains' clutches to save the life of Halaster the Mad Mage that we all rise to greet another sun.\"''\n:â€“ [[Gamalon Idogyr]], starfaring mage formerly of [[Llorbauth]]\n\n''This DUNGEON CRAWL adventure returns once more to the hallowed halls of Undermountain, but it's a different day. At dawn of [[Highharvestide]] [[1369 DR|1369]], every practitioner of magic on the [[Sword Coast]] knew there was a problem. By midmorning, the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] confirmed the ill omens: Some brave souls worthy of the title \"Hero\" must enter Undermountain on a mission to save Halaster Blackcloak! Could these heroes be your group of player characters?''\n\n''This is a stand-alone module and does not require extra support materials. It can be placed into a campaign on any AD&D world, but best fits and impacts a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign set in Undermountain or [[Waterdeep]].''}}\n\nThis source book is now available as a [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/2/fr_downloads/tsr9538.zip free PDF] from WotC's website.",
