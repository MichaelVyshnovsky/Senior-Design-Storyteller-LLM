The Complete Rangers Handbook is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.
The Complete Rangers Handbook is the 11 book in the Players Handbook Rules series. It is designed to provide players and Dungeon Masters with comprehensive information and resources for creating and playing ranger characters.
The book offers detailed guidance on creating ranger characters, including character attributes, race options, and background considerations. It provides players with the tools to design rangers with diverse personalities and backgrounds. The sourcebook explores the unique abilities and skills that define rangers. Rangers are wilderness experts, skilled trackers, and expert marksmen. The book covers their tracking abilities, survival skills, and mastery of the natural world.

Rangers have favored enemies, and The Complete Rangers Handbook explores this concept in detail.

The book provides campaign ideas and adventure hooks that involve ranger characters and the challenges they might face, such as wilderness exploration, tracking down dangerous creatures, or protecting remote regions.
