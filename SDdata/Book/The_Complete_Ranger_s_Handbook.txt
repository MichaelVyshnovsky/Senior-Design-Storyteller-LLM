==Description==
''The Complete Ranger's Handbook'' is the 11{{th}} book in the [[PHBR series|Player's Handbook Rules series]]. It is designed to provide players and Dungeon Masters with comprehensive information and resources for creating and playing [[ranger]] characters.

The book offers detailed guidance on creating ranger characters, including character attributes, race options, and background considerations. It provides players with the tools to design rangers with diverse personalities and backgrounds. The sourcebook explores the unique abilities and skills that define rangers. Rangers are wilderness experts, skilled trackers, and expert marksmen. The book covers their tracking abilities, survival skills, and mastery of the natural world. It discusses the role of animal companions that rangers may have. These loyal animal allies often serve as scouts, combat partners, and sources of companionship in the wild.

Rangers have favored enemies, and ''The Complete Ranger's Handbook'' explores this concept in detail. It includes guidelines for selecting favored enemies and provides rules for tracking and combating them more effectively. It includes information on equipment, weapons, and armor suitable for rangers. Rangers often favor ranged weapons, such as bows and arrows, and lightweight armor that allows for mobility.

''The Complete Ranger's Handbook'' introduces ranger-specific spells and magical abilities that allow rangers to harness the power of nature. These spells often revolve around nature-themed magic and survival. 

The book provides campaign ideas and adventure hooks that involve ranger characters and the challenges they might face, such as wilderness exploration, tracking down dangerous creatures, or protecting remote regions. It also includes profiles of notable ranger NPCs, both allies and adversaries, that can be used in campaigns as mentors, guides, or opponents.
