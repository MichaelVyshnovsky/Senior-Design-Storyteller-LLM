'''''The Black Book''''' was a tome sacred to the [[Beshaba|Beshaban faith]].

==Description==
''The Black Book'' was a tall, narrow volume, measuring {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} feet tall and one foot wide. The tome was bound in the [[dragonhide|hide]] of a [[black dragon]] embellished with black metal edges. The entire volume radiated a subtle aura of physical coldness and was cloaked in a ''[[continual darkness]]'' effect that extended {{SI|1|in|long=yes}} from its surface. Those in direct contact with the volume, however, could view the tome normally. When opened, the book was said to emit a single, distant toll of a bell and an aroma of fear, [[seaweed]], and death. 

==Function==
The book served primarily as a repository of spells, but it also seemed to have a deleterious effect on some of its readers. Living creatures who opened the book sometimes felt their vitality permanently but subtly diminished; [[undead]] creatures who opened the tome were sometimes sucked into the tome entirely; and those priests who studied the tome at length were reportedly plagued by ghostly voices. These effects gave rise to speculation of a [[demilich]] somehow associated with the volume that sapped energy from its readers.

==Contents==
''The Black Book'' contained only fifteen pages of white [[vellum]], two front and back bearing the symbol of Beshaba, and thirteen pages between, each detailing a different spell.  According to the list compiled by the Beshaban clerk [[Evalus of Carragar]], the spells were as follows: ''[[cause light wounds]]'', ''[[creeping doom]]'', ''[[darkfire]]'', ''[[detect poison]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[doomtide]]'', ''[[find traps]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[free action]]'', ''[[goad of misfortune]]'', ''[[pass without trace]]'', ''[[speak with dead]]'', ''[[spell immunity]]'', and ''[[whip of woe]]''.

==History==
The first scholarly mentions of ''The Black Book'' date from the early 11th century [[DR]]. Only a single name, [[Rendaunt]], tooled into the dragonhide cover, provides any possible indication of its authorship, but certain Beshaban teachings suggest that the volume may have been one of a number of magic items created by individuals who gave themselves over to the service of Beshaba in the aftermath of the [[Weeping War]].

The tome was discovered by an Beshaban acolyte, [[Thalaxas]], who was led by dream-visions to uncover the book amid the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. Initially mocked and cast out by his superiors for his visions, Thalaxas returned vindicated to his temple in [[Murpeth]], where he was proclaimed by a black-tentacled manifestation of [[Beshaba]] herself to be the goddess' "Servant Supreme" in [[Faerun]].

Thereafter known as Thalaxas the Tyrant, the priest abandoned the [[Murpeth]] temple to found other temples in remote areas of Faer√ªn. He ultimately perished in the [[Battle of Slaughterwyrm]] in [[1090 DR]], when the temple of [[Arlast Halungh]] was torn apart by [[blue dragon]]s. The book eventually made its way into the hands of the priestess [[Alass]] of the [[Dark Horns]] temple in the [[Snowflake Mountains]], but was lost again when the temple was sacked by orcs in [[1117 DR]].

The tome since made brief appearances in the hands of a succession of crazed mages, most notably [[Jaulothan Marlyx]], who appeared in [[Arrabar]] in [[1346 DR]] with two [[beholder]]s and laid waste to most of the city before he himself was destroyed by [[tanar'ri]] summoned by local mages. The book was lost in the resulting confusion, but appeared at least one other time that century, when the wizard [[Oshalon Drhee]] flaunted his possession of the book at a [[magefair]].
