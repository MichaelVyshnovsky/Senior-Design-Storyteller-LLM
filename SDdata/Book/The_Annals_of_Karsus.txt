'''''The Annals of Karsus''''' was a legendary tome of knowledge penned by [[Karsus]], the Momentary God, before the fall of [[Netheril]].

{{quote|The Annals of Karsus... The preamble to a civilization's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the ''Crown's'' construction. His designs for godhood.|[[Gale]] of [[Waterdeep]]}}

==Contents==
The [[book]] was ancient and hand-written. By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the book had been rebounded at least twice, with the latest cover adorned with the insignia of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. The entirety of the tome was a collection of notes written in [[Karsus]]'s personal [[wizard]]'s cipher, except for the final page.

{{quote|My great spell of transcendence is mine alone, not to be committed to ink and parchment, but I have also forged three supreme enchanted items that are the physical embodiments of my wizardry, and of them I shall make record.<br/>There is a ''Crown, an Orb, and a Sceptre,'' each night-alive and with its own power and purpose, and these I call the ''[[Regalia of Karsus]].''<br/>The ''[[Crown of Karsus]]'': to attract and absorb magical knowledge and give the wearer dominion over himself so that he remains his own entity apart from the [[Weave]].<br/>The ''[[Orb of Karsus]]'': a storage device or battery that condenses mystic power, ever-gathering so that it must be siphoned at intervals of its excess.<br/>The ''[[Sceptre of Karsus]]'': an instrument of projection, a focusing utensil for the precise wielding of unimaginably vast forces.<br/>Know of these items you must, for if I fail to achieve immortality, they will persist, and I dare say, 'live' on beyond me.|The last page of ''The Annals of Karsus''.}}

==History==
The legendary book was kept in magically secured and trapped vaults of [[Ramazith's Tower]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, under the ownership of [[Athkatla]]n mage [[Lorroakan]]. The section of the vault was unimaginatively named after Karsus himself. A copy of the rare [[spell]] was tucked within the book – the spell of ''[[dethrone]].''
