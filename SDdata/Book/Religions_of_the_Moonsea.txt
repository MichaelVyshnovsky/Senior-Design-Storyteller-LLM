Religions of the Moonsea was a book that collected information on the major churches of the Moonsea region, published sometime before 1373 DR.
The tome talked about how the pantheon worshiped in the region reflected the dangerous lives of its inhabitants. It described dogmas of the regions religions as one of the two groups "worship me, or bad things will happen to you" and "worship me, or I will do bad things to you." These religious outlooks shaped everyday lives and even the thoughts of the inhabitants of the Moonsea. The locals scoffed at outsiders who venerated deities of good and law. The worshipers of deities who patronized arts and revelry, such as Eldath, Sune, Finder Wyvernspur, Lliira, Milil, or Sharess, were openly mocked. When travelers from faraway lands visited the Moonsea, their "foreign" worship became a target for the cruel clergy of Xvim or later, his father, Bane. The regions favorite deities were evil and dark gods. The simple folk of the Moonsea paid respect to those evil gods simply out of fear and caution. Despite that, many of the inhabitants of the regions did not embrace the dark creeds of the evil churches.
By 1373 DR, copies of the Religions of the Moonsea could be found in all major cities of the Moonsea region.
