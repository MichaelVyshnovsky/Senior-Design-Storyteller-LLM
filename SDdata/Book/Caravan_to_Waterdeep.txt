'''Caravan to Waterdeep''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

Like the preceeding module, Caravan to Waterdeep seems to have never been played. The plotline can be surmised by the title: the party travels to Waterdeep where the [[Green Regent]] [[Otar]] is rumoured to have been seen.
