Caravan to Waterdeep is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.
Like the preceeding module, Caravan to Waterdeep seems to have never been played. The plotline can be surmised by the title the party travels to Waterdeep where the Green Regent Otar is rumoured to have been seen.
