'''''Tomes of the Supplicant''''' were [[enchanted]] prayer [[book]]s imbued with [[divine]] magics, created sometime before [[1281 DR]].

==Content==
A typical ''Tome of the Supplicant'' was a thick and heavy book of illuminated [[vellum]]. Its pages were filled with countless short prayers with their words imbued with words of power and calling.

==Powers==
When read out loud once per day, ''Tomes of the Supplicant'' bestowed divine favor upon individuals that read or listened to the words of power. This effect was similar to the ''[[prayer (spell)|prayer]]'' [[spell]].

''Tomes of the Supplicant'' could only be used by [[cleric]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the library of the [[Black Raven Monastery]], in the mountains above the [[Ice Lakes]] and the [[Black Raven River]], owned a ''Tome of the Supplicant'' and was willing to part it with a hefty fee.
