If a basher has the dark of them.''\n\n''These aren't doors in the traditional sense, cutter, but they're portals just the same. They appear for a short time every 500 years, popping up in different parts of Sigil. Each hides a mystery that's waiting to be solved, and together they just might hold the key to a secret of the multiverse. All a body's got to do is tumble to the right keys, open the doors, and face down the Unknown.' -- Estavan, merchant lord''\n\n''Doors to the Unknown is a collection of four Planescape adventures that can be played sepearately or as a mini-campaign. When four doors appear in the Cage, the barnies crawl out of the shadows, and the heroes get drawn into events that could have consequences for the entire multiverse. Each door leads to a different plane and a different deadly challege for the player characters. Together they offer a way to stop an ancient menace before it strikes again.''\n\n''The Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set is required to run these adventures. The Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix (I and II) and Uncaged: Faces of Sigil are recommended to enhance play.''}}",
