'''''Skouloond's Spell Studies''''' was an academic [[magic]] textbook written by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Skouloond]].

==Contents==
The book was an examination of [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. It focused on how to alter and substitute these components, for the purpose of modifying existing [[spell]]s and inventing new ones. It was similar to a substitution guide for cooking, teaching spellcasters the basics of adapting and experimenting with known formulae.

==History==
''Skouloond's Spell Studies'' was considered a classic and foundational piece of arcane science by the arcanists of [[Netheril]] during the Age of Discovery ({{yearlinkConvert|2654|NY}} onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy of it, along with others such as ''[[Haerro's Veltanabula]]'', ''[[Sarturl's Study of Magical Fields]]'', ''[[Oloam's on Serpentine Matters]]'', and ''[[Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments]]''.
