        "mainbody": "lanescape Torment is a Planescape novel by Ray and Valerie Vallese, first published in November 1999. It is loosely based on the story of the video game by the same name.There is an additional novel written by Rhys Hess that was packaged with some releases of the game as an unofficial extra and never published as a standalone book. Unlike the Ray and Valerie Vallese one, it was created by assembling the dialogue from the descriptions and dialogues from the video game, and is much closer to the canon confirmed by later Forgotten Realms and Planescape media. \nNameless One\nMorte • Annah • Dakkon • Fhjull"
