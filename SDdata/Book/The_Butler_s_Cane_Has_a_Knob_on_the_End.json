        "Content": "The novel's protagonist was the butler Vincent Raspington: a stiff-mannered and silly [[dragonborn]] man, who often was flummoxed over the romantic behaviors of noble ladies and their suitors. The dragonborn found himself in a comedy of errors with the nobles going \"arse-over-teakettle\" into lewd situations. One such erotic misadventure forced the massive dragonborn butler to pretend he was a timid [[gnome]] maid named Missy Wimplesnatch during a nobles' feast.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''The Butler's Cane Has a Knob on the End'' could be found in the [[Lady Jannath]]'s manse in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
