{{Quote|''What you don't know will kill you...''

''[[Demascus]] awakens surrounded by corpses, at a shrine littered with traces of demonic rituals, with no memory of his past. But the [[Firestorm Cabal]] remembers him—and the [[demon]] who leads them seems to have a personal vendetta against him. Dodging knives, uncovering clues left by his past life, and dueling demons, Demascus must figure out who he is, what battles he is fighting, and who is hunting him before one of them catches up with him.''}}
