Ghost and the Maiden was a popular ballad in the North in the late 15 century DR.
The song was a half-hour long and told a glorious, passionate, and tragic love story of a revenge-driven ghostwalker and a beautiful Nightingale who tries and fails to save the ghostwalker from himself.It is strongly implied that the Ghost and the Maiden is a rendition of the story told in the novel Ghostwalker.
As of , the Ghost and the Maiden was performed by bards and known by commonfolk from Silverymoon to Luskan. It was a favorite of the likes of Myrin Darkdance (who usually found the ballad moving and hopeful in spite of its sadness), the dwarven bard Boren (despite his relatively clumsy rendition of the song), and the assassin Red Logenn (who found the length of the song useful for passing the time while stalking his targets).
