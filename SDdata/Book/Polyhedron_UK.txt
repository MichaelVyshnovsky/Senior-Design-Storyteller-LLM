'''''Polyhedron UK''''' was an official publication of the Role Playing Gamers Association (RPGA) in the UK.

==History==
The magazine was published quarterly from 1998 to 2000. It was later merged with [[Polyhedron Newszine]].

Notably, every issue until the final one had a thin red strip at the bottom of the magazine cover where a message was written encyphered using a fictional alphabet from the Forgotten Realms: Issues 1 and 2 used [[Espruar]], while the issues 3 through 7 used [[Dethek]] runes instead. These messages were often nonsensical and appear to be intended as jokes.

==Issue Index==	
Only issues containing adventures or articles from the ''Forgotten Realms'' setting are found on the wiki.
