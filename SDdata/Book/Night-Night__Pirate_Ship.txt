Night-Night, Pirate Ship was a collection of thematic sea-sailing nursery rhymes, compiled and printed sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
One nursery rhyme of note included in the book was called Umberlee Remembers.
Night-Night, Pirate Ship could be found in the city of Baldurs Gate and sold by Thomas C. Quirkilious of Chromatic Scales. Another copy belonged to Lora, a sailor who inhabited the Lower City of the Gate.
