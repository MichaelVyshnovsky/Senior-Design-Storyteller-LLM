        "mainbody": "'''''History of the Crusade''''' was a book written by the [[bard]] [[Thom Reaverson]] in the early 1360s [[DR]]. It gave a careful and unbiased account of King [[Azoun IV]]'s crusade against the [[Tuigan Horde]] in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]].",
        "History": "Following the war, Thom Reaverson wrote ''History of the Crusade'' while in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], at the king's request. At the time, he provided translations and guidance for [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]], who was a guest of Azoun in Suzail for over a year and who, also at the king's request, wrote up an account of his experiences with the Tuigan. Koja felt ''History of the Crusade'' was a more complete account of the war than his own.<ref group=\"note\">As Thom and Koja worked together in Suzail, and the two books are bound together, it seems likely that Thom also wrote ''History of the Crusade'' for King Azoun.",
        "Locations": "One copy was in the possession of King Azoun IV of Cormyr in the early 1360s [[DR]]."
