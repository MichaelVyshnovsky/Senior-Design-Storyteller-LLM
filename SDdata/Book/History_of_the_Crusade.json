        "mainbody": "History of the Crusade was a book written by the bard Thom Reaverson in the early 1360s DR. It gave a careful and unbiased account of King Azoun IVs crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR.\nFollowing the war, Thom Reaverson wrote History of the Crusade while in Suzail, Cormyr, at the kings request. At the time, he provided translations and guidance for Koja of Khazari, who was a guest of Azoun in Suzail for over a year and who, also at the kings request, wrote up an account of his experiences with the Tuigan. Koja felt History of the Crusade was a more complete account of the war than his own.As Thom and Koja worked together in Suzail, and the two books are bound together, it seems likely that Thom also wrote History of the Crusade for King Azoun.\nOne copy was in the possession of King Azoun IV of Cormyr in the early 1360s DR."
