Nightmare Keep is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module for the Forgotten Realms.
Nightmare Keep is set within the Veilstone Peaks, located to the northwest of Cormyr, approximately  west of the Farsea Marshes. This narrative unfolds subsequent to the Time of Troubles and follows the demise of the deity Bane.
Icelia, a member of the Witches of Rashemen, harbored ambitions to expand her control across the globe. Currently in exile, her unquenchable thirst for power has transformed her into a demilich. Within the confines of her concealed tower, Icelia has cultivated an army of horrors, poised to be unleashed imminently.
The player characters are convened by Balko Verdemeer, a delegate of King Azoun IV of Cormyr, following the discovery of a malevolent, unusual insect near the Veilstone Peaks, alongside the disfigured remains of a man and a horse. King Azoun IV commissions the party to ascertain the existence of additional such insects and to eradicate them, offering substantial rewards in gold and land. No adventurer tasked with this quest has returned from the Peaks thus far.
In their investigation, the party traverses the impoverished settlements surrounding the Veilstone Peaks, where they encounter whispers of the benevolent sorcerer Amry Wolover and the nearby fortress known as Wolovers Keep, from which Wolover has been conspicuously absent. Their exploration leads them to the tower, where they confront various monsters and encounter an enigmatic orange mist in the subterranean levels.
Their journey takes them to a vast cavern characterized by serrated walls and inhabited by bats. A stone bridge spans over an underground lake, and as they navigate this somber maze, the fate of some who ventured before them becomes apparent.
Pushing further into the depths, the party discovers the remnants of other ill-fated adventurers and encounters a haughty survivor, who reluctantly exchanges information. This section of the labyrinth, permeated with the stench of decay and inhabited by hostile insects, oozes, shadows, and the undead, gradually reveals the malevolent intentions of Icelia and her method of executing them.
In the labyrinths deepest level, the party enters the colossal, petrified remains of an enormous creature, its interior a network of ducts and organs filled with bizarre fluids. Here, they encounter the tormented spirit of Amry Wolover, who unveils the full extent of Icelias atrocities and the genesis of her blasphemous legion. The culminating challenge faces the party against the demilich Icelia and her spectral ally Zhorach.
