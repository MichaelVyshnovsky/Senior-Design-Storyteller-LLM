        "mainbody": "'''''Darkness over Daggerford''''' was a book that recounted the events of [[1372 DR]] in the city of [[Daggerford]] and the activities of the [[Hero of Daggerord]]. It was compiled using the first-hand account of an adventuring band known as the [[Dukes of Daggerford]].",
        "Contents": "In Daggerford, the autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1372}} became known as the Darkness over Daggerford. That period of time was filled with grim events that could've led to the demise of the city. Like so much of the strife that plagued [[Faerûn]], the Darkness was brought on by the [[Zhentarim]]. The crisis was triggered by the perceived death of Duke [[Pwyll Greatshout]] and an attempt by the Black Network to install a puppet onto the city's throne. The events of that fall culminated in Daggerford's ancient enemy, [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]] leading an assault and bracing the walls of the city.\n\nUltimately, the city was saved by a brave hero only known as the Hero of Daggerord and his companions, [[Raegen Brunegar]] and [[Purfbin Doogrick]]. The Hero's tale and account of his deeds were gleefully provided by a band of adventurers who participated in the battle for Daggerford – the Dukes of Daggerford. The Dukes claimed that the Hero and his companions solved numerous crises that arose in the city and lands that surrounded it, including the [[Trollbark Forest]] and the [[Crab's Claw Coast]], as well as delved into the depths of ancient [[Illefarn]].\n\nIn the end, Pwyll Daggerford, along with his sister, were found alive and held prisoners by the Zhentarim and returned to their rightful position of rulership.",
        "History": "Copies of the ''Darkness over Daggerford'' circulated in the region of the [[Moonsea]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, during the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis and the blockade of [[Zhentil Keep]]."
