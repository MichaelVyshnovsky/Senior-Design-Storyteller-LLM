'''''Volo's Complete Guide to the Behaviour of Nymphs''''' was an unfinished manuscript penned by [[Volothamp Geddarm]], available in the late 14{{th}}

{{quote|''I must congratulate you on your impeccable taste in acquiring this volume – clearly, you have an eye for quality, even if you are somehow not familiar with the name Volothamp Geddarm. Though it has been some since I delivered to you my last guide (fault entirely lies with my old friend and editor Elminster, who deemed my ''Complete Guide to the Behaviour of Nymphs'' "too naughty" for print), I feel this tale you hold before you now perhaps my most important work yet.''|Excerpt from ''Volo's Complete Guide to the Behaviour of Nymphs''.}}

==Description==
The book was a hand-written manuscript in a blue binding decorated with a silver frame. The handwriting was a swinging scrawl.

==Contents==

Volo's manuscript detailed behaviors and activities of [[nymph]]s in extreme detail. The book was marked and annotated in red [[ink]] by Volo's editor, [[Elminster]]. Some parts of the manuscript were completely crossed out. The inner cover of the book had comments written in two distinct handwritings. The editor's response to the book simply said "Absolutely not!" and signed with a single letter "E". Volo's response to Elminster read "Dearest Elminster, While you may lack imagination, nymphs, I assure you, do not. Nor does the public that eagerly awaits this work. I will refrain from publishing this piece for now, but only that I may conduct a more extensive bout of research."

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], a copy of the manuscript could be found discarded by Volo in the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].

Even though ''Volo's Complete Guide to the Behaviour of Nymphs'' was never published under Volothamp Geddarm's name, a version of the book was privately published as a chapbook under the pen name of "Valhalaeria the Vaunted." ''Nymphs in Need (of My Embraces)'' found popularity among discerning clients of chapbook merchants of Volo's morals and tastes.
