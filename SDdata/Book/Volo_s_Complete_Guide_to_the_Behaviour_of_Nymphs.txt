The book was a hand-written manuscript in a blue binding decorated with a silver frame. The handwriting was a swinging scrawl.

Volos manuscript detailed behaviors and activities of nymphs in extreme detail. The book was marked and annotated in red ink by Volos editor, Elminster. Some parts of the manuscript were completely crossed out. The inner cover of the book had comments written in two distinct handwritings. The editors response to the book simply said "Absolutely not!" and signed with a single letter "E". Volos response to Elminster read "Dearest Elminster, While you may lack imagination, nymphs, I assure you, do not. Nor does the public that eagerly awaits this work. I will refrain from publishing this piece for now, but only that I may conduct a more extensive bout of research."
In 1492 DR, a copy of the manuscript could be found discarded by Volo in the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands.
Even though Volos Complete Guide to the Behaviour of Nymphs was never published under Volothamp Geddarms name, a version of the book was privately published as a chapbook under the pen name of "Valhalaeria the Vaunted." Nymphs in Need (of My Embraces) found popularity among discerning clients of chapbook merchants of Volos morals and tastes.
