My pack is gone, but by Selûne's hand I survive. By her will, I carry its ancient history in my heart. On this day dedicated to the honored dead, I begin my secret record. Bright Lady of Night, grant me the years to finish it.\n|The opening of the book.\n}}": "=Description==",

I have known your bright faces: joy, strength, and wisdom.

Taking the name [[Asha the Silent]], she joined the clergy of [[Moonshadow Hall]] and began writing the tome on the [[Feast of the Moon]] that same year.

        "Description": "The book was a slim tome with a black leather cover, bearing no title but decorated with a [[silver]] inlay that was tarnished with age. The design bore the phases of the [[moon]] in a vertical strip down the middle, with a full moon at the top of the cover, followed by a gibbous moon, half-moon, and crescent moon, ending with a hair-thin silver outline of a new moon in the center that remained untarnished. The book was protected by preservation magic that prevented the cover symbol and the pages within from falling victim to decay. The pages inside were filled with a cramped, heavy script by Asha's hand.",
