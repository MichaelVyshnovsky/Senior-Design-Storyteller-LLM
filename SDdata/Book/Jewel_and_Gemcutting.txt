Jewel and Gemcutting was a trade book detailing a number of trade secrets regarding the art of cutting and setting precious gems.
Copies of this book were bound within copper covers.
A copy of this book was generally worth around 250 gold pieces, though jewlers and thieves guilds would pay someone twice that amount for one.
Copies of this tome were owned by the Jewelers Guild of Waterdeep. Some time before the early-14 century DR, the guild donated one of these to Bard Keep, a library and temple of Oghma that stood within the North near Silverymoon.
