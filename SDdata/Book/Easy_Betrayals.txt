'''''Easy Betrayals''''' by [[Richard Baker]] is the eighth novella in the [[Double Diamond Triangle Saga]] series.

{{Quote|''A mixed company of paladins and mercenaries race back to [[Faerûn]] after the object of their quest is revealed as a threat to peace and order throughout the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]]. But beware! The evil will lead them on a chase that ends in the last place any of them expected.''}}

==Summary==
While battle against the [[Fallen Temple]] raged in [[Doegan]], pirates [[Belgin Dree]], and [[Nargin Olnblade|Nargin "Rings" Olnblade]], along with paladins [[Jacob]] and [[Miltiades]] pursued the [[greater doppelganger]] in the guise of [[Eidola Boareskyr]]. The warriors pursued her to an ancient crypt deep under the palace of Emperor [[Aetheric III]]. In the heat of battle, ancient [[Netherese]] glyphs sprang to life and opened a ''[[gate]]'' through which Eidola escaped. The mercenaries and paladins had no other choice and followed.

The group found themselves in dust-swept Netherese ruins of [[Ularith]] in the desert of [[Anauroch]]. Belgin's training in the arcane revealed the origins of the ancient temple – the center of death cult worship with numerous portals that led to hidden tombs across [[Faerûn]], [[Utter East]], [[Chessenta]], and more. The warriors chased the cunning doppelganger across the temple complex, eventually being confronted by its [[lich-lord]] protector. Miltiades stood up to the undead sentry but was protected from its deathly magics via Miltiades's own, somewhat undead nature. The paladins were given time until the sunrise to find Eidola and leave.

Tracking the shapeshifter and surviving several encounters with undead guardians, Eidola's deceptions, paladins, and mercenaries discovered the ''gate'' she escaped through – into [[Undermountain]]. Miltiades and Belgin Dree followed. Jacob and Rings eventually reached the gate. Jacob revealed his doppelganger nature, replaced when the paladins traveled through [[Skullport]], the "human" stabbed the pirate and left him to die in the desert.

Eventually, the paladins and mercenaries reached Skullport once again. They came across a familiar face, [[Aleena Paladinstar]], who was investigating the shapeshifter plot against her father. She revealed that Blackstaff [[Khelben Arunsun‎]] knew of Eidola's nature sometime after the doppelganger consumed the young woman and took her shape. To render her harmless, Aleena and Blackstaff created a powerful ''[[girdle of righteousness]]'' that clocked the greater doppelganger into Eidola's body and personality. Along with survivors, Aleena traveled to a seedy bar [[Broken Pike]]. Its proprietor was a known agent of the [[Unseen]], and he was likely to know where to find the organization's safe house and Eidola herself. In the process, Aleena and Miltiades were able to cure Belgin Dree of the gravely accursed disease that was killing him like everyone in the Utter East – a curse of the ''[[bloodforge]]s''.

Later, the group was ambushed by a gang of doppelgangers wearing familiar faces and led by [[Jacob]]. In a bloody scuffle, the shapeshifter almost got the upper hand but were saved by Nargin "Rings" Olnblade's magic axe. The dwarf was left to die, but with a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'' pierced onto his face, he survived and came back for vengeance. With Jacob's death, his betrayal and replacement became known to all.

After the heroes reached the safehouse of the Unseen, they fought through its doppelganger defenders and faced Eidola once again. They chased the monster into a maze of ancient tunnels underneath and cornered her. Eidola revealed the reason for Piergeiron Paladinson's condition after the bride's abduction – a ''[[soul gem]]''. She threatened to shatter it, destroying the Open Lord's soul unless the warriors left and allowed her to escape. Miltiades refused, and the doppelganger started chanting the spell to trap the paladin's soul in the ''gem''; however, Belgin's throwing knife interfered. The spell failed, and Eidola's own soul was consumed by the magic gemstone.
