According to "The Candlekeep Collection" article, ''Volo's Guide to Waterdeep'' was written over 1363–1365 DR. It is unknown when it was published, but since ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)|City of Splendors]]'' mentions the event and is set in 1368 DR, it must be in 1365–1368 DR, likely earlier. This suggests ''Once Around the Realms'' is set c. 1372 DR or later; assuming "seven years" is a rough estimate and it should be in the 2{{nd}}-edition era, one may presume [[1371 DR]]. ''However'', the novel also mentions the in-universe ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'' as being "upcoming", and it was written over 1367–1368 DR, while the novel is a series of cameos and visits of contemporary Realms storylines. Ergo, "seven years" seems unsupportable or is based on a much earlier writing by Volo. To further complicate the issue, the "Prologue" and "Epilogue" framing story of ''[[Realms of Magic]]'' follows ''Once Around the Realms'' but "Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction" dates it to 1366 DR.

'''''Once Around the Realms''''' is a stand-alone novel by [[Brian Thomsen]].

{{quote|''[[Volothamp Geddarm]] ("Volo" to his public), traveler, author, renaissance man of the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]], has been known to brag on occasion, and to bet even more often.  So when a discussion, as to who is the greatest traveler in the Realms takes place in his presence, of course he is going to defend his hard-won reputation, no matter what the consequences.''

''Soon Volo and his erstwhile companion, [[Passepout]], are on a grand tour the likes [[Toril]] has never seen.  From [[Chult]] to [[Kara-Tur|Kara Tur]], from [[Suzail]] to the [[Shining South]], even from the [[Land of the Dead]] to [[Maztica]], Volo and Passepout make their way around the globe... little suspecting that this simple bet masks a dark conspiracy unlike any other.''}}
==Summary==
[[Volothamp Geddarm]] is tricked into accepting a bet by [[Hlaavin]] to travel around the world, dropping off necromancer gems to mark his progress. Hlaavin hopes to use the gems to create a teleportation network to expand the [[Unseen]], his [[Doppelganger]] network. Volo sets out with [[Passepout]], a thief/actor he met in [[Suzail]]. They pick up Curtis, a young [[Cormyr|Cormyrian]] noble, in [[Khaerbaal]], and rescue Shurleen Laduce, a servant of the heiress to Lord Bleth of the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]] from a [[Tuigan]] tribe. They mistake Shurleen for the heiress, and she and Curtis fall in love. Eventually, Hlaavin kidnaps Volo and reveals his plan. The companions rescue him, and they hasten to Suzail, informing [[Khelben Arunsun]] and [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana|Vangerdahast]] of the plot. The wizards modify the gems so that they only teleport to one destination: a gem dropped inside a volcano.

==Publication History==
''Once around the Realms'' was an attempt by [[TSR]]'s fiction department to have other authors write for characters created by and associated with freelance authors. Although all work submitted by freelancers was done under a work-for-hire contract and therefore belonged to TSR, if the ownership of the characters was ever challenged in court, having a novel written using those characters by a TSR employee (Thomsen was TSR's Managing Editor for fiction) would put TSR in a much better position to defend its intellectual property rights and thereby make it easier to assign a new author to certain characters.
