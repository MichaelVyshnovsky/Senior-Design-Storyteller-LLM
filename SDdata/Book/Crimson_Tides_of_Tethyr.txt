The '''''Crimson Tides of Tethyr''''' was a history [[book]] that recounted the events of the [[Bloody Fall]] of [[Tethyr]] that transpired ''circa'' autumn of  [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
The book was a somewhat vague and incomplete historical record of a very recent conflict in Tethyr at the time of the book's publishing. The events of the Bloody Fall started with the [[ogre mage]] warlord [[Sythillis]] leading his army of [[humanoid]]s south - into [[human]]-occupied lands of the kingdom of Tethyr. The reasonings behind the attack were still uncertain as scholars from [[Candlekeep]] and [[Shadowdale]] were still directing the transpired events as of [[1373 DR]]. Whatever the oni's motivation was, he started a war with Tethyr, a brief conflict that cost many lives of the defenders of the realm. The conflict's resolution came to pass in the [[elven]] city of [[Suldanessellar]] where Sythillis clashed with an unnamed hero in a fierce battle around the fall of 1372 DR.

The book explored several theories of what exactly caused the conflict. The most prevalent one blamed treachery within the leadership of the [[Crimson Guard]], a renowned mercenary company that served Queen [[Zaranda Star]]. The company was charged with defending Tethyr. Some sages speculated that the organization intentionally stoked the fires of the conflict to gain power or control of the kingdom of Tethyr. Other historians claimed that the treachery and manipulation were done by a [[malaugrym]] of the [[Unseen]]. Why it was done, however, was unknown to sages.

Bloody Fall's name was given to the conflict due to thousands of lives lost in the brief conflict of 1372 DR. The accords of the unnamed hero's deeds remained shrouded by rumors and exaggerations. Still, many believed that apart from defeating Sythillis, the hero also overcame slavers, defeated an imprisoned [[titan]], and fought through a horde of [[kobold]]s and [[ogre]]s during the battle of Suldanessellar. The hero disappeared from the public eye following the war, so the first-hand witness testimony of the events was hard to find.

==History==
These books were put to print quite quickly following the conflict to their contents were not as compete as many would've preferred. By 1373 DR, copies of the ''Crimson Tides of Tethyr'' could be found in all major cities of the [[Moonsea]] region.
