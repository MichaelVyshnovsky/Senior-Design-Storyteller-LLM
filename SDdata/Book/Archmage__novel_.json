        "mainbody": "Archmage by R.A. Salvatore is the first book of the Homecoming series, which follows the Companions Codex series.\nThe story opens in the Abyss, where Lolth taunts the demon lord Balor, the chief rival of the demon lord Errtu. Lolth finally turns on Balor and traps him in her web.\nIn Menzoberranzan, Archmage Gromph Baenre reveals the end of the War of the Silver Marches and the dispelling of the Darkening to Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre. Quenthel meditates on the solution to her spectacular failure on the surface. She sees a vision of Menzoberranzan in its early days, when demons roamed the streets. She believes it to be a vision brought to her by Lolth to solve her problems and bring chaos to the city—and thus security to her position. She begins summoning innumerable demons to the city, who cause chaos and destruction wherever they go. \nOn the surface, Dark Arrow Keep is dismantled and Lorgru and the orcs of Many-Arrows are banished into the Spine of the World by the combined forces of the three dwarven kingdoms, the elves of the Glimmerwood, and the humans of the Silver Marches. Bruenor Battlehammer immediately sets his eye on recapturing Gauntlgrym (with Drizzt DoUrden and Catti-brie, of course). Jarlaxle offers Athrogate and Ambergris as agents of Bregan Daerthe and fellow dwarves willing to aid in the struggle. Regis, however, doesnt plan to join him. He departs, with Wulfgar beside him, for Aglarond to join his love, Donnola Topolino.\nIn QXorlarrin, Matron Zeerith QXorlarrin and Tsabrak Xorlarrin summon the corpses of fallen House Xorlarrin soldiers in order to court the favor of Lolth. They discover that the Darkening has been dispelled and believe the house may have lost the favor of Lolth, or that other houses may believe so and try to take advantage.\nGromphs wife, Minolin Fey Baenre, approaches Gromph once again with the idea of releasing Kyorl Odran from the Abyss in order to destroy Quenthel. Gromph sends Kimmuriel Oblodra to Byrtyn Fey, who in turn sends him to the Abyss to speak with Kyorl directly. Kyorl imparts to him a spell that will summon a gate powerful enough to allow her to enter the Prime Material Plane. Kimmuriel is to impart the spell to Gromph without his active awareness, so that he will weaken the barrier between the planes so that Menzoberranzan will know chaos as never before. This is according to Lolths plan she has conceived with Errtu.\nIn Mithral Hall at the end of the year, Bruenor begins to finalize his plans to march on Gauntlgrym. King Connerad Brawnanvil steps down as king in order to join him, appointing Dagnabbet as his successor. When it is officially announced in Alturiak, King Emerus Warcrown also steps down as leader of Citadel Felbarr in order to join Bruenor, appointing Parson Glaive as his successor.\nMeanwhile, Gromph visits with the white wyrm Arauthator, who reveals that Tiago Baenre may yet be alive.  Unbeknownst to them, Doumwielle Armgo has teamed up with Tiago in a quest to exact revenge on Drizzt for killing her father, and both are present when Bruenors army marches from Mithral Hall on the first day of spring. They follow the army as it passes through Mirabar, gaining a thousand dwarf soldiers, and rests in Longsaddle, leaving much later with wizards in tow, including Penelope and Kipper Harpell. The army passes by Neverwinter, issuing a warning and threat that they will be taking over Gauntlgrym.\nThe Ruling Council of Menzoberranzan realizes that Quenthel has the favor of Lolth. However, they can no longer abide to have so many demons causing chaos on the streets. Malagdorl Armgo, weapons master of House Barrison DelArmgo, wears the armor and hairstyle of Uthegentel DelArmgo as he defeats Marilith in a show of power for his House. However, unbeknownst to all of Menzoberranzan, Marilith allowed herself to be defeated only at the order of Lolth. Later, House Barrison DelArmgo and its allies assault House DoUrden in an attempt to kill the hated Matron Darthiir, Dahlia Sinfelle. The force fails.\nIn Menzoberranzan, Gromphs daughter, Yvonnel Baenre II (who bears the memories of Gromphs mother, Yvonnel the Eternal) plots to gain power using her mother, Minolin Fey Baenre, who would like nothing more than to kill Yvonnel. Yvonnel wants to use Minolin to court the favor of Byrtyn Fey and others in Menzoberranzan. Meanwhile, Gromph meditates on his studies with Kimmuriel and discovers a way to combine psionics with gate magic and resummons Marilith, who by his understanding should be banished from the plane. His success convinces him of the greatness of his inspirations, which in reality will allow demons to walk free unbidden. At Quenthels bidding, Gromph also sends a messenger to place a gem of tracking on Doumwielle so she and Tiago can easily be located. Unbeknownst to Gromph, Kimmuriel can use this gem to track both Doumwielle (for Jarlaxle and Bregan Daerthe) and Gromph (for himself).\nThe dwarven army reaches Gauntlgrym with Tiago and Doumwielle following behind. The army sets up defenses in the entry hall and undergo the Rite of Fealty in which each dwarf sits on the Throne of the Dwarf Gods and pledges fealty to his or her king and kin. Their first battle comes against clever kobolds who use the magma of the trapped fire primordial against them. Fortunately, Catti-bries magical ring of elemental power and her new staff of the magi enable her to know how to use the primordial power in her favor and the kobolds are forced to retreat.\nTiago and Doumwielle wait patiently for Drizzt to go out scouting alone, then trap Guenhwyvar in a stone chamber so that she cannot aid her master. Tiago finally faces his decades-long of dream defeating Drizzt DoUrden. However, during the heated battle, Doumwielle and her sentient sword, Khazidhea, get to it first. She wounds Tiago and deals a savage blow to Drizzt, leaving him for dead. Suddenly, she and Tiago and snatched by Gromphs spell Doumwielle is magically cast out and left on the snowy peaks of the Spine of the World and her sword is given to Jarlaxle to wield. Jarlaxle uses his wand of goo to attach Drizzt to the wall, sealing his wounds and temporarily sparing his life. There Bruenor and his party find him and take him back to the dwarven encampment, where he lays comatose. \nWith Bruenor mourning over the grievous injury to his friend, Connerad leads the first dwarven assault into the lower levels. Using the magic of four Harpell cousins, the dwarves descend to the lower levels but are quickly overcome. A hundred dwarves are killed, including Connerad, the former king, in what would come to be known as the Battle of the Under Way. At the same time, demons enter the entry cavern through the pond and are defeated in the Battle of the Cavern. Demons also attack Bruenor and his party in the Battle of the Mines, leaving Tannabritches Fellhammer sorely wounded. \nAfter the battles are waged, the dwarves regroup with a new plan to take the lower levels. All appears to be going well until Marilith and Nalfeshnee, the generals of the demon army, appear. It is only then that Drizzt and Guenhwyvar appear in a psionic vortex, having been awoken and given strength by Jarlaxle and Kimmuriel in order to defeat the two strongest demons. The tides eventually turn and the drow of House Xorlarrin retreat. As the leaders of the dwarves return to the primordial chamber, they find Zeerith QXorlarrin there, who gives her terms of surrender, promising that her house will not return in hundred years and offering three prisoners Kenneally and Tuckernuck Harpell and Stokely Silverstream. As she does so, Gromph runs out of the chamber across the primordials pit. He has weakened the walls of Faerzress and unintentionally summoned Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons, back at his tower in Menzoberranzan. Catti-brie uses her contact with the primordial to destroy the chamber, closing the conduit between Menzoberranzan and Gauntlgrym even as Demogorgon leaves a path of destruction through the drow city.\nWhen the chaos in Gauntlgrym dies down, the deceased Connerad is given the honor of being proclaimed the first king of Gauntlgrym. Emerus is proclaimed the second king of Gauntlgrym and dies shortly afterwards, leaving Bruenor as the third and living king of Gauntlgrym. We see snippets of events afterwards Catti-brie leaves the dwarven citadel, bound for Longsaddle, with a plan in mind to use Gromph to restore the magic of the primordials weakening prison. Meanwhile, Jarlaxle plots to use the situation in his home city to his advantage, telling Zeerith that he will bring Drizzt DoUrden to the matron mothers of Menzoberranzan.\nDrizzt DoUrden • Bruenor Battlehammer • Gromph Baenre • Catti-brie\nAmbergris • Athrogate • Bilwhr • Bungalow Thump • Connerad Brawnanvil • Dahlia Sinfelle • Doumwielle Armgo • Emerus Warcrown • Errtu • Faelas Xorlarrin • Guenhwyvar • Harnoth • Jaemas Xorlarrin • Jarlaxle • Kenneally Harpell • Kimmuriel Oblodra • Kipper Harpell  • Kyorl Odran • Lolth • Maegera (unnamed) • Malagdorl Armgo • Mallabritches Fellhammer • Marilith • MezBarris Armgo • Minolin Fey Baenre • Nalfeshnee • Oretheo Spikes • Penelope Harpell • Quenthel Baenre • Ragged Dain • Regis • SosUmptu Baenre • Tannabritches Fellhammer • Tiago DoUrden • Toliver Harpell • Tsabrak Xorlarrin • Tuckernuck Harpell • Wulfgar • Yvonnel Baenre II • Zeerith QXorlarrin\nAfafrenfere • Aleina Brightlance • Andahar • Arauthator • Balor • Beniago • Byrtyn Fey • Carrinda Castleduck • Dagnabbet • Dagult Neverember • Demogorgon • Devastul • Dwadermey Xorlarrin • Hengredda of Starshine • Hominy Pestler • Hoshtar Xorlarrin • Ilnezhara • Jelvus Grinch • Juiblex (unnamed) • Kiriy Xorlarrin • Lorgru • Mandarina Dobberbright • Mizri Mizzrym • Nigel Thunderstorm • Ogden Nugget • Parson Glaive • Ravel Xorlarrin • Sabine • Saribel Xorlarrin • Sinnafein • Stokely Silverstream • Taayrul Armgo  • Tazmikella • Terondarg DelArmgo • Thibbledorf Pwent • Toivo Ironbelt • Turvendi • Vadalma Tlabbar • Zhindia Melarn\nAishapra • Artemis Entreri • Aurbangras • Banak Brawnanvil • Baphomet • Berellip Xorlarrin • Bidderdoo Harpell • Bromm • Clangeddin • Dagna • Dagnabbit • Dantrag Baenre • Donnola Topolino • Dumathoin • Effron • Elastul • Elminster • Fimmel Orelson • Grazzt • Harkle Harpell • Hartusk • Hoshtar Xorlarrin • Innovindil • Jack the Gnome • Jearth Xorlarrin • Kavita • Khelben Arunsun • Kostchtchie • Methil El-Viddenvelp • Mielikki • Moradin • Mystra • Nanfoodle • Niraj • Obould • Shingles McRuff • Shoudra Stargleam • Stokely Silverstream • Sunrise • Sunset • Szass Tam • Teirflin Armgo • Tiamat • Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker • Tosun Armgo • Yvonnel Baenre\nPlanes of existence\nAbyss • Prime Material Plane (Toril)\nRealms \nAnauroch • Kingdom of Many-Arrows • Netheril • Silver Marches • Underdark (Upperdark, Lowerdark)\nSettlements\nCitadel Felbarr • Dark Arrow Keep • Gauntlgrym • Longsaddle • Luskan • Mirabar • Neverwinter • QXorlarrin • Mithral Hall\nBuildings and landmarks\nArach-Tinilith • Braeryn • House Baenre • House Barrison DelArmgo • House DoUrden • Illusk • Ivy Mansion • Narbondel • One-Eye Jax • Quellarzorl • Sorcere • Surbrin Bridge • Tier Breche\nGeography\nCrags • Fourthpeak • River Surbrin • Spine of the World\nMentioned locations\nPlanes of existence\nAstral Plane • Elemental Plane of Water • Elemental Plane of Water • Iruladoon • Nine Hells\nRealms \nAglarond • Bloodstone Lands • Cormyr • Delzoun\nSettlements\nBryn Shander • Citadel Adbar • Delthuntle • Everlund • Nesmé • Port Llast • Procampur • Shining White • Silverymoon • Sundabar • Suzail • Ten Towns • Ten Towns • Waterdeep\nBuildings and landmarks\nClawrift • Fane of the Goddess • Narbondellyn • Surbrin Bridge\nGeography\nGarumns Gorge • Icewind Dale • Keepers Dale • Kelvins Cairn • Maer Dualdon • Moonwood/Glimmerwood\nRoads\nTrade Way\nbar-lgura • balor • carrion crawler • chasme • copper dragon • demon • demon • drow • dwarf • elf • fire elemental • fish • frost giant • glabrezu • goblin • goristro • halfling • human • jade spider • kobold • magma elemental • mane • marilith • nalfeshnee • orc • primordial • rothé • shadow demon • spider • vrock • water elemental • werewolf • white dragon • worg • yochlol\nMentioned\ncat • crow • dire corby (unnamed) • dog • drider • frog • giant cave spider • illithid • myconid • newt • pegasus • pit fiend • succubus • svirfneblin • troll • umber hulk\nBregan Daerthe • Clan Battlehammer • Companions of the Hall • Gutbuster Brigade • Harpell • House Baenre • House Barrison DelArmgo • House DoUrden • House Mizzrym • House Xorlarrin • Knights in Silver • Wilddwarf Brigade\nMentioned\nCouncil of Sparkling Stones • Desai • Grinning Ponies • House Faen Tlabbar • House Fey-Branche • House Hunzrin • House Melarn • House Oblodra • House Vandree • Lords of Waterdeep • Neverwinter Guard\nbag of holding • Chacker and Whacker • Faerzress • Horn of Valhalla • Icingdeath • Khazidhea • Kozahs Needle • Orbbcress • Ring of elemental power • Robe of the Archmage • wand of viscous globs • Skullcracker • Staff of the magi • Taulmaril • Throne of the Dwarf Gods • Twinkle • Vidrinath\nBattle of the Cavern • Battle of the Mines • Battle of the Under Way • Darkening • Festival of Founding • Spellplague • Time of Troubles • Treaty of Garumns Gorge • Tyranny of Dragons • War of the Silver Marches\nCategoryNovels\nCategoryBooks\nCategoryPublished in 2015\nCategoryWorks by R.A.
