        "mainbody": "he Tome of the Creed Resolute was a magical book recording the Creed Resolute and the names of citizens of Elturel whod sworn an oath to follow it by 1494 DR.\nThe book was bound in leather. The first page displayed the text of the oath. The remaining pages were taken up the names of those whod sworn it, all in the same handwriting. New pages would appear as necessary to hold more names.\nElturian citizens who were old enough to read were required to put a hand on the Tome of the Creed Resolute and recite the oath, swearing to defend Elturel among other services. Once done, their name magically appeared in the book, thus recording all those whod sworn to follow the Creed.\nThe Tome of the Creed Resolute was kept at the High Halls cathedral in Elturel.\nAfter 1489 DR, High Overseer Thavius Kreeg made all Elturians swear to follow the Creed Resolute, making them oathbound to defend Elturel, but in the process binding the whole population to the city and to his deal with the archdevil Zariel, which included the citys \"oathbound defenders\". The names of those who swore the oath were recorded in the Tome of the Creed Resolute.In Sword Coast Adventurers Guide, the Creed Resolute was originally followed by the Order of the Companion, and later the Hellriders. Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus has all citizens sworn to follow the Creed Resolute. Assuming this is not a contradiction, it appears the Creed was instituted city-wide over 1489â€“1494 DR, perhaps as part of Kreegs plot to betray the city and its whole populace.\nWhen the High Hall was overrun by devils, an acolyte named Pherria Jynks took the Tome of the Creed Resolute from the cathedral down into the main crypts to safeguard it. There she waited with over a hundred other survivors until help came."
