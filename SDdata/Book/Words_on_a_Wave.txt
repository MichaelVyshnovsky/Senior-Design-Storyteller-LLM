Words on a Wave was a book written by Arthaeuil Nrensam, a priest of Umberlee and High Trident of the Onthalasp temple in the Nelanther Isles in the Year of the Roaring Tempest, 1016 DR. It was an autobiography and covered details of the Umberlant faith, but as such might be considered biased. It was written in two volumes.
Among other things, Arthaeuil wrote of the rites of the Green Priests at the Shell House in Ilyaport, Lapaliiya, and their use of the holy relic known as The Orglara.
The original was kept in the great fortress-library of Candlekeep around 1372 DR.
