'''''Words on a Wave''''' was a book written by [[Arthaeuil Nrensam]], a priest of [[Umberlee]] and High Trident of the [[Onthalasp]] temple in the [[Nelanther Isles]] in the [[1016 DR|Year of the Roaring Tempest, 1016 DR]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}} It was an autobiography and covered details of the Umberlant faith, but as such might be considered biased. It was written in two volumes.

Among other things, Arthaeuil wrote of the rites of the [[Green Priests]] at the [[Shell House]] in [[Ilyaport]], [[Lapaliiya]], and their use of the holy relic known as ''[[The Orglara]]''.

The original was kept in the great fortress-library of [[Candlekeep]] around [[1372 DR]].
