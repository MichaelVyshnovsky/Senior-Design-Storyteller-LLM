The '''''Lore of the Bladesingers''''' was a tome of knowledge about the [[elf|elven]] blade-wielding [[mage]]s from the [[Hand of the Seldarine]], penned by [[McComb]] and [[Pryor]], before the stronghold's fall centuries before [[1281 DR]].

==Content==
The tome was dedicated to the [[bladesinger]]s—elven [[fighter]] mages, who spent their lives defending their lands and peoples. Bladesingers were known to leave secluded elven retreats and hidden homes, venturing into the wider world to defend the Fair Folk who lived around other races.

The ''Lore of the Bladesingers'' called the bladesingers terrifying weapons experts and spellcasters commonly found on [[Evermeet]]. There, bladesingers were organized in warrior lodges that counted only a handful of individuals, each trained to wield different weapons. These warrior mages embodied ancient elven ways in close combat and magic and used ancient martial styles, wore ancient ceremonial garb, and used blades of great antiquity and beautiful craftsmanship. Many bladesingers [[tattoo]]ed their skin with old elvish runes and arcane symbols.

==History==
The ''Lore of the Bladesingers'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' the {{Yearlink|900}} and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By the {{Yearlink|1281}}, the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the tome's copies could be found in the citadel's library, which was curated by [[Custhantos]], along with other rare books.
