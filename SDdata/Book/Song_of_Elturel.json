        "mainbody": "A Song of Elturel was a ballad about the city of Elturel in the latter part of the 15 century DR.The title of the song is unknown, so A Song of Elturel is taken from the first line. It is unclear if this is meant to be an existing song or if it was invented by the spirit of the Elfsong Tavern in 1494 DR.\nIt was sung in Elvish by the ghostly elf spirit of the Elfsong Tavern in Baldurs Gate in the , after the descent of Elturel into Avernus. Notably, this was the only time it was heard to change its tune."
