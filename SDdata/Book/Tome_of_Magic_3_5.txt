Tome of Magic is devoted to new forms and styles of magic as a path to power and presents three magical systems pact magic, shadow magic, and truename magic. These new paths are embodied in three new alternate base classes. The book is arranged into three sections, one for each of the new character classes and their unique take on magic. Each chapter includes several feats, prestige classes, magic items and monsters associated with that style of magic.
