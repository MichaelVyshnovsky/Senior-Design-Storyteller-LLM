        "mainbody": "The '''''Third Imaskarcana''''' was one of the ''[[Imaskarcana|Seven Imaskarcana]]'', said to be one of the most powerful items ever created by the [[Imaskari artificer|Artificers]] of [[Imaskar]]. Like the others, it stored the lore of the Imaskari empire.<ref>",
        "Description": "The ''Third Imaskarcana'' was a great tome bound in slate covers, lined in the [[dragonhide|hide]] of a [[blue dragon]], with pages of ragged [[vellum]], crystal magically given the flexibility of [[paper]] without its weaknesses, and even the skins of [[humans]], [[elves]], and [[tanar'ri]].",
        "Powers": "The ''Third Imaskarcana'' could not be read, and instead would answer questions posed to it once per day, as per a ''[[commune]]'' spell. It provided its wielder with a certain resistance to spells in general and it could be commanded to employ a small number of extremely powerful spells: ''[[dominate monster]]'', ''[[meteor swarm]]'', ''[[time stop]]'', and ''[[imprisonment]]''. However, the command had to be spoken in [[Roushoum]]; a command in a different language prompted the item to transform its wearer into another of its fine vellum pages, that was reversible only by magic on the level of a ''[[wish]]''.",
        "History": "The ''Third Imaskarcana'' was created on the orders of Lord [[Omanond]] in {{yearlink|-3891}}. It may have been the fabled tome of the ''Imaskarcana'' that [[Yuvaraj|Lord Yuvaraj]] wielded during his battle against [[Horus-Re|Horus]] in {{yearlink|-2488}}, when he was slain. In the year {{yearlink|-2487}}, refugees from Imaskar took the ''Third Imaskarcana'' with them as they headed for the Underdark. Though one of the ''[[Imaskarcana]]'' was preserved in [[Deep Imaskar]] as of {{yearlink|1372}},",
