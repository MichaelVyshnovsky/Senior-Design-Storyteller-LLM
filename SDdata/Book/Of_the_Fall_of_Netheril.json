I wonder how, much else of the history we hold to be true is twisted thus?|Rhaugilath, \"the Ageless\"\n}}\n'''''Of the Fall of Netheril''''' was a book written by [[Rhaugilath|Rhaugilath the Ageless]], also known as the Shackled Scribe of Larloch, a [[Netherese]] [[archlich]] dwelling at [[Warlock's Crypt]].\n\nThe book detailed [[Netheril]]'s complete [[history of Netheril|history]]. However, Rhaugilath considered the [[Netherese Diaspora]] after Netheril's fall to be an integral part of the history, as well as the expected restoration of Netheril, thought to be only beginning in [[1374 DR]]. Thus, ''Of the Fall of Netheril'' was never likely to be finished, though it had reached several volumes by that time.\n\n[[Larloch]] reviewed each chapter as it was completed, and they were delivered to [[Candlekeep]] to be archived in the library there.\n\nIn one passage, Rhaugilath discussed the [[phaerimm]], the formation of the [[Anauroch]], and history's perception of Netheril. The book also provided important information about the mysterious [[Terraseer]] and mentioned the castle of [[Spellgard]]."
