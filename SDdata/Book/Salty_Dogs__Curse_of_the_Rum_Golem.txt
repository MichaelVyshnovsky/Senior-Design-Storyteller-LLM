Salty Dogs Curse of the Rum Golem was an adventure novel penned sometime before the late 15 century DR.
In the , a copy of Salty Dogs Curse of the Rum Golem managed to captivate and exhilarate a stuck-up sage from Candlekeep, teacher of Nansi Gretta, the proprietor of The Bibliophile in the city of Baldurs Gate. During Nansis time studying at the fortress library, she was a proponent of preserving copies of adventure novels at Candlekeep, to her teachers opposition. Years later, a copy of Salty Dogs ended up the only thing to read on the teachers long carriage drive, and he found himself absorbed by the adventure so much that he invited Nansi Gretta to Candlekeep to have dinner there and discuss a possible scholarly paper on the topic of pulpy adventure novels.
