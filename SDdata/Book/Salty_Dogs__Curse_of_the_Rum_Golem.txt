'''''Salty Dogs: Curse of the Rum Golem''''' was an adventure novel penned sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Salty Dogs: Curse of the Rum Golem'' managed to captivate and exhilarate a stuck-up [[sage]] from [[Candlekeep]], teacher of [[Nansi Gretta]], the proprietor of [[The Bibliophile]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. During Nansi's time studying at the fortress library, she was a proponent of preserving copies of adventure novels at Candlekeep, to her teacher's opposition. Years later, a copy of ''Salty Dogs'' ended up the only thing to read on the teacher's long carriage drive, and he found himself absorbed by the adventure so much that he invited Nansi Gretta to Candlekeep to have dinner there and discuss a possible scholarly paper on the topic of pulpy adventure novels.
