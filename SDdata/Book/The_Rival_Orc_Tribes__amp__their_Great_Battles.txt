The Rival Orc Tribes & their Great Battles was a historic account of the orcs arrival to Toril, written and published before the Wailing Death crisis of 1372 DR.
The Rival Orc Tribes & their Great Battles told the history of the Mulhorandi wizards opening magic gates into the world of orcs. That subsequently led to an invasion that was known as the Orcgate Wars during which the Mulhorand and Unther pantheons fought the orcish goods. The Orcgate Wars led to multiple divine deaths and facilitated the god Gilgeams almost two-thousand-year tyranny of Unther.
Copies of the Rival Orc Tribes & their Great Battles book could be found around the areas of Neverwinter, Daggerford, and the Sword Coast North  circa 1372 DR.
