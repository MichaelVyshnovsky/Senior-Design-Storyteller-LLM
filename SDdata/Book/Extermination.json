        "mainbody": "Extermination is an adventure module by Stephen Radney-MacFarland set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting using the 3.5-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules and designed for the RPGAs Legacy of the Green Regent campaign. It was released in 2003 and has interior art by David Esbrí and maps by Dorwin Cooper. Intended for four or five 1-level characters, it has the player-characters intervene in a goblinoid bandit attack and pursue them to their base to eliminate them and avenge their victims, and learn of a new threat to the Grayvale. In its appendices, it introduces the lightning rat monster and rafting mechanics, and details the city of Loudwater and village of Shining Falls.\nthumb|left|\"No! No! You damned goblin bastard, keep that away from me!\" Blaz Merrymar being tortured by the goblins.\nThe adventure opens with the PCs on the road between Loudwater and Shining Falls near Tanglefork Woods, in early Eleasis of the , when theyre alerted to goblinoid bandits torturing a halfling merchant. They most likely intervene, defeat the bandits, and rescue Blaz Merrymar, who angrily implores them to search for whoever is behind the attack and destroy them all to avenge his sons and nephews, who had previously been murdered by the bandits.\nBy some means, whether by tracking the goblins or meeting the grig prince Feythrin, the PCs follow the goblinoids through the forest and downriver to their hidden base in a river-side cave. On the way, they deal with traps, goblin bandits, and monstrous creatures, and finally face Hekkut the Molted, a wererat mage. Clues found reveal Hekkut serves the Hark, a local bandit king, and an Underdark connection.\nThe module offers several variations and alternative outcomes to its plot, but the official recap based on the results of actual play has a newly formed group of PCs rescue Blaz, miss meeting Feythrin (though he follows them), and defeat the gang, though Hekkut escapes (though he would not appear in future modules).\nthumb|right|Hekkut the Molted, hobgoblin wererat wizard.\n •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  () •  •  •  ( •  • ) •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  () •  •  •  •  •  • \nthumb|right|250px|A map of the local area.\nLandmarks  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSettlements  • \n  •  •  • \nRegions  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  • \nWeapons & Shields\n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nArmor\n  •  • \nTools\n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMagic items\n  •  • \n  •  •  •  • \nDeities\n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMagic\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPlants  •  •  •  •  • \nOther  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •"
