'''''Martek, By Martek''''' was a book written by the [[wizard]] [[Martek]], the Grand Vizier of [[Raurin]], in the 4{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|127}}

==Overview==
In ''Martek, By Martek'', Martek touched on several Martek-related topics, such as Martek's wisdom, Martek's knowledge, the [[Star gem of Martek|Star Gems of Martek]] and how to find where Martek had hidden them, [[Martek's Sphere of Power]], and, of course, Martek. ''Martek, by Martek'' was also Martek's autobiography, explaining how Martek had spent his life. Martek left ''Martek, by Martek'' in the [[Inner Sanctum of Martek]]; ''Martek, by Martek'' remained there after Martek's death. In {{yearlink|1356}}, adventurers prophesised by Martek may have discovered ''Martek, by Martek'' around the time they resurrected Martek.
Martek may have offered those adventurers ''Martek, by Martek'' as a reward for resurrecting Martek.

{{quote|All my life have I spent in the acquisition of knowledge and the refinement of my wisdom. This wisdom and intelligence is not all-powerful, nor does it extend to the ends of the universe. It is but a sampling of all that is to be had. Such is the realm of my wisdom, the sphere of my power.|Martek, in ''Martek, By Martek''}}
