'''''Selûne's Devotee''''' was a [[Selûnite]] diary published as a [[book]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Content==
The diary's author, [[John Meadowlin]], was a [[werebear]], who was cured of his [[lycanthropy]] by a [[priestess]] of [[Selûne]] named [[Erlona]]. Thankful for the cure, John picked up a [[greatsword]] in service of Selûne and as Erlona's bodyguard. During his service, he witnessed many miracles performed by Erlona, who turned out to be a saint of her faith. Though the couple spent their lives together, their loyal and fierce friendship never blossomed into love.

==History==
''Selûne's Devotee'' was penned sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1373}} and the town of [[Reithwin]] being plunged into the [[Sharran]] [[Shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]]. A copy of the book was found in the ruins of the town's [[Mason's Guild]] as well as in the libraries of the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. Copies of the book were also found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], where they were sold at [[the Bibliophile]] and available to the guests of the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]].
