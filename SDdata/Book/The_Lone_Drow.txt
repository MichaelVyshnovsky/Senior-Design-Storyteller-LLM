The Lone Drow is the second book in The Hunters Blade Trilogy by R.A. Salvatore. 
The Lone Drow starts with the orc chieftain Obould Many-Arrows addressing his followers. He wishes to destroy the dwarves of Mithral Hall. Drizzt in the meantime thinks only about one thing, the fact that he saw an entire tower of stone fall upon his friends, Catti-brie, Bruenor, Regis and Wulfgar. They are, unbeknownst to him, still alive, but he blames the orcs and goes into a wild frenzy in which he becomes a feared hunter and killer. Tarathiel and Innovindel try to engage Drizzt to learn the fate of their female companion, Ellifain. Later the orc shaman Arganth Snarrl proclaims Obould a god. In a special ceremony, Obould is confronted by both a large mountain cat and a bull to prove that he is as strong as Snarrl had claimed, with Gruumsh on his side. If Snarrl had been mistaken, and Obould had not been able to break the cats back and turn the bulls head around, Obould would have, as he claimed, staked Snarrl to a wall and eaten him alive. Obould sends his son to war in order to tire the forces of Clan Battlehammer.
