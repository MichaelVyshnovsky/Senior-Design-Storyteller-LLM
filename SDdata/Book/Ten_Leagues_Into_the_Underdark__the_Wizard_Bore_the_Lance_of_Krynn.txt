==Contents==
According to Elminster, the ballad was written about a true adventure of the Old Mage. However, the most notable takeaway from the ballad, apart from its fine melody that Elminster liked, was the ''[[Lance of Krynn]]'s'' weight. The weapon was so heavy, Elminster's hat was soaked in sweat just one league into the [[Underdark]].
