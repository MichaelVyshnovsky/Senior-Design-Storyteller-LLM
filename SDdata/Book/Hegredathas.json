However, Silifrey was rumored to practice dark magic and Iirikoss elven friends warned and pleaded with him not to. Ignoring them, leaving them bewildered by his choice, Iirikos built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned elementals. But he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed."
