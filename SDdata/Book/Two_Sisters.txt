'''''Two Sisters''''' was a short poem composed by [[Veseene|Veseene the Lark]] about the goddesses [[Shar]] and [[Selûne]].

==Contents==
The narrative poem was composed of four stanzas—three quatrains and an ending couplet. It followed a broken [[wikipedia:Anapest|anapest]] tetrameter rhythm.

The tale described the birth of the two sisters, their battle, and the creation of [[Mystryl]]. The following is a translation of the second stanza:
: ''At the dawn of the world, two sisters contest''<br />
: ''Over dark, over light, over life, over death.''<br />
: ''Shar seeks the void and with shadows coalesced''<br />
: ''Snuffs Selûne's bright lights and with them her breath!''<br />

==History==
The ballad was presented to [[Dhauna Myritar]], high [[priest]]ess of [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]], [[Sembia]], in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}.
