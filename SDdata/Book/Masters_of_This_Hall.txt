Masters of This Hall was a popular book of drama and wordplay in the Heartlands of the Realms.
The book told the tale of an aged king who died with six warlike and rival sons vying for the throne. Arriving to stake their claim, the princes are forestalled by the high priests of the realm gathered in the throne room, and having used their divine magic to prevent swords and arrows from being used. The ambitious princes are thus given an ultimatum they must each use their rhetoric to persuade the collected priests that they are the most worthy of being king, and must swear fealty to the chosen king before leaving, else be slain by the priests spells. As such, the book was largely made up of well-written back-and-forths between the various princes and priests as they debate, boast, argue, interrogate, and generally word-fence at each other.
The book was already very old and considered a classic by the 14 century DR, and underwent a great many reprintings and new editions, sometimes with amendments by those who thought they could improve on the original. It was considered a good source for witticisms, and was frequently quoted by its readers.
