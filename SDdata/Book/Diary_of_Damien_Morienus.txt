The Diary of Damien Morienus was the journal of necromancer Damien Morienus, former Overwizard of the Host Tower of the Arcane.
It was a black leather-clad old book with an embroidered "M" on its cover, which stood for the name of the diarys owner. The diary was old but readable, after spending a century in the dark and damp underground. The book was about  by , and  in thickness.
The Diary of Damien Morienus was written in an arcane script that could be deciphered by a magic-user or read using a read magic spell.
The diary itself contained copious notes and theories on the nature of life and death, the necromancers research into the power of lichdom, formulas, spells, and recipes. Most importantly, the diary contained an incomplete recipe for a magic potion that would, if the research was finished, turn the drinker into a lich.
The Diary of Damien Morienus was the bounty sought after by evil wizards of the Host Tower of the Arcane Celerum the Black and Kaladar the Cruel in 1369 DR.
The Diary was still in Damiens possession circa 1269 DR when the Accursed Tower of the necromancer was swallowed by the mud of the Great Thaw. The inhabitants of the tower perished and were raised as undead because of the curse of one of Myrkuls clerics. Damien himself was transformed into a crypt thing who was clutching the diary when a group of adventurers discovered the tower in search of the diary.
