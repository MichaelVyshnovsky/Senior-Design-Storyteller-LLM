        "mainbody": "The Lay of the Purple Dragons was a ballad about King Azoun IVs crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR.\nThe Lay embellished the historical account for added heroism, adding extra dragons, knights, and magic. At one point, even the gods appear before King Azoun to bless his crusade.\nThe bard Talamic sang the Lay of the Purple Dragons at the Griffins Claw in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the . A young scribe at the Temple of Deneir in Procampur preferred it to the more accurate A History of the Tuigan he was working on, prompting its author, Koja, to attempt to have his own work mass-published to counter the Lay and other populist versions of the war."
