Disorders of the Nerves and Mind A Treatise was a medical book that detailed various psychological and neurological ailments, their diagnoses, and related treatment plans, penned by the cleric-physician named Glenne Earl Mack.
One case study included in Disorders of the Nerves and Mind shared the story of a woman, nicknamed "R," who was troubled by her husband, nicknamed "B," and his temper. According to the woman, just three months earlier, "B" was afflicted by restless dreams and night sweats. The husband screamed in his sleep about bearing the "mark of chaos." Two months before the physicians visit, "B" began calling himself Sarveok. And just a month before, "B" became obsessed with the throne he claimed he was destined to sit upon.
Glenne Earl Mack paid the couples farmhouse a visit and met "B." The man simply sat at the farmers table, holding a book close to his chest. Being a cleric as well as a physician, Glenne detected no possession, no magical influences, nor curse. When the cleric illuminated the afflicted mans face with her candle, "B" cried out, brandishing the book "The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise!" The cleric managed to grab the book and tossed it into the farmhouses hearth. To the clerics surprise, the tome burst into black flames and burned into ash. The book left behind nothing but a small scrap of paper that read "He foresaw his coming death and seeded his essence across the land."
With the book gone, "B" seemingly woke from a nightmare but had no memories of the tome nor claiming to be Sarevok. In the aftermath of the incident, Glenne Earl Mack diagnosed "B" with an unspecified neurotic enthrallment and prescribed him a suspension of garlic and drace to be taken orally twice per day.
