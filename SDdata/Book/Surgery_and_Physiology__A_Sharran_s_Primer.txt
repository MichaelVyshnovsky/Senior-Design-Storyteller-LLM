'''''Surgery and Physiology: A Sharran's Primer''''' was a medical [[book|textbook]] written through the prism of the [[Sharran]] faith, sometime before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Content==
''Surgery and Physiology'' was a hand-written tome penned by the Sharran surgeon [[Malus Thorm]] of [[Reithwin]]. The book's pages were immaculately clean and neat, written in precise penmanship. The book's medical studies were speckled with dark aphorisms and philosophies of the Lady of Loss, alongside detailed diagrams and, anatomical drawings and directions. Eventually, Thorm's book concluded that the true mastery of surgical art came with sacrifice. Once the master surgeon had nothing else to teach them, he should lay under the scalpels of his Sisters to lead them to surgical skill mastery.
