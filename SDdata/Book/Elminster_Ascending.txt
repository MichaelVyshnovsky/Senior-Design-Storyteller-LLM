'''Behind Every Legend is a Truth'''

Beloved of the goddess, heir to untold magic, Elminster Aumar, the Sage of Shadowdale, is the most powerful wizard Faerûn has ever known.

'''Behind Every Hero is a Man'''

But he was not born that way. Magic and valor did not come easily. Young Elminster fought first for survival, and second for vengeance. Heroism was never part of the plan.

'''Behind Every Victory is a Sacrifice'''

Until his whole world is destroyed by an angry magelord, whose wanton cruelty sparks the formation of one of the greatest heroes ever known and changes the future of the Realms forever.|Back-cover text}}
