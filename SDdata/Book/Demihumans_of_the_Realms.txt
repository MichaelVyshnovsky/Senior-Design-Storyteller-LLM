'''''Demihumans of the Realms''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|''Is your FORGOTTEN REALMS character an [[elf]]? A [[dwarf]]? Maybe a [[gnome]]? Perhaps, yet that doesn't really say much does it? One might just as easily say there's no difference between a [[Calishite]] and a [[Thayan]] because they're both humans! No one is ''just'' a demihuman in the Realms - there are acrobats, barbarians, giant killers, manhunters, pestkillers, prospectors, and even tunnelrats, but they're all demihumans and they all walk the face of Faer√ªn.''

''Within these pages are dozens of kits designed to help players in a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign enrich their characters and make them truly native to the Realms. Special benefits and disadvantages for each kit enhance the roleplaying experience while allowing characters to reflect their social roots and racial heritages. This companion to ''[[Wizards and Rogues of the Realms]]'' and ''[[Warriors and Priests of the Realms]]'' completes the series of kit-based sourcebooks for the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign.''}}
