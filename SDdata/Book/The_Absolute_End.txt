'''''The Absolute End''''' was a [[book]] about the dangers the [[Cult of the Absolute]] posed, printed sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
This well-intentioned but hastily penned tome about the Absolute rightfully stoked fear of the new dangerous religion that worshiped the [[Absolute]]. However, the book's author conflated the cult's rise to prominence with other dire and possibly apocalyptic events, such as the ''[[resurrection]]'' of the [[lich]] [[Vecna]], overabundant use of dark [[necromancy]] magics, and the heat death of the universe, and even managed to somehow connect the Absolute to the withering of fruits imported from [[Chult]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''The Absolute End'' could be found in the city of Baldur's Gate, among the books belonging to Lady [[Firelia Jannath]] in her [[Lower City]] estate.
