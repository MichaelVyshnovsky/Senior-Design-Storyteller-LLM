Perils We Should Beware was a chapbook released anonymously during the Spellplague era that discussed various types of threats that plagued Faerûn. Its author was unknown to the public, having chosen to remain anonymous.
Perils We Should Beware was most notable for coining the term "Slithering Cults" &ndash that being, cults dedicated to the worship of oozes and slimes &ndash which it asserted was chief amongst the threats facing Faerûn at that time. It was widely circulated along trade routes during the Spellplague era, leading to the term "Slithering Cults" to enter common Faerûnian parlance.
