''Perils We Should Beware'' was most notable for coining the term "Slithering Cults" &ndash; that being, cults dedicated to the worship of [[ooze]]s and [[slime]]s &ndash; which it asserted was chief amongst the threats facing Faerûn at that time. It was widely circulated along trade routes during the Spellplague era, leading to the term "Slithering Cults" to enter common Faerûnian parlance.
