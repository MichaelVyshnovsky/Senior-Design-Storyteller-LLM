        "mainbody": "Lady Zuggis Primer of Basic Heraldry, including appendices on Charges, Countercharges, and Trends of Modern Times was an amazingly boring tome that contained rules of etiquette and the rules of navigating the court games of the Blade Kingdoms nobility, authored by Lady Zuggi sometime before 1217 DR.\nThe thick and exhaustingly boring tome included such riveting chapters as \"Charges Dovetail and Counter Dovetail and Their Acute Relevance to Social Graces\" and \"The Improper Use of Propers\".\nIn 1217 DR, Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria used a magical spell to record herself reading the dreadful book out loud into a small box that would replay the recording when opened. She replayed the many chapters of Lady Zuggis Primer of Basic Heraldry, including appendices on Charges, Countercharges, and Trends of Modern Times to fool her step mother while the Princess spent her time researching and translating a much more compelling tome of arcane magicsâ€”Lady Faverettis Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners)."
