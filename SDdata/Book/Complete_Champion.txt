{{Quote|'''''Divine Power at Your Command '''''

''Mastery of divine power is no longer reserved for the cleric or paladin. With devotion and dedication, any hero can become a divine champion and a force to shake the heavens. Your strength comes from the universe itself, and you can use your divine gifts to create, heal, or destroy. Your choices shape the world.''
 
''This book gives players and Dungeon Masters an unprecedented resource for using divine power and religion in their game. In addition to new feats, spells, items, and prestige classes, the Complete Champion game supplement presents exciting adventure locations, afilliation mechanics for different deities and organizations, and a system for designing your own religions based on the cleric domain system. Alternative class features for every standard class and more reserve feats provide extended options for players interested in creating or advancing characters along the road to divine power.''
 
''For use with these Dungeons & Dragons core books: Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, Monster Manual. ''}}

==Description==
It focuses on the divine champion archetype and provides new rules options for characters who enjoy battling for a cause, defeating foes using divine power, and going on quests that mean more than simply defeating the bad guy and grabbing the treasure. This book also helps Dungeon Masters run quest-themed campaigns and adventures.

In addition to providing various archetypes for characters, Complete Champion includes new feats and prestige classes. The book features dozens of [[deity]] and belief-themed organizations, turning religion and holy (or unholy) power into something characters of all classes can use. For the Dungeon Master, this book contains information on constructing and running quests and holy missions. It assists the DM in helping all characters in the party to pursue divine paths simultaneously.
