}}'''''Curse of the Shadowmage''''' is a novel by [[Mark Anthony]] and the eleventh book in [[The Harpers series]].

{{quote|''Long ago, the [[shadow magic]] transformed an ancient [[wizard]] into a being of utter evil, the [[Shadowking]].  Now legendary [[Harper]] [[Caledan Caldorien]]—heir to the shadow magic—has mysteriously vanished.''

''The Harpers mount a mission to find and destroy... Caledan.''

''But renegade Harper [[Mari Al'maren]] and the mage [[Morhion Gen'dahar|Morhion]] embark on a desperate quest to rescue him, and stop Caledan before the Shadowking stalks the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]] once more!''}}

== Summary ==
A series of mysterious murders rocks [[Iriaebor]]. Through the testimony of a thief named Kadian, ghosts of Talek Talembar and Kera, and the presence of shadow creatures in a [[Zhentarim]] hideout, [[Mari Al'maren]] and [[Morhion Gen'dahar]] learn that [[Caledan Caldorien]] is the direct descendant of both Talek Talembar and [[Verraketh Talembar|Verraketh]], and that he is becoming the Shadowking, having committed the murders against his will. 

[[Belhuar Thantarth]] orders Mari to kill Caledan and sends a hunter, K’Shar, after him when Mari refuses and is branded a renegade. By promising his body to Serafi, Morhion learns of the Shadowstar, the artifact that Verraketh discovered that originally created the shadow magic, and its potential to reverse the transformation, and that it is owned by a thief named Stiletto. 

Mari and Morhion set out to track Caledan to Stiletto along with Kellen and the thieves [[Jewel Talondim]] ([[Ferret Talondim|Ferret]]’s grandmother) and [[Cormik]], who are hoping to sell Stiletto’s location to the many guilds losing money to them. They find Caledan has killed some [[Gibberling|gibberlings]], and are hunted by [[Shadevar]], find the witch [[Isela]] in the forgotten city of Talis in the [[Reaching Woods]], and find Stiletto, who turns out to be Ferret (having survived being locked in the Crypt of the Shadowking), in [[Soubar]], although Caledan steals the Shadowstar. 

Ferret trades places with Jewel and Cormik and the adventurers set out for the [[High Moor]], once home to Varraketh’s kingdom of Ebenfar, where Caledan will sit on the shadowking’s throne and become the shadowking. They learn that the shadevari are actually powerful entities sealed away and the Shadowstar is the key to their prison. They use the primordial magic Valesong to kill the shadowking and save Caledan. K’shar has a change of heart and sacrifices his life to open a door. Caledan uses the last of his shadow magic to banish Serafi to the Abyss, and Kellen recovers the Shadowstar
