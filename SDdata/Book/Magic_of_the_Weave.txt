Magic of the Weave was an academic work that described the nature of the Weave, its association with magic, historical events, and other phenomena.
The introduction to Magic of the Weave outlined the nature of the Weave, describing it as an "essential element" of existence that allowed individuals to access various forms of magic. It was not magic itself, but a tapestry of substance that could be manipulated by spellcasters.
It discussed  the different ways in which casters could access the Weave, through inherent connections formed at birth, years of study and practice, or deals for power made with entities beyond Toril.
This chapter of the book shared how Mystra, the goddess of magic, was herself the Weave. 
As of the , there remained a copy of Magic of the Weave in the libraries of the Emerald Grove.
