        "Contents": "''Uncovering Umgatlik'' was a collection of drafts, manuscripts, and sketches, some of which were done in [[charcoal]]. The work was compiled by a hapless Savant [[Gumbril]], who signed his manuscript as Savant Gumbril the Great.",
        "History": "Savant Gumbril discovered lore about what he thought was a long lost god of the ancient [[Netheril]] empire. He assembled a team and, eventually, uncovered [[Umgatlik's shrine]], buried within the deadly cliffs of the [[Crab's Claw Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. ''Uncovering Umgatlik'' was what Savant Gumbril titled his notes and copies of writings and arcane symbols collected from within the lost crypt. As of 1372 DR, the research remained unpublished. The book's future remained unclear, possibly due to Gumbril's rumored death or the research being discredited or even abandoned."
