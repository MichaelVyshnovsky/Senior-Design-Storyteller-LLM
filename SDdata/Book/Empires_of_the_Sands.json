It details the Lands of Intrigue Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr.\nEmpires of the Sands is a 64-page booklet, which is wrapped in a removable cover, includes a one page introduction, explaining that this book covers three major areas of in the southwest corner of the continent of Faerûn known as the Empires of the Sands Amn (pages 3–20), Tethyr (pages 21–47), and Calimshan (pages 48–62). Each of the nations located along the southern coast of the Sea of Swords, an area with a warm climate and large areas of dry, inhospitable land, receives its own section, and each section begins with a general description including the races present, followed by information covering their languages, social customs, monsters, history, government and politics, religions, geography and climate, trade, cities, places of interest, and important characters.\nMost cities receive only a column of text on the average, with some descriptions consisting of just noting what each city is renowned for, its exports, population, government, and location. The center of the booklet is taken up with one blank character sheet, seven character sheets filled in with the statistics for the Company of Eight from Tethyr, and reduced maps of the area. The last page, page 64, features an index to the book. The book also includes two maps which match the edges of the maps in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set. The pair of fold-out color poster maps depict the three countries at a scale of 30 miles to the inch, making them compatible with other maps in the series.\n*Introduction\n* Amn\n**General Description\n**Languages\n**Social Customs\n**Monsters\n**History\n**Government and Politics\n**Religion\n**Geography and Climate\n**Money and Commerce\n**Cities\n**Places of Interest\n**Characters\n* Tethyr\n**General Description\n**Languages\n**Social Customs\n**Monsters\n**History\n**Government and Politics\n**Religion\n**Geography and Climate\n**Money and Commerce\n**Cities\n**Places of Interest\n**Characters\n* Calimshan\n**General Description\n**Languages\n**Social Customs\n**Monsters\n**History\n**Government and Politics\n**Religion\n**Geography and Climate\n**Money and Commerce\n**Cities\n**Places of Interest\n**Characters\n* Index\n* Pull-out Section\nAlso included is a pull-out map section (middle two pages form a double-sided map of the region) seven complete character record sheets and one blank record sheet\n* 32\" x 21\" map of Calimshan from the Singing Rocks and Teshburl to Theymarsh and Saradush\n* 32\" x 21\" map of Amn and Tethyr from the Sea Tower of Irphong to Ithmong to Impresk Lake to Priapurl to Beregost\nArkaneus Silvermane • Lawantha Silendia • Manfred Arbustle • Marilyn Haresdown  • Paddy Stoutfellow • Sylvanus Moondrop • Tardeth Llanistaph • \n •  •  •  () •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  ( •  • ) •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  ( •  •  •  •  •  •  • ) •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  () •  •  () •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nBuildings\nTemples\nSettlements \nCriminal Organizations \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nFood & Drinks\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems  • \nLanguages  •  •  •  • \nMaterials  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPlants  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nProfessions  • \nSubstances \nVessels  • \nWeapons \nEmpires of the Sands Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Design Scott Haring\n* Editing Karen S.
