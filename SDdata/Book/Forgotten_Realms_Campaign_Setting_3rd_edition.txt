This is the third-edition release of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons and a number of changes were made since the previous books were published by the former TSR, Inc. The most important update was to incorporate the significant revisions to the game system with the 3-edition update. Various regional feats, character attributes, prestige classes, spells, and NPC statistics all used the new rule set.
The work also made some notable updates to the campaign setting, including the widespread presence of Red Wizard enclaves in various cities, the presence of a mysterious group called the Shadovar in the southern Anauroch desert, and the increasing surface presence of drow in the Dalelands. The setting history was updated to reflect the various major events, such as the changes to the Faerûnian pantheon since the Time of Troubles and the defeat of the Tuigan Horde.
The book was organized into nine chapters, covering in broad detail the campaign setting. The primary emphasis was on the continent of Faerûn, and the other continents of Toril were only briefly mentioned.
In addition to the nine chapters, this work includes two short adventures and a number of maps, including a fold-out map of the continent of Faerûn. There are also many sidebar topics and tables.
