        "mainbody": "The Sarkonagael, also known as Secrets of the Shadewrights, was a spellbook of shadow magic likely written by the mage Sarkon.No author is given for the Sarkonagael rather, this is presumed from its shared name with the spell Sarkons umbral simulacrum.\nThe tome was bound in black leather and had a silver skull on the cover. Interior pages were black and had silver lettering that could only be read in pitch darkness.\nThe Sarkonagael contained dozens of shadow magic spells of varying levels. The book was considered especially dangerous because it contained the spell Sarkons umbral simulacrum, which allowed a shadow mage to create a doppelganger of a person from shadowstuff.\n* Of Nethermancy and Umbral Magicks\n* Adumbrations and Dismissals\n* The Seven Darks of Murghm√∂\n* Abjurations, Enchantments, and Conjurations\n* Sarkons umbral simulacrum\n* The most excellent incantation of shadow-walking\nIn the , the rogue Jack Ravenwild recovered the tome in an attempt to keep it out of Myrkyssa Jelans hands. The book disappeared from the record for over 100 years only to reappear in the  when a mysterious source offered a large reward for its return. Jack recovered the book from Sarbreen but cut the pages with the umbral simulacrum spell out of the book."
