        "mainbody": "The Tome of Blasphemous Magic was an evil spellbook that could be found in the Realms circa the mid-to-late 15 century DR.\nThe book espoused certain profane and sacrilegious statements as if they were factual, inherent truths. It contained the specifications for warped, necromantic rituals, and maligned iterations of certain oft-used spells.\nAside from its contents, the spellbook itself was truly a gruesome sight to behold. The dual covers of pressed bone held within them pages made of soft flesh, inscribed within which were words written in the blood of innocent souls.\nThe Tome of Blasphemous Magic allowed the reader to learn the following spells enervating grasp, orb of black flame, and withering tendrils.\nAny being that read from the tome had to endure its most horrific power the ability to destroy souls outright. Failure to withstand this effect left a reader transformed into a soulless corpse the spirit could only be restored by means of powerful magic or an act by a diving being.\nFor a time during the late 15 century, The Tome of Blasphemous Magic could be found within Ironaxe Halls.\n* Arvik Zaltos, who was loaned the book by none other than Szass Tam."
