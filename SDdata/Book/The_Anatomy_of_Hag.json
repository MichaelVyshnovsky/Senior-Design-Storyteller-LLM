        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Anatomy of Hag'' was studied by [[Mayrina]] after forming the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]], in search of ways to stop hags' sinister and malicious plots. The book's lore eventually helped Mayrina discover the recipe for ''[[hag's bane]]'' â€“ a concoction that could save the life of a child consumed by a hag. The crucial revelation was found in the book's 18{{th}} chapter. Some of the regain combinations tested by Mayrina during the research included failed mixtures of [[dragon egg mushroom]] with [[autumn crocus]], and [[crawler mucus]] with [[fibber's trumpet]] and [[melloweed]]. The combination of [[elmorin wings]] and [[whisperlight venom]] showed potential but was too unstable to be reliable."
