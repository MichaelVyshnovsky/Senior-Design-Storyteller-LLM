        "mainbody": "'''''Elder Evils''''' is an accessory by [[Robert J. Schwalb]] for the 3.5{{th}}-edition of the {{dnd}} ruleset and published in 2007. It adds new content for epic-level characters, in the form of extremely powerful, alien monstrosities intent on destroying the world and designed as a way of providing dungeon masters a means of ending a current campaign. It gives ideas for such campaigns and feats for villainous NPCs, and details nine [[elder evil]]s, together with statistics, NPCs, storylines, and suggested adaptations to the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting. While the content is not considered [[canon]], apart from Pandorym, it is included here for interest.\n{{quote|\n'''High-level threats for your campaign'''\n\nYour player characters stand on a precipice, the corpses of slain enemies all around them. Across a great expanse awaits the final threat—their ancient nemesis. What terror will you unleash upon them?\n\nThis supplement provides Dungeon Masters with truly wicked threats to challenge high-level adventurers. Each \"elder evil\" featured in this tome comes with a detailed description, statistics blocks for the elder evil and its minions, tips for how to incorporate the elder evil into any D&D campaign, adventure seeds, and maps of the elder evil's lair (complete with encounters and room descriptions). This book also provides guidelines to help DMs create their own unique elder evil as worthy campaign villains and endgame encounters.|Back-cover text}}",
