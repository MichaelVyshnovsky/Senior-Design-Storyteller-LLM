        "Description": "The history of the dark elves could only be generalised, due to the tendency of the drow to rewrite it.\n\nThe book was split into three main sections; in order, these were 'The Descent', 'The Dark Wars', and 'The Drow Today'. The first part detailed the \"descent of the drow\", where dark elves fled underground following a series of defeats against [[elves]], [[dwarves]], [[humans]], and others. The second part documented how drow began to fight against dwarves and among themselves, leading to the collapse of [[Bhaerynden]]'s ceiling. The final section detailed how drow acted centuries later.",
        "History": "The tome was written by the sage known as [[Shahaerynus]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was studied by [[Elminster]]'s apprentice, [[Susprina Arkhenneld]], who desired to write a sequel to the important historical document."
