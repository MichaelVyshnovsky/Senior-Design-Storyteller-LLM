        "mainbody": "Secrets of the Lamp is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set. It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.\nIn Secrets of the Lamp, Zakharas multitudes of djinn, jann, dao, efreeti, and the rest are for player characters to command. Its centerpiece is a detailed description of the famous genie City of Brass. This city, which floats on an endless lake of burning oil, is featured in a poster map and on story cards and monster sheets.[1]\nA lengthy scenario in the 32-page adventure booklet sends the PCs (levels 4–7) all over the City of Brass. An efreeti physician falls instantly in love with one of the heroes. The physician imprisons the party, and soon they run into trouble with his two current wives, his albino nightmare, patrolling salamanders, and the Sultan of the Efreet.\nThe 64-page Genie Lore book describes the Sevenfold Mazework of the Great Dismal Delve, the Court of Ice and Steel, the Great Padishah of the Marid, genie sorcerers, new magic, and the details of genie wishes.\nGenie Lore\n* Introduction Consorting With Genies\n* Chapter One Genie Courts and Rulers\n* Chapter Two Genies in Zakhara\n* Chapter Three Genies and Mortals\n* Chapter Four Genie Magic\n* Glossary\nAdventure Book\n* Introduction\n* Chapter 1 Hazim, the Fool\n* Chapter 2 By the Numbers\n* Chapter 3 In the City of Brass\n* Maps\n* Tables\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nConstructs\nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nRaces \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nClothing\n • \nShips\nStones & Shells\n •  •  •  • \nBodies of Water \nBuildings\nBusinesses\nCivic buildings\n • \nFortresses\n • \nResidences\n • \nSchools\nTemples\nCaverns \nCities \n • \nDungeons \nMountains \n • \nNeighborhoods \nPlanes \n •  •  •  • \nRegions \n •  • \nRoads  \nItems \nMiscellaneaous\n •  •  • \nSpells \nWeapons  \nClasses \n •  •  •  •  • \nDeities\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nEvents \nYears \nAdventuring Organizations \nGovernment Organizations \nGuilds \nMagical Organizations \nMilitary Organizations\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nReligious Organizations \nSchools \nSecrets of the Lamp Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nGenie Lore Cover.jpg|Genie Lore Cover\nGenie Lore\n* Written by Wolfgang Baur\n* Edited by Jon Pickens\n* Cover Art by Carol Heyer\n* Interior Art by Karl Waller\n* Cartography by David Sutherland III\n* Typesetting by Gaye OKeefe\n* Playtesting and Review by Michael Baum, Paula Hiller, Steven Kurtz, Rebecca Marchi, and Michael Marchi\n* Special Thanks to Tim Beach, Zeb Cook, Jeff Grubb, Shelly Nichols, and David Sutherland III\nAdventure Book\n* Written by Wolfgang Baur\n* Edited by Jon Pickens\n* Cover Art by Carol Heyer\n* Interior Art by Karl Waller\n* Art Coordination by Peggy Cooper\n* Graphics Coordination by Sarah Feggestad\n* Cartography by David Sutherland III and Cindy Felegy\n* Typesetting by Gaye OKeefe\n* Playtesting and Review by Michael Baum, Paula Hiller, Steven Kurtz, Rebecca Marchi, and Michael Marchi\n* Special Thanks to Tim Beach, Zeb Cook, Jeff Grubb, Shelly Nichols, and David Sutherland III"
