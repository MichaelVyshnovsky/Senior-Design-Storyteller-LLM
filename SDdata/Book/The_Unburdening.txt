'''''The Unburdening''''' was a [[book|textbook]] used to teach [[Sharran]] initiates the rituals of Unburdening and the Mapping of the Heart, printed sometime in or before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Content==
The ritual of Unburdening began with the agents of the Church of Shar identifying a person of interest amongst the people who sought the aid of the [[House of Grief]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Once the target paid the tithe to the temple, they were guided to partake in the Mapping of the Heart, a ritual performed by a ranking member of the clergy known as the Inquirer of Grief, who questioned the target verbally whilst performing a thorough mind-ream, searching every corner of their memory for anything that would be of use to [[Shar]]. Once the mind-ream and questioning were over, the target was guided into the depths of the [[Cloister of Sombre Embrace]] to face the ''[[Mirror of Loss]]''. While facing the mirror, the target was guided through the process with prompts from the Inquirer of Grief, giving up part of their memories to the [[artifact]]. The ''Mirror of Loss'' took the memories that the target sought to forget, which were memories of value to the church, and all knowledge of the rituals and the hidden Sharran cloister.

==History==
''The Unburdening'' was used by the acolytes of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace, hidden underneath the House of Grief in the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
