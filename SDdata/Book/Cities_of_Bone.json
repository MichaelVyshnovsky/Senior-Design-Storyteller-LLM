It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.\nThis boxed set includes six dungeon crawls, mostly portable anywhere in Zakhara, half for beginning characters and the rest for mid-to high levels. The text offers advice for creating a spooky atmosphere, and the historical reasons behind the construction of each dungeon. Half the text makes up the adventure, \"Court of the Necromancers\", where in the undead city of Ysawis, the player characters get involved in the intrigues of a couple of repugnant wizards and a senile lich. \nCampaign Guide\n* Chapter 1 Forbidding Tombs\n* Chapter 2 City of Eternity\n* Chapter 3 City of the Dead\n* Chapter 4 City of the Sun\nAdventure Book\n* Chapter 1 Suitable Donations\n* Chapter 2 The Treasure Pit\n* Chapter 3 The Genies Terror\n* Chapter 4 The Shattered Statue\n* Chapter 5 Court of the Necromancers\n* Chapter 6 Idolatry\nCities of Bone Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nCities of Bone Campaign Guide Cover.jpg|Campaign Guide Cover\n* Written by Steve Kurtz\n* Edited by Sue Weinlein\n* Project Coordination by Andria Hayday\n* Cover Art by Roger Loveless\n* Interior Art by Karl Waller\n* Cartography by David C.
