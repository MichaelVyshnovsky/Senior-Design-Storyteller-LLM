The party ventures into the tusker's former home to find out why, only to be attacked by [[drow]]! A [[treant]] then tasks them with saving a large number of [[fey]] who are being held hostage by the drow.\n\n{{quote|What would you do if the fate of another is in your hands, but you are being asked to do something foul? Do you give in to the demands of the villain or do you put the life of the hostage at risk? It is a question that I never had to answer, and if Mielikki is willing, I never will.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}",
