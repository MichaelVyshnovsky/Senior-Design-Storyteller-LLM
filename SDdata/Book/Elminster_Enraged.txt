{{quote|''Commanded by the vestige of [[Mystra]] to work together, [[Manshoon]] and [[Elminster]] engage instead in a ferocious battle that sends the Sage plummeting into the [[Underdark]] as a cloud of ashes. Elminster soon inhabits the body of a fallen [[drow|dark elf]], so that he can begin carrying out Mystra's orders to rally [[Cormyr]]'s [[War Wizards|Wizards of War]], seek [[blueflame ghost|blueflame]] items to mend immense rifts throughout the [[Realms]] that are releasing deadly monsters, and prevent the ancient [[primordial]]s from rising and unleashing their rage.''

''But his sworn archenemy, Manshoon, has plans as well: to conquer Cormyr and be the new emperor, and hunt down the Sage's clones. The battles are fierce, the stakes have never been higher, and the fate of Cormyr is on the line. Meanwhile, War Wizards are being mysteriously assassinated...''}}
