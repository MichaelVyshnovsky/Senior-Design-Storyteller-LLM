        "mainbody": "he True Life of Cyric was the unauthorized but highly accurate biography of Cyric, the mortal adventurer who ascended to godhood during the Time of Troubles in the mid–14 century DR.\nThe book was a written strong rebuke of the Cyricist faith, during what was perhaps the peak of its influence across the Realms. It was authored by Rinda of Zhentil Keep, a devoted scribe of Oghma and daughter of Bevis the Illuminator.\nThe opening chapter detailed Cyrics childhood, from his birth by a destitute prostitute of Zhentil Keep to his adoption by a wealthy Sembian mercantile family. It shared the story of how Cyric killed his adoptive parents when they failed to appease him. It ended with a passage about Cyrics ineptitude at surviving in the real world and outlined his return to Zhentil Keep as a slave.\nDuring its production, The True Life was protected by magical means so that its whereabouts could not be discerned by Cyric or his followers.\nThe True Life of Cyric was written and published committee of conspirators in the . This group included Fzoul Chembryl, the High Priest of Bane, General Vrakk of the Zhentilar, the books author Rinda, along with two deities that viewed Cyric as a grave threat against the Faerûnian pantheon, Oghma and Mask. When Cyric commissioned Rinda to pen the Cyrinishad―a magical tome that converted readers to the Cyricist faith―the group worked on The True Life in secret while Cyric schemed to consolidate power across Faerûn.\nAfter the Cyrinishad was completed, Cyric visited Rinda and Fzoul in Zhentil Keep to ensure his plot would be fulfilled. He ordered Fzoul to kill Rinda, and used her blood to make the Cyrinishad impervious to harm or alteration. Cyric revealed he was aware of their own scheme to write The True Life, but was unimpressed with the manuscript upon examining it for himself. After Cyric left Rinda dying and Fzoul to carry out his orders, Oghma and Mask intervened to preserve the copy of The True Life, save Rindas life, and shroud their actions from Cyrics eyes.\nIn the end, Fzoul Chembryl was forced to perform a public reading of the Cyrinishad before the people of Zhentil Keep in Cyrics temple. Zhentil Keep shortly thereafter, when it was invaded by an army of dragons and giants which Cyric had rallied to maintain his stranglehold over the Zhent people.\nSome time later in the , Cyric was forced to listen to a reading of The True Life at his trial by the Circle of Twelve Powers. This gracious act led to Cyric the Mad regaining some semblance of his sanity, and allowed him in part to retain his divine status."
