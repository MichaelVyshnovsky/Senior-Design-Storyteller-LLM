        "mainbody": "'''''The True Life of Cyric''''' was the unauthorized but highly accurate biography of [[Cyric]], the mortal adventurer who ascended to godhood during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|I, too, wish you to set down the story of Cyric's life, but I will tell you the truth. And with this true life of the Prince of Lies, we will show those who worship him just how deluded and dangerous he can be.|[[Oghma]], speaking to his faithful scribe [[Rinda]].}}",
        "Description": "{{Quote|Though men may try to wrest the reins of their destiny from the gods, they are all born at the mercy of Nature, bound in a hundred ways to those around them. This is how the gods insure mortals are tied to their world of toil and sorrow. Cyric of Zhentil Keep was no exception.|The opening line of ''The True Life of Cyric''.}}\n\nThe book was a written strong rebuke of the [[Cyricist]] faith, during what was perhaps the peak of its influence across the Realms. It was authored by [[Rinda]] of [[Zhentil Keep]], a devoted scribe of [[Oghma]] and daughter of [[Bevis]] the Illuminator.\n\nThe opening chapter detailed Cyric's childhood, from his birth by a destitute [[prostitute]] of Zhentil Keep to his adoption by a wealthy [[Sembia]]n mercantile family. It shared the story of how Cyric killed his adoptive parents when they failed to appease him. It ended with a passage about Cyric's ineptitude at surviving in the real world and outlined his return to Zhentil Keep as a slave.",
        "Powers": "During its production, ''The True Life'' was protected by magical means so that its whereabouts could not be discerned by Cyric or his followers.",
        "History": "{{Quote|In this, the Year of the Banner, the people of Zhentil Keep lost their true beliefs, and an army of monsters arose out of the wastes to punish them. Little did they suspect that their god had gathered this army together for the sole purpose of terrifying the Zhentish into slavery.|The ending of ''The True Life of Cyric''.}}\n\n''The True Life of Cyric'' was written and published committee of conspirators in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. This group included [[Fzoul Chembryl]], the High Priest of [[Bane]], General [[Vrakk]] of the [[Zhentilar]], the book's author [[Rinda]], along with two deities that viewed Cyric as a grave threat against the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], [[Oghma]] and [[Mask]]. When Cyric commissioned Rinda to pen the ''[[Cyrinishad]]''―a [[magic]]al tome that converted readers to the Cyricist faith―the group worked on ''The True Life'' in secret while Cyric schemed to consolidate power across [[Faerûn]].\n\nAfter the ''Cyrinishad'' was completed, Cyric visited Rinda and Fzoul in Zhentil Keep to ensure his plot would be fulfilled. He ordered Fzoul to kill Rinda, and used her blood to make the ''Cyrinishad'' impervious to harm or alteration. Cyric revealed he was aware of their own scheme to write ''The True Life'', but was unimpressed with the manuscript upon examining it for himself. After Cyric left Rinda dying and Fzoul to carry out his orders, Oghma and Mask intervened to preserve the copy of ''The True Life'', save Rinda's life, and shroud their actions from Cyric's eyes.\n\nIn the end, Fzoul Chembryl was forced to perform a public reading of the ''Cyrinishad'' before the people of Zhentil Keep in Cyric's temple. Zhentil Keep shortly thereafter, when it was invaded by an army of [[dragon]]s and [[giant]]s which Cyric had rallied to maintain his stranglehold over the Zhent people.\n\nSome time later in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Cyric was forced to listen to a reading of ''The True Life'' at his trial by the [[Circle of Twelve Powers]]. This gracious act led to Cyric the Mad regaining some semblance of his sanity, and allowed him in part to retain his divine status."
