        "mainbody": "The Siege by Troy Denning is the second novel in the Return of the Archwizards trilogy.\nIn an underground lake, Prince Escanor, one of the princes of Shade, and a group of shadovar are in the process of Splicing, creating part of a shadowshell, a magic shell that is intended to cut the phaerimm off from the weave. Galaeron Nihmedu and Vala Thorsdotter are also present. Galaeron notices some phaerimm are present, even thought they escaped Escanor’s notice, and the group defeats them, although Escanor is injured when Galaeron teleports a phaerimm nearby. They return to Shade along with Malik el Sami and Aris. Galaeron realizes he acted out of jealousy due to Escanor’s interest in Vala, and that his continued use of the Shadow Weave is affecting him. Telamont Tanthul takes note of this, and his prediction that the phaerimm would be present, and offers to teach Galaeron control.\nMeanwhile, in Waterdeep, the city is experiencing an extreme blizzard. Aglarel, another prince of Shade, is meeting with Piergeiron Paladinson and several Masked Lords, as well as elves from Evermeet and Evereska and Storm and Laeral Silverhand. Aglarel attempts to negotiate control over the efforts against the phaerimm despite Storm blaming the shadovar for Elminsters banishment to the Hells, but Piergieron is able to delay this by threatening to pull Waterdeep’s forces back if the shadovar take control.\nBack in Shade, Ruha arrives, but is prevented from arresting Malik. Elsewhere, Clariburnus and Brennus, princes of Shade, form an alliance with Malygris, a dracolich of the Cult of the Dragon. In Shade, Galaeron meets with Telamont, who brings out his shadow side by stoking his suspicions, and Galaeron finds he is able to predict the phaerimm tactics. Telamont reveals that Galaeron absorbed some knowledge from Melegaunt. He shows Galaeron that the shadovar are using shadow blankets to melt the High Ice as part of a plan to restore the climate of the Anauroch, causing extreme weather across Faerun. This angers Galaeron enough to bring out his shadow and prevent a phaerimm attack on Shade’s mythallar.\nGalaeron tries to persuade his friends to leave, realizing Telamont wants to use him, not teach him control, but Vala refuses, saying she must go with Escanor to battle the Myth Drannor phaerimm as she had previously promised, or else her absence will be noted. Elsewhere, Storm Silverhand’s relief army is attacked by a phaerimm force shortly before Malygris and a rage of dragons attacks. Piergieron calls a council to send emergency aid, but Aglarel arrives and reveals the dragons are allies sent to help Laeral. Brian the Swordmaster lays bare his suspicions of those who would involve themselves with the Cult of the Dragon and bear responsibility for Elminster’s banishment to hell, offending Aglarel, who withdraws from the city.\nGalaeron, Aris, and Ruha flee the city, while Malik stays behind and becomes an advisor to Telamont, and Vala goes with Escanor to Myth Drannor. Galaeron brings a shadow blanket, intending to prove the melting of the High Ice. In Evereska, the vale continues to decay, draining the mythal, but during a meeting witnessed by Keya Nihmedu, Khelben Arunsun makes contact with Laeral. \nGalaeron’s group is attacked by a dragon, and Galaeron, his shadow desperate for revenge against Shade, shows more care for the blanket, causing Aris to be injured. Horrified that he has caused his friend to be hurt, Galaeron swears off shadow magic. In Myth Drannor, Escanor makes romantic overtures to Vala, and when she does not immediately return them, sends her on a suicide mission, only willing to call her off if she agrees to be his consort. Laeral and her army arrive at Evereska. Vala makes contact with Corineus Drannaeken, a baelnorn, who helps her slay phaerimm.\nStorm, who had sent Ruha to Shade to spy on the shadovar, arrives and saves Aris, leading the group out of the desert. In Evereska, Keya has developed a relationship with Dexon, one of the Vaasan humans present there. The Evereskan defenders, Laeral’s relief army, and shadovari forces are able to drive away the phaerimm outside Evereska. Keya is able to wield a darksword in the battle, revealing that she is pregnant with Dexon’s child, as the darkswords are bound to specific families.\nGalaeron’s group arrives in Arabel, where they find the shadovar are already present and helping to rebuild the city. They meet with Alusair Obarskyr, Vangerdahast, and Myrmeen Lhal, presenting the shadow blanket as evidence of the melting of the High Ice, although Rivalen, a prince of Shade, is also present and demands they be returned to Shade as criminals. By pretending to imprison Galaeron’s group, Alusair tricks Rivalen into attacking the dungeons and revealing that Galaeron’s claims are true. She demands the the shadovar stop melting the High Ice.\nVala completes her impossible mission and returns to Shade, where Telamont is infuriated by Alusair’s demand to stop melting the High Ice. They imprison Vala and spread rumors of torture, hoping to draw out Galaeron. Armies from Sembia and the Dalelands gather in Tilverton, hoping to force Shade to stop melting the High Ice. The shadovari army outside Evereska retreats, allowing the Phaerimm to scatter Laeral’s army. \nRuha leads a Bedine raid on shadovari, along with Caladnei and a group of War Wizards, exposing a teleportation circle. This baits the shadovar into attacking Tilverton, which was part of Cormyr’s plan. Vangerdahast unleashes a magical device that destroys shades, but Rivalen is also present unleashing shadowstuff. The raw Weave and Shadow Weave energy mixes and destroys Tilverton, devastating both armies. Vangerdahast destroys Rivalen, but his mind doesn’t fully recover. Aris comments that the battle only had one winner the phaerimm."
