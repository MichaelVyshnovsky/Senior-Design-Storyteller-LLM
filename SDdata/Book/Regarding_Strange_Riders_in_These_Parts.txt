Regarding Strange Riders in These Parts was a document written by Damon Briska, regarding the overreach of the Hellriders of Elturgard.
Multiple copies of the note were posted across numerous settlements in the Western Heartlands.
The notice was a call to action for citizens of the Heartlands. Briska shared their concern for the growing presence of Elturian riders, patrolling across the borders of Elturgard. They shared their family heritage and how they would not pay fealty to any foreign city.
Damon Briska posted one of these notices in the village of Moonhaven, found near the local church of Sel√ªne.
