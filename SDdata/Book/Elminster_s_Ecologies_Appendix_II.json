All these elements - each aspect of the environment and each organism - form a tapestry known as the ecology. And like a tapestry of cloth, this one can suffer severe damage if a single thread is removed, no matter how ugly the thread.''\n\n''This appendix includes two booklets penned by friends of [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster of Shadowdale]]. Collected here are:''\n\n* ''a 32-page booklet containing the words of the inimitable Bara, feisty druid of the [[High Moor]], describing the ecology of that region;''\n* ''a 32-page booklet by the Lark of [[Suzail]] that gives her descriptions of the slithering inhabitants of the [[Serpent Hills]]; and''\n* ''a brief booklet of tables to aid the Dungeon Master in determining random encounters for adventurers whose travels take them through these areas.''\n\n''Those planning to explore these regions would be well advised to read the works herein to prepare themselves for the reptilian dangers of the Serpent Hills and the hazards of the High Moor - from its beasts to its protective druid itself!''}}",
        "Description": "''Elminster's Ecologies Appendix II'' contains two booklets which describe the ecologies of two locations in the Realms setting. This information is presented from the perspective of two non-player characters: [[Bara]], a [[druid]] from the [[High Moor]], details the living things in her desolate land; the other is [[Lark]] of [[Suzail]], a [[mage]] with a phobia of [[snake]]s, details the same in the [[Serpent Hills]].\n\n''Elminster's Ecologies Appendix II'' presents information on the geography, weather, plants, and animals of each area, as well as information of the monsters that live there, such as how they organized themselves, and what relationships exist between the tribes. The supplement presents encounter tables but provides no game statistics, and each booklet finished with a section of rumors and legends.",
