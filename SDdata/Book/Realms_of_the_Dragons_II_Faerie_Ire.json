        "mainbody": "Faerie Ire\" is a short story by Erin Tettensor published in the 2005 anthology Realms of the Dragons II.\nIn a rainforest, the faerie dragon Zyx harasses a yuan-ti, making her fall into a pit. During his rest afterwards, he discovers humans are trying to create a path through the jungle, in preparation for future inhabitation. He consults with Cirrothamalan, a mist dragon in order to wake him up, he informs the heavy sleeper that he is leaving the forest semi-permanently. When the creature wakes up, he only gets his interest by insinuating the humans will find his secret grotto afterwards Zyx barely gets him to agree, reluctantly, to attempt to run off the humans without killing them.\nIn their first attempt, Cirrothamalan tramples the camp while under cover of darkness and mist, stealing their horses though they realize the damage, they attribute it to a storm. The two dragons then decide Cirro must impersonate the Uluu Thalongh while putting this in practice, the disguise fails, and the humans believe it to be a mudman. During the ensuing melee, Zyx is caught, and the humans recognize him as a faerie dragon after one of them lets it go, they decide to flee as far away from the pranksters territory as possible immediately.\nA month later, Zyx tells Cirro that he is leaving the forest again, leaving for the other side of the gorge. Cirro quickly observes thats where the humans have gone, and that Zyx simply cannot help but play pranks on them.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  • \nLocations\nThough the story is not stated outright to occur in Chult, it occurs in a rainforest, and the Uluu Thalongh is a local legend.
