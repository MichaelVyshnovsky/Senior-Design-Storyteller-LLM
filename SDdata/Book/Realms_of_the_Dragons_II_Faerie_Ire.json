        "Summary": "In a rainforest, the [[faerie dragon]] [[Zyx]] harasses a [[yuan-ti]], making her fall into a pit. During his rest afterwards, he discovers [[human]]s are trying to create a path through the jungle, in preparation for future inhabitation. He consults with [[Cirrothamalan]], a [[mist dragon]]; in order to wake him up, he informs the heavy sleeper that he is leaving the forest semi-permanently. When the creature wakes up, he only gets his interest by insinuating the humans will find his secret grotto; afterwards Zyx barely gets him to agree, reluctantly, to attempt to run off the humans without killing them.\n\nIn their first attempt, Cirrothamalan tramples the camp while under cover of darkness and mist, stealing their [[horse]]s; though they realize the damage, they attribute it to a storm. The two dragons then decide Cirro must impersonate the [[Uluu Thalongh]]; while putting this in practice, the disguise fails, and the humans believe it to be a [[mudman]]. During the ensuing melee, Zyx is caught, and the humans recognize him as a faerie dragon; after one of them lets it go, they decide to flee as far away from the prankster's territory as possible immediately.\n\nA month later, Zyx tells Cirro that he is leaving the forest again, leaving for the other side of the gorge. Cirro quickly observes that's where the humans have gone, and that Zyx simply cannot help but play pranks on them.",
