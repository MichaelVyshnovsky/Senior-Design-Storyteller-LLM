        "mainbody": "The Thousand Orcs is the first book of The Hunters Blades Trilogy by R.A. Salvatore.\nThe Companions of the Hall are trying to return to Mithral Hall so King Bruenor Battlehammer can replace his late ancestor Gandalug Battlehammer. Meanwhile, a pact is made between orcs led by Obould Many-Arrows and the frost giants led by Gerti Orelsdottr. In one encounter with a group of orcs, Catti-brie almost loses her life, if not for the intervention of Wulfgar and his warhammer, Aegis-fang. Meanwhile, in Mirabar, which the companions recently passed through, many dwarves are being alienated for their feelings of comradery to the dwarves of Mithral Hall and honest competitors instead of their home Mirabar, to the Marchions disapproval and disdain of the dwarves. A group of fifteen dwarves plus Dagnabbit and the companions go around warning towns of the dangerous orc and giant hordes. \nThe companions defend the settlement of Shallows. Drizzt escapes over the wall to attack the giants that are throwing huge rocks on the town. The defenders fight bravely but they are quickly tiring. Bruenor Battlehammer is laid low through the course of the battle and Dagnabbit replaces Bruenor in the defense and takes position wearing Bruenors helm standing atop a large tower that frost giants destroy. Drizzt DoUrden sees the tower fall and believes it to be his friend Bruenor. Drizzt engages a group of frost giants for the second time. He receives assistance from two moon elves named Tarathiel and Innovindil and their pegasi companions, Sunrise and Sunset. Regis has escaped from Shallows and has found reinforcements to help the defenders of the village. The rescue party pretends to be orcs using a hollow statue of Gruumsh created by Pikel Bouldershoulder to get them close to the orc horde without interference. They cut a swath to the defenders, and end up rescuing those still alive. They flee but with many orcs giving chase. They meet warrior dwarves of Mirabar who left because of their leader Marchion Elastuls dislike and borderline hatred for the dwarves of Mithral Hall. \nCharacters\nBruenor Battlehammer • Carelman Twopennies • Catti-brie • Dagnabbit • Drizzt DoUrden • Elastul Raurym • Geletha • Gerti Orelsdottr • Innovindil • Ivan Bouldershoulder • Obould Many-Arrows • Pikel Bouldershoulder • Regis • Tarathiel • Toivo Foamblower • Wulfgar\nGandalug Battlehammer\nMisc\nUpsen Downs"
