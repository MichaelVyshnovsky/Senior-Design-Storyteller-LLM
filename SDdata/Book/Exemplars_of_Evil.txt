'''Villains for Your Campaign'''

Every memorable adventure needs a great villain. You know the type: corrupt, reviled, and rotted to the core. The villains featured in this tome are best of the worst, sure to test the heroes' mettle. The canny pirate lord, the sinister lich, the tyrannical fire giant queen... your characters won't know what hit them!

This supplement shows you how to build memorable villains for your {{Dnd}} campaign and presents eight ready-to-play villainous groups of various levels. Each villain comes with complete game statistics, as well as adventure seeds, campaign hooks, statistics for minions, and a fully detailed lair.|Back-cover text}}
