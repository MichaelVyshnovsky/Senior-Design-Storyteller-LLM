{{Quote|
Once he led the revolutionaries against a tyrannical lord.

Once he had a beautiful wife.

Once he was a hero.

But that was before he got caught, beaten down, nearly killed, and sold into slavery.

Now he has nothing but hate and the chains of his bondage: the only weapons he has with which to escape.
