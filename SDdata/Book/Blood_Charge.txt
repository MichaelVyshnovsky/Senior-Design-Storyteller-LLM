'''''Blood Charge''''' is a ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' adventure using the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' ruleset, published in 1990 by [[TSR, Inc.]] 

{{Quote|''The Stone Sceptre has been recovered.''

''But will it be enough to stop the Raja of [[Solon]]? [[Ambuchar Devayam]] has massed 10,000 zombies on [[Ra-Khati]]'s border. Only [[Gaumahavi]], the Great Dragon of the Purple Wastes, stands between him and the hidden Kingdom. Yet even she cannot face Ambuchar alone, for the evil raja has recovered an archaic [[Imaskar]]i relic that renders him invincible.''

''If Ra-Khati is to be saved and the player characters are to escape the raja's curse, Ambuchar Devayan must be stopped. But how? The player characters' search for a solution will embroil them in [[Tuigan]] politics, lure them to the Red Mountain Monastery's forbidden halls, and lead them into ancient Solon itself, where Ambuchar's slaves—both living and undead—toil to make him even more dangerous.''

Blood Charge ''is the third adventure in the ''Empires Adventures Trilogy'', taking place in the new Forgotten Realms Campaign world territories described in the ''[[The Horde]]'' campaign set. The ''Empires Adventure Trilogy'' is set amidst the turbulent events portrayed in the ''Empires Novel Trilogy''. This adventure is designed for four to eight players characters of levels 7–10. It can be played as a separate, stand-alone module or as the sequel to FRA2,'' [[Black Courser]].''

''Look for other'' Empires Adventures'':'' [[Storm Riders]] and Black Courser.''}}
