{{Quote|''This scar on my arm is the mark of the thin man's [[sword]].''

''These on my chest, the [[barbarian]]'s [[gyrspike]].''

''This, on my shoulder, the woodsman's [[axe]].''

''And this rasping whisper, all that is left of my voice, it is the scar of the [[Lord Singer]]'s jealousy.''

''They took my voice and my life and left my body for the crows. But not all who die rest in peace.''}}
