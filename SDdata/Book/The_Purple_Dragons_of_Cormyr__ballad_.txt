'''''The Purple Dragons of Cormyr''''' was a lengthy ballad dedicated to the [[Purple Dragons|brave and valorous knightly order]] that served the [[Cormyrean]] crown, written and popularized sometime before [[1368 DR]].

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], ''The Purple Dragons of Cormyr'' was performed by the god [[Milil]], the Lord of All Songs. He imposed the beautiful song on an audience of [[Sensates]] from [[Sigil]] who were performing a ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' ritual to experience the forbidden experience of spying on [[Toril]]lian deities.
