The Purple Dragons of Cormyr was a lengthy ballad dedicated to the brave and valorous knightly order that served the Cormyrean crown, written and popularized sometime before 1368 DR.
In 1368 DR, The Purple Dragons of Cormyr was performed by the god Milil, the Lord of All Songs. He imposed the beautiful song on an audience of Sensates from Sigil who were performing a scrying ritual to experience the forbidden experience of spying on Torillian deities.
