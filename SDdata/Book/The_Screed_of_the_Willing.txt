The Screed of the Willing was an ancient religious text that outlined aspects of the Loviatan faith.
The page edges of the book were especially sharp and could easily cut.
The Screed of the Willing told of Loviatars call upon her faithful of the Realms. One could only truly live when they felt, and even reveled in severe pain, whether physical or emotional in origin. Loviatar loved those that truly embraced the pain and suffering they felt. According to the script, pain was the only means to get closer to divinity.
* Abdirak, one of Loviatars faithful who dwelled within the Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 century DR.
