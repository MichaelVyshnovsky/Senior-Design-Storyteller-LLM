"Juice of the Vine" was a drinking song sung in northwest Faer√ªn in the late 15 century DR. It celebrated drinking wine, carousing, and relaxing rather than complaining.
In the late 1490s DR, the bard Edgin Darvis sung "Juice of the Vine" to rouse his fellow prisoners while cutting ice at Revels End prison, though the guard Tobias ordered him to shut up. He thought it was one of Holgas favorites.
