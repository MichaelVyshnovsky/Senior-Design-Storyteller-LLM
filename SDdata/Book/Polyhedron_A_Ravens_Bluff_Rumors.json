        "Synopsis": "In an unnamed settlement boarding the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], a group of [[adventurer]]s short on coins decide to try booking voyage on a ship up to the [[Dragon Reach]] and its port city of [[Ravens Bluff]], feeling certain that the Living City is a place to find adventure and earn a quick coin. Finding themselves unable to afford passage on large ship, the adventurers try looking for a cargo vessel to sign up for work as a man-of-arms. They come to find that all large mercantile vessels are full on crew members, leaving a small [[cog]] known as ''[[The Black Scalawag]]'' as their only option.\n\nWhile conversing with people around the docks and on the ''Black Scalawag'' itself the adventurers are told a wide variety of rumors surrounding recent attacks on ships. Some claim a furious [[storm giant]] is to blame, sinking all ships in retaliation for dumping garbage into the waters and not stopping until he receives reparations. Others claim a [[giant squid]] is attacking vessels, a whirlpool to another [[plane of existence]] is swallowing up ships, or that the [[deity]] [[Istishia]] is sinking all ships whose crew members don't worship him. These all turn out to be tall tales.\n\nSome speak of increasing attacks by [[sahuagin]]s wielding various armaments. While others tell of reports of [[seal]]s near ships moments before they were sunken and of a lone survivor of a recent shipwreck being rescued. He reported to his sailor saviors that the ship he had been on was attacked by [[werewolves]], then disappeared during the next full [[moon]]. In actuality the recent string of attacks on ships was being perpetrated by a pack of [[seawolves|lesser seawolves]], who had infected the sailor with their form of [[lycanthropy]]. They in turn were being regularly followed by a tribe of sahuagin, who took advantage of their attacks to scavenge shipwrecks and then attack lone ships on their own.\n\nOn the second night out at sea two men keeping watch disappear on ''The Black Scalawag'' and on the third another two go missing. On the fourth night there are no disappearances, but on the fifth four men mending the ship's sails are reported as seemingly jumping overboard. By the sixth day there are only seven people left on the ship, plus the adventurers. ''The Black Scalawag's'' captain is in a panicked state, uncertain what course of action to take, for there are no signs of other ships in the vicinity and they are too far out at sea to try turning around. Looking around for any clue as to what was causing the disappearances, the adventurers find only a few spots of blood and scraps of fur. When [[the sun]] sets that day it's the group of adventurers who are chosen to take watch and they come face to face with the lesser seawolves.\n\nIf any of the adventurers have some means of traversing the watery depths, they might come to find the lair of the seawolves and the treasure therein. Within their horde a trove of 22,000 [[copper piece]]s, 16,000 [[silver piece]]s, and 700 [[gold piece]]s are found. As well as fourteen [[gemstone]]s, each worth a hundred gold pieces, and a ''+2 [[short sword]]''. When they bring it all aboard ''The Black Scalawag'' their captain insists upon them sharing the loot, as he wishes to compensate the families of the eight crewmen that were lost to the seawolves.",
