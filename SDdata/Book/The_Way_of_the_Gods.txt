{{quote|''How much does a throne cost? Sometimes but one life, when sickness, old age, or a lucky [[blade]] takes the life of a king in a strong kingdom. Sometimes a throne costs the life of everyone in a kingdom. Most often, it takes the life of a few ambitious, grasping men, and the more of those the Realms is rid of, the better.''|Excerpt from ''The Way of the Gods''}}
