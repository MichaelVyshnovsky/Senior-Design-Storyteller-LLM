Despite their differences, all hags were deadly creatures, be it a night hag or a bheur. If left alive, hags were sure to leave the Prime Material plane only to return later with a vengeance. The author stated that to return, hags used a special species of spore-producing fungi unbred with the hags essence. As long as these haggish mushrooms existed, the hag could not be killed. The mushrooms were also hard to destroy, being only vulnerable to fire.\nBy the , a copy of A Hunters Guide to Hags belonged to the Anti-Hag Support Group of Baldurs Gate, aiding their research into the hags life cycles and the crusade against the creatures and their evil schemes."
