        "Contents": "One of the topics covered by the book was the activities and personalities of various races of hags. Despite their differences, all hags were deadly creatures, be it a [[night hag]] or a [[bheur]]. If left alive, hags were sure to leave the [[Prime Material plane]] only to return later with a vengeance. The author stated that to return, hags used a special species of spore-producing [[fungi]] unbred with the hag's essence. As long as these haggish mushrooms existed, the hag could not be killed. The mushrooms were also hard to destroy, being only vulnerable to fire.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''A Hunter's Guide to Hags'' belonged to the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], aiding their research into the hags' life cycles and the crusade against the creatures and their evil schemes."
