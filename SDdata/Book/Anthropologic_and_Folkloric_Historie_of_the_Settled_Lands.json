It detailed the history and legends of the societies and cultures in the [[Settled Lands]] of [[Faer√ªn]],{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}} these being the lands of [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and [[the Dalelands]].\n\nThe third volume touched on the life of a bandit chieftain known as [[Fastred]] who lived within the [[Vast Swamp]] and the legend of his [[ghost]]. Carcroft mentioned that [[lizardfolk]], [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[grell]]s lived there too.\n\nThe retired [[War Wizard]] and sage [[Benelaius]] had a copy in his library at his home near [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]]. His servant [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] read it in [[1366]]/[[1367 DR]]. He thought it was old-fashioned and had terrible spelling. Nevertheless, he quoted it for his account of the murders in Ghars at the time.\n\nA copy was kept in [[Candlekeep]] around [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote\n|''And in those days in the lande between Sembia and Cormyr, there dwelt within the Vaste Swamppe a reaver and a chieftain hight\nFASTRED. He lived in the swamppe with his people, heedless of the monstyrs and beasties that also resided therein, such as the men lyke unto lizards, the goblynnes and trolls and grelles.''|Extract from ''Anthropologic and Folkloric Historie'' [sic]}}"
