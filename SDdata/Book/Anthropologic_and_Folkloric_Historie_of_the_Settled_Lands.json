        "mainbody": "Anthropologic and Folkloric Historie of the Settled Lands was a seven-volume series of books written by the famed historian Carcroft the Long. It detailed the history and legends of the societies and cultures in the Settled Lands of Faer√ªn, these being the lands of Cormyr, Sembia, and the Dalelands.\nThe third volume touched on the life of a bandit chieftain known as Fastred who lived within the Vast Swamp and the legend of his ghost. Carcroft mentioned that lizardfolk, goblins, trolls, and grells lived there too.\nThe retired War Wizard and sage Benelaius had a copy in his library at his home near Ghars, Cormyr. His servant Jasper read it in 1366/1367 DR. He thought it was old-fashioned and had terrible spelling. Nevertheless, he quoted it for his account of the murders in Ghars at the time.\nA copy was kept in Candlekeep around 1372 DR."
