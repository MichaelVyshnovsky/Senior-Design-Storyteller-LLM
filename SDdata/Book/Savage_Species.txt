{{quote|'''''A New Breed of Adventurer'''''

''Whether wondrous or wicked, some monsters have a calling that reaches beyond the ordinary existence of their kind. Traveling alongside other intrepid characters, these heroic creatures carve their places in legend with sword, spell, tooth, and claw.''

''This supplement for the D&D game provides everything you need to play a monster as a character or to make the monsters your heroes fight even more formidable. Inside are over 50 all-new monster classes that show how creatures develop their characteristics and abilities as they gain levels. Along with new prestige classes and monster templates, Savage Species also features new feats, spells, magic items, and more.''}}

==Description==
''Savage Species'' introduces classes and outlines rules for playing monstrous races as player characters, and introduces taking racial levels in the player character's race instead of in a given class. It began as a guide to playing monsters as PCs but, during the design process, became a book to assist Dungeon Masters in creating monster non-player characters as well.
