        "mainbody": "The Haunted Bedpan was a comedic hin opera, a typical genre among halflings, also well liked by dwarves and gnomes.\nThe story of The Haunted Bedpan was full of toilet humor and revolved around an enchanted bedpan that captured emotional and dramatic moments in the lives of those who used it. The item magically replayed those events it \"clung\" to, always audibly and comically misinterpreting the previous users recordings. The Haunted Bedpan caused chaos among the operas characters. Despite its name, the Haunted Bedpan was not actually used as a bedpan on stage.\nMany actors who performed the opera were reportedly flush with pride over it."
