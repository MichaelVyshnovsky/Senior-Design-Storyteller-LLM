        "Contents": "The story of ''The Haunted Bedpan'' was full of toilet humor and revolved around an [[enchanted]] bedpan that captured emotional and dramatic moments in the lives of those who used it. The item magically replayed those events it \"clung\" to, always audibly and comically misinterpreting the previous users' recordings. ''The Haunted Bedpan'' caused chaos among the opera's characters. Despite its name, the ''Haunted Bedpan'' was not actually used as a bedpan on stage.\n\nMany actors who performed the opera were reportedly flush with pride over it."
