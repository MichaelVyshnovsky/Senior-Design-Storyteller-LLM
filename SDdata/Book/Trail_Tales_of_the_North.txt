{{quote|''The way of a [[mage]] is a dark and lonely one. This is why so many wizards fall early into the darkness of the grave–or later into the endless twilight of [[undead|undeath]]. Such bright prospects are why the road to mastery of magecraft is always such a crowded one.''|Excerpt from ''Trail Tales of the North''}}

==Contents==
Jhalivar Thrunn's book was a collection of tales and musings from [[North Faerûn]]. One of the points made was the idea that wizards were lonely creatures whose life was filled with competition and either ended in early death or in endless undeath.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}
