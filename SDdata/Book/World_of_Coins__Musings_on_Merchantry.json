Yet there are courtiers, peddlers, seers, and moneylenders who lie adroitly and can spin deceptions within deceptions deftly, rather than desperately or unintentionally. They court discovery as do clumsier liars, but flirt also with another danger: weaving deceptions so well that they lose sight of who they are, and without perceiving it are themselves transformed by their own falsity.''|An excerpt from ''World of Coins: Musings on Merchantry''}}",
        "Contents": "The ''World of Coins'' was a collection of thoughts and meditations on the mercantile profession and the elaborate but necessary set of skills required to be successful in that vocation. The book discussed the skill of weaving falsehoods and its possible dangers and downfalls."
