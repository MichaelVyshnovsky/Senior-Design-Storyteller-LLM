{{quote|''Stormy weather is always with us, somewhere in [[Faerûn]]. Beneath it, all too often, [[sword]]s are out, the hand that wields one seeking to bury it in the body that wields another. Part of the way of things as the [[god]]s order, perhaps—or just the way of all of us flawed beings who walk this world. I fear I'll never see a day when no swords will be drawn—or needed. But then, perhaps my sight fails too soon.''|Excerpt from ''To Harp and to Help''}}
