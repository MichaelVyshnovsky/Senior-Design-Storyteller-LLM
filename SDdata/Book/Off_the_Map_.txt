Off the Map!, also known by its full title Off the Map A Pirates Guide to Stand-up Comedy, was a book popular among pirates of the Sea of Swords and Nelanther Islands circa 1372 DR.
Apparently, despite what the back cover claimed, Off the Map! was not that funny.
This lackluster book was often found in homes and establishments frequented by pirates of the Sea of Swords. It was often sold by vendors of Spindrift Town circa 1372 DR.
