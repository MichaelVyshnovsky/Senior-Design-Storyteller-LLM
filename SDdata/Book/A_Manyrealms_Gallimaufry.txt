'''''A Manyrealms Gallimaufry''''' was a 12{{th}} century compilation of maps that was considered the most well-known of its kind among the scholars of the Realms. It was compiled by the renowned cartographer, [[Trammeth Anstrelgor]].

==History==
When Anstrelgor died around the {{YearlinkName|1114}}, the original copy of ''A Manyrealms'' was interred with his body. The final resting place of both Anstrelgor and his masterpiece was located somewhere in [[Tethyr]].

As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an incomplete copy of the original could be found within the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]].
