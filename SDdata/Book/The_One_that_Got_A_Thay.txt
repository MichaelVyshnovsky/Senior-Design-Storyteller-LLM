The One that Got A Thay was a piece of ahistorical smutty romance fiction found in the Western Heartlands.
The book contained a slow-paced, enemies-to-lovers story between an acerbic Thayan wizard and his arch-nemesis, a musclebound pure-of-heart berserker.
A copy was kept in the library of the Sharess Caress brothel in 1492 DR.
