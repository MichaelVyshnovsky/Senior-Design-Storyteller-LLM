The book of Dellanil Quilquien was an ancient tome containing the writings of Dellanil Quilquien, an elf king of Shilmista  and one of the forests legendary heroes.
It was bound in black leather and inscribed with the high elven runes for D, Q, q. The tome was locked by a snap.
The Dellanil Quilquien contained arcane writings, using old elven symbols.
There was an account of how King Dellanil Quilquien awakened the trees of Shilmista and how the elves crushed an invading force of goblins with the help of the trees. This was also, not a simple spell, but a calling to awaken the powers of the forest.
Cadderly Bonaduce found the tome in a deserted cave in the Daoine Dune in the . A dream, or more a vision finally helped Cadderly to understand and translate the ancient writings.
Cadderly and Elbereth, the elven prince of Shilmista, recited the words of the summons at Sildritch Trea and awakened a couple of ancient oaks to help conquer the orcish, goblinoid, and giant forces of the ogrillon Ragnor and free Shilmista once again.
