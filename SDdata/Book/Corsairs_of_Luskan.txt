'''''Corsairs of Luskan''''' was a [[book]] dedicated to the infamous rulers of the northern city of [[Luskan]], the piratical groups known as "Ships," printed sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Content==
''Corsairs of Luskan'' began by conducting a detailed cultural analysis of the city, eventually focusing on its trade and the city's ''de facto'' rulers: the most diverse, cutthroat, and fractured cabal of pirates broken into groups known as "Ships." The book continued detailing the pirate organizations in immaculate detail, including a little-known fact that [[Ship Kurth]] was secretly controlled by a [[drow]] [[Bregan D'aerthe|mercenary company]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, copies of ''Corsairs of Luskan'' were sold by [[Nansi Gretta]] at [[The Bibliophile]] bookshop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] and another copy was found on the shelves of the [[Open Hand Temple]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]].
