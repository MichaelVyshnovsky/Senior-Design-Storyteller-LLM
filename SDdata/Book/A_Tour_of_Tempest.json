Reach up thy hands to the sky, outstretched awaiting breath of gods to blast thee oblivious, supplicate and ask to be drowned, to be blown asunder, to be destroyed... or perhaps, perhaps, to be granted such might to speak the words of Talos with thine own sweet hand...''|Excerpt from ''A Tour of Tempest''}}",
