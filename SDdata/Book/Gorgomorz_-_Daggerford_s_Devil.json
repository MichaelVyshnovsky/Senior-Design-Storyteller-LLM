The pit fiend Gorgomorz became an infamous adversary of the city, later known as the \"Daggerfords Devil\". He burned through the lands surrounding the city, killing the innocents and destroying the farmlands. His final goal was Daggerfords destruction. Young Duke Edwin Daggerford, the great grandfather of Duke Pwyll Daggerford, took a stand against the devil. The battle ended when the young duke collapsed the citys portcullis gate on Gorgomorz, pinning him to the ground. Edwin Daggerford and his troops charged before the fiend was able to free himself. The Duke plunged his sword into Gorgomorzs heart while suffering the devils hellfires. Gorgomorz promised revenge with his dying breath. Edwin Daggerford died a hero from his wounds shortly after, cementing his place in the citys history.\nIn 1372 DR, Gorgomorz - Daggerfords Devil folio could be found in Daggerfords library, open to the public, and proudly displayed on a pedestal."
