        "Contents": "This book held information on the historical event that happened ''circa'' 1270 DR. The pit fiend Gorgomorz became an infamous adversary of the city, later known as the \"Daggerford's Devil\". He burned through the lands surrounding the city, killing the innocents and destroying the farmlands. His final goal was Daggerford's destruction. Young Duke Edwin Daggerford, the great grandfather of Duke [[Pwyll Daggerford]], took a stand against the devil. The battle ended when the young duke collapsed the city's portcullis gate on Gorgomorz, pinning him to the ground. Edwin Daggerford and his troops charged before the fiend was able to free himself. The Duke plunged his sword into Gorgomorz's heart while suffering the devil's hellfires. Gorgomorz promised revenge with his dying breath. Edwin Daggerford died a hero from his wounds shortly after, cementing his place in the city's history.",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, ''Gorgomorz - Daggerford's Devil'' folio could be found in Daggerford's library, open to the public, and proudly displayed on a pedestal."
