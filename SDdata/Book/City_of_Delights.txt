City of Delights is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set. It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.
This boxed set describes Zakharas principal jewel, the Golden City of Huzuz – huge, filled with every imaginable item and service, and saturated with intrigue and mystery. Each of the 800,000 citizens has a story, such as how the merchant Khwaja al-Danaf gained his fortune how the Talking Bird and Singing Tree came to the garden in the Palace of the Enlightened Throne and how the Caliphs elven concubine Halima gained a winged cat.
The book provides hints on what player characters may want to do in Huzuz An ethoist priest wants to preach in the great Golden Mosque, so the Mosque entry tells whom to talk to.
