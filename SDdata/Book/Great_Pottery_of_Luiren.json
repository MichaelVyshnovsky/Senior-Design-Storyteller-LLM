        "mainbody": "'''''Great Pottery of Luiren''''' was a book that talked about various cooking receptacles of the industrious [[hin]] folk of the [[Shining South]], published before the fall of the [[Seldarine's Hand]], centuries before [[1281 DR]].",
        "Content": "The tome of ''Great Pottery of Luiren'' covered the fascinating subject of [[pottery]] from [[Luiren]]. The tome prized the hin's dedication to utility and usefulness in cooking over beauty. Even though halflings created expensive, elaborately-decorated [[pot]]s and dishes inlaid with [[malachite]] and [[lapis]], they were exceedingly rare. These particular designs came from the period of time between [[750 DR]] and [[830 DR]] in Luiren and were bracingly different from traditional hin pottery craft. Most common hin pottery was simple and bottom-heavy, molded out of brown-red [[clay]]. The [[glaze]] was not common and, when used, was often ocher or bright green.",
        "History": "''Great Pottery of Luiren'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' [[900 DR]] and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. A copy of ''Great Pottery of Luiren'' could be found in the citadel's library curated by [[Custhantos]], along with other rare books."
