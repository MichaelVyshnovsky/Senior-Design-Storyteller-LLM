The untitled [[book]] that had several tentative names, '''''The Unforeseen Alliance, Volume I''''', '''''Druids and Harpers, A Fight for Good!''''', and '''''The Shadowed Evil: Who Dares to Stand Against It?''''', was the first volume of four, all unpublished drafts penned by [[Roan Featherway]] in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
Volume one was nothing more than a draft, neatly scribbled in a journal. Roan Featherway's name was written inside. The book contained numerous chapters that filled the entire journal. Its inner cover had a list of publishers in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The journal's cover had there titles for the book – all crossed out.

The story began as the protagonist – a mighty and brave [[druid]] named Roa, arrived at the [[Emerald Grove]], summoned there by the [[Emerald Enclave]]. Roa was alarmed by such summoning, rightfully so. The book then briefly delved into a tangent about the structure of the Emerald Enclave – an organization of fellow druids and [[ranger]]s scattered across [[Faerûn]], fighting for the natural order of things and balance of nature, civilization, and the elements. Roa was said to be the fiercest of the Emerald Enclave's fighters and defenders of the balance. The actor then went on to describe Roa as a tall and mountainous man, built like a [[bear]] or an [[ox]]. Arriving at the Grove, Roa was greeted by the place buzzing with activities, eventually leading him to meet a beautiful ebony-haired woman with eyes blue like a [[bluebird]]. Roa's good spirits quickly turned once he noticed the woman's ''[[Harper pin]]''.

==History==
Roan Featherway was himself a druid of [[Silvanus]] and his work was heavily inspired by the events of the war between General [[Ketheric Thorm]] and the joint forces of [[Harpers]] and the Emerald Enclave that took place in the late 14{{th}} century DR. The draft novel's characters included the real druid of the Emerald Grove – [[Halsin]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, it remained unknown whether ''"The Unforeseen Alliance"'' ever was published, just like the rest of the drafts in the series.
