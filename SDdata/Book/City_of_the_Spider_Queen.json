        "mainbody": "ity of the Spider Queen, designed by James Wyatt, is an adventure module set in the Forgotten Realms using the  3-edition ruleset. It focuses on drow, the Silence of Lolth, and the cult of Kiaransalee.\n* Introduction\n* Part 1 Spinning the Web\n* Part 2 The Deep Wastes\n* Part 3 Maerimydra\n* Part 4 The Undying Temple\n* Appendix 1 Monsters and Magic\n* Appendix 2 Creature Statistics\nThe adventure starts off as adventurers respond to the summons of Randal Morn, who asks them to investigate recent drow raids on Daggerdale. In Part 1, their hunt takes them through ancient Dordrien crypts in the Dagger Hills to the drow outpost of Szith Morcane, founded long ago by drow from the nearby city of Maerimydra. Within Szith Morcane, the party stumble across the true cause of the raids, a newly installed cult of Kiaransalee. The cult used the Silence of Lolth to take control of Szith Morcane and is galvanizing the natives of the outpost into increased activity against the surface world.\nWithin the Commoners level of Szith Morcane, a tunnel leads off to the northeast, toward Maerimydra. In Part 2 of the adventure, an expedition through roughly 100 miles (160&nbspkm) of winding Underdark tunnels is embarked upon. Navigating past numerous dangerous locales and evil denizens, including the Lake of Shadows, the Wailing Cliff, and Vournoths Mire, the adventurers eventually find their way to the besieged city of Maerimydra.\nAt Maerimydra, in Part 3, the adventurers find the drow city a burning ruin as the forces of Kurgoth Hellspawns army have overrun the former metropolis. The cult of Kiaransalee still defends Castle Maerimydra, strengthened by large numbers of undead minions. The summoning of the Undying Temple by their leader, Irae Tsarran, has created a growing local corruption in the Weave of magic. The majority of this part takes place within Maerimydra (the City of the Spider Queen) as the adventurers battle the servants of Irae Tsarran, in addition to the invading armies of the Kurgoth Hellspawn.\nPart 4, the final act of the adventure, takes place in the Undying Temple, Irae Tsarrans malignant fane above Castle Maerimydra. Constructed partially in the Material Plane and partially in the Ethereal Plane, the temple stands at the heart of an expanding area of disruption in the Weave. Inside this shrine, the adventurers confront Iraes fiendish and undead servitors and lastly even the priestess herself.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • Sshumath Daerindra •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • Chaumyk Vorn • Dreveth the Gray •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • human •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nBuildings & Sites  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSettlements  •  • \nWilderness  •  •  •  • \nRealms \nPlanes  • Material Plane\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMagic \nMagic Items  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSpells  •  •  •  • \nFamilies  •  • \nGroups  •  • \nDeities \nPriests  •  •  •  •  • \nTemples Courtyard of Lolth • Fane of Lolth • Shrine of the Claw • Undying Temple\n • Temple of Tyr • Tyr\n •  •  • \n* Designer James Wyatt\n* Developer Richard Baker\n* Editors Michele Carter, Gwendolyn F.M.
