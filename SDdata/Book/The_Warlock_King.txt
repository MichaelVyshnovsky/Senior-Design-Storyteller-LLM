The Warlock King was a ballad known in Faer√ªn by the 1360s DR, about the Warlock King, the ruler of the Warlocks Crypt, a misnomer and corruption of the ancient lich wizard Larlochs name.
A few minstrels mistakenly called Larloch "the Warlock" or "the Warlock King," after the Warlocks Crypt where he dwelled, but Larloch, apparently, took umbrage at being called a warlock. Composers of ballads naming him as such were supposedly kidnapped by creatures in the night and carried away to be tortured and turned into some undead thing by Larloch. Thus, singing the ballad "The Warlock King" anywhere in three days ride of the Troll Hills was not advised, lest Larloch overhear and be displeased.It is not clear if "The Warlock King" is actually about Larloch.
