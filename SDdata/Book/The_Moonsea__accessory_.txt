'''''The Moonsea''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|''Its waters are the deep purple of the most precious [[amethyst]]; its shores hold some of the most dangerous locations in [[Faerûn]]. It is the [[Moonsea]], home to [[Zhentil Keep]], the [[Citadel of the Raven]], and thousands of ordinary folk who merely want to make an honest living.''

''Hark to the words of [[Melandryll Belarod]], the [[bard]] whose writings form the bulk of this material. He has experienced firsthand the horrors of ruined [[Hulburg]], the desolation of [[Sulasspryn]], and the stench of [[Mulmaster]]. His travels aboard the ''[[Devawing]]'' have produced this chronicle of the towns and people of the Moonsea, including both havens and dangers. Belarod knows of the Citadel of the Raven, a ten-mile-long series of fortresses and barracks, site of a terrifying betrayal. He also has evaded the [[Zhentilar]], the crack forces garrisoned at Zhentil Keep.''

''In this product are a 64-page ''Reference Guide'' for the Dungeon Master, a 32-page ''Player's Guide'', and a four-color poster map of the Moonsea region.''}}
