Gond be the finest o' the big Gods. He dunnae fuck around witha wee teensy back-an-forth o' the miniscule Gods. He forges pal, and he dunnae truck with tartly dogberries. Know how I know? His servants are fuckin' hard and I mean log-up-the-arse hard. Live by t'anvil, die by t'anvil.''|Excerpt from ''Gond and Gripping Life by the Tongs''.}}",
        "Contents": "The contents of the book were crudely written praises and venerations of the deity himself, his clergy, and the author's awe in the face of the newly-forged [[steel watcher]]s of Baldur's Gate – the creations of the [[Church of Gond]].",
        "History": "''Gond and Gripping Life by the Tongs'' was penned in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, sometime after the steel watchers were created with the help of new Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and put into service alongside the [[Flaming Fist]]s in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. A copy of the book was available to the guests of the non-denominational temple – the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]]."
