A stalwart band of young and enthusiastic heroes was recruited to ride to his aid, yet all they recovered was the ''Sword'' itself and a message: \"Seek me in [[Spiderhaunt Wood]].\" In the second part of the trilogy, [[The Secret of Spiderhaunt]], those same adventurers found Randal and freed him briefly, yet he was almost as quickly torn from their grasp by an agent of the evil [[Zhentarim]], seeking to end the threat of Randal Morn's return to power. ''\n\n''In this final episode, the heroes must follow the kidnapper's trail and rescue Randal Morn before the Zhentarim finish interrogating him and the axe falls upon his neck. Armed with the ''[[The Sword of the Dales|Sword of the Dales]]'' and aided by a powerful magical spirit that lives within the weapon, the heroes must march into the heart of Zhent-occupied [[Dagger Falls]], free Randal Morn, and save the city from utter destruction. The job is dangerous&mdash;perhaps more than the heroes can handle&mdash;yet those who would live in songs and legends cannot concern themselves with living to a ripe old age!''\n\n''This is the final part of a trilogy of modules that began with ''[[The Sword of the Dales]]'' and ''[[The Secret of Spiderhaunt]]''.''}}",
        "Description": "''The Return of Randal Morn'' adventure module is part of a trilogy that focuses on the character [[Randal Morn]]. It is designed for four to six characters of levels 1-4. The module is designed to provide a mix of intrigue, combat, and exploration.\n\n''The Return of Randal Morn'' revolves around the efforts to restore Randal Morn to his rightful position as the ruler of [[Daggerdale]]. The region has fallen under the tyranny of the [[Zhentarim]], and Randal Morn, the rightful heir, has been leading a guerrilla war against the usurpers. The players' characters are drawn into this conflict and tasked with a series of challenges that will aid Randal Morn in reclaiming his rule.\n\nIt begins with the characters embarking on a quest to find the legendary \"Silver Standard,\" a symbol of legitimate rule lost in the [[Dalelands]]. This quest leads them through a series of dangerous locales, each presenting unique challenges and revealing parts of the overarching plot.",
