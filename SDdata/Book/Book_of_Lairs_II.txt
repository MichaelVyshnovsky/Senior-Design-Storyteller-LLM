'''''Book of Lairs II''''' is a 1{{st}}-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' accessory. The second installment in the "Book of Lairs" format, it presents 70 small adventure scenarios by twenty different authors, including four by creator of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting [[Ed Greenwood]]. Each is focused on a creature from either core AD&D or the ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' accessory, with at least one explicitly stated as being in the [[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms|Kara-Tur setting]].

{{Quote|''This is the second in a series of ground-breaking AD&D accessories. Within these pages are nearly 70 fully developed adventures that can be inserted into any campaign. They are ready-to-play challenges for all levels of characters. DMs need not spend long hours creating diversions for their players? We've done it for you.''<br/>''If you have The Book of Lairs, you already know what you'll find herein. These mini-adventures are arranged by terrain type (city, desert, hills, mountains, forest, etc.), with monsters in alphabetical order for easy access. At the back of the book is a combined monsters statistics table, showing all the necessary figures at a glance.''<br/>''These are familiar monsters (like the [[gnome]], [[brownie]], and [[ettin]]) and not-so-familiar ones (like the [[bakemono]] and [[tengu]]), from both original AD&D sources and the ''Oriental Adventures'' book. Some of these mini-adventures are mere diversions; others can turn into minor campaigns! In any case, DMs and players alike are sure to be pleased with ''The Book of Lairs II''.''}}
