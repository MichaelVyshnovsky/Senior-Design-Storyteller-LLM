Search for the Diamond Staff was an adventure module for the D&D Encounters program in 2013, for the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
Following on from the events of Vault of the Dracolich, the sage Imani organises an expedition to one of Uvaerens library-vaults. However, orcs from the Fangfist tribe steal the Diamond Staff of Chomylla from Imanis tower. The Zhentarim are the true culprits but they have merely been hired by a sembian mage to obtain the staff for his shadovar masters, however, the leader of the contingent of mercenaries betrays her employer to keep the Staff for herself. The woman fled to Peldans Helm in Mistledale, where she hoped to open the Vault of Song and plunder the artifacts and lore held within but was being chased by Dretchroyasters dragon cultist minions. A three-way battle for the Staff ensues inside the Vault between agents of Imani, the Zhentarim and the cultists.
