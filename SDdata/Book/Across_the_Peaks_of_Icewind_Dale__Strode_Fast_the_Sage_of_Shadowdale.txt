'''''Across the Peaks of Icewind Dale, Strode Fast the Sage of Shadowdale''''' was a popular ballad about the Sage of [[Shadowdale]], [[Elminster]], with its lyrics penned by [[Volothamp Geddarm]] sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Is that so? The lyrics are by Volo, you know, whose name alone is sufficient enough a criterion to arbitrate its acclaim to truth.''|Elminster Aumar}}

According to Elminster, the ballad was loosely based on the two weeks he spent in the frigid [[Icewind Dale]], surviving annoyances of "frozen beard" and [[Frostbite (condition)|frostbite]]. The Old Sage was frustrated over Volo's lighthearted retelling of the tale, making it sound as casual as a walk across the [[Dalelands]].
