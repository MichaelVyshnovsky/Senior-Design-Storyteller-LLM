"Patronage" is a short story by David Cook included in the 1993 anthology Realms of Valor. It revisits the lama Koja of Khazari from the Empires trilogy.
Now based at the temple of Deneir in Procampur, Koja seeks to tell the truth about the Tuigan by writing and publishing a book based on his experiences, while he reminisces of his homeland of Khazari. Koja looks into printing his book and seeks funding from the citys nobles, before receiving a gift from a powerful benefactor.
