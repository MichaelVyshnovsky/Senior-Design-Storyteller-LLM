'''''Tome of the Self-Same Trial''''' was a [[book|textbook]] used to teach [[Sharran]] initiates how to defeat their mirror self, penned long before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Content==
The purpose of the ''Tome of the Self-Same Trial'' was to help young initiates pass the self-same trial, which was part of the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] and a right of passage for [[Dark Justiciars]] of the Church. Sharran acolytes had to muster the strength to defeat their and only mirror images. If a group took on a trial, each participant had to defeat their dark reflection, and those who attacked the others were penalized.
