Tome of the Self-Same Trial was a textbook used to teach Sharran initiates how to defeat their mirror self, penned long before the 15 century DR.
The purpose of the Tome of the Self-Same Trial was to help young initiates pass the self-same trial, which was part of the Gauntlet of Shar and a right of passage for Dark Justiciars of the Church. Sharran acolytes had to muster the strength to defeat their and only mirror images. If a group took on a trial, each participant had to defeat their dark reflection, and those who attacked the others were penalized.
