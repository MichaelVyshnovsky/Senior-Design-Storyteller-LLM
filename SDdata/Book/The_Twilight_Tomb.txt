The Twilight Tomb is designed for 3-level characters.
The adventure sees the PCs on an expedition into the Yuirwood of Aglarond, where they discover a passage to the Night Realm, a demiplane splintered off the plane of SildÃ«yuir, realm of the star elves. Here, they venture into a citadel of glass and are caught between the mad schemes of a corrupted star elf named Mourel Duskwalker, a yochlol sorceress named Savera, and contend with armies of skeletons and orc and hobgoblin mercenaries and much stranger monsters. The theme is one of weird horror, with bizarre undead and aberrations appearing. The storyline reveals some of the history and culture of the star elves first introduced in Unapproachable East, as well as their conflict with the nilshai.
