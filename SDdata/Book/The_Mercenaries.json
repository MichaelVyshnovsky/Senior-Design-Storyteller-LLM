But the mission has a hidden purpose, and somewhere behind the scenes it connects to the kidnapping of a young bride from [[Waterdeep]].''}}",
        "Summary": "A mysterious man [[Belmer Droon]] sought out a group of pirates of the recently destroyed ''[[Kissing Shark]]'' ship. He caught up with them in the port town of [[Tharkar]], at the rowdy tavern - [[Donder's Dancing Masques]]. The seven Sharkers were [[Belgin Dree]], [[Brindra Arrose]], [[Ingrar Welven]], [[Jolloth Burbuck|Jolloth \"Anvil\" Burbuck]], [[Kurthe Lornar]], [[Nargin Olnblade|Nargin \"Rings\" Olnblade]], and [[Sharessa Stagwood|Sharessa \"The Shadow\" Stagwood]]. Belmer aided the Sharpers avoiding the cruel travesty that passed for law enforcement in Tharkar. As they escaped, the mysterious benefactor contracted the Sharkers to find and kill a woman in [[Doegan]]. The woman's name was [[Eidola]].\n\nUnder the cover of night, the group set sail on their journey to Doegan's capital, [[Eldrinpar]]. Belmer's hired ship - ''[[Morning Bird]]'', shortly after setting sail, came under the attack from a mysterious ship of black color. The Sharkers came face-to-face with the gruesome ''[[bone ball]]s'' and [[fire pot missile]]s. Fighting for their lives, the pirates barely dispatched the undead and put out the flames, as their secretive benefactor used one of the magic items in his possession, a ''[[box of mists]]'', to transport the ship to a new location, trying to seek the pursuit off.\n\nFleeing through the magic mists, the ''Morning Bird'' reached temporary safety. Belmer knew they were somehow magically tracked. He attempted to drug his mercenaries using [[yulchass powder]] to have them spill their secrets, but they proved to be truthful with their employee. Still fearing another attack, Belmer used another magic item he procured with the help of his master. Using his ''[[prayer-token of Umberlee]]'', he summoned a ghastly ''[[ghost ship]]'' and its [[sea zombie]], subservient to the Bitch Queen herself. Being a fickle and malicious deity, [[Umberlee]] used the summoned ship to attack the ''Morning Bird''. The Sharkers survived the ghostly encounter by sacrificing to the goddess their valuables.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation, Belmer discovered a magical ''[[scrying]]'' device, proving his suspicions. The ''Morning Bird'' soon was caught up with by the sinister black ship, the ''[[Black Dragon (ship)|Black Dragon]]'', helmed by a pirate scourge, [[Orim Redbeard]]. Orim was in pursuit of Belmer's group thinking his ship sheltered his enemy and Sharker's old captain [[Blackfingers Ralingor]]. After a parley, both ships went on their own way, with Orim Redbeard realizing that his hated nemesis was indeed not on board of the ''Morning Bird''.\n\nDuring the parley, one of the Sharkers attempted to avenge their destroyed ship and dead captain. [[Kurthe Lornar]] was getting ready to start trouble, as Belmer knocked the pirate unconscious. Once Kurthe awoke, he poured his hate for  Redbeard and frustrations at his employer. Lornar attempted to murder Belmer Droon. The fight ensued, but Kurthe's brute force was no match for Belmer's confident agile skill. Refusing to see reason, Kurthe ended up dead with a dagger in his neck. The rest of the Sharkers continued their employ and continued on with the mission to kill Eidola.",
