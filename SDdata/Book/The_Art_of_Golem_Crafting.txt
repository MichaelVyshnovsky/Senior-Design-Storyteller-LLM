The Art of Golem Crafting was a unique unpublished manuscript penned by Ikathilo of Gond from the Purple Portals of Melvaunt.
The Art of Golem Crafting was considered a seminal piece of research on the topic of golem-making, a masterwork of research, skill, and determination so common among Ikathilos fellow artificers of Gond. This unassuming manuscript held the core of the modern understanding of advanced golem construction of Faer√ªn.
Ikathilos prolific career in pursuit of knowledge was legendary. He was renowned for his talent and the secrecy of his research. At some point in his life, he established a hidden workshop in the plane of Mechanus, where he continued perfecting his creations. Sometime before 1373 DR, Ikathilo died and left behind his lab and unfinished constructs. The only gate that led to the Mechanus workshop was in his chambers at the very bottom of the Purple Portals temple in Melvaunt. At some point, fellow Gondars, led by Isaac Glinckle, attempted to recover the deceased artificers research but were unsuccessful. Instead, they accidentally activated Ikathilos constructs and were chased out of the workshop by malfunctioning and crazed mithral, iron, and adamantine golems.
In 1373 DR, heroes of the Moonsea serendipitously crossed paths with Isaac, who asked for their aid in recovering The Art of Golem Crafting, lest it be considered lost forever. Eventually, the adventurers retrieved the priceless manuscript, returning it to the hands of the clerics of the Purple Portals.
