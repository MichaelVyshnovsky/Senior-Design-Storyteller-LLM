        "mainbody": "Elameths Compendium was a tome of arcane knowledge from the Hand of the Seldarine before the strongholds fall centuries before 1281 DR.\nPenned by the elven enchanter Elameth of Five Trees, the Compendium collected technical knowledge and numerous sketches of a variety of magical artifacts. It detailed plans and methods that were used to enchant items, as well as works by the dwarven smith Karador that were combined with Elameths enchantments.\nElameths Compendium was written and printed sometime between the citadels construction circa 900 DR and its fall in the Battle of Seldarines Hand. By 1281 DR, the citadel was ruined and inhabited by ghostly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the Elameths Compendium copies could be found in the citadels library curated by Custhantos, along with other rare books."
