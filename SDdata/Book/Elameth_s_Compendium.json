        "Content": "Penned by the [[elf|elven]] [[enchanter]] [[Elameth]] of Five Trees, the ''Compendium'' collected technical knowledge and numerous sketches of a variety of magical artifacts. It detailed plans and methods that were used to enchant items, as well as works by the [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith [[Karador]] that were combined with Elameth's enchantments.",
        "History": "''Elameth's Compendium'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' [[900 DR]] and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By [[1281 DR]], the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the ''Elameth's Compendium'' copies could be found in the citadel's library curated by [[Custhantos]], along with other rare books."
