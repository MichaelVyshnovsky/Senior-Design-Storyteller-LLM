Baron Stefan Krenins Theory of Reanimation of Dead was a book that gave a detailed account of Stefan Krenins methods for reanimating the dead.
This book detailed the theories, formulas, and experiments that led Stefan Krenin to create a sparkling powder that had a similar effect to the animator spores of a myconid&mdashwhen sprinkled over the corpse of a creature it would become a completely uncontrollable zombie.
A copy of this book was generally worth around 250 gold pieces, though powerful alchemists and wizard guilds would pay someone twice that amount for one.
A copy of this book stood within Bard Keep, a library and temple of Oghma that stood within the North near Silverymoon.
