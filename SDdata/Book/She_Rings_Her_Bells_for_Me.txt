She Rings Her Bells for Me was a ballad dedicated to a famous courtesan of Athkatla, Tharlaskra of the Bells, penned by Muraevus "Merrysong" Ruroerlar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She Rings Her Bells for Me was written sometime before Muraevus death in the late 14 century DR, immortalizing Tharlaskra for the many melodic bells that chimed with her every move, all attached to the courtesans many piercings.
