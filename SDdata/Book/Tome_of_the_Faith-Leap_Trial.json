Dare you trust your instincts, and navigate her sacred darkness with only your faith to protect you?''|An excerpt from ''Tome of the Faith-Leap Trial''}}",
        "Content": "The purpose of the ''Tome of the Faith-Leap Trial'' was to help young initiates pass the faith-leap trial, which was part of the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] and a right of passage for [[Dark Justiciars]] of the Church. It instructed the acolytes to step into Shar's darkness and be guided by her along a perilous veering path across an invisible bridge. The tome claimed that those whose heart was closed to the Nightsinger were doomed to plummet into the darkness underneath."
