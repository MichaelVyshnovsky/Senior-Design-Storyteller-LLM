        "mainbody": "'''''The Approachable East''''' was a travelogue written by [[Rian Forbeck]], which outlined their travels throughout the [[Unapproachable East]] region of [[Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "The book was printed on notably thin sheets of paper.",
        "Content": {
            "Volume 1": "The adventure of ''The Approachable East'' began, as many of the best stories do, in a simple tavern somewhere in the Realms. It was there that the author Rian Forbeck met a fearsome [[Rashemi]] [[mercenary]], who shared tales about his homeland of [[Rashemen]]. The mercenary then spoke of other lands he had traveled, such as the [[Moonshae Isles]], the [[Silver Marches]], and the [[Plains of Purple Dust]]. Struck by the fact he had never traveled farther away from home than [[Beregost]], Rian began the chronicle of ''The Approachable East'', and set out east along the [[River Chionthar]] towards Rashemen.",
            "Volume 3": "The third volume recounts a story recounted to the author by a band of [[Gur]], with whom he spent some time on the road. Over a [[stew pot|pot of stew]], the Gur told Forbeck a legend of their people's origin. According to the Gur, their people are descended from a pair of rebellious young [[Wychlaran]] whom their elders had turned into [[songbird]]s as punishment for their defiance. The songbirds escaped, and were eventually shown mercy by a [[cleric]] of [[Selûne]], who broke their curse in the name the moon goddess and returned them to their original human form. The Gur, the descendants of these two witches, remain faithful to [[Selûne]]'s teachings and no longer practice the witchcraft of their ancestors, but are still gifted with visions of the future, and some elders even take the title \"maiden\" as a show of respect to their forebears. Forbeck complimented both the tale and the stew, but expressed some skepticism about the historical account, and resolved to investigate the truth of the matter further upon reaching [[Rashemen]].",
            "Volume 4": "The fourth volume described the author's journey to [[Cormyr]]. In particular, Forbeck was impressed by the scale of the city of [[Suzail]], the [[Purple Dragon knight|Purple Dragon Knights]] who patrolled its streets, and the fashion sense of the local nobility. The author expressed his admiration for the fine, exotic goods imported to the markets of [[Suzail]] from the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], including animal [[pelt]]s, [[spice]]s, [[silk]]s and [[fruit]]s. Forbeck was also taken with the Cormyrian reverence of [[cat]]s, proclaiming the prohibition on anti-cat violence as a mark of true civilization.",
            "Volume 6": "The sixth volume of ''The Approachable East'' detailed the author's travels in the lands of [[Thesk]] and along the [[Golden Way]]. They were amazed by the amount and sheer variety of trade goods that went each way along the great trading road.\n\nIt continued with an anecdote where the author met a lone traveler who invited them to visit with the [[Council of Zulkirs]] in [[Thay]]. While the author wished to continue their dream of traveling to Rashemen, they could hardly pass up such a generous offer of hospitality.",
            "Volume 7": "The seventh volume of the book was short and written in an inexplicably laconic manner. The author extolled the virtues of Thay and its people, and exclaimed that visiting Rashemen and [[Kara-Tur]] were no longer of any interest to him. He implored the reader to visit Thay."
