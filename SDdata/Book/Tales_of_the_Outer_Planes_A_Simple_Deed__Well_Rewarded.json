        "Synopsis": "In the [[World Serpent Inn]] in [[Arabel]], a jester tricks the PCs into performing a service for [[Hecate]]. They must secure a hound for her breeding stock from the [[Wild Hunt]]. The players come across the Wild Hunt, guided by the jester again; the Master of the Wild Hunt indicates to them that [[Raven (spirit)|Raven]] has stolen his hunting horn and spear, and that if they're returned, he'll spare a hound. Upon meeting with Raven in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], they discover nothing, but upon exiting they find themselves in [[the Beastlands]], where animals herd them towards Raven, who wants another sphere from [[Enki]]. At [[Mechanus]], Enki is unavailable as he is pining for [[Lliira]], who is currently having difficulty getting out of the palace world [[Zannibar]], where the gods [[Tlazolteotl]] and [[Xochipilli]] keep reign; unable to afford entry, the party must infiltrate the palace, and find the top level, where Lliira is. Lliira reveals that Hecate has cursed her so she may return no man's love, and thus she has exiled herself. Upon informing her that Hecate no longer desires Enki, she is open to being smuggled out, back to the World Serpent Inn.\n\nBack at the inn, the owner, [[Mitchifer]], dispatches messengers to Hecate, the Wild Hunt, Raven, and Enki; the situation is resolved.",
