        "mainbody": "Dansarras Delights was a periodical chapbook published in the city of Riatavin of Tethyr.\nDansarras Delights was inspired by Dansarra, a lippy courtesan and dancer from Amn who was turned undead against her will but continued to practice her craft in the new less-appealing body. By the late 15 century DR, Dansarra was long gone and turned into dust. Still, the aforementioned chapbook adapted her name and bitter, critical attitude to publishing biting reviews of Riatavins restaurants, theatrical performances, and opinions of local public figures."
