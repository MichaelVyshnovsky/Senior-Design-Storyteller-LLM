        "mainbody": "he Nelanther Isles was an aptly named history book dedicated to the so-called Pirate Isles off the Sword Coast, written and published before the Wailing Death crisis of 1372 DR.\nThe first part of the tome detailed the location of the Nelanther Isles, a collection of scattered islands to the west of the Sword Coast. The Nelanther included nearly a thousand small islands sprinkled in the Sea of Swords between the border of Amn and the waters of the Trackless Sea. Some bigger islands, such as Spindrift Town, were lawless ports, while others served no other purpose but to crush reckless ships. These inhabited islands belonged to a wide range of various political powers of Faer√ªn, and some remained independent.\nThe book stated that the growth of trade in the nations of Amn, Waterdeep, Luskan, and other cities, led the scattered islands to become popular sea trade routes, which in turn, attracted piracy. As of the 14 century DR, the Nelanther Isles were home to many pirate vessels, evil worshipers of the Bitch Queen Umberlee, and a violent, dangerous cutthroat culture.\nCopies of The Nelanther Isles book could be found around the areas of Neverwinter, and in Spindrift Town of Nelanther circa 1372 DR."
