        "mainbody": "War in Tethyr by Victor Mil√°n is the second book in the loosely related The Nobles series.\nA young stable hand nicknamed Scab has a dream about flying that turns into a nightmare about falling into a pit with a tentacled, many-eyed monster. She is woken up by a kick from her master and sets to work on the horses, making plans to seek out a wizard for training later in the day in the city of Zazesspur.\nCrossing a hidden pass in the Snowflake Mountains in hopes of avoiding bandits, Countess Zaranda Star returns to Tethyr with a caravan of goods, intending ultimately to sell them in the city of Zazesspur, so that she can pay off her debts and retire. She travels astride her talking horse, Golden Dawn, and is accompanied by Father Pelletyr, a priest of Ilmater, and Vander Stillhawk, a mute human ranger raised by elves. Her caravan is stopped by halfling bandits, demanding a toll, but she and her companions distract them in conversation long enough for the bard Farlorn Half-Elven to harmlessly incapacitate the halflings lying in ambush in the cliffs above them.\nA few days after Greengrass, in the , they arrive at Morninggold Keep.\nThe next day, now on their journey west, the band of travelers come upon a farmstead that has been set ablaze. Zaranda does not hesitate to attack the bandits. The skirmish goes well, until the bandits take Father Pelletyr captive.\nZaranda continues through Ithmong and the villages west of that city, hearing of a new strong government in Zazesspur. A day and a half later, they encounter yet another sign of conflict, a group of peasants surrounding an orog. The orog claims to be a paladin of Torm, renamed Shield of Innocence by the god and sent on a holy quest. After Zaranda talks down the mob and listens to the orcs tale, he kneels before her and claims that she has been sent by Torm for him to serve. The other members of the group have strong apprehensions about this, but Zaranda refuses to judge someone on his race alone and welcomes Shield into her party.\nWhen they arrive outside the city of Zazesspur, Zaranda chooses to take her goods through an old breach in the wall rather than through one of the main gates. No sooner do they enter the city, than they are surrounded by city guards, and it is declared that all their goods are to be impounded by order of the city council.\nFrustrated, Zaranda decides to visit a tavern, where she argues with a former adventuring companion about local politics. A potential bar fight is averted when Father Pelletyr dies of heartstop before Shield is revealed to the tavern patrons as an orog.\nAs they carry Pelletyrs body to the chapter house of his sect, they encounter a mob surrounding Earl Ravenak and cheering him on as he speaks about cleansing the city of foreign races. Further still, they rescue a woman and her baby from a band of \"darklings\"&mdashan orc, a hobgoblin, a duergar, a moon elf, and three humans.\nOnce they reach the chapter house, they learn that Pelletyr had taken an oath to forbid his resurrection. The group can do little but laugh about the irony of Pelletyr taking an oath to make his potential martyrdom more meaningful only to die a meaningless death.\nThat night, Zaranda has strange dreams of a voice summoning her.\nThe next day, she visits an old friend, the armorer Artalos, to ask him his opinion on happenings in the city. They discuss Earl Ravenak and Toby and Poot Hedgeblossom and their political agendas and the danger of the \"darklings\". On her way out, she notices a mage sigil and is told that it belongs to a sorceress named Nyadnar. She is then handed a scrap by a stranger with a scrawled message telling her to meet a one-armed man the next day at the Carpet Mart if she wants back what has been taken from her.\nMeanwhile, the young girl Scab is kicked out of her wizard training for causing magic to happen accidentally without spells.\nElsewhere in the city, Zaranda encounters two young members of the All Friends, worshipers of Ao the Universal.\nThat night, Zaranda continues have strange dreams.\nNow with Scab, whose real name is Chenowyn, following her around and begging to be made an apprentice, Zaranda waits at the Carpet Mart, but the one-armed man is nowhere to be found. She leaves before a fight between local factions erupts. When Zaranda and Chen arrive back, Goldie informs them that soldiers had come to arrest Shield.\nFarlorn returns and is introduced to Chen. He then informs Zaranda that he had visited the Forest of Tethir and learned that the moon elf \"darkling\" woman whom they had earlier slain had been reported missing by her family six weeks ago.\nThat night, Zaranda once again suffers from nightmares and hears voices summoning her. She is startled awake and sees a winged figure at her window.\nAfter this, Zaranda attempts to speed the processing of her case by visiting Duke Alaric Hembreon, the most powerful member of the city council, but he says that there is nothing he can do. While she is there, the dukes daughter, Tatrina is dragged in, having been caught stealing her fathers money to give to the poor children of the city in the name of Ao.\nWhen Zaranda leaves the dukes home, she is arrested by one so-called Shaveli Sword-Master of the civic guard.\nBy afternoon, however, guards are sent to arrest Zaranda once again and arrive at the inn where she has been staying. The innkeeper, however, informs the lieutenant that Zaranda and her companions have left the city.\nA few days later, a caravan of merchants is traveling south on the Trade Way, when it is captured by bandits. Just before the bandit leader kills the leader of the merchants, the bandit is magically put to sleep, and the bandits are surrounded by Zarandas hired crossbowmen. After freeing the caravanners and letting the bandits free with a warning, Zaranda tells both groups to spread the word that Star Company, Protective Services Extraordinaire is ready to take clients.\nStar Company next arrives in the village of Tweyar and offers protection from bandits to the villagers there. She begins training a small group of men and women in a field. When she realizes how much work it will be to train them in archery, she decides to equip them with crossbows, which require less training than shortbows. Shield also lends his aid in training the villagers to fight in groups, and he proves to be better at teaching combat than any of the others. Afterwards, Shield plays with the children of the village, and Zaranda begins to teach Chen some simple spells.\nEight days later, bandits indeed attack Tweyar. The Star Protective Services easily defeat the bandits with their arrows but let the villagers take credit for it. While the villagers dance and Farlorn flirts with the village leaders daughter, Chenowyn looks on with jealously, which in turn makes Zaranda feel jealous and old.\nTwo nights later, Zaranda leads a smaller force to the bandit camp, and the villagers of Tweyar obtain a second victory.\nAs Flamerule nears its end, Zaranda and Goldie return from the village of Pansemil, upriver of Tweyar. The villagers of Tweyar believe that she has betrayed them for offering her services to that village as well and arrest her.\nBy the middle of the month of Eleasias, Zaranda is now training about 40 students from several villages. A little girl discovers a notice that \"Baron Lutwill\" is doubling the villages taxes and that they are due in seven days. Zaranda discusses with the villagers how they wish to respond,\nThe same evening of the day that Baron Lutwill sent out half his soldiers to collect the taxes, Farlorn and Goldie approach the castle from the east, disguised as Fyadros, the Incomparably Wonderful Bard, and Zizzy, the Wonder Horse. \"Fyadros\" convinces Whimberton, the chamberlain of the castle to let them stay the night to entertain the keeps inhabitants. From her lookout point, Zaranda is worried for them. Chen asks again to join Zaranda in the attack, but Zaranda forbids it.\nThirty minutes after midnight, Zarandas band of invaders arrive at the hill where she is waiting with muffled horses, and they ready their attack. The 50 riders charge the last  to the castle. No one spots them. Zaranda crosses the bridge to where a rope hangs from the wall for her, lowered by Farlorn. The invaders raise padded ladders to scale the walls. However, they are spotted, an alarm is raised, and one of her volunteers is struck with a crossbow. Zaranda rushes down to the gate of the keep and uses the knock spell to open the massive door.\nOnce inside, Zaranda fights her way upstairs with her saber and spells. Meanwhile, from higher up, Whimberton uses a magic ball to send lightning bolts on the invaders in the courtyard. Zaranda rushes up to the penthouse, where Lutwill and Whimberton await her. She fights Lutwill, a large man with a double-headed battleaxe, but Whimberton traps her with a holding spell. causing Whimberton to fall through one of the windows to his death, freeing Zaranda from her paralysis and allowing her to cover the barons head with a wolfs pelt and stab him through the face repeatedly.\nTen volunteers die in the battle, but the raiders are victorious. Zaranda finally gives in and spends the night with her former lover Farlorn.\nNearly a year passes, and it is the month of Tarsakh, in the .\nArmenides returns to his quarters and speaks with the brazen head, which is controlled by the One Below, whose name is Lyafv-Afvonn. It demands a report, but Armenides has little to tell. Lyafv-Afvonn demands that Hardisty be made king as soon as possible, so that he can be transformed. The One Below also requests that Tatrina be brought to it, but Armenides explains that she is more useful in her current state. Finally, Armenides asks that Lyafv-Afvonn not send nightmares on the people of Zazesspur that night, instead using its powers to send a long-distance message to someone. Armenides then enjoys a lunch of boiled intestines and organs from babies.\nMeanwhile, in the city of Ithmong, Zaranda walks with Chen along a river walk and gives her an astronomy lesson.\nLater, Zaranda reminisces about the events of the past year, when she hears fighting and rushes to find Chen and Farlorn practicing fencing. This angers Zaranda, who believes that Chen should be studying magic instead. Chen finds this inconsistent, since Zaranda herself is both a wizard and a fighter. Zaranda tells Chen that she cannot keep trying to be just like Zaranda in everything, and this upsets the girl.\nZaranda returns to her room at the Ith-Side Inn and enjoys a bottle of wine gifted to her by the city council of Ithmong. She then falls unconscious.\nZaranda finds herself hanging naked by chains from the ceiling, being whipped by Shaveli. When he finally ceases and leaves, she ponders how she arrived at this cell in the Palace of Governance in Zazesspur and who might have betrayed her.\nIn order of appearance within each category ()\n||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n |||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n |||||||||||||\n ||||\n||||||||||||||||||\n ||||||\n||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n |||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||\n ||||||\n||||||||||\n ||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n ||||\n* The cover art shows Zaranda holding a longsword, while her actual melee weapon was the saber Crackletongue.\n* The blurb on the back of the book refers to the villain as Baron Hardly, which is a misspelling of the actual characters name, Baron Hardisty.\n* Worgs are referred to as \"wargs\" in the novel.\n* On p. 57, it describes lands east of Morninggold as being flatter, even though the characters are clearly west of that county at the time.\n* On p. 91, the book describes Zaranda and her party traveling from the Smiling Centaur through the Wainwright District on the way to the center of the city. This is entirely inconsistent with how the layout of the city was set by the Lands of Intrigue boxed set, which placed the district in the far north of the city and the tavern in the far south of the city. While the novel was written first, this wiki considers sourcebooks higher in the canon, so the \"redistricting\" can be considered a retcon.\n* On p. 193, Baron Lutwill demands that taxes be paid in a week, but weeks are not used in timekeeping on Toril.
