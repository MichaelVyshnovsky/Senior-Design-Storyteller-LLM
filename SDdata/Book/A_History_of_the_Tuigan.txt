'''''Observations of the Tuigan Historian, Recording the Life of Yamun Khahan from his Rise to his Death in the Lands of the West, from Notes made for King Azoun of Cormyr''''', with the tentatively shortened title of '''''A History of the Tuigan''''', was a book written by the [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] in the early 1360s [[DR]]. It was, of course, about the [[Tuigan]] people of the [[Hordelands]].

==History==
Following his ''[[Life among the Tuigan]]'', Koja expanded his notes into his new book, aiming to give a complete account of [[Yamun Khahan]], the Tuigan people, and their history. He wrote much of the book while staying at the [[Temple of Deneir (Procampur)|temple of Deneir]] in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]], and was close to finishing it in the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]].

The temple of Deneir was willing to make copies of the ''History'' and send it to all their fellow temples across the [[Heartlands]]. However, fictionalized accounts of the crusade against the [[Tuigan Horde]], such as ''[[Lay of the Purple Dragons]]'', prompted Koja to attempt to get his work mass-published and widely circulated, to present an honest version to the public, rather than it be buried in temple libraries. To this end, he sought the services of [[Forgemaster]] [[Inkstain]] and his new [[printing press]]. However, Inkstain quoted a price of 10,000 [[golden lion (coin)|gold lion]]s just for one copy, and 500 lions for extras, which Koja was unable to pay or raise the money for, not even after asking Duke [[Jozul Piniago]].

Fortunately, the god [[Deneir]] visited Koja and granted him [[gem]]s worth at least 10,000 gold pieces for the printing costs. Koja planned to have his book printed by Inkstain.

==Contents==
Koja planned to quote a non-magical [[sutra]] from the ''[[Yanitsava]]'' at the beginning, to invoke [[Furo]]'s blessing.
