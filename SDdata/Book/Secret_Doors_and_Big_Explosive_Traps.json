        "mainbody": "'''Secret Doors and Big Explosive Traps''' was a well-produced durable book cataloging various mechanics of secret passages and [[trap]]s, useful to any [[rogue]], published before [[1269 DR]]. The book could survive a hundred years of mold and dampness and still be readable.",
        "History": "A copy of this book was found in the [[Accursed Tower]] of [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1369 DR]] by adventurers searching for the ''[[Diary of Damien Morienus]]''. The book was located in the Tower's library, on the shelf that, in fact, was a secret door itself. When picked up, the book released the mechanism that opened the said door."
