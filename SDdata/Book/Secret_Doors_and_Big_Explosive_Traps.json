        "mainbody": "Secret Doors and Big Explosive Traps was a well-produced durable book cataloging various mechanics of secret passages and traps, useful to any rogue, published before 1269 DR. The book could survive a hundred years of mold and dampness and still be readable.\nA copy of this book was found in the Accursed Tower of Icewind Dale in 1369 DR by adventurers searching for the Diary of Damien Morienus. The book was located in the Towers library, on the shelf that, in fact, was a secret door itself. When picked up, the book released the mechanism that opened the said door."
