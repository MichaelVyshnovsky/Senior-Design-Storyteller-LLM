Theskan Anthology of Goblin Poetry was a simple pamphlet-size chapbook that collected works of poetry by the goblins of Thesk.
The Anthology was filled with many lewd sketches.
In 1492 DR, a copy of Theskan Anthology of Goblin Poetry could be found within the camp of the Cult of the Absolute that took over the Shattered Sanctum, once a temple of Sel√ªne. The followers of the Absolute included numerous goblins.
