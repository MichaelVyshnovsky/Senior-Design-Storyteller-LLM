It is set in the [[Icewind Dale]] and on the [[Reghed Glacier]], and is written by [[AJ Mendez]] and [[Aimee Garcia]], and drawn by [[Martin Coccolo]].\n\n{{Quote|''A never-ending winter night is driving an isolated northern town to the brink of madness. To save them, [[Runa]], [[Saarvin]], [[Patience]], [[Amos]], and [[Belvyre]] must traverse the blighted tundra to find a cure. On the journey, they'll encounter frozen obstacles, unimaginable monsters, and, perhaps most dangerous, dissension in their ranks and the fraying of the bonds of friendship that must sustain them through the dark.''\n\n''Based on the original, massively popular tabletop role-playing game and featuring a brand-new cast of characters, ''Dungeons and Dragons: At the Spine of the World'' is written by New York Times bestselling author AJ Mendez and writer/actor Aimee Garcia! Martin Coccolo (Green Lantern, Star Trek: Year Five) provides stunning art that will have readers feeling the crunch of snow under their boots.''\n\n''Whether you're a veteran dice-slinger or a new visitor to the [[Forgotten Realms]], ''At the Spine of the World'' is a perfect gateway to new adventure.''|IDW Publishing promotional text.}}",
