        "mainbody": "The Knights of Dragon Down was a ballad telling of the fate of seven dragon-slaying knights who were cursed with undeath, composed by the bard Larsheena Taruvel sometime around the 1270s DR. It was a standard of bards of Faer√ªn in the 1360s DR.\nThe Knights of Dragon Down was normally chanted to the accompaniment of a dark and intricate melody played on a harp. However, Elminster noted it could be sung to the tune of a traditional Celtic song of Earth called Down by the Sally Gardens.\nThe final verse was not often sung, except late at night and whispered around a dwindling campfire by the foolish or the foolhardy, for fear it would draw the seven skeleton knights or other undead to them. This verse was even outlawed in Elturel by the  because an evil archmage of the city made it the words of a summoning spell that quickly drew undead to those that sang it.\nHowever, it remained the favorite drinking song of the patrons of the A Pair of Black Antlers tavern in Elturel. It was sung every night, but minstrels had to show the appropriate skill and treatment, playing it with a mournful and macabre tone, lest they earn the patrons ire. The patrons revered the ballad as an anthem to fallen friends, to adventurers still alive, and to the dark whims of gods who demanded to be appeased."
