[[Steve Ellis]] contributed cover art.

{{Quote|''[[Teirflin Armgo|Teirflin]]  and [[Doum'wielle Armgo|Doum'wielle]] are half-[[Drow]] siblings, locked in competition for the ownership of the bloodthirsty sword [[Khazid'hea]]—the Cutter! Their father, the Drow renegade [[Tos'un Armgo|Tos'un]]—a veteran of battles against the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]]—is forced to choose his heir... but what does the powerful sword have to say on the subject?''|Cutter}}
