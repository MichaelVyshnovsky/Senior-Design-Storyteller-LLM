Horselords, by David Cook, is the first book in The Empires trilogy.
Koja, a priest of the Temple of the Red Mountain and emissary of Prince Ogandi Tsipiang of Khazari, travels to meet with Yamun Khahan of the Tuigan. Yamun takes a liking to Koja and conscripts him to be his biographer, declaring he was chosen by Teylas to be emperor of the world. Yamun invades and conquers Semphar and Khazari, but Bayalun, his wife and stepmother, and Chanar Ong Kho, his anda, or blood brother, plot against him, along with Ju-Hai Cho, Kara-Turs Minister of State. The conspiracy attempts to assassinate Yamun, but Koja foils the attempt. Yamun declared him anda and travels to the Dragonwall. Koja discovers and frees the spirit of the Dragonwall, allowing the Tuigan to invade. He also uncovers the treachery of Byalun and Chanar. Yamun imprisons Byalun and demotes Chanar.
