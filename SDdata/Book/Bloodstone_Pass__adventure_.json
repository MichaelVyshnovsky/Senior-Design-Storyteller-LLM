For the region, see Bloodstone Pass.\nBloodstone Pass is a 1st-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure that was later retconned into the Forgotten Realms. It was the first module to feature the Battlesystem tabletop rules.\nBloodstone Pass is an adventure with both a role-playing scenario and Battlesystem combat, in which the town of Bloodstone Pass hires the player characters to organize a defense against an army of evil humanoid monsters. The army also included human renegades led by a powerful assassin. Bloodstone Pass introduced the character of Gareth Dragonsbane and the Order of the Golden Cup, and was later expanded on in the H series of adventure modules.\n* Introduction\n* Chapter 1 The Circus of Doctor Trundles\n* Chapter 2 The Road to Bloodstone\n* Chapter 3 The Village of Bloodstone\n* Chapter 4 Preparations for War\n* Chapter 5 The Bloodstone War\n* Chapter 6 The War Ends\n* Maps\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  (, ) • dragon (, ) •  •  •  •  •  •  •  (, ) •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nBodies of Water  • \nBuildings  • \nMountains \nNations  () • \nSettlements  • \nValleys \n •  • \nItems  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPotions  •  • \nSpells  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \n • \nBooks \nEvents \nFood & Drinks  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPlants \nWeapons \nBecause the adventure was not originally written as set in the Forgotten Realms setting, certain elements do not fit with later canon, such as Tanaroo calling the circus \"the greatest show on Oerth\", or mention of a sea route into Vaasa.\nBloodstone Pass Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Design & Editing Michael Dobson, Douglas Niles\n* Graphic Design John C.
