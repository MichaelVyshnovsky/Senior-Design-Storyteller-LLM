{{quote|'''''A challenge of wits and reason'''''

''A legendary "frontier" corner of the [[Forgotten Realms]], the [[Border Kingdoms]] are where adventurers come to carve out their own kingdom, flee retribution, hide treasure - or find someone else's treasure.''

''It is a hodgepodge of tiny realms ruled by kings, grand viziers, imperial overdukes, and all manner of cabals, councils, and self-titled nobles. It's full of ruins, folk who want to stay hidden, long-slumbering secrets and adventures waiting to happen.''

''The Border Kingdoms is a valuable resource for Dungeon Masters and players alike. In addition to describing the people and places of the Border Kingdoms, this book contains adventurer hooks enough to lure and keep busy any adventuring party for years.''

''For use with the fifth edition [[Player's Handbook 5th edition|Player's Handbook]], [[Monster Manual 5th edition|Monster Manual]], and [[Dungeon Master's Guide 5th edition|Dungeon Master's Guide]], this book provides the setting, overarching adventure plots, and character backgrounds needed to participate in a D&D game anywhere in the Border Kingdoms.''
