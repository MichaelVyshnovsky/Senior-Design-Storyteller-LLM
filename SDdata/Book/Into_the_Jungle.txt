'''''Into the Jungle''''' is a gamebook in the ''[[Endless Quest]]'' series. Slated for release in September 2018, it is set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' and focuses on the [[cleric]] class.

{{Quote|Welcome to the Forgotten Realms Endless Quest books, where you don't just read a fantastic tale. You ''become'' the hero — and choose your own fate.

The Harpers have lost one of their own, a legendary adventurer named Artus Cimber, keeper of the artifact known as the Ring of Winter. They've hired you to travel to the jungle-clad land of Chult to find him. If only you can manage to find Cimber before the frost giants do — or the zombies that infest the land get you first. You’re in the jungle now, cleric.}}
