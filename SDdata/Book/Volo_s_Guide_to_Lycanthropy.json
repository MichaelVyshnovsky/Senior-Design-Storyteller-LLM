        "History": "Sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1493}},The character profile of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] states his age to be 196 years old. Seeing as how he was born in [[1297 DR]] (''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', p. 132), ''Idle Champions'' must be set in 1493 DR. That being said, the developers have stated they intentionally keep the game's timeline vague, to allow them to pick and choose the characters (or character ''versions'') they want. a group of [[adventurer]]s entered the [[Neverwinter Woods]] in search of a missing woman by the name [[Kara Bakovski]]. They encountered the hunter [[Randal Amberwood]], who informed them that he had tracked beasts down to the abandoned temple. Once they made it to the temple the adventurers found Kara in the company of a [[werewolf]] and moved to attack it, but she yelled at them to stop and explained that the beast was her fianc√©. Introducing himself as [[Pavel Nonov]], the werewolf expressed a desire to be cured of his lycanthropy. After expressing that they would need a [[scroll]] of ''[[remove curse]]'', Pavel suggested the group might be able to find something in the temple's disorganized library. They rummaged through its shelves a bit, finding a copy of ''Volo's Guide to Lycanthropy'', but were then attacked by its [[unnamed weretiger librarian|weretiger caretaker]]."
