Compiling and updating monsters that originally appeared in previous D&D fifth edition releases, these creatures represent some of the most benevolent and malevolent forces that D&D heroes might face.''\n \n''The book also gathers together fantastical peoples from many different worlds. Each of these peoples represents a race option when you create your D&D character, expanding on the choices in the Player’s Handbook.''\n \n''• Includes more than 250 monsters—updates to the monsters include making spellcasters easier for Dungeon Masters to run, giving many monsters more damage and resilience, and improving the organization of the stat blocks themselves''\n\n''• Includes more than 30 playable races—brings the game’s setting-agnostic races into one book, complementing the races in the Player’s Handbook''\n\n''• A multiverse of lore—includes updates to monster lore that refocuses their stories on the D&D multiverse, rather than on any particular world ''}}",
        "Description": "Originally released as part of the ''Dungeons & Dragons Rules Expansion Gift Set'', it was later published as a standalone edition.
