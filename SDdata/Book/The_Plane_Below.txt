{{Quote|''A hotbed of adventure opportunities awaits you in the roiling maelstrom of the [[Elemental Chaos]] â€” a plane of [[titan]]s, [[elemental]]s, [[genie]]s, [[slaad]]s, and [[demons]]. This game supplement builds on the overview of the Elemental Chaos presented in the [[Manual of the Planes]] game supplement and explores the tumultuous plane is greater detail. From the City of Brass to the githzerai monastery of Zerthadlun to the spiraling depths of the [[Abyss]], adventure lurks behind every lava waterfall, across every icy battlefield, and beyond every raging lightning storm.

This game supplement describes the Elemental Chaos in detail, featuring key locations throughout the plane. It also presents a multitude of new monsters, mighty [[primordials]], and powerful [[demons]], as well as adventure hooks, encounters, hazards, and everything Dungeon Masters need to make the Elemental Chaos a featured setting in their campaigns.
