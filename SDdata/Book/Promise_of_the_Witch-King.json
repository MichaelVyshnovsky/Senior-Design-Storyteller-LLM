        "Summary": "In [[Damara]], Artemis and Jarlaxle battle and kill a [[lich]] named [[Herminicle]] in an animated tower while barely escaping with their lives. The companions then  travel to [[Vaasa]] at the request of their employers, [[Tazmikella]] and [[Ilnezhara]]. They seek artifacts of the infamous lich [[Zhengyi]]. A [[half-orc]] named [[Arrayan_Faylin| Arrayan]] finds her way to an ancient tome of Zhengyi and unwittingly starts a self-creating castle, one similar to Zhengyi's former [[Castle Perilous]], to come into existence. \n\nWith her health continually being drained, Arrayan joins with a group to destroy the castle. The group consists of Artemis, Jarlaxle, Arrayan, [[Olgerkhan]], [[Mariabronne]], [[Ellery Dragonsbane]], [[Canthan Doolittle|Canthan]], [[Athrogate]], and [[Pratcus]], as well as a few others. The group battles [[gargoyle]]s, [[golem]]s, [[mummy|mummies]], and animated [[skeleton]]s in an attempt to keep the heart of the castle, the tome. The group go to find the true \"king\" of the castle as Herminicle was the tower's \"king\", know that killing the king will halt the continuing creation of the castle but preserving it as well. They go down through tunnels until reaching the [[dracolich]], [[Urshula]]. They battle the dracolich ferociously with Jarlaxle bringing dead [[human]]s back to life, with a human skull artifact recovered from Herminicle's tower, to fight against Urshula and Artemis dealing the final blow. The surviving companions return to the near towns to many cheers and many questions.",
