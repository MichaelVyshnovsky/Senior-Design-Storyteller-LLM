'''''Zikran's Zephyrean Tome''''' was a mysterious book by [[Zikran]], a [[water genasi]] [[wizard]] and expert on the [[Inner Planes]]. It was held in [[Candlekeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
[[Adventurer]]s seeking shelter from a storm that was apparently following them everywhere gave ''Zikran's Zephyrean Tome'' to Candlekeep. Despite being unable to open the book, a junior member of the [[Avowed]] classified it as a dissertation on the Inner Planes based only on Zikran's standing as an authority in the field. Thereafter, the book migrated through the archives as each Avowed, finding they were simply unable to unlock it, could only guess as to what it was about. They eventually gave up trying.

==Description==
It was a hefty tome with white [[marble]] covers that were bound in light-blue [[leather]]. The book was sealed with a big padlock that could not be unlocked with [[magic]] and only opened on its own accord when the person carrying it decided to take it out of Candlekeep. The pages were white paper that were as thin as tissue; they numbered 108 and were mostly blank. Each time a page was turned, a gentle breeze was released.

==Contents==
The entity trapped inside the book, a [[djinni]] by the name of [[Gazre-Azam]], was made clear when the book was first opened.

Zikran had attempted to trap a djinni in the book multiple times before being successful, as evidenced by the various notes he made in the book's first ten pages. The eight pages that followed were observations of Gazre Azam's actions while under Zikran's control.
