"The Ghost of Harrow Hill" is a short adventure module for beginner players set in the Dalelands, where they face a haunted mansion. It was accompanied by a CD with recorded dialogue.
The players stop for the night at a haunted mansion, where the ghost of the wizard Gunter Weiss demands they give up one of their own so that he may take their bodies for his own or he shall slay them all. Refusing, the players must find his cursed silver heart and use it to destroy him before midnight, or else he shall steal their bodies.
