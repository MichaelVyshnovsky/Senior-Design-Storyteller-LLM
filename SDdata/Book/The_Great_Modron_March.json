        "mainbody": "'''''The Great Modron March''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure module. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|'''''THE NEXT MARCH WASN'T DUE FOR ANOTHER 189 YEARS. TRY TELLING THAT TO THE MODRONS!'''''\n \n''On a regular schedule, the Great Modron March spills out of [[Mechanus]], and the lawful automatons files their way around the Great Ring. No one knows why they do it, but everyone stays out of their way - because when the [[modron]]s march, they'll walk right over a berk who doesn't know enough to move aside.''\n \n''But this March has started decades before it was supposed to begin, and that's even more of a mystery. Caught unprepared, the planes shudder under the modrons' collective footsteps - and even the modrons themselves seem a little out of sorts.''\n \n''The Great Modron March anthology features 11 adventures for characters ranging from 1st to 10th level, as well as new information about the modrons of Mechanus. Each adventure can be played separately or linked together to form an extended campaign. The modron procession touches every [[Outer Plane]] in turn - and it isn't always welcome. On their unswerving path, the clockwork creatures will destroy celestial towns, be attacked by evil knights intent on using modron parts in foul experiments, and lead characters onto the deadly plains of the [[Abyss]] and into the famous prime-material labyrinth of [[Undermountain]]. Without help, they'll be lost in the swirling chaos of [[Limbo]] or even fail to complete the March entirely.''\n \n''And along their route, every blood on the planes seeks the answer to the most important question: Why have the Modrons abandoned their normal, lawful schedule to march years before they're due? ''}}",
