The '''''Book of Eons''''' was an important tome that recorded a grand history of the [[elves]] on [[Toril]].

==Description==
This massive book measured {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} wide and {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} long when closed and weighed {{SI|200|lbs|long=yes}}. Each page was illuminated by hand with vivid colors and fantastic imagery. The exterior of the book was bound in [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[electrum]].

==Usage==
The book provided vast wisdom to any who read it. Mages who read the book found that their attempts at creating [[magic item]]s succeeded more often after reading the ''Book of Eons''. Any elf who read the book, a feat which would take well over a year of continuous study, would find enough useful information to increase their skills in their chosen profession.
