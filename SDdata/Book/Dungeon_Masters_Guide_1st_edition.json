        "Description": "The ''Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition'' was the original Dungeon Master's Guide for the AD&D game, authored by [[Gary Gygax]] and first published in August 1979. Note that unlike other publications from future editions which were entitled \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (such as ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 3rd edition]]'' or ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 3.5]]''), this book's title lacks the apostrophe.\n\nThe ''Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition'' covered the essential game rules for the Dungeon Master: creating and managing both player characters and non-player characters, directing combat, and handling adventures and campaigns that last multiple sessions. The book also included game statistics for magic items and treasure, details how to use random monster encounters, and provides statistics for some of the basic monsters and creatures of the game. New magic items were introduced. It contains scores of tables and charts for figuring damage and resolving encounters in a typical adventure, tables and rules for creating characters, and lists of the various abilities of the different classes of characters. \n\nA feature of the ''Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition'' was the random dungeon generator. The generator allowed the Dungeon Master, by the rolling of dice, to generate a dungeon adventure \"on the fly\". A dungeon complete with passageways, rooms, treasure, monsters, and other encounters could easily and randomly be constructed as the player progressed. It could be used with several people or a single player.",
        "History": {
            "First print": "The first printing of the Dungeon Masters Guide had a print run of around 40,000 copies. It was first made available at [[Wikipedia:Gen Con|Gen Con]] XII on 16â€“19 August 1979.{{Cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/dmg.html|title=Dungeon Masters Guide|publisher=The Acaeum|accessdate=2008-04-20}}",
            "Second print, alpha": "In August 1979, an edition of the Dungeon Masters Guide was printed which accidentally contained sixteen pages from the fourth printing of the ''[[Monster Manual 1st edition]]''.{{Cite book|title=Collectible Toys & Values|author=Harold Johnson|year=1994|publisher=Meyer}} A recall was issued quickly and the error was corrected, but a few copies of this printing are still in circulation.",
            "Second print, beta": "Between August and September 1979, the corrected version of the second print was sold. The original covers from the second print alpha were recycled to create this print, making it recognizable.",
            "Third print": "The third print of the Dungeon Master Guide occurred between September and November 1979. The boxing machine used for this printing had a loose wire, causing half of the books to have a deep score mark on the cover. This \"alpha\" print was recalled, the scored copies were removed, and it was sent out again. It is believed that the non-scored copies became the \"beta\" print. [http://www.acaeum.com The Acaeum] believes that the \"gamma\" print was created from the scored copies, whose covers were replaced.",
            "Fourth and fifth print": "The Acaeum speculates that the fourth print might have been created from books left over from the third print alpha. In the fifth print, a number of minor changes were made to the book's cover.",
            "Sixth to ninth print": "The sixth print (December 1979) introduced six additional numbered pages, increasing the total from 232 to 238, some text was revised, images removed and a reference section added.\n\nFrom the December 1979 printing:\n{{Quote|''\"all the information you need to referee your ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS<sup>&reg;</sup> game is in this book\"''\n\n''Whether you're running a single adventure or masterminding a complete campaign, the Dungeon Masters Guide is the absolute best source for information. There's no need to ''guess'' the rules. You'll learn spells, monsters, travel, magic lists, and combat rules.''}}",
            "Subsequent prints": "In 1983 the book was again reprinted but this time, the cover art was altered. The book was printed again many times, and print information began appearing within the book from 1985 onwards. By July 1990, the book had reached its fourteenth print. The ''Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition'' was reproduced as a premium reprint on July 17, 2012."
