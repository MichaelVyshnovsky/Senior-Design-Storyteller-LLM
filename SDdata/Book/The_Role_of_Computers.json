It was followed by a review section, which gave reviews and basic walkthroughs of 3-5 games. The next section was called Game Conversions, which would provide industry updates and news on upcoming computer games. The final section was Clue Corner, where readers would mail in hints and tips on gameplay.\n__TOC__\nNote that only articles relating to Realms canon (relating to the Forgotten Realms or Core D&D) appear here."
