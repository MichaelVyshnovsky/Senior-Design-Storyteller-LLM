        "mainbody": "The Titan of Twilight by Troy Denning is book three in The Twilight Giants trilogy.\nWhen pregnant Queen Brianna of Hartsvale is in the Gorge of the Silver Wyrm to grant a blessing to one of Earl Radborne Wynns new silver mines, she finds her entourage under attack from a band of fire giants. Her high scout and husband Tavis Burdun and the Company of the Royal Snow Bear risk their lives defending her.\nFirbolgs from Meadowhome arrive, led by Raeyadfourne and the seer Galgadayle. They battle with the fire giants but attempt to kidnap Brianna, believing Galgadayles prophecy that her child would break destruction to both humans and giant-kin. Avner stabs Galgadayle in the back, causing him to drop Brianna, but in his thrashing, he accidentally tramples Earl Radborne to death. Avner and six of her surviving riders carry Brianna uphill to the relative safety of a mine called the Silver Duchess.\nWithin the opening of that mine, Brianna struggles to give birth, and Avner is forced to cut the child from her womb with a knife before the firbolgs are able to locate them again.\nTavis wakes up to find himself, badly injured, at the bottom of the gorge after a fire giant had kicked him.\n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •"
