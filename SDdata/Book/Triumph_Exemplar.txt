Triumph Exemplar was a famous historical record of ancient Netherils wars.
The book possessed beaten gold covers with platinum edging, and was hand-lettered in the Loross language.
Triumph Exemplar contained extensive accounts of Netherils wars and conflicts. One such chronicle was the legendary Last Stand at Humaithira, the brutal battle between Strategor Matick Netherese army and the invading giants of Thane Blóta of Skammháls. Though Matick was slain and his army destroyed, he inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and won time for reinforcements to gather and later defeat the giants.
Published in 221 DR, Triumph Exemplar and its accounts of Strategor Matick were a foundational text to be read at Cormyrs Academy of Lords during the 4 century DR.
