        "mainbody": "olyhedron UK was an official publication of the Role Playing Gamers Association (RPGA) in the UK.\nThe magazine was published quarterly from 1998 to 2000. It was later merged with Polyhedron Newszine.\nNotably, every issue until the final one had a thin red strip at the bottom of the magazine cover where a message was written encyphered using a fictional alphabet from the Forgotten Realms Issues 1 and 2 used Espruar, while the issues 3 through 7 used Dethek runes instead. These messages were often nonsensical and appear to be intended as jokes.\nOnly issues containing adventures or articles from the Forgotten Realms setting are found on the wiki."
