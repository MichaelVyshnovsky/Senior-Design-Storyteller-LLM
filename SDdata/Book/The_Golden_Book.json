        "mainbody": "The Golden Book was a book filled with propaganda of Matagar Bugo after his ascendance to the title of the Duke of Daggerford circa 1372 DR\nThe book described in detail Matagars plans for turning Daggerford into a prosperous gem of a city rivaling Waterdeep. He cited Daggerfords location right on the trade routes from River Delimbiyr and the Trade Way being the citys untapped potential. He blamed the citys previous leaders on Daggerford not reaching its potential and being just a place for farmers to peddle their goods. He praised himself as a visionary who was going to make Daggerford great. Bugo proclaimed that with the new tax increase the city was able to afford larger military on top of the newly formed and funded Griffons Mercenary Company, which he hoped would eclipse the Flaming Fist of Baldurs Gate. The tax increase would also finance larger docks for the new naval force. He praised his taxation and Griffons for the upcoming security of the caravans and asked citizens to have faith in the golden outlook.\nIn 1372 DR, after Duke Pwylls death, the citys leadership was taken over by a wealthy merchant and member of the city council, Matagar Bugo. The ambitious new duke wrote this book to educate the citizens on his grand plans for Daggerford.\nThe book was sold at the entrance to Daggerfords Ducal Castle for 1 gp, by a young girl claiming it was inspirational."
