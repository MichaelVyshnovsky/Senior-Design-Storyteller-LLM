        "mainbody": "'''The Golden Book''' was a book filled with propaganda of [[Matagar Bugo]] after his ascendance to the title of the Duke of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]",
        "Contents": "The book described in detail Matagar's plans for turning Daggerford into a prosperous gem of a city rivaling [[Waterdeep]]. He cited Daggerford's location right on the trade routes from [[River Delimbiyr]] and the [[Trade Way]] being the city's untapped potential. He blamed the city's previous leaders on Daggerford not reaching its potential and being just a place for farmers to peddle their goods. He praised himself as a visionary who was going to make Daggerford great. Bugo proclaimed that with the new tax increase the city was able to afford larger military on top of the newly formed and funded [[Griffons Mercenary Company]], which he hoped would eclipse the [[Flaming Fist]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The tax increase would also finance larger docks for the new naval force. He praised his taxation and Griffons for the upcoming security of the caravans and asked citizens to have faith in the golden outlook.",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, after [[Pwyll Daggerford|Duke Pwyll's]] death, the city's leadership was taken over by a wealthy merchant and member of the city council, Matagar Bugo. The ambitious new duke wrote this book to educate the citizens on his grand plans for Daggerford.",
        "Availability": "The book was sold at the entrance to Daggerford's [[Ducal Castle]] for 1 gp, by a young girl claiming it was inspirational."
