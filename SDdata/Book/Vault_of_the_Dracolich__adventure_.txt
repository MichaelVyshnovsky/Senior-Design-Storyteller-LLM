'''''Vault of the Dracolich''''' was an adventure module for the D&D Game Day in June 2013, for the 5th edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

{{Quote|''Deep in the forest of [[Cormanthor]] lies the hoard of the [[dracolich]] [[Dretchroyaster]], the prize of which is a diamond staff rumored to unlock the secrets of an ancient elven kingdom. The sage [[Imani]] is seeking dozens of adventurers to launch an all-out assault on the undead dragon's lair. The dracolich is a powerful foe - too great for even several parties to conquer - so it's going to take all of the heroes' courage, cunning, and speed to survive the dracolich's deadly vault.''

''Vault of the Dracolich is a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] Roleplaying Game adventure designed for the June 2013 D&D Game Day. The challenge draws inspiration from the interactive format used at some gaming conventions.''}}
