        "mainbody": "lack Wolf by Dave Gross is the fourth book of the Sembia Gateway to the Realms series. \nIn the month of Hammer of 1371 DR, Darrow, a carriage driver in Selgaunt working for Radu Malveen, encounters the werewolf Rusk a cleric of Malar, who forces Darrow to bring him to Radu. Darrow witnesses a meeting between Rusk, Radu, and Stannis Malveen, an aquatic vampire who carries a burning hatred for House Uskevren. They discuss Rusk’s failed attempt to kill Talbot Uskevren, which cost the werewolf an arm. Radu disapproves of the plot, worrying it will endanger Laskar and Pietro, their brothers. Still, Rusk demands scrolls from Stannis, which he calls the Black Wolf scrolls. Radu intends to kill Darrow, but Stannis takes him as a servant.\nMeanwhile, Talbot discusses his lycanthropy with Feena Archwood and her mother Maleva, both clerics of Selûne, as well as his servant Eckhart and his friend Chaney Foxmantle. Talbot overhears them arguing about if he is the “Black Wolf.”\nAs time passes, Darriow sees prisoners being kept in the ruined House Malveen as unwilling sparring partners for Radu. One of the prisoners is a woman named Maelin. Stannis tells Darrow how House Malveen fell due to his mother Velanna, associating with pirates, and that Thamalon Uskevren refused to help Velanna. Velanna called on a vampire, who killed and converted Stannis. Later, Radu found them, slaying the vampire to free Stannis but keeping him hidden in the River Hall, the ruined former estate of the Malveen.\nIn Alturiak, Talbot meets with Thazienne Uskevren, still wounded after shadows attacked Stormweather Towers. He then begins to research werewolves, Selune, and Malar, and in Tarsakh, sets off for Yhaunn to visit Dhauna Myritar at Moonshadow Hall. Chaney accompanies him after Talbot saves him from some criminals. Talbot realizes his friend has become entangled with crime, but doesn’t press for details. Dhauna tells Talbot that the Black Wolf is a heresy of the church of Selune but doesn’t explain more.\nMeanwhile, Darrow accompanies Rusk and Radu into the Arch Wood to meet with Rusk’s pack. Talbot continues to perform at Madame Quickly’s theater, the Wide Realms, alongside fellow actors Mallion, Sivana, and Ennis. Darrow is chosen as the victim of a High Hunt by Rusk’s pack and the People of the Black Blood, as Radu still considered him a loose end. \nFeena begins teaching Talbot to control his transformation into a vampire. Talbot begins taking his sword lessons more seriously, but is forced to leave after accidentally injuring another student. He then discovers the other actors have learned of his lycanthropy from Quickly. In the Arch Wood, Darrow is converted into a werewolf by Rusk after being caught during the hunt. He meets the rest of the pack, the strongest of which include Sorcia, Ronan, Karneck, and Brigid. Darrow sees Rusk meet with Maleva, who is protecting the nearby villagers from his pack. Back at the Wide Realms, the other actors ask Talbot for sword training, and he agrees. He encounters a masked figure who battles him while asking for information. Talbot catches the figure, but releases her when he realizes she is Shamur Uskevren, his mother, wondering why he has distanced himself from the rest of the family.\nIn winter of 1372 DR, Darrow overhears Rusk commune with Malar, learning that he has the spirit of the Black Wolf, but due to his missing arm, needs Talbot’s body as vessel. Rusk and his pack kill Maleva and move into Selgaunt. Darrow, Sorcia, Ronan, Karneck, and Brigid infiltrate the Wide Realms and provoke Talbot with various taunts, including the fact that Rusk killed Maleva. Talbot turns into wolf-form, mortally wounding Ronan and exposing his werewolf state. Talbot is arrested, and Darrow overhears Radu force Eckhart to give up the money for bail. Darrow realizes Maelin is Eckhart’s daughter and has been kept as a hostage. Radu nearly kills Eckhart, but Feena arrives and saves him. She learns of the plot and breaks Talbot out, revealing herself to be a werewolf as well, and the two escape the city and make love.\nDarrow tries to negotiate for Maelin’s safety, having formed some attachment to her, but ends up turning Stannis and the werewolves against him. Talbot tells Feena of Maleva’s death, and he realizes that Rusk is her father. They theorize that the Black Wolf is perhaps a state of being, control over a werewolf form, not a prophesied individual. When sneaking back into the city, Talbot encounters Larajin. After Thamalon scolded him for speaking to her, Tabot assumed she was his mistress, but Larajin is infuriated and explains that she is actually his daughter. Talbot agrees to keep the truth secret for now. \nDarrow joins Talbot and Feena at the Wide Realms, where they have gathered along with Quickly, Chaney, and the other actors, armed with silvered weapons. The pack attacks. During the battle, Quickly and Rusk are killed. Darrow realizes that Rusk manipulated him to warn Talbot, and that Rusk wanted to be killed from the start. Rusk’s spirit tries to possess Talbot, but Feena’s magic shields him, and he is dissolved in moonlight. The pack bows to Talbot, who orders them to leave the city.\nTalbot, Feena, Darrow, and Chaney set off for the Malveen estate to confront Stannis and Radu. Chaney is killed in the battle, and both Malveen brothers are wounded. When Stannis begins to blame Pietro and Laskar for the plot, Radu kills Stannis with an enchanted dagger, causing a magical explosion that kills both Malveens. The group rescue Maelin.\nStannis is arrested and turned over to the church of Selune. Eckhart is reunited with his daughter, but Talbot fires her. Talbot takes ownership of the Wide Realms and moves back into Stormweather Towers, reuniting with his family. Finally, Talbot realizes he cannot keep his relationship with Feena a secret from his family for long, and makes her a proposition."
