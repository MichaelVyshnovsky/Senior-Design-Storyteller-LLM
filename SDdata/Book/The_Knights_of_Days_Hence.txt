{{quote|Ahh, but there is some truth in everything, is there not? I cannot attest to the validity of the tale itself, as I have only culled from hearsay. I only know for certain that it makes for good patronage when I pass my hat. Strikes a chord with many, it does.|Poe the Bard}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Poe ventured onto the Firewine Bridge, laid to ruins some two centuries prior. He strove to write an epic song about the ghost knights and the old dungeon underneath the ruins. He would recite the poem to any adventurers whom he encountered on the bridge's ruins.
