'''''Infernal Contracts and Bargains''''' was a guide dedicated to what contracts and which [[devil]]s were the most compatible with eachother, penned and published sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Remember, devils are not only fiends - they're bastards. I once knew a man who asked for ultimate protection against his enemies from a devil of [[Dispater]]. He was transported into an impregnable iron fortress deep underground: one without doors. So, pick and choose with caution, friends.''|Excerpt from ''Infernal Contracts and Bargains''}}

==Contents==
The [[book]] warned the readers of the dangerous nature of [[infernal contract]]s and advised them the exercise utmost vigilance when dealing with the creatures from the [[lower planes]] as they were prone to twisting and misinterpreting wishes of the mortals. The author recommended the reader to deal with the devils of [[Minauros]] when making money-related contracts and the devils of [[Phlegethos]] when making pain-and-pleasure-related contracts.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, several copies of the tome could be found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. One book was stored in the library of the [[Open Hand Temple]] of [[Ilmater]] and in the basement of [[Franc Peartree]]'s house in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]].
