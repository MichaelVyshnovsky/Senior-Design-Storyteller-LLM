Sarturls Study of Magical Fields was an academic magic textbook written by the Netherese arcanist Sarturl.
The book contained meticulously complete examinations and comparisons of magical effects that took up a physical volume of space. It was exhaustively detailed and precise, but Sarturl did not craft engaging prose and the book was terrifically dry to read. As an example of the depth of knowledge that Sarturl provided, an entire page was devoted to describing the smell of an active antimagic field.
Sarturls Study of Magical Fields was considered a classic and foundational piece of academia by the arcanists of Netheril during the Age of Discovery ( onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy of it, along with other works such as Ivrynxras Exploration of Enchantments, Haerros Veltanabula, Oloams on Serpentine Matters, and Skouloonds Spell Studies.
