        "mainbody": "ightwatch in the Living City is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module for the Forgotten Realms.\nNightwatch in the Living City is an adventure module based on a tournament scenario originally conceived and executed within the Role Playing Game Association Network.\nThe adventure is designed for characters of various levels, providing a versatile scenario that can be adjusted to fit different party strengths and compositions. It focuses on the Nightwatch, a group responsible for maintaining order and safety in Ravens Bluff during the nighttime hours. The players characters are either members of the Nightwatch or become involved with them, tasked with navigating the complexities of urban adventures and the unique challenges posed by the citys nocturnal activities.\nThe adventure is designed with narrative frameworks and Dungeon Master guidance to transition the player characters from one scene to the next. However, each scene affords both players and DM the latitude to employ diverse strategies for conflict resolution. The entirety of the modules events unfolds over the course of a single night within the setting. The structure of the adventure is akin to a flow chart, comprising a sequence of interconnected episodes that build towards a minor climax, culminating in a significant action-oriented climax that concludes the narrative.\nThe module includes detailed descriptions of locations, NPCs, and potential plot hooks.\nThe player characters journey to the city of Ravens Bluff, driven by aspirations of achieving renown and wealth. To pursue these ends, they have enlisted with the City Guard, specifically within the night-watch patrols.\n* Introduction\n* The Adventure\n* Pregenerated Characters\n* Appendix\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n|ref   =\n •  •  • cat •  •  •  •  • dog •  • drow • dwarf •  •  •  • half-elf • halfling •  • human • horse •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • rat •  • scrag •  •  •  •  •  • \n|ref   =\nBodies of Water  •  • \nBuildings  •  •  •  •  • \nCountries  • \nDungeons \nMountains \nIslands \nSettlements  •  •  • \nClothing  •  •  •  • \nJewelry  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPotions  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSpells  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nArt & Literature  •  • \nArmor & Clothing  •  •  • \nFood & Drinks  •  •  •  •  •  • \nDrugs \nGames  • \nItems  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMaterials & Substances  •  •  •  •  •  • \nNatural Phenomena \nProfessions \nTitles  • \nVegetation \nVessels \nWeapons  • \nNightwatch in the Living City Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Written by Walter M.
