'''''City of Gold''''' is a combined sourcebook and adventure module for 2nd-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', set in a new area of the [[Maztica]] setting.

{{Quote|''Somewhere in the True World, to the north of the lands you know, lies the City of Gold: [[Michaca]]. It is a city of legend, of fable, and of wonder. The journey is hard, and the perils are many; you know, however, that the rewards will far outshine any treasure you have ever seen.''

''This supplement for the [[Maztica Campaign Set|Maztica Campaign Setting]] is a new type of product: a combination adventure and accessory. In this booklet you will find information on a new character race, the [[Azuposi]]; on new character classes for [[rogue]]s, including the clown (or [[koyemshi]]s); on new priest classes, including the "[[bent priest]]"; and a new magic unique to Maztica, [[fetishism]].''

''The adventure itself leads your party from the known areas of the True World into the northlands, through the lands of the [[desert dwarf|desert dwarves]], the [[Poscadar elf|Poscadar elves]], the [[Dog People]], and others. Your characters will deal with desert hardships they have never endured before. They will also confront spirits they've never heard of: the spirits that have caused the downfall of Michaca, the City of Gold.''

''And do not forget the words of a poet of another place, and another time: "Nor all that tempts your wand'ring eyes / And heedless hearts, is lawful prize; / Nor all, that glisters, gold."''}}
