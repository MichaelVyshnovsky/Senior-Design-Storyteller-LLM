'''''Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts''''' was an extensive anthropology [[book]] on [[lycanthropes]] and [[lycanthropy]], primarily as they pertained to the [[Domains of Dread]], that was written by the famed monster hunter [[Rudolph van Richten]].
{{Quote|As I draw to the close of this treatise, I must admit that the studying the lycanthrope has been most disturbing. For all my condemnation of these monsters, I must pause a moment and reflect upon the reality of the beast within me. The werebeast kills because killing is what it instinctively does. It has no agenda, no point to prove, no hatred to vent. On the other side, I have no need to kill at all, instinctively or otherwise, yet I have pursued that objective with righteous tenacity. We are both predators, yet who is the more monstrous?|Van Richten gets introspective as he nears the end of his guide.<ref>}}

==Description==
Divided into five chapters,<ref> the book covered a wide variety of topics on true lycanthropes, as well as lycanthropy as either a [[disease]] or [[curse]], with van Richten dubbing the latter two "pathologic lycanthropy" and "maledictive lycanthropy". It went into great detail highlighting the similarities and differences between the three types, as well as how one might remove the curse, detect an infection, or become cured of the disease while in Ravenloft (as doing so was a far more difficult task there than on the [[Prime Material]]). The book also detailed the differences between types of lycanthropes,<ref> which Van Richten referred to in the text as "phenotypes" on account of having been introduced to the term by a sage from another world.<ref> The final chapter devoted its pages to detailing how one might go about identifying, tracking, hunting down, and killing lycanthropes.<ref>

In its introduction, van Richten notably detailed his first encounter with a lycanthrope at the age of 39 in the domain of [[w:c:ravenloft:Darkon|Darkon]], noting that up until then he had believed them to be mere legends and that three [[Sembian]]s went missing trying to track down its victims.<ref>

Due to van Richten's admitted difficulty with researching lycanthropes, parsing truth from mere fables and legends, authoritatively asserting that no lycanthropes exemplifying herbivorous animals existed, though [[werebison]] and [[werestag]]s could be found on [[Toril]]; and asserting that [[giant]]s were immune to lycanthropy,<ref> though there were some instances of it on Toril, like the [[ettin]] [[werebat]] [[Sina and Mesrak]].{{Cite dungeon/137/Man Forever|78}}
