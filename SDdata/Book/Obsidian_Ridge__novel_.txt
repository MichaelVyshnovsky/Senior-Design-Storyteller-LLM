'''''Obsidian Ridge''''' by [[Jess Lebow]] is the second book in the [[The Citadels]] series.

{{quote|''Nothing is beyond the reach of the [[Obsidian Ridge]].''

No one has laid eyes on the Obsidian Ridge in over a century. The floating mountain is a legend, lost in the dustiest tomes… until it appears as if from nowhere over the kingdom of [[Erlkazar]].

Driven by the madness of its master [[wizard]], the Obsidian Ridge will destroy everything in its path until the wizard gets what he wants: the [[Mariko Morkann|princess of Erlkazar]] for a bride. But deep in the tunnels of the Obsidian Ridge, a room of trophies attests that he wants a great deal more.

''The citadel has hunted such quarry before.''}}

==Errata==
* The "Erlkazar & Folk of Intrigue" booklet of the [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|''Lands of Intrigue'' boxed set]] claims that King [[Valon Morkann]] died in {{Yearlink|1366}}. However, the novel is set in that same year, in the Spring, and states that Valon had died in the previous year.
