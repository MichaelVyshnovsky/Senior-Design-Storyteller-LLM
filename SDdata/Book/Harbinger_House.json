        "mainbody": "'''''Harbinger House''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure module. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|''A succubus with an unquenchable lust for power is turning the Cage into a ripping madhouse.\n\n''And the Lady of Pain ain't pleased. . . .\n\n''Something's foul in [[Sigil]], berk. A mad slasher prowls the streets, leaving a trail of bloody clues in his wake. Leatherheads boldly court the Lady of Pain, longing for the sharp touch of her shadow. Even the silent dabus're acting barmy, a sure sign that the Lady herself is uneasy. Are these strange events tied to a madhouse full of spell-touched sods ready to slip the bonds of mortality? A curious body'd better step carefully. After all, the dead-book's full of fools who wished for power?or got in the way of another berk's wish.''\n\n''Harbinger House is a Planescape adventure for four to six characters of 4th to 7th levels. From Sigil to the Outlands and back again, the heroes must piece together a puzzle that could shake the Cage to its foundations. A dark secret of the multiverse wails to be discovered in the lunatic asylum called Harbinger House, and only the player characters can shape its power-for good or ill.''\n\n''The [[Planescape Campaign Setting]] boxed set is required to run this adventure. The [[Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix]], [[In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil]], and [[A Player's Primer to the Outlands]] are recommended to enhance your enjoyment of this adventure.''}}",
