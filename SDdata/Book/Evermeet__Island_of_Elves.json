To achieve that, she obtained the help of several other evil deities, eventually causing a gods war. Just when her plans were close to accomplishment, Sehanine Moonbow reported the dark elf goddesss crimes and the Seldarine banished her to the Abyss and her son Vhaeraun, who helped her, to a mortal world.
