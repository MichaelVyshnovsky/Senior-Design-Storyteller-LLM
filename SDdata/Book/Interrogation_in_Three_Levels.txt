Interrogation in Three Levels was a textbook used to teach Sharran initiates skills of interrogation, printed sometime in or before the 15 century DR.
The text book collected information on how to inflict three levels of stress during interrogations emotional, physical, and lethal. It instructed to prioritize extracting information over inflicting harm, warning the interrogator from developing a sadistic emotional response to the process of interrogation or sympathy for the subject.
Interrogation in Three Levels was used by the acolytes of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace, hidden underneath the House of Grief in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
