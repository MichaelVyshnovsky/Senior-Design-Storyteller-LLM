Liriel Baenre, Sharlarra Vendreth, and Thorn stop for a bite to eat at a tavern in Hlammach, Impiltur, and find more than food awaits them. A hunter seeking wolf pelts recognized Thorn as lythari and she challenges him to a duel. Liriel casts a resurrection spell on the mans dragonhide boots and a red dragon forms to carry the man away. (Year autumn of 1371 DR )
