The chapbook published opinion pieces and reviews on occasion, as well as saucy gossip from the neighboring city of Silverymoon. The owner and contributor of the Evenhorn, Hawkblade, was a once-lover of Alustriel Silverhand, the leader of Silverymoon, and he never missed an opportunity to write about her beauty, latest grand outfits, accomplishments, as well as rumors of her current love affairs (many of which could not be corroborated)."
