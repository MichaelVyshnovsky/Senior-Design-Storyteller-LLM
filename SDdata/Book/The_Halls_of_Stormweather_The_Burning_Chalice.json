Larajins interaction with the Quaff was confirmed in Lord of Stormweather, chap. 15.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nCreatures\n • \n •  •  • \nItems\nLocations\n •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOrganizations\n •  • \n •  •  • \nReligion\n •  • \nMiscellaneous"
