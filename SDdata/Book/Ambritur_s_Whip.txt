'''''Ambritur's Whip''''' was a mean-spirited [[chapbook]] published in the city of [[Westgate]] of the [[Dragon Coast]].

==Description==
''Ambritur's Whip'' was an anonymously-penned hatchet job publication that relentlessly but eloquently criticized local establishments and events as well as served to gossip-monger about the prominent inhabitants of Westgate. It was wise not to use ''Ambritur's Whip'' as a guide.
