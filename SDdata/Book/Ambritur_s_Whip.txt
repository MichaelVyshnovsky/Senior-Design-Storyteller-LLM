Ambriturs Whip was a mean-spirited chapbook published in the city of Westgate of the Dragon Coast.
Ambriturs Whip was an anonymously-penned hatchet job publication that relentlessly but eloquently criticized local establishments and events as well as served to gossip-monger about the prominent inhabitants of Westgate. It was wise not to use Ambriturs Whip as a guide.
