'''''Teachings of Loss: Own Secret''''' was a [[Sharran]] text, printed before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Let her place the soothing hands of oblivion upon your wounds. Let her know you utterly, so she can release you from your shackles.''|Excerpt from ''Teachings of Loss: Own Secret''}}

==Content==
This tome was dedicated to secrecyâ€”one of the most valued qualities among Sharrans. The tome stated that the Lady of Loss knew all the secrets, even those buried deep inside her worshipers' souls. She knew of pains, regrets, and suffering in their hearts. The tenets of the faith demanded that all her devotees be open with the goddess about their failings; in exchange, she offered soothing oblivion and freedom.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Teachings of Loss: Own Secret'' could be found in the abandoned and ruined secret temple to Shar underneath the town of [[Reithwin]], the [[Gauntlet of Shar]].
