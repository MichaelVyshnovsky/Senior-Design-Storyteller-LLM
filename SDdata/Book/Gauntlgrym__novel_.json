        "mainbody": "auntlgrym is a book in the Legend of Drizzt saga by R.A. Salvatore and the first book in the The Neverwinter Saga series.\nIn 1409 DR,\nBruenor Battlehammer, the king of the\ndwarven stronghold of Mithral Hall, mourned with the drow ranger Drizzt\nDoUrden over the deaths of his halfling friend Regis\nand his adopted daughter, the human woman Catti-brie,\nboth of whom had been lost to the deadly effects of the Spellplague in 1385 DR. Bruenor also grieved\nfor his adopted son, the barbarian warrior Wulfgar, who had returned to his\nbirthplace, Icewind Dale, and had not been heard from in\nmany years. The dwarf king lamented over all that had happened since those\nterrible events and still regretted never completing his quest to find Gauntlgrym,\nthe ancient homeland of the Delzoun dwarves. However, by signing the\nTreaty of Garumn’s Gorge in 1372 DR, Bruenor had brought relative peace to the Silver\nMarches, and it had continued when Obould II had inherited the orc kingdom of\nMany-Arrows after the death of his predecessor.\nMeanwhile, the gnome alchemist Nanfoodle and the orc priestess\nJessa Dribble-Obould were planning to poison Bruenor. The dwarf battlerager Thibbledorf\nPwent noticed something amiss in\nNanfoodle’s behavior, but he could not quite identify it. Nanfoodle poisoned\nBruenor’s ale, and after the king drank it, the entire population of Mithral\nHall went into mourning at the death of their beloved ruler. Banak Brawnanvil was\nnamed the Eleventh King of Mithral Hall, and Pwent, who was distraught over the\ndeath of Bruenor, sought out Nanfoodle and Jessa for answers in the hills\noutside of the dwarven city. Once Pwent found the pair, he attempted to beat an\nanswer out of them, but before a fight started, Bruenor and Drizzt appeared.\nBruenor demanded answers from Pwent on why he had followed Nanfoodle and Jessa\ninstead of being at Banak’s side, to which the battlerager replied that his\nloyalty remained with his king. Bruenor then revealed how he had faked his own death\nwith the help of Nanfoodle and Jessa in order to continue his quest to discover\nGauntlgrym, while still leaving Mithral Hall under capable command. Drizzt,\nBruenor, Jessa, Nanfoodle, Pwent, and the drow’s magical panther Guenhwyvar\nimmediately began journeying west in search of the ancient dwarven complex. The\ncompanions were also joined by Andahar, a magical unicorn that could be\nsummoned much like Guenhwyvar and that had been a gift to Drizzt from the\nruling council of Silverymoon for his work with both blade and diplomacy during\nthe Third Orc War.\nIn 1451 DR, the elf warrior Dahlia Sinfelle was ordered\nby the lich\nSzass Tam, the supreme ruler of Thay, to travel with her\nvampire lover, Korvin Dorcrae, to the port city of Luskan to investigate\npossibilities for creating a Dread Ring, a necromantic area of massive\ndevastation that produced countless undead creatures. Although young for an\nelf, Dahlia was a skilled warrior who had mastered Kozah’s Needle, an\neight-foot-long staff that could be configured in many different ways and possessed\nmagical lightning powers. The callous Dahlia wore diamond earrings as a tribute\nto her lovers eight in her left ear to signify her dead lovers, whom she had killed,\nand two in her right ear for those who were still alive. The upcoming mission\ncaused Dahlia to remember her childhood in the Sword Coast region and the\ncruelties that she had experienced at the hands of Netherese warriors. After\nthe raiders had murdered the men of her village and raped the women, Dhalia had\nbeen violated and impregnated by the band’s leader, the Shadovar tiefling\nHerzgo Alegni. The elf had\nbeen forced to bear his tiefling offspring, but she threw the baby from a cliff\nsoon after it was born. Before leaving on her mission, Dahlia fought and killed\nher other lover, the young warrior Themerelis, in order to anger her rival, the\nThayan sorceress Sylora Salm, as she had also been his lover. \nIn all the years since they had departed from Mithral Hall, Drizzt, Bruenor,\nand Pwent had continued to search for Gauntlgrym with no success, and although\nNanfoodle and Jessa had journeyed with them for many years, the two eventually left\ntheir company. While searching for the lost homeland, the companions also pursued\nrumors of a magical forest inhabited by a beautiful woman and a halfling, leading\nthem to Icewind Dale. After failing to discover any evidence of the sanctuary,\nthe group visited the dwarven settlement beneath the lone mountain known as Kelvin’s\nCairn, where Bruenor, who was traveling under an alias, decided to continue his\nsearch for Gauntlgrym. However, since Pwent had become too old and tired to\ncontinue adventuring, he chose to stay in Icewind Dale when Bruenor and Drizzt\ndeparted.\nAt that time, Alegni was living in the city of Neverwinter, as he was the\nleader of a Netherese expedition that had been sent to Neverwinter Wood in\nsearch of the fallen Xinlenal Enclave. Upset that Hugo Babris, the Lord of\nNeverwinter, would not rename a prominent bridge after him, Alegni summoned his\nchief assassin, Barrabus the Gray, from\nhis home in the port city of Memnon. Alegni instructed Barrabus to convince Babris\nto change the bridge’s name, and when Barrabus then showed disdain toward Alegni,\nthe tiefling used his magical sword Charon’s Claw to punish the assassin. The\nmagical attack caused Barrabus severe pain, and the warrior soon used force to\npersuade Babris to change the name of the bridge. \nWhen they reached Luskan, Dahlia and Dorcrae entered Illusk, a ruined section of\nthe city inhabited by the undead. The couple met with the insane lich Valindra\nShadowmantle to learn more about the connection between the magical destruction\nof the Hosttower of the Arcane and the earthquakes that had been wracking the\nSword Coast North since the stronghold’s fall several decades earlier. While\ntraveling through Illusk’s catacombs, Dahlia and Dorcrae discovered magical tendrils\noriginating at the foundation of the ruined Hosttower and running in two\ndirections one to the open sea and the other inland to the southeast. Sent by\nDahlia to investigate where the inland tendrils led, Dorcrae journeyed for\nseveral days before discovering that the tube ended at a colossal underground city\nthat was guarded by dwarf ghosts. In the meantime, Dahlia learned from the\nspirit of the lich Arklem Greeth that the subterranean city was Gauntlgrym,\nwhich had ancient ties with the Hosttower. \nWhen Dorcrae returned to Luskan\nwith news of Gauntlgrym’s location and the magical wards protecting it, Dahlia\nrealized that she would need a Delzoun dwarf in order to access the destructive\npower contained in the ancient stronghold. Dahlia eventually sought out the dwarf\nwarrior Athrogate and his companion,\nthe drow mercenary Jarlaxle Baenre. Dahlia convinced the formidable partners to\naccompany her to Gauntlgrym, but they believed that the mission was a search\nfor treasure. Also around that time, Alegni and his Netherese forces began to\nbe opposed in Neverwinter Wood by the Ashmadai, cultists of the devil-god\nAsmodeus who were allied with the Red Wizards of Thay. When Alegni learned of\nthe Thayan agents in Luskan, he immediately ordered Barrabus to travel north\nand investigate.\nDahlia, Dorcrae, Athrogate, Jarlaxle,\nand Valindra journeyed together to Gauntlgrym using the underground tunnels. When\nthey reached Gauntlgrym, the group was able to enter due to Athrogate’s\nheritage as a Delzoun dwarf, which also protected them from the dwarf ghosts that\nguarded the city. The companions explored the vast complex in search of their\nmain goal, the forge of Gauntlgrym, which was reputed to have crafted the\nfinest items in its day. Unbeknownst to his comrades, Dorcrae, who had formed\na secret alliance with Sylora, activated a magical item that allowed the Thayan\nsorceress to follow the group’s movements from afar and then transport herself into\nthe dwarven stronghold. Sylora opened a magical portal to allow a band of\nAshmadai zealots to join her in Gauntlgrym, and the force swiftly traveled\nthrough the city in pursuit of the five companions.\nAfter fighting their way through\ndire corbies (avian humanoids) that laired in Gauntlgrym, Dahlia and the others\nreached the forge to discover that the source of the power for the dwarven\ncomplex’s famed forge was a fire primordial. The comrades realized that the\nancient dwarves and the wizards of the Hosttower had used magic to bring in the\nwaters of the ocean and summon water elementals to serve as a harness for the\ngodlike being, enabling them to use its fiery energies to power Gauntlgrym’s\nforges and magically ward the city from its enemies. However, the magic binding\nthe primordial had been gradually dissipating since the Hosttower’s fall, a\nresult being the earthquakes that had wracked the Sword Coast region for so\nmany years. When Dorcrae attempted to exert his undead willpower over\nAthrogate to force him to activate the lever that would release the primordial\nand thus initiate the cataclysm that was necessary to create the Dread Ring, Dahlia\nhad a change of heart and tried to stop the dwarf, but at that point Sylora\narrived and used her magic to compel him onward. \nWith the magic binding it shut down\nentirely, the primordial immediately began to shake off the water elementals. Sylora\nthen opened another magical portal through which she, Dorcrae, Valindra, and\nmost of the Ashmadai left Gauntlgrym. Jarlaxle, Athrogate, and Dahlia were\nforced to kill Sylora’s dozen remaining minions in order to escape from the\ndwarven stronghold, and the trio eventually made their way back to Luskan.\nSylora soon captured Dahlia, and under threat of death, commanded the elf\nwarrior to serve as one of her lieutenants in the conflict against the\nNetherese in Neverwinter Wood. After spying on the meeting between Dahlia and\nSylora, Barrabus returned to Neverwinter and told Alegni what he had discovered.\nMeanwhile, Drizzt and Bruenor traveled the countryside near Neverwinter\nsearching for Gauntlgrym. At that time, the freed primordial unleashed its fury\nagainst living beings by causing a volcanic explosion of Mount Hotenow that\nresulted in the destruction of Neverwinter. Alegni used his abilities as a\nShadovar to escape to the Shadowfell, while Barrabus was barely able to survive\nby taking cover underneath the Alegni Bridge.   \nIn 1462 DR, the Dread Ring had been nearly completed as a result of the death\nand destruction caused by the primordial’s rage, and new types of ash-covered undead\nstalked the region. Although the Netherese expedition had continued their\nsearch for Xinlenal Enclave in Neverwinter Wood after the cataclysm, Alegni had\nbeen removed from leadership for failing to prevent the Thayans from enacting\ntheir plan. However, with the forces of Thay gaining a clear advantage in the\nwar over the region, the tiefling was once again granted command. Alegni\nimmediately recalled Barrabus from his life of relative luxury in the port city\nof Calimport and ordered the assassin to hunt the Ashmadai in Neverwinter Wood,\na task that the warrior completed quite successfully. Dahlia and Barrabus eventually\nencountered each other in the woods, but their vicious fight ended in a stalemate.\nDahlia’s unorthodox weapon proved too much for the assassin’s two-handed style,\nwhile Barrabus’s ability to use the environment to perform surprise attacks\noutmatched the elf. Jarlaxle and Athrogate were still residing in Luskan at that\ntime, and they sought a way to avenge themselves for the events that had occurred\nin Gauntlgrym eleven years earlier.\nDetermined to imprison the primordial, which was reawakening, the ghost dwarves\nof Gauntlgrym spread out across northwest Faerûn\nin search of Delzoun dwarves to help. While some of the ghosts arrived in\nIcewind Dale to notify the dwarves of Kelvin’s Cairn of their plight, others informed\nBruenor of the situation. Bruenor then took it upon himself, along with Drizzt,\nto once again entrap the primordial. Meanwhile, Jarlaxle traveled to the underground\ndrow city of Menzoberranzan to seek advice on how to\nimprison the primordial from his older brother, the archmage Gromph Baenre. Jarlaxle\nlearned that he would need a dwarf king in addition to other magical items to\ncomplete the task. Since Sylora needed the devastation that would be caused by\nthe reawakening primordial to complete the Dread Ring, the Thayan sorceress immediately\nordered Dahlia and a small force of Ashmadai to travel to Luskan to stop any\nefforts to entrap the fiery being. Upon arriving in the city, Dahlia searched\nfor a way to return to Gauntlgrym to imprison the primordial in the hope that this\nwould lead to her freedom from Sylora. When she discovered that the way was\nblocked because the tunnels had collapsed, Dahlia secretly sought out Jarlaxle.\nWhile Bruenor was deciding on where to search next for Gauntlgrym, he was\nrobbed of his maps in the woods by a drow. Drizzt correctly determined who was\nbehind the theft, leading him and Bruenor to Luskan in search of Jarlaxle. Dahlia\nwas eventually able to find Jarlaxle and accepted an enchanted ring from the\ndrow shortly before Bruenor and Drizzt arrived at the Cutlass inn in Luskan. Drizzt\nand Bruenor were attacked in the tavern by a band of Ashmadai led by Dahlia, but\nJarlaxle and Athrogate soon joined the fight, and together the four defeated the\nzealots. Dahlia appeared to be captured by Jarlaxle’s wand of magical goo, but it\nwas only a ruse to make Sylora’s minions believe that she was dead.\nBruenor, Drizzt, Jarlaxle, Athrogate, and Dahlia decided to journey to\nGauntlgrym together in an attempt to stop the primordial and hopefully destroy\nthe Dread Ring in the process. The group hastily proceeded to Gauntlgrym\noverland in search of a cave that they ascertained would lead them to the dwarven\ncity. The companions were attacked near the cave by a force of Ashmadai who had\nfollowed them, and the fight was magically observed through a scrying bowl by Sylora\nand Dorcrae. At that time, Barrabus secretly infiltrated the Thayans’\nencampment and viewed the clash, but upon seeing Drizzt, he was overcome with\nemotion and retreated without having been seen by anyone. Drizzt and his comrades\ndefeated the Ashmadai, and then traveled through the underground passages in\nthe cave to reach Gauntlgrym. \nWhen the group entered Gauntlgrym, Bruenor\nsat on the dwarf kings’ magical throne and was imbued with divine power. In\norder to imprison the primordial, the companions would have to place ten magical\nbowls containing water elementals in certain locations throughout Gauntlgrym, where\nthey would connect to the tendrils of the Hosttower. However, over the years since\nits release, the primordial had summoned many minions, including salamanders\nand a small red dragon, from the Elemental Plane of Fire to battle intruders, and\nthese creatures immediately prepared to stop the group. Dorcrae, Valindra, and\na contingent of Ashmadai soon entered Gauntlgrym in pursuit of Bruenor and the\nothers. Before the Thayans began to move deeper into the ancient stronghold, Valindra\nused a magical scepter to summon the pit fiend\nBeealtimatuche from the Nine Hells to protect them from the dwarf ghosts and to\nassist them in the imminent engagements against the primordial’s servants and\nBruenor’s group. Meanwhile, Drizzt and his companions began the process of\nplacing the ten bowls in their correct locations throughout Gauntlgrym while fighting\nthe primordial’s minions. Around that time, dwarves from Icewind Dale and the\ncity of Mirabar, who had also been visited by dwarf ghosts, arrived in another\npart of Gauntlgrym to help entrap the primordial. \nBruenor and his comrades were only able to place nine of the ten summoning\nbowls, since the location for the tenth had been destroyed when the primordial\nfirst was freed, but they decided that it would have to be enough. When the\ngroup then headed to the forge room of Gauntlgrym, Bruenor placed his axe and shield\ninto the forge and removed them to find that they were magically enhanced. After\nbattling their way through the primordial’s servants and slaying the red\ndragon, the pit fiend and the Ashmadai entered the forge room and confronted\nthe companions. Beealtimatuche engaged the group and surprisingly managed to\nkill the consummate survivor Jarlaxle. While Drizzt and Dahlia then held off\nthe zealots and several legion devils, Bruenor and Athrogate made their way to\nthe primordial chamber to entrap the fiery being, but they were intercepted by the\npit fiend. Athrogate attempted to fight Beealtimatuche, but he only slightly wounded\nthe devil before he was knocked off the floor of the chamber and onto a ledge\nnear the primordial. God-blessed Bruenor then engaged Beealtimatuche in a\ntitanic battle, but even with the dwarf’s new divine powers, the pit fiend\nseized the advantage.\nAt that time, the other dwarves,\nincluding Pwent, arrived at the fight in the forge room, and the battlerager\nquickly went to find Bruenor in order to protect him. Dahlia and Drizzt gained the\nadvantage in the battle until Valindra began to unleash her magic. The lich was\nsoon wounded and driven away by Jarlaxle, who had been saved by the same ring\nthat had allowed Dahlia to fake her own death. While the dwarves continued to\nfight against the remaining Ashmadai, Drizzt and the others went after Bruenor\nto ensure the defeat of the primordial. Bruenor was saved from Beealtimatuche’s\nrelentless attack by the arrival of Pwent, who was swiftly overcome but gave\nBruenor enough time to recover and finally kill the devil. After Beealtimatuche’s\ndefeat, Pwent helped the seriously wounded Bruenor make his way to the lever that\ncontrolled the primordial’s magical prison. Drizzt and Dahlia entered the\nchamber just in time to see Dorcrae, who had secretly followed them in, tear\nout Pwent’s throat. Dahlia attacked Dorcrae and drove off the vampire with her\nmagical ring that transformed into a wooden finger-spike.\nBruenor, with the last of his strength, managed to activate the lever, but he then\nsuccumbed to his wounds. Attempting to escape, Dorcrae was assailed by the\nnine water elementals that were summoned to entrap the primordial and exploded\ninto thin air, seemingly destroyed. The primordial was once again sealed in its\nprison, and Sylora’s plans for the Dread Ring were thwarted. Jarlaxle managed\nto help Athrogate escape from the ledge, and Bruenor was then buried in\nGauntlgrym alongside Pwent. Dhalia moved the last earring to her left ear,\nsymbolizing Dorcrae’s death, and planned to journey to Neverwinter Wood to confront\nSylora, who had avoided the fight in Gauntlgrym but was the principal orchestrator\nof the plan. Although Drizzt was anguished over Bruenor’s death, he decided to\naccompany Dahlia out of growing feelings toward the elf woman.\nBruenor awakened in the goddess Mielikki’s magical forest, which he and\nDrizzt had previously been searching for in an unlikely attempt to save Regis\nand Catti-brie from their deaths. Bruenor was met by Wulfgar and Regis, who\nremarked that the dwarf was indeed dead. When Bruenor asked of Catti-brie, they\npointed into the woods at the form of a dancing woman, and the sight of his\nbeloved daughter gave the dwarf overwhelming happiness.\n* Drizzt DoUrden, drow ranger\n* Bruenor Battlehammer, former king of Mithral Hall\n* Dahlia Sinfelle, elven warrior of Thay\n* Athrogate, dwarf companion of Jarlaxle\n* Barrabus the Gray, assassin serving Herzgo Alegni\n* Beealtimatuche, pit fiend\n* Guenhwyvar, astral panther\n* Herzgo Alegni, tiefling leader of the Shadovar\n* Jarlaxle, drow leader of Bregan Daerthe\n* Jessa Dribble-Obould, orc cleric\n* Korvin Dorcrae, vampire in the service of Thay\n* Nanfoodle, gnome\n* Sylora Salm, leader under Szass Tam of Thay\n* Thibbledorf Pwent, dwarven Gutbuster\n* Valindra Shadowmantle, lich\n* Catti-brie, Bruenors daughter and one of the Companions of the Hall\n* Regis, halfling of the Companions of the Hall\n* Shivanni Gardpeck, proprieter of the Cutlass (inn)\n* Stokely Silverstream, leader of Clan Battlehammer in Icewind Dale\n* Szass Tam, leader of Thay\n* Torgar Hammerstriker, dwarven miner from Mirabar\n* Valas Hune, Bregan Daerthe scout\n* Wulfgar, member of the Companions of the Hall\n* Zaknafein DoUrden, Drizzts father\nRegions\nIcewind Dale • Silver Marches • Sword Coast North\nSettlements\nLuskan • Mithral Hall • Neverwinter • Ten Towns\nOther\nGauntlgrym • Iruladoon\n* Devil\n* Ghost\n* Lich\n* Pit fiend\n* Red dragon\n* Salamander\n* Vampire\n* Water elemental\n* Cracker and Whacker\n* Charons Claw\n* Kozahs Needle\nCategoryBooks\nCategoryNovels\nCategoryWorks by R.A.
