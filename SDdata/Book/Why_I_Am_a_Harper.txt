{{quote|''I see a woman leaping like a flame in battle, bathed in the blood of foes, her sword singing a deadly song. I see her crisply negotiating peace while she bathes, unashamed. I see her grief-stricken, and imparting counsel to bewildered young inheritors who must now shape their lives alone - words that they'll remember and cling to for years to come. I see her going to her knees to play with a neglected child in the dust, whilst captains-of-war stand waiting, and keep silent. And in all their eyes I see the same look of awe and love. I never thought humans could so love a storm.''}}
