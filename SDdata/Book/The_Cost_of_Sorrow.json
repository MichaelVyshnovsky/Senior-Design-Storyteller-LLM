        "mainbody": "The untitled [[book]] that had the tentative name '''''The Cost of Sorrow''''' was a romance novel and the third volume of four, all unpublished drafts penned by the amateur novelist [[Roan Featherway]] in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This volume was penned in a beautifully bound journal. That was once the case as the completed work was rugged with its pages ripped, replaced, and [[glue]]d over, affixed to the book's spine with twine. The cover boldly read \"Volume III\" and hd its tentative title written underneath, followed by a number of question marks.",
        "Contents": "The third volume of Roan Featherway's work focused on the drama between Roa and the series' antagonist, General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. It included a confrontation between the two in which Roa screwed at his opponents in animalistic rage, demanding to know the General's reasons for following the dark goddess [[Shar]] and destroying the village of [[Moonhaven]]. Ketheric responded, stepping over dead [[Harper]]s on the ground, with a cruel statement that Shar knew all and he was on her holy mission. Roa claimed that the people of Moonhaven trusted the general, and his [[Dark Justiciar]] attack was a betrayal, and the General responded by saying that Shar's servants needed target practice. The story continued with a duel between the lone [[Silvanite]] [[druid]] and the [[Sharran]] General.",
        "History": "Roan Featherway was himself a druid of [[Silvanus]], and his work was heavily inspired by the events of the war between General Ketheric Thorm and the joint forces of [[Harpers]] and the Emerald Enclave that took place in the late 14{{th}} century DR. The draft novel's characters included the real druid of the Emerald Grove, [[Halsin]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, it remained unknown whether the manuscript was ever published, just like the rest of the drafts in the series."
