Path of Stones is the title of an unpublished novel that was planned to be written by David Cook circa 1989. It was to be set in Kara-Tur and likely wouldve been the eleventh novel of the Forgotten Realms line.
According to D&D researcher Shannon Appelcline, David "Zeb" Cook (who had worked on much of the Oriental Adventures setting) had proposed a Kara-Tur novel for Forgotten Realms. It was being considered by Jean Black, the head of TSR, Inc.s fiction department at the time. The characters of Path of Stones were presented in Hall of Heroes in 1989, with write-ups by Mike Pondsmith. These were intended as a preview of the novel, alongside the characters of the then-forthcoming The Avatar Trilogy.

Cover art by Jim Holloway was also intended, depicting the Earth Spider clutching an unconscious woman, likely Onoye, and a warrior presumed to be Sanehiro. This artwork was included in the Forgotten Realms 1990 Calendar under the title "Path of Stones" with a quote from Dragon Lord Mei Lung about the Celestial Bureaucracy and was later used for two unrelated AD&D Trading Cards in 1991 Goblin Spider and Seiroku Ashida.
However, plans for Path of Stones were halted for various unspecified reasons. Appelcline speculates it was lost or shelved when Mary Kirchoff replaced Black as head of TSRs fiction, as is common in publishing.
Nevertheless, the desire for a Kara-Tur novel remained, leading to The Empires trilogy beginning in 1990, with Cook writing Horselords, although not set in Kara-Tur, and Troy Denning writing Dragonwall, which would be the sole Kara-Tur novel. A few of the characters of Path of Stones also made cameos in the adventures Ronin Challenge and Test of the Samurai earlier that same year.
