'''''Path of Stones''''' is the title of an unpublished novel that was planned to be written by [[David Cook]] ''circa'' 1989. It was to be set in [[Kara-Tur]] and likely would've been the eleventh novel of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' line.{{Cite polyhedron/56/Bookwyrms: Building Troy Denning's Dragonwall|18}}

==Development==
According to D&D researcher Shannon Appelcline, David "Zeb" Cook (who had worked on much of the ''Oriental Adventures'' setting) had proposed a Kara-Tur novel for ''Forgotten Realms''. It was being considered by Jean Black, the head of [[TSR, Inc.]]'s fiction department at the time.{{cite web

}} The characters of ''Path of Stones'' were presented in ''[[Hall of Heroes]]'' in 1989, with write-ups by [[Mike Pondsmith]]. These were intended as a preview of the novel, alongside the characters of the then-forthcoming [[The Avatar Trilogy]]. 

[[File:Path of Stones.png|thumb|250px|''Cover art appearing in the 1990 Forgotten Realms Calendar.'']]
Cover art by [[Jim Holloway]] was also intended, depicting the Earth Spider clutching an unconscious woman, likely Onoye, and a warrior presumed to be Sanehiro. This artwork was included in the [[Forgotten Realms 1990 Calendar]] under the title "Path of Stones" with a quote from Dragon Lord [[Mei Lung]] about the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] and was later used for two unrelated [[AD&D Trading Cards]] in 1991: [[goblin spider|Goblin Spider]] and [[Seiroku Ashida]].

However, plans for ''Path of Stones'' were halted for various unspecified reasons. Appelcline speculates it was lost or shelved when Mary Kirchoff replaced Black as head of TSR's fiction, as is common in publishing.

Nevertheless, the desire for a Kara-Tur novel remained, leading to [[The Empires trilogy]] beginning in 1990, with Cook writing ''[[Horselords]]'', although not set in Kara-Tur, and [[Troy Denning]] writing ''[[Dragonwall (novel)|Dragonwall]]'', which would be the sole Kara-Tur novel. A few of the characters of ''Path of Stones'' also made cameos in the adventures ''[[Ronin Challenge]]'' and ''[[Test of the Samurai]]'' earlier that same year.
