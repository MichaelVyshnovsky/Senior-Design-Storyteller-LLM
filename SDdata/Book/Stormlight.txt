Stormlight, by Ed Greenwood, is the fourteenth book of the loosely-related The Harpers series.
When Bane conquered the mind of a marilith, he discovered Maxan Maxer, Storm Silverhands beloved, who the marileth had killed and then raised. He took over his body shortly before the Time of Troubles. When Bane was killed, a twisted fragment of him remained in Maxan, killing Athlan Summerstar, a minor Cormyrean noble and Harper      and drawing the attention of Storm Silverhand. From Athlan, he learned the power to subsume, and began slaughtering servants, soldiers, War Wizards, and nobles until eventually Storm Silverhand forced him to destroy himself when she almost learned the secrets of the man who became Bane, freeing Maxer. The few survivors include the War Wizard Broglan, the heiress Shayna Summerstar, and the Purple Dragon commander Ergluth Rowanmantle.
