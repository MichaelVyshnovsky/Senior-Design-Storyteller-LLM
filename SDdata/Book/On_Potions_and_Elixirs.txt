On Potions and Elixirs was a book about the art of alchemy and the Part IX of the Basics of Alchemy series penned by Haskinn Xhesilaphin, a dragonborn alchemist sometime before the late 15 century DR.
Like other volumes of the Basics of Alchemy, On Potions and Elixirs combined scholarly work on the said subject and documented the authors life, thoughts, and musings. Haskinn wrote about how they were inspired to devise a series of concoctions that he referred to as elixirs. The inspiration came from a cranky and moody period of the dragonborns life when the descaled condition worsened with oozing that left white sheets pink and snapping prickly attitude towards a friend. Haskinn Xhesilaphin thought potions to be extremely limited due to their short effects, while their idea for the elixir would ensure that the effects would last until the end-day rest. However, an imbiber could drink several potions to have a cornucopia of effects active, but a persons system could only handle the effects of a single elixir.
Lastly, Haskinn Xhesilaphin, as always, talked about the the Rule of Three â€“ in their opinion, all ingredients need to be refined to be used in alchemy, and in order to do that, one needed three portions of the same ingredient. They also provided the reader is a "rhyme" that supposedly helped them remember the Rule of Three.
