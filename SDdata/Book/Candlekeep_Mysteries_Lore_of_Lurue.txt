"Lore of Lurue" is a short adventure module for 8&ndashlevel players, collected in the anthology Candlekeep Mysteries, where players are pulled into a magical book telling the story of how the city of Silverymoon got its name.
In 1492 DR, a group of adventurers in Candlekeep open the tome Lore of Lurue and find themselves transported into a demiplane conjured by the book itself. The adventurers must navigate to the end of the story to return home, encountering fey creatures and cultists of Malar along the way, and learning how the deity Lurue is connected to the founding of Silverymoon.
