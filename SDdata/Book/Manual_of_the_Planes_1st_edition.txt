Manual of the Planes 1st edition is a 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. 
Manual of the Planes 1st edition describes various planes of existence, and what creatures characters might encounter there, covering the astral and ethereal planes, the elemental planes, and the outer planes. It also details how to survive in the planes, and how combat and magic differ under each planes special conditions.
Jeff Easleys cover featured an illustration of a creature named in the book as an "ethereal dreadnought", although the book had no description or game statistics for the creature. This creature was later identified in 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons as an astral dreadnought.
