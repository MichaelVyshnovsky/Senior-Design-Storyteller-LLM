The Midwinter Edition of the  included the recipe for eaglach stew, a traditional dwarven with a unique twist from the author. Its name, when translated, could sound terrifying for non-dwarves, and The Purged Palates version came seasoned with drider venom, added in after the stews alcohol is completely cooked out. However, the author advised the readers not to use drider venom and instead just add other sour and non-deadly ingredients. The anecdote that accompanied eaglach came from the time the author worked as a city watchman. His dinner bowl was poisoned by a drow thief, which resulted in a delicious dish rather than death."
