If the City of Spiders were to find itself buried by the uncaring sands of eternity, thousands would dance upon its grave, including more powerful enemies than even its most suspicious inhabitants have ever imagined. But [[Gromph Baenre]], [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]], will not let that happen. When the time comes, he will risk everything to save a city and a civilization he loves more than any drow would ever admit.''\n\n''While Menzoberranzan fights for survival, a dwindling company of would-be saviors travels the multiverse in search of a [[Lolth|goddess]] who could be dead, or could have simply turned away from them. They might just survive the trip, but can they possibly survive the [[Demonweb Pits]]?''}}",
        "Summary": "The novel opens in Menzoberranzan, still besieged by the [[duergar]] army of [[Gracklstugh]] and [[tanarukk]] warriors of [[Kaanyr Vhok]]'s [[Scourged Legion]]. Archmage [[Gromph Baenre]] seeks out new eyes (literally) as he prepares for his coming spell battle with the Lichdrow [[Lord Dyrr]].\n\nMeanwhile, on the [[ship of chaos]] in the [[Lake of Shadows]], everyone's nerves are on end. The leader of the group, [[Quenthel Baenre]], sends [[Valas Hune]] and [[Danifae Yauntyrr]] to [[Eryndlyn]] to gather supplies for the coming journey while [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] continues to put the ship in working order. In Eryndlyn, Danifae tracks down [[Zinnirit Yauntyrr]], the former house wizard of [[House Yauntyrr]] and convinces him to dispel her Binding with [[Halisstra Melarn]] before killing him and stealing his ring of [[teleport|teleportation]]. When she and Valas return to the ship of chaos, they find their group more ragged than before, having fought [[Raashub]], the imprisoned [[uridezu]] captain, and his summoned hordes of rats and uridezu. Quenthel is despondent, leaving an angry and frustrated [[Jeggred Baenre]] to turn to the newly-released priestess as his mistress. Pharaun attempts to learn how to manipulate the ship on his own (with the secret aid of [[Aliisza]], who had been sent to spy on them on behalf of Kaanyr Vhok).\n\nOn the surface, Halisstra has converted to the worship of [[Eilistraee]] and joined with a group of priestesses of the Dancing Maiden, leaving her lover, [[Ryld Argith]], feeling isolated and doubting his choice to follow her to the surface. Danifae locates her former mistress and schemes to put in in as much misery as possible. She takes Jeggred, her new pet, to the surface to kill Ryld, offering to allow Halisstra to return to the sisterhood of priestesses. Heartbroken, she nevertheless resolves to continue with her mission to destroy [[Lolth]] with the [[Crescent Blade]].\n\nIn Menzoberranzan, Gromph engages in a battle with the Lichdrow. Dyrr initially prevails over Gromph, sending him to the [[Green Fields]] ([[halfling]] heaven). Gromph is able to return, but one of the halflings named [[Dietr]] follows him to the city, becoming a [[huecuva]] (undead halfling). Gromph forces Dietr to take the brunt of Dyrr's attacks, destroying the huecuva in the process. Then Gromph enters a long and protracted spell battle with Dyrr which destroys the Menzoberranyr [[Bazaar (Menzoberranzan)|Bazaar]]. [[Nimor Imphraezl]], revealed to be half-[[shadow dragon]], joins the battle and Dyrr is able to [[flesh to stone|petrify]] Gromph. At that moment, Lolth's power suddenly returns to her priestesses. [[Triel Baenre]] transports herself to the Bazaar, turning her brother back to flesh and allowing him to kill the Lichdrow's corporeal form by exploding his [[Staff of Power]]. However, he knows the battle is not yet over; he must still destroy the lich's phylactery.\n\nHaving traveled to the the remains of the old [[Demonweb Pits]], Quenthel's group discovers that Lolth has apparently removed her realm to its own planar space. Valas declares his job finished and returns to Menzoberranzan, but the rest follow a gate from the [[Abyss]] to Lolth's new domain, with calls of ''[[Yor'thae]]'' (Lolth's Chosen) on the wind calling to Quenthel and Daniefae. On the [[Astral Plane]], Halisstra and her Eilistraeean companions, [[Uluyara]] and [[Feliane]], follow a line of [[drow]] spirits leading to the new Demonweb Pits. They run into the spirits of [[Ryld Argith]], who tells Halisstra it is too late for him to join with Eilistraee, and [[Seyll Auzkovyn]], who tells Halisstra she chooses oblivion over an [[afterlife]] with Eilistraee in order to protect Halisstra from the returning power of Lolth. However, Halisstra's doubts are strong and she too can here the call of ''Yor'thae'' as they approach the gate.\n\nWith the power of Lolth returned, the forces of Kaanyr Vhok retreat from Menzoberranzan, the duergar armies are set to be defeated, and Nimor returns to [[Ched Nasad]] to his Jaezred Chaulssin brother to inform them of his failure to obtain Menzoberranzan. The exact state of Lolth, however, remains to be seen in the final novel.",
