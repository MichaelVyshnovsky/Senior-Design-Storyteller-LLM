Khelben Arunsun sends Mirt and Dauntless to follow and observe. Laeral and Qilué follow Brelma to Skullport, where she leads them into a trap. The resulting battle is observed by two mysterious figures. The Chosen follow two of the mercenaries who survived the attack to the cellar of Auvrarn Labraster, another merchant. Qilué returns to her duties as a Chosen of Eilistraee while Laeral investigates Mrilla in the guise of Sylull Cassalanter, learning that Mrilla knows nothing of the larger plan. Laeral then goes to Auvrarn’s house, where she encounters various traps and finds she is being followed by Elaith Craulnober, who tells her Auvrarn has left for Silverymoon. Laeral tries to scry on Auvrarn but is caught in a spelltrap left by Halaster Blackcloak, which nearly destroys her until Khelben helps her regenerate her body."
