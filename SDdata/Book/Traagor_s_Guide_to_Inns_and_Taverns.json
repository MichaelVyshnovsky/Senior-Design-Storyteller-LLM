        "mainbody": "Traagors Guide to Inns and Taverns was a guidebook to the city of Ravens Bluff, penned by Rooth and Eldwin Traagor sometime in the mid- 4 century DR.\nUnlike many other guides to the cities of Faer√ªn, Traagors Guide to Inns and Taverns was designed to be useful for those who could read, as well as for those who could not. The book featured illustrations of the establishments location, their signage, and ratings from one to four stars.\nThe guide was the creation of Rooth Traagor and her sage son, Eldwin. The duo ran Traagors Tours and Souvenir Shop in Ravens Bluff, where the guidebook was sold for a single gold coin in the mid-to-late 14 century DR."
