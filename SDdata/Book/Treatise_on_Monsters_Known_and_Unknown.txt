'''''Treatise on Monsters Known and Unknown''''' was a [[book]] written by [[Thardon Ilvynner]] between the {{YearlinkName|516}} and the {{YearlinkName|522}}.

==History==
The tome was so important to Thardon that he only accepted the position of the [[Magister]] when [[Azuth]] offered it because he deemed it useful for him to complete this work. As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was one of the main sources for useful information on the more dangerous creatures of [[Faerûn]].
