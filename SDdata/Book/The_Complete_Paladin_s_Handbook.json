It provides players with the tools to design paladins with diverse personalities and backgrounds. The sourcebook explores the unique abilities and code of conduct that define paladins. Paladins are holy knights dedicated to justice, righteousness, and the protection of the innocent. The book covers their martial skills, divine powers, and moral obligations.\n\n''The Complete Paladin's Handbook'' introduces various paladin orders, each with its unique traditions, oaths, and goals. Players can choose to belong to these orders or create their own. It also covers the religious aspects of paladins, including their faith, devotion to deities, and relationships with churches and religious orders.\n\nIt includes information on magical weapons, armor, and equipment that are particularly suited for paladins. This includes enchanted swords, holy relics, and protective gear.\n\nIt discusses the role of mounts, such as warhorses, and loyal animal companions that paladins may have. These creatures often serve as steadfast allies in the paladin's quest for justice.\n\nIt offers role-playing tips and suggestions for players who wish to portray paladin characters convincingly. It covers topics like honor, compassion, and interactions with other characters. The book provides campaign ideas and adventure hooks that involve paladin characters and the challenges they might face, such as quests to battle against evil cults, protect the vulnerable, or restore order to a troubled land.
