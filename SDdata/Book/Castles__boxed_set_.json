The first booklet, by Jeff Grubb, is about the Zhentarim fortress, Darkhold.\nCastles focuses on providing comprehensive information and resources for players and Dungeon Masters who want to incorporate castles into their campaigns.\nCastles serves as a guide for building and running castles. It offers a wealth of information, including architectural details, castle layouts, defensive structures, and various features that make castles an integral part of the game. It caters to both players who wish to acquire and maintain their own castles and Dungeon Masters who want to incorporate castles as key locations in their adventures.\nCastles provides detailed descriptions of different types of castles, ranging from small keeps to sprawling fortresses. It explores various architectural styles, defensive strategies, and historical context to give players and Dungeon Masters a deeper understanding of the role castles play in a medieval-inspired fantasy setting.\nThe book offers guidance on designing and customizing castles to suit the needs and aspirations of player characters.
