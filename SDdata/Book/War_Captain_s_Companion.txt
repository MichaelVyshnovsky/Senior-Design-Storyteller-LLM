'''''War Captain's Companion''''' by [[Slade|Dale "Slade" Henson]] is an accessory boxed set for the [[Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space|Spelljammer]] campaign setting, focusing on combat in fantasy space.

{{Quote|The worlds of [[Wildspace|fantasy space]] are legion. Not all are friendly. The spider-like [[Neogi]] slavers, the cold and calculating [[Mind flayers|Mind Flayers]], the savage [[Scro]], and others all build [[Spelljammer|great ships of war]] to catch the magical currents of space.<br />Now YOU can face the perils of deadly combat in the depths of the void. This game accessory gives you the chance to storm enemy ships or brave a barrage of [[wizard]] [[spell]]s that could tear your ship apart.}}
