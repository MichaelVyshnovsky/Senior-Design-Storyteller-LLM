        "mainbody": "ead Gods is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module. It is part of the Planescape campaign setting.\nDead Gods written by Monte Cook and was published by TSR, Inc. in 1997. It is composed of two adventures which revolve around the theme of death and resurrection of a god Out of the Darkness and Into the Light. Each adventure can be played separately, although the two plots can be woven together by the Dungeon Master.\nThe first adventure, Out of the Darkness, occupies the majority of the volume, extending from pages 5 to 124. This adventure is structured into an introduction, nine chapters, and three interludes. It presents an epic quest, emblematic of the aspirations of true heroes, requiring cautious navigation to avert a descent into disaster.\nThe second adventure, Into the Light, is more concise, spans pages 125 to 156. Despite its shorter length, it is a comprehensive scenario. This adventure illustrates the potential outcomes in Sigil when obstinate political dynamics intersect with mystical religious beliefs. Into the Light is divided into an introduction and three parts.\nOut of the Darkness\nOrcus, having grown complacent, fell victim to Kiaransalee, the drow goddess of vengeance. Kiaransalee assassinated Orcus, usurping his domain and power, and even erased his name throughout the planes. Orcus inert form remained on the Astral Plane until he began to reanimate in a diminished, undead state as a shadowy and less potent deity named Tenebrous. Seeking retribution across the multiverse, Tenebrous rallied his former demonic servants, now undead visages, to amass intelligence for his vengeance. \nHe revisited an old stronghold on the Negative Energy Plane and encountered a potent magical force known as the Last Word in Arborea, capable of slaying gods. Meanwhile, Kiaransalees minions had hidden his formidable artifact, the Wand of Orcus, in a stone vault on Pandemonium. Tenebrous, assuming the guise of Primus, lord of the modrons, harnessed their capabilities to locate his Wand. Upon discovering the drow responsible for concealing the Wand, Tenebrous plotted to reclaim his rule over the Abyss. The adventure tasks players with deciphering Tenebrouss machinations to retain control of the Wand, ultimately thwarting one of Orcuss acolytes from resurrecting him once more on the Astral Plane.\nInto the Light\nThis adventure is set in the mystical city of Sigil. Centuries ago, the last adherents of a forgotten god assembled his remains, brought from the Astral Plane, into a monument of five standing stones within the city. As the monuments origins faded from memory, a new religious sect erected a temple around the stones, which subsequently fell into obscurity and abandonment. The temple, purchased centuries later by a wealthy individual named Cruigh Manathas, was slated for demolition, leading to the mysterious disappearance of the demolition crew, who were absorbed by the standing stones. Unbeknownst to most, Argesh Fiord, a fighter mourning his wifes death, orchestrated these events to incite conflict among Sigils factions. The players are tasked with uncovering and disrupting Fiords plans, aiming to avert the looming war and resolve the ancient enigma of the standing stones.\nOut Of Darkness\n* Foreword\n* Introduction\n* Chapter 1 Circean Embers\n* Chapter 2 Crux\n* Interlude 1\n* Chapter 3 Masks\n* Chapter 4 Message From Thanatos\n* Chapter 5 The Bottom of the Multiverse\n* Interlude 2\n* Chapter 6 The Vault of the Drow\n* Chapter 7 The Ruins of Pellion\n* Interlude 3\n* Chapter 8 Deepest Pandemonium\n* Chapter 9 The Dead-Book of the Gods\nInto The Light\n* Introduction\n* Part One Initial Forays\n* Part Two Crossed Swords\n* Part Three Mysteries of the Stones\nAppendix\n* Visage\n* Statistics\n* Player Illustrations\nDead Gods Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Designers Monte Cook\n* Editors Ray Vallese, Michele Carter\n* Cover Artist rk post\n* Interior Artists rk post, Adam Rex, Josh Timbrook\n* Cartographer Dennis Kauth, Rob Lazzaretti\n* Typography Angelika Lokotz\n* Graphic Design Dawn Murin, Matt Adelsperger\n* Graphics Coordinator Dawn Murin, Paul Hanchette\n* Project Managers Karen Boomgarden, Steve Winter \n* Electronic Prepress Coordinator Dave Conant\n* Playtescers Carrie Bebris, Michele Carter, Bruce Cordell, Ted Stark, Keith Strohm, Ray Vallese"
