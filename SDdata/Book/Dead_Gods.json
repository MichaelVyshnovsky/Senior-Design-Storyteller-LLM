        "mainbody": "'''''Dead Gods''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure module. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|''Dead Gods is a 176-page adventure book featuring two scenarios that can be played separately or linked together. In the first, the heroes are drawn into an epic quest to uncover the secrets behind the return of an infamous AD&D villain long though dead. In the second, the city of [[Sigil]] threatens to explode in a faction war for control of an old church and a mysterious force lurking within it. Dead Gods also features a MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM entry for a brand-new fiend, full-color illustrations to bring scenes alive for players, and a poster sheet of maps for the Dungeon Master. Dead Gods builds on story elements first explored in the PLANESCAPE adventure anthology [[The Great Modron March]], though that product is not required to use this one.''}}",
        "Description": "''Dead Gods'' written by Monte Cook and was published by TSR, Inc. in 1997. It is composed of two adventures which revolve around the theme of death and resurrection of a god: ''Out of the Darkness'' and ''Into the Light''. Each adventure can be played separately, although the two plots can be woven together by the Dungeon Master.\n\nThe first adventure, ''Out of the Darkness,'' occupies the majority of the volume, extending from pages 5 to 124. This adventure is structured into an introduction, nine chapters, and three interludes. It presents an epic quest, emblematic of the aspirations of true heroes, requiring cautious navigation to avert a descent into disaster.\n\nThe second adventure, ''Into the Light,'' is more concise, spans pages 125 to 156. Despite its shorter length, it is a comprehensive scenario. This adventure illustrates the potential outcomes in Sigil when obstinate political dynamics intersect with mystical religious beliefs. ''Into the Light'' is divided into an introduction and three parts.",
        "Synopsis": ";Out of the Darkness\n[[Orcus]], having grown complacent, fell victim to [[Kiaransalee]], the [[drow]] goddess of vengeance. Kiaransalee assassinated Orcus, usurping his domain and power, and even erased his name throughout the planes. Orcus' inert form remained on the [[Astral Plane]] until he began to reanimate in a diminished, [[undead]] state as a shadowy and less potent deity named [[Tenebrous]]. Seeking retribution across the multiverse, Tenebrous rallied his former demonic servants, now undead visages, to amass intelligence for his vengeance. \n\nHe revisited an old stronghold on the [[Negative Energy Plane]] and encountered a potent magical force known as the Last Word in [[Arborea]], capable of slaying gods. Meanwhile, Kiaransalee's minions had hidden his formidable artifact, the [[Wand of Orcus]], in a stone vault on [[Pandemonium]]. Tenebrous, assuming the guise of [[Primus]], lord of the [[modron]]s, harnessed their capabilities to locate his Wand. Upon discovering the drow responsible for concealing the Wand, Tenebrous plotted to reclaim his rule over the Abyss. The adventure tasks players with deciphering Tenebrous's machinations to retain control of the Wand, ultimately thwarting one of Orcus's acolytes from resurrecting him once more on the Astral Plane.\n;Into the Light\nThis adventure is set in the mystical city of Sigil. Centuries ago, the last adherents of a forgotten god assembled his remains, brought from the Astral Plane, into a monument of five standing stones within the city. As the monument's origins faded from memory, a new religious sect erected a temple around the stones, which subsequently fell into obscurity and abandonment. The temple, purchased centuries later by a wealthy individual named [[Cruigh Manathas]], was slated for demolition, leading to the mysterious disappearance of the demolition crew, who were absorbed by the standing stones. Unbeknownst to most, [[Argesh Fiord]], a fighter mourning his wife's death, orchestrated these events to incite conflict among Sigil's factions. The players are tasked with uncovering and disrupting Fiord's plans, aiming to avert the looming war and resolve the ancient enigma of the standing stones.",
