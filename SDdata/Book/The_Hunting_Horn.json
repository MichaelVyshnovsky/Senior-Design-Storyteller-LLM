        "mainbody": "he Hunting Horn was a periodical chapbook that dealt with topics of sexual nature, published in the cities of Athkatla and Crimmor in Amn.\nThe Hunting Horn was a bi-monthly or, sometimes, quarterly chapbook, printed with the help of the Church of Sharess coin. Each issue was printed in thousands and was sold to caravan merchants in Athkatla and Crimmor to be widely distributed along trade routes of Faer√ªn. Most were sold to festhalls, certain shopkeeps, and interested individuals.\nEach issue usually contained art and short fiction of titillating nature. Most featured humans, elves, and half-elves in various pleasurable yet scandalous groups and positions. On occasion, the Horn printed answers and advice in response to the readers questions regarding techniques, oils, aphrodisiacs, and intoxicating libations. The publication did not discriminate regarding sexual preference, gender, sex, and happily catered to those inspired by works featuring members of different species intermingling or those titillated by whips and chains, as well as many other similar topics.\nPlaces of worship dedicated to Sune and Sharess often had copies of the Horn, usually procured by the members of the clergy, or donated by the goddesses devotees, however, both churches often printed and distributed their own publications of the same nature."
