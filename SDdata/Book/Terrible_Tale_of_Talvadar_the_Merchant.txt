'''''Terrible Tale of Talvadar the Merchant''''' was a farcical comedy play that, unlike other farces, remained popular in [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
The play was a jests-filled comedy about Talvadar, a fool of a man. He traveled down the road, oblivious to bandits and swindlers who accidentally revealed their secrets to the happy dim-witted man. The scoundrels rushed after Talvadar to ensure their secrets were taken to the man's grave, but comedically, the oblivious fool escaped harm through blind luck as his pursuers stabbed and clubbed each other, trying to kill the strolling man.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, ''Terrible Tale of Talvadar the Merchant'' was considered a beloved classic. It was an evergreen part of [[The Crown Aflame]]'s repertoire in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]].
