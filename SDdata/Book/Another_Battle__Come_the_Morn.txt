==Excerpt==
Here are a few stanzas from the song:
:''The night so long and lonely-o''
:''Long time 'til dawn still to go''
:''And I wait all alone-ee-o''
:''Drink ye, drinky, gone below''
:''For wet courage inside to grow''
:''To face another sun and battle-o''
:''It may be the last I'll ever see''
:''Gods all now watch over me''
:''As this lonely song I sing''
:''For I would one day be a king''
:''…''
