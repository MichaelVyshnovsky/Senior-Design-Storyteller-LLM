Another Battle, Come the Morn was a drinking song popular with various mercenaries across Faerûn. The composer was unknown.
Here are a few stanzas from the song
The night so long and lonely-o
Long time til dawn still to go
And I wait all alone-ee-o
Drink ye, drinky, gone below
For wet courage inside to grow
To face another sun and battle-o
It may be the last Ill ever see
Gods all now watch over me
As this lonely song I sing
For I would one day be a king
