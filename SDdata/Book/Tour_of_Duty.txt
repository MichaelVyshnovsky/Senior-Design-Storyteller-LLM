'''Tour of Duty''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

==Plot==
As [[Waterdeep]]'s [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|city guard]] is crippled by illness, volunteers are needed to relieve a northern outpost. At the same time, [[ranger]]s from the same outpost discover a [[dragon]]'s hoard and help themselves to some choice items, much to the anger of the dragon.

{{quote|The trouble began when the rangers from a distant outpost of Waterdeep found an unguarded treasure in a dragon's lair. "We'll just take a few things," they said. "It will never notice."|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}
