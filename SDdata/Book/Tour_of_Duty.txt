Tour of Duty is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.
As Waterdeeps city guard is crippled by illness, volunteers are needed to relieve a northern outpost. At the same time, rangers from the same outpost discover a dragons hoard and help themselves to some choice items, much to the anger of the dragon.
