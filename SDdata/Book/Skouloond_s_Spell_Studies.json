        "mainbody": "Skouloonds Spell Studies was an academic magic textbook written by the Netherese arcanist Skouloond.\nThe book was an examination of verbal, somatic, and material components. It focused on how to alter and substitute these components, for the purpose of modifying existing spells and inventing new ones. It was similar to a substitution guide for cooking, teaching spellcasters the basics of adapting and experimenting with known formulae.\nSkouloonds Spell Studies was considered a classic and foundational piece of arcane science by the arcanists of Netheril during the Age of Discovery ( onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy of it, along with others such as Haerros Veltanabula, Sarturls Study of Magical Fields, Oloams on Serpentine Matters, and Ivrynxras Exploration of Enchantments."
