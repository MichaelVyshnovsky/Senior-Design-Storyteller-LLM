'''''The Tome of Blasphemous Magic''''' was an [[evil]] [[spellbook]] that could be found in the Realms ''circa'' the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The book espoused certain profane and sacrilegious statements as if they were factual, inherent truths. It contained the specifications for warped, [[necromantic]] [[ritual]]s, and maligned iterations of certain oft-used spells.

Aside from its contents, the spellbook itself was truly a gruesome sight to behold. The dual covers of pressed bone held within them pages made of soft flesh, inscribed within which were words written in the blood of innocent souls.

==Powers==
The ''Tome of Blasphemous Magic'' allowed the reader to learn the following spells: ''[[enervating grasp]]'', ''[[orb of black flame]]'', and ''[[withering tendrils]]''.

Any being that read from the tome had to endure its most horrific power: the ability to destroy [[soul]]s outright. Failure to withstand this effect left a reader transformed into a soulless corpse; the spirit could only be restored by means of ''[[wish|powerful magic]]'' or an act by a diving being.

==History==
For a time during the late 15{{th}} century, ''The Tome of Blasphemous Magic'' could be found within [[Ironaxe Halls]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Arvik Zaltos]], who was loaned the book by none other than [[Szass Tam]].
