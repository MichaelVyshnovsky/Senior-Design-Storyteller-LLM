Dragonwall, by Troy Denning, is the second book in The Empires trilogy.
Batu Min Ho, a general in Shou Lungs military, survives a crushing defeat at the hands of the Tuigan overseen by Kwan Chan Sen, Minister of War. Kwan develops a grudge against Batu. It’s revealed that Kwan and Ju-Hai Chou, the Minister of State, cooperated to try to assassinate Yamun Khahan without the Emperor’s knowledge, starting the war. 
Batu is placed in charge of Shou Lung’s army by the emperor. He plans to lure the army to attack a city, then sneak a larger force behind the Tuigan and surround and annihilate them. Meanwhile, his wife, Wu, investigates reports of a spy in the Imperial court and discovers that Ting Mei Wan, the Minister of State security, is the spy. In response, Ting kills Wu and her children. 
Batu’s plan is partially successful, and he traps the Tuigan inside a city, where they discover proof of the ministers behind the assassination attempt. Yamun Kahan offers peace if the Emperor send the two ministers, and the Emperor agrees, also executing Ting Mei Wan for her treachery. The Emperor offers Batu any of the positions of the three executed ministers, but Batu refuses to forgive the Emperor for allowing his children to be harmed, and defects to join the Tuigan. The Tuigan travel west and find Thay, striking a deal with Szass Tam to pass through and invade Rashemen instead.
