Cities of Bone is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.
This boxed set includes six dungeon crawls, mostly portable anywhere in Zakhara, half for beginning characters and the rest for mid-to high levels. The text offers advice for creating a spooky atmosphere, and the historical reasons behind the construction of each dungeon. Half the text makes up the adventure, "Court of the Necromancers", where in the undead city of Ysawis, the player characters get involved in the intrigues of a couple of repugnant wizards and a senile lich.
