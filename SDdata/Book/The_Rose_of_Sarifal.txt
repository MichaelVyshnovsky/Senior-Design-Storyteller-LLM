'''''The Rose of Sarifal''''' is a novel set in the [[Moonshae Isles]] written by [[Paulina Claiborne]].

{{quote|''Cloaked in mist and layered in magic, the denizens of Moonshae Isles move in secret circles as capricious rulers vie for power.''

''High Lady [[Ordalf]] wanted her niece, the princess known as the [[Rose of Sarifal]], dead. Instead, the young regent was secreted away by the high lady’s opponents. For years the [[eladrin]] queen of [[Gwynneth|Gwynneth Isle]] has searched for evidence of her niece's death, and word has finally come in the form of a castaway's tale. The princess lives on the island of [[Moray]] - a mad beauty who leads a nation of [[lycanthrope]]s.''
 
''As long as her niece is alive, Lady Ordalf cannot rest secure in her claim to the throne. Enlisting a band of adventurers to seek out the princess is the first step toward stemming the Rose of Sarifal and her tide of wolves. Will those heroes see the same threat the queen sees in the beautiful young maiden?''}}
