'''''A Primer on Mythical Beasts''''' was a [[book]] that focused on various creatures of legends, such as [[miniature giant space hamster]]s, published before [[1492 DR]].

==Description==
The primer was a heavy book bound in a [[gold]]-trimmed cover and embossed with outlines of various fantastical creatures.

==Content==
Each chapter of the book focused on a single beast of myth and legend and their cultural origins.

===Chapter 5===
This chapter of the book was dedicated to a strange cryptid known as a miniature giant space hamster. Legends claimed that these creatures rarely visited the [[Prime Material plane]], and when they did, miniature giant space hamsters chose muscled male [[human]]s as their loyal steeds. Another claim talked about the wellspring of indescribable power hidden within these majestic beasts that granted their steeds magical or mundane courage. Another tale that was never confirmed claimed that miniature giant space hamsters fed on humans' eyes.

==History==
In 1492 DR, a copy of this enlightening book was left on a granite bench in the [[Emerald Grove]] of the [[Western Heartlands]].
