'''''Treasure Hunt''''' is a 1{{st}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure that was later retconned into the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting when the [[Korinn Archipelago]] that the adventure was set in was made a part of the [[Moonshae Isles]].

{{Quote|''Marooned on a barren isle...''

''The island of Viledel, the mighty Sea King, was sacked by a pirate army 60 years ago. Its destruction was so complete that even the location of the island was lost and forgotten. Despite the rumors of immense treasures still hidden in the ruined stronghold, no one ever found the Sea King's island again.''

''Until now. Through a cruel twist of fate, a small band of unwilling adventurers is washed ashore on a small barren island, and discovers what remains of Viledel's settlement. But they aren't alone; marauding orcs and goblins have found the island too, and are frantically searching for the lost hoard. In this desperate treasure hunt, the real payoff may be survival.''

'''''Treasure Hunt''' is different from other AD&D game adventures. The player characters begin the game at 0 level, without choosing a class, and must work their way up to 1st level. It is perfect for a group of beginning players or experienced players looking for a new and different challenge.''}}

==Description==
''Treasure Hunt'' was written by [[Aaron Allston]], and featured a cover by [[Jeff Easley]] and interior illustrations by [[Stephen Fabian]]. It was published by TSR in 1986 as a 36-page booklet with a 3-panel outer folder. Included in the module is a 12-page removable inner section. 

''Treasure Hunt'' is an adventure designed for zero-level characters. The player characters earn their way to 1st level. The scenario allows the characters to evolve into their roles as adventurers, instead of starting them out on that career. Those who fight well become fighters, those who study the magical items found along the way become magic-users, those who attempt thieving activities become thieves, and so on. Each character's actions and attitudes determine that character's character class.

Each character's behavior also determines their alignment. The Dungeon Master (DM) makes alignment checks, and keeps track of how the characters behave in terms of role-playing and with handling magic and combat, recording how a character is developing towards a first-level character with a character class. The module includes record sheets as handouts for the DM to track PC behaviors.

There is a two-page "Players' Introduction" at the beginning of the adventure that each player is supposed to read themself. The adventure includes a two-page appendix entitled "If Things Go Wrong", which is a detailed, episode-by-episode treatment of ways to handle the player characters if they don't do what they are expected to do during the course of the adventure.

==Summary==
The player characters must evolve into their roles as the adventure progresses, beginning as slaves on a galley who become freed after a shipwreck on an island where orcs and goblins contend over a treasure.

The characters begin in the Korinn Archipelago, and have been captured by slavers. A sea storm sends the pirate ship on which the characters are being held off course, and it crashes on an island once ruled by Viledel, the Sea King. On this island, a treasure has become the cause of a battle between orcs and goblins. The characters begin with no weapons, no money, and no possessions. After the shipwreck, the characters' freedom is able to develop gradually, allowing them to make meaningful choices which will help them determine their career
