        "Description": "It was bound in black leather and inscribed with the [[Espruar|high elven runes]] for 'D', 'Q', 'q'. The tome was locked by a snap.\n\nThe Dellanil Quil'quien contained arcane writings, using old elven symbols.\n\nThere was an account of how King Dellanil Quil'quien awakened the trees of Shilmista and how the elves crushed an invading force of [[goblins]] with the help of the trees.<ref> This was also, not a simple spell, but a calling to awaken the powers of the forest.<ref>",
        "History": "[[Cadderly Bonaduce]] found the tome in a deserted cave in the [[Daoine Dune]] in the {{yearlinkName|1361}}. A dream, or more a vision finally helped Cadderly to understand and translate the ancient writings.<ref>\n\nCadderly and [[Elbereth]], the elven prince of Shilmista, recited the words of the summons at [[Sildritch Trea]] and awakened a couple of ancient [[oak]]s to help conquer the [[orc]]ish, [[goblinoid]], and [[giant]] forces of the [[ogrillon]] [[Ragnor]] and free Shilmista once again.<ref>"
