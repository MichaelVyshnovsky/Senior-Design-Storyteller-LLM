        "mainbody": "Teachings of Loss The Nightsinger was a book of Sharran dogma, printed in the ancient times, long before the 15 century DR.\nThis Sharran book was stored in the library of the Gauntlet of Shar, an ancient temple dedicated to the Mistress of the Night and training the Dark Justiciars. The book talked about the goddess opposition to the Nightsong as only the Nightsinger herself could silence her. It discussed the Churchs belief that the creation of light was a mistake and that life itself was naught but an illusion. Because of that, the falsehoods and lies of the discordant Nightsong disturbed Shaars oblivion. As a Dark Justiciar, those who believed these teachings took on an unholy mission to silence the song."
