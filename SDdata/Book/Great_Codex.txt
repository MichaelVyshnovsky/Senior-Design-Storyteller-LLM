The '''Great Codex''' was a compendium of all the laws of the city of [[Procampur]] in the [[Vast]].

It was compiled in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], as a grand project to copy all of Procampur's existing laws into a single tome, which would be installed in a grand library. Scribes and legal scholars accompanied the city's ruling [[Thultyrl]] everywhere to continue the work. They even worked on it while on campaign, such as in the [[1246 DR|the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR]], when the Thultyrl led an army to liberate the allied city of [[Tsurlagol]] from an [[orc]] and [[goblinoid]] horde.{{CotMD-time}}

However, his [[Hamayarch]], [[the Pearl]], predicted that he was destined to die young and in battle. Believing that he would go on to become a good king and complete the Great Codex, she may have orchestrated a wound he suffered on a hunting trip and secretly prevented his wounds from healing to keep him away from the front-lines.
