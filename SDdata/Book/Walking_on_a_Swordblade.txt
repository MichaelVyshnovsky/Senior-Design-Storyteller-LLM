It was a thrill, my first handful of gold. More coin than most men ever see in a lifetime of toil! Beautiful, gleaming [[gold]], worked in delicate designs of lost [[Myth Drannor]]! Heavy and soft in my fingers as I turned them over and over... it was a joy, that night! And I had won all this with the strength of my own wits and swordarm!

The next gold gave me a brief pleasure—I'd done it again! Soon, though, the gold, the [[silver]], even the [[gem]]s failed to excite. I began to understand the hunger of older warriors after [[magic]]. At least it carried its own dangers, its own living, waiting thrill.

For me, adventure grew stale. When I look back now, 'tis not the great triumphs I recall, not the evil [[dragon]] dying under my blade, or the [[lich]] crumbling to dust as we fought—'tis the laughter of friends around a campfire, and the feel of my first gold in my fingers. Not because they were gold, but because they were MINE.|Szuszalan, ''Walking on a Swordblade''}}

==Contents==
The book was a biography of Szuszalan's adventuring life as a member of the [[Circle of Steel]] and as founder of [[The Company of the Fiery Fane]], and was written looking back on her life from her old age and retirement to [[Goldenfields]]. [[Elminster]] and [[Ed of the Greenwood]] used the above passage as an example of the importance of adventures and also of the short-lived nature of pleasure and triumph.
