        "mainbody": "'''''Here's a Health to the Company''''' was a song about lovers and companions parting that was performed and enjoyed in [[Faer√ªn]].The title of the song is unknown, but the lyrics are very closely derived from the real-world folk song \"Here's a Health to the Company\". The name of its real counterpart is used for convenience.",
        "History": "[[File:Beckside song.jpg|thumb|300px|''Lunasa (right) and Merlin (left) performing for no particular audience.'']]\nThe song was performed as a duet by the [[bard]] [[Lunasa Eveningwood]] and her companion [[Merlin Fastfoot]] while they stayed at [[Beckside Castle]] in [[Cormyr]] one night during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They also sang ''[[The Crafty Maid's Policy]]'' and ''[[The Mermaid]]'' together.",
        "Lyrics": "{{quote|''Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme,<br/>come lift up your voices in chorus with mine.<br/>Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain,<br/>for we may and might never all meet here again.<br/><br/>Here's a health to the company and one to my lass,<br/>let us drink and be merry all out of one glass.<br/>Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain,<br/>for we may and might never all meet here again.<br/><br/>Here's a health to the dear lass that I love so well,<br/>her style and her beauty, sure none can excel.<br/>There's a smile upon her countenance as she sits on my knee,<br/>sure there's no one in this wide world as happy as we.<br/><br/>Here's a health to the company and one to my lass,<br/>let us drink and be merry all out of one glass.<br/>Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain,<br/>for we may and might never all meet here again.<br/><br/>Our ship lies at harbor, she's ready to dock,<br/>I hope she's safe landed without any shock.<br/>If ever we should meet again by land or by sea,<br/>I will always remember your kindness to me.<br/><br/>Here's a health to the company and one to my lass,<br/>let us drink and be merry all out of one glass.<br/>Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain,<br/>for we may and might never all meet here again.''\n|The lyrics, as sung by Lunasa and Merlin}}"
