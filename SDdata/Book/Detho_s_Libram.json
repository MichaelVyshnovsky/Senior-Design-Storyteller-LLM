Brass hoops bound the parchment together.\nWritten by the mage Detho, the book was left in the possession of Piergeiron, who stored it in the library within Piergeirons Palace in Waterdeep. Famous mages such as Elminster Aumar, Khelben Arunsun, and Laeral Silverhand read the book and copied spells into their own personal collections. The book was last in the possession of Peregar, who took the book with him during an ill-fated expedition into the Northlands.
