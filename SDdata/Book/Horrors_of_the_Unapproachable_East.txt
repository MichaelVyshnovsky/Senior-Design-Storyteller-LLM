{{quote|
The [[Tharchion]]s of [[Thay]] once held dances that would end in death for those slaves who danced poorly.<br/>After the rise of the necropolis, these rituals were not abandoned, as one might expect under the rule of [[Szass Tam]]. Instead, the [[necromancer]] king insisted they continue, with only some of the slaves being aliveâ€”and others [[undead]].<br/>Now, dancing poorly meant becoming a meal for those who danced well.|Excerpt from ''Horrors of the Unapproachable East''}}

==Contents==
Catalan's work offered guidance and information on the dark practices of the [[Red Wizard]] nation of Thay. Unlike other tomes penned about the region in years past, ''Horrors of the Unapproachable East'' updated the lore to reflect Thay's new status quo as a nation ruled by the [[lich]] Szass Tam and his undead servants.

==History==
''Horrors of the Unapproachable East'' was published in the {{YearlinkName|1474}}.
