Uthgars Legacy was a tome that delved into the history of Uthgar the Battle Father and his mortal origins.
This book tales about the namesake and the creator of the Uthgardt barbarian tribes of the north Faer√ªn. The author talked about several historical theories of Uthgars origins. Some believed that he was offspring of Beorunnas, the namesake of Beorunnas Well, and others claimed that he was the child of Tempus himself.
One thing was clear, however, the man who was believed to be Uthgar lived a life three times longer that a life of an ordinary human. He was a powerful and proud warrior who was elevated to divinity after dying in a one-on-onw battle against a frost giant Gurt. The legends said Uthgar conquered primeval best spirits in battle and shared their immortal gifts with his followers that became the Uthgardt barbarian at his death and apotheosis.
Scholars concluded what it was very likely that the fabled Uthgar was a Ruathym northman Uther Gardolfsson. His long life left historical footprints of many raids and looting of Illuskan, before assembling his barbarian dynasty. The author of the book argued that Uthgars accession indeed happen but at the barbarian kings deathbed, sponsored by a deity of war who was impressed by his fighting spirit and accomplishments.
Copies of Uthgars Legacy could be found around Neverwinter, and the general area of the Sword Coast North circa 1372 DR and the Moonsea region around 1373 DR.
