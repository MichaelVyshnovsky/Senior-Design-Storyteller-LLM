{{quote|That so fat and grasping a man<br/>
Should have the very stars bright in his hands<br/>
To blind us all with their shining<br/>
Blotting out his faults in plenty.<br/>
<br/>
His huge and howling ghost<br/>
Doth prowl the world entire<br/>
but loves and lingers most<br/>
upon this very same and lonesome spot<br/>
Where gods loved, men killed, and careless [[elves]] forgot.<br/>

==History==
The sage [[Beldrune]] claimed he favored the play ''Broderick Betrayed'', once, in a conversation with his fellow [[Tabarast]] during the spring of the {{yearlinkName|761}} while he was working in [[Moonshorn Tower]]. Tabarast then recited part of the play, Beldrune called him out for it, as they had agreed not to talk about the Chosen of Mystra, strongly implying the play was about them.
