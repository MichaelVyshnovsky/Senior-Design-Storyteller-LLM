'''''The Doctrine of Discord''''' was a religious book dedicated to [[Bane]], the [[evil]] [[deity]] of tyranny.

==Description==
The tome outlined ways to make pacts with and gain the favor of the Black Lord. It was quite large and gave details of cruel [[ritual]]s involving the use of torture. The Blackdaggers' copy was stained with the blood of the bandits' victims and was filled with rambling notes about their plans and their devotion to Bane.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a copy of the tome came into the possession of [[Traven Blackdagger|Traven]] and [[Malus Blackdagger]] of the [[Blackdagger Bandits]], who attempted to use it to gain power. It was found by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] during their struggles against the Blackdaggers in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.
