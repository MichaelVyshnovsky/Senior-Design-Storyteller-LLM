During the Time of Troubles, Mystra transfers most of her power into Elminster. However, he cannot access this power, and it cuts him off from his spells. Storm Silverhand sends two Harpers, Itharr and Belkram, to watch over him. He falls in with Sharantyr, discovering a Zhentarim portal in Daggerdale leading to the High Dale, where Angruin “Stormcloak” Myrvult, Zhentarim Wizard, and Heladar Longspear, commander of the Wolves mercenaries, have deposed Irreph Mulmar and taken over the dale. The two Harpers free Irreph and the three lead a revolt against the castle, where they are joined by Elminster and Sharantyr. Angruin and Heladar are killed and the Wolves overthrown, but a spy for Manshoon, Xanther Srildar, tells Manshoon that Elminster has no magic. Elminster and Sharantyr gate to the ruins of Spellgard, followed by Itharr and Belkram, where they are attacked by Zhentarim and Manshoon. Saharel, an archlich and former lover of Elminster, sacrifices herself to kill Manshoon. Nouméa Drathchuld, Mystra’s Magister, arrives just after the confrontation. Elminster travels to the Flame Void and returns Mystra’s power. Mystra grants Sharantyr, Itharr, and Belkram magic immunity as thanks for watching over Elminster, whose magic returns without Mystra’s power.
