'''''Shadows of Doom''''' is a novel by [[Ed Greenwood]] and the first book in [[The Shadow of the Avatar Trilogy]].

{{quote|''It was the eve of the [[Time of Troubles]]. The chaos of spilled blood, lawless strife, monsters unleashed, and avatars roaming [[Faerûn]] was still to come. The [[gods]] were about to be summoned to a reckoning, and among them was [[Mystra]], goddess of all [[magic]]. She knew it was likely she, along with the other gods, was about to be stripped of godhood.''

''Yet to shatter governance over magic would mean ruin for the world she loved.  So Mystra made certain preparations, looking always for a worthy successor . . . yet until the Ascension of that worthy one, her power must be preserved.''

''A lone mortal must carry the greatest share of her divine energy, the [[silver fire]], until the mantle of magic could be reclaimed. It was the fate of this mortal to risk being destroyed or driven wild, without warning.''

''It was [[Elminster]]'s Doom.''|[http://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Doom-Forgotten-Realms-Shadow/dp/0786903007/ Amazon.com]}}

==Summary==
During the [[Time of Troubles]], [[Mystra]] transfers most of her power into [[Elminster]]. However, he cannot access this power, and it cuts him off from his spells. [[Storm Silverhand]] sends two Harpers, [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]] and [[Belkram Hardeth|Belkram]], to watch over him. He falls in with [[Sharantyr]], discovering a [[Zhentarim]] portal in [[Daggerdale]] leading to the [[High Dale]], where Angruin “Stormcloak” Myrvult, Zhentarim Wizard, and Heladar Longspear, commander of the Wolves mercenaries, have deposed [[Irreph Mulmar]] and taken over the dale. The two Harpers free Irreph and the three lead a revolt against the castle, where they are joined by Elminster and Sharantyr. Angruin and Heladar are killed and the Wolves overthrown, but a spy for [[Manshoon]], [[Xanther Srildar]], tells Manshoon that Elminster has no magic. Elminster and Sharantyr gate to the ruins of [[Spellgard]], followed by Itharr and Belkram, where they are attacked by Zhentarim and Manshoon. [[Saharel]], an archlich and former lover of Elminster, sacrifices herself to kill Manshoon. [[Nouméa Drathchuld]], Mystra’s [[Magister]], arrives just after the confrontation. Elminster travels to the Flame Void and returns Mystra’s power. Mystra grants Sharantyr, Itharr, and Belkram magic immunity as thanks for watching over Elminster, whose magic returns without Mystra’s power.
