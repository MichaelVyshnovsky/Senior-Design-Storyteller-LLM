'''''Caddelyn's Workbook''''' was the incomplete [[spellbook]] of the long-deceased [[mage]] [[Caddelyn]].

==Description==
The spellbook had a [[silver]]-plated cover of slate, with [[electrum]] hinges, which held together sixteen sheets of parchment.

==History==
Shortly before [[1359 DR]], ''Caddelyn's Workbook'' was looted from [[Caddelyn's tower|his tower]] north of the [[Great Glacier]] by unknown forces. It was briefly recovered by the adventurer [[Dabron Sashenstar]], who held onto it until his party camped for the night, whereupon it went missing again.

==Contents== 
Caddelyn had only begun copying his [[magic]]al knowledge into the workbook before his death while visiting the city of [[Waterdeep]]. Only three of the sixteen pages of the book contained his writing. The portion that was inscribed contained information for two [[spell]]s of Caddelyn's creation, ''[[spell invulnerability]]'' and ''[[Caddelyn's catastrophe]]'', as well as his notes on how to craft a ''[[magemask]]''.
