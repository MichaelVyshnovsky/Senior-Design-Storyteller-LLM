Caddelyns Workbook was the incomplete spellbook of the long-deceased mage Caddelyn.
The spellbook had a silver-plated cover of slate, with electrum hinges, which held together sixteen sheets of parchment.
Shortly before 1359 DR, Caddelyns Workbook was looted from his tower north of the Great Glacier by unknown forces. It was briefly recovered by the adventurer Dabron Sashenstar, who held onto it until his party camped for the night, whereupon it went missing again.
Caddelyn had only begun copying his magical knowledge into the workbook before his death while visiting the city of Waterdeep. Only three of the sixteen pages of the book contained his writing. The portion that was inscribed contained information for two spells of Caddelyns creation, spell invulnerability and Caddelyns catastrophe, as well as his notes on how to craft a magemask.
