Mordenkainen Presents Monsters of the Multiverse is a sourcebook for the 5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
Originally released as part of the Dungeons & Dragons Rules Expansion Gift Set, it was later published as a standalone edition. It is a supplement for the Players Handbook and Monster Manual. In addition, it replaces two other supplements, Mordenkainens Tome of Foes from 2018 and Volos Guide to Monsters from 2016. Both player races and monsters were re-balanced.
