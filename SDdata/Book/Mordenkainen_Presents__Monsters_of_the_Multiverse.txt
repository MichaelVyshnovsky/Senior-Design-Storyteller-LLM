'''''Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse''''' is a sourcebook for the 5{{th}} edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

{{Quote|'''''A bestiary of wondrous friends and foes for the world’s greatest roleplaying game'''''

''Sparkling with the musings of the wizard Mordenkainen, this tome features a host of creatures for use in the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. Compiling and updating monsters that originally appeared in previous D&D fifth edition releases, these creatures represent some of the most benevolent and malevolent forces that D&D heroes might face.''
 
''The book also gathers together fantastical peoples from many different worlds. Each of these peoples represents a race option when you create your D&D character, expanding on the choices in the Player’s Handbook.''
 
''• Includes more than 250 monsters—updates to the monsters include making spellcasters easier for Dungeon Masters to run, giving many monsters more damage and resilience, and improving the organization of the stat blocks themselves''

''• Includes more than 30 playable races—brings the game’s setting-agnostic races into one book, complementing the races in the Player’s Handbook''

''• A multiverse of lore—includes updates to monster lore that refocuses their stories on the D&D multiverse, rather than on any particular world ''}}

==Description==
Originally released as part of the ''Dungeons & Dragons Rules Expansion Gift Set'', it was later published as a standalone edition. It is a supplement for the ''[[Player's Handbook 5th edition|Player's Handbook]]'' and ''[[Monster Manual 5th edition|Monster Manual]]''. In addition, it replaces two other supplements, ''[[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]'' from 2018 and ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters]]'' from 2016. Both player races and monsters were re-balanced.
