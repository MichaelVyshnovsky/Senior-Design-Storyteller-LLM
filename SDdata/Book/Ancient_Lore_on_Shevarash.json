        "mainbody": "'''''Ancient Lore on Shevarash''''' was a tome of knowledge about the [[elf|elven]] god [[Shevarash]] from the [[Hand of the Seldarine]] before the stronghold's fall centuries before [[1281 DR]].",
        "Content": "The book talked about Shevarash's place in the [[Seldarine]], the basics of the faith, and him being the embodiment of the hatred the [[Fair Folk]] felt towards the [[drow]]. The tome described Shevarash's followers—elves and [[half-elves]] who'd suffered loss, especially those who lost their loved ones to drow raids. The book speculated, citing some of the elven theologists, that Shevarash's role was to gather the bitterness and negative feelings that were spawned by the [[Crown Wars]], keeping the infectious hatred, darkness, and evil of the [[Spider Queen]] from spreading to the surface elf population.",
        "History": "''Ancient Lore on Shevarash'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' [[900 DR]] and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By [[1281 DR]], the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the ''Ancient Lore on Shevarash'' copies could be found in the citadel's library curated by [[Custhantos]], along with other rare books."
