        "mainbody": "ncient Lore on Shevarash was a tome of knowledge about the elven god Shevarash from the Hand of the Seldarine before the strongholds fall centuries before 1281 DR.\nThe book talked about Shevarashs place in the Seldarine, the basics of the faith, and him being the embodiment of the hatred the Fair Folk felt towards the drow. The tome described Shevarashs followersâ€”elves and half-elves whod suffered loss, especially those who lost their loved ones to drow raids. The book speculated, citing some of the elven theologists, that Shevarashs role was to gather the bitterness and negative feelings that were spawned by the Crown Wars, keeping the infectious hatred, darkness, and evil of the Spider Queen from spreading to the surface elf population.\nAncient Lore on Shevarash was written and printed sometime between the citadels construction circa 900 DR and its fall in the Battle of Seldarines Hand. By 1281 DR, the citadel was ruined and inhabited by ghostly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the Ancient Lore on Shevarash copies could be found in the citadels library curated by Custhantos, along with other rare books."
