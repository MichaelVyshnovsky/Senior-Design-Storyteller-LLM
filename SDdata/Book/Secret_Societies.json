        "Content": "One chapter in the book talked about the relatively recently formed organization called the [[Kraken Society]] or Heralds of the Sea, with a many-tentacled purple [[squid]] being their symbol. It was said to had been birthed in the ruins of [[Ascale]] out of several groups of criminals, spies, thieves, and priests of [[Umberlee]] from [[north Faer没n]]. All of them served a single overlord of whom little was known. This secret society was prone to assassinate, torture, and kidnap its enemies.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, this book found its way to several locations in the [[northwest Faer没n]], namely the monastic retreat within the [[Dragon's Eye]] on the [[Spine of the World]], and in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, in the library of the [[Black Raven Monastery]], in the mountains above the [[Ice Lakes]] and the [[Black Raven River]]."
