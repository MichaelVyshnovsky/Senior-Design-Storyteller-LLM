'''''Polyhedron Newszine''''', or ''Polyhedron'', was the official publication of the Role Playing Gamers Association (RPGA). Articles were written by gamers for other gamers in the style of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'', and information was included on RPGA membership and events. 
==History==
The magazine was published quarterly from May 1981 to February 1982; bimonthly from April 1983 to May 1991; and monthly from June 1991 to November 1996. 

Publication ceased during the buy-out of [[TSR, Inc.]] by [[Wizards of the Coast]], with no issues released from November 1996 until October 1997. After October 1997 it was published bi-monthly until May 2003, and from June 2003 to August 2004, it was released monthly. 

;TSR:
The majority of issues were published by [[TSR, Inc.]], from May 1981 to April 2000. The magazine was titled ''TSR RPGA'' from May 1981 to February 1982. 

;Merging with Dungeon Magazine:
After [[TSR, Inc.]] was purchased by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1997, publication continued briefly, from [[Polyhedron 142|''Polyhedron'' #142]] to [[Polyhedron 148|''Polyhedron'' #148]]. In [[Polyhedron 148|''Polyhedron'' #148]], it was announced that ''Polyhedron'' and [[Dungeon magazine|''Dungeon magazine'']] were to be merged into one single publication, with dual-numbering for each separate publication. <ref>{{Cite polyhedron/148/Network News}}

;Paizo:
[[Paizo Publishing]] began publishing ''Polyhedron'' in September 2002 until it's final issue in August 2004. This marked the end of the association of ''Polyhedron'' and the RPGA. These issues had a focus on the d20 system.
