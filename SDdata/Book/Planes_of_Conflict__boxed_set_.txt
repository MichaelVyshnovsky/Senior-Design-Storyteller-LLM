Planes of Conflict is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set. It is part of the Planescape campaign setting.
Planes of Conflict was designed by Dale Donovan, Colin McComb, and Monte Cook, and was published by TSR in 1995. The box cover artist is Robh Ruppel, the book cover artists are Tony DiTerlizzi and Robh Ruppel, and the interior artist is Tony DiTerlizzi. 
Planes of Conflict contains six maps and five manuals. The set details the Beastlands, Bytopia, Elysium, Carceri, Gehenna, and the Gray Waste. These planes provide the checks and balances that hold all the other planes in place, despite Law and Chaos trying to control these planes and swing the multiverse their way.
Each of these planes drains the lawful and chaotic tendencies from the personalities of characters who spend time on them, each plane bending characters to its own form of neutrality. This set breaks down the nature, inhabitants, and ecosystems of these six worlds using the quotes, pictures, and slang in signature Planescape style, presenting information as a mixture of gossip, observation, and conjecture.
The referees manual concisely provides a foundation on which to build a game while leaving enough freedom to allow the referee to work creatively. The set includes four quick-start adventures that illustrate what these planes have to offer.
