        "mainbody": "The Rod of Seven Parts is a sourcebook for 2-edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset written by Skip Williams and published in 1996 by TSR, Inc. It details the artifact known as the Rod of Seven Parts, covering its history and including an adventure revolving around collecting its seven parts.\nAt the Dawn of Time, the forces of Law warred with the forces of Chaos for control of the Cosmos. The Battle of Pesh was the climax of this campaign, where the armies of Chaos were led by Miska, the Wolf-Spider, while the forces of Law were championed by the Vaati, or Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Desperately outnumbered, the Wind Dukes fashioned the Rod of Seven Parts, a weapon powerful enough to kill Miska in a single strike. Yet the Battle of Pesh was a draw, as neither Law nor Chaos won the day. The Wind Dukes were decimated, but in the final moments their leader struck Miska with the Rod. Rather than being slain, the Wolf-Spider was mortally wounded and imprisoned for eternity within the Abyss. The resulting balance created the multiverse, with a tense stand-off between order and anarchy. The fate of the multiverse is in the hands of the wielder of the Rod of Seven Parts, for it can still both slay Miska and free him.\nBecause the Rod is so potent, it cannot be conventionally protected. Therefore, to keep it safe, the Wind Dukes designed the separate sections of the Rod to scatter around the globe whenever its full powers were employed by striking Miska. Each piece of the Rod both leads and urges its bearer in the direction of the next section in sequence. Once the first section of the Rod has fallen into the hands of the player characters, they are committed to a quest that will take them the length and breadth of their homeworld, and eventually into the heart of the Abyss.\nThe third segment is held by a cloud giant clan who is at war with a local family of dragons. The party can side with the giants against the dragons and hope to earn the segment as a reward, or else side with the dragons against the giants and infiltrate the giants lair under cover of polymorph."
