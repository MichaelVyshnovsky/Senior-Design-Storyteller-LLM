        "mainbody": "'''''In the Mode of Masters''''' was a [[book]] on the Astral Period in [[Faerûn]]ean art, penned sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Contents": "The book stated that [[Wilhelmina Oates]] was the creator of the Astral Period of art that followed the Classical Period and was in opposition to eachother. The Astral Period was not constrained by the color and material limitations of the true-to-life Classical Period and instead utilized porous borders between segments and included the use of various unconventional materials in painting, like blood and stone, hair sewn into the canvas, and [[chalk]] used to depict skin. Wilhelmina Oates was the person who created the very first distinct piece of art of the Astral Period, allegedly after returning to the [[Prime Material plane]] from a lifetime at the [[Astral Sea]]. She discovered that no time had passed on Prime since her departure and channeled her accumulated wisdom into a new art style. At first, Wilhelmina's art was maligned by the critics, but eventually, it was accepted and hailed a new era of creation in Faerûn.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''In the Mode of Masters'' belonged to the acclaimed painter [[Oskar Fevras]], who kept a copy in his workshop atop his wife's [[Lower City]] manse."
