Castles is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Battlesystem tabletop game. The box set includes three paperback booklets, each covering an imposing castle in a different gaming world. The first booklet, by Jeff Grubb, is about the Zhentarim fortress, Darkhold.
Castles focuses on providing comprehensive information and resources for players and Dungeon Masters who want to incorporate castles into their campaigns.
Castles serves as a guide for building and running castles. It offers a wealth of information, including architectural details, castle layouts, defensive structures, and various features that make castles an integral part of the game. It caters to both players who wish to acquire and maintain their own castles and Dungeon Masters who want to incorporate castles as key locations in their adventures.
Castles provides detailed descriptions of different types of castles, ranging from small keeps to sprawling fortresses. It explores various architectural styles, defensive strategies, and historical context to give players and Dungeon Masters a deeper understanding of the role castles play in a medieval-inspired fantasy setting.
The book offers guidance on designing and customizing castles to suit the needs and aspirations of player characters. It covers aspects such as constructing and fortifying castles, managing resources, staffing the castle with personnel, and handling day-to-day operations. It also delves into the economic and social aspects of castle ownership, including income generation, diplomacy, and potential conflicts with neighboring factions.
In addition to the practical aspects of castle management, Castles introduces new rules and mechanics specific to castle-related activities. This includes siege warfare, castle sieges, castle-based adventures, and the utilization of special castle-related spells and magic items.
The accessory provides a plethora of illustrations, maps, and diagrams to help visualize and understand the concepts presented. It also includes examples of notable castles within Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, offering inspiration and ideas for Dungeon Masters to create their own unique castle settings.
