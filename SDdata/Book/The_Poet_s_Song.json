        "mainbody": "he Poets Song was a series of enchanted scrolls with songs written by the blind poet of the ancient Daargard Keep,  on the shores of Torslunda, sometime long before 1372 DR.\nEach magical scroll of The Poets Song contained one ballad about a different theme and had different magical powers. The Song found among Torleth Mindulspeers treasures was written about the blind poets fear of death. When a bard sang it, they gained a temporary mastery over death while the words of the song drained the life out of surrounding enemies.\nMany, many years before 1372 DR, a nameless blind poet resided in the lone crumbling Daargard Keep on the shores of Torslunda. For years, nightly, the blind poet worked tirelessly under flickering candlelight, putting his thoughts on scrolls in verse. The poet knew a secret method of imbuing his works with magic through powerful blood-scribed runes. Later in his life, the blind poet started feeling the coming cold breath of death, yet he lived long enough to bury his son. \nMany more years later, an unnamed lord and lady arrived at the shores of Torslunda in search of adventure. The couple explored the abandoned Daargard Keep and discovered several of the blind poets magic-imbued scrolls. These wondrous items became the noble familys heirlooms and were guarded, preserved, and passed along from generation to generation. The blind poets songs were sung often, entertaining and captivating the minds of those who had the honor of hearing these ballads.\nIn 1372 DR, one of the Poets Song scrolls was discovered among the seemingly mundane antiques in Torleths Treasures in Gillians Hill. The proprietor was not aware of the scrolls magic nor history and was selling it for mere 400 pieces of gold."
