The Glass Prison is a stand-alone novel by Monte Cook.
Vheod, a cambion marked by a mysterious magic called the Taint, flees the marilith Nethess through a portal, leaving the Abyss for the first time in his life. In the Dalelands, Melann Brandish, a follower of Chauntea, and her brother Whitlock are on a quest to lift a curse, laid on their family by the sorcerer Chareen, before it claims the lives of their parents. They are directed to the Thunder Peaks by an elven spirit and warned of gnolls. They set out by way of Tilverton. Vheod encounters a mysterious duo, Arach and Gyrison, who give him a vision of his grandfather, Chare’en, actually a Balor, not a sorcerer. The vision also shows him Melann and Whitlock, and they direct him to Tilverton. Melann and Whitlock pay Orrag, a half-orc, for directions to the Crypt of Chare’en. Elsewhere in the Dales, the mage known as the Ravenwitch finds gnolls have slain her servant Yrrin. Vheod is attacked by hostile villagers, but encounters a friendly elf named Tianna. Gnolls attack Whitlock and capture Melann. Vheod encounters Orrag and receives the same location given to the siblings. Whitlock rescues Melann from the gnolls. Vheod helps them overcome a second gnoll attack, but they do not believe his warning that Chare’en is a balor, so he accompanies them. Whitlock is captured by a giant raven and while pursuing him, Vheod and Melannn awaken in the dungeon of the Ravenwitch, having lost their memories of the intervening time. They discover memory moss is the culprit and save Whitlock from becoming the Ravenwitch’s new wereraven servant, but she tells Vheod that he is destined to free Chare’en. Vheod discovers that Arach and Gyrison gave the siblings their information about Chare’en and the curse, and they are revealed to be demons, working with Orrag to free Chare’en. Melann and Vheod develop a romantic connection. Vheod and the siblings arrive at the prison and slay Orrag, but Vheod removes the staff that the siblings think will life their family curse, freeing Chare’en in the process.The demon’s power is overwhelming, but the Ravenwitch arrives and gives Vheod an amulet that Orrag had. The amulet was used by Piotyr Braendysh, the wizard who sealed Chare’en, and prevents the demon from harming the wearer. Vheod uses the amulet to kill Chare’en, and Whitlock sets out to lift the curse, while Vheod and Melann set off in search of Vheod’s human family.
