They had paid an import permit and a scroll of sales submission, but a guard stole two kegs of ale specifically because Avarilous was from Ulgarth, then further humiliated him. Avarilous was further cheated by his contact, Daltrice landlord of the Tavern of the Tall Tankard, and the lawlessness was contrasted with Ulgarth. He continues to suffer prejudice from citizens of Tharkar in the famous courtyard tavern. Other visitors included inquisitors from Whitevale, looking for members of the [[Fallen Temple]], northmen, and trade delegates from [[Konigheim]] and [[Doegan]]. The delegates fell into a brawl and a man ended up dead. It was revealed there were multiple double-crossings between agents of Duogan and Konigheim, as both sides attempted to murder one of their own to drag the free states into the conflict on their side. Avarilous was a Ulgarthan agent sent to stop a the plot, as Ulgarth wanted the politics of the five kingdoms to remain in a stalemate, with Konigheim and Doegan continuing to negotiate.\n{{sectstub}}",
