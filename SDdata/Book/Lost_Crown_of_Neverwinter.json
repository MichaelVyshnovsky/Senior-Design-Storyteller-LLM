Yet not all are pleased with the crown's reappearance. Beset by [[Sons of Alagondar|rebels]] and [[Spellplague|plaguechanged]], [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Dagult Neverember]] must hire a group of adventurers to track down the so-called Lost Heir and discover his intentions for the city. The stakes are no less than the lives of the citizens of Neverwinter, for if the heroes fail, [[Neverwinter]] seems doomed to descend into civil war.''\n\n''Lost Crown of Neverwinter is a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] adventure designed for the summer 2011 season of the [[D&D Encounters]] official play program.
