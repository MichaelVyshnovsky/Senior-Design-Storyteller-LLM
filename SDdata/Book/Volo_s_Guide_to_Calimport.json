It was written over [[1364 DR|1364]] to [[1365 DR]], but went officially unreleased, as all final drafts were destroyed by [[Calimshan|Calishite]] [[pasha]]s and agents of [[Rundeen]]. Only Volo's notes and an older draft were extant.\n\nNevertheless, around [[1372 DR]], this older draft was in the holdings at [[Candlekeep]]."
