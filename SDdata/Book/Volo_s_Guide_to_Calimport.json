        "mainbody": "Volos Guide to Calimport was a book written by Volothamp Geddarm. It was a travelogue about the city of Calimport in Calimshan. It was written over 1364 to 1365 DR, but went officially unreleased, as all final drafts were destroyed by Calishite pashas and agents of Rundeen. Only Volos notes and an older draft were extant.\nNevertheless, around 1372 DR, this older draft was in the holdings at Candlekeep."
