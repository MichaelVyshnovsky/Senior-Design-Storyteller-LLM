==Contents==
''The Targe'' was a collection of uplifting romantic stories written for a young female audience, intended to educate them on morals and proper behavior. The stories focused on virtues and vices being justly rewarded, creating what should be uninspired and boring tales. Despite this, the quality of its romantic prose was so exceptional the books came to be widely adored by all who appreciated well-written romances and dalliances.

==History==
The book was written by Lady [[Sarandra Shaelewinter]] of [[Waterdeep]], which was actually a pseudonym used by a noblewoman. Multiple editions of the book were published over time.
