The Tome of Rathdaen was an arcane spellbook penned by Rathdaen, a wizard who traveled Toril extensively. It contained three spells ranging from common to unique or rare.
What remained of this tome was partially preserved in a folder of fine parchment protected by a pair of polished ivory plates. Before it was damaged the tome was believed to have held over 60 potent spells.

Upon his death Rathdaen passed the Tome along to his apprentice Narsel. The Tome was severely damaged during a meteor swarm cast by Sapphail in her attempt to kill Narsel during a duel.
