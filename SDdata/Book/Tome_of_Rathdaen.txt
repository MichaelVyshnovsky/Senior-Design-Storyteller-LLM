What remained of this tome was partially preserved in a folder of fine parchment protected by a pair of polished [[ivory]] plates. Before it was damaged the tome was believed to have held over 60 potent spells.

==Powers==
The ''Tome of Rathdaen'' contained the following spells:
:''[[Ray of Ondovir]]'' &bull; ''[[icelance]]'' &bull; ''[[Xult's magical doom]]''

==History==
Upon his death Rathdaen passed the ''Tome'' along to his apprentice [[Narsel]]. The ''Tome'' was severely damaged during a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' cast by [[Sapphail]] in her attempt to kill Narsel during a duel.
