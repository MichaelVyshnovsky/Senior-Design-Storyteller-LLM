Dead in Thay is an adventure module for the D&D Next/5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, as part of the "Dreams of the Red Wizards" campaign. It was released in April 2014. It was later reprinted in Tales from the Yawning Portal in 2017.
Having located Bloodgate Keep, an assault upon it is led out of the Floshin Estates. The elemental nodes that were helping sustain the portal from Thay are collapsed but when an attempt is made to close the Bloodgate itself, Mennek Ariz calls upon Baazka, who transports both him and Shalendra Floshin away. Trying to protect his niece, Kelson Darktreader is caught up in the transportation magic.
The attacking adventurers were whisked away by the Thayan Resurrection to the Doomvault beneath Thaymount. The rebels claim to have saved the partys lives and expect them to repay the favor by destroying the phylacteries of Szass Tams top lieutenants that are held within.
They venture through the massive and deadly dungeon, locate Shalendra, who was betrayed and imprisoned by her former allies and witness experiments being performed on several captured Chosen before completing their mission.
