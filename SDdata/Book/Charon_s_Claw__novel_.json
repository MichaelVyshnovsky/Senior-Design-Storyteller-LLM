        "mainbody": "Charons Claw is  third novel of The Neverwinter Saga by R.A. Salvatore.\nIn the underground drow city of Menzoberranzan in 1463 DR,\nRavel Xorlarrin, Matron mother Zeerith QXorlarrin’s second son and the leader\nof the House’s wizards, met with the other members of his family. Through\nspying into a magical skull gem possessed by Gromph Baenre, the Archmage of\nMenzoberranzan, Ravel had ascertained that the devastation of the city of\nNeverwinter over a decade earlier had been caused by a fire primordial that was\nmagically entrapped in the ancient dwarven homeland of Gauntlgrym. After Ravel\ntold his family what he had discovered, Zeerith ordered him to lead an\nexpedition to Gauntlgrym and attempt to construct a new Drow city that was\nunder the control of House Xorlarrin in the dwarven stronghold. In addition to\nRavel, Zeerith sent Brachthal Xorlarrin, Ravel’s older brother and father and a\nwizard of diminished power since the Spellplague in 1385 DR Jearth Xorlarrin,\nthe weapons master of the House and Berellip and Saribel Xorlarrin, Ravel’s sisters\nand priestesses of Lolth, the Spider Queen, the evil goddess of the drow. Besides\nthe Xorlarrin nobles, the expeditionary force consisted of one hundred drow, twenty\ndriders, and a large number of goblin slaves. Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre,\nthe unofficial ruler of Menzoberranzan, sent her nephew Tiago Baenre, the assistant\nweapons master of House Baenre, with the Xorlarrin contingent to ensure that\nthe establishment of a drow city in Gauntlgrym followed her wishes. Tiago was accompanied\nby the drow Golfanin, a former warrior and wizard who was now an accomplished\nweaponsmith. \nMeanwhile, in a forest near\nNeverwinter, the drow ranger Drizzt DoUrden\nand the elf warrior Dahlia Sinfelle planned to\njourney to the city. Nearby, the misshapen tiefling warlock Effron Alegni spied on the\ntwo companions and had several members of the Netherese mercenary organization\nknown as Cavus Dun prepare to ambush them. Effron had hired the group of\nmercenaries to kill Drizzt and capture Dahlia. The Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun band consisted of\nJermander, the leader and a swordsman Ratsis, a spider tamer Parbid and\nAfafrenfere, both warrior Monks and friends Amber Gristle O Maul (Ambergris), a Dwarf\npriestess Bol, a large Tiefling Warrior Horrible, a silent female Warrior and The Shifter, a Shadovar mage.\nAlso at that time, a struggle for power was occurring between different\ngroups in Neverwinter. The Shadovar tiefling warlord Herzgo Alegni declared himself the\nruler of Neverwinter and named his Netherese forces as the city’s defenders,\ndespite opposition from the local leader Jelvus Grinch and the settlement’s\ncitizens. Arunika, a succubus disguised as a mysterious Human woman, and her associate Brother Anthus, a priest of Oghma, the god of knowledge, tried to find a way to\nundermine Alegni’s rule while waiting for the eventual return of the Abolethic Sovereignty.\nArunika traveled to the remnants of the Dread Ring, a necromantic area of\ndevastation, in Neverwinter Wood in search of Valindra Shadowmatle, an insane\nlich and the new leader of the Thayan forces in the region following the death\nof the sorceress Sylora Salm. Arunika could not locate Valindra, and instead found\nher imp familiar Invidoo and Sylora, who had been transformed into a deformed\nZombie that was bent in half and unable to walk. Invidoo wanted his freedom\nfrom service to Arunika, who promised to grant it to him if he could find a\nreplacement for himself who was familiar with Drizzt.\nArtemis Entreri, an assassin who was a former nemesis of Drizzt and was now\nessentially Alegni’s slave because he could be controlled by the tiefling’s magical\nsword Charon’s Claw, decided to seek out the Drow Ranger\nand Dahlia. Entreri hoped that the three of them could work together to defeat\nAlegni and find a way to end his servitude to Charon’s Claw. As Drizzt and\nDahlia were journeying toward Neverwinter, the mercenaries of Cavus Dun beset them,\nand during the fight, Entreri arrived and helped the two companions defeat the\nShadovar. Bol, Parbid, Horrible, and Jermander were killed, and the Shifter and\nRatsis fled to the Shadowfell. In the confusion, Ambergris knocked Afafrenfere unconscious\nand carried him away, and the two of them later made their way to Neverwinter.\nAfter the clash, Drizzt, Dahlia, and Entreri joined forces and traveled to\nNeverwinter together to confront Alegni. Dahlia and Entreri began to share a\ncommon bond because of the pain that they had both suffered at the hands of Alegni,\na connection that Drizzt did not share. \nAs the Xorlarrin expedition journeyed through the Underdark, a power\nstruggle began to occur between Ravel, his two priestess sisters, and Tiago as\nto who was in overall command. Eventually, the contingent reached Gauntlgrym\nand defeated the multitude of Dwarf Ghosts guarding the ancient stronghold.\nTiago soon decided to support Ravel, giving the Wizard an advantage over Berellip\nand Saribel, and also allowing him to rise above Brachthal in the hierarchy of\nHouse Xorlarrin. Ravel and the other drow quickly began the process of securing\ncomplete control of Gauntlgrym and reactivating the legendary forges of the\ncity. Although his magical powers were diminished, Brachthal had a major role\nin the expedition’s activities in Gauntlgrym because he was skilled at\ncontrolling Elementals.\nDrizzt, Dahlia, and Entreri decided to secretly enter Neverwinter through\nthe sewers. As the companions made their way through the sewers, they were\ncontinually attacked by a large group of snakes. Drizzt’s ranger knowledge caused\nhim to realize that something was wrong with the high number of snakes, and he\neventually reached the conclusion that they were babies. The trio followed them\nto their \"mother,\" which was really an Aboleth sentry and scout left\nbehind by the Sovereignty. Dahlia and Entreri were subdued by the aboleth’s telepathic\nseduction, but Drizzt’s harrowing encounter with illithids during his journey\nto the surface of Toril over a century earlier gave him the power to resist for\na short time. As Drizzt finally succumbed, his magical panther Guenhwyvar\nattacked the aboleth and broke its control over the three companions, allowing\nthem to assail and kill the psionic creature.\nWhen Drizzt, Entreri, Dahlia, and Guenhwyvar emerged from the sewers, they confronted\nAlegni on Neverwinter’s prominent bridge. However, Alegni had been expecting\nthem since he had already learned of their presence in the city. After a\nvicious fight, Drizzt and his comrades managed to defeat Alegni and take possession\nof Charon’s Claw, and when the wounded tiefling tried to escape through a shadow\ngate, he was tackled by Guenhwyvar. They both traveled through the gate to the\nShadowfell, where Guenhwyvar was magically imprisoned by Draygo Quick, a\nNetherese warlock and lord. \nThe citizens of Neverwinter viewed Alegni’s defeat as an ideal opportunity\nto revolt against the Shadovar forces occupying the city, and they immediately\nattacked the Netherese. Ambergris and Glorfathel, a Shadovar Elf Wizard of\nCavus Dun who served Draygo and was one of the leaders of the Netherese troops\nin Neverwinter, quickly realized that Alegni’s soldiers were outmatched by their\nopposition. Glorfathel decided that the battle was lost and retreated to the Shadowfell\nwith the surviving Netherese troops. Ambergris remained in Neverwinter and met\nwith Drizzt and his companions, offering to heal their wounds. The dwarf also\ntold Drizzt to speak with Arunika, who informed him that Guenhwyvar was no\nlonger connected to the onyx figurine that summoned her. Alegni was healed in\nthe Shadowfell by Shadovar priests, and Draygo ordered him to retrieve Charon’s\nClaw, making it clear that failure was not an option.\nShortly after the battle in Neverwinter, Drizzt, Dahlia, and Entreri decided\nto travel to Gauntlgrym, since the primordial was their best chance to destroy\nCharon’s Claw. The trio was attacked by a group of Shadovar while they were\njourneying to the ancient dwarven complex, but they defeated them. When the companions\nentered the tunnels that led to Gauntlgrym, the Shifter approached Drizzt and\noffered to give him back Guenhwyvar in exchange for Charon’s Claw, but the\nranger refused, earning him Entreri’s trust.\nAlegni and a Shadovar band that included Effron, Glorfathel, Ambergris, and\nAfafrenfere teleported into Gauntlgrym and intercepted Drizzt and his\ncompanions as they entered the city. A fight ensued, but it was interrupted as both\ngroups were attacked by the Xorlarrin force. Drizzt and his comrades were captured\nby the Xorlarrins, but Entreri was able to convince the dark elves that they were\nagents of the drow mercenary company known as Bregan Daerthe. The\nXorlarrins and Tiago decided to release them, and the entire drow expedition,\nexcept for Brachthal, who had allied with the primordial and gained control of\na lava elemental, retreated to the lower levels of Gauntlgrym to avoid the\nfight that would inevitably resume between the three companions and the\nShadovar. The drow’s withdrawal interrupted Golfanin’s ongoing work on a\nmagical Sword and Shield for Tiago.\nAfter their brief clash against the drow, Alegni and his forces made their\nway to the primordial chamber and prepared to confront Drizzt, Entreri, and\nDahlia. Meanwhile, the trio traveled through Gauntlgrym and encountered\nBrachthal and his lava elemental. The group managed to kill Brachthal and\ndestroy the elemental, and they then moved to engage Alegni and the Shadovar. While\nthe three companions fought the tiefling warlord and the Netherese soldiers,\nAmbergris betrayed her comrades by throwing Glorfathel into the primordial pit,\nstunning Afafrenfere with magic, and assailing Effron. When he realized that\ndefeat was inevitable, Alegni told Effron to retreat to the Shadowfell and was\nabout to do so himself when Drizzt used Charon’s Claw to show the Shadovar warlord\na vision of the sword being thrown into the primordial pit, begging for him to\nsave it. This distraction provided an opening for Dahlia to launch an attack on\nAlegni that killed him.\nWhile Dahlia continued to brutalize the body of Alegni, Effron called out in\nanguish to his dead father, revealing that he was the son of the Netherese\nwarlord and Dahlia, who had been raped and impregnated by Alegni decades\nearlier. Dahlia had attempted to kill her child shortly after he was born by\nthrowing him from a cliff, but Effron’s revelation showed that he had survived\nand had developed a hatred for his elf mother. Before Dahlia or the others could\nact, Effron used his abilities as a Shadovar to escape to the Shadowfell. With\nnothing left stopping the group, Drizzt threw Charon’s Claw into the primordial\npit, expecting that this action would kill Entreri as well. The sword was\ndestroyed, but Entreri lived, for reasons that none of his companions\nunderstood.\nIn the Shadowfell, Effron immediately began to plot his revenge on Dahlia,\nwith Draygo’s consent. Afafrenfere attempted to attack Drizzt, but Ambergris\nstopped him and then placed an enchantment on him so that he could not ever assail\nthe drow ranger. Even though Ambergris soon revealed that the spell was not\nreal, her assistance had earned her Drizzt’s trust, and the group then left\nGauntlgrym together. Ascertaining that all the opposition had left Gauntlgrym, Tiago\nurged Golfanin to return to the forge and complete his work on the magical sword\nand shield.\nA short time later, in the throne room of Gauntlgrym, the dead dwarf battlerager Thibbledorf Pwent returned to life as a Vampire. Meanwhile,\nInvidoo’s replacement imp revealed himself to be Druzil, a servant of Errtu, a Balor whom\nDrizzt had defeated twice in the course of his adventures. Errtu’s one hundred\nyears of banishment from the Prime Material plane were almost over and he was\nplotting his vengeance on Drizzt. In the forge room of Gauntlgrym, Golfanin revealed\nto Tiago that the drow who he thought was an agent of Bregen Daerthe was\nactually Drizzt DoUrden. The weaponsmith explained that the sword and shield\nthat he was forging would give Tiago the power to become the weapons master of\nHouse Baenre, but the head of Drizzt would make him a legend in Menzoberranzan.\nthumb|A map of Neverwinter circa 1463 DR.\n*Drizzt DoUrden\n*Dahlia Sinfelle\n*Artemis Entreri\n*Ambergris, dwarf of Cavus Dun\n*Afafrenfere, human monk of Cavus Dun\n*Berellip Xorlarrin, drow priestess\n*Brackthal Xorlarrin, drow wizard\n*Effron, tiefling warlock\n*Guenhwyvar, summoned panther\n*Herzgo Alegni, tiefling lord\n*Jearth Xorlarrin, drow weaponsmaster\n*Ravel Xorlarrin, drow wizard\n*Tiago Baenre, drow fighter\n*Saribel Xorlarrin, drow priestess\n*Alfwin, Shadovar sorceror\n*Andzrel Baenre, drow weaponsmaster\n*Anthus, human cleric\n*Arunika, succubus\n*Bol, tiefling member of Cavus Dun\n*Byok, Tiagos riding lizard\n*Draygo Quick, Netherese lord\n*Druzil, imp\n*Genevieve, former slave of aboleth\n*Glorfathel, elven member of Cavus Dun\n*Golfanin, drow weaponsmith\n*Gromph Baenre, Archmage of Menzoberranzan\n*Horrible, human member of Cavus Dun\n*Jelvus Grinch, captain in Neverwinter\n*Jermander, tiefling member of Cavus Dun\n*Invidoo, imp\n*Parbid, tiefling monk of Cavus Dun\n*Parise Ulfbinder, Netherese lord\n*Ratsis, human member of Cavus Dun\n*Shifter, member of Cavus Dun\n*Sovereignty Ambassador, aboleth\n*Sylora Salm, Thayan\n*Tutugnik, bugbear king\n*Thibbledorf Pwent, dwarven battlerager\n*Valindra Shadowmantle, lich\n*Yerrininae, drider\n*Zeerith QXorlarrin, drow matron mother\n*Zingrawf Bourdadine, Shadovar\n*Akar Kessell\n*Athrogate\n*Bruenor Battlehammer \n*Catti-brie \n*Dantrag Baenre\n*Errtu\n*Gositek\n*Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin \n*Jarlaxle \n*Kimmuriel Oblodra\n*Nojheim\n*Quenthel Baenre \n*Regis \n*Szass Tam \n*Wulfgar\n*Yinochek\n*Yvonnel Baenre\n*Neverwinter\n*Neverwinter Wood\n*Gauntlgrym\n*Shadowfell\n*Menzoberranzan (minor)\n* Aboleth\n* Bugbear\n* Dire corby\n* Drider\n* Fire elemental\n* Ghost\n* Goblin\n* Imp\n* Kobold\n* Lava elemental\n* Orc\n* Primordial\n* Riding lizard\n* Snake\n* Vampire\n* Water elemental\n* Zombie\n*Charons Claw (\"Claw\")\n*Dread Ring\n*Icingdeath\n*Kozahs Needle\n*Orbbcress\n*Twinkle\n*Vidrinath"
