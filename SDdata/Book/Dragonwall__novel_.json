Powerful as they are, the Shou Lung army's only hope lies with [[Batu Min Ho]], a young general who is himself a third generation descendant of [[Tuigan]] barbarians.  But Batu's wife must fight her own battle in the treacherous political terrain of the imperial court, as a spy attempts to undermine the emperor's confidence in her husband.  And if Batu is to retain his command and save Shou Lung, it is a battle she must not lose.''}}",
        "Summary": "[[Batu Min Ho]], a general in [[Shou Lung|Shou Lung's]] military, survives a crushing defeat at the hands of the [[Tuigan]] overseen by [[Kwan Chan Sen]], Minister of War. Kwan develops a grudge against Batu. It’s revealed that Kwan and [[Ju-Hai Chou]], the Minister of State, cooperated to try to assassinate [[Yamun Khahan]] without the Emperor’s knowledge, starting the war. \n\nBatu is placed in charge of Shou Lung’s army by the emperor. He plans to lure the army to attack a city, then sneak a larger force behind the Tuigan and surround and annihilate them. Meanwhile, his wife, Wu, investigates reports of a spy in the Imperial court and discovers that [[Ting Mei Wan]], the Minister of State security, is the spy. In response, Ting kills Wu and her children. \n\nBatu’s plan is partially successful, and he traps the Tuigan inside a city, where they discover proof of the ministers behind the assassination attempt. Yamun Kahan offers peace if the Emperor send the two ministers, and the Emperor agrees, also executing Ting Mei Wan for her treachery. The Emperor offers Batu any of the positions of the three executed ministers, but Batu refuses to forgive the Emperor for allowing his children to be harmed, and defects to join the Tuigan. The Tuigan travel west and find [[Thay]], striking a deal with [[Szass Tam]] to pass through and invade [[Rashemen]] instead.",
