For the blinding truths inscribed within offer nothing but redemption or destruction for the wicked. May these consecrated pages forever illuminate the paths of the righteous.''\n\n:''- [[Raziel]] the Crusader, ruler of the Platinum Heaven\n\nAs the [[Book of Vile Darkness (sourcebook)|''Book of Vile Darkness'']] was a resource book on the most evil elements of campaign play, the ''Book of Exalted Deeds'' focuses instead on the availability of good resources and features in the D&D spectrum.\nIncluded are new exalted feats, prestige classes, races, spells, magic items, and descriptions and statistics for a host of creatures and celestial paragons to ally with virtuous characters. ''The Book of Exalted Deeds'' also provides descriptions and statistics for a host of creatures and [[celestial paragon]]s to ally with virtuous characters.}}",
