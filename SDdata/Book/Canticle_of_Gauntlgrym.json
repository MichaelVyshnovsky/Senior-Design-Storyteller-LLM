        "mainbody": "The '''''Canticle of Gauntlgrym''''' was a song passed down among the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[the North]] in the generations prior to the reclamation of [[Gauntlgrym]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], after which it served as an anthem of that city.\n\n{{quote|[[Silver]] halls and [[mithral]] doors<br />Stone walls to seal the cavern<br />Grander sights than e'er before<br />In smithy, mine, and tavern<br /><br />Toil hard in endless night<br />In toast, oh, lift yer [[flagon]]!<br />Ye'll need the drink to keep ye right<br />At forge that bakes the [[dragon]].<br /><br />Come [[Delzoun]], come one and all!<br />Rush to grab yer kin<br />And tell 'em that their home awaits<br />In grandest Gauntlgrym!|From the ''Canticle of Gauntlgrym''}}",
        "History": "The ''Canticle'' was believed to have been composed in Gauntlgrym shortly after its original founding. For centuries after the city's fall, it was said that every dwarf in the North knew the song, and it held special significance for those who traced their lineage to Delzoun.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, this ancient song could often be heard among dwarves traveling to Gauntlgrym to make a new life there."
