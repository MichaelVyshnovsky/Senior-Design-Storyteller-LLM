{{Quote|'''''The War Will Be Lost. All My Sacrifices Will Be For Nothing.'''''

''[[Faer√ªn]] is a land scarred by war, and peopled by the battle-tested and the war-weary.''

''"War claims lives," he said, as if personally insulted by the knowledge he was imparting, "and we sit here in the heart of bloody war, with armies on the march all around us. If one turns this way, we can muster barely enough blades to offer them a few breaths of entertainment ere we die."''

''Here are a dozen tales from millennia of war that helped define the [[Forgotten Realms]] world.''

''The grand halls and ornate dining rooms had been left as they were before the goblin army had reached the gates. It felt odd, seeing the tables set for dinner and the tapestries neatly hanging on the walls, while outside a war raged.''}}
