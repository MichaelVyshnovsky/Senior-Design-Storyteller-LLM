        "Description": "''The Ruins of Undermountain'' describes [[Undermountain]], the infamous ''über''-dungeon of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. It is the first in what became a series of supplements about Undermountain.\n\nThe set comprises several components designed to enrich the dungeon-delving experience in Undermountain. Included are a 128-page booklet titled ''Campaign Guide to Undermountain'', a 32-page booklet titled ''Undermountain Adventures'', eight double-sided loose-leaf pages featuring monster statistics, eight double-sided heavy-stock cards serving as \"adventure aids,\" and four color fold-out poster maps.\n\nThe ''Campaign Guide to Undermountain'' provides exhaustive details about the dungeon's history, its notorious non-player characters such as [[Halaster Blackcloak]], and the [[spell]]s and magic items to be discovered therein. It also offers comprehensive mapping keys to various locations within Undermountain and guidelines for expanding the dungeon and crafting future adventures.\n\nThe ''Undermountain Adventures'' booklet outlines seven distinct adventures tailored for the Undermountain setting but adaptable to other dungeons. Additionally, it includes a ''Monster Guide'' with stat blocks and descriptions of monsters unique to this set and details about the subterranean city of [[Skullport]]. The booklet's cover features art by [[Jeff Easley]], with interior cartography by [[David Sutherland]].\n\nThe monster sheets in the set detail eleven creatures in the Monstrous Compendium style.\n\nThe adventure aid cards are designed to assist the Dungeon Master by providing detailed information on traps, encounters, treasure, and other elements that can be integrated into ongoing adventures.\n\nThe included maps meticulously detail the first three levels of the Undermountain ruins, with the third level being so extensive that it occupies two of the poster maps.",
