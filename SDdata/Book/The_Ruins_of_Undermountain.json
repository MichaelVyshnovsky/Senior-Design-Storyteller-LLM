        "mainbody": "The Ruins of Undermountain is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set for the Forgotten Realms.\nThe Ruins of Undermountain describes Undermountain, the infamous über-dungeon of the Forgotten Realms. It is the first in what became a series of supplements about Undermountain.\nThe set comprises several components designed to enrich the dungeon-delving experience in Undermountain. Included are a 128-page booklet titled Campaign Guide to Undermountain, a 32-page booklet titled Undermountain Adventures, eight double-sided loose-leaf pages featuring monster statistics, eight double-sided heavy-stock cards serving as \"adventure aids,\" and four color fold-out poster maps.\nThe Campaign Guide to Undermountain provides exhaustive details about the dungeons history, its notorious non-player characters such as Halaster Blackcloak, and the spells and magic items to be discovered therein. It also offers comprehensive mapping keys to various locations within Undermountain and guidelines for expanding the dungeon and crafting future adventures.\nThe Undermountain Adventures booklet outlines seven distinct adventures tailored for the Undermountain setting but adaptable to other dungeons. Additionally, it includes a Monster Guide with stat blocks and descriptions of monsters unique to this set and details about the subterranean city of Skullport. The booklets cover features art by Jeff Easley, with interior cartography by David Sutherland.\nThe monster sheets in the set detail eleven creatures in the Monstrous Compendium style.\nThe adventure aid cards are designed to assist the Dungeon Master by providing detailed information on traps, encounters, treasure, and other elements that can be integrated into ongoing adventures.\nThe included maps meticulously detail the first three levels of the Undermountain ruins, with the third level being so extensive that it occupies two of the poster maps.\nCampaign Guide to Undermountain\n* Introduction\n* The Known History of Undermountain\n* The City Above\n* The Yawning Portal\n* Ways In and Out\n* Gates of Undermountain\n* Rumors of Undermountain\n* General Notes on Undermountain\n* Undermountain Level One\n* Undermountain Level Two\n* Undermountain Level Three\n* NPCs of Undermountain\n* Relevant NPCs of Waterdeep\n* Magic Items of Undermountain\n* Spells In Undermountain\n* How to Expand Undermountain\nUndermountain Adventures\n* Starters\n* Frying Pan & Fires\n* Down in the Dungeon\n* Adventure Hooks\n* Monster Guide\n* Skullport\n* The Rat Hills\n* Maps & Charts of Undermountain\n* In this short adventure, a group of high-level adventurers find themselves kidnapped off the streets of Waterdeep by members of Xanathars Thieves Guild and taken down to the Sargauth Level of Undermountain.\n* In this short adventure, adventurers find themselves gated away from Undermountain and out to the High Moor, close to Ithkyxans Lair.\n* In this short adventure, adventurers find themselves gated away from Undermountain and out to the central forest of Cormyr, where deadly plants and tendrils await.\n* In this short adventure, adventurers have an encounter with a notorious thief.\nbaneguard • bat • brown mold • bugbear • carrion crawler • chimera • clay golem • crawling claw • drow • dung snake • ettercap • gargoyle • ghast • ghoul • giant centipede • giant weasel • giant gar • giant spider • gnoll • goblin • grell • guardian skeleton • helmed horror • hobgoblin • kobold • leucrotta • lurker above • mimic • necrophidius • neo-otyugh • ochre jelly • orc •  • rat • roper • rot grub • salamander • snake • spectre • spider, flying • stirge • stone golem • tentamort • trapper • vampyre • water weird • wereboar • wyvern\nItems blast scepter • bracers of defense • brooch of shielding • glim-gauntlet • greenstone amulet • horned ring • iron bands of Bilarro • medallion of ESP • ring of fire resistance • ring of mind shielding • ring of protection • ring of the ram • ring of regeneration • ring of spell turning • rod of absorption • stun sphere • vorpal • wand of paralyzation • whip of withering\nFood & Drink \nPlants scuud\nProfessions moneylending\nThe Ruins of Undermountain Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nCampaign Guide to Undermountain Cover.jpg|Campaign Guide to Undermountain Cover\nUndermountain Adventures Cover.jpg|Undermountain Adventures Cover\nCampaign Guide to Undermountain\n* Design Ed Greenwood\n* Editing Steven E.
