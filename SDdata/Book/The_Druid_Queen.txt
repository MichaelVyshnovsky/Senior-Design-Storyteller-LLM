The Druid Queen, by Douglas Niles, is the third book in the Druidhome trilogy.
Talos turns Deirdre Kendrick into his avatar. When the High Imperceptor of Helm gets hired to heal Tristan Kendrick’s arm, Helm and Talos form an alliance to attempt to force the Moonshae Isles to accept other gods. They use a tribe of firbolgs to free Grond Peaksmasher, a giant demigod, to use as a weapon against the Earthmother. However, Robyn Kendrick becomes avatar for the Earthmother and convinces Grond to turn against the other gods. Alicia Kendrick kills Deirdre and Brigit falls in the battle. Robyn abdicates as queen to better serve as Great Druid, and Tristan abdicates to be with her, leaving Alicia as queen. She declares her love for Keane.
