==Summary==
[[Talos]] turns [[Deirdre Kendrick]] into his avatar. When the High Imperceptor of [[Helm]] gets hired to heal [[Tristan Kendrick]]’s arm, Helm and Talos form an alliance to attempt to force the [[Moonshae Isles]] to accept other gods. They use a tribe of [[Firbolg|firbolgs]] to free [[Grond Peaksmasher]], a giant demigod, to use as a weapon against the [[Earthmother]]. However, [[Robyn Kendrick]] becomes avatar for the Earthmother and convinces Grond to turn against the other gods. Alicia Kendrick kills Deirdre and [[Brigit]] falls in the battle. Robyn abdicates as queen to better serve as Great Druid, and Tristan abdicates to be with her, leaving Alicia as queen. She declares her love for [[Keane]].
