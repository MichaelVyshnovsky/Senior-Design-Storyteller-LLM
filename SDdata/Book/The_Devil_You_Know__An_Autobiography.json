        "mainbody": "The Devil You Know An Autobiography was a book written by a tiefling, about the nature of tieflings following their forced transformation to Asmodean lineage.\nThe thin tome had a notable, mustard-yellow cover.\nThe Devil You Know outlined the existence of tieflings and how they were viewed by others in the Realms, as seen by the author. It pointed out hypocrisies of Faerûnian culture how \"devilkin\" were wholly evil by nature of their birth yet warlocks who actively made pacts with fiends were so often less-vilified. The author shared their personal enmity for the Toril Thirteen ― the group of warlocks whose actions allowed Asmodeus to claim all of Torilian tieflings as his own ― along with the futility of harboring that hatred.\nThe author wrote that, while most folks of the Realms believed tieflings to be unscrupulous and immoral, it was Asmodeus true wish their kind would make those beliefs true in action. It was that reason that drove the author to keep true to their moral compass and not give in to a life of crime or debauchery.\n* Zevlor, a former officer of the Hellriders of Elturel."
