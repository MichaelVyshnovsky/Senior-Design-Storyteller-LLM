        "mainbody": "'''''Runes Made Easy''''' was a text [[book]] penned by the Scribes of [[Candlekeep]] sometime before [[1357 DR]].",
        "Contents": "''Runes Made Easy'' was a collection of lore that could help readers identify and decipher the origins of various glyphs, sigils, and runes. Among the glyphs that were detailed in the tome were the runes of the [[Fire Knives]], an assisting guild from [[Cormyr]], the rune of the [[Survivors of Moander]], a remnant cult dedicated to the god of rot, and the [[arcane mark]] of [[Dracandros]] of [[Thay]], among many others.",
        "History": "''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|1357}}, a copy of ''Runes Made Easy'' belonged to [[Filani]], Sage of [[Tilverton]]. Her copy was identifiable by the sage's name written on the inner cover of the tome. At some point before 1357 [[DR]], Filani's book was stolen and found its way into the library of [[Artur Grossman]], the Guildmaster of the [[Rogues of Tilverton]]. The book stood out among other tomes in his possession as it was neither a book of bad poetry nor a history book. Artur used ''Runes Made Easy'' to research the ''[[azure bonds]]'' on the forearms of a group of adventurers that became entangled in the Tiverton guild war plot."
