        "mainbody": "'''''The Folly of Zerthimon''''' was a [[githyanki stone disc]] that detailed the split between [[githyanki]] and [[githzerai]], written in both [[Gith language]] and in the [[Common tongue]], written long before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''After Mother Gith freed us from our illithid bonds, Mother Gith traversed the planes, discovering civilizations thriving among the stars. She conquered, she colonised, she controlled. And all the while, Zerthimon questioned.''|Excerpt from ''The Folly of Zerthimon.''}}",
        "Content": "The stone disc was carved with Githyanki runes originally, with the translation in Common scribed on it at a later date. The disk told the story of the Mother Gith, the original [[Vlaakith I|Vlaakith]], and the [[gith]] people's fate after the fall of the [[Illithid Empire]]. When gith were freed, Vlaakith I traversed the planes and discovered other peoples prospering in other worlds. As she focused on spreading the gith people, [[Zerthimon]] began questioning his own race's nature, arguing for them to be reborn in their newfound freedom. Zerthimon taught his followers that Vlaakith I, building her new empire, made gith the same as their old masters. This belief was held to be blasphemous and traitorous, sparking the great [[War of the One Sky]].\n\nAccording to the disk, Zerthimon's inevitable defeat came in the [[Blasted Plains]], banishing Zerthimon and his followers to the plane of [[Limbo]]. There, githzerai remained, as ''The Folly of Zerthimon'' claimed, \"languishing in the lethargy they craved, free of inner fire, free of purpose.\" The new people called themselves githzerai, while githyanki called them ''hshar'laki'', which meant \"unforgivable.\"",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one disk containing ''The Folly of Zerthimon'' could be found in [[Crèche Y'llek]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] on [[Toril]]."
