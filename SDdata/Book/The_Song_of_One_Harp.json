Its throne, some say. The one who sits upon it, others affirm, trying to appear more wise. Nay, still others say, it is the one who stands, whispering, behind it.\n\nNone of these, I tell you. No temple or castle, no sacred grove or mountain height holds the heart of a land of [[Faer√ªn]]. If you seek such a thing, you will find it in the eyes and toil-scarred hands of the farmers and yeomen who work the land, who answer the commands of priest and king, who help those in need, and who raise club, spade, or handy rock to defend their own.\n\nGo then, and find hearts. When you have done that, you can begin the truly difficult task: finding truths in any heart you have found.\n\nSearch well; a lifetime is scarce time enough to find a handful of truth.|Storm Silverhand, ''The Song of One Harp''}}",
        "Contents": "In it, Storm mused on the nature of life and society in the Realms. Her words, \"a lifetime is scarce time enough to find a handful of truth,\" was a common saying of the Realms. [[Elminster]] and [[Ed of the Greenwood]] used this passage as a starting point for discussing life in the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]].",
        "Availability": "There was a copy of the book in [[Candlekeep]] by the early 1370s [[DR]]."
