{{quote|''SCRIBE-award-winning author, Erin M. Evans, continues the riveting tale of her [[The Sundering (series)|Sundering]] character, [[Farideh]], as she becomes embroiled in a [[Forgotten Realms]]-flavored game of thrones.''  
 
''In a direct follow-up to the third book in the Sundering series,'' [[The Adversary]]'', young warlock Farideh falls into the midst of a battle for the throne of [[Cormyr]]. As the war brought on by the [[Second Sundering|Sundering]] rages across [[Faerûn]], princes and princesses, wizards and rogues scheme to capture the seat of power of the Land of the Purple Dragon—with Farideh and her allies caught squarely in the middle.''}}
