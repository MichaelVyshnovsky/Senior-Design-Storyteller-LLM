'''''The Bhaalspawn Saga''''' was a two-volume [[chapbook]] that told a fictionalized version of the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]] of [[1368 DR]]. It was published in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
''The Bhaalspawn Saga'' was a popular series of two novels printed as thin and poor-quality chapbooks. It presented a liberally embellished version of the historic events, flush with exaggerations, fabrications, and egregious flights of fancy. The novels followed the future Grand Duke [[Abdel Adrian]], beginning with his departure from the fortress of [[Candlekeep]], meeting the future [[High Harper]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] [[Jaheira]] and other enemies and allies, and ending the sinister plot of the infamous persona [[Sarevok Anchev]]. The second volume continued the story following Adbel and his allies into the nation of [[Amn]] and the city of [[Athkatla]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Jaheira, a friend and adventuring companion of Abdel's, owned copies of both volumes. The first book was filled with annotations from the High Harper and her amused, sometimes outraged comments. The second book suffered much more at Jaheira's hands. The volume's early chapters were defaced, and some were completely ripped out from the book.
