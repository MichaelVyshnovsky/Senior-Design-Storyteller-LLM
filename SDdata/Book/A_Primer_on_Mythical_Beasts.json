        "mainbody": "A Primer on Mythical Beasts was a book that focused on various creatures of legends, such as miniature giant space hamsters, published before 1492 DR.\nThe primer was a heavy book bound in a gold-trimmed cover and embossed with outlines of various fantastical creatures.\nEach chapter of the book focused on a single beast of myth and legend and their cultural origins.\nThis chapter of the book was dedicated to a strange cryptid known as a miniature giant space hamster. Legends claimed that these creatures rarely visited the Prime Material plane, and when they did, miniature giant space hamsters chose muscled male humans as their loyal steeds. Another claim talked about the wellspring of indescribable power hidden within these majestic beasts that granted their steeds magical or mundane courage. Another tale that was never confirmed claimed that miniature giant space hamsters fed on humans eyes.\nIn 1492 DR, a copy of this enlightening book was left on a granite bench in the Emerald Grove of the Western Heartlands."
