        "mainbody": "to early No date is given for Ronin Challenge, nor its companion adventure Test of the Samurai. However, it includes Kara-Turan characters from Hall of Heroes, which is dated to 1358 DR, and is set after the unfinished events detailed there. In particular, it seems at least \"about a year\" later for the Earth Spider. On the other hand, it includes characters featured in Dragonwall, which is dated to 1359/1360 DR, which clearly occurs later for them. In particular, Ting Mei Wan was recently made a minister in Ronin Challenge and has been minister for two years by the time of Dragonwall. These narrow the main events of Ronin Challenge to late 1358 DR or early 1359 DR.\nRonin Challenge is an adventure module for the 2-edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset set in Kara-Tur.
