{{Quote|Ah, youâ€™re back. Yes, I have another tale for you. This one concerns a plot to murder our very own High Lord of Loudwater. There is a saying that if you cut off the head that the body will die. And so it was that foes of Loudwater set a trap to kill Kalahar Twohands. As the bait, they used nothing less than his love for his son.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}
