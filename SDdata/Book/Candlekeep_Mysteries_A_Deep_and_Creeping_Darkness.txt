"A Deep and Creeping Darkness" is a short adventure module for 4&ndashlevel players, collected in the anthology Candlekeep Mysteries, where players explore a seemingly abandoned village inhabited by meenlocks.
In 1492 DR, a group of adventurers are hired by a mining and exploration group to investigate what happened to the village of Vermeillon, the site of a lucrative platinum mine. Through divination magic, the adventurers learn that the information they seek can be found in a book in Candlekeep. There, they find the tome A Deep and Creeping Darkness which describes a mining accident in Vermeillon and how many of the villagers vanished immediately after, before the town was abandoned altogether. The adventurers decide to travel to Maerin, the closest town to Vermeillon, to investigate.
