The Rebel Prince was a book about the infamous Salember Obarskyr, a part of the series of smutty romance chapbooks by Goldhallow of Cormyr, published before 1348 DR.
By 1348 DR, Goldhallows chapbooks were popular in Suzail, and more rural areas of Cormyr, especially among women. The books, including The Rebel Prince, were read by farmers wives and Purple Dragons. The book featured some titillating naughty bits. Some thought the handsome ranger Florin Falconhand to be a striking resemblance of one of the books salacious characters, Boldgrim the Outlaw, from chapter three.
