A D&D super-adventure that can be played as a mini-campaign or a series of small side adventures.

Expedition to the Demonweb Pits is a D&D super-adventure for characters of levels 9–12. It is usable as a mini-campaign on its own, as a story arc in a Dungeon Master’s regular campaign, or as a series of small side adventures with a big payoff. The structure is very flexible and eminently customizable. The adventure uses a new combat encounter format designed to make the DM’s job easier and to speed up play.

Heroes who become entangled in the adventure’s plot soon find themselves squaring off against the agents of Lolth and Graz’zt across several planes, including the Abyss.|Description from Wizards of the Coast website}}

==Description==
''Expedition to the Demonweb Pits'' is designed for 9{{th}}–12{{th}} level characters and focuses on the machinations of the demon lords [[Lolth]] and [[Graz'zt]]. The adventure was influenced by the 1{{st}}-edition adventure module, ''[[Queen of the Demonweb Pits]]''.

==Synopsis==
''Expedition to the Demonweb Pits'' revolves around the reading of the Dark Pact. The demon lord Graz'zt seeks to form an alliance with Lolth against Orcus. Lolth spurns his offer, and Graz'zt, not taking rejection lightly, now schemes to undermine Lolth. With the aid of his cambion son, Rule-of-Three, Graz'zt plans a Demon Council within the Abyss. While he is doing this, Rule-of-Three spreads word among the drow that their goddess is coming to the Prime Material Plane to wage the eternity war against their hated cousins, the surface elves and their god, Corellon Larethian. 

After the Demonic Council is arranged, Rule-of-Three and Graz'zt involve a group of mortals (the PCs) about Lolth's coming. Their goal is to bring attention to Lolth in her own Demonweb and then use the mortals to embarrass her in the eyes of the other demon lords, while at the same time, sealing the Dark Pact of planar binding using the divine spark Lolth gives it. It is the PC's goal to prevent the reading of that pact.
