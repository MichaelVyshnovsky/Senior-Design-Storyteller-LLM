        "Description": "This large tome was decorated with web emblazonry and weighted {{SI|2|lb|k|long=yes}}.",
        "Powers": "When ''Drow Spinnan Trisagion'' fell into [[priest]]ly hands, the book shared its formidable divine powers with them. Curiously enough, the book could be used by clerics of any faith, unrestricted to the worship of the evil Spider Queen. The cleric in possession of ''Drow Spinnan Trisagion'' gained impressive resistance to [[arcane]] and [[divine]] magics and had their mind was fortified against any sorcery aimed at bending one's will. The owner also gained increased awareness, allowing them to spring into battle with efficiency. Lastly, the book's user could cast ''[[restoration]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Drow Spinnan Trisagion'' was brought to the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]] by [[drow]] [[inquisitor]]s of [[House Freth]]. The drow house forged an alliance with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that lorded over the ruins and were granted control of the deep [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The inquisitors created a small shrine to Lolth and placed ''Drow Spinnan Trisagion'' inside a sacrificial [[spider]] totem. The shrine was defended by a smattering of House Freth warriors, a High Priest, an inquisitor, and two trained [[arraccat]]s. Any group of adventurers strong enough to defeat the drow party and inquisitive enough to open the totem was sure to be rewarded with the powerful clerical tome."
