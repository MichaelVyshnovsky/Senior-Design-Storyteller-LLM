        "mainbody": "Tal Tessoran, also titled as A Life Well Lived, was a popular yet scandalous book of romantic adventure fiction set in the Heartlands of the Realms.\nTal Tessoran was a masterfully written, epic tale of a dashing, handsome, and heroic swordsman who fought and wenched his way across Faer√ªn, leaving a trail of defeated monsters, thwarted evil wizards, and satisfied women. The adventures were stirring and evocative, and the romantic scenes explicit to the point of pornography. Though renowned for its sexual content, the adventures themselves were well worth reading just by themselves.\nThe book was written by Roadrante Haltivur in the 14 century DR, who then had to go into hiding after she was assailed with offers of marriage, redemption, and chastisement.\nTal Tessoran was considered too scandalous to be discussed or seen in public or polite company, at best read silently with the title covered. Regardless of its reputation, the book was extremely popular across the Realms even as most people kept it hidden under their bed pillows, thanks to the excellent quality of its adventures that many read while skipping the erotica."
