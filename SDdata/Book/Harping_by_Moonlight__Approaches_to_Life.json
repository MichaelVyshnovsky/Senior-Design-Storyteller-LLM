I find that tawdry and stupid. Evil and good are as present in our world as gravity, and though their interpretation is displaced across the garbled noise of culture, they actually remain reasonably constant.''|Excerpt from ''Harping by Moonlight''}}",
        "Contents": "''Harping by Moonlight'' was a tome of musings and observations by Elminster Aumar on various topics in relation to the nature of good and evil. Elminster stated that good and evil are not personal opinions but more like natural forces akin to gravity, evident by the fact that across ages and cultures, concepts of good and evil remained mostly constant. A [[cleric]] was nothing but a pipe through which the \"smoke\" of their deity's \"good\" flowed, and when a [[wizard]] used magics to soar above the earth, they did not break gravity. Elminster also lamented the fact that [[Toril]] was a place of godly omnipotence. In his aged state, the Sage of Shadowdale realized that one could not hold the \"smoke\" of goodliness as it simply flowed through his fingers. However, despite mortals being mere puppets pulled and pushed by good and evil, they still could tug at the stings themselves.\n\nA copy of ''Harping by Moonlight: Approaches to Life' was kept in the library-citadel of [[Candlekeep]] on the [[Sword Coast]] as of the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}} A copy was also available for sale at the [[Sorcerous Sundries]] shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}} DR."
