'''''The Companions''''' by [[R.A. Salvatore]] is the first book in [[The Sundering (series)|The Sundering]] series. This story helps to explain [[Mielikki]]'s involvement with the [[Companions of the Hall]] that has been hinted at in novels from ''[[The Ghost King]]'' to ''[[The Last Threshold]]''. It partly serves to move [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]'s story into the new era. It also, along with the other novels in the series, helps to connect the old and new campaign settings using the [[Second Sundering]] as its backdrop.

==Summary==
The book begins in [[1484 DR]] right where ''[[The Last Threshold]]'' ends, with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] mortally wounded on [[Bruenor's Climb]] on [[Kelvin's Cairn]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. This event provides the impetus for the premise of the entire novel: [[Catti-brie]], [[Regis]], [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], and [[Wulfgar]], after meeting in [[Iruladoon]], are reincarnated by the power of [[Mielikki]] in order to save Drizzt. However, the [[Companions of the Hall]] must first live through their first 21 years of life with no guarantee that they will survive or even meet Drizzt at all.

[[Catti-brie]] is reincarnated as [[Ruqiah]] in the [[Bedine]] [[Desai]] tribe of [[Netheril]]. The Netherese lords [[Draygo Quick]] and [[Parise Ulfbinder]] learn of her magical and divine powers at a young age and send men to capture her. She escapes, but is driven away into the desert, eventually being captured by [[Avelyere|Lady Avelyere]], an acquaintance of Draygo and Parise who runs a school for young sorceresses in the [[Shade Enclave]]. There Catti-brie trains in the ways of post-[[Spellplague]] magic. When Lady Avelyere uses magic to scour her mind for her true purpose, Catti-brie fakes her death and flees to the [[Silver Marches]], where she runs into the [[Harpell]]s of [[Longsaddle]] and studies with them for a time. When it appears that Lady Avelyere has discovered her whereabouts, she settles in [[Bremen]] in [[Icewind Dale]] to await the appointed time to meet her companions.

[[Bruenor Battlehammer]] is reincarnated as [[Reginald Roundshield]] in [[Citadel Felbarr]]. He grows up angry and sullen that he is forced to relive childhood and that he was denied his proper rest in [[Dwarfhome]]. Eventually, he travels to [[Mithral Hall]], where he finds that the [[Treaty of Garumn's Gorge]] has apparently been a failure and he resolves that his purpose in coming back to life was in fact to return as the thirteenth king of Mithral Hall -- meaning that Drizzt will have to survive without him. However, on a visit to [[Gauntlgrym]], he runs into his old friend, the [[dwarf]]-turned-[[vampire]] [[Thibbledorf Pwent]], which sparks his sense of loyalty to his friends. He decides to set off for Kelvin's Cairn and makes it to the reunion with his friends with only moments to spare.

[[Regis]] is reincarnated in [[Delthuntle]], [[Aglarond]], as the son of [[Eiverbreen Parrafin]], later to be known as [[Spider Parrafin|Spider]]. He is a [[halfling]] [[water genasi]] and earns a living by deep-diving for oysters. He falls in with [[Pericolo Topolino]], Grandfather of Assassins, and his daughter [[Donnola Pericolo]], with whom he falls in love. While searching for treasure in a shipwreck, he awakens the [[lich]] [[Ebonsoul]], who kills Pericolo and forces Regis to flee for his life. He travels through [[Cormyr]] to [[Boareskyr Bridge]], where he joins the [[Grinning Ponies]] halfling band. He stays with them for a time but eventually departs for [[Luskan]] (where he inadvertently leaves hints that lead [[Jarlaxle]] to learn who he truly is) on the way to [[Icewind Dale]]. He settles once again in [[Lonelywood]], where Catti-brie finds him. Together they find Drizzt on Bruenor's Climb. Catti-brie is able to use the power of Mielikki to heal Drizzt, and Bruenor and [[Wulfgar]] meet them there. The [[Companions of the Hall]] are reunited once again.

Meanwhile, Draygo Quick and Parise Ulfbinder have been monitoring events, managing to witness the Companions' reunion from afar. It is revealed that the lich Ebonsoul is still hunting Regis, and it is implied that [[Lolth]] be confronting Drizzt and his friends very soon.
