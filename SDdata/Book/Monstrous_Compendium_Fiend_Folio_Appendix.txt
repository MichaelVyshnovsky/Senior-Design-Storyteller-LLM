{{Quote|''Look to your weapons!'' Here comes a horde of the strangest creatures ever to inhabit the worlds of AD&D® game. The denizens of the original FIEND FOLIO® tome are back, updated and expanded for the AD&D 2nd edition game. Treat yourself to an in-depth look at the peculiar [[achaierai]], vicious, stilt-legged birds that roam the infernal planes - and they also hunt closer to civilization. Find out what [[xvart]]s do for fun, but don't expect them to play fair! The menagerie inside includes leaping gambados, frenzied gorbels, and other old favorites. Several brand new creatures, such as the beautiful, but haughty [[gem dragon]]s join them. Don't pass up your chance to get to know these astonishing creatures.}}
