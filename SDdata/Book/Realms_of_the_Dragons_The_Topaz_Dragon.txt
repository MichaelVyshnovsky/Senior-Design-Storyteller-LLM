'''"The Topaz Dragon"''' is a short story by [[Jess Lebow]] included in the 2004 anthology ''[[Realms of the Dragons]]''.

==Summary==
An egg is stolen from the lair of the [[topaz dragon]] [[Kraxx]]. Suspecting a nearby [[dracolich]] is the culprit, but knows that entering its lair is risky. At the same time, the ''[[Expatriate (ship)|Expatriate]]'', a ship laden with [[adventurer]]s also seeking to steal Kraxx's egg, is approaching the topaz dragon's island. Realizing their plan, Kraxx forces the adventurers into submission and bids them return her egg from the dracolich's lair.
