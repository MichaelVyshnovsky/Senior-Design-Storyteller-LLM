        "mainbody": "The Haunting of Blandras Nuin is a novella by Ed Greenwood first published in the 1999 anthology Silverfall.\nSyluné possesses Auvrarn, having been transferred into him through Alustriel’s silver fire and a fragment of stone from Syluné’s fireplace that Alustriel planted on Auvrarn. She follows him to a cabin where he meets with Meira, a priestess of Shar. Meira takes several precautions to prevent him from being tracked, including giving him a dead magic ring that prevents Syluné from reading his thoughts and emotions and disguising his appearance. She briefly disguises him as Azoun Obarskyr IV before deciding Auvrarn cannot pull off such a disguise, and instead changes his appearance to that of Blandras Nuin, a textile merchant she sacrificed to Shar. Syluné follows Auvrarn as he meets with a mysterious figure who discusses the deaths in Scornubel and tells him to be patient. Syluné observes him for months as he assumes his new identity, until after a drunken night he finally takes off his magic dead ring. Syluné appears as Alaithe, a chambermaid Auvrarn murdered, to scare him into telling all he knows of the conspiracy. She then contacts the Simbul to send her after the three Red Wizards."
