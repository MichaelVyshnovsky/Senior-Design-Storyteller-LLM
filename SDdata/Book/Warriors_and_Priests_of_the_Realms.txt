'''''Warriors and Priests of the Realms''''' is an accessory for AD&D 2nd edition.
{{quote|''[[Fighter]]s and [[cleric]]s have long been mainstays in many AD&D game campaigns. Now, take a look inside this book and discover the dozens of kits created to adapt these basic classes to the unique and popular lands of [[Faer√ªn]]. Learn what a difference your homeland makes when you choose a warrior's kit, or discover the benefits as well as disadvantages of worshiping certain gods of the Realms. Some differences among people are subtle, while others can be quite glaring. This tome reveals ways to identify whether a mercenary hails from [[Chondath]] or [[Waterdeep]]. It tells you that not all black-clad priests are evil followers of [[Cyric]], and even priests of the demipowers have skills to respect.''

''In addition to priest and warrior kits, unique PC subclasses are revealed herein: the [[Harper]], roving guardian of nature and justice, and the [[Crusader]], a militant priest able to defend the faith with steel if necessary. As sure as [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]]'s pipe glows green, the true warriors and priests of the Realms stand revealed at last!''}}
