It is therefore assumed the sourcebook is set at some point between 1361 and 1364 DR.

'''''Gold & Glory''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. 

{{quote|''The jingle of [[gold]] and the chance to earn glory in the battlefield motivate many people to answer the call to arms. These men and women are mercenaries, willing to fight someone else's battle for the chance to earn a few coins or lasting fame. ''Gold & Glory'' describes the mercenary companies of the FORGOTTEN REALMS<sup>&reg;</sup> Campaign Setting. The famous and the infamous are detailed within: the [[Flaming Fist]], possibly the most powerful private army on [[Toril]]; The [[Mindulgulph Mercenary Company]], certainly the most bizarre; the honorable [[Bushido (organization)|Bushido]], the sly [[Masquerade]], the snobbish [[Order of the Blue Boar]], the hard-fighting [[She-Wolves]], and many more. Many of the companies are brought to life in the 16 full-page full color portraits in this sourcebook. Gaming information, including statistics for BATTLESYSTEM&trade; Game scenarios, is offered as well. Player characters can adventure with these mercenary corps, earning gold and glory for themselves!''}}
