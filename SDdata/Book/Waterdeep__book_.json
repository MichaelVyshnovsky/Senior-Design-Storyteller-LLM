        "mainbody": "aterdeep was an aptly named history book of the City of Splendors, written and published before the Wailing Death crisis of 1372 DR.\nThe book opened with the City of Splendors general geographical information and listed its population to be almost one and a half million citizens with the number carrying depending on the season. The book listed its rich trade businesses and the number of races living inside the city walls. The book noted that halfling population was the most rapidly growing and was likely to become the largest demi-human race in residence.\nThe second part of the book recited Waterdeeps history starting with the citys origins - that of a trading site over two millennias before the books writing. A thousand years before the books publishing, the trading post became growing farming communities around it. The first time the city was mentioned by its name in history was around four hundred years before the books release, and the city was nothing but a group of local warlords.\nThe third chapter cited the citys establishment to happen by 1302 DR and its first Lord to be Ahghairon. By 1248 DR Waterdeep was said to develop guilds and the City of the Dead. Following that, the book recited the period of the unrest known as the Guildwars. By 1273 DR the city rulership system was established as it was known in the 14 century DR, creating the positions of the Magisters and the sector Lords of Waterdeep.\nThe final chapter of the book described the more recent period of time that showed significant growth in the citys trade and nobility with merchants establishing guilds and rising in status. The city established the City Watch to be its light-handed law enforcement. These factors made Waterdeep cosmopolitan and much more tolerant of cultures, races, and religion in contrast with other places in the Realms. The citys diversity was credited for its growth and prosperity, truly earning its nickname - the City of Splendors.\nCopies of Waterdeep book could be found around the areas of Neverwinter, Daggerford, and the Sword Coast North  circa 1372 DR."
