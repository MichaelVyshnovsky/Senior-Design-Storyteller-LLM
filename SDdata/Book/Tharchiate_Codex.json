The book held lore about necromantic books and their magic locks, as well as information on deciphering them, including information on The Necromancy of Thay. A Red Wizard \"researcher\" Ilyn Toth sought to uncover the secrets of The Necromancy of Thay and attempted to request the Necromantic Codexes, Their Enigmas tome but was denied by the High Heralds librarian who manned the Moonrise Towers library. The librarian notes stated that Necromantic Codexes was the wrong book for this pursuit and the correct tome was Tharchiate Codex."
