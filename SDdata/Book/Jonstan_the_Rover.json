Or be welcomed back?<br/>Long lasses aplenty catch his winking eye.<br/>Is it kisses he'll taste soon? Or scorn everlasting?<br/>Love and laughter and soon away Jonstan will fly –<br/>Gone again over threshold and under dawn sky.''\n\n''Far across [[Faerûn]], a rover adventures free<br/>'Til the Dales call his heart home again<br/>To Jhaele, Sharune, Aleese and Rythree –<br/>Warm arms and hearth and a roof 'gainst rain<br/>'Til his wandering feet bear him away again.''\n\n''Climbing far mountains, riding in high clover<br/>To [[Waterdeep]] and the shores of the [[Shining Sea]] –<br/>\"Hark! Comes now bold Jonstan the Rover?<br/>Will he, oh will he ever come back to me?\"<br/>The Dales call back the man wedded but free.''\n\n''Clippety-cloppety, bold Jonstan the Rover<br/>Comes riding down into the Dales again.<br/>Their forests and fields, rare beauty all over,<br/>His true love more than all the maidens in pain.<br/>My man is riding mist-eyed to the Dales again.''|An excerpt from ''Jonstan the Rover''}}"
