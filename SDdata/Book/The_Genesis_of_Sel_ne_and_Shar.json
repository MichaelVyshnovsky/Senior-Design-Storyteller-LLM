        "Content": "The book talked about the event that led to the great conflict between Selûne and Shar. When there was but only darkness in existence, Selûne ignited flame from nothingness, creating [[the sun]] in the center of what would become [[Realmspace]]. This act created the light and warmth necessary for life to form in the world.\n\nIt also brought about the ages-old conflict between the two sisters, pitting them in a struggle against each other that continued throughout all of Toril's existence.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''The Genesis of Selûne and Shar'' could be found in a secluded shrine found just outside the village of [[Moonhaven]]."
