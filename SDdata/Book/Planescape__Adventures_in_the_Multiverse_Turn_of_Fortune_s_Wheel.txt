'''''Turn of Fortune's Wheel''''' is an adventure included in the boxed set ''[[Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse]]''.

==Synopsis==
''Turn of Fortune's Wheel'' centers on the characters correcting a multiversal glitch that affects them and the entirety of the [[Outlands]]. The adventure begins with the characters awakening in [[Sigil]], disconnected from their lives and memories due to an unprecedented reality error.

As the adventure unfolds, the characters explore the city of Sigil and encounter Shemeshka, an [[arcanaloth]] information broker. In exchange for Shemeshka's assistance in recovering their memories, the characters must locate a missing [[modron]] that possesses dangerous information. This quest takes them on a journey through the Outlands, with an additional objective of documenting their observations of the plane using a [[mimir]]â€”a magical, skull-shaped recording device.

Throughout their travels, the characters uncover Shemeshka's involvement in their predicament, regain their memories, and have the opportunity to thwart a scheme that threatens the stability of the multiverse.
