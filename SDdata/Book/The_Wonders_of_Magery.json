        "Excerpt": "{{quote|''Of old, the mouths of [[Mystra]] made known to all who have Power, that by the blessing of the goddess, one mage shall be the Lady's champion, and master of magery. This one, called the Magister, does not rule, but rather wanders the realms doing as desired, for good or ill, and in time is cast down by other mages, and the mouths of Mystra shall name a new Magister. Thus [[the Art]] shall live and grow, in strife and mystery, and never know the stifling yoke of law nor of authority. And the Art shall grow stronger, for magely ambition grows with skill-in-Art, and those waxing stronger will seek out incumbent weakness; from strife-of-art shall come greater strength. In the proper choosing of an enemy, each Magister brings glory, and greater strength, to the office. And in the seeking of that office, each magic brings glory, and greater strength, to the Art.''|Excerpt from ''The Wonders of Magery''.}}"
