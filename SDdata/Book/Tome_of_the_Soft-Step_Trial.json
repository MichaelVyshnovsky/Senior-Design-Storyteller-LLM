        "Content": "The purpose of the ''Tome of the Soft-Step Trial'' was to help young initiates pass the Soft-step trial, part of the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] – a right of passage for [[Dark Justiciars]] of the Church. The tome instructed the readers on how to beat the trail using the skills known to be the most cherished among Sharrans – stealth, lockpicking, trap-disarming, and evasion. Only those who heeded the lessons of the ancient tome could hope to succeed."
