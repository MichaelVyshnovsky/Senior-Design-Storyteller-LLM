        "mainbody": "Tome of the Soft-Step Trial was a textbook used to teach Sharran initiates skills of stealth and daft hands, printed in the ancient times, long before the 15 century DR.\nThe purpose of the Tome of the Soft-Step Trial was to help young initiates pass the Soft-step trial, part of the Gauntlet of Shar – a right of passage for Dark Justiciars of the Church. The tome instructed the readers on how to beat the trail using the skills known to be the most cherished among Sharrans – stealth, lockpicking, trap-disarming, and evasion. Only those who heeded the lessons of the ancient tome could hope to succeed."
