The Ruins of Karse is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.
Otar has recovered from his coma and returned to Loudwater with an artifact formed from Karsus final breath, the coalescence of scorn. With it, he plans on foiling the plans of the evil Green King but to succeed, he needs the help of two parties of adventurers. One to help him stop the Green King and another to prevent the Green Kings minions from stopping them.
