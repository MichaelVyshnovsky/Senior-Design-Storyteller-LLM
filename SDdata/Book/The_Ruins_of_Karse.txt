'''The Ruins of Karse''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

==Plot==
[[Otar]] has recovered from his coma and returned to [[Loudwater]] with an artifact formed from [[Karsus]]' final breath, the ''coalescence of scorn''. With it, he plans on foiling the plans of the evil '''Green King''' but to succeed, he needs the help of two parties of adventurers. One to help him stop the Green King and another to prevent the Green King's minions from stopping them.

{{quote|At last, the true enemy of Loudwater was revealed to be the fallen first Green Regent. The corrupted champion of Mielikki sought to return to the Delimbiyr Vale. The key to his victory and defeat were the Heart and Mind of Karsus.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}
