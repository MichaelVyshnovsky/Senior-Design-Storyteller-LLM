        "mainbody": "The '''''Glandar's Grimoire''''' was an ancient [[spellbook]] that originated in [[Unther]]. Its remains contained four unique [[arcane]] spells.",
        "Description": "As of [[1367 DR]] all that remained of the grimoire was a charred husk containing five pages. It was unknown what the tome appeared like before being burned. The surviving front of the book was covered in the [[dragonhide|hide]] of a [[black dragon]]. The hide was stretched over a piece of [[slate]] and stitched with [[wire]] that also held the remaining pages. The back cover of the book, as well as any additional pages, were lost to the flames.\n\nThe recovered damaged grimoire was stored and preserved in an octagonal [[coffer]] artistically carved from [[ivory]]. The coffer's hinges and clasps were made from [[electrum]].\n\nThe first page of the grimoire bore the inscription: ''\"The Grimoire Most Perilous of The Immortal Glandar, Lord of the Undying, Scepter of Glandara.\"''",
        "Powers": "The ''Glandar's Grimoire'' contained the following spells:\n:''[[Disruption]]'' &bull; ''[[Fellblade]]'' &bull; ''[[Immunity to undeath]]'' &bull; ''[[Melisander's harp]]''"
