'''''The Scroll of Her Glory''''' was an instructional missive penned for the followers of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] as their "deity's" dogma, published in or shortly before [[1492 DR]].

==Content==
The scroll prepared those who were granted an audience with [[the Absolute]]. It claimed that those who stood before the "deity" were her most special devotees. It promised that all that was known by the follower was to be shared and made known to the Absolute, and the worshippers were to give themselves to her fully. The Absolute was said to embed a shard of her perfection in the devotee's mind, in reality, a [[mindflayer]] tadpole. The ceremony produced the [[True Soul]]s of the Absolute.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Scroll of Her Glory'', encased in a decorative scroll case, was held atop the [[Moonrise Towers]] and ready for the Absolutists who were chosen to become the True Souls.
