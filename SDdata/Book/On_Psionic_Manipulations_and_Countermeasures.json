        "mainbody": "'''''On Psionic Manipulations and Countermeasures''''' was a [[book]] on the topic of [[illithid]] [[psionics]] published in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Contents": "The tome described all known methods of protecting one's mind from mind flayer domination in thorough detail. The book stated that illithids were fearsome and tactical opponents who studied their enemies and victims, assessing their strengths and weaknesses. Manipulation and targeting their enemies' close ones was a common strategy. The author suggested that the best countermeasure was to avoid illithids altogether. If no other option was available, the book advised the reader to refrain from trying to outsmart mind flayers as it was sure to fail. The reader had to pay attention to mind flayers' actions and not words. Words could be honeyed with lies and manipulation, and everyone knew that actions spoke more loudly than words. Another important defense was one's allies. Strong relationships and strong allies could offset a mind flayer's schemes. Lastly, the book warned against allying with mind flayers as the only time it was feasible was when all parties wanted the same thing, but even so, once an ally outlived their usefulness, mind flayer would not hesitate to end them.",
        "History": "Copies of ''On Psionic Manipulations and Countermeasures'' could be found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] and among the possessions of the [[gith]] who claimed [[Rosymorn Monastery]] as their ''cr√®che'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
