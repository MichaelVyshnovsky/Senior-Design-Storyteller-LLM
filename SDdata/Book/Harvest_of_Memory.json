        "mainbody": "'''''Harvest of Memory''''' was a [[book]] that collected knowledge on the topic of [[Shadar-kai]] and their mistress, the [[Raven Queen]] of the [[Shadowfell]]. It was published in or before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|That domain is life and death, and in their unwavering fealty to their mistress, the Shadar-kai perform the thankless duty of ferrying the memories of the dead for her to admire in a kind of memory-based menagerie.|An excerpt from ''Harvest of Memory''}}",
        "Contents": "''Harvest of Memory'' stated that the realm of Shadowfell was a dark, twisted, and wicked reflection of the [[Prime Material plane]], filled with sadness and despair. That was where the Raven Queen brought her [[Shadar-kai (elf)|Shadar-kai elves]]. These elves were different from the [[Fair Folk]] who inhabited the [[Sword Coast]] as the Shadar-kai themselves were a reflection of the Shadowfell in physiology and attitude. The tome described them as cruel and evil, thoroughly dedicated to the Raven Queen.",
        "History": "''Harvest of Memory'' was published sometime before the town of [[Reithwin]] of the [[Chionthar Valley]] fell, consumed by the [[Shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1373}}. A copy of the book was left behind in the twisted and evil ruins of [[Reithwin Mason's Guild]]. Another copy of the book was sold by [[Nansi Gretta]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] shop â€“ [[The Bibliophile]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
