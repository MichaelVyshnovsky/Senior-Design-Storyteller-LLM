        "mainbody": "he Tales Told to a Blind Wizard was a book penned by Halivon Tharnstar and published in 1363 DR.\nThe Tales Told to a Blind Wizard were written by Halivon Tharnstar, Avowed of Mystra. Not surprisingly, the tome dealt with beliefs of the Mystran faith and the search of true magic – the fabled One True Spell. The tome talked about the obsessive search for understanding of the Art that consumed the lives of ancient wizards. Tales claimed that some spellcasters were able to discover the One True Spell, but they were dismissed as insane. Halivon personally has met one of those \"crazed men\" and recounted the meeting in the book. The Avowed of Mystra witnessed spells not touching that man and his ability to weave magics with his mind without uttering a single word. Halivon was under the impression that the \"crazed\" man was far from it. Instead, he appeared calm, meditative, and content. Halivon Tharnstar was lucky enough to talk to the man who told the Avowed that the One True Spell was a woman – the goddess Mystra, and that \"her kisses were wonderful.\"\nThe text also included mentions of the temptations of godhood for wizards, no matter how powerful.\nA copy of the Tales Told to a Blind Wizard was kept in the library-citadel of Candlekeep in the late 14 century DR."
