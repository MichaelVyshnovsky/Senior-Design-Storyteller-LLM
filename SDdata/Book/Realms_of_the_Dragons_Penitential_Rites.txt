'''"Penitential Rites"''' is a short story by [[Keith Francis Strohm]] included in the 2004 anthology ''[[Realms of the Dragons]]''.

==Summary==
Brother [[Arranoth Fen]] of [[Ilmater]]'s [[Monastery of the White Willow]] is murdered. His friend, the [[half-dragon]] warlord-turned-monk [[Drakken Thaal]], suspects that he himself murdered Arranoth in his sleep. Drakken investigates the murder and discovers it to be a plot engineered by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] agent [[Valerix]], who sought to enrage Drakken enough to awaken the [[Rage of Dragons]] within him. The Monastery is overrun by [[orc]] and [[goblin]] marauders fleeing the depredations of the [[dragon]] [[Xargithorvar|Foilsunder]] in the nearby [[Winterwood]]. Drakken kills the cultist and succumbs to the Rage, but his faith in Ilmater keeps him from losing control of his faculties. He dies defending his fellow monks.
