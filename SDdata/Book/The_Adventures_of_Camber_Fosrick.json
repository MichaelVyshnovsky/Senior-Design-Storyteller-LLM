        "History": "A copy of ''The Adventures of Camber Fosrick'' was mistakenly left at [[Benelaius]]'s cottage in [[Ghars]] by a visiting mage. Benelaius scorned the book, saying the mage had forgotten it \"in his dotage\" because \"Why else would he have read such drivel?\" but his servant [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] loved it and became a Camber Fosrick fan in [[1367 DR]]. Jasper would attempt to replicate Camber's ball trick by throwing a piece of [[cheese]] at [[Rolf (roofer)|Rolf]] to see if he caught it in his right or left hand. The cheese instead hit him in the head and landed in his [[ale]], but Jasper got his answer when Rolf hit him with his right.",
        "Availability": "A copy of ''The Adventures of Camber Fosrick'' was kept in [[Candlekeep]] around [[1372 DR]]."
