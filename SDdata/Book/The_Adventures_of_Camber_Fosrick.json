        "mainbody": "The Adventures of Camber Fosrick, or Adventures of Camber Fosrick includes the Adventure of the Battledale Billhook, was a collection of six short stories by Lodevin Parkar of Cormyr and published in the midâ€“14 century DR. They featured the popular detective character Camber Fosrick. It had one volume.\nThe book was bound in cheap felt and was rather thin.\nOne story was \"The Adventure of the Battledale Billhook\", involving a billhook and Battledale. In it, to prove a man was a murderer, Fosrick suddenly threw a ball at him, which he caught in his allegedly unusable left hand.\nA copy of The Adventures of Camber Fosrick was mistakenly left at Benelaiuss cottage in Ghars by a visiting mage. Benelaius scorned the book, saying the mage had forgotten it \"in his dotage\" because \"Why else would he have read such drivel?\" but his servant Jasper loved it and became a Camber Fosrick fan in 1367 DR. Jasper would attempt to replicate Cambers ball trick by throwing a piece of cheese at Rolf to see if he caught it in his right or left hand. The cheese instead hit him in the head and landed in his ale, but Jasper got his answer when Rolf hit him with his right.\nA copy of The Adventures of Camber Fosrick was kept in Candlekeep around 1372 DR."
