        "mainbody": "Zikrans Zephyrean Tome was a mysterious book by Zikran, a water genasi wizard and expert on the Inner Planes. It was held in Candlekeep in the late 15 century DR.\nAdventurers seeking shelter from a storm that was apparently following them everywhere gave Zikrans Zephyrean Tome to Candlekeep. Despite being unable to open the book, a junior member of the Avowed classified it as a dissertation on the Inner Planes based only on Zikrans standing as an authority in the field. Thereafter, the book migrated through the archives as each Avowed, finding they were simply unable to unlock it, could only guess as to what it was about. They eventually gave up trying.\nIt was a hefty tome with white marble covers that were bound in light-blue leather. The book was sealed with a big padlock that could not be unlocked with magic and only opened on its own accord when the person carrying it decided to take it out of Candlekeep. The pages were white paper that were as thin as tissue they numbered 108 and were mostly blank. Each time a page was turned, a gentle breeze was released.\nThe entity trapped inside the book, a djinni by the name of Gazre-Azam, was made clear when the book was first opened.\nZikran had attempted to trap a djinni in the book multiple times before being successful, as evidenced by the various notes he made in the books first ten pages. The eight pages that followed were observations of Gazre Azams actions while under Zikrans control."
