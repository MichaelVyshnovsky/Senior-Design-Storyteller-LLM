The line of the High Warden runs unbroken down to his seventeen-year-old granddaughter, [[Hweilan]]. It is a place of peace in the wilderness.''\n\n''But one among Highwatch isn't at peace. [[Guric]], the foster son of the High Warden, makes a pact with an ancient, evil spirit to resurrect his wife. The price: his family's blood. Highwatch falls in less than a day. The line of the High Warden is broken. Only Hweilan escapes, her father's unstrung bow in hand and her heart full of vengeance.''\n\n''Vengeance enough to drive Hweilan to make her own pact with an ancient spirit: [[Nendawen]], the Master of the Hunt, [[primal spirit]] of the shapechanging [[Vil Adanrath]].''}}",
