'''''Darnarest's Guide to Enchanting Blades''''' was a non-magical book that detailed the process of enchanting weapons in precious detail written by a moderately famous [[wizard]], [[Darnarest]], sometime before his death in [[1303 DR]].

==Description==
The ''Darnarest's Guide'' was described to be approximately a {{SIAdj|1|foot|c|long=yes}} square and {{SI|3|inch|c|long=yes}} thick. The ''Guide'' was bound in steel plates and sported a [[gold]] inlay on its cover.

==History==
''Darnarest's Guide to Enchanting Blades'' was written by a wizard and a bladesmith who lived and worked out of his tower before his death in 1303 DR. He died by the maw of a vengeful and petty [[red dragon]] named [[Kezzanamark]], who later destroyed and melted the wizard's tower searching for booty.

The ''Guide'' itself was locked in the secret room in the [[Darnarest's tower|tower's]] second sub-basement level along with other items of value that belonged to Darnarest. The room and the ''Guide to Enchanting Blades'' remained were undiscovered until [[1369 DR]].

==Contents== 
''Darnarest's Guide to Enchanting Blades'' was not a magical book and its value came from knowledge, recipes, and procedures that Darnarest used to create his enchanted arms. The book was valued at around 4,000 [[gp]] to a wizard, historian, scholar, or enchanter. One of the schematics listed in the book was the ''[[defender]]'' enchantment.
