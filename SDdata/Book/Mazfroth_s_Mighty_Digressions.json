        "mainbody": "'''''Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions''''' was a collection of rambling essays by [[Mazfroth Gethur]] on a wide variety of scholarly topics.",
        "Description": "The book's cover was elegantly decorated with the title and Mazfroth's name in black ink. Far less care was afforded the actual contents of the book, however: most of the pages were hastily scribbled in the author's own handwriting, and his penmanship left much to be desired. ''Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions'' contained 151 pages, though several of these did not match, indicating that Mazfroth kept adding pages to the volume over time. The tome was {{SI|9|in|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|7|in|long=yes}} wide, and was rather poorly bound, lending ''Digressions'' a haphazard and worn appearance.\n\nThe essays contained within ''Digressions'' had no particular unifying theme, save for their apparent interest to the author:\n* One essay discussed the nature of the [[Weave]].\n* Another essay covered various forms of [[lycanthrope]]s.\n* One of the chapters was devoted to listing various [[demon lord]]s and tying the origins of several creatures to them.",
        "History": "''Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions'' was acquired by [[Amberdune Books]], a book stall in [[Baldur's Gate]] which was secretly run by a pack of [[jackalwere]]s. The [[Amberdune Pack]] had recently lost their leader, [[Nidalia]], and sought to raise the funds to pay for a ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' [[spell]]. The jackalweres had learned a ritual to create [[gingwatzim]]s, shapechanging [[aberration]]s that could assume the forms of inanimate objects. They used this knowledge to create gingwatzim copies of their more valuable tomes, including ''Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions''.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] scholar [[Yalerion Highscroll]] purchased a gingwatzim copy of ''Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions'', intending to use the book to pay for passage into the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]]. Yalerion's book was accepted by the [[Avowed]], but before long the gingwatzim, requiring life energy for sustenance, began attacking other visitors to Candlekeep."
