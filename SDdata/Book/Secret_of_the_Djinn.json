        "mainbody": "Secret of the Djinn is a gamebook in the Endless Quest series that focused on the Al-Qadim setting.\nJamil, a humble seventeen-year-old pearl diver from Jumlat, the City of Multitudes, was one of the better young divers working for Essaf the Hungry. One day, Jamil, his friend Ubar, and their fellow pearl divers were taken to a new, deeper diving spot in search of rare pink and black pearls. Upon his second descent, Jamil noticed a strange glitter in the water. Thinking it was the infamous sea beast thats been killing sails outside of Gana, Jamil took out his knife. One stab and he could be famous, rich, killing the beast. To his disappointment, the glinting came from an old shipwreck it was a magic bottle. Running out of air but taken over by curiosity, Jamil heard a female voice in his head, pleading for her freedom. As he uncorked to bottle, a beautiful green-skinned marid appeared to him and enveloped his head in an air bubble.\nHer name was Tala, and she claimed to be a queen of the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls, imprisoned sixty years prior by an aging shair who pretended to be a friend. Her bottle was buried with a ship at the bottom of the Golden Gulf, and her husband was imprisoned in a tower of Sikak, the City of Coins. Tala asked for Jamils help in freeing her beloved. She was not willing to accept \"no\" for an answer.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n • \nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  • \nMaterials\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  • \n •"
