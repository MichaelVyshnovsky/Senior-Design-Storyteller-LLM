==Summary ==
In {{yearlink|1368}}, the [[Rotting Man]], a Chosen of [[Talona]], prepares a trap which captures the light and energy of an aspect of [[Lurue]]. A small fragment escapes, however, and takes the form of a baby, which is found by the farmer [[Hemish]]. The Rotting Man eventually suspects he did not capture all of the energy.

In {{yearlink|1373}}, investigating his own diminishing connection with his goddess Lurue and an omen from her, the [[cleric]] [[Marrec]] travels to [[Fullpoint]] in [[Thesk]], joined by [[Gunggari Ulmarra]], an [[Osslander]]. There, he saves the town from rot fiends, [[blightspawned creature|blightspawned]] [[volodni]], and learns that he must seek Hemish, a farmer, who might be related to the Child of Light in his omen. After meeting Hemish, he discovers the rot fiends have taken his adopted daughter; he rescues her with the aid of a newly arrived [[Elowen]]. Together, they decide to have Ash travel with them, as she is still sought by the fiends, and consult with [[Briartan]] of the [[Mucklestones]].

Joining with [[Elowen]], they travel to Two Stars, where they are joined by [[Ususi Manaallin]] on the way to [[Briartan]]. On the way to Briartan, they ascertain he's in danger; an [[uthraki]] tricks Marrec into letting him into their camp, where Ash slays him with a mysterious power. The group finds Briartan, realizing that the druid has been caught and tortured by [[Gameliel]], a [[talontar blightlord]]. They defeat the blightlord and release Briartan, who implores before his death that they report to the [[Nentyarch]] in [[Yeshelmaar]], currently pushed out of [[Dun-Tharos]] by the Rotting Man. He renders his [[keystone]] upon Ususi.

Ususi insists they use the [[Celestial Nadir]], accessible through the Mucklestones, to travel more swiftly. The Nadir offers them a quick path, where they are only briefly attacked by a stray [[astral construct]]. In Yeshelmaar, the Nentyarch grants them gifts and tasks them with reuniting Ash, actually an aspect of [[Araluen]], with the rest of her power, captured by the Rotting Man. A turncoat elf in his service, [[Fallon]], steals away Ash and the keystsone, using the paths of the Nadir to reach the [[Arches of Xenosi]], where a second blightlord, [[Anammelech]], prepares an ambush. Ususi, Elowen, Gunggarri, and Marrec pursue quickly on their own, finding a different path in the Nadir, one that leads them into the ambush.

Marrec manages to survive the ambush thanks to his [[medusa]] heritage, which he had swore never to call upon again, but which slays Anammelech. Fallon becomes controlled by the Rotting Man, who sends his last blightlord, a [[vampire]] named [[Damanda]], to meet him; Ash breaks the control and allows Fallon to prepare an ambush for her, which slays one of her vampires. Meanwhile, the party hunting after him is pressed into service by the [[Queen Abiding]], who asks them to recover her binding talisman. They pry her talisman from a vault guarded by a fiend, [[Eschar]], which she handily defeats once freed. She agrees to perform only one more service for them, and even then, only in furtherance of her own revenge against the Rotting Man.

Damanda loses another vampire to Ash's touch, and lets Fallon live so long as he helps keep the aspect walking. The vampires hunker down in a building for the day, and lose another of their number after Fallon turns on them during a combat. However, Fallon is himself killed in the process. After one more skirmish, the group slays Damanda's last vampire, and she regroups with the Rotting Man, who waits at the center of Dun-Tharos. His forces there are massed so greatly that Marrec is forced to call upon the Queen Abiding to make his way into the Rotting Man's presence.

Once they make it to the Rotting Man, the latter sends forth Talona's Step-Daughter, a corrupted aspect of Lurue, and the greater part of Araluen. The aspect finally absorbs Ash, but Marrec manages to talk her into forgiving herself for her failure and fight off the Rotting Man's influence. Talona's Step-daughter is destroyed, and out emerges a pure, clean aspect of Lurue, which fights the Rotting Man, ultimately making him flee the forest.
