'''''Ashes of the Tyrant''''' is a novel by [[Erin M. Evans]] and the fifth book in the [[Brimstone Angels series]].

{{quote|''In a direct follow-up to her fourth book in the Brimstone Angels series,'' [[Fire in the Blood]]'', [[Erin M. Evans]] thrusts her signature character [[Farideh]] into a fast-paced murder mystery rife with political intrigue.'' 

''In the wake of the war brought on by the [[Second Sundering]], Faridehâ€™s adopted father [[Mehen]] has been called back by the clan that cast him out, and Farideh and [[Havilar]] mean to go with him. Just as Mehen confronts the head of his former clan, a clutch of young [[dragonborn]] is found in the catacombs, brutally murdered, an infernal [[summoning circle]] that looks all-too-familiar to Farideh, nearby.''}}
