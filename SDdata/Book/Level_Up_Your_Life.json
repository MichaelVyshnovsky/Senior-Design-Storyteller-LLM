        "mainbody": "'''''Level Up Your Life''''' was a self-help [[book]] that promised to teach its readers charisma, published sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Life going down the latrine? Wondering why nobody likes you? Losing out on love? Wondering what's wrong with you? The short answer is: NOTHING. You're just lacking a little charisma! It's a common misconception that charisma is something you're born with. The truth is, charisma can be learned, and by purchasing this book, you've just taken the first step on the path to becoming the best version of YOU.''|Excerpt from ''Level Up Your Life''}}",
        "History": "A copy of ''Level Up Your Life'' belonged to [[Gyldro Angleiron]], the grumpy master smith and owner of [[The Rivington General]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The book was kept in the man's home, adjacent to the Rivington General's smithy."
