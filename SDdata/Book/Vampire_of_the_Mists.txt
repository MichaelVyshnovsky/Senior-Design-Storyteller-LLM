'''''Vampire of the Mists''''' was the first [[Ravenloft]] novel by [[Christie Golden]]. The main character was [[Jander Sunstar]], an [[elven]] [[vampire]] from [[Evermeet]] who unsuspectingly enters the dark domain of [[Barovia]]. 

{{Quote|''Be careful what you wish for --- the dark powers of Ravenloft might hear you.

''[[Jander Sunstar]] is a [[gold elf]], a native of magical [[Evermeet]] in the ''Forgotten Realms''. He is also a five-hundred-year-old vampire.

''Torn by rage and grief, Jander is transported into the nightmare realm of Ravenloft, where he gains the attention of the demiplane's master, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Count Strahd Von Zarovich]]. But can Jander trust this elegant fellow vampire once he discovers that his own quest for revenge is linked to the dark heritage of the count's domain?''
