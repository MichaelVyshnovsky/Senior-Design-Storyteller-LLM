        "mainbody": "'''''Dungeoneer's Survival Guide''''' is a 1{{st}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory.\n{{Quote|''\"...In the impenetrable darkness of the underearth, unimagined terrors and uncountable treasures await.\"''\n\n''For beginners, advanced players, and DMs, this book opens up grand new vistas in the realms of the [[underdark]], that little-known region of dungeons and caverns far beneath the sunlit world of everyday existence. The worlds of subterranean adventure await!''}}",
        "Description": "''Dungeoneer's Survival Guide'' describes how to run underground adventures in great detail and includes special rules for movement, combat, mining, and skill proficiencies. The book contains a Dungeon Master's section that covers the underground environment and ecology, as well as the cultures of underground creatures. It includes information on how to make three-dimensional maps, and describes a campaign zone called \"Deepearth\".\n\nThe book includes special game rules for underground activities, combat, travel, and mining, in addition to descriptions of the [[Underdark]] and the ecology and cultures of its underground inhabitants, as well as a set of Battlesystem rules for mass-combat in underground settings.\n\nThe ''Dungeoneer's Survival Guide'' includes new proficiencies, as well as ideas for the creation of underground adventures. Characters gain proficiencies by way of \"non-weapon proficiency slots\", which can be filled with a variety of secondary skills. This book also provides rules on actions such as how well non-thieves climb walls and trees, how far characters can leap across chasms, and how long characters can hold their breath underwater.\n\nThe ''Dungeoneer's Survival Guide'' describes the types of caverns, how player characters may find and enter them, and what may be found there along with the effects of natural hazards, such as cave-ins, floods, underground streams, poisonous gases, volcanoes and lack of oxygen. The book covers the history and relationships of the underground races, and provides advice on how to run interesting underground campaigns.",
        "History": "The \"Limited Edition\" of this sourcebook was released in 1990 with identical content to the original, but was bundled with the supplement ''[[Dark and Hidden Ways]]''.",
