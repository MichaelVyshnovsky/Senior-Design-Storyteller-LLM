'''''Age of Heroes''''' is a campaign sourcebook for the 2nd-edition ruleset of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

{{Quote|''Their names were Achilles, Odysseus, Jason, Heracles, and Alexander. Their deeds pitted them against monsters, men, and the known world. They were Greeks, and theirs was the age of heroes. This supplement, Age of Heroes, transforms this epic time of myth and history into an exciting AD&D setting, with details on spells, magical items, new character kits, maps, pictures of ancient Greek life, and a starting adventure.''<br/>''The challenge has gone out - let only the heroes heed the call.''
