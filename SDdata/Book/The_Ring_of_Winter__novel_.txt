The Ring of Winter, by James Lowder, is the fifth book in the loosely related The Harpers series.
Artus Cimber, adventurer, former Harper, and member of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers, discovers a Mulhorandi amulet containing a powerful magical servant named Skuld. He and his ally, Hydel Pontifax, who have spent a decade searching for the Ring of Winter, hear from Theron Silvermace, leader of the Stalwarts, that the Ring of Winter is in Chult, as Dhalmass Rayburton, founder of the Society, saved him using magical ice, employing two of the powers of the Ring of Winter immortality and invisibility. They travel to Chult pursued by their archenemy, Kaverin Ebonhand and his ally Phyrra al-Quim. Kaverin sends his ice assassins to kill Theron and Pontifex. Artus finds the city of Mezro, an ancient city home to the Tabaxi humans who follow the god Ubtao. Along the way, he meets Byrt and Lugg, two speaking wombats. He discovers that Lord Rayburton is a Bara, one of seven paladins of Ubtao that watch over Mezro with the gift of eternal life, and Rayburton denies having the ring, claiming Ras TFima, a fellow bara, created the ice with his bara abilities. Kaverin allies with Queen M’bobo of the cannibalistic Batiri goblins, feeding Phyrra to them and replacing her with Skuld. Artus finds Ras Nsi, a bara who was exiled for committing genocide on Mezro’s enemies, and learns that T’fimi is no longer a bara. He learns that the ring is in the Temple of Ubtao, passes Ubtao’s test to become a bara, and claims the ring. The Batiri attack Mezro, with Kaverin seeking to gain eternal life by becoming a bara, but Artus uses the ring to kill Skuld and Kaverin and defeat the Batiri. He then begins traveling the world with Alisanda Rayburton, who becomes his loverthumb|The map from Artus Cimbers journal.
