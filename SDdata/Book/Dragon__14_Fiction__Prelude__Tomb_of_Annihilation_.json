        "Synopsis": {
            "Part 1": "The story begins in [[Neverwinter]] amidst the backdrop of the [[death curse]], which is killing people who were raised from the dead. A [[Shadow Thief]] named [[Pion]] breaks into the mansion of [[Alfin Biscop]], a [[cleric]] of [[Torm]] and retired [[adventurer]] who has not been seen for six months. While trying to get into a trapped vault, Pion is fatally [[poison]]ed and is only saved by the intervention of Biscop, who is dying of the death curse and has been reclusively researching it. Biscop informs Pion that the poison has no antidote and will kill him, so his only chance to \"survive\" is if the death curse ends and then he dies and is brought back to life. Biscop promises to arrange for this on the condition that Pion deliver a message to the [[Harper]]s containing what he has learned about the cause of the death curse.",
            "Part 2": "A [[warlock]] [[artificer]] named [[Rokh Manti]] navigates the [[Positive Energy plane]] inside a specialized [[Apparatus of Kwalish|apparatus]]. His expedition was funded by the [[Harper]]s and based on information that they acquired from communing with [[god]]s, meeting with [[Szass Tam]], and consulting with knowledgeable mystics (notably including Alfin Biscop). Rokh discovers that all of the [[positive energy]] flowing to [[Toril]] is being siphoned to somewhere in [[Chult]], but before he can investigate further, his craft is destroyed by [[xag-ya]]s. It is revealed that Rokh's body is almost entirely artificial, and he manages to teleport his brain to safety just in time."
