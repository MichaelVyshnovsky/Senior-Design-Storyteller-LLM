The Strangers Log was a ledger kept by the Red Plumes that recorded every person who entered the city of Hillsfar.
The Strangers Log was a huge tome that rested on a stone stand near the gate of Hillsfar.
Anyone wishing to enter Hillsfar was challenged by the Red Plumes at the gates and asked their reason for entry. Those allowed to enter the city paid a fee of 2 gp and their names and physical descriptions were recorded into The Strangers Log.
