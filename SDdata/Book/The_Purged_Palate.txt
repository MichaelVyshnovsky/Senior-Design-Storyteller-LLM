'''''The Purged Palate''''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] cookbook periodical sold in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
Each issue of ''The Purged Palate'' was a collection of recipes and the author's anecdotes about the said dishes. The ''Midwinter Edition'' of the {{YearlinkName|1492}} included the recipe for ''[[eaglach]]'' stew, a traditional dwarven with a unique twist from the author. Its name, when translated, could sound terrifying for non-dwarves, and ''The Purged Palate's'' version came seasoned with [[drider venom]], added in after the stew's alcohol is completely cooked out. However, the author advised the readers not to use drider venom and instead just add other sour and non-deadly ingredients. The anecdote that accompanied ''eaglach'' came from the time the author worked as a city watchman. His dinner bowl was [[poison]]ed by a [[drow]] [[thief]], which resulted in a delicious dish rather than death.
