After publishing the book, Volo traveled to [[Port Nyanzaru]], where he visited several taverns to promote his work. He sold signed copies to the [[merchant prince]]s and to adventurers for 50 [[gp]].

After finishing his book tour, Volo returned to [[Waterdeep]], where he ran into financial difficulties while he waited for royalty payments from ''Volo's Guide to Monsters''. In order to offset his debt, Volo began working on his next book, ''[[Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters]]''.

==Reputation==
The book proved to be quite popular across the [[Faer√ªn|Realms]], notably with nobles and thrill-seekers from places like Waterdeep, [[Neverwinter]], and [[Baldur's Gate]]. Some sought to "follow in his footsteps" and visit some of the locations described in the book, leading to an influx of tourists to places like Phandalin.

Annotations by [[Elminster Aumar]] found on some copies of the book implied that some of the dangers involved in the field research conducted by Volo were attenuated by Elminster himself informing some monsters of the foul taste of Volothamps.
