        "mainbody": "century DR\nNotes from a Soothsayer was a case study book penned by a Waterdhavian soothsayer Jeraldine Haverlowe, available in the late 15 century DR.\nThe cover of the Notes from a Soothsayer was embossed with a notably Waterdhavian personal seal of Jeraldine Haverlowe, a soothsayer of some renown within the City of Splendors.\nThe large logbook collected numerous case studies meticulously recorded by Jeraldine. The 23 chapter of the book, The Frightened Noble and the Ochre Omen retold the interview between a nobleman of Waterdeep who remained unnamed and the soothsayer. The nobleman was a good accidence of Jeraldine Haverlowe, who used her services in the matters of love and money. However, that one interview was vastly different. The noble youth recounted his encounter with a sword-wielding humanoid. It had elfish ears, ochre-colored spotted skin, and a nose of a \"half-rotted corpse.\" The alien creature pointed his silver sword at the magically restrained noble and asked a question in an unknown tongue. Unable to communicate, the \"Ochre Omen\" spoke in Common, asking the terrified man what plane it was, as the youth passed out of fear.\nJeraldine Haverlowe could offer little insight into the strange encounter and instead prophesied it as an omen of doubled crops that year. Haverlowe convinced the nobleman that the alien creature was nothing but his inner demon.\nIn 1492 DR, a copy of the book could be found in the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands."
