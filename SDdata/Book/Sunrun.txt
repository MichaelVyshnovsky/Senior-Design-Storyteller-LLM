'''''Sunrun''''' was a famous [[dwarf|dwarven]] drinking song. Its name was a [[Dwarvish]] word translated to "nobody" in the [[Common tongue]].

==Content==
The lively drinking song's plot was about dwarves being blamed for one bad thing after another after being caught red-handed and each time they were caught the dwarves said that "Sunrun" did it.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]], a dwarvish [[Harper]], who went by the alias [[Sunrun (Harper)|Sunrun]], aided the heroes who would become gods: [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]], [[Cyric]], and [[Kelemvor]], during their stay at [[Scardale]].
