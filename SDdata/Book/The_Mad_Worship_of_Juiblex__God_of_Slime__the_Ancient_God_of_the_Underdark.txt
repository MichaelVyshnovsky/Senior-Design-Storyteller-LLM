The Mad Worship of Juiblex, God of Slime, the Ancient God of the Underdark was an evil and forbidden book from the old days of Myth Drannor.
The Mad Worship was a heavy tome bound in iron. It was wrapped in fabric and locked with iron chains preventing anyone from opening the forbidden book. This tome radiated palpable evil.
The book, apparently, possessed sentience and malicious intent, if freed from the metal bounds and opened, the evil book started loudly chant something sinister in an unknown language, calling upon Juiblex.
Sometime before the fall of Myth Drannor, the dwarves of the city created the arcane Pyre of Silence in the Deep Halls of the Dwarven Dungeons. The pyre was used to safely dispose of evil magical items. During the chaos of the Weeping War, a collection of evil books that included The Mad Worship of Juiblex, God of Slime, the Ancient God of the Underdark was bound for destruction but because of the fall of the city the books were left scattered around the many levels of the dungeons. The Mad Worship could be found in one of the locked rooms in the Halls of Stone level of the dungeon in 1369 DR.
