'''''A Harper's Song''''' was [[book]] penned by [[Alustriel Silverhand]], the High Lady of [[Silverymoon]], in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''[[High magic]] is strange and savage and splendid for its own sake, whether one's [[spell]]s change the Realms about or no. A craefter who by dint of luck, work, skill, and the mercy of the Great Lady [[Mystra]] comes to some strength in [[magic|art]] is like a thirsty drunk in a [[wine]] cellarâ€“he or she can never leave it alone. And who can blame such a one? It is not given to all to feel the kiss of such power.''|Excerpt from ''A Harper's Song''}}
