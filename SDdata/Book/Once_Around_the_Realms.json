        "mainbody": "Once Around the Realms is a stand-alone novel by Brian Thomsen.\nVolothamp Geddarm is tricked into accepting a bet by Hlaavin to travel around the world, dropping off necromancer gems to mark his progress. Hlaavin hopes to use the gems to create a teleportation network to expand the Unseen, his Doppelganger network. Volo sets out with Passepout, a thief/actor he met in Suzail. They pick up Curtis, a young Cormyrian noble, inÂ Khaerbaal, and rescue Shurleen Laduce, a servant of the heiress to Lord Bleth of the Seven Suns Trading Coster from a Tuigan tribe. They mistake Shurleen for the heiress, and she and Curtis fall in love. Eventually, Hlaavin kidnaps Volo and reveals his plan. The companions rescue him, and they hasten to Suzail, informing Khelben Arunsun and Vangerdahast of the plot. The wizards modify the gems so that they only teleport to one destination a gem dropped inside a volcano.\nOnce around the Realms was an attempt by TSRs fiction department to have other authors write for characters created by and associated with freelance authors. Although all work submitted by freelancers was done under a work-for-hire contract and therefore belonged to TSR, if the ownership of the characters was ever challenged in court, having a novel written using those characters by a TSR employee (Thomsen was TSRs Managing Editor for fiction) would put TSR in a much better position to defend its intellectual property rights and thereby make it easier to assign a new author to certain characters.\nCharacters\nCreatures\nLocations"
