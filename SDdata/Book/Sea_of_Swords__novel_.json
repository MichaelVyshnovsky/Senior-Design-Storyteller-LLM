Salvatore.\nSheila Kree, captain of the Bloody Keel, flees Captain Deudermonts Sea Sprite along with Bellany Tundash, a sorcereress and crew member. Elsewhere, a masked elf calling themself Lelorinel trains with a half-elf named Tunevec and a human wizard named Mahskevic, seeking practice at facing Drizzt DoUrdens fighting style.\nIn Bryn Shander, Cassius, who has been appointed Elderman of Ten-Towns, asks Regis (who was appointed councilor of Lonelywood) if he can bring his legendary friends to stop a gang of highwaymen. Regis gathers Drizzt, Catti-brie, and Bruenor Battlehammer, and they capture the bandits, led by a woman named Jule Pepper.\nOn the Sea of Swords, Wulfgar sails on the Sea Sprite, hunting Sheila Kree, but is reckless and uncontrollable in battle against pirates, unsettling the wizard Robillard. Meanwhile, Lel’lorinel consults the gnome diviner E’kressa, who sees a symbol, joint marks of Moradin, Clangeddin Silverbeard, and Dumathoin, the maker’s mark Bruenor used for Aegis-fang. E’kressa tells Lel’lorinel that seeking out the symbol is key to finding Drizzt. \nSheila Kree returns to the Golden Cove, her hideout, meeting with her ogre allies the chieftess Chogurugga, her mate Bloog, who now wields Aegis-Fang, and their son Bathunk. Regis discovers the mark of Aegis-Fang as a brand on Jule Pepper. Drizzt and Cattie-Brie set out for Luskan to get answers. Tunevec and Mahskevic try to warn Lel’lorinel against seeking out Drizzt, but she refuses to listen, seeking out the symbol. Sheila Kree sends one of her lieutenants, Gayselle Wayfarer, to attack Duedermont’s house in Waterdeep.\nDrizzt and Cattie-Brie meet with Arumn Gardpeck, Josi Puddles, and Morik the Rogue, learning of Wulfgar’s history, while Lel’lorinel asks about the symbol and is captured by Sheila’s pirates. Regis and Bruenor get a letter from Drizzt telling them what has been learned about Wulfgar, and they set out to help the search. Lel’lorinel convinces Sheila that Drizzt will seek her out, and she can help Sheila in the battle.\nGayselle attacks Duedermont’s house, nearly killing Delly Curtis and Colson before Drizzt and Cattie-Brie arrive and kill her. They set off for Luskan, hoping to find Wulfgar there. Jule Pepper, having escaped her capture, arrives at Golden Cove and tells Sheila that her efforts to establish a criminal presence in Icewind Dale were foiled by a dark elf. Sheila realizes Lellorinels warnings were real, and prepares for attackers from the Companions of the Hall\nDrizzt and Cattie-Brie reunite with Bruenor and Regis in Luskan. Bellany brings Morik back to Golden Cove, seeking information about Wulfgar and Drizzt. Wulfgar learns what has happened from Delly, but his failures to control himself on the Sea Sprite shook his confidence. He takes a job assisting a blacksmith until Robillard appears. Despite being the one who argued for Wulfgar leaving the ship, Robillard encourages Wulfgar to search out his friends and his former identity. He teleports the barbarian to Luskan.\nNear Auckney, Drizzt and his companions encounter an ogre raiding party led by Bathunk, and kill them. They meet with Lord Feringal and Lady Meralda, Colton’s birth mother. She figures out their connection to Wulfgar through stories Bruenor tolls. Drizz’t and Cattie-Brie reassure her that the baby is safe. Robillard helps Wulfgar find his companions, and then locates Golden Cove, before returning to the Sea Sprite.\nWulfgar apologizes and reconnects with his friends and family. Together, they attack Golden Cove. In the battle, Lel’lorinel helps Drizzt kill Bloog. Drizzt passes Aegis-Fang to Regis before dueling Lellorinel. Morik turns on Sheila to save Wulfgar, and Regis returns Aegis-Fang to his grasp. Bellany captures Regis, but doesn’t kill him. Drizzt mortally wounds Lel’lorinel only to be injured in turn by a fire shield spell. He realizes that Lel’lorinel is really Ellifain, the only survivor of a moon elf group that was killed in a drow raid that Drizzt was a part of, though Drizzt didn’t actually slay any of the elves. Chorugga is killed by Bruenor and Cattie-Brie. Drizzt tells his friends to save Ellifain, but they do not listen, administering a healing potion to save his life. Finally, as the Bloody Keel tries to flee, Cattie-Brie shoots the helmsman, causing the ship to capsize and sink in freezing waters.\nThe group buries Ellifain. Morik and Bellany return to Luskan, and the rest of the group returns to Icewind Dale, with the exception of Wulfgar, who goes to retrieve Delly and Colton. On the path, however, they encounter Thibbledorf Pwent, who tells them that Gandalug Battlehammer has died, and Bruenor is needed to become King of Mithral Hall once more.\nBruenor Battlehammer • Catti-brie • Colson • Delly Curtie • Deudermont • Drizzt DoUrden • Lelorinel • Morik the Rogue • Regis • Robillard •   Sheila Kree • Wulfgar"
