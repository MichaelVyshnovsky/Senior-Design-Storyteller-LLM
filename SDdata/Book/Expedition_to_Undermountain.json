Undermountain, as it is presented here, is a huge adventuring area for any D&D campaign, containing nine main levels and more than twenty sublevels, connecting to more extensive dungeons and caverns, and ultimately to the Underdark. The book treats Undermountain as an unexplored underground region, and provides plots, power groups, and lore to enable a Dungeon Master to detail any corner of Undermountain to create a long-term adventure setting. Encounters are presented in the book, which are designed to take a party of player characters from 1st level to 10th level. With an appendix it also describes a set of new creatures, such as the Eyeball Swarm, and new items, such as the Crown Adamant. \nArbenita Darkwind • Drexlyn Darrowdelve • Halaster Blackcloak • Hukurus • Jaxsen • Luranla Dreer • Malvar • Marrauda Belaskurth • Orbrin Baerent • SheruTan • Squammulsh • Tarlgarth Vathar • Xedac • \n • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  () •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nBodies of Water\nBuildings\nPlanes\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems \n • \n • \nClasses\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSubstances \nWeapons \nMisc\nCarousel\nUndermountain1 1280 1024.jpg|Promotional wallpaper 1\nUndermountain2 1280 1024.jpg|Promotional wallpaper 2\nUndermountain3 1280 1024.jpg|Promotional wallpaper 3\nExpedition to Undermountain Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Designers Eric L.
