Deities & Demigods was the first print appearance of various fictional non-human deities, such as Corellon, Moradin, Gruumsh, and others, many of which have become standard features of Dungeons & Dragons and its derivatives. These deities were the creation of James Ward. \nThe original edition covered 12 pantheons of gods from myth and folklore, plus gods for various nonhumans, and four fictional groups the Arthurian heroes, Fritz Leibers Nehwon mythos, Michael Moorcocks Melnibonéan mythos, and H. P. Lovecrafts Cthulhu Mythos. These statistics are presented in a fashion similar to that of the Monster Manual, and the statistics are accompanied by illustrations, as well as a short descriptive piece that details under what circumstances the god will appear, what the god might do if he does appear, and what his responsibilities and penchants may be. The book also details the mythoi of these religions, as well as how their clerics should behave, and describes the known planes of existence and how the afterlife applies to characters.\nLater printings of Deities & Demigods, beginning in 1981, removed some material present in the 1980 printings. The Cthulhu and Melnibonéan sections were removed from the 1981 edition, making it a 128-page hardcover. In that form, it is functionally identical to Legends & Lore\n* Preface\n* Credits and Acknowledgements\n* Editors Introduction\n* Explanatory Notes\n** Standard Divine Abilities\n* Dungeon Mastering Divine Beings\n* Clerics and Deities\n* Omens\n* Mortality and Immortality\n** Divine Ascension\n*American Indian Mythos\n*Arthurian Heroes\n*Babylonian Mythos\n*Celtic Mythos\n*Mesoamerican Mythos\n*Chinese Mythos\n*Cthulhu Mythos (first and second printings only)\n*Egyptian Mythos\n*Melnibonéan Mythos (first and second printings only)\n*Finnish Mythos\n*Greek Mythos and Heroes\n*Indian Mythos\n*Japanese Mythos\n*Nehwon Mythos\n*Nonhumans Deities\n*Norse Mythos\n*Sumerian Mythos\n* Appendix 1 The Known Planes of Existence\n* Appendix 2 Temple Trappings\n* Appendix 3 Clerical Quick Reference Chart\n* Appendix 4 Further References\n* Index to Proper Names\nManannan Mac Lir • Oghma • Silvanus\nDeities Demigods 1e Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Design James M.
