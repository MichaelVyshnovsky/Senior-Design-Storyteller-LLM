The '''''Trends in Approaches to the Art''''' was an old [[tome]] found in [[Candlekeep]] that discussed magic and some of its associated history.

==Description==
The book was rather large and heavy, held by [[ironroot]] panels and [[peryton]] hide. [[Orold Archemusk]] penned it with beautiful calligraphy and flourishes, accentuated by its black [[atharnscale]] [[ink]] that had not faded even if the pages had.

==Contents==
What the tome lacked in illustrations, it made up for in its runes, sigils, and drawings of complicated magical castings. These magics existed around the fall of [[Netheril]], and saw a resurgence of interest in the early 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

Within his work, Archemusk appeared to hold considerable respect for the mages of [[Athalantar]] and the [[wizard]]s who sought to conquer various portions of [[Faer√ªn]].

==History==
The tome was found by [[Elminster]] in the library fortress of [[Candlekeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, and in a [[Amn]]ian [[wizard]] tower about six centuries prior.
