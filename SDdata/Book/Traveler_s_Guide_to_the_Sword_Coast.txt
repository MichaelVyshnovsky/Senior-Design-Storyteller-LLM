'''''Traveler's Guide to the Sword Coast''''' was a many-volume collection of travel guides dedicated to the [[Sword Coast]] area of [[Faerûn]], published sometime before [[1492 DR]].

==Contents==
===Volume IV: The Risen Road===
The fourth section of the ''Traveler's Guide'' spoke of the [[Risen Road]], the route that connected the cities of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Elturel]], which ran parallel to the [[River Chionthar]]. It stated the road was a preferred alternative for those that did not wish to travel by river barge.

It highlighted some notable landmarks that could be found along the road, including the grand [[Shattered Sanctum|temple of Selûne]], the nearby village of [[Moonhaven]], and [[Moonrise Towers]].

===Volume VIII: The Outer City===
The eighth section of the book discussed the [[Baldur's Gate/Outer City|Outer City]] of Baldur's Gate. It detailed the numerous industries that helped keep the city running, but were deemed too unpleasant to be housed within the city's walls.

The author shared their opinion that any upstanding travelers should not spend too much time in the Outer City. Even the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] was a preferable place to spend one's time.

===Volume IX: Inns and Guesthouses===
The section of the tome that talked about travelers' accommodation in the city of Baldur's Gate mentioned several establishments of note. The [[Blade and Stars]] was one of the inns mentioned. The guide informed travelers of the inn's easy-to-spot signage depicting a [[wood]]en [[shield]], with a curved blade against a background of stars. It was a welcoming and quite inn that served somewhat plain grub but offered clean lodgings.

Another inn in the guide was the famed [[Blushing Maiden Inn]]. The guide warned visitors of its boisterous atmosphere of revelry that lasted into the night. Its namesake was a large wooden [[mermaid]] displayed to the establishment's patrons. Lastly, [[Elfsong Tavern]] received a limited entry as a dimly-lit inn known for its ghostly singing [[elf|elven]] maid and its proprietor named [[Alan Alyth|Alan]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, some copies of these volumes were in heavy everyday use. Some of the copies found in the wild suffered damage from elements, rough use, and age. Some were missing covers and binding altogether and had hand-written notes by the books' previous owners.
