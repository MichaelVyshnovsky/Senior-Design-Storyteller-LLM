        "mainbody": "he Orc King is the first novel of the Transitions series by R.A. Salvatore.\nA century after the end of the bloody war between the\ndwarves of Mithral Hall and the orc hordes of the orc king Obould Many-Arrows, the\ndrow ranger Drizzt DoUrden\nstill wielded his magical scimitars, Twinkle and Icingdeath, as well as Taulmaril,\nthe enchanted bow once possessed by his beloved wife, the human woman Catti-brie. Drizzt defeated a small group of bandits who were members\nof the vigilante organization called Casin\nCu Calas, which traveled through the Kingdom of Many-Arrows and slew orcs\nin their sleep. Drizzt was assisted in the fight by Hralien, the leader of the\nelves of the Glimmerwood (formerly the Moonwood), and a few of his warriors. Drizzt\nwas angered when one of the captives mentioned the so-called past weakness of\nBruenor Battlehammer, the renowned former king of Mithral Hall, by making peace\nwith the orcs. Reflecting on the hundred years of chaos that had gripped much\nof the world outside of the Silver Marches, Drizzt and Hralien discussed the\nmomentous decisions made by Bruenor and Obould a century earlier and the impact\nthat they had on the region. Also at that time, Obould VI, the sixth ruler of the\nKingdom of Many-Arrows, reflected on the century of slow progress in the orc\nrelations with the other races of the Silver Marches after he visited the home\nof an orc maiden who was set to marry a human from the Glimmerwood.\nA century before these events, in 1372\nDR, Drizzt and his traveling companion, the elf warrior Innovindil of the\nMoonwood, returned to Mithral Hall after a journey to the grave of the young elf\nEllifain Tuuserail. By that\ntime, Obould and his forces had completely blocked off\nthe valley of Keeper’s Dale to prevent any\ncounterattack from the dwarves of Mithral\nHall and had begun building the first settlements of his new kingdom. A few of the orc priests\nwho had pledged allegiance to Obould had become dissatisfied with the seeming\nend of the campaign against the Silver Marches and started conspiring against the\nking. In the hope of continuing the war, the shamans convinced Clan Karuck, a tribe\nof ogrillons (offspring of ogres and orcs) led by the chieftain Grguch, to\nleave their home in the Underdark and come to the surface of Toril.\nGrguch and\nhis followers soon began a campaign against the elves of the Moonwood, who had been highly\nsuccessful at attacking the orc settlements along their borders. During a\nfailed raid on an orc camp, the elves were surprised by the ferocity of Clan Karuck’s\ncounterattack, but Tosun Armgo, a renegade drow warrior and one of the original instigators of the orcs’\nwar against Mithral Hall, had been living alone in the area and led them to safety, a\nvery uncharacteristic action for a dark elf. A short time later, Innovindil and a band of her brethren were assailed by Clan\nKaruck and their orc allies in the Moonwood itself, and the elves were once\nagain routed. Clan Karuck’s cunning attack proved much more effective than their\nprevious one, with Innovindil and her pegasus Sunset as well as twelve other\nelves being slain. Hralien suspected that Tosun had planned the ambush because\nit was too well organized to have been thought of by orcs. However, the actual\norchestrator was the gnome wizard Jack, who had been trained by illithids and\nother powerful creatures and had been secretly controlling Clan Karuck’s\ndifferent shamans for centuries.\nMeanwhile, in Mithral Hall, Bruenor was convinced that a\nsinkhole that the halfling Regis had fallen into in the Fell Pass months earlier was the\nway to the ancient dwarven homeland of Gauntlgrym, and he organized a small\nparty to investigate. The skilled group consisted of Bruenor, Drizzt, Regis, the dwarf\ncleric Cordio\nMuffinhead,\nand the dwarf warriors Thibbledorf\nPwent\nand Torgar\nHammerstriker.\nAfter the friends left Mithral Hall and journeyed\nnorth through lands that were still gripped by winter, they entered the sinkhole only to find a\ncavern that was occupied by giant ethereal marauders. Once they killed the creatures,\nthe group traveled deeper into the cavern and discovered a large underground\ncity. However, upon exploring the city, which\nconsisted of buildings that looked like ones found above ground and not under it,\nDrizzt and the others doubted that it was actually Gauntlgrym. The companions were\nthen attacked by a nightwing and a nightwalker, two denizens of the Plane of\nShadow, but together they managed to slay the fearsome entities. Following the\nfight, they entered a massive building and found extraordinary statues and tapestries of orcs and dwarves dwelling together\nin peace. A frustrated Bruenor and his comrades gathered as many scrolls as possible and brought\nthem to Mithral Hall to Nanfoodle, a gnome alchemist and illusionist. \nWhile Bruenor and the others had\nattempted to discover Gauntlgrym, Catti-brie\nand the barbarian warrior Wulfgar had departed from Mithral Hall in the early\nspring to search for the latter’s missing adopted daughter, Colson. Although\nCatti-brie had a seriously injured leg, she and Wulfgar traveled on foot to the\ncity of Silverymoon, where she developed a closer relationship\nwith its ruler, the wizard Alustriel\nSilverhand. Wulfgar and Catti-brie learned that Colson had probably been taken\nto the town of Nesmé, which had been destroyed by the trolls of the Evermoors\na couple years earlier. When they reached Nesmé, the\ntwo companions discovered that the town was completely rebuilt and was much more\nfortified than it had been before the war against the trolls. Since\nGalen\nFirth, the captain of the Riders of Nesmé,\nwas in command of the town, Wulfgar met with him in order to demand that Colson\nbe given over to him. Despite having absolutely no liking for Wulfgar, Firth\ndecided that it would be politically wise for him to acquiesce. With Colson\nretrieved, Wulfgar told Catti-brie that he had decided to take the young girl\nback to her birthmother and that he was going to return home to Icewind\nDale to rejoin the Tribe of the Elk. Catti-brie was the only\none of their group of friends who had not yet realized Wulfgar’s plans, and though\nshe was saddened by them, she did not stop him from leaving. After returning\nColson to her original home in the village of Auckney, Wulfgar began the long\njourney north to Icewind Dale. \nIn response to the attack on the\nMoonwood, Hralien made his way to Mithral Hall\nto ask for Drizzt’s help in tracking Tosun, whom the elves believed was once\nagain aiding the orcs. Once he learned that Innovindil was dead and that Tosun\nwielded Khazidhea, a powerful and sentient sword previously possessed by\nCatti-brie, Drizzt agreed to hunt down the rogue drow. The same day that Drizzt\ndeparted from Mithral Hall to begin his search for Tosun, Catti-brie arrived\nat the dwarven stronghold with Alustriel and an entourage of Silverymoon wizards.\nThe group from Silverymoon had traveled to Mithral Hall to help construct a new\nbridge across the River Surbrin, so that the dwarves would once again\nhave efficient access to the rest of the Silver Marches and trade could be renewed.\nHowever, Bruenor was angry that Alustriel would not agree to rally the armies\nof the Silver Marches against the orcs, and he was determined to show that the\nscrolls recovered from the underground city told of how the orcs had betrayed\nthe dwarves. \nAfter the successful attacks\nagainst the elves, Clan Karuck and Toogwik Tuk, one of the orc priests\nwho had conspired against Obould, raised an army numbering in the thousands from\nalong the eastern edge of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows. Grguch led the horde in a\ndirect attack against the not-quite-finished defensive wall that protected\nMithral Hall’s eastern entrance. Since Alustriel’s wizards had prepared spells\nintended for the construction of the bridge across the River Surbrin, they were\nnot prepared to help the dwarves resist Grguch’s forces when they launched an\nassault that night. The defenders were forced to retreat before the orcs’\nonslaught, though not before Catti-brie had her first experience wielding the\npower of magic by using some powerful items given to her by Alustriel. By the\ntime that the mages had prepared their battle spells and a dwarven force\nemerged from Mithral Hall the next morning, Grguch’s horde was gone and the\nentire building site was devastated. After collecting the bodies of the dead, Alustriel\nand her surviving wizards agreed to remain in the area to help rebuild the wall\nand finish the bridge, but she still would not send the armies of Silverymoon against\nthe orcs, much to Bruenor’s rage. \nSeveral days later, Nanfoodle and Regis deciphered the scrolls\nfrom the underground city, which were written in a language that was a mixture\nof dwarven and orcish alphabets. According to the text, dwarves and orcs had\nlived together for centuries in the city and relations had continued to improve\nbetween the two races. After gathering additional information from Regis,\nNanfoodle ascertained that the only reason that the city fell was because\nsomething melted the permafrost beneath it, sucking the entire community and\nits population underground. Even after Regis and Nanfoodle revealed this\ninformation to Bruenor, the dwarf king was still determined to continue the war\nagainst the orcs. In his anger, Bruenor decided that the best way to defeat the\nenemy would be to lead a small but formidable group into the orc kingdom to\nassassinate Obould himself. Shortly afterward, a party consisting of Bruenor,\nRegis, Hralien, Torgar, Pwent, Cordio, and the dwarf\nfighter Shingles McRuff left Mithral Hall\nto find Drizzt and add his strength to their band before trying to kill Obould.\nOnce he\nwas tracked down by Drizzt, Tosun gave in to the urgings of Khazidhea and\nattempted to kill the ranger, but after a ferocious fight he was subdued and\ndisarmed. Tosun claimed to be innocent of aiding the orcs in the new attacks, and\nhe and Drizzt joined Bruenor and the others in the assassination mission. However,\nthe companions were less than convinced of Tosun’s innocence and decided to\nkeep a watchful eye on him. \nWith all of Clan Karuck’s\nvictories against both the elves and the dwarves, Grguch had made Obould’s\narmies restless and eager for war. In response, Obould sent the orc shaman Nukkels\nto parley with the dwarves and apologize for the attacks, and he also dispatched\na messenger to Grguch. The riders sent to Mithral Hall were captured by\ntreacherous orcs, and when Grguch learned of the peace mission, he killed the\nmessenger sent to him by Obould and prepared his own forces for an assault on\nObould’s encampment in order to overthrow the king and continue the war against\nthe Silver Marches. As Bruenor and his companions traveled toward Obould’s camp,\nDrizzt and Hralien searched for a way to prove Tosun’s blamelessness in the\nnew orc offensive. Overhearing a discussion between two of the original orc conspirators\nthat proved Tosun’s innocence, Drizzt confirmed that the rogue drow could be\ntrusted, and the group immediately moved to confront Obould. \nUpon their arrival, Drizzt and his companions discovered a\nbrutal battle raging between the followers of Obould and Grguch, and the orc\nleaders themselves engaged in single combat. Obould was slowly gaining the\nadvantage in the fight until Hakuun, the ogrillon shaman of Clan Karuck who was\nbeing by possessed by Jack, started blasting the orc king with lightning bolts.\nAs Drizzt and his comrades fought their way through the battling forces toward\nthe orc leaders, the drow ranger forced Bruenor to choose the fate of the region\nwar or peace with the orcs. Bruenor made his decision by leaping atop the\nweakened Obould to launch himself at Grguch. While his other friends continued\nto battle the orc soldiers, Drizzt engaged Hakuun and ultimately slew the\nshaman as well as the shape-shifting Jack. Bruenor fought a vicious duel against\nGrguch, which ended with the ogrillon chieftain disemboweled and decapitated\nafter Obould joined the clash.  \nOnce Grguch’s remaining followers were defeated, a battered Bruenor\nand Regis, who had been seriously wounded in the fighting, were brought before\nObould. As Bruenor and Obould stared each other down, Nukkels healed Regis at the\norc king’s command. Obould then lowered his weapon and agreed to establish peace\nwith Mithral Hall and the other nations of the Silver Marches. Due to Tosun’s\nbrave actions during the battle, Hralien decided to allow him to live alongside\nthe elves in the Moonwood.\nWhen Bruenor and his companions returned from the fateful\nbattle, Drizzt gave Catti-brie the enchanted robes that he had taken from\nJack’s corpse, and she began to be tutored in the magical arts by Alustriel and\nNanfoodle. A short time later, in the large chamber in Mithral Hall known as Garumn’s\nGorge, Bruenor and Obould signed a treaty that ended the war between the two peoples\nand officially established the Kingdom of Many-Arrows. \nA century after the signing of the Treaty of Garumn’s Gorge,\nDrizzt and Hralien remained with the captured members of Casin Cu Calas while they reflected\non those past events. The two discussed how Bruenor’s brave decision to\naccept peace with Obould had been for the greater good and had brought a\ncentury of relative peace to the Silver Marches. Drizzt also mentioned how\nHralien’s trust in Tosun all those years earlier had resulted in the drow\nmarrying the elf leader Sinnifain and the couple having two children together."
