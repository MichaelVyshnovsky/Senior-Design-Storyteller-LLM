        "mainbody": "'''''The Adventures of Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei''''' was a [[book]] that recounted a lucky foray into the life of adventuring by ambitious youths [[Grin]] and [[Richard (adventurer)|Richard]], and young [[elf|elven]] [[monk]] [[Wu-Wei]].\n{{quote|Look for something long enough, and you will find it; look for something without understanding, and it will find you.|Excerpt from ''The Adventures of Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei''.}}",
        "Contents": "This flowery-worded tome chronicled the escapades of a group of young adventurers. It opened with the introduction of a young and sheltered elven monk named Wu-Wei, who set out on a metaphorical path to glory and adventure filled with briars. To aid him through the challenges, two ambitious youths joined the group: Grin, and Richard, with their eyes affixed on a bright future. Grin and Richard embarked on their adventuring paths after leaving their homes far behind with bridges ablaze.\n\nThe youths decided to follow rumors of a dungeon flush with riches and eventually got lost searching for the fabled site. One morning, they discovered a tower that seemingly appeared by their camp overnight. Overjoyed with the fact that adventure found them, Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei found a way into the mysterious structure. Grin and Wu sprinted up the tower stairs, with Richard lagging behind. The slower person of the group noted the strange dampness that permeated the tower. As they reached the top, the youths found no [[gem]]s nor [[coin]]s or even captive maidens. Instead of riches, they found a mouth, the very worst kind of mouthâ€”the one they were already inside of. With a chill in their bones, the adventurers realized that they had rushed inside a great and hungry [[house hunter|mimic]].\n\nThe book claimed that Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei survived the ordeal by the skin of their teeth, and were they dead, the author would not have felt good about profiting from the demise of the youths. The author encouraged all aspiring adventurers to learn from the story.",
        "History": "Copies of ''The Adventures of Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei'' could be found around [[Neverwinter]], and the general area of the [[Sword Coast North]] ''circa'' 1372 DR and the [[Moonsea]] region around [[1373 DR]]."
