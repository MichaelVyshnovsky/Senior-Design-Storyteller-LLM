'''''The Devil You Know: An Autobiography''''' was a [[book]] written by a [[tiefling]], about the nature of tieflings following their forced transformation to [[Asmodeus#Post-Spellplague Era|Asmodean lineage]].

{{quote|''Have you ever had a god change your blood? It is a horrifying thing, even for those who may desire it.''|Excerpt from ''The Devil You Know: An Autobiography''}}

==Description==
The thin tome had a notable, mustard-yellow cover.

==Contents==
''The Devil You Know'' outlined the existence of tieflings and how they were viewed by others in the Realms, as seen by the author. It pointed out hypocrisies of [[Faerûn]]ian culture: how "devilkin" were wholly evil by nature of their birth yet [[warlock]]s who actively made pacts with [[fiend]]s were so often less-vilified. The author shared their personal enmity for the [[Toril Thirteen]] ― the group of warlocks whose actions allowed Asmodeus to claim all of Torilian tieflings as his own ― along with the futility of harboring that hatred.

The author wrote that, while most folks of the Realms believed tieflings to be unscrupulous and immoral, it was Asmodeus' true wish their kind would make those beliefs true in action. It was that reason that drove the author to keep true to their moral compass and not give in to a life of crime or debauchery.
