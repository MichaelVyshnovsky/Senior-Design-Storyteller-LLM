        "Contents": "* Introduction\n* Chapter 1: Armor\n* Chapter 2: Weapons\n* Chapter 3: Clothing\n* Chapter 4: Tools\n* Chapter 5: Magic Item Sets\n* Chapter 6: Using Magic Items\n* Appendix I: Magic Items by Price\n* Appendix II: Random Treasure\n* Magic Item Record Sheet",
        "Description": "The ''Magic Item Compendium'' contains over a thousand magic items used in {{dnd}}. The book contains new items as well as items previously appearing in 3rd edition books, including the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]'', ''[[Magic of Faerûn]]'', and ''[[Complete Divine]]'', updated as necessary for the 3.5{{th}}-edition ruleset. It also includes a number from previous ''Forgotten Realms'' sources.\n\nThe book classifies the items according to four broad categories: Armor, Weapons, Clothing, and Tools. Clothing refers to any non-armor item that occupies an equipment slot, including magical rings. Tools, including potions, scrolls, staves, and wands, are magical items that do not take up an equipment slot. It also details item sets, which are collections of items of the four major types that individually have magical powers but will exhibit stronger effects as more items in the set are collected by a player character. \n\nThe ''Magic Item Compendium'' covers the use of magic items as well as their placement and creation. This chapter sets out specific rules on the use and creation of all magical items. Two appendices are included: one is a list of all the items in the ''Compendium'' and the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 3rd edition|Dungeon Masters Guide]]'' by price, and the other is a set of new randomized treasure tables. \n\nEach individual item description details the item's price and item level, the equipment slot the item occupies, the caster level required to craft the item, the school of magic the item's effect falls under, the actual effect of the item, the type of player action used to activate the item, the item's weight, and any prerequisites and costs associated with the item's creation or use. A physical description of each item is also included. \n\nFinally, the Magic Item Compendium offers an optional gear-selection system that is vastly simplified while remaining compatible with the existing system. This simplified system makes it easy for Dungeon Masters to quickly design non-player characters with level-appropriate gear and equipment, without the arithmetic required in the 3{{rd}}-edition ruleset.",
