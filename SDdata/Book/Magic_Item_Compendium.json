The book contains new items as well as items previously appearing in 3rd edition books, including the Arms and Equipment Guide, Magic of Faerûn, and Complete Divine, updated as necessary for the 3.5-edition ruleset. It also includes a number from previous Forgotten Realms sources.\nThe book classifies the items according to four broad categories Armor, Weapons, Clothing, and Tools. Clothing refers to any non-armor item that occupies an equipment slot, including magical rings. Tools, including potions, scrolls, staves, and wands, are magical items that do not take up an equipment slot. It also details item sets, which are collections of items of the four major types that individually have magical powers but will exhibit stronger effects as more items in the set are collected by a player character. \nThe Magic Item Compendium covers the use of magic items as well as their placement and creation. This chapter sets out specific rules on the use and creation of all magical items. Two appendices are included one is a list of all the items in the Compendium and the Dungeon Masters Guide by price, and the other is a set of new randomized treasure tables. \nEach individual item description details the items price and item level, the equipment slot the item occupies, the caster level required to craft the item, the school of magic the items effect falls under, the actual effect of the item, the type of player action used to activate the item, the items weight, and any prerequisites and costs associated with the items creation or use. A physical description of each item is also included. \nFinally, the Magic Item Compendium offers an optional gear-selection system that is vastly simplified while remaining compatible with the existing system. This simplified system makes it easy for Dungeon Masters to quickly design non-player characters with level-appropriate gear and equipment, without the arithmetic required in the 3-edition ruleset.\nMagicItemComp1 1280x1024.jpg|Promotional wallpaper 1\nMagicItemComp2 1280x1024.jpg|Promotional wallpaper 2\nMagicItemComp3 1280x1024.jpg|Promotional wallpaper 3\nMagic Item Compendium Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nMagic Item Compendium Premium Edition Cover.jpg|Magic Item Compendium Premium Edition Cover\nMagic Item Compendium Premium Edition Back Cover.jpg|Magic Item Compendium Premium Edition Back Cover\n* Designers Andy Collins, Eytan Bernstein, Frank Brunner, Owen K.C.
