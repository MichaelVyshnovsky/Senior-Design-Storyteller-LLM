A sweeping adventure of the Forgotten Realms to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', written by New York Times best-selling author R.A. Salvatore.

When Drizzt Do’Urden first entered Icewind Dale in 1347, he found a place quite unlike anywhere he had ever known, a land of freezing winds and ferocious monsters, of dramatic vistas and unrelenting challenges. Most of all, though, he found a land populated by folk who knew all too well the price of a misstep, whether walking into a yeti den or trusting a stranger.

Making his way in those early days was no easy task, but Drizzt would find focus and joy in watching the antics of a girl and a bunch of dwarfs trying to keep her from getting herself killed. A girl who would become his friend, who would become a woman, who would become his wife.

When Breezy Do’Urden, the daughter of that marriage, enters Icewind Dale more than 150 years later, she finds a land no more tamed. And while her father’s reputation has mostly smoothed the way for her among the ever-suspicious people, she carries her own concerns, confusion, and a trauma realized in the difficult journey through the Spine of the Word Mountain.

She also carries the blood on her hands.|Publisher's description}}
