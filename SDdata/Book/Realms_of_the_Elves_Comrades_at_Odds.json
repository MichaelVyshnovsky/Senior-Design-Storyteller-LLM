        "mainbody": "\"Comrades at Odds\" is a short story by R.A. Salvatore first published in the 2006 anthology Realms of the Elves.\nTosun Armgo finds himself without any allies since his three drow companions are all dead and he has become an enemy of King Obould Many-Arrows because of Kaerlic Suun Wetts attempt to kill the orc while Obould and Drizzt DoUrden were fighting. Tosun knows that he cannot survive the journey back through the Underdark alone. Feeling helpless on the surface world, he lets out his rage by attacking orcs with the powerful sentient blade Khazidhea.\nOn their journey to recover the body of Ellifain, Drizzt DoUrden and Innovindil find that the orc hordes have not yet disbanded after the (so Drizzt and Innovindil believe) death of King Obould. Upon inspection, the two elves find that the orcs are building a gate upon a trail further fortifying the orc kingdom. Realizing there is nothing they can do, they continue their journey.\nTosun Armgo becomes more powerful and dangerous under the subtle tutelage of Khazidhea. In the battles the drow wages on unsuspecting orcs, the blade imparts the thoughts of \"do not think\", instilling to Tosun to rely on his instincts and training without allowing his conscious thoughts to impede him. This was what Khazidhea learned from Drizzt in the short time he wielded the blade.\nThe elves of the Moonwood find another scene where orcs were slain by Tosun. Sinnafain and Albondiel discuss whether Tosun is good or evil and that they will treat him accordingly.\nDrizzt and Innovindil find and recover the body of Ellifain whereupon Innovindil performs a ritual asking the elven gods to rescue Ellifain from her anger. Innovindil comforts Drizzt and assures him that they will convene with the spirit of Ellifain upon their return to the Moonwood to ease Drizzts own guilt.\nAs Tosun is about to finish slaying an orc encampment, one orc falls to elven arrows. He meets with Sinnafain but she shows no signs of aggression towards him. Khazidhea implores him to kill her but he resists knowing the he would have a dozen arrows in him before his first attack. An elven priest casts a spell to converse with the dark elf as well as a spell to detect lies. Khazidhea assists Tosun to deceive the latter spell. After the encounter, the blade tries to convince Tosun to leave the elves but the drow knows he has no where else to go.\nDrizzt and Innovindil return to the Moonwood where they encounter a patrol of elves. They recount their story to the patrol and also learn that King Obould is still alive and also find out that Tosun Armgo is now residing in the Moonwood with the elves.\nUpon finding out that Drizzt is in the Moonwood, Khazidhea once again tries to convince Tosun to leave. The blade tells him that Drizzt will recognize from the battle with Obould and that at the very least he would take Khazidhea back since it previously belonged to Catti-brie. Tosun agrees to leave and the blade tells him to kill Sinnafain who is the elf near to his position. Tosun strikes her to the ground and puts the blade to her chin but does not kill her. He tells her that he is not her enemy but Drizzt would not understand. After disarming her and moving farther from the camp of elves, he forces Sinnafain to the ground once again and runs away.\nWhen Drizzt and Innovindil meet up with Sinnafain and she tells him of Tosuns escape, he vows to find him. Later, a priest performs a ritual which allows Ellifains spirit to possess Innovindils body. Innovindils body walks to the hut in which Drizzt is residing in, kneels next to him and confirms that she is the spirit of Ellifain. She embraces him and tells that now she knows the truth. After the spirit of Ellifain leaves, Innovindil returns to a Drizzt free of guilt and ready to face the obstacles before him."
