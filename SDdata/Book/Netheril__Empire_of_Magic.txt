==Description==
''Netheril: Empire of Magic'' the ancient and powerful empire of [[Netheril]]. The boxed set was designed to provide Dungeon Masters and players with a detailed account of Netheril's rise, zenith, and eventual fall, along with resources to create adventures within this lost civilization.

The boxed set contains two sourcebooks filled with historical narratives, descriptions of life in Netheril, and details on the empire's geography, politics, and society. These books also looked into the workings of the Netherese [[arcanist]]s. The sourcebooks provide a look at the magical innovations and artifacts that defined Netheril, offering insight into the arcane forces that both empowered and doomed the empire.

''Netheril: Empire of Magic'' includes a series of adventure scenarios that allow players to engage directly with key events in Netheril's history. These adventures are designed to guide players through significant periods in the empire's timeline, from its ascension to its catastrophic fall, providing opportunities to interact with legendary figures and witness firsthand the consequences of unrestrained magical ambition.

The boxed set also features detailed maps and charts that depict the empire's geography, including its famous floating cities. In addition, it covers the [[mythallar]]s, massive magical artifacts, including the floating cities and powerful spells that defined the empire. The set provides rules and guidelines for incorporating mythallars and other Netherese magic into AD&D campaigns.
