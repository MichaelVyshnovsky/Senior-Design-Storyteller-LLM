'''''Nchaser's Eiyromancia''''' was a potent [[spellbook]] written by the [[mage]] [[Nchaser]] in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Folk legends claimed that all who tried to open the book would die.<ref group="note">The spellbook is referred to as ''Nchaser's Eiyromancia'' in all materials except the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV]]'' (1995), where it is listed as '''''Nchaser's Elyromancia'''''.

==Description==
The tome was thin and bound in black [[leather]] with beaten [[copper]] strips around the edges. The title "Eiyromancia" was inlaid on the cover with [[mother of pearl]]. It was locked with two clasps fitted to the copper edges that could be released by turning [[silver]] knobs. However, if the bottom knob was turned before the top one, a [[needle]] concealed within the bottom knob would deliver a dose of fatal [[poison]] to whomever was attempting to open it. and a reservoir of the substance was concealed beneath the book's cover, thus allowing the deadly defense mechanism to reset itself.

==Contents==
The ''Eiyromancia'' contained four powerful [[wizard]] [[spell]]s, including two which were unique and not found anywhere else: ''[[Nchaser's glowing globe]]''&mdash;devised by Nchaser himself&mdash;and ''[[Nulathoe's ninemen]]''&mdash;devised by his mentor, [[Nulathoe]]. The remaining two spells were ''[[part water]]'' and ''[[statue]]''.

==History==
During one of the only two times he stayed in one place while wandering the [[Faer√ªn|Realms]], Nchaser wrote his ''Eiyromancia'' sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1337}}, while living in [[Luskan]] as an advisor to the [[High Captains of Luskan|High Captains]]. He gifted the book to High Captain [[Taerl]] before disappearing, and shortly after his departure, the tome was stolen. However, during the book's time in Luskan, the mage [[Arbane the Mighty|Arbane]] was briefly able to view the book on account of his friendship with High Captain [[Suljack]], and he would later spread the story of the spells contained within.

For the next twenty years or so, the ''Eiyromancia'' would occasionally resurface around the Realms. It was briefly possessed by High Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand]] of [[Silverymoon]], who gifted it to a [[dwarf]] who in turn disappeared, having never returned to his home at [[Citadel Adbar]]. The book was subsequently acquired by a group of dwarven [[adventurer]]s in the forests of the [[North]], who sold it to a merchant known as [[Furjur|Furjur the Flippant]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, Furjur gifted the tome to Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] of [[Neverwinter]] in exchange for a charter. A member of Lord Nasher's court subsequently triggered the book's lethal defense mechanism, and his death was observed and recorded by an [[assassin]] named [[Nathode]], whose first-hand account (and expertise in poisons) finally provided an explanation for the myth that all those who handled the book would die. After this incident, the book was left unopened and was placed in Lord Nasher's library. Not long after, it was stolen during the chaos of the [[Five Fires Rising]], and once again its location became a mystery.
