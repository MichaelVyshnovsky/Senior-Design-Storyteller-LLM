        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], the finale of the voluminous ''Fall of Myth Drannor'' opera was performed by the god [[Milil]], the Lord of All Songs. He imposed the beautiful song on an audience of [[Sensates]] from [[Sigil]] who were performing a ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' ritual to experience the forbidden experience of spying on [[Toril]]lian deities. After a dozen of excruciatingly long songs it became apparent to the Sensates that the concert was a form of punishment for spying."
