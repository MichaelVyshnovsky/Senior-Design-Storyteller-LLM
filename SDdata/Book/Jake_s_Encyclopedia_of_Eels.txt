Jakes Encyclopedia of Eels was a single self-published tome of knowledge about eels, available in the late 15 century DR.
Jakes Encyclopedia was a shabbily cobbled-together book, loosely bound and filled with unevenly sized pages. The book was written in a similarly chaotic uneven script. The ink used was just as random as the rest of the book seemingly, the author used whatever ink he could find.
The authors foreword was written as a direct address to the grand library of Candlekeep, as a response to it turning down the authors book.
The book started by arguing that giant lightning eels only look like eels, such as giant morays, but in reality were not closely related to them, on account of their differing head shapes and bone structures.
The next part of the book talked about how abundant eels were across the Realms and that they could be easily caught everywhere in Neverwinter, Elturel, Calimport, and many other places. The author shared folklore about the origins of these slippery creatures. Some claimed eels were merely fish who learned to swim, some said that eels were baby leviathans, and some even accused them of being spies for the Underdark. However, the author was convinced that all eels bred in the Sea of Moonshae and traveled all over Faer√ªn from there.
Following this bold claim, the author went on rambling about the scholars of Candlekeep refusing to finance his research on the matter. The book continued this tirade for a few pages until it went back to the topic of eels.
In 1492 DR, a copy of Jakes Encyclopedia of Eels could be found in one of the suites of the Waukeens Rest in the Western Heartlands. Judging by the books contents, the author, Jake, applied for sponsorship for his eel research with the scholars of Candlekeep sometime before 1492 DR.
