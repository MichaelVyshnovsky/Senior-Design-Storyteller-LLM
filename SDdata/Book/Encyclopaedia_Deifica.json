It detailed a range of [[god]]s and [[goddess]]es of various pantheons.\n\nIt was written after the [[Godswar]] of [[1358 DR]], and had an edition printed in [[1370 DR]]. This had a \"somewhat rambling\" introduction summarizing the overall history of [[Faer√ªn]], mentioning the [[creator race]]s and arrivals of other races, and describing the nature of the deities of [[Abeir-Toril]]."
