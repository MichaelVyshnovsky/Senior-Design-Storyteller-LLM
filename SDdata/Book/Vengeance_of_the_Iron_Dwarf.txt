Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf is the third and final book of the Companions Codex series by R.A. Salvatore. 
The story of the War of the Silver Marches continues with the three dwarven strongholds—Mithral Hall, Citadel Felbarr, and Citadel Adbar—under siege and the cities of Nesmé and Sundabar (renamed "Hartusk Keep") already captured by the forces of the Many-Arrows, aided by frost giants and a number of drow from Menzoberranzan and QXorlarrin.
King Connerad Brawnanvil of Mithral Hall, along with Drizzt DoUrden, Bruenor Battlehammer, Catti-brie, and Athrogate have arrived at Citadel Felbarr to discuss the dwarven kingdoms next steps. Bruenor, known to the other dwarves as Reginald Roundshield, reveals himself to be the once-king of Mithral Hall reborn. The dwarves and their guests celebrate Bruenors return before the remaining Companions of the Hall and Athrogate return to Mithral Hall.
In the Underdark, Regis and Wulfgar, who were separated from their friends at the underground gates of Mithral Hall, are surviving but unable to return to their friends due to the hordes of orcs every which way. They decide to travel east towards Citadel Felbarr, but they must guess which direction east is.
In Nesmé, the drow Tiago grows bored with orders from Menzoberranzan to sit quietly in the lands conquered by Many-Arrows. As winter sets in, he takes the white wyrm Arauthator to seal off the chimneys of Mithral Hall. The orcs take his measures a step further by causing avalanches to seal the fortress tight under Fourthpeak. The dwarves sneak out of the mountain, hoping to ambush the besieging orcs, but Drizzt discovers that it is a trap and they all return to their tunnels. Arauthator and his son Aurbangras return to the Spine of the World for the winter.
During the winter, the dwarven kingdomes continually try to break out of the grip of Many-Arrows, but fail each time. The elves of the Glimmerwood, led by Sinnafein, see how desperate the dwarves are becoming and plan to aid them. Catti-brie, using her magic to find out how the other kingdoms are doing, learns of the great hunger and suffering of Citadel Adbar and convinces her companions that they must find a way to break the siege.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Back in the Underdark, Regis travels down an underground river in search of help for Wulfgar, who has been badly wounded. Regis finds Knight-Commander Aleina Brightlance of the Knights in Silver and refugees from Sundabar. The two companions join the group and journey to the Underdark around Silverymoon, where they chase away the drow and orc forces. They enter the city and solicit aid from Taern Hornblade, the High Mage of Silverymoon.
Meanwhile, the Glimmerwood elves are approached by Ambergris and Afafrenfere, who come bearing aid from a mysterious benefactor (Jarlaxle). They are joined by a strange elf named "Mickey" (Tazmikella), who informs them of a plan to free the Silver Marches from the orc oppressors. Mickey takes Sinnafein to Mithral Hall unnoticed, where they include the remaining Companions of the Hall in their plans. A small group of elite warriors with Bruenor Battlehammer escape Mithral Hall and journey onward to free Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr. Bruenor unites the dwarven forces to retake the River Surbrin bridge from the forces of Many-Arrows. In the sky above the battle, Drizzt and Afafrenfere on the copper dragons Ilnezhara and Tazmikella confront Tiago and Tosun Armgo on the white dragons Arauthator and Aurbangras, leaving Tosun and Aurbangras dead and Arauthator in retreat. Bruenor then uses the "Ritual of the March" to conquer Dark Arrow Keep, restoring it to Lorgru, its proper ruler, and defeating Hartusks remaining armies.
The last thing to remain is the Darkening, the pervasive dark clouds blocking the sun. Drizzt feels as if the might of Mielikki has come upon him and he is able to disperse the darkness. However, unbeknownst to him, it is in fact Gromph Baenre (at Jarlaxles insistence) using Drizzt as a vessel for his powerful magic. As the Companions of the Hall come together again, Bruenor sets his eyes on on freeing Gauntlgrym from the drow.
