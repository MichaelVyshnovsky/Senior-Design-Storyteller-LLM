        "Contents": "The guide contained information on the locations within the city of [[Samargol]], curious and strange sites in the jungles of [[Samarach]], several smaller surroundings cities, recount of his business with the merchant [[Sa'Sani]], heroic deeds of the survivors of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'', and, presumably, several other locales of the \"Serpent Kingdoms.\" According to the eyewitness accounts, ''Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms'' was filled with exaggerations.",
        "History": "Volo's fateful trip to Samarach took place in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. During the disastrous sailing from the [[Sword Coast]] to the [[Snout of Omgar]] and his dealing with the merchants of Samargol, Volo enlisted the help of his fellow shipwreck survivors. The Adventurers collected lore, history, and information on the region for the book. ''Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms'' was finished and published after Volothamp's return to the [[Crossroad Keep]] on the Sword Coast."
