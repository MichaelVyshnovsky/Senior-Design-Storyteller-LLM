        "mainbody": "Faldorns Canticle The Shadow Druids Doctrine was a tome that collected the set of beliefs of the Shadow Druids, penned by Faldorn sometime before 1492 DR.\nFaldorns Canticle was an old tome with its covers sprouting moss in the corners and was home to buzzing insects.\nThe Shadow Druid doctrine called for isolationism and aggression, claiming the balance of the nature was merely a myth.\nIn 1492 DR, a copy of this book was in possession of a druid named Kagha who was part of the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands. She secretly followed the Shadow Druids Doctrine and hoped to perform the Rite of Thorns. Kaghas copy of the book was rugged by heavy use, its spine was softened and the book had a pared folded to mark a specific passage."
