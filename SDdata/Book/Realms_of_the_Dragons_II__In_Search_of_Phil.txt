'''''"Realms of the Dragons II: In Search of Phil"''''' is a short promotional skit for the authors of [[Realms of the Dragons II]]. It was published credited to "The Ten Adventurers and Phil" in the Wizards of the Coast website.

==Summary==
In this skit, ten (actually, eleven) people are looking for a dragon, Phil the Athanian, in a W.O.T.C. library, to present unto him a powerful artifact. After failing to find him in a book, one of them discovers a stray scale; putting this scale back in place on the dragon near the restroom signs opens a hidden passage to the dragon's lair.

A [[nimblewright]] defends it; however, the ruckus attracts the librarian, who tells the construct to knock it off. He then leads the ten people to a portal; they are too hesitant to cross, however, and the librarian becomes so cross he reveals himself to be Phil the Athanian and kills them all but one, judging their submissions to be inadequate for various reasons.

That one finally presents him with the artifact they came to deliver: a pen so that he can sign their publishing contract.{{Cite web/Realms of the Dragons II: In Search of Phil}}
