'''"Darksword"''' is a short story by [[Troy Denning]] that appeared in the ''[[Realms of Shadow]]'' anthology of stories from the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', published in April 2002.

==Summary==
On [[Flamerule 20]] in the {{YearlinkName|1269}}, [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] a [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] of [[Shade Enclave]] and powerful shadow mage encounters [[Bodvar]] of the [[Moor Eagles]] in [[Vaasa]]. Bodvar is a proud Vaasan, leader of his clan. The powerful wizard saves Bodvar, but the wise northlander is wary of the mage's mysterious magic, and rightfully so. And as the Vaasans take up the ''[[darksword]]s'' crafted by the archmage to defend themselves against annihilation, the clan enters into a dark bond with Shade Enclave.
