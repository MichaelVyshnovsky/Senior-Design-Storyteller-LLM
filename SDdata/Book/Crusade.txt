''[[Yamun Khahan]] and his mighty [[Tuigan Horde|barbarian army]] have turned their sights on the civilized western nations of the [[Forgotten Realms]]. Only one man, King [[Azoun IV|Azoun]] of [[Cormyr]], has the courage and the strength to bring the western factions together and forge a crusading army powerful enough to challenge the [[Tuigan]] horsemen. Together with the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of the [[Earthfast Mountains]], the crusaders make their stand against the rampaging horde. But King Azoun hasn't reckoned that the price of saving the west might be high—perhaps even the life of his beloved [[Alusair Obarskyr|daughter]].''|}}

==Summary==
[[Azoun Obarskyr IV|King Azoun Obarskyr IV]] of [[Cormyr]] calls a council of the nearby realms of [[Faerûn]] to organize a crusade against the [[Tuigan]] invaders. The [[Dwarf|dwarven]] king [[Torg mac Cei]] of [[Earthfast]] agrees to join the crusade, along with the cities of [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Tantras]], and [[Hillsfar]]. [[Sembia]] funds transport and hires mercenaries, and the [[Dalelands]] agree to send soldiers on the condition that the [[Zhentarim]] do the same. The Zhentarim agree to send soldiers on the condition that Cormyr leaves the [[Darkhold]] alone for the period of a year. The trappers guild is unhappy with the war, and a disgruntled member tries to assassinate Azoun with a fireball, but fails. 

Among the volunteers to join the crusade are a fletcher named Razor John and two adventurers, Malmondes of [[Suzail]] and Kiri Trollslayer. Azoun discovers his runaway daughter [[Alusair Obarskyr]] is among the dwarven army as a military advisor. Malmondes kills a man in a barfight and is hanged. The Alliance of the West fights a battle against the Tuigan, losing all their cavalry but driving the Tuigan back with the arrival of Torg and his dwarven army. 

They find a defensible spot and fight the Second Battle of the Golden Way. King Torg is killed by [[Yamun Khahan]], but King Azoun kills Yamun. The Tuigan survivors turn on each other, scattering into small armies and roving bands all across [[Thesk]]. The survivors of the Zhentarim army, nine hundred orc soldiers, set up an outpost in Thesk. Azoun sees the crusade's success as proof that Cormyr, the Sales, and Sembia should unite. Alusair agrees to return home to Azoun after she settles her remaining affairs from her time adventuring. Razor John and Kiri Trollslayer get married.
