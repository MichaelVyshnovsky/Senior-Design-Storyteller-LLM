'''''Alias Versus the Night Masks''''' was a book that recounted the conflict between [[Alias]] of the ''[[azure bonds|Azure Bonds]]'' and the notorious [[Night Masks]] of [[Westgate]] of [[1368 DR]], penned by [[Harpers|Harper]] agent [[Jamal]] the Thespian.<ref group="note">''Alias Versus the Night Masks'' was the in-universe version of the novel ''[[Masquerades]]'', penned by [[Jeff Grubb]] and [[Kate Novak]].

==Content==
The book recorded the events of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, when hero Alias and her "brother," [[saurial]] [[paladin]] [[Dragonbait]] visited Westgate and became entangled in plots of the city's criminal underbelly. The duo reunited with their former companion [[hin]] "[[bard]]" [[Olive Ruskettle]], [[Mintassan]] the Sage, and the book's author, Jamal the Thespian. Together, they ended the reign of the mysterious leader of the Night Masks, only known as the [[Faceless]] (in reality [[Victor Dhostar]]).

The book's foreword praised the heroes, proclaiming the love for Alias as the city's hero, but conceded that true evil could not be easily defeated when it has taken root. Jamal the Thespian stated that by the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a new Faceless rose to power, and the guild was resurgent once again. The author hopes that the book would inspire a new generation of heroes to follow in Alias' footsteps and root the Night Masks' evil out from Westgate's undercut - the [[Undergate]].

==History==
The book was written and published in 1370 DR, and its copies were available for sale at [[Mintassan's Mysteries]], a store of curios acquired from across the planes by Mintassan the Magnificent.
