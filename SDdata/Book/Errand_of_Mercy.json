        "mainbody": "Errand of Mercy by Roger E. Moore is the fourth novella in the Double Diamond Triangle Saga series.\nThe story continues immediately after the events of the Paladins, as Miltiades, Kern Desanea, Jacob, Trandon, and Kastonoph Nesher step through the gate that transported them from the Sargauth Level of Undermountain to somewhere in the Utter East. That \"somewhere\" turned out to be Eldrinpar, the capital of Doegan. As they arrived they were greeted by Ikavi Garkim, a Mar and the secretly telepathic Chamber of Councilors member and the emperor of Doegans right hand.\nThe greeting emissary guided the paladins though the trap-ridden halls of the Stone Arch vault, fighting mistrust and resistance form the new guests. The paladins agreed to being escorted to the palace to request help (or find the culprit) in retrieving the missing Eidola of Neverwinter. On their elephant ride to the palace, Garkim gave the guests a short, albeit unreliable, version of the regions history, culture, colonization and the Bloodforge Wars. Bloodforge was the reason the paladins come to the East, as the forges basal golems were the creatures that kidnapped Eidola. According to their guide, all of the Five Nations of the  Utter East had one of the bloodforges of their own, and possibly, the mysterious faction called the Fallen Temple, one of the five churches that came to Doegan from the Moonshae Isles during the colonization.\nThe paladins reached the palace and were given guest quarters to rest and clean themselves up. During the rest, a hulking man attacked the  paladins but was killed, meting into a goo similar to the apple butter from Waterdeep. This attack by a basal golem only made the paladins of Tyr mistrust their guests even further.\nDuring a welcoming meal, the paladins and Ikavi Garkim were invited to an audience with the emperor Aetheric III. To their surprise, they arrived to an empty throne room with emperors booming voice echoing in their minds. Eventually the paladins discovered the telepathic monstrosity in a giant water tank of the black poisonous liquid. The emperor shared with the paladins that the cost of use of the bloodforges was not just draining of the land and its people of life, but also altering their shapes. Aetheric III was altered the most due to his heavy bloodforge use, he resembled a giant aquatic creature with scaled tentacles, beautiful face, huge jet black eyes and rashed, damaged, rotting flesh. The emperor also told them that the bloodforges were created by the Mars ancestors to seal otherworldly forces and  influences on the region away and use of the artifacts weakened the barriers. The fish-creature revealed that Eidola was tased by the Fallen Temple, the temple that used to be that of Tyr, now also known as the Temple of the Broken Hammer. Aetheric III asked Miltiades, the groups leader for help against the common enemy and after a communion with his deity he agreed to destroy the enemies of Doegan.\nAfter the paladins departed, the emperor confined in his advisor Garkim, that yes, the paladins agreed to destroy the enemies of Doegan with their gods blessing, but that also included the emperor himself, the Fallen Temple, and the bloodforges. Ikavi Garkim was tasked to be ready to assassinate the newcomers if they move against the emperor.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \n •  •  • \n •  • \n • \n •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •"
