Prayers from the Faithful is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
Prayers from the Faithful details a number of holy books and relics of the Faer√ªnian pantheon, providing a collection of unique, lesser-known deities, their clerics, and the specific prayers, spells, and rituals associated with their worship.
The accessory also introduces a range of minor gods and goddesses who had not been deeply explored in previous publications. Each entry in Prayers from the Faithful details a specific deity, including their history, motivations, and the manner in which they interact with their followers.
The core of the accessory is its presentation of new spells and prayer rituals that reflect the unique aspects of each featured deity. These game mechanics allow players to access divine powers that are not only effective in gameplay but also rich in cultural and religious significance within the Realms. The spells and prayers are designed to be integrated seamlessly into the daily life of clerics and other divine spellcasters.
Prayers from the Faithful also includes suggestions on how Dungeon Masters can incorporate these new deities and their followers into existing campaigns, providing advice on creating quests, conflicts, and encounters that are themed around religious events or crises of faith.
