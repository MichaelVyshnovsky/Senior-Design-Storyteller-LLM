'''"Standard Delving Procedure"''' is a short story by [[Lisa Smedman]] included in the 2004 anthology ''[[Realms of the Dragons]]''. Characters from this short story would eventually appear in the novel ''[[The Gilded Rune]]'', published in 2012.

==Summary==
Two members of the [[Order of Delvers]], the elder [[Durin]] and the novice [[Frivaldi]], discover the lost [[dwarf]]-hold of [[Torunn's Forge]], once part of the ancient kingdom of [[Oghrann]]. The pair seek the [[Bane of Caeruleus]], a legendary weapon built by [[Torunn]] himself to slay the [[blue dragon]] [[Caeruleus]]. They come to learn that the Bane is a weapon of a different sort&mdash;a massive [[golem]], and that a band of [[dragonkin]] stalks the ruined hold.
