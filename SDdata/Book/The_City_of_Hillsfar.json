        "mainbody": "'''''The City of Hillsfar''''' was a guidebook for the city of [[Hillsfar]], penned by a [[Harper]] agent from [[Cormanthor]], [[Dyrlar Graywinter]] sometime before [[1373 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''[[Zhentil Keep]]? Hillsfar? Who can tell which is the lesser of two evils?''|A [[Moonsea]] saying}}",
        "Contents": "The book did not mince words, as the author openly called the city of Hillsfar being as evil, if not a greater evil, than the infamous Zhentil Keep, the home of the [[Black Network]]. The book warned travelers of the atrocities committed by Hillsfar against non-[[human]]s. Many were arrested and thrown into the [[Hillsfar Arena]] to fight for their lives. Dyrlar Graywinter also warned visitors of Hillsfar's ruler - [[Maalthiir]] the tyrant, who only cared for growing the city's trade and tortured prisoners for fun. Another evil of Hillsfar were the [[Red Plumes]]. The book said that Maalthiir's private army harassed, robbed, and murdered goodly folk if not bribed.\n\n''The City of Hillsfar'' briefly touched on the city's history, describing the rulers that preceded Maalthiir â€“ a joint council of humans, [[half-elves]], and [[tel-quessir]] of the [[Elven Court]], and how the tyrant took over the council and claimed absolute power in Hillsfar.\n\nFinally, the book concluded that the city of Hillsfar was much more treacherous among the evils of the Moonsea as, unlike the dreaded Zhentil Keep, Hillsfar did not admit its evil deeds.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, copies of the ''The City of Hillsfar'' could be found in all major cities of the [[Moonsea]] region."
