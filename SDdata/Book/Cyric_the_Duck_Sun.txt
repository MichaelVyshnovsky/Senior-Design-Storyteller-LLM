'''''Cyric the Duck Sun''''' was a comedic play performed in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The play was performed at the [[Riverbank Theater]] following the destruction of the city in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. It depicted [[Cyric]] as a sinister waterfowl attempting to take control of a pond. The play was extremely popular with the populace of Zhentil Keep, whose faith in the Dark Sun was greatly diminished following the razing of the city. Cyric's clergy were outraged but could do little given their minority.
