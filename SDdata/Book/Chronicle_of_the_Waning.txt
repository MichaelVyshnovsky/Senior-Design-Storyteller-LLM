The '''''Chronicle of the Waning''''' was a [[book]] written in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] by [[Coton]], Patriarch of [[Qotal]], that described the events surrounding the coming of the [[Golden Legion]] to [[Maztica]] and the fall of several Maztican civilizations, including [[Nexal]].

==History==
Coton was gifted by his god with prophetic knowledge about the 'Waning' that was to come to Maztican civilization, but he was bound by a vow of silence not to speak his knowledge to anyone else. This included the leaders of Nexal, who could have used this knowledge to avert the end of their power. He thus wrote the ''Chronicle of the Waning'' in order to observe and record what he saw, even though he could not be a participant in what was going to happen.

==Content==
The Chronicle included information on the religious history of Maztica related to how Qotal, a benevolent god, had been supplanted by the 'younger gods' who demanded [[human]] sacrifice. It included the prophetic knowledge and visions given by Qotal to Coton about how the destinies of certain individuals, such as [[Erixitl]] of [[Palul]], Captain-General [[Cordell]], and Captain [[Halloran]] of the Golden Legion were going to bring about this 'Waning'. The Chronicle, which was written over the course of more than a decade, also included reported details about the events that were occurring while it was written, such as the decisions made by [[Naltecona]] after the arrival of 'the strangers.'<ref>
