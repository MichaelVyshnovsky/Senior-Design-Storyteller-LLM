Under Fallen Stars is the second book in The Threat from the Sea trilogy by Mel Odom.
Flyss, a triton spy, is captured by the morkoth Khorrch and Vurgrom, who interrogate him and learn that Iakhovass is in Myth Nantar. 
Iakhovas kills Huaanton and declares himself king of the sahuagin. 
Taranath Reefglamor, a sea elven high mage in Serôs, performs a divination spell on Iakhovas despite the warnings of his subordinate Pharom Ildacer, Taranath sees Pacys and a vision of the sea burning. 
In Baldurs Gate, Jherek Wolfs-get meets Khlinat Ironeater, a dwarven sailor, shortly before Iakhovas’s forces, including Jherek’s father, Bloody Falkane, attack the city. During the battle, Iakhovas retrieves an item from Vurgrom and a ship in a bottle from a corpse, and Khlinat retrieves a wagon of smoke powder from the merchant Felogyr Sonshal, detonating it in the harbor to cause concussive waves that stun and kill the sahuagin and sea creatures. Khlinat is injured in the blast, but is mysteriously healed, and Pacys, also present in the city, meets Jherek and becomes convinced he is the hero of his song. After the attack, Pacys notices Khlinat is a harper, Jherek is given a pearl by a priest of Lathander who claims he foresaw the moment, and Falkane kisses Laaqueel.
Jherek reunites with Sabyna and the two are captured by Vurgrom, who also captures the crew of the Breeze Runner and steals the ship. Khlinat joins with Pacys, who opens a portal through a mermaid mirror in the High House of Wonders and steps through to Gulthmere Forest, where they meet Taareen, a sea elf. Iakhovas convinces the sahuagin to travel to the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
The crew of the Breeze Runner escape their imprisonment, but Vurgrom escapes with the pearl disk, so Jherek sets off in pursuit along with Sabyna and Glawinn, a paladin of Lathander who happened upon them. Iakhovas shatters the ship-in-a-bottle he got from Baldurs Gate, releasing the mudship Tarjana, a legendary magical fortress-ship that can sail over land or below the sea.
Jherek, Sabyna, and Glawinn attack Vugrom in Westgate, but he escapes, so they join with Azla, captain of the Black Champion and rival pirate to Vurgrom. They find Vurgrom as he uses the disk to open a magical passage through the volcanic fault line connecting Arnrock and the Ship of the Gods, causing a volcanic eruption as Iakhovas uses the passage to bring a sahuagin army to the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
In the chaos of the eruption, Vurgrom’s pirates attack the Black Champion, but the unknown voice that has spoken to Jherek reappears and causes a miraculous wind that saves the ship. Jaded by recent events, Jherek abandons his faith in Ilmater and joins the crew of the Black Champion. The eruption devastates the sahuagin of the Alamber Sea, but Iakhovas rallies the survivors with a promise to destroy the Sharksbane Wall that keeps them separated from the rest of Seros.
