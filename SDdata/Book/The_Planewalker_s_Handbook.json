These chapters cover topics such as the cosmology of the multiverse, the various planes of existence and their inhabitants, magical portals and planar gateways, planar magic, and the equipment and tools necessary for successful planar travel.\n\nIn addition to providing new rules and mechanics for planar travel and adventure, ''The Planewalker's Handbook'' also introduces new character classes, spells, magical items, and other content specifically tailored to the multiverse of the game. The book also includes a variety of adventure hooks and plot seeds that can be used by Dungeon Masters to create planar adventures for their players.\n\nOverall, ''The Planewalker's Handbook'' is a comprehensive guide to the multiverse of the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' game, providing players and Dungeon Masters with a wealth of new content and mechanics to explore and use in their campaigns.",
