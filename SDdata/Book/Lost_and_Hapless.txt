'''''Lost and Hapless''''' was a once popular old ballad from the [[Dragon Reach]], penned long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its title eventually became a common [[Faer√ªn]]ean expression for "hopelessly wandering in the trackless wilds."

==Contents==
The tile of ''Lost and Hapless'' was a play on the name of the [[Hap Hills]], where the [[Haptooth Hill]] was located in the northeastern part of the [[Dun Hills]] in the [[Dalelands]].
