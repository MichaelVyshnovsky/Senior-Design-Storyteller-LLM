century DR
Lost and Hapless was a once popular old ballad from the Dragon Reach, penned long before the 14 century DR. Its title eventually became a common Faer√ªnean expression for "hopelessly wandering in the trackless wilds."
The tile of Lost and Hapless was a play on the name of the Hap Hills, where the Haptooth Hill was located in the northeastern part of the Dun Hills in the Dalelands.
