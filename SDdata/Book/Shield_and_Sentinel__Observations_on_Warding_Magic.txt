The '''''Shield and Sentinel: Observations on Warding Magic''''' was a well-known book on magecraft and of particular interest to novice wizards. It was written by [[Alais Maeraphym]], whom [[Elminster]] considered to be a warm and affectionate womanâ€”a trait that found its way into this book's prose as well.

==Contents==
The book was considered mandatory reading for all practitioners of magic in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. While it held no [[spell]]s, it was well-written and provided its readers with half-spells and incantations that enabled a better execution of popular castings.

==Availability==
Due to its value, [[thieves' guild]]s and cabals would often pilfer it on sight.

A copy of the tome was found by [[Elminster]] in [[Candlekeep]] in the {{yearlinkName|1487}}.
