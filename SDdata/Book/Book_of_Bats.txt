The '''''Book of Bats''''' was an ancient [[spellbook]] of uncertain origin that contained a number of uncommon [[arcane]] and [[divine magic|divine]] [[spell]]s.

==Description==
This was a tall and narrow tome, measuring approximately three handwidths wide and nine handwidths tall. All 22 pages were made from polished [[electrum]] and these were etched and stamped with the scripts and symbols of spell-craft, with each page containing a different spell. The front and rear covers of the book were plates made of sealed and blackened [[oak]] and these bound with the tattered leathery hides and wings of real [[bat]]s of large size, many of which still contained their claws. These of course gave it a gruesome appearance.

==History==
The origin and creator of the ''Book of Bats'' were unknown. Though the book held spells from the early [[wizard]]s [[Beltyn]] and [[Shaeroon]], it was possibly put together quite some time after their deaths. The first recorded sighting of the ''Book of Bats'' was in [[Calimshan]] around [[1147 DR]], where it was a part of a satrap's treasures.This was "some two hundred and ten winters ago" from an assumed date of 1357 for ''The Magister''.

After that, the book changed hands surprisingly many times over its history, often by thievery or force as one mage or minor ruler after killed the prior owner.

At one point, the merchant [[Chulu Thall]] of [[Ithmong]] somehow acquired the ''Book of Bats'' and sold it to the [[mage]] [[Khondall Sszundar]]. But he had it but briefly before an unknown enemy dispatched [[demon]]s that demolished his tower, and the tome was lost. Shortly after, the ''Book of Bats'' resurfaced in [[Innarlith]], then was swiftly stolen.

''Circa'' [[1357]] DR, the [[archmage]] [[Malharduu]] apparently purchased the tome and made arrangements to have it shipped to [[Tashluta]]. However, in summer, the ship carrying the book was looted by thieves before it could leave the dock in [[Calimport]]. The fate of the book remained unknown.This was "last summer". It's unclear if this is summer of 1356, of 1357, or of some other year.

==Powers==
Khondall was able to catalog the tome's spells while it was under his care. The ''Book of Bats'' contained the following spells:
:''[[censure]]'' &bull; ''[[hold vapor]]'' &bull; ''[[feign death]]'' &bull; ''[[protection from good|protection from good 10' radius]]'' &bull; ''[[slow]]'' &bull; ''[[Beltyn's burning blood]]'' &bull; ''[[dimension door]]'' &bull; ''[[fear]]'' &bull; ''[[polymorph other]]'' &bull; ''[[wall of fire]]'' &bull; ''[[animate dead]]'' &bull; ''[[cloudkill]]'' &bull; ''[[cone of cold]]'' &bull; ''[[feeblemind]]'' &bull; ''[[telekinesis]]'' &bull; ''[[wall of iron]]'' &bull; ''[[anti-magic shell]]'' &bull; ''[[death spell]]'' &bull; ''[[geas]]'' &bull; ''[[invisible stalker]]'' &bull; ''[[project image]]'' &bull; ''[[blade of doom]]'' (here called ''Shaeroon's scimitar'').
