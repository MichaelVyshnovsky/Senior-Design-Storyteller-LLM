'''''Kinslayer''''' was an epic from the ancient kingdom of [[Nog]] in [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
This epic described the tragic tale of [[Kagemni]], the first king of [[Ysawis]], and his brother, the [[necromancer]] [[Diarbekir]]. It described how Kagemni used the blade to slay a number of deceitful [[genie]]s who placed a [[curse]] on the blade with their dying screams, and how that curse would lead the king to slay his brother by mistake.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Jade Palace of the Necromancers|Jade Palace]] in [[Ysawis]] notably had a copy of ''Kinslayer'' housed within the Queen's study, for [[Zaribel]] was a scholar of Nog literature.
