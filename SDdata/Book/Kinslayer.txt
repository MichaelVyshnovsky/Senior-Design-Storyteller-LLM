Kinslayer was an epic from the ancient kingdom of Nog in Zakhara.
This epic described the tragic tale of Kagemni, the first king of Ysawis, and his brother, the necromancer Diarbekir. It described how Kagemni used the blade to slay a number of deceitful genies who placed a curse on the blade with their dying screams, and how that curse would lead the king to slay his brother by mistake.
In the 14 century DR, the Jade Palace in Ysawis notably had a copy of Kinslayer housed within the Queens study, for Zaribel was a scholar of Nog literature.
