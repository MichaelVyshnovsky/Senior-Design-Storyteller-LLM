        "Content": "The book of the ''Ballad of Daen Winterbrush'' was old and thickly covered in dust. The [[ink]] on its pages was fading with age, and parchment was ragged with use. The entire tome consisted of lyrics and sheet music for the said ballad and detailed creative journey of Daen Winterbrush, struggling to create the melody, pen the music that fit the tale.\n\nThe bard's name was scribbled on the inside of the book's cover.",
        "History": "Written but unfinished book, long before 1281 DR, Daen Winterbrush's work traveled across the [[Sea of Swords]] and somehow ended up in the library in the [[Temple of the Forgotten God]] in the [[Dragon's Eye]], inhabited by [[druid]] cultists. The book was tethered to the restless spirit of long-dead Daen Winterbrush, tortured by his unfinished masterpiece. The book waited for a skilled [[human]] or [[half-elf]] bard to come across it, finishing Daen's life's work. If this ever came to pass, the dead bard's [[ghost]] revealed himself to the person who finished and masterfully performed the song. As a reward, the spirit could further enchant [[the Sword of Myrloch Vale]], imbuing it with charisma enchantment what magically filled the wielder's mind with deep knowledge of lore and legends."
