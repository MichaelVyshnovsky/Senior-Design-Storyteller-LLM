'''The Spectral Blaze''' by [[Richard Lee Byers]] is the third novel set in the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon (series)|Brotherhood of the Griffon]] series.

{{quote|''[[Aoth Fezim|Aoth]] and the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] have succeeded in rescuing [[Tchazzar]], the lost king of [[Chessenta]] and a formidable [[red dragon]], and are rewarded with a contract to aid in his war with a powerful [[dracolich]]. But the more Aoth sees of the war, the more suspicious he becomes that the Brotherhood may be just a pawn in a cutthroat draconic game that puts whole kingdoms at riskâ€”a game played for stakes of gold and blood. And the more he sees the game play out, the more he realizes that he will have to become a player in this most dangerous of games if he wants the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]] to remain free.''}}
