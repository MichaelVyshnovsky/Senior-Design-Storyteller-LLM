'''''Swords of the Daimyo''''' is an adventure for AD&D 1{{st}} edition ruleset. It is part of the ''Oriental Adventures'' campaign setting and is set in [[Kozakura]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

{{Quote|''From the log of the ''Leaping Dolphin'':''

''"110th Day: The gale nae stops for twa days. My ship is driven before it and the magus is as helpless as a wee babe. [[Akito]] names the winds tai-fun in his heathen tongue&hellip;"''

''Drawn by the lure of adventure and riches, a crew of seamen sails valiantly into uncharted seas. In the squalid dens of the port districts, tales hint at a land of untold riches across the waves. But getting there is only the beginning.''

''Across the waters lies Kozakura, a land of mystery and danger. There you will discover new cultures, strange values, secret powers, and fabulous terrors. For Kozakura is a land of Oriental Adventures.''

''Swords of the Daimyo is the first module designed for use with the AD&D [[Oriental Adventures]] rule book. Swords of the Daimyo includes descriptions and maps of the island of Kozakura, detailed information and maps of Miyama Province of Kozakura, and a series of adventures to introduce old and new player characters to the intrigues of the Orient.''}}

==Description==
''Swords of the Daimyo'' was written by [[David "Zeb" Cook]] with [[Kelley Foote]] and published by TSR in 1986, and included a thirty two page gazetteer called ''Province Book of Miyama'' and a thirty two page "Adventure Book", with a large color map and an outer folder. The module featured cover and interior art by [[Jeff Easley]]. It was the first module made for use with ''Oriental Adventures''. The Province book describes the Eastern continent of [[Kara-Tur]], [[Miyama Province]], and the island of Kozakura. The module includes a historical timeline for Kozakura, as well as new monsters.

''Swords of the Daimyo'' provides an overview of the politics and climate of the lands of [[Kozakura]]. After a brief overview of Kozakura, the pack focuses on the province of [[Miyama]], and its government, samurai families, temples and landholdings. The package also includes a list of names and maps of various residences found in the province. It gives the continent map of the world presented in the original ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'', and details an entire province and gives a background for one of the five major divisions of the world.

''Swords of the Daimyo'' contains three adventures. The first adventure is for player characters (PCs) levels 6–10, and takes the characters on a sea voyage to Kozakura. The adventure includes a system for calculating the chances of a crew mutiny. When the PCs arrive in Kozakura, the module states that "it is likely that one or more will be permanently slain", with the intention of replacing said characters with new local characters. The other two adventures in the module are designed for ''Oriental Adventures'' characters, and revolve around the nefarious activities of the [[sohei]] (militant clerics) of the [[Black Temple]]. One of these adventures involves the defense of a village against bandits, and the other is a mission to take out the organizer of the bandits. These two adventures form a linked package, separated by time and a few character levels.
