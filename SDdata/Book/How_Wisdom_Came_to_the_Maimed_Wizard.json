        "Summary": "[[Eirhaun Sooundaeril]], the eponymous Maimed Wizard, wonders about the fate of the [[spellfire]] wielder [[Shandril Shessair]] on [[Flamerule 28]], a week after her doom. He remembers before her supposed death, a deflected torrent of her spellfire bounced from [[Hesperdan]]'s wards and tore his hideout to shreds. As a watchman against internal [[Zhentarim]] betrayals, he is naturally suspicious that she may actually not be dead as reported: the seekers after spellfire may have not looked too closely, simply not to be sent after her again. He decides to try scrying on her personally in order to verify.\n\nHis prying reveals [[Narm Tamaraith]] to him, however briefly, as [[Alustriel Silverhand]] shuts down his magic and puts Narm to sleep. He comes to the conclusion the [[Seven Sisters]] transformed Shandril into the shape of her husband, and laid her mind into sleep as a measure against her running wild and to thwart any seekers after her.\n\nResolving to snatch spellfire for himself, he prepares a [[spellweb]] and attempts to teleport her to himself. Instead, the Seven Sisters, one by one, appear at his hideout, all of them wielding spellfire. When they warn him he's about to be slain by it, he attacks them; rather than striking back at him with spellfire, his own spells rebound from the spellfire-wielding Seven and into him.\n\nHe wakes some time later, blind, limbless and in pain, after having been found by Zhentarim apprenticing under Hesperdan, the Old Man of the Zhentarim. Hesperdan gives him a healing potion which regenerates him slowly and asks him how he came to be in such dire shape; Eirhaun explains that spellfire is not to be sought after. Hesperdan seems satisfied by this answer, and walks away. For a moment, Eirhaun wonders why the man smells so much like familiar pipesmoke.",
