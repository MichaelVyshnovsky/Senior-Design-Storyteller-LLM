The '''''Hegredathas''''' was the most well-known written history of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], published some time before [[1372 DR]].

The ''Hegredathas'' related the story that the master dwarven builder [[Iirikos Stoneshoulder]] was commissioned by an [[Illuskan]] [[wizard]] named [[Silifrey the Spraystrider]] to build the [[Granite Tower (Shining Falls)|Granite Tower]]. However, Silifrey was rumored to practice dark [[magic]] and Iirikos's elven friends warned and pleaded with him not to. Ignoring them, leaving them bewildered by his choice, Iirikos built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned [[elemental]]s. But he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed.
