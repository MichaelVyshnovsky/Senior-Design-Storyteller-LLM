For in the shadows a cunning cabal of wizards is watching, intent on hunting Chosen–mortals blessed by the gods.  These wizards know something mere commoners do not: Long-forgotten gods have begun to stir.  Long-lost lands have begun to tremble.  The world around them is about to change.  And these wizards will do whatever it takes to turn the coming chaos to their advantage.\n\nIn this first book of the six-book Sundering series, ''New York Times'' best-selling author R.A. Salvatore launches a major world-shaping event that will revive old favorites, intoduce new complications, and move his signature hero Drizzt into a restored era of the Forgotten Realms.\n|-\n|": "== [[The Godborn|''The Godborn'']] ===",
