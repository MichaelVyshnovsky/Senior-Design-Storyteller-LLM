{{quote|''Please do not talk about this matter with anyone. I really do not want my personal life to become a spectacle for those bloodthirsty leeches that work for the Trumpeter. I value my privacy.''|[[Glandryl Moonbow]]{{Cite organized play/LC/Everything Dies|5}}}}

==Contents==
Each issue had several set columns run by dedicated editors. The Editor-in-Chief [[Fred Faber]] often took charge of hot news and general direction of the broadsheet, [[Clio Hesperin]] was the editor who curated and wrote the ''City News'' section, and the Society Editor, "Jackie" [[Jacinth Moonspring]], ran the section dedicated to celebrities, nobility, and other individuals of note and their proclivities, social announcements, and gossips. Only these three columns were regular content. Much other coverage consisted of announcements, advertisements, classifieds, public letters, and other miscellaneous articles.{{Cite trumpeter/1-1|1}}

==Availability==
''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter'' was often distributed via street hawker children who sold the latest issues for two [[copper]] [[coin|pieces]], with a customary tip of 50 [[gp]] among the adventuring population.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Deluge|3}}

==History==
In [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, a ''Trumpeter'' clerk – [[Myra Miller]], received a mention in that month's issue of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter''. After the offices of the gazette were ransacked and torched (evidently by [[Talassan]]s) while the staff was away at the local printer's shop, Myra showed quick thinking and managed to save the organization's documents from being destroyed. Despite Myra Miller's best efforts, all reports of the summer meteor crisis of the {{YearlinkName|1367}} were lost.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, one of the casualties in the recent gang war was [[Borrek Halloway]], a journalist who worked for ''The Trumpeter's'' ninth shift editor [[Damien Blackthorn]]. Borrek was just the latest among a series of grizzly killings, and a group of the Living City adventurers answered a summoning from the editor and accepted his contract to uncover the truth behind the victim's death. Borrek's killing could've been the result of his work on such investigative pieces as ''Corruption in the City Government'', ''Bribery in the City Watch'', ''Merchant's Guild Inflating Prices'', and ''Organized Criminal Guilds: Parasites of Society''.

In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, ''The Trumpeter's'' best investigative reporter, Tara Strongquill, fell victim to a kidnapping by the notorious chaos agent named [[Locaath Blackmanta]]. The kidnapping was a stunt aimed to sew panic in Ravens Bluff. The ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter'' hired a band of adventurers to find the culprit and rescue the unlucky supporter.{{Cite organized play/LC/News of the World|31}}

==Rumors & Legends==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Bellona Helmguard]] of [[Bellona's Baths]] claimed that, according to the brother of a man who worked at the [[Beholder's Eye]], the editor-in-chief of ''The Trumpeter'' was a [[vampire]], explaining his night shift work.{{Cite organized play/LC/After the Ball is Over|14}}
