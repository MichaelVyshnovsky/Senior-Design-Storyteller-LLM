        "mainbody": "The book of Thoth was tome written by an incarnation of Thoth, the scribe and historian of the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThis large tome was bound in leather. It was fixed with a lock shaped like a baboons head.\nThe book of Thoth could mimic the legend lore spell once per day on any item placed upon its cover. The book would open to a page that revealed the applicable information about the item, closing and locking itself only after the entry was read.\nIf the book was forced open by any means all that would be found would be blank pages and the books magic would be lost forever."
