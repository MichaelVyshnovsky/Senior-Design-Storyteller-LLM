'''''Starfall Pool''''' was a ballad by an unknown composer about the [[Starfall Pool|glade]] and [[Starfall Pool (pond)|pond]] of the same name located north of [[Silverymoon]] just past the edge of the [[Moonwood]]. It described a place of restful healing, a dancing [[dryad]], and strange dreams. This song was famous throughout [[Luruar]] by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite dragon/296/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Starfall Pool|74}}

==Contents==
The ballad was long, and there were many versions. It usually went on to describe the healing of mind and body or meeting fair folk, [[humans]] and [[half-elves]], in deep dreams of joyous recreation, courtship, or humorous exploits, but other versions hinted at dark magic with a [[siren]]'s lure, or an evil [[wizard]] that threatened the glade or the dryad. But each verse was followed by the well-known refrain:
{{Quote|
There is a place in the deep green wood<br />
Where the dryad [[Olsheirie]] dwells<br />
Dancing where a keep once stood<br />
Girt with magic of chiming bells.<br />
<br />Refrain:<br />
Though to stray so deep is the act of a fool<br />
I regret no stride toward Starfall Pool.<br />
<br />
Came I there by happy chance<br />
And there I'll thither go again<br />
To dream more dreams of fair romance<br />
For by the pool I know no pain.<br />
<br />(Refrain)<br /><br />
Trees old and green, dark and still<br />
Ring 'round an oak as old as time<br />
Fall down keep and rise up hill<br />
Rest and hear the dryad rhyme.<br />
<br />(Refrain)<br /><br />
Kindled by the dying embers<br />
Of a fire that must not stay<br />
Magic soars and then remembers<br />
Warding me again away.<br />
<br />(Refrain)<br /><br />
Back I'll go when I am able<br />
Though long rides may lie between<br />
Peace again upon my table<br />
Lying on the moss so green.
