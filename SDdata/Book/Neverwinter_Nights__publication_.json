        "mainbody": "Neverwinter Nights was a serialized chapbook typically published every six to ten days in Neverwinter.\nNeverwinter Nights was a periodical that covered topics of interest for the Neverwintian high society culture, arts, events, reviews of musical, theater, and oratorical performances, and of course, gossip. The publication followed a lax schedule, releasing regular issues and printing \"special issues\" if something sudden of note happened in the city. Neverwinter Nights kept its readers informed of famous musicians visits, new fanciful establishments, and upcoming book releases. Arguably, the Neverwinter Nights gossip section was the most popular, covering high society feuds, disgraceful occurrences, scandals, bans, and even murders and pregnancies. As of the , Neverwinter Nights was edited and published by Lundrago Mursimmur."
