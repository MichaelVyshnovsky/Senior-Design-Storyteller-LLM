        "Description": "This tome was a thick book whose cover was made from the [[dragonhide|underbelly hide]] of a [[red dragon]]. Bound within the book was a total of twelve thick, black leather pages. Attached to each of these pages was a single, rune-inscribed metal disk, evocative of a seal like one might find on a door or urn.\n\nOriginally all twelve of these seals were made made of [[gold]] and quite shiny, but over time they lost their luster, became charred, and turned into lead.",
        "Powers": "The runes etched on each seal within the ''Tome of Twelve Seals'' was a [[command word]] that activated their seal's effect. The golden seals, when activated, would conjure one of many types of monster as if by a ''[[summon monster]]'' [[spell]].\n\nThe first seal would conjure an [[air elemental]], the second would conjure a [[fire elemental]], the fourth would conjure an [[earth elemental]], the fifth would conjure a [[dragon horse]], the eighth would conjure a [[gibbering mouther]], the ninth would conjure a [[jann]], and the tenth would conjure a [[marid]]. Those pages not mentioned had lost their magic and would not conjure anything.\n\nUpon activating one of these seals, they would unleash a blinding flash and transform into lead, becoming inert.\n{| class=\"article-table\"\n|+Seals and Statuses over Time\n!Seal #\n!Conjures\n!Known Inert on\n|-\n|1st\n|[[air elemental]]\n|\n|-\n|2nd\n|[[fire elemental]]\n|\n|-\n|3rd\n|\n|[[1358 DR]]\n|-\n|4th\n|[[earth elemental]]\n|\n|-\n|5th\n|[[dragon horse]]\n|[[1372 DR]]\n|-\n|6th\n|\n|[[1358 DR]]\n|-\n|7th\n|\n|[[1358 DR]]\n|-\n|8th\n|[[gibbering mouther]]\n|\n|-\n|9th\n|[[Janni|jann]]\n|\n|-\n|10th\n|[[marid]]\n|[[1372 DR]]\n|-\n|11th\n|\n|[[1358 DR]]\n|-\n|12th\n|\n|[[1358 DR]]\n|}",
