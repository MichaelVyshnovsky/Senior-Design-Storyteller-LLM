        "Summary": "On a night when the fog phenomenon known as The Veil was creeping heavily into Ravens Bluff, Romilys Ganelon, a sergeant in the City Guard and a trusted aide of the Chief Constable with a past history of burglary, steals a prized bronze ''horn of Valhalla'' belonging to Lord Marshal Gaius Varro. Romilys is spotted entering the sewers, but the guardsmen are unable to effectively pursue him, being that they are all spread out in stations designated for nights of heavy Veil activity. Ten minutes later a desperate Rolf Sunriver runs into the barracks of the Night Watch and enlists the aid of those inside to capture Romilys.\n\nShowing them a partial map of the sewers, the Chief Constable explains that Romilys is also carrying a ''ring of free action'' and a ''skeleton key'', giving him an even greater chance of escaping. He estimates that the watchmen have roughly twenty minutes to determine Romilys's path and get to his expected exit ahead of him. Before they depart, Rolf hands the watchmen a ''ring of spell storing'' that Gaius had loaned him, holding only the spell ''invisibility, 10' radius''. He recommends they utilize it to set up an ambush at his expected exit. When the ambush eventually kicks off, Romilys tries to fight his way out and uses the ''horn of Valhalla'' to conjure a group of berserkers to fight for him.",
