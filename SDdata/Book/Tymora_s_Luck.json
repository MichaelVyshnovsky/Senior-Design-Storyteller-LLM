        "mainbody": "Tymoras Luck, by Kate Novak and Jeff Grubb, is the third and final novel in The Lost Gods trilogy.\nLathander, upset when Chauntea rebuffs his advances, is approached by Iyachtu Xvim in the guise of [https//dragonlance.fandom.com/wiki/Sirrion Sirrion of the Flowering Flame], who offers to combine Tymora and Beshaba back into Tyche. In truth, Xvim plans to absorb both goddesses. They begin draining power from both goddesses. \nIn Sigil, Joel and Jas meet Emilo Haversack, a Kender who arrived in the city after jumping into an unstable vortex. The deity Fizban granted him ability to remain imperceptible unless he speaks or is introduced. \nJas is attacked by the church of Xvim, so she agrees to go to Finder’s domain to remove the dark stalker she believes was forced on her. They arrive in Fermata, where Finder realizes that Jas is not actually a dark stalker, she just has the ability to shapeshift, which is controlled by her emotions. \nJas agrees to go to Brightwater to ask for Tymora’s help, despite her grudge from being granted her wings by Tymora long ago. While pretending to remove the dark stalker, Tymora falls unconscious. \nGood and bad luck fluctuate wildly across the Realms. \nBecause Tymora said “Beshaba” before falling, Joel, Emilo and Jas go to the Abyss, where they learn Beshaba is missing too. They then go to Gehenna, meeting up with Holly Harrowslough and Walindra, who has devoted herself to worshiping Beshaba and raised an army to reclaim her from Xvim’s fortress. Walidra dies, but they rescue Beshaba and are taking her to the Spire on the Outlands when Holly lets Lathander abduct her. Xvim reveals himself, Holly refuses to obey Lathander’s command to combine the goddesses against their will, and the fusion is used to reform the Finders Stone. The goddesses escape, and Beshaba curses Lathander with bad luck.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPlanes\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \nPlanets\n • \nRegions\n • \n •  •  •  •  •  • \nSettlements\n •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nBuildings & Sites\n •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nWilderness\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nOther\nVegetation\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nGems & Materials\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nWorks\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nGames\n •  •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •"
