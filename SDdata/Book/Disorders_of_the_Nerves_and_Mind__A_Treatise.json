        "mainbody": "'''''Disorders of the Nerves and Mind: A Treatise''''' was a medical [[book]] that detailed various psychological and neurological ailments, their diagnoses, and related treatment plans, penned by the [[cleric]]-[[physician]] named [[Glenne Earl Mack]].",
        "Content": "One case study included in ''Disorders of the Nerves and Mind'' shared the story of a woman, nicknamed \"R,\" who was troubled by her husband, nicknamed \"B,\" and his temper. According to the woman, just three months earlier, \"B\" was afflicted by restless dreams and night sweats. The husband screamed in his sleep about bearing the \"mark of chaos.\" Two months before the physician's visit, \"B\" began calling himself [[Sarveok]]. And just a month before, \"B\" became obsessed with the throne he claimed he was destined to sit upon.\n\nGlenne Earl Mack paid the couple's farmhouse a visit and met \"B.\" The man simply sat at the farmers' table, holding a book close to his chest. Being a cleric as well as a physician, Glenne detected no possession, no magical influences, nor ''[[curse]]''. When the cleric illuminated the afflicted man's face with her [[candle]], \"B\" cried out, brandishing the book: \"The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise!\" The cleric managed to grab the book and tossed it into the farmhouse's hearth. To the cleric's surprise, the tome burst into black flames and burned into ash. The book left behind nothing but a small scrap of [[paper]] that read: \"He foresaw his coming death and seeded his essence across the land.\"\n\nWith the book gone, \"B\" seemingly woke from a nightmare but had no memories of the tome nor claiming to be Sarevok. In the aftermath of the incident, Glenne Earl Mack diagnosed \"B\" with an unspecified neurotic enthrallment and prescribed him a suspension of [[garlic]] and [[drace]] to be taken orally twice per day.",
        "History": "A copy of ''Disorders of the Nerves and Mind'' could be found in the libraries of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
