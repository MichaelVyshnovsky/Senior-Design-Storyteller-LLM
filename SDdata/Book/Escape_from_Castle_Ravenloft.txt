'''''Escape from Castle Ravenloft''''' is a gamebook in the ''[[Endless Quest]]'' series published in September 2019. It  ties in to the adventure ''[[Curse of Strahd]]'' and focuses on the [[cleric]] class.

{{Quote|'''Welcome to the Forgotten Realms Endless Quest books, where you don’t just read a fantastic tale. You become the hero — and choose your own fate.'''

You have entered the mist-shrouded realm of Ravenloft, where you attract the attention of Count Strahd, who decides to make you one of his vampire spawn. After awakening to find yourself alone within the walls of Castle Ravenloft, you must figure out how to escape the vampire lord’s Gothic lair before you are doomed to become his slave for all time. Keep your wits about you, cleric}}
