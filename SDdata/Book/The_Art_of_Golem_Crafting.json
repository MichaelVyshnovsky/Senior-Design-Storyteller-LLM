        "mainbody": "'''''The Art of Golem Crafting''''' was a unique unpublished manuscript penned by [[Ikathilo]] of [[Gond]] from [[the Purple Portals]] of [[Melvaunt]].",
        "Contents": "''The Art of Golem Crafting'' was considered a seminal piece of research on the topic of [[golem]]-making, a masterwork of research, skill, and determination so common among Ikathilo's fellow [[artificer]]s of Gond. This unassuming manuscript held the core of the modern understanding of advanced golem construction of [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "History": "Ikathilo's prolific career in pursuit of knowledge was legendary. He was renowned for his talent and the secrecy of his research. At some point in his life, he established a hidden workshop in the plane of [[Mechanus]], where he continued perfecting his creations. Sometime before [[1373 DR]], Ikathilo died and left behind his lab and unfinished [[construct]]s. The only ''[[gate]]'' that led to the Mechanus workshop was in his chambers at the very bottom of the Purple Portals temple in Melvaunt. At some point, fellow Gondars, led by [[Isaac Glinckle]], attempted to recover the deceased artificer's research but were unsuccessful. Instead, they accidentally activated Ikathilo's constructs and were chased out of the workshop by malfunctioning and crazed [[mithral golem|mithral]], [[iron golem|iron]], and [[adamantine golem]]s.\n\nIn 1373 DR, heroes of the Moonsea serendipitously crossed paths with Isaac, who asked for their aid in recovering ''The Art of Golem Crafting'', lest it be considered lost forever. Eventually, the adventurers retrieved the priceless manuscript, returning it to the hands of the [[cleric]]s of the Purple Portals."
