King Verovans Treasure was a book that collected stories, rumors, and legends of many alleged treasures of Westgate, published sometime before 1374 DR.
The book opened by making a point that it was logical to assume that the city erected atop a dragon horde would have countless rumored true and not so many hidden treasures. Some were classic treasure chests filled with coin and gems buried by pirates. Some were sizable hidden treasure vaults belonging to tax-dodging rich merchants. The biggest rumored treasure was said to have belonged to the infamous last King of Westgate â€“ Verovan Lorndessar.
Verovan was said to be so avaricious that his love for gold left no place in his heart for anything but hate towards everything else. Some sages believed that King Verovan traded a part of his soul to a demon lord in exchange for a pocket realm somewhere in the Abyss. That was where his greatest riches were hidden, away from the Prime Material plane. The book theorized that the vault was accessible to Verovan and only Verovan via the use of some secret mechanism.
When the King died in the , those who cried over his corpse, cried over the secret of the Kings vault lost, and with it all the money Verovan took from his subjects. Still, the legends of his lost treasure continued to bring hopeful treasure hunters to Westgate.
