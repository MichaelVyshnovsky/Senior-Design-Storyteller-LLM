Davis]] and first released on 6th May 2008.\n\n{{Quote|''The past will come back to haunt them...''\n\n''A group of warriors from [[Rashemen]] escorts an exiled [[wizard]] to a ruined citadel in the [[Shandaular|City of Weeping Ghosts]]. Once there, the wizard discovers a [[barbarian]] tribe is trying to unlock the secrets of the citadel and the weapon that destroyed it two thousand years ago.''}}",
        "Summary": "Seven children, fleeing their captors, make their way to [[Shandaular]]. They are welcomed inside, only for the demons inhabiting their innocent bodies to trigger the trap set by [[Narfell]]. The city falls.\n\nOver 2,300 years later, in early [[Calendar of Harptos|Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, a felucca carrying a fang of [[Rashemaar berserkers]] of the [[Ice Wolf lodge]], led by [[Duras]]; an [[Hathran|Ethran]] named [[Thaena]]; and an exiled [[Vremyonni]] named [[Bastun]], is on their way to the ruins of Shandaular to see the senior [[wychlaran]] there and to perform the traditional rite officially banishing Bastun from the lands of [[Rashemen]].\n\nThey arrive to find that the city's wards, meant to keep the paths safe from the many ghosts that inhabit the ruins, have had their magic drained, and the ruins have been taken by a group of [[Creel]] warriors. Anilya, a [[Durthan]] who has been watching the city for her organization, is captured by the fang. Anilya proposes a temporary alliance to evict the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] from [[Rashemen]]. Reluctantly agreeing, the fang and the Durthan's hired mercenaries march on the [[Shield (fortress)|Shield]] where the city's wychlaran outpost is.\n\nThey arrive, finding the building's wards keeping the city's lesser spirits at bay, but all the hathran and their berserker guards are dead. Bastun's master had taught him many secrets of Shandaular, including that of the ''[[Breath]]'', a sword, and the ''[[Flame (artifact)|Flame]]'', a ring, both enchanted by King [[Arkaius]] of Shaundalar, that were key to activating the '''''Word''''', a [[gate]] between the Shield and the plane of [[Stygia]]. Those millennia ago, when Narfell had attacked the city, King Arkaius activated the Word in an attempt to pit the [[devil]]s of Stygia against the [[demon]]s of Narfell and in so doing, doomed his own city and it's people to death and an eternity of torment.\n\nAnilya attempts to take the power of these three artifacts and use it to protect Rashemen in her own amoral way, while Bastun attempts to secure them so that they don't fall into the wrong hands. Meanwhile, without the witch's wards, the undead of the city replay it's final day over again until the animated corpse of [[Serevan Crell]] can get his hands on the artifacts and use them to rebuild his father's empire.",
