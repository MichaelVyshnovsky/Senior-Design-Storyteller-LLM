        "mainbody": "''Moonlight Paean'' was a ballad written by Mintiper in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}. It describes the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]] the previous year, in which the [[Moonlight Men]] defeated [[Nethertide Horde|a horde]] of [[orc]]s and saved the cities of [[Silverymoon]] and [[Everlund]]. The victory came at great cost, as only six men survived the battle.\n\nMany scholars considered the ''Moonlight Paean'' to be Mintiper's most emotional work, as it shows a leader's anguish at the loss of his men. The ballad begins with six stanzas briefly describing the battle. The first stanza is then repeated as a refrain. Following this introduction, each and every warrior who fell in the battle is named with their fate described, including such valiant heroes as Lord [[Laerlos Silmerhelve II]], [[Tsaelynos]] of Everlund, and [[Barundar Battlehammer|\"Firebeard\" Battlehammer]].\n\n===Tree of Wailing Souls===\nOne of the folktales commonly attributed to Mintiper and included in the ''Chapbook'' tells the horrific encounter of the adventurer [[Lunargent]] and his five companions with a [[Tree of Wailing Souls|monstrous tree creature]]. The tree decapitated two of the six with its roots and branches, and the heads were added to the collection of others that shrieked and ranted insanely, impaled to the ends of the branches.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 2}}\n\nThe story was a popular one in [[the North]]&mdash;told as a ghost story while the door was locked&mdash;but the setting of the monstrous Tree of Wailing Souls changed with each telling. The version of the tale included in the ''Chapbook'' was written in 1344 and was a first-person account of a true story, with Mintiper using the obvious alias of \"Lunargent\", as he often did. Despite the tale's truth, scholars often doubted its veracity.",
