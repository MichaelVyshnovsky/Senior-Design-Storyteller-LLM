        "mainbody": "The Mage in the Iron Mask is a novel by Brian Thomsen. It is the fourth in The Nobles series.\nSelfaril Uoumdolphin, High Blade of Mulmaster, finds a twin brother, Rassendyll, held in the Retreat, where many inconvenient nobles live in seclusion. Donal Loomis, a Thayan exile, captures Rassendyl and tries to sell him to Dmitra Flass, Tharchioness of Eltabbar and wife of Selfaril, but Melker Rickman, leader of the Hawks, captures Rassendyl, sealing him in an iron mask, throwing him in a dungeon, and wiping out the retreat. \nPassepout shares the cell for a night, causing him and Volo to be hunted as potential witnesses. Volo discovers the slaughter at the retreat along with Chesslyn Onaubra, a Harper. Rassendyl escapes and meets up with Passepout, who finds Volo and Chesslyn at the estate of Honor Falstaff, a blind former Hawk leader also hosting a cloak, Mason McKern. They discover Rassendyls identity and that McKerns brother made the mask before being killed. \nThey develop a plan to overthrow Selfaril and replace him with Rassendyl, infiltrating the city and removing the mask. Selfaril is assassinated by a Thayan ambassador, sent by the Thayans expecting to fail and allowed to continue by Rickman, who wanted to overthrow Selfaril. The ambassador and Rickman are captured and executed, and Rassendyl takes his brotherâ€™s place.\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull   &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nRegions\nSettlements\nBuilding & Sites\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nFood & Drink\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nMiscellaneous\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nCategoryNovels\nCategoryBooks\nCategoryWorks by Brian Thomsen\nCategoryPublished in 1996\nr6d9j088jf30mf11bn8g4l2uo33d6x2"
