Iphigen dedicated the tome to discussing theology and the history of mortals becoming gods, namely, Lords of Death Kelemvor, who was the latest deity to take over that portfolio. The book talked about who Kelemvor was in life â€“ a \"hard man of harder convictions\" who made a living by being a mercenary. Despite a rough exterior and scowling, Kelemvor was said to hide a paladins stoicism and strict moral beliefs. As a deity, Kelemvor had to soften his attitude and beliefs in order to perform his godly duties without mortal caprices, as a cool-headed and wise judge, a rather cold and malicious god of death.\nSometime before the , a copy of Judge of the Damned found its way into the hands of Malus Thorm and was stored in his office in the House of Healing in Reithwin. By the , a copy of the book was held in the library of the Stormshore Tabernacle in the city of Baldurs Gate."
