Jalusters Orizon was an ancient arcane spellbook penned by the wizard Jaluster. This tome was carried by Jaluster at the time of his death. It contained five spells ranging from common to unique or rare.
Jalusters Orizon was a portly tome. Its embossed and painted cowhide was stretched over wooden boards bordered with iron. Each of its twelve pages was a thin piece of slate covered in stretched vellum. The vellum was clamped with hammered electrum. The first five pages held one spell apiece, but the last seven pages were blank.
This book was guarded by a rare creature called a tome guardian.
