Dark Exodus is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.
The mystery of the Gray migrations remains a puzzle to all folk in the Delimbiyr Vale save the High Forest orcs themselves, and none of them are willing to talk about it. The party ventures into the tuskers former home to find out why, only to be attacked by drow! A treant then tasks them with saving a large number of fey who are being held hostage by the drow.
