'''Dark Exodus''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

==Plot==
The mystery of the [[Gray migrations]] remains a puzzle to all folk in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] save the High Forest [[orc]]s themselves, and none of them are willing to talk about it. The party ventures into the tusker's former home to find out why, only to be attacked by [[drow]]! A [[treant]] then tasks them with saving a large number of [[fey]] who are being held hostage by the drow.

{{quote|What would you do if the fate of another is in your hands, but you are being asked to do something foul? Do you give in to the demands of the villain or do you put the life of the hostage at risk? It is a question that I never had to answer, and if Mielikki is willing, I never will.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}
