Chronicles of Rothilion was a collection of several tomes recorded by the esteemed human judge of ancient Myth Drannor, Rothilion the Honorable.
The many volumes of Chronicles of Rothilion were separated in two groups. The first one had the books names and number engraved on the books spines in Common, the second one in Elvish. Both groups could also be easily distinguished by the difference in the types of leather used to bind the tomes.
The Chronicles of Rothilion was a journal penned by Rothilion and they included his personal thoughts and life, as well as the history of the City of Song as it related to the author. The books were written in first person. The difference in language and format of Chronicles of Rothilion was symbolic as it punctuated the day Rothilion was elevated to the post of the Master Wizard and made an oath to denounce Common in favor of Elvish language. That day was documented in the last numbered tome in the collection with the Common language name.
By 1369 DR, the full set of the Chronicles of Rothilion was sealed in the Crypt of Rothilion in Myth Drannors Polyandrium. Mysteriously, a loose page from the Testament of Jade could be found inside the last book in the set.
