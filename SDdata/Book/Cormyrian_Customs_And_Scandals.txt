Cormyrian Customs And Scandals was a publication that circulated around Cormyr sometime before the 1370s DR. It was written by Asgerlan Burtrann.
Unfortunately for Asgerlan, some Cormyrian nobles took great offense to the content of his book and he was gruesomely executed by being dragged behind a horse on the decree of Throrton Marliir.
