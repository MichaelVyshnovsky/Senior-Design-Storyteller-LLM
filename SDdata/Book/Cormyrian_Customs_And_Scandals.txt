==History==
{{Quote|&hellip;a brief and tasteful inquiry into interesting social pastimes and their effects.|Asgerlan Burtrann, describing his work}}
Unfortunately for Asgerlan, some Cormyrian nobles took great offense to the content of his book and he was gruesomely executed by being dragged behind a horse on the decree of [[Throrton Marliir]].
