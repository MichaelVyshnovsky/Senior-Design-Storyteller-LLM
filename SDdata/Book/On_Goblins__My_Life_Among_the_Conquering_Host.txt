'''''On Goblins: My Life Among the Conquering Host''''' was an unpublished manuscript that described the ecology of [[goblin]]s and [[goblinoid]] culture, written by the famous writer and world-weary traveler, [[Volothamp Geddarm]].
{{Quote|The goblins of my recent acquaintance—fine though uncouth fellows by and large—have a fiery courage, fueled by their love of the Absolute.|''Excerpt from On Goblins: My Life Among the Conquering Host.''}}

==Description==
The writings existed as a set of loosely bound sheets, inscribed with text and rough sketches of various goblins.

==Content==
The draft of this work contained hastily written notes regarding the culture of goblins that were assimilated into the [[cult of the Absolute]]. It noted how these goblins held a zealous love for the goddess they referred to as [[the Absolute]]. It was that passion that set them apart from other tribes; they did not demonstrate the cowardice of typical goblin-kind, and did not scatter in fear when their leaders were slain in battle. ''On Goblins'' spoke of more-potent magic―or [[booyagh|"booyagh"]] in the [[Goblin language|goblin tongue]]―wielded by the cult's resident priests.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the only copy of Volo's manuscript remained in the possession of Booyagh [[Piddle]].
