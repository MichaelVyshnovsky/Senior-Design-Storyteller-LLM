'''''Ga Nomes''''' was a [[Gnome|gnomish]] drinking song apparently written by [[Mintiper Moonsilver]] as a "thank you" to the gnomes of the [[High Forest]] who helped him to speed through the area via the [[Trail of Mists]].

==Contents==
The song had inspired many bar brawls since its first reported performance in the {{YearlinkName|1344}} and other gnomes had been adding their own verses in order to insult every audience.

The original went as follows: 
{{Quote|Ga 'nomes went in, ga 'nomes went out,<br/>Now look at ga fields all about.<br/>Ga men of course get all ga 'lory,<br/>Forgotten again, same old story!<br/><br/>(CHORUS)<br/><br/>We may be here, we may be there,<br/>Like men of course we're everywhere!<br/>We may be fair, but so are elves,<br/>Ga People, see, are just themselves!<br/>We may be stout, but so are dwarves,'<br/>At least we're not afraid of wharves!<br/>We may be small, but so are hin,<br/>At least we have hair on our chin!<br/>We may be fierce, but so are orcs,<br/>At least we do not taste like pork!<br/>We may be here, we may be there,<br/>Ga misty trail runs everywhere!<br/>Ga 'nomes went in, ga 'nomes went out,<br/>Now look at ga trees all about.<br/>Ga elves of course get all ga 'lory,<br/>Forgotten again, same old story!<br/><br/>(CHORUS)<br/><br/>Ga 'nomes went in, ga 'nomes went out,<br/>Now look at ga gems all about.<br/>Ga dwarves of course get all ga 'lory,<br/>Forgotten again, same old story!<br/><br/>(CHORUS)<br/><br/>Ga 'nomes went in, ga 'nomes went out,<br/>Now look at ga pipes all about.<br/>Ga hin of course get half ga 'lory,''<br/>Forgotten again, same old story!<br/><br/>(CHORUS)<br/><br/>Ga 'nomes went in, ga 'nomes went out,<br/>Now look at nothing all about.<br/>Ga orcs of course get all ga 'ory,<br/>Oops, not our fault, and not our story!<br/><br/>(CHORUS)}}
