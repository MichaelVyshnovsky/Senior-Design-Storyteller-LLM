        "mainbody": "'''''Old Time Battles''''' was popular upbeat song in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], often performed without lyrics, only accompanied by rhythmic grunts and finished by a \"HOO-RAH!\" shout.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, performances of ''Old Time Battles'' were common on the streets of [[Baldur's Gate]] and along the shores of the [[Chionthar Valley]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. [[Bard]]s and [[minstrel]]s who sang or played the melody were sure to swiftly attract the attention of the crowds. The song's annotated sheet music could be found in the [[Chromatic Scale]] instrument shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate."
