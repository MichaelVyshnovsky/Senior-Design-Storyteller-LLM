Order of the Gauntlet On Matters of Law and Justice was a book that outlined the tenets of the Order of the Gauntlet, a quasi-military group that upheld the virtues of righteousness across the Realms.
The book began by defining the concepts of goodness and lawfulness. To be good, it said, was to be free from evil and to seek peace and strike out at wickedness. It said that the practice of upholding the law was to maintain order over chaos, but was not itself free from corruption. It was only the virtue of justice that remained of importance to the Order of the Gauntlet and its holy warriors. It was justice that was demanded by the deities Helm, Hoar, Torm, and Tyr.
As of the , there remained a copy of On Matters of Law and Justice in a tollhouse situated along the Risen Road on the Sword Coast.
