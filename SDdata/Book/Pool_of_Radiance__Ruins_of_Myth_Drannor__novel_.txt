Pool of Radiance The Ruins of Myth Drannor by Carrie Bebris is a novel based on the computer game of the same name by SSI.
Kestrel, a thief operating in Phlan, returns to stash some of her stolen goods in Valjevo Castle only to discover the Pool of Radiance, empty since the defeat of Tyranthraxus, has refilled. She hears that Elminster is in the city and offering a reward for information about the pool, so she sets off to find him. However, she is heavily intoxicated and does not remember what happened when she wakes the next day. 
She returns to the castle to retrieve her cache of stolen items only to find it is guarded by three people the paladin of Tyr Corran DArcey, the half-elf sorcerer Ghleanna Stormlake, and the guard Durwyn. The trio are expecting her, and Kestrel learns she volunteered to help guard the ruins when meeting with Elminster. A group of adventurers led by the warrior Athan have also been dispatched to Myth Drannor, believed to be the source of the Pool. Athan’s group carries the Gauntlets of Moander, artifacts said to be able to destroy the pool.
A portal opens, and the group in Phlan sees Athan’s band under attack. They travel through the gate only to find most of the party dead and the gauntlets gone. They explore the city, encountering Beriand and Faeril, followers of Mystra, of a sect founded by the priestess Anorrweyn Evensong.
The group continues exploring the city, finding and recruiting the sorcerer Jarial. They encounter various enemies, including a strong presence of the Cult of the Dragon. They learn that the leaders of this cell of the cult are the archwizard Kya Mordrayn and the dracolich Pelendralaar.
The party encounters the spirit of Caalenfaire, a diviner. He tells them that the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted the city’s mythal and the party should seek out Harldain Ironbar, another spirit, to help cleanse it. The party also find the spirit of Annorweyn, who explains that during the fall of Myth Drannor, the citys residents sought a way to prevent the mythal from being corrupted. Harldain found a perfect gem and crafted into the Gem of the Weave, tied to the mythal. The gem needed a communicant, so the elf Miroden Silverblade became a baelnorn tied to the gem.
Faeril joins the party after learning that they encountered Annorwyn. The party set off to find Miroden, eventually freeing him from magical confinement. Miroden tells them that the gem has been destroyed, and they will need a new gem and a new communicant. He suggests Annorweyn. Annorwyn agrees, but is confused, as she believes Miroden should have been destroyed if the old Gem of the Weave was destroyed. The party uses a gem from Harldain to create a new Gem of the Weave, but Annorwyn isnt able to cleanse the mythal because the old Gem is still in use. The party learns that Miroden was tricked into giving the gem to Mordryn.
The party sets off to cleanse the mythal. They encounter Athan along the way, rescuing him from the cult. He is revealed to be Ghleanna’s brother. The party destroys the old Gem of the Weave with help from Miroden, who also wipes out all the cultists except Mordryn and Pelendralaar. The party are able to kill the wizard and the dracolich and destroy the Pool of Radiance, then use their Gem of the Weave to cleanse the mythal and establish Annorweyn as the new communicant.
