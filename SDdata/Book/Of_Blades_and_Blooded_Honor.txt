'''''Of Blades and Blooded Honor''''' was an ancient [[book]] that collected lore and history of the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthyr]], preserved and secured behind [[Candlekeep]]'s fortress walls as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Predictably enough, at this time the most powerful seat of elven culture was not [[Evermeet]] at all, but the forest of Cormanthyr. As ambitious [[gold elves]] came to realize this, many of them began to leave the island and settle in the burgeoning cities of Cormanthyr...''|An excerpt from ''Of Blades and Blooded Honor''}}

==History==
On 11{{th}} of [[Flamerule 11|Flamerule]], the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Athol]] of Candlekeep responded to [[Danilo Thann]]'s of [[Waterdeep]] numerous very persistent requests regarding the ''Of Blades and Blooded Honor''. Athol turned down the [[Harper]] as the tome he had his eye on was ancient and one of the five oldest books stored in the library fortress of Candlekeep. Instead, Athol sent Danilo a sampling pages copied from the book, and if the Waterdhavian was satisfied with the contents, Athol offered to hire a scribe to make a complete copy foe a humble price of 5,000 [[gp]]. A generous offer, considering the scribe's youth and lack of experience.
