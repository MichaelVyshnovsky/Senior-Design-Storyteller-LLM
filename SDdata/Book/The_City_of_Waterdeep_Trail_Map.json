Main streets turn into blind alleys. Thriving markets adjoin crime-infested slums. The wise traveler avoids problems by consulting his Trail Map.''\n\n''TM4 maps out not only the grand city of [[Waterdeep]], but also two other cities featured in the Avatar trilogy: [[Shadowdale]], fabled home of [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster the Sage]], and [[Tantras]], a bustling port on the [[Dragon Reach]].''\n\n''All maps are full color, printed on a 36\" by 57\" sheets suitable for use in gaming or as a wall poster.''}}",
