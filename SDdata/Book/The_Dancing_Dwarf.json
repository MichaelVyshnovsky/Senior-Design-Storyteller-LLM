The City of Splendors, Waterdeep was often the target of the Dwarfs biting satire that lampooned the citys pompous nobles and rulers. This made the chapbook gain popularity in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR, as no local publication was daring enough to ridicule guildmasters and other positions of power. In both Waterdeep and Secomber, The Dancing Dwarf was a common sight in the Dock Ward, taverns, and festhalls."
