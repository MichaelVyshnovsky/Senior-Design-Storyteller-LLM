==Synopsis==
{{Quote|''A collection of four New York Times bestselling novels by [[R. A. Salvatore]].''

''The Legacy of the Drow Collector's Edition brings together four bestselling novels: ''[[The Legacy]]'', ''[[Starless Night]]'', ''[[Siege of Darkness]]'', and ''[[Passage to Dawn]]''. The adventure begins in seeming serenity as we find [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] enjoying a rare state of peace. But he did not arrive at this station without leaving powerful enemies in his wake. [[Lolth]], the dreaded Spider Queen deity of the evil [[drow|Dark Elves]], counts herself among these enemies and has vowed to end the drow's idyllic days. Thus begins a severe and lasting chain of events that make these collected Forgotten Realms novels unforgettable reads.''}}
