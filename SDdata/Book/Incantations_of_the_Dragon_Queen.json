        "mainbody": "Incantations of the Dragon Queen was an especially rare tome that held much esoteric knowledge regarding the Dragon Queen Tiamat. It was highly prized by the second iteration of the Cult of the Dragon that emerged during the late 15 century DR.\nAnyone that was brave enough to read from the book could hope to gain a portion of the power described within.\nAs of the 1480s DR, the tome could be found within Tiamats temple, the Dragon Queens fortress that arose from Avernus in the Nine Hells to the Well of Dragons in the Backlands of Faer√ªn."
