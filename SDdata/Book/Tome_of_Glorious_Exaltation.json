        "Content": "A typical ''Tome of Glorious Exaltation'' was a volume of finest [[vellum]], hand-scribed using thrice-[[bless]]ed [[gold]]en [[ink]]. The book's pages were filled with writings that inspired and invigorated all those who read of listened to the words said out loud.",
        "Powers": "The tome's magic was similar to the ''[[exaltation]]'' [[spell]]. When read out-loud once per day, ''Tomes of Glorious Exaltation'' washed a single reader or listener with magical cleaning and granted them protection from ''[[fear]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]edness'', being rendered unconsciousness, mundane and magical intoxication, as well as from being sent into a berserk rage, ''[[confusion|confused]]'', and affected by hopelessness.\n\n''Tomes of Glorious Exaltation'' could only be used by [[cleric]]s and [[monk]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the library of the [[Black Raven Monastery]], in the mountains above the [[Ice Lakes]] and the [[Black Raven River]], owned a ''Tome of Glorious Exaltation'' and was willing to part it with a hefty fee."
