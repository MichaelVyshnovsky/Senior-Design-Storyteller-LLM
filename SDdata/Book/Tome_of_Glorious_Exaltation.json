The books pages were filled with writings that inspired and invigorated all those who read of listened to the words said out loud.\nThe tomes magic was similar to the exaltation spell. When read out-loud once per day, Tomes of Glorious Exaltation washed a single reader or listener with magical cleaning and granted them protection from fear, sleep, feeblemindedness, being rendered unconsciousness, mundane and magical intoxication, as well as from being sent into a berserk rage, confused, and affected by hopelessness.\nTomes of Glorious Exaltation could only be used by clerics and monks.\nIn the , the library of the Black Raven Monastery, in the mountains above the Ice Lakes and the Black Raven River, owned a Tome of Glorious Exaltation and was willing to part it with a hefty fee."
