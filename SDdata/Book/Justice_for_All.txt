Justice for All was a book of memoirs penned by Ada the Unbending, a priestess, judge, and adventuring paladin of Tyr in the mid-14 century DR.
Ada the Unbending retired to the community called Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers after a life of service to a local temple to Tyr and civic service as a judge for three decades. At the age of sixty-seven, she put down her hammer and picked up a quill. In her retirement, Ada was working on her memoir â€“ Justice for All, however, it was not known if the book ever saw print.
