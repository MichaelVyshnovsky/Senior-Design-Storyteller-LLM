The moon used to shine so brightly here. We'd all stand out, our shoulders bared, our faces unturned, drinking in the blessings like milk.''|Excerpt from ''Queen of Ravens.''}}",
        "Content": "The book's [[Selûnite]] author wrote about how the ''shadow-curse'' enveloped the town of [[Reithwin]] at the foot of the [[Moonrise Towers]]. It talks about the town slowly changing and, even the moon stopping shining at night and the inhabitants turning to worshiping [[Shar]]. The Selûnite felt like he was the last sane person in Reithwin as he watched the waning moon in secret late at night."
