        "Contents": "In its unfinished state, the [[book]] was nothing more than a barely-legible draft that focused on spirits (the alcohol kind). Some of the items listed in the book were: [[ghost]], [[banshee]], [[poltergeist]], and \"spooky\". All were, presumably, recipes of alcoholic drinks. One of these libations called for a full mug of ice, half a mug of distilled [[potato]] spirits, and three thimbles of citrus [[juice]]. The drink was served with a garnish of [[mint]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, this work was still an early manuscript, carried by its author, Volothamp Geddarm, during his venture to the [[Western Heartlands]] and investigation of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]."
