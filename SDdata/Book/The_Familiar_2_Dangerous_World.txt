'''''Dangerous World''''' is a short story by [[Andrew Foley]] for ''[[Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear]]''. The story was published in ''[[The Familiar 2]]''.

==Summary==
The story begins sometime during the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, with the [[hobgoblin]] [[Grathm]] hunting down the [[goblin]] [[shaman]] M'khiin Grubdoubler.

During a storm, M'khiin takes refuge in a cave, where she discovers an injured [[drow]], [[Baeloth Barrityl]]. She heals him and decides to assist him, though her efforts seem to yield little reward beyond gaining a deeper understanding of the broader world around her.

M'khiin cleverly outmaneuvers the goblins from her village who are tracking her. She arranges a clever encounter with an adventuring party called [[Silver Hawkes]] also pursuing Baeloth, forcing the two groups fight one another. M'khiin and Baeloth observe the battle and execute the remaining pursuers.
