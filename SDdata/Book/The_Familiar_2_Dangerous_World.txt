Dangerous World is a short story by Andrew Foley for Baldurs Gate Siege of Dragonspear. The story was published in The Familiar 2.
The story begins sometime during the , with the hobgoblin Grathm hunting down the goblin shaman Mkhiin Grubdoubler.
During a storm, Mkhiin takes refuge in a cave, where she discovers an injured drow, Baeloth Barrityl. She heals him and decides to assist him, though her efforts seem to yield little reward beyond gaining a deeper understanding of the broader world around her.
Mkhiin cleverly outmaneuvers the goblins from her village who are tracking her. She arranges a clever encounter with an adventuring party called Silver Hawkes also pursuing Baeloth, forcing the two groups fight one another. Mkhiin and Baeloth observe the battle and execute the remaining pursuers.
