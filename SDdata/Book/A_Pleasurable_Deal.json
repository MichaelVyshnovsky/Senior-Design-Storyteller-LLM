        "mainbody": "A Pleasurable Deal'' told the story of Robert, a [[tiefling]] man whose wife had left him for another lover. He was approached by a [[cambion]] named Carlisle, who astutely observed Robert's greatest insecurity and woe: his insignificant member that was insufficient to impregnate his wife. In the play's finale, Robert died in a horrible way after breaking the deal with Carlisle.\n\n''A Pleasurable Deal's'' inspiration came from the director – Mr. Kingsley Harp's desire to explore taboos and human nature, according to a published interview. Despite the interviewer's statement that most people would never make a deal with a champion, Kingsley interrupted, saying that everyone wants something and cambions knew mortals better than they knew themselves. The interview was cut short after Kingsley Harp was asked if he had made a deal himself after countless publications refused print by the tabloid called ''[[Baldur's Bash]]''.",
