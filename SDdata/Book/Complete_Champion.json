Your choices shape the world.''\n \n''This book gives players and Dungeon Masters an unprecedented resource for using divine power and religion in their game. In addition to new feats, spells, items, and prestige classes, the Complete Champion game supplement presents exciting adventure locations, afilliation mechanics for different deities and organizations, and a system for designing your own religions based on the cleric domain system.

This book also helps Dungeon Masters run quest-themed campaigns and adventures.\n\nIn addition to providing various archetypes for characters, Complete Champion includes new feats and prestige classes. The book features dozens of [[deity]] and belief-themed organizations, turning religion and holy (or unholy) power into something characters of all classes can use. For the Dungeon Master, this book contains information on constructing and running quests and holy missions. It assists the DM in helping all characters in the party to pursue divine paths simultaneously.",
