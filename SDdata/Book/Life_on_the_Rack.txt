{{quote|
Adventures are things farmers and craftsmen have little time for, and merchants can spare few coins toward. That leaves adventure to those unwilling souls who have it thrust upon them—sometimes literally, and to the thugs and fools who enjoy violence and danger or know no other way to feed themselves.

There are a lot of those, so we have large armies, and lots of bloody adventure. A good thing too—else what would the farmers, craftsmen, and merchants have to talk about, in the taverns at night?|Shavryn Ilidar, ''Life on the Rack''}}
