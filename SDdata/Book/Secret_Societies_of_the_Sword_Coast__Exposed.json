        "mainbody": "Secret Societies of the Sword Coast Exposed was a non-fiction book that outlined several secretive groups that operated throughout the Sword Coast in the late 15 century.\nThe book shared some insight into four secret societies of the region, some of which were more well-known than others.\nThe Harpers organization was said to be the most famous―or infamous―of the groups described within, even if their actual activities were more secretive. While its members famously said they detested the acquisition of power, the author doubted that was entirely true. The Harpers understood that knowledge is power and, by shrouding their own schemes, they managed to keep a tight grip over both.\nThe Shadow Druids was a group dedicated to the preservation of natural life at the cost of the more-intelligent humanoid species. They were said to be extremely dangerous, with an ideal about the natural order that would be considered depraved by nearly all peoples.\nThe Order of Klurd was a sect of conspiratorial killers, despots, and sadists who found pleasure in delivering pain and suffering to others. They were among the lesser-known of the orders outlined in Secret Societies.\nThe author shared no information about the Dark Justiciars, save for their worship of the goddess Shar.\nAs of the , a copy of Secret Societies of the Sword Coast Exposed could be found in a secret trove in the depths of the Emerald Grove."
