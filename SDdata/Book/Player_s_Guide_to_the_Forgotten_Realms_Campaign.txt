==Description==
The ''Player’s Guide to the Forgotten Realms'' follows the journal entries of an adventuring company called [[The Seekers]] as they travel across the Realms seeking the ''[[Tear of Selûne]]'' using the ''[[staff of the Shard]]''. In each chapter their quest takes them to a different part of the Realms. Sidebars in each chapter also give more background information on various locations, races, organizations, or other odds and ends. The book contains a few maps of cities and regions and one of the continent, but no hard statistics are given for anything.

The Seekers, comprising a [[gnome]] illusionist, a [[halfling]] [[thief]], and a [[human]] [[ranger]], embarks on an extensive exploration of the Realms, aiming to experience its myriad wonders as dictated by time and destiny. Their journey commences in [[Waterdeep]] and takes them through notable locations such as [[Neverwinter]], the [[High Moor]], and the [[Forgotten Forest]], marking the initial phase of their adventure. The narrative reaches a climactic pause in the dungeons of [[Zhentil Keep]], laying the groundwork for a continuation of their story, which the reader is invited to envision.

Alongside the narrative, the guide incorporates concise sidebars that offer insights into various aspects of the Realms. These include discussions on druidic circles, the [[Harpers]], and the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], providing valuable context and background information.
