        "mainbody": "The '''''Book of the Black''''' was a [[Sharran]] [[artifact]] that laid out the [[Black Chronology]], an alternate timeline to the [[Roll of Years]]. It was written by [[Augathra the Mad]], the famous [[Netherese]] [[:category:seers|seer]] whose work helped forming the marking of years by [[Dale Reckoning]].",
        "Description": "It was a rather large tome and unassuming in appearance. To most readers its [[vellum]] pages appeared entirely blank.\n\nCopies of the original ''Book of the Black'' did exist, but were extremely rare.",
        "Powers": "In truth, the ''Book of the Black's'' contents were cursed by [[Shar]] to be entirely undecipherable to anyone not of her choosing. This effect could not be reversed, even by powerful magic. With tremendous effort and skill, a reader could possible uncover about four lines of the book's text, and could require [[wish|one of the most powerful arcane spells]] or even [[miracle|divine intervention]].\n\nAnyone that did manage to read some text from the ''Book of the Black'' were inundated with bizarre and troubling revelations about the [[multiverse]] itself. They could also glean some insight into Shar's followers, and the nature of her [[Shadow Weave]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|-700}}, Augathra the seer received visions that led her to inscribe the Roll of Years. During this time, visions seeped into her dreams, laying out the alternate chronology that came to be crucial to the plots schemed and undertaken by Shar's worshipers. It was the information laid out in these visions that drove Augathra mad and led to her immortality.\n\nThe book was discovered centuries later in the {{YearlinkName|684}}, by the [[Dark Diviners]] of the [[Windsong Tower]] in [[Myth Drannor]]. They used its writings to create their own manuscript, ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''. Shortly thereafter, both the ''Book of the Black'' and ''The Leaves of One Night'' were stolen by Sharran clergy.\n\nOver five hundred years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the [[Cyricist]] Skull Servant [[Bineera Ethar]] discovered a torn parchment within the Sharran [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]] in the [[Shadowfell]], that laid out the Black Chronology inscribed within the ''Book of the Black''. The [[church of Cyric]] began a search for the book, with the hopes of uncovering the secret plots held by the [[church of Shar]]. \n\nAround the same time, a copy of the ''Book of the Black'' was sent over by [[Esvele Greycastle]] of the [[House of Night]] temple beneath [[Shadowdale]], to [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] [[Yder Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]]. Unfortunately for the [[Shadovar]] prince, a notable section of the tome was missing.<ref group=\"note\">While not explicitly stated, it is suggested that the missing excerpt was the same parchment described in the adventure, ''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]''.\n\nThe true and whole ''Book of the Black'' remained interred within the [[Crypt of Augathra the Mad]] near the ruins of [[Synod]] in [[Anauroch]]. Some time during or after [[Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, a band of adventurers recovered the book from within Augathra's tomb.\n\nWhat came of the book after its recovery was unclear, but the events it foresaw had already come to pass. Other prophecies laid out within the ancient text were just over the horizon, waiting for the worshipers of Shar to make them reality.",
        "Reputation": "It was said that the contents of the ''Book of the Black'' were secrets held by Shar, and outlined horrors that were yet come to pass.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Esvele Greycastle]], came into possession of a copy during or after he travels near the Monastery of the Ebon Dome. \n* [[Yder Tanthul]], received the copy sent to him by Esvele Greycastle."
