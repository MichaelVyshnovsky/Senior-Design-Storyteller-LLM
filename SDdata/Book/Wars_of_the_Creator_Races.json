        "mainbody": "'''''Wars of the Creator Races''''' was a tome that collected the scarce knowledge of the [[creator race]]s and their conflicts, written and published before the [[Wailing Death]] crisis of [[1372 DR]].",
        "Contents": "''Wars of the Creator Races'' talked about the races that preceded the modern humanoid races of Toril. Those ancient races were reptilian creatures, amphibian creatures, and avian creatures, that ruled the world. The book stated that those creator races went to war with both, other ancient races, and among themselves, seeking dominance over the realms.\n\nMost information in the book was ancient stories and lore. One of note was about the [[Old One]]s who betrayed their kin to gain control over a temple, a source of power. They used the trust of the citizens of the town where the temple stood and infiltrated the structure. Once inside, they murdered the guardians and priests inside. Soon after, they seized control of the entire city after murdering its rulers.\n\nThe Old Ones' control over the temple did not last, however. The same year, the avian creator race conquered the city of the powerful temple and burned it all to the ground.",
        "History": "Copies of ''Wars of the Creator Races'' book could be found around the areas of [[Neverwinter]], [[Daggerford]], and the [[Sword Coast North]]  ''circa'' 1372 DR."
