Empires of the Sands is a sourcebook for the 1st-edition of Dungeons & Dragons in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, published in 1988. It details the Lands of Intrigue Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr.
Empires of the Sands is a 64-page booklet, which is wrapped in a removable cover, includes a one page introduction, explaining that this book covers three major areas of in the southwest corner of the continent of Faerûn known as the Empires of the Sands Amn (pages 3–20), Tethyr (pages 21–47), and Calimshan (pages 48–62). Each of the nations located along the southern coast of the Sea of Swords, an area with a warm climate and large areas of dry, inhospitable land, receives its own section, and each section begins with a general description including the races present, followed by information covering their languages, social customs, monsters, history, government and politics, religions, geography and climate, trade, cities, places of interest, and important characters.
Most cities receive only a column of text on the average, with some descriptions consisting of just noting what each city is renowned for, its exports, population, government, and location. The center of the booklet is taken up with one blank character sheet, seven character sheets filled in with the statistics for the Company of Eight from Tethyr, and reduced maps of the area. The last page, page 64, features an index to the book. The book also includes two maps which match the edges of the maps in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set. The pair of fold-out color poster maps depict the three countries at a scale of 30 miles to the inch, making them compatible with other maps in the series.
