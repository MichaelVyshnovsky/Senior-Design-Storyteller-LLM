The Tome of Amun-Re was a book from the Pyramid of Amun-Re. It was divided between the Book of Amun-Re, and the Tale of the Years.
The Tome was a large white book with gleaming metal fittings.
The Book of Amun-Re was written by the Pharaoh of Bakar, Amun-Re, during his life. In it, he spoke briefly of his own life. The narration led up to the point where the young pharaoh came to decide that his tomb would be protected at any cost.
The Tale of the Years was written by the priests of Amun-Re after his death. It spoke of the pyramid itself, Amun-Re, his curse, the success of his pyramid at foiling thieves, rumors regarding Munafik, and disappearances amongst the priests.
