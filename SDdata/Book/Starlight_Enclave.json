        "mainbody": "'''''Starlight Enclave''''' is a novel by [[R.A. Salvatore]], the first book of ''[[The Way of the Drow]]'' series featuring [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].{{Cite web/Starlight Enclave}} \n\n{{Quote|''After the settling dust of the [[demon]] uprising and two years of peace, rumblings from the [[Menzoberranzan]] [[drow]] have [[Jarlaxle]] nervous. Worried his allies may be pulled into a Civil War between the great Houses, he is eager to ensure [[Zaknafein]] is armed with weapons befitting his skill, including one in particular: [[Khazid’hea]]. A powerful artifact, the sword known as “Cutter” has started wars, corrupted its users, and spilled the blood of many, many people. Nonetheless—or maybe because of that—the rogue Jarlaxle and a small group of friends will go on an expedition looking for the weapon’s last wielder, [[Doum'wielle]], in the freezing north, for she may be the key to unlocking the sword’s potential…and perhaps the key to preventing the bloodshed looming over the [[Underdark]].''\n\n''And as they explore the top of the world, [[Drizzt]] is on a journey of his own—both spiritual and physical. He wants to introduce his daughter [[Brie]] to Grandmaster [[Kane]] and the practices that have been so central to his beliefs. But, having only recently come back from true transcendence, the drow [[ranger]] is no longer sure what his beliefs mean anymore. He is on a path to determining the future, not just for his family, but perhaps the entire northlands of the Realms themselves.''\n\n''Two different roads. On one, Jarlaxle and Zaknefein are on a quest to find pieces that could offer salvation to Menzoberranzan. On the other, Drizzt seeks answers that could offer salvation to not just his soul, but all souls.''\n\n''And no matter the outcome of either journey, the Realms will never be the same again.''}}"
