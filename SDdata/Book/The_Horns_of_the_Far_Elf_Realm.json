        "mainbody": "The Horns of the Far Elf Realm was an ancient ballad that told of a fabled, lost, and forgotten elven kingdom known as Braceldaur.\nIn the late 14 century DR, this song became a favorite of the elf Tasar Taurntyrith, who would often murmur it while walking the streets of Waterdeep or while painting the door and wall panels that his parents sold in Taurntyrith Adornments. Eventually, he became convinced that Braceldaur was no mere fable and was determined to seek it out. To this end, he befriended Thorauntur Szalmast, the proprietor of Old Winding Road Maps and Charts, so he could look over the maps that littered his dusty shop. When Thorauntur eventually died, Tasar found that the old man had willed to him a map of Braceldaur, which showed that it had stood in a valley long since taken over by the Moonsea."
