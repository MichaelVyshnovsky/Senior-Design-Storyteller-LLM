        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this song became a favorite of the elf [[Tasar Taurntyrith]], who would often murmur it while walking the streets of [[Waterdeep]] or while painting the door and wall panels that his parents sold in [[Taurntyrith Adornments]]. Eventually, he became convinced that Braceldaur was no mere fable and was determined to seek it out. To this end, he befriended [[Thorauntur Szalmast]], the proprietor of [[Old Winding Road Maps and Charts]], so he could look over the [[map]]s that littered his dusty shop. When Thorauntur eventually died, Tasar found that the old man had willed to him a map of Braceldaur, which showed that it had stood in a valley long since taken over by the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]]."
