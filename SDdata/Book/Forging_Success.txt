'''''Forging Success''''' was a self-help [[book]] of dubious nature that promoted the [[Sharran]] [[House of Grief]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Let us speak plainly, dear reader. You may believe deception to be an artform – one that benefits you more than it harms you. But this is the worst lie of all – the self-deception that shall one day be your ruin. But how can you break the cycle? It can prove difficult to speak the truth when lies come so easily. Instead, perhaps do not speak at all. If you cannot be honest, then at least you can be silent.''|Excerpt from ''Forging Success''}}

==Content==
The book claimed to be able to help those who sought to break a cycle of lie and deceit. It diminished what some would call an art form to be nothing but self-delusion. The book's long-winded text offered the reader treatments pioneered by the House of Grief and, in the end, was nothing but an advertisement for the House of Grief's services.

==History==
By the {{Yearlink|1492}}, ''Forging Success'' could be found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and was available in the House of Grief.
