        "mainbody": "century DR\nFilfaeril Bound and Willing was a scandalous and outrageous chapbook, that depicted the Dragon Queen Filfaeril Obarskyr in salacious scenarios, published some time in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nSometime after its publication in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the chapbook was banned in Cormyr. Yet it continued to be circulated in the Realms beyond Cormyr by means of caravan trade routes.\nWith the authorship of Filfaeril Bound and Willing being unknown to the public, rumors slowly spread that it was authored by Bannermere, a shy young Herald to whom it became common knowledge (much to his embarrassment) had penned salacious chapbooks often sold as far as Scornubel and Waterdeep. Beyond the identity of the author, people speculated in hushed whispers that the Dragon Queen herself secretly enjoyed the salacious work, owing to rumors of her love for whips and chains. Filfaeril Obarskyr, however, remained silent on the topic."
