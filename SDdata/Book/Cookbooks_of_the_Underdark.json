        "mainbody": "'''''Cookbooks of the Underdark''''' was a set of four volumes of [[drow]] cookbooks that covered such diverse ingredients as [[mushroom]]s, [[fungus]], [[mold]]s, spores, and even meats, penned some years before [[1371 DR]].{{LCRB}}",
        "Description": "Each of these tomes was bound in a high quality expensive [[lizardhide]].",
        "Contents": "The set consisted of four volumes, each collected at least ten recipes with detailed instructions and other relevant information that could be a valuable boon for any, even the most skilled cookery artisan. Volume I was simply titled ''Mushrooms''. It included such recipes as [[mushroom paste]], [[mushroom steak]], [[spiced mushroom soup]], [[sautéed mushrooms]], [[fungus-breaded mushrooms]], [[mushroom salad]], [[spidermeat-stuffed mushrooms]], [[boiled mushroom surprise]], [[slivered k'li mushrooms]], and, of corse, [[mushroom gravy]]. Volume II was titled ''Fungus'' and listed recipes for [[hot fungus cereal]], [[dried fungus treat]], [[scalloped gray fungus]], [[fungus in wine sauce]], [[pungent fungus rolls]], [[spongy fungi dip]], [[marinated fungus spread]], [[fungus cake]], [[fragrant fungi pie]], and [[fungus fingers]]. Book III was alluringly named ''Molds and Spores''. The recipes included were: [[fried mold muffins under glass]], [[thick mold pudding]], [[golden moldies]], [[moldenberry sauce]], [[glazed mold with spore icing]], [[chocolate spores]], [[mold and spore casserole]], [[spore delights]], [[fluffy spore cake]], and the most appetizing of the bunch – [[moldy bread]]. Lastly, Volume IV – ''Meat Lovers'', included such foods as [[steamed mice casserole]], [[hot rat haunches]], [[batwing salad & spore dressing]], [[eyeless fish steaks]], [[sauteed bat-rat turnovers]], [[carrion crawler soup]], [[glazed cave cricket tenders]], [[minced kobold flanks]], [[pureed slug over otyugh roast]], and [[twice-basted stirge]].",
        "History": "''Cookbooks of the Underdark'' were recovered from the buried and abandoned [[Temple of Lolth (Vast)|Temple of Lolth]] near the trail that led to the town of [[Mossbridges]] in the Vast in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. The [[wizard]] named [[Tromor Zem]] hired a team of adventurers from the Living City to delve into the ruined temple's depths. The ''Cookbooks of the Underdark'' were discovered alongside ''[[Rourathek's spellbook]]'' in a [[spider]]-infested ''[[web]]bed'' room. The books were believed to had been taken to the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] by the hiring adventurers after the task was completed."
