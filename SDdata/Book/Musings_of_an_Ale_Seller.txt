'''''Musings of an Ale Seller''''' was a book written by [[Havandus Haeratchur]] and published in [[1340 DR]].

{{quote|''In my days thus far, Iâ€™ve observed three things that beset all kings: laws that trip them up or are used against them; the plottings of traitors, scheming to weaken and shame them and bring them into the dark regard of their subjects ere the plots turn to their bloody removal from the scene; and those very same murderous fates that befall them. Yet do they not deserve it? After all, the dooms of kings are always a lot more bother for all than the killings of mere bakers, foresters, and cobblers.''|An excerpt from ''Musings of an Ale Seller''}}
