'''''The True and Impossible Adventures of Tenebrux Morrow''''' was a fictional series about a real-life [[Waterdhavian]] ship captain, [[Tenebrux Morrow]], and her ''[[spelljammer]]'' the ''[[New Bride]]'', and their shared adventures across the various [[planes of existence]].

==Description==
The volumes of ''The True and Impossible Adventures'' were thin editions, and in some cases cheaply made.

==Content==
===Volume 1===
The first volume of the pulp adventure series took Captain Morrow and the ''New Bride'' to the shifting tides of the [[Astral Plane]]. There, the crew came face-to-face with a [[red dragon]]-riding [[githyanki]] [[knight]]s. One of the knights lost their mount in the battle and found themselves aboard the ''New Bride'', ready to spill blood, if not for a faithful cabin-boy. Norls the [[tabaxi]] clawed and bit at the knight. Whilst in the Astral Plane, Norls' attacks were fruitless against the gith and only by a miracle, the tabaxi avoided the ''[[Silver Sword of Gith|Silver Sword]]'' oh so close to severing his spiritual anchoring cord. Tenebrux Morrow herself, however, was on the Astral Plane in her full physical form and valiantly defeated the githyanki knight in a duel, sending them tumbling into the endless Astral Sea. But the danger did not pass, as a flock of dragon rose from the [[Tu'narath]] citadel looming in the distance.

===Volume 2===
In the second volume of the series, Captain Morrow and the ''New Bride'' traveled into the [[Feywild]], the realm of the [[eladrin]]. She shared the story of how, when her crew was reveling in song with their [[fey]] hosts, their ship's resident smith sang in a resonant voice that sounded out over those of the eladrin. The offense was a great insult to the proud fey people. In recompense, Captain Morrow left the [[halfling]] smith behind, to a life of indentured servitude. The ''New Bride's'' smith was said to have been directed to forge a blade that "sang for the eladrin more sweetly than she."

===Volume 3===
Following its voyage to the Feywild, the ''New Bride'' traveled next into the dark domain of [[Barovia]]. The mists maligning the [[Domain of Dread]] afflicted the crew almost instantly. Some members threw themselves over the sides of the ship while others were merely reduced to sobbing messes. Captain Morrow tried to navigate the domain herself, alone at the ship's helm, singing a shanty that carried far and wide through the mists. In a short time, Baron [[Strahd von Zarovich]] himself appeared before the vessel. After threatening each other with utter annihilation, Strahd and Captain Morrow found they had much in common and were true "kindred spirits". Strahd left his new friend with the parting gift of new teethâ€”presumably the enlarged fangs associated with [[vampirism]].

===Volume 4===
After Barovia, Captain Morrow and the ''New Bride'' earned a contract to infiltrate the palace of Lord [[Primus]], ruler of [[Mechanus]]. The Supreme Modron wished to study how mortals behaved, and Captain Morrow gladly obliged by leaving her entire crew behind, save one member. In exchange, Primus offered to identify which member of her crew proved to be a traitor.

Some time later, Captain Morrow enjoyed a leisurely float through the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] with [[New Bride#Inhabitants|Erules]], the ''New Bride's'' [[goblin]] tinkerer. The pair enjoyed their relaxing time in the skies thanks to their matching ''[[ring of command|rings of command]]''. Once Morrow relayed the reasoning for abandoning his crew on Primus, she promptly plucked Erules' ring off her finger and left to the howling wings and eddies of the Elemental Plane. The captain vowed to one day in the future return for her once-loyal friend.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, two volumes of the series could be found within the [[Shattered Sanctum]] on the [[Sword Coast]]. Yet another volume was in the [[Riverside Teahouse]] of Auntie [[Ethel]], in the [[Sunlit Wetlands]].
