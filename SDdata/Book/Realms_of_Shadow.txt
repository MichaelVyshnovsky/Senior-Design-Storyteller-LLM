'''''Realms of Shadow''''', edited by [[Lizz Baldwin]], is the eighth anthology of stories from the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', published in April 2002. The stories follow the [[Return of the Archwizards]] trilogy and many are about the lost nation of [[Netheril]] and the [[Shade Enclave]].
{{Quote|
When Shade Enclave returns from thousands of years of exile in the [[Plane of Shadow]], all of [[Faerûn]] is open to its dark designs.

When a tribe of [[kenku (winged)|kenku]] confront the archwizard who gave them magic but kept them as slaves, the skies rain death.

When a [[Purple Dragon Knight|knight]] of [[Cormyr]] journeys to the ruins of [[Tilverton]], he begins to understand the terrifying power of the archwizards.

When [[phaerimm]] roam the world, enslaving [[orc]] and [[human]] alike, the great powers of the world must depend on an ally as deadly as their enemy.

Featuring new stories by best-selling {{SmallCaps|Forgotten Realms}} authors, including R. A. Salvatore, Troy Denning, Ed Greenwood, and Elaine Cunningham.

The action shifted to Cy, one of Olostin's raiders. During an attack on the [[Low Netheril|Low Netherese]] village of Kath, Cy killed a powerful, chain-wielding man. Having seen his valor, Cy's commander Lume recruited him to assassinate Shadow. Cy took a two day long griffon ride to the floating city [[Eileanar|Karsus]]. He failed to assassinate Shadow but learned Shadow had a powerful wand, before he escaped while another group attempted to kill Shadow. When he returned to Lume, the commander revealed he had sent countless others to accomplish the same task, and Cy was the only one ever to return. They went together to try again, against Cy's better judgment. Lume stole and used the wand, but it backfired and killed him instead of Shadow.

In the [[Anauroch]], the merchant mercenary [[Avarilous]] and his companion Garmansder were caught in a dust storm with lightning that killed their camel. While they bemoaned their fate, a tribe of [[Bedine]] arrived. Their leader Sheik Omar Lhassa Bin-Daar had been looking for Avarilous, and Avarilous knew this. The Sheik hired the pair to stop a [[Zhentarim]] excavation looking for magic items near ruins of [[Hlondath]], and prevent them from allying with the newly arrived [[Shadovar]]. The pair faked their way into the Zhentarim camp, and killed the leader after discovering he was not smart enough to be behind the operation. On death, the lieutenant who had been pulling the strings was revealed to be a Shadovar agent, and the real purpose of the site was to create an access to one of the [[Buried Realms]], and gain a horde of ancient [[Netheril]] magic there.  Garmansder collapsed the scaffolding using smokepowder charges, and the two escaped, with potential plans to sell the information about the foiled plot to [[Khelben Arunsun]] in [[Waterdeep]].
