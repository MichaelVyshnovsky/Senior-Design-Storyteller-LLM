'''''Lords of Darkness''''' is a 1{{st}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory that was set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. 
{{Quote|''The [[undead]]. Denied the eternal rest of Death, cursed to wander the many [[plane]]s and worlds forever, their very existence a mockery of the life they constantly crave yet cannot have. Created by the foulest magics, they have only one thought, one burning goal; revenge against the living. Or do they?''

Lords of Darkness ''is an anthology of short adventures set in various locations in the Forgotten Realms, though you don't need the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign supplement to use them. Some of gaming's best designers have contributed adventures to this collection, which feature undead of all types and descriptions in all sorts of situations-from [[skeleton]]s to [[vampire]]s and worse, from graveyards to haunted houses, and even a few places you may never have expected to find undead.''

''These adventures can be used one at a time, inserted into an existing campaign as a change of pace, or they can be the basis for an entirely new campaign. Either way,'' Lords of Darkness ''will be sure to give AD&D game players plenty of chills and excitement.''}}

==Description==
''Lords of Darkness'' discussed the origins and goals of the [[undead]]. It's purpose is to provide short adventures involving undead that can be easily inserted into a campaign.

''Lords of Darkness'' is a collection of ten mini-scenarios set in the Forgotten Realms, all featuring undead monsters such as [[skeleton]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[wight]]s, [[shadow]]s, [[mummy|mummies]], [[vampire]]s, and [[ghost]]s; the book also includes suggestions on how to role-play undead and a section called "''A Mundane Guide to Wards vs. Undead, Spirits, and Other Entities''". The anthology includes adventures and background information dealing with most of the undead monsters commonly encountered in the AD&D game, and although sold as a ''Forgotten Realms'' accessory, it is usable with any AD&D campaign.

The book's purpose is to provide short adventures involving undead that can be easily inserted into a campaign. Each of the featured undead has background information provided in the form of either a short piece of fiction describing the undead in action or delivered as a monologue by a knowledgeable non-player character (NPC). New game rules in the book contain additional information and clarify existing game mechanics. The book begins by discussing ways in which undead creatures' energy-draining attacks can be made less devastating to a player character (PC) by using alternatives to the usual level-draining effect. 

The adventures in ''Lords of Darkness'' are designed to be easily dropped into an ongoing campaign, and are mainly dungeon crawls of one form or another. The book introduces the optional rules on Horror Checks, which are made when characters realize just how horrible a monster really is; long-term effects can result from failed checks. Another section discusses the effects that items and substances such as cold iron, garlic, salt, and mirrors have against undead. Also included are new spells for magic-users who choose to specialize in the [[Necromancy|necromantic arts]].

''Lords of Darkness'' features a two-page introduction by [[Ed Greenwood]]. It explains that, while the book is set in the ''Forgotten Realms'' setting, it can be used in different fantasy campaign settings. The introduction gives details on undead in the ''Forgotten Realms'', advice for a Dungeon Master to use undead in a campaign, alternatives to some of the more deadly powers of the undead, and information on non-evil types of undead.

"Tales From Beyond the Grave" presents ten complete adventure scenarios, each one highlighting a "classic" undead type, with the challenges increasing from one scenario to the next. Creature notes accompany each adventure. The scenarios are from five to nine pages each, and include the following: "Skeletons", by Deborah Christian; "Zombies", by Michael Stackpole; "Ghouls and Ghasts", by Jennell Jaquays; "The Tombs of Deckon Thar", by Steve Perrin; "Shadows", by Christian; "Mummies", by Jaquays; "Vampires", by Vince Garcia and Jean Rabe; "Ghosts", by Garcia; "Oriental Spectres", by Christian; and "The Dread Lair of Alokkair", by Greenwood.

"The Night Gallery" details the main character or creature of each adventure and can be used to plan a series of encounters. "A Mundane Guide to Wards", by Greenwood, explores the magic and lore of dealing with undead. "The Lords of Darkness", by Greenwood, presents new spells for necromancers.
