'''''The Soul Forger''''' was a religious [[book]] dedicated to the [[deity]] [[Moradin]] the All-Father, penned sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|Dwarven myths are so engaging because the skeleton of their story is tied to a craft of the modern era. The bones are made of [[steel]], [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], a whole host of [[metal]]s alloyed and superheated and fused together at the joints of legend.<br/>Moradin, Soul Forger, All-Father, is said to have crafted the dwarven species from the very core of the planet [[Abeir-Toril]]. By retelling this story, [[dwarves]] link themselves to the craft of blacksmithing; they have, in one fell swoop, tapped an ore-vein of metaphor and discovered a seam of cultural import.<br/>For dwarves are not born so industrious, so stoneworthy, so clever at geology. Rather, unlike the growth of long bushy beards, it is learned behavior.|An excerpt from the introduction to ''The Soul Forger''.}}

==Content==
The book opened with an introduction chapter that attributed Moradin's widespread worship and abundance of [[dwarvish]] myths to the fact that much of them are at the very core of modern crafting and the art of the forge. The introduction also stated that Moradin forged the dwarves from the materials of the center of Abeir-Toril.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''The Soul Forger'' was stored among the many religious books available to the guests of the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]], a non-denominational shrine in [[Baldur's Gate]].
