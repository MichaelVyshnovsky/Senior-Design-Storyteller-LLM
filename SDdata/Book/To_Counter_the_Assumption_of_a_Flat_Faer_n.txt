'''''To Counter the Assumption of a Flat Faerûn''''' was a scientific publication by an unknown author that rebuffed the ancient convention that [[Toril]] was flat. The [[book]] was written some time long before [[1374 DR]].

==Contents==
The tome began by discussing the ancient theory that the world was a flat surface. This belief was as old as [[Faerûn]]'s recorded history. The author mentioned that, even after [[magnet]]s were discovered and the theory of gravity was formulated in the old empire of [[Illefarn]], [[sage]]s still believed that objects were held on the surface of the world through magical force that was applied to all living things by [[Mystra]]'s [[Weave]].

To disprove the flat Faerûn theory, the author talked about [[Karsus's Folly]], the cataclysm of ancient [[Netheril]] in which the [[archmage]] [[Karsus]] disrupted the Weave as he failed to become a deity in Mystra's place. The proof was that despite the Weave being damaged, no creatures flew into the sky, freed from being bound to the surface of Toril. Hence, the author claimed that gravity was not a force of magic. Furthermore, the book cited individuals who traveled around and across Toril over land and sea. Another fact that disproved the flat Faerûn theory was the records of the [[wizard]] [[Icarian]], whose journal recorded his travel around the world through magical means of flight.

The author voiced their frustration that, despite the self-evident facts listed above, some still believed that the world was flat instead of admitting that the world's true shape was that of a [[ring]] or a [[doughnut]]. The rest of the book was a collection of facts and explanations that the author thought to be undisputed proof of the world's toroidal shape.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a copy of ''To Counter the Assumption of a Flat Faerûn'' was kept in the [[Archives|Neverwinter Archives]] of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. However, the portion of that copy that proved the world's true shape was mysteriously burned off.
