To Counter the Assumption of a Flat Faerûn was a scientific publication by an unknown author that rebuffed the ancient convention that Toril was flat. The book was written some time long before 1374 DR.
The tome began by discussing the ancient theory that the world was a flat surface. This belief was as old as Faerûns recorded history. The author mentioned that, even after magnets were discovered and the theory of gravity was formulated in the old empire of Illefarn, sages still believed that objects were held on the surface of the world through magical force that was applied to all living things by Mystras Weave.
To disprove the flat Faerûn theory, the author talked about Karsuss Folly, the cataclysm of ancient Netheril in which the archmage Karsus disrupted the Weave as he failed to become a deity in Mystras place. The proof was that despite the Weave being damaged, no creatures flew into the sky, freed from being bound to the surface of Toril. Hence, the author claimed that gravity was not a force of magic. Furthermore, the book cited individuals who traveled around and across Toril over land and sea. Another fact that disproved the flat Faerûn theory was the records of the wizard Icarian, whose journal recorded his travel around the world through magical means of flight.
The author voiced their frustration that, despite the self-evident facts listed above, some still believed that the world was flat instead of admitting that the worlds true shape was that of a ring or a doughnut. The rest of the book was a collection of facts and explanations that the author thought to be undisputed proof of the worlds toroidal shape.
As of the , a copy of To Counter the Assumption of a Flat Faerûn was kept in the Neverwinter Archives of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North. However, the portion of that copy that proved the worlds true shape was mysteriously burned off.
