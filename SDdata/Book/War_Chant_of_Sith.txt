'''''War Chant of Sith''''' was a powerful war song empowered by a [[bard]]'s [[magic]].

==Content==
The chant's powerful magics became apparent when a talented bard began to sing it in battle. The bard's allies who heard the performance received an improved defense; any damage dealt to them was reduced as if by magic, and they began to ''[[regenerate]]'', slowly healing any wounds on their bodies.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''War Chant of Sith'' was performed only by the most experienced bards of the North. It was heard being performed in the [[Ten-Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]] and the village of [[Kuldahar]].
