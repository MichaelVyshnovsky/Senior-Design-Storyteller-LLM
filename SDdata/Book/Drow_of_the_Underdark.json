Everything you want to know about drow and their subterranean homeland&mdash;as well as some things you didn't know&mdash;can be found in this tome. This supplement is intended for players who want to play drow characters and Dungeon Masters who want to run ''D&amp;D'' adventures and campaigns featuring drow.''}}",

        "Description": "Unlike the 2{{nd}}-edition accessory of the [[The Drow of the Underdark|same name]], ''Drow of the Underdark'' is not tied to any specific campaign setting. It was primarily intended for DM use, however players can use information from the book to play as a drow character or half-drow character, as well as to fight against drow, or to adventure in the [[Underdark]] in general.\n\nThe first chapter contains general information about drow and contains few rules other than drow racial traits. A guide to drow names and their meanings is also included.\nThe following  chapter contains new uses for various skills, new feats (including general, metamagic, ambush, divine, vile, and weapon style feats), alternate class features for many classes, and new spells and invocations (some of which require the user to be a drow). The new prestige classes found in the third chapter include Arachnomancer, Cavestalker, Demonbinder, Dread Fang of Lolth, Eye of Lolth, Insidious Corrupter, and Kinslayer. Each prestige class also contains a sample NPC ready for quick use.\n\nChapter four contains new mundane, alchemical, and magic items, along with poisons, magic-infused poisons, and artifacts. Numerous new monsters are presented in chapter five, including the [[deep dragon]], [[troll]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[draegloth]]. There are also numerous ready-to-use drow NPC statistics. Statistics for one monster, the [[vril]], were accidentally left out of the book.",
