It was primarily intended for DM use, however players can use information from the book to play as a drow character or half-drow character, as well as to fight against drow, or to adventure in the Underdark in general.\nThe first chapter contains general information about drow and contains few rules other than drow racial traits. A guide to drow names and their meanings is also included.\nThe following  chapter contains new uses for various skills, new feats (including general, metamagic, ambush, divine, vile, and weapon style feats), alternate class features for many classes, and new spells and invocations (some of which require the user to be a drow). The new prestige classes found in the third chapter include Arachnomancer, Cavestalker, Demonbinder, Dread Fang of Lolth, Eye of Lolth, Insidious Corrupter, and Kinslayer. Each prestige class also contains a sample NPC ready for quick use.\nChapter four contains new mundane, alchemical, and magic items, along with poisons, magic-infused poisons, and artifacts. Numerous new monsters are presented in chapter five, including the deep dragon, trolls, goblins, and draegloth. There are also numerous ready-to-use drow NPC statistics. Statistics for one monster, the vril, were accidentally left out of the book.\nDrow of the Underdark Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Designers Robert J. Schwalb, Ari Marmell, Anthony Pryor, Greg A.
