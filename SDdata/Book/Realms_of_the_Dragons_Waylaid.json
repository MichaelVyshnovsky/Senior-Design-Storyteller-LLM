She is kidnapped by the [[white dragon]] [[Torixileos]], who presses her into his service. Back at his lair, Torixileos bids Lynaelle retrieve a wounded orc thief for him to feast on. When the orc turns out to be a juvenile [[silver dragon]] in disguise, Lynaelle realizes Torixileos is the actual thief, and that the lair is not his to begin with. The silver dragon's mother, [[Symarra Brightmoon]], arrives and chases off the white. It turns out Symarra is an old friend of [[Ambriel]], Lynaelle's mentor in the [[magic|Art]].",
