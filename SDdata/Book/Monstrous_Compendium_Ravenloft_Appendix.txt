{{Quote|They lurk in the shadows. They linger in your dreams. They strike from the darkness.

They are foul and horrible creatures that dwell in the dark dimension of Ravenloft and they are waiting for you. Inside this book are elven vampires, the dreaded Dark Ones who have broken the trust of Vistani, and dozens of other creatures sure to add a taste of fear into every Ravenloft campaign.

But be warned, those who enter the Mists of Ravenloft are seldom heard from again...}}
