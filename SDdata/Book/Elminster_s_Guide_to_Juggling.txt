Elminsters Guide to Juggling was a book written by the famed sage Elminster, with a self-explanatory title.
The books content was based on Elminsters own extensive research and experience (no doubt aided by his exceptionally long and varied life). A person who read the instructions carefully was put on the path to become a master juggler of three balls at once, and potentially more exotic jugglables as well.
