'''''Elminster's Guide to Juggling''''' was a book written by the famed sage [[Elminster]], with a self-explanatory title.

==Contents==
The book's content was based on Elminster's own extensive research and experience (no doubt aided by his exceptionally long and varied life). A person who read the instructions carefully was put on the path to become a master juggler of three balls at once, and potentially more exotic [[jugglables]] as well.
