        "mainbody": "he Psionics Handbook was a sourcebook for core 3-edition Dungeons & Dragons by Bruce R. Cordell, detailing the system of psionics.\n* Introduction\n* Chapter 1 Psionic Classes\n* Chapter 2 Skills\n* Chapter 3 Feats\n* Chapter 4 Psionics\n* Chapter 5 Powers\n* Chapter 6 Characters\n* Chapter 7 Psionic Items\n* Chapter 8 Monsters\nThe Psionics Handbook adapted the psionics concept for third edition, with a new emphasis on balance and playability. The book mixed elements from previous versions of the game (such as Power Points from second edition) along with a number of innovations like linking the system closer to the new system of D&D as well as balance changes such as removing the randomness that had characterized the original system. \nOne of the key innovations was integrating the psionics system into the feats and class system that third edition emphasized. In the earlier editions most characters had a small chance to receive psionic powers as an extra set of abilities a lucky character could receive powers that were equivalents of magical spells that were not available until mid-to-high levels. In 3.0 characters must take psionic classes or feats to access the abilities forcing a player to forgo other abilities in exchange for psionic powers.\nThe material in the Psionics Handbook was updated for the 3.5 edition in the Expanded Psionics Handbook.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n* Psionic Handbook Design Bruce R.
