        "History": "In [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, a ''Trumpeter'' clerk – [[Myra Miller]], received a mention in that month's issue of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter''. After the offices of the gazette were ransacked and torched (evidently by [[Talassan]]s) while the staff was away at the local printer's shop, Myra showed quick thinking and managed to save the organization's documents from being destroyed. Despite Myra Miller's best efforts, all reports of the summer meteor crisis of the {{YearlinkName|1367}} were lost.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, one of the casualties in the recent gang war was [[Borrek Halloway]], a journalist who worked for ''The Trumpeter's'' ninth shift editor [[Damien Blackthorn]]. Borrek was just the latest among a series of grizzly killings, and a group of the Living City adventurers answered a summoning from the editor and accepted his contract to uncover the truth behind the victim's death. Borrek's killing could've been the result of his work on such investigative pieces as ''Corruption in the City Government'', ''Bribery in the City Watch'', ''Merchant's Guild Inflating Prices'', and ''Organized Criminal Guilds: Parasites of Society''.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, ''The Trumpeter's'' best investigative reporter, Tara Strongquill, fell victim to a kidnapping by the notorious chaos agent named [[Locaath Blackmanta]]. The kidnapping was a stunt aimed to sew panic in Ravens Bluff. The ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter'' hired a band of adventurers to find the culprit and rescue the unlucky supporter.{{Cite organized play/LC/News of the World|31}}",
