Pools of Darkness, by James Ward and Anne K. Brown, is the second book of The Heroes of Phlan trilogy. It is loosely based on the Pools of Darkness computer game.
Bane steals numerous cities from the Moonsea, including Phlan. Shal Bal and Tarl defend the city while Ren o the Blade, along with the wizard Evaine, her cat familiar Gamaliel, the undead paladin Miltiades, and the druids Androlson and Telenthia attempt to find the city. Androlson turns himself into a tree to counter Baneâ€™s corruption on a forest, but the others successfully kill Tanetal, the fiend commanding attacks on the city, and Marcus, the Red Wizard who conjured him, purify the Pool of Darkness, and restore the cities. Tyr erases the memories of this incident from the general population, allowing the trauma to fade but the heroes to remember.
