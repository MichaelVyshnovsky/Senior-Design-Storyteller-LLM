'''''Pools of Darkness''''', by [[James Ward]] and [[Anne K. Brown]], is the second book of [[The Heroes of Phlan trilogy|The Heroes of Phlan trilogy.]] It is loosely based on the [[Pools of Darkness (game)|Pools of Darkness]] computer game.

{{quote|''The entire city of [[Phlan]] has vanished, ripped from the surface of [[Toril]] by dire creatures and magical forces. While the minions of the evil god [[Bane]] bicker over the spoils, the brave citizens of Phlan mount a stubborn defense.

A ranger-thief named [[Ren o' the Blade|Ren]] seeks his missing friends, [[Shal Desanea|Shal]] and [[Tarl Desanea|Tarl]], spellcasters nonpareil. Ren must band together with a mysterious sorceress, [[Evaine]], and her intrepid shapeshifter [[Gamaliel|cat]], as well as a couple of droll druids and a fearful [[Miltiades|knight]] who is absolutely, positively dead.''}}

==Summary==
[[Bane]] steals numerous cities from the [[Moonsea]], including [[Phlan]]. [[Shal Desanea|Shal Bal]] and [[Tarl Desanea|Tarl]] defend the city while [[Ren o' the Blade]], along with the [[wizard]] [[Evaine]], her cat [[familiar]] [[Gamaliel]], the [[undead]] [[paladin]] [[Miltiades]], and the [[Druid|druids]] Androlson and Telenthia attempt to find the city. Androlson turns himself into a tree to counter Baneâ€™s corruption on a forest, but the others successfully kill Tanetal, the fiend commanding attacks on the city, and Marcus, the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] who conjured him, purify the Pool of Darkness, and restore the cities. [[Tyr]] erases the memories of this incident from the general population, allowing the trauma to fade but the heroes to remember.
