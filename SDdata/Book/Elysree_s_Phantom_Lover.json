        "mainbody": "Elysrees Phantom Lover was an infamous ballad about Harper Elysree Csimaree of Berdusk and a watchghost who followed her and watched over her in the Harpers travels, penned sometime in or before the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAccording to the ballad, Elysree Csimarees unsleeping guardian was a benevolent watchghost. One could assume the song was not based, in fact, as Elysree Csimaree was ready to attack anyone uttering a single note of the song or even humming it in their presence."
