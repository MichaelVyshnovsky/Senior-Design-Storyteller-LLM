Sages and Specialists is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.
Sages and Specialists is the 8 book in the Dungeon Masters Guide Rules series.
The accessory is divided into two main sections. The first section focuses on ten different types of specialists, including sages, each described in its own chapter. Although specialists are designed to be NPCs, the chapters treat each specialist as if it were a player character class to facilitate the Dungeon Masters job.
The second section explains how to incorporate these specialists into the game. With the DMs permission, players can create specialists with whom they can interact. These NPCs can advance in level and power alongside the adventurer if they receive support from the hero. Conversely, if neglected, the hero may return to find the once-helpful specialist too "busy" to assist.
Alternatively, DMs can limit their players access to this book, ensuring that characters remain uncertain about their associates levels of experience. However, most of the information within this book will not spoil any campaign.
