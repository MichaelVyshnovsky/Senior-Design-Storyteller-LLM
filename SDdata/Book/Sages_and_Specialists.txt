'''''Sages and Specialists''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory.

{{Quote|''In the dangerous, fast-paced world of adventuring, knowledge means survival. In an age of legends, even the greatest heroes need technical advisors. Inside Sages & Specialists you'll find ten new NPC specialist classes-from apothecary to seer, from engineer to scribe- each with his own special talents and insights. In addition, this book contains a host of new rules that directly affect the lives of PCs everywhere. Add depth to your campaign with these unique and three-dimensional NPCs.''}}

==Description==
''Sages and Specialists'' is the 8{{th}} book in the [[DMGR series|Dungeon Master's Guide Rules series]].

The accessory is divided into two main sections. The first section focuses on ten different types of specialists, including sages, each described in its own chapter. Although specialists are designed to be NPCs, the chapters treat each specialist as if it were a player character class to facilitate the Dungeon Master's job.

The second section explains how to incorporate these specialists into the game. With the DM's permission, players can create specialists with whom they can interact. These NPCs can advance in level and power alongside the adventurer if they receive support from the hero. Conversely, if neglected, the hero may return to find the once-helpful specialist too "busy" to assist.

Alternatively, DMs can limit their players' access to this book, ensuring that characters remain uncertain about their associates' levels of experience. However, most of the information within this book will not spoil any campaign.
