{{quote|While on my way to [[Eshpurta]], whistling up a tune,<br/>While on my way to Eshpurta, a red-haired damsel I did spy,<br/>Her lips a smile, her hair aglow, her eyes as bright as the moon<br/>Saying, "Laddie, mine, won't you come nigh, the army here is wry.<br/>I wouldn't care, but ye look sae fair, laddie don't go to town."|An excerpt from ''The Day I Joined the Army''}}
