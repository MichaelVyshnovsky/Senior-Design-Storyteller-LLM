As the product was adapted to the Realms using Ed Greenwoods first materials sent over to TSR, it is taken to predate the rest of the 1st edition products, which were set in 1357, but to be set close enough in time that those would remain valid. Furthermore, per the timeline in the Forgotten Realms Conspectus, Elminster "retired" to Shadowdale in 1350. The package addressed to Elminster in Gnoll Pass that kicks off the adventure must be headed either north to the Dalelands or south to Cormyr. As the package would most likely not have come from the north, being originally from Bralizzar, it is assumed to be headed north, to the Dalelands, implying Elminster, the addressee, has chosen a permanent residence. Thus, as it is likely after 1350 and before 1357, the date of 1356 is chosen.

Desert of Desolation is a compilation adventure module for 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. 
Desert of Desolation combines the three previously published individual modules Pharaoh, Oasis of the White Palm, and Lost Tomb of Martek, which were produced for use with the 1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules.
Each module is an Egyptian-styled adventure.  The individual modules were well received by critics at the time of their release, and the compilation has garnered accolades in the 2000s.
Pharaoh was created by Tracy and Laura Hickman soon after they were wed in 1977, and published by TSR in 1982.  Oasis of the White Palm was a collaboration between Tracy Hickman and Philip Meyers, while Tracy Hickman wrote Lost Tomb of Martek both were printed in 1983.  It was the first TSR product to have the "Forgotten Realms" imprint.

Pharaoh is an Egyptian-styled adventure that includes a pyramid map and a trap-filled maze. Cover art was provided by Jim Holloway.Tracy and Laura Hickman. Pharaoh (TSR, 1982), ISBN 0-888038-007-1  In Pharaoh, the player characters are driven into the desert for a crime they did not commit. The characters journey to the sunken city of Pazar, and from there they travel to the haunted tomb of an ancient pharaoh. While in the desert, the characters encounter the spirit of Amun-Re, the last pharaoh of Bakar, cursed to wander the desert until his tomb is robbed. Amun-Re begs the PCs to remove his staff of ruling and the Star of Mo-Pelar from his tomb to break his curse. The tomb was built to be thief-proof, and has so far lived up to its reputation.  While in Amun-Res pyramid, the characters can use an item called the Dome of Flight to control or reverse gravity carelessness can cause them to fall upwards, and the palm trees in this room bear exploding fruit. The module contains wilderness maps, and includes a number of smaller adventures which complement the main one.
In Oasis of the White Palm, the characters arrive at the Oasis of the White Palm, which is on the brink of turmoil. Shadalah, who is to be the bride of the shieks eldest son, has been kidnapped. The shiek believes her to be held by his enemies somewhere in the oasis. The player characters must solve a mystery before they can progress further. Once the characters make the contacts they need at the oasis, they continue to the Temple of Set and the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak, and the adventure concludes in the City of Phoenix there, the PCs must obtain the three Star Gems (the one from Amun-Res tomb in the previous adventure, and two more introduced here) and free the djinni if they plan to move on to the next module.Meyers, Philip and Tracy Hickman. Oasis of the White Palm (TSR, 1983) The Oasis of the White Palm module contains wilderness maps, and includes a number of smaller adventures which complement the main one.
The goal of the player characters is the tomb of the millennium-dead wizard Martek. The tomb lies in the vast Desert of Desolation, and the majority of the adventure takes place within Marteks tomb.Hickman, Tracy Raye. Lost Tomb of Martek (TSR, 1983)
