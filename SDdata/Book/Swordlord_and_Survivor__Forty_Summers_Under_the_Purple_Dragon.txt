{{quote|''Afterward, the greatest victories always look like the work of brilliant warcaptains. In the midst of the fray, they're just as much cursing and slipping and tangles of death and disaster as the greatest defeats. The trick is to wind up among those who survive such battles relatively unmaimed.<br/>The [[god]]s reward those who die gloriously in their service. The rest of us have to reward ourselves.''|Excerpt from ''Swordlord and Survivor''}}
