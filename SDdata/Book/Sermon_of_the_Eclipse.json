        "mainbody": "he Sermon of the Eclipse was a religious text written by the Lathanderian prophet Rhyester in 760 DR, and read at the Lathanders Dawn temple during the solar eclipse that same year.\nThe sermon was written with the intent of being performed during the solar eclipse of 760 DR, though the lessons within it remained highly applicable outside of that very short period. The sermon affirmed the Lathanderian tenets of optimism, hope, and creativity in the face of failure and setbacks, and described how even negative outcomes could lead to new opportunities and positivity. It also used the mystery of the Dawn Cataclysm as an example of how cause and effect could be confused by observers, how events could metaphysically affect each other, and how the affairs of the divine could be learned from and used in daily mortal life.\nCiting the Vision of the Ten Suns, Rhyester reiterated that it was only after enduring trials that one could rise from them, and it was those trials that changed the world to something new, rather than keeping an enduring stasis. The sermon also included a reading from Carcellas Readings at the Matins to examine the founding of the church."
