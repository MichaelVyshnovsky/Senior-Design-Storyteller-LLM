| realm year   = [[1374 DR]]<ref group="note">No date is given in the module. Its depiction of Melvaunt has very different noble leaders, their internal politics, and temples than that given in other sources, such as ''[[Mysteries of the Moonsea]]'', which was printed a year later. Therefore, it's assumed ''Sons'' is set after ''Mysteries'', which is set in the later half of [[1373 DR]]. Moreover, ''Sons''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> temple of Tyr has been present "for only a year" and is not apparent in ''Mysteries''. Ergo, ''Sons of Gruumsh'' is assumed to be set in mid- or late 1374 DR. This is also a common setting date for late 2005 sourcebooks.
