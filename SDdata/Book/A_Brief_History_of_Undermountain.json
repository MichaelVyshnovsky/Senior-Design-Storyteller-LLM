        "mainbody": "Brief History of Undermountain was a book penned by the historian of the Clangeddins Hearth, Daizez. in the mid-14 century DR.\nA Brief History of Undermountain told the story of the construction of Undermountain by the dwarves of Clan Melairkyn. The book claimed the clan left the dungeon after the mithral they were prospecting started to become scarce. Undermountain was abandoned for the monsters and drow to claim. The dark elves held ownership of the mega-dungeon for the millennia, which followed until Halaster Blackcloaks arrival. The book went on telling how the Mad Mage expanded Undermountain in the thousand years that followed.\nThe final chapter of the book told of the Mad Mages disappearance in the Halasters Higharvestide and called for the  Undermountains reclamation by the surviving clan members and the dwarf followers of Clangeddin Silverbeard.\nOne copy of the book was recovered from the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Undermountain, following the Clangeddins Hearths massacre in 1370 DR."
