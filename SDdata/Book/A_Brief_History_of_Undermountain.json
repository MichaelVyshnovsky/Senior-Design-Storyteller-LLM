        "mainbody": "'''''A Brief History of Undermountain''''' was a book [[pen]]ned by the historian of the [[Clangeddin's Hearth]], [[Daizez]]. in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Contents": "''A Brief History of Undermountain'' told the story of the construction of [[Undermountain]] by the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Clan Melairkyn]]. The book claimed the clan left the dungeon after the [[mithral]] they were prospecting started to become scarce. Undermountain was abandoned for the monsters and [[drow]] to claim. The dark elves held ownership of the mega-dungeon for the millennia, which followed until [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s arrival. The book went on telling how the Mad Mage expanded Undermountain in the thousand years that followed.\n\nThe final chapter of the book told of the Mad Mage's disappearance in the [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] and called for the  Undermountain's reclamation by the surviving clan members and the dwarf followers of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]].",
        "History": "One copy of the book was recovered from the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Undermountain, following the Clangeddin's Hearth's massacre in [[1370 DR]]."
