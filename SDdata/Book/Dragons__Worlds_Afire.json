        "mainbody": "'''''Dragons: Worlds Afire''''' is an anthology first published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 2006. Its four stories are based around the theme of [[dragon]]s and each is set in a different campaign setting: \"[[If Ever They Happened Upon My Lair]]\" by [[R.A. Salvatore]] in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', \"Here Be Dragons!\" by Margaret Weis and [[Tracy Hickman]] in ''Dragonlance'', \"Principles of Fire\" by Keith Baker in ''Eberron'', and \"Unnatural Predator\" by Scott McGough in ''Magic: The Gathering''. Of these, \"If Ever They Happened Upon My Lair\" was reprinted in ''[[The Collected Stories: The Legend of Drizzt Anthology]]''.\n\n{{Quote|\nAncient beasts imbued with magic, and prone to madness. Masters of a world where they are kings among men. Legendary creatures few have ever seen, and lived to tell the tale. Eldritch constructs bent to the service of godlike wizards. From four worlds of magic and mystery, one monster rises above all others to threaten death, offer hope, spread fear, or horde treasure. No matter what the world, only a dragon can set it, and the imaginations of millions, afire. Four of the most exciting shared worlds in the history of fantasy come together for the first time in one volume, drawn together at last by the mighty dragons of myth and legend.\n|Back-cover text}}\n\n{{Quote|''Worlds Afire'': Four worlds, five authors, seven artists, and one legendary beast.\n\nFor the first time ever, five writers from four different settings are gathered together in a single beautiful coffee table book. There is one story each from the foremost authors in the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Magic: The Gathering, and Eberron worlds. Preceding each story will be a beautiful, full-color plate illustration of a dragon.\n|Publisher's description}}"
