'''''Teachings of Loss: The Nightsinger''''' was a [[book]] of [[Sharran]] dogma, printed in the ancient times, long before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Put your faith in Shar as your champion; allow her to silence the false song in your heart and return you to her embrace. Nothingness is all you need. The eternal womb, where you are safe in the darkness, with Mother Shar.''|Excerpt from ''Teachings of Loss: The Nightsinger.''}}

==Content==
This Sharran book was stored in the library of the [[Gauntlet of Shar]], an ancient temple dedicated to the Mistress of the Night and training the [[Dark Justiciars]]. The book talked about the goddess' opposition to the [[Nightsong]] as only the Nightsinger herself could silence her. It discussed the Church's belief that the creation of light was a mistake and that life itself was naught but an illusion. Because of that, the falsehoods and lies of the discordant Nightsong disturbed Shaar's oblivion. As a Dark Justiciar, those who believed these teachings took on an unholy mission to silence the song.
