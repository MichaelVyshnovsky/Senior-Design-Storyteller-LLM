        "mainbody": "Neverwinter is the second novel in the The Neverwinter Saga series by R.A. Salvatore.\nIn 1463 DR, the drow ranger Drizzt\nDoUrden and the elf warrior Dahlia Sinfelle were in\nthe wilderness of northwestern Faerûn after an adventure in the ancient dwarven\nhomeland of Gauntlgrym. Dahlia explained to Drizzt that although the Dread\nRing, a necromantic area of devastation, in Neverwinter Wood had been diminished\nas a result of their actions in Gauntlgrym, the Thayan sorceress Sylora Salm would make it\nher priority to complete the enchanted region by any means necessary.\nTherefore, the two friends planned to eventually journey to Neverwinter\nWood and stop Sylora. Drizzt and Dahlia decided that they would first travel to\nthe port city of Luskan to learn what they could. The pair traveled swiftly toward\nLuskan with the assistance of Drizzt’s magical unicorn, Andahar. Unlike Drizzt’s other magical\ncompanion, the panther Guenhwyvar, Andahar could be summoned at any time and could\nremain on the Prime Material Plane for as long as the drow needed him. But also\nunlike the panther, Andahar could be wounded, if not outright slain, and any\ninjuries that he sustained would take as long to heal as those of a mortal\ncreature. Since Andahar had more vulnerabilities than Guenhwyvar, Drizzt was\nmuch more cautious in his use of the unicorn.\nThe two companions soon encountered\na merchant caravan that was being pursued by a group of bandits, and Drizzt\nimmediately rushed to help, but Dahlia questioned his motives. While Drizzt instinctively\nassumed that the caravan was operated by honest merchants, Dahlia, who had an\nunderstanding of the world that was different and greater than the drow even\nthough she was much younger, did not automatically come to that conclusion.\nDrizzt spoke with the merchants, who told him that they were representatives of\nthe High Captains of Luskan, the corrupt rulers of the city. Drizzt had ill feelings\ntoward the High Captains because nearly one hundred years earlier they had\nplayed a significant role in the death of the drow’s longtime friend, Deudermont, the captain\nof the Sea Sprite. While\nDrizzt quickly moved to engage the brigands, Dahlia mocked his idealistic\nbelief that everything in the world was always simply right or wrong. After defeating\nthe first few bandits, the couple learned that the brigands were starving\nfarmers who had been driven off of their lands by the High Captains’ policies,\nand they intended to rob the caravan in order to feed themselves and their\nfamilies. Drizzt and Dahlia shared a meal with the bandits, and the drow ranger\nbegan to question his ethics in the dark and chaotic times that had engulfed northwest\nFaerûn.\nMeanwhile, Sylora stood with Jestry Rallevin, an Ashmadai\nzealot and the sorceress’s new lieutenant, in front of the significantly\nweakened Dread Ring. The lich Szass Tam, the supreme ruler of Thay, appeared\nin the Dread Ring and informed Sylora that he was displeased with her efforts\nand was prepared to destroy her for her failure. Before Szass Tam could kill\nSylora and Jestry, the insane lich Valindra Shadowmantle\narrived at the Dread Ring. Although deranged, Valindra had moments of clarity\nand cunning, which she used to convince Szass Tam to spare the pair’s lives. As\na result, Szass Tam gave Sylora a magical wand that allowed her to channel the\npowers of the Dread Ring, and he commanded the sorceress to destroy the city of\nNeverwinter\nand use the carnage to complete the Dread Ring. Unbeknownst to her allies,\nValindra was in possession of the disembodied spirit of the vampire Korvin\nDorcrae, and she used his ghost as her own personal spy. When Valindra sensed\nan unusual entity on the southern outskirts of Neverwinter and decided to\ninvestigate, Sylora ordered a group of Ashmadai to accompany the lich on her\nmission. Sylora sent Jestry with the band to attend and watch over Valindra, and\nshe tempted the Ashmadai warrior with the promise of making him her lover.\nWhen he learned that Sylora’s plans\nhad been thwarted in Gauntlgrym, the Shadovar tiefling Herzgo Alegni, the commander\nof the Netherese forces in Neverwinter Wood, reprimanded Barrabus the Gray, his\nchief assassin, for failing to carry out his orders to kill the Thayan\nsorceress. Barrabus explained that Sylora was too well guarded and suggested\nthat if his magical dagger, an emerald-studded weapon that could steal an\nindividual’s life force, was returned to him, he might be able to accomplish\nthe task. Alegni ignored Barrabus’s request and sent the assassin to discover\nif the Ashmadai were preparing to assault Neverwinter. Although Barrabus had an\nintense hatred for Alegni, he was forced to serve the Netherese lord because his\nlife force was tied to the tiefling’s magical sword, Charon’s Claw. \nWhen Drizzt and Dahlia reached the\noutskirts of Luskan, they decided to take a detour to the farmlands so that the\ndrow could learn of their condition. The two companions discovered that the farmlands\nwere mostly abandoned, but they eventually found a decrepit farmhouse that was occupied\nby a woman named Meg and her five children. Drizzt was going to help the\nimpoverished family by giving them money, but Dhalia stopped him from doing so because\nshe knew that the charity would only bring unwanted attention onto the farmers.\nThe couple left the farmhouse with more of Drizzt’s moral values being\nquestioned. \nMeanwhile, Sylora used the power of\nthe wand that she had been given to magically construct a fortress, which she\nnamed Ashenglade, in Neverwinter Wood. When the stronghold was completed, Sylora\nprepared to continue her campaign against Neverwinter and the Netherese. Once\nValindra and the group of Ashmadai reached their destination, the lich met the\nentity that she had been seeking, a mysterious woman named Arunika, who was actually\na succubus and a representative of the Abolethic Sovereignty. Arunika informed\nValindra that the Sovereignty would be willing to ally with the Thayans in\ntheir war against the Netherese, and she also promised that the aboleths would\nhelp the lich with her insanity. Around that time, Barrabus arrived in\nNeverwinter on behalf of the Shadovar and offered to help the people of the city\ndefend themselves when the Ashamadai zealots attacked. The citizens of\nNeverwinter were at first skeptical, but Barrabus reminded them that the Netherese\nhad protected the city before the primordial cataclysm in 1451 DR and that he\nhimself had lived through the destruction by seeking cover underneath the settlement’s\nprominent bridge.\nAfter their visit to the farmlands,\nDrizzt and Dahlia entered Luskan, but the elf woman chose not to magically disguise\nherself until after they passed through the city gates. Consequently, Dahlia\nwas recognized as the individual who had killed the High Captain of Ship\nRenthor, one of the five factions of Luskan, over a decade earlier. Drizzt and\nDahlia made their way to the apartment of their drow companion Jarlaxle\nBaenre in order to see if he and the dwarf warrior Athrogate had survived the\nadventure in Gauntlgrym. The pair could find no sign of their missing comrades\nand were soon attacked by pirates and thugs who served Ship Renthor, which sought\nrevenge on Dahlia. Although Drizzt and Dahlia fought valiantly against the\nlarge number of enemies, defeat seemed a possibility until the arrival of a\nforce from Ship Kurth, one of Luskan’s other factions, led by the skilled\nassassin Beniago. Drizzt noticed that Beniago seemed to possess the jewel-encrusted\ndagger of his old nemesis, the assassin Artemis Entreri, but he concluded that his\nmind was deceiving him and it had to be a different weapon.\nSylora continued to gather her Ashmadai\nand ashen zombie forces at Ashenglade when Hadencourt, a malebranche (also\nknown as a war devil) in the service of Szass arrived at the newly constructed\nfortress. Sylora assigned Hadencourt the task of journeying north and\ndestroying Dahlia before the elf warrior could interfere with the sorceress’s\nplans. Sylora then assembled a small contingent of her forces to attack Neverwinter.\nWhile Valindra led Sylora’s minions in assaulting the city, Sylora and Jestry visited\nArunika, who promised them the assistance of the Abolethic Sovereignty. During\nthe attack on Neverwinter, Barrabus fought alongside the city’s citizens and inflicted\nmany casualties on the enemy force. At a predetermined time, Alegni led his\nShadovar soldiers into the battle and easily defeated the horde of Ashmadai and\nzombies. However, instead of Alegni being regarded as the hero of Neverwinter,\nthe people of the city cheered for Barrabus, who suggested that the prominent bridge\nbe renamed after him. Following the victory over the Thayan forces, the Netherese\nbegan to reestablish their presence and power in Neverwinter.\nAfter they were rescued, Drizzt and\nDahlia were taken to the stronghold of Ship Kurth and offered an alliance with\nthe faction, which they were forced to conditionally accept. Once the two\nreturned to Jarlaxle’s apartment, the conversation they had ended with them becoming\nlovers. While Drizzt was asleep, Dahlia secretly left the apartment to steal a\nvaluable diamond from the jeweler of Ship Kurth. However, when Dahlia\ninfiltrated the jeweler’s shop, she was confronted by Beniago, who had been\nawaiting her arrival. Dahlia soon found herself in a desperate battle against\nBeniago, who wielded a magical life-stealing dagger, in a room that was rigged with\nfloor traps that she did not know. Although defeat was inevitable after Dahlia\nwas injured and poisoned by one of the traps, she continued to fight the\nassassin. Dahlia was saved by Drizzt, who forced Beniago to flee the jeweler’s\nshop, and the couple immediately made their escape from Luskan. When Dahlia then\nfell unconscious because of the poison, Drizzt took her to the farmhouse that the\ntwo had previously visited and begged Meg for help. The farmer woman told\nDrizzt that she would notify the local herb man, but that they would need a\ndose of the poison to create an antidote. Drizzt returned to Luskan and traded\nthe antidote from Beniago for the promise that the drow warrior would support him\nin the future once the assassin had taken the title of High Captain of Ship\nKurth. Drizzt returned to the farmhouse in time to save Dahlia, who had been very\nclose to death.\nOnce Dahlia’s health was restored, she\nand Drizzt journeyed south toward Neverwinter Wood and encountered Hadencourt,\nwho disguised himself and posed as a friend. Hadencourt soon revealed himself\nand attacked the two companions, and he summoned several legion devils and\nspined devils from the Nine Hells to assist him. Drizzt and Dahlia killed a few\nof the malebranche’s minions, but they were eventually forced to flee. The\ncouple hoped that they had escaped from the devils, but the spirit of Dorcrae tracked\nthem down and informed Hadencourt where they were. When battle was once again\njoined, Drizzt and Dahlia managed to kill the lesser devils serving Hadencourt,\nand the malebranche himself was impaled against a tree by Andahar, who had been\nsummoned by the dark elf. As Hadencourt was dying, he promised to get revenge on\nDrizzt, who tauntingly told the war devil that he should join forces with Errtu, a balor who wanted vengeance\non the drow ranger.\nIn Neverwinter Wood, Alegni was visited\nby his master, Draygo Quick, a Netherese warlock and lord. Draygo demanded that\nAlegni complete his conquest of the region and defeat the forces of Thay, and he\nalso commanded his young apprentice, a misshapen tiefling warlock named Effron,\nto assist Alegni. Although Alegni and Effron openly despised each other, they\nhad no choice but to work together. Meanwhile, Sylora and Valindra met with the\nSovereignty ambassador in an underground cavern near Neverwinter. The aboleth\nhelped with Valindra’s mental state, and an alliance of convenience was formed\nbetween the Thayans and the Sovereignty. Jestry was later brought to the aboleth\nambassador and magically transformed with enchanted umber hulk skin. The\nprocess was lethal, it would kill Jestry within a year, but he was transformed\ninto a mindless, feral slave whose sole purpose was to serve as Sylora’s champion\nagainst Dahlia.\nAlso at that time, Alegni was\nvisited in Neverwinter by Arunika, who was called the Forest Sentinel by the citizens\nof the city. Alegni was not able to discern Arunika’s true nature, and he\nformed an alliance with the disguised succubus, who was manipulating both the\nShadovar and the Thayans. Alegni later used Charon’s Claw to inflict severe\npain on Barrabus as a punishment for the assassin having the bridge in\nNeverwinter renamed after himself. Barrabus detested being a slave to Charon’s\nClaw and Alegni, but he could not die even if he tried to kill himself because\nthe magical sword would either stop him or return him to life. Barrabus had no\nhope for freedom except to kill Alegni or destroy Charon’s Claw, which he could\nnot do as long as the Netherese warlord wielded the blade. Shortly afterward,\nthe Thayans used a small force of umber hulks that served the Abolethic\nSovereignty for a subterranean assault on Neverwinter. Barrabus’s attacks were\nlargely ineffectual against the umber hulks, but Alegni slew two of the\nmonstrous creatures single-handed, winning him the admiration of the city’s\npeople. The umber hulks’ assault was ultimately repulsed, but the beasts had\nalready killed many of the citizens of Neverwinter. \nAs Drizzt and Dahlia continued\ntheir journey toward Neverwinter Wood, the drow began to share his past and recount\nstories of his old companions. The couple was soon attacked by a group of Shadovar,\nand Dahlia exhibited a brutality that Drizzt had never seen in her before and\ndid not understand. Dahlia’s actions reminded Drizzt that there was much that\nhe did not know about her. Meanwhile, Barrabus and Effron were assigned to work\ntogether and hunt down Ashmadai in Neverwinter Wood. When the pair encountered\na small band of Ashmadai led by Jestry, Barrabus took the majority of the risk\nand engaged Sylora’s champion while Effron used his magic to easily kill the\nother zealots. Barrabus was a more skilled fighter than Jestry, but the\nThayan’s new armor proved to be more formidable than even the assassin’s own enchanted\nweapons, and he was forced to flee. After the battle, Alegni learned that\nDahlia was making her way to Neverwinter Wood in the company of Drizzt. Effron then\nrevealed to Alegni that he knew Dahlia’s real name Dahlia Syndalay of the\nSnakebrook clan. This information enraged Alegni because he now knew that Dahlia\nwas actually a young elf whom he had raped and impregnated years earlier, and\nwho had thrown their child from a cliff soon after it was born. Hoping to use\nthe situation to his advantage, Barrabus volunteered to journey out alone to\nkill Dahlia and Drizzt.\nBarrabus knew of Drizzt’s prowess\nand believed that if he could get the drow warrior to fight Alegni, he could bring\nabout the tiefling’s death. Barrabus devised a plan to capture Dahlia alive and\nforce Drizzt to battle Alegni, but when the assassin ambushed the elf woman, he\nwas immediately subdued by Drizzt. The drow ranger looked at Barrabus and was\nstunned to recognize the face of Entreri,\nwhom he had thought long dead. Drizzt did not believe that Barrabus was\nactually Entreri, but he was soon convinced when the assassin revealed intimate\nknowledge about the dark elf that only he would have known. Drizzt proposed a\ntruce among the three, suggesting that they work together to kill Sylora, but he\nand Dahlia were not certain that they could trust Entreri. The assassin then told\nDrizzt that he had grown bored with him long ago and no longer held a vendetta.\nTo Dahlia, Entreri explained that his mission to assassinate or capture her was\nnothing personal, and that killing Sylora would achieve both of their goals. As\na final act of trust, Entreri unexpectedly attacked Drizzt and held a knife to the\ndrow’s throat, but then drew back the weapon without harming him, showing that the\nassassin had no intention of harming the ranger. Both Drizzt and Entreri were\nsurprised at how pleased that they were to see each other alive, although it\nwas for different reasons.\nOnce Drizzt, Dahlia, and Entreri journeyed\nto Ashenglade, they engaged the Ashmadai and zombie guards who served Sylora.\nThe three formidable companions were assisted by Guenhwyvar and killed a large\nnumber of the sorceress’s minions as they fought their way through the\nfortress. After the trio reached Sylora’s tower at the center of Ashenglade,\nDrizzt used his magical bow Taulmaril to battle the sorceress from afar while\nDahlia engaged Jestry in single combat. Even though Dahlia was a proficient\nwarrior, she realized that she could not achieve victory over Jestry, but the mummified\nzealot was eventually defeated when Entreri joined the fight. Valindra still\nsuffered from some mental instability and spent the majority of the battle\nwatching from afar. After Dahlia and Entreri attacked Sylora directly, the\nsorceress recognized her imminent doom and used a magical cloak to flee the\nfortress, but Drizzt and his comrades pursued her to the edge of the Dread\nRing. In her desperation, Sylora attempted to use more of the Dread Ring’s energy,\nbut she realized that she had taken too much of the necromantic area’s power.\nSylora quickly succumbed to the combined attacks of Drizzt, Dahlia, and Guenhwyvar.\nIn the aftermath of the battle,\nEntreri told Drizzt and Dahlia that he had to return to Neverwinter, as he was compelled\nto serve Alegni. After Dahlia learned that Alegni, her most hated foe, was the\nleader of the Shadovar in Neverwinter, she declared that she would have worked\nwith Sylora had she known. Entreri was thrilled to discover this information\nand hoped to use Dahlia’s hatred of Alegni to coax the elf warrior and Drizzt\ninto aiding him in acquiring his freedom from the Netherese lord. Dahlia had considered\nthat her business in the region was finished because Sylora was dead, but once she\nlearned about Alegni, she vowed to kill the tiefling.\nSylora’s life was preserved by the\npower of the Dread Ring, but before she could do anything, Jestry returned as\nan undead creature under the control of Valindra and brutally killed the\nsorceress on the lich’s orders.
