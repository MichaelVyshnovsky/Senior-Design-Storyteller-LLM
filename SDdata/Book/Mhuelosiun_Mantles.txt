'''''Mhuelosiun Mantles''''' was a [[Hlondath]]an [[spellbook]] purported to describe the process for creating one or more [[Netherese mantle]]s.

==History==
The libram was written by the [[Mage Royal]] of [[Mhaelos]] in the years directly prior to the {{yearlinkName|199}}, when the [[Crown against the Scepter Wars]] started.

By the {{yearlinkName|1370}}, the legendary tome had popped up in the markets of [[Ooltul]].

==Reputation==
The value of ''Mhuelosiun Mantles'' was considered to be inestimable, and it was said that only the [[true name]] of at least one [[Chosen of Mystra]] would be a fair offer.
