        "mainbody": "The True and Impossible Adventures of Tenebrux Morrow was a fictional series about a real-life Waterdhavian ship captain, Tenebrux Morrow, and her spelljammer the New Bride, and their shared adventures across the various planes of existence.\nThe volumes of The True and Impossible Adventures were thin editions, and in some cases cheaply made.\nThe first volume of the pulp adventure series took Captain Morrow and the New Bride to the shifting tides of the Astral Plane. There, the crew came face-to-face with a red dragon-riding githyanki knights. One of the knights lost their mount in the battle and found themselves aboard the New Bride, ready to spill blood, if not for a faithful cabin-boy. Norls the tabaxi clawed and bit at the knight. Whilst in the Astral Plane, Norls attacks were fruitless against the gith and only by a miracle, the tabaxi avoided the Silver Sword oh so close to severing his spiritual anchoring cord. Tenebrux Morrow herself, however, was on the Astral Plane in her full physical form and valiantly defeated the githyanki knight in a duel, sending them tumbling into the endless Astral Sea. But the danger did not pass, as a flock of dragon rose from the Tunarath citadel looming in the distance.\nIn the second volume of the series, Captain Morrow and the New Bride traveled into the Feywild, the realm of the eladrin. She shared the story of how, when her crew was reveling in song with their fey hosts, their ships resident smith sang in a resonant voice that sounded out over those of the eladrin. The offense was a great insult to the proud fey people. In recompense, Captain Morrow left the halfling smith behind, to a life of indentured servitude. The New Brides smith was said to have been directed to forge a blade that \"sang for the eladrin more sweetly than she.\"\nFollowing its voyage to the Feywild, the New Bride traveled next into the dark domain of Barovia. The mists maligning the Domain of Dread afflicted the crew almost instantly. Some members threw themselves over the sides of the ship while others were merely reduced to sobbing messes. Captain Morrow tried to navigate the domain herself, alone at the ships helm, singing a shanty that carried far and wide through the mists. In a short time, Baron Strahd von Zarovich himself appeared before the vessel. After threatening each other with utter annihilation, Strahd and Captain Morrow found they had much in common and were true \"kindred spirits\". Strahd left his new friend with the parting gift of new teethâ€”presumably the enlarged fangs associated with vampirism.\nAfter Barovia, Captain Morrow and the New Bride earned a contract to infiltrate the palace of Lord Primus, ruler of Mechanus. The Supreme Modron wished to study how mortals behaved, and Captain Morrow gladly obliged by leaving her entire crew behind, save one member. In exchange, Primus offered to identify which member of her crew proved to be a traitor.\nSome time later, Captain Morrow enjoyed a leisurely float through the Elemental Plane of Air with Erules, the New Brides goblin tinkerer. The pair enjoyed their relaxing time in the skies thanks to their matching rings of command. Once Morrow relayed the reasoning for abandoning his crew on Primus, she promptly plucked Erules ring off her finger and left to the howling wings and eddies of the Elemental Plane. The captain vowed to one day in the future return for her once-loyal friend.\nAs of the , two volumes of the series could be found within the Shattered Sanctum on the Sword Coast. Yet another volume was in the Riverside Teahouse of Auntie Ethel, in the Sunlit Wetlands."
