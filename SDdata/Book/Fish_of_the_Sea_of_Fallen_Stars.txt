'''''Fish of the Sea of Fallen Stars''''' was a book that cataloged the many varieties of [[fish]] found in the depths of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] from the [[Hand of the Seldarine]] before the stronghold's fall centuries before [[1281 DR]].

==Content==
Among many aquatic creatures detailed in this book, one of the more obscure beasts of interest were [[raik]]s. Several species of raiks existed. Grand raiks were described to be recognizable by their hooked jaws and fins splotched with blue and white. The book detailed their size (that of a [[human]] adolescent), their aggressive nature, and the hard feat of fishing for these fierce creatures. The book stated that, unlike lesser raiks, their bigger kin were extremely aggressive towards other fish and territorial, attacking or pursuing the scaly intruders to the ends of their lives. These hook-jawed fish could fearlessly attack fish three times their size. According to some eyewitnesses, grand raiks were known to kill mottled sidi octopi.

==History==
''Fish of the Sea of Fallen Stars'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' [[900 DR]] and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By [[1281 DR]], the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. A copy of ''Fish of the Sea of Fallen Stars'' could be found in the citadel's library curated by [[Custhantos]], along with other rare books.
