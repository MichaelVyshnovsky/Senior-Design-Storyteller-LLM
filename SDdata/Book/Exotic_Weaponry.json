        "mainbody": "Exotic Weaponry was a tome dedicated to warrior craft, various arms, and the best ways to defeat dire monsters of the Realms.\nThe book was a collection of guides and personal battle experiences of a legendary paladin hero Acarus. The paladin recounted numerous encounters with every creature hes battled in his life. Each encounter was described in detail, including the best weapon required for the slaying. Several encounters in the book were of note, including the battle at the Glade of Eternal Twilight, in which Acarus used a weapon forged of cold iron against malicious fey. Weapons made out of adamantine were used in a battle against an iron golem of Darkfall Pass. The paladin even recorded his planar travels where he learned that cold iron weapons blessed by a goodly power were deadly to demons. Devils, on the other hand, were slain by alchemical silver weapons that carried similar benevolent blessings.\nBy the , copies of Exotic Weaponry could be found in most libraries of Faer√ªn. A copy of the book belonged to Daeghun Farlong, father of famed Kalach-Cha, the Knight-Commander of the Crossroad Keep."
