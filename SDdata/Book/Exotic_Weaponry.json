        "Contents": "The [[book]] was a collection of guides and personal battle experiences of a legendary [[paladin]] hero [[Acarus]]. The paladin recounted numerous encounters with every creature he's battled in his life. Each encounter was described in detail, including the best weapon required for the slaying. Several encounters in the book were of note, including the battle at the [[Glade of Eternal Twilight]], in which Acarus used a weapon forged of [[cold iron]] against malicious [[fey]]. Weapons made out of [[adamantine]] were used in a battle against an [[iron golem]] of [[Darkfall Pass]]. The paladin even recorded his planar travels where he learned that cold iron weapons ''[[bless]]ed'' by a goodly power were deadly to [[demon]]s. [[Devil]]s, on the other hand, were slain by [[alchemical silver]] weapons that carried similar benevolent blessings.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, copies of ''Exotic Weaponry'' could be found in most libraries of [[Faer√ªn]]. A copy of the book belonged to [[Daeghun Farlong]], father of famed [[Kalach-Cha]], the Knight-Commander of the [[Crossroad Keep]]."
