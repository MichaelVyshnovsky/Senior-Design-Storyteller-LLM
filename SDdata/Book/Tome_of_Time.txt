The '''''Tome of Time''''' was a book in the fourth level of the [[Mobius Tower]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|123}}

==Description==
The book had platinum plates for covers.

===List of spells===
This book contained the following spells:
* ''[[Haste]]''
* ''[[Slow]]''
* ''[[Dimension door]]''
* ''[[Distance distortion]]''
* ''[[Passwall]]''
* ''[[Teleport]]''
* ''[[Disintegrate]]''
* ''[[Limited wish]]''
* ''[[Permanency]]''<ref group="note">The spell listed is "Permanent". There is no such spell in AD&D 1st edition; the module I5 on which the adventure is based on uses [[Permanency]] instead. It is thus assumed for the purposes of this article that the spell is actually intended to be Permanency.
* ''[[Temporal stasis]]''
* ''[[Time Stop]]''
