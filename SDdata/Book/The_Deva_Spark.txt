'''''The Deva Spark''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure module. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting. 

{{Quote|''A bar room brawl? No big deal. Except when it starts on the Abyss—and the brawlers are a [[deva]] and a [[bebilith]]! The deva: A celestial champion who serves the cause of ultimate Good. The bebilith: A nightmarish monster whose every deed reeks of ultimate Evil. Two eternal enemies locked in a bizarre struggle for the ultimate prize.''

''What terrible secret connects these two beings? And what does it all have to do with the legendary deva spark? Only a group of brave cutters can get to the dark of this peel, and they'd better hurry... because time is running out!''

''"The Deva Spark" is a Planescape adventure for a party of four to six characters of 5th—9th levels. From the blasted pits of the Abyss to the peaceful forests of Elysium, the heroes track a barmy bebilith who holds the key to saving the life of a dying deva. Can your characters handle the fire of the deva spark?''}}
