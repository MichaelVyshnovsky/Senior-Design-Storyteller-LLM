Campaign Sourcebook and Catacomb Guide is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. It is the first book in the DMGR series. 
Designed to aid Dungeon Masters in creating immersive and captivating adventures, this accessory provides a wealth of information and resources for building intricate campaigns and exploring treacherous catacombs.
The accessory begins by offering guidance on campaign creation, providing tips and tools for crafting engaging storylines, developing memorable non-player characters, and constructing detailed settings.
This accessory offers extensive guidance on designing catacombs, including mapping techniques, encounter tables, and trap suggestions. It also provides inspiration for catacomb-themed adventures, such as tomb raids, undead  encounters, and quests for ancient artifacts.
The book also contains a wealth of new character options for players. It introduces new classes, subclasses, and kits that are thematically tied to the catacomb environment, allowing players to create characters uniquely suited for delving into the depths. Additionally, new spells, magical items, and creatures specific to catacombs are included.
To aid Dungeon Masters in running catacomb adventures, the sourcebook provides guidelines for managing exploration, handling traps and puzzles, and running combat encounters in the claustrophobic and dangerous environment. It also presents a collection of sample catacombs, complete with maps, descriptions, and encounters, ready for immediate use or customization.
