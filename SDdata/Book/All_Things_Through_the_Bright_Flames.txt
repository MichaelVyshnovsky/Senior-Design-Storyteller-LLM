'''''All Things Through the Bright Flames''''' is an ebook fan-fiction novella by [[Ed Greenwood]], set in the [[Forgotten Realms]], released in late 2016.

{{quote|The First Tale of Mirt In the Time After The Sundering (circa [[1492 DR]], after the events of [[Death Masks|DEATH MASKS]])

[[Mirt the Moneylender]] was the very first named Realms character, over 50 years ago.

Originally released on the DM's Guild as-is, this novella was taken down off the website with no explanation, only to be replaced six days later with a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] rules appendix included.
