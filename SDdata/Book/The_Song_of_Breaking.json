        "mainbody": "The Song of Breaking was a piece of baleful music written in the city of Silverymoon sometime before 1372 DR.\nThe Song of Breaking was recorded by its composer in a sheet music booklet.\nLegends surrounded the song, but they were not far off from reality. The Song of Breaking could be played once per day to trigger its magical abilities, which were similar to casting the circle of death spell.\nA young love-stricken composer from Silverymoon wrote this piece of music sometime before 1372 DR after he fell hopelessly in love with an elven noblewoman. Both their names were lost to history, but stories claimed that the love was unrequited. In a last desperate attempt to win her heart over, the composer penned this baleful piece of music. The moment he placed the last dot on the music sheets, he collapsed on the floor, lifeless. By the late 14 century DR, many believed that the Song of Breaking, when played, cursed anyone who heard it with the same grim fate as suffered by its young composer.\nThe original of the sheet music belonged to the Silverymoon Conservatory, but by 1372 DR, the Song of Breaking fell into the hands of Vladmyr, a shady curio merchant from Daggerford. He tasked the Hero of Daggerford with tracking down and recovering several pieces for his collection, which had been lost while being transported in an unsecured trading wagon through an especially bumpy patch of the Trade Way. One of these items was the sheet music of this cursed song. After falling out of the wagon, they were swept away from the road by a rainstorm. The music was found by a hin bard named Petrello, who was hopelessly infatuated with Kyleena Moonglow, the leader of a wild elf tribe. The halfling stayed with the tribe in the remote area of Lonely Barrens of Delimbiyr Vale while trying to win the cold beautys heart. Subsequently, the Song of Breaking sheet music was taken from the bard by the Hero of Daggerford and returned to Vladmyr the Loanshark."
