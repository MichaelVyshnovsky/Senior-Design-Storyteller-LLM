        "mainbody": "Dragons of Stormwreck Isle is a 5th edition introductory adventure included in the Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set (2022) boxed set. It is designed for 1â€“5 player-characters, taking them from 1 level to 3 as they explore the eponymous Stormwreck Isle, a new location within the Forgotten Realms.\nTo a greater degree than previous adventures intended as entry points for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons, such as those included in the original Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set and in the Dungeons & Dragons Essentials Kit, Dragons of Stormwreck Isle is intended primarily to teach how to play the game of Dungeons & Dragons. This means that the adventure booklet contains many more tips and notes for the DM about how to run certain scenes or encounters, how to treat players, and how to engage players. The adventure is intended to be played with the pre-generated characters included in the boxed set, and includes motivations and hooks specific to backgrounds included on those character sheets.\n () () ()\n ()"
