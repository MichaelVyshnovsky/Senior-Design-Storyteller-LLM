{{Quote|'''''Climb aboard an astral skiff and set sail for adventure!'''

''On the [[Astral Sea]], characters face off against [[Angel (astral)|angels]], [[devils]], [[githyanki]], and even the [[gods]] and their [[exarch]]s while exploring dungeons, raiding [[dominion ship|astral galleons]], and establishing themselves as [[demigod]]s. This game supplement builds on the overview of the Astral Sea presented in the [[Manual of the Planes 4th edition|Manual of the Planes]] game supplement and explores the heavenly [[plane]] in greater detail. From the cavernous layers of [[Nine Hells]] to the dark dungeons of [[Tytherion]], adventure awaits in every astral dominion and on the vast, uncharted sea that stretches between them.''

''This game supplement describes the Astral Sea and key locations throughout the plane. It also presents a multitude of new monsters, as well as adventure hooks, encounters, hazards, and everything Dungeon Masters need to make the Astral Sea a featured setting in their campaigns.
