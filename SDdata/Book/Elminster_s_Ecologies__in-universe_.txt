'''''Elminster's Ecologies''''' was a series of nine books, compiled by the [[sage]] of [[Shadowdale]], [[Elminster]], that detailed the various natural wildlife, local trees and plans, and [[magic]]al beasts that could be found in a number of regions in the [[Heartlands]] and surrounding areas of [[North Faerûn|northern]] and [[Interior Faerûn|central]] [[Faerûn]].  

==Books==
;''[[An Investigation into the Natural Systems of Organisms and Their Surroundings]]'':
:A "definitive treatise" on the natural classification and order of the species of [[Toril]]. It described a number of concepts and ideas that applied to the understanding of the subsequent volumes. 
:The "chain of consumption" was charted, detailing the relationship between apex carnivores, lesser meat-eaters, matter-eaters, herbivores and plant life, in relation to the availability of these various life forms. It continued to explore the concepts of population control, competition over food sources and the effects of climate on the entire circle of life. It concluded with guidelines that had to be considered when observing life on Toril: creatures from different locales often displayed different behavior, they were governed by a variety of motivations, and while they tended to prefer certain locales, they often wandered from where they were usually found.
:Written by Elminster Aumar.

;''[[Cormanthor (book)|Cormanthor]]'':
:This descriptive guide detailed the diverse plant life, natural species, magical creatures Its texts explored the four smaller woods that made up the greater region, including the [[Rimwood]], [[Midwood]], [[Starwood]], and [[Edgelands]].

:Written by the [[Lyra Sunrose]]
