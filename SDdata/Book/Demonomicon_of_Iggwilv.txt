The '''''Demonomicon''''', also known as the '''''Fiendomicon''''',

{{quote
|Many are they who would gladly have prostrated themselves before me, promising their fortunes, their families, their very [[soul]]s to possess the tome you now hold in your hands. No matter how powerful you believe yourself to be, no matter how great your claim to knowledgeâ€”on matters of demon lore, you are a rank novice in my sight.

==Description==
All volumes of the ''Demonomicon'' were brassbound pages of [[parchment]] with dark purple covers made of demon leather. It was held shut by a clasp in the shape of a three-fingered demonic hand.

Among some historical information on demon lords, the book detailed the ascension of [[Orcus]] to demon lord status, specifying that he spent some time as a [[nalfeshnee]] inhabiting the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 400: Woeful Escarand|400{{th}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]] at the same time that the [[Gith (race)|gith]] race revolted against the [[mind flayer]]s. The book also contained treatises on [[Fraz-Urb'luu]], [[Juiblex]], [[Pazuzu]], and [[Zuggtmoy]].{{Cite dragon/336/Spellcraft: The Demonomicon of Iggwilv|76-84}}

The book contained not only information about the demon lords, but also abundant demonic lore in general. It specified what kinds of demons certain evil individuals became after death. Each volume of the ''Demonomicon'' contained the [[true name]]s of multiple different demons.

The ''Demonomicon'' also contained information on the Abyss itself. It stated that the plane could regenerate a previously destroyed demon lord.

Information on other creatures was also available in the ''Demonomicon''. When discussing the [[obyrith]] [[Pale Night]], the book argued that she also spawned other races that inhabited the [[Prime Material plane]], such as [[lamia]]s and [[harpy|harpies]].

Every volume of the ''Demonomicon'' contained information on the same spells, all created by Iggwilv: ''[[dolor (spell)|dolor]]'', ''[[ensnarement]]'', ''[[exaction]]'', ''[[imbrue]]'', ''[[implore]]'', ''[[minimus containment]]'', and ''[[torment]]''.

Possession of the complete ''Demonomicon'' was believed to grant the reader with power to dominate all the demon lords described in its pages, paralleling the power Iggwilv herself had over those entities. However, over the book's history, no [[wizard]] succeeded in obtaining all volumes.

Any volume of the book was capable of increasing the strength of [[conjuration]] spells such as ''[[planar binding]]'' against demons and other evil creatures. The first few pages of each volume were blank and functioned as renewable [[material component]]s for soul-binding spells such as ''[[magic jar]]'', ''minimus containment'', and ''[[trap the soul]]''. Whenever a creature was imprisoned within a volume of the ''Demonomicon'', its visage appeared as a drawing on that page's parchment whose appearance changed every time the book was opened. Creatures trapped inside the book could communicate with outsiders via spells such as ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[dream]]'', and ''[[Rary's telepathic bond]]''.

| source = A warning to those in possession of the Demonomicon.
| text   = Was it unwise to set hard-won knowledge to parchment so sneak thieves such as yourself could steal away with it? Perhaps. But unless you are a special kind of fool, you know that I am already hunting you. So find what wisdom you can in these pages, for the time in which it might serve you is short...
}}
The ''Demonomicon'' was based on a previous work known as the ''[[Tome of Zyx]]'', All content from the original tomes were copied over to the ''Demonomicon'', but it also contained abundant original research conducted by Iggwilv over the years.

Although it was generally believed that the ''Demonomicon'' only had six volumes,{{Cite dungeon/148/Wells of Darkness|75}}
