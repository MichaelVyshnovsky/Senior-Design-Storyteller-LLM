The ceremony was pleasant, but it was inconsequential to the knowledge that will be available to me shortly. I have undertaken an oath to never again communicate in the Common tongue. In exchange for this geas, I am to inherit the knowledge of the elven mages who helped build this city. Is this knowledge worth the cost of losing the language I have spoken all my life? We shall see.''|An excerpt from ''Chronicles of Rothilion''}}",
        "Description": "The many volumes of ''Chronicles of Rothilion'' were separated in two groups. The first one had the books' names and number engraved on the books' spines in [[Common]], the second one in [[Elvish]]. Both groups could also be easily distinguished by the difference in the types of [[leather]] used to bind the tomes.",
        "History": "The ''Chronicles of Rothilion'' was a journal penned by Rothilion and they included his personal thoughts and life, as well as the history of the City of Song as it related to the author. The books were written in first person. The difference in language and format of ''Chronicles of Rothilion'' was symbolic as it punctuated the day Rothilion was elevated to the post of the Master Wizard and made an oath to denounce Common in favor of Elvish language. That day was documented in the last numbered tome in the collection with the Common language name.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], the full set of the ''Chronicles of Rothilion'' was sealed in the [[Crypt of Rothilion]] in Myth Drannor's [[Polyandrium]]. Mysteriously, a loose page from the ''[[Testament of Jade]]'' could be found inside the last book in the set."
