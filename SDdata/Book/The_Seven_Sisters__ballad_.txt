'''''The Seven Sisters''''' was a lengthy [[ballad]] about the [[Seven Sisters]], chosen of the goddess of magic [[Mystra]]. The song was written and popularized sometime before [[1368 DR]].

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], ''the Seven Sisters'' was performed by the god [[Milil]], the Lord of All Songs. He imposed the beautiful song on an audience of [[Sensates]] from [[Sigil]] who were performing a ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' ritual to experience the forbidden experience of spying on [[Toril]]lian deities.
