        "Contents": "{{quote|An important note; immortals like Eilistraee view relationships differently than we do. The gaze is cold, abstracted even in the most passionate and vivacious of Gods such as she. Think of Tellemun's Theatre of Distance. The viewer is somehow allowed space from the action of the play while still being immersed in the experience. That is how deities think. That is how they view everything, in an auditorium of icy-long infinity, in the nosebleed seats. No wonder Eillistraee smiled and wept with equal fierceness when she defeated her mother.|An excerpt from ''Eilistraee: Lady Silverhair''}}<br/>\n\nThe book offered a close and personal look into the story of Eilistraee, sparing no detail. It chronicled the deity's life, death at the hands of her mother, [[Lolth]], and rebirth in the [[Second Sundering]].",
        "History": "A copy of ''Eilistraee: Lady Silverhair'' was kept among the religious books of the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]], a multi-denominational shrine in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
