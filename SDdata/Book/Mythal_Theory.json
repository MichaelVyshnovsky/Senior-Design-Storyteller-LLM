        "mainbody": "'''''Mythal Theory''''' was a book of arcane research on the topic of ''[[mythal]]s'' from the [[Hand of the Seldarine]] before the stronghold's fall centuries before [[1281 DR]].",
        "Content": "At the time of being penned by [[Schend]] and [[Melka]], ''Mythal Theory'' claimed that none, apart from the [[High Mage]]s, knew of the true nature nor origins of ''mythals''. Even scholars well-versed in [[elven]] lore or research on the topic ''circa'' [[900 DR]] knew little. Many scholars came to a consensus that ''mythals'' were living beings of [[magic]], webs of magical forces, weaved together using the creators' own life-forces. It was believed that, once created, ''mythals'' were sustained by natural mechanisms of the magics within and nature outside, like the moving winds, or flowing waters in creeks, and even the temperature change in the sun's rays. This connection to the casters' life and to nature put ''mythals'' far beyond mundane magics, making them intricately connected to the ''[[Weave]]'', the source of all magic on the world of [[Toril]].",
        "History": "''Mythal Theory'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' 900 DR and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By [[1281 DR]], the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One copy could be found in the citadel's library curated by [[Custhantos]], along with other rare books. That copy eventually found its way into the hands of [[Orrick|Orrick the Gray]], who researched ''mythals'' in his tower just on the edge of [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]]."
