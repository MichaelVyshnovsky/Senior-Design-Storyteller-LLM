The Fall of Myth Drannor was a lengthy opera of several parts and a grand finale. The opera depicted the events of the Weeping War and the destruction of the City of Song, written and popularized sometime before 1368 DR.
In 1368 DR, the finale of the voluminous Fall of Myth Drannor opera was performed by the god Milil, the Lord of All Songs. He imposed the beautiful song on an audience of Sensates from Sigil who were performing a scrying ritual to experience the forbidden experience of spying on Torillian deities. After a dozen of excruciatingly long songs it became apparent to the Sensates that the concert was a form of punishment for spying.
