It is part of the [[Al-Qadim]] campaign setting and set in [[Zakhara]].\n{{Quote|'''''Who among you dares to challenge the high seas?'''''\n\n''Inspired by the tales of Sinbad,'' Golden Voyages ''provides the source material and adventures needed to run a mini-campaign on the [[Crowded Sea]]. Detailed backgrounds, perilous locations, and wondrous NPCs populate the enchanted seas. Player characters will discover wildly different adventures as they sail from place to place.''\n\nGolden Voyages ''includes: six booklets filled with mini-adventures, an overall framing adventure, expanded rules on ships and sailing, details and background concerning topography, tribes, and new locations, and plenty of maps and player handouts; Monstrous Compendium pages detailing new monsters; a custom DM screen for use in all [[Al-Qadim|AL-QADIM]] games; and a poster map of the Crowded Sea.''<br/>\n\n''Recommended for use with the'' [[Arabian Adventures]] ''rulebook.''}}",
        "Description": "In ''Golden Voyages'', the player characters are cast adrift on the Crowded Sea, then sent on side-trips to the [[Strait of Sorrow]] and the [[Steaming Isles]]. The linking story sends the PCs on a rambling ocean voyage to seek a Great Treasure in an archipelago thick with wonders. The Dungeon Master chooses one of ten Treasures suited to the inclinations of his group (power gamers, warlords, role-players, story-tellers, or puzzle solvers), then plants clues that lure the PCs through seven mini-adventures in any order the DM likes.\n\nThe first book, ''Home Port: Wherein the Tale Begins'' is a 32-page book that includes an outline of the ''Golden Voyages'' campaign, the framing story encounters (beginning in the [[Pearl Cities]]), descriptions of the possible Great Treasure (the object of the adventure), expanded rules on ships and sailing, and background on the ways of [[Zakhara]]n sailors. The last part of this booklet contains additional rules and background.\n\nThe second book, ''The Crowded Sea: al-Sartan'', is a 16-page booklet that describes the islands that form [[Jazayir al-Sartan]]. It includes descriptions of topography, tribes, and ''The Great and Dread God'', an adventure set in these islands.\n\nThe third book, ''The Crowded Sea: Nada al-Hazan'', is a 16-page booklet. It covers the [[Nada al-Hazan]] (Strait of Sorrow) chain, including the trading port of [[Bandar al-Sa'adat]]. Two adventures, ''A Night in Town'' and ''The Isle of Sadness'', are set in these islands.\n\nThe fourth book, ''The Crowded Sea: The Djinni's Claws'' is a 16-page booklet that details the deadly archipelago known as the [[Djinni's Claws]]. Several small adventures, ''Servitude'', ''Broken Talons'', and ''Shark Food'' are set in these islands.\n\nThe fifth and final book, ''The Crowded Sea: The Steaming Isles'', is a 16-page booklet about the fog-shrouded and volcanic [[Steaming Isles]], and the perils and treasures found there. ''Praise be the Loregiver'' is set on these islands.\n\nAlso included is a 16-page booklet containing maps used in the adventures, useful DM aids, deck plans, and player handouts for ''Golden Voyages''. A ''Monstrous Compendium'' is also part of the boxed set.",
