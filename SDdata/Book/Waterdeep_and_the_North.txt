Waterdeep and the North is a 1st-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
Waterdeep and the North was written by Ed Greenwood, with cover art by Keith Parkinson, and interior illustrations by Chris Miller. It was published by TSR in 1987 as a 64-page booklet with a large color map and an outer folder. Editing was by Karen S. Martin, and the supplement features heraldic escutcheons by David E. Martin and cartography by Frey Graphics and David C. Sutherland III. The City System product is intended as a companion to this volume.
Waterdeep and the North includes a large color map of the city, wrapped in a removable six-paneled gatefold cover. The map includes 281 locations in Waterdeep, detailed descriptions of 42 city guilds, brief info on 78 noble families with heraldry, and profiles of 43 NPCs with their typical locations The outside gatefold contains a 33" x 21" map of Waterdeep with major street names and a representation of the harbor, the inside front cover has a map of the citys known sewers, and the inside back cover has diagrams of basic floorplans that might be found throughout the city.
The book presents a brief geographical overview of the city, followed by its history. It also describes the laws and customs of the city, as well as its various guilds and factions. The book concentrates on providing a feel for life in the city, and gives descriptions for only a small number its buildings in any great detail. Waterdeep and the North provides a look at the workings of the city, details on its noble families, outlines of its various wards, and details on the services available. The citys guilds are detailed, including the locations of their headquarters, their livery, criteria for membership, and various interests and political connections. The book includes a number of NPCs of various levels and classes, all of whom can be used to interact with a band of adventurers as adversaries, friends, or people met during the daily routine of the city.
A map and some material from this book were removed prior to publication. This material was later published in Dragon #128, "Welcome to Waterdeep".
