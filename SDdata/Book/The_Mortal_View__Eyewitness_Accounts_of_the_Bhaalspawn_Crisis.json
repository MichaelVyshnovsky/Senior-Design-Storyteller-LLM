        "mainbody": "The Mortal View Eyewitness Accounts of the Bhaalspawn Crisis was a text written after the Bhaalspawn Crisis circa 1369 DR.These books describe the events of the original Baldurs Gate series, particularly Baldurs Gate, Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn and Baldurs Gate II Throne of Bhaal.\nThe Mortal View Eyewitness Accounts of the Bhaalspawn Crisis was a mass-produced tome of accounts. These books were cheaply made, which was apparent due to the poor-quality symbol of Bhaal printed on their fronts. The inside of the books were stamped with a guild seal from Baldurs Gate.\nThe accounts in this compiled text covered the main chapters of the crisis, with accounts from (or with regards to) Candlekeep, Nashkel, Amn, Athkatla, Saradush, and Baldurs Gate.\nSuch accounts differed in their takes on the crisis. There were hundreds of these accounts, for example\n*A particular contributor noted that Imoen would often cause trouble, and was accompanied by Abdel Adrian. The contributor was not surprised that Bhaals blood coursed through them.\n*An Amnian mercenary stated that the crisis reminded him of Sarevok, who was in league with the party that caused the Iron Crisis. He claimed that he never thought that Sarevok could be a Bhaalspawn.\n*A vampire loyal to Bodhi gave a distressed account, cursing both Bhaal and Irenicus in the process.\n*A merchant of Saradush described how The Five wreaked havoc through Tethyr and made it clear that they hoped the Bhaalspawn were all dead.\n*A Flaming Fist soldier gave his opinion on Bhaalspawn and would not comment further."
