        "mainbody": "'''''The Secret of Spiderhaunt''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure module for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.\n\n{{Quote|''The infamous ''[[Sword of the Dales]]'' has always held a certain fascination in the eyes and hearts of the citizens of the [[Dalelands]]. Thus, it was no surprise when [[Randal Morn]], rebel leader of [[Daggerdale]], led an expedition into the crypt of a long dead wizard to recover the weapon.''\n\n''[[Shraevyn]] the weapons-mage had created the ''Sword'' long ago, and it stood to reason that the blade would be waiting in his tomb. Perhaps the ''Sword of the Dales'' would allow Randal Morn to rule Daggerdale once again. But Randal Morn never returned from the fated party. Only tales of terror told by a lone survivor held any clues as to Randal's fate. A brave band of heroes accomplished what Randal Morn's group failed to do in part one of this trilogy ''[[The Sword of the Dales]]''.''\n\n''Battling through the tomb's undead inhabitants, those heroes reached the burial crypt of Shraevyn. There, resting in the center of the coffin, was the ''Sword of the Dales'', its azure glow filling the chamber. However, there was no sign of Randal Morn.''\n\n''Only a note signed by his hand held any clue as to his fate. \"Seek me in [[Spiderhaunt Wood|Spiderhaunt]],\" it proclaimed. \"The fate of Daggerdale is in your hands.\"''\n\n''This is the second part of a trilogy of modules which began with ''[[The Sword of the Dales]]''. The Saga concludes with ''[[The Return of Randal Morn]]''.''}}",
