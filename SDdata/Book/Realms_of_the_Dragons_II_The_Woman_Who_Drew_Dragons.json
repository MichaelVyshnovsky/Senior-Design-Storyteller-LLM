        "Summary": "At the [[Dragon Defeated]] tavern in [[Halfknot]], three dragon experts retell their exploits almost nightly. One of them, the dwarf [[Badger Bates]], is especially proud of having survived [[Malaeragoth]]'s revenge. A painter, [[Petra (painter)|Petra]], offers to paint the tavern a sign with a better-drawn dragon; despite her misgivings, she accepts the directive to paint a sign with these three dragon experts on it. The tavernkeeper decides to improve upon their advertising strategy by preparing a nightly contest for whoever has the most impressive dragon stories, and offering free drinks to those who share one.\n\nOn her last day in town, she questions the dragon experts' exploits and the stories by local dragon slayers, explaining that she paints dragons for a living. The dwarf, Bates, challenges her, bringing the conversation back to Malaeragoth, whom he claims only he has seen. She counters that she too has seen Malaeragoth, but the scrying-adept dragon is dangerous to paint. He sweetens the deal by offering a scale he took from after Malaeragoth's rampage, and double the coins offered that evening for the contest.\n\nPetra offers to paint on the wall. She draws him true, but Bates keeps demanding more and more detail, until it comes to the eyes, which he claims he and only he has seen and lived to tell the tale. Petra agrees, ultimately, to paint the eyes, but disclaims any responsibility for what comes next. Once she paints the eyes, she leaves quickly, grabbing the wagered gold without a word. As the dwarf claims the likeness isn't right, for Malaeragoth was much uglier, the picture comes to life and Malaeragoth emerges, destroying the tavern and killing Bates.\n\nThe tavern's owner decides that he'll get a sign with princesses next; it doesn't end well either.",
