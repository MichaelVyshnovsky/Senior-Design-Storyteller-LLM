{{Quote|Enter the [[Land of Fate]]!

You are a young pearl diver who is propelled into an amazing adventure when you uncork an old bottle you discover at the bottom of the sea.

You are whisked far from your home in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, on a magical quest to free the king of the [[marid|sea djinn]]. There are many decisions you must make along the way. You are courageous and clever, but can you hope to overcome the dangers that lie before you? Riches and fame could be yours if you choose the correct path.}}

==Synopsis==
[[Jamil]], a humble seventeen-year-old [[pearl diver]] from [[Jumlat]], the City of Multitudes, was one of the better young divers working for [[Essaf the Hungry]]. One day, Jamil, his friend [[Ubar (person)|Ubar]], and their fellow pearl divers were taken to a new, deeper diving spot in search of rare pink and black [[pearl]]s. Upon his second descent, Jamil noticed a strange glitter in the water. Thinking it was the infamous sea beast that's been killing sails outside of [[Gana]], Jamil took out his [[knife]]. One stab and he could be famous, rich, killing the beast. To his disappointment, the glinting came from an old shipwreck; it was a magic bottle. Running out of air but taken over by curiosity, Jamil heard a female voice in his head, pleading for her freedom. As he uncorked to bottle, a beautiful green-skinned [[marid]] appeared to him and enveloped his head in an air bubble.

Her name was [[Tala]], and she claimed to be a queen of the [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]], imprisoned sixty years prior by an aging [[sha'ir]] who pretended to be a friend. Her bottle was buried with a ship at the bottom of the [[Golden Gulf]], and her husband was imprisoned in a tower of [[Sikak]], the City of Coins. Tala asked for Jamil's help in freeing her beloved. She was not willing to accept "no" for an answer.
