'''''The Wizardwar''''', by [[Elaine Cunningham]], is the third book in the [[Counselors & Kings Trilogy]].

{{quote|''Defeat breeds anger. Hatred breeds revenge.''

''Once again, the counselors of [[Halruaa]] have beaten back an attack by the [[wizard]] [[Akhlaur]]. Once more, the kingdom has been saved from its enemies.''

''But victory comes at a terrible price. The aged king is weakened, his powers diminished. His chief counselor [[Matteo]] is torn between his duty and his heart. [[Tzigone]], the hero of the battle of [[Swamp of Akhlaur|Akhlaur's Swamp]], has been hurled into a dark world from which she may never escape. And at the edge of time, Akhlaur and his ally, the [[Magehound]], plot their final revenge.''}}
