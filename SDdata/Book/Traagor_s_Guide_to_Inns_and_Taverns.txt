'''''Traagor's Guide to Inns and Taverns''''' was a [[book|guidebook]] to the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], penned by [[Rooth Traagor|Rooth]] and [[Eldwin Traagor]] sometime in the mid- 4{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
Unlike many other guides to the cities of [[Faer√ªn]], ''Traagor's Guide to Inns and Taverns'' was designed to be useful for those who could read, as well as for those who could not. The book featured illustrations of the establishments' location, their signage, and ratings from one to four stars.

==History==
The guide was the creation of Rooth Traagor and her [[sage]] son, Eldwin. The duo ran [[Traagor's Tours and Souvenir Shop]] in Ravens Bluff, where the guidebook was sold for a single [[gold]] [[coin]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
