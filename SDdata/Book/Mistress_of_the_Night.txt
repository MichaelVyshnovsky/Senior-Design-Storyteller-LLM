Mistress of the Night by Don Bassingthwaite and Dave Gross is the second novel of The Priests series. It tells a story of two priestesses—one of Shar, the other of Selûne—and is set in Yhaunn in Sembia in 1373 DR. It is "a tale of magic, loyalty, and ritual," culminating in the retrieval of The Leaves of One Night by the Shadovar at the end of Eleasis in that year.
In the month of Kythorn, in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, a shade priestess named Variance Amatick requests permission from Rivalen Tanthul to  leave the city of Shade in search of an ancient text called The Leaves of One Night.
At the same time, in the city of Yhaunn in Sembia, an elderly priestess of Selûne begins having nightmares and magically sends a call for aid.
Two months later, in a small forest clearing outside Yhaunn at dusk, a werewolf named Feena morphs into her human form and begins to get dressed in the clothing that she has carried in a bundle as a wolf. Two bandits discover her half-naked and attempt to steal her silver holy symbol, but she knocks them both unconscious.
Feena enters the city and goes to Moonshadow Hall, the temple of Selûne there, where she is greeted by Mifano and Velsinore. Feena recognizes that there is a power struggle between the two priests. She asks to speak to the High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar, who she claims has magically sent for her.
Feena is surprised to find that Dhauna has grown very old and frail and seems not herself, even yelling at her assistant Julith. Dhauna explains that she had been having dreams from Selûne, which she believes indicate a conspiracy within Moonshadow Hall, and she asks why Feena took so long to come. Everyone then proceeds to the Full Moon Blessing. After the benediction, Dhauna shocks Feena by calling her forward and announcing her to be the High Moonmistress-Designate, Dhaunas successor.
