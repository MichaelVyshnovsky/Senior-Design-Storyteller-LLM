        "mainbody": "Galadasters Orizon was a spellbook written by the feared lich Galadaster.\nWith its circular electrum cover, the Orizon resembled a large coin approximately four handwidths across. It had six pages of vellum stretched over whistlecane frames and bound by a spiral of wire. Each page held a spell with instructions and runes.\nLiving in an isolated tower in what would become Amn, Galadaster undertook many adventures, returning to his tower with the treasures and valuable items he found. If he encountered a fellow mage on his travels, he often slew the mage and stole his magical possessions and spellbooks. His Orizon was a workbook which he compiled early in his travels, and later, he would regard it as a lesser work.\nAfter many years, wizards in the surrounding area became fearful and jealous of the power Galadaster held, and one day undertook a raid on his tower, seeking to destroy Galadaster and plunder his tower. By this point, Galadaster had transformed himself into a lich. After defeating his many traps and guardian creatures, the wizards finally encountered Galadaster. The ensuing battle was quite one-sided, and the wizards, in their desperation, launched a powerful final attack on the lich. The result not only destroyed the tower but killed the wizards themselves. Surviving the attack, Galadaster left the area, departing to the Nelanther Isles. The only item that survived the attack was the Orizon.\nBy around 1267 DR, the spellbook had come into the possession of the archmage Ilthong of Crimmor, and its contents were chronicled by an apprentice named Thelonn Bedelzar in his Bibliamagus. It was subsequently stolen and its location remained unknown through the mid-1300s DR.\nIn the late 1490s DR, the corpse of the Uthgardt Elk tribe warrior Ven Salafin, slain at the Battle of the Evermoors circa 1400 DR and briefly revived via speak with dead, considered Galadasters Orizon when asked by Edgin Darvis what his favorite book was, but he couldnt decide.\nThe Orizon contained six spells that Galadaster had recorded in his youth\nfirestaff &bull Geirdorns grappling grasp &bull Morgannavers sting &bull slumberward &bull spider climb &bull web"
