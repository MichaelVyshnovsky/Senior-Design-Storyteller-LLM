        "mainbody": "'''''Galadaster's Orizon''''' was a [[spellbook]] written by the feared [[lich]] [[Galadaster]].",
        "Description": "With its circular [[electrum]] cover, the ''Orizon'' resembled a large coin approximately four handwidths across. It had six pages of [[vellum]] stretched over [[whistlecane]] frames and bound by a spiral of wire. Each page held a [[spell]] with instructions and runes.",
        "History": "Living in an isolated tower in what would become [[Amn]], Galadaster undertook many adventures, returning to his tower with the treasures and valuable items he found. If he encountered a fellow mage on his travels, he often slew the mage and stole his magical possessions and spellbooks. His ''Orizon'' was a workbook which he compiled early in his travels, and later, he would regard it as a lesser work.\n\nAfter many years, wizards in the surrounding area became fearful and jealous of the power Galadaster held, and one day undertook a raid on his tower, seeking to destroy Galadaster and plunder his tower. By this point, Galadaster had transformed himself into a [[lich]]. After defeating his many traps and guardian creatures, the wizards finally encountered Galadaster. The ensuing battle was quite one-sided, and the wizards, in their desperation, launched a powerful final attack on the lich. The result not only destroyed the tower but killed the wizards themselves. Surviving the attack, Galadaster left the area, departing to the [[Nelanther Isles]]. The only item that survived the attack was the ''Orizon''.\n\nBy around [[1267 DR]], the spellbook had come into the possession of the [[archmage]] [[Ilthong]] of [[Crimmor]], and its contents were chronicled by an apprentice named [[Thelonn Bedelzar]] in his ''[[Bibliamagus]]''. It was subsequently stolen and its location remained unknown through the mid-1300s [[DR]].\n\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]], the corpse of the [[Uthgardt]] [[Elk tribe]] warrior [[Ven Salafin]], slain at the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] ''circa'' [[1400 DR]] and briefly revived via ''[[speak with dead]]'', considered ''Galadaster's Orizon'' when asked by [[Edgin Darvis]] what his favorite book was, but he couldn't decide.<ref>",
        "Contents": "The ''Orizon'' contained six spells that Galadaster had recorded in his youth:\n\n:''[[firestaff]]'' &bull; ''[[Geirdorn's grappling grasp]]'' &bull; ''[[Morgannaver's sting]]'' &bull; ''[[slumberward]]'' &bull; ''[[spider climb]]'' &bull; ''[[web]]''"
