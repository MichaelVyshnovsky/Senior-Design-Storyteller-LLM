        "mainbody": "The Simbuls Gift, by Lynn Abbey, is the sixth and last book in the loosely-connected The Nobles series.\nThe Simbul rules Aglarond while thinking of her lover Lailomum Zerad, who had been killed by Mythrellaa, a Red Wizard who became Zulkir of Illusion. \nAbroin, a half-elf who moved out of the Yuirwood with his mother Shali after his father fell to his death, helps his human stepfather, Adentir, birth a horse. The horse’s mother was mysteriously impregnated after a trip to the Yuirwood, and after its birth, he experiences a vision of Zandilar, a lost Yuir goddess. \nThe Simbul becomes aware and watches from afar. She plans to claim the horse, named Zandilar’s Dancer, to use it to convince Elminster to help her have a child. Her nephew, Boesild Aerasumé, warns her of Thayan infiltrators in Nethra. \nZulkirs scheme against the Simbul and each other, including Lauzoril, Zulkir of Enchantment (and his undead father and grandfather, Chazsinal and Gweltaz, and Aznar Thrul, Zulkir of Invocation, and his spy Neema Gaz. These two sent agents to Nethra, who avoided the Simbul’s notice and only became discovered when they attacked each other. \nAgents of Mythrell’aa attack Sulaik, killing Shali and Adentir. The Simbul flees with Zandilar’s Dancer, accidentally bringing along Abroin and his human sister Taefaeli and traveling through time into the Yuirwood. The Simbul returns to Velprintalar with Taefali, while Abroin encounters what appears to be his father, who says he will return the Yuir gods and remove Aglarond’s humans. It is revealed that Lailomum is still alive, a prisoner of Mythrell’aa. Laozoril begins teaching his daughter Mimuay magic. \nThe Simbul meets Alustriel Silverhand and travels to Everlund, to question Evermeet sages about Zandilar. Mythrell’aa calls for a Convocation of Zulkirs. Neema turns against Aznar after she feels disrespected. Reznar leads a group of elves through the forest, followed by the Simbul, a forester in her service named Trovar Halaern, wizards sent by Aznar Thrul, and Mythrell’aa. \nFerrin, a spirit that has been communicating with Mimuay, is absorbed by Gweltaz, so Laozoril destroys Chazsinal and Gweltaz and goes to the Yuirwood after his daughter sees Abroin while scrying on a dagger, once given to the Simbul until she passed it onto Abroin, and wants to protect him. The Simbul kills all the Red Wizards in the forest but Mythrell’aa. Thrul discovers Neema’s betrayal and kills her, as well as Deaizul, her master who had been possessing Reznar. They convene at the Sunglade, where the Simbul dances and awakens the Yuir gods’ remnants. Mythrell’aa arrives and sends Lailomum with a destruction spell to kill the Simbul, but Laozoril frees him and strikes Mythrell’aa so that Lailomum is able to kill her instead. The Simbul realizes that there is an old Yuir god also named The Simbul.\nSimbul • Ebroin • Rizcarn • Alustriel • Lauzoril\nYuir pantheon (Magnar • Zandilar the Dancer • The Simbul (Yuir) • Relkath of the Infinite Branches)\nAglarond • Yuirwood • Sunglade • Thay • Bezantur\nCinnabar\nSimbuls Gift\nCategoryBooks\nCategoryWorks by Lynn Abbey\nCategoryPublished in 1997\navlpmx6rnmvfv3sytsea6j4yht16pqs"
