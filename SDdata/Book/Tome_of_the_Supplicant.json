        "mainbody": "Tomes of the Supplicant were enchanted prayer books imbued with divine magics, created sometime before 1281 DR.\nA typical Tome of the Supplicant was a thick and heavy book of illuminated vellum. Its pages were filled with countless short prayers with their words imbued with words of power and calling.\nWhen read out loud once per day, Tomes of the Supplicant bestowed divine favor upon individuals that read or listened to the words of power. This effect was similar to the prayer spell.\nTomes of the Supplicant could only be used by clerics.\nIn the , the library of the Black Raven Monastery, in the mountains above the Ice Lakes and the Black Raven River, owned a Tome of the Supplicant and was willing to part it with a hefty fee."
