'''''Cherlrigo's Darkness''''' was, supposedly, the translation (by [[Cherlrigo]]) of a sonnet that could be found within ''[[The Leaves of One Grass]]'', a work of prophetic yet cryptic messages penned by the [[Dark Diviners]] of [[Windsong Tower]] in [[Myth Drannor]].

{{Quote|Enjoy the play when shadows steal the day...<br/>
All the world is half the world for those who learn to walk.<br/>
To feast on fungus soft and peel the sunlit stalk;<br/>
Tarry not in place, for in their sleep the gods do stay.<br/>
But care be known, be light of foot and soft of voice.<br/>
Dare not stir divine to hasten Sunder's day!<br/>
A loss profound but a short ways away;<br/>
The inevitable tear shall't be of, or not of, choice.<br/>
Oh, aye, again the time wandering of lonely world!<br/>
With kingdoms lost and treasures past the finger's tip,<br/>
And enemies that stink of their god's particular flavor.<br/>
Sundered and whole, across the celestial spheres are hurled,<br/>
Beyond the reach of dweomer and the wind-walker's ship,<br/>
With baubles left for the ones the gods do favor.|An excerpt from ''Cherlrigo's Darkness''}}

This particular passage was thought to have originally been written two thousand years before the mid-fifteenth century [[Dale Reckoning]] and was heralded by many [[Shadovar]] nobles and sages, including [[Draygo Quick]], [[Parise Ulfbinder]] and [[Prince Rolan|Rolan]] of [[Gloomwrought]] to directly relate to the power of the [[Shadowfell]] and have something to do with the [[Chosen]].
