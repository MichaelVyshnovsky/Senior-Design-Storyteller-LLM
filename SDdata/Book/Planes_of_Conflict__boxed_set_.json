        "mainbody": "Planes of Conflict is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set. It is part of the Planescape campaign setting.\nPlanes of Conflict was designed by Dale Donovan, Colin McComb, and Monte Cook, and was published by TSR in 1995. The box cover artist is Robh Ruppel, the book cover artists are Tony DiTerlizzi and Robh Ruppel, and the interior artist is Tony DiTerlizzi. \nPlanes of Conflict contains six maps and five manuals. The set details the Beastlands, Bytopia, Elysium, Carceri, Gehenna, and the Gray Waste. These planes provide the checks and balances that hold all the other planes in place, despite Law and Chaos trying to control these planes and swing the multiverse their way.\nEach of these planes drains the lawful and chaotic tendencies from the personalities of characters who spend time on them, each plane bending characters to its own form of neutrality. This set breaks down the nature, inhabitants, and ecosystems of these six worlds using the quotes, pictures, and slang in signature Planescape style, presenting information as a mixture of gossip, observation, and conjecture.\nThe referees manual concisely provides a foundation on which to build a game while leaving enough freedom to allow the referee to work creatively. The set includes four quick-start adventures that illustrate what these planes have to offer.\nLiber Benevolentiae\n* Into Conflict\n* The Savage Beauty of the Beastlands\n* The Pastoral Splendor of Bytopia\n* The Untarnished Good of Elysium\nLiber Malevolentiae\n* The Dark of Conflict\n* The Eternal Prison of Carceri\n* The Fiery Slopes of Gehenna\n* The Endless Despair of the Grey Waste\nA Players Guide to Conflict\n* A Tour of Conflict\n* The Beastlands Into the Wild\n* Bytopia Between Two Heavens\n* Carceri Inside the Prison\n* Elysium Under Azure Skies\n* Gehenna Through the Flames\n* The Grey Waste Within the Glooms\nAdventures in Conflict\n* Into the Land of the Dead\n* Militancy Justifies the Means\n* Prison Break\n* Beyond the Forbidden Plateau\nMonstrous Supplement\n* Acserpent\n* Asuras\n* Buraq\n* Delphon\n* Diakk\n* Ethyk\n* Gautiere\n* Linqua\n* Niiath\n* Phiuhl\n* Quesar\n* Slasrath\n* Vaath\n* Warden Beast\n* Yugoloth, Grearer - Baernaloth\n Cumulus Longstride • Galvan Longarms • Onazak Throateater • Sadik el-Huari\nPlanes of Conflict Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nLiber Benevolentiae Cover.jpg|Liber Benevolentiae Cover\nLiber Malevolentiae Cover.jpg|Liber Malevolentiae Cover\nA Players Guide to Conflict Cover.jpg|A Players Guide to Conflict Cover\nAdventures in Conflict Cover.jpg|Adventures in Conflict Cover\nLiber Benevolentiae\n* Designer Dale Donovan\n* Developer and Editor Michele Carter\n* Creative Director Andria Hayday\n* Cover Artists Tony DiTerlizzi and Robh Ruppel \n* Cover Photography Michael DeHoog\n* Interior Artist Tony DiTerlizzi \n* Poster Cartography Rob Lazzaretti (fronts), David C.
