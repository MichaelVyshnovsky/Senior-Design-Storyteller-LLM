It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|'''''On the Great Ring, six planes lie in direct opposition. Above looms the triad of Good, holding fast against the tide of corruption. Below lurks the triad of Evil, stained red by the eternal Blood War. Both resist the pull of Law and Chaos. Any berk who calls them \"neutral\" planes has never experienced their full extremes!'''''\n\n''Dare to enter the conflict and find:''\n\n* '''''Two 64-page books''''' ''describing each plane and its inhabitants for the Dungeon Master, with details on the monsters, realms, sites, and dangers of each plane.''\n* '''''A Player's Guide to Conflict,''''' ''a 32-page full-color introduction to the wonders and hazards of the planes, for DM and player alike.

        "Description": "''Planes of Conflict'' was designed by [[Dale Donovan]], [[Colin McComb]], and [[Monte Cook]], and was published by TSR in 1995. The box cover artist is [[Robh Ruppel]], the book cover artists are [[Tony DiTerlizzi]] and Robh Ruppel, and the interior artist is Tony DiTerlizzi. \n\n''Planes of Conflict'' contains six maps and five manuals. The set details the [[Beastlands]], [[Bytopia]], [[Elysium]], [[Carceri]], [[Gehenna]], and the [[Gray Waste]]. These planes provide the checks and balances that hold all the other planes in place, despite Law and Chaos trying to control these planes and swing the multiverse their way.\n\nEach of these planes drains the lawful and chaotic tendencies from the personalities of characters who spend time on them, each plane bending characters to its own form of neutrality. This set breaks down the nature, inhabitants, and ecosystems of these six worlds using the quotes, pictures, and slang in signature ''Planescape'' style, presenting information as a mixture of gossip, observation, and conjecture.\n\nThe referee's manual concisely provides a foundation on which to build a game while leaving enough freedom to allow the referee to work creatively. The set includes four quick-start adventures that illustrate what these planes have to offer.",
