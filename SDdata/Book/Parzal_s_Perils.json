        "mainbody": "arzals Perils was an autobiographical book written by the arcanist Parzal the Outrageous in the land of ancient Netheril.\nThe book was an account of Parzals eventful life up till that point, including the destruction of his family at the hands of a mysterious sohei, his wandering in the Dunes of Death, his time at Monastery of the West Wind, and the adventures that followed afterwards.\nParzal initially had 1,000 copies transcribed for sale, but the initial run quickly sold out due to the incredible story within. Mortimar took note of his potential, and together they collaborated on building the chain of shops that included QM III."
