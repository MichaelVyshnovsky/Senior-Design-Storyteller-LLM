'''''Art Appraisal''''' was a [[book]] with a self-explanatory title, penned by [[Gonner Maude]] and published sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Mitcher and Webson tell us in their excellent breakdown of the craft that good art replicates life whilst great art overcomes life. That morning, at seven years old with unlaced shoes and a friction burn on my butt from scooting too fast across the floor, I learned the truth of that, and its corollary: that while overcoming that strange thing called life, great art can gobble it up just as easily.''|Excerpt from ''Art Appraisal''}}

==Content==
The book combined musings and autobiographical elements from Gonner's childhood. One day, when the author was still a single-year-old child living in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], Gonner's mother informed him that his stepfather had gone mad. The author assumed that it was more of an artistic obsession â€“ a man locking himself in the studio, painting for three days straight, but it was not the case. The artist stepfather attacked the author's mother with a sharpened brush. As such, Gonner Maude stated that the art was a funny thing. The book continued on talking about [[Mitcher]] and [[Webson]]'s thoughts and definition of what art was and how it replicated real life, whilst great art overcame life.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Art Appraisal'' could be found in one of the homes of the [[Jannath (family)|Jannath]] [[patriar]] family in [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Lower City]].
