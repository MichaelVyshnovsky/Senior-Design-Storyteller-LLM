Art Appraisal was a book with a self-explanatory title, penned by Gonner Maude and published sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
The book combined musings and autobiographical elements from Gonners childhood. One day, when the author was still a single-year-old child living in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep, Gonners mother informed him that his stepfather had gone mad. The author assumed that it was more of an artistic obsession â€“ a man locking himself in the studio, painting for three days straight, but it was not the case. The artist stepfather attacked the authors mother with a sharpened brush. As such, Gonner Maude stated that the art was a funny thing. The book continued on talking about Mitcher and Websons thoughts and definition of what art was and how it replicated real life, whilst great art overcame life.
In the , a copy of Art Appraisal could be found in one of the homes of the Jannath patriar family in Baldurs Gates Lower City.
