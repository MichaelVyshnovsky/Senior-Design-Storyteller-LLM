The Collectanea Rubrum was an arcanabula that outlined all manner of dark arcana and malign formulae.
The script of The Collectanea was a combination of plain writing and esoteric runes.
The book outlined the process of transmuting metals, specifications of craftable weapons, alchemical recipes, and information regarding the reanimation of dead flesh.
