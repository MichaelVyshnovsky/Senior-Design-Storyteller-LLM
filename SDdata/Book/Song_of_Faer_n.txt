The '''''Song of Faerûn''''' was a lengthy mysterious ballad that prophesied the history of [[Faerûn]] and was performed at the dawn of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by the man only known as the [[Bard]] of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Neither the full length of the ''Song of Faerûn'' nor its full lyrics were known, as the ballad manifested itself in parts when it was ''[[divination|divined]]'', apparently remaining in a constant state of flux.

One part of the ''Song of Faerûn'' prophesied the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s invasion, led by [[Kya Mordrayn]] and [[Pelendralaar]], of the ancient ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. It included the cult's weakening and corruption of the city's ''[[mythal]]'' and planned corruption of the [[Weave]] through the city's ''[[pool of radiance]]''. The song named the adventurers who stood against the Cult, the [[Veiled Ones]], and their few allies within the ruins.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], an undead [[elf|elven]] diviner [[Caalenfaire]] and his ''[[familiar]]'' [[Volun]] were able to catch the following verse of the song:
{{Quote|
''In Cormanthor did mage Mordrayn''<br />''Speak spells of greed in Words of flame;''<br />''With poison troth she soon unmade''<br />''Proud treasure of the Silver Blade;''<br />''And by her side, Pelendralaar,''<br />''Their minds as one, come from afar;''<br />''Dark creatures drown the city bright,''<br />''the dragon’s kin, the elf of night;''<br />''The Pool! The Pool! It grows, and yet,''<br />''One small band against it set.''}}

Guided by the two verses, the undead diviners were able to give guidance to the Veiled Ones, the heroes whose destiny was veiled by the shadows, pointing them towards the allies within the city ruins. Eventually, this prophecy led to the Cult of the Dragon's defeat. It was followed by one more verse of the song that celebrated the victory and the ''pool of radiance's'' dispersion.
