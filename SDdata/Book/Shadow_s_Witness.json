        "Summary": "[[Krollir Venasten]], Righteous Man of the [[Night Knives]] in [[Selgaunt]] and follower of [[Mask]], summons Ysrillar, a greater [[Dread (demon)|dread]], to destroy the [[Zhentarim]]. His lieutenant [[Drasek Riven]] reveals himself as a Zhentarim agent and destroys the binding circle, leaving Krollir for dead. However, Ysrillar possesses Krollir instead of killing him. He then summons two lesser dreads, Araniskeel and Greeve.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jak Fleet]], [[halfling]] thief and [[Harpers|Harper]], breaks into the [[Soargyl]] mansion to steal an item from Lord Boarim Soargyl’s bedroom, to serve as his holy symbol for [[Brandobaris]]. He succeeds, but witnesses the lord and lady Soargyl killed by one of the dreads.\n\nAraniskeel leads many members of the Night Knives, turned into [[Ghoul|ghouls]], in an attack on [[Stormweather Towers]] during a birthday celebration for [[Thamalon Uskevren|Thamalon Uskevren's]] brother Perivel, long presumed dead. Many nobles are slaughtered and [[Thazienne Uskevren]] is wounded. [[Erevis Cale]], a Night Knife spy who was embedded in the Ursekvern family and eventually became loyal to them, developing a friendship with Thamalon and romantic feelings for Thazienne, drives Araniskeel off.\n\nRiven meets with Verdrinal, a higher-ranking member of the Zhentarim. With their leader, Malix, reporting to [[Fzoul Chembryl]], Verdrinal is in charge of the Selgaunt Zhentarim. Verdrinal says that the Zhentarim plan to do nothing, as the demon is targeting rival guilds and noble families more than the Zhentarim.\n\nAs Thazienne recovers, Erevis Cale goes to the guildhouse, realizing Krollir has been possessed by Ysrillar. Ysrillar speaks of Champions of Mask. A mysterious appearance of a wall of darkness allows him to escape. He contacts Brelgin, leader of the Harpers in the city, while searching for Jak, finding him comatose in a temple of [[Deneir]]. However, after Erevis touches Jak, he regains consciousness. Upon learning that Brelgin is unwilling to help fight the demon, Jak returns his Harper pin.\n\nJak theorizes that Mask is sending signs and aid to Erevis. Elsewhere, Riven kills Verdrinal. In the guildhouse, Erevis and Jak discover gates opening to the [[Abyss]]. When the two are are retrieving enchanted weapons, a black facemask, the symbol of Mask, seems to appear to Erevis, and he takes it. Erevis kills Araniskeel, but both he and Jak fall through gates and find themselves in the Abyss.\n\nErevis seems to instinctively cast a spell protecting himself from the energy of the hostile plane. They discover a mirror version of the guildhouse and are able to slay all the ghouls by attacking their insubstantial manifestations on the Abyss. They kill Greeve and return to the Prime Material Plane. Erevis accepts his position as Champion of Mask and banishes Ysrillar. In his final moments, Krollir reveals that Riven freed Ysrillar. Erevis threatens Riven and the rest of the Zhentarim in Selgaunt.",
