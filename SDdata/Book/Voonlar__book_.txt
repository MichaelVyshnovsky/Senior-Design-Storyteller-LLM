'''''Voonlar''''' was a guidebook for the city of the name name, penned sometime before [[1373 DR]].

==Contents==
The guide of [[Voonlar]] was a short book that talked about the small city being located northeast of [[Shadowdale]], between the roads that connected cities of [[Yûlash]] and [[Teshwave]]. The guide stated that Voonlar was a major trade competitor of the town of Shadowdale. The town's main trade was farming, with the most profitable farms located outdoes its walls. The city's history was over 600 years old, and despite that, there were not many notable events that took place in the town.

The authors warned travelers of Voonlar's misleading status as an independent city, as it was, in truth, a puppet of the infamous [[Black Network]]. However, Voonlar had no Zhentarim agents within its walls apart from the town's leaders.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, copies of the ''Voonlar'' could be found in all major cities of the [[Moonsea]] region.
