{{Quote|Lady of the [[Order of Twilight]].
Witch of the [[Gargauthan]]s.
[[Blood Magus]].

[[Morgynn]] seethed for years under the yoke of ignorance her mother enforced. Then death came for Morgynn, and after embracing it she was reborn with frightening powers of incredible strength.

When a wandering [[ghostwalker]] and a seer’s hubris provide the perfect opening to expand her dominion, she seizes the opportunity. But the ghostwalker is proving more trouble than she had bargained for...

[[James P. Davis]] explores a terrifying sorceress in a deadly battle of wits and steel.}}
