        "mainbody": "Moxys Mixology Manual was a book dedicated to the art of mixology and collecting numerous alcoholic drink recipes, penned sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.\nThe reader could consider Moxys to be a comprehensive guide to cocktails, despite its crass wording and the authors preference for the drinks made with gin-and-whiskey. The book also included recipes for vodka, vermouth, and rum and did not miss a chance to denigrate them as inferior. Lastly, the author recommended that readers never call themselves \"mixologists,\" professional, or amateur instead preferring the term \"bartender.\" Moxy clearly thought that calling oneself a mixologist made one sound like a \"pillock.\"\nIn the , a copy of Moxys Mixology Manual could be found in the hands of the proprietors of The Singing Lute eatery in the city of Baldurs Gate."
