'''"The Unicorn's Blessed Crescent"''' was a musical epic composed by [[Isla Donrig]] in [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].

In it, she made reference to the ruins of [[Phantoms' Cloister]], calling it "Ol' Fallen Man's monastery" and including the lines "it shifts from its prison, and into sight, luring others into its ancient plight."

Isla performed the epic in Loudwater sometime before she departed the city in [[Eleasis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.
