The world has changed since the [[Spellplague]], and from this [[arcane magic|arcane]] crucible have emerged shining kingdoms, tyrannical empires, mighty heroes, and monster-infested dungeons. The ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide'' presents a world of untold adventure, a land of a thousand stories shaped by the deeds of [[adventurer]]s the likes of which Faerûn has never seen before.''\n\n''This product includes everything a Dungeon Master needs to run a '''[[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]]''' campaign in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting, as well as elements that DMs can incorporate into their own '''D&D''' campaigns. The book provides background information on the lands of Faerûn, [[Loudwater|a fully detailed town]] in which to start a campaign, adventure seeds, new monsters, ready-to-play nonplayer characters, and a full-color poster map of Faerûn.''}}",
        "Contents": "The ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide'' is the first portion, followed by the ''[[Forgotten Realms Player's Guide]]'' of the 4th edition release of the ''Forgotten Realms'' campaign setting for the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' roleplaying game. Unlike previous releases, like the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|3rd edition variant]], the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide'', or FRCG, focuses solely on proving information for rules referees and storytellers known as DMs, rather than for players. This information is meant to help a DM build a campaign, either within the ''Realms'', or in a homebrewed setting, rather than for players to use to enhance their characters. Information for building characters is instead provided in the ''Forgotten Realms Player's Guide''.\n\nPartially as a consequence, the FRCG is slightly slimmer than the 3rd edition FRCS in page number, a fact which has given the false assumption that is undetailed. However, if one were to add the two books together, as is intended, the total page number exceeds that of the FRCS by more than a hundred page, though the word count per page is lower given the 4th edition formatting standards. The FRCG is also notable for moving the setting forward by a little over a century, to the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One]] whereas previous editions had moved it forward by a generation or so.\n\nThere are a total of eight chapters in the book, as follow:\n\n# '''Introduction''' — This brief preface provides DMs with a basic introduction to the new ''Realms'', including a list of ten \"important facts\" about the setting. It also encourages those who are not interested in using the setting as presented to alter it for their own purposes.\n# '''[[Loudwater]]''' — This chapter provides a sample town, Loudwater, for DMs to kick off their adventures. Also included are a series of encounters and adventure hooks, which can tie into the ''[[Scepter Tower of Spellgard]]'' adventure.\n# '''[[Adventurer|Adventuring]]''' — This chapter provides a brief history of the world, tips regarding how to move forward an adventure set in the 3rd edition setting, a summary of adventuring in the context of Faerûn's local culture, how to keep time in the ''Realms'', types of treasure that adventurers might uncover or find, and a glossary for terms specific to the ''Realms'' such as ''[[halfling|hin]]'' or tenday.\n# '''[[Portal:Magic|Magic]]''' — This chapter covers the basics of the [[Spellplague]] while also providing insights into fantastic landscapes created by magic such as [[earthmote]]s. The chapter also provides a listing of new [[:Category:Magic items|magic item]]s, such as the ''[[Crown Jewel of Chessenta]]'', and [[ritual]]s, such as ''[[Pact of the Iron Ring]]'', for use in the DM's campaign.\n# '''[[Cosmology]]''' — This chapter provides an insight into how the new 4th edition cosmology for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' applies to the ''Realms'', with a listing of the [[astral dominion]]s and [[elemental realm]]s as well as a description of the [[Feywild]] and [[Shadowfell]]. A brief sidebar on the [[Far Realm]] is also provided.\n# '''[[Portal:Deities|Pantheon]]''' — This chapter focuses on the [[deity|god]]s of the ''Realms'', with a listing of each of the major gods and [[exarch]]s of Faerûn. The book focuses primarily on the [[greater deity|greater deities]] but also provides some information on [[intermediate deity|intermediate deities]], exarchs, [[primordial]]s, and [[archdevil]]s.\n# '''[[Portal:Geography|Faerûn and Beyond]]''' — This chapter, the longest in the book, provides the reader with an atlas of Faerûn and [[Returned Abeir]], describing each of the major regions from each continent. Each entry provides a small map, some background lore, and potential adventure hooks. Faerûn's [[Underdark]] is also covered.\n# '''Threats''' — The final chapter in the book, this entry provides DMs with potential enemies to pit their players against, be they nefarious organizations such as the [[Cult of the Dragon]] or the [[Warlock Knights|Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] or individual monsters such as [[gibberling]]s or [[drow]]. A template for [[swordmage]] NPCs is also provided.",
