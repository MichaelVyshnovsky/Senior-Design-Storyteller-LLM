Meanwhile, Marlin Stormserpent heads for the Haunted Wing of the palace, where hes spotted briefly by Elminster and Alusair on his way to retrieve the Wyverntongue Chalice from the Dragonskull Chamber.
In the morning, almost certainly Mirtul 27, the nobleman Arclath Delcastle brings his friends Halance Tarandar and Belnar Buckmantle to the Dragonriders Club, to help them de-stress. While they talk, Amarune, who is also a mask dancer at the club, listens to their conversation out of curiosity.

The day after, almost certainly Mirtul 28, Arclath Delcastles breakfast at The Eel Revealed is interrupted by the War Wizard Glathra Barcantle, demanding what he knows of the murder of Halance Tarandar and Belnar Buckmantle she reveals Tarandar made note of the fact a mask dancer was listening in to their converse. Glathra assigns a messenger, Delnor, to stick with Arclath until the mask dancer is found. They find her entirely by chance, while Elminster and Storm make their way out of palace trying to disguise themselves as the Royal Magician, Ganrahast, and his second in command, Vainrence. Theyre spotted by Rorskryn Mreldrake, who explains hes just seen the two elsewhere while they are taken for questioning, an image of the Simbul appears and distracts the guards Elminster takes this as a sign she needs immediate aid, the two of them heading for the Dalestride Portal near the Room of the Watchful Sentinel. Arclath Delcastle waits for Amarune at the Club before her show, in her room she believes hes grown dangerously obsessed, and attacks him. Shes pulled off by the club owner, Tress, and the guards Arclath convinces them he paid her to do so. Amarune denies having spoken to anyone of what she overheard of their converse, or having been hired by anyone to eavesdrop on them.

Meanwhile in the Dales, the Simbul barely gains any respite from madness with the items Storm carries while leaving, Storm learns that theres a group trying to find Elminster, determined to search every cave, which must include the one where the Simbul is hidden.
At a tavern on the next day, almost certainly Mirtul 29, Marlin Stormserpent learns that another blueflame item in the possession of some noble is a largish hand axe. Eskrel Starbridge heads out with a team towards Shadowdale, where they intend to investigate Elminster once and for all. Arclath and Amarune finally make it to her lodgings there is a man murdered, whom she recognizes as Ruthgul. Then his face shifts, and he turns into Gaskur, a servant of House Stormserpent.

Windstag and his cronies locate the largish hand axe, steal it by force, and run back to Marlin Stormserpent he calls out the ghost, but instead, Mirt appears out of it. Eskrel Starbridges knights think they find Elminster in Shadowdale, but it is actually Storm Silverhand convincing them she is in fact a noble of Cormyr, that her title as Marchioness Immerdusk remains valid, she takes Eskrels teleport ring and returns to the Royal Crypt, where Elminster is.
