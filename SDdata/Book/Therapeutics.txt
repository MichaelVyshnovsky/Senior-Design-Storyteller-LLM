'''''Therapeutics''''' was a book of research into [[divination]] through oneiromancy, written by [[Margritt Oji]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Discussions with the oneiromancer yield nothing of merit so far. New incense and hallucinogens trigger nothing. Another fruitless day.''|Excerpt from ''Therapeutics.''}}

==Content==
Margritt Oji's work discussed the writer and researcher's attempts to trigger hallucinations through means that included certain types of [[incense]]. However, after numerous unsuccessful attempts to trigger dreams and visions, the oneiromancer in question resorted to taking an undisclosed substance recommended by her own clients. The woman refused to reveal the name of the substance, but it was a fruitful attempt. The oneiromancer's dreams ended up being captured in a painting on a nearby canvas, as intended.

The image was a stance one, depicting a different world, possibly [[Earth]] or [[Eberron]], or another similarly technologically advanced [[crystal sphere]]. The painting showed massive flying vehicles with what appeared to be some sort of windmills attached to their sides, like wings, and large wheeled locomotives that moved along the rails, with a single [[humanoid]] [[automaton]] waiving at the painting's observers.

==History==
A copy of ''Therapeutics'' ended up in the [[House of Healing]] in the town of [[Reithwin]], deposited there before the settlement was consumed by the [[shadow-cursed Lands]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. More copies could be found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
