An Opportunity for Profit by Dave Gross is the fifth novella in the Double Diamond Triangle Saga series.
Continuing their quest to assassinate Eidola of Neverwinter, Belmer Droons hired vessel was approaching the shores of Doegan. Shortly after Orim Redbeards ship left the Morning Bird, the crew noticed a magical rot that was devouring the hull, forcing the mercenaries to abandon the vessel and swim to the shore. Belmer Droon and his team, Belgin Dree, Brindra Arrose, Ingrar Welven, Jolloth Burbuck, Nargin Olnblade, Sharessa Stagwood, all survived the swim along with a big group of Jander Turbalts sailors. The old captain felt nothing but resentment for the ships loss, which was only exacerbated by the apparent threat of fiends and monsters who roamed the wilderness of Doegan.  The sinking ship survivors encountered grotesque monstrosities who swarmed them, pushing them away from the sore into the forest. A stray bone devil started hunting the group, slowly culling the survivors to a small number, as they fled through the first towards civilization. The creatures slew all the sailors but the Belmers gang. In one of the confrontations, the bone devil blinded Ingrar, and soon after, killed Brindra in one on one battle. Subsequently, the survivors reached the safety of Eldrinpar. There, captain Turbalt betrayed the group to the paladins of Tyr who recognized the mysterious Belmer. His true identity was that of the notorious assassin Artemis Entreri.
