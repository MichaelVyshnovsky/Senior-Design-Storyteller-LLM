'''''Dreams of the Red Wizards''''' is a 1{{st}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory that was set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. 

{{Quote|''The [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. As cruel and horrible as they are powerful, they have ruled their eastern realm for as long as any sage can remember. They can be powerful allies, or deadly enemies. The Red Wizards know the darkest secrets of the strongest magic, and will sell their skills to the highest bidder. [[Thay]] is a land of slavers and tyrants, of intrigue and murder, of danger and opportunity. In this book, the government, personalities, economy, cities, people, and wilderness of Thay are described for an [[Wikipedia:Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|AD&D]]<sup>&reg;</sup> campaign of any size or level. ''Dreams of the Red Wizards'' also includes new spells and magical items unique to the Red Wizards, plus a four-color map of Thay that can be added to the previously published maps of the [[Forgotten Realms]]!''}}
