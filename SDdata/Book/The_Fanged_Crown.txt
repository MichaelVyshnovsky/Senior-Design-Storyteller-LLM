The Fanged Crown by Jenna Helland is the first novel in The Wilds series.
In the , the crew of the Crane have taken on a job to check in on a Tethyrian colony in Chult at the request of Avalor, member of the Queens Privy Council. Harp, the ships owner and captain, is pleased that the job has paid off their debts and funded much-needed repairs and upgrades for the ship. The Crane is immediately attacked by the crew of the Marigold when they attempt to dock in a cove along the coast of Chult, but the Cranes crew is able to defend themselves and slay their attackers. One of the attackers, who Harp nicknames Bootman, suddenly turns ashen and begins to choke on nothing before being killed by Boult, one of the Cranes members. The crew theorize he had been affected by a spell, but are unsure who would have done such a thing. Harp and Boult discuss how the Marigold was seemingly lying in wait for them, prompting concerns from Boult that they may have been tipped off. Boult is suspicious of Avalor, but Harp trusts their patron and shares his belief that something or someone in Chult does not want anyone finding out what happened to the missing colonists.
Going back to 1469 DR, Knight-Confident of the Order of the Dark Sparrow Declan Cardew eagerly awaits the arrival of Evonne Linden at the Winter Palace of Tethyr, having last seen her after the Masque of the Siren childrens ball a month ago. However, an unusually thick fog has descended on the countryside, forcing Queen Anais Rhindaun and her entourage to spend the night in the village of Celleu. Amhar, one of the palace guards, argues with Cardew about a missing groundskeeper and a strange delivery of wood when another guard hurriedly informs them that there has been some kind of disturbance at the North Lions Gate. Cardew sends Amhar to investigate and goes to meet with Captain Landon Bratherwit, who had requested to see him. Cardew hopes to relocate to Tethyrs capital, Darromar, to better involve himself in the politics between Queen Anais and Evonne, and has heard rumor that Captain Bratherwit is looking for someone to fill a position in the city. Cardew thinks back to his first true encounter with Evonne a month prior, when she had called him to her private study to discuss what information he discovered while observing the members of the court at the childrens ball. Cardew recalls the strange red scars he noted on Evonnes hand, and thinks fondly of the tantalizingly charged encounter they shared.
