'''''Flow of the Chionthar''''' was a geographical [[book]] that described the [[River Chionthar]] on which the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] was built, penned sometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Content==
The book collected geography and history of the River Chionthar. It stated that the river passed half a dozen settlements that grew along its shores over the years. The book also covered the river's orange-tinted water and many trade barges that traveled its waters, filled with casked [[wine]], [[salt pork|salted pork]], [[spice]]s, and [[herb]]s like [[rosemary]].

==History==
Copies of ''Flow of the Chionthar'' were known to exist around the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} when the village of [[Reithwin]] was plunged into the [[Sharran]] [[Shadow-cursed lands|curse]], as one copy was found in the abandoned [[Last Light Inn]] on the outskirts of Reithwin, seemingly undamaged by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Another copy belonged to the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]] and was stored in her home in the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate.
