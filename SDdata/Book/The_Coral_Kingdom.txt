The Coral Kingdom, by Douglas Niles, is the second book in the Druidhome trilogy.
Talos aligns with Malar and gives Deirdre Kendrick a scrying mirror, through which he and Malar can spy on the Kendricks. Coss Axell Sinioth delivers Tristan Kendricks hand and a ransom demand to Robyn Kendrick at the moot to determine the new king. Robyn, Alicia Kendrick, Hanrald Blackstone, Keane, Pawldo, and Brandon Olaffson set off to try to rescue him. Knowing that elves once could send ships below the sea, they head to Myrloch Vale, which is under attack by Ityak-Ortheel, the Elf-Eater, a legendary demon sent by Malar. The Elf-Eater wreaks devastation on Myrloch Vale and kills Pawldo before being banished by Keane, with the help of Deirdre. Brigit joins the group, revealing that the magic they seek is in Evermeet. They sail to Evermeet on Brandon’s new ship, the Princess of Moonshae, pursued by scrags and sahuagin and Coss Axell Sinioth in the form of a giant squid. They successfully enter Evermeet, and are met with initial xenophobia but eventual acceptance. They meet with Amlaruil Moonflower and are gifted a Helm of Zulae that will bring their ship to the bottom of the sea. Tristan Kendrick begins to escape alongside Marqillor, a merman king, and the Princess of Moonshae rescues him. Talos gives Deirdre Coss Axell-Sinioth’s true name to punish him for his failure, then shatters the scrying mirror and pierces her with its shards, intending to use her as an avatar.
