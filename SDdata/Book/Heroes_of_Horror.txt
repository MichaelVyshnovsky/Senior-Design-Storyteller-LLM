{{Quote|
'''In the Dungeon, No One Can Hear You Scream'''

A darkness deeper than the blackest pit. A dread whisper carried on a chill wind. A disturbing sound echoing in the night. The trappings of horror spice up any D&D game, whether used to build a terrifying encounter, a frightening adventure, or a horrific campaign. Get to the root of what really scares you, the things that go bump in the night, and see what happens when the heroes of D&D bump back!

This book provides Dungeon Masters with a toolkit for adding the elements of horror to any D&D game, including tips and advice for infusing an adventure with everything from creepiness to unease to nightmares and despair. It features new rules to evoke a sense of dread and foreboding, new monsters and templates, and ways to use existing monsters in horrific and unsettling ways.

For players, this book offers two new standard classes, new prestige classes, feats, spells and magic items designed to help hold off the encroaching darkness for another night. From the archivist and the dread necromancer, to the fiend-blooded and the tainted scholar, you’ll discover ways to prepare your hero—or antihero—for the struggle against fear itself.|Back-cover text}}
