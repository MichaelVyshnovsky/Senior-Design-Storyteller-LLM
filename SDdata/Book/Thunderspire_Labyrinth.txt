'''''Thunderspire Labyrinth''''' is an adventure module for the core setting of the 4th-edition ruleset of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

{{quote|''Beneath [[Thunderspire Mountain]] lies a sprawling network of mazes, tombs, and caverns collectively known as the [[Labyrinth|Labyrinth of Lost Souls]]. In recent years, this vast labyrinth has become a living dungeon from which trade between the surface and [[Underdark|subterranean]] worlds is possible. However, beyond the well-lit halls where prospectors, merchants, and traders convene lies a darker world where adventurers battle monsters and fiendish beings perform secret rituals for their dark masters.''

H2 Thunderspire Labyrinth ''is a D&D adventure designed for heroic-tier characters of levels 4th-6th. It is the second adventure in a three-part series that began with H1 Keep on the Shadowfell and concludes with H3 Pyramid of Shadows. It can also be played as a stand-alone adventure.''

''This product includes an adventure booklet for the Dungeon Master, a player's booklet containing new character options and campaign information, and a full-color poster map.''}}

==Behind the scenes==
While ''Thunderspire Labyrinth'' was designed initially for the "points of light" core setting of 4th edition, alterations to the adventure made in an article of [[Dungeon magazine|''Dungeon'' magazine]] made it possible to use it as a dungeon for characters in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. These changes included changing the focus on Vecna to that of [[Cyric]] and relocating [[Thunderspire Mountain]] to a geographical location in [[Faer√ªn]] near [[Cormyr]].
