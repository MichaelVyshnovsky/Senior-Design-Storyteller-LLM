Thunderspire Labyrinth is an adventure module for the core setting of the 4th-edition ruleset of Dungeons & Dragons.
While Thunderspire Labyrinth was designed initially for the "points of light" core setting of 4th edition, alterations to the adventure made in an article of Dungeon magazine made it possible to use it as a dungeon for characters in the Forgotten Realms. These changes included changing the focus on Vecna to that of Cyric and relocating Thunderspire Mountain to a geographical location in Faer√ªn near Cormyr.
