{{quote|''Looking back over the last three centuries of [[Sword Coast]] history, it is simply bewildering why [[wizard]]s aren't ruling everywhere. They have the power, despite all the resentment–and ready [[sword]]s—of those who do not. Yet time and again they make mistakes, or do wildly foolish things, and either lose grip on thrones, or miss seizing them in the first place. And in the end, I can nd only one possible reason: all wizards are crazy.''|An excerpt from ''Tathaero's Short Sword Coast Chronicle''}}
