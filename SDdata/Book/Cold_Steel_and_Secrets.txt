{{quote|'''''Part I'''''

''Sent by the spymaster of [[Neverwinter]] to investigate a group of rebels, [[Rucas Sarfael]] finds a worthy adversary in the beautiful fencing master [[Elyne]]. Matching wits and blades with the rebel leader, Rucas strives to prove himself and rise in the rebel ranks in part 1 of this four-part novella set in the renowned city of Neverwinter.''

'''''Part II'''''

''A whiff of brimstone, a laughing [[ghost]], and talk of a crown... In part 2 of this four-part Neverwinter novella, Rucas Sarfael finds himself invited to a meeting of rebel leaders and entangled more than he would like in the plans of the beautiful and dangerous Elyne. When those plans lead to a mad seer, Rucas finds a clue to the treasure he seeks—and more than one path to doom.''

'''''Part III'''''

''A mysterious key, the walking dead, and a grisly murder... The four-part Neverwinter novella continues as the rebels find the lost ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'' in their grasp. But the rebels are betrayed and Rucas Sarfael finds himself caught between his duty and his heart.''

'''''Part IV'''''

''Deception! Betrayal! A perfect partnership! In the conclusion to this four-part novella, Rucas Sarfael uncovers the twisted plots that brought him to the city of Neverwinter and discovers a plot on the life of its lord.''}}
