Caravans is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.
Caravans is an Al-Qadim adventure in which the eponymous caravan serves to move the characters (levels 5â€“9) across the High Desert in western Zakhara. If the player characters feed ancient poetry to Alai the Hungry during the adventure, Alai gives them clues by blacking in parts of its weave. Other encounters include a talking tent, weird lightning on a high rock spire, broom-wielding copper automatons, giant roc skeletons, bug-eating centaurs, and an efreeti palace beneath the Pit of Ghuls.
