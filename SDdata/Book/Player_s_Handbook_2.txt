Players Handbook 2 is a core sourcebook for 4-edition Dungeons & Dragons published in 2009. It introduces the deva, gnome, goliath, half-orc, and shifter races and the avenger, barbarian, bard, druid, invoker, shaman, sorcerer, and warden classes, and additional options for these and other 4-edition player-characters.
The fourth core rulebook in the 4-edition ruleset for the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, the Players Handbook 2, or PHB2, is meant to be used alongside the original 4-edition Players Handbook by players for building their characters. The PHB2 includes, among other things, races and classes that were considered "core" in previous editions but were excluded in the initial release of 4 edition. It also adds a number of unique races and classes, as a well as several new paragon paths and epic destinies. The book also includes a number of new feats, powers, and rituals.
The book is slightly slimmer than the first Players Handbook, as it lacks details on how to introduce new players to the game or an explanation of how the rules work.
The book is organized into four chapters, as follows
# Introduction This brief foreword, among other things, introduces players to the new primal power source with a basic explanation of its origins and nature.
# Races This chapter introduces the new core races devas, gnomes, goliaths, half-orcs, and shifters. The chapter also includes a new paragon path for each of the core races, including those from the previous Players Handbook, such as adroit explorers for humans.
# Classes Core classes from the arcane, divine, and primal power sources are presented here avengers, barbarians, bards, druids, invokers, shamans, sorcerers, and wardens. New paragon paths and epic destinies are also presented, such as the blood moon stalker, the wild mage, or the lorekeeper.
# Character Options This chapter includes new backgrounds based on societal status, circumstances of birth, or race for players to use, along with new feats, equipment, and rituals. An appendix at the end of the chapter also includes a brief explanation of how to read power cards as well as a revision of the stealth rules for the Dungeons & Dragons.
