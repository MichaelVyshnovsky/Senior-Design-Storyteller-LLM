'''Heroes of Primal Might and Ancient Power'''

From the bright towns and darkened wilderness they come: mighty heroes intent on exploring dungeons, slaying monsters, and battling evil.

This companion to the ''Player's Handbook''® core rulebook introduces the primal power source, which draws on the spirits that preserve and sustain the world. ''Player's Handbook 2'' includes four classes tied to the primal power source: the barbarian, the druid, the shaman, and the warden. It also presents four new arcane and divine classes: the avenger, the bard, the invoker, and the sorcerer.

This essential book for D&D® players contains other exciting options, including new races, powers, feats, paragon paths (including racial paragon paths), epic destinies, magic items (including totems), rituals, and a background section designed to help you develop your character’s history and personality.|Back-cover text}}

==Contents==
The fourth core rulebook in the 4{{th}}-edition ruleset for the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' roleplaying game, the ''Player's Handbook 2'', or PHB2, is meant to be used alongside the original 4{{th}}-edition ''[[Player's Handbook 4th edition|Player's Handbook]]'' by players for building their characters. The PHB2 includes, among other things, races and classes that were considered "core" in previous editions but were excluded in the initial release of 4{{th}} edition. It also adds a number of unique races and classes, as a well as several new [[:Category:Paragon paths|paragon paths]] and [[:Category:Epic destinies|epic destinies]]. The book also includes a number of new feats, powers, and [[ritual]]s.

The book is slightly slimmer than the first ''Player's Handbook'', as it lacks details on how to introduce new players to the game or an explanation of how the rules work.

The book is organized into four chapters, as follows:
# '''Introduction''': This brief foreword, among other things, introduces players to the new primal power source with a basic explanation of its origins and nature.
# '''Races''': This chapter introduces the new core [[:Category:Inhabitants by race|races]]: [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]], [[gnome]]s, [[goliath]]s, [[half-orc]]s, and [[shifter]]s. The chapter also includes a new paragon path for each of the core races, including those from the previous ''Player's Handbook'', such as [[adroit explorer]]s for [[human]]s.
# '''Classes''': Core [[Portal:Classes|classes]] from the [[arcane magic|arcane]], [[divine magic|divine]], and primal power sources are presented here: [[avenger]]s, [[barbarian]]s, [[bard]]s, [[druid]]s, [[Divine soul|invokers]], [[shaman]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[Warden (class)|wardens]]. New paragon paths and epic destinies are also presented, such as the [[blood moon stalker]], the [[wild mage]], or the [[lorekeeper]].
# '''Character Options''': This chapter includes new backgrounds based on societal status, circumstances of birth, or race for players to use, along with new feats, equipment, and [[ritual]]s. An appendix at the end of the chapter also includes a brief explanation of how to read power cards as well as a revision of the stealth rules for the ''Dungeons & Dragons''.
