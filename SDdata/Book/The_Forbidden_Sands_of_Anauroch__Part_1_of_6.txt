The Forbidden Sands of Anauroch is a series of comic books originally published by 21st Century Comics.
A strange creature of sand attacked and slaughtered the Bedine inhabitants of Maatar Oasis. As the creature reached the leader of the tribe, it changed into the shape of a red-headed woman - sorceress CeNedra who was on a quest to reach the great pyramid of Anauroch. The woman claimed what she was after. Meanwhile, a band of thieves Aileen, Gwidre, and Helmo escaped from Spellguard Ruins of Lupskara with the help of a young Bedine bard Faradn. In the process, Barbarian Helmo sacrificed his life to help his friends escape. Escaping further into the desert, Faradn guided his thieving allies to Maatar Oasis - his home. The only thing the adventurers found was dead bodies and ruins. Soon, they were joined by dwarf Arokin Steelarm. Together, they set out to avenge the deaths of innocent Bedine and witnessed the great pyramid emerge from a deadly sandstorm, summoned by CeNedra.
