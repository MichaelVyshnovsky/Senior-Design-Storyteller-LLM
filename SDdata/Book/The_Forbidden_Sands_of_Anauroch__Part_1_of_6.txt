==Summary==
A strange creature of sand attacked and slaughtered the [[Bedine]] inhabitants of [[Ma'atar]] Oasis. As the creature reached the leader of the tribe, it changed into the shape of a red-headed woman - [[sorceress]] [[Ce'Nedra]] who was on a quest to reach the [[great pyramid]] of [[Anauroch]]. The woman claimed what she was after. Meanwhile, a band of thieves: Aileen, Gwidre, and [[Helmo]] escaped from [[Spellguard Ruins]] of [[Lupskara]] with the help of a young Bedine [[bard]] [[Farad'n]]. In the process, [[Barbarian]] Helmo sacrificed his life to help his friends escape. Escaping further into the desert, Farad'n guided his thieving allies to Ma'atar Oasis - his home. The only thing the adventurers found was dead bodies and ruins. Soon, they were joined by [[dwarf]] [[Arokin Steelarm]]. Together, they set out to avenge the deaths of innocent Bedine and witnessed the great pyramid emerge from a deadly sandstorm, summoned by Ce'Nedra.
