{{Quote|''If you thought all wizards were alike, think again! The masters of magic now have a new guide to creating more interesting and imaginative mages, just when you thought you had them "figured out." ''The Complete Wizard's Handbook'' will put a whole new twist on wizards from personality and dress codes to schools of magic to building that dream laboratory. Look out, world&mdash;you'll never look at a mage the same way again!''}}

==Description==
''The Complete Wizard's Handbook'' is the 4{{th}} book in the [[PHBR series|Player's Handbook Rules series]].

The book covers three aspects of wizards in detail: their school of magic (such as illusion or necromancy), their "wizard kit" (subclass, such as mystic, witch, or militant wizard), and their career (such as alchemist or treasure-hunter). The book also includes new spells, and rules for spell research, adjudicating illusions, and casting spells in unusual conditions.<ref>

The book explores the concept of familiars, which are magical animal companions that wizards can bond with. Familiars offer unique benefits and can serve as valuable allies.

The book discusses various wizardly organizations, magical academies, and magical societies where wizards can receive training, exchange knowledge, and seek employment.

''The Complete Wizard's Handbook'' provides campaign ideas and adventure hooks that involve wizard characters and the challenges they might face, such as quests for ancient spells, magical research, and encounters with rival spellcasters. It offers role-playing tips and suggestions for players who wish to portray wizard characters convincingly. It covers topics like intellectual pursuits, moral choices, and interactions with other characters. It includes profiles of notable wizard NPCs, both allies and adversaries, that can be used in campaigns as mentors, quest-givers, or antagonists.
