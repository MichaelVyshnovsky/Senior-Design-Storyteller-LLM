{{quote|'''''The Ultimate Fantasy Bestiary'''''

''This revised and expanded Monster Manual contains a horde of creatures for the fifth edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS gameâ€”a monstrous menagerie of familiar favorites like dragons, giants, and mind flayers, plus a host of new monsters like the arch-hag, the blob of annihilation, and the vampire warlock.''

''Populate your worlds and adventures with the hundreds of monsters provided and let their stories, illustrations, and easy-to-use stat blocks fuel your D&D adventures for years to come.''
