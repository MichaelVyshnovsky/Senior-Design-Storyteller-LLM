'''''The High History of Faerûnian Archmages Mighty''''' was a four-volume tome penned by [[Antarn]] the Sage in the {{YearlinkName|1366}}.

{{quote|''...His true powers he revealed to few–but it is recorded that when the [[Mythal]] was laid, and [[Cormanthor]] became [[Myth Drannor]], [[Elminster]] was one of those who devised and spun that mighty [[magic]]. So the long tale of the doings of Elminster "Farwalker" began.''|Excerpt from ''The High History of Faerûnian Archmages Mighty''}}

==Contents==
All four volumes of the book chronicled the history of several [[archmage]]s of [[Faerûn]]. One of them was dedicated to Elminster Aumar– the Sage of [[Shadowdale]] and his early years. The mage's recorded journey started from being an orphaned prince of [[Athalantar]] in the {{YearlinkName|212}} and his fateful journey to Myth Drannor on behalf of [[Mystra]] in the {{YearlinkName|241}}.

A copy of ''The High History of Faerûnian Archmages Mighty'' was kept in the library-citadel of [[Candlekeep]] on the [[Sword Coast]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}
