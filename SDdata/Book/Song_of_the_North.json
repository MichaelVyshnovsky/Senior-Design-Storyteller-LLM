It comprised multiple sonnets, including sonnet 5, which detailed the history of [[giant]]s and [[Hartsvale]].\n\n{{quote|In [[Hartsvale]] did the hero [[giant]] rise<br />\nAnd lead the smallfolk 'gainst his tyrannous kin.<br />\nThe [[Ice Spires|Ice Spire]] tempests filled with rallying cries,<br />\nAs smallfolks's time in Hartsvale did begin.<br />\nThe Ice Spire peaks did so the giants claim:<br />\nThe [[frost giant|frost clans]] by the [[Bleak Plain]] to the north;<br />\nThe southern range, home to the [[fire giant|giants of flame]];<br />\nThe [[hill giant]]s to the west (for what they're worth).<br />\nIn [[Castle Hartwick]], midst the [[Clear Whirl River|Clear Whirl]]'s run,<br />\nNow sits the Good King [[Grauman]] on his throne.<br />\nWith truce 'tween giantkind and smallfolk spun,<br />\nThe folk of Hartsvale now are on their own.<br />\nSo long as peace continues in the vale,<br />\nSo shall the folk of [[Stagwick]] e'er prevail.\n|Sonnet 5 of ''Song of the North''}}"
