{{Quote|''You have all the time in the world &ndash; and now you don't.''

''The final and most dangerous fantasy frontier lies not in space, but in time! At last, the dimension of Time is open to those few [[wizard]]s who would risk everything &ndash; even their very existence &ndash; to visit ancient and forgotten lands, or see the unbelievable wonders and horrors of the future. These few wizards are [[Chronomancer (class)|Chronomancers]], and this optional 96-page AD&amp;D game accessory reveals the secrets of their lives. New spells, new powers, and new realms &ndash; as well as terrifying monsters &ndash; are brought to light in this stunning work. Take time to study the mysteries of chronomancy &ndash; before someone else takes that time from you.''}}

==Description==
''Chronomancer'' introduces a new school of magic called [[chronomancy]]. Players can learn spells that affect time in various ways, including time reversal, time stoppage, and time travel. It presents players with magical items and artifacts that are tied to the theme of time, such as timepieces that can control time, temporal gates, and time-locked locations.

''Chronomancer'' includes several adventure hooks and ideas that revolve around time travel and the consequences of altering history. These adventures can be incorporated into existing campaigns or used as standalone scenarios. Players can encounter and interact with beings and creatures that are inherently tied to the concept of time, such as time elementals and time guardians.

''Chronomancer'' provides rules and guidelines for exploring alternate timelines and parallel dimensions. It also introduces new character classes, kits, and abilities related to time manipulation, allowing players to create characters who specialize in chronomancy. It provides guidelines for handling time paradoxes, causality loops, and the impact of time manipulation.
