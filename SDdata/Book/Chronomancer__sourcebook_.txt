Chronomancer is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.
Chronomancer introduces a new school of magic called chronomancy. Players can learn spells that affect time in various ways, including time reversal, time stoppage, and time travel. It presents players with magical items and artifacts that are tied to the theme of time, such as timepieces that can control time, temporal gates, and time-locked locations.
Chronomancer includes several adventure hooks and ideas that revolve around time travel and the consequences of altering history. These adventures can be incorporated into existing campaigns or used as standalone scenarios. Players can encounter and interact with beings and creatures that are inherently tied to the concept of time, such as time elementals and time guardians.
Chronomancer provides rules and guidelines for exploring alternate timelines and parallel dimensions. It also introduces new character classes, kits, and abilities related to time manipulation, allowing players to create characters who specialize in chronomancy. It provides guidelines for handling time paradoxes, causality loops, and the impact of time manipulation.
