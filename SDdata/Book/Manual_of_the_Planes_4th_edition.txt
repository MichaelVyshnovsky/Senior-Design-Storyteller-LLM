==Contents==

The ''Manual of the Planes'' is the authoritative guide to the new [[cosmology]] presented in the 4th edition of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' roleplaying game. Like previous versions of the book the 4th edition of the ''Manual of the Planes'' (MotP) is primarily a lore book, focusing on background information on each plane it covers rather than introducing new rules. At the end of the book, however, rule mechanics are presented for new [[:Category:Paragon paths|paragon paths]], [[:Category:Inhabitants by race|races]], and [[ritual]]s.

Information in the ''Manual of the Planes'' is considered [[canon]]ical to the 4th edition variant of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' insofar as it does not directly contradict other 4th edition ''Realms'' sources. For instance, the details of [[Arvandor]] are canon but the details on Shom, which does not exist in FR's version of the [[Astral Sea]], are not. Similarly, the [[Feywild]] and [[Shadowfell]] sections are ''mostly'' apocryphal, since each campaign setting's variant of the [[parallel plane]]s is a reflection of each setting's [[Prime Material Plane]] rather than having details wholly unique to itself.

The book is divided into seven chapters, as follow:

# '''Exploring the Planes''' — This early chapter introduces readers to the 4th edition cosmology and explains how rules referees or "dungeon masters" might use the cosmology in their campaigns. The chapter also details how planes are characterized and categorized, how one might traverse the planes, and provides information on [[Sigil]], the [[Far Realm]], and the [[Plane of Dreams]].
# '''[[Feywild|The Feywild]]''' — This chapter details the realm of the [[fey]], a bright and lively realm known as the Feywild. Details are provided as to what races are commonly found in the Feywild, including a definition of [[archfey]], what the structure of the [[Seelie]] Court is, and what kind of locations a [[planewalker]] can expect to find on the plane as well as how to reach the Feywild. This chapter was primarily written by [[John Rogers]]
# '''[[Shadowfell|The Shadowfell]]''' — Written primarily by Robert J. Schwalb, his chapter focuses on the dark and shadowy twin of the Prime, a plane known as the Shadowfell, brimming with necrotic energy. Details are provided as to what races make their home on the plane and what kind of locations a planewalker might find while traversing to the plane, as well as how to reach it in the first place.
# '''[[Elemental Chaos|The Elemental Chaos]]''' — The Elemental Chaos is described here by James Wyatt. How to reach the Chaos as well as what locations and [[elemental realm]]s a planewalker might visit are described here, as are the various races that make their home on the plane.
# '''[[Astral Sea|The Astral Sea]]''' — Written by Richard Baker, this chapter describes the Astral Sea and its inhabitants. The most prominent [[astral dominion]]s are listed, as are the types of races who commonly make their homes on the plane. The chapter also describes how one might travel the Astral Sea.
# '''[[:Category:Outsiders|Monsters of the Planes]]''' — An alphabetical listing similar to that in the ''[[Monster Manual 4th edition|Monster Manual]]'' is provided here, from [[air archon]]s to [[raavasta]]. Included alongside more "mundane" monsters are the [[demon lord]]s [[Baphomet]] and [[Graz'zt]] as well as the [[archdevil]] [[Dispater]]. Rudimentary rules for playing a [[bladeling]] are also provided.
# '''[[Planewalker|Planar Characters]]''' The final chapter provides information useful for players, including new paragon paths, such as the [[doomguard marauder]] or the [[Malec-Keth janissary]], as well as new rituals and items.
