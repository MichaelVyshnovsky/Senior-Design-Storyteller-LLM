It was decorated with golden yellow symbols and clasps. It had a yellow gem on its spine.\nUsing the item made a chosen person think deep, remorseful thoughts. This could be used to distract opponents and interrupt their attacks. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Ponderous Tomes could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such books were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Deathsleep, the green dragon."
