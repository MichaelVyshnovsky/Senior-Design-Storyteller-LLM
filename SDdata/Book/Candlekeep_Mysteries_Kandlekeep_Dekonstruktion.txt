"Kandlekeep Dekonstruktion" is a short adventure module for 9&ndashlevel players, collected in the anthology Candlekeep Mysteries, where players try to stop cultists from launching one of Candlekeeps towers into space.
In 1492 DR, a group of adventurers in Candlekeep witness an elderly acolyte dying from a heart attack as he is carrying around a tome containing plans for the Barn Door, a tower in the restricted areas of the fortress library. Further investigation reveals that a cult of disgruntled Candlekeep custodians, the Livestock, are planning to launch the tower into space using rockets. The adventurers must race against time to stop the custodian cultists from absconding with Candlekeeps treasured books.
