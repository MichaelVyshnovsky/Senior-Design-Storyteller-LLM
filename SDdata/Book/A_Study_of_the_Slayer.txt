'''''A Study of the Slayer''''' was a tome of arcane research on the topic of the [[Bhaalspawn]] and the [[Slayer of Bhaal]], penned by [[Jon Irenicus]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''It seems that it manifests in moments of pure hatred, a divine hatred those of mortal blood cannot fathom. When the child of Bhaal hates in a way that pleases their Lord, Bhaal himself descends upon them as his own avatar. Despite all the Bhaalspawn of Candlekeep has done to prevent Sarevok's uprising, it seems Father must love them dearly indeed to intervene personally on their behalf.''|Excerpt from ''A Study of the Slayer''}}

==Contents==
''Regarding the Slayer'' [[book]] logged the research, observations, and musings of [[archmage]] Jon Irenicus in his quest to capture [[Abdel Adrian]]'s piece of divinity. Irenicus claimed that even Bhaalspawn who did not follow their divine progenitor's bloody calling, like [[Gorion's Ward]] did, the evil taint was inescapable. The Slayer was locked inside each of the Bhaalspawn, awoken by strong feelings of divine rage and bloodlust, unachievable by simple mortals. This meeting of hatred pleased the deity. When a Bhaalspawn transformed into the Slayer, Bhaal's own avatar, their mind became shattered. Irenicus discovered that in his attempts to extract the essence from multiple Bhaalspawn. In his observation, the archmage also noted that Abdel Adrian, the Bhaalspawn of [[Candlekeep]], might have been the Lord of Murder's favorite seed, pointing Irenicus towards his goal â€“ capturing Gorion's Ward and extracting his divine essence.

==History==
''A Study of the Slayer'' was a unique book penned sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}} by Jon Irenicus's hand. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the book ended up in the hands of [[Volothamp Geddarm]], who, in turn, loaned it to the heroes known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]], when they faced with [[Orin the Red]], a shapeshifting Bhaalspawn. However, the writer cordially asked the heroes to keep ''A Study of the Slayer'' away from bloodbaths due to the book's being one of a kind.
