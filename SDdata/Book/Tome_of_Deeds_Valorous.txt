'''''Tomes of Deeds Valorous''''' were [[enchanted]] [[book]]s that collected stories of bravery and valor and imbued with beneficial magics.

==Content==
The tomes were collections of prose and lyrical tales about knightly deeds of heroism and gallantry, many of which had almost chilling endings that involved self-sacrifice. However, ''Tomes of Deeds Valorous'' were not simple story books but rather powerful and precious magic items. Every page in these books was imbued with magic. When the books were read out loud, the words became ensorcelled with magic that inspired all friendly creatures who heard them. This effect was similar to that of the ''[[remove fear]]'' [[spell]]. This magic could be activated thrice per day.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the library of the [[Black Raven Monastery]], in the mountains above the [[Ice Lakes]] and the [[Black Raven River]], owned a ''Tome of Deeds Valorous''.
