'''''Shadowbane''''' is the second in the [[Shadowbane series]] of standalone novels by [[Erik Scott de Bie]] that follow the adventures of [[Kalen Dren]]. It is also the last in the line of novels  associated with the worlds-spanning [[Abyssal Plague]] event. Finally, the ebook version of ''Shadowbane'' contains a bonus short story titled [[Shadowbane/A New Purpose|A New Purpose]].

==Summary==
The city of Luskan has always been a den of pirates, thieves, and murderers. But lately, it has gotten even worse. A ship crashes ashore with nothing but corpses. Everyday people go crazy and kill those around them. The only signs found of even the most hardened criminals who walk the streets at night are bones.

Luskan’s sister city, Waterdeep, sent a detachment to quarantine the unclean city—to let the filth die, rather than infect the rest of the Realms—but Myrin has slipped inside, declaring that she will save Luskan. Shadowbane follows, determined to save Myrin and therefore her pet city—even if he has to kill every rat in Luskan to do it.

Shadowbane features the triumphant return of popular, dark vigilante Shadowbane from Downshadow and carries forth the threads of the worlds-spanning Abyssal Plague series.

This expanded e-book also includes a brand-new short story, entitled "A New Purpose," as well as links to an existing prequel and an original e-novella, featuring characters from Shadowbane. Also included are links to background information on the Abyssal Plague series and sample chapters from other books in the series.
