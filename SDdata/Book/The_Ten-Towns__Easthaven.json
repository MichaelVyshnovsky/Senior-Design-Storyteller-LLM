        "mainbody": "'''''The Ten-Towns: Easthaven''''' was one of the [[book]]s in a series dedicated to the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]] history of the [[Ten-Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].",
        "Contents": "The book was not a comprehensive guide or historical record. Instead, it focused on the recent history, at the time, of the {{YearlinkName|1281}} – the events that gave Easthaven a certain notoriety and attracted many historians, [[:category:seers|seers]], and [[mage]]s to the town and [[Icewind Dale]], as well as information about locals and their day-to-day lives. As of the very early 14{{th}} century DR, Easthaven was already considered one of the Ten Towns, despite being just a tiny frontier community. Even after its very recent growth, it was little more than a half-moon of cottages and humble homes built on the [[Lac Dinneshere]].\n\nThe guide continued then talking about the town's main industry – the exportation of [[scrimshaw]]. Carved out of the bones of [[knucklehead trout]], items of art and practicality were highly sought after. To get scrimshaw, Easthaven maintained a fishing industry. The town itself had buildings constructed using timber; all were unrefined, rugged, and rough, similar to their dwellers, built to withstand northern cold. Easthaven's survival through fishing was fairly obvious as nets, boats, and fish racks were strewn all across the town.\n\nThe icy siege of [[1281 DR]] was disastrous to Easthaven, and the town had to be rebuilt. Its major landmark – the [[Temple of Tempus (Easthaven)|Temple of Tempus]] was repaired and reopened; however, all religious relics that once were stored in the temple's basement were moved south by the [[Church of Tempus]] in accordance with the mandate of the High Priests.\n\nThe guide offered advice to would-be-pilgrims fortune-seekers hoping to discover lost relics or arcane items – no treasures remained in Easthaven as everything that was there to find had long been claimed by mages and [[thieves]] in the decades since the tragedy. The book also offered advice to historians and sages who sought to research the past – a visit to [[Kuldahar]] was in order.\n\nStrangely enough, by the early 14{{th}} century DR, there were no encounters with [[aquatic elves]] who were said to inhabit the frigid waters of Lac Dinneshere. It is the author's opinion that the existence of these elves was merely one of the local myths intended to draw traders and settlers to the region."
