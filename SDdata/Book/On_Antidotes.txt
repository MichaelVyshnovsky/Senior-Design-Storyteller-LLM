On Antidotes was a book about the art of alchemy and the Part II of the Basics of Alchemy series penned by Haskinn Xhesilaphin, a dragonborn alchemist sometime before the late 15 century DR.
This tome was dedicated to many of the most known antidotes. It also recorded Haskinn Xhesilaphins musings and stories, namely the event that encouraged the dragonborn to punish this tome. The incident took place in the Elfsong Tavern of Baldurs Gate, where Haskinn was enjoying a mug of hot cocoa that soothes their painfully descaled hands. Suddenly, a human child came in and collapsed, apparently suffering from a bad case of poisoning. No other parts of Elfsong Tavern were willing to pay for a vial of antidote that could save the childs life. However, Haskinn knew that they would likely find all needed ingredients for an antidote in the taverns kitchen – salts of mugwort﻿ and suspension of bullywug trumpets. The dragonborn thought it to be criminal that none present knew of this simple recipe. The salts were to be slowly sprinkled in the suspension while being stirred clockwise until the mixture thickened and turned green.
Lastly, Haskinn Xhesilaphin, as always, talked about the the Rule of Three – in their opinion, all ingredients need to be refined to be used in alchemy, and in order to do that, one needed three portions of the same ingredient. They also provided the reader is a "rhyme" that supposedly helped them remember the Rule of Three.
