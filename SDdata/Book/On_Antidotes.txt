'''''On Antidotes''''' was a [[book]] about the art of [[alchemy]] and the Part II of the ''Basics of Alchemy'' series penned by [[Haskinn Xhesilaphin]], a [[dragonborn]] alchemist sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Meanwhile, the ingredients were just lying around, in the kitchen. Every single one of those people could have saved that child, but only I knew how. It felt like a crime.''|Excerpt from ''On Antidotes.''}}

==Content==
This tome was dedicated to many of the most known ''[[antidote]]s''. It also recorded Haskinn Xhesilaphin's musings and stories, namely the event that encouraged the dragonborn to punish this tome. The incident took place in the [[Elfsong Tavern]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], where Haskinn was enjoying a mug of [[hot cocoa]] that soothes their painfully descaled hands. Suddenly, a [[human]] child came in and collapsed, apparently suffering from a bad case of [[poison]]ing. No other parts of Elfsong Tavern were willing to pay for a vial of ''antidote'' that could save the child's life. However, Haskinn knew that they would likely find all needed ingredients for an ''antidote'' in the tavern's kitchen – [[salt]]s of [[mugwort]]﻿ and suspension of [[bullywug trumpet]]s. The dragonborn thought it to be criminal that none present knew of this simple recipe. The salts were to be slowly sprinkled in the suspension while being stirred clockwise until the mixture thickened and turned green.

Lastly, Haskinn Xhesilaphin, as always, talked about the [[the Rule of Three]] – in their opinion, all ingredients need to be refined to be used in alchemy, and in order to do that, one needed three portions of the same ingredient. They also provided the reader is a "rhyme" that supposedly helped them remember the Rule of Three.
