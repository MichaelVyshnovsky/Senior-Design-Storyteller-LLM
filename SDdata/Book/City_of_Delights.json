        "mainbody": "'''''City of Delights''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' boxed set. It is part of the [[Al-Qadim]] campaign setting and set in [[Zakhara]].\n{{Quote|''Recommended for use with the'' [[Arabian Adventures]] ''rulebook.''<br/>\n''Golden [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, is the \"heart of the heart\" of the enlightened lands. It is the religious and political center of [[Zakhara]] and, say its inhabitants, the most beautiful city in the entire world. But beneath the beauty lies mystery, for the court of the [[Grand Caliph]] is as full of intrigue as the Grand Bazaar is full of adventures waiting to happen. Come, explore the delights and dangers of Huzuz the Golden, heart of the [[Al-Qadim|AL-QADIM campaign world]].\n''}}",
        "Description": "This boxed set describes [[Zakhara]]'s principal jewel, the Golden City of [[Huzuz]] – huge, filled with every imaginable item and service, and saturated with intrigue and mystery. Each of the 800,000 citizens has a story, such as: how the merchant [[Khwaja al-Danaf]] gained his fortune; how the [[Talking Bird]] and [[Singing Tree]] came to the garden in the Palace of the Enlightened Throne; and how the Caliph's elven concubine [[Halima]] gained a [[winged cat]].{{Cite dragon/219/Role-playing Reviews: A Thousand and One Adventures|50}}\n\nThe book provides hints on what player characters may want to do in Huzuz: An ethoist priest wants to preach in the great [[Golden Mosque]], so the Mosque entry tells whom to talk to. A [[sha'ir]] wants to study with [[Adnan al-Raqi]], Master of the Invisible, the Whisper that Thunders, so the book tells how to find his tower and how to become his apprentice. For the rogue, details are provided on sneaking into the Caliph's harem.",
