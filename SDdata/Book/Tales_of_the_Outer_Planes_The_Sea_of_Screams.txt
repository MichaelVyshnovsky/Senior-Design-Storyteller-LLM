"The Sea of Screams" is an adventure module for beginner players set in the Abyss, where the players must accompany Gustofsen Eller, a cleric, in his mission to verify whether he has succeeded in slaying the goddess Kali.
The adventurers must protect the cleric Gustofsen Eller, who believes he has slain Kali, in a trip to her layer of the Abyss. Only by looking for her dead body can he be completely certain that he has succeeded in killing her.
