{{quote|'''BRAVE THE RUINS'''

'''UNDERMOUNTAIN''' awaits you: the fabled and feared battleground of the Realms&mdash;"The Deepest Dungeon of them all."

'''DARE YOU FACE ...''' miles upon miles of deadly traps, glittering treasures, strange and cryptic rooms, and slithering, skulking, lurking monsters? They await you underneath Waterdeep!

'''UNDERMOUNTAIN''' is a dungeon setting for AD&D<sup>&reg;</sup> 2nd Edition campaign play: the oldest, largest, and deadliest dungeon-crawl in the FORGOTTEN REALMS&trade; Campaign Setting. It is the place where intrepid adventurers endeavor to become veterans, to win a place among the rich and famous&mdash;if they survive its depths. Enter an endless maze where waiting death bears a thousand faces and treasures lie hidden in a thousand places.

It's just the setting for long-running, memorable, great AD&D game play, the perfect locale you'll never forget. So please, come in. Mind your step among the skulls. Oh, yes&mdash;good luck&mdash;you'll be needing it.

'''The RUINS OF UNDERMOUNTAIN Campaign Set includes:'''
* A 128-page book describing Undermountain, its history, its horrors, and details of the first three levels of the dungeon;
* A 32-page adventure book for use exclusively with Undermountain and Waterdeep;
* Four full-color maps of the vast and dangerous dungeon;
* Eight ''Monstrous Compendium'' pages of new monsters; and
* Eight durable cards loaded with traps, treasures, and trinkets to fill your dungeons.}}

==Description==
''The Ruins of Undermountain'' describes [[Undermountain]], the infamous ''über''-dungeon of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. It is the first in what became a series of supplements about Undermountain.

The set comprises several components designed to enrich the dungeon-delving experience in Undermountain. Included are a 128-page booklet titled ''Campaign Guide to Undermountain'', a 32-page booklet titled ''Undermountain Adventures'', eight double-sided loose-leaf pages featuring monster statistics, eight double-sided heavy-stock cards serving as "adventure aids," and four color fold-out poster maps.

The ''Campaign Guide to Undermountain'' provides exhaustive details about the dungeon's history, its notorious non-player characters such as [[Halaster Blackcloak]], and the [[spell]]s and magic items to be discovered therein. It also offers comprehensive mapping keys to various locations within Undermountain and guidelines for expanding the dungeon and crafting future adventures.

The ''Undermountain Adventures'' booklet outlines seven distinct adventures tailored for the Undermountain setting but adaptable to other dungeons. Additionally, it includes a ''Monster Guide'' with stat blocks and descriptions of monsters unique to this set and details about the subterranean city of [[Skullport]]. The booklet's cover features art by [[Jeff Easley]], with interior cartography by [[David Sutherland]].

The monster sheets in the set detail eleven creatures in the Monstrous Compendium style.

The adventure aid cards are designed to assist the Dungeon Master by providing detailed information on traps, encounters, treasure, and other elements that can be integrated into ongoing adventures.

The included maps meticulously detail the first three levels of the Undermountain ruins, with the third level being so extensive that it occupies two of the poster maps.
