The Ruins of Undermountain is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set for the Forgotten Realms.
The Ruins of Undermountain describes Undermountain, the infamous über-dungeon of the Forgotten Realms. It is the first in what became a series of supplements about Undermountain.
The set comprises several components designed to enrich the dungeon-delving experience in Undermountain. Included are a 128-page booklet titled Campaign Guide to Undermountain, a 32-page booklet titled Undermountain Adventures, eight double-sided loose-leaf pages featuring monster statistics, eight double-sided heavy-stock cards serving as "adventure aids," and four color fold-out poster maps.
The Campaign Guide to Undermountain provides exhaustive details about the dungeons history, its notorious non-player characters such as Halaster Blackcloak, and the spells and magic items to be discovered therein. It also offers comprehensive mapping keys to various locations within Undermountain and guidelines for expanding the dungeon and crafting future adventures.
The Undermountain Adventures booklet outlines seven distinct adventures tailored for the Undermountain setting but adaptable to other dungeons. Additionally, it includes a Monster Guide with stat blocks and descriptions of monsters unique to this set and details about the subterranean city of Skullport. The booklets cover features art by Jeff Easley, with interior cartography by David Sutherland.
The monster sheets in the set detail eleven creatures in the Monstrous Compendium style.
The adventure aid cards are designed to assist the Dungeon Master by providing detailed information on traps, encounters, treasure, and other elements that can be integrated into ongoing adventures.
The included maps meticulously detail the first three levels of the Undermountain ruins, with the third level being so extensive that it occupies two of the poster maps.
