{{quote|''And though to many a [[sword]] seems a sharper, simpler, and more decisive an argument, there is, if one consults historical record with an open mind, free of passion and preconception, an argument to be made for solid progress through diplomacy. This has happened too often for it to be a miracle or mere chance or mistake, yet—men being who they are—does not happen enough.''|Garandal the Chancellor, Chapter 7 of ''The Rise of Randral: A Chapbook Adventure''.}}
