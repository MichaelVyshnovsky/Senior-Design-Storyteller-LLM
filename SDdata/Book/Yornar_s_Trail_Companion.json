        "mainbody": "ornars Trail Companion, or simply the Companion, was a holy spellbook of the Church of Mielikki that had been granted to the legendary ranger Yornar the Tracker by the Lady of the Forest herself, then passed from ranger to priest and priest to ranger down through the centuries in a winding path around the Realms. It was thought Mielikki sent the book out to inspire and encourage her faithful and to strengthen the magic of her priests.\nThe book had an unusual crescent shape, resembling the lunar phase. For a spine, it had a single, sturdy scrollwork hinge that curved along the middle part of the crescents outer curve. It had ironwood covers bound in leather, which had been replaced multiple times, with one bearer, Rhighaermon, replacing it no less than four times, and the crescents horns were sometimes seen with protective metal caps and sometimes without. The whole book appeared well-used and worn by time and the elements. It was roughly  tall, as measured straight from horn to horn.\nWithin the covers, the book had many pages apparently made from the mineral mica. These sheets were cut to the thickness of a hair and polished smooth. There were 93 pages.\nEach page of Yornars Trail Companion displayed a single divine spell.\naccelerate healing • age creature • age plant • animal friendship • animal growth • animate rock • anti-vermin barrier • anti-animal shell • anti-plant shell • banish blight • barkskin • breath of life • call woodland beings • circle of privacy • clear path • conjure animals • control temperature, 10 radius • control winds • create campsite • create food & water • create treant • create water • cure blindness or deafness • cure disease • detect snares and pits • dispel magic • efficacious monster ward • endure heat/endure cold • entangle • faerie fire • find drinkable water • find the path • fire purge • free action • giant insect • ground trace • hallucinatory forest • heroes feast • hold animal • hold plant • invisibility purge • invisibility to animals • invisibility to undead • know age • know alignment • know direction • know time • land of stability • liveoak • locate animals or plants • locate object • log of everburning • lower water • monster mount • nap • neutralize poison • part water • pass plant • pass without trace • plant door • plant growth • protection from fire • purify food & drink • reflecting pool • reincarnate • repel insects • resist fire/resist cold • slow poison • snake charm • snare • speak with monsters • speak with plants • spike growth • stalk • tongues • transmute rock to mud • transport via plants • tree healing • tree steed • tree • turn wood • unceasing vigilance of the holy sentinel • undead ward • unicorn steed • wall of thorns • warp wood • water breathing • water walk • weather stasis • weather summoning • wolf spirits • wood sword • zone of sweet air\nIn addition, the book itself possessed a number of magical powers and properties. The mica pages were utterly unbreakable, apparently due to a magical treatment. Moreover, the covers bore numerous item enchantments, rendering them invulnerable to fire, physical damage, and all known spells, even dispel magic and disintegrate.\nThe Companion could also glow faintly, similar to a faerie fire spell, when touched and willed to do so. Its light could be quietly dimmed in the same way. The light was a pale fire, similar to moonlight. Thus, the book could be used as a handy source of light, and was frequently used in just this way by the countless rangers who carried it through the woodlands at night.\nIn addition, it had the odd property that, when the book contacted any substance that was poisonous or corrosive to humans, elves, and half-elves, it became oddly prickly to the touch of bare skin. This had the practical benefit of allowing the bearer to detect poisons by dipping the book in a liquid or touching it to food, or waving it through the air when toxic gases were feared.\nClerics who possessed the Companion received the understanding that a Mielikkian priest might be permitted to use the Companion a second time after giving it away, but only if the need was great.\nAccording to Mielikkian legend, one dark night some time in the 10 century DR, Yornar the Tracker was lost in the forest and harried by bugbears when he glanced up at the crescent moon and muttered \"Oh, that the moon itself would come down and light the way for my sword.\" And to his surprise, it did, with a small glowing crescent descending from the heavens and illuminating the forest. As the bugbears cowered, Yornar could see clearly enough to overcome them. Afterward, he gazed up at the crescent and prayed to Mielikki to give thanks, when it floated down into his hand and was revealed to be a book of spells.\nAs he could not understand, let alone cast, the spells himself, Yornar prayed ardently to Mielikki for guidance on what to do with it. One night, he was awoken by low, rich voice in his ear and even felt a kiss on his cheek, with a touch of fire yet as cool as spring water. However, when Yornar sat up and look into the forest, he found he was alone. The Lady of the Forest had been with him. Church lore held that Yornar was the first to carry the book, and so it was named for him thereafter—Yornars Trail Companion.\nEventually, in the , Yornar the Tracker dutifully gave the book to a Mielikkian priestess named Emthreena Gulkryn. She was combating the creeping evil of Hellgate Keep in the eastern High Forest. Emthreena made good use of it for much of a season until Mielikki sent her dream visions telling her it was time to pass it on, and to give it to a passing ranger who seemed worthy.\nEmthreena duly did as she was bid, giving the Companion to a travelling ranger who carried it across Faerûn and gave it up to a Mielikkian priest. This established the Rightful Cycle of the Companion changing hands from priest to ranger, ranger to priest, where the ranger would transport it and the priest would use it. This cycle continued through the centuries without disruption, with the Companion changing hands hundreds of times and moving erratically all around the Realms, with the Mielikkian priests studying it in peace. According to researcher Sambranna Highstar, there was \"little of interest to recount of its endless journeys, nor in the studies of the quietly diligent Mielikkian holy folk.\"\nOne remarkable ranger was Rhighaermon OAntlers, a Waterdhavian noble who gave up his wealth, his family, and his surname in order that he might wander the untouched wildernesses of Faerûn. He came to view the book as being like an old friend, as a travelling companion who was quiet but nevertheless attentive, and even spoke to it occasionally. In the , a thief stole the Companion from Rhighaermon and sold it to Lord Lathamp of Elupar in the Vilhon Reach. In response, Rhighaermon assembled some half-dozen other followers of Mielikki and mounted a daring raid to steal it back from Lathamps palace. The rangers dueled the Eluphan guards along the battlements and in the galleries as they successfully reclaimed the tome from the palace vault. \nLater, in the , Rhighaermon married Dathae, and they hung the glowing Companion over their bridal bed. Afterward, while on their honeymoon, Rhighaermon finally delivered the Companion to the priest Klavaeron of Cedarsproke in the Gulthmere Forest.\nThe Rightful Cycle was finally broken in the , when the Mielikkian temple of Highluthholt in the High Forest was attacked by a flight of seven wyverns that carried off a number of treasures, including the Companion. The culprit was suspected to be a villainous wizard who used magically controlled wyverns in a number of robberies and raids around the time. The name and fate of this wizard were unknown, and the Companion remained lost for years.\nIt didnt resurface until the . An adventuring company known as the Talons of Timindar were exploring the monster-haunted ruins of Ilimar when they unexpectedly found the Companion hovering in the air in the middle of a tower-top room. Curiously, the whole room was scorched by flame, with broken windows and broken bodies all around, as if blasted by an explosion, possibly a fireball spell. The Talons went to Khôltar in the Shaar, where they sold the Companion for 90,000 gp and a pair of slippers of spider climbing to a strange dwarf who didnt give them his name.\nThis nameless dwarf, who was never seen without two ravens perched on each shoulder whom he apparently communicated with and even obeyed, was likely a minion, willingly or unwilling, of the renegade Halruaan sorceresses Halatha and Murbreistra Starnar of Phelzol. They bred monsters and mongrelmen and attracted many enemies and thieves from Halruaa who would raid their walled estate.\nBut it was a local thief, Andaren Robyth, who used one of these raids and spell-battles in the , as a cover while he scaled the wall and stole a number of magical items from the sisters, including the Companion. But he did not escape unscathed a partly polymorphed reptilian left arm made him an outcast and forced him to work as a killer-for-hire. Two years later, the mage Hoth of the Six Curses arrived at his cave outside Phannaskul with the intent to kill him, but Andaren purchased his life with the Companion.\nHoth took the Companion hoping it held something that would rid him of at least one of his curses, but nothing in the divine spellbook could help him. Disgusted, he sold it to a merchant in a bazaar in Murghyr in Murghôm. Later that day, that merchant double-crossed another merchant, who was in fact a doppelganger and member of a druuth serving a mind flayer, and died for his treachery.\nThe mind flayer tried to exchange the tome for a more useful magical item. But, by sheer chance, the man it tried to trade with was none other than the now elderly Rhighaermon OAntlers. With every trick and tactic he knew and every magical item in his possession, Rhighaermon killed the mind flayer and stole back the Companion, and carried it to the closest temple of Mielikki. However, he was hunted all the way by the mind flayers druuth.\nMortally wounded and with the doppelgangers close behind, Rhighaermon arrived at last at the Mielikkian temple in Maerlar in Mulhorand. He fell into the priests arms, holding the Companion out to them though he could not tell them what it was. The priests charged out to heal him and protect him from the doppelgangers, when a mystery lady in green emerged from the trees and caused vines to ensnare, choke, and tear apart the doppelgangers with no more than her finger. She picked up the faithful Rhighaermon OAntlers with a smile and disappeared, as the stunned priests fell to their knees and wept and praised Mielikki, the Supreme Ranger. A message carved on their altar would be found the next morning, as if it had always been there, encouraging the Mielikkians to continue the Rightful Cycle. Later, his widow Dathae completed the Companions journey, carrying it from Maerlar to the next Mielikkian priest in the Rightful Cycle, which would continue more-or-less intact for some time.\nHowever, the Companion disappeared again, breaking the cycle a second time, when its bearer, treespeaker Elanalue Sharrith of the Border Forest was captured by drow and taken into slavery in the . Its unknown whether Elanalue managed to stash the book before they did, or she lost it in the chase and the fight, or the drow seized it as well. \nAs of 1368 DR, at least six adventuring companies had gone in search of Elanalue Sharrith, the last being the Dwarves of Destiny in Eleint, the . But none had succeeded, or even returned. With the Companion lost, the church of Mielikki could do naught but keep \"an eye out for it\" and try to reclaim it they ever learned of it.\n* Yornar the Tracker, ranger and namesake\n* Emthreena Gulkryn, priest\n* Rhighaermon OAntlers, ranger\n* Elanalue Sharrith, treespeaker and last known bearer"
