"Mazfroths Mighty Digressions" is a short adventure module for 2&ndashlevel players, collected in the anthology Candlekeep Mysteries, where players investigate why several tomes in Candlekeep are actually gingwatzims in disguise.
In 1492 DR, a group of adventurers is attacked by a volume of Mazfroths Mighty Digressions, a tome on the subject of divinity, the multiverse, and the nature of magic. Further research reveals the tome was actually a disguised gingwatzim, a creature from the Ethereal Plane that feeds on spirit energy and that can assume the form of a small object. After interviewing the scholar who donated the tome to Candlekeep, the adventurers are compelled to investigate a book shop in Baldurs Gate.
