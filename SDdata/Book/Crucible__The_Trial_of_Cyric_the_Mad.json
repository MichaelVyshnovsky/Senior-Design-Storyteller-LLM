        "mainbody": "Crucible The Trial of Cyric the Mad, by Troy Denning, is the fifth and last book of the Avatar series.\nMalik el Sami, a follower of Cyric, finds the Cyrinishad after watching Candlekeep for years. Cyric raises an army to recover it, but the army destroys itself with infighting before it can attack, depriving Ao of a battle and offending the followers of Shar and Talos who were willing to join. \nMask convinces Tempus to gather the Circle of Greater Powers, who agree to destroy Cyric. Despite realizing that Cyric has become more powerful than they knew, Tyr charges him with Innocence. \nCyric sends Malik to recover the Cyrinishad, intending to present it as evidence so the other gods will be forced to listen to it, but he instead recovers Rinda’s journal, somehow singlehandedly breaking into Candlekeep, finding Rinda and Gwydions chamber in the most secure part of the library, and killing her and Gwydion in the process because they inexplicably left the window open. \nCyric convinces Tempus to expand his charges to Kelemvor and Mystra, as they are too benevolent, but they convince Tyr to separate the charges so they are not tried together. Cyric exposes Adon to Cyrics own mind, driving him insane. Kelemvor realizes that he has not been as impartial as befits a god. \nMystra begins attacking Cyric and realizes that Mask has been scheming against them, such as getting Kelemvor to reclaim the soul of Avner despite the fact that he was False to Mask, so Mystra lays a trap for him with a magic sword that could protect him from Kezef. However, when she attacks Mask, Tyr and Helm intervene and imprison her. Mask retrieves the sword. \nMeanwhile, Malik is protected by Tyr, and uses his invincibility to try and recover the The True Life of Cyric, as reading Rinda’s journal made him realize Cyric’s madness and the way to cure it. Malik’s wife cheats on him and Cyric kills her. Kelemvor tries to return Avner to Mask, but Mask gives him the task to free Mystra from Helm, which he inexplicably is able to do. Malik steals the True Life of Cyric. All gods are found innocent and Malik cures Cyric’s madness, while Mask keeps the sword that protects him from Kezef.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • Ruha •  •  •  •  • Sune •  •  •   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  () •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  (, ) •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  () •  •  •  •  •  () •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \n • \n • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nBuildings\n •  •  •  •  •  \nLandmarks\n •  •  •  •  •  •  \nPlanes of Existence\n •  ()•  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  \nRegions\n •  •  •  • \nSettlements\n •  •  •  •  ( • )\nWilderness\n •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  • \nMiscellaneous\n •  \nSpells\n •  •  •  \n •  •  (, ) •   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •"
