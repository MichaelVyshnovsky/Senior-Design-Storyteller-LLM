Secrets of the Sages was the first—and only—issue of the Forgotten Realms newsletter.  It was promised to buyers of the original edition of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, if they joined the Order of Heroes via the enclosed customer response card.
It was dated Summer 1988 and contained
* “A Short (for him) Greeting From Elminster” by Ed Greenwood
* “Lands of the Forgotten Realms”
** “Aglarond” with a hand-drawn map, and a drawing of The Simbul with her sigil
** “Evermeet”
** “Halruaa” with a map drawn by Greenwood in 1986
* A map of The North from the then unreleased FR5, The Savage Frontier
This was the only issue of the newsletter actually published.
