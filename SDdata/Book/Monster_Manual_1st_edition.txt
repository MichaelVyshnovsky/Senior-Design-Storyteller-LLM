The Monster Manual is a core sourcebook for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.
Monster Manual was the first hardcover book for any D&D game and the first of the core manuals published for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The Monster Manual was a supplement to the game, intended to describe the standard monsters used in AD&D. The book was a compendium of more than 350 monsters. Some monsters were new—others were compiled and revised from older sources such as Monsters and Treasure, Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Eldritch Wizardry, The Strategic Review and Dragon magazine. Each monster was listed alphabetically with a comprehensive description and full statistics and was, in many cases, supported by an illustration. It included topless portrayals of some of its female monsters, such as the succubus, Type V demons, lamia, and sylph. It was also the first appearance of the mimic. 
The cover of the original printing was illustrated by David C. Sutherland III. A softcover version of the Monster Manual was printed in the United Kingdom by Games Workshop in 1978. When the book was reprinted in 1985 it featured new cover art by Jeff Easley. The book remained relatively unchanged throughout its fifteen printings up to 1989. Minor changes during the print run included a cover art change to match a new logo and house style, and some minor corrections introduced in the 1978 printings.
