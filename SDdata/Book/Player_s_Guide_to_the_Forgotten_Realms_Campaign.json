        "mainbody": "The '''''Player’s Guide to the Forgotten Realms''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.\n{{Quote|There are many parallel worlds, and in times past, travel was easy between them. But those ways are now lost. Those worlds are forgotten.\n\nOr are they?\n\nWelcome to the Forgotten Realms.\n\nThis volume, brimming with newly rediscovered facts and original fiction, introduces you to the best-selling world of [[Faerûn]], where [[elf|elves]] are mysteriously disappearing, and magic is an art gifted by a goddess. No difficult game jargon obscures the wonders before you. Come and explore.\n\nOpen this book, and discover a forgotten world!}}",
        "Description": "The ''Player’s Guide to the Forgotten Realms'' follows the journal entries of an adventuring company called [[The Seekers]] as they travel across the Realms seeking the ''[[Tear of Selûne]]'' using the ''[[staff of the Shard]]''. In each chapter their quest takes them to a different part of the Realms. Sidebars in each chapter also give more background information on various locations, races, organizations, or other odds and ends. The book contains a few maps of cities and regions and one of the continent, but no hard statistics are given for anything.\n\nThe Seekers, comprising a [[gnome]] illusionist, a [[halfling]] [[thief]], and a [[human]] [[ranger]], embarks on an extensive exploration of the Realms, aiming to experience its myriad wonders as dictated by time and destiny. Their journey commences in [[Waterdeep]] and takes them through notable locations such as [[Neverwinter]], the [[High Moor]], and the [[Forgotten Forest]], marking the initial phase of their adventure. The narrative reaches a climactic pause in the dungeons of [[Zhentil Keep]], laying the groundwork for a continuation of their story, which the reader is invited to envision.\n\nAlongside the narrative, the guide incorporates concise sidebars that offer insights into various aspects of the Realms. These include discussions on druidic circles, the [[Harpers]], and the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], providing valuable context and background information.",
