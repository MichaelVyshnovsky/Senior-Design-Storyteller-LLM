        "mainbody": "he Player’s Guide to the Forgotten Realms is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.\nThe Player’s Guide to the Forgotten Realms follows the journal entries of an adventuring company called The Seekers as they travel across the Realms seeking the Tear of Selûne using the staff of the Shard. In each chapter their quest takes them to a different part of the Realms. Sidebars in each chapter also give more background information on various locations, races, organizations, or other odds and ends. The book contains a few maps of cities and regions and one of the continent, but no hard statistics are given for anything.\nThe Seekers, comprising a gnome illusionist, a halfling thief, and a human ranger, embarks on an extensive exploration of the Realms, aiming to experience its myriad wonders as dictated by time and destiny. Their journey commences in Waterdeep and takes them through notable locations such as Neverwinter, the High Moor, and the Forgotten Forest, marking the initial phase of their adventure. The narrative reaches a climactic pause in the dungeons of Zhentil Keep, laying the groundwork for a continuation of their story, which the reader is invited to envision.\nAlongside the narrative, the guide incorporates concise sidebars that offer insights into various aspects of the Realms. These include discussions on druidic circles, the Harpers, and the Red Wizards of Thay, providing valuable context and background information.\n* The Seekers Who They Are\n* Bublim Barboast\n* Esta Starchild\n* Furian Arcanus\n* Lorrick\n* Samkin Silvertooth\n* Trothgar\n* The Journey Begins\n* On To Neverwinter\n* Talk of Evermeet\n* Horrors of the High Moor\n* A Vision Upon the Hill\n* Lost Among the Bones\n* In the Forgotten Forest\n* Elves of the Greycloaks\n* A Tale of Prince Chelimber\n* The Pegasus Rider\n* Samkins Past Catches Up\n* Strangeness in Cloak Wood\n* The Lore of Candlekeep\n* Barstaags Revenge\n* The Night of Sharp Teeth\n* The Black Hood Bandits\n* News Spreads to Scornubel\n* The Star-Spore\n* Empty Purses in High Horn\n* A Mystery in Arabel\n* A Talk with Mother Lledew\n* Taking Ship from Suzail\n* Lorrick Takes a Quest\n* Farewells in Saerloon\n* Thunderholme\n* A Tale of Pirates\n* Crossars Tomb\n* A Night in Procampur\n* News of Impiltur\n* A Death in Damara\n* Clues From the Past\n* At the Shrine\n* The Last Hope\n(page numbers in parentheses)\nBuildings\n* Boareskyr Bridge (48)\n*Candlekeep (59)\n*Darkhold (79)\n* High Horn (83)\nCities & Towns\n* Arabel (86) Map (90), Key (91)\n*Baldurs Gate (53)\n*Beregost (61)\n*Easting (81)\n*Elturel (71)\n* Hluthvar (78)\n* Immersea (93) Map & Key (94)\n*Procampur (116)\n*Saerloon (104)\n*Scornubel (76) Map & Key (77)\n*Suzail (97) Map (98), Key (99)\n*Neverwinter (22)\n*Waterdeep (14)\n*Westgate (101 Map (103), Key (102)\n*Zhentil Keep (126)\nRegions\n*Aglarond (113)\n*Anauroch (45)\n*Battle of the Bones (31)\n*Cloak Wood (57)\n*Cormyr (84-85) Map (83)\n*The Dalelands (106) Map (107)\n*Damara (118)\n* Evermeet (23)\n*Evereska (44)\n* The Forgotten Forest (34)\n*Greycloak Hills (38)\n*The High Moor (26)\n* Hill of Lost Souls (28)\n* Impiltur (117)\n*The Lonely Moor (37)\n*Moonshae Islands (50-51)\n*Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea (110)\n*Sembia (105)\n*Thar (121)\n*The Underdark (120)\n*Vaasa (124)\n*The Wood of Sharp Teeth (67)\nRaces\n*Dwarves (9)\n*Elves (7) Dark, Gold, Moon, Sea, Wild\n* Gnomes (6)\n*Goblin Races (20)\n*Half-elves (8) Drow, Gold, Moon, Sea, Wild\n*Halflings (10)\n* Humans (11)\nOrganizations\n*Adventuring Companies (12-13) The Company of the Wolf, Halfling Inc., The Knights of Myth Drannor, Manes Band, The Nine, The Savage Seven, The Swords of Leilon, The Valiant Warriors\n*The Harpers (50)\n*Mercenary Companies (54-55) Blacktalons Mercenary Company, Bloodaxe Mercenary Company, The Flaming Fist, Mindulgulph Mercenary Company, The Order of the Blue Boar\n* Merchant Companies (18-19) Dragoneye Dealing Coster, Highmoon Trading Coster, The Seven Suns Trading Coster, The Six Coffers Market Priakos, Surefeet Trademasters, Thousandheads Trading Coster, The Trail Lords, Trueshield Trading Priakos\n*The Red Wizards of Thay (114)\n*The Zhentarim (66)\nMiscellaneous\n*Ales & Beers of the Realms (72-73)\n* Breads of the Realms\n* Cheeses of the Realms (87-88)\n*Dethek Runes (100)\n*Druidic Circles (35)\n* Mages’ Sigils (62-63)\n*Religion in the Realms (16)\n*The Retreat (24)\n* Wines of the Realms (41-42)\n* Bublim Barboast Gnome Illusionist\n*Esta Starchild Moon Elf Priestess of Selune\n*Furian Arcanus Moon Half-Elf Mage and writer of the journal\n*Lorrick Dwarf Warrior\n* Samkin Silvertooth Halfling Thief\n*Trothgar Human Ranger\nPlayers Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Original Realms Design Ed Greenwood\n* The Annals of the Seekers Design Anthony Herring\n* Additional Material Jeff Grubb, Karen Boomgarden, Julia Martin, Steven Schend, J.
