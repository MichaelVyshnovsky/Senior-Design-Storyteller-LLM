        "mainbody": "'''''Death & Divinity: A Godly Guide''''' was a book that collected knowledge on the divine and its relation to gods of death and death itself, available in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Death is too powerful a force for even a single god to contain...Even gods can die, after all. Those who worsihp death should remember that above all else.|''Excerpted lines from Death & Divinity.''}}",
        "Description": "''Death & Divinity: A Godly Guide'' was a large and heavy tome. Its spine was decorated with an [[ink]]ed pattern of a chain of skulls.",
        "Content": "The book opened with an abstract that described the domain and portfolio of death being too powerful even for a single deity to hold, explaining how the domain was separated into smaller portfolios such as [[disease]], war, funeral rites, and ceremonies. Furthermore, it discussed how the death portfolio itself had moved from one set of deities' hands to the next over the course of centuries.\n\nThe following part of the book continued talking about [[Jergal]] and his reign as the god of death over several centuries. The tome stated that Jergal was weary of lording over death and eventually gave up his portfolio to the young and ambitious gods [[Bhaal]], [[Bane]], and [[Myrkul]]. The trio of the new gods splintered the death portfolio. The heavy burden subsequently was passed to [[Kelemvor]].\n\nIn conclusion, the book stressed that death is absolute and even gods could die. This was issued as a grim reminder to the worshipers of the gods of death.",
        "History": "In [[1492 DR]], a copy of this book was in possession of a [[druid]] named [[Tahan]] who was part of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]."
