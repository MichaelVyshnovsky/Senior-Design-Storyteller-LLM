The Collected Wisdom of Snilloc was a compilation of the writings and observations of the mage Snilloc. It included accounts of the mages travels, a selection of his spells, and his personal notes and writings.
This large tome was  tall and  wide, with 120 pages of vellum.
When Snilloc traveled to the subcontinent of Zakhara, he left his book of Collected Wisdom behind as a sort of personal monument. For a time, it remained in a personal library in Faerûn, but was eventually stolen. Its location thereafter was unknown, but several copies have been found around Faerûn.
This book contained a fair amount of raw arcane knowledge, albeit presented with Snillocs patronizing tone. It included tales of his adventures and travels around Toril. Included was his advice on a number of subjects, from traps and their disarmament, to the creative uses of certain spells, to various ways to defeat monsters such as vampires, beholders, and even dinosaurs.
