'''''Genealogy of Giants and Giant-kin''''' was a [[giant]] lore [[book]] bound in red and penned sometime in or before the mid–13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Genealogy of Giants and Giant-kin'' combined information on races of giants and [[giant-kin]] and was a valuable tome. By the mid–14{{th}} century DR, undamaged copies of the book were valued at a hundred [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]]. A copy of the ''Genealogy'' was preserved within the once-wondrous [[Bard Keep]], a temple and library dedicated to [[Oghma]] that fell into ruin in the mid–13{{th}} century DR. The book was stored within the Reading Room and hid a page with the [[Dethek]] "G" rune, which was part of a set that was required to control the Keep's moving rooms. That copy of the book was also magically trapped, unleashing a [[red abishai]] once opened.
