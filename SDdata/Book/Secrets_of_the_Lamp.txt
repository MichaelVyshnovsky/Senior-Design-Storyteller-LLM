Secrets of the Lamp is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set. It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.
In Secrets of the Lamp, Zakharas multitudes of djinn, jann, dao, efreeti, and the rest are for player characters to command. Its centerpiece is a detailed description of the famous genie City of Brass. This city, which floats on an endless lake of burning oil, is featured in a poster map and on story cards and monster sheets.[1]
A lengthy scenario in the 32-page adventure booklet sends the PCs (levels 4–7) all over the City of Brass. An efreeti physician falls instantly in love with one of the heroes. The physician imprisons the party, and soon they run into trouble with his two current wives, his albino nightmare, patrolling salamanders, and the Sultan of the Efreet.
The 64-page Genie Lore book describes the Sevenfold Mazework of the Great Dismal Delve, the Court of Ice and Steel, the Great Padishah of the Marid, genie sorcerers, new magic, and the details of genie wishes.
