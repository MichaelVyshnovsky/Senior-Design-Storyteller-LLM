Ironhelm is the first book of the the Maztica trilogy by Douglas Niles.
Cordell, a mercenary, is found on the ruins of battlefield by Darien, a drow mage. He vows to found a company with a gold banner. An apprentice wizard named Halloran sees his master killed by an abomination he summoned. Across the sea in Maztica, a girl named Erixitl is marked for sacrifice by followers of Zaltec, but is kidnapped but Kultakans first. Ten years later, Cordell has formed his company, of which Halloran is a member. They wipe out a powerful pirate lord and convince Amn to fund an expedition to sail west in order to find a route to Kara-Tur. Meanwhile, Erixitl, a slave in Kultaka, is bought by the priests of Qotal, but hunted by the priests of Zaltec. The Golden Company arrives in Maztica and conquers Payit. Halloran witnesses the company killing innocents and leaves them. He joins Erixtil and encounters Poshtli, nephew of the Reverend Counselor of Nexal, who helps them battle an Ancient One hunting Erixitl. They kill the Ancient One only to discover that the Ancient Ones are drow, survivors of a subterranean conflict that raged in tunnels under the ocean, ending with a massive flame that cut off underground travel between continents and stranded the Ancient Ones and sun dwarves in Maztica. Cordell burns his ships and sets off for Nexal.
