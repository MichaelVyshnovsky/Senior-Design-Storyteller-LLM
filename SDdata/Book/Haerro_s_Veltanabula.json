        "Contents": "The book was a collection of Haerro's favorite combat [[spell]]s. The spells included many early forms of more modern spells, such as a movable form of ''[[cloud of daggers]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', ''[[forcecage]]'', various ''[[mindworm]]'' spells that retributed against [[illithid]] attacks, ray-based spells designed to melt tentacles, and spells that shot cones of ''[[Bead of force|beads of force]]''.",
        "History": "''Haerro's Veltanabula'' was considered a foundational classic by the arcanists of [[Netheril]] during the Age of Discovery ({{yearlinkConvert|2654|NY}} onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy of it, along with other works such as ''[[Sarturl's Study of Magical Fields]]'', ''[[Skouloond's Spell Studies]]'', ''[[Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments]]'', and ''[[Oloam's on Serpentine Matters]]''."
