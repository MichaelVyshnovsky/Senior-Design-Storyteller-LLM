'''''The Dancing Dwarf''''' was a quirky periodical [[chapbook]] published in the city of [[Secomber]] of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
The chapbook was a regularly published collection of whimsical rumors and witty satire. The City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]] was often the target of the ''Dwarf's'' biting satire that lampooned the city's pompous nobles and rulers. This made the chapbook gain popularity in Waterdeep in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], as no local publication was daring enough to ridicule guildmasters and other positions of power. In both Waterdeep and Secomber, ''The Dancing Dwarf'' was a common sight in the Dock Ward, taverns, and festhalls.
