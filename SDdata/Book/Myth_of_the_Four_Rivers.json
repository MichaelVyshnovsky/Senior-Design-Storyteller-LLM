        "mainbody": "The '''Myth of the Four Rivers''' was an ancient tale from [[Calimshan]] that told of an attempt to steal the [[sun]] by \"Four Who Should Never be Named\".",
        "History": "The Myth of the Four Rivers was an old tale hailing from Calimshan. The tale was written down in the {{YearlinkName|-284}}, when followers of [[Anachtyr]] slew the [[great wyrm]] [[Rivenaurlgoth|Rivenaurlgoth the Darkly Pious]] and carved the story in its teeth. As of [[1370 DR]], the head was stored in the [[Mountain of Skulls]], a temple devoted to [[Cyric]]. It was one of the most holy relics of the [[Church of Cyric]], because Rivenaurlgoth was the greatest and most powerful servant of [[Bane]] of the day.",
        "Content": "The Myth of the Four Rivers told the story of \"Four Who Should Never be Named\" and their attempt to steal the power of the sun. They wanted this power to defeat the Father Sky. They made a deal with the Sea to give them the ability to take the sun. After acquiring the power they went out to find the sun on top of a mountain, \"Where No God Dwelt\". In their attempts, they hurt Mother Earth. As a result, Father Sky brought a great flood over the region, washing away the beings. In the aftermath, it was stated that four new rivers flowed from the mountain and four new gods were created.",
        "Scholarship": "Scholars were not sure what the tale meant and there was much speculation. Some thought the tale explained the creation of rainbows and the difference between salt and fresh water. A different theory said that the story was written to remember the foolishness of the dark gods. It was argued that one of the dark gods was [[Bane]]. Other theories included the creation of the four rivers of Calimshan."
