        "mainbody": "Realms of Magic, edited by Brian Thomsen and J. Robert King, is the third anthology of stories from the Forgotten Realms.\nBy Brian Thomsen\nDate 1366 DRAlthough the \"Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction\" timeline places \"Prologue\" and \"Epilogue\" in 1366 DR, they expressly follow Once Around the Realms, which \"Presenting...\" places in 1367 DR. Moreover, Once Around the Realms has its own significant dating discrepancy. In addition, \"Prologue\" implies the in-universe Volos Guide to the Dalelands is forthcoming, but \"The Candlekeep Collection\" article says it was written over 1368–1369 DR. However, both characters may be considered unreliable given the story.\nBy R. A. Salvatore\nExplaining the creation of the unique figurine of wondrous power known as Guenhwyvar.\nMentions Anders Beltgarden, Josidiah Starym, Myth Drannor, House Starym\nDate 253 DR\nBy Jeff Grubb\nA young apprentice gets involved in a shady affair concerning smoke powder - a new substance, which is said to be capable of surmounting the power of arcane magic.\nMentions Waterdeep, Khelben Arunsun, Maskar Wands, smoke powder\nBy Mark Anthony\nBy Christie Golden\nThe vampire with a conscience, Jander Sunstar, is given a divine gift but in order to keep his peace of mind, he must risk losing it.\nBy Ed Greenwood\nBy Dave Gross\nBy Kate Novak as Kate Novak-Grubb\nDate 1369 DR\nBy Douglas Niles\nBy Allen C. Kupfer\nBy David Cook\nA magic user who has made her own path up the wizardly ranks decides to attain respect from other wizards by attaining her own familiar. A brownie called Shank has other plans.\nBy Jean Rabe\n\"Red Ambition\" was also published in The Best of the Realms anthology.\nSzass Tam, Zulkir of Necromancy, is betrayed by his apprentice, Frodyne. Frodyne is brilliant, ruthlessly ambitious, and enamored with the lich, who plans to grant her wish for immortality. However, when Tam flippantly takes information from her about a powerful artifact, she becomes furious and steals away to claim it for herself.\nThe Zulkir sends an army of undead to a hidden temple of Leira in ruined Delhumide to collect the artifact. That he will be defiling a gods temple does not bother him, as he long ago found most gods to be unworthy of respect. When he learns the army was completely destroyed, Tam goes himself to investigate. After subduing the temples guardian ghost, he forces it to lead him to the inner sanctum. There he finds Frodyne fighting the nearly invincible golem that guards the treasure. Instead of helping her, he grants her immortality—thereby giving the golem a never-ending distraction.\nThe Zulkir of Necromancy takes the artifact, a ruby-studded crown, and places it on his head. He immediately falls to the ground writhing in pain. The temple guardian laughs at him the crown bestows eternal life to its wearer, but Tam has no heart to beat or lungs to breathe. Leira, the Lady of Deception, has proven herself the greater power, as Tam has lost his army, his greatest apprentice, and a measure of his confidence to a simple ruse. Philosophical even in defeat, Szass Tam leaves the temple laughing at himself.\nBy Mary H. Herbert\nDate 1367 DR\nA story about Teza a horse thief that is given a job as a test for entry of a guild but realizes that the job would be morally wrong, even for a thief.
