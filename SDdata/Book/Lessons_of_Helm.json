        "mainbody": "Lessons of Helm was a religious book dedicated to the deity Helm, transcribed by the eccentric paladin who named himself Thou Shalt Not Suffer the Doom Herring to Live OReilly sometime before the late 15 century DR.\nLessons of Helm was a hand-penned tome of dogmas and doctrines of Helm the Vigilant, transcribed, interpreted, and written down by Thou Shalt Not Suffer the Doom Herring to Live OReilly. The paladins chosen name was inspired by his delusion that the infamous beholder leader of Xanathars Thieves Guild in reality was something called a \"doom herring.\" The paladins work claimed that Helms doctrines were not much different from those of other goodly gods, apart from Helms focus on protecting the needy, praising of the shield and steel use, and compassion for the weak and repressed.\nIn the , a copy, or possibly the original of Lessons of Helm was stored among the many religious books available to the guests of the Stormshore Tabernacle, a non-denominational shrine in Baldurs Gate."
