        "Content": "''Lessons of Helm'' was a hand-penned tome of dogmas and doctrines of Helm the Vigilant, transcribed, interpreted, and written down by Thou Shalt Not Suffer the Doom Herring to Live O'Reilly. The paladin's chosen name was inspired by his delusion that the infamous [[beholder]] leader of [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] in reality was something called a \"doom [[herring]].\" The paladin's work claimed that Helm's doctrines were not much different from those of other goodly gods, apart from Helm's focus on protecting the needy, praising of the [[shield]] and [[steel]] use, and compassion for the weak and repressed.<ref name=\"BG3\"/ />",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy, or possibly the original of ''Lessons of Helm'' was stored among the many religious books available to the guests of the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]], a non-denominational shrine in [[Baldur's Gate]]."
