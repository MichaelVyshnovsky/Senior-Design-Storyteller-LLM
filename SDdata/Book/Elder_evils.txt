Elder Evils is an accessory by Robert J. Schwalb for the 3.5-edition of the  ruleset and published in 2007. It adds new content for epic-level characters, in the form of extremely powerful, alien monstrosities intent on destroying the world and designed as a way of providing dungeon masters a means of ending a current campaign. It gives ideas for such campaigns and feats for villainous NPCs, and details nine elder evils, together with statistics, NPCs, storylines, and suggested adaptations to the Forgotten Realms setting. While the content is not considered canon, apart from Pandorym, it is included here for interest.
