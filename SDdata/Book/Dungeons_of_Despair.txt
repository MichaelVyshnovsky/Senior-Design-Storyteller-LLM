'''''Dungeons of Despair''''' is an adventure anthology for 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' featuring six short adventures reprinted from issues of ''[[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]]''. Only one adventure, "[[Masqueraider]]", is set in the [[Forgotten Realms]]. The anthology is a sequel of sorts to ''[[Road to Danger]]'', an earlier collection with the same premise.

{{Quote|'''''The quest for honor and the search for treasure sometimes lead to death and despair.'''''<br />
''Dungeons of Despair'' is a collection of low-level adventures for the Aᴅᴠᴀɴᴄᴇᴅ Dᴜɴɢᴇᴏɴs & Dʀᴀɢᴏɴs® game. Each adventure stands alone, but any of them can be inserted easily into an ongoing AD&D® campaign. They can also be played as follow-up adventures to those presented in ''Road to Danger'', the first anthology of adventures from the pages of ''Dᴜɴɢᴇᴏɴ''® ''Adventures''.}}
