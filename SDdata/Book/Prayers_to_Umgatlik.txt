'''''Prayers to Umgatlik''''' was a collection of religious sermons by and for worshipers of the ancient [[Netherese]] [[lich]] [[Umgatlik]].

{{quote|''All praise be to Umgatlik. May he hear our calls.<br/> To the day where Umgatlik is to be reborn into this world we wait.<br/>Until that day, while our enemies fester, we wait and grow in strength.<br/>Until that day when our enemies will fall
before us.<br/>Our hidden legions will rise and he will lead us into a new age.<br/>All praise be to Umgatlik.<br/>All glory be to the age of Umgatlik.''|Excerpt from ''Prayers to Umgatlik.''}}

==Contents==
The tome was dedicated to keeping the worship of Umgatlik alive and preparing his cult for the lich's return to [[Toril]]. The readers were encouraged to weather any and all strife because, in the end, they were to be rewarded by their "deity." The prayers recorded in the book talked about the lich rising once again, bringing blessings and greatness. These orisons talked about the cult staying in the shadows and growing in power as their enemies wilted and died.

==History==
It was unknown how much organized following Umgatlik retained by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but at least one follower was still in existence in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. A copy of ''Prayers to Umgatlik'' could be recovered from the "deity's" lost [[Umgatlik's shrine|shrine]], encrusted by the deadly cliffs of the [[Crab's Claw Coast]].
