        "mainbody": "ative Intelligence is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.\nNothing is known of this module as it seems to have never seen play. However, considering the plotlines of previous and future modules that were released, it is likely it has something to do with the book Legacy of the Green Regent and discovering that the current Green Regent, Otar, is rumoured to have been seen in Waterdeep."
