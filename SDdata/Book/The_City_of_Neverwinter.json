        "mainbody": "'''''The City of Neverwinter''''' was a guide book that described [[Neverwinter]], the Jewel of the North ''circa'' [[1372 DR]] and briefly recounted its history.",
        "Contents": "''The City of Neverwinter'', a the time of it being written, stated that the City of Skilled Hands was considered to be a beautiful and relaxed city. Protected by its walls, Neverwinter's population mostly considered of [[human]]s and [[half-elves]], totaling over 20,000 souls. The City of Skilled Hands nickname came from the abundant population of craftsfolk who competed in efficiency, design, and beauty mirrored by the city itself.\n\nThe book noted the city of Neverwinter also held a significant number of [[Harper]]s as well as [[dwarven]] crafters. Many goodly spellcasters, including those of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]]s, called Neverwinter home, who supported Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]]. The city also held a sizable militia of four hundred. All these groups made sure the Jewel of the North remained safe and secure.\n\nThe next section described the citizens of Neverwinter as educated, cultured, well-mannered, reserved, and hard-working. The city held deadlines and duties of high importance and respected personal property. The city also had its own saying about odd and reckless behaviors: \"Following one's weird.\" Because of that, Neverwinter bragged about being the most cosmopolitan and pristine city in [[Faer√ªn]]. The Jewel of the North considered itself to be above even the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], lacking Waterdhevian slums and fierce cutthroat competitiveness. And unlike [[Silverymoon]], Neverwinter had a more gentle climate and did not need to constantly defend itself from [[orc]]ish and [[wild elf]] raiders. Even merchants from [[Amn]] and [[Calimshan]] often claimed that Neverwinter was more civilized than their homes. This part of the book concluded on a quote from sage [[Mellomir]]: \"have achieved decadent without the need for passing through civilization first.\"\n\nFinally, the book described the main district of note within the city, the [[Neverwinter/City Core|City Core]], the [[Blacklake]], the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]], the [[Peninsula]], and the [[Beggar's Nest]]. The City Core was the center of Neverwinter's economy and the location of the [[Castle Never]], and the [[Hall of Justice]], the Temple of Tyr. The Blacklake was the home of the city's nobility, while the Beggar's Nest, the aptly named home of the less wealthy citizens. Peninsula was erected around the prison of Neverwinter, while the Docks were the biggest harbors of the Sword Coast.",
        "History": "Copies of ''the City of Neverwinter'' could be found in abundance around the areas of [[Neverwinter]] and the [[Sword Coast North]]  ''circa'' 1372 DR."
