        "mainbody": "The City of Neverwinter was a guide book that described Neverwinter, the Jewel of the North circa 1372 DR and briefly recounted its history.\nThe City of Neverwinter, a the time of it being written, stated that the City of Skilled Hands was considered to be a beautiful and relaxed city. Protected by its walls, Neverwinters population mostly considered of humans and half-elves, totaling over 20,000 souls. The City of Skilled Hands nickname came from the abundant population of craftsfolk who competed in efficiency, design, and beauty mirrored by the city itself.\nThe book noted the city of Neverwinter also held a significant number of Harpers as well as dwarven crafters. Many goodly spellcasters, including those of the Many-Starred Cloaks, called Neverwinter home, who supported Lord Nasher Alagondar. The city also held a sizable militia of four hundred. All these groups made sure the Jewel of the North remained safe and secure.\nThe next section described the citizens of Neverwinter as educated, cultured, well-mannered, reserved, and hard-working. The city held deadlines and duties of high importance and respected personal property. The city also had its own saying about odd and reckless behaviors \"Following ones weird.\" Because of that, Neverwinter bragged about being the most cosmopolitan and pristine city in Faer√ªn. The Jewel of the North considered itself to be above even the City of Splendors, Waterdeep, lacking Waterdhevian slums and fierce cutthroat competitiveness. And unlike Silverymoon, Neverwinter had a more gentle climate and did not need to constantly defend itself from orcish and wild elf raiders. Even merchants from Amn and Calimshan often claimed that Neverwinter was more civilized than their homes. This part of the book concluded on a quote from sage Mellomir \"have achieved decadent without the need for passing through civilization first.\"\nFinally, the book described the main district of note within the city, the City Core, the Blacklake, the Docks District, the Peninsula, and the Beggars Nest. The City Core was the center of Neverwinters economy and the location of the Castle Never, and the Hall of Justice, the Temple of Tyr. The Blacklake was the home of the citys nobility, while the Beggars Nest, the aptly named home of the less wealthy citizens. Peninsula was erected around the prison of Neverwinter, while the Docks were the biggest harbors of the Sword Coast.\nCopies of the City of Neverwinter could be found in abundance around the areas of Neverwinter and the Sword Coast North  circa 1372 DR."
