With the help of a mysterious stranger, the boy escapes his village and flees out to sea, stowing away on the pirate hunting ship, ''[[Sea Sprite]]'', where he comes across a most unlikely ally: the dark elf [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. With a [[half-fiend|half-demon]] determined to destroy him, and a crew of sailors resentful of the trouble he's caused, Maimun must find the courage to prove his worth, both to his friends and to himself.''\n\n''Nearly two decades ago, R.A.

For young readers seeking the next great fantasy saga or for long-time fans who can't miss any installment in the Drizzt saga, this book delivers all the action, intrigue, and magic you've come to expect from the Salvatore name.''}}",
        "Summary": {
            "Part 1": "The story begins with [[Maimun]] being questioned by a pirate. He tells the pirate his story, a story connected with the [[Stone of Tymora]]. \n\nSix years earlier ([[1356 DR]]{{Cite web/What Happened Before Daughter of the Drow?}}): Maimun is in [[Baldur's Gate]] fleeing the [[demon]] [[Asbeel]]. His mentor is dead and he is alone. As he looks over the city, he sees the docks and forms a plan. He stows away on a ship at dock named the ''[[Sea Sprite]]''. The ship departs and later Maimun is discovered on deck by the disguised [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who declines to reveal the stowaway's presence to the crew. However, a few days later the ship encounters pirates ([[Pinochet]]'s ship) and a [[scrag]] ([[Carrackus]]) finds Maimun and injures him, knocking him unconscious. When Maimun awakes, [[Catti-brie]] is tending to him. His wound is cauterized to prevent him from bleeding to death. He meets the captain of the ''Sea Sprite'', Captain [[Deudermont]], who offers him a place on his ship based on his courage.",
            "Part 2": "Maimun continues his story to the pirate, who wants to know about the \"artifact\" (Stone of Tymora) that Maimun didn't have on him when he was captured.\n\nEighteen years earlier ([[1350 DR]]): Maimun was orphaned shortly after his birth in an attack on his village. He was retrieved by a [[bard]] named [[Perrault]] and taken care of by a [[druid]] named [[Elbeth]] in the [[High Forest]] until he was about six years old. She doesn't know his name, so she calls him simply \"Lucky child.\" On Maimun's sixth \"birthday\" (or rather the anniversary of the day he was brought to Elbeth), the demon Asbeel appears at the cave where they live. That night, Elbeth takes Maimun to hide under a tree until the morning as she goes off to fight Asbeel and doesn't return. Maimun is found by Perrault, who becomes his guardian from then on. \n\nPerrault and Maimun wander the [[Sword Coast]] and more for six years with the magical [[horse]] [[Haze]], avoiding large cities. However, around Maimun's twelfth \"birthday,\"  Perrault gives him a stone (which he later learns in the Stone of Tymora) and brings him to [[Baldur's Gate]]. They sneak into the city and travel to the [[Empty Flagon]] inn, a hidden inn run by the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[wizard]] [[Alviss]]. Perrault leaves to run an errand and Alviss uses his magic to allow Maimun to spy on him talking to [[Jaide]], the priestess of [[Tymora]], about Maimun and the Stone of Tymora. Perrault returns and tells Maimun they must leave the city. \n\nHowever, while attempting to leave Baldur's Gate, Perrault and Maimun run into Asbeel. Perrault is badly wounded but they are rescued by Haze, who takes them far out into the ocean to a ship captained by a man named [[Smythe]]. Perrault claims to be an emissary from the temple of Tymora and the captain allows them to board the ship. Perrault demands that Smythe take them to [[Waterdeep]], but the ship is bound for Luskan and Smythe refuses due to the upcoming winter. Over the next few days, Maimun befriends the young deckhand [[Joen]]. Soon, the pirate ship captained by [[Baram]], having been secretly summoned by Perrault, overtakes Smythe's ship, Smythe's crew surrenders and are tied up, while Perrault and Maimun are allowed to roam free as Baram takes them to Waterdeep. \n\nHowever, Perrault's injury worsens and one morning he doesn't wake up. Maimun resolves to take Perrault on Haze to the mainland, claiming to want to go to [[Silverymoon]], where he believes the best healers are. However, instead he and Perrault travel on Haze to the [[Lady's Hall]] in Baldur's Gate, where the priestess Jaide is. After leaving the unconscious Perrault with Alviss in the Empty Flagon, he goes to the temple only to find Asbeel in his path. Jaide appears and gives Maimun the chance to escape.",
            "Part 3": "Back with the pirate, Maimun tries to figure out how to escape captivity. He then continues with his tale.\n\nBack on the ''Sea Sprite'' in 1356 DR: Maimun is recovering from his injury alongside other wounded sailors. He befriends one of them, [[Tasso]], shortly before Tasso passes away. Maimun speaks with Drizzt and as he recovers, he makes friends with the crew, including [[Lucky]] and [[Tonnid]]. He learns to be a sailor as the ship makes its way to [[Memnon]]. Once docked in Memnon, one of the captured pirates (later in the series identified as [[Chrysaor]]) drags him into the water and attempts to kidnap him. However, the wizard [[Robillard]], part of the [[Memnon Harbor Guard]], rescues him. He decides he can no longer endanger his friends on the ship, so it is time to part ways with them.\n\nMaimun runs into Memnon, where he encounters a strange woman (part of the [[Circle]]) who steals the Stone of Tymora he carries and puts him in a magical slumber. When he awakes, Asbeel is standing before him asking for the stone."
