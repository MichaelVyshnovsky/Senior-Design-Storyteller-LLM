        "mainbody": "'''''Journey Through the Jungle''''' was the story of an unnamed traveler and their wilderness guide [[Jaw]], and their adventure together in the jungles of [[Chult]]. It was unknown if it was a work of fiction, or real-life account of an foray into the dangerous jungle landscape.",
        "Contents": "At some point during their trek, the traveler and Jaw heard a cacophony of noise that resembled hundreds of reed pipes being blown at the same time. This heralded the coming of the elusive [[Uluu Thalongh]], a fearsome terror of Chultan legend. The pair attempted to find refuge in the boughs of trees, but unfortunately, Jaw was unable to get away in time. Uluu Thalongh had claimed her as its prey.",
