The composer was unknown.\nHere are a few stanzas from the song\nThe night so long and lonely-o\nLong time til dawn still to go\nAnd I wait all alone-ee-o\nDrink ye, drinky, gone below\nFor wet courage inside to grow\nTo face another sun and battle-o\nIt may be the last Ill ever see\nGods all now watch over me\nAs this lonely song I sing\nFor I would one day be a king\n…"
