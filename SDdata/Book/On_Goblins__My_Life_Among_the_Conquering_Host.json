        "mainbody": "On Goblins My Life Among the Conquering Host was an unpublished manuscript that described the ecology of goblins and goblinoid culture, written by the famous writer and world-weary traveler, Volothamp Geddarm.\nThe writings existed as a set of loosely bound sheets, inscribed with text and rough sketches of various goblins.\nThe draft of this work contained hastily written notes regarding the culture of goblins that were assimilated into the cult of the Absolute. It noted how these goblins held a zealous love for the goddess they referred to as the Absolute. It was that passion that set them apart from other tribes they did not demonstrate the cowardice of typical goblin-kind, and did not scatter in fear when their leaders were slain in battle. On Goblins spoke of more-potent magic―or \"booyagh\" in the goblin tongue―wielded by the cults resident priests.\nAs of the , the only copy of Volos manuscript remained in the possession of Booyagh Piddle."
