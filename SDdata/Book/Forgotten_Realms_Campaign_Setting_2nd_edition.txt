{{quote|''It is a world where the gods have walked and fantastic armies clashed. It is the home of [[Elminster]], [[Alias]], [[Azoun]], [[Khelben]], and [[Drizzt]] the dark elf. It is the most popular fantasy campaign in history. Well met, traveler, and welcome to the [[Forgotten Realms]]!''

''Designed for the AD&amp;D game, the new FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting is a major expansion and complete revision of the original, best-selling boxed set. This set contains everything that a player or Dungeon Master needs to launch into a world of adventure and imagination.''

'''''A Grand Tour of the Realms''' &ndash; a 128-page book, concentrating on the [[Heartlands]], the land of the [[Dales]], [[Cormyr]], and [[Waterdeep]], and chock full of useful information about other significant Realms locations on the continent of [[Faerûn]].''

'''''Running the Realms''' &ndash; a 64-page guide to the Forgotten Realms for the Dungeon Master, showing how to create a Realms campaign, and giving details about secrets, NPCs, and [[deities]] of the Realms.''

'''''Shadowdale''' &ndash; a 96-page book, presenting the most important town in the Realms as the basis of an ongoing campaign, including a new introductory adventure, "Beneath the Twisted Tower."''

'''''8 MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM pages''' covering the deadliest creatures of the Realms!''

'''''6 card sheets''' showing nearly 100 signs, trail glyphs, symbols, magical sigils, and religious symbols of the Realms in full color.''

'''''4 all-new four-color maps''', two of eastern and western Faerûn, and two smaller-scale, detailed maps of the heartlands of the Realms.''}}
