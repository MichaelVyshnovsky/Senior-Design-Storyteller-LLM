'''"Comrades at Odds"''' is a short story by [[R.A. Salvatore]] first published in the 2006 anthology ''[[Realms of the Elves]]''.

==Summary==
[[Tos'un Armgo]] finds himself without any allies since his three drow companions are all dead and he has become an enemy of King [[Obould Many-Arrows]] because of [[Kaer'lic Suun Wett]]'s attempt to kill the orc while Obould and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] were fighting. Tos'un knows that he cannot survive the journey back through the [[Underdark]] alone. Feeling helpless on the surface world, he lets out his rage by attacking orcs with the powerful sentient blade [[Khazid'hea]].

On their journey to recover the body of [[Ellifain]], Drizzt Do'Urden and [[Innovindil]] find that the orc hordes have not yet disbanded after the (so Drizzt and Innovindil believe) death of King Obould. Upon inspection, the two elves find that the orcs are building a gate upon a trail further fortifying the orc kingdom. Realizing there is nothing they can do, they continue their journey.

Tos'un Armgo becomes more powerful and dangerous under the subtle tutelage of Khazid'hea. In the battles the drow wages on unsuspecting orcs, the blade imparts the thoughts of "do not think", instilling to Tos'un to rely on his instincts and training without allowing his conscious thoughts to impede him. This was what Khazid'hea learned from Drizzt in the short time he wielded the blade.

The elves of the [[Moonwood]] find another scene where orcs were slain by Tos'un. [[Sinnafain]] and [[Albondiel]] discuss whether Tos'un is good or evil and that they will treat him accordingly.

Drizzt and Innovindil find and recover the body of Ellifain whereupon Innovindil performs a ritual asking the elven gods to rescue Ellifain from her anger. Innovindil comforts Drizzt and assures him that they will convene with the spirit of Ellifain upon their return to the Moonwood to ease Drizzt's own guilt.

As Tos'un is about to finish slaying an orc encampment, one orc falls to elven arrows. He meets with Sinnafain but she shows no signs of aggression towards him. Khazid'hea implores him to kill her but he resists knowing the he would have a dozen arrows in him before his first attack. An elven priest casts a spell to converse with the dark elf as well as a spell to detect lies. Khazid'hea assists Tos'un to deceive the latter spell. After the encounter, the blade tries to convince Tos'un to leave the elves but the drow knows he has no where else to go.

Drizzt and Innovindil return to the Moonwood where they encounter a patrol of elves. They recount their story to the patrol and also learn that King Obould is still alive and also find out that Tos'un Armgo is now residing in the Moonwood with the elves.

Upon finding out that Drizzt is in the Moonwood, Khazid'hea once again tries to convince Tos'un to leave. The blade tells him that Drizzt will recognize from the battle with Obould and that at the very least he would take Khazid'hea back since it previously belonged to [[Catti-brie]]. Tos'un agrees to leave and the blade tells him to kill Sinnafain who is the elf near to his position. Tos'un strikes her to the ground and puts the blade to her chin but does not kill her. He tells her that he is not her enemy but Drizzt would not understand. After disarming her and moving farther from the camp of elves, he forces Sinnafain to the ground once again and runs away.

When Drizzt and Innovindil meet up with Sinnafain and she tells him of Tos'un's escape, he vows to find him. Later, a priest performs a ritual which allows Ellifain's spirit to possess Innovindil's body. Innovindil's body walks to the hut in which Drizzt is residing in, kneels next to him and confirms that she is the spirit of Ellifain. She embraces him and tells that now she knows the truth. After the spirit of Ellifain leaves, Innovindil returns to a Drizzt free of guilt and ready to face the obstacles before him.
