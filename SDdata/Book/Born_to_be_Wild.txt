Born to be Wild was a small book of erotic fiction found in the Western Heartlands, made without the approval of Volo or Elminster.
The pamphlet contained a magical adventure wherein Elminster lambasted Volo over the inaccuracies and fiction in his accounts of the mating rituals found in the Feywild. The good sage then proceeded to demonstrate the true facts of the matter, described with highly evocative, imagination-stirring prose.
There was a copy of this book in the "stern librarian" themed room in the Sharess Caress brothel in 1492 DR.
