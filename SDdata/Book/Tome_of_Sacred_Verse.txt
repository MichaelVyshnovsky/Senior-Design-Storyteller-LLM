Tomes of Sacred Verse were enchanted prayer books imbued with divine magic created sometime before 1281 DR.
Each Tome of Sacred Verse collected numerous religious musical works, hymns, and lyrical prayers. These books were penned with ink made of the blood of a willing planar being. Words of these songs were imbued with magic alwords of power and calling.
A Tome of Sacred Verse could be read out loud twice per day. The books passages were sung, unleashing their magics. The singers voice always sounded beautiful, radiant, and crystal clear. As long as the singer was performing, their allies who could hear the song became blessed with good luck, while their enemies were cursed with ill fortune. These effects were similar to the divine chant spell.
Tomes of Sacred Verse could only be used by clerics.
In the , the library of the Black Raven Monastery, in the mountains above the Ice Lakes and the Black Raven River, owned a Tome of Sacred Verse and was willing to part it with a hefty fee.
