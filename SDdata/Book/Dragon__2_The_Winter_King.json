        "mainbody": "'''''The Winter King''''' is a short story by [[Chris Avellone]], originally written while working on the video game ''[[Icewind Dale (game)|Icewind Dale]]''. The story was published in ''[[Dragon+ 2]]''.",
        "Summary": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the aging [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith [[Tiernon Denthelm]] begins hearing a mysterious call. The dwarf travels from his home in the [[Sunset Mountains]] to a distant glacier of ''[[black ice]]'' deep in the [[Frozenfar]]. The glacier&mdash;[[Gloomfrost]], is home to a massive ravenous [[polar worm]] named the [[Winter King]] for its fearsome power and ferocity. The creature  has melted a labyrinth of ice caverns through the Gloomfrost. Its hunger led the creature to consume every living thing in the glacier, including its own young and mate.\n\nTiernon finds himself in the ravaged hatchery of the giant remorhaz and is attacked by the creature. His mind crippled by fear and his eyes destroyed by the harsh glacier light, Tiernon finds himself trapped in the caverns of ''black ice''. Wasting away with hunger, the dwarf realizes that the call that drove him here was the ''ice'' speaking to him, asking to be forged and molded. The dwarf creates an ''[[ice-shelled cloak]]'', an ingenious \"egg\" that holds its unbreakable shape and, when turned inside out, becomes a razor-sharp weapon. The smith confronts the Winter King and kills the massive worm with the help of the ''ice-shelled cloak''. Tiernon claims the melted ''black ice'' caverns as his forge, safe from a deadly monster",
