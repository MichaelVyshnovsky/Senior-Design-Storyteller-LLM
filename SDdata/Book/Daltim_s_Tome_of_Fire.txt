'''''Daltim's Tome of Fire''''' was a [[spellbook]] written by the [[wizard]] and [[psionicist]] [[Daltim Flamefist]] of [[Halruaa]]. It contained a number of rare and unique fire-based [[spell]]s, details on several light- and fire-themed magical items, and brief treatises on [[fire magic]], [[psionics]], and the creation of psionically empowered items. It was lost, presumed stolen, in [[Tethyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}

==Description==
''Daltim's Tome of Fire'' was a small book, only around {{SI|9|in|c}} high, {{SI|5|in|c}} wide and {{SI|1|in|c}} thick. It contained only fifty pages of thick paper light gray in color. It was bound in rich red leather, said to be the hide of a [[salamander]], and a [[dragon]]-like design—Daltim's sigil—was stamped on the front cover. The cover was unnaturally warm to the touch, but the pages unnaturally cool. They could not be burned.

==Powers==
In addition to the written [[spell]]s it contained, the book was protected by ''[[Daltim's proof against fire]]'', rendering it impervious to flame; and ''[[Daltim's fiery protector]]'', which summoned a minor [[fire elemental]] to guard it if opened by anyone but Daltim.

==History==
Daltim lost the tome in [[Tethyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]], while his mercenary company, the [[Destroyers]], were involved in the civil war there. The book was presumed stolen, as he was unlikely to forget or lose it. Daltim fortunately had other copies of the spells, but wished to recover for the book for the many notes he'd made in it.

He still hadn't located his ''Tome of Fire'' by the mid-1370s DR, and was offering a hefty 10,000-[[gp]] reward for its return, with 1,000 gp for credible information as to its whereabouts.

==Contents==
The pages contained a number of rare and even unique fire-themed spells, including:
* ''[[Daltim's flaming fist]]''
* ''[[Daltim's fiery protector]]''
* ''[[Daltim's proof against fire]]''
* ''[[everlasting fire]]''
* ''[[flameproof]]''
* ''[[fire gate]]''
* ''[[shroud of flame]]''
* ''[[unburn]]''

The book also gave details of a number of magical items related to light and fire, namely:
* ''[[magic match]]''
* ''[[magic tinderbox]]''
* ''[[glow ring]]''
* ''[[one-way lantern]]''
It also gave instructions for fashioning the ''magic tinderbox''.

Finally, the book had notes on creating psionically empowered items, together with a brief treatise on their benefits, as well as more general treatises on psionic powers and fire magic.
