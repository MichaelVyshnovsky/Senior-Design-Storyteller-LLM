        "Evil denizens of the depths: the [[sahuagin]]. \n\nThe sahuagin are known by many names. Some call them the Devil Men of the Deep; to others, they are simply the Sea Devils. This deadly race of aquatic beings has remained a mystery to surface dwellers - until now. This fully illustrated 96-page accessory details the highly organized structure of sahuagin society, offers insight into the workings of the predatory sahuagin mind, and examines the worship of [[Sekolah]], the dark sahuagin deity. ''The Sea Devils'' also includes a full description of a typical sahuagin village easily usable in any campaign setting, new spells that are granted to sahuagin [[priestess]]es, and a color poster detailing the sahuagin in all their variety.\n\nThis book is the second in a series of accessories that focuses on some of the most popular monsters in the AD&D game. DMs and players alike should also look for ''[[Evil Tide]]'', ''[[Night of the Shark]]'', and ''[[Sea of Blood]]'', a trilogy of MONSTROUS ARCANA adventures centered around sahuagin. \n}}": "=Index==",
