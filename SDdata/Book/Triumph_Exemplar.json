        "Contents": "''Triumph Exemplar'' contained extensive accounts of Netheril's wars and conflicts. One such chronicle was the legendary [[Last Stand at Humaithira]], the brutal battle between Strategor [[Matick]] [[Netherese]] army and the invading [[giant]]s of Thane [[Blóta]] of [[Skammháls]]. Though Matick was slain and his army destroyed, he inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and won time for reinforcements to gather and later defeat the giants.",
