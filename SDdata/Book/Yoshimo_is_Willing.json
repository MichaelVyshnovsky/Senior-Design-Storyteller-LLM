        "mainbody": "oshimo is Willing was a short novel of revisionist history and erotic adventures found in the Western Heartlands.\nThe book contained a sensational, ahistorical, and very erotic account of the bounty hunter Yoshimo and his adventures with the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian during the 14 century DR. Rather than betraying the Bhaalspawn, the books presented the possibility that Yoshimo was in fact very loyal and very willing to do whatever Abdel wished, with exciting and erotic results.\nA copy was kept in the library of the Sharess Caress brothel in 1492 DR."
