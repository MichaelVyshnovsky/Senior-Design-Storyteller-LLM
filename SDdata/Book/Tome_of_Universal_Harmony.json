        "mainbody": "The '''''Tome of Universal Harmony''''' was the most holy [[book]] of the god [[Deneir]]. It was regularly studied and memorized by his disciples.",
        "Description": "It was a large tome in thick black bindings, containing nearly two thousand pages.<ref>\n\nThe book was worth reading more than once during one's life, as one's perceptions of the world changed, while the words in the book remained the same, so the meaning of those words would change as well.<ref>",
        "Powers": {
            "Song of Universal Harmony": "Thoroughly reading and letting oneself get into the book led to hearing the \"song\" of the book in the reader's mind, that is, the special meaning underlying its words. A reader could get lost in that song though, with the song draining one's strength quickly. Several aged high-ranked Deneirian priests had been found dead over the book; though their deaths were attributed to natural causes, it was probable they'd lacked the strength to control its effects. A younger man, Cadderly, thought of the song in contrasts, as strange but beautiful and sweet but melancholy, a song of living and dying, of sunrise and sunset, of salvation and damnation, of eternal energy and finite matter, and everything in between. He even heard voices singing with reverent tones and archaic accents, but could not make out their actual words.\n\nA [[Chosen]] could call upon the song at any time and use the power that came with the song. Recalling a certain page, along with the right melody, gave the priest the power to enact different kinds of magic.<ref>",
            "Affinity": "Chosen hearing the song have the ability to turn into the animal with which they were the most familiar. [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], a [[Chosen]] of Deneir could turn into a giant white squirrel, much like his animal friend, the white squirrel [[Percival]].<ref>",
            "Aurora": "When a Chosen was totally into the song, feeling it with his or her whole being, the soul of other people revealed itself in form of shadowy images on top of their shoulders. This effect was called ''Aurora''. The priest saw the shadows as an interpretation of the person's strongest feelings or urgings.<ref>",
            "Prevision": "A Chosen sometimes had the gift of previsionâ€•foreseeing events that would inevitably come to pass.<ref>",
            "Spells": "The pages contained various [[spell]]s that had to be memorized in form of a song, such as spells of healing, words of silence,<ref> words of light,<ref> a spell to enhance one's hearing,<ref> a spell to outline and reveal an invisible person,<ref> a spell to dispel malevolent collections of magic,<ref> and a spell of hypnosis.<ref>"
