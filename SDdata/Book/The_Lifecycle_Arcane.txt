'''''The Lifecycle Arcane''''' was a book that described an idealized [[wizard]]'s life.

It outlined a hypothetical wizard's life as they advanced, proceeding through apprenticeship, [[cantrip]] mastery, graduation, acquiring a [[spellbook]], specializing in a [[school of magic]], building a laboratory, crafting a [[magical item]], building a stronghold, taking on apprentices, retirement, and ultimately [[lich]]dom.

The [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] referred heavily to this book in his life, though his completion of the final stage left much to be desired.
