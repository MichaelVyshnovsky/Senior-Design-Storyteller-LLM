The Lifecycle Arcane was a book that described an idealized wizards life.
It outlined a hypothetical wizards life as they advanced, proceeding through apprenticeship, cantrip mastery, graduation, acquiring a spellbook, specializing in a school of magic, building a laboratory, crafting a magical item, building a stronghold, taking on apprentices, retirement, and ultimately lichdom.
The lich Adzerak referred heavily to this book in his life, though his completion of the final stage left much to be desired.
