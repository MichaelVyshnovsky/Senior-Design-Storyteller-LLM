        "mainbody": "ecipes for Knaves was a book of recommendations and practices for thieves thinly-veiled as a cookbook that could be found in the city of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\nOne of the \"recipes\" described in the book was the Poor Mans Soup that listed a hemp rope, a sack, two scary thugs, a blackjack, a bucket of cold water, and a polite thug as its ingredients. The recipe called for finding a good-aligned cleric, knocking them out, abducting them, and convincing them to cast the create food and water spell. The cleric was invited to the freshly-created dinner to show them there were no hard feeling afterward.\nIn mid 14 century DR, Recipes for Knaves could be found in the city of Daggerford, notably in the possessions of a sadistic burglar named Parker."
