        "mainbody": "'''''Recipes for Knaves''''' was a book of recommendations and practices for thieves thinly-veiled as a cookbook that could be found in the city of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Contents": "One of the \"recipes\" described in the book was the Poor Man's Soup that listed a hemp [[rope]], a sack, two scary thugs, a [[blackjack]], a bucket of cold water, and a polite thug as its ingredients. The recipe called for finding a [[good]]-aligned [[cleric]], knocking them out, abducting them, and convincing them to cast the ''[[create food and water]]'' [[spell]]. The cleric was invited to the freshly-created dinner to show them there were no hard feeling afterward.",
        "History": "In mid 14{{th}} century DR, ''Recipes for Knaves'' could be found in the city of Daggerford, notably in the possessions of a sadistic burglar named [[Parker (bandit)|Parker]]."
