'''''Kozakuran Dictionary''''' was a reference [[book]] that listed words and their translation from [[Kozakuran]] in the alphabetical order, found the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] and printed sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the contents of the ''Kozakuran Dictionary'' were considered to be ancient. A copy of the dictionary belonged to the staff of the [[Szarr Palace]] in the [[Lower City]]. Its master was a Kozakuran vampire [[Cazador Szarr]], who used the Kozakuran language to work sealing magics on the mansion's ballroom doors. Some of the words that were used for this purpose were underlined in the copy of the dictionary used to train the new staff by Chamberlain [[Antwun Dufay]]. They were: "open," "enter," "beware," "sealed," and "forbidden."
