        "mainbody": "The Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set is a boxed set for the 5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Intended to serve as a basic introduction to tabletop D&D, it contains a set of basic rules, an adventure, several pre-made character sheets, and a set of dice. The adventure is Lost Mine of Phandelver, an introductory adventure module for 4–5 player-characters taking them from 1 level to 5 as they battle goblins and bandits whilst trying to explore the eponymous mines.\n* Starter Set Rulebook, a 32-page booklet containing a basic set of rules for adventurers levels 1&ndash5.\n* Lost Mine of Phandelver, a 64-page adventure booklet\n* 5 pregenerated character sheets\n* 6 game dice\nA trio of dwarf explorers—Gundren, Nundro, and Tharden Rockseeker—recently located the ancient Wave Echo Cave, the location of the mysterious Forge of Spells. Gundren, with map in hand, heads north to recruit aid. A new group of adventurers are contracted in Neverwinter to escort Gundren Rockseekers mining equipment down the High Road to Phandalin. Gundren and a knight, Sildar Hallwinter, go on ahead. However, word of the caves discovery reaches a drow known as the Black Spider, who captures one of the Rockseeker brothers and starts to excavate the mine. However, the mine is crawling with undead and other hazards. In order to keep the caves location hidden, and his activity quiet, the Black Spider hires Iarno Albrek, an ex-member of the Lords Alliance. Albrek leads the Redbrands, a notorious group of bandits, and they continuously harass the nearby townsfolk of Phandalin, keeping it under tight control.\nOn their way back down south, both Gundren and Sildar are ambushed by goblins of the Cragmaw tribe. Gundren is taken by the goblins to Cragmaw Castle, whilst Sildar is taken to the Cragmaw Hideout. The adventurers follow the same route, and are also ambushed by the goblins. After fending them off, they either find their way to the hideout or arrive at Phandalin. The townsfolk of Phandalin are having a hard time whilst the Redbrand bandits are about, and the adventurers may investigate their hideout. In doing so, they may face off against Iarno Albrek. Following this, and acquiring important information, the adventurers can head to the Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, if they somehow acquired knowledge of its whereabouts. If they arrive at the castle, they take down the Cragmaw tribe and find Gundrens map (and Gundren too, if he is still alive).\nThe adventurers finally locate Wave Echo Cave and begin to explore the dark caverns. One of the Rockseeker brothers has been slain near the entrance. After taking down several enemies, including doppelgangers and maybe even the Black Spider himself, they have the opportunity to rescue Nundro Rockseeker. The adventure concludes when the victorious party locates the Forge of Spells, and find out its mystical powers.\nAdventuring Gear\nbackpack • bedroll • bell • blanket • book • candle • carpenters
