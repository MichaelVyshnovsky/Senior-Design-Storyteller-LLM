        "History": "A single, nearly-ruined copy of the book was known to lay within the treasure vault of the [[Tomb of Diderius]], ''circa'' the 1480s [[DR]].{{ToD-time}} That copy was somehow linked to the [[ghost]] of [[Ilda]], one of [[Diderius]]' apprentices. If it was returned to its rightful place in the tomb's library, Ilda's spectral form would no longer be bound to [[Toril]]."
