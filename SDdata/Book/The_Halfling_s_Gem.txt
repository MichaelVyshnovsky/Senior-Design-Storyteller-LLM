'''''The Halfling's Gem''''' is the third book in the [[Icewind Dale trilogy]] by [[R.A. Salvatore]]. It was later reissued as book six of the [[Legend of Drizzt]] series.

{{quote|''Assassin [[Artemis Entreri]] whisks his kidnapped victim, [[Regis]] the halfling, south to [[Calimport]] and into [[Pasha]] [[Pook]]'s vengeful hands. If Pook can control the magical panther [[Guenhwyvar]], Regis will die in a real game of cat and mouse.''

''Using an enchanted mask, dark elf [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] hides his heritage and races with the barbarian [[Wulfgar]] to save their light-fingered friend. An unexpected ally arrives just as Entreri springs a trap. But can Regis survive unscathed?''

''The companions from [[Icewind Dale]] battle pirates on the famed [[Sword Coast]], brave the deserts of [[Calimshan]], and fight monsters from other planes to rescue their friend... and themselves.''}}

== Summary ==
In the first part of the book, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Wulfgar]] are on their way to catch up with the assassin [[Artemis Entreri]] who captured [[Regis]]. First they visit [[Malchor Harpell]] who gives them equipment and advice, then they defeat a [[banshee]] to retrieve a magical mask that has the power to show Drizzt as a normal elf or human. In [[Waterdeep]], guided by [[Khelben]], they board [[Deudermont]]'s ship and they reach [[Baldur's Gate]].
Entreri, using [[Regis#Equipment|Regis' magical ruby pendant]] to his own advantage, is always ahead of them though, in spite of the halfling's efforts to slow the assassin down.
In the meanwhile [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], believed dead in [[Mithral Hall]], fights his way out of his ancient home and manages to get out, even though he was poisoned.

In the second part of the book, Bruenor is rescued by Lady [[Alustriel]], healed, and brought to the [[Ivy Mansion]]. There he is reunited with [[Catti-brie]] and soon they plan to leave and catch up with Drizzt and Wulfgar. In the meanwhile the [[Pasha Pook]] is informed of the drow and the barbarian who are following Entreri, so he hires a pirate, [[Pinochet]], to get rid of them. Deudermont's ship is saved only by the arrival of Bruenor and Catti-brie. After that the four friends reunited reach [[Calimshan]] and proceed their travel by land, after escaping an assassination attempt by a greedy merchant. In the meanwhile Entreri arrives in [[Calimport]], Pasha Pook gets his magical pendant back, and Regis is tortured.

In the last part of the book the companions arrive in Calimport and plan to sneak into Pook's guild. They are waited by both Pook and Entreri though, and in the ensuing fights Drizzt finds himself dueling with Entreri while Wulfgar is separated from his friends. Entreri, injured, runs away, and the companions join Wulfgar inside Pook's guild, fighting off the Pasha's [[wererat]] allies. As a last resort, Pook's wizard, [[LaValle]] sends the companions in the terrible [[Tarterus]] plane with the powerful [[Taros Hoop]], but the heroes manage to escape thanks to the help of Regis and to destroy the magic artifact. Pook, trying to run away, is killed by [[Guenhwyvar]], while the remaining wererats are wiped out by the panther's astral friends. After everything is settled, Regis makes himself the new guildmaster.

The book ends with Drizzt, Bruenor, Wulfgar and Catti-brie returning to the North and going to the war to get back Mithral Hall. The battle is won, Bruenor is crowned king, [[Settlestone]] starts to be rebuilt by Wulfgar's people, and the barbarian marries Catti-brie. Drizzt, who is often out meeting Lady Alustriel, joins his friends for the wedding, as well as Regis, but the halfling's visit is out of necessity: he's running away from something once again...
