"Ex Libris" is a short adventure for Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition published in Dungeon #29.
The party are hired by the Vault of the Sages to recover any and all books of value from the Bard Keep, a ruined Oghmanyte library-temple located in the Nether Mountains north and east of Silverymoon. What theyre not told however, is that the ruins have been declared off-limits by the Church of Oghma.
The priesthood of the Halls of Inspiration therefore, knowing that adventurers have been hired to go to Bard Keep, hire their own group of adventurers to keep the player party from their destination. Additionally, the ruins themselves are haunted by the priests who died during Bard Keeps destruction, and the library room specifically is magical and constantly rearranges itself to trap invaders and prevent them from accessing certain areas.
Should the party overcome their opponents, and learn the secrets of the shifting library, they can return to the Vault of the Sages with a wealth of books and be richly rewarded, but they will have made an enemy of the local Oghmanyte priests.
