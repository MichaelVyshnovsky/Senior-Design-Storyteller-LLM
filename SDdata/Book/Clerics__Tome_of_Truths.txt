'''''Clerics' Tome of Truths''''' was a unique tome of divine knowledge from the old city of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Clerics' Tome of Truths'' was a large tan book with worn bindings and cover that weighted {{SI|2|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
This book possessed beneficial magics that increase the wisdom of the book's owner and increased their resistance to magi spells and spell-like abilities of various monstrous creatures. Additionally, the tome boosted their initiative in battle and allowed for casting of the ''[[Prayer (spell)|prayer]]'' spell. ''Clerics' Tome of Truths'' held four charges of that spell.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], ''Clerics' Tome of Truths'' could be recovered from an ancient library within the First Cellars of the [[Elven Catacombs]] of Myth Drannor. Even though most books were withered away by ravages of time, this tome and ''[[Sorcerers' Cyclopedia Illuminati]]'' were preserved by enchantments woven into the books. The library was home to a [[dark naga]] and its magically enslaved [[orog]]s.
