        "Description": "''How the Mighty Are Fallen'' is an [[Arcane Age]] adventure and is set within the ancient empire of [[Netheril]] in the lead-up to [[Karsus's Folly]].\n\n''How the Mighty Are Fallen'' is a high-level adventure designed for PCs between levels 11 and 14, set in the ancient realm of Netheril. This challenging and epic adventure involves several formidable encounters and quests. The characters will face the Tarrasque, an incredibly powerful and fearsome creature known for its near-invulnerability and destructive capabilities. Additionally, the PCs will confront an army of undead, adding a layer of supernatural danger and complexity to their journey.\n\nFurthermore, the adventure presents an encounter with a golden dragon, a creature renowned for its might and majesty, adding to the array of formidable challenges the PCs must overcome. Beyond these battles, the PCs have the opportunity to embark on a quest to discover the lost Nether Scrolls, ancient artifacts of immense power and significance.\n\nIn a climactic turn of events, the adventure also allows the characters to gather components for a spell with an extraordinary purpose: the ability to kill a god.",
