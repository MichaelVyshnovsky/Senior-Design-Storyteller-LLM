Hordes of Dragonspear is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module for the Forgotten Realms.
Hordes of Dragonspear is the 2 book in the FRQ series. The adventure utilizes the Battlesystem ruleset for large scale battles.
It is designed as a high-level adventure, ideally suited for a party of heroes predominantly within the 10th to 12th level range and consisting of five or six members. Should the player group not fit this profile, it is recommended that the DM modify some of the encounters in the book to better align with the partys level and size, ensuring a balanced and appropriate challenge for the players.
The adventure kicks off with the heroes in Daggerford, where they receive news of a significant force of goblins and kobolds emerging from the Misty Forest. In response to this emerging threat to the Trade Way, the local militia mobilizes immediately. However, when the leader of the militia suffers an injury, the PCs are summoned to assume command of these inexperienced troops.
Once the heroes take command, the Daggerford Army marches southward. They encounter the humanoid forces near the Way Inn. At this location, they ally with a group of mercenaries and engage in battle with the Marauders. With some fortune, they manage to defeat them. However, to their dismay, they discover that the horde is led by a cornugon, known as Vrag, significantly escalating the severity of the threat.
Leaving their amassed forces under the command of their newly appointed leader, the PCs venture into the Misty Forest. In the depths of the wilderness, they encounter a wild elf who has been living like a beast and has succumbed to madness. This elf was once the leader of his tribe, which was decimated by an army of humanoids from the High Moors. Captured and taken in chains to Dragonspear Castle, he suffered greatly.
Upon curing the elf of his insanity, the heroes glean several critical pieces of information. They learn that the overarching leader of the marauding horde is a pit fiend, operating from Dragonspear Castle. Additionally, they discover that the dragon serving the pit fiend is doing so unwillingly, coerced by a magical hold exerted by one of the cornugons leading the enemy forces. The heroes understand that if this magical control were to be broken, the dragon would likely forsake the cause it currently supports, or possibly even turn against its oppressor.
The heroes, with the help of a local druid, uncover crucial information regarding the dragons situation. They learn that the dragon is bound to obey the cornugon named Vesarius due to an enchanted spear. This spear, which Vesarius crafted, was made from the horn of the dragon itself, thus establishing a powerful magical control over the creature. The druid advises the heroes that destroying this enchanted spear is the key to liberating the dragon from its mental bondage, presenting them with a clear objective to pursue in their quest.
