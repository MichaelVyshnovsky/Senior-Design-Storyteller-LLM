Elminster travels to Myth Drannor. On the way, he encounters Iymbryl Alastrarra, an elven noble slain by hobgoblins. Imbryl gives him the Kiira of House Alastrarra to return to the house, which he does in the guise of an elf. His identity as a human is exposed to the elves, who want to kill him for entering Cormanthor, but he invokes the protection of Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl. Many elves begin plots against Eltargrim, Elminster, and the Srinshee, especially House Starym. An elven lady named Symrustar Auglamyr flirts with Elminster, blows up several jealous suitors, and tries to dominate his mind, but he resists the spell and leaves her exposed to one of her rivals, who mutilates her. Elminster is blamed for the deaths and eventually slain, but preserved by Mystra in an incorporeal state. He becomes a slave/apprentice to Llombaerth Starym, known as the Masked, along with a half-elf named Nacacia. Llombaerth tries to kill Mythanthar, who is creating a mythal spell to protect the city once Eltargrim opens in, but fails. Elminster becomes Elmara to break free of his control as House Starym attempts to overthrow Eltargrim, but the coup is unsuccessful, as is an attempt to sabotage the casting of the mythal, which costs Mythanthar his life.
