Denial of Resource is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.
A young red dragon with a lair in the Graypeak Mountains has grown more bold and has attacked the village of Shining Falls. Evidence gathered from Zhentarim emissaries shows that the evil organization is also planning on using it to threaten Loudwater. Kalahar Twohands therefore orders a dragon hunt to curb the potential threat.
