'''"The Staff of Valmaxian"''' is a short story by [[Philip Athans]] first published in the 2006 anthology ''[[Realms of the Elves]]''.

====Summary====
In {{Yearlink|-7628}} in the gold elven realm of [[Siluvanede]], [[Valmaxian]] is a young gold elf mage who has trouble mastering the creation of magic items. His frustration and thirst for magic leads him to steal one of his master's scrolls to summon the demon [[En'Sel'Diren]]. Valmaxian asks for magic, and En'Sel'Diren agrees to grant it, for a price none of them yet knows.

Six hundred and sixty four years later, Valmaxian is the most sought-after and pompous magic item crafter, when he hears that his old master, [[Kelaerede]], is on his deathbed and has sent for him. Master and student had not spoken to each other since Valmaxian's bargain with the devil, but the student still visited his master. Kelaerede wanted Valmaxian to admit that his ways were flawed and repent in order to rest in peace, something that Valmaxian himself did not agree upon, but he finally gave in after the prompting of [[Chasianna]], Kelaerede's granddaughter.

Two years later, Valmaxian and Chasianna are now lovers and Valmaxian is working on his masterpiece staff. His demon magic is not enough to complete it, though, while Chasianna's magic of self-sacrifice fares better on it. For that, Valmaxian summons En'Sel'Diren once more, but before striking a new bargain, En'Sel'Diren asks for Chasianna as payment for their previous bargain. Valmaxian refuses, but his magic is not enough to stop the demon from taking her anyway. Valmaxian follows them into the [[Abyss]], and after fighting off En'Sel'Diren's minions he faces the demon himself. In the end, he has to sacrifice his masterpiece staff and his demon magic in order to save him and his lover from the demon's clutches.
