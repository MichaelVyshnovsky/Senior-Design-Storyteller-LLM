        "mainbody": "Shields Aflame A History of Kings and Battles of the North, was an authoritative book of the history of the Sword Coast North, very popular in the Heartlands of the Realms.\nThe book was quite small but very thick, and often suffered from the bindings breaking, resulting in the loose stack of pages being tied together or kept in a box.\nShields Aflame was a scholarly history of the rulers and battles of the Sword Coast North. Not just a dry collection of facts, it was well written and entertaining, adding to its popularity.\nThe book was very popular in the 14 century DR and was widely used as an encylopedic reference, as well as simply a source of interesting topics to discuss or muse over. It was reprinted in a new (but identical) edition by an Athkatlan printer who included a threat on the flyleaf, promising a \"dark curse\" upon anyone who copied the work."
