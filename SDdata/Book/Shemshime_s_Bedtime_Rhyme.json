        "mainbody": "'''''Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme''''' was a mechanical pop-up book that was haunted and [[curse]]d by the malevolent [[undead]] spirit [[Shemshime]].",
        "Description": "The book was a [[gnome|gnomish]] mechanical contraption made from wood and [[copper]] that had no pages but consisted instead of four different illustrated and animated pop-up scenes. A [[silver]] [[music box]] was attached to the side of the book, playing an infectious, metallic tune while the book was open. The book was both large and square, measuring {{SI|18|inch|c|long=yes}} along each side.\n\nThe pop-up scenes depicted a shadowy figure looking on as members of a family died in grisly ways: the mother maiming her husband with a scythe, a [[dog]] biting off the mother's hand, and the son drowning in a river. A final scene depicted the daughter crushing the shadowy figure under a millstone,",
        "Curse": "Anyone subjected to the melody produced by the music box in ''Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme'' became cursed and found themselves humming the tune incessantly. Those so afflicted could then transmit the curse via their own humming. Eventually, those cursed by Shemshime's melody had the associated rhyme implanted in their minds. The rhyme worked as a summoning ritual for Shemshime; when enough voices joined together in singing it, Shemshime would be restored.",
        "Rhyme": "Although not present in the book itself, Shemshime's rhyme narrated its scenes.\n\n{{Quote|''See a mother scything wheat<br />Forgotten husband sleeping near<br />With one swing she took his feet<br />With another took his ear<br /><br />Does the shadow have a name?<br />SHEMSHIME<br />Causes grief, avoids the blame<br />SHEMSHIME<br /><br />See a dog that knows how to heel<br />Never heeds plea nor command<br />Mother gave it a tasty meal<br />Dog chose instead to eat her hand<br /><br />Does the shadow have a name?<br />SHEMSHIME<br />Causes grief, avoids the blame<br />SHEMSHIME<br /><br />See a son doing his chose<br />Washing clothes for folk in town<br />Fell into the river's roar<br />Sank to the bottom and drowned<br /><br />Does the shadow have a name?<br />SHEMSHIME<br />Causes grief, avoids the blame<br />SHEMSHIME|source=Shemshime's rhyme}}\n\nThe final stanza was left unrevealed as long as the book's music box remained broken. It narrated the scene in which the daughter triumphed over Shemshime:\n\n{{Quote|''See a daughter grinding grain<br />Wish the spirit's time was through<br />Trap set for the shadow bane<br />Her millstone killed it true|Shemshime's rhyme}}",
        "History": "''Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme'' was created by a wandering gnomish [[bard]] who was fascinated by a local legend that told of how a family living in a water mill was plagued by an evil spirit called Shemshime, until the daughter of the family destroyed the spirit by crushing it under a [[Chauntea]]-blessed millstone. Unfortunately, by setting down the story in a book, the bard inadvertently gave Shemshime a conduit to the world of the living. The book was eventually discovered in a shipwreck by an [[adventurer]], who then passed it on to [[Yowen Pilt]], a procurer of rare tomes.\n\nYowen delivered the book to [[Candlekeep]] around the 800s [[DR]]Yowen Pilt's delivery is said to have taken place \"over six hundred years\" prior to \"Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme\", which is set in 1492 DR. as part of a bundle containing several other works. He had been driven mad by Shemshime's curse by the time he arrived, and so he was placed in isolation for several weeks as the fortress library contained what they referred to as a \"singing madness\" that had spread among the [[Avowed]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme'' was slated to have its spine repaired in Candlekeep's [[Firefly Cellar]]. The [[kenku]] custodian [[Crinkle]] opened the book and became afflicted with Shemshime's curse."
