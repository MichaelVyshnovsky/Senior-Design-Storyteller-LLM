The Inner Planes is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. It is part of the Planescape campaign setting.
The Inner Planes was published by TSR in 1998, and provides a comprehensive guide to the Inner Planes.
The book is organized into several chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the Inner Planes. These chapters include discussions of the nature of the Inner Planes, their inhabitants and ecology, as well as the various portals and pathways that connect them to the other planes of existence. It detailed descriptions of the environments and regions of each of the eighteen Inner Planes.
One of the key features of The Inner Planes is its focus on the philosophical and metaphysical implications of the Inner Planes. The book explores the ways in which the elemental forces that underpin reality are intertwined with larger cosmic concepts, such as the balance between chaos and order, or the struggle between good and evil.
In addition to its detailed descriptions of the Inner Planes themselves, the sourcebook also includes new rules and mechanics for players and dungeon masters, allowing them to more fully explore and interact with the planes during their campaigns.
