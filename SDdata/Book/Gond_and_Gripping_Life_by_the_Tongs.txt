Gond and Gripping Life by the Tongs was a "religious" book dedicated to the Gondians of Baldurs Gate, penned in the late 15 century DR.
The contents of the book were crudely written praises and venerations of the deity himself, his clergy, and the authors awe in the face of the newly-forged steel watchers of Baldurs Gate – the creations of the Church of Gond.
Gond and Gripping Life by the Tongs was penned in the , sometime after the steel watchers were created with the help of new Lord Enver Gortash and put into service alongside the Flaming Fists in the Lower City. A copy of the book was available to the guests of the non-denominational temple – the Stormshore Tabernacle.
