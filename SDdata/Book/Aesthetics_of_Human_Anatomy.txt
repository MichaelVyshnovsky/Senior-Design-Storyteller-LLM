{{quote|...The human neck is a complex array or vertebrae, discs, muscles, and ligaments. The uppermost disc connects the spine to the skull. Nerves spread down from the neck and into the arms creating a sensory pathway...|Excerpt from ''Aesthetics of Human Anatomy''.}}

==Contents==
The book contained detailed information of [[human]] anatomy, the body's functions, works, and its many bones, organs, and muscles.

==History==
In 1372 DR, a [[Dalelands]]' necromancer [[Daxiong]] used the ''Aesthetics of Human Anatomy'' to guide his research of creating an improved version of the zombification process. His later more successful [[zombie]] prototypes were taught to recite fragments of the book on command.
