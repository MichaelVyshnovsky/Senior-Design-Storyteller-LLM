'''Neverwinter Nights''' was a serialized [[chapbook]] typically published every six to ten days in [[Neverwinter]].

==Contents==
''Neverwinter Nights'' was a periodical that covered topics of interest for the Neverwintian high society: culture, arts, events, reviews of musical, theater, and oratorical performances, and of course, gossip. The publication followed a lax schedule, releasing regular issues and printing "special issues" if something sudden of note happened in the city. ''Neverwinter Nights'' kept its readers informed of famous musicians' visits, new fanciful establishments, and upcoming [[book]] releases. Arguably, the ''Neverwinter Nights''' gossip section was the most popular, covering high society feuds, disgraceful occurrences, scandals, bans, and even murders and pregnancies. As of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Neverwinter Nights was edited and published by [[Lundrago Mursimmur]].
