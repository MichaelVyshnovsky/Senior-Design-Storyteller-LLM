Some of the people found in the ledger were [[Maj Pinner]], who died in a laboratory explosion with the final words of \"Come see this! It's mov—\"; [[Hroth Kress]], who was killed in a [[Neverwinter]] alley with the final words of \"Hm?\"; and [[Dhana Ree]], a [[Waterdhavian]] who perished of [[featherlung]] with the final words of \"You're blocking my light.\"",
