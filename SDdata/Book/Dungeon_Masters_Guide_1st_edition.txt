The Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition is the Dungeon Masters Guide for the 1 edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.
The Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition was the original Dungeon Masters Guide for the AD&D game, authored by Gary Gygax and first published in August 1979. Note that unlike other publications from future editions which were entitled "Dungeon Masters Guide" (such as Dungeon Masters Guide 3rd edition or Dungeon Masters Guide 3.5), this books title lacks the apostrophe.
The Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition covered the essential game rules for the Dungeon Master creating and managing both player characters and non-player characters, directing combat, and handling adventures and campaigns that last multiple sessions. The book also included game statistics for magic items and treasure, details how to use random monster encounters, and provides statistics for some of the basic monsters and creatures of the game. New magic items were introduced. It contains scores of tables and charts for figuring damage and resolving encounters in a typical adventure, tables and rules for creating characters, and lists of the various abilities of the different classes of characters. 
A feature of the Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition was the random dungeon generator. The generator allowed the Dungeon Master, by the rolling of dice, to generate a dungeon adventure "on the fly". A dungeon complete with passageways, rooms, treasure, monsters, and other encounters could easily and randomly be constructed as the player progressed. It could be used with several people or a single player.
The Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition has gone through several versions through the years.
The first printing of the Dungeon Masters Guide had a print run of around 40,000 copies. It was first made available at Gen Con XII on 16â€“19 August 1979.
In August 1979, an edition of the Dungeon Masters Guide was printed which accidentally contained sixteen pages from the fourth printing of the Monster Manual 1st edition. A recall was issued quickly and the error was corrected, but a few copies of this printing are still in circulation.
Between August and September 1979, the corrected version of the second print was sold. The original covers from the second print alpha were recycled to create this print, making it recognizable.
The third print of the Dungeon Master Guide occurred between September and November 1979. The boxing machine used for this printing had a loose wire, causing half of the books to have a deep score mark on the cover. This "alpha" print was recalled, the scored copies were removed, and it was sent out again. It is believed that the non-scored copies became the "beta" print. [http//www.acaeum.com The Acaeum] believes that the "gamma" print was created from the scored copies, whose covers were replaced.
The Acaeum speculates that the fourth print might have been created from books left over from the third print alpha. In the fifth print, a number of minor changes were made to the books cover.
The sixth print (December 1979) introduced six additional numbered pages, increasing the total from 232 to 238, some text was revised, images removed and a reference section added.
From the December 1979 printing
In 1983 the book was again reprinted but this time, the cover art was altered. The book was printed again many times, and print information began appearing within the book from 1985 onwards. By July 1990, the book had reached its fourteenth print. The Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition was reproduced as a premium reprint on July 17, 2012.
