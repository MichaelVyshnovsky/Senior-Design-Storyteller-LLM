Always, new beginnings... it's why the world grows ever more crowded, ye see. So remember, now–there are no endings, only beginnings. There; simple enough, isn't it? Elegant, too.''|Tharghin \"Threeboots\" Ammatar}}",
        "Contents": "Tharghin Ammatar's tome collected the sage's musings and speeches on various topics. One part of note was dedicated to the philosophy of endings, death. The man argued for there being no real endings, only beginnings in life. He considered that pain of view quite elegant.\n\nThe original copy of ''Speeches of a Most Worthy Sage'' was kept in the library-citadel of [[Candlekeep]] on the [[Sword Coast]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}"
