'''''Assassin Mountain''''' is an adventure module for 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''. It is part of the [[Al-Qadim]] campaign setting and set in [[Zakhara]].

{{Quote|'''''The Caliph of Shadows awaits!'''''

''The Assassins of [[Zakhara]] strike in silence and from darkness, certain of their faith and the rightness of their cause. The slayers carry out the orders of their Grandfather assassin, never questioning his wisdom or direction.''

Assassin Mountain ''is the DM's guide to the secrets and objectives of the assassins.''<br/>
''Captured inside this Sourcebox, you'll find new information about the [[holy slayer]]s of Zakhara, from their methods, tools, and secret structure to the means used to ensure the silence of their members.''<br/>
''The adventures within pit the player characters against the slayers of the [[Everlasting]], one of the most powerful and influential sects in Zakhara. The web of deceit and terror spun by the Everlasting weaves its way into the city of [[Liham]], entangling the PCs and leading them to the perils of the assassins' stronghold.''

''Assassin Mountain ''includes:''

''two booklets filled with source material on the holy slayers of [[Zakhara]] and adventures with the [[Everlasting]];''

''six cardsheets;''

''MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM pages detailing new genies and other monsters; and''

''a poster map of [[Sarahin|Jabal Sarahin]], the fortress of the Everlasting.''

''Recommended for use with the ''[[Arabian Adventures]]'' rulebook.''}}
