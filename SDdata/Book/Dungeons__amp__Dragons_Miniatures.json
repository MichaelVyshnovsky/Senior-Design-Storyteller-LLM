        "mainbody": "Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures was a line of pre-painted plastic miniatures that were produced by Wizards of the Coast between 2003 and 2011, with sets releasing roughly every four months. They were produced for the 3.5 and 4 editions of Dungeons & Dragons, as well as Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game, commonly referred to as DDM, and later found reuse in multiple boardgames. Elements of the Forgotten Realms setting featured in a number of the lines sets.\nD&D Miniatures departed from previous miniature lines in that their miniatures were pre-painted, made of plastic, and sold in randomized blind box collectible packs. and later, beginning with Dungeons of Dread, statistics for 4 edition. Early on the side featuring the tabletop statistics also included the concept art sketch for the miniature.\nthumb|273px|A line-up of miniatures of different scales. From left to right Medium, Huge, Small, and Large.\nThe miniatures of each set were divided into three rarities common, uncommon, and rare. Each rarity was denoted by a marking on the bottom of a miniatures base. Those of \"rare\" rarity were given far more attention to detail in their painting than other of lower rarities. In the last major set released for the line, Lords of Madness, a fourth rarity was introduced &ndash very rare.\nFor a short time between 2009 and 2010 sets were marketed under the names \"Monster Manual\" and \"Players Handbook Heroes\". The former were partially blind randomized packs, with a single figure visible, while the latter were non-random and exclusively featured miniatures of the various playable races and character classes. For the last year of the lines lifespan, miniatures would revert to being sold in completely random blind boxes.\nA roleplaying supplement was released in the lines debut year, the Miniatures Handbook, for use with 3.5 edition. This supplement offered further advice on integrating miniatures into the tabletop game, as well as mass combat rules.\nIn June of 2002, Wizards of the Coast announced on their website that they would be ceasing production of their Chainmail Miniatures Game come August and hinted at having a new miniatures game in the works that would utilize the Dungeons & Dragons brand. The replacement to Chainmail would eventually be revealed the next year as the D&D Miniatures line and game, as well as a supplement titled Miniatures Handbook. The D&D Miniatures game would be a simplified & streamlined version of Chainmail, being primarily the work of designers Jonathan Tweet, Rob Heinsoo, and Skaff Elias.\nThe miniature lines first announced entry would be the eighty-miniature set Harbinger, to be released on September 26, followed shortly thereafter by the Miniatures Handbook in October and the expansion Dragoneye in November to coincide with the release of Draconomicon The Book of Dragons. Even in this early stage Wizards announced their intentions to produce creatures from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, as well as other settings like Eberron and Dragonlance. In September, prior to the release of Harbinger, Dragon #311 came out with a Sneak Preview article talking about the new miniatures list and came with a sample challenge for the skirmish game.\nIn an interview with the Miniature Handbooks designers, posted on the Wizards of the Coast website on September 13, Jonathan Tweet stated that the impetus behind the development of both the supplement and the D&D Miniatures line in general was repeated observations that miniatures seemed to be integral to the Dungeons & Dragons experience and they wanted to support players who utilized them.\nIn 2006, the D&D Miniatures line began to strain under increasing costs of manufacturing, eventually leading Wizards of the Coast to make the decision to increase the price of packs.\nIn early 2008 it was announced that all subsequent releases of D&D Miniatures would be designed for use with 4 edition, beginning with the set Dungeons of Dread in April, and that all existing miniatures would receive new stat-cards making them compatible with the new edition. This would be preceded by the set Desert of Desolation in January, which notably featured every monster that was to appear in the upcoming Monster Manual. The D&D Miniatures Game in turn would received revisions to maintain continuity with the new rules.\nLater in October of that same year, Wizards of the Coast announced their decision to change how D&D Miniatures were packaged, now intending to sell sets in packs subtitled Monster Manual and Players Handbook Heroes,\nAt D&D Experience 2010, Wizards of the Coast announced that they would be ceasing the division of sets into Monster Manual and Players Handbook Heroes packs, as well as their decision to revert back to their prior method of packaging miniatures in entirely randomized packs.\nOn January 12, 2011, Wizards of the Coast announced on their official website the immediate end of the D&D Miniatures line, ending with the set Lords of Madness. They clarified their intentions to continue releasing special collectors sets for a time and to repurpose their stock for other products, such as subsequent releases in the D&D Adventure System line, Wrath of Ashardalon and The Legend of Drizzt.\nReleased September 26, 2003.\nReleased December 19, 2003\nReleased March 25, 2004\nReleased June 18, 2004\nReleased October 14, 2004\nReleased March 24, 2005\nReleased July 21, 2005\nReleased November 3, 2005\nReleased March 3, 2006\nReleased July 7, 2006\nReleased November 6, 2006\nReleased March 5, 2007\nReleased July 6, 2007\nReleased October 26, 2007\nReleased March 28, 2008\nReleased July 12, 2008\nReleased November 7, 2008\nReleased May 19, 2009\nReleased August 18, 2009\nReleased November 17, 2009\nReleased September 21, 2010\nCanceled\nReleased November 16, 2010.\nReleased November 2011\nReleased August 2006.\nReleased September 2006.\nReleased January 2007.\nReleased 2010.\nReleased September 2007.\nThis series consisted of twelve booster packs of non-random miniatures, all sculpted by Peter Lee, three a piece in transparent packaging along with an accompanying power card.
