{{quote|''Seek no morrow, but make war ready; heed what I darkly warn, for you face blood, sorrow, fell treachery, and dread [[Spellstorm (spell)|spellstorm]].''|Excerpt from ''A Dark Day for Cormyr''}}

==History==
The work was published in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}. Its flowery musings and warnings eerily foreshadowed the events that took place a century later, when the mythical ''[[Lost Spell]]'' was unearthed in [[Cormyr]] in the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, unleashing a magical ''spellstorm.''
