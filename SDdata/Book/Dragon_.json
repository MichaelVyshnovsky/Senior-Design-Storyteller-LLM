Rather than bringing the magazine out of hiatus, Wizards began to develop a platform that would both collate all of its social media content and also deliver a free bi-monthly collection of content in a similar vein to that which was found in the old magazines.\nDragon+ contains interviews, spotlights on Dungeons & Dragons multimedia articles on classic D&D products official rules clarifications fiction lore humor and more."
