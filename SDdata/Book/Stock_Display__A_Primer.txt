'''''Stock Display: A Primer''''' was a manual [[book]] for shopkeeps that helped them how to display their goods most appealingly and effectively, published in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
''Stock Display: A Primer'' was an extensive tome that listed in full detail how each type of merchandise could be presented in a way that boosted the establishment's sales. The book included a section dedicated exclusively to displaying jewelry. Some steps in handling such glittering merchandise included spacing the pieces not to crown the customer's eye and presenting jewelry in the light to make sure it shone the brightest. Lastly, grouping things that went together, for example, [[ruby]] [[ring]]s complemented ruby necklaces and together, they looked especially desirable.

==History==
A copy of [[Sana Aeran]]'s primer belonged to [[Omotola]], a jewelry and gem merchant from [[The Glitter Gala]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
