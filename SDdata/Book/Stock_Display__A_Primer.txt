Stock Display A Primer was a manual book for shopkeeps that helped them how to display their goods most appealingly and effectively, published in or before the late 15 century DR.
Stock Display A Primer was an extensive tome that listed in full detail how each type of merchandise could be presented in a way that boosted the establishments sales. The book included a section dedicated exclusively to displaying jewelry. Some steps in handling such glittering merchandise included spacing the pieces not to crown the customers eye and presenting jewelry in the light to make sure it shone the brightest. Lastly, grouping things that went together, for example, ruby rings complemented ruby necklaces and together, they looked especially desirable.
A copy of Sana Aerans primer belonged to Omotola, a jewelry and gem merchant from The Glitter Gala in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
