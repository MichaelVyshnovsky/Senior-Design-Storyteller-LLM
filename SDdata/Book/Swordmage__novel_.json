        "Summary": "Around 1445 DR, Geran Hulmaster was born into\nthe ruling family of Hulburg, a small city on the northeastern shore of the\nMoonsea. Geran’s uncle, [[Grigor Hulmaster]], was the Harmach (Lord) of Hulburg,\nand his closest friend growing up was [[Jarad Erstenwold]]. Geran and Jarad had numerous minor adventures in Hulburg and\nin the wilderness that surrounded the town, and they were often joined by Jarad’s\nyounger sister, [[Mirya Erstenhold|Mirya]], and Geran’s cousin [[Kara Hulmaster]]. Over the years, Geran\nand Mirya became each other’s first loves, but Geran was anxious to explore\nother parts of the world and he broke Mirya’s heart when he left Hulburg at the\nage of twenty. Geran studied in the nearby city of [[Thentia]], and he then traveled\nto train with the swordmasters in the port city of [[Procampur]]. Geran later joined\nan adventuring band called the [[Company of the Dragon Shield]], and the group won a\nsmall fortune before they went their separate ways. Geran and his comrade [[Hamil Alderheart]], a ghostwise halfling,\nbought owners’ shares of the [[Red Sail Coster]], a small trading company in\nthe port city of [[Tantras]] that bought and sold various cargoes in [[the Vast]]. \n\nIn 1473 DR, Geran left his position with the Red\nSails and made his way to the elven city of [[Myth Drannor]], where he studied sword\nmagic under the tutelage of the sun elf [[bladesinger]], [[Daried Selsherryn]]. Geran\nbecame a skilled swordmage and earned himself a position in the service of\n[[Ilsevele Miritar]], the ruler of Myth Drannor, and he even fell in love with the\nmoon elf maiden [[Alliere]]. However, this all changed in 1477 DR, when Geran fought\nthe moon elf mage [[Rhovann Disarnnyl]], his rival for the love\nof Alliere, in a tournament between the defenders of Myth Drannor. The contest quickly\nescalated into a brutal duel that ended when Geran cut off Rhovann’s hand, which\nnot only shocked and horrified him, but also lost him the love of Alliere and\nresulted in his banishment from the elven city. Haunted by his memories of Myth\nDrannor, Geran returned to his old position with the Red Sails in Tantras. \n\nIn 1479 DR, Geran, accompanied by Hamil,\nreturned to Hulburg for the first time in ten years after learning that Jarad\nhad been murdered. Unlike Geran, Jarad had remained in Hulburg for the previous\ndecade, and he had become the captain of the [[Shieldsworn]], the harmach’s guards.\nJarad had served as the Shieldsworn’s leader until his death while investigating\na series of crypt-breaking in the barrowfields outside of the town. Tomb-breaking\nwas one of the most serious crimes in Hulburg due to [[Aesperus]], also known as\nthe King in Copper, a fearsome necromancer who had ruled over the northern Moonsea\nregion hundreds of years earlier and was now a lich who commanded the undead of\nthe barrowfields as his slaves.\n\nWhen Geran returned to his birthplace, he\nquickly learned about the many considerable changes that had occurred in\nHulburg since his departure. Several years earlier, [[Sergen Hulmaster]], Kara’s ambitious stepbrother,\nhad convinced Grigor to sell out trade concessions for logging and mining in\nthe family’s lands, since demands were very high in the nearby Moonsea cities.\nThe powerful [[House Veruna]] of Mulmaster, [[House Jannarsk]] of Phlan, and the other\nmerchant companies that moved into Hulburg formed a Merchant Council, and\nSergen was named the harmach’s representative on the new committee. Although\nSergen acted like a loyal member of his adopted family, in truth he hated the\nHulmasters and wanted vengeance for his father, [[Kamoth Kastelmar]], a minor noble\nfrom the city of Hillsfar who had married Grigor’s sister but had been driven\nout of Hulburg years earlier after a failed attempt to seize power. With the\nability to control all aspects of the trade concessions, the treacherous Sergen\nwas the unofficial master of the Merchant Council and made himself massive amounts\nof wealth, while Grigor barely made any at all. Another result of the trading\ncompanies moving to Hulburg was that the population of the town significantly\nincreased due to the large number of laborers and other foreign workers who had\naccompanied the merchants. The Merchant Council hired mercenaries to help\npolice the town in the form of the Council Watch, but this new force, assisted\nby the soldiers of House Veruna, focused more on enforcing Council edicts and\nextorting native-born residents of Hulburg than maintaining justice and order. Since\nthe Shieldsworn numbered only one hundred ninety warriors, they barely had\nenough troops to patrol the town’s borders and garrison the ancestral castle of\nthe Hulmasters, [[Griffonwatch Keep]]. The weakened strength of the harmach’s\nguards resulted in them being replaced by the mercenaries when it came to\nenforcing law in Hulburg itself, and the Shieldsworn were only allowed to deal\nwith serious crimes such as murder. \n\nGeran viewed these changes as not truly in the\nbest interests of the people of Hulburg, and he hated the idea that Sergen had\nallowed the foreign merchants to gain such significant power in the town. Geran\nsoon made himself an enemy of the Merchant Council after a confrontation with\nthree armsmen of House Veruna who were trying to extort and intimidate Mirya in\nthe provisions store that she owned. This was the first time that Geran had\nseen Mirya in ten years, and he was surprised to discover that she had a young\ndaughter named [[Selsha Erstenhold|Selsha]], but his old lover was still unmarried and she refused to\nspeak of the father. Geran’s actions prompted Sergen and [[Darsi Veruna]], the head\nof the House Veruna holdings in the town, to discuss the problems that the\nswordmage could cause in their secret plans for Hulburg, in which Sergen would soon\nbe the new harmach and House Veruna would become the most powerful merchant\ncompany in the Moonsea. The two leaders decided that direct action against\nGeran would be too suspicious, but they agreed it would be in their best\ninterest to spy on his movements, a task that was given to Darsi’s pet, the\nspectral panther [[Umbryl]]. \n\nMeanwhile, in the moorlands of [[Thar]], [[Kardhel Terov]], a [[fellthane]] of the [[Warlock Knights]] of Vaasa, approached [[Mhurren]], the warlord of the [[Bloody Skulls]]\n[[orc]] tribe. Terov offered Mhurren complete\ncontrol over Thar in exchange for an oath\nof fealty and an agreement not to endanger cities that would be put under the\nfellthane’s protection. Terov wanted to have a protected trade route from Vaasa\nto the Moonsea, and he gained Mhurren\nthe loyalty of several other Tharran tribes, including the\n[[ogre]]s of the [[Skullsmashers]] and the [[hobgoblins]] of the [[Red Claws]]. Terov also provided\nMhurren with arms and armaments, and he bolstered the orc leader’s army with\nten Warlock Knights as well as a number of strong monsters from the high\nmountains, such as manticores and wyverns, that were under their control. With these\npowerful forces now under his command, Mhurren led them in an attack on the\nsmall mining town of [[Glister]], the only settlement of humans and dwarves in Thar,\nwhich easily fell to his troops. After the conquest of Glister, Mhurren\nprepared his army to march south on Hulburg, but Terov had plans for the\ncoastal town and ordered the orc warlord to only destroy it if the harmach\nrefused to accede to demands of tribute. \n\nDetermined to uncover the mysteries surrounding\nthe crypt-breaking and Jarad’s death, Geran and Hamil began to investigate the\ntombs that had been broken into and soon discovered clues incriminating the\nmercenaries of House Veruna. The pair also realized that the only burial mounds\nbeing entered were those belonging to priests of [[Lathander]], the god of the\ndawn, and all of them seemed to have been built during the same time period\nseveral centuries earlier. After this discovery, Geran and Hamil traveled to\nthe nearby [[Rosestone Abbey]], home to a small group of monks dedicated to [[Amaunator]],\nthe god of the sun. Their leader, Initiate Mother [[Mara (Amaunatori)|Mara]], revealed to the two companions\nthat the Veruna mercenaries had to be looking for the ''[[Infiernadex]]'', a book of dark spells and rites that had belonged to\nAesperus before his downfall centuries earlier. Mara explained that since the\npriests of Lathander had been the chief agents of the necromancer’s defeat, the\n''Infiernadex'' had been entombed with\ntheir leader, the High Morninglady [[Terlannis]], and powerful wards had been\nplaced over the book to guard it from evil individuals. \n\nFollowing Mara’s instructions, Geran and Hamil\nlocated the tomb of Terlannis and retrieved the'' Infiernadex ''after overcoming the magical traps that protected it.\nUpon leaving the burial mound, the friends were ambushed by soldiers of House\nVeruna led by their captain, [[Anfel Urdinger]], who demanded that the pair\nsurrender the book. Geran and Hamil threatened to destroy the ''Infiernadex ''unless they were allowed to\ngo free, but Aesperus then appeared and used his magic to reclaim the book. Aesperus\ndeclared that Darsi and House Veruna had upheld their end of the bargain by\nreturning the ''Infiernadex ''to him, and\nhe gave Urdinger an amulet that would allow the wielder to control the lich’s\nundead servants for a short time. After Aesperus departed, a vicious fight\nerupted between the two companions and the mercenaries. However, the Veruna\narmsmen significantly outnumbered Geran and Hamil, and it seemed that the\npair’s deaths would be inevitable, until the arrival of [[Sarth Khul Riizar]], a\n[[tiefling]] [[sorcerer]] who had been searching for the ''Infiernadex ''to study the arcane knowledge that it contained. With the\nunexpected assistance of Sarth, Geran and Hamil defeated many of the Veruna\ntroops while Urdinger and the remainder fled. Angry that Geran and Hamil had allowed\nAesperus to reclaim the ''Infiernadex'',\nSarth used his magic to depart from the tomb of Terlannis, leaving the two\nfriends with a long journey back to Hulburg. \n\nWhile that was occurring in the moorlands, an\nemissary party of Bloody Skull orcs arrived in Hulburg to demand that Grigor pay\ntribute to Mhurren. Grigor and the Harmach’s Council knew that Hulburg’s armed\nforces might not be able to defeat Mhurren’s army, but they refused to accept\nthe outrageous demands and decided to stall for time in the hope that the\nchaotic tendencies of the Thar tribes would end the threat. Meanwhile, Sergen\nhired the [[Icehammer Company]], a mercenary force that consisted of nearly two\nhundred fifty experienced human and dwarven soldiers, to be his own clandestine\narmy. Sergen also had Umbryl secretly kill the orc emissaries and bring their\nheads to Bloodskull Keep in order to ignite a war between Thar and Hulburg. Sergen\nbelieved that the menace posed by Mhurren’s horde would be the perfect\nopportunity to implement his plan to kill the true Hulmasters. After Geran’s\nactions against House Veruna, Sergen and Darsi agreed that it was time to\nneutralize the threat that he had become, but instead of directly moving\nagainst him, they decided to provoke him into starting a fight with Veruna and\nthe Merchant Council by harassing Mirya, who was the one person he would do\nanything to protect. \n\nWhen Geran and Hamil returned to Hulburg a\ncouple of days later, they reported all that had happened in the moorlands to\nGrigor, Sergen, and Kara, who had become a skilled [[ranger]] and was the interim\nleader of the Shieldsworn. Even with Sergen defending House Veruna and accusing\nGeran of lying, Grigor believed the swordmage’s story. However, the harmach\ncould not directly act against the merchant company because of the laws of\nconcession, which stated that all matters of justice pertaining to the companies\nbe dealt with by the Merchant Council. Grigor ordered Sergen to bring these\ncharges before the Council and have them impartially investigated, but Geran\nheld no faith in his step-cousin and expected that he was allied with House\nVeruna. When Geran visited Mirya later that day, he discovered a group of Veruna\narmsmen threatening her and ransacking her store. After using his swordsmanship\nand magic to defeat and drive off the mercenaries, Geran faced Urdinger in single\ncombat on the streets of Hulburg and killed the Veruna captain. \n\nThe next morning, Sergen approached Grigor to\npresent a demand from House Veruna and the Merchant Council for Geran’s\nimmediate arrest for murder, but the harmach refused to allow this because\nUrdinger’s death was the result of a fair duel. Wanting a force capable of\ndefending the native-born townspeople from the foreign mercenaries, Geran decided\nto assemble the Spearmeet, the militia of Hulburg. While in the process of\ngathering the militia and its captains, Geran and Hamil were ambushed by the\nIcehammers, and the swordmage was arrested on Sergen’s orders. While Geran\nendured days of imprisonment in Council Hall, his family persistently tried to\nsecure his release, but House Veruna and the Merchant Council refused, since\nthey were determined to put Geran on trial, a right that they did not lawfully have.\nAs the ruling powers of Hulburg continued to dispute over Geran, Hamil organized\nthe militia, and armed groups of townspeople began patrolling the streets. \n\nWhile hostility between the native-born\nHulburgans and foreigners escalated, word from the outer watchtowers arrived in\ntown warning of the approach of Mhurren and his monstrous army. Faced with such\na serious threat, Grigor and the Harmach’s Council had nearly all of the\nexperienced armed forces in Hulburg assembled into an army that could actually\nstand a chance of defeating Mhurren’s horde. Overall command of this combined\nforce of Shieldsworn, Icehammers, and mercenaries hired by the merchant\ncompanies was given to Kara, who hastily led the army to meet the Thar tribes\nat a defensible position northwest of the town. \n\nMeanwhile, Sergen prepared to soon enact his plan\nto become the new lord of Hulburg and made a bargain with Grigor in which Geran\nwould face charges under the harmach’s law. In exchange, the Merchant Council\nagreed to allow the swordmage to be imprisoned in Griffonwatch Keep until a\ntrial could be arranged, but a detachment of the Council Watch would remain in\nthe castle to guard him. During a visit by Sergen shortly after being\ntransported to the keep, Geran observed that his hated step-cousin was wearing\nthe amulet Aesperus had given to Urdinger. Geran realized that Sergen planned\non using its powers over the undead to destroy the Hulmaster family and become\nthe new harmach. Determined to stop Sergen, Geran secretly contacted Hamil, and\nthe halfling, with the aid of Mirya and Sarth, orchestrated his friend’s escape\nthat night. Geran was surprised that Sarth was helping him gain his freedom, but\nhe then learned that the tiefling felt guilty about being the one who had\noriginally informed Darsi about the'' Infiernadex\n''and that he wished to make amends by helping thwart Sergen’s plans.\nHowever, Sergen chose that moment to strike Griffonwatch Keep, and the four\ncompanions soon found themselves in a desperate fight against spectral wraiths.\n\n        At the same time that the undead were attacking\nGriffonwatch Keep, the nine hundred warriors who constituted the army of\nHulburg confronted Mhurren and his horde, which numbered in the thousands.\nWhile Mhurren led his orc and ogre forces in a ferocious direct assault against\nthe defensive position held by the humans and dwarves, the worg-riding\nhobgoblins of the Red Claws attacked the Hulburgan army’s vulnerable right\nflank. Faced with a relentless assault from two sides, the forces of Hulburg\nwere pushed back, and the soldiers hired by the merchant companies soon broke\nand retreated from the field, only to be preyed on by the flying monsters\ncontrolled by the Vaasans. Realizing that the battle was lost, Kara ordered the\nbattered Hulburgan army to withdraw while she personally led a small force of\nShieldsworn cavalry against the Tharran warriors to cover the retreat. After\nsuccessfully delaying the Tharran horde’s advance for the short time that the\narmy of Hulburg needed to escape from the field, Kara and her surviving\nhorsemen joined their comrades in retreating toward the town while Mhurren’s\nvictorious forces closely pursued them.\n\nAs the [[wraith|wraiths]] massacred the servants, guards,\nand other inhabitants of Griffonwatch Keep, Geran and his friends fought their\nway through the castle to find Grigor and the other Hulmasters. After rescuing\nhis family from the spectral warriors, Geran decided that their best option would\nbe to escape through the small postern gate on the side of the keep. However,\nwhen the group reached the gate, they discovered that Sergen and a dozen Veruna\nmercenaries were waiting to ambush anyone attempting to escape from the castle.\nGeran, Hamil, and Sarth defeated or drove off the armsmen, but the halfling was\nseriously injured during the fight, and Sergen escaped after being wounded by\nGeran. With Sergen and his Veruna allies still a major threat to the\nHulmasters, Geran and Grigor immediately ordered all of the Spearmeet companies\nto muster and be prepared for battle against the Merchant Council’s soldiers.      \n\nHowever, at that time, a messenger from\nKara arrived and informed Grigor that the Bloody Skulls and their allies had\noverwhelmed the army of Hulburg and that Kara’s forces were retreating toward\nthe town while fighting to slow the Tharran horde’s advance. Kara warned that Mhurren’s\nforces would reach Hulburg sometime before sunrise and recommended that all of the\ntownspeople should seek refuge in any fortified buildings available. Instead of\nheeding Kara’s advice and allowing the town to be sacked, Grigor and the people\nof Hulburg decided to follow Geran’s suggestion of making a final stand against\nthe Tharran army at Lendon’s Dike, the last\ndefensible position between the approaching horde and the town itself.\n\nLed by Geran and Grigor, a mostly\nuntrained force of eight hundred militia members and other Hulburgan volunteers\nassembled at Lendon’s Dike. The makeshift army was soon joined by the six\nhundred exhausted soldiers who were all that remained of Kara’s forces after\nthe long night of fighting. Even with all of the defenders of Hulburg combining\ntheir strength, they were still outnumbered by a margin of over two to one by\nMhurren’s horde. The initial assault by the Tharran troops nearly shattered the\nHulburgan army’s defensive line, but the attackers were eventually pushed back.\nAs the Bloody Skulls and their allies prepared for a second strike, Sergen\nsummoned skeletal soldiers to assail the forces loyal to the Hulmasters and murder\nhis adopted family. Geran stopped Sergen and prevented the annihilation of the already\nbattered army by stealing the magical amulet that his step-cousin was using to\ncontrol the undead. Geran then used the gift from Aesperus to turn the skeletal\nwarriors on Mhurren’s forces, but when the sun rose, the amulet crumbled and\nthe undead disappeared, giving the Tharran horde another opportunity to attack\nthe Hulburgans. His plans to seize power ruined, Sergen then retreated from the\nbattle with all of the soldiers of House Veruna. Although the remaining\ndefenders fought valiantly against the brutal onslaught of the Thar tribes, it\nseemed that they would be overrun until Mhurren was killed by Kara and Geran.\nThe warlord’s death immediately caused his forces to retreat from the field,\nand the Tharran army swiftly fell apart as feuds for control began to erupt\nbetween the Bloody Skulls and their allies.\n\nDue to House Veruna’s actions in\ndealing with Aesperus and abandoning the field during the battle at Lendon’s Dike, Grigor revoked\nthe trading company’s concessions and banned them from Hulburg, a promulgation\nthat the Merchant Council chose not to protest. As a result, Darsi and Sergen,\nalong with the Veruna armsmen and all of the other members of the company, were\nforced to flee the town when it became obvious that they would be burned out of\ntheir fortified compound by a Hulburgan mob if they remained any longer. After\nrecovering for a few weeks from the serious injuries he had sustained, Hamil\nreturned to Tantras to organize the establishment of a Red Sails concession in\nHulburg, as Grigor had promised the halfling’s company the best of the Veruna\ndocks and storehouses. Since the forbidden Myth Drannor still called to Geran’s\nheart, the swordmage decided to remain in his birthplace for a time. \n\nThe relationship between Sergen and\nDarsi was severely damaged after House Veruna was forced to abandon its\nextensive investments and properties in Hulburg. Since the merchant company’s\nloss was due in large part to Sergen’s failure to seize power, the exiled\nHulmaster decided to leave Mulmaster and move to the nearby city of Melvaunt.\nSoon after his arrival, Sergen was visited by Rhovann, who proposed that they work\ntogether to destroy their common enemy, Geran."
