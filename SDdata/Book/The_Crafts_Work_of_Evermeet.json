Only trained crafters of wondrous items could study and replicates these advanced formulae. Some of the recipes in the book included one for ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]'' that called for an ''essence of [[Elemental Plane of Water|water]]'', two quality [[leather]] hides, a [[fire opal]], and a casting of the ''[[invisibility]]'' spell. A recipe for ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'' called for the same ingredients but with the spells of ''[[silence]]'' used instead. A ''[[belt of agility]]'' could be enchanted using an ''essence of [[Elemental Plane of Air|air]]'', a [[diamond]], and the spell of ''[[cat's grace]]''. Lastly, a ''[[ring of wizardry]]'' found in the ''Crafts'' called for an ingot of [[iron]], ''air essence'', a piece of [[obsidian]], and the spell of ''[[fox's cunning]]''.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a copy of ''The Crafts Work of Evermeet'' belonged to a merchant and [[wizard]] [[Tarmas]] from the hamlet of [[West Harbor]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]]."
