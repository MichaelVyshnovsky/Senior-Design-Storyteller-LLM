Illefarn was a book written in a narrative poem style and was a stylized retelling of Illefarns history.
The poem of Illefarn narrated the fabled story of the ancient land. It started with placing Illefarn bordering elven lands and being well-protected. The dwarven residents of Illefarn welcomed their elven neighbors into the alliance, with humans following at a later date, bringing their agricultural and farming resources. After the years of fruitful co-existence, Illefarn lands fell in the orc horde attack from the north. Since then, the lands of Illefarn have been nothing but ruins and fables with their stories passed along the generations of surviving dwarves. This poem was known to inspire younger generations to uncover the ancient dwarven mines of Illefarn and return them to the prior greatness.
In late 14 century DR the Illefarn poem could be found in various locations, most notably, inside the Daggerfords library of Sorcellers Encapsulate.
