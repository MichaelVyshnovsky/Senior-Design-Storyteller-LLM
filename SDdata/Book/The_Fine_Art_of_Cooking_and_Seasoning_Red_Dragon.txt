'''''The Fine Art of Cooking and Seasoning Red Dragon''''' was a cookbook considered ancient as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. As the name suggested, it revolved around the culinary uses of [[red dragon]]s.

''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], the [[halfling]] traveler [[Brac Bristletoes]] came into possession of a copy and was interested enough in its dishes to look for an [[adventuring company]] who could help him collect its primary ingredient.
