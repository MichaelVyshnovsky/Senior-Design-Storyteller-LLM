        "mainbody": "The untitled [[book]] that had the tentative name '''''Love in Shadowed Lands''''' was a romance novel and the second volume of four, all unpublished drafts penned by the amateur novelist [[Roan Featherway]] in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "It was a neatly penned collection of several [[glue]]d-together journals, pieces of paper, and even one mail envelope. The makeshift cover had only one crossed-out title written on it.",
        "Contents": "This volume continued the story of the mighty [[druid]] Roa. In this volume, Roa flirted with a raven-haired [[Harper]] woman. He approached her, beaming and winking. She shared with the mountainous druid that the ''[[Harper pin]]'' was only worn in the open during special occasions. To Roa's surprise, the [[Emerald Grove]] teemed with many Harpers. The cloak-and-dagger group ventured into the Grove to join the [[Silvanite]]s' struggle against the local tyrant [[Ketheric Thorm]], his [[Dark Justiciars]], and if they were lucky, the goddess [[Shar]] herself. The Harper and the druid flirted and exchanged questions about the situation whilst preparing for war.",
        "History": "Roan Featherway was himself a druid of [[Silvanus]] and his work was heavily inspired by the events of the war between General Ketheric Thorm and the joint forces of [[Harpers]] and the Emerald Enclave that took place in the late 14{{th}} century DR. The draft novel's characters included the real druid of the Emerald Grove, [[Halsin]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, it remained unknown whether ''Love in Shadowed Lands'' was ever published, just like the rest of the drafts in the series. The makeshift book that held the draft was stored in the home of [[Lavernica]], the druid groundskeeper of [[Bloomridge Park]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in 1492 DR."
