        "mainbody": "The untitled book that had the tentative name Love in Shadowed Lands was a romance novel and the second volume of four, all unpublished drafts penned by the amateur novelist Roan Featherway in or before the late 15 century DR.\nIt was a neatly penned collection of several glued-together journals, pieces of paper, and even one mail envelope. The makeshift cover had only one crossed-out title written on it.\nThis volume continued the story of the mighty druid Roa. In this volume, Roa flirted with a raven-haired Harper woman. He approached her, beaming and winking. She shared with the mountainous druid that the Harper pin was only worn in the open during special occasions. To Roas surprise, the Emerald Grove teemed with many Harpers. The cloak-and-dagger group ventured into the Grove to join the Silvanites struggle against the local tyrant Ketheric Thorm, his Dark Justiciars, and if they were lucky, the goddess Shar herself. The Harper and the druid flirted and exchanged questions about the situation whilst preparing for war.\nRoan Featherway was himself a druid of Silvanus and his work was heavily inspired by the events of the war between General Ketheric Thorm and the joint forces of Harpers and the Emerald Enclave that took place in the late 14 century DR. The draft novels characters included the real druid of the Emerald Grove, Halsin. As of the , it remained unknown whether Love in Shadowed Lands was ever published, just like the rest of the drafts in the series. The makeshift book that held the draft was stored in the home of Lavernica, the druid groundskeeper of Bloomridge Park of Baldurs Gate in 1492 DR."
