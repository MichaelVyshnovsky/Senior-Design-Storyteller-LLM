        "Summary": "In the first part of the book, we learn that [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Catti-brie]] have joined the crew of Captain [[Deudermont]] on board the [[Sea Sprite]] and have been hunting pirates for the six years after the [[Battle of Mithral Hall]]. Now a [[doppelganger]] takes Deudermont shape and it isn't unmasked before it hints to a mysterious island. Deudermont decides to look for the island to find out who sent the creature. We know that that is the [[demon]] [[Errtu]], who needs Drizzt to break his banishment. We also learn that now [[Mithral Hall]] is reigned by [[Gandalug Battlehammer]], and that [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], some of his dwarves and the barbarians from [[Settlestone]] led by [[Berkthgar|Berkthgar the Bold]] have moved back in [[Icewind Dale]].\n\nIn the second part of the book the Sea Sprite crew goes to [[Mintarn]] in search of information about the mysterious [[Caerwich]]. They are attacked by pirates, but they manage to escape also because of the magical arrival of [[Harkle Harpell]], who joins the crew. After a long and perilous journey, the Sea Sprite reaches Caerwich. There more dangers await the companions, but they eventually find an old hag who gives a riddle message to Drizzt and Catti-brie. The drow believes that the message implies that his father is alive and held by [[Lolth]]. The companions decide to look for more information from a fiend of the [[Abyss]], contacting it through a priest. On the journey back, the Sea Sprite is nearly destroyed by a storm and is saved by Harkle, whose spell magically transports the damaged schooner in [[Impresk Lake]], near the residence of the priest [[Cadderly Bonaduce]].\n\nIn the third part of the book Harkle Harpell, through a powerful spell, reveals information about the nature of the foe to Drizzt at the cost of his memories of the present adventure with the companions. With the aid of Cadderly, summoning an [[imp]] from the Abyss, the companions have confirmation that their foe is not Lolth but Errtu. Drizzt and Catti-brie have Cadderly to summon the demon to confront it, but it doesn't reveal who its prisoner is and claims to be now free from the banishment. The drow and the girl decide to go to [[Icewind Dale]] where [[Crenshinibon]] lies, the place where Errtu will more likely show up. In the meantime the crystal shard itself is found and taken by [[Stumpet Rakingclaw]].\n\nIn the fourth part of the book Drizzt and Catti-brie return to Icewind Dale and meet their friends [[Regis]] and Bruenor. The companions spend some pleasant time there before revealing the reason of their return. In the meantime Berkthgar challenges [[Revjak]] and becomes the new leader of the barbarians of Icewind Dale, dangerously turning against [[Ten-Towns]] and the dwarves. Drizzt becomes aware of this. Finally Errtu is summoned by a wizard, but he breaks free and flies to Icewind Dale where he takes Crenshinibon from Stumpet, capturing her soul and using her body as a bait to lure Drizzt to him. He raises [[Cryshal-Tirith]] and begins to gather creatures. We also learn that the [[balor]] has to fight a battle of wills against Crenshinibon to keep control over the artifact.\n\nIn the last part of the book, Stumpet's body leads the companions to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. There they are attacked by [[Taer]]s sent by Crenshinibon, and they beat the creatures only because of the arrival of Revjak and his warriors. Berkthgar and his men, who were also following the companions, arrive as well and eventually the heroes can make the barbarian realise his mistakes. The companions then proceed to their quest and they eventually reach Cryshal-Tirith, where battle with Errtu's minions ensues. Regis infiltrates the tower and, with cunning and willpower, he manages to lock Crenshinibon in a box from where its power can't escape. In the meantime the others are saved by the arrival of [[Kierstaad]], son of Revjak, wielding [[Aegis-fang]], taken from Bruenor's quarters. Errtu's prisoner, [[Wulfgar]], can break free and joins battle with his warhammer. The companions can eventually defeat Errtu.\n\nThe book ends with the companions reunited planning to bring Crenshinibon to Cadderly, looking for a way to destroy the evil artifact.",
