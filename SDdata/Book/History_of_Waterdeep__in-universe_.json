It shared with the reader details about life in the [[Savage Frontier]] and the [[Sword Coast North]], in the era before the earliest settlement was established at [[Deepwater Harbor]].\n\nIn the spring and autumn months, passing traders docked within the harbor to trade with hunters and crafters from local tribes. Timber was gathered at each of these trademoots, so the seaborn merchants could repair their vessels and return next season.",

As a burgeoning community grew from the bi-annual trademoots, Nimoar raised the first wooden palisades to ensure its protection. The growing settlement  came to be known as \"Nimoar's Hold, the Town of Waters Deep.\"\n\nAfter Nimoar's Hold successfully weathered a few failed attacks by pirates and nearby raiding tribes, it faced its first truly great challenge. Conflicts between [[elves]] and [[orc]]s north of Nimoar's Hold displaced large populations of [[troll]]s, that settled in the nearby [[Evermoors]]. After Nimoar's passing, the settlement that bore his came to be known only as 'Waterdeep'. The city's warlords rallied together to fight off hordes of trolls in a decade-long series of conflicts known as the [[Trollwars]]. These battles ended following the emergence of a skilled young mage named [[Ahghairon]], who turned the tide of war in Waterdeep's favor.",

Raurlor attempted to imprison Ahghairon for his public impudence, and even struck out at the old mage with his sword, but was ultimately stopped and slain by Ahghairon's magic.\n\nAhghairon called upon the heads most prominent Waterdhavian families and founded a new [[Lords of Waterdeep|governing body]], one that he served in publicly, while others were granted anonymity. Waterdeep thrived under the rule of Ahghairon and the 'Masked Lords'. The city's walls were expanded outwards twice over and the influential [[Council of Guildmasters]] was founded, to help manage the increasing amount of wealth that flowed in and out of the city.",

Many of the Lords had actually been slain by guild agents, in preparation for the council's emergence. Unfortunately for Waterdeep's citizens, the guild masters fell to vicious in-fighting, as each member openyl assaulted and even murdered their competitors. When so many of the guilds' leaders had all but wiped each other out, the council's two remaining members took the \"throne\" of Waterdeep for themselves, as the two Lords Magister.",

The Lords Magister were killed in short order. Baeron declared he would take on the role of Open Lord, as Ahghairon was before him, and Shilarn—who remained masked—would recruit from among the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|city's nobility]] to restore the ranks of the Masked Lords."
