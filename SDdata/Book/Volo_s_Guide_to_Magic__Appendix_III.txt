Volos Guide to Magic, Appendix III was an addendum to a book about magic penned by famed, or according to some, infamous, author Volothamp Geddarm sometime before 1374 DR.
Volos Appendix III was less of a scholarly work and more of a collection of stories and personal opinions of the author on the subject of enchanted items and those who relied on them. Volo talked about finer details that differentiated living and dead adventurers and reminded them to always be prepared to face dangerous monsters.
One of the lessons in the guide came in the form of a story of Sir Meredith who relied on his magical blade, Reapers Edge. The knights love for his weapon was so great that he tucked it underneath his pillow at night, always ready to defend himself. Sir Merediths death came at the claws of werewolves, when he thought his magical blade enough to stop the monsters. Lycanthropes of the Moonwood remained unharmed by Merediths Reapers Edge, and the knight was torn to pieces. The lesson of the story was not to rely on a single magic item and always carry weapons appropriate for slaying powerful foes, such as silver for lycanthropes and vampires, adamantine for constructs.
As of the , copies of Volos Guide to Magic, Appendix III could be found across libraries and stores of the Sword Coast. These pages had been ripped from the larger body of work for some reason.
