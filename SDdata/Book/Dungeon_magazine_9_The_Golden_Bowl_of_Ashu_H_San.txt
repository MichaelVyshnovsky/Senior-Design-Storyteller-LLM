"The Glass House" is an Oriental Adventures module for Dungeons & Dragons 1 edition, published in Dungeon #9, that takes place somewhere in the land of Kozakura.It is never stated in the adventure which nation the events are taking place in. However, the adventure uses some Japanese terms stated in Swords of the Daimyo to be specific to the Kozakuran language. In particular, hyakusho, a term for peasants, is apparently unique to Kozakura. Therefore, for convenience, this wiki presumes it is set in Kozakura.
