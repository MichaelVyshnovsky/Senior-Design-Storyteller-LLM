        "mainbody": "Manuals of bodily health were rare and highly sought-after enchanted books that held a cornucopia of valuable information on medicine with its words entwined with powerful magics that could improve the readers constitution.\nBound in metal, manuals of bodily health often were extremely thick and heavy tomes that cold weigh from  to . The copious pages inside the binding were filled with invaluable information on preventative medicine, first aid, and muscle toning.\nApart from being a trove of knowledge, a typical manual of bodily health could be used to magically imbue the reader with its knowledge that boosted their constitution permanently. In order to tap into this powerful magic, a reeder needed to spend up to forty eight hours over six days, studying the tome. However upon utilizing that power, the book itself disintegrated, or became an ordinary book.\nthumb|An open manual of bodily health.|260x300px\nManuals of bodily health could be created with several power levels that enchanted the readers constitution accordingly. An experienced crafter of wondrous items could create one of these manuals using the wish or miracle spell.\nIn the days of pre-Weeping War Myth Drannor, the monks of the abbey of Deneir created a masterwork manual of bodily health. The enchanted book was placed in a lockbox of the abbeys chapel. The box remained unopened past the destruction of the City of Song and the book was still there in the early-to-mid-14 century DR.\nIn 1340 DR, one of these magic books could be found within Mantors Library, of old Phlan. The book belonged to the librarys former master who was a health nut.\nIn 1357 DR, another manuals of bodily health surfaced, hidden in a shrine of Mask in the sewers of Tilverton and not far from the citys thieves guild lair.\n*Black Alaric, the infamous pirate, or to be more precise one of the pirates who used the name, stashed one of the manuals of bodily health inside a cave across the cove from the Seawatcher, guarded by flesh golems.\n*The \"Old Mother Wyrm\" Ghaulantatra had a manual of bodily health in her dragon hoard circa 1374 DR.\n* The book-obsessed lich Adzerak kept a manual inside his lair of Barrenstone.\n* A manual was hidden inside the accounting room of Castle Ravenloft in Barovia, one of the Domains of Dread.\nInhabitants of Skullport claimed that Halaster Blackcloak hid a library filled with fake books labeled as manuals of bodily health, librams of gainful conjuration, and Elminsters Black Book that hid hungry palimpsests inside, ready to devour anyone foolish enough to grab the tomes. This library was created as a joke by Halaster."
