        "mainbody": "'''''Manuals of bodily health''''' were rare and highly sought-after enchanted [[book]]s that held a cornucopia of valuable information on medicine with its words entwined with powerful magics that could improve the reader's constitution.",
        "Description": "Bound in metal, ''manuals of bodily health'' often were extremely thick and heavy tomes that cold weigh from {{SI|5|lb|k}} to {{SI|25|lb|k}}. The copious pages inside the binding were filled with invaluable information on preventative medicine, first aid, and muscle toning.",
        "Powers": "Apart from being a trove of knowledge, a typical ''manual of bodily health'' could be used to magically imbue the reader with its knowledge that boosted their constitution permanently. In order to tap into this powerful magic, a reeder needed to spend up to forty eight hours over six days, studying the tome. However upon utilizing that power, the book itself disintegrated, or became an ordinary book.",
        "Creation": "[[File:Manual of bodily health.png|thumb|''An open manual of bodily health.''|260x300px]]\n''Manuals of bodily health'' could be created with several power levels that enchanted the reader's constitution accordingly. An experienced crafter of wondrous items could create one of these ''manuals'' using the ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[miracle]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In the days of pre-[[Weeping War]] [[Myth Drannor]], the monks of the abbey of [[Deneir]] created a masterwork ''manual of bodily health''. The enchanted book was placed in a lockbox of the abbey's chapel. The box remained unopened past the destruction of the City of Song and the book was still there in the early-to-mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn [[1340 DR]], one of these magic books could be found within [[Mantor's Library]], of old [[Phlan]]. The book belonged to the library's former master who was a health nut.\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], another ''manuals of bodily health'' surfaced, hidden in a shrine of [[Mask]] in the sewers of [[Tilverton]] and not far from the city's thieves' guild lair.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Black Alaric]], the infamous pirate, or to be more precise one of the pirates who used the name, stashed one of the ''manuals of bodily health'' inside a cave across the cove from the ''[[Seawatcher]]'', guarded by [[flesh golem]]s.\n*The \"Old Mother Wyrm\" [[Ghaulantatra]] had a ''manual of bodily health'' in her dragon hoard ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].\n* The book-obsessed [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] kept a ''manual'' inside his lair of [[Barrenstone]].\n* A ''manual'' was hidden inside the accounting room of [[Castle Ravenloft]] in [[Barovia]], one of the [[Domains of Dread]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Inhabitants of [[Skullport]] claimed that [[Halaster Blackcloak]] hid a library filled with fake books labeled as ''manuals of bodily health'', ''[[libram of gainful conjuration|librams of gainful conjuration]]'', and ''[[Elminster's Black Book]]'' that hid hungry [[palimpsest]]s inside, ready to devour anyone foolish enough to grab the tomes. This library was created as a joke by Halaster."
