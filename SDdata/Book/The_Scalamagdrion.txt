The '''''Scalamagdrion''''' was a mysterious tome of unknown provenance, named for its guardian dragon. It was sought by [[illithid]]s.{{cite book/Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark|81}} 

==Description==
The book was too large to move easily; it contained 26 pages of [[parchment]]. Its covers were made of [[wood]], bound in the black hide of an unknown creature (actually a [[black dragon]]), and edged in beaten [[copper]], a vivid green with age.

==History==
The book was first mentioned in the writings of the mage [[Hethcanter]], who owned it in his youth. He later gave it unto [[Hym Kraaven]], one of the Seven Wizards of [[Myth Drannor]] in exchange for training. All that was recorded afterwards was that a wizard, [[Valathond]], used the spells in the book to defeat [[Gaerlammon]] in a duel at some point afterwards. Rumors of the book's possession were afterwards reported both by [[Auvidarus]] of [[Hillsfar]] and [[Laeral]] of [[The Nine]].

The Scalamagdrion resurfaced in [[Hammer]] of {{yearlink|1372}}, when it was stolen by a [[Red Wizard]]'s apprentice from a private collection in [[Skuld]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|144-145}}

==Contents==
Per Hethcanter's notes, the book contained a first and last blank page, while its remaining 24 pages contained 23 spells. All pages had a blank rear face; the arbitrary arrangement suggested that the spells were not placed there as they were learned, but deliberately, by an experienced wizard. On the faces, they contained the following spells:

''[[write]]'', ''[[erase]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[message]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[wizard lock]]'', ''[[identify]]'', ''[[enchant an item]]'', ''[[permanency]]'', ''[[blink]]'', ''[[disintegrate|disintegration]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[death spell]]'', ''[[flame arrow]]'', ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[conjure elemental]]'', ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'' and ''[[dispel magic]]''.

Between the spells ''[[disintegrate]]'' and ''[[feeblemind]]'' was an enchanted illustration. It was reported to be a "warm" and "velvety" strikingly realistic painting of an apparently endless cavern, in which a draconic creature sat over a pile of human bones. The word "Ningulfim"The word is "Ningulfim" in ''Pages of the Mages'', ''Encyclopedia Magica'', and ''Dragon #92''. However, it is "Nungulfim" in ''DM's Sourcebook of the Realms''. It is assumed that ''Sourcebook'' is in error. was written across the bottom of the page in an arrangement of bones; if spoken out loud, or if the illustration was stared at too long, the image began to move.

Per [[Elminster]], the image was actually a two-way gate, and the monster in the illustration could emerge to attack all creatures nearby, seeking something to devour. When it slew something, it would drag them back through the page.

==Rumors & Legends==
As of {{yearlink|1368}}, the illithids of [[Oryndoll]] sought the book, because their lost lore suggested that [[scalamagdrion]]s were a prime candidate for ceremorphosis.

The book was alternatively said to have been crafted in [[Imaskar]] and alternatively in [[Netheril]], holding the power to summon magic-resistant dragons from a place beyond the world.
