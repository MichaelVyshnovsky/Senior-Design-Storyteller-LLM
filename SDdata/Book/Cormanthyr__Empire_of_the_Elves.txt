'''''Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves'''''is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory. It is part of the [[Arcane Age]] series. It was published in 1998 by [[TSR]] after it became a subsidiary of [[Wizards of the Coast]].

{{Quote|''Step into the past of [[650 DR]] and experience the sights, sounds, and innumerable wonders of fabled [[Myth Drannor]] at its height. Walk the wooded glades of Cormanthyr, the last major elven empire on [[Faerûn]], and discover marvelous secrets lost to the Realms of the present day.''

''This Arcane Age campaign expansion for the Forgotten Realms setting contains all the information necessary to begin either a full-fledged Cormanthyran campaign or a journey back in time some 700 years to see the City of Song at its most glorious.'' 

''This 160-page book contains exhaustive details on the history, culture, military, society, and citizens of the forest nation of Cormanthyr. Features include a timeline of elven history in [[Toril]], a rundown of Cormanthyr's ruler and important individuals, plus more information on the city of Myth Drannor at its height as well as on the communities of [[Semberholme]] and the [[Tangled Trees|Tangled Vale]]. In addition, a new specialty wizard, the elven dualist, is introduced and detailed.''

''Also included is a large section that gives the reader knowledge of the elves' magical rites, rituals, and unique magical weapons and items. Features include new and expanded rules on the elves' potent [[High Magic]], ''[[moonblades]]'', and the multitude of magics that helped make Myth Drannor the glittering gem of Faerûn that it was. Finally, a two-sided, full-color map of the nation of Cormanthyr and an aerial view of Myth Drannor complete this exciting package—the largest collection of elven lore ever.''}}
