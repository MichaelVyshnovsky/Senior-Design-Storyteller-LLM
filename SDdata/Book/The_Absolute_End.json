        "mainbody": "The Absolute End was a book about the dangers the Cult of the Absolute posed, printed sometime in the late 15 century DR.\nThis well-intentioned but hastily penned tome about the Absolute rightfully stoked fear of the new dangerous religion that worshiped the Absolute. However, the books author conflated the cults rise to prominence with other dire and possibly apocalyptic events, such as the resurrection of the lich Vecna, overabundant use of dark necromancy magics, and the heat death of the universe, and even managed to somehow connect the Absolute to the withering of fruits imported from Chult.\nIn the , a copy of The Absolute End could be found in the city of Baldurs Gate, among the books belonging to Lady Firelia Jannath in her Lower City estate."
