'''Marco Volo - Arrival''' ''is the third and last volume of the'' Marco Volo ''trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of 6th-8th level. When the characters first set off on an intrigue-laden journey to [[Shadowdale]], they did not suspect how much trouble they would get into. Joined by [[Marco Volo|Marcus Wands]] (also known as "Marco Volo"), they found him just a bothersome but likeable little [[rogue]]. No one suspected he was on the run from the crazy [[wizard]] [[Sabbar]]. The troublesome Marcus had previously stolen from him a rare artifact called the'' [[Dragonking's Eye]]'', and hid it in the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]]s.

''Now the party approaches the Spiderhaunts, and Marcus insists on diverting the group to retrieve the Eye. But strange things have been happening there. There are rumors: of an oddly constructed keep of bone (or is it crystal?); of a warlord out for conquest (or is it a [[lich]]?); of [[goblin]] tribes strangely clad, and extra-planar beings banding with the [[giant spider]]s of the aptly named Spiderhaunt Woods. Something evil has denned at the heart of the forest. It has a mind of its own....and it has plans for [[Faer√ªn]].

''The last volume of the'' Marco Volo ''trilogy gives a DM the tools to run this free-wheeling, fast-paced adventure, and the secrets of the powers at work behind the scenes. The player characters must face - and deal with - the mad wizard Sabbar, the annoyed [[Volothamp Geddarm]] (who wants to have "a little chat" with Marcus!), and ultimately the'' Dragonking's Eye ''itself. Even the [[Deity|gods]] themselves step in to have their say. In a dramatic denouement, this epic adventure draws to a close, but the memory of what transpired will live on! ''}}
