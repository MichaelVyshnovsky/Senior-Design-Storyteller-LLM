'''''Murder in Halruaa''''' by [[Richard Meyers]] is the third book in the loosely connected [[Mystery series]].

{{Quote|''[[Darlington Blade]] is a down on his luck con man who comes upon a well dressed corpse on the outskirts of a remote town. Figuring that he can use the fine attire more than his mortal acquaintance, he appropriates its clothing and accessories. Much to his surprise he receives a hero's welcome in the town and is immediately appointed guardian [[mage]] (to succeed his alleged tutor who died recently). The townsfolk have mistaken him for a powerful young wizard and expect him to act accordingly. Darlington, ever the con man and not wanting to forsake the cushy VIP treatment that he has been receiving, feels he can pull it off.''}}

== Summary ==
Pryce Covington stumbles on a murder scene after being called to the city by Gamor Turkal, his business partner. He steals a cloak from a dead body and is mistaken for Darrington Blade, a cloak that is instantly recognizable to everyone except for him. He investigates and uncovers that the real Darrrington Blade, a [[halfling]]/[[derro]] named Gheevy Wotfirr, killed Gamor and Teddington Fulmer, co-conspirators who hatched a plan to steal from the workshop of Gheevy’s teacher Geerling Ambersong. Gamor’s plan was to kill Geerling and have him discovered with the cloak and a youthful appearance, framing him for trying to introduce a younger version of himself to hold power. Pryce exposes him, kills him with the help of some [[mongrelfolk]] and a [[jackalwere]] and Dearlyn, Geerling’s daughter, who falls in love with him.
