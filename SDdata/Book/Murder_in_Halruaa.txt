Murder in Halruaa by Richard Meyers is the third book in the loosely connected Mystery series.
Pryce Covington stumbles on a murder scene after being called to the city by Gamor Turkal, his business partner. He steals a cloak from a dead body and is mistaken for Darrington Blade, a cloak that is instantly recognizable to everyone except for him. He investigates and uncovers that the real Darrrington Blade, a halfling/derro named Gheevy Wotfirr, killed Gamor and Teddington Fulmer, co-conspirators who hatched a plan to steal from the workshop of Gheevy’s teacher Geerling Ambersong. Gamor’s plan was to kill Geerling and have him discovered with the cloak and a youthful appearance, framing him for trying to introduce a younger version of himself to hold power. Pryce exposes him, kills him with the help of some mongrelfolk and a jackalwere and Dearlyn, Geerling’s daughter, who falls in love with him.
