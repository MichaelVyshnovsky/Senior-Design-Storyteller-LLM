But they still have one big problem. Too many [[griffon]] mounts were killed in the battles in [[Thay]] and [[Chessenta]]. If the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] is to be more than a name, new mounts must be found.''\n \n''As it happens, the masked witches in [[Rashemen]] have griffons available to a worthy few who can slay the [[undead]] that are committing atrocities throughout the land. Aoth volunteers his band, as do other groups who are in the market for the fighting beasts. But things are not as they seem. Epic battles between rival sellswords, berserkers, and aerial ''[[skyship]]s'' punctuate this whirlwind tale set in a barbaric land of oracles, nature spirits, and talking animals.''}}",
