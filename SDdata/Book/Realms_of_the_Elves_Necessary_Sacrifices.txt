"Necessary Sacrifices" is a short story by Lisa Smedman first published in the 2006 anthology Realms of the Elves.
The loss of a son to a drow attack at the Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale in the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR, leads the elven bard, Sorrel, to join in a pact of service to Shevarash the elven deity of revenge, loss and hatred of the drow. 
His induction at the Oak of Shevarash in Cormanthyr includes membership to the Dark Avengers. The Dark Avengers were made up of elves of all kinds who sought vengeance and retribution on the drow for personal losses. 
Shortly after his induction on Midwinter night of the Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR, there is a drow assault close by. The council of Cormanthyr calls for retaliation via the Dark Avengers.
Assigned to a mixed group of elves as a novice, Sorrel finds redemption and healing in the Underdark on a mission to avenge his lost family.
