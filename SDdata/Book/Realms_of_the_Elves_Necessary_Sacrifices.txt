'''"Necessary Sacrifices"''' is a short story by [[Lisa Smedman]] first published in the 2006 anthology ''[[Realms of the Elves]]''.

==Summary==
The loss of a son to a [[drow]] attack at the [[Old Skull Inn]] in [[Shadowdale]] in the [[1342 DR|Year of the Behir, 1342 DR]], leads the [[elf|elven]] [[bard]], [[Sorrel]], to join in a pact of service to [[Shevarash]] the elven deity of revenge, loss and hatred of the drow. 

His induction at the Oak of Shevarash in [[Cormanthyr]] includes membership to the [[Dark Avengers]]. The Dark Avengers were made up of elves of all kinds who sought vengeance and retribution on the drow for personal losses. 

Shortly after his induction on [[Midwinter]] night of the [[1344 DR|Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR]], there is a drow assault close by. The council of Cormanthyr calls for retaliation via the Dark Avengers.

Assigned to a mixed group of elves as a novice, Sorrel finds redemption and healing in the Underdark on a mission to avenge his lost family.
