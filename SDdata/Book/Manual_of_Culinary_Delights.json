        "Contents": "The [[book]] collected recipes that utilized foodomancy to create various [[enchanted]] foods. The recipes included diagrams, precise directions, and exact measurements, as well as the ingredients required for each dish. One of the magic foods described in the ''Manual of Culinary Delights'' was a \"sand witch\" simply called ''[[basilisk and bread]]'' that could grant the eater [[basilisk]]'s tough skin and [[petrifying]] gaze... or a bad food poisoning if the foodomancer failed to follow instructions to a T.",
        "History": "The foodomancer of some renown named [[Jonathan Greenleaf]] used the ''Manual of Culinary Delights'' and its recipes in his research into the school of magic cooking. His own book that included that research was published sometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
