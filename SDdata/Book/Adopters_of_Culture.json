Your fashion, linguistic cadence, word choice, how you view sex, table manners, farting - all these things are informed by 'home'.''|Excerpt from ''Adopters of Culture''}}",
        "Content": "''Adopters of Culture'' claimed that half-orcs, as a people, had not a one home among them, hailing from everywhere. By Penelope Ringwarble's definition, culture being like [[gumbo]],{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Living City: The Painted Boat Restaurant|15,17}} half-orcs' upbringing an place of birth dictated how they behaved later in life. The book claimed that half-orcs were a diaspora that lacked a home and, therefore â€“ lacked their own culture. Penelope found that fact quite wonderful how varied half-orcs were in the cultures they adopted but wondered how it would affect a half-orc to be forced to adapt to a new home."
