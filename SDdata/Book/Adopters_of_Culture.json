        "mainbody": "Adopters of Culture was a book that discussed culture of half-orcs, written by Penelope Ringwarble and published in the 15 century DR.\nAdopters of Culture claimed that half-orcs, as a people, had not a one home among them, hailing from everywhere. By Penelope Ringwarbles definition, culture being like gumbo, half-orcs upbringing an place of birth dictated how they behaved later in life. The book claimed that half-orcs were a diaspora that lacked a home and, therefore â€“ lacked their own culture. Penelope found that fact quite wonderful how varied half-orcs were in the cultures they adopted but wondered how it would affect a half-orc to be forced to adapt to a new home."
