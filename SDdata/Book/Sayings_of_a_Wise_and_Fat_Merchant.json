        "mainbody": "'''''Sayings of a Wise and Fat Merchant''''' was a [[book]] penned by [[Guldoum Tchar]] of [[Mirabar]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''On facing [[magic]]: Run, or pray, or throw stones; many a [[mage]] is a fraud, and you can win the day even while your heart trembles. Or you can stand calm and mumble nonsense and wiggle your fingers. Some few workers of the art are such cowards that they may flee at this. And as for others, at least when men speak of your death in days after, they'll say, \"I never knew he was a mage; all those years he kept it secret. He must have been a clever fellow.\" Of course, some who listen may disagree.''|Excerpt from ''Sayings of a Wise and Fat Merchant''}}",
        "History": "''Sayings of a Wise and Fat Merchant'' was a collection of musings and thoughts put to paper in the {{YearlinkName|1283}}. One notable opinion that Guldoum Tchar her was his dismissal of most spellcasters as con artists and that one could easily scare them away by pretending to cast spells, making [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]] parts of spells up, scaring wizards off with ease.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}"
