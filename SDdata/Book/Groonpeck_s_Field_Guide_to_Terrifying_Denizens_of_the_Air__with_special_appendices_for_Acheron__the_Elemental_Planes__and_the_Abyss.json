        "mainbody": "roonpecks Field Guide to Terrifying Denizens of the Air, with special appendices for Acheron, the Elemental Planes, and the Abyss was an overlong-titled book from the Blade Kingdoms, penned by scholar Groonpeck sometime long before 1217 DR.\nGroonpecks Field Guide was a voluminous tome that collected information on various dangerous avian creatures, including those found in various Elemental planes and the dreaded Abyss. Each entry in the book was accompanied by a well-drawn illustration of the beast, including such obscure creatures as firebirds&mdashdistant relatives of phoenixes.\nIn 1217 DR, Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomarta and his love interest Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria were able to identify a strange huge seemingly intelligent bird they befriended by accident. The huge bright orange-plumed beast named Tekorriikii was a firebird, a \"sacred, untouchable, and extremely dangerous\" beast to be avoided at all cost."
