        "Contents": "''Groonpeck's Field Guide'' was a voluminous tome that collected information on various dangerous avian creatures, including those found in various [[Elemental planes]] and the dreaded [[Abyss]]. Each entry in the book was accompanied by a well-drawn illustration of the beast, including such obscure creatures as [[firebird]]s&mdash;distant relatives of [[phoenix]]es.",
        "History": "In 1217 DR, [[Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomarta]] and his love interest Princess [[Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria]] were able to identify a strange huge seemingly intelligent bird they befriended by accident. The huge bright orange-plumed beast named [[Tekorriikii]] was a firebird, a \"sacred, untouchable, and extremely dangerous\" beast to be avoided at all cost."
