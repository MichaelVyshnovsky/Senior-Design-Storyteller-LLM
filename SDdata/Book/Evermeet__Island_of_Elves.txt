'''''Evermeet: Island of Elves''''' is a stand-alone novel by [[Elaine Cunningham]]. 

{{quote|''Serene, beautiful, inviolate.''

''Rich in magic and treasure, to those who hear of its legends it is the ultimate paradise. To the beleaguered [[elves]] of [[Toril]] it is the ultimate refuge. But to many it is the ultimate prize.''

''At the heart of its story is [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Amlaruil]], Queen of All Elves. When [[Evermeet]] comes under massive, devastating attack, her sacrifice holds the last hope of saving the elven homeland.''}}

== Summary ==
The book is shaped as an elven history [[opera]] written by [[Danilo Thann]].

=== First Part ===
It is narrated of the gods of the elven pantheon and in particular of the betrayal of [[Araushnee]], who wanted to remove her partner and lover [[Corellon Larethian]] to gain his powers. To achieve that, she obtained the help of several other evil deities, eventually causing a gods war. Just when her plans were close to accomplishment, [[Sehanine Moonbow]] reported the dark elf goddess's crimes and the [[Seldarine]] banished her to the [[Abyss]] and her son [[Vhaeraun]], who helped her, to a mortal world. Araushnee's daughter, [[Eilistraee]], also chose exile, having been unwittingly involved in her mother's plans.

=== Second Part ===
It is narrated of the elven heroes from the [[Dawn Age]] until their leave to [[Evermeet]]. It is said of the struggles of [[Durothil (prince)|Durothil]] and [[Sharlario Moonflower]] to protect their people and to escape the temptations of power and evil; of [[Kethryllia Amarillis]]' crusade to the [[Abyss]] to rescue her lover [[Anarallath]]; of how the Circle of Magi, with its Center in [[Starleaf]], shaped the [[Weave]] to what it is called the [[First Sundering]] and the creation of [[Evermeet]]; and of the perilous travel to the new homeland undertaken by some houses of the elven people. In those ages, many are the enemies that the Elves had to face, the most terrible ones being the fallen goddess [[Lolth]] and her [[drow]] and the hostilities between [[Sun elf|Sun elves]] and [[Moon elf|Moon elves]].

=== Third Part ===
It is narrated of Evermeet's struggles to defend itself against the attacks planned by the Beast Lord [[Malar]].  It is said of heroes like [[Darthoridan Craulnober]] and his wife [[Anarzee Moonflower]], who sacrificed herself for her homeland and People, and of the great mage [[Vhoori Durothil]], who most than anyone else desired power, but who created formidable defenses for Evermeet, such as huge sea creatures called the Guardians and the [[Starfleet]], made of flying ships. In those times, Evermeet importance grew because most of the mainland elven communities fell or lost power.

=== Fourth Part ===
It narrates about the rise of [[Zaor Moonflower]] as king of Evermeet by right of the [[moonblades]]. Yet he couldn't take the rightful queen, [[Amlaruil Moonflower]], as his wife. His reign was not troubleless: apart from attacks to the island, also the houses of [[Amarillis]] and [[Nimesin]] must be dealt with; the first because of the desire of power, obtained through the Amarillis queen that the king was forced to marry; the second because of their attempts to get rid of Moon elves rulers. These troubles were a menace for the king, Amlaruil, and also their children. Eventually, Amlaruil became the official queen.

=== Fifth and Last Part ===
It narrates about Amlaruil and Zaor's reign, goes on with the assassination of the king, and ends with yet another attack brought by Lolth and Malar together with [[Kymil Nimesin]] to Evermeet. Evermeet survives thanks to her queen and her son [[Lamruil Moonflower]].
