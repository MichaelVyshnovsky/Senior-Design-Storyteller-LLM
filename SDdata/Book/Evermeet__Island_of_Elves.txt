Evermeet Island of Elves is a stand-alone novel by Elaine Cunningham. 
The book is shaped as an elven history opera written by Danilo Thann.
It is narrated of the gods of the elven pantheon and in particular of the betrayal of Araushnee, who wanted to remove her partner and lover Corellon Larethian to gain his powers. To achieve that, she obtained the help of several other evil deities, eventually causing a gods war. Just when her plans were close to accomplishment, Sehanine Moonbow reported the dark elf goddesss crimes and the Seldarine banished her to the Abyss and her son Vhaeraun, who helped her, to a mortal world. Araushnees daughter, Eilistraee, also chose exile, having been unwittingly involved in her mothers plans.
It is narrated of the elven heroes from the Dawn Age until their leave to Evermeet. It is said of the struggles of Durothil and Sharlario Moonflower to protect their people and to escape the temptations of power and evil of Kethryllia Amarillis crusade to the Abyss to rescue her lover Anarallath of how the Circle of Magi, with its Center in Starleaf, shaped the Weave to what it is called the First Sundering and the creation of Evermeet and of the perilous travel to the new homeland undertaken by some houses of the elven people. In those ages, many are the enemies that the Elves had to face, the most terrible ones being the fallen goddess Lolth and her drow and the hostilities between Sun elves and Moon elves.
It is narrated of Evermeets struggles to defend itself against the attacks planned by the Beast Lord Malar.  It is said of heroes like Darthoridan Craulnober and his wife Anarzee Moonflower, who sacrificed herself for her homeland and People, and of the great mage Vhoori Durothil, who most than anyone else desired power, but who created formidable defenses for Evermeet, such as huge sea creatures called the Guardians and the Starfleet, made of flying ships. In those times, Evermeet importance grew because most of the mainland elven communities fell or lost power.
It narrates about the rise of Zaor Moonflower as king of Evermeet by right of the moonblades. Yet he couldnt take the rightful queen, Amlaruil Moonflower, as his wife. His reign was not troubleless apart from attacks to the island, also the houses of Amarillis and Nimesin must be dealt with the first because of the desire of power, obtained through the Amarillis queen that the king was forced to marry the second because of their attempts to get rid of Moon elves rulers. These troubles were a menace for the king, Amlaruil, and also their children. Eventually, Amlaruil became the official queen.
It narrates about Amlaruil and Zaors reign, goes on with the assassination of the king, and ends with yet another attack brought by Lolth and Malar together with Kymil Nimesin to Evermeet. Evermeet survives thanks to her queen and her son Lamruil Moonflower.
