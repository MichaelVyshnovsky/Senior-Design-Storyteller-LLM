Its name was a Dwarvish word translated to \"nobody\" in the Common tongue.\nThe lively drinking songs plot was about dwarves being blamed for one bad thing after another after being caught red-handed and each time they were caught the dwarves said that \"Sunrun\" did it.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, a dwarvish Harper, who went by the alias Sunrun, aided the heroes who would become gods Midnight, Cyric, and Kelemvor, during their stay at Scardale."
