The Ogres Pact by Troy Denning is book one of The Twilight Giants trilogy.
In the kingdom of Hartsvale, King Camden Hartwick gives his daughter Brianna to the ogre chieftain/shaman Goboka in return for the ogres’ assistance in the War of the Hart having one of his men named Runolf Saemon kidnap her and almost killing her firbolg bodyguard Morten. He intends to take her to Twilight Vale, a sacred gathering place for giantkind home to a Twilight Spirit, to perform a ritual where she will be forced to mate. 
Meanwhile, a thief named Avner and his verbeeg friend Basil cause Tavis Burdun, a firbolg scout and potential suitor to Brianna, to be blamed for their thievery. He sets off to rescue Brianna. Runolf is killed and turned into an undead sentry, eventually defeated by Tavis and friends, who learn of the king’s plan. Avner gets eighteen people killed by disobeying Taviss orders to warn them about a trap. 
A healed Morten and an Earl named Dobbin join the rescue attempt. They save Brianna, but she disbelieves the story of her father’s treachery and seeks refuge with the hill giant chieftain Noote. Earl Dobbin is killed by direwolves controlled by Goboka, and Avner and Basil separated. The others escape the hill giants with the help of enslaved fomorians, killing Noote and his queen in the process. Brianna kills Goboka and returns, exposing the king’s treachery and causing him to abdicate. The frost and stone giant guards of Camden attempt to abduct Brianna for the Twilight Spirit, but are forced to leave with Camden when Tavis threatens to kill her rather than let her be taken. Brianna becomes queen of Hartsdale.
