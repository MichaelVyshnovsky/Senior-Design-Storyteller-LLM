        "History": "By 1348 DR, Goldhallow's chapbooks were popular in Suzail, and more rural areas of Cormyr, especially among women. The books, including ''The Rebel Prince,'' were read by farmers' wives and [[Purple Dragons]]. The book featured some titillating naughty bits. Some thought the handsome [[ranger]] [[Florin Falconhand]] to be a striking resemblance of one of the book's salacious characters, Boldgrim the Outlaw, from chapter three."
