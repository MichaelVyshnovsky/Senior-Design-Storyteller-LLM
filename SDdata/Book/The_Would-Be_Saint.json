I could no longer remain in the gilded elysium of the Upper City and sought to see the world as it truly was.''|Excerpt from ''The Would-Be Saint''}}",
        "Contents": "The book was a detailed autobiography of Saint Brigid, a wealthy [[patriar]] woman from [[Baldur's Gate]], who was affected by the events of the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]] and the death of [[Sarevok Anchev]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She gave up the life of privilege, loving family, and wealth, becoming a [[cleric]] of [[Ilmater]], the Broken God, He of Compassion and Mercy, the One Who Endures. Sarevok's death opened Brigid's eyes to the cruelty, violence, and injustice of the world. Until her death, Brigid served the community and the Broken God in Baldur's Gate's [[Outer City]].",
        "History": "The book was written close to the end of Brigid's life as a written work and a bid to be canonized as a Saint of the [[Church of Ilmater]], sometime after Sarevok Anchev's death in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Would-Be Saint'' book was stored in the safety of tombs underneath the [[Open Hand Temple]] dedicated to Ilmater in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district of Baldur's Gate."
