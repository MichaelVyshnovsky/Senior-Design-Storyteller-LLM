'''''Player's Option: Heroes of the Elemental Chaos''''' is a sourcebook for the 4th-edition ruleset of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' for the core setting, although it also provides specific information about [[primordial]]s of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' campaign setting.

{{Quote|''Masters of [[fire]] and [[earth (element)|earth]]. Lords of [[air]] and [[water]]. This tome is the definitive sourcebook for creating and playing characters with ties to the [[Elemental Chaos]] and the [[primordial]] beings that dwell there. It shows how the elements can influence heroes of the natural world and presents elemental-themed character options for players.''

''In addition to discussing elemental power and presenting new character themes with strong story hooks, this book includes three new class builds—the [[elementalist]], the [[sha'ir]], and the [[shugenja]]—and new feats and paragon paths designed to tie existing characters more closely to the Elemental Chaos.''}}
