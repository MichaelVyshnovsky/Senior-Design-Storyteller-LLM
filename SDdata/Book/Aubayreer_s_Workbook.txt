'''''Aubayreer's Workbook''''' was the personal [[spellbook]] of [[Aubayreer]], the former [[Mage-king]] of [[Aglarond]]. 

==Description==
The pages of this spellbook were made from a long strip of the green bark of a [[hiexel]] tree, folded like the body of a squeezebox into 18 faces. It was bound by two pieces of oiled wood and fastened with a small hemp cord. On one of the plates was Aubayreer's [[mage sigil|personal rune]], identifying the tome as his personal work.

==History==
This book, and the unique [[spell]]s within, were developed when Aubayreer served as apprentice to the [[Mages of the Covenant]] in his youth. When Aubayreer took an apprentice of his own, a [[mage]] named [[Nytholops]], he used the tome exclusively for his training. Nytholops extrapolated its contents into a work of his own, known as ''[[Chronicles]]''.

After Aubayreer's founding of the magical dynasty of Aglarond, during the reign of his grandson [[Lurskas]], the ''workbook'' was stolen from the royal library and its exact location since has been a topic of rumor and hearsay. One anecdote had the mage [[Nuzar]] of the [[Seven Curses]] perusing it at some point, or at least casting one of the unique spells within.

==Contents==
The ''workbook'' contained a blank face, which Aubayreer used as a surface for [[rune magic|runes]] or symbols, 14 faces with common spells, one with his version of the spell ''[[ice storm]]'' and the last two containing unique spells he had crafted himself.
