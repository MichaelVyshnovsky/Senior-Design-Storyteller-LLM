        "Description": "''Unearthed Arcana'' was written by [[Gary Gygax]] with design and editing contributions by [[Jeff Grubb]] and [[Kim Mohan]], respectively, and published by TSR in 1985.\n\n''Unearthed Arcana'' was divided into two sections: one for players and one for the Dungeon Master. The book provided new races, classes, and other expansion material. The book gives details on using \"subraces\" of the standard races, such as dark elves ([[drow]]), and deep gnomes ([[svirfneblin]]), for use as player characters and non-player characters.\n\nThe book includes new weapons, and revised information on character level maximums for non-human player characters. ''Unearthed Arcana'' details the weapon specialization rules, in which a fighter or ranger \"can adopt a weapon as a special arm, and receive bonuses in its use\". The book also describes the comeliness attribute, and contains new spells. The DM's section covers suggestions for handling player characters, social class and rank tables, many new magic items, weaponless combat rules, and nonhuman deities.\n\n''Unearthed Arcana'' includes the [[barbarian]], [[cavalier]], and thief-acrobat character classes, and also includes expansions and revisions of the [[druid]] and [[ranger]] classes.\n\nGygax reportedly produced the book to raise money as TSR was deeply in debt at the time. He announced in the March 1985 issue of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine that Unearthed Arcana would be released in the summer of that year. He proposed the book as \"an interim volume to expand the ''[[Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition|Dungeon Masters Guide]]'' and ''[[Players Handbook 1st edition|Players Handbook]]''\", as the information was spread out in several places and difficult to keep track of.",
