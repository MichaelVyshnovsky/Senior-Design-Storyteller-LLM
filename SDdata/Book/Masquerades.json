In the false childhood memories, Alias remembers Jamal as her mother. \nThey deliver the staff but run afoul of the Night Masks. Victor Dhostar, son of the Croamarkh Luer Dhostar, convinces his father to hire Alias to drive out the Night Masks, suspecting her of being a Harper agent. Alias begins hunting for the Faceless, leader of the Night Masks, who uses the skull of Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco the red dragon to learn Aliass history and an enchanted mask of platinum coins made by the church of Leira and stolen by the church of Mask to hide himself from divination magic. \nAlias and Dragonbait stay at Blais House, an inn where they befriend a half-elven servant girl named Mercy. They are joined by Olive Ruskettle, employed by the older noble Nettle Thalavar, who has a granddaughter named Thistle.

By the time they arrive the next day with Durgar, priest of Tyr and head of the Watch, the Faceless has removed all the treasure. \nVictor, who has been the true Faceless all along, frames his father as the Faceless, with the help of Kimbel, a Night Mask assassin who tried to kill Luer and was geased to serve the family, although he really only served Victor.

Kimbel poisons and kidnaps Dragonbait, but is knocked out by an invisible Mintassan, who switches their appearance and feebleminds Kimbel. \nVictor has the Watch find Luer with the Faceless’s mask, but when Alias realizes that Luer wasn’t the Faceless and tries to tell the Watch, he poisons her. Mintassan, in the shape of Kimbel, fakes Alias’s death and uses the lure of the lost treasure of Verovan Lorndessar, last king of Westgate, to draw him into a trap, tricking him into assembling the Night Masks in one place. \nAlias, in the guise of a halfling named Winterheart, gets employed with Olive protecting Thistle, whose copper feather token is the key to the treasure.
