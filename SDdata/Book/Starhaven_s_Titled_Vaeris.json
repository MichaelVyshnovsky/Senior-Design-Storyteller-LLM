        "mainbody": "'''''Starhaven's Titled Vaeris''''' was a regularly re-printed index and titles of the nobility of [[Waterdeep]], printed by [[Alandolphor Starhaven]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]] and later by his descendants in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries DR.",
        "Description": "''Starhaven's Titled Vaeris'' was available in thick letter-of-the-alphabet \"double-bound\" [[chapbook]] printings that collected information on the most relevant and timely nobility of the City of Splendors, or in thin single-family-per-volume editions.\n\nBoth variants were organized in the same format: drawings of a family tree on the left page and a short list of factoids and titles per family member on the right page of each spread. The hierarchy of listed nobility was determined by prominence and relevancy at the time of printing. Much of the information and family members were omitted as time passed, so readers often kept older editions of ''Starhaven's Titled Vaeris'' for posterity.\n\nAlandolphor Starhaven, who was the original author, disappeared in the {{YearlinkName|1286}}. Judging by rumors in Waterdeep, he was likely assassinated by a disgruntled noble who was offended by an erroneous printing of their titles. After Alandolphor's disappearance, the printing duties were taken over by his six daughters and, eventually, by their descendants. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''Starhaven's'' was an annual publication purchased by every noble house, guild, and person interested in the city's politics. Merchants and members of Waterdhavian clubs and merchants purchased copies of ''Starhaven's'' to know how to address their noble patrons properly."
