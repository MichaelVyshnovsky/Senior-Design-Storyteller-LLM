Sometimes the differences are obvious&mdash;anyone can distinguish a seafaring mage from a [[turban]]-crowned spellcaster, or a thief of [[Lantan]] from a burglar of [[Amn]]. But often, appearance gives no clue: even wizards and rogues of the [[Dalelands]] vary from Dale to Dale, though one may look the same as another. Faer√ªnians are fiercely proud of their heritage, and they carry their native traits with them wherever they go.''\n\n''Within these pages are dozens of kits designed to help players in a <span style<nowiki>=</nowiki>\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Forgotten Realms</span><sup>&reg;</sup> campaign discover their characters' roots and reflect them in role-playing. Special benefits and disadvantages related to each particular home town or territory allow players to create unique kits that can be applied to mages, specialist wizards, and rogues, and they can even be layers over other kits. As a bonus, two new character subclasses have been included: the intriguing ''[[spellsinger]]'' and the stealthy ''[[shadow walker]]''.''}}"
