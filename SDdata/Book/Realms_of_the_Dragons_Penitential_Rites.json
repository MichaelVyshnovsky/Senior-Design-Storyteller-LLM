His friend, the half-dragon warlord-turned-monk Drakken Thaal, suspects that he himself murdered Arranoth in his sleep. Drakken investigates the murder and discovers it to be a plot engineered by the Cult of the Dragon agent Valerix, who sought to enrage Drakken enough to awaken the Rage of Dragons within him. The Monastery is overrun by orc and goblin marauders fleeing the depredations of the dragon Foilsunder in the nearby Winterwood. Drakken kills the cultist and succumbs to the Rage, but his faith in Ilmater keeps him from losing control of his faculties.
