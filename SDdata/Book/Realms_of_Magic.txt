==Index==
===Prologue===
By [[Brian Thomsen]]

Date: [[1366 DR]]Although the "Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction" timeline places "Prologue" and "Epilogue" in 1366 DR, they expressly follow ''[[Once Around the Realms]]'', which "Presenting..." places in [[1367 DR]]. Moreover, ''Once Around the Realms'' has its own significant dating discrepancy. In addition, "Prologue" implies the in-universe ''[[Volo's Guide to the Dalelands (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to the Dalelands]]'' is forthcoming, but "The Candlekeep Collection" article says it was written over 1368–1369 DR. However, both characters may be considered unreliable given the story.

===Red Ambition===
By [[Jean Rabe]]

''"Red Ambition" was also published in ''[[The Best of the Realms]]'' anthology.''

[[Szass Tam]], [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]], is betrayed by his apprentice, [[Frodyne]]. Frodyne is brilliant, ruthlessly ambitious, and enamored with the [[lich]], who plans to grant her wish for immortality. However, when Tam flippantly takes information from her about a powerful [[artifact]], she becomes furious and steals away to claim it for herself.

The Zulkir sends an army of [[undead]] to a hidden temple of [[Leira]] in ruined [[Delhumide]] to collect the artifact. That he will be defiling a god's temple does not bother him, as he long ago found most gods to be unworthy of respect. When he learns the army was completely destroyed, Tam goes himself to investigate. After subduing the temple's guardian ghost, he forces it to lead him to the inner sanctum. There he finds Frodyne fighting the nearly invincible [[Runic guardian|golem]] that guards the treasure. Instead of helping her, he grants her immortality—thereby giving the golem a never-ending distraction.

The Zulkir of Necromancy takes the artifact, a [[ruby]]-studded crown, and places it on his head. He immediately falls to the ground writhing in pain. The temple guardian laughs at him; the crown bestows eternal life to its wearer, but Tam has no heart to beat or lungs to breathe. Leira, the Lady of Deception, has proven herself the greater power, as Tam has lost his army, his greatest apprentice, and a measure of his confidence to a simple ruse. Philosophical even in defeat, Szass Tam leaves the temple laughing at himself.
