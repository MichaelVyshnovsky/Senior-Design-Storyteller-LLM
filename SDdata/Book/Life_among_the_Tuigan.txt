'''''Life among the Tuigan''''' was a book written by the [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] in the early 1360s [[DR]]. It gave a careful and unbiased account of his experiences with the [[Tuigan]] people of the [[Hordelands]] and of the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Horde]].

==History==
Following King [[Azoun IV]]'s crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Koja was a guest of Azoun in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], for over a year. While there, on the king's request, he wrote up an account of his experiences with the Tuigan and their culture. He was aided in this by [[Thom Reaverson]], who worked on a similar project and provided Koja with translations and guidance.

Koja later dismissed it as an incomplete collection of notes about Tuigan customs, and felt that Reaverson put in an equal amount of work and written a more exhaustive account of the wars. Koja expanded his notes into ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]'' when he moved to [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]].

==Content==
Despite Koja's skills as a military historian, his works said little about how the Tuigan breached the [[Dragonwall]], suggesting that magic was used.

==Locations==
One copy was in the possession of King Azoun IV of Cormyr in the early 1360s [[DR]].
