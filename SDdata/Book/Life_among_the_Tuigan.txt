Life among the Tuigan was a book written by the lama Koja of Khazari in the early 1360s DR. It gave a careful and unbiased account of his experiences with the Tuigan people of the Hordelands and of the Horde.
Following King Azoun IVs crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR, Koja was a guest of Azoun in Suzail, Cormyr, for over a year. While there, on the kings request, he wrote up an account of his experiences with the Tuigan and their culture. He was aided in this by Thom Reaverson, who worked on a similar project and provided Koja with translations and guidance.
Koja later dismissed it as an incomplete collection of notes about Tuigan customs, and felt that Reaverson put in an equal amount of work and written a more exhaustive account of the wars. Koja expanded his notes into A History of the Tuigan when he moved to Procampur in the Vast.
Despite Kojas skills as a military historian, his works said little about how the Tuigan breached the Dragonwall, suggesting that magic was used.
One copy was in the possession of King Azoun IV of Cormyr in the early 1360s DR.
