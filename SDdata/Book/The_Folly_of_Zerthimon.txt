The Folly of Zerthimon was a githyanki stone disc that detailed the split between githyanki and githzerai, written in both Gith language and in the Common tongue, written long before the 15 century DR.
The stone disc was carved with Githyanki runes originally, with the translation in Common scribed on it at a later date. The disk told the story of the Mother Gith, the original Vlaakith, and the gith peoples fate after the fall of the Illithid Empire. When gith were freed, Vlaakith I traversed the planes and discovered other peoples prospering in other worlds. As she focused on spreading the gith people, Zerthimon began questioning his own races nature, arguing for them to be reborn in their newfound freedom. Zerthimon taught his followers that Vlaakith I, building her new empire, made gith the same as their old masters. This belief was held to be blasphemous and traitorous, sparking the great War of the One Sky.
According to the disk, Zerthimons inevitable defeat came in the Blasted Plains, banishing Zerthimon and his followers to the plane of Limbo. There, githzerai remained, as The Folly of Zerthimon claimed, "languishing in the lethargy they craved, free of inner fire, free of purpose." The new people called themselves githzerai, while githyanki called them hsharlaki, which meant "unforgivable."
In the , one disk containing The Folly of Zerthimon could be found in Cr√®che Yllek of the Western Heartlands on Toril.
