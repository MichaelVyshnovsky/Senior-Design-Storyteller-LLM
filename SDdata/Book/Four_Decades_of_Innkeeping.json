Adventurers make even kings think twice about cruelly oppressing all who pass within reach, teach prudence to high priests and even rogue wizards, and are almost the only curb upon the numbers of dragons and other large and monstrous beasts.''<br/>\n''On the whole, I think the balance comes out about even. What makes us keep adventuring charters instead of burning them along with their bearers is the entertainment adventurers afford the populace. In hamlets and at waymoots, after one's grumbled about the weather, taxes, the latest rumors of war and orc raids, and the all-too-paltry gossip about the indiscretions of royalty and nobility, there’s little else to talk about but the foolish escapades of adventurers.''|Excerpt from ''Four Decades of Innkeeping''}}",
        "Contents": "Among other topics, Thundaerlel discussed Crown-chartered adventurers in his book. The innkeeper held a low opinion of the adventuring trade, calling them mischief-makers and brigands, responsible for pillaging, thefts, and casual murders. Despite that, he also thought adventurers were a necessary plague as they kept high priests, [[wizard]]s, and kings in check, as well as controlled populations of dangerous monsters."
