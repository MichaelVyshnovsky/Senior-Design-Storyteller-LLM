        "Contents": "The ''Firedawn Cycle'' was described as a lengthy, chanted song with an eerie quality.\n\nThe epic told of the ascension of [[Raumathar]] as a power in the [[Unapproachable East|east]]. It detailed the people's collective lust for machines of war and their downfall as caused by the [[demon]]-worshiping [[Narfell]]i.\n\nThe ''Firedawn Cycle'' was rarely if ever, heard by non-[[Rashemaar]] and never inscribed in written records."
