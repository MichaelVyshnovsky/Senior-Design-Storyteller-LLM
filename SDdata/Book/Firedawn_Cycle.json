        "mainbody": "he Firedawn Cycle was an epic song originating from the Wychlaran of Rashemen.\nThe Firedawn Cycle was described as a lengthy, chanted song with an eerie quality.\nThe epic told of the ascension of Raumathar as a power in the east. It detailed the peoples collective lust for machines of war and their downfall as caused by the demon-worshiping Narfelli.\nThe Firedawn Cycle was rarely if ever, heard by non-Rashemaar and never inscribed in written records."
