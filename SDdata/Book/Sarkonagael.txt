The Sarkonagael, also known as Secrets of the Shadewrights, was a spellbook of shadow magic likely written by the mage Sarkon.No author is given for the Sarkonagael rather, this is presumed from its shared name with the spell Sarkons umbral simulacrum.
The tome was bound in black leather and had a silver skull on the cover. Interior pages were black and had silver lettering that could only be read in pitch darkness.
The Sarkonagael contained dozens of shadow magic spells of varying levels. The book was considered especially dangerous because it contained the spell Sarkons umbral simulacrum, which allowed a shadow mage to create a doppelganger of a person from shadowstuff.
