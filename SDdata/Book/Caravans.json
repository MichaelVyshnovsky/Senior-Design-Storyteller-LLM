        "Description": "Caravans is an Al-Qadim adventure in which the eponymous caravan serves to move the characters (levels 5â€“9) across the [[High Desert]] in western Zakhara. If the player characters feed ancient poetry to [[Ala'i the Hungry]] during the adventure, Ala'i gives them clues by blacking in parts of its weave. Other encounters include a talking tent, weird lightning on a high rock spire, broom-wielding copper automatons, [[giant roc]] skeletons, bug-eating [[centaur]]s, and an [[efreeti]] palace beneath the [[Pit of Ghuls]].",
