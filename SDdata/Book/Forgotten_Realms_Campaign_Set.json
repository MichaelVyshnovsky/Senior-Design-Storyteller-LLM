        "mainbody": "Forgotten Realms Campaign Set is a 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set that was set in the Forgotten Realms. \nThe Forgotten Realms Campaign Set was sold as a box set containing two 96-page books, four maps, and two clear plastic hex-gridded overlays. The maps were four full-color, 34\" x 22\" maps, two of which combine to form a large-scale (1\" = 90 miles) map of the western half of the vast Realms continent, while the other two provide a more detailed (1\" = 30 miles) map of the regions featured in the campaign pack.\nThe Dungeon Masters Sourcebook of the Realms describes how to set up and run a campaign in the Forgotten Realms. A pair of short scenarios is included, and information is provided on wilderness terrain and movement, important personalities, rumors, and significant and magical books. Written from the perspective of Elminster the sage, the book introduces the campaign setting, explains how to use it, and offers adventure resources. Large areas were set aside to be developed for house campaigns, and no published materials were intended to be printed to exploit those areas, while one area detailed in this package was intended to have no subsequent publications use that area. The package covers only the western half of a single continent the eastern half would later be covered in a separate sourcebook for Kara-Tur. Two complete dungeon-style adventures are provided \"Halls of the Beast-Tamers\", a dungeon with many unconventional problem-solving exercises, and \"Lashans Fall\", a dungeon with a mystery and an opportunity to parley with a monster. The \"Books of the Forgotten Realms\" section is a treatment of several magical tomes that suggests a variety of adventures, with a description of the appearance, history, and contents of each book.\nThe Cyclopedia of the Realms provides background information on and details maps of the locations in the accompanying maps of the Forgotten Realms. It begins with an explanation of the Realms treatment of time, names, language, and currency, and its gods and religion. The remaining 75 pages of the book is an encyclopedic and alphabetic listing of important places, races, nations, cultures, character classes, and organizations of the Realms.\nEd Greenwood and Jeff Grubb collaborated beginning in 1986 to turn Greenwoods Forgotten Realms campaign setting into a publishable product for the public. Greenwood sent in packages filled with raw material, maps, and notes to Grubb. Grubb then organized and rewrote much of the material, and Karen Martin edited it. Their combined work created the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set that was published in 1987. It featured illustrations and artwork from Keith Parkinson, Jeff Easley, Clyde Caldwell, and Tim Conrad.\nCyclopedia of the Realms\n* Introductions\n* About this Product\n* Time in the Realms\n* Names in the Realms\n* Languages of the Realms\n* Currency in the Realms\n* Religion in the Realms\n* Cyclopedia Entries\n* Anauroch Map\n* Arabel Map\n* Cormyr Map\n* Cormyr Royal Lineage\n* Dalelands Map\n* Immersea Map\n* Mages Sigils\n* Merchant Company Banners\n* Myth Drannor Maps\n* Scornubel Map\n* Old Skull Inn Map\n* Shadowdale Map\n* Suzail Map\n* Westgate Map\n* Zhentil Keep Network\n* Appendix The Shadowdale Census\nDMs Sourcebook of the Realms\n* Introductions\n* Using the Forgotten Realms\n** Into the Forgotten Realms\n** Setting Up for AD&D® Game Adventures\n** Using the Maps\n** Encounters in the ReaJms\n* Selected NPCs of the Realms\n* Recent News and Rumors in the Realms\n** Year of the Worm\n** Year of the Prince\n* Adventure Background\n* The Halls of the Beast-Turners\n* Lashans Fall\n* Books of the Forgotten Realms\n* Index\nMaps\n* 21\" x 33\" map of the Sword Coast, from Icewind Dale to the jungles of Chult, including the Moonshae Isles and the Far Hills.\n* 21\" x 33\" map of Interior Faerûn, from Lapaliiya and Eastern Shaar to Anauroch and Sossal\n* 33\" x 21\" map of Cormyr, Sembia, and the Dalelands, from Priapurl and Tsurlagol to Anauroch and Vaasa\n* 33\" x 21\" map of the Western Heartlands, from Easting and the Lonely Moor to Beregost, Daggerford, and Mintarn\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSettlements\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • Windriders Trading Coster\nSpells\nAganazzars scorcher • Archveults skybolt • bladebless • bladethirst • body sympathy • Bowgentles fleeting journey • briartangle • Caligardes claw • catfeet • cut • death chariot • dismind • dispel silence • encrypt • flame shroud • gallop • great shout • Grimwalds greymantle • hailcone • holy flail • horn • Ilyykurs mantle • Laerals dancing dweomer • listen • Meralds murderous mist • Nchasers glowing globe • Nulathoes ninemen • phase trap • Prespers moonbow • reconstruction • reveal • sacred link • scatterspray • scorch • secure • smoke ghost • spell engine • Spendelardes chaser • snatch • spark • stealspell • sting • Tasirins haunted sleep • thorn spray • thunderlance • Tulruns tracer • watchware\nForgotten Realms Campaign Set Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nFileCyclopediaOfTheRealms.jpg|Cover of Cyclopedia of the Realms\nFileDMsSourcebookOfTheRealms.jpg|Cover of DMs Sourcebook of the Realms\nFile\n* Design Ed Greenwood\n* Design and Development Jeff Grubb\n* Editing Karen S.
