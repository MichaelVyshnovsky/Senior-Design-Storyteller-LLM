The '''''Book of Dead Gods''''' was an ancient ornate tome that recorded names of [[deities]], both perished and returned to life.

==Description==
The ''Book of Dead Gods'' was a hefty tome wrapped in an intricately decorated binding of embossed [[gold]]. Its cover had a large golden lock, just as intricately decorated as the rest of the item. It kept the tome shut tight. When held, the tome felt uncannily light despite its size and materials.

==Contents==
This tome of antiquity held the names of deities and entire pantheons that had once existed and perished. The script of the tome was hard to read because of the tome's age. The last three names in the massive list of dead gods were written close together—the [[Dead Three]], who were killed during the [[Godswar]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR. The tome also recorded the names of all the deities that flickered to life during the [[Second Sundering]].

==History==
[[File:Book of Dead Gods shadowheart.png|thumb|330x330px|''[[Shadowheart]] channeling a spark of [[Shar]]'s divinity to open the Book of Dead Gods.'']]
The origins of the book were unknown; however, the tome was stored within an ancient and abandoned [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|Temple of Jergal]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], sealed from curious eyes and grave-robbers, guarded by entombed scribes of a Jergali cult. The book was still in the temple and locked as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. It could be opened by a single key hidden within the temple. Individuals of immense strength could snap the lock to open the book, while those who practiced [[the Art]] could open the tome by sabotaging the item's protective runes. Servants of the gods could access the ''Book of Dead Gods'' through divine aid. A single ''[[scroll]]'' of the ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'' [[spell]] was kept between the tome's pages, pulsing with the arcane energies.
