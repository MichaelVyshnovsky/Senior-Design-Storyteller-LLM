        "mainbody": "The '''''Anthem of War''''' was a religious ballad sung by the [[Golden Legion]] during the leadership of [[Cordell]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The song was in equal parts a melody that praised the Legion's patron deity [[Helm]], celebrated a victory, and commiserated those legionaries fallen in the line of duty. The ''Anthem'' was a beautiful composition that resonated with the hearts of every member of the Golden Legion. Traditionally, the song started with a single voice, then was joined by the Legion's chorus as it progressed.",
        "History": "Before the journey to the [[True World]], in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, the Golden Legion performed the ''Anthem of War'' to remember fallen friends and inspire the legionaries for the journey across the [[Trackless Sea]]. [[Martine (Golden Legion)|Martine]], the daughter of [[Bishou Dominicus]] and a devotee of Helm, possessed a clear and beautiful soaring voice. She started the ''Anthem of War'' at her father's request."
