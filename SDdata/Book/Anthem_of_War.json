        "mainbody": "The Anthem of War was a religious ballad sung by the Golden Legion during the leadership of Cordell in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe song was in equal parts a melody that praised the Legions patron deity Helm, celebrated a victory, and commiserated those legionaries fallen in the line of duty. The Anthem was a beautiful composition that resonated with the hearts of every member of the Golden Legion. Traditionally, the song started with a single voice, then was joined by the Legions chorus as it progressed.\nBefore the journey to the True World, in the , the Golden Legion performed the Anthem of War to remember fallen friends and inspire the legionaries for the journey across the Trackless Sea. Martine, the daughter of Bishou Dominicus and a devotee of Helm, possessed a clear and beautiful soaring voice. She started the Anthem of War at her fathers request."
