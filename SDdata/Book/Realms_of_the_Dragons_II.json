Each story in it was written by a newcomer to Realms fiction.\n\n{{Quote|''Realms rise and fall, human lives tick by like seconds on a clock, and the [[dragons]] watch from on high. But when the mighty [[wyrms]] lose their minds, when they succumb to their basest, most violent impulses, time stands still.''\n\n''And that just happens to be the moment you should be running the fastest.''\n\n''From the far corners of [[Faer√ªn]], from the skies above and the pits below, from the imaginations of the next generation of fantasy masters, come tales of dragons good and evil.''\n\n''This collection features all new stories by Forgotten Realms newcomers including ''[[Maiden of Pain]]'' author [[Kameron M. Franklin]], [[Murray J. D. Leeder]], [[Erik Scott de Bie]], [[James P. Davis]], and many more.''}}\n\nThe print version of the anthology included a number of previews of upcoming (at the time of publication) Realms fiction by the authors of some of the anthology's short stories, including [[Maiden of Pain]] by [[Kameron M. Franklin]], [[Bloodwalk]] by [[James P. Davis]], [[Son of Thunder]] by [[Murray J.D. Leeder]], and [[Ghostwalker (novel)|Ghostwalker]] by [[Eric Scott de Bie]].\n\nA short humor story about the authors, \"[[In Search of Phil]]\", was released online-only and uncredited in the Wizards of the Coast website.",

Surely not a four-inch faerie dragon.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|The Woman Who Drew Dragons]]\" by [[Rosemary Jones]] ([[1362 DR]]). Even a painting of a dragon can be dangerous if you look it in the eye.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/The Hunting Game|The Hunting Game]]\" by [[Erik Scott de Bie]] ([[1364 DR]]). Hunting dragons is no game. Being hunted by dragons is even less so.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/The Road Home|The Road Home]]\" by [[Harley Stroh]] ([[Marpenoth 21]] in [[1367 DR]]). Can a captured pseudodragon can give a wandering barbarian a new lease on life?\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/How Burlmarr Saved the Unseen Protector|How Burlmarr Saved the Unseen Protector]]\" by [[Kameron M. Franklin]] ([[Uktar]] in [[1369 DR]]). When a young gnome finds he can see through the eyes of a dragon, he becomes the most unlikely defender a great wyrm has ever had.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/A Tall Tale|A Tall Tale]]\" by [[J. L. Collins]] ([[1370 DR]]). The only thing more stupid than telling your friends you've fed a dragon is bringing them to see it.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|The Book Dragon]]\" by [[Jim Pitrat]] (Mid [[Hammer]] in [[1372 DR]]). Red Wizards kill and steal for a book. But who can blame them when they hear the secrets this tome keeps?\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/Freedom's Promise|Freedom's Promise]]\" by [[Ed Gentry]] ([[Kythorn]] in [[1372 DR]]). Freedom can come at a high price, but no matter how much you're willing to pay, never try to buy it from a dragon.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/Possessions|Possessions]]\" by [[James P. Davis]] ([[Flamerule]] in [[1372 DR]]). A fang dragon stalks the streets, hunting prey more terrifying than the assassins sent to hunt it.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/Queen of the Mountain|Queen of the Mountain]]\" by [[Jaleigh Johnson]]. Dragons grow old and die just like people, and it's a very bad idea to disturb their graves.\n*\"[[Realms of the Dragons II/The Strength of the Jester|The Strength of the Jester]]\" by [[Murray J.D. Leeder]] ([[Mirtul]] in [[1373 DR]]). When the most trusted among the dragons feel the Rage simmering inside them, even ancient alliances can crumble.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II}}"
