==Summary==
[[Taegan Nightwind]], lost and disoriented in [[Calaunt]] after leaving his tribe, is attacked by a bunch of thugs, only to be saved by the arrival of another warrior, [[Falar Aporos]]; after a short conversation, Taegan decides to thank him by taking the woman he loves, [[Arveene Dalurieth]], from the tower where her father keeps her, so the two of them can elope together. Being an elf with wings, he bypasses most of the tower's wards through flight, and fights a [[nimblewright]] at the top; after defeating it, however, she is horrified at the sight of him, and claims to have never heard of Falar Aporos in her life.

Taegan flees, only to realize that there's a commotion in the estate at ground level; he realizes he's been used as a distraction, as Falar merely wanted to steal [[Vonn Dalurieth]]'s bear. He finds the woman who lured him into the ambush before, [[Olma]], and manages to threaten her into revealing Falar's location. He enters their hideout, and though the battle goes poorly for him, it improves as soon as he releases the bear; he narrowly manages to escape.

Later he becomes Vonn Dalurieth's guest, who has a task for him.
