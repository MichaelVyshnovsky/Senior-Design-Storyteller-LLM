New in Town is a short story written by Richard Lee Byers and published in Dragon #320. It narrates a short misadventure by Taegan Nightwind in Calaunt shortly after leaving his tribe.
Taegan Nightwind, lost and disoriented in Calaunt after leaving his tribe, is attacked by a bunch of thugs, only to be saved by the arrival of another warrior, Falar Aporos after a short conversation, Taegan decides to thank him by taking the woman he loves, Arveene Dalurieth, from the tower where her father keeps her, so the two of them can elope together. Being an elf with wings, he bypasses most of the towers wards through flight, and fights a nimblewright at the top after defeating it, however, she is horrified at the sight of him, and claims to have never heard of Falar Aporos in her life.
Taegan flees, only to realize that theres a commotion in the estate at ground level he realizes hes been used as a distraction, as Falar merely wanted to steal Vonn Dalurieths bear. He finds the woman who lured him into the ambush before, Olma, and manages to threaten her into revealing Falars location. He enters their hideout, and though the battle goes poorly for him, it improves as soon as he releases the bear he narrowly manages to escape.
Later he becomes Vonn Dalurieths guest, who has a task for him.
