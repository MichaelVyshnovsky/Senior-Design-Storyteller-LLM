It was later reissued as book five of the [[Legend of Drizzt]] series.\n\n{{quote|''\"Yer eyes'll shine when ye see the rivers runnin' silver in [[Mithril Hall]]!\"''\n\n''[[Bruenor]] the [[dwarf]], [[Wulfgar]] the barbarian, [[Regis]] the [[halfling]], and [[Drizzt]] the [[drow|dark elf]] fight monsters and magic on their way to Mithril Hall, centuries-old birthplace of Bruenor and his dwarven ancestors.''\n\n''Faced with racism, Drizzt contemplates returning to the lightless underworld city and murderous lifestyle he abandoned. Wulfgar begins to overcome his tribe's aversion for magic. And Regis runs from [[Artemis Entreri|a deadly assassin]], who, allied with evil wizards, is bent on the companions' destruction. All of Bruenor's dreams, and the survival of his party, hinge upon the actions of one brave [[Catti-brie|young woman]].''}}",
        "Summary": "In the first part of the book, the four companions [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], [[Wulfgar]] and [[Regis]], set out on their quest for [[Mithral Hall]]. From [[Icewind Dale]] they first reach the city of [[Luskan]]. There Drizzt and Bruenor have to deal with [[Whisper (Luskan)|Whisper]] and her gang to obtain a map of that area of the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]], while Regis and Wulfgar get involved in a tavern brawl. The party then crosses the [[Crags]] where they have to face a band of [[orc]]s and the [[Uthgardt]] of the [[Sky Pony]] tribe, which unleashes a Spiritual Beast against them.\n\n[[Artemis Entreri]], who is hunting for Regis, captures and interrogates [[Catti-brie|Catti-brie.]] He learns of their quest from her and goes on the party's trail bringing her along.  Also [[Dendybar the Mottled]], a wizard of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] who is interested in the companions, believes Drizzt is in possession of [[Crenshinibon]]. The assassin and the wizard end up joining forces.\n\nIn the second part of the book the four companions visit [[Longsaddle]] and the [[Harpell]]s, a group of eccentric wizards, who suggest they head for [[Silverymoon]]. On their way though they have to cross the deadly [[Evermoors]].\n\nIn the meantime. Entreri and Catti-brie, together with [[Jierdan]], [[Sydney]], and [[Bok]], respectively a soldier, the apprentice of Dendybar and the wizard's [[flesh golem]], fly magically to Silverymoon, having learned of the companions destination from [[Harkle Harpell]].\n\nOnce outside Silverymoon, Drizzt and friends aren't allowed to enter the city, but Lady [[Alustriel]] meets the [[drow]] and gives him some equipment and good advice, telling him to seek information about Mithral Hall at the [[Herald's Holdfast]].\n\nThe four friends are spotted by Bok the golem, which was standing outside the city, and Entreri's party immediately set on their trail, with Catti-brie trying to turn Jierdan against the rest of the group.\n\nIn the third part of the book, Bruenor, thanks to information found in the Herald's Holdfast and to a potion from Alustriel, lives again his past and he is able to remember the location of Mithral Hall.\n\nIn the meantime, Catti-brie turns Jierdan against the rest of the party and she is able to escape in the commotion of the resulting fight and to join her friends.\n\nThe companions enter Mithral Hall and find it overrun by enemies. Their next goal is leaving the place safely. There they are finally reached by Entreri's party. The fight leads to Entreri and Drizzt being separated from the rest of their parties and being forced to work together to find their way out.\n\nBruenor and friends defeat their opponents but they are soon faced by the [[Shadow dragon]] [[Shimmergloom]]. The companions rejoin Drizzt and manage to survive the encounter and defeat the dragon. In the process Bruenor falls in a gorge and apparently falls to his death. Entreri captures Regis and Guenhwyvar's statuette and escapes from the companions.\n\nThe book ends with Drizzt and Wulfgar ready to hunt for Entreri and Catti-brie, with the help of the dwarves and the Harpells, plans to conquer Mithral Hall in an attempt to avenge Bruenor.",
