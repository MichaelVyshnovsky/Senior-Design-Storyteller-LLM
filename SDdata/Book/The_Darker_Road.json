But the trail leads him and his companions far from Ikkemu and the [[Shadowfell]].''\n\n'''''The only thing thicker than darkness is blood'''''\n\n''The companions find themselves deep in the frozen kingdom of [[Rashemen]], where similarly strange attacks are happening among the secretive masked witches of the steppes. Picking apart the threads, they chance into a history as bloody and unforgiving as their own, the untangling of which may solve both Ikkemu and Rashemon's plights.''\n\n'''''Or prove their mutual destruction.'''''}}"
