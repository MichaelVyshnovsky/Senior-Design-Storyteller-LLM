'''''Dungeon Delve''''' is a sourcebook for the 4{{th}}-edition ruleset of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' in the core setting.

{{Quote|''Dungeon Delve'' provides the DM with an array of small, easy-to-run dungeons each specifically designed for a night of gaming.

''This book is designed for groups looking for an exciting night of monster-slaying without the prep time. It contains dozens of self-contained, easy-to-run mini-dungeons, or "delves", each one crafted for a few hours of game-play.''

The book includes delves for 1st- to 30th-level characters, and features dozens of iconic monsters for the heroes to battle. Dungeon Masters can run these delves as one-shot adventures or weave them into the campaign.}}
