'''''Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate''''' was a [[book]] penned by [[Volothamp Geddarm]], available in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''This volume is startlingly accurate, save for the nonsense about the Black Dragon Gate. It is NOT alive, no matter how many vagrant hags claim otherwise. Commission someone else to draw the map.''|[[Elminster Aumar]]'s notes in ''Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate''.}}

==Contents==
Likely surprisingly for many, given Volo's previous works, ''Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate'' was a staggeringly accurate guidebook of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It held multitudes of stories about the city's grimy streets, information about its many rowdy taverns, and accounts of strange characters who inhabited the Gate.

According to Elminster, who edited Volothamp Geddarm's manuscript, the writer claimed that the [[Black Dragon Gate]], which divided [[Blackgate]] from the entirety of the [[Upper City]], was a living being, to which Elminster disagreed. The manuscript also featured a hand-drawn map of the city, penned by Volo's own hand, to which Elminster commented that the author needed to hire a mapmaker for the task.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of the manuscript could be found discarded by Volo in the ruins of [[Moonhaven]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
