Volos Guide to Baldurs Gate was a book penned by Volothamp Geddarm, available in the late 15 century DR.
Likely surprisingly for many, given Volos previous works, Volos Guide to Baldurs Gate was a staggeringly accurate guidebook of the city of Baldurs Gate. It held multitudes of stories about the citys grimy streets, information about its many rowdy taverns, and accounts of strange characters who inhabited the Gate.
According to Elminster, who edited Volothamp Geddarms manuscript, the writer claimed that the Black Dragon Gate, which divided Blackgate from the entirety of the Upper City, was a living being, to which Elminster disagreed. The manuscript also featured a hand-drawn map of the city, penned by Volos own hand, to which Elminster commented that the author needed to hire a mapmaker for the task.
In the , a copy of the manuscript could be found discarded by Volo in the ruins of Moonhaven in the Western Heartlands.
