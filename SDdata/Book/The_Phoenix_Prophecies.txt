'''''The Phoenix Prophecies''''' was a collection of prophecies from the great [[Nar'ysr]] of [[Calimshan]], composed by the [[Heralds of Faer没n|Herald]] [[Heralds (local)|Swordswreath]].

==Description==
''The Phoenix Prophecies'' was a seven-volume collection of over 8,000 prophecies. The prophecies made predictions about matters both important and unimportant. Swordswreath organized the Phoenix Prophecies into various groups, the most notable being the Caleph Auguries and the Eclipse Prophecies.

===Caleph Auguries===
There were 22 prophecies in all that Swordwreath composed into this group, considered some of the most cryptic prophecies ever received. These auguries roughly foretold the history of Calimshan, including its nine [[Ages of Calimshan|Ages]]. In fact, the titles of Calimshan's ages were derived from the auguries themselves.

Of the 22 Auguries, fourteen were believed to have already been fulfilled by [[1370 DR]]. The remaining eight prophecies were Auguries 12, 14, 16 through 19, 21, and 22. The sage [[Elminster Aumar]] had many theories about the meanings of the remaining auguries.

====12{{th}} Augury====
{{Quote|''A man shall enter where Gods Do Not Dare Tread with a keffiyeh of cloth, yet not of cloth. Upon his return, the keffiyeh shall rest upon die brow of the most worthy man, for with him shall come enlightenment.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
He was told that the prophecy was attributed to the phrophet [[Alim yn Atsel al Dian]]. The man was important in [[Calimshan]] and wore a creature from the [[Burning Lands]], known as a ''"[[vizier's turban]]"''. However, after a meeting with the man, [[Elminster]] concluded that this was not the truth.

====14{{th}} Augury====
{{Quote|''A woman with eyes of moonlit snow shall gaze upon the land and find it wanting. Pain will follow in time, for displeasing this lady shall always bear grave consequences. Her anger eclipses all others, darkening the day to night and lighting the night sky with her fury.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
Though Elminster had known six women with eyes like this, [[Iyraclea|Iraclea the Ice Queen]], [[Synmara Eldenbow|Synmara Eldenbow of Myth Drannor]], [[Darthleene|Darthleene of Berdusk]], [[Dlatha Faenar|Dlatha Fae nar of the Spirestars]], [[Simbul|Simbul of Aglarond]], and [[Saranla Bhevik|Saranla Bhevik of Lheshayl]], he did not think any fit the prophecy, rather attributing it to a [[god]]'s [[avatar]].

====16{{th}} Augury====
{{Quote|''The sun shall rise to guide the outcasts home to their fathers' houses to claim seats at table once more. This dawn brings pros perity for some, ruin for others, and while the sun is bright, the land lies swathed in darkness by another's hand.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
This prophecy was too vague to be solved by Elminster.

====17{{th}} Augury====
{{Quote|''The Penumbrannar in shadows work. The Penumbrannar in times grow and thrive. When three rings their homes find, they shall stalk the lands anew. Until the child of centuries faces fear itself and accepts it, the Penumbrannar shall bring ruin to elf and man.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
The Penumbrannar was the name of many groups of Calishite raiders. Elminster thought that a faction called the Penumbrannar might form in the future to rightfully claim the prophecy. 

====18{{th}} Augury====
{{Quote|''The sun shall rise upon the seas, and the seas' vengeance shall be made plain. Water eclipses earth as ignorance eclipses reason. Only with tears of love and songs of understanding shall the land and sea deter the wrath of both and survive the day until nightfall ends the tumult.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
Elminster came to the conclusion that this could describe many different floods during the centuries, and grew tired of waiting at the sea.

====19{{th}} Augury====
{{Quote|''When Winter's Lion meets Summer's Scourge, two of and not of a kind shall pass from the land to be reborn as enemies ever.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
Elminster did not know what this prophecy meant, though he praised its enigmatic writing.

====21{{st}} Augury====
{{Quote|''Seven stars rise blue and ivory, three tears fall gold and royal, darkness among seven silver stars once more, and three above shall cry.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
This prophecy seemed easily solved by the assumption that it spoke of [[Mystra]], [[Sel没ne]], and [[Talona]], but, as Elminster cautioned, whichever answers came easiest to the oracles were, most often, the wrong ones.

====22{{nd}} Augury====
{{Quote|''And he shall come from a great house of pain with hair of spun gold and eyes of the sea. He shall break the bonds that hold him, light the end of Oppression's Road for many, and free the tortured peoples from the evil grip of bondage.''}}
=====Elminster's Interpretation=====
Elminster did not have a real solution for this prophecy. He simply stated that the prophecy brought hope to many temples and slaves.

===Eclipse Prophecies===

}}
Nearly a third of the Nar'ysr's prophecies involved metaphors about eclipses, and more than 300 of these were collectively called the Eclipse Prophecies. Almost all of them had to do with battles and wars. These prophecies successfully predicted the [[Genie Wars]], the [[Twelve Peak Wars]], the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]], the [[Time of Troubles]], and the [[Tuigan Horde]]. About fifteen of the prophecies remained unfulfilled by 1370 DR.

==History==
''The Phoenix Prophecies'' was the first non-[[Calishite]] recording of the Nar'ysr's predictions. It was composed in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]] by the then-current Herald Swordswreath. She collected the prophecies from among several now-lost sources and the memories of an [[Abbalaya]]r prophet named [[Kadh al Mjol|Kadh yn Ororm al Mjol]].

==Locations==
The original copy of ''The Phoenix Prophecies'' still existed in [[Herald's Holdfast]] as late as 1370 DR. Copies also could be found in [[Candlekeep]], [[Calimport]], [[Silverymoon]], and [[Waterdeep]].
