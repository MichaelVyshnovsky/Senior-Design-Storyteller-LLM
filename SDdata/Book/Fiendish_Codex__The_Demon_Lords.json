        "mainbody": "The '''''Fiendish Codex: The Demon Lords''''' was a [[book|tome]] that collected known lore about the rulers of the infinite layers of the [[Abyss]], published some time before [[1373 DR]].",
        "Contents": "The book opens with a description of the Abyss, the realm of malice and chaos, the main habitat of [[demon]]s. It stated that each of the infinite layers held new and unique dangers, making them uninhabitable to anyone but the beasts of the [[Lower planes]], as diverse as their rulers. The hazards included swamps, constantly ablaze swamps, mountains of moving and crushing ice, strangling caverns, and lands of void and emptiness.\n\nNext, the tome talked about how demon lords were born and made, elevated by their own evil, from the crowds of their kin. Some of them were so powerful; they lorded over lords â€“ capping themselves [[demon prince]]s. The tome stated that all demonic titles were self-proclaimed and held little standards nor qualification due to the realm's chaotic nature. Each of these demon lords held control of at least one layer, and the ''Fiendish Codex'' went into detailing the domains of the said rulers.\n\nThe next part talked about the wars demon lords waged against each other, as infinite as the Abyss. [[Demogorgon]] was believed to be the most powerful Prince of Demons, the title constantly contested by [[Graz'zt]] and [[Orcus]]. Lastly, the book talked about all demon lords having smatterings of cults and worshipers of various sized all around the Realms. Each cult sought to elevate its demonic patrons to the status of true divinity through worship and sacrifice.",
        "History": "Copies of the ''Fiendish Codex: The Demon Lords'' circulated in the region of the [[Moonsea]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, during the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis and the blockade of [[Zhentil Keep]]."
