{{quote|''The [[Hammer of Tyr|holy hammer]] of the Church of [[Tyr]] was captured by the evil god [[Bane]] two decades ago. When Bane was destroyed, the relic vanished. The legacy of recovering the lost item was granted to a [[paladin]] before his birth.''

''Now the [[Kern Desanea|young warrior]] must fulfill his destiny and return the enchanted hammer to the forces of good in the land of the [[Moonsea]]. Danger, deception, and loyal friends will accompany him on his fateful journey.''}}

==Summary==
[[Kern Desanea|Kern]], son of [[Shal Desanea|Shal Bal]] and [[Tarl Desanea|Tarl]], sets out to recover the [[Hammer of Tyr]]. The city of [[Phlan]] has greatly decayed in its absence, with many clerics of [[Tyr]] suffering, including Tarl, who went blind. He is joined by [[Listle Onopordum]], Shal’s apprentice who is secretly an illusion come to life, [[Miltiades]], [[Ren o' the Blade]] and his daughter [[Daile Redfletching]], [[Evaine]] and [[Gamaliel]], and Sirana, the daughter of the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] Markus and an [[erinyes]] who claimed her mother’s power and secretly sought the hammer for herself. Sirana is drawing power from the Pool of Twilight, a primordial chaos force that is guarded by a black dragon called Dusk, who tries to lure Sirana in to take his place. Along the way they encounter an old paladin calling himself Trooper, who trains Tarl, and Ren falls in combat with a demon. Eventually, Tarl slays the [[osyluth]] guarding the hammer, recovers it, and defeats Dusk and Sirana. Evaine destroys the pool. Miltiades is restored to life in exchange for Trooper’s and accompanies Evaine on her quest. The Hammer of Tyr is returned and Phlan begins to recover.
