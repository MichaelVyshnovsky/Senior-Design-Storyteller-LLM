        "Description": "Although it was a grim work, it was not much more than a listing of names and palaces, for the horrors within them were too much to set down on [[paper]]. It was written in a strange and hesitant hand, and bound in a black cover.\n\nNotably, in it Urgund made mention of the [[Seven Lost Gods]] of antiquity and their service to the god [[Bane]], the Black Lord. He wrote \"...and seated foremost in the Hall of Minor Courtiers were the [[Lesser deity|lesser powers]]: [[Maram of the Great Spear]]; [[Haask, Voice of Hargut]]; [[Tyranthraxus|Tyranthraxus the Flamed One]]; [[Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud]]; and [[Camnod the Unseen]]. These too fell down and became servants of the great lord Bane.\"",
        "Notable Owners": "A copy of ''Urgund's Description of Darkness'' was stored in the philosophy section of [[Mantor's Library]] in [[Phlan]] around [[1340 DR]]."
