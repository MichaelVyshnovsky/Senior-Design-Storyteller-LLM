Wizard Hunting Season is a novella by Ed Greenwood first published in the 1999 anthology Silverfall.
The Simbul calls four apprentices together and turns over the rule of Aglarond to them, while she begins hunting Red Wizards. She kills Roeblen through a trapped scrying orb, then kills Azymrandyr along with his apprentices, who are training to replace prominent citizens in Nimpeth. She also kills several nearby priests of Shar and other Red Wizards. She then confronts Thaltar, seemingly dying in combat with him. Auvrarn is cared for by a mysterious mage with a green ring, who pulled him out of Blandras Nuinâ€™s house after the Simbul destroyed it. Thaltar claims a wand from the body and brings it to a meeting of conspirators, including Red Wizards and Sharran clergy, gathered to address the recent deaths of Roeblen and Azymrandyr. The Simbul, having faked her death, emerges from the wand and kills all present, while the mage caring for Auvrarn watches from an orb above. Wounded, the Simbul calls on Elminster for aid.
