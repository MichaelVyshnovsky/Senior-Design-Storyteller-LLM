        "mainbody": "set of trigram sticks would typically be kept in a jar, from which they could be spilled to produce the patterns. This was kept alongside a copy of the ''Book of Changes''. An expensive set comprised rosewood sticks in a [[jade]] jar, together with a hand-scribed book.",
        "History": "Legend told that Hsin Fu Chan discerned the trigrams from patterns in the back of a great lizard as it slept. After this inauspicious start, the trigrams were developed over time into a more sophisticated, less lizard-based method.",
        "Usage": "Use of the ''Book of Change'' was common to all levels of [[Shou]] society. However, using it was seen as a weakness in the [[Mandarinate]], and mandarins would be embarrassed to reveal they did anything more than play with it.\n\nIt was also an important aspect of the [[magic]] wielded by priests of [[the Way]]. It functioned rather like the spell ''[[fate (spell)|fate]]'' known to [[shukenja]], but could be used by anyone without magic, though perhaps less reliably.\n\nBy [[1357 DR]], it was common for one to toss a handful of broken and whole [[chopsticks]] into a circle, and choose six from the top, producing a pattern of broken and unbroken lines. The user then consulted the ''Book of Change'', finding two out of six possible trigrams that best matched the pattern. Each of the eleven possible combinations corresponded to a symbol and an explanation or recommendation for the future; those in the middle were more common than those at the extremes.\n\n{|border=\"1\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin-left:5px;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| '''Value'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| '''Symbol'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| '''Meaning'''\n|-\n| 2 || Destruction || \"Forces are at hand to unmake your fortunes.

        "Notable Users": "* [[Ju-Hai Chou]], Minister of State of [[Shou Lung]], was a firm believer in the trigrams.\n* [[Ting Mei Wan]], Minister of State Security in [[1359 DR]], spilled his sticks and he read the Sea trigram, describing that she was always shifting and unpredictable, making her a dangerous friend and a powerful enemy."
