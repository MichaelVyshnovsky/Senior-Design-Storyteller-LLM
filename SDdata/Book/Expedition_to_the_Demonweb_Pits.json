The adventure was influenced by the 1-edition adventure module, Queen of the Demonweb Pits.\nExpedition to the Demonweb Pits revolves around the reading of the Dark Pact. The demon lord Grazzt seeks to form an alliance with Lolth against Orcus. Lolth spurns his offer, and Grazzt, not taking rejection lightly, now schemes to undermine Lolth. With the aid of his cambion son, Rule-of-Three, Grazzt plans a Demon Council within the Abyss. While he is doing this, Rule-of-Three spreads word among the drow that their goddess is coming to the Prime Material Plane to wage the eternity war against their hated cousins, the surface elves and their god, Corellon Larethian. \nAfter the Demonic Council is arranged, Rule-of-Three and Grazzt involve a group of mortals (the PCs) about Lolths coming. Their goal is to bring attention to Lolth in her own Demonweb and then use the mortals to embarrass her in the eyes of the other demon lords, while at the same time, sealing the Dark Pact of planar binding using the divine spark Lolth gives it. It is the PCs goal to prevent the reading of that pact. \naspect of Grazzt • aspect of Obox-ob • aspect of Yeenoghu •  • corrupted by the Abyss • dabus • demons (cambion • carnevus • oculus) • envoy of Lolth • abyssal giant •  • lamia noble • mirror mephit • ratatosk • viper tree, elder • wild hunter\nExpedition to the Demonweb Pits Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Designers Wolfgang Baur, Gwendolyn F.M.
