        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], ''Pipeweed Dreams'' was performed by the god [[Milil]], the Lord of All Songs. He imposed the beautiful song on an audience of [[Sensates]] from [[Sigil]] who were performing a ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' ritual to experience the forbidden experience of spying on [[Toril]]lian deities. The song's infectious melody caused many in the audience hum and sing along."
