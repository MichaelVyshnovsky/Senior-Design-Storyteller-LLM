        "mainbody": "'''''The Hound and the Hand''''' was a [[book]] of the [[Tyrran]] faith printed sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Of course Kezef had not accounted for the strength of the chain, which was rooted in hellish Cocytus and blessed by the Goddess of magic, Mystra. Unable to break free, he bit Tyr's hand clean off, and Tyr sealed the bleeding stump, and walked one-handed forevermore, as if it were a badge of honor, which indeed it was, and boldness and courage besides.''|Excerpt from ''The Hound and the Hand''}}",
        "Contents": "The book retold the story of how the deity of law [[Tyr]] lost his hand to the primordial evil of [[Kezef]] the Chaos Hound. The story talked about how the gods stood united against Kezef, forcing him to the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]]. They ended up offering the primordial a deal: if Kezef was able to break [[chain]]s forged by [[Gond]], using [[Cocytus]] metal, and reinforced by [[Mystra]]'s magic, then the hound would be left alone by the deities. Kezef agreed, but only if Tyr held his hand in the hound's mouth. Kezef knew that he would not be able to break free but if he were to be chained, he could take Tyr's hand. Since then, the Maimed God was one-handed.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''The Hound and the Hand'' could be found in the library of the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]] in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], stored near the altar and statue dedicated to Tyr."
