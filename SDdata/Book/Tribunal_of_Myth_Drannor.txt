'''''Tribunal of Myth Drannor''''' was the voluminous collection of court records of esteemed [[human]] judge [[Rothilion]] the Honorable.

==Description==
The ''Tribunal of Myth Drannor'' consisted of many volumes that could completely take over a small archive library. The large and heavy books were made using parchment, and bound in masterwork leather covers. Each volume had its name written in [[common]] or [[elven]] on its spine, along with the date ranges of the volume.

==History==
One copy of the ''Tribunal of Myth Drannor'' set of volumes was placed inside the [[Crypt of Rothilion]], in its library room. Upon Rothilion's death of old age, he was buried in a large crypt in [[Myth Drannor]]'s [[Polyandrium]] that matched his status. Unfortunately, some of the defensive and preserving enchantments placed on the crypt were faulty, expediting the aging of all the materials inside the tomb. 

By [[1369 DR]], the copies of the ''Tribunal of Myth Drannor'' locked in the crypt were mostly destroyed by the ravages of time, their parchment disintegrating upon opening. The volumes could be restored using the ''[[make whole]]'' spell.
