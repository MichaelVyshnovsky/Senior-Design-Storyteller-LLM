'''''The Simbul's Gift''''', by [[Lynn Abbey]], is the sixth and last book in the loosely-connected [[The Nobles]] series.

{{quote|''The perfect gift.''

''Is it the one given or the one received?''

''[[The Simbul]], Storm-queen of [[Aglarond]], is unhappy. Though she has triumphed over her enemies, she lacks an heir to the throne—a child to love and nurture. But now she's found the perfect father for her child: [[Elminster]], the old mage of [[Shadowdale]]. All she has to do is win his consent.''

''And she has the perfect gift with which to accomplish this: A mysterious colt called [[Zandilar's Dancer]].''

''Unfortunately, the colt belongs to [[Ebroin]] of the [[Cha'Tel'Quessir]]. And getting it away from him won't be easy, even for the Simbul...''}}

==Summary==
[[Simbul|The Simbul]] rules [[Aglarond]] while thinking of her lover Lailomum Zerad, who had been killed by [[Mythrellan|Mythrell'aa]], a Red Wizard who became [[Zulkir]] of [[Illusion]]. 

Abroin, a half-elf who moved out of the [[Yuirwood]] with his mother Shali after his father fell to his death, helps his human stepfather, Adentir, birth a horse. The horse’s mother was mysteriously impregnated after a trip to the Yuirwood, and after its birth, he experiences a vision of [[Zandilar]], a lost [[Yuir]] goddess. 

The Simbul becomes aware and watches from afar. She plans to claim the horse, named Zandilar’s Dancer, to use it to convince [[Elminster]] to help her have a child. Her nephew, [[Boesild Aerasumé]], warns her of [[Thay|Thayan]] infiltrators in [[Nethra]]. 

Zulkirs scheme against the Simbul and each other, including [[Lauzoril]], Zulkir of [[Enchantment]] (and his undead father and grandfather, Chazsinal and Gweltaz, and [[Aznar Thrul]], Zulkir of [[Evocation|Invocation]], and his spy Neema Gaz. These two sent agents to Nethra, who avoided the Simbul’s notice and only became discovered when they attacked each other. 

Agents of Mythrell’aa attack Sulaik, killing Shali and Adentir. The Simbul flees with Zandilar’s Dancer, accidentally bringing along Abroin and his human sister Taefaeli and traveling through time into the Yuirwood. The Simbul returns to [[Veltalar|Velprintalar]] with Taefali, while Abroin encounters what appears to be his father, who says he will return the Yuir gods and remove Aglarond’s humans. It is revealed that Lailomum is still alive, a prisoner of Mythrell’aa. Laozoril begins teaching his daughter Mimuay magic. 

The Simbul meets [[Alustriel Silverhand]] and travels to [[Everlund]], to question [[Evermeet]] sages about Zandilar. Mythrell’aa calls for a Convocation of Zulkirs. Neema turns against Aznar after she feels disrespected. Reznar leads a group of elves through the forest, followed by the Simbul, a forester in her service named Trovar Halaern, wizards sent by Aznar Thrul, and Mythrell’aa. 

Ferrin, a spirit that has been communicating with Mimuay, is absorbed by Gweltaz, so Laozoril destroys Chazsinal and Gweltaz and goes to the Yuirwood after his daughter sees Abroin while scrying on a dagger, once given to the Simbul until she passed it onto Abroin, and wants to protect him. The Simbul kills all the Red Wizards in the forest but Mythrell’aa. Thrul discovers Neema’s betrayal and kills her, as well as Deaizul, her master who had been possessing Reznar. They convene at the Sunglade, where the Simbul dances and awakens the Yuir gods’ remnants. Mythrell’aa arrives and sends Lailomum with a destruction spell to kill the Simbul, but Laozoril frees him and strikes Mythrell’aa so that Lailomum is able to kill her instead. The Simbul realizes that there is an old Yuir god also named [[The Simbul (Yuir)|The Simbul]].
