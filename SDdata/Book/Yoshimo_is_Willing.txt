'''''Yoshimo is Willing''''' was a short novel of revisionist history and erotic adventures found in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Contents==
The book contained a sensational, ahistorical, and very erotic account of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Yoshimo]] and his adventures with the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Rather than betraying the Bhaalspawn, the book's presented the possibility that Yoshimo was in fact very loyal and very willing to do whatever Abdel wished, with exciting and erotic results.

==History==
A copy was kept in the library of the [[Sharess' Caress]] brothel in [[1492 DR]].
