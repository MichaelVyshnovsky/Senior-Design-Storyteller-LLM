And what interest does the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] have in the tiny barony of [[Bloodstone Pass]]?''\n\n''With this adventure, your player characters inherit an entire barony—with a recently-reopened mine that produces immense wealth. Wealth enough to attract the dangerous attention of their neighbors... wealth enough to attract the attention of the [[Zhengyi|Witch-King]] of [[Vaasa]]... and Orcus himself!''\n\n''Now, your tiny barony is the pivotal point in a war that threatens to engulf the entire [[Forgotten Realms]]. Take command, and defend yourself against the encroachment of the evil, demonic forces of the nightmare realm of Vaasa.\nA large, four-color map of the region makes your new realm come alive. Wild and woolly BATTLESYSTEM scenarios (with options if you're not into miniatures) give you the full range of battlefield excitement!''\n\n''Come learn why high-level AD&D game play can be much more than just monster bashing. The Army of Bloodstone wants you!''}}",
        "Description": "''The Bloodstone Wars'' was published in 1987, the same year the [[Forgotten Realms]] became an official campaign setting, and was one of the first Forgotten Realms adventures. Like the previous titles in the [[Bloodstone Pass series]], ''The Bloodstone Wars'' features the [[Wikia:Battlesystem|Battlesystem]] tabletop rules.\n\n''The Bloodstone Wars'' makes considerable use of some rules that were removed in 2{{nd}} edition, notably the [[assassin]] character class. There are two main parts of the module, the [[Bloodstone Wars]] itself which includes preparation and fighting out Battlesystem battles, and a small \"dungeon\" adventure which could occur at several points of the war. While the module provides alternatives for those who do not want to use miniatures to fight out the battles, the Battlesystem scenarios take a considerable portion of the module information.",
