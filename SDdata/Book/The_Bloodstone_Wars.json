        "mainbody": "The Bloodstone Wars is a 1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure.\nThe Bloodstone Wars was published in 1987, the same year the Forgotten Realms became an official campaign setting, and was one of the first Forgotten Realms adventures. Like the previous titles in the Bloodstone Pass series, The Bloodstone Wars features the Battlesystem tabletop rules.\nThe Bloodstone Wars makes considerable use of some rules that were removed in 2 edition, notably the assassin character class. There are two main parts of the module, the Bloodstone Wars itself which includes preparation and fighting out Battlesystem battles, and a small \"dungeon\" adventure which could occur at several points of the war. While the module provides alternatives for those who do not want to use miniatures to fight out the battles, the Battlesystem scenarios take a considerable portion of the module information.\n* Introduction\n* Prologue\n* Chapter 1 The Barons Treasure\n* Chapter 2 Return of the Assassins\n* Chapter 3 Battles of Bloodstone\n* Chapter 4 The Assassins Run\n* Epilogue\n* Appendix Dramatis Personae\n* Appendix Pregenerated Player Characters\n • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nCountries \nMountains \nRoads \nSettlements \nValleys \n • \nItems \nVehicles \nWeapons"
