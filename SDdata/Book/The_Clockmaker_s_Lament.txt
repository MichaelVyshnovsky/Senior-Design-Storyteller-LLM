{{Quote|
My youth did tick away in vain,<br />
As I toiled at my trade.<br />
Had I the hours back again,<br />
Such mischief I'd have made...<br />
...for minutes pass in triple-time<br />
Hunched o'er a carver's bench.<br />
Far better had I stopped my hands<br />
To drink, and fight, and wench...<br />
no second chance will I have now<br />
My winding spring has sprung!<br />
That tolling is no call to prayer&mdash;<br />
Too soon, my death knell's rung.<br />

==History==
