Seventy Stirring Stories was a set of classic tales that enjoyed great popularity in the Heartlands of the Realms.
The stories within were drawn from the widespread tavern-tales of the Sword Coast North, and featured thrilling adventures, monsters, romance, and revenge.
Seventy Stirring Stories remained very popular in the 14 century DR, and was endlessly retold, abridged, and recompiled by many authors.
