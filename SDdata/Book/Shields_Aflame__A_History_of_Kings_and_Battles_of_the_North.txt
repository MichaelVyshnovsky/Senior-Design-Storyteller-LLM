'''''Shields Aflame: A History of Kings and Battles of the North''''', was an authoritative book of the history of the [[Sword Coast North]], very popular in the [[Heartlands]] of the [[Realms]].

==Description==
The book was quite small but very thick, and often suffered from the bindings breaking, resulting in the loose stack of pages being tied together or kept in a box.

==Contents==
''Shields Aflame'' was a scholarly history of the rulers and battles of the Sword Coast North. Not just a dry collection of facts, it was well written and entertaining, adding to its popularity.

==History==
The book was very popular in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and was widely used as an encylopedic reference, as well as simply a source of interesting topics to discuss or muse over. It was reprinted in a new (but identical) edition by an [[Athkatla]]n printer who included a threat on the flyleaf, promising a "dark curse" upon anyone who copied the work.
