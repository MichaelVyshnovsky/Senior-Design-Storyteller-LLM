            "TSR": "In 1975, [[TSR, Inc.|TSR.]] began publishing ''The Strategic Review''. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself. The following year, after only seven issues, TSR cancelled ''The Strategic Review'' and replaced it with ''The Dragon'', which later became ''Dragon'' with [[Dragon magazine 39|issue #39]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/22/Dragon Rumbles}}\n[[File:Dragon_magazine_39.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of [[Dragon magazine 39|''Dragon'' #39]] from 1980]]\nA compilation of the first 250 issues was released; also included were the 7 issues of ''The Strategic Review''. This compilation is known as the software title ''Dragon Magazine Archive''.",
            "Wizards of the Coast": "[[Wizards of the Coast]] purchased TSR and its intellectual properties, including ''Dragon'', in 1997. Production was then transferred from Wisconsin to Washington state. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by [[wikipedia:Hasbro|Hasbro]], ''Dragon'' suffered a five-month gap between [[Dragon magazine 236|#236]] and [[Dragon magazine 237|#237]] but remained published by TSR as a subsidiary of WotC starting September 1997 with [[Dragon magazine 239|issue #239]],<ref>''[[Dragon magazine 239|issue #239]]''(1997-09) and until [[Dragon magazine 267|#267]] in January 2000 when Wizards of the Coast became the listed ''de facto'' publisher.<ref>''[[Dragon magazine 267|#267]]'' (2000-01)",
            "Paizo Publishing": "In 2002, [[Paizo Publishing]] acquired the rights to publish both ''Dragon'' and '' Dungeon'' under license from Wizards of the Coast. '' Dragon'' was published by Paizo starting September 2002 with [[Dragon magazine 299|issue #299]]. It tied ''Dragon'' more closely to ''Dungeon'' by including articles supporting and promoting its major multi-issue adventures such as the \"Age of Worms\" and \"Savage Tide\". \"Class Acts\", monthly one- or two-page articles offering ideas for developing specific character classes, were also introduced by Paizo.\n\nOn April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that it would not be renewing Paizo's licenses for ''Dragon''. The final printed issue was [[Dragon magazine 359|#359]] in September 2007.\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/news/20070419a\n| title = Paizo Publishing to Cease Publication of DRAGON and DUNGEON\n| accessdate = 2007-04-19\n| date = 2007-04-19\n\n}}\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://paizo.com/transition\n| title = Dragon and Dungeon Transition\n| accessdate = 2007-04-20\n| date = 2007-04-20\n\n}}",

        "Special issues": "In the magazine's early years, ''Dragon'' published five \"Best of\" issues, reprinting highly regarded articles from ''The Strategic Review'' and ''The Dragon''.
