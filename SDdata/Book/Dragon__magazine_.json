        "mainbody": "ragon is one of the two official magazines for source material for the Forgotten Realms, first published in 1976. Its sister publication is Dungeon magazine.\nTSR\nIn 1975, TSR. began publishing The Strategic Review. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of Dungeons & Dragons made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself. The following year, after only seven issues, TSR cancelled The Strategic Review and replaced it with The Dragon, which later became Dragon with issue #39.\nthumb|200px|right|Cover of Dragon #39 from 1980\nA compilation of the first 250 issues was released also included were the 7 issues of The Strategic Review. This compilation is known as the software title Dragon Magazine Archive.\nWizards of the Coast\nWizards of the Coast purchased TSR and its intellectual properties, including Dragon, in 1997.

Dragon was published by Paizo starting September 2002 with issue #299. It tied Dragon more closely to Dungeon by including articles supporting and promoting its major multi-issue adventures such as the \"Age of Worms\" and \"Savage Tide\". \"Class Acts\", monthly one- or two-page articles offering ideas for developing specific character classes, were also introduced by Paizo.\nOn April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that it would not be renewing Paizos licenses for Dragon. The final printed issue was #359 in September 2007.\nDigital\nShortly after the last print issue shipped, Wizards of the Coast re-launched Dragon as an online magazine, continuing the issue numbering of the print edition.

Created by Dialect in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, the online edition ceased continuity with the printed and digital versions of both magazines and restarted its numbering system for issues at No. 1.\nAlthough Dragon was originally designed to support the roleplaying industry in general, it has always been primarily a house organ for role-playing games with a particular focus on D&D.\nMost of the magazines articles provide supplementary material for the game including new prestige classes, races, monsters and many other subjects that can be used to enhance a Dungeons & Dragons game.
