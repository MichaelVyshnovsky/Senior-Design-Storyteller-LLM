        "Contents": "''The Neverwinter Wood'' was a huge and heavy time that claimed to contain the full history of the Neverwinter Wood, the forest to the north of the city of [[Neverwinter]]. The contents of the entire book could be summarized by saying that despite many claims and stories of some unknown evil inhabiting the Neverwinter Wood, no researcher could confirm that. The book listed many of the forest's hidden glens protected by mystic guardian forces, but none were determined to be of malicious nature. The tome also claimed that the Neverwinter Wood was never logged in fear of its hidden dark forces. Its reputation was so even [[orc]]ish hordes always circled around the forest instead of entering it.",
        "History": "Copies of ''The Neverwinter Wood'' book could be found around the areas of [[Neverwinter]], [[Daggerford]], and the [[Sword Coast North]]  ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}."
