        "mainbody": "When the Battle is Over was a ballad known and performed in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the ex-Harper bard named Edgin Darvis knew When the Battle is Over and could recite it in his sleep. He often performed the song&mdashamong many others&mdashin public and privately for his wife, but with her death, Edgins desire to perform disappeared. Nine years after the tragedy, in the late 1490s DR, he was finally convinced to try and perform When the Battle is Over at the Trip and Shuffle tavern in Targos, but he overdid it on liquid courage and appeared for the performance drunk. He was able to go through the first several lines of the song before he was overcome with emotions and had to stop, to the tavern patrons heckling, confusion, and a stray baked potato launched at the failed performer. of Edgin performing the song to distract the guards, however his concentration faltered when his foot became stuck in a pothole and the illusion began to repeat and warp in maddening fashion, thus failing to hold the guards attention for long."
