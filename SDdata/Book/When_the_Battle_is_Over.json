        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the ex-[[Harper]] [[bard]] named [[Edgin Darvis]] knew ''When the Battle is Over'' and could recite it in his sleep. He often performed the song&mdash;among many others&mdash;in public and privately for his wife, but with her death, Edgin's desire to perform disappeared. Nine years after the tragedy, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} he was finally convinced to try and perform ''When the Battle is Over'' at the [[Trip and Shuffle]] tavern in [[Targos]], but he overdid it on liquid courage and appeared for the performance drunk. He was able to go through the first several lines of the song before he was overcome with emotions and had to stop, to the tavern patrons' heckling, confusion, and a stray baked [[potato]] launched at the failed performer.{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Thieves' Gallery}} of Edgin performing the song to distract the guards, however his concentration faltered when his foot became stuck in a pothole and the [[illusion]] began to repeat and warp in maddening fashion, thus failing to hold the guards' attention for long.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}"
