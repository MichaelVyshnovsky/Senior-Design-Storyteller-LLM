"An Icy Heart" is a short story by Voronica Whitney-Robinson included in the 2004 anthology Realms of the Dragons.
The dragon turtle Chorael lays her eggs on the banks of Lake Thaylambar. Like the other local dragon turtles, she is concerned about the ongoing Rage of Dragons, and the destruction it could bring to them all. The Cult of the Dragon has approached them promising immunity from the Rage, provided they pledge loyalty to Sammaster. Chorael is skeptical of the Cult, but her mate Dargo feels their proposal has merit. Having laid her eggs, Chorael encounters a drowning fisherman, Gregoire, and saves him. Shortly after returning Gregoire to his boat, Chorael realizes he is no ordinary fisherman, but rather a dragon hunter seeking to steal her eggs. She pursues him and runs afoul of more dragon hunters in ships. She succumbs to the Rage to overcome them, but is killed. Dargo watches the hunters haul Choraels body away. His heart growing cold, he swears he will convince the other dragon turtles to swear fealty to Sammaster so they can avoid Choraels fate.
