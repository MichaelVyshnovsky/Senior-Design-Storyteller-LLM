'''Song of the North''' was a poem composed by an unnamed [[bard]]. It comprised multiple sonnets, including sonnet 5, which detailed the history of [[giant]]s and [[Hartsvale]].

{{quote|In [[Hartsvale]] did the hero [[giant]] rise<br />
And lead the smallfolk 'gainst his tyrannous kin.<br />
The [[Ice Spires|Ice Spire]] tempests filled with rallying cries,<br />
As smallfolks's time in Hartsvale did begin.<br />
The Ice Spire peaks did so the giants claim:<br />
The [[frost giant|frost clans]] by the [[Bleak Plain]] to the north;<br />
The southern range, home to the [[fire giant|giants of flame]];<br />
The [[hill giant]]s to the west (for what they're worth).<br />
In [[Castle Hartwick]], midst the [[Clear Whirl River|Clear Whirl]]'s run,<br />
Now sits the Good King [[Grauman]] on his throne.<br />
With truce 'tween giantkind and smallfolk spun,<br />
The folk of Hartsvale now are on their own.<br />
So long as peace continues in the vale,<br />
So shall the folk of [[Stagwick]] e'er prevail.
|Sonnet 5 of ''Song of the North''}}
