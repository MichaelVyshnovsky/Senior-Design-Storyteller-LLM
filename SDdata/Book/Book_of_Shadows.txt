The '''''Book of Shadows''''' was a [[spellbook]] and [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]] that served as one of the more complete treatises on the dark art of [[necromancy]].

==Contents==
The book contained many dark [[spell]]s related to "black necromancy"&mdash;necromancy spells designed specifically to cause harm to others. These included ''[[Abi-Dalzim's horrid wilting]], [[Beltyn's burning blood]], [[blackmantle]], [[bone blight]], [[bone club]], [[brainkill]], [[chill touch]], [[choke]], [[conflagration]], [[contagion]], [[corpse visage]], [[dead man's eyes]], [[death link]], [[deathshroud]], [[death ward]], [[death spell]], [[defoliate]], [[energy drain]], [[enervation]], [[exterminate]], [[finger of death]], [[flame of justice]], [[ghoul gauntlet]], [[ghoul touch]], [[Grimwald's greymantle]], [[lich touch]], [[mummy rot]], [[mummy touch]], [[pain touch]], [[rain of blood]], [[shadow form]], [[skull trap]], [[suffocate]], [[summon shadow]], [[throbbing bones]], [[vampiric touch]], [[energy drain]]'', and ''[[wail of the banshee]]''.

The tome also included information regarding the raising of [[crawling claw]]s, enslaving evil [[genie]]s, summoning [[fiend]]s from the [[outer planes]], and subjugating multiple [[skeleton warrior]]s simultaneously. Recipes for otherwise forgotten [[poison]]s and necromantic devices were covered within the book, including detailed instructions for creating ''[[gloom candle]]s'' and partial instructions for crafting ''[[bone ring]]s''. It made only a passing reference to the creation of [[crypt thing]]s.

==History==
As Nebt lay in an oubliette awaiting his execution, he shared his thoughts on necromancy with his few minor [[shadow]] [[familiar]]s who had not deserted him, and these servants used that information to create the ''Book of Shadows''. The tome soon began circulating in nearby cities, and was immediately banned. Although many the original copies were rounded up and destroyed by Zakharan authorities, several survived.

The [[Scabrous Society]] used recipes from the book to help them expand their evil operations.
