'''''A Brush with Evil: On Hags''''' was an ecology book that detailed the nature of [[hag]]s. It was written by [[Elizabeth Soot|Elizabeth M. Soot]], published before [[1492 DR]].

{{Quote|And so I rescind my previous guides to dealing with a hag, my suggestions for clever language and deceit. Instead, I offer these owrds should you ever encounter a hag: run. And pray she does not follow.|''Excerpt from A Brush with Evil.''}}

==Content==
The author shared some first-hand experience she had with hags, having been compelled into service by a [[green hag]] for over two years. She wrote about the malign nature of hags, how they lured innocents with a combination of charm and empty promises. They were wholly sadistic creatures who psychologically tortured people that previously trapped. She warned of the dynamics of a hag's coven, how each sister in a group must be feared as much as the captor herself, for none of them ever forgave the slightest perceived insult.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of this book was left in the [[Emerald Grove]] of the [[Western Heartlands]].
