{{quote|''Two Households Both Alike in Dignity''

''Two [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]], [[Angel (astral)|angels]] given mortal flesh, are sent to guard two star-crossed lovers, born scions of rival merchant houses. The devas have worked together through countless cycles of reincarnation, guarding each other's backs as they pursue justice.''

''Break from Ancient Grudge into New Mutiny''

''At first, it looks as though love will conquer all, and the rift between the rival houses will finally be mended. But there are those who hate the word peace with a passion so great that it poisons everything they touch, turning house against house, mother against child, and deva against deva.''

''Leaving Even Angels' Hands Unclean''}}

==Behind the scenes==
* The novel has the distinction of being set farthest in the "future" of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', with much of the action taking place in the [[1600 DR|Year of Unseen Enemies, 1600 DR]]. This is 121 years after the then-current year of the setting and 4th-edition rules, the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR]].
