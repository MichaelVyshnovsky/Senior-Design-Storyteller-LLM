Ardoso A Romance of Magic was a popular book of fiction in the Heartlands of the Realms.
Ardoso was a slender book, and the cover was always decorated in various pseudo-magical symbologies. On occasion, the cover was used to transmit coded messages amid the innocuous nonsense.
The book told the tale of the fictional wizard Ardoso, as he rose from obscurity in his youth to become the ruler of his own realm and a matchless archwizard. Though the story revolved around magical concepts, all of it was complete nonsense made up by the author and had absolutely no use in reality.
Ardoso had famously overdone purple prose verging on poetry, but this turned in favor of its reputation as it generated a number of novel phrases that came into use by other writers and in common speech. These included "all eye-fingered" (describing someone looking about warily in all directions), "gods-kissed" (describing someone struck with a brilliant idea, or possessed of extraordinary natural talent in a skill), "storm-browed" (describing someone glowering furiously), and "dusk-eyed and soft-shouldered" (describing a beautiful woman comporting herself through dress and manner so as to request attention without being flirtatious or demanding).
