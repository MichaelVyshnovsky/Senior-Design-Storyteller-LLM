The Dungeon of Death is an adventure module in the Dungeon Crawl series, written by Jason Carl and published in May 2000. It is set in the titular Dungeon of Death, an abandoned dwarven gem mine turned demon-infested pit.
The adolescent nabassu Visceris has taken command of the Dungeon of Death. He needs to kill four more mortals to unlock his full powers, but wishes only to kill adventurers worthy of his time. It is up to the adventurers to slay the demon, and keep themselves from ending up on his dinner plate.
