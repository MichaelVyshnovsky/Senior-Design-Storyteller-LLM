'''''Hellbound: The Blood War''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' boxed set. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting. 

{{Quote|'''War is hell &ndash; literally.'''
''Since before mortals drew breath, the cunning baatezu and the fiery tanar'ri have struggled furiously to batter each other out of existence. The prize in their devastating war of annihilation: the Lower Planes. 'Course, when two unstoppable armies of evil collide, the tremors might leave the entire multiverse a smoking ruin. And woe be to any berk who stands against them &ndash; or simply gets in their way.''

''Created for both players and Dungeon Masters, ''Hellbound: The Blood War'' is a comprehensive resource on the infernal clash that has torn the planes apart for millennia. Though the war has spilled into many other Pʟᴀɴᴇsᴄᴀᴘᴇ™ products, the full story of the roaring conflict has never been detailed &ndash; until now.''}}
