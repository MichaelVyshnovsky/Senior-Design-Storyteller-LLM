The dwarves succeeded only in creating their own isolation and madness. Their clan grew smaller and ever more degenerate—so that today, only the three brothers who lead the clan and a handful of other dwarves remain.''\n\n''Of the three brothers, Zarnak, the eldest and most powerful, is a seer whose mind shattered long ago when it came into contact with an ancient evil known as the Elder Elemental Eye... and who now plots to spread the [[Abyssal Plague]] throughout the world.''}}\n[[Category:D&D Encounters adventures]]\n[[Category:4th edition adventures]]\n[[Category:Published in 2012]]\n[[Category:Adventures]]\n[[Category:4th edition sourcebooks]]\n[[Category:Sourcebooks]]\n[[Category:Books]]\n[[Category:Works by Pieter Sleijpen]]\n42ry0e8ysvoyus6joq06mkuntmscl5x"
