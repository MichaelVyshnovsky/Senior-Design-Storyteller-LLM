Ah, such an ugly word... think of them instead as kings-in-training. Ye seem upset, even disputatious. Well, then, look upon them as the most honest sort of merchant.''|Excerpt from ''Shards and Swords''}}",
        "Contents": "The play featured a character named Oglar the Thieflord, who defended the profession of thievery. He competed rogues to kings in the making, and claimed they were like merchants, but more honest."
