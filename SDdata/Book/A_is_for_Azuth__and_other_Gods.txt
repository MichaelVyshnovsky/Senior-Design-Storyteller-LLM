'''''A is for Azuth, and other Gods''''' was a collection of childrens' rhymes made to help remember the names and portfolios of the [[deities]] of the [[Realms]].

==Description==
These books were split into several different volumes, each containing a few verses about the gods of [[Faerûn]].

{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}<br/>
===Volume I===
[[Amaunator]], sun's bright light<br />
Shines the truth into man's laws.<br />
Speak His name to stop a fight;<br />
Then, invoke a legal clause.<br />

Beware dread [[Asmodeus]]<br />
Both His word and promise sweet.<br />
More able to betray us<br />
Than the devils at His feet.<br />

[[Auril]] is merciless and cold<br />
the winter's icy breath.<br />
Spare Her a little food and gold;<br />
So you won't freeze to death<br />

===Volume II===
[[Azuth]], the god of wizards all<br />
Who spend their whole lives learning.<br />
He grants their spells both big and small,<br />
For [[Mystra]] always yearning.<br />

[[Bane]] the tyrant, the Black Hand<br />
Makes sure the strong do rule.<br />
He spreads His darkness through the land,<br />
Praised by the harsh and cruel.<br />

[[Beshaba]] will bring forth your doom<br />
Unless you chant Her prayer.<br />
Split from [[Tymora]] in the womb,<br />
She brings bad luck to spare.<br />

===Volume III===
You should not ever pray to [[Bhaal]],<br />
The savage Lord of Murder,<br />
His worshippers are killers all<br />
who spread His darkness further.<br />

[[Chauntea]] is our Mother Great,<br />
Hers is the hearth and home.<br />
Our harvests on Her blessing wait<br />
Thus we reap what we've sown.<br />

[[Cyric]] is the prince of strife,<br />
God of deceit and madness.<br />
Watch for the Dark Sun and His lies,<br />
Who'll rob your bonds of gladness.<br />

===Volume VI===
[[Ilmater]] hears the martyr's cries<br />
Takes in the ill and the oppressed.<br />
When one to help the others dies,<br />
Then by Ilmater they are blessed.<br />

[[Jergal]], or so it's often said,<br />
Once gave away his bony throne.<br />
For Kelemvor he tracks the dead,<br />
Makes sue the dead souls do not roam.<br />

[[Kelemvor]], Lord of the Dead,<br />
Will take your hand when death arrives.<br />
Makes sure souls are correctly lead<br />
To all their proper afterlives.<br />

{{Col-2}}<br/>
===Volume VII===
[[Leira]], Lady of Deception<br />
the goddess who wears many masks.<br />
Invoke Her name - avoid perception<br />
She hides your lies and secret tasks.<br />

For joy, to [[Lliira]] you must call<br />
And worship Her through soulfelt dance.<br />
So find Her presence in festhalls;<br />
Do not give idleness a chance.<br />

[[Loviatar]]'s pleasure is your pain,<br />
Your scars an offering.<br />
Scourge or candle, whip or cane,<br />
Can your devotion bring.

===Volume IX===
[[Milil]] is the Lord of Song.<br />
Pray to Him for inspiration.<br />
Hear His call and sing along.<br />
Let His art be your salvation.<br />

[[Myrkul]] is the lord of death<br />
Of hopelessness and ending things<br />
He'll come for all at their last breath<br />
Lords and peasants, crooks and kings<br />

[[Mystra]], goddess of all mages--<br />
She proves and tends the weave.<br />
Revered by many through the ages;<br />
All magic we from her receive.<br />

===Volume XI=== 
[[Selûne]] guides us through the night<br />
She is the moon, the stars her tears.<br />
Her sister tries to douse her light,<br />
But she protects us from our fears.<br />

[[Shar]] will take your sorrow from you<br />
But beware: her night is dark.<br />
She'll hide your pain, and secrets, too.<br />
And all your joy, and all your spark.<br />

[[Silvanus]], god of all that's wild.<br />
Of nature's danger and its charm.<br />
His glory's not to be defiled,<br />
Or you yourself will come to harm.<br />
