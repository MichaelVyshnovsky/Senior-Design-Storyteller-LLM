        "Contents": "This particular passage was thought to have originally been written two thousand years before the mid-fifteenth century [[Dale Reckoning]] and was heralded by many [[Shadovar]] nobles and sages, including [[Draygo Quick]], [[Parise Ulfbinder]] and [[Prince Rolan|Rolan]] of [[Gloomwrought]] to directly relate to the power of the [[Shadowfell]] and have something to do with the [[Chosen]]."
