{{Quote|''The only legitimate daughter of the wealthy [[Uskevren]] family, [[Thazienne Uskevren|Tazi]] has suffered blow after shattering blow to her body and her spirit, some at the hands of her most trusted allies.''

''Even as she struggles to mend her fractured soul, Tazi finds herself on a journey that will take her from the safety of [[Stormweather]] to the darkest alleys of [[Selgaunt]] and the shining heart of the [[Calim Desert]]. There, the ever-shifting sands hide an old foe who holds the key to Tazi's salvationâ€”or her doom.''}}
