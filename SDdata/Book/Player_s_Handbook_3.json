It introduces new playable races, including [[githzerai]] and [[minotaur]], and new classes.\n\n{{Quote|THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL? THINK AGAIN\n\nOut of the [[Far Realm]] they came: creatures of horror and madness. As the gods rallied against the incursion, brave heroes arose with newfound powers of their own. Together they stood against this threat from beyond, just as they stand today.\n\nThis companion to the ''[[Player's Handbook 4th edition|Player's Handbook]]'' and ''[[Player's Handbook 2]]'' core rulebooks introduces the [[psionic]] power sourceâ€”powers of the will brought to bear against evil's madness. ''Player's Handbook 3'' includes four classes tied to the psionic power source: the [[ardent]], the [[battle mind]], the [[monk (psionic)|monk]], and the [[psion]]. It also presents a new divine class (the [[runepriest]]) and a new primal class (the [[seeker]]).\n\nThis essential book for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' players contains other exciting options: new races, powers (including skill powers for all classes), feats, paragon paths, epic destinies, equipment, superior implements, and rules for hybrid characters.|Back-cover text}}"
