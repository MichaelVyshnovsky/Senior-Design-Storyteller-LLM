''[[Polyhedron 93]]'', page 15, suggests a date of [[1364 DR]], which ''[[Villains' Lorebook]]'' page 98 follows. However, ''Villain's Lorebook'' page 15 has the takeover in 1363 DR.

Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction] offers a date of [[1357 DR]] that is likely in error and referring to the events of seven years before. Finally, ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' page 146 explicitly dates the novel to 1363 DR, with the Bron disappearing in autumn of 1362 DR, Ravendas take over in mid-[[Calendar of Harptos|Hammer]] of 1363 DR, and the events of the novel take place in mid-[[Marpenoth]] of that year. This wiki adopts the most recent source, ''Grand History''. However, dating is further complicated by the following book, ''[[Curse of the Shadowmage]]''.",

        "Summary": "[[Caledan Caldorien]], former [[Harpers|Harper]], returns to [[Iriaebor]] to find it under the control of the [[Zhentarim]] Lord [[Cutter (person)|Cutter]]. He is contacted by a junior Harper, [[Mari Al'maren]], who was sent to free the city. They discover that Lord Cutter is Ravendas, a woman who killed her sister Mera, who was also Caledan’s lover and a member of the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]], Caledan’s old adventuring party that fell apart after Mera’s death. \n\nRavendas’s second in command is Snake, a thief who agreed to serve the [[Verraketh Talembar|Shadowking]], an ancient evil sealed under Iriaebor, in exchange for his life. The Shadowking is using an ancient creature, a [[shadevar]], to hunt all who possess Shadow Magic. These include a woman named Anja, who is killed, Caledan himself, and Caledan’s son Kellen, who Ravendas had after raping Caledan without his knowledge. \n\nCaledan and Mari begin working to oust Ravendas, allying with [[Cormik]], a local crime lord, and reuniting with several members of the Fellowship: [[Estah]], a female [[halfling]] [[cleric]] of [[Eldath]], [[Tyveris]], a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] fighter turned cleric of [[Oghma]], [[Ferret Talondim]], a human thief, and [[Morhion Gen'dahar]], a human mage. Morhion once entered [[Darkhold]] to warn Ravendas when Caledan was set on a suicide mission to avenger Mera, and struck a dark bargain with a spirit named Irafi to escape, giving his blood the the spirit once a month. \n\nThe party discovers the story of the Shadowking, Verraketh, the bard Talek Talembar who defeated him, and the Nightstone, the powerful artifact Talek used to trap the Shadowking. Since Ravendas is running a slave mining operation below Iriaebor to find the Nightstone, the party set out in search of the “shadow song” said to make shadows move that Talek used to defeat Verraketh. Mari and Caledan become close. The shadevar is killed by Caledan and Morhion. \n\nCaledan infiltrates the tower and discovers Kellen is his son. Mari plans to free all the captives in the tower and overthrow the Zhentarim, but the plan is thwarted by Morhion, who seemingly betrays them. Caledan, Mari, and Ferret are captured by Ravendas and Snake, while Tyveris attempts to continue the plan to free the captives. Ravendas leads them to the crypt of the Shadowking and uses Kellen to gain the Nightstone, but the Shadowking kills her and takes over her body as soon as she holds it. Morhion frees everyone, Kellen kills Snake, Caledan defeats the Shadowking with the shadow song, Tyveris and the townsfolk defeat the Zhentarim, and Ferret sacrifices himself to let the others escape, getting entombed in Verraketh's crypt. Caledan rejoins the Harpers.",
