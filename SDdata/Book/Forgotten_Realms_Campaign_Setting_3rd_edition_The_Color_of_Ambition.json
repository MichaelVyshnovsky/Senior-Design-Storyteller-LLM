The log-fenced enclave contained six guard platforms, five buildings, and a well and was inhabited by ten guards and eleven wizards. The enclave collaborated with the local town, producing magic items and aiding in the defense against local monsters.\nHowever, one of the Red Wizards, Kizzaf, had her own ambitions. Beginning at about the start of summer, she was secretly using spells and potions to charm various townsfolk with the intent to sell them into slavery. Her actions triggered the investigation of a group of adventurers, who learned of the nefarious plans when two young men, named Talf and Elonn, never returned to their homes one night around Midsummer. The men had been seen at a tavern speaking to a tall woman with long, dark hair. They were later seen by a drunk leaving the town with the mysterious woman.\nThe adventurers found that the tracks left by the woman and the two men joined with those of a horse-drawn wagon about a mile from the town. The wagon tracks continued on, but the womans footprints led back to the Thayan enclave, where the adventures battled Kizzaf and her created zombie thralls, which were buried within the enclave gates. Hinnar, wanting to maintain peaceful relations with the nearby town, tried to aid the adventurers and capture Kizzaf alive.\nThe men, heavily drugged, had been sold to a Thayan merchant named Mahzed, who was transporting them along with two criminals who sold themselves into slavery to pay off their own debts. History does not record the final outcome of the adventurers investigation nor the fates of Talf, Elonn, or the members of the enclave.\n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  • \nCategoryWorks by Ed Greenwood\nCategoryWorks by Sean K.
