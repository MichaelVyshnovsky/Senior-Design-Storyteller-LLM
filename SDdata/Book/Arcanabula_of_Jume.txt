The '''''Arcanabula of Jume''''' was the ornate [[arcanabula]] of the [[mage]] known as [[Jume]], who lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] around the 11th century [[DR]]. It was enchanted in a number of ways that ensured its protection.

==Description==
This [[spellbook]] was beautifully designed, with 22 pages made of sheets of polished rock crystal, bound in brass rings. Its cover was adorned with Jume's [[mage sigil|rune]], and the back cover would glimmer with a faint silver light. The script was embossed in [[Ruathlek]], with lettering of colored paste made of [[ruby|rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and [[silver]].

==Enchantments==
The arcanabula was enchanted with ''[[spell turning]]'' and would produce an effect similar to the [[ring of spell turning|ring of the same name]] if targeted by or within the area of any [[spell]]s. There was also a five percent change it would [[teleport]] to a random location in [[Faerûn]] every 60 days, regardless of [[magic]]al barriers.

==Contents==
Jume's spellbook contained the following spells, four of which were uniquely crafted by Jume herself:
:''[[Audible glamer]]'' • ''[[Change self]]'' • ''[[Gaze reflection]]'' • ''[[Dark mirror]]'' (unique) • ''[[Hypnotic pattern]]'' • ''[[Magic mouth]]'' • ''[[Misdirection]]'' • ''[[Phantom steed]]'' • ''[[Spectral force]]'' • ''[[Shadow monsters]]'' • ''[[Shadow hand]]'' (unique) • ''[[Shadow evocation|Shadow magic]]'' • ''[[Prismatic eye]]'' (unique) • ''[[Shadow gauntlet]]'' (unique) • ''[[True seeing]]''
