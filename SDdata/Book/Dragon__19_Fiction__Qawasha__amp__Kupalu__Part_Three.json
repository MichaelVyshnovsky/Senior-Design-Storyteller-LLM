Part One was featured in Dragon+ Issue #15 while Part Two was featured in Dragon+ Issue #16.\nAs Qawasha, Samrith Vess, and Zara near the ruins of Mezro, they happen upon a group of chwingas, one of which takes a liking to Samrith and gifts her a charm made from a mushroom cap. Arriving at the ruins, they make their way through the outskirts and are beset by a horde of zombies. At the last moment, they are saved by Kupalué and its fellow vegepygmies. The four of them proceed to the Maze of Life, where the chwingas charm causes Qawasha to have a vision of Mezro in its prime. The vision then shifts to a long-lost city in the jungle containing a dark passage in which he briefly meets a series of nine trickster gods until suddenly be beholds a terrifying artifact created by a lord of the undead and connected to a grotesque monster. Through this vision, he is granted an understanding of the history of the things he sees, and realizes that the artifact is \"choking all life across the world.\" He then finds himself before a council of the barae, and a woman helps him understand that only if the things he saw are destroyed can Mezro return to the world once more. Awakening from his vision, Qawasha tells his companions what he learned, and they plot to travel to the lost city and destroy the artifact.\nKupalué • Qawasha • Samrith Vess • Zara\nAcererak (not named)\natropal (not named) • chwinga • human (Chultan, Tethyrian) • vegepygmy • undead (zombie)\nbird • hornet • snake • spider • tiger • wraith\nEquipment  backpack • boots\nFood and drink  fruit • hardtack\nWeapons  staff • sword\nprybar • rowboat • scythe\nBuildings & Sites  Maze of Life • Tomb of the Nine Gods (not named)\nRegions  Chult • Olung River Valley\nRivers  River Olung\nSettlements  Mezro • Omu (not named)\nGrand Coliseum • Moonshae Isles • Nine Hells • Port Nyanzaru\nSpells  barkskin • shillelagh\nOther  death curse (not named) • Soulmonger (not named) • Spellplague\nflying carpet • spellbook\nbarae\nnine trickster gods • Oghma • Ubtao\nClasses and Occupations  adventurer • druid • warrior • wizard\nMaterials  coral • crystal • metal\nPlants  mushroom • strangler fig • vine • wazingo\nOther  poison • sun • tsunami"
