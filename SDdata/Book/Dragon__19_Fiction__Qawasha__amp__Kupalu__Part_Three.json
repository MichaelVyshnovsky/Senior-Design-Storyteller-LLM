        "Synopsis": "As [[Qawasha]], [[Samrith Vess]], and [[Zara]] near the ruins of [[Mezro]], they happen upon a group of [[chwinga]]s, one of which takes a liking to Samrith and gifts her a charm made from a [[mushroom]] cap. Arriving at the ruins, they make their way through the outskirts and are beset by a horde of [[zombie]]s. At the last moment, they are saved by [[Kupalué]] and its fellow [[vegepygmies]]. The four of them proceed to the [[Maze of Life]], where the chwinga's charm causes Qawasha to have a vision of Mezro in its prime. The vision then shifts to [[Omu|a long-lost city]] in the jungle containing a [[Tomb of the Nine Gods|dark passage]] in which he briefly meets a series of [[nine trickster gods]] until suddenly be beholds a [[Soulmonger|terrifying artifact]] created by [[Acererak|a lord of the undead]] and connected to [[atropal|a grotesque monster]]. Through this vision, he is granted an understanding of the history of the things he sees, and realizes that the artifact is \"[[death curse|choking all life across the world]].\" He then finds himself before a council of the [[bara]]e, and [[Alisanda Rayburton|a woman]] helps him understand that only if the things he saw are destroyed can Mezro return to the world once more. Awakening from his vision, Qawasha tells his companions what he learned, and they plot to travel to the lost city and destroy the artifact.",
