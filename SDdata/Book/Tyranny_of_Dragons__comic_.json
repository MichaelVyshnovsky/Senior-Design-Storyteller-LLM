        "Summary": "[[File:Portal Tuern.png|thumb|left|200px|''[[Cult of the Dragon]] and [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] agents at the ''[[portal]]'' leading to [[Tuern]].'']]\nThe people of [[Icewind Dale]] are being besieged by [[dragon]]s, which are protecting a group of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] as they search for powerful [[Dragon Mask]]s. [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] in [[Neverwinter]] summons the heroes [[Alaeros Margaster|Alaeros]],  [[Barrowin Undurr|Barrowin]], and [[Nymmestra Durothil|Nymmestra]] to investigate.\n\nMeanwhile, the cultists have failed to fine the Red Dragon Mask, but have located a ''[[portal]]'', but before they can activate it, they are beset upon by the heroes, who are joined by [[Ratshadow]] (of the [[Zhentarim]]) and [[Talon Everhale|Talon]] (of the [[Emerald Enclave]]). They agree to work together to try to find the Dragon Masks before the Cult of the Dragon can.\n\nThe heroes travel through the portal to the island of [[Tuern]], where they find themselves at the heart of the island's volcano. They are attacked by one of the three dragon overlords, a [[red dragon]] that they manage to slay. Upon learning the news, the other dragon overlords fly about setting the island on fire.\n\nThe Red Dragon Mask is finally located by cultist leader [[Severin Silrajin|Severin]], who takes it back through the portal, ordering his followers to destroy it behind him. The heroes are left stranded, but travel back to Neverwinter through a ''[[teleportation circle]]''.\n\n[[File:March of the Five Factions.png|thumb|left|300px|''The march of the [[Five Factions]].'']]\nSeverin recruits dragons to attack the city of Neverwinter as distraction while he looks for more Dragon Masks, which he intends to put together to form the [[Dragon Crown]] to summon [[Tiamat]] herself. During the attacks, Ratshadow finds the White Dragon Mask. He gives it to his faction, the Zhentarim, who take it to [[Waterdeep]], where it is promptly stolen to the villa of Lord [[Arthagast Ulbrinter]]. Ulbrinter disappears but his wife, Lady [[Remallia Haventree|Haventree]] knows nothing about it.\n\n[[File:Tiamat'S Temple erupting.png|thumb|150px|''[[Tiamat's temple]] emerging within the [[Well of Dragons]].'']]\nIt turns out that Ulbrinter has been killed, the heroes learn through [[Varramzord]], the white dragon whisperer, who tells them that Severin has obtained the White Dragon Mask. IT was the last piece he needed to construct the Dragon Crown and summon Tiamat.\n\nLady Haventree convinces the [[Five Factions]] (Zhentarim, Emerald Enclave, [[Lords' Alliance]], [[Harpers]], and [[Order of the Gauntlet]]) to march on Severin and the Cult of the Dragon. The armies arrive just in time to see the spire of Tiamat's temple rising from the ground. The battle begins in full, with ground troops below and dragons above. Tiamat is summoned, but fortunately the [[metallic dragon]]s have come to aid in the battle.",
