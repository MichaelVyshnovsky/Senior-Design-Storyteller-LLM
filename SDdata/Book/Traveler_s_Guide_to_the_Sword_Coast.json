        "mainbody": "ravelers Guide to the Sword Coast was a many-volume collection of travel guides dedicated to the Sword Coast area of Faerûn, published sometime before 1492 DR.\nThe fourth section of the Travelers Guide spoke of the Risen Road, the route that connected the cities of Baldurs Gate and Elturel, which ran parallel to the River Chionthar. It stated the road was a preferred alternative for those that did not wish to travel by river barge.\nIt highlighted some notable landmarks that could be found along the road, including the grand temple of Selûne, the nearby village of Moonhaven, and Moonrise Towers.\nThe eighth section of the book discussed the Outer City of Baldurs Gate. It detailed the numerous industries that helped keep the city running, but were deemed too unpleasant to be housed within the citys walls.\nThe author shared their opinion that any upstanding travelers should not spend too much time in the Outer City. Even the Lower City was a preferable place to spend ones time.\nThe section of the tome that talked about travelers accommodation in the city of Baldurs Gate mentioned several establishments of note. The Blade and Stars was one of the inns mentioned. The guide informed travelers of the inns easy-to-spot signage depicting a wooden shield, with a curved blade against a background of stars. It was a welcoming and quite inn that served somewhat plain grub but offered clean lodgings.\nAnother inn in the guide was the famed Blushing Maiden Inn. The guide warned visitors of its boisterous atmosphere of revelry that lasted into the night. Its namesake was a large wooden mermaid displayed to the establishments patrons. Lastly, Elfsong Tavern received a limited entry as a dimly-lit inn known for its ghostly singing elven maid and its proprietor named Alan.\nBy the late 15 century DR, some copies of these volumes were in heavy everyday use. Some of the copies found in the wild suffered damage from elements, rough use, and age. Some were missing covers and binding altogether and had hand-written notes by the books previous owners."
