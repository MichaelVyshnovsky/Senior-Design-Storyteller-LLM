'''''Three Thayvian Roses''''' was a rowdy, loud, and explicitly indecorous festhall song, written and popularized sometime before [[1368 DR]].

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], ''Three Thayvian Roses'' was performed by god [[Milil]], the Lord of All Songs. He imposed the beautiful song on an audience of [[Sensates]] from [[Sigil]] who were performing a ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' ritual to experience the forbidden experience of spying on [[Toril]]lian deities. The song's bawdy lyrics brought blush to [[Erin Darkflame Montgomery]]'s face, the stern factol of the Society of Sensation.
