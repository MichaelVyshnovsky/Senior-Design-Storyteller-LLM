        "mainbody": "The Shattered Seldarine was a historical, religious, and philosophical work penned sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.\nThe Shattered Seldarine was a finely-crafted tome, bound in black leather and penned with silver ink.\nThe book talked about the ancient splintering of the elvish people, mentioning its cause to be in some degree infighting, but the major cause for this was goddess Lolth and her betrayal of the pantheon. Those who followed Lolth chose to believe her lies that Corellon Larethian abandoned the Fair Folk, and those who did not – did nothing to dissuade the drow from that belief. However, the book also stated that Corellons divine silence was a betrayal of the elves in its own right.\nElven histories recorded the fact that few at the time understood Lolths malice and intent for her followers. She intentionally stole people from the elven homelands and splintered the elven bloodline. The most cruel and sadistic of Lolths followers became her first cultists. These cultists sowed the seeds that sprouted to become the City of Spiders, Menzoberranzan.\nThe books final portion talked about the current state of the elven society at the time of its writing. The elves remained at war, and the drow remained fractured. Each city in the Underdark had its own allegiance, all spilled blood of their kin. Optimistically, the writer hoped for Lolths fall that would hopefully return the drow into the Corellons halls again.\nThis book was published by the Silverhair Knights to be shared with temples to Eilistraee across Faerûn. In the , a copy of the book could be found in the Ebonlake Grotto in the Underdark underneath the Western Heartlands. Another copy belonged to Nansi Gretta, the proprietor of The Bibliophile shop in Baldurs Gate."
