        "mainbody": "'''''The Shattered Seldarine''''' was a historical, religious, and philosophical work penned sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''The Underdark has changed us for good, but perhaps when Lolth falls, the Seldarine faithful will be welcome in Corellon's halls again. At least Eilistraee is kind enough to share our exile and watch over us until that day comes.''|Excerpt from ''The Shattered Seldarine''}}",
        "Description": "''The Shattered Seldarine'' was a finely-crafted tome, bound in black [[leather]] and penned with [[silver]] [[ink]].",
        "Content": "The book talked about the ancient splintering of the [[elf|elvish]] people, mentioning its cause to be in some degree infighting, but the major cause for this was goddess [[Lolth]] and her betrayal of the pantheon. Those who followed Lolth chose to believe her lies that [[Corellon Larethian]] abandoned the Fair Folk, and those who did not – did nothing to dissuade the [[drow]] from that belief. However, the book also stated that Corellon's divine silence was a betrayal of the elves in its own right.\n\nElven histories recorded the fact that few at the time understood Lolth's malice and intent for her followers. She intentionally stole people from the elven homelands and splintered the elven bloodline. The most cruel and sadistic of Lolth's followers became her first cultists. These cultists sowed the seeds that sprouted to become the City of Spiders, [[Menzoberranzan]].\n\nThe book's final portion talked about the current state of the elven society at the time of its writing. The elves remained at war, and the drow remained fractured. Each city in the Underdark had its own allegiance, all spilled blood of their kin. Optimistically, the writer hoped for Lolth's fall that would hopefully return the drow into the Corellon's halls again.",
        "History": "This book was published by the [[Silverhair Knights]] to be shared with temples to [[Eilistraee]] across [[Faerûn]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of the book could be found in the [[Ebonlake Grotto]] in the [[Underdark]] underneath the [[Western Heartlands]]. Another copy belonged to [[Nansi Gretta]], the proprietor of [[The Bibliophile]] shop in [[Baldur's Gate]]."
