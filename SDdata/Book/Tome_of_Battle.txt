'''''Tome of Battle The Book of the Nine Swords''''' is an accessory for the 3.5{{th}}-edition of {{dnd}} ruleset.

{{Quote|'''''Master the Secret Magic of Steel'''''
 
''Nine are the disciplines of the Sublime Way - the path of martial supremacy in which the perfect combination of devotion, lore, and practice allows a warrior to achieve feats of superhuman prowess. The Desert Wind master strikes with the speed and fury of a raging fire. The Tiger Claw master tears his foes apart with the primal fury of a beast. The Diamond Mind master acts in slivers of time so small that others cannot even perceive them. Each discipline unlocks exciting new options for a combat-oriented character.''
 
''This supplement for the D&D game describes a new system of combat maneuvers that blend fantastic weapon techniques with pious devotion and mystical blade magic. Within the nine disciples of the Sublime Way are more than 120 daring martial maneuvers. In addition, this book presents three new standard classes that perform martial maneuvers, as well as new feats and prestige classes.''
