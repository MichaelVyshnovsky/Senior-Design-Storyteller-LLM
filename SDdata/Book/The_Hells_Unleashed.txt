'''''The Hells Unleashed''''' was [[book]] dedicated to the [[Nine Hells]], penned sometime in or beofre the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
One notable chapter of the book was titled "Nine Steps to His Infernal Throne" and provided information on each of the nine layers of Hells and their rulers. It also listed [[spell component]]s required to cast a ''[[scrying]]'' [[spell]] onto each of the Hells' dukes. To scry on the Archduchess [[Zariel]] of [[Avernus]], one required a [[heliotrope]], encasing a done splinter; Archduke [[Dispater]] of [[Dis]] needed a bit of the [[infernal iron]] ore; Archduke [[Mammon]] of [[Minauros]] – a [[gold]] [[coin]] encased in petrified [[peat]]; [[Phlegethos]]' [[Fierna]] and [[Belial]] – a bit of ''[[everburn ash]]'' balanced on a scale of stone; Archduke [[Levistus]] of [[Stygia]] – a [[coal]]-black eye encased in ice of its own tears; [[Malbolge]]'s Archduchess [[Glasya]] – a [[coronet]] stained with blood of three legitimate rulers; [[Maladomini]]'s Archduke [[Baalzebul]] – a fat [[Gorian fly]], gorged on a [[petioner]]'s blood; Archduke [[Mephistopheles]] of [[Cania]] – a burned book of priceless lore; and lastly, the book sthated that attempting to ''scry'' on [[Nessus]]'s Lord [[Asmodeus]] resuled in the caster's immidiate and permanent disaperance.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''The Hells Unleashed'' belonged to the mysterious [[unded]] [[necromancer]] known as the [[Mystic Carrion]] – stashed in the creature's home in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] – the [[Philgrave Mansion]].
