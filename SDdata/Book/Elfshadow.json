        "Summary": "In 1321 DR, the moon elf Zaor Moonflower, the\nking of the elven island of Evermeet, was killed by the sun elf assassin Fenian\nNi'Tessine in the gardens of the Moonstone Palace. Fenian had originally been\nseeking Amnestria Moonflower, Zaor’s daughter and a princess of Evermeet, so he\nconsidered the death of the king to be a fortunate accident, but he was mortally\nwounded while fleeing the palace and was soon killed. Amnestria was a capable\nwarrior-mage and was in love with Bran Skorlsun, a human ranger and a member of\nthe Harpers, a semi-secret organization dedicated to fighting for freedom and\njustice. Together, Amnestria and Bran had a half-elven daughter, whom they\nnamed Arilyn, but their relationship and their child was considered to be a\ndisgrace by the elves of Evermeet. In an unconscious attempt to span her two\nworlds, Amnestria imbued her moonblade, a hereditary magical sword, with the\nelfgate ability, which created a magical portal between Evermeet and mainland\nFaerûn. However, when the elves of Evermeet learned of this power, they had the\nsword dismantled in order to ensure that the portal, which they hid in the\nelven city of Evereska, could not be used. Amnestria was banished from Evermeet\nand pledged to protect the elfgate, and since Bran was forced to keep the\nmoonstone from the princess’s moonblade, the lovers understood that they could\nnever be reunited. \n\nAmnestria went into exile in Evereska, where she\ntook the name Z'beryl and\nraised Arilyn alone without ever telling her about her heritage. Z'beryl became an instructor at the\nCollege of Magic and Arms, an academy for warrior-mages in Evereska, but she\nwas slain by ruffians when Arilyn was fifteen years old. Some of Z'beryl’s\nrelatives traveled to Evereska for the funeral, but they did not comfort the\ngrieving Arilyn and only sought to discover the disposition of her mother’s\nmoonblade. Z'beryl had left the moonblade to Arilyn, who claimed the weapon as\nher own, and her relatives soon left Evereska without trying to take the sword\nfrom her. Shortly afterward, Kymil Nimesin, a sun elf noble and a renowned weapons\nmaster at the Academy of Arms, a prestigious training school outside the port city\nof Waterdeep, met with Arilyn and became her mentor. Arilyn was unable to\nanswer Kymil’s questions regarding her knowledge of her human father or the\nmoonblade that she had inherited from her mother. Kymil later arranged for\nArilyn to receive training under his tutelage at the Academy of Arms and\nreplaced the missing gem in her magical sword with a topaz.\n\nBy 1361 DR, Arilyn was an accomplished\nadventurer and had taken the name of her sword, Moonblade, as her own surname. Arilyn\nhad learned that her moonblade’s magical powers included glowing blue and warning\nher when danger was near, being able to strike abnormally fast, burning anyone besides\nherself who attempted to touch the sword, protecting her from fire, and\nprojecting illusions to disguise her. Arilyn was an agent of the Harpers but\nnot an official member of the organization, and though she had a reputation as\nan assassin, she had never killed an innocent or unarmed person. \n\nAround 1361 DR, a mysterious figure who became\nknown as the Harper Assassin murdered several members of the Harpers who had\nassociations or were friends with Arilyn. In the early autumn of 1361 DR,\nthe Harpers tasked Arilyn with infiltrating Darkhold, a fortress\ncontrolled by the evil organization known as the Zhentarim, and retrieve some\nrelics sacred to Sune, the goddess of love, that had been stolen by a Zhentish\nraiding party. Arilyn purchased information about the layout and defenses\nof Darkhold from a retired Zhentish soldier, but shortly after she met with\nhim, he was slain by the Harper Assassin. Arilyn was able to secretly\nenter Darkhold, but she had to fight and kill the Zhentish captain Cherbill\nNimmt in order to recover the artifacts. Once Arilyn escaped from\nDarkhold, she began to hastily make her way toward Evereska. \n\nMeanwhile, Khelben \"Blackstaff\"\nArunsun, the archmage of Waterdeep and a high-ranking member of the\nHarpers, was concerned about the Harper Assassin and had realized that the\nkiller seemed to be following Arilyn. While at a party in Waterdeep,\nKhelben met with his nephew Danilo Thann, a young Waterdhavian nobleman\nwho publicly acted like a dandy and a dilettante but was secretly a capable\nmage and Harper agent. Khelben wanted Danilo to help stop the Harper Assassin\nand told him to find Arilyn in Evereska. Danilo was ordered to protect Arilyn\nfrom the Harper Assassin while trying to learn the enigmatic killer’s identity and\nobtain information about the half-elf’s moonblade. \n\nArilyn stopped at the Halfway Inn, a tavern in\nthe mountains near Evereska, and met with Kymil, whom she gave the artifacts\nthat she had retrieved from Darkhold so that he could return them to Sune’s\nfollowers. Kymil told Arilyn that she should seek out and stop the Harper\nAssassin, who may actually be a member of the Harpers, and that she should begin\nher search in Waterdeep. Arilyn agreed, but a group of mercenaries led by the\nruffian Harvid Beornigarth then arrived at the Halfway Inn in search of the\nhalf-elf. After Kymil magically transported himself to Evereska, Arilyn used her\nmoonblade to magically disguise herself and by chance took Danilo, who happened\nto be at the tavern, as a hostage in order to evade the mercenaries and escape\nfrom the inn. The pair began to journey toward Waterdeep, and although Danilo\nkept his true identity and mission a secret, he and Arilyn soon became friends.\nAs Arilyn and Danilo were traveling through part of the Marsh of Chelimber,\nthey were attacked by a band of lizardfolk and goblins, but they managed to\nkill the evil humanoids. \n\nWhen Arilyn and Danilo eventually reached\nWaterdeep, they visited an inn and encountered Elaith Craulnobur, a moon elf\nadventurer and crime lord with a reputation for cruelty and treachery. Elaith\nand Amnestria had been childhood friends in Evermeet and were betrothed until\nthe former had been rejected by his family’s moonblade. Much to Danilo’s\ndismay, Elaith showed an intense interest in Arilyn, and following the meeting,\nthe rogue elf magically contacted Kymil and arranged to have Danilo killed. That\nnight, the Harper Assassin murdered Rhys Ravenwind, a renowned bard and member\nof the Harpers. A short time later, Arilyn awakened to find the Harper Assassin\nstanding over Danilo and tried to assail the mysterious entity. The Harper\nAssassin disappeared, but Arilyn then discovered that the killer had used a\nmagical brand to poison Danilo. Although Danilo quickly recovered from the\nwound, he pretended otherwise in order to force Arilyn to withdraw to a safe\nlocation, the home of a former adventurer named Loene. While Arilyn spoke with\nLoene, Danilo secretly left the house to report to Khelben at Blackstaff Tower.\nWhen Danilo returned to Loene’s home, he learned that Arilyn had departed to seek\nthe help of Elaith, but he was able to quickly catch up with the half-elf.\nArilyn and Danilo met with Elaith, who agreed to use his connections to try to\nfind information about the Harper Assassin.\n\nMeanwhile, Bran, who was now a High Harper, was\nsecretly following Arilyn in order to determine whether she was responsible for\nthe deaths of all the Harper agents. While trailing Arilyn and Danilo through\nWaterdeep, Bran was confronted by Elaith, whom he had previously adventured\nwith but now hated. Elaith stated that he should be Arilyn’s father, not Bran,\nwho wanted the elf to stay away from his daughter. While the Harper Assassin\nkilled Elliot Graves, Loene’s servant and a member of the Harpers, Arilyn and\nDanilo attempted to learn more about the enigmatic killer by questioning some\nof the inhabitants of Waterdeep. The companions’ inquiries caused them to\nbecome suspicious of Elaith, but when they confronted the rogue, he revealed\nthat one of the Harpers who was believed to have been slain by the Harper\nAssassin was actually killed by two of the elf’s agents. Elaith explained that\nhe had discovered that someone had successfully made it seem that Arilyn was\nthe Harper Assassin, and he also warned that he had arranged to have Danilo\nkilled. \n\nAfter speaking with Elaith, Arilyn and\nDanilo met with a few Harper agents and some of the half-elf’s old comrades. The\ntwo friends later left Waterdeep in an attempt to prevent anyone else from\nbeing killed by the Harper Assassin, and Danilo convinced Arilyn to try to\ndiscover more about her moonblade and its powers. Arilyn and Danilo sought\ninformation from Evermeet by using the Relay, a network of sentient sea\ncreatures. Although they found out little about the moonblade, they did learn\nabout Arilyn’s royal heritage. The knowledge prompted Arilyn to seek the assistance\nof Khelben, and Danilo teleported them to Blackstaff Tower. Khelben sent Arilyn\nand Danilo to the fortress library known as Candlekeep, where they gained more\ninformation about the moonblade’s history and abilities, such as the elfshadow\npower, which created an ethereal duplicate of the wielder that could fight and\nkill. Arilyn realized that the Harper Assassin was not an actual person, but her\nmoonblade’s elfshadow ability, which Kymil had obtained control over. \n\nWhen Arilyn and Danilo magically returned to\nWaterdeep, the half-elf ascertained her companion’s true identity, but the two\nwere then attacked by a group of mercenaries led by Harvid, whom Kymil had\nhired to assail the pair. Bran soon joined the fight to help Arilyn and Danilo,\nand together they were able to kill Harvid and his men. Immediately afterward, Bran\nwas forced to fight the elfshadow assassin, and during the clash, the moonstone\nthat Bran carried magically reattached to Arilyn’s moonblade and the topaz that\nKymil had installed in the sword was destroyed. Kymil had cast a spell on the\ntopaz that enabled him to control the moonblade’s elfshadow ability, but the\nmoonstone being rejoined to the sword ended his power over Arilyn’s shadowy duplicate\nand caused a magical explosion. Following the devastating magical blast, a\ndetachment of the City Watch of Waterdeep arrived at the scene and arrested\nArilyn, Danilo, and Bran.\n\nKymil was in Waterdeep at that time and had used\nthe elfshadow to kill the various Harper agents in order to lure Bran to Arilyn\nso that the moonstone would be reunited with the half-elf’s moonblade, but he\nhad not anticipated that he would lose control over the ethereal duplicate. Kymil\nwanted to use the moonblade to access the hidden portal to Evermeet, enabling\nhim and his group of malevolent sun elf followers to enact their plans, which\nwere to kill the remaining members of the nation’s royal family and ultimately establish\na ruling council of sun elf elders. As part of his plot, Kymil had sent Fenian\nto Evermeet forty years previously and he had later arranged the death of Z'beryl. Knowing that Arilyn would try to\nthwart his plans, Kymil magically traveled to Evereska with his minions to\nawait the half-elf. \n\nOnce Arilyn, Danilo,\nand Bran were released from Waterdeep’s prison on the orders of Khelben, they\nattempted to find Kymil, but they soon learned that the elven armsmaster had\nleft the city and was now in Evereska. After Bran then revealed to Arilyn that\nhe was her father, they made their way to Blackstaff Tower with Danilo and met\nwith Khelben. The archmage provided Arilyn with an enspelled griffon so that\nshe could hastily journey to Evereska and confront Kymil. Arilyn left her\nmoonblade in Blackstaff Tower to prevent Kymil from being able to utilize the\nelfgate. \n\nShortly after Arilyn\ndeparted from Waterdeep, Danilo and Bran decided to magically travel to\nEvereska to not only help her defeat Kymil, but also to stop her from killing\nthe sun elf. Kymil needed to be captured and put on trial by the Harpers for\nhis crimes or Arilyn could be accused of being the Harper Assassin. Khelben\ntaught Danilo a powerful spell that would move the elfgate to a new location,\nand even though Arilyn’s moonblade magically burned the young nobleman, he took\nthe sword with him to Evereska because he knew that the half-elf would need the\nweapon to overcome Kymil. As Danilo and Bran were preparing to leave for\nEvereska, they encountered Elaith. The rogue told the two companions that the\nHarper Assassin’s attack on Danilo had been the arranged attempt on his life,\nand he gave them evidence proving that Kymil had been working with the\nZhentarim. When Danilo questioned Elaith’s motives, the elf revealed that he\nwas helping Arilyn because he wanted to get revenge on Kymil. \n\nUpon reaching\nEvereska, Arilyn fought Kymil and his sun elf followers near the site of the\nhidden portal to Evermeet. Danilo and Bran soon joined the fight and provided\nArilyn with her moonblade, and while the half-elf killed Kymil’s servants, the Waterdhavian mage magically moved the elfgate to a safe\nlocation. Following the deaths of Kymil’s followers, Arilyn faced the\narmsmaster in single combat and defeated him. The elfshadow wanted Arilyn to\nkill Kymil, but she resisted the shadowy entity’s desire for vengeance and\nexerted complete control over her moonblade.\n\nKymil was tried for\nhis treacherous crimes by a Harper tribunal, and Arilyn’s innocence was\nconfirmed. Arilyn and Danilo later celebrated their success in Waterdeep with\nBran, who gave them Harper pins and made them official members of the\norganization. Bran also promised Arilyn that he would remain near Waterdeep so\nthat they could get to know each other better. Since they were now close\nfriends, Arilyn and Danilo decided to continue to work together. Danilo told\nArilyn that he had moved the elfgate to Blackstaff Staff in order to make\ncertain that the portal would remain safe. Arilyn then revealed that instead of\nimbuing her moonblade with a new magical power, she had removed the restriction\nthat prevented anyone else from touching the sword without being burned.",
