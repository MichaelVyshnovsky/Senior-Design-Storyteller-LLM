'''''The Surprising Habits of Kara-Turian Warlords''''' was a self-help [[book]] of dubious nature that promoted the [[Sharran]] [[House of Grief]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Alas, poor reader, not everyone can improve themselves without the help of others. Some need the instruction of an elderâ€”a steadying, authoritative hand that can mete out guidance and discipline in equal measure. Honor your elders, dear reader. Be mindful of their lessons, deferential to their desires, and grateful for their discipline. Be of service to them, even when you think you are at odds with them.''|Excerpt from ''The Surprising Habits of Kara-Turian Warlords''}}

==Description==
The book was a rough assembly of printed pages and a bound cover.

==Content==
''The Surprising Habits of Kara-Turian Warlords'' had little to do with [[Kara-Tur]] and, instead, was aimed at helping those readers who disappointed their elders in a strangely cruel tone. The book's long-winded text could be summarized as a propaganda of obedience and advertisement of the House of Grief's services.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Surprising Habits of Kara-Turian Warlords'' could be found in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and was available in the House of Grief's small garden.
