'''''Volo's Bestiaries: The Malaugrym''''' was one of the series of [[book]]s penned by [[Volothamp Geddarm]] on the topic various monstrous creatures.

==Contents==
''Volo's Bestiaries''' tome on the [[malaugrym]] opened with the theory that these creatures were twisted descendants of a [[wizard]] [[Malaug]] who was believed to be the first [[human]] to venture into [[Shadowfell]]. However, the book disputed that origin story as recently assumed false as they were also believed to come from a place even more [[Far Realm|alien]] than Shadowfell.

Following the origins theories, the book delved into the creatures' abilities and ecology. Malaugrym were able to create a flawless shapeshifting copy of any creature they've witnessed. Many individual malargrym had one shape they deemed their favorite, which they assumed when threatened. These creatures' shapeshifting abilities allowed them to seamlessly blend with any populations of [[Faerûn]]. They often settled in big settlements where they had unlimited access to their favorite delicacy - [[human]]s.

Volo's book claimed that malaugrym planned to invade Faerûn eventually. However, according to the book, these plans were often interrupted by the creatures' inability to learn planar magics, inability to work together, and compulsive desire to amuse themselves with evil and cruelty. The malargrym were led by the [[Shadowmaster]]. Volo cited that until the very recent years before the book's publishing, only five malaugrym were known to live in Faerûn; however, the number was assumed to have doubled.

==History==
By [[1374 DR]], ''Volo's Bestiaries: The Malaugrym'' books could be found in several coastal cities of the Moonsea region, such as [[Hillsfar]]. A malargrym who impersonated [[Eremuth Silverwind]] owned a copy of this book that he kept inside his lair under the town of [[Elmwood]].
