In anticipation of Paramount Pictures' upcoming ''Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves'', IDW is thrilled to announce a comic prequel, ''Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves—The Feast of the Moon'', which will be available in February 2023, ahead of the film's theatrical release. Written by Jeremy Lambert (''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'') and Ellen Boener with art by Eduardo Ferigato (''Last Flight Out'') and Guillermo Sanna (''Luke Cage''), ''Feast of the Moon'' introduces [[Edgin Darvis|Edgin]], [[Holga Kilgore|Holga]], and more of the movie's ignoble antiheroes, and tells the thrilling, hilarious, and unexpected story of events leading up to the epic calamity that will ultimately ensnare them.

Stranded in a town under siege after their latest heist goes awry, Edgin and his band of thieves find themselves enmeshed in a bitter conflict between the town's inhabitants and a tyrannical [[Bandit King]] who has exploited the town's resources for years under threat of violence and ruin. With their backs against the wall, Edgin and his associates vow to help the townsfolk repel the Bandit King's forces once and for all—but as the danger escalates and the thieves' loyalties are tested, allegiances begin to shift, and it soon becomes clear that all is not as it seems.|From IDW press release}}

When their latest heist ends in failure, Edgin and his band of thieves find themselves stranded in a town under siege! The Bandit King and his thugs have been extorting the locals for years, but nothing is what it seems, and, as the Feast of the Moon begins, a greater evil lurks. 

Edgin and his friends—[[rogue|roguish]] [[Forge Fitzwilliam|Forge]], [[barbarian]] Holga, and [[sorcerer]] [[Simon]]—promise to help, but will they honor their word? Or will the unlikely heroes abandon the last of the Harper principles Edgin used to hold so dear?  

Then, in a special bonus story, the [[paladin]] known as [[Xenk Yendar|Xenk]] swore to protect an artifact of dangerous and mysterious power. But the terrors of the [[Underdark]] will test his oath more than he could have imagined!
