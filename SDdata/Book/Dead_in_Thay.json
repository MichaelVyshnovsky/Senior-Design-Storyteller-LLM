The ''[[Bloodgate]]'', an elemental node of power, must be destroyed in order to stop him. This adventure is part two of the Dreams of the Red Wizards [[Second Sundering|Sundering]] storyline, directly tied to [[Scourge of the Sword Coast]], and loosely connected to the events in [[Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle]].''\n\n''Dead in Thay is a tribute to Tomb of Horrors, [[The Ruins of Undermountain]], and other killer dungeons. The monsters, traps, and hazards in the adventure create a deadly challenge.''}}",
        "Summary": "Having located [[Bloodgate Keep]], an assault upon it is led out of the [[Floshin Estates]]. The elemental nodes that were helping sustain the ''[[portal]]'' from [[Thay]] are collapsed but when an attempt is made to close the ''Bloodgate'' itself, [[Mennek Ariz]] calls upon [[Baazka]], who transports both him and [[Shalendra Floshin]] away. Trying to protect his niece, [[Kelson Darktreader]] is caught up in the transportation magic.\n\nThe attacking adventurers were whisked away by the [[Thayan Resurrection]] to the [[Doomvault]] beneath [[Thaymount]]. The rebels claim to have saved the party's lives and expect them to repay the favor by destroying the [[phylacteries]] of Szass Tam's top lieutenants that are held within.\n\nThey venture through the massive and deadly dungeon, locate Shalendra, who was betrayed and imprisoned by her former allies and witness experiments being performed on several captured [[Chosen]] before completing their mission.",
