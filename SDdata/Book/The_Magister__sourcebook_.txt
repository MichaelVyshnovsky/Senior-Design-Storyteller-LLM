The Magister is a 1-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory that was set in the Forgotten Realms.
The Magister was written by Ed Greenwood and Steve Perrin, with a cover by Jeff Easley. It was published by TSR in 1988 as a 64-page book.
The Magister is a supplement which describes magic items and spells specific to the Forgotten Realms setting, and includes rules for magic item creation, random tables for generating magical treasure, and descriptions of new magic items. Elminster narrates the book, and provides descriptive detail, history, and game mechanics for the magic he presents. The spells and spell descriptions are explicit and detailed, and the tomes that contain these spells are described in appearance and history. The book provides lore and descriptions of magical armor, clothing, rings, wands, swords, and miscellaneous magical items, as well as a short section on the creation of magical items.
The 64-page book includes a one-page foreword and introduction by Ed Greenwood, which outlines the subject of the book—new spells and magic items—and cites Pages from the Mages, a series of articles from Dragon magazine in which some of the content had previously appeared. 
"How To Use This Book", an article by Steve Perrin, explains how the book can be useful to both Dungeon Masters and players. The book details magical books of the Realms, each of which has its own unique properties and contains a number of spells. The spells themselves are elaborated by means of a chart which lists them by level, name, spell school, and which spellbook they may be found in. The book describes a variety of magic items unique to the Realms, including magic armor, clothing, miscellaneous magic items, potions, rings, rods, staves, and wands, unique swords, and other weapons. It details various methods by which characters may create magic items. The books inside front cover contains a table for randomly determining magical treasure found in this book, and the inside back cover details saving throws involved in creating magical items.
