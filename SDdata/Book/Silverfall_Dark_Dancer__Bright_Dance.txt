Dark Dancer, Bright Dance is a novella by Ed Greenwood first published in the 1999 anthology Silverfall.
Qilué Veladorn is dancing with other priestesses of Eilistraee at the Ladystone in Ardeep Forest when Dove interrupts the proceeding by trying to join. Despite some hostility and mistrust from the other priestesses, Qilué agrees to investigate Scornubel. She takes the place of one of the drow impersonators, discovering Daerdatha, a drow spellcaster, is one of the drow leaders. She learns that the humans are being taken into slavery in Chult. However, her cover is blown at a party when she tries to stop a human from being abducted and replaced. She is wounded by the drow, who attempt to drown her, but she survives due to waterbreathing magic and escapes, managing to form a mental link to Brelma, one of the drow, in the process. She follows Brelma to a noble ball in Waterdeep, encountering a Harper known as Dauntless, and witnesses a meeting between Brelma and Mrilla Malsander, an ambitious merchant. Qilué realizes that the investigation needs an expert on Waterdeep to continue, and enters Blackstaff Tower to speak with Laeral Silverhand.
