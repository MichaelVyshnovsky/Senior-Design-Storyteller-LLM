'''''Dragon''''' is one of the two official magazines for source material for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', first published in 1976. Its sister publication is ''[[Dungeon magazine]]''.

==History==
;TSR:
In 1975, [[TSR, Inc.|TSR.]] began publishing ''The Strategic Review''. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself. The following year, after only seven issues, TSR cancelled ''The Strategic Review'' and replaced it with ''The Dragon'', which later became ''Dragon'' with [[Dragon magazine 39|issue #39]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/22/Dragon Rumbles}}
[[File:Dragon_magazine_39.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of [[Dragon magazine 39|''Dragon'' #39]] from 1980]]
A compilation of the first 250 issues was released; also included were the 7 issues of ''The Strategic Review''. This compilation is known as the software title ''Dragon Magazine Archive''.

;Wizards of the Coast:
[[Wizards of the Coast]] purchased TSR and its intellectual properties, including ''Dragon'', in 1997. Production was then transferred from Wisconsin to Washington state. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by [[wikipedia:Hasbro|Hasbro]], ''Dragon'' suffered a five-month gap between [[Dragon magazine 236|#236]] and [[Dragon magazine 237|#237]] but remained published by TSR as a subsidiary of WotC starting September 1997 with [[Dragon magazine 239|issue #239]],<ref>''[[Dragon magazine 239|issue #239]]''(1997-09) and until [[Dragon magazine 267|#267]] in January 2000 when Wizards of the Coast became the listed ''de facto'' publisher.<ref>''[[Dragon magazine 267|#267]]'' (2000-01)

;Paizo Publishing:
In 2002, [[Paizo Publishing]] acquired the rights to publish both ''Dragon'' and '' Dungeon'' under license from Wizards of the Coast. '' Dragon'' was published by Paizo starting September 2002 with [[Dragon magazine 299|issue #299]]. It tied ''Dragon'' more closely to ''Dungeon'' by including articles supporting and promoting its major multi-issue adventures such as the "Age of Worms" and "Savage Tide". "Class Acts", monthly one- or two-page articles offering ideas for developing specific character classes, were also introduced by Paizo.

On April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that it would not be renewing Paizo's licenses for ''Dragon''. The final printed issue was [[Dragon magazine 359|#359]] in September 2007.

;Digital:
Shortly after the last print issue shipped, Wizards of the Coast re-launched ''Dragon'' as an online magazine, continuing the issue numbering of the print edition. The first digital edition was [[Dragon magazine 360|#360]] in October 2007

In [[Dragon magazine 427|Issue #427]] (September 2013), an article by Wizards of the Coast game designer and editor [[Chris Perkins]] announced that ''Dragon'' would be going on hiatus starting January 2014 pending the release of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 5{{th}} edition. <ref>{{Cite dragon/427/Editorial: Going Dark}} The final edition of ''Dragon'' released was issue [[Dragon magazine 430|#430]] in December 2013.

;Dragon+:
A new and fully digital bi-monthly publication called ''[[Dragon+]]'', was launched on April 30, 2015,<ref>{{Cite dragon+/1/Letter From The Editor}} succeeding the existing versions of ''Dragon'' and ''Dungeon'' magazines. Created by Dialect in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, the online edition ceased continuity with the printed and digital versions of both magazines and restarted its numbering system for issues at No. 1.

==Content== 
Although ''Dragon'' was originally designed to support the roleplaying industry in general, it has always been primarily a house organ for role-playing games with a particular focus on ''D&D''.

Most of the magazine's articles provide supplementary material for the game including new [[prestige class]]es, [[:Category:Races|races]], [[:Category:Creatures|monsters]] and many other subjects that can be used to enhance a ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game. Other articles will provide tips and suggestions for players and DMs. 
[[File:dragon128.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of [[Dragon magazine 128|''Dragon Magazine'' #128]] from 1987]]
In the early 1980s, almost every issue of ''Dragon'' would contain a role playing adventure, a simple board game, or some kind of special game supplement (such as a cardboard cut-out castle). These bonus features become infrequent after the 1986 launch of ''Dungeon'' magazine, which published several new Dungeons & Dragons adventures in each issue.
