        "mainbody": "Broderick Betrayed was a play written sometime before the midâ€“8 century DR, most likely touching on the Chosen of Mystra.\nThe sage Beldrune claimed he favored the play Broderick Betrayed, once, in a conversation with his fellow Tabarast during the spring of the  while he was working in Moonshorn Tower. Tabarast then recited part of the play, Beldrune called him out for it, as they had agreed not to talk about the Chosen of Mystra, strongly implying the play was about them."
