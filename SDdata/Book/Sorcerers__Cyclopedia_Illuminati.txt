Sorcerers Cyclopedia Illuminati was a unique enchanted tome of arcane knowledge from Myth Drannor.
This book had a thick cover with a large image of an eye emblazoned on it.
The owner of this book was granted a boon of increased intelligence and resistance to spells and spell-like abilities. Additionally, this book allowed its owner to cast a powerful version of the true seeing spell. The Cyclopedia Illuminatis enchantments allowed it to be used only by arcane spellcasters.
In 1369 DR, Sorcerers Cyclopedia Illuminati could be recovered from an ancient library within the First Cellars of the Elven Catacombs of myth Drannor. Even though most books were destroyed by ravages of time, the  Cyclopedia Illuminati and Clerics Tome of Truths were preserved by their enchantments and wondrously were untouched by grave-robbing drow and Cult of the Dragon invaders thanks to a dark naga who laired there.
