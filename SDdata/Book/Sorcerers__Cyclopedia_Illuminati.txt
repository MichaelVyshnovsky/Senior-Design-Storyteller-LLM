'''''Sorcerers' Cyclopedia Illuminati''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] tome of arcane knowledge from [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
This [[book]] had a thick cover with a large image of an eye emblazoned on it.

==Powers==
The owner of this book was granted a boon of increased intelligence and resistance to spells and spell-like abilities. Additionally, this book allowed its owner to cast a powerful version of the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell. The ''Cyclopedia Illuminati's'' enchantments allowed it to be used only by arcane spellcasters.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], ''Sorcerers' Cyclopedia Illuminati'' could be recovered from an ancient library within the First Cellars of the [[Elven Catacombs]] of myth Drannor. Even though most books were destroyed by ravages of time, the '' Cyclopedia Illuminati'' and ''[[Clerics' Tome of Truths]]'' were preserved by their enchantments and wondrously were untouched by grave-robbing [[drow]] and [[Cult of the Dragon]] invaders thanks to a [[dark naga]] who laired there.
