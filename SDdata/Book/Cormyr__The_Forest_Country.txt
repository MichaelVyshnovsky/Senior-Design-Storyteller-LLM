Cormyr The Forest Country was a book about the kingdom of Cormyr written some time before the mid–14 century DR.
By 1357 DR, a thick copy written in a Faerûnian language sat on a podium in the Spire of the Fire Ochimo in Opawangchicheng on Akari Island, off the coast of Shou Lung in the Celestial Sea. However, water leakage had reduced it almost to mush.
