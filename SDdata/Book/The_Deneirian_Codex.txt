'''''The Deneirian Codex''''' was a thick book about the [[god]] [[Deneir]]. It described the nature and aspects of Deneir, the tenets of the faith, and modes of worship.

The [[wizard]] and eventual [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] was a zealous worshiper of Deneir, and had a sanctified shrine to the god in his home of [[Barrenstone]]. He kept a copy of the tome on the shrine's altar.
