The Deneirian Codex was a thick book about the god Deneir. It described the nature and aspects of Deneir, the tenets of the faith, and modes of worship.
The wizard and eventual lich Adzerak was a zealous worshiper of Deneir, and had a sanctified shrine to the god in his home of Barrenstone. He kept a copy of the tome on the shrines altar.
