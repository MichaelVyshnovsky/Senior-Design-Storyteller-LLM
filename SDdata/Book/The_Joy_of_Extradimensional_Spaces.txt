'''''The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces''''' was a tome on extradimensional spaces, especially those created by ''[[Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion]]''.

==Description==
The tome was notably heavy and richly bound in ornate [[leather]] with details in [[gold]] filigree. The front cover was illustrated with a portrait of the legendary [[archwizard]] [[Mordenkainen]].

The [[wizard]] [[Fistandia]] had researched the tome extensively, adding her own notes in arcane shorthand to its margins. These notes explained how Fistandia created a permanent ''Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion'', as well as the command word for gaining access to it.

==History==
At some point prior to the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces'' was bequeathed to the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]] upon the disappearance of Fistandia, along with the rest of her collection. Fistandia had spent many years researching [[magic|the Art]] at Candlekeep, usually in her favorite private study room.

Some time after Fistandia's disappearance, the sage [[Matreous]] happened to be assigned her old study room. Through a routine casting of ''[[detect magic]]'', he discovered an inactive magical gateway in Fistandia's room. Matreous's further investigations revealed that Fistandia would stay in the study room for weeks at a time, and was rarely seen leaving to eat or sleep. He concluded that Fistandia must have traveled through the gateway somehow. Matreous searched through the books donated by Fistandia until he stumbled upon ''The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces''. He deciphered the command word for the magical gateway and stepped through, but failed to return.

==Powers==
Speaking the command word "scepter" while ''The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces'' was in Fistandia's study room in Candlekeep activated a magical gateway to [[Fistandia's mansion|Fistandia's extradimensional mansion]].
