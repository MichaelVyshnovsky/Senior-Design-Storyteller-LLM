Tears of Selûne was a hauntingly beautiful and sad ballad by the Harper bard Finder Wyvernspur.
Tears of Selûne was a melancholic love song that told a tale about the goddess of the moon Selûne weeping for her lover, the sun, because they were on the other side of Toril from each other.
Tears of Selûne was one of many songs, ballads, and poems created by a proud and arrogant Finder Wyvernspur. His uncanny talent and popularity eventually clouded his judgment, and he committed a terrible crime trying to preserve his body of work. His fellow Harpers held a tribunal and deemed him guilty. As a punishment, Harpers, with the aid of Elminster Aumar, removed Finders name, making him the Nameless Bard, and removed all memories and records of his work from the Realms. Finder himself was locked away in a prison, the Citadel of White Exile on another plane.
In 1357 DR, Tears of Selûne returned to the realms with Alias, who was a construct daughter of the Nameless Bard filled to the brim with his works. She was created to have a beautiful voice indeed, she was the perfect successor of his art. She, in turn, taught Tears of Selûne to her traveling companion, the halfling bard Olive Ruskettle, who was not shy in performing the lost piece of art and sharing it through the region.
