'''''Tears of Selûne''''' was a hauntingly beautiful and sad ballad by the [[Harper]] [[bard]] [[Finder Wyvernspur]].

==Description==
''Tears of Selûne'' was a melancholic love song that told a tale about the goddess of the moon [[Selûne]] weeping for her lover, [[the sun]], because they were on the other side of Toril from each other.

==History==
''Tears of Selûne'' was one of many songs, ballads, and poems created by a proud and arrogant Finder Wyvernspur. His uncanny talent and popularity eventually clouded his judgment, and he committed a terrible crime trying to preserve his body of work. His fellow Harpers held a tribunal and deemed him guilty. As a punishment, Harpers, with the aid of [[Elminster Aumar]], removed Finder's name, making him the Nameless Bard, and removed all memories and records of his work from the Realms. Finder himself was locked away in a prison, the [[Citadel of White Exile]] on another [[plane]].

In [[1357 DR]], ''Tears of Selûne'' returned to the realms with [[Alias]], who was a [[construct]] daughter of the Nameless Bard filled to the brim with his works. She was created to have a beautiful voice; indeed, she was the perfect successor of his art. She, in turn, taught ''Tears of Selûne'' to her traveling companion, the [[halfling]] bard [[Olive Ruskettle]], who was not shy in performing the lost piece of art and sharing it through the region.
