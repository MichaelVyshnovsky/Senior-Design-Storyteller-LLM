Corsairs of the Great Sea is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.
Corsairs of the Great Sea focuses on the Corsairs, the pirates of the Great Sea. It offers a detailed look at the corsair culture, their ships, tactics, and their way of life. The supplement provides players and Dungeon Masters with new rules, character kits, and adventure ideas tailored to seafaring campaigns.
Corsairs of the Great Sea offers five adventures (plus a sixth encounter), one of which sends the player characters after an evil ghul-kin cult thats sacrificing children, a couple of others depend crucially on traitors betraying the PCs, and in one the PCs are spies.
