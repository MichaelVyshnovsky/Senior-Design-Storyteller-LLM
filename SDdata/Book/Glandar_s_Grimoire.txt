The Glandars Grimoire was an ancient spellbook that originated in Unther. Its remains contained four unique arcane spells.
As of 1367 DR all that remained of the grimoire was a charred husk containing five pages. It was unknown what the tome appeared like before being burned. The surviving front of the book was covered in the hide of a black dragon. The hide was stretched over a piece of slate and stitched with wire that also held the remaining pages. The back cover of the book, as well as any additional pages, were lost to the flames.
The recovered damaged grimoire was stored and preserved in an octagonal coffer artistically carved from ivory. The coffers hinges and clasps were made from electrum.
The first page of the grimoire bore the inscription "The Grimoire Most Perilous of The Immortal Glandar, Lord of the Undying, Scepter of Glandara."
