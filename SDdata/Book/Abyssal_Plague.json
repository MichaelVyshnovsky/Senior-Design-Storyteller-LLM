            "Origins": "The Chained God [[Tharizdun]] stirs in his prison in [[Pandemonium]]. On the world of [[Nerath]], Tharizdun makes contact with one of his disciples, who is instructed to use a fragment of an artifact known as the [[Living Gate]] to pierce Tharizdun's prison and allow the god to free himself. As Tharizdun's plan is underway, the benevolent deities Ioun and Pelor move to foil him through their own mortal champions, among which is [[Demascus]], the Sword of the Gods. The champions chase the disciple and his minions from Nerath unto [[Sigil]] and finally into Pandemonium itself, but are unable to stop the ritual in time. The entity known as the [[Voidharrow]] slips out of Tharizdun's prison, imbued with a fraction of the god's willpower. The Voidharrow manifests itself as a liquid, crystalline substance, and in the ensuing fight, parts of the Voidharrow fall into portals leading to the worlds of Athas and Toril. Demascus also falls through one of the portals.\n\nOn Nerath, the Voidharrow is captured by a wizard.{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|1057}} Through a convoluted series of events involving the green dragon Vestapalk,{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|2228}} Orcus,{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|4553}} and an agent of the Voidharrow known as Nu Alin,{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|3115}} the Voidharrow is eventually freed and possesses Vestapalk.{{Cite digital book/The Mark of Nerath/Kindle|4897}}"
