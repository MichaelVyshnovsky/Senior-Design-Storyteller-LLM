The event revolves around the Voidharrow, an entity from a dead universe that is unleashed across multiple worlds. Two of the novels in the Abyssal Plague series are set in the Forgotten Realms.\nthumb|Narrative structure of the Abyssal Plague event.\nThe Abyssal Plague event was divided into three parts\n*Origins the beginning of the Plague, and introductions to most of the main characters\n*Plague Strikes the main trilogy of novels, set on the world of Nerath\n*Plague Spreads how the Plague affected the worlds of Toril and Athas\nThe Chained God Tharizdun stirs in his prison in Pandemonium. On the world of Nerath, Tharizdun makes contact with one of his disciples, who is instructed to use a fragment of an artifact known as the Living Gate to pierce Tharizduns prison and allow the god to free himself. As Tharizduns plan is underway, the benevolent deities Ioun and Pelor move to foil him through their own mortal champions, among which is Demascus, the Sword of the Gods. The champions chase the disciple and his minions from Nerath unto Sigil and finally into Pandemonium itself, but are unable to stop the ritual in time. The entity known as the Voidharrow slips out of Tharizduns prison, imbued with a fraction of the gods willpower. The Voidharrow manifests itself as a liquid, crystalline substance, and in the ensuing fight, parts of the Voidharrow fall into portals leading to the worlds of Athas and Toril. Demascus also falls through one of the portals.\nOn Nerath, the Voidharrow is captured by a wizard. Through a convoluted series of events involving the green dragon Vestapalk, Orcus, and an agent of the Voidharrow known as Nu Alin, the Voidharrow is eventually freed and possesses Vestapalk.\nFollow up with Sword of the Gods by reading Spinner of Lies.
