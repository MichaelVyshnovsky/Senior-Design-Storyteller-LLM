Dethek Dialects and Diction was a book all about Dethek, the runic script of the Dwarven language, and its unique style of phrasing and writing. Among its contents was a guide for translating Dethek into the alphabet of Common.
The book was a rather large, weighty tome with a bright green cover.
One copy of this tome laid within Bard Keep, a temple of Oghma that stood within the North near Silverymoon.
