Luskan Threat to Neverwinter was an anonymously penned report dedicated to the city of Luskan and its nefarious attempts to destabilize Neverwinter, its bitter rival.
The report was dedicated to the late 14 century DR political rivalry between Luskan and Neverwinter. The book described Luskans modus operandi. The City of Sails was subtle and attempted to clandestinely weaken Neverwinter by eroding its political alliances and trade routes. The ruler of Neverwinter at the time was Lord Nasher Alagondar, who constantly attempted to beat Luskan in the game of politics by forging alliances with neighboring nations and city-states. The report also openly accused Luskans ambassador in Neverwinter at the time, Torio Claven, of being a spy and warned he was not to be trusted. Additionally, the report warned Neverwinter of Luskans plans to assassinate Lord Nasher, and even if the attempt were to be unsuccessful, the City of Sails would be able to exploit the ensuing chaos. Lastly, the anonymous source of the report stated that Luskan was planning to wage war against Neverwinter but was likely to be distracted by a conflict with Ruathym before the City of Sails was to make a military move against the Jewel of the North.
As of the , a copy of the Luskan Threat to Neverwinter report was kept in the Neverwinter Archives of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North.
