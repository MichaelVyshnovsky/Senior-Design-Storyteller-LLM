'''''Adventures on the Sea of Fallen Stars''''' was a collection of stories about legendary pirates of the [[Realms]], published some time before late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]..

==Contents==
The stories in the book included one of a struggle between Gracie Gravehart and the evil pirate Lord Buckler. One of the scenes depicted the two crossing their [[cutlass]]es in battle over the freedom of the people of the isle of Everwind following the pirate's ship being sunk. Following the battle, Gracie Gravehart was crowned the queen of Everwind who continued sailing her ship, ''Liberty'', until her death. She was buried on the island, and the key from her crypt was tossed into [[Umberlee]]'s depths. Legends said that sailors could still see the ''Liberty's'' red said far in the sea in the early morning at the very beginning of dawn.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Night-Night, Pirate Ship'' belonged to [[Lora]], a drunkard sailor from [[Baldur's Gate]], whose daughter, [[Vanra]], was consumed by a [[hag]] seeking to produce offspring. The book was a gift, evidenced by the writing on the inner cover that read: "Lots of love, Uncle [[Tim Twofingers]]."
