        "mainbody": "ight of the Seven Swords is a 1-edition Dungeons & Dragons adventure module published in 1986 for the Oriental Adventures setting, which was later linked to the Forgotten Realms in the Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms setting.\nNight of the Seven Swords was published as a 48-page booklet with an outer folder. The module was written by Jon Pickens, David Cook, Harold Johnson, Rick Swan, Ed Carmien, and David James Ritchie, with cover art drawn by Clyde Caldwell and interior art by James Holloway\nNight of the Seven Swords is the second adventure produced for Oriental Adventures and is suggested for a party of 6–8 level 4–6 player characters. The module comes in the form of a 48-page booklet inside a 3-part wraparound cover that can be used as a Dungeon Masters (DM) screen. The inside cover shows the plans to the castle Ito-Jo, presented in the \"exploded view\" previously used in the Dungeoneers Survival Guide. The cover also has a more conventional groundplan of the dungeon beneath the castle, and of an inn which is featured in the adventure. A full-color map of Maeshi Province is seen on the outside of the cover, visible to the players when the cover is stood up as a DMs screen. The booklet begins with a 3-page background section that details the geography and history of Maeshi province, followed by information for the DM and notes on setting up the adventure.\nNight of the Seven Swords includes four linked scenarios. The player characters must penetrate a haunted castle to retrieve several relics from the castle, but the forces of Lord Korimori try to stop their efforts.\nNight of the Seven Swords concerns a rivalry between two clans, a haunted castle, and a box of relics. After an encounter in which the party is required to be suitably honorable, the characters explore the haunted castle of Ito-Jo. After attaining their objective in the castle, the characters must make a delivery, while avoiding the machinations of their lords rival.\n* Introduction\n* DM Background\n* Part I Ito-jo, The Ghost Castle\n* Part II Beneath The Ghost Castle\n* Part III A Day in the Country\n* Part IV Yakuzas Honor\n •  •  • Ito Chomei • Ito Gohei • Ito Kiku •  • Keeper of the Key •  • Kiyosu Kuroda • Otomo Tahiro • Reaper • Sei •  • Sunsho Daji •  • Tsushima • \n •  •  •  •  ( •  • ) •  •  •  •  •  • krakentua •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  • \n • \nItems  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nPotions  •  •  •  • \nSpells  •  •  •  • \nOthers \nTechniques  •  •  •  • \nArt & Literature  • \nClasses \nClothing  •  •  •  •  • \nFood & Drinks  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nGemstones  •  • \nItems  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMaterials & Substances  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nVegetation  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nWeapons  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nNight of the Seven Swords Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\nNight of the Seven Swords artwork.jpg|Cover art.\n* Design and Development Jon Pickens, David “Zeb” Cook, Harold Johnson, Rick Swan, Ed Carmien, David James Ritchie\n* Editing Karen S.
