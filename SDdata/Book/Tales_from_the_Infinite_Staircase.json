        "mainbody": "'''''Tales from the Infinite Staircase''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure anthology. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|'''THE INFINITE STAIRCASE IS A PLANEWALKER'S DREAM. BUT A DREAM CAN TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE....'''\n\n''Stretching to every plane imaginable, the Infinite Staircase is one of the best-kept secrets of planar travel in the multiverse. Watched over by the mysterious [[lillend]]i, the Staircase stretches in all directions, bending back upon itself to form the ultimate three-dimensional maze &ndash; and every landing where the Staircase stops, a doorway to a new planar location awaits the traveler.''\n\n''The chaotic morass of energy and matter filling [[Limbo]] holds a dark secret &ndash; the same secret found in the depths of [[Baator]], in an underground [[formian]] hive-city on [[Arcadia]], and in a battle-torn [[githyanki]] fortress on the [[Astral Plane]]. Using the Infinite Staircase, a group of planewalkers must travel to these far-flung locations, and elsewhere, to learn of a new threat to the planes &ndash; and stop it. Exploring the Staircase itself can be dangerous, particularly when it's ravaged by a barmy fiend and even crazier sorceress.''\n\nTales from the Infinite Staircase ''features eight separate but linked adventures presented in a new format. The adventures can be played in any order, yet each scenario impacts upon and changes those played after it. Further, the PCs can return to the original scenario locations and find that the conditions have changed so more adventuring is possible. Each of the eight adventures can also be played separately.''\n\nTales from the Infinite Staircase ''can be linked with the epic adventure from the Fᴏʀɢᴏᴛᴛᴇɴ Rᴇᴀʟᴍs<sup>&reg;</sup> setting, ''[[For Duty & Deity]]'', wherein the heroes must traverse the Infinite Staircase to reach the foreboding realm of [[Graz'zt]], a wicked lord of the [[Abyss]].''}}",
