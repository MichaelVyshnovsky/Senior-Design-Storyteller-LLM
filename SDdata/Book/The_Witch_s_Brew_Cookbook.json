        "mainbody": "'''''The Witch's Brew Cookbook''''' was a [[book]] that collected recipes for [[hag]] delicacies, authored by the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "Contents": "This strange hag cookbook included a recipe for something called \"Eye Scream\". The recipe called for two tablespoons of plucked eyes of [[newt]]s, two cups of brackish swamp water (from the [[Lizard Marsh]]), half a cup of lovely swamp [[blueberries]], three whole cups of milk of [[gorgon]] (could be substituted with [[cow]]'s milk), and one cup of good intentions (or some other sugary sweetener).\n\nThe witch author suggested the use of a medium-sized [[bronze]] cauldron for this delicacy. Newts' eyes, blueberries, and water were all cooked, mashed, and reduced until the mixture was thick as mud. Next, on a medium fire, the sweetener was gradually stirred into the sludge. The mixing had to be done vigorously with a [[holly]] branch to avoid burning. Then, the cauldron was taken off the heat, and the milk of gorgon was slowly stirred into the cooling base. When thoroughly incorporated, the hag cook finished by casting the ''[[ray of frost]]'' [[spell]] on the mix. Thenâ€”ready to serve!",
        "History": "''The Witch's Brew Cookbook'' could be found in the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh's lair in the Lizard Marsh to the west of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]."
