        "mainbody": "The Witchs Brew Cookbook was a book that collected recipes for hag delicacies, authored by the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh sometime before 1372 DR.\nThis strange hag cookbook included a recipe for something called \"Eye Scream\". The recipe called for two tablespoons of plucked eyes of newts, two cups of brackish swamp water (from the Lizard Marsh), half a cup of lovely swamp blueberries, three whole cups of milk of gorgon (could be substituted with cows milk), and one cup of good intentions (or some other sugary sweetener).\nThe witch author suggested the use of a medium-sized bronze cauldron for this delicacy. Newts eyes, blueberries, and water were all cooked, mashed, and reduced until the mixture was thick as mud. Next, on a medium fire, the sweetener was gradually stirred into the sludge. The mixing had to be done vigorously with a holly branch to avoid burning. Then, the cauldron was taken off the heat, and the milk of gorgon was slowly stirred into the cooling base. When thoroughly incorporated, the hag cook finished by casting the ray of frost spell on the mix. Thenâ€”ready to serve!\nThe Witchs Brew Cookbook could be found in the Green Hag of Lizard Marshs lair in the Lizard Marsh to the west of Daggerford circa 1372 DR."
