Each of the divine sisters shed a portion of their magic into a new deity – a being of pure [[Art]]. As such, Mystryl became the absolute mistress of all magic in the world, forming it into the ''[[weave]]'', a way to harness magic. She was the weave.\n\nThe book continued to describe the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, when Mystryl perished and was reborn as the new goddess of magic – [[Mystra]], as the outcome of the [[Karsus's Folly]], the ancient event in which [[Netherese]] lord [[Karsus]] sought to take the magic of Mystryl for himself. She ended her own existence to stop Karsus from achieving his goals, temporarily unweaving all magic in the world, which became the end of the Netherese Empire."
