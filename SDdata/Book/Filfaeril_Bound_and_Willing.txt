'''''Filfaeril Bound and Willing''''' was a scandalous and outrageous [[chapbook]],{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2014)/Questions on Filfaeril and Manshoon}} that depicted the Dragon Queen [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] in salacious scenarios, published some time in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime after its publication in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the chapbook was banned in [[Cormyr]]. Yet it continued to be circulated in the Realms beyond Cormyr by means of caravan trade routes.

With the authorship of ''Filfaeril Bound and Willing'' being unknown to the public, rumors slowly spread that it was authored by [[Bannermere]], a shy young [[Heralds of Faerûn|Herald]] to whom it became common knowledge (much to his embarrassment) had penned salacious chapbooks often sold as far as [[Scornubel]] and [[Waterdeep]]. Beyond the identity of the author, people speculated in hushed whispers that the Dragon Queen herself secretly enjoyed the salacious work, owing to rumors of her love for [[whip]]s and [[chain]]s. Filfaeril Obarskyr, however, remained silent on the topic.
