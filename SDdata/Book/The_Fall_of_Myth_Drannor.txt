'''''The Fall of Myth Drannor''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|''The Fall of Myth Drannor is an accessory detailing those horrible years encompassing the [[Weeping War]], for use with [[Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves]] book. Herein you will find the causes of the fall of the most lyrical of elf cities; highlights of the twelve campaigns and their most significant battles; copious adventure hooks for involving player characters in behind-the-scenes activities; and new (or should we say ancient?) magical items and spells, most of which have been lost in time.''

''From the passing of [[Eltargrim Irithyl|Coronal Eltargrim]] to the shattering of the [[Khov'Anilessa]]'s invisible prison to the stand at [[Honorsgate]], the painful history of the Fall lies within these pages.  Now comes the opportunity for heroes to be made—or become part of the history in their attempts.''}}
