        "mainbody": "'''''Tall Tales: A Ranger's Life''''' was a [[book]] by [[ranger]] known as [[Amritar the Tall]], published in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Do ye remember an inn, Tessyrana? Old and dark and rambling, lost in the arms of the wild woods a long day's ride from anywhereâ€“but warm and firelit within, against the chill winds of the storm. The smoke stung our eyes, and its old and spicy smell enshrouded us as it did everything else in the house. We climbed worn, curving stairs away from the ready laughter and [[ale]], into a [[candle]]lit room, a cozy den nestled amid others in the night, carved out of low beams, gentle mutterings and creakings, and uneven floors. And for one night, at least, that plain, tiny, and friendly little room was our home.''|Excerpt from ''Tall Tales: A Ranger's Life''}}",
