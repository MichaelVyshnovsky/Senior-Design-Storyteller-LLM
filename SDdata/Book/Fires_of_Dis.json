        "mainbody": "'''''Fires of Dis''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure module. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting. \n\n{{Quote|''Sneaking into the second layer of foul Bagtor ain't easy, but with a little help from the right high-up men, it can be done. 'Course, exactly who the right high-up men are can give a basher pause, so it's often best not to ask. But there's a sword to be found, and bloods needed to find it. Truth is, those who don't end up lost are sure to find out that no good deed goes unpunished!''\n\n''Fires of Dis is a PLANESCAPE adventure for four to six characters of 5th to 9th levels. From [[Sigil]], the City of Doors, the heroes plunge head-first into a dangerous journey across the Outer Planes. Their quest for a stolen sword leads them to the hostile gate-town of Ribcage, the treacherous plane of [[Baator]], and the disciplined burg of Fortitude - a gate-town teetering between two planes, just waiting for something to tip the scales. Your player characters need wits as keen as their steel to brave the fires of [[Dis]] - and survive!''}}",
