'''''Bowgentle's Book''''' was a compilation of the [[magic]]al teachings of the [[mage]] [[Bowgentle]] of [[Silverymoon]].

==Description==
[[File:Bowgentle's Rune.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The rune of Bowgentle.'']]
The cover of the book was made from a thin slab of slate bound in [[Amn]]ian [[ox|yoxen]] leather that was dyed a glossy black color. It was embossed with a pattern of a [[human]] and a [[dragon]] and had an oval plate on its center that had Bowgentle's [[mage sigil|personal rune]]. There were 53 sheets of vellum in the book, sewn into the spine with [[silk]].

==History==
Bowgentle sought [[magic]]al knowledge from many dangerous locations in [[Faer√ªn]] during his years. In his old age, the mage stopped by the [[House of Wonder]], wrote down his spells, and shared them with the apprentices there. When Bowgentle died, and the Masters of the school learned of his passing, they ordered a compilation of his spells to be written and titled it ''Bowgentle's Book''. It was closely guarded in the school's library.

Some years later, [[fiend]]s attacked the school, slew the masters and most of the apprentices, and burned its walls and towers. [[Thieves]] looted the school, while it was still smoldering, and among their loot was ''Bowgentle's Book''. Years later, it appeared in a cache of goods acquired by the master thief [[Vaerum]] in [[Scornubel]] and was accurately identified by the sage [[Laertilus]]. Vaerum's guild found itself in a "gray war" with another group of thieves and the spellbook vanished. Its whereabouts were unknown as of [[1359 DR]].

The [[banshee]] [[Agatha]] said, apparently truthfully, that she traded ''Bowgentle's Book'' to [[Tsernoth]], a [[necromancer]] from [[Iriaebor]] some time before [[1391 DR]], but did not know the whereabouts of the book after that.<ref><ref group="note">This is "more than a hundred years ago" from ''circa'' [[1491 DR]].

==Contents== 
The book's 53 pages contained many common and uncommon spells, two that were unique as of its publication and one that was crafted by Bowgentle himself. Three pages were dedicated to applications and preparations for the spell ''[[cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]''. These were the spells inscribed in the book:
