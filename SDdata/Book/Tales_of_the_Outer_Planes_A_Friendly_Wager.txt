"A Friendly Wager" is an adventure module for beginner players set in Olympus, where the players must talk to Zeus in order to be released from his domain.
Upon arrival, adventurers are greeted by Hermes in diguise, who explains that Zeus had placed a barrier around the realm that can only be crossed with his verbal consent. Thus, they must wander Olympus until they come across Zeus himself, coming across King Hiyawat, Zeus white eagle, the owl Brobane, and must fight an aerohydra, before climbing Mount Aetna to meet with Prometheus, and finally being led to Zeus by the nymph Daphne. Along the way they learn of a wager between Apollo and Hermes, and that Hera has become involved.
Upon arriving at the oracle of Zeus, they are returned to their lands, but may carry the enmity of one or more gods with them.
