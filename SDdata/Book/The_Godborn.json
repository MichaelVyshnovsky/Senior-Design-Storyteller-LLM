It follows [[The Twilight War]] Trilogy.\n\n{{Quote |''The shadow legacy of [[Erevis Cale]] lives on even as his old foe [[Mephistopheles]] seeks to stamp it out at any cost. Cale's son [[Vasen Cale|Vasen]]—unmoored in time by the god [[Mask]]—has thus far been shielded from the archdevil's dark schemes, alone among the servants of the [[Amaunator|Lord of Light]] who have raised him since birth.''\n...<br/>\n''At the crossroads of divine intrigue and mortal destiny, unlikely heroes unite to thwart the powers of shadow and hell, and the [[Second Sundering|sundering of worlds]] is set on its course.''|The Godborn}}",
        "Summary": "Putting the pieces into place, Mask had sent [[Varra]], the lover of Erevis Cale and pregnant with his child, into the future past the [[Spellplague]]. Varra is found by Derreg, son of Regg and brought to safety only to deliver her child, Vasen Cale, and then die during childbirth.\n\nVasen is raised under the faith of the newly revealed [[Amaunator]], as a [[paladin]]. He lived his life as an escort to the faithful of Amaunator to the [[Abbey of the Rose]], a temple veiled from the [[Shadovar]] that dominated [[Sembia]]. He also acted as protector to the [[Oracle]], the simple son of [[Abelar Corrinthal]]. During an escort of pilgrims out of the valley, the Oracle sends away everyone, knowing the fate about to befall everyone.\n\nAlong with [[Orsin]], a [[shadowalker]] that was accompanying the pilgrims, Vasen investigates signs of a struggle, only to find a village slaughtered by the hands of [[Sayeed]] and [[Zeeahd]], brothers transformed by the Spellplague and on on a mission from Mephistopheles to find the son of Erevis Cale. They encounter [[Gerak]], a hunter and former soldier, trying to help his wife who was infected by Zeeahd by a diabolical sludge. It is also revealed that the brothers were seeking the Oracle. With that, Gerak, Orsin, and Vasen head back to the abbey as quickly as they can.\n\nThe trio find the valley alight by several [[spined devil]]s, which have accompanied Sayeed and Zeeahd. Fighting their way through the devils and Sayeed, Vasen makes his way to one of the towers in which Zeeahd is confronting the Oracle. The Oracle reveals that Vasen is the son of Erevis and then sacrifices himself just before Vasen reaches Zeeahd and his devils. Gerak and Orsin rejoin Vasen and escaped as Zeeahd transforms into a [[bone devil]].\n\nWith the protection of the abbey gone, [[Brennus Tanthul]], prince of the Shadovar, finds Vasen and quickly dispatch his forces. With the devils on their heels and now the Shadovar, Gerak, Orsin, and Vasen make their way to a pond Orsin previously identified as having some connection to his past life and Mask. The pond is now a ''[[portal]]'' and they all enter just before Brennus arrives to stop them.\n\nThe three find themselves in a part of the [[Shadowfell|Shadowfell]] that [[Drasek Riven]], with his sliver of Mask's divinity, connected with [[Cania]], the realm ruled by Mephistopheles and the frozen prison of Erevis Cale. Riven provides a distraction for Mephistopheles and part of his forces while Gerak, Orsin, and Vasen find and release Erevis.\n\nWith Erevis now rescued they all ''[[teleport]]'' to [[Ordulin]] to stop [[Rivalen Tanthul]], who also has a sliver of Mask's divinity and seeks to bring about [[Shar]]'s will to destroy all of [[Toril]]. Rivalen has forced Sayeed into being the vessel from which the words to complete Shar's plan would be read. Rivalen ''teleports'' himself and Mephistopheles to Ordulin as well, bringing all the slivers of Mask to one place. Rivalen then forces Vasen to read the words on Sayeed's body, finishing the elements to finalize Shar's plan. Remembering the words of the Oracle and his dreams, Vasen stops [[Shar's Eye]] from pulling the divinity out of Riven and Mephistopheles. Erevis is able to cut the divinity from Riven, Mephistopheles, and Rivalen. Erevis feels it is his responsibility to take on the godhood, but Riven stops him and convinces him it would be better if he takes it.\n\nDuring the conflict, Erevis and Riven's friend [[Magadon Kest]] had been piloting the floating Shadovar city of [[Sakkors]] towards Ordulin. With the [[mythallar]] that powers the city dying, Magadon leaves it on its course and flees the city. Sakkors bears down on Ordulin as Vasen, Erevis, Gerak, and Orsin leave Rivalen grappled by his revenge-seeking brother, Brennus, to be crushed by the city.",
