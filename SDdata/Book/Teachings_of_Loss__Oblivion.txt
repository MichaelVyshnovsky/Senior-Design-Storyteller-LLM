'''''Teachings of Loss: Oblivion''''' was a [[Sharran]] text, printed before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Only the sacred nothingness will endure.''|Excerpt from ''Teachings of Loss: Oblivion''}}

==Content==
The [[tome]] was dedicated to one of the most important concepts of the Sharran faith: oblivion or emptiness, which was a holy state in the eyes of the Goddess of Loss. The holy text stated that emptiness was to be desired and pursued by Shar's devotees. They were to empty their lives of all earthly attachments and feelings to achieve purity in her eyes. The ''Teachings of Loss: Oblivion'' warned the goddess's followers of temptations of light and life as those things would only fail them in the end.
