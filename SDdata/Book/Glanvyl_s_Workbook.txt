Glanvyls Workbook was a small arcane spellbook penned by the wizard Glanvyl. The book contained several common spells and a unique druid spell.
Glanvyls Workbook only measured a handspan in height, was seven fingers wide, and two fingers thick. A pair of leather-bound wooden boards formed the covers and they were held together by triangular-headed brass nails. The spine was made from heavy hide. The cover was decorated with Glanvyls personal rune and an inscription that read "Glanvylâ€”his Workbook". Both the rune and inscription were burned into the leather and filled with molten copper.
