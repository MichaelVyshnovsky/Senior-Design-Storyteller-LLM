{{quote|'''''Wield Power Granted by the Gods'''''

''Legends tell of brave champions whose unwavering faith earned them the favor of the gods. Empowered by the might and magic of their deity, these devoted characters transcend the realm of mere heroes.''

''This supplement for the D&D game provides everything you need to create divinely inspired characters of any class. Along with new base classes, prestige classes, feats, spells, magic items, and relics, Complete Divine also provides guidelines for incorporating religion -- from mysterious cults to powerful theocracies -- into your campaign.''}}
