Canticle by R.A. Salvatore is a Forgotten Realms novel first published in 1991. It is the first book of the The Cleric Quintet and introduces the characters Cadderly Bonaduce, Danica Maupoissant, and Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder.
In this novel, the wizard Aballister Bonaduce creates the Chaos Curse, a horrible potion that makes people need to fulfill their deepest most personal desire without regard to the consequence. A priest of Talona, Barjin, takes the potion from Aballister and brings it to the Edificant Library, an enemy of Castle Trinity, where Aballister and Barjin work. Barjin makes his way to the library, sneaks into the cellar of the building, and is able to release the ever-smoking potion into the library with the unknowing help of the priest Cadderly. The library deteriorates into pandemonium, but Cadderly, his good friend Danica, the two dwarven brothers Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder, as well as a druid named Newander travel down to the altar of Barjin and kill him, saving, for the time, the library.
An audio book version of this novel does exist, with an introduction by R. A. Salvatore, explaining how it came to be, fan response, and other information about it.
