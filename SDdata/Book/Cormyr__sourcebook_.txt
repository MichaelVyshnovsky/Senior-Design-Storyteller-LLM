'''''Cormyr''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|''One of the oldest and most interesting kingdoms on the continent of Faerûn, [[Cormyr]] is a land of classic fantasy wherein a strong king rules his subjects fairly and evenly, nobles struggle against each other for the little power the king doesn't keep for himself, and adventuring companies clear forests of ferocious monsters for a small share of the crown's treasury. And&mdash;there's magic. ''Lots'' of magic.''

''This booklet will allow DM&trade; and player alike to wander the [[King's Forest]] and the alleys of [[Suzail]] in the mind's eye. It presents indispensable information for any campaign played in the FORGOTTEN REALMS<sup>&reg;</sup> setting, including military and magical forces, rules for obtaining adventuring charters (required by the Crown), and facts about the [[War Wizards]] and [[Council of Mages]].''

''A full-color map of the area details many sites not mentioned in the Campaign Setting, providing the creative DM ideas with which to entertain players for many nights of adventuring.''

''The FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting is required for full use of this product.''}}
