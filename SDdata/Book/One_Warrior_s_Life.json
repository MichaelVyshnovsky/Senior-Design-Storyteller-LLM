        "mainbody": "'''''One Warrior's Life''''' was a [[book]] penned by the famed [[Lion]] of [[Neverwinter]], [[Azlundar]], in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''It is one thing to face a rival with your blade in hand and make a bloody end to all rivalry between you. It is quite another to wage war with [[coin]]s in the shadows and softly striking words in hidden chambers. The second way can kill just as surely–but no one who follows it is lauded as a hero, or grudgingly granted as brave even by one's enemies. There is something in us all that admires those who stand tall and bold in the bright light of day–even when they pay for this boldness with their lives.''|Excerpt from ''One Warrior's Life''}}",
