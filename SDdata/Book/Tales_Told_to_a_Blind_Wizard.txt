{{quote|''In ancient days, [[wizard|sorcerers]] sought to learn the [[One True Spell]] that would give them power over all the world and understanding of all [[magic]]. Some said they'd found it, but such men were usually dismissed as crazed.''|Excerpt from the ''Tales Told to a Blind Wizard''}}

==Contents==
The ''Tales Told to a Blind Wizard'' were written by Halivon Tharnstar, Avowed of [[Mystra]]. Not surprisingly, the tome dealt with beliefs of the [[Mystran]] faith and the search of true magic – the fabled ''One True Spell''. The tome talked about the obsessive search for understanding of ''the Art'' that consumed the lives of ancient wizards. ''Tales'' claimed that some spellcasters were able to discover the ''One True Spell'', but they were dismissed as insane. Halivon personally has met one of those "crazed men" and recounted the meeting in the book. The Avowed of Mystra witnessed spells not touching that man and his ability to weave magics with his mind without uttering a single word. Halivon was under the impression that the "crazed" man was far from it. Instead, he appeared calm, meditative, and content. Halivon Tharnstar was lucky enough to talk to the man who told the Avowed that the ''One True Spell'' was a woman – the goddess Mystra, and that "her kisses were wonderful."

The text also included mentions of the temptations of godhood for wizards, no matter how powerful.{{cite book/The Temptation of Elminster/Hardcover 1998|Back Cover}}
