{{quote|''After a hundred years, [[Jack Ravenwild]]—[[thief]], [[sorcerer]], scoundrel, and accidental hero—is released from a magical confinement, only to fall into the hands of the marquise [[Dresimil Chûmavh]], ruler of an exiled [[drow]] clan who sees an opportunity in Jack.''
 
''Through guile and subterfuge, the wily Jack escapes the drow to discover a new world waiting in his old stomping grounds, [[Raven's Bluff]], a city equally abounding in fortune and danger. Unfortunately for Jack, he is best at stirring up the latter. His former archenemy the Warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] is at large, and she isn't the type to forgive and forget. And worst of all, the drow aren't done with Jack and they mean to get him back.''}}
