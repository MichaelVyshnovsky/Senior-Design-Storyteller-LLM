        "Description": "The song was a half-hour long and told a glorious, passionate, and tragic love story of a revenge-driven [[Walker|ghostwalker]] and a beautiful [[Arya Venkyr|Nightingale]] who tries and fails to save the ghostwalker from himself.It is strongly implied that the ''Ghost and the Maiden'' is a rendition of the story told in the novel ''[[Ghostwalker (novel)|Ghostwalker]]''.",
        "History": "As of {{Yearlink|1480}}, the ''Ghost and the Maiden'' was performed by [[bard]]s and known by commonfolk from [[Silverymoon]] to [[Luskan]]. It was a favorite of the likes of [[Myrin Darkdance]] (who usually found the ballad moving and hopeful in spite of its sadness), the [[dwarf|dwarven]] bard [[Boren]] (despite his relatively clumsy rendition of the song), and the [[assassin]] [[Logenn|Red Logenn]] (who found the length of the song useful for passing the time while stalking his targets)."
