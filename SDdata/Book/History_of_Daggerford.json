The book stated that Daggerfords ruled the city for five generations starting with the first Duke, Rugyar the Just.\nLastly, the book talked about Daggerfords reputation as being perceived by many as nothing but a backwater town that paled in comparison to cities like Waterdeep. The reputation was also affected by many criminals and corrupt politicians taking shelter in Daggerford, away from the law of bigger cities. The book admitted that despite all of that, the population of Daggerford was more diverse and cultured than other similar towns along the Trade Way.\nIn mid 14 century DR the History of Daggerford could be found in most libraries, bookstores, and many homes across the Sword Coast. The tome was especially common in Daggerford itself. The book itself was written and published during the reign of Duke Pwyll Daggerford."
