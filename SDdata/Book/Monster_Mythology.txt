Monster Mythology is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory.
Monster Mythology is the 4 book in the Dungeon Masters Guide Rules series and details the gods of the non-human races and various monsters.
The introductory section of the book delineates the central motif, focusing on deities beyond the human realm. It furnishes an overview on the incorporation of deities within a narrative campaign, elucidating their ubiquitous abilities and categorizing them into a hierarchical structure spanning four levels of potency from Demigod to Greater God.
The bulk of the accessory is dedicated to 131 divine entities, organized into eight segments based on differing mythologies. For each deity, the text provides a comprehensive description, game-related statistics (including the deitys alignment, the prevalent alignment among its followers, its domain of influence, and its emblem). Additionally, each segment offers insights into the deitys avatars and its clergy.
The first appendix offers additional guidance on the development of avatars within the gameplay, covering various scenarios such as the avatars potential abode, instances where it might become a patron to a group of adventurers or elect an adventurer as a companion, situations necessitating rescue, the loss of a magical item, requirements for discovery by player characters, or scenarios where the avatar develops an affection for a mortal character.
The second appendix provides references for Dungeon Masters seeking detailed information on the deities specific to the game worlds within Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.
