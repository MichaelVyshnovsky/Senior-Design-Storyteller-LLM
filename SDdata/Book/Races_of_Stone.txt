{{Quote|'''Dwarves, Gnomes, and Goliaths'''
From underground caverns to rolling canyons to mountain crags, bold adventurers emerge from among the hardiest people&mdash;folk who possess an affinity with the earth itself. Drawing strength and security from their surroundings, along with the skills needed to survive, the champions of these races of stone have etched their names in legend.

This supplement for the D&D game provides detailed information on the psychology, society, culture, behavior, religion, folklore, and other aspects of the races of stone: dwarves, gnomes, and goliaths&mdash;a new race presented here. In addition to new subraces and monster races playable as characters, ''Races of Stone'' also provides new prestige classes, feats, spells, magic items, equipment, monster, and rules for magic rune circles.|Back-cover text}}
