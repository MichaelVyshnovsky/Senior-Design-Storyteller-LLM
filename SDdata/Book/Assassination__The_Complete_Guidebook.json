        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a copy of ''Assassination: The Complete Guidebook'' was stashed on a bookshelf in [[Castle Exeltis]]'s basement. The family's scion mismanaged the once-flourishing winery, and the bookshelves in the castle basement were covered in a thick layer of dust, evidence of a dire literary neglect. Unlike all other books there, the ''Assassination'' tome was clean and well-used. The shelf also hid a secret passage from the basement to the castle's second floor and the lord's chambers with the secret switch hidden behind the copy of the ''Assassination''."
