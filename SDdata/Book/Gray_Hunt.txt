Gray Hunt is an adventure module from the RPGA Legacy of the Green Regent campaign.
The party must violate a treaty between Loudwater and the Zhentarim in order to prevent the possibility of a greater conflict. Orc migrants from the Loudwater side of the territorial border are raiding Zhent land and Loudwater needs to stop them... without anyone knowing that they are doing so.
