'''Gray Hunt''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

==Plot==
The party must violate a treaty between [[Loudwater]] and the [[Zhentarim]] in order to prevent the possibility of a greater conflict. Orc migrants from the Loudwater side of the territorial border are raiding Zhent land and Loudwater needs to stop them... without anyone knowing that they are doing so.

{{quote|So you seek to hear stories of wondrous adventure? Then sit for a while and I will spin you a tale. Like my mother, I am a bard. You may have heard of my mother – she composed the Ballad of the Dream Weaver in Secomber many years ago. Perhaps you have heard of it? Regardless, the tale I have for you this evening is very different. For it is the tale of Loudwater and the Delimbiyr Vale. And this tale begins just a year ago.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}
