The '''''Obscene Grimoire''''', or '''''Mensel's Obscene Grimoire''''', was a mysterious magic [[book|tome]] filled with obscenity and perversion.

==Powers==
The ''Obscene Grimoire'' was a thick book bound in black [[leather]]. Its pages were filled with detailed woodblock print images of violent obscenities and gruesome perversions, leaving no taboo unmolested. The prints magically hid evil rituals and dark runes, and they only revealed themselves in glowing print to those brave enough to go through the tome's pages. The book revealed a summoning ritual to bring forth a ''[[cacodemon]]'' under the reader's command and blessing the reader with the ''[[protection from evil]]'' magics. One use of the ritual led to the ''Obscene Grimoire's'' disappearance. The same happened when someone tried to destroy the profane book.

==History==
Even though the true origins and the history of the time were unknown, its most renowned owner granted the book its name postmortem – ''Mensel's Obscene Grimoire''. Lord Mensel of [[Immersea]] was known as a kind, generous, and humanitarian-to-a-fault nobleman. When the beloved man died of old age in his sleep, his family discovered a secret vault underneath the man's study. It was filled with a small hoard of treasure that included a heavy black book bound in leather – the ''Obscene Grimoire.'' A century after Lord Mensel's death, countless rumors and legends grew around the sinister black tome. One rumor of note came from an [[Arabel]]an seer, who claimed that Lord Mensel fashioned the ''Obscene Grimoire'' for personal use at great expense and ordered everyone involved with the book's creation murdered. Despite this story's dubious authenticity, the legend nevertheless damaged Mensel's name and his family's reputation. Unwilling to keep such an ill-fated book, Mensel's descendants threw the ''Obscene Grimoire'' into a lit brazier only for it to disappear in a puff of fetid-reeking mist.

After leaving the Mensel's family, the ''Obscene Grimoire'' appeared in many hands throughout history, seemingly at random. Always the book disappeared within a couple of years after being found.

In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Mensel's Obscene Grimoire'' was found in the library of the [[Black Raven Monastery]] in the mountains above the [[Ice Lakes]] in [[Northwest Faerûn]].
