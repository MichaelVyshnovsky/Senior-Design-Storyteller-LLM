==Description==
''Arabian Adventures'' was published by TSR, Inc. as a 160-page softcover AD&D campaign rulebook. Design was by [[Jeff Grubb]] with [[Andria Hayday]], a cover by [[Jeff Easley]], and illustrations by [[Karl Waller]].

''Arabian Adventures'' contains over 40 pages of player character kits, including the [[sha'ir]], [[Barber|barber-thieves]], [[Beggar-thief|beggar-thieves]], and other [[rogue]]s, as well as other characteristically Arabian roles such as [[Merchant-rogue|merchants]], [[Moralist|moralistic priests]], [[hakima]]s, [[Mystic (Zakhara)|mystics]], [[mamluk]]s, [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]], and [[Elemental mage|elemental wizards]]. Each kit includes benefits, hindrances, and discussion of the kit's societal role in the desert of Zakhara, the Land of Fate. The rulebook also includes rules for calling upon Fate, the Evil Eye, and discussions of honor, piety, the [[salt bond]], and other characteristics of Arabian society. The rulebook offers a comprehensive list of desert equipment, lists of spells with a desert motif, [[Midani|Arab]] character names, and proficiencies like Haggling and Display Weapon Prowess.<ref>{{Cite dragon/219/Role-playing Reviews: A Thousand and One Adventures|50-51}}
