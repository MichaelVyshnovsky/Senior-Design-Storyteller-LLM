'''''The Life and Times of Grooble Stonepate''''' was a [[book|work]] of fiction featuring a [[dwarf]] named Grooble Stonepate, written and published sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
A copy of ''The Life and Times of Grooble Stonepate'' was kept in the library of [[Zerith Hold]], [[Lord Purdun]]'s stronghold in the city of [[Duhlnarim]] in [[Erlkazar]], around {{Yearlink|1369}}. Lord Purdun's copy was notable for a doodle of Grooble Stonepate on the book's inner cover. The image of was questionable quality and evidently drawn by someone who'd never seen a dwarf.
