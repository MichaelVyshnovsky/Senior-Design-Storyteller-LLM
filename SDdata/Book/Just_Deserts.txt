==Synopsis==
A number of caravans go missing while looking for a route through the [[Scimitar Spires]] to [[Orofin]]. The Master Diviner and Sage, [[Sabkhat el Talab]], leads a party of [[Ja'ur Dai]] raiders to search the area, and goes missing. King [[Azoun IV]] calls on several wizardly adventurers to find him; he arranges for [[Vangerdahast]] to teleport them alongside fifteen [[Purple Dragon knight]]s to the [[Bitter Well Oasis]] so that they begin an investigation.

A [[phaerimm]] device of mass destruction, dormant since the fall of Netheril, is involved; only a weapon created by [[Garavan]] can stop it. The wizards sent by Vangerdahast meet at Bitter Well with [[Udlara]], a camel trader, who sells them camels and handles hiring guides. After they set forth, their caravan is struck by a [[yellow dragon]] who decimates their guards, guides, and camels. A [[serpent lord]] approaches them as they near the fissure where the bodies of previous caravaneers are found; the snake warns them not to go inside.

The story concludes in [[Just Deserts - Part 2]].
