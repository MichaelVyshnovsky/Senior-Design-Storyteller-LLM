Fiction Qawasha & Kupalué Part Two is the second of a three-part short story written by Adam Lee which was featured in Dragon+ Issue #16 as a tie-in to the Tomb of Annihilation adventure. Part One was featured in Dragon+ Issue #15 while Part Three was featured in Dragon+ Issue #19.
Qawasha reflects on befriending Kupalué and the origins of their relationship. Subsequently, he accepts a job to guide a scholar named Samrith Vess and her bodyguard Zara to the ruins of Mezro, and on the way, comes to believe that Samrith is more good-natured than the average treasure-hunter who visits Chult. They make camp and Qawasha tells stories about Mezro in its glory days.
