==Synopsis==
[[Qawasha]] reflects on befriending [[Kupalué]] and the origins of their relationship. Subsequently, he accepts a job to guide a scholar named [[Samrith Vess]] and her bodyguard [[Zara]] to the ruins of [[Mezro]], and on the way, comes to believe that Samrith is more good-natured than the average treasure-hunter who visits [[Chult]]. They make camp and Qawasha tells stories about Mezro in its glory days.
