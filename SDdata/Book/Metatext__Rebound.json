        "mainbody": "Metatext Rebound was a collection of writings by Iosefa Elgin that sought to reconstruct the Metatext, the collection of esoteric knowledge that once granted Deneir his status as a deity.\nThe various volumes of the book were described as being rather thin.\nThis section of the book spoke to the measurable value of a life and a soul, as it was assigned the judgement of the god Kelemvor. It noted that while those that lived a life worthy to be brought back from the dead could seldom afford such a blessing, those that could hardly lived in a manner that warranted the return trip.\nThe author sought to gain firsthand experience about the journey of death and return, once she was both deserving and rich enough to afford it.\nIosefa Elgin wrote about the continued influence the Banite church had on the Zhentarim of the late 15 century. The section spoke of the Pereghost, the mysterious armored warlord who ruled over the fortress of Darkhold in the Sunset Mountains. It asserted that the Zhentarim had not in fact changed their ultimate goal of dominion over the Realms, as some were led to believe, but merely changed their overarching strategy.\nIosefa Elgin was outcast from the church of Deneir for the heresy of writing Metatext Rebound."
