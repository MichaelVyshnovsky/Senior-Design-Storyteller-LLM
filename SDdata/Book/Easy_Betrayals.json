        "mainbody": "Easy Betrayals by Richard Baker is the eighth novella in the Double Diamond Triangle Saga series.\nWhile battle against the Fallen Temple raged in Doegan, pirates Belgin Dree, and Nargin \"Rings\" Olnblade, along with paladins Jacob and Miltiades pursued the greater doppelganger in the guise of Eidola Boareskyr. The warriors pursued her to an ancient crypt deep under the palace of Emperor Aetheric III. In the heat of battle, ancient Netherese glyphs sprang to life and opened a gate through which Eidola escaped. The mercenaries and paladins had no other choice and followed.\nThe group found themselves in dust-swept Netherese ruins of Ularith in the desert of Anauroch. Belgins training in the arcane revealed the origins of the ancient temple – the center of death cult worship with numerous portals that led to hidden tombs across Faerûn, Utter East, Chessenta, and more. The warriors chased the cunning doppelganger across the temple complex, eventually being confronted by its lich-lord protector. Miltiades stood up to the undead sentry but was protected from its deathly magics via Miltiadess own, somewhat undead nature. The paladins were given time until the sunrise to find Eidola and leave.\nTracking the shapeshifter and surviving several encounters with undead guardians, Eidolas deceptions, paladins, and mercenaries discovered the gate she escaped through – into Undermountain. Miltiades and Belgin Dree followed. Jacob and Rings eventually reached the gate. Jacob revealed his doppelganger nature, replaced when the paladins traveled through Skullport, the \"human\" stabbed the pirate and left him to die in the desert.\nEventually, the paladins and mercenaries reached Skullport once again. They came across a familiar face, Aleena Paladinstar, who was investigating the shapeshifter plot against her father. She revealed that Blackstaff Khelben Arunsun‎ knew of Eidolas nature sometime after the doppelganger consumed the young woman and took her shape. To render her harmless, Aleena and Blackstaff created a powerful girdle of righteousness that clocked the greater doppelganger into Eidolas body and personality. Along with survivors, Aleena traveled to a seedy bar Broken Pike. Its proprietor was a known agent of the Unseen, and he was likely to know where to find the organizations safe house and Eidola herself. In the process, Aleena and Miltiades were able to cure Belgin Dree of the gravely accursed disease that was killing him like everyone in the Utter East – a curse of the bloodforges.\nLater, the group was ambushed by a gang of doppelgangers wearing familiar faces and led by Jacob. In a bloody scuffle, the shapeshifter almost got the upper hand but were saved by Nargin \"Rings\" Olnblades magic axe. The dwarf was left to die, but with a ring of regeneration pierced onto his face, he survived and came back for vengeance. With Jacobs death, his betrayal and replacement became known to all.\nAfter the heroes reached the safehouse of the Unseen, they fought through its doppelganger defenders and faced Eidola once again. They chased the monster into a maze of ancient tunnels underneath and cornered her. Eidola revealed the reason for Piergeiron Paladinsons condition after the brides abduction – a soul gem. She threatened to shatter it, destroying the Open Lords soul unless the warriors left and allowed her to escape. Miltiades refused, and the doppelganger started chanting the spell to trap the paladins soul in the gem however, Belgins throwing knife interfered. The spell failed, and Eidolas own soul was consumed by the magic gemstone.\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nSpells\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nMagic Items\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull \nVegetation\nFood & Drink\nMaterials\nDiseases & Afflictions\n &bull \nOther\n &bull  &bull  &bull"
