'''''The Ghost of Conyberry''''' was a book about the infamous [[banshee]] of the [[Conyberry]] area, [[Agatha]], popular ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
''The Ghost of Conyberry'' talked about the [[ghost]] of [[Neverwinter Wood]], who, in reality, was a banshee named Agatha. Her name was likely a corruption of the [[elven]] last name "Auglathla" which meant "Winterbreeze" in an old dialect. The book described [[Agatha's Grove]], her lair to be located in Neverwinter Wood, northwest of Conyberry, at the end of a path marked by a strand of [[birch]] trees.

The book next goes into describing Agatha's lair's past defenses, such as the ''[[magic mirror]]'' spell that was set up to pummel intruders with magic. The book mentions two adventurers who broke that defense, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Wulfgar]] son of [[Beornegar]] in [[1356 DR]]. Since then, Agatha expanded her treasure hoard by stealing precious items under the cover of night, ambushing and killing traveling merchants, and scavenging through ancient ruins. She remembered Drizzt and Wulfgar's theft and retaliated with death against anyone foolish enough to search for the banshee's treasure.

The book also talks about the most recent updates on the Ghost's of Conyberry activities ''circa'' [[1370 DR|1370's DR]]. By that time, Agatha expanded her lair's defenses. She used her magic to ''[[charm]]'' people of Conyberry into constructing pitfall traps all throughout the pathway to her grove and posting regular enthralled guards. Apart from these magical commands, she did not bother the people of Conyberry, seeing them as allies rather than enemies or slaves. In exchange for their unwilling labor, Agatha sent them the beasts of Neverwinter Wood in the times of tumult and bad winters and killed any [[orc]] bands off that threatened the village. The book stated that the villages of Conyberry treated Agatha with respect and called her a guardian and a friend.

==History==
Copies of ''the Ghost of Conyberry'' book could be found around the areas of [[Neverwinter]], [[Daggerford]], and the [[Sword Coast North]]  ''circa'' 1372 DR.
