        "mainbody": "Prophet of Moonshae, by Douglas Niles, is the first book in the Druidhome trilogy, which follows the events of the Moonshae trilogy.\nTwenty years after the Darkwalker War, Talos attempts to dominate the Moonshae Isles with his clerics working from the shadows, a servant called Coss-Axel-Sinioth, sahuagin, the treacherous Earl of Blackstone, and a dracolich he tricked into his service with a promise of eternal life. Talos attempts to ignite war between the Ffolk and Northmen, but the efforts are thwarted by Alicia Kendrick, who reawakens a Moonwell with the Staff of the White Well and the energy of an iron golem. Alicia, together with her tutor, a powerful wizard named Keane, the firbolg Yak, Hanrald Blackstone, the bard Tavish, the northman prince Brandon Olafsson, the faerie dragon Newt, and the druid Danrak, manages to stop Talos, defend the moonwell, and defeat all of his servants except the sahuagin. Deirdre Kendrick is manipulated by Sinioth and nearly turns on her family but refuses at the last moment. Robyn Kendrick falls sick but recovers, and an old prophet appears and disappears inexplicably at several points, prophesizing doom and the goddesses return, even though he is slain several times. After the battle is won, it is revealed that Tristan Kendricks ship has been lost at sea.\nAlicia Kendrick • Keane • Tavish • Deirdre Kendrick • Tristan Kendrick • Robyn Kendrick • Newt • Angus Blackstone • Currag Blackstone • Gwyeth Blackstone • Hanrald Blackstone • Gotha • Brandon Olafsson • Sythissal • Nuva • Svenyird Olafsson • Sigurd • The Prophet (Moonshaes) • Talos • Kaffa • Larth • Wultha • Malawar/Coss-Axell-Sinioth • Knaff • Danrak • Yak • Loinwrap • Meghan • Mikal • Petite Isolde • Kile • Beaknod • Dagus • Backar • Warlock (dog) • Pryat Wentfeld"
