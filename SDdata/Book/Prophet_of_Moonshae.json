Talos attempts to ignite war between the [[Ffolk]] and [[Northlander|Northmen]], but the efforts are thwarted by [[Alicia Kendrick]], who reawakens a [[Moonwell]] with the Staff of the White Well and the energy of an [[iron golem]]. Alicia, together with her tutor, a powerful [[wizard]] named [[Keane]], the [[firbolg]] [[Yak]], Hanrald Blackstone, the [[bard]] Tavish, the northman prince Brandon Olafsson, the [[faerie dragon]] [[Newt (faerie dragon)|Newt]], and the [[druid]] Danrak, manages to stop Talos, defend the moonwell, and defeat all of his servants except the sahuagin. [[Deirdre Kendrick]] is manipulated by Sinioth and nearly turns on her family but refuses at the last moment. [[Robyn Kendrick]] falls sick but recovers, and an old prophet appears and disappears inexplicably at several points, prophesizing doom and the goddesses return, even though he is slain several times. After the battle is won, it is revealed that [[Tristan Kendrick|Tristan Kendrick's]] ship has been lost at sea.",
