The '''''Saga of the Dragon Queller''''', or '''''Sal Hotun Wyrmrever''''' in its original [[Giant language|language]], was an ancient [[giant]] ballad about the hero [[Hjurnur Wyrmrever]].

==Description==
This epic poem was the second in a series of [[elf|eleven]] sagas about Hjurnur Wyrmrever and his descendants. It was composed by [[Hrotun]], the first [[skald]], and told the tale of his nephew, the hero Hjurnur, during the [[Thousand Year War|great war]] between the giants and the [[dragon]]s.

Like all classically written giant sagas, the poem's first stanza introduced the main character, provided a genealogy, and summarized the entire tale to follow.

Amongst other feats, the story told how Hjurnur snapped a [[dragon]]'s backbone over his knee, ended up allowing the [[Tiamat|Queen of Dragons]] to eat his child after losing a riddle contest, and killed a dragon king. At the end of the tale, Hjurnur ended up drowning in the dragon king's blood.There is an obvious error in the text of ''[[Giantcraft]]'' where this poem is described. After directly explaining that the poem is about Hjurnur and written by Hrotun, in some places, the author accidentally substitutes Hrotun for Hjurnur in the description of the lines. The poem itself is clear that it is Hjurnur, and not Hrotun, who performs the feats described. Moreover, Hrotun could not have written the poem if he is said to have died at the end of the story.

==Excerpt==
The following is a translation by [[Rundigast]] of [[Waterdeep]] of the first stanza of the poem:
:''I pour mead to the [[Annam All-Father|All-Father]] for''<br />
:''Hjurnur, son of [[Hjurgen]],''<br />
:''leveler of [[Ranauroch]],''<br />
:''son of [[Ottar]],''<br />
:''[[Jarl]] of the northern wind-teeth,''<br />
:''son of grand Annam,''<br />
:''All Seeing, All Knowing, All Quelling,''<br />
:''All Father &mdash;''<br />
:''Fireheart,''<br />
:''Mighty reaver of the [[dragon|wyrm]]'s core,''<br />
:''He who howled at the sun,''<br />
:''He of the quenched heart,''<br />
:''He who drowned in the river of swords,&hellip;''<br />

==History==
Over the centuries, the other ten sagas that this poem was part of a series for were lost to time, leaving it as the oldest surviving song about Hjurnur in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Reputation==
This saga was sung in mead halls within giant steadings all over [[Faerûn]], though it was primarily popular among [[frost giant]]s.
