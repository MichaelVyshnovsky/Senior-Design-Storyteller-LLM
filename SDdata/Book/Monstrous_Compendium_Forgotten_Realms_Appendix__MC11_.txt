{{Quote|''Here it is - the second Monstrous Compenium Appendix for the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign world!''

''In these pages you will meet the strikingly beautiful [[Ihiannan shee]], the fingernail-sized [[monkey spider]], and the nightmarish [[feyr]]. These and other brand-new, custom-made monsters (and a few updated favorites) lurk within this booklet, waiting for you to unleash them into your own campaign. As always, the pages are 5-hole punched for easy insertion into your own ring binder.''}}
