        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a copy of ''A Noble's Guide to Etiquette'' was stashed on a bookshelf in [[Castle Exeltis]]'s basement. The family's scion mismanaged the once-flourishing winery, and the bookshelves in the castle basement were covered in a thick layer of dust, evidence of literary neglect. The shelf, however, hid a secret passage from the basement to the castle's second floor and the lord's chambers."
