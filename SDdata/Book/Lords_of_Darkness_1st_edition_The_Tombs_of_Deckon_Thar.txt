The adventure is meant for characters of between third and fourth level and the total number of levels of members of the party should be between 36 and 48.<br/>At least one character should be a fourth-level, [[Good]] [[cleric]]''.<ref name=“LoD1e-tToDT-p21”>}}

==Summary==
The adventure begins with the sun setting as a group of [[adventurers]] stumble upon a natural entryway in the [[Nether Mountains]]' cliff face, one that leads into a hidden valley. Therein, they find two clearly-decrepit buildings which stand before seven large burial mounds. As the valley grows darker, they explore and begin to realize that the first, and smaller, of the ruined buildings was once a stable and the other a great hall. 

Night falls and the party makes camp in the valley, but, unbeknownst to them, they are being watched by the wight soldiers of [[Vinjarek]] the Mound King, who rules from a cave beneath the largest mound. Though scared off by light, the wights are instructed to steal the life force of the intruders, as they did when a caravan of merchants hid in the valley not long before. The adventurers, however, prove to be tougher prey. The wights escape into tunnels, excavated beneath the entirety of the valley, whose entrances they hide using large stones. Despite this, the tunnels cause patterns of grass and plants to grow less vibrantly than their neighbors, revealing the underground path. 

Inspecting the mounds themselves, there are clear signs of grave robbery, with little valuables left above ground beyond the rusted tools of the grave robbers themselves, but so too are there signs of a struggle, one that left no bodies behind. 

Eventually, whether by following the trail of the grave robbers or that of the ambushing wights, the adventurers snake down the narrow tunnels beneath the valley and into the tombs that rest below, where more wights hide along the walls to strike. At the tunnels' end, the party faces off against Vinjarek and his horde of wights, marking the adventure's conclusion upon slaying him and claiming the treasure he hides beyond his underground throne room.
