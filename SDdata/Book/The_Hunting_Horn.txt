'''''The Hunting Horn''''' was a periodical [[chapbook]] that dealt with topics of sexual nature, published in the cities of [[Athkatla]] and [[Crimmor]] in [[Amn]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/The Hunting Horn}}

==Contents==
''The Hunting Horn'' was a bi-monthly or, sometimes, quarterly chapbook, printed with the help of the [[Church of Sharess]]' [[coin]]. Each issue was printed in thousands and was sold to caravan merchants in Athkatla and Crimmor to be widely distributed along trade routes of [[Faer√ªn]]. Most were sold to festhalls, certain shopkeeps, and interested individuals.

Each issue usually contained art and short fiction of titillating nature. Most featured [[human]]s, [[elves]], and [[half-elves]] in various pleasurable yet scandalous groups and positions. On occasion, ''the Horn'' printed answers and advice in response to the readers' questions regarding techniques, [[oil]]s, aphrodisiacs, and intoxicating libations. The publication did not discriminate regarding sexual preference, [[gender and sex|gender]], [[gender and sex|sex]], and happily catered to those inspired by works featuring members of different species intermingling or those titillated by [[whip]]s and [[chain]]s, as well as many other similar topics.

Places of worship dedicated to [[Sune]] and [[Sharess]] often had copies of ''the Horn'', usually procured by the members of the clergy, or donated by the goddesses' devotees, however, both churches often printed and distributed their own publications of the same nature.
