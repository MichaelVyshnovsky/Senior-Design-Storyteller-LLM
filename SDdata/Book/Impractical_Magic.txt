'''''Impractical Magic''''' was a collection of several volumes dedicated to the phenomenon of [[wild magic]], penned by the [[wizard]] [[Bigby]] from the world of [[Oerth]] sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Where does wild magic come from? We know that sorcery and the like is genetic, that you’re born gifted with magic. Does that imply some dominant allele in the sorcerer has overcome the recessive element, the chaotic curl of organic evolution, the wild factor? Worries me awfully, because if it isn’t genetic, then what could it be? If magic is inherently insane, then that is a very big problem. That would imply wizards are wrangling something they could turn around and bite us, and that sorcerers are inherently at risk. Troubling, old boy. Troubling stuff.''|Bigby}}

==Contents==
===Volume I===
The ''Volume I'' included a conversation between Bigby and his accomplished comrade and [[sage]] [[Otiluke]]. The tome described the unpredictable effects of the wild magic that could turn the caster's underpants into [[butterflies]] and shoes into [[curry]]-flavored [[jelly]], when they attempted to cast the ''[[fly]]'' [[spell]], but despite such hilarious effects, Bigby thought the wild magic's origins were mysterious and harrowing. Bigby theorized that the wild magic might be coming from a [[sorcerer]]'s genes.

===Volume II===
The second volume covered the strange topic of the [[dead magic zone]]s. According to the author, the areas of dead magic first appeared during the [[Time of Troubles]], when the magic of [[Toril]] was fractured and reassembled. This calamity left scars where magic was scourged, completely cut off from [[Mystra]]'s [[Weave]]. Any creature within such an area lost all magical abilities and effects.

==History==
Copies of ''Impractical Magic'' could be found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, including within the thematic bedroom called "[[Elminster]]'s Library" in the [[Sharess' Caress]] brothel, and among many [[book]]s dedicated to [[the Art]] on the shelves of [[Sorcerous Sundries]] in the [[Lower City]].
