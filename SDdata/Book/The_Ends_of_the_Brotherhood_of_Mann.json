        "mainbody": "The Ends of the Brotherhood of Mann was a ballad dedicated to the betrayal and fall of the Brotherhood of Mann, a Ravenaar adventuring troupe, penned by Eric Luffson, son of Luff, a member of the adventuring company, in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe song retold the story of the Brotherhood of Mann, a band of adventurers that fell apart after one of the group betrayed them during an adventure, angering the goddess of magic, Mystra, and trapping the groups bard, Luff, in the deitys hidden temple, cursed for twenty-five years. Luffs son grew up and became a musician in his own right, who penned a ballad in hopes that, one day, it would attract the attention of a brave hero of Ravens Bluff, willing to risk their life and help the bard fix the wrongs of the past. Eventually, Luff got lucky, and a group of adventurers of Living City listened to the song and helped the bard in tracking down the surviving members of the Brotherhood of Mann and reassembled a holy symbol of Mystra to gain entrance to the hidden temple."
