        "Contents": "{{quote|In the days before for I stood and walked, a company tamed these lands,<br/>Six brothers who had different fathers, called the Brotherhood of Mann.<br/>They traveled far and won great fame in countries most men fear,<br/>But in the end, they all came home and met destruction here.<br/>In Ravens Bluff, city by the sea, where pirates roamed at leisure,<br/>They sought to rest their tired bones and spend their fame and treasure.<br/>But a Glyph was found, a sacred sign, by [[Mehail of the Sands]],<br/>And he took the mystery to his siblings in, the Brotherhood of Mann.<br/><br/>[[Leland]], [[wizard]], spoke the words, \"I know this ancient sign.<br/>It is the mark of [[magic]] old and pure and far greater than mine.\"<br/>In a coastal cave, he found the rock, and Mehail led them there.<br/>Under the sea to restore the stone, breathing water instead of air.<br/>And when the sigil was remade and blessed, dark Leland cast the spell,<br/>That pushed the waters and world away as starry blackness fell.<br/>Each brother lowered one knee in awe to bow before the shrine.<br/>Two gasped, three cried, and one plotted evil as they gazed at the divine.<br/><br/>The minion smiled, resting peacefully; she feared no beast or man,<br/>[[Quillion]] trembled in fear arcane, an [[axe]] held in each hand.<br/>He shook and cursed beneath his beard, an oath of blood and death<br/>And asked, \"Why have we ventured here to see this [[angel]] rest?\"<br/>Leland chuckled his reply and spoke in words arcane.<br/>Light and life flowed to the mage, the minion gasped in pain.<br/>She rose enraged and fought her foes with all she could command,<br/>As Leland drained her power away she struggled just to stand.<br/><br/>Mehail stood in shocked despair, his arms limp at his sides.<br/>[[Knile]] slipped silently into the dark and used shadows to hide.<br/>Quillion stepped forward, hate fueling his axes whirling death.<br/>[[Seejil]] healed the hurts done him by what power the minion had left.<br/>Leland continued to sap her spirit, and his flesh began to glow.<br/>Luff, the lost, unslung his [[harp]] and sang, his voice held low.<br/>Luff sang the dirge, ''[[Mystra's Lament]],'' and prayed she'd grant him [[charm]].<br/>But as he began the second verse, he could not move his arms.<br/><br/>The [[God]]dess' voice rang through the hall, righteous outrage plain.<br/>\"Who dares desecrate my sacred shrine and cause my servant pain?<br/>I curse you where you stand and speak. No more will power flow,<br/>From me and mine to you and yours, no magic will you know.\"<br/>Pain lanced through the flesh of every man; death's empty eyes grew near.<br/>Leland grimaced at the judgment's sound and showed he could know fear.<br/>One last act of evil to harm the bard and prove himself insane,<br/>Leland wished Luff's voice away and made his instrument remain.<br/><br/>When [[Mystra]] expelled them from the shrine, only five were there.<br/>They broke her symbol in equal parts, and each left with a share.<br/>Quickly back to Ravens Bluff to forget their place in crime.<br/>To cower in unending fear of the wrath of the divine.<br/>And still, today, they dwell among us seeming decent men.<br/>But the sign of sin hangs round their necks to be made whole again.<br/><br/>And lastly, my friends, lest we forget.<br/>Cursed was Luff, the light saver, and robbed of sight and sound.<br/>His sweet songs were never heard again, the instrument never found.|The full lyrics of ''The Ends of the Brotherhood of Mann''}}",
        "History": "The song retold the story of the Brotherhood of Mann, a band of adventurers that fell apart after one of the group betrayed them during an adventure, angering the goddess of magic, Mystra, and trapping the group's bard, Luff, in the deity's hidden temple, ''[[curse]]d'' for twenty-five years. Luff's son grew up and became a musician in his own right, who penned a ballad in hopes that, one day, it would attract the attention of a brave hero of [[Ravens Bluff]], willing to risk their life and help the bard fix the wrongs of the past. Eventually, Luff got lucky, and a group of adventurers of Living City listened to the song and helped the bard in tracking down the surviving members of the Brotherhood of Mann and reassembled a ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Mystra to gain entrance to the hidden temple.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Voice of a Lyre|11}}"
