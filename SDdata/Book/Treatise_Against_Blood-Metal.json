        "mainbody": "'''''Treatise Against Blood-Metal''''' was a book written by the sage [[Fairin Icemantle]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}\n\nIn this treatise, Fairin expressed his reservations about [[orcslayer]] blades, whose steel was poisonous to [[orc]]s. He feared that they would lead to the development of other alloys toxic to many races, and spread death and destruction.\n\nIt also discussed the [[dwarf|dwarven]] attack on the orc kingdom of [[Vastar]] in the [[610 DR|Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR]], in which the dwarves wielded the new orcslayer blades. This provided the only firsthand account of the conflict to later generations. Fairin described the dwarven slaughter of the orcs, saying that they had \"run in waist-high riot across the land\".\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the original manuscript was kept at [[Candlekeep]]. Copies of the ''Treatise Against Blood-Metal'' remained in libraries in [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and [[Waterdeep]] by [[1370 DR]], and possibly even within the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. Around 1372 DR, a copy could be found in the War Library of the [[Abbey of the Sword]], a temple to [[Tempus]] in [[Battledale]]."
