        "mainbody": "Viperhand is the second book of the Maztica trilogy by Douglas Niles.\nCharacters\nErix • Garney • Garrant • Grimes • Halloran • Kallicl • Kizzlok • Tokol\nPoshtli returns to Nexal with Halloran and Erixitl. Gultec is recruited by the people of Far Payit to train them in the ways of war. The Cult of the Viperhand begins recruiting by the thousands. Erix receives the Cloak of One Plume from Qotal, the second sign of his return. \nThe Golden Legion conquers Kultaka and marches on Nexal. Naltecona plans to ambush the Legion with a fake feast, but Darien discovers the plan and the Legion slaughters the Nexalans. The powers shown by Darien and Bishou Domincus convince Naltecona that the Golden Legion are gods, and he welcomes them into Nexal. Halloran saves Erix from the slaughter, and the two marry. \nThe worshippers of Zaltec grow angry at the Golden Legion, but Naltecona preserves peace by becoming a voluntary hostage. Halloran, Erix, and Poshtli break into the palace of Axal, desperate to stop a vision Erix had of Naltecona’s death, but they come too late to stop Darien from betraying the legion, revealing herself to be a drow, joining the Ancient Ones, and killing Naltecona in front of all of Nexal. \nThe Cult of the Viperhand swarms the golden legion, overwhelming them with numbers. Halloran, Erix, Poshtli, and Chitikas Coutl fight the Ancient Ones. Chitikas gives his life to kill the Ancestor, leader of the Ancient Ones. Hoxitl sacrifices Bishou Domincus to Zaltec, bringing together Helm and Zaltec just as Lolth strikes at her disloyal followers. \nAs the three gods clash, Mount Zatal explodes, destroying Nexal and the Highcave where Halloran and the others were fighting the Ancient Ones. Erix and Halloran are protected by the Cloak of One Plume. Poshtli survives in the shape of a bird. The surviving Ancient Ones teleport away, but are turned into driders by Lolth, who also curses the Cult of the Viperhand into the shape of orcs, the Jaguar and Eagle Knights into ogres, and the priests of Zaltec into trolls. Erix and Halloran find the lake is frozen solid, the third sign of Qotal’s return, but Erix curses a god who would return at a city’s destruction. Gultec finds Erix and Halloran and tells them they must lead the survivors to safety."
