        "mainbody": "'''''Hippogriff Riders of the Hand''''' was a tome that collected information on the [[elf|elven]] [[hippogriff]] cavalry of the [[Hand of the Seldarine]] before the stronghold's fall centuries before [[1281 DR]].",
        "Content": "The book collected the history and practices of the hippogriff riders who were primarily used as the citadel's scouts and sometimes as the aerial troops, thanks to their lightning-fast speed. The riders operated out of the Shevarash Tower of the Hand of the Seldarine.\n\nThe tome explained how the riders and their hippogriff steeds tirelessly trained together to develop precise teamwork. Hippogriffs were trained starting from the hatching. They were taught what to eat, how to perform aerial and land maneuvers, and how to respond to the verbal commands of their riders. Riders were trained in taking care of their charges, feeding, grooming, and how to handle the magical beasts in combat.\n\n''Hippogriff Riders of the Hand'' concluded that the hippogriff cavalry was invaluable for their aerial support and was a proud symbol of the [[Seldarine]].",
        "History": "''Hippogriff Riders of the Hand'' was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction ''circa'' [[900 DR]] and its fall in the [[Battle of Seldarine's Hand]]. By [[1281 DR]], the citadel was ruined and inhabited by [[ghost]]ly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the ''Hippogriff Riders'' copies could be found in the citadel's library along with other rare books."
