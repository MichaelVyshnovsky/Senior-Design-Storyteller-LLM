The '''''Imaskarran Tome of Resonance''''' was a heavy and tattered tome with a single rune on the cover, translating simply to "Resonance". The Imaskarran Tome of Resonance detailed the process of creating a ''[[wand of lightning bolts]]'' from the silk gland of an [[ettercap]] and a [[fenberry]], using the spell ''[[lightning bolt]]''.{{cite game/Neverwinter Nights}}

[[Eltoora Sarptyl]] sought, maybe with the help of the [[Hero of Neverwinter]], this tome around [[Port Llast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. Though allegedly of Imaskarran origin, they were readable to the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]. It was in the possession of the witch Setara, within the [[Neverwinter Wood]].
