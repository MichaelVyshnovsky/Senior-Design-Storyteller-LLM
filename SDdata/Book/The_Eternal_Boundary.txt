{{Quote|''Welcome to the Cage, friend. You'll want to watch your back in [[Sigil]]â€” it seems every cutter here's got a way to peel a clueless basher, and you're no exception. Besides, there's something happening down in the Hive that's got the factions in an uproar, and word is you're the cutter to look into it. Barmies and bubbers have been waking up in the Dead Book, but they haven't been staying there. They've been returning to Sigil with minds restored, telling tales of the Eternal Boundary. But the air's turning foul here in the Cage, and there'll be blood spilled soon if someone doesn't learn the dark of things, and quick!'}}

==Description==
''The Eternal Boundary'' is a Planescape adventure for a party of four to six characters of 1st to 5th levels. Players are introduced to the city of Sigil, and led down to the ramshackle slum known as the Hive as they uncover a sinister plot involving the return of madmen once-thought-dead and subterfuge in the city's factions. 

==Contents==
* Introduction
* Chapter 1: The Hive
* Chapter 2: The Mortuary
* Chapter 3: The Eternal Boundary

==Background==
A band of prime-material mercenaries in Plague-Mort, the Illuminated, seek power and influence. Their captain, a wizard known as Green Marvent, seeks to control the city of Sigil by secretly influencing its factions with undercover agents. 

After most of Marvent's initial plants (influenced by ''charm'' and ''domination'' spells) were discovered, he initiated a scheme to infiltrate the factions with plants who truly believed in the cause they were joining, but would still betray that cause when ordered. Marvent sent his most trusted agent, the Shadowknave, to cast ''feign death'' on madmen and drunkards in the Hive, and had his agent in the Dustmen ensure that the living deceased would be sent through portals to a hidden fortress on the Elemental Plane of Fire known as the Citadel of Fire. 

There, Marvent's men would dispel the feigned death, and cast spells to cure or suppress the victim's insanity. Upon becoming lucid again, the victim would be subjected to a charade of divine intervention in which the victim would be led to believe their deity had saved them from insanity and death; then, they would be charged with joining one of the city's factions and serving it loyally. Marvent could then send further orders from the false deities, instructing the victims to betray their factions at his behest whenever he desired.  

==Synopsis==
A group of adventurers were tasked with finding Eliath, a missing madman thought to know the key to a portal to the mythical Isle of Black Trees, which was said to hold great treasure. As they looked into the matter, they were informed that Eliath had died, been brought to the Mortuary, and cremated in the Elemental Plane of Fire. Later, they heard that Eliath was seen alive and sane in the company of members of the Doomguard at the Black Sail, a tavern in the Lower Ward.  

After finding Eliath alive and well, and pressing him for his tale when Doomguards weren't around, he reported that he had died in the Hive, passed beyond the "Eternal Boundary" of life and death, and met his childhood deity Lathander. He reported that Lathander had given him one more chance to redeem himself, and charged him with serving the Doomguard. When the PCs discovered another "resurrected" madman elsewhere, bearing a similar story with a different deity and faction, they realized there was a broader conspiracy at work. 

The adventurers discovered the plot, either by infiltrating and investigating the Mortuary to see what was becoming of the bodies of the madmen, or by being kidnapped by the Shadowknave, disarmed, and brought directly to the hidden fortress for questioning. Eventually, the adventurers defeated the forces of the Illuminated in the Citadel, rescued the victims still within, and destroyed the magical gem maintaining the Citadel's atmosphere against the pressures of the Plane of Fire, leading to the destruction of the entire Citadel and the end of Marvent's plan.

==Publication history==
''The Eternal Boundary'' was written by Richard Baker and was first published by TSR, Inc. in 1994. It is the first adventure for the ''Planescape'' setting.
