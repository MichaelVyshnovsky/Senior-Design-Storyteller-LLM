{{quote|''...And so at last we came to [[Turmish]], and the lamps were lit, twinkling through the [[tree]]s, and we were welcome, with warm hearth-couches waiting for us.''|Excerpt from ''A Merchant's Musings''}}

==Contents==
Like other tomes of musings, Holdryn's book was a connection of thoughts and recollections. One of the experiences he's recorded in ''A Merchant's Musings'' was his dealings and visits to the land of Turmish of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
The original was kept in the great fortress-library of [[Candlekeep]] around [[1372 DR]].

Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s searching through a library in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] found a copy of ''[[The Death of the Mind]]'' that was disguised with [[illusion]] [[magic]] to look like a copy of ''A Merchantâ€™s Musings''.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows in the Stacks|18}}
