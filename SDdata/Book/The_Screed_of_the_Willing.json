        "Content": "''The Screed of the Willing'' told of [[Loviatar]]'s call upon her faithful of the Realms. One could only truly live when they felt, and even reveled in severe pain, whether physical or emotional in origin. Loviatar loved those that truly embraced the pain and suffering they felt. According to the script, pain was the only means to get closer to divinity.",
