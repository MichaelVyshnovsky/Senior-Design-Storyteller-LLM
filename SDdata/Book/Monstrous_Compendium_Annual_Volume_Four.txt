The Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory
Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four serves as a supplement to the AD&D game, providing an extensive collection of monsters that were previously published in various 1996-1997 Advanced Dungeons & Dragons modules, as well as Dungeon and Dragon.
The structure of the Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four adheres to the format established by earlier Monstrous Compendium supplements. It features detailed entries for each monster, including physical descriptions, behaviors, combat tactics, and statistics necessary for gameplay. These entries are designed to be easily integrated into the existing binder system of the Monstrous Compendium series, allowing for a customizable and expansive monster reference library.
In addition to monster descriptions, the Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four provides lore and background information for each creature, offering insights into their habitats, societies, and roles within the AD&D world.
