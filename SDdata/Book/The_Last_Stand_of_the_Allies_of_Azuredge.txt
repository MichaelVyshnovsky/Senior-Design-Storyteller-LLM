'''''The Last Stand of the Allies of Azuredge''''' was a tragic ballad that retold the story of an adventuring quartet's demise during the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Contents==
The dirge's protagonists were four heroes who died in a stand against [[Myrkul's Legion]] during the Godswar. [[Beryghon]], the group's [[warrior]] carried the [[enchanted]] [[weapon]] called ''[[Azuredge]]'' that mysteriously disappeared during the event.

{{quote|And Azuredge didst see defeat 'gainst Myrkul's horde that day<br/>Despite her giv'n enforged task of creatures foul to slay.<br/>She moved herself through realms afar to ward off evil's touch,<br/>Arriving back in wizards' halls 'fore evil gained o'ermuch.<br/>Now heroes new may raise spirit and blades, and take this solemn pledge,<br/>Shouldst one be worthy of the cause, one shall wield Azuredge.|[[Arkiem Arren]]'s new stanza from ''The Last Stand of the Allies of Azuredge''}}

==History==
In the late [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, ''The Last Stand of the Allies of Azuredge'' was performed by Arkiem Arren in the [[Safehaven Inn]] of [[Waterdeep]]. As the [[bard]] approached the song's conclusion, a curious occurrence took place: the inn's doors swung open, and a cold wind filled the taproom. Somehow, the chill air mixed with the music, and a glowing axe appeared over Arkiem's head. The bard's eyes filled with a blue glow, and as if entranced, he produced a new stanza added to the dirge. When the ballad was over, the blue axe flew across the taproom and embedded itself in a support pillar.
