'''''Arauntril: Lady Death, Lady Flame''''' was an extraordinarily popular book of comedic adventure fiction in the [[Heartlands]] of the [[Realms]].

==Contents==
''Arauntril'' was the epic adventure story of Arauntril, a [[sorceress]] with a [[sword]] who possessed decidedly un-heroic qualities. Though bold, beautiful, and clever, she was also rather evil, sharp-tongued, selfish, and wanton in her ways, and met her challenges with swordplay, trickery, and seduction as she acrobatically tumbled between beds and fights as she sought her fortune. Unlike the scandalously pornographic ''[[Tal Tessoran]]'', the sex in ''Arauntril'' was treated as comedic or perfunctorily matter-of-fact, not getting in the way of the story's true passion: righteously skewering ridiculous caricatures that all audiences could relate to. Arauntril used her cunning to run circles about these contemptible victims and get what she wanted, and did not hesitate to turn her vicious wit on herself when she made mistakes and errors of judgment.

==History==
The book was written by the clerk [[Sarkoarvhan Dhurr]] of [[Tethyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], inspired by his frustrations with the unbearably pompous and unpleasant people that he had to deal with. It reached tremendous popularity in the Realms, beloved for its witty prose and sharp parody of human nature that brought fresh laughter even from those who knew its pages well. Shortly after, an anonymous author wrote their own sequel of sorts, ''[[Arauntril Scourged]]''. Though initially upset, Dhurr found it delightful once he got the chance to read it.
