        "''Bloody war rages across the Forgotten Realms world in the third book of the Companions Codex, the latest series in R.A. Salvatore's New York Times best-selling saga of [[drow|dark elf]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].''\n\n''In the evolving world of the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting, the [[Second Sundering|Sundering]] has given way to months of cloud-cloaked [[Darkening|darkness]], and war rages under that oppressive sky. The [[orc]]s have broken a hard-fought [[Treaty of Garumn's Gorge|treaty]] that's held, however tentatively, for a hundred years, and the time to settle old scores has devolved into an all-out brawl for control of the ancient realms of [[Northwest Faerûn|the North]].''\n| [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/vengeance-of-the-iron-dwarf-r-a-salvatore/1119987334 BarnesandNoble.com]\n}}": "=Summary==",
        "mainbody": "e story of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] continues with the three [[dwarf|dwarven]] strongholds—[[Mithral Hall]], [[Citadel Felbarr]], and [[Citadel Adbar]]—under siege and the cities of [[Nesmé]] and [[Sundabar]] (renamed \"Hartusk Keep\") already captured by the forces of the [[Many-Arrows]], aided by [[frost giants]] and a number of [[drow]] from [[Menzoberranzan]] and [[Q'Xorlarrin]].\n\nKing [[Connerad Brawnanvil]] of Mithral Hall, along with Drizzt Do'Urden, [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], [[Catti-brie]], and [[Athrogate]] have arrived at Citadel Felbarr to discuss the dwarven kingdoms' next steps. Bruenor, known to the other dwarves as [[Reginald Roundshield]], reveals himself to be the once-king of Mithral Hall reborn. The dwarves and their guests celebrate Bruenor's return before the remaining [[Companions of the Hall]] and [[Athrogate]] return to Mithral Hall.\n\nIn the [[Underdark]], [[Regis]] and [[Wulfgar]], who were separated from their friends at the underground gates of Mithral Hall, are surviving but unable to return to their friends due to the hordes of orcs every which way. They decide to travel east towards Citadel Felbarr, but they must guess which direction east is.\n\nIn Nesmé, the drow [[Tiago Baenre|Tiago]] grows bored with orders from Menzoberranzan to sit quietly in the lands conquered by Many-Arrows. As winter sets in, he takes the [[white dragon|white wyrm]] [[Arauthator]] to seal off the chimneys of Mithral Hall. The orcs take his measures a step further by causing avalanches to seal the fortress tight under [[Fourthpeak]]. The dwarves sneak out of the mountain, hoping to ambush the besieging orcs, but Drizzt discovers that it is a trap and they all return to their tunnels. Arauthator and his son [[Aurbangras]] return to the [[Spine of the World]] for the winter.\n\nDuring the winter, the dwarven kingdomes continually try to break out of the grip of Many-Arrows, but fail each time. The [[elf|elves]] of the [[Glimmerwood]], led by [[Sinnafain|Sinnafein]], see how desperate the dwarves are becoming and plan to aid them. Catti-brie, using her magic to find out how the other kingdoms are doing, learns of the great hunger and suffering of Citadel Adbar and convinces her companions that they must find a way to break the siege.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\nBack in the Underdark, Regis travels down an underground river in search of help for Wulfgar, who has been badly wounded. Regis finds Knight-Commander [[Aleina Brightlance]] of the [[Knights in Silver]] and refugees from [[Sundabar]]. The two companions join the group and journey to the Underdark around [[Silverymoon]], where they chase away the drow and orc forces. They enter the city and solicit aid from [[Taern Hornblade]], the High Mage of Silverymoon.\n\nMeanwhile, the Glimmerwood elves are approached by [[Ambergris]] and [[Afafrenfere]], who come bearing aid from a mysterious benefactor ([[Jarlaxle]]). They are joined by a strange elf named \"Mickey\" ([[Tazmikella]]), who informs them of a plan to free the [[Silver Marches]] from the orc oppressors. Mickey takes Sinnafein to Mithral Hall unnoticed, where they include the remaining Companions of the Hall in their plans. A small group of elite warriors with Bruenor Battlehammer escape Mithral Hall and journey onward to free Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr. Bruenor unites the dwarven forces to retake the [[River Surbrin]] bridge from the forces of Many-Arrows. In the sky above the battle, Drizzt and Afafrenfere on the [[copper dragon]]s [[Ilnezhara]] and [[Tazmikella]] confront Tiago and [[Tos'un Armgo]] on the white dragons [[Arauthator]] and [[Aurbangras]], leaving Tos'un and Aurbangras dead and Arauthator in retreat. Bruenor then uses the \"[[Ritual of the March]]\" to conquer [[Dark Arrow Keep]], restoring it to [[Lorgru]], its proper ruler, and defeating Hartusk's remaining armies.\n\nThe last thing to remain is the [[Darkening]], the pervasive dark clouds blocking the sun. Drizzt feels as if the might of [[Mielikki]] has come upon him and he is able to disperse the darkness. However, unbeknownst to him, it is in fact [[Gromph Baenre]] (at Jarlaxle's insistence) using Drizzt as a vessel for his powerful magic.
