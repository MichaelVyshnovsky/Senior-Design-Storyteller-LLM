It soothes our senses and softens our fall. To touch it is to know Him.<br/>The fire is His, and the flames are Him. To fear them is to know His might. To stoke them is to shun His words.<br/>Silvanus, grant us pease. Silvanus, grant us might. Silvanus, quell our malice.''|Excerpt from the ''Psalms to the Old Oak''}}",
