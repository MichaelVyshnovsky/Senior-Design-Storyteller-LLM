"Grimjaws" is a short adventure for Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition published in Dungeon #62. Set in the Vast Swamp, the adventure heavily references the book Elminsters Ecologies The Cormyrean Marshes.
In the mid-14 century DR, a shaman-in-training lizardman from the Tun Marshes by the name of Sutholo moves to the Vast Swamp to study the local floral and fauna. One day he kills a large crocodile near his hut along the Darkflow River and tries to preserve its body by using herbs, wrapping tightly around it in cloth. At night a storm blows the carcass into the Darkflow proper, where evil magic within its waters cause the crocodile to arise from the dead as a mummy. The crocodile goes on to infect creatures in the surrounding area, including Sutholo, with mummy rot and eventually becomes known as Grimjaws.
Later a group of adventurers are drawn towards the area due to tavern gossip about a small cache of tools, etched in Espruar runes, that were retrieved from the swamp. Before long the adventurers encounter Sutholos hut, where they possibly attempt to heal the lizardman of his mummy rot and try to slay the terrible mummy Grimjaws.
