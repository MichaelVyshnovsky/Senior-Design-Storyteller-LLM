        "Summary": "In this novel, the [[wizard]] [[Aballister Bonaduce]] creates the [[Chaos Curse]], a horrible [[potion]] that makes people need to fulfill their deepest most personal desire without regard to the consequence. A priest of [[Talona]], [[Barjin]], takes the potion from Aballister and brings it to the [[Edificant Library]], an enemy of [[Castle Trinity]], where Aballister and Barjin work. Barjin makes his way to the library, sneaks into the cellar of the building, and is able to release the ever-smoking potion into the library with the unknowing help of the priest Cadderly. The library deteriorates into pandemonium, but Cadderly, his good friend Danica, the two dwarven brothers Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder, as well as a [[druid]] named [[Newander]] travel down to the altar of Barjin and kill him, saving, for the time, the library.\n{{sectstub}}",
