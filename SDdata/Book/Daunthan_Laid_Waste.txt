{{quote|As rebels and traitors have learned before, once laws are dashed down and folk know fear, as you've flung aside graces and let [[Mask (object)|mask]]s slip, then all beasts are loosed and any man may go down; there's blood on the whirlwind, and no safety to be found. Be proud of your achievement, butchers. Be proud.|Grauth the Old Warrior, in Act III, Scene I}}
