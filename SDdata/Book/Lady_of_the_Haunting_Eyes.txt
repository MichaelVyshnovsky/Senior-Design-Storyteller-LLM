'''''Lady of the Haunting Eyes''''' was a ballad dedicated to the famed courtesan named [[Joysarra]] of [[Zazesspur]], penned by [[Ronsil Haeladtongue]], a [[minstrel]] from the same city, some time in or before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
''Lady of the Haunting Eyes'' was titled after Joysarra's nickname. As the case was with many courtesans, those whose fame grew to inspire ballads were already gone by the time the fame put their names on the lips of [[bard]]s and minstrels. The titular Lady of the Haunting Eyes was dead by the late 14{{th}} century DR.
