A Pleasurable Deal was a particularly lewd play that was banned in a number of cities across the Realms, directed by the first-time author and director named Kingsley Harp.
A Pleasurable Deal told the story of Robert, a tiefling man whose wife had left him for another lover. He was approached by a cambion named Carlisle, who astutely observed Roberts greatest insecurity and woe his insignificant member that was insufficient to impregnate his wife. In the plays finale, Robert died in a horrible way after breaking the deal with Carlisle.
A Pleasurable Deals inspiration came from the director â€“ Mr. Kingsley Harps desire to explore taboos and human nature, according to a published interview. Despite the interviewers statement that most people would never make a deal with a champion, Kingsley interrupted, saying that everyone wants something and cambions knew mortals better than they knew themselves. The interview was cut short after Kingsley Harp was asked if he had made a deal himself after countless publications refused print by the tabloid called Baldurs Bash.
As of the , copy of A Pleasurable Deal could be found in a tollhouse along the Risen Road.
