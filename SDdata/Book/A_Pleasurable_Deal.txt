'''''A Pleasurable Deal''''' was a particularly lewd play that was banned in a number of cities across the Realms, directed by the first-time author and director named [[Kingsley Harp]].

{{Quote|Come hear fair folk a tale now lost to time.<br />
In grief, this man well-sunk to depths sublime<br />
A gift he sought to win his lady's heart.<br />
Our cambion smiled, for now the game did start.<br />
|''Excerpt from A Pleasurable Deal.''}}

==Description==
''A Pleasurable Deal'' told the story of Robert, a [[tiefling]] man whose wife had left him for another lover. He was approached by a [[cambion]] named Carlisle, who astutely observed Robert's greatest insecurity and woe: his insignificant member that was insufficient to impregnate his wife. In the play's finale, Robert died in a horrible way after breaking the deal with Carlisle.

''A Pleasurable Deal's'' inspiration came from the director – Mr. Kingsley Harp's desire to explore taboos and human nature, according to a published interview. Despite the interviewer's statement that most people would never make a deal with a champion, Kingsley interrupted, saying that everyone wants something and cambions knew mortals better than they knew themselves. The interview was cut short after Kingsley Harp was asked if he had made a deal himself after countless publications refused print by the tabloid called ''[[Baldur's Bash]]''.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, copy of ''A Pleasurable Deal'' could be found in a tollhouse along the [[Risen Road]].
