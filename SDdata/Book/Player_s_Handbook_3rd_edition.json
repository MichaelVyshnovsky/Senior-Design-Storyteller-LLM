        "Description": "This was the original Player's Handbook for the 3rd edition. It was replaced in 2003 by the [[Player's Handbook 3.5|''Player's Handbook'' v.3.5]], when the rules were advanced from 3rd edition to 3.5 edition. \n\nIt represented a major overhaul of the game, including the adoption of the d20 system. The third edition also dropped the word Advanced from the title, as the publisher decided to publish only one version of the game instead of both basic and advanced versions. It also brought the return of [[half-orc]]s and [[monk]]s to the core rules set.\n\nSome of the key revisions and evolutions introduced by the ''Player's Handbook 3e'' include:\n\n* Streamlined Rules: The 3{{rd}} edition streamlined and consolidated many of the game's rules, making them more coherent and accessible. This allowed for smoother gameplay and reduced the complexity that could sometimes deter new players.\n* Unified Resolution System: The introduction of the d20 System was a cornerstone of the 3{{rd}} edition. Nearly all actions in the game are resolved through the roll of a 20-sided die (d20), with modifiers based on character attributes, skills, and other factors. This unified resolution system made the game more consistent and easier to understand.\n* Character Customization with Feats: Feats were introduced to allow players to customize their characters further. Feats provided specific abilities or advantages that characters could select as they advanced in levels. This system encouraged diverse character builds and specialization.\n* Skill System Overhaul: The 3{{rd}} edition revamped the skill system, providing a structured list of skills that characters could invest points in as they leveled up. Skills covered a wide range of activities and provided a framework for resolving non-combat challenges.\n* Vancian Spellcasting Reimagined: The traditional \"Vancian\" spellcasting system, where wizards memorized and prepared spells in specific slots, was updated to provide greater flexibility. Spellcasters now had a set number of spells they could cast per day, and they could choose from their entire repertoire of spells when casting.\n* Balanced Classes: The classes in 3{{rd}} edition were designed with a focus on balance, ensuring that each class had a distinct role to play in the party and contributed meaningfully to different aspects of the game, whether combat, magic, or skills.\n* Easier Multiclassing: The new multiclassing system allowed characters to combine levels from different classes more smoothly, enabling a wider range of character concepts and combinations.\n* Alignment and Role-Playing: While alignment remained a core concept, its influence on gameplay was reduced. The focus shifted to providing players with guidelines for role-playing their characters' personalities, beliefs, and motivations.\n* Open Game License (OGL): The 3{{rd}} edition embraced an open gaming philosophy, introducing the Open Game License. This allowed third-party publishers to create content for {{dnd}} using the d20 System, leading to a proliferation of supplements, settings, and adventures.\n* Modularity and Expansion: The modular design of the 3{{rd}} edition allowed for the addition of various supplements and sourcebooks that expanded on different aspects of the game, from new character classes and spells to campaign settings.",
