A Deep and Creeping Darkness was an account of the final days of the mining village Vermeillon, as recorded by an unknown bard.
The book was bound in unadorned black leather, with the name of the work embossed in golden letters on its spine. A Deep and Creeping Darkness was clearly not the work of a professional scribe&mdashalthough it was mostly neat, the book contained several spelling errors and ink blotches from shoddy penmanship. Apart from a handful of creased pages, the book showed very little sign of wear and tear.
A Deep and Creeping Darkness was a series of vignettes collected from the surviving residents of Vermeillon, an abandoned mining village. Although Vermeillon was a real place, the authoring bards overly dramatic writing style made it unclear whether the story told was folklore or actual history.

As if that were not tragedy enough, the village soon became plagued by a rash of unexplained disappearances. Before long, the remaining villagers abandoned Vermeillon altogether. The author also included his own personal musings into the book, particularly on the subject of whether or not it would be worth hiring a party of adventurers to secure the village so its valuable vein of platinum could be mined once more.
