Anauroch is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
Anauroch provides a detailed description of the region of Anauroch.
Anauroch is divided into several chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the region, including its geography, history, and inhabitants. It includes detailed descriptions of the cities, towns, and other locations within the desert, as well as information about the various factions and organizations that operate in the area.
One of the key features of Anauroch is its focus on the mythology and culture of the Bedine, a nomadic people who inhabit the region. The book includes detailed information about their customs, beliefs, and way of life, as well as their relationships with the other races and factions in the region.
In addition to its descriptions of the region and its inhabitants, Anauroch also includes new rules and mechanics for players and dungeon masters, such as new spells, magic items, and monsters.
The 96-page booklet is wrapped in a removable cover. It also includes a fold-out color poster map of the region. The inside covers describe Bedine languages and names, as well as dangers of the desert. It has been praised for its detailed and immersive descriptions of the desert environment and its cultural and mythological elements.
