In this ragtag band of adventurers, each member plays a vital role: [[Tessalynde Halendria|Tess]], the disciplined [[elf|elven]] [[thief]]; [[Anson Iro|Anson]], the courageous [[fighter]]; [[Lark Silverstring|Lark]], the cunning [[bard]]; [[Baldric Goodhand|Baldric]], the wily [[cleric]]; [[Cazrin Varaith|Cazrin]], the inquisitive [[wizard]]; and [[Uggie]], their pet monster who eats garbage. Squint a little, and they're the heroes Faerûn needs.''<br/><br/>''Fresh off a harrowing journey into the infinite dungeon of [[Undermountain]] and the defeat of a powerful [[undead]] [[lich]] (with the help of a giant hungry worm or two), the adventurers are now a proven and dedicated team, ready for a new adventure which will take them to strange new realms.''}}",
