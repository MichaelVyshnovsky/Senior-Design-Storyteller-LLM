'''''Hawkblade's Evenhorn''''' was a periodical [[chapbook]] published by [[Hawkblade]] in the city of [[Everlund]] of the [[Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Hawkblade's Evenhorn'' was a lighthearted and editorially liberal publication filled with local news, humorous and biting commentaries on the local persons of importance, and recent events. The chapbook published opinion pieces and reviews on occasion, as well as saucy gossip from the neighboring city of [[Silverymoon]]. The owner and contributor of the ''Evenhorn'', Hawkblade, was a once-lover of [[Alustriel Silverhand]], the leader of Silverymoon, and he never missed an opportunity to write about her beauty, latest grand outfits, accomplishments, as well as rumors of her current love affairs (many of which could not be corroborated).
