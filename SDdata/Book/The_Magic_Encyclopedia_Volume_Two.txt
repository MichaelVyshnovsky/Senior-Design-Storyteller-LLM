'''The Magic Encyclopedia volume Two''' is the second of a pair of 2nd edition books containing a vast collection of mundane items, their [[magic]]al equivalents, and some unique [[magic item]]s from G-Z sourced from other AD&D products. It was published in 1993.

==Synopsis==
{{quote|''Did you ever wonder what a phylactery is? Do you know what the difference between a [[cloak]] and a [[robe]] is? The Magic Encyclopedia answers these questions with succinct definitions of every type of item found in a magical treasure hoard, and every definition has an illustration.''

''The list of definitions in Volume Two runs from Goggle to Zwieback, and completes the list begun in [[The Magic Encyclopedia Volume One|Volume One]]. The listing includes an experience point value and a [[gold piece]] sale value for each item. At last, you'll know exactly what every bauble in any hoard is really worth. The listing also identifies the product where the item is described and the page number where you can find it. A complete list of those products (current through December, 1991) is also provided.''}}
