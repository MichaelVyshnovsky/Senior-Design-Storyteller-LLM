'''''Findings from the Hinterlands''''' was a quarterly publication that covered news and goings-on about the [[Sword Coast]] and an area of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
[[Mingus Etcherly]] served as editor-in-chief of the journal. Mingus had reporters from [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Candlekeep]] to as far east as [[Elturgard]] and [[Scornubel]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a hastily-made issue of ''Findings'' was published to inform people of the eminent threat of the [[cult of the Absolute]]. It included reports of the cult's activities from [[Elturgard]], about an emergent alliance between [[goblin]]s, [[Lolthite]] [[drow]], [[troll]]s, and [[duergar]].
