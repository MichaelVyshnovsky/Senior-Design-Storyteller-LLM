Patriars, A Homegrown Aristocracy was a book dedicated to the patriar families of Baldurs Gate, penned sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
Patriars, A Homegrown Aristocracy was a journalistic work by some brave or possibly suicidal writer who shared no love for the patriar families. The book offered savage takedowns and criticisms aimed at every patriar family of the Upper City, including House Caldwell, that was accused of hoarding patronage of Baldurian museums and galleries, House Irlentree with their impressive fleets of merchant vessels, and House Ravenshade, who usurped the ink, dye, jewelry, and gem industries in the city. Patriars, A Homegrown Aristocracy was filled with acidic insults and disdain for each of the noble houses, celebrating each familys bad luck and financial failures over the years.
By the , several copies of Patriars, A Homegrown Aristocracy were in rotation in the city of Baldurs Gate. One could be found in the printing cellar of Baldurs Mouth and another was sold by Nansi Gretta in The Bibliophile book shop in the Lower City.
