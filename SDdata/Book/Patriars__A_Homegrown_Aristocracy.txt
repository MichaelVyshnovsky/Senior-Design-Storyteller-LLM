==Contents==
''Patriars, A Homegrown Aristocracy'' was a journalistic work by some brave or possibly suicidal writer who shared no love for the patriar families. The book offered savage takedowns and criticisms aimed at every patriar family of the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]], including House [[Caldwell]], that was accused of hoarding patronage of Baldurian museums and galleries, House [[Irlentree]] with their impressive fleets of merchant vessels, and House [[Ravenshade]], who usurped the [[ink]], [[dye]], [[jewelry]], and [[gem]] industries in the city. ''Patriars, A Homegrown Aristocracy'' was filled with acidic insults and disdain for each of the noble houses, celebrating each family's bad luck and financial failures over the years.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, several copies of ''Patriars, A Homegrown Aristocracy'' were in rotation in the city of Baldur's Gate. One could be found in the printing cellar of [[Baldur's Mouth]] and another was sold by [[Nansi Gretta]] in [[The Bibliophile]] book shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]].
