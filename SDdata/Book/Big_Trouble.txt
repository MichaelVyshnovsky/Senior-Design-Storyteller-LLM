'''''Big Trouble''''' is a gamebook in the ''[[Endless Quest]]'' series. Slated for release in September 2018, it is set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' and focuses on the [[wizard]] class.

{{Quote|Welcome to the Forgotten Realms Endless Quest books, where you don't just read a fantastic tale. You ''become'' the hero — and choose your own fate.

When evil giants attack your home in Ardeep Forest, your parents think you're dead and they go hunting for your missing little brother. You wake up and set out after them, helped by a giant wizard who lives in a flying tower. You don't know where they've gone, but you know that if you don't find them, you’re all in big trouble. Wield your magic wisely against the giants, wizard.}}
