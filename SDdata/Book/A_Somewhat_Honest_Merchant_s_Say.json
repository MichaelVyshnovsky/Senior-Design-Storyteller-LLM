        "mainbody": "'''''A Somewhat Honest Merchant's Say''''' was [[book]] penned by [[Hammeth Ilcarth]] of [[Telflamm]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Look to your [[priest]]s and prayers and altars, for salvation comes from the [[god]]s. All aid, all beauty, all fortune and reward and plenty. It almost makes up for the beasts and bloodshed and heart-ravages they also send.<br/>When red war sweeps the land and [[sword]]s rise, is it not curious that every third warrior calls on this god or that, and swears divine favor is with him?<br/>Yet the blood runs, and whenever one war falters, another bursts forth. Truly, the gods must starve for entertainment.''|Excerpt from ''A Somewhat Honest Merchant's Say''}}",
