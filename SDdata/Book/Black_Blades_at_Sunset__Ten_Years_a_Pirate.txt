{{quote|''I'd rather brave the fiercest storms, shipwreck, fire, treachery, and [[sea serpent|serpents of the sea]] than be a fancy-booted ruler ashore, lording it over a city of [[viper]]s, foulstinking and false.''|An excerpt from ''Black Blades at Sunset''}}

''Black Blades at Sunset'' was a memoir and a collection of musings of a pirate, reaping ten years of her life as a buccaneer. Vardrella proclaimed in the book her preference for the dangers of the sea than being a lying ruler or a politician in a big city, surrounded by betrayal and falsehoods.
