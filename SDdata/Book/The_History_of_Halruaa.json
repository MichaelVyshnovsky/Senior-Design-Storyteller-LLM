        "mainbody": "'''''The History of Halruaa''''' was a history [[book]] that chronicled the history of [[Halruaa]], published sometime before [[1368 DR]].",
        "Contents": "''The History of Halruaa'' opened with the settlement of the kingdom by [[wizard]]s, fleeing the dreaded [[phaerimm]] from the land that later became the [[Anauroch]] desert. The refugees flew their [[Netherese]] ''[[Halruaan skyship|skyships]]'' and claimed the lush land inhabited by simple folk - shepherd of beasts such as wild [[roth√©]] and [[aurochs]]. The wizards decided to use the land to fend off phaerimm that sure to have been pursuing them. The aberrations never arrived and the Halruaa remained a well-defended kingdom.\n\nThe next chapter of Halruaan history was punctuated by [[Dambrath]]an raids on the kingdom's ports and border regions. One infamous raid was led by a [[barbarian]] warlord who was resistant to arcane magics in [[585 DR]]. Under his leadership, Dambarii claimed lands to the south of [[Lake Halruaa]]. Eventually, the Dambarii occupation was broken by the [[archmage]] [[Mycontil]]. The resulting battle was between 40,000 Dambarii and 500 Halruaans. The kingdom emerged victorious at the cost of over two hundred dead should, including Mycontil.\n\nThe book then moved on to talking about the latest attack on Halruaa at the time of the tome being penned. In [[1260 DR]], the ambitious ruler of [[Lapaliiya]] moved on the kingdom through the [[Telath Pass]]. Lapaliiyan king allied himself with the men of the wastes in order to helm the attack. However, Halruaan armies included wizards, warriors, and ''skyships'', and defeated invaders with ease.\n\nThe following chapter covered the Halruaan civil war ''circa'' [[860 DR]]. The conflict arose from a group of mages who strived to perform arcane experiments too extreme even for the Netherese. The renegades were forced out of the kingdom and eventually, settled in [[Thay]], if Halruaan accounts were to be believed.\n\nThrough the Halruaan history, the country rarely entered the official state of war but still often had to defend itself from invaders who lusted for the kingdom's magical treasures. Apart from the Dambarii, and the bandits of the wastes, Halruaa was targeted by the peoples of [[Mhair Jungles]].\n\n''The History of Halruaa'' concluded with the analysis of the country's history and regular invasion attempts that led to the 14{{th}} century Halruaa - defensive, warlike, and traditionalist kingdom. The people of the kingdom often said that wizards have always led them and always will.",
        "History": "By 1368 DR, copies of ''the History of Halruaa'' could be commonly found throughout the [[Sword Coast]], the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], and the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]]. One such copy belonged to [[Phlydia]], an older absent-minded inhabitant of Candlekeep."
