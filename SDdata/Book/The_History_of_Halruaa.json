        "mainbody": "The History of Halruaa was a history book that chronicled the history of Halruaa, published sometime before 1368 DR.\nThe History of Halruaa opened with the settlement of the kingdom by wizards, fleeing the dreaded phaerimm from the land that later became the Anauroch desert. The refugees flew their Netherese skyships and claimed the lush land inhabited by simple folk - shepherd of beasts such as wild roth√© and aurochs. The wizards decided to use the land to fend off phaerimm that sure to have been pursuing them. The aberrations never arrived and the Halruaa remained a well-defended kingdom.\nThe next chapter of Halruaan history was punctuated by Dambrathan raids on the kingdoms ports and border regions. One infamous raid was led by a barbarian warlord who was resistant to arcane magics in 585 DR. Under his leadership, Dambarii claimed lands to the south of Lake Halruaa. Eventually, the Dambarii occupation was broken by the archmage Mycontil. The resulting battle was between 40,000 Dambarii and 500 Halruaans. The kingdom emerged victorious at the cost of over two hundred dead should, including Mycontil.\nThe book then moved on to talking about the latest attack on Halruaa at the time of the tome being penned. In 1260 DR, the ambitious ruler of Lapaliiya moved on the kingdom through the Telath Pass. Lapaliiyan king allied himself with the men of the wastes in order to helm the attack. However, Halruaan armies included wizards, warriors, and skyships, and defeated invaders with ease.\nThe following chapter covered the Halruaan civil war circa 860 DR. The conflict arose from a group of mages who strived to perform arcane experiments too extreme even for the Netherese. The renegades were forced out of the kingdom and eventually, settled in Thay, if Halruaan accounts were to be believed.\nThrough the Halruaan history, the country rarely entered the official state of war but still often had to defend itself from invaders who lusted for the kingdoms magical treasures. Apart from the Dambarii, and the bandits of the wastes, Halruaa was targeted by the peoples of Mhair Jungles.\nThe History of Halruaa concluded with the analysis of the countrys history and regular invasion attempts that led to the 14 century Halruaa - defensive, warlike, and traditionalist kingdom. The people of the kingdom often said that wizards have always led them and always will.\nBy 1368 DR, copies of the History of Halruaa could be commonly found throughout the Sword Coast, the city of Baldurs Gate, and the fortress library of Candlekeep. One such copy belonged to Phlydia, an older absent-minded inhabitant of Candlekeep."
