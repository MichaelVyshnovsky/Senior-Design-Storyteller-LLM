The Butlers Cane Has a Knob on the End was a farcical comedy novel, penned sometime before the late 15 century DR.
The novels protagonist was the butler Vincent Raspington a stiff-mannered and silly dragonborn man, who often was flummoxed over the romantic behaviors of noble ladies and their suitors. The dragonborn found himself in a comedy of errors with the nobles going "arse-over-teakettle" into lewd situations. One such erotic misadventure forced the massive dragonborn butler to pretend he was a timid gnome maid named Missy Wimplesnatch during a nobles feast.
In the , a copy of The Butlers Cane Has a Knob on the End could be found in the Lady Jannaths manse in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate.
