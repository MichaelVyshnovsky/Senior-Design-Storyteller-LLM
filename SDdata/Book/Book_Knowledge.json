Bizarrely, it seems as though everyone who has come into contact with the book has vanished. The adventurers and the sage have all disappeared and the Sage's wife wants him back.\n\n{{quote|In Abeir-Toril knowledge is a resource precious and all too scarce. So when a tome surfaced that spoke of the origins of the Green Regent, many people took interest, and the Jade Blade were drawn into a plot that led to a showdown with a most unusual bookworm.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}"
