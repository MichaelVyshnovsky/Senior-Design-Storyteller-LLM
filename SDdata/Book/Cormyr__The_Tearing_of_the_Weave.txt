Cormyr The Tearing of the Weave was designed by Richard Baker, David Noonan, Bruce R. Cordell, James Wyatt, and Matthew Sernett, and designed for four 4th-level PCs who are expected to reach 7th or 8th level by the conclusion. Based in Wheloon in Cormyr, the Vast Swamp, and the Plane of Shadow in 1374 DR, it sees players investigate a false temple of Mystra, battle through lizardfolk, and uncover a plot by followers of Shar and Cyric to tear a hole in the Weave to create a vast dead-magic zone.
A new temple to Mystra has been built in the town of Wheloon. A traveling cleric of the Lady of Mysteries is overjoyed that his faith finally has a temple in Cormyr but when he goes to visit it he barely escapes with his life. He hires the players to investigate. Once inside, they discover that the priesthood is dominating magically adept supplicants and sending them into the Vast Swamp. Following the trail, they meet some lizardfolk who reveal that some of their brethren are being turned into undead and the dominated people go into a castle but never come out again. The undead guard the castle and the party has to fight their way through them to reach a portal to the Plane of Shadow. On the Shadow Plane, they find a monastery and discover a plot by Sharran and Cyricist priests to create a huge area of dead magic. From there they descend into a canyon and battle their way through the native creatures of the plane to find Despayr, the black dragon behind the entire plot. If the party succeeds, the Weave will heal itself, if they fail, Cormyr is in serious trouble.
