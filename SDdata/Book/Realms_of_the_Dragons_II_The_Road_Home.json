        "Summary": "On [[Marpenoth 17]] of {{yearlink|1367}}, the [[Company of the Chimera]], a mercenary organization, is partying in the [[Inn of the Seven Silvers]]. The head of the company, the half-[[duergar]] [[dwarf]] [[Tombli]], picks a fight with one of its members, [[Saskia]], an [[Uthgardt]] barbarian of the [[Great Worm]] tribe, after she refuses to drink as commanded. He strikes her by surprise on her way out the inn; their fight is briefly interrupted by a small explosion, which she takes advantage of in order to pound on his face. It takes twelve of the other mercenaries to restrain her.\n\nShe wakes up some time later, and sees that Tombli has purchased a [[pseudodragon]]. Though she tells no one, the pseudodragon mind-speaks to her, demanding to be freed. She refuses, and the dragon stings her with its tail. She falls prey to its poison, and is knocked out again. Her mind goes back to the trial of the Great Worm she undertook before leaving her tribe, pushed by the ominous magic that happened around her. She made her way to the cave of the Great Worm, and spent ten days without it coming out to see her; after she returned, she learned that the creature had been slain by adventurers.\n\nWhen she wakes up, she makes her way to the dragon and sees Tombli is tormenting the caged creature, whose stinger has been cut off. She fights him, and he swiftly beats her with his magic. In turn, she finally accepts her sorcery, and uses magic to push the key into the lock, freeing the pseudodragon. Without the cage, the drunk Tombli is overmatched by the pseudodragon, and flees. When the paralyzation ends, Saskia and the dragon steal a horse, and decide to make good on their escape, anticipating that their coming battle against the Company of the Chimera will be a worthy one.",
