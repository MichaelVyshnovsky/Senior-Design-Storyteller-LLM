It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|'''''THE POWERS MOVE IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.'''''\n'''''AT LEAST, THEY DID &mdash; UNTIL NOW.'''''\n\n''No ordinary tome can hold the powers of the planes, berk. That's why ''On Hallowed Ground'' is two books in one. In the first chapters, learn what divine compacts keep the gods from tearing the multiverse apart. Get the dark on turning player characters into proxies. Find out what happens when a spellslinger brings a petitioner back to life. And tumble to the awesome prestige &ndash; and awesome ''danger'' &ndash; of walking the Great Ring as a priest.''\n\n''The second part of ''On Hallowed Ground'' delivers the chant on hundreds of AD&amp;D<sup>&reg;</sup> game powers, from Aasterinian to Zivilyn &ndash; and just about every high-up in between. More than a summary of old material, it updates the AD&D game's gods for the [[Wikipedia:Planescape|PLANESCAPE]]&trade; campaign setting, featuring their trusted proxies, their brash rivalries, and their hard-won roles in the cosmos.''}}",
        "Description": "''On Hallowed Ground'' contains information about the planar domains of deities from 20 separate pantheons. New ideas and rules for priest characters on the planes are included, as well as tips on creating, visiting and surviving divine realms, comprehensive appendices listing gods by pantheon and portfolio, and planar maps.\n\nIn addition to the background information on the religions, the book also contains rules and mechanics for conducting religious ceremonies and spells, as well as new magic items and spells related to the deities.",
