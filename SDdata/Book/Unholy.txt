{{Quote|''Forces undreamed of even by [[Szass Tam]] have brought havoc and death to [[Thay]], but the [[lich]]'s true intentions remain a mystery—a mystery that could spell doom for the entire [[Faerûn|world]].''

''The formerly green fields lie in war-torn ruins. The formerly living populace in [[undead]]. And the formerly brilliant [[necromancer]], the mastermind behind the civil war that drove the ruling council into exile, appears to have gone insane. But rumor spreads of a reason behind his randomness—a reason all survivors of Thay must rally against. ''}}
