These auguries roughly foretold the history of Calimshan, including its nine [[Ages of Calimshan|Ages]]. In fact, the titles of Calimshan's ages were derived from the auguries themselves.\n\nOf the 22 Auguries, fourteen were believed to have already been fulfilled by [[1370 DR]]. The remaining eight prophecies were Auguries 12, 14, 16 through 19, 21, and 22. The sage [[Elminster Aumar]] had many theories about the meanings of the remaining auguries.",
