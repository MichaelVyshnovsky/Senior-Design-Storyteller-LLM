The Guild Hidden Rulers of Baldurs Gate  was a non-fiction book that discussed the Guild, the infamous criminal organization of Baldurs Gate.
This book was elegantly designed and bound in black leather. The cover featured the image of a silver, four-fingered hand.
One chapter of The Guild focused on Rilsa Rael, the kingpin of Little Calimshan. It outlined the tale of Rilsas life, from her childhood and through her rise to power within the Guild. It described her preferred methods of operations, along with the specific services she offered members of the Baldurian criminal underbelly.
A copy of The Guild Hidden Rulers of Baldurs Gate could be found in the possession of Mol, and her gang of young thieves that found refuge in the Emerald Grove.
