Complete weapons tables for all eras of play include lots of new weapons and revised characteristics for old ones.''\n\n''The Combat & Tactics system has been carefully designed to present sets of rules in easy-to-use modules that you pick and choose from and incorporate into your campaign. Regardless of which ones you do use, you'll find everything works with everything else.''}}",
        "Description": "''Player's Option: Combat & Tactics'' introduces a more detailed combat mechanics framework, utilizing battle maps marked with 1-inch square grids to delineate movement during combat scenarios. The default melee scale, used primarily for close-range encounters, defines each square on the grid as a 5-foot by 5-foot area. Conversely, the missile scale, which is employed for outdoor and long-range combat, assigns a value of 5 yards to each square. The Dungeon Master has the discretion to switch between these scales based on the specific conditions of each encounter.\n\nThe rules for weapon proficiency have been modified, allowing player characters to wield any weapon by allocating additional proficiency slots as needed. The structure of a combat round is now segmented into distinct phases, each comprising multiple steps such as initiative determination and execution of actions.\n\n''Player's Option: Combat & Tactics'' opens with a one-page introduction by authors Baker and Williams, explaining how the accessory provides a more realistic combat experience. It contains nine chapters, each addressing different aspects of the refined combat system. The first chapter expands on the Playerâ€™s Option combat system, building upon the foundations laid in the ''[[Player's Handbook 2nd edition]]'' and the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 2nd edition]]'', and introduces a gridded battle map system. Subsequent chapters explore a variety of combat enhancements such as tactical maneuvers, diversified fighting styles, and environmental impacts on battlefield dynamics.\n\nFurther chapters cover specialized topics including weapon specialization and mastery, advanced rules for unarmed combat (encompassing brawling and martial arts), and intricate systems for calculating critical hits. ''Player's Option: Combat & Tactics'' also expands the repertoire of weapons and armor, discusses the use of war machines, and outlines strategies for siege warfare. The final chapter focuses on monsters in combat, detailing the different creature types and their respective combat capabilities.",
