        "mainbody": "reature Catalogue is a Basic Dungeons & Dragons accessory published in 1986 by TSR, Inc.\nCreature Catalogue describes over 200 monsters, most of which had been collected from D&D rules and modules, as well as 80 new monsters which had never been printed before each monster is illustrated and indexed by habitat.  Creature Catalogue collected all the creatures first presented in the official Dungeons & Dragons adventure modules to that time, plus many new creatures and some converted from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. Also included is a comprehensive index of all Dungeons & Dragons monsters found in the Basic, Expert, Companion and Master rulesets.\nEach creature in the book is illustrated, and the entries in the book are ordered by type rather than just alphabetically. This includes six sections Animals (including giant and extinct varieties), Conjurations (such as elementals and golems), Humanoids, Lowlife (including insects, plants, and jellies and slimes), Monsters (a catch-all category), and Undead. The Intelligence score of each monster is listed with the rest of its statistics. The book also includes a comprehensive index of all monsters by environment, and Frank Mentzers guide on how to balance encounters according to the levels of the player characters, originally printed in the Master Set, is reproduced in the introduction.\n* Introduction\n* Main (Creature Name) Index\n* Animals Mundane, Extinct and Giant\n* Conjurations Magical and Other planar\n* Humanoids Tribal and Solitary\n* Lowlife Plants, Bugs, Worms and Goos\n* Monsters and Other Fantastical Creatures\n* Undead Mindless and Malignant\n* Creature ‘Type’ Index\n* Habitat Index\n (bekkahcheetahjaguarlynxspotted lionwildcat) (allosaurusankylosaurusbrontosaurustitanotheretylosaurus) (normalwar) (normalgreat) (electricgiantweed) (catfishpiranha)frog, giant poisonousgargantua (fish)hawk (normalgiant)lizard, giant foot-padmagpie (normalgiant)megatheriumoctopus, giantowl, giantoyster, giantpiranha, cold-waterporcupine, giantcrowravenrhinoceros (normalwoolly)shark, vamoraskunk (normalgiant)snake, rock rattler (normalgiant)squid, giant\n|ref   =\nCreature Catalogue Back Cover.jpg|Back cover.\nCategoryPublished in 1986\nCategorySourcebooks\nCategoryBooks\nCategory1st edition sourcebooks\n* Compiled by Graeme Morris, Phil Gallagher & Jim Bambra\n* Monsters created by Dave Alexander, Jim Bambra, Mike Brunton, William Carlson, Zeb Cook, Michael Gray, Phil Gallagber, Jeff Grubb, Gary Gygax, Bruce Heard, Tom Kirby, Ann Gray McCready, Michael Malone, Frank Mentzer, Tom Moldvay, Graeme Morris, Bruce Nesmitb, Doug Niles, Merle Rasmussen, Gamy Spiegle, Jean Wells, Skip Williams\n* Art by Jeff Anderson, Helen Bedfod, Gary Harrod, Tim Sell, Brian Williams, Geoff Wingate, Pete Young\n* Many thanks to Mike Brunton, Dawn Buton, Harold Johnson, Frank Menm, Carole Morris & Sarah peck"
