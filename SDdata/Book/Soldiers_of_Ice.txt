'''''Soldiers of Ice''''', by [[David Cook]], is the seventh book in the loosely related [[The Harpers series]].
{{quote|''In a snow-bound valley, beyond the aid of even the [[Harpers]], a lone village sits in the path of the relentless advance of ice and the fleeing [[gnolls]], pushing ever southward. Of all the Harpers, only the headstrong [[Martine]] of [[Sembia]] refuses to abandon the [[gnomes]] of [[Samek]] to their fate.''

''Risking her career as a Harper, Martine slides north to the valley of Samek in an effort to guide the gnomes to safety. When her plans go awry, she finds herself guest of the hermit-warrior [[Vilheim]] and distrusted by the gnomes she came to help. Torn between her future as a [[Harper]] and her sense of good, can Martine prevent a war that threatens to destroy the very villagers she has come to save?''
}}
==Summary==
[[Martine]] of [[Sembia]], a [[Harpers|Harper]] trainee, is sent by a senior Harper Jazrac to close a rift to the [[Frostfell (plane)|Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]] in the [[Great Glacier]]. She meets a former [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] called [[Vilheim|Vilheim Baltson]], who assists her. She seals the rift successfully, but not before [[Vreesar]], an ice elemental, escapes, taking control of the Burnt Fur [[Gnoll|gnolls]]  and leading them to attack the nearby Vani [[gnome]] village. 

Jazrac arrives and is revealed to be a coward who only sends others to carry out missions. Martine plans to give the stone used to seal the rift to Vreesar, sending him to try to reopen the rift. [[Krote Word-Maker]], a gnoll shaman who she captured, will attempt to take control of the tribe and make peace, while Martine and Vilheim try to stop Vreesar and Jazrac teleports to Shadowdale and sends Harper backup. The plan fails when Vreesar attacks the gnomes, killing Jazrac. Ultimately, Martine, Krote, and the gnomes kill Vreesar, although Vilheim dies in the process. Martine and Krote set out for Harper business in [[Mulmaster]].
