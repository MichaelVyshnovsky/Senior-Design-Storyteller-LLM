'''''History of Daggerford''''' was a common tome that chronicled the history of the city of [[Daggerford]].

==Contents==
The ''History of Daggerford'' started with the city's founding times. The city was build along the [[Trade Way]] south of [[Waterdeep]] on the shore of [[Delimbiyr River]]. The book stated Daggerford was over 400 years old and at the time of the book's writing, counted around 40 building made of stone and the Castle all protected by the high city walls.

The book continued talking about the origins of the city's name, the same name as the ruling family's. The book stated that Daggerfords ruled the city for five generations starting with the first Duke, [[Rugyar]] the Just.

Lastly, the book talked about Daggerford's reputation as being perceived by many as nothing but a backwater town that paled in comparison to cities like Waterdeep. The reputation was also affected by many criminals and corrupt politicians taking shelter in Daggerford, away from the law of bigger cities. The book admitted that despite all of that, the population of Daggerford was more diverse and cultured than other similar towns along the Trade Way.

==History==
In mid 14{{th}} century DR the ''History of Daggerford'' could be found in most libraries, bookstores, and many homes across the [[Sword Coast]]. The tome was especially common in Daggerford itself. The book itself was written and published during the reign of Duke [[Pwyll Daggerford]].
