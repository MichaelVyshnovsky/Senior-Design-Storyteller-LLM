This keep overlooks the Shadow Rift, a dark scar in the world that was once a gateway to the [[Shadowfell]] but has been dormant for many years. Now, an evil cleric of [[Orcus]], [[Demon Lord]] of the [[Undead]], seeks to re-open the gate, and the only thing standing in his way is a small yet determined band of heroes.\n\n''Keep on the Shadowfell'' is an exciting Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for characters of levels 1–3. It includes three double-sided poster maps suitable for use with D&D Miniatures.''}}",

        "Behind the scenes": "While ''Keep on the Shadowfell'' was designed initially for the \"[[Nerath|Points of Light]]\" core setting for 4th edition [[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]], alterations to the adventure made in an article in [[Dungeon magazine 155|''Dungeon'' magazine #155]] made it possible to use it as a dungeon for characters in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. These changes included changing the focus on [[Orcus]] to that of [[Shar]] and relocating [[Winterhaven]] to a geographical location in [[Faerûn]] between [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]].\n\nIn April 2009, the adventure was released online at [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s official website for download.",
