It introduces four Base Classes, several prestige classes alters some rules and includes a new system for becoming psionically focused. The base classes are the psion and psychic warrior (both of which are reprints from the Psionics Handbook), the wilder, and the Soulknife. The prestige classes are the Cerebremancer, Elocater, Fist of Zuoken, Illithid Slayer, Metamind, Psion Uncarnate, Pyrokineticist, Thrallherd and the War Mind.
It also contains four new psionic races—the dromites, elan, maenads, and xelphs—provides psionic versions of dwarves, githyanki, githzerai, and yuan-ti. It adds several new psionic monsters, including the intellect devourer and temporal filcher, and adds the ptheric template, which can make any creature a psionic creature.
