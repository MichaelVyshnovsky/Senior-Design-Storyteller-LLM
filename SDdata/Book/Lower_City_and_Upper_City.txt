Lower City and Upper City was a guide book written to familiarize newcomers of the Upper City and the Lower City of Baldurs Gate, published sometime before the late 15 century DR.
The volume described the main difference between the two parts of the city – the Upper City was the home of the Baldurian nobility or the patriars. The Upper City was protected by regular Flaming Fist patrols and well-lit streets and was notable for its wealth and beautifully decorated buildings. In comparison, the book described the Lower City as the polar opposite – a rarely-patrolled collection of narrow, chaotic streets, tightly-built homes inhabited by merchants, traders, crafters, entertainers, criminals, thieves, coinlassess, bartenders, and "knights and knaves."
In the , copies of Lower City and Upper City were found across the city, and one tome was kept in the printing basement of the Baldurs Mouth in the Lower City.
