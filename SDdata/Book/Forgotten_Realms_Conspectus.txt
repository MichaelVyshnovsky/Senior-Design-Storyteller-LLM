The Forgotten Realms Conspectus is a fold-out map, time, and account of the Forgotten Realms setting published by TSR, Inc. in 1995. It includes a map of Faerûn, a guide to Forgotten Realms products published around 1996, a brief timeline of the Realms with an account from the perspective of Alaundo the Seer by Ed Greenwood, and accounts from the perspectives of Elminster, Drizzt DoUrden, Khelben Arunsun, and the Simbul, with footnotes from Volo in a reversal of the usual order of things.
