'''Dungeon of the Hark''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

==Plot==
[[Stedd Rein]], leader of the [[Red Fellowship (Loudwater)|Red Fellowship]] has declared war on the bandit lord known as [[The Hark]]. He, his Red Fellows and the party march on The Hark's lair in the [[High Moor]]. On the way, they are waylaid by a pack of [[worg]]s and Stedd asks the party to clear out their den so his army's flank is protected.

{{Quote|Heroes of Loudwater, flock to my banner and let us do a good thing for the entire Delimbiyr. Too long has the Hark and his brood tormented the tradeways between Loudwater and the Sword Coast. Too long has it infected its plague to others. And now there is evidence that it wants to expand its territory into our very city. It is the duty to all good people to diminish this foe. I go. Who goes with me?|[[Stedd Rein]]}}
