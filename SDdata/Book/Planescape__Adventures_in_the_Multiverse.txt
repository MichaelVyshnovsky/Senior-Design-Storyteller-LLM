{{Quote|An adventure setting spanning the infinite realities of the world’s greatest roleplaying game.

Infinite realms of immortals and impossibilities, the Outer Planes brim with celestials, fiends, gods, and the dead&mdash;and they're all just a step away. Enter a portal to Sigil, the City of Doors&mdash;an incredible metropolis where portals connect to every corner of the multiverse. From there, venture to the Outlands, the hub of the Outer Planes, and discover wonders beyond imagination, as well as the secrets of celestials, fiends, gods, and the dead.

''Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse'' contains everything a Dungeon Master needs to run adventures and campaigns set in Sigil and the Outlands, as well as new options for players who want to create characters prepared to explore the planes.}}
