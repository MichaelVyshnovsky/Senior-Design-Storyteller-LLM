'''''Tyranny of Dragons''''' was a 10-paneled comic released online to coincide with the [[Tyranny of Dragons]] event. The panels were later included in ''[[Shadows of the Vampire 1|Shadows of the Vampire #1]]''.

{{Quote|
''For years, the evil [[Cult of the Dragon]] has devoted itself to creating [[Dracolich|undead dragons]] in a vain attempt to fulfill an ancient prophecy. However, the cultists were misguided. They misunderstood. But now, under new leadership, the cult believes that the prophecy does not speak of undead dragons, but of a dragon empire that’s been extinct for 25,000 years. [[Tiamat]], the queen of evil [[dragons]], has languished in the [[Nine Hells]] for millennia. The cult believes that the time of her return is at hand.''

''The cult has a new face and a new mission. It seeks to free Tiamat from the Nine Hells and bring her into the [[Forgotten Realms]]. To accomplish its goal, the cult needs five ancient [[dragon mask]]s and the support of evil dragons everywhere. The cult leaders—each one a "dragon whisperer"—have reached out to the evil dragons of the [[Sword Coast]] and earned their allegiance.''

''Meanwhile, evil dragons in partnership with the cult seek to amass a treasure hoard worthy of their dark queen, not by plundering their own hoards (of course) but by stealing money from cities, caravans, good-aligned dragons, merchant ships, and other sources. Their ravenous hunt for treasure throws the Sword Coast into upheaval. [[Neverwinter]], [[Waterdeep]], [[Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]—no city is safe from their depredations.''

''The situation is dire. However, the Sword Coast is far from defenseless. Powerful factions are ready to rise up and put an end to the tyranny of dragons. Adventurers throughout the Realms must join forces to face Tiamat, destroy the Cult of the Dragon, and prevent the rise of a new dragon empire. The [[Harpers]] have since shared their intelligence with the remaining factions. To combat the Cult of the Dragon, Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] of Neverwinter proposes that adventurers representing each of the [[five factions]] be sent north to investigate—and to report back with haste.''

''In their hands, the future lies.''

==Summary==
[[File:Portal Tuern.png|thumb|left|200px|''[[Cult of the Dragon]] and [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] agents at the ''[[portal]]'' leading to [[Tuern]].'']]
The people of [[Icewind Dale]] are being besieged by [[dragon]]s, which are protecting a group of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] as they search for powerful [[Dragon Mask]]s. [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] in [[Neverwinter]] summons the heroes [[Alaeros Margaster|Alaeros]],  [[Barrowin Undurr|Barrowin]], and [[Nymmestra Durothil|Nymmestra]] to investigate.

Meanwhile, the cultists have failed to fine the Red Dragon Mask, but have located a ''[[portal]]'', but before they can activate it, they are beset upon by the heroes, who are joined by [[Ratshadow]] (of the [[Zhentarim]]) and [[Talon Everhale|Talon]] (of the [[Emerald Enclave]]). They agree to work together to try to find the Dragon Masks before the Cult of the Dragon can.

The heroes travel through the portal to the island of [[Tuern]], where they find themselves at the heart of the island's volcano. They are attacked by one of the three dragon overlords, a [[red dragon]] that they manage to slay. Upon learning the news, the other dragon overlords fly about setting the island on fire.

The Red Dragon Mask is finally located by cultist leader [[Severin Silrajin|Severin]], who takes it back through the portal, ordering his followers to destroy it behind him. The heroes are left stranded, but travel back to Neverwinter through a ''[[teleportation circle]]''.

[[File:March of the Five Factions.png|thumb|left|300px|''The march of the [[Five Factions]].'']]
Severin recruits dragons to attack the city of Neverwinter as distraction while he looks for more Dragon Masks, which he intends to put together to form the [[Dragon Crown]] to summon [[Tiamat]] herself. During the attacks, Ratshadow finds the White Dragon Mask. He gives it to his faction, the Zhentarim, who take it to [[Waterdeep]], where it is promptly stolen to the villa of Lord [[Arthagast Ulbrinter]]. Ulbrinter disappears but his wife, Lady [[Remallia Haventree|Haventree]] knows nothing about it.

[[File:Tiamat'S Temple erupting.png|thumb|150px|''[[Tiamat's temple]] emerging within the [[Well of Dragons]].'']]
It turns out that Ulbrinter has been killed, the heroes learn through [[Varramzord]], the white dragon whisperer, who tells them that Severin has obtained the White Dragon Mask. IT was the last piece he needed to construct the Dragon Crown and summon Tiamat.

Lady Haventree convinces the [[Five Factions]] (Zhentarim, Emerald Enclave, [[Lords' Alliance]], [[Harpers]], and [[Order of the Gauntlet]]) to march on Severin and the Cult of the Dragon. The armies arrive just in time to see the spire of Tiamat's temple rising from the ground. The battle begins in full, with ground troops below and dragons above. Tiamat is summoned, but fortunately the [[metallic dragon]]s have come to aid in the battle.
