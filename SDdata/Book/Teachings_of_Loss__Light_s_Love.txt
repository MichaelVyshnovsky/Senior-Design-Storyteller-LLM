'''''Teachings of Loss: Light's Love''''' was a [[Sharran]] text, printed before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Love is arson - a destructive flame, offering fleeting light and comfort to the one who feeds it, while insulting Lady Shar's cold, infinite darkness.''|Excerpt from ''Teachings of Loss: Light's Love''}}

==Content==
The [[tome]] was dedicated to an important concept of the Sharran faith: the absence of love. The book preached a dogma of love being a destructive force in one's life, a type of corruption that can entrap and enthrall a person within a moment, a passing glimpse. Love's warmth and comfort were an offense to Shar's emptiness and oblivion, and as such, the Church commanded its devotees to forcefully extinguish any embers of love and affection in their hearts, leaving behind nothing by ashes and a hungry heart.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Teachings of Loss: Light's Love'' could be found in abandoned and ruined secret temple to Shar underneath the town of [[Reithwin]], the [[Gauntlet of Shar]].
