'''''Raised of Spells''''' an autobiographical song written by [[Alatelo De Bonito]], a mage guard and a financial advisor from the city of [[Athkatla]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Raised of spells and casting well, but always wanting better,<br/>To sing of knights and days of yore, to leave the robes that... that fetter!<br/>A wizard prone to song and prose, though oft accused of failing,<br/>I shall sing despite the odds...''|Alatelo De Bonito}}

==History==
''Raised of Spells'' written some time before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. Alatelo was an amateur singer and songwriter who attempted to perform his works at the inn named the [[Den of the Seven Vales]], where he was employed by [[Patricia]]. ''Raised of Spells'' was among the laments Alatelo sang to little enthusiasm from the clientele, apart from an occasion polite [[dwarf]]'s claps. The wizard's talents were lackluster enough to irritate Patricia provoking serious scolding.
