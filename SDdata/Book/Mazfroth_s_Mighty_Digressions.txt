Mazfroths Mighty Digressions was a collection of rambling essays by Mazfroth Gethur on a wide variety of scholarly topics.
The books cover was elegantly decorated with the title and Mazfroths name in black ink. Far less care was afforded the actual contents of the book, however most of the pages were hastily scribbled in the authors own handwriting, and his penmanship left much to be desired. Mazfroths Mighty Digressions contained 151 pages, though several of these did not match, indicating that Mazfroth kept adding pages to the volume over time. The tome was  tall and  wide, and was rather poorly bound, lending Digressions a haphazard and worn appearance.
The essays contained within Digressions had no particular unifying theme, save for their apparent interest to the author
* One essay discussed the nature of the Weave.
* Another essay covered various forms of lycanthropes.
* One of the chapters was devoted to listing various demon lords and tying the origins of several creatures to them.
Mazfroths Mighty Digressions was acquired by Amberdune Books, a book stall in Baldurs Gate which was secretly run by a pack of jackalweres. The Amberdune Pack had recently lost their leader, Nidalia, and sought to raise the funds to pay for a resurrection spell. The jackalweres had learned a ritual to create gingwatzims, shapechanging aberrations that could assume the forms of inanimate objects. They used this knowledge to create gingwatzim copies of their more valuable tomes, including Mazfroths Mighty Digressions.
In the , the Waterdhavian scholar Yalerion Highscroll purchased a gingwatzim copy of Mazfroths Mighty Digressions, intending to use the book to pay for passage into the fortress library of Candlekeep. Yalerions book was accepted by the Avowed, but before long the gingwatzim, requiring life energy for sustenance, began attacking other visitors to Candlekeep.
