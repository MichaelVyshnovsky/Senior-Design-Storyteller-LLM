{{quote|''Splendid, heroic deaths? Only in tales, ballads, and books, kitten. Death in battle is always brutal, painful, and messy–and there's never time enough then for those heroic scenes legends tell of. Too little time, too much death. There's never time enough in life for any splendid or heroic things, kitten. Remember that–and make time before you must die. If you do that, you'll have forged a better life than most.''|Excerpt from ''Words to an Apprentice'', quote from Laeral Silverhand}}

{{quote|''Weep not, child–whatever terrors your night dreams hold, someone somewhere in the Realms has faced and fought worse. Wizards who raise monsters from nothing, or twist them from simpler beasts, or call them from far and strange places, you see, are tormented by the evil they work and all of them dream darker than you can. That is their worst punishment—no matter what horrors keep you awake, all of them must nightly face darker dreams than this.''|Excerpt from ''Words to an Apprentice'', quote from Laeral Silverhand}}<br/>

This tome included quotes from such prolific individuals as Lady Mage [[Laeral Silverhand]] of [[Waterdeep]].
