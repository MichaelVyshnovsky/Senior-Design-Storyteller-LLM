{{quote|''Deep the heart's yearning for fairest Cormanthor, for the bright leaves of home, where the sun's kisses fall upon jeweled crystal spires, and summer winds blow through ancient oak bowers;<br/><br/>Soft the heart's turning through the long sigh of years, to the glades of Varaenae, where the Eadulith flows with moon-stippled grace, and lilaenril blooms within night's dark embrace;<br/><br/>O fairest of homes!<br/><br/>Sharp the heart's churning for that now-distant road, for the vale of Ny'athalael, where the dryads still sing of root-hidden beauty, and silver streams carry their songs to the sea.<br/><br/>O Cormanthor, Hail!<br/><br/>Through the heart's discerning, in shadow and flame, we carry the song of your glory within; Remember us dearly, your sons and your daughters, 'till we come once again to your soil.<br/><br/>To the bright, golden leaves of our home!''|An excerpt from ''Aelrindel's Lament''}}
