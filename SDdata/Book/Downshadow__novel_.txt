Downshadow by Erik Scott de Bie is the third novel in the Waterdeep series. It is also the first novel in the Shadowbane series.
In brief, the novel followed the adventures of the vigilante, Shadowbane, as he battled evil forces not only in the area below the city known as Downshadow, but also in the city of Waterdeep itself. It mainly focused on his protecting of the mysterious girl Myrin from the clutches of the dwarf mercenary known as Rath, the shape-changer, Fayne, and their even more mysterious patron, Lilton.
