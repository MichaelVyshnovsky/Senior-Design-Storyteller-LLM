Talis Divination Without Magic was a book that taught the reader to use a simple deck of talis cards to perform divinations without the use of the Art.
The book listed meanings of each card in a talis deck when used in fortune telling. Each card was illustrated.
One of these books belonged to Quelenna, a warlock looter of Gimblebocks gang. In , the gang was looking for a way into an ancient Temple of Jergal not far from the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands. Quelennas copy saw heavy use by the warlock and her lover Alys. Alys left a hand-written message on the books cover talking about fortune reading, and proclaiming love for Quelenna. Alyss last reading consisted of the Ten of Waves&mdashdivine loss, bliss, or illusion the Comet&mdashriches or fulfilled wishes and Death&mdashnew beginnings.
