'''''Talis: Divination Without Magic''''' was a [[book]] that taught the reader to use a simple deck of [[talis]] cards to perform ''[[divination]]s'' without the use of [[the Art]].

==Description==
The book listed meanings of each card in a talis deck when used in fortune telling. Each card was illustrated.

==History==
One of these books belonged to [[Quelenna]], a [[warlock]] looter of [[Gimblebock]]'s gang. In {{Yearlink|1492}}, the gang was looking for a way into an ancient Temple of [[Jergal]] not far from the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Quelenna's copy saw heavy use by the warlock and her lover [[Alys]]. Alys left a hand-written message on the book's cover talking about fortune reading, and proclaiming love for Quelenna. Alys's last reading consisted of the Ten of Waves&mdash;divine loss, bliss, or illusion; the Comet&mdash;riches or fulfilled wishes; and Death&mdash;new beginnings.
