        "Summary": "The story is about a supplicant to [[Candlekeep]], a scribe named [[Theldrant Ornan]]. With a [[Tethyrian]] group ahead of him in the road as the sun sets over the [[Way of the Lion]], he realizes they will not let him spend the night in their camp, and decides to cut across the forest, heading directly for Candlekeep rather than risk a night on the road.\n\nArriving to the monastery, he offers up an expensive book in excellent condition: the ''[[Black Tome of Magely Might]]'' by [[Maskauman]]. The monks reject it, however, as their collection possesses a score of copies of the book already. He is extremely dejected, but the monks ask if he has other books he'd like to share; his only other book is a heavily degraded tome he's been using for paper scraps. The monks reveal to him that it's a copy of [[Thalavoon]]'s ''[[Spells for my Sworn Mages]]'', written in a cipher he failed to discern. Overcome by shame, he nonetheless accepts to trade it for entry.\n\nWide-eyed and somewhat disturbed, feeling intense guilt over his actions with the book he abused, he is startled by the monks. The [[Keeper of the Emerald Door]] reassures him that he won't be held to account for what he did to that book as he didn't know better, but warns him that he'll be slain on the spot if he does that to any of their books. He's then introduced to [[Belabra (monk)|Belabra]], another monk; she holds him as he faints.\n\nWhen he wakes up, he's still in her arms, but in a different room: she reassures him, but warns him his time is limited. He is a witness to the [[Endless Chant]], and admits he's indecisive as to what he wishes to see in Candlekeep. Soon, he blunders into a room where numerous books unleash deadly [[spell]]s, and somehow finds himself in a different room after fainting, injured; he's found by [[Othraun]], a monk with the power to cast his sight through the books across Candlekeep. Othraun who warns him not to blunder into the wards of the [[Inner Rooms]].\n\nThe story abruptly ends when Othraun reveals he was once injured while experimenting with books, and that's how he learned how to look through them.",
