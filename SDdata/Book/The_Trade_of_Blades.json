        "mainbody": "'''''The Trade of Blades''''' was the book about the notorious [[Trade of Blades]] guild of [[Neverwinter]], penned by [[Augustavus Cale]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "Contents": "''The Trade of Blades'' was a lengthy self-published book filled with ranting about the City Guard of Neverwinter and Augustavus Cale's opinion that the Guard should not be trying to moderate mercenary activities within the city walls. The book posed a thinly-veiled threat, implying civil unrest and mayhem if the city of Neverwinter did not meet the needs of the mercenaries.\n\nThe book made an argument that sellswords who had no allegiance to any lord were a threat to Neverwinter unless they were granted access to the city and given accommodations within its walls. Even though many supposed that inviting these unsavory elements into the city was inviting trouble, Augustavus Cale countered that claim stating that if denied livelihood, these mercenaries surely turned to banditry.\n\nAccording to Augustavus Cale, the only solution was for the Trade of Blade to welcome the mercenaries into their ranks and impart them with a sense of kinship to Neverwinter.",
        "History": "In midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''the Trade of Blades'' could be found in the city of Daggerford, and steal other towns of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]]."
