        "mainbody": "Ivrynxras Exploration of Enchantments was a biographical magic textbook written by the Netherese arcanist and adventurer Ivrynxra Hoond.\nWritten in an informal, chatty first-person style, the book consisted of many entertaining accounts of Ivrynxras adventures as she encountered unusual magical effects and spell interactions. Besides the entertaining and informative style, the book had particular value in the rarely-studied yet utterly vital field of what precisely happened when opposing spells intersected, clashed, or overlapped.\nThe tales included the time Ivrynxra cast a spell on an invisible beholder while falling through the middle of a waterfall, or the time she accidentally struck a ghost with a conjuration spell aimed at another target, and met success regardless.\nIvrynxras Exploration of Enchantments was considered a classic and foundational piece of literature by the arcanists of Netheril during the Age of Discovery ( onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy, along with other works such as Sarturls Study of Magical Fields, Oloams on Serpentine Matters, Skouloonds Spell Studies, and Haerros Veltanabula."
