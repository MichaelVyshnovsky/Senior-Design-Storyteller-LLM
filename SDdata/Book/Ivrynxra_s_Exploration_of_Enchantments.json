        "mainbody": "'''''Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments''''' was a biographical [[magic]] textbook written by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and [[adventurer]] [[Ivrynxra Hoond]].",
        "Contents": "Written in an informal, chatty first-person style, the book consisted of many entertaining accounts of Ivrynxra's adventures as she encountered unusual magical effects and [[spell]] interactions. Besides the entertaining and informative style, the book had particular value in the rarely-studied yet utterly vital field of what precisely happened when opposing spells intersected, clashed, or overlapped.\n\nThe tales included the time Ivrynxra cast a spell on an ''[[invisible]]'' [[beholder]] while falling through the middle of a waterfall, or the time she accidentally struck a [[ghost]] with a [[conjuration]] spell aimed at another target, and met success regardless.",
        "History": "''Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments'' was considered a classic and foundational piece of literature by the arcanists of [[Netheril]] during the Age of Discovery ({{yearlinkConvert|2654|NY}} onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy, along with other works such as ''[[Sarturl's Study of Magical Fields]]'', ''[[Oloam's on Serpentine Matters]]'', ''[[Skouloond's Spell Studies]]'', and ''[[Haerro's Veltanabula]]''."
