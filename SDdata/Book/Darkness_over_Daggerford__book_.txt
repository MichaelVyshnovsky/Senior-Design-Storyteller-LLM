Darkness over Daggerford was a book that recounted the events of 1372 DR in the city of Daggerford and the activities of the Hero of Daggerord. It was compiled using the first-hand account of an adventuring band known as the Dukes of Daggerford.
In Daggerford, the autumn of the  became known as the Darkness over Daggerford. That period of time was filled with grim events that couldve led to the demise of the city. Like so much of the strife that plagued Faerûn, the Darkness was brought on by the Zhentarim. The crisis was triggered by the perceived death of Duke Pwyll Greatshout and an attempt by the Black Network to install a puppet onto the citys throne. The events of that fall culminated in Daggerfords ancient enemy, devil Gorgomorz leading an assault and bracing the walls of the city.
Ultimately, the city was saved by a brave hero only known as the Hero of Daggerord and his companions, Raegen Brunegar and Purfbin Doogrick.

The Dukes claimed that the Hero and his companions solved numerous crises that arose in the city and lands that surrounded it, including the Trollbark Forest and the Crabs Claw Coast, as well as delved into the depths of ancient Illefarn.
In the end, Pwyll Daggerford, along with his sister, were found alive and held prisoners by the Zhentarim and returned to their rightful position of rulership.
