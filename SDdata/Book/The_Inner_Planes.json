        "mainbody": "'''''The Inner Planes''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory. It is part of the ''Planescape'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|''Beyond the Prime's infinite crystal spheres, beyond the endless realms of the Outer Planes, lies the absolute reality of the Inner Planes. The cornerstone planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water are the most well-known Inner Planes, but they're only the beginning. From the deadly purity of the [[Positive Energy Plane|Positive]] and [[Negative Energy Plane]]s to the unbearable filth of the plane of Ooze to the eternal storm of the plane of Lightning, the Elemental Planes are the substance of existence itself. These eighteen planes form the foundation of the entire multiverse; they are the cauldron from which all energy and matter are brewed.\n\nThe Inner Planes details the Elemental, Paraelemental, Quasielemental, and Energy Planes. Surviving these planes can be a challenge, but within these pages DMs and players learn how characters can adventure among the unearthly locales and strange denizens.''}}",
        "Description": "''The Inner Planes'' was published by TSR in 1998, and provides a comprehensive guide to the Inner Planes.\n\nThe book is organized into several chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the Inner Planes. These chapters include discussions of the nature of the Inner Planes, their inhabitants and ecology, as well as the various portals and pathways that connect them to the other planes of existence. It detailed descriptions of the environments and regions of each of the eighteen Inner Planes.\n\nOne of the key features of ''The Inner Planes'' is its focus on the philosophical and metaphysical implications of the Inner Planes. The book explores the ways in which the elemental forces that underpin reality are intertwined with larger cosmic concepts, such as the balance between chaos and order, or the struggle between good and evil.\n\nIn addition to its detailed descriptions of the Inner Planes themselves, the sourcebook also includes new rules and mechanics for players and dungeon masters, allowing them to more fully explore and interact with the planes during their campaigns.",
