        "Description": "''The Leaves'' were a pair of black slate tiles joined together to open like a book by a series of silver rods and clasps. The tiles were about 18 inches (46 centimeters) square, and each was only 1 or 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) thick.\n\nInscribed on each tile were silver letters, which appeared like the letters of any script known to the observer. but they were magically indecipherable to anyone who tried to read them.\n\nWhen some individuals touched the book, a force of darkness would flow through them, whispering unintelligible words, as if the book were alive and speaking to them.",
        "History": "There was confusion about the creation of this ancient text.{{The Leaves of One Night origin}} The [[Shadovar]] believed that the work predated the [[Fall of Netheril]] in {{Yearlink|-339}}, and it was said to reside in the town of [[Sepulcher (town)|Sepulcher]], in the [[House of Mystery]] among its other treasures.\n\nIn truth, the text was not written until much later and not by Netherese hands. In the [[684 DR|Year of the Sundered Crypt, 684 DR]], a group of [[wizard]]s from [[Myth Drannor]] calling themselves the [[Dark Diviners]] discovered the ''[[Book of the Black]]'', a work containing the [[Black Chronology]] of [[Augathra the Mad]]. The cabal copied portions of the ''Book of the Black'' to create a new work called ''The Leaves of One Night''.\n\nBecause the work contained secrets that Shar did not want revealed, She then guided her servants to steal ''The Leaves of One Night'' in the same year. They were successful, and the only copy of the book was lost to history for many centuries.\n\nIn the month of [[Kythorn]] in [[1373 DR]], a [[shade]] [[priest]]ess of Shar named [[Variance Amatick]] received a vision from Shar, commanding her to retrieve ''The Leaves'' for the [[Shadovar]]. Among the treasures was the pair of slate tiles that were ''The Leaves''.\n\nOn the [[Eleasis 20|20{{th}} of Eleasias]] of the same year, the Shadovar were able to recover the work.\n\nWhile Keph tried to return the tiles to Variance, the [[shadow mastiff]] that she sent to retrieve them from him charged at him, and the magic of the tiles allowed him to somehow banish the summoned monster, but the magic left one of the silver letters inscribed on his thumb from where it had touched one of the tiles. The letter had transferred itself onto his skin and was forevermore missing from text of ''The Leaves''. From that day onward, he had the power to banish creatures of shadow.\n\nKeph reached Variance as she was battling with [[Feena Archwood]], a [[werewolf]] priestess of Sel√ªne. Variance abandoned the fight but was able to swipe the slate tiles from Keph's hands, vanishing into the shadows.\n\nVariance returned to [[Rivalen Tanthul]] and showed him ''The Leaves of One Night'', but neither of them could interpret either the silver letters or its magical, dark whisperings.\n\nIt was not until the [[Nightal 1|1{{st}} of Nightal]] of the next year that another priestess of Shar named [[Elyril Hraven]] figured out a way to interpret the magical text. She completed a ritual hidden in ''The Leaves'' that allowed her to summon the Shadowstorm, destroying the city of [[Ordulin]] in [[Sembia]]."
