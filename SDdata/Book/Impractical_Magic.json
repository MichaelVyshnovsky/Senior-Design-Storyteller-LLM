        "mainbody": "Impractical Magic was a collection of several volumes dedicated to the phenomenon of wild magic, penned by the wizard Bigby from the world of Oerth sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.\nThe Volume I included a conversation between Bigby and his accomplished comrade and sage Otiluke. The tome described the unpredictable effects of the wild magic that could turn the casters underpants into butterflies and shoes into curry-flavored jelly, when they attempted to cast the fly spell, but despite such hilarious effects, Bigby thought the wild magics origins were mysterious and harrowing. Bigby theorized that the wild magic might be coming from a sorcerers genes.\nThe second volume covered the strange topic of the dead magic zones. According to the author, the areas of dead magic first appeared during the Time of Troubles, when the magic of Toril was fractured and reassembled. This calamity left scars where magic was scourged, completely cut off from Mystras Weave. Any creature within such an area lost all magical abilities and effects.\nCopies of Impractical Magic could be found in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR, including within the thematic bedroom called \"Elminsters Library\" in the Sharess Caress brothel, and among many books dedicated to the Art on the shelves of Sorcerous Sundries in the Lower City."
