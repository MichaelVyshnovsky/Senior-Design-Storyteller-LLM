'''''Mhzentul's Runes''''' was the [[spellbook]] and workbook of the famous [[mage]] [[Mhzentul]], who lived in [[Faerûn]] during the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Description==
The thin but heavy [[book|tome]] contained twelve pages of vellum bound with silk, sealed with a red [[sealing wax|wax]] that was imbued with the blood of a [[dragon]]. The covers were made of oiled wood that was wrapped in the stretched skin of a [[wyvern]]. It featured a number of scorch marks roughly the size of a finger.

==Contents==
The first four pages of ''Mhzentul's Runes'' contained precise and detailed descriptions on how to create and [[Item enchantment|enchant]] a ''[[ring of spell storing]]''. Four of the ''[[seven lost rings of Mhzentul]]'' were known to have been of this particular variety.

Continuing on, the following five pages contained Mhzentul's notes regarding the creation of magical [[:category:rings|rings]] that could transform into a creature that could subsequently be controlled by the wielder. This section was incomplete and, according to his writings, Mhzentul could "see no manner nor means for imbuing the creature with any animation...".

The final section of the tome contained notes on Mhzentul's research into [[fire magic]], containing a number of [[rune]]s and glyphs written in varied, particular inks. It contained specifications on the following spells: ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[fire shield]]'', ''[[fire trap]]'', and ''[[delayed blast fireball]]''.

==History==
After Mhzentul's death in [[1340 DR]], a number of treasure hunters sought Mhzentul's hidden mountain abode but could not recover his namesake tome. It didn't appear in Faerûn until the year [[1346 DR]] when it was seen in the possession of the [[half-orc]] [[adventurer]] [[Uthmang]]. He was slain by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Alail Thang]], who took the book and held it until he was defeated by the [[priest]]s of [[Greenstone Keep]].

''Mhzentul's Runes'' was lost for two years before it was recovered by the [[sage]] [[Lhegrand]], who proceeded to describe its contents for posterity. He only kept it for a brief time before he was abducted by the [[orc]]s of [[Darkhold]]. The most recent rumors of the tome's ownership pointed to the [[Cormyr]]ian [[wizard]] of the [[Zhentarim]] named [[Whisper]] and was believed to have been interred with him within [[Whisper's Crypt|his crypt]].
