Faction War is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module. It is part of the Planescape campaign setting.
Faction War was written by Monte Cook and was published by TSR, Inc. in 1998.
The adventure module is centered around the ongoing conflict between the various factions that operate within the city of Sigil. The factions are organizations with their own unique goals, beliefs, and agendas, and each seeks to exert influence over the city and the planes of existence that it connects to.
The culmination of several adventures leading up to that point, The Faction War brought an end to the factions control of the city. Instigated by the power-hungry Duke Rowan Darkwood, factol of the Fated, in a bid to dethrone the Lady of Pain and rule Sigil himself, the war spread throughout the city before the Lady of Pain, with the aid of a group of adventurers (the players characters), intervened.
