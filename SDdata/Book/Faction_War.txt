{{Quote|'''''SIGIL'S BEEN AT PEACE FOR OVER 600 YEARS. ALL GOOD THINGS COME TO AN END.'''''

''Six centuries ago, events surrounding the Great Upheaval imposed an uneasy peace in the City of Doors. Since that time, the 15 factions have quietly conducted their philosophical battle for the hearts and minds of all Cagers - and always stopped short of all-out war. But now tensions are flaring, tempers are rising, and the Cage is about to explode into conflict!''

''Faction War is a 128-page adventure that tracks the war from its nefarious origins through its bitter battles to its ultimate resolution and beyond - and puts the future of [[Sigil]] in the hands of the player characters. This book reveals secrets, unravels mysteries, brings long-simmering plots to ahead, and marks the beginning of a new era for the City of Doors.''

''It also features the following:''

* ''New details on Sigil's wards, personalities, and politics''
* ''Adventures that draw the player characters into the heart of the struggle and toward the secrets surrounding the war's beginning and ultimate end''

==Description==
''Faction War'' was written by Monte Cook and was published by TSR, Inc. in 1998.

The adventure module is centered around the ongoing conflict between the various factions that operate within the city of [[Sigil]]. The factions are organizations with their own unique goals, beliefs, and agendas, and each seeks to exert influence over the city and the planes of existence that it connects to.

==Synopsis==
The culmination of several adventures leading up to that point, ''The Faction War'' brought an end to the factions' control of the city. Instigated by the power-hungry Duke Rowan Darkwood, factol of the Fated, in a bid to dethrone the Lady of Pain and rule Sigil himself, the war spread throughout the city before the Lady of Pain, with the aid of a group of adventurers (the players' characters), intervened.
