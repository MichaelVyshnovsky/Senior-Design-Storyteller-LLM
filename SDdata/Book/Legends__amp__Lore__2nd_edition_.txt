==Description==
''Legends & Lore'' is a comprehensive compendium that explores the mythology and folklore of various cultures, repurposing them for use in ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''.

''Legends & Lore'' is an expansion and revision of the earlier work ''[[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|Deities & Demigods]]'', which was first published in 1980. This newer edition, curated by [[James M. Ward]] and [[Troy Denning]], includes expanded content and introduces a number of changes to the format and presentation of the mythological figures, making them more accessible and usable for Dungeon Masters. The book is structured to present each pantheon separately, covering a range of cultures including Norse, Greek, Egyptian, and many others, as well as fictional pantheons created specifically for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''.

''Legends & Lore'' presented a refined selection of content compared to its predecessor, with certain segments, notably those detailing Babylonian, Finnish, Sumerian, and non-humanoid deities, being completely removed. The categorization of mythologies was also adjusted, with the Central American mythos being rebranded as the Aztec mythos, although the Nehwon mythos was preserved. In response to the exclusion of non-human deities from this edition, a subsequent publication titled ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' was released, which offered an in-depth exploration of these divine entities, surpassing the detail found in earlier sources and introducing a variety of new deities.
