The '''''History of the Dragon Coast''''' was a [[book]] that detailed the storied history of the [[Dragon Coast]] region of [[Faerûn]]. It was written by a famously erudite pirate who lived near [[Nathlan]].

{{Quote|The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin. Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day.|''Excerpt from the History of the Dragon Coast.''}}
