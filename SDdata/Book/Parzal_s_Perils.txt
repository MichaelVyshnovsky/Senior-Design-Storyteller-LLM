'''''Parzal's Perils''''' was an autobiographical book written by the [[arcanist]] [[Parzal the Outrageous]] in the land of ancient [[Netheril]].

==Description==
The book was an account of Parzal's eventful life up till that point, including the destruction of his family at the hands of a mysterious [[sohei]], his wandering in the [[Dunes of Death]], his time at [[Monastery of the West Wind]], and the adventures that followed afterwards.

==History==
Parzal initially had 1,000 copies transcribed for sale, but the initial run quickly sold out due to the incredible story within. [[Mortimar]] took note of his potential, and together they collaborated on building the chain of shops that included [[QM III]].
