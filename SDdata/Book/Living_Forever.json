Reprinted in the The Best of the Realms II in 2005. \nThe story followed Ondruu the Immortal, once a powerful elven war wizard, now a ghost within Myth Drannors mythal. The ghostly wizard communed with a group of adventurers and took them on a quick tour along the environs of the City of Song. He introduced them to other beings that dwelled within the mythal as well as told them of the recent invaders the Cult of the Dragon, led by Kya Mordrayn, and an army of drow elves. The adventurers eventually met a grizzly end at the hands of an angry ormyrr and a war band of drow as they attempted to flee the accursed ruined city.\nCharacters\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nCreatures\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nLocations\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull \nOrganziations\n &bull  &bull \nMagic\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull \nReligion\n &bull \nOther\n &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull"
