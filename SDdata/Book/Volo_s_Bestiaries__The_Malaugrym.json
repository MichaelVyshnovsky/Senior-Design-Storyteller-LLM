        "mainbody": "Volos Bestiaries The Malaugrym was one of the series of books penned by Volothamp Geddarm on the topic various monstrous creatures.\nVolos Bestiaries tome on the malaugrym opened with the theory that these creatures were twisted descendants of a wizard Malaug who was believed to be the first human to venture into Shadowfell. However, the book disputed that origin story as recently assumed false as they were also believed to come from a place even more alien than Shadowfell.\nFollowing the origins theories, the book delved into the creatures abilities and ecology. Malaugrym were able to create a flawless shapeshifting copy of any creature theyve witnessed. Many individual malargrym had one shape they deemed their favorite, which they assumed when threatened. These creatures shapeshifting abilities allowed them to seamlessly blend with any populations of Faerûn. They often settled in big settlements where they had unlimited access to their favorite delicacy - humans.\nVolos book claimed that malaugrym planned to invade Faerûn eventually. However, according to the book, these plans were often interrupted by the creatures inability to learn planar magics, inability to work together, and compulsive desire to amuse themselves with evil and cruelty. The malargrym were led by the Shadowmaster. Volo cited that until the very recent years before the books publishing, only five malaugrym were known to live in Faerûn however, the number was assumed to have doubled.\nBy 1374 DR, Volos Bestiaries The Malaugrym books could be found in several coastal cities of the Moonsea region, such as Hillsfar. A malargrym who impersonated Eremuth Silverwind owned a copy of this book that he kept inside his lair under the town of Elmwood."
