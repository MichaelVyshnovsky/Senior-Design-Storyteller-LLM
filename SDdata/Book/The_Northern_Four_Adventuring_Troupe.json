        "mainbody": "The Northern Four Adventuring Troupe was a book that retold the adventuring days of the Northern Four Nasher Alagondar, Dumal Erard, Ophala Cheldarstorn, and Kurth, published before 1372 DR.\nThis book was popular due to it chronicling the adventurers of prolific individuals who came to shape Neverwinter and the Sword Coast North. Nasher Alagondar, famously, Lord Neverwinter Dumal Erard, the founder of Helms Hold Ophala Cheldarstorn, who became the matron of famous Moonstone Mask and a significant figure among the Many-Starred Cloaks and lastly, Kurth who founded the Ship Kurth of Luskan.\nThe tome told of the groups adventurers through the years they stayed together. Some tales were a fact, and some were embellished with time passing. One of the most popular stories retold in this book was that of the rescue of the Black Raven tribe from a malicious white dragon. As a reward, Nasher was gifted with a \"debt-child\" who was to become a noted Neverwintan named Morregence.\nThe book stated that the Northern Fours end came following a leadership dispute between Nasher Alagondar and Kurth. After the future pirate leader left the group, Ophala settled in Neverwinter, the Jewel of the North, refusing to follow her lover to the city of the much-hated Arcane Brotherhood. Many believed Ophala held the Lord Neverwinter in contempt for the dissolving of the Northern Four. However, that was not true, and she loved Nasher as her past comrade and the Lord of the city. Kurth, on the other hand, harbored deep resentment of the man and hatred toward the Jewel of the North that culminated in a war between Luskan and Neverwinter in 1372 DR (long after the books publication).\nCopies of The Northern Four Adventuring Troupe book could be found around the areas of Neverwinter, Daggerford, and the Sword Coast North circa 1372 DR."
