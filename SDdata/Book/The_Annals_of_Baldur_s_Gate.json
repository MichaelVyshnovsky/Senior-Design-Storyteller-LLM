The history of the Gate was penned with a certain [[bard]]ic flair and filled with colorful exaggerations. The tome's preface{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-03-26 - Baldur's Gate History}}, when it became commonly referred to as the village of [[Grey Harbour]]. The city's later namesake [[Balduran]] left the city poor but eventually sailed back, bearing riches. The book's author claimed that Balduran's [[gold]] financed the settlement's first harbor, invested in its businesses, and erected a wall. As per the book's preface, Balduran became more famous than the village he was from, and with time it was renamed Baldur's Gate, leaving the city's previous names buried in maps and tomes of antiquity.",
