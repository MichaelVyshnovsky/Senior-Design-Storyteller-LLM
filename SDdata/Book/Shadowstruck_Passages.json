        "mainbody": "The '''''Shadowstruck Passages''''' was a collection of [[Sharran]] doctrines compiled within a single tome. It was one of the most notorious and illicit books of the faith and was banned in many of the realms across [[Faer√ªn]].\n\nPossession of the ''Shadowstruck Passages'' in [[Sembia]] was illegal and punishable by imprisonment for a [[tenday]] within the merchant nation. A single copy was worth around 100 [[gp]] on the black market."
