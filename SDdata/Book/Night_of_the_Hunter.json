        "mainbody": "ight of the Hunter is the first novel in the Companions Codex by R.A. Salvatore.\nIn 1484 DR, Doumwielle Armgo, a half-elf half-drow warrior and the wielder of the magical sword Khazidhea, and her father, the dark elf warrior Tosun Armgo, were traveling through the Underdark toward the underground drow city of Menzoberranzan when they encountered a band of dark elves of House Xorlarrin. Known for its many skilled wizards, House Xorlarrin was establishing a new drow city named QXorlarrin in\nthe ancient dwarven homeland of Gauntlgrym with the support of House Baenre, the First House of Menzoberranzan. The Xorlarrin force had been sent east from Gauntlgrym to find the tunnels that would lead to the region known as the Silver Marches. The party was led by Berellip Xorlarrin, the eldest daughter of Matron Mother Zeerith QXorlarrin and a high priestess of Lolth, the Spider Queen, the evil goddess of the dark elves, and her cousin, the wizard Tsabrak Xorlarrin. A fight immediately ensued between the Armgo pair and the Xorlarrins, but it was soon stopped, and Tosun and Doumwielle then introduced themselves to the other drow. When Doumwielle acted impudently toward Berellip, the priestess repeatedly struck the half-drow with her snake-headed whip as punishment.\nAround the same time, Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre, the unofficial ruler of Menzoberranzan, discovered that Lolth was incredibly angry at the drow city. Menzoberranzan was on the edge of civil war, since House Xorlarrin was soon to officially leave the city for Gauntlgrym, destabilizing the hierarchy of the ruling Houses. Quenthel ordered her sister, SosUmptu, the First Priestess of House Baenre, and her eldest daughter, Myrineyl, a high-ranking student at Arach-Tinilith, the training school for drow priestesses in Menzoberranzan, to summon a yochlol, a handmaiden of the Spider Queen, to attempt to learn why the goddess was enraged. While the two priestesses summoned the demonic creature, Quenthel met with her brother Gromph, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan, to discuss Lolths ire. Gromph had discovered that since the ending of the Spellplague several years earlier had caused chaos among the gods, Lolth was trying to expand her power by seizing control of the domain of arcane magic and had therefore elevated the position of the male wizards of Menzoberranzan, but he did not reveal this information to Quenthel.\nAlthough Sosumptu and Myrineyl did not specifically learn why Lolth was angry, the yochlol did tell them that the goddess wanted the drow of Menzoberranzan to be unified at that time. The handmaiden also informed the pair that Sosumptus mother, Yvonnel the Eternal, the renowned dead Matron Mother of House Baenre, would have understood the reason for the Spider Queens anger. After Sosumptu and Myrineyl revealed the yochlols message to Quenthel, the matron mother once again met with Gromph. The archmage took Quenthel to an Underdark tunnel outside the city to speak with the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp, Yvonnels secret advisor who was believed to had been killed over a century earlier. Gromph had been using Methil to access the memories in Yvonnels severed head, and now following Lolths commands, he had the illithid forcefully infuse Quenthel with his mothers knowledge, sensibilities, and understanding.\nBeing telepathically imparted with Yvonnels memories essentially transformed Quenthel into her mighty mother, and she now understood Lolths newest plans. Quenthel realized that one of the sources of Lolths rage was the drow ranger Drizzt DoUrden, an enemy of Menzoberranzan, but one whom the Spider Queen had unsuccessfully tried to corrupt in an attempt to harm his patron goddess, Mielikki, the goddess of forests. During a festival in Menzoberranzan a short time later, Quenthel and several other members of her family met with the nobles of House Fey-Branche at their home. Once Quenthel displayed her complete dominance over House Fey-Branche and all of Menzoberranzan, she reprimanded and punished Minolin Fey, the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, who had been trying to use Gromph to assist her in orchestrating Quenthels downfall and was pregnant with the archmages daughter. The Yorthae, an avatar of Lolth, then entered  House Fey-Branche and showed her total support of Quenthel. After the goddess departed, Quenthel told the assembled drow nobles that House Baenre and HouseFey-Branche were now close allies, that Gromph and Minolin would be married, and that the pairs daughter would be trained as her successor, named Yvonnel, and imparted with the knowledge and insights of the dead matron mother.\nMeanwhile, on the lone mountain known as Kelvins Cairn in Icewind Dale, Drizzt was miraculously reunited with his four reborn companions the former dwarf king Bruenor Battlehammer, the halfling fighter Regis, the barbarian warrior Wulfgar, and the drow rangers wife, Catti-brie, a Chosen of Mielikki and a proficient wizard. The group soon discussed how war between the Silver Marches and the orc kingdom of Many-Arrows seemed inevitable. The companions understood that the signing of the Treaty of Garumns Gorge in 1372 DR had been a mistake and that the goblinkin races such as orcs were inherently evil and always needed to be combated. Bruenor was determined to rally the peoples of the Silver Marches against the orcs of Many-Arrows, and his four friends agreed to assist him. However, the group decided that before they would journey to Mithral Hall, the dwarven stronghold that Bruenor had formerly ruled, they would make their way to Gauntlgrym to find their old comrade Thibbledorf Pwent, a dwarf battlerager who had been transformed into a vampire. Before leaving Icewind Dale, the companions visited the dwarven settlement beneath Kelvins Cairn and revealed their true identities to its inhabitants. Following a celebratory feast with the dwarves, the five friends began to journey south.\nAfter they had left Drizzt on Kelvins Cairn, the assassin Artemis Entreri, the dwarf priestess Amber Gristle O Maul (Ambergris), the warrior monk Afafrenfere, the elf warrior Dahlia Sinfelle, and the latters son, the tiefling warlock Effron, departed from Icewind Dale and traveled south. During the journey across the tundra, the group was attacked by a band of yetis, but they managed to quickly defeat the monsters. The companions made their way to the port city of Luskan, but when Entreri learned that it was essentially controlled by the drow rogue Jarlaxle Baenre, the leader of the dark elf mercenary company known as Bregan Daerthe, and his associates, he decided that the group would not enter Luskan and would continue traveling south until they reached the town of Port Llast.\nKnowing that Houses Barrison DelArmgo and Melarn were allied and planning to attain more power among Menzoberranzans Ruling Council, Quenthel ordered a Baenre force to attack the two Houses soldiers who were secretly assembling and training in the abandoned and sequestered compound of the destroyed House DoUrden. After the Baenre contingent defeated the enemy troops, Quenthel and the Matron Mothers of Houses Xorlarrin, Mizzrym, and Faen Tlabbar displayed the strength of their alliance by visiting House\nDoUrden together and declaring that the abandoned complex would be reconstructed. Meanwhile, MezBarris Armgo, the Matron Mother of House Barrison DelArmgo, met with Minolin to discuss the plot to destroy Quenthel that had been devised by her, the House Fey-Branche priestess, and Gromph. MezBarris wanted to immediately enact their plan, which included utilizing the balor Errtu and his prisoner, the drow psionicist Kyorl Odran, the Matron Mother of the destroyed House Oblodra, but Minolin revealed that she and Gromph would no longer move against Quenthel, since the leader of House Baenre was personally favored by Lolth.\nIn Luskan, Jarlaxle learned about Entreri and his comrades from Beniago Baenre, a lieutenant of Bregan Daerthe who was always magically disguised as a human because he served as the High Captain of Ship Kurth, one of the five factions of Luskan. Later that day, Beniago was visited by Quenthel, and after she beat and then made love to the disguised drow, she instructed him to assume complete control of the dark elves interests in Luskan. Jarlaxle was planning to journey to Port Llast to find Entreris party, but Quenthel and Gromph soon arrived at his headquarters in Luskan and ordered him to return to Menzoberranzan with his forces. Quenthel commanded Jarlaxle and his soldiers to prepare the DoUrden compound for proper habitation, and the matron mother explicitly told the mercenary leader that if he did not follow her orders, she would take complete control of Bregan Daerthe.\nAs Drizzt and his four companions were traveling away from Icewind Dale, they were followed by Braelin Janquay, a drow scout of Bregan Daerthe whom Jarlaxle had sent to the arctic region to watch for Drizzt. The friends soon realized that they were being followed and subdued Braelin, but once they learned the scouts identity and mission, they allowed him to accompany them in journeying south through the Spine of the World. Braelin stayed with the group until they reached the northern outskirts of Luskan, where the five friends met with Beniago. The disguised drow told Drizzt and his comrades that Jarlaxle was no longer in Luskan and that they should avoid the city to prevent their dark elf enemies from discovering their whereabouts. The band traveled to the village of Longsaddle, the home of the eccentric but talented family of wizards known as the Harpells, whom they hoped would be able to help them find a way to end Pwents cursed existence as a vampire. The Harpells told Catti-brie and her companions that there was no cure for vampirism, but they did provide the friends with a spell and a magical ring that might be able to trap Pwents soul in an enchanted gemstone. If the magic was successful, the group could then take the imprisoned Pwent to a powerful priest who could free the dwarf of the curse and send him to the afterlife.\nMeanwhile, Port Llast was attacked by a force of drow and driders led by the dark elf warrior Tiago Baenre, who was determined to hunt down and kill Drizzt. Tiagos band assaulted the coastal city in order to apprehend Entreri and Drizzts other former companions, whom they hoped would be able to inform them of the drow rangers whereabouts. Entreri and his four comrades fought valiantly against Tiago and his party, but ultimately the assassin, Dahlia, Ambergris, and Afafrenfere were captured, while Effron managed to escape. In addition, the force of drow devastated sections of Port Llast and slaughtered many of the towns inhabitants.\nAround that time, Quenthel, Gromph, Methil, and a band of drow journeyed to Gauntlgrym to view the fledgling Xorlarrin city. Upon their arrival, they met Tosun and Doumwielle, who had been taken to Gauntlgrym by the Xorlarrins. When Doumwielle protested her harsh treatment by the dark elves, Quenthel severely beat the young half-drow with her snake-headed whip. Afterward, Quenthel questioned Tosun, who revealed that he had lived on the surface in the Silver Marches for over a century, but had decided to return to Menzoberranzan with his daughter. Tosun also told Quenthel that Doumwielle had murdered her brother, who had not followed Lolth, and he personally had betrayed and seriously wounded the half-drows mother, the moon elf Sinnafein. Quenthel allowed Tosun and Doumwielle to join the party of dark elves accompanying her, and she then met with Tsabrak. The matron mother commanded Tsabrak to learn a powerful spell known as the Darkening from Methil, who would impart the knowledge directly into the mages mind, and then journey through the Underdark to the Silver Marches, where he would cast the enchantment. Created and powered by Lolth herself, the Darkening was a spell that would steal the daylight of the lands of the Silver Marches, changing the region into an advantageous battlefield for the drow of Menzoberranzan. The Spider Queen wanted the dark elves to wage war against the peoples of the Silver Marches as part of her plot to gain control of the domain of magic, as well as harm Drizzt and by extension, Mielikki.\nQuenthel later spoke with Saribel Xorlarrin, Zeeriths second daughter and a priestess of Lolth, and instructed her to hastily travel to Menzoberranzan with Tiago when he returned to Gauntlgrym. Before Quenthel left the Xorlarrin settlement, she told Berellip that the chamber in which a fire primordial, which powered the forges of Gauntlgrym, was magically entrapped would serve as the chapel of QXorlarrin. Shortly after Quenthels band departed from Gauntlgrym, Tiagos force returned to the ancient dwarven stronghold with their four captives. While Entreri, Dahlia, and Afafrenfere were imprisoned in the forge room of Gauntlgrym and regularly tortured, Ambergris was sent to work in the complexs mines.\nAs Quenthel and her entourage were making their way back to Menzoberranzan, the matron mother met with Gromph and came to the realization that the archmage was truly one of her most valuable and mighty allies. Quenthel later spoke with Tosun and Doumwielle, whom she planned on using as a way to gain an advantage over MezBarris in order to further strengthen her control over Menzoberranzan. Meanwhile, Berellip interrogated Entreri about Drizzts whereabouts and brutally beat the assassin when he did not provide her with the answers that she wanted. Gromph and Methil soon left Quenthels party and returned to Gauntlgrym, where the illithid intruded into Dahlias mind to discover the last place that she had seen Drizzt. Methil and Gromph learned that Dahlia thought that Drizzt was with the dwarves of Icewind Dale, and they also realized that the elf would have an important role in Lolths plans. Tiago, Saribel, and the priestesss brother Ravel, the leader of House Xorlarrins wizards, magically spied on the interrogation of Dahlia and ascertained Drizzts supposed whereabouts. Shortly after questioning Dahlia, Gromph magically transported himself to Menzoberranzan, while Methil remained in Gauntlgrym and frequently intruded into the elf womans mind in order to change her into an agent of the Spider Queen. Tiago decided to temporarily disregard Quenthels order to return to Menzoberranzan and journeyed north from Gauntlgrym in search of Drizzt with Ravel, Saribel, and a Xorlarrin strike force that consisted of drow, driders, and goblin slaves.   In Port Llast, Effron was determined to find and rescue Dahlia and his other companions from the drow, but he had no idea where to start searching for them. The same day that Quenthel and her escort arrived in Menzoberranzan, Jarlaxle met with the drow psionicist Kimmuriel Oblodra, his co-leader of Bregan Daerthe, and discussed the latest turn of events among the dark elves. Neither Jarlaxle nor Kimmuriel was pleased about being under Quenthels command and planned to find an opportunity to undermine the matron mother so that the mercenary band could become an independent organization once more.\nA short time later, the eight ruling matron mothers of Menzoberranzan assembled together and Zeerith formally withdrew House Xorlarrin from the city. However, following Lolth and Quenthels demand, Zeerith promised that QXorlarrin would be a close ally of Menzoberranzan, pay the city a tithe in the form of arms, and serve under the command of the Baenres in times of war. Once Zeerith departed, the ruling Houses that had been below the Xorlarrins in rank ascended to their new positions, and Quenthel declared that House DoUrden would be reconstituted as the Eighth House. Quenthel explained that House DoUrden would be formed through a cooperation of the other ruling Houses, with Sosumptu temporarily assuming the position of Matron Mother of the Eighth House, Tosun becoming the patron of the House, and Bregan Daerthe serving as the Houses garrison. Quenthel then informed the other matron mothers that Tsabrak was journeying east to the surface to enact the Darkening, and after he completed the spell, Menzoberranzan would follow the Spider Queens command by waging war against the Silver Marches. Following the gathering of the Ruling Council, Quenthel met with Gromph, who revealed that he knew that she planned on naming Tiago as House DoUrdens weapons master and Tsabrak as the House wizard.\nAfter only a brief stay in Longsaddle, Drizzt and his companions left the village and journeyed east toward Gauntlgrym. As they were traveling through the wilderlands of the Crags, the group was attacked by the lich Ebonsoul, who had been seeking Regis. The friends could not defeat Ebonsoul, but Catti-brie managed to trap the undead wizard within the magical gemstone that was supposed to be used to ensnare Pwents soul. Although their original plan was now ruined, the group decided to continue their journey to Gauntlgrym. The companions soon reached the upper levels of the ancient dwarven stronghold, where they battled several bands of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears who served the Xorlarrins while they searched for Pwent. After defeating a large number of goblinkin, they encountered Pwent, who could seldom control the monstrous tendencies of his curse, and he immediately attacked them. Following a short fight, Catti-brie tried to capture Pwents soul, but the magic was unsuccessful and the undead dwarf escaped. However, before he departed, Pwent told the five friends that Entreri, Dahlia, Ambergris, and Afafrenfere were being held prisoner by the drow in the lower levels of Gauntlgrym. Even though it meant that they would have to confront the dark elves, Drizzt and his comrades decided that they would rescue Entreri and the others as well as discover a way to end Pwents cursed life.\nMeanwhile, Tiago and his formidable force assaulted the dwarven complex beneath Kelvins Cairn in an attempt to find Drizzt. Tiagos contingent managed to eventually defeat the dwarves after a brutal battle, but many of the drow, driders, and goblins were slain, including Jearth Xorlarrin, the weapons master of House Xorlarrin. Following the clash, Tiago and his band imprisoned the surviving dwarves, who informed them that Drizzt had left Icewind Dale a long time earlier.\nIn Menzoberranzan, Quenthel and Gromph met with MezBarris and several of the other Armgo nobles in order to secure an alliance with House Barrison DelArmgo. Quenthel revealed to the Armgos that House DoUrden would lead the fight in the Silver Marches, but all the Houses of Menzoberranzan and QXorlarrin would contribute representatives to the force sent to the surface. However, the actual drow company would not be large, and Lolth and Quenthels plan was that the dark elves would instead utilize the orcs of Many-Arrows. The vast army of the orc kingdom would do the majority of the fighting against the peoples of the Silver Marches, while the drow would primarily serve as advisors who directed the offensive. This strategy ensured that no matter the outcome of the war, the drow would not suffer any serious losses themselves. Quenthel also informed the Armgo nobles that Tosun would be one of the leaders of the force sent against the Silver Marches. Shortly after they spoke with MezBarris and her family, Quenthel and Gromph met with Jarlaxle and discussed the coming conflict. Jarlaxle convinced Quenthel to allow some of his soldiers to return to Luskan, but the matron mother told the mercenary leader that he would remain in Menzoberranzan and have no part in the campaign against the Silver Marches because of his close relationship with Drizzt. Quenthel and Gromph later had another discussion about the war, and the matron mother explained that in addition to Tosun, the contingent sent to the east would be commanded by Tiago and Saribel. Quenthel also revealed that she was determined to make certain that Tiago survived the war, but Tosun did not, and that after the end of the conflict, she planned on using House DoUrden to gain more power on the Ruling Council.\nIn Gauntlgrym, Drizzt tracked down Pwent, and following a brief fight, the vampire managed to control his curse and restrain himself. Drizzt was able to convince Pwent to help him and his companions rescue Entreri and the others, and the undead dwarf then guided the group to the forge room of Gauntlgrym, where Entreri and Afafrenfere were being held in cages. The five friends, Drizzts magical panther Guenhwyvar, Pwent, and several drow who had been transformed into vampires and were controlled by the undead dwarf immediately entered the chamber and engaged an enemy force consisting of dark elves, driders, and goblin slaves. As the combatants fought throughout the forge room, Entreri escaped from his cage and quickly joined the chaotic battle. Drizzt and his comrades ultimately defeated the Xorlarrin band, while Berellip and the other drow in Gauntlgrym withdrew to the lowest levels of the complex to avoid a confrontation with the formidable group. After the end of the fight, Pwent and his surviving vampire minions attacked Drizzt and his companions, but the undead drow were soon defeated and Catti-brie managed to trap the dwarf vampires soul in a magical silver horn possessed by Wulfgar. Once Afafrenfere was freed, Drizzt and Entreri swiftly made their way to Gauntlgryms mines to rescue Ambergris, while the others remained in the forge room.\nCatti-brie soon received a magical call from the primordial and was drawn to the primordial chamber, where the godlike being unsuccessfully tried to persuade her to free it. Catti-brie was attacked by a water elemental that had been commanded to guard the chamber, but she eventually managed to destroy the creature. Catti-brie was then confronted by Dahlia, who had been dominated by Lolth and was now a servant of the evil goddess. While Drizzt and Entreri freed Ambergris from Gauntlgryms mines, Dahlia and two large jade spiders that served as guardians of the QXorlarrin chapel assailed Catti-brie. Following a vicious fight, Catti-brie slew the spiders with some assistance from the primordial and defeated Dahlia by using magic to collapse part of a nearby tunnel onto the elf woman.\nWhen Catti-brie, Drizzt, and the others were later reunited, they decided to leave Gauntlgrym, except for Entreri, who chose to remain in the complex. Entreri had loved Dahlia and wanted to gain some vengeance on the drow for transforming her into an agent of the Spider Queen. Before Drizzt and his companions departed from Gauntlgrym, Bruenor placed his axe, shield, and helmet in the ancient dwarven homelands main forge and received a gift from the dwarf gods, who infused his weapons with powerful magic. Once the group left Gauntlgrym and reached the surface, Afafrenfere and Ambergris decided to journey to the kingdom of Damara, while Drizzt and the others began to make their way toward Port Llast and Longsaddle.\nShortly after the fight between Dahlia and Catti-brie, Quenthel and Gromph magically transported to Gauntlgrym and met with Methil, who revealed that he had used his psionic abilities to secretly save the elf woman from being killed by the collapsing tunnel. The Xorlarrins soon returned to the main areas of the complex, but when Berellip entered her personal chambers, she was attacked and killed by Entreri, who then left Gauntlgrym. A short time later, Tiago and his diminished force returned to Gauntlgrym with a sizeable number of dwarf slaves. When Tsabrak and his escort of drow reached the Silver Marches, the Xorlarrin wizard cast the Darkening and acted as a conduit for Lolth. The Spider Queen successfully stole the daylight from the Silver Marches, preparing the battlefield for her drow minions. Gromph magically transported to the surface with Tosun and Doumwielle to witness the Darkening, but he soon had to depart for Gauntlgrym. When Zeerith arrived in the fledgling Xorlarrin city, she was met by Quenthel and Gromph, who introduced her to Dahlia and revealed that the elf was now the Matron Mother of House DoUrden.\nMain\nDrizzt DoUrden • Bruenor Battlehammer • Catti-brie • Regis • Wulfgar\nSupporting\nAfafrenfere • Ambergris • Artemis Entreri • Berellip Xorlarrin • Dahlia Sinfelle • Doumwielle Armgo • Effron • Gromph Baenre • Jarlaxle • MezBarris Armgo • Methil El-Viddenvelp • Quenthel Baenre • Thibbledorf Pwent • Tiago Baenre • Tosun Armgo • Tsabrak Xorlarrin\nMinor\nAndahar • Andzrel Baenre • Bellows • Beniago Kurth • Braelin Janquay • Brimble • Byrtyn Fey • Calagher • Danifae Yauntyrr • Dowell Harpell • Ebonsoul • Flavvar • Geldrin Fey • Gorin • GuenhwyvarJearth Xorlarrin • Junkular Stonebreaker • Kimmuriel Oblodra • Kipper Harpell • Malagdorl Armgo • McGrits • Melkatka • Minolin Fey • Minto Silverhammer • MyrineylBaenre • Mizri Mizzrym • Penelope Harpell • Ravel Xorlarrin • Rumblebelly • Saribel Xorlarrin • Sinnafain • SosUmptu Baenre • StokelySilverstream • Taayrul Armgo • Tregor Hornbruck • Vadalma Tlabbar • Velkryst • Yerrininae • Zeerith QXorlarrin • Zeknar Fey\nAumon Baenre • Cadderly Bonaduce • Calihye • Dantrag Baenre • Donnola Pericolo • Doregardo • Emerus Warcrown • Errtu • Golfanin • Gruumsh • Kyorl Odran • Mielikki • Montolio DeBrouchee • Nojheim • Lolth • Obould Many-Arrows • Pericolo Topolino • Praeanelle Duskryn • Serena • Shakti Hunzrin • Uthegental Armgo • Yvonnel Baenre • Zhindia Melarn\nCrags • Gauntlgrym (QXorlarrin) • Icewind Dale • Kelvins Cairn • Kingdom of Many-Arrows • Lonelywood • Longsaddle • Luskan • Menzoberranzan • Northdark • Port Llast • Spine of the World • Silver Marches • Underdark\nbugbear • drider • drow • dwarf • fire primordial • goblin • hobgoblin • illithid • lich • nightmare • riding lizard • spider • tundra yeti • undead • vampire • water elemental • yochlol • zombie\nItems\nAegis-fang • Icingdeath • Khazidhea • Kozahs Needle Orbbcress • Skullcrusher (mace) • Taulmaril • Twinkle • Vidrinath"
