'''''Faldorn's Canticle: The Shadow Druid's Doctrine''''' was a tome that collected the set of beliefs of the Shadow Druids, penned by [[Faldorn]] sometime before [[1492 DR]].

==Description==
''Faldorn's Canticle'' was an old tome with its covers sprouting [[moss]] in the corners and was home to buzzing insects.

==Contents==
The Shadow Druid doctrine called for isolationism and aggression, claiming the balance of the nature was merely a myth.

{{quote|''Balance is a myth. Where any clan treads, nature struggles.<br/>Unity is a fiction. Men of mere flesh seek only to tame beast and raze flors.<br/>We are thunder, and we are rain. We shatter mankind, and grow new life in its place.''|The excerpt from ''Faldorn's Canticle'' bookmarked by [[Kagha]].}}

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], a copy of this book was in possession of a [[druid]] named Kagha who was part of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. She secretly followed ''the Shadow Druid's Doctrine'' and hoped to perform the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]''. Kagha's copy of the book was rugged by heavy use, its spine was softened and the book had a pared folded to mark a specific passage.
