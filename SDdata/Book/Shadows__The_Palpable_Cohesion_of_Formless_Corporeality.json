        "Description": "''Shadows'' was a tome describing the [[Plane of Shadow]], based on investigations by Telamont himself and a group of other researchers. It was careful not to rudely dismiss previous beliefs on planar mechanics and explained the concept of [[demiplane]]s and [[quasiplane]]s thoroughly, beyond simply describing research into the Shadow Plane.",
        "History": "When a student at [[Karsus]]'s [[Academy of Mentalist Study]], Telamont Tanthul published a thesis on the [[planes|planes of existence]]. His work was scorned, and he was expelled, because thinking at the time insisted that all planes branched from [[Netheril]] itself. Further study of the demiplanes and quasiplanes was banned in a number of cities of Netheril.\n\nNevertheless, Karsus himself found the work fascinating, and secretly, he invited Telamont to return and continue his studies,\n\nAfter eleven years, sometime in the &minus;390s [[DR]], Upon its publication, which was lauded and approved by Karsus, other [[archwizard]]s recognized the importance of the research and the advantages of exploiting the Shadow Plane for magical power, as a source of shadow servants and the basis for Shadow's [[shadow magic]]. and other students were now instead encouraged to investigate such planes."
