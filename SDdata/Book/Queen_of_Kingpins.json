        "Contents": "The book held information on the Guild, including the name and description of one of its thugs, [[Tusgront]], who guarded the entrance to Nine-Fingers' base or at least one of the Guild's hideouts in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. The book also had detailed information on the Guild's individual thugs, whom the Flaming Fist considered to be quite dim-witted. The book's tone changed when it talked about [[Astele Keene]] herself. It noted her sharp intelligence and used sullen, fearful tones.",
        "History": "A copy of ''Queen of Kingpins'' was stored in the basement and the printing room of the [[Baldur's Mouth]] offices in the Lower City in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
