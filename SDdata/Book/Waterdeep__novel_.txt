Midnight, Adon, and Kelemvor begin traveling to Waterdeep, where Elminster told them they would find the second Tablet of Fate. They are pursued by Cyric and the Zhentarim, as well as the avatar of Bhaal. Bhaal kidnaps Midnight and the Tablet, leading to an alliance of convenience between Cyric, Kelemvor, and Adon. They attack Bhaal, and Cyric kills him with a sentient magic sword. Kelemvor, Adon, and Midnight leave Cyric for dead, and arrive in Waterdeep. Midnight recovers the second Tablet from Bone Castle, unleashing an army of the inhabitants of the Realm of the Dead on Waterdeep in the process. Myrkuls avatar attempts to reclaim the tablets but is killed by Midnight. However, Cyric attacks as well, killing Kelemvor and stealing the Tablets of Fate. Midnight and Adon ride to the top of Mount Waterdeep with the Griffon Cavalry, where there is a celestial stair that Cyric intends to climb. Cyric arrives at the top with the tablets, but Ao descends before battle can begin. He destroys the tablets, announcing that the gods misunderstood their purpose, and that their power will now depend on their followers. The gods return to their former state. Ao resurrects Torm and makes Midnight god of magic and Cyric god of murder, strife, and death. He leaves Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul dispersed.
