        "mainbody": "'''''Lower City and Upper City''''' was a guide [[book]] written to familiarize newcomers of the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] and the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], published sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Content": "The volume described the main difference between the two parts of the city – the Upper City was the home of the Baldurian nobility or the [[patriar]]s. The Upper City was protected by regular [[Flaming Fist]] patrols and well-lit streets and was notable for its wealth and beautifully decorated buildings. In comparison, the book described the Lower City as the polar opposite – a rarely-patrolled collection of narrow, chaotic streets, tightly-built homes inhabited by merchants, traders, crafters, entertainers, criminals, thieves, [[coinlass]]ess, bartenders, and \"knights and knaves.\"",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, copies of ''Lower City and Upper City'' were found across the city, and one tome was kept in the printing basement of the [[Baldur's Mouth]] in the Lower City."
