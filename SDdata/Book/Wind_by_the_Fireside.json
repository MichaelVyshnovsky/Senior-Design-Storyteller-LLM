        "mainbody": "Wind by the Fireside was a traditional trail ballad by an unknown composer, popular across the Savage Frontier and the Sword Coast North, with many different forms and variations.\nThe precise origin and history of Wind by the Fireside were not known, but sages agreed that the poem itself had changed a lot with the passing of centuries. This became clear when taking into account the many versions and variations of the poem in various regions of the Realms. However, the sages did not know what the poem was originally, the extent of the changes, or how or why it changed, only being certain that alterations did take place.
