{{Quote
|''The shadows deepen in every corner of the Realms.''

''The sun no longer shines on a man who has embraced the darkness whithin him.'' 

''The day's opposite finds [[Erevis Cale]] so far along the path away from his own humanity, he may never again walk as a man.'' 

''In the end, to be [[Chosen]] by a god like [[Mask]] is more curse than blessing.''
