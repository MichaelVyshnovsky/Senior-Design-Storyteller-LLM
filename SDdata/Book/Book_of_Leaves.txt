The Book of Leaves was an enchanted tome that first appeared in the early 14 century DR in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
This obviously magic item was a book bound in tree bark with pages of pressed dried tree leaves. The book did not have bindings nor glue, instead being held together by magic. When the Book of Leaves was held by a druid whose feet touched the ground, tree bark rose from the earth and grew over the druids body, giving them the defensive benefit of the barkskin spell.
