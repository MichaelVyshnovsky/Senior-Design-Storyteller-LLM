This introductory campaign is designed to take characters from levels 1 to 6. The scenario involves a young white dragon, Cryovain, who has recently arrived in the region from the north (thus setting the adventure as a tentative sequel to the events of Storm Kings Thunder) and begun hunting and attacking sites all across the map.  Similar to Lost Mine of Phandelver (the adventure from the Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set), this adventure takes place around the town of Phandalin, and makes use of the same cast of town inhabitants as well as the same basic map of the Sword Coast North. However, rather than playing through a narrative, the Essentials Kit provides a blueprint for a sandbox style of play by delivering most quests to the players via a "quest board" managed by Phandalins townmaster, Harbin Wester. Players do not need to complete all quests available to them, and more challenging quests become available as easier ones are completed. Other quests or adventure locations are only hinted at through rumors, and can be integrated into or left out of the campaign as desired.
Adventurers are called on initially not to fight the dragon, but just to help the town of Phandalin protect itself while dealing with other consequences of the dragons arrival. The initial three quests involve warning the outlying locals about the dragon, and in turn helping them to resolve additional conflicts. These quests send the party to visit a dwarven excavation of a temple to Abbathor (as orcs attack), the rock gnome enclave of Gnomengarde (being terrorized by a mimic), and the local midwife at Umbrage Hill (being attacked by a manticore). Completing two of these three quests unlocks three follow-up quests to go to Butterskull Ranch (following an orc attack), to deliver supplies to a logging camp (amidst attacks by ankhegs incited by orcs), and to escort a mine overseer to Mountains Toe gold mine (which has been infested with wererats driven from their home by orcs). After completing two of these three quests, a final series of quests become available which begin to lead to a confrontation with the dragon clearing out a dwarven ruin called Axeholm, seeking a dragon slayer sword at the Dragon Barrow of Tanamere Alagondar, and fighting orcish spellcasters called the Anchorites of Talos who have been attacking Falcons hunting lodge in Neverwinter Wood. Each quest involving orcs, along with a few adventure sites not linked to the quest board, help the adventurers piece together that Cryovain has claimed the orcs old stronghold of Icespire Hold on Icespire Peak as its lair. With this knowledge and the experience gained from their many quests, the party can confront the dragon once and for all.
A follow-up series of adventures called Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak was made available in three parts exclusively through D&D Beyond, and subsequently for various virtual tabletop platforms. These were Storm Lords Wrath, Sleeping Dragons Wake, and Divine Contention. Each could be purchased as a standalone product, or could be accessed for free using QR codes included with the purchase of a physical copy of the Dungeons & Dragons Essentials Kit.
The Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak adventure makes reference to some events from Dragon of Icespire Peak and utilizes the same map and some of the same locations, but it is not a continuation of the same story. However, some elements of Dragon of Icespire Peak serve as direct foreshadowing for Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak, most notably the Tower of Storms optional location and the role of the Anchorites of Talos.
