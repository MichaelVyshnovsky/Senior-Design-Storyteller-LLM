        "mainbody": "owgentles Book was a compilation of the magical teachings of the mage Bowgentle of Silverymoon.\nthumb|left|150px|The rune of Bowgentle.\nThe cover of the book was made from a thin slab of slate bound in Amnian yoxen leather that was dyed a glossy black color. It was embossed with a pattern of a human and a dragon and had an oval plate on its center that had Bowgentles personal rune. There were 53 sheets of vellum in the book, sewn into the spine with silk.\nBowgentle sought magical knowledge from many dangerous locations in Faer√ªn during his years. In his old age, the mage stopped by the House of Wonder, wrote down his spells, and shared them with the apprentices there. When Bowgentle died, and the Masters of the school learned of his passing, they ordered a compilation of his spells to be written and titled it Bowgentles Book. It was closely guarded in the schools library.\nSome years later, fiends attacked the school, slew the masters and most of the apprentices, and burned its walls and towers. Thieves looted the school, while it was still smoldering, and among their loot was Bowgentles Book. Years later, it appeared in a cache of goods acquired by the master thief Vaerum in Scornubel and was accurately identified by the sage Laertilus. Vaerums guild found itself in a \"gray war\" with another group of thieves and the spellbook vanished. Its whereabouts were unknown as of 1359 DR.\nThe banshee Agatha said, apparently truthfully, that she traded Bowgentles Book to Tsernoth, a necromancer from Iriaebor some time before 1391 DR, but did not know the whereabouts of the book after that.This is \"more than a hundred years ago\" from circa 1491 DR.\nThe books 53 pages contained many common and uncommon spells, two that were unique as of its publication and one that was crafted by Bowgentle himself. Three pages were dedicated to applications and preparations for the spell cantrip.
