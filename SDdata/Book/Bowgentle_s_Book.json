        "Description": "[[File:Bowgentle's Rune.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The rune of Bowgentle.'']]\nThe cover of the book was made from a thin slab of slate bound in [[Amn]]ian [[ox|yoxen]] leather that was dyed a glossy black color. It was embossed with a pattern of a [[human]] and a [[dragon]] and had an oval plate on its center that had Bowgentle's [[mage sigil|personal rune]]. There were 53 sheets of vellum in the book, sewn into the spine with [[silk]].",
        "History": "Bowgentle sought [[magic]]al knowledge from many dangerous locations in [[Faer√ªn]] during his years. In his old age, the mage stopped by the [[House of Wonder]], wrote down his spells, and shared them with the apprentices there. When Bowgentle died, and the Masters of the school learned of his passing, they ordered a compilation of his spells to be written and titled it ''Bowgentle's Book''. It was closely guarded in the school's library.\n\nSome years later, [[fiend]]s attacked the school, slew the masters and most of the apprentices, and burned its walls and towers. [[Thieves]] looted the school, while it was still smoldering, and among their loot was ''Bowgentle's Book''. Years later, it appeared in a cache of goods acquired by the master thief [[Vaerum]] in [[Scornubel]] and was accurately identified by the sage [[Laertilus]]. Vaerum's guild found itself in a \"gray war\" with another group of thieves and the spellbook vanished. Its whereabouts were unknown as of [[1359 DR]].\n\nThe [[banshee]] [[Agatha]] said, apparently truthfully, that she traded ''Bowgentle's Book'' to [[Tsernoth]], a [[necromancer]] from [[Iriaebor]] some time before [[1391 DR]], but did not know the whereabouts of the book after that.<ref><ref group=\"note\">This is \"more than a hundred years ago\" from ''circa'' [[1491 DR]]."
