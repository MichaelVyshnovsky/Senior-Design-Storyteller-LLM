        "mainbody": "'''''Caution Before the Seelie''''' was an anthropological and autobiographical work on the place of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] published sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This exceedingly rare tome of lore was grimy and covered in dust with yellow feathers and tufts of black fur pressed between its pages. The book also contained a ''[[scroll of bestial communion]]'' that allowed a [[mage]] to scribe the ''[[sights of the Seelie: summon deva]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Content": "''Caution Before the Seelie'' was a collection of accounts of one unfortunate [[hin]] who, during a tour of the Beastlands, was forced into joining the [[Seelie Court]]. The book also collected lore on the Seelie Courts of summer, winter, and sarcastic [[octopus]]. However, the last one was not entirely accurate nor reliable.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the presumed original copy of ''Caution Before the Seelie'' was storred within a study, hidden by an illusory wall in the vaults of the ''[[Ramazith's tower]]'' of [[Baldur's Gate]], that at the time belonged to the [[Athkatla]]n mage of dubious morals [[Lorroakan]]."
