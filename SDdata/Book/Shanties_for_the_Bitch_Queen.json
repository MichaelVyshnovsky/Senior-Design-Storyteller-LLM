It contained three main shanties, one starting with \"And we all row!\", another with \"Wavemother, wavemother\", and the third with \"Souls aweigh and anchors still!\".\nAfter fishers of the Western Heartlands were attacked in the 15 century DR, this collection of verses lay on a wooden dock near the shore."
