"Waylaid" is a short story by Thomas M. Reid included in the 2004 anthology Realms of the Dragons. It features characters from a previous short story of Reids, "Lynaelle" in Realms of Mystery.
Lynaelle Dawnmantle is passing through Silverymoon Pass on the way to Silverymoon, where she hopes to join the Ladys College. She is kidnapped by the white dragon Torixileos, who presses her into his service. Back at his lair, Torixileos bids Lynaelle retrieve a wounded orc thief for him to feast on. When the orc turns out to be a juvenile silver dragon in disguise, Lynaelle realizes Torixileos is the actual thief, and that the lair is not his to begin with. The silver dragons mother, Symarra Brightmoon, arrives and chases off the white. It turns out Symarra is an old friend of Ambriel, Lynaelles mentor in the Art.
