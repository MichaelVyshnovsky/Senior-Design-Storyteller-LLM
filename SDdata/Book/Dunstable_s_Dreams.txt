'''''Dunstable's Dreams''''' was a renowned language reference book. Politely called ''Dreams'' and casually called ''Dunstable'', it was well-respected and much-referred to in the [[Heartlands]] of the [[Realms]].

==Description==
The book was only the size of a [[human]] hand, but was extremely thick. A newer edition came with sturdy leather slipcovers with four thong catches, intended to help protect the spine of the book from cracking so swiftly.

==Contents==
The book collected all sorts of useful and witty mottos, sayings, retorts, turns of phrase, and new words from all across [[Faer√ªn]], going back to the origins of the [[Common]] tongue.

==History==
''Dunstable's Dreams'' was very popular in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and regularly received new editions.
