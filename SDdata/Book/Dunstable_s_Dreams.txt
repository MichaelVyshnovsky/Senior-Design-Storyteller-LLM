Dunstables Dreams was a renowned language reference book. Politely called Dreams and casually called Dunstable, it was well-respected and much-referred to in the Heartlands of the Realms.
The book was only the size of a human hand, but was extremely thick. A newer edition came with sturdy leather slipcovers with four thong catches, intended to help protect the spine of the book from cracking so swiftly.
The book collected all sorts of useful and witty mottos, sayings, retorts, turns of phrase, and new words from all across Faer√ªn, going back to the origins of the Common tongue.
Dunstables Dreams was very popular in the 14 century DR, and regularly received new editions.
