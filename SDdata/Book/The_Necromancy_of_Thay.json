        "mainbody": "'''''The Necromancy of Thay''''' was a powerful [[arcanabula]] that held secrets regarding [[necromancy]], resurrection, and [[undeath]].\n\n{{Quote|It. Is. Not. Too. Late.}}",
        "Description": "The [[tome]] remained locked but had no notable keyhole. Rather it was opened by inserting a unique dark [[amethyst]] into the mouth of the cover's face.\n\nIt could not be destroyed by mundane or even [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] weapons, but rather had to be ignited by [[radiant energy]].",
        "Powers": "Anyone who dared to read the book felt immediate changed, granted an overwhelming surge of power and capability. The glyphs within contained some manner of intelligence that attempted to communicate with the reader.\n\nAs the reader continue to flip through its pages, they became wholly focused only the contents within ''The Necromancy of Thay''. Shadowy claws reached into their psyche, trying to pull to some unknown place. The reader would see \"time rewritten\" and \"fate undone\" as arcane [[rune]]s were inscribed within their very mind. \n\nIf they completed a full reading of ''Necromancy'', an individual was granted the ability to ''[[speak with dead]]'' once per day. Anyone who was resilient enough to complete the reading, but still initiated one, had their mind overwhelmed with profane knowledge and became more susceptible to attacks upon their psyche.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the tome remained within the secret lair of the [[Red Wizard]] [[Ilyn Toth]], which was hidden away beneath the ruined village of [[Moonhaven]]. Toth's hideaway was hidden behind a secret wall in the basement of the Moonhaven apothecary, secured behind a mirrored door with a spectral visage."
