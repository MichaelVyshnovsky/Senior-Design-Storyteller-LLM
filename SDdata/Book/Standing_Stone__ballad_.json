        "mainbody": "tanding Stone was an ancient elven melody that received masterfully crafted lyrics from the Harper bard Finder Wyvernspur.\nThe song was an upbeat, celebratory song about the Standing Stone, a famous landmark in the Dalelands that was erected to commemorate the alliance and peace between the inhabitants of the Dales and the elves of Cormanthor. The events sang about in the ditty predated the lyrical addition to the melody by thirteen centuries.\nStanding Stone was one of many songs, ballads, and poems created by a proud and arrogant Finder Wyvernspur. His uncanny talent and popularity eventually clouded his judgment, and he committed a terrible crime trying to preserve his body of work. His fellow Harpers held a tribunal and deemed him guilty. As a punishment, Harpers, with the aid of Elminster Aumar, removed Finders name, making him the Nameless Bard, and removed all memories and records of his work from the Realms. Finder himself was locked away in prison, the Citadel of White Exile on another plane.\nIn 1357 DR, Standing Stone returned to the realms with Alias, who was a construct daughter of the Nameless Bard. Her mind was created to be the perfect depository of the art created by Finder. Alias happily sang the forgotten song for the guest at the Old Skull Inn accompanied by the music of Olive Ruskettles yarting and Hans songhorn. The song was welcomed by thunderous applause. For everyone who listened, the song was a new and fresh take on a familiar melody. After the fact, both Han, the local Dalesman bard, and Olive received the lyrics and were free to spread the song throughout the inns of the region."
