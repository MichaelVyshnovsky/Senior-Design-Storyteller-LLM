Ruined Kingdoms is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory. It is part of the Al-Qadim campaign setting and set in Zakhara.
Ruined Kingdoms contains adventures set in long-lost Nog and Kadar. In these adventures, the player characters meet the gibbering beggar-prophet Adil, find a cursed ceramic disk, meet a pleasant mason wasp, fight yak folk, and run afoul of an ancient Arch-Geomancer. Traveling to the jungles of eastern Zakhara to solve the mystery of the disk, the PCs model for three giant sisters who sculpt topiary shrubs, fight serpent cultists, visit the Isle of the Elephant, and learn that one PC is the long-lost heir of a rich merchant family.
