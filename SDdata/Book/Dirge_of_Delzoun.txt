The '''''Dirge of Delzoun''''' was an epic [[dwarven]] ballad that told the grim tale of the [[shield dwarves]] of [[the North]]. It has never been translated from any language other than [[Dwarvish]] and was only known by a handful of [[dwarven]] [[bard]]s. Over the years, only a select few [[elves]] and [[human]]s had ever heard the song performed in its entirety, a feat that would would take almost thirty hours.

==Contents==
The ''Dirge of Delzoun'' recounted the rise of the Citadels in the [[Northdark]], to the shield dwarves' settling of the [[Silver Marches]]. Throughout the ballad, listeners were regaled with legendary tales of [[Delzoun]]'s most famous heroes,

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Emerus Warcrown|King Emerus Warcrown]] designated [[Ollyn Grimtongue]] as [[Citadel Felbarr]]'s "dirgekeeper," the sole dwarf who was granted permission to contribute to the dirge.
