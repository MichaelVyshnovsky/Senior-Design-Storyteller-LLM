'''''On Receiving Her Grace''''' was an instructional religious text associated with the worship of [[Loviatar]].
{{Quote|Be wary of your mortal limitations. While it is tempting to allow pain's ecstasies to sweep you away, particularly during a delicious bout of self-flagellation, broken bones hinder worship of Our Maiden of Pain.|Excerpt from ''On Receiving Her Grace''}}

==Description==
It was not unheard of for copies of the book to become stained or otherwise marked with blood.

==Content==
The book held instructions for faithful [[Loviatan]]s on how to properly—and with due reverence to the Lady—perform acts of self-torture. It pointed out that mortal bodies could withstand significant amounts of pain, but should not be scourged so that they became severely injured.

Its pages included numerous diagrams of [[humanoid]] forms contorted in horrifying ways, with large enough margins for copious note-taking.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Abdirak]], one of the Painmaden's devotees who dwelled in the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
