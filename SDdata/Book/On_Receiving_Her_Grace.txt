On Receiving Her Grace was an instructional religious text associated with the worship of Loviatar.
It was not unheard of for copies of the book to become stained or otherwise marked with blood.
The book held instructions for faithful Loviatans on how to properly—and with due reverence to the Lady—perform acts of self-torture. It pointed out that mortal bodies could withstand significant amounts of pain, but should not be scourged so that they became severely injured.
Its pages included numerous diagrams of humanoid forms contorted in horrifying ways, with large enough margins for copious note-taking.
