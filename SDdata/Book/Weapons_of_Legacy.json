        "mainbody": "'''''Weapons of Legacy''''' is an accessory for {{dnd}} 3.5{{th}}-edition. It introduces weapons that have histories and abilities matching their history, as well as rules governing such weapons in a campaign.\n\n{{Quote|'''''GREAT HEROES DEMAND LEGENDARY WEAPONS'''''\n\n''Some heroes find weapons of legacy, while others forge them. Unlike other magic items, a weapon of legacy gains new abilities as its wielder becomes more powerful. In the hands of a true hero, a simple sword might achieve fame and power as great as that of the dark blade Exordius, the wizard-hating Hammer of Witches, or the skull-shattering morningstar known as Mindsplinter.''\n\n''This supplement for the D&D game describes nearly 50 items of legacy. Each item has its own character, a detailed history, special wielder requirements, unique powers, and adventure seeds. Weapons of Legacy provides rules and tools for players and DMs to forge new items of legacy for their characters or campaigns, along with new legacy feats, spells, a prestige class, and psionic powers for characters interested in wielding mythic weapons and other items of power.''\n\n''To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. A player needs only the Player’s Handbook''}}",
