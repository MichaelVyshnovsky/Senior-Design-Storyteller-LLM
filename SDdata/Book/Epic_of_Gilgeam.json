        "mainbody": "century DR\nThe Epic of Gilgeam was an epic poem circulating Unther during the mid–14 century DR that described in detail the life of Gilgeam.\nThe Epic of Gilgeam was required by law to be taught in all schools within Unther. Given Gilgeams rising unpopularity during the mid–14 century DR, many satirical parodies of specific passages from the Epic sprung up all over Unther during this time."
