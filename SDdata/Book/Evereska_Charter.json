        "mainbody": "he Evereska Charter was a document that formalized the annexation of the Tomb Hills (shortly thereafter known as the Greycloak Hills) by the moon elves of Evereska. It was presented to the outside world in the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR, as a declaration rather than an agreement between peoples. The Charter addressed the problem of undead haunting the tombs in the hills, many of which were elven-related. It singled out banshees as creatures that needed to be put to rest, not just in the Tomb Hills but across the Western Heartlands and the North, and offered to assist in this endeavor. The remainder of the document declared that anyone who plundered tombs in the hills would face elven justice but did not define what constituted tomb robbing or what the punishment would be.\nNo one except audacious tomb raiders challenged the Evereska Charter after it was announced."
