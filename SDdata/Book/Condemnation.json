It is the third book in the [[War of the Spider Queen (novel series)|War of the Spider Queen]] series.\n\n{{Quote|''The forces aligned against [[Menzoberranzan]] begin to take shape, and the threat to [[drow]] civilization is more terrifying than anyone has yet imagined. From the impenetrable shadows of the [[Underdark]] to the remote corners of the no less unforgiving World Above, the path toward the secrets of [[Lolth]]'s silence is as unpredictable as it is deadly.''\n\n''Joined by two drow who might be the last survivors of [[Ched Nasad]], the explorers from Menzoberranzan have learned much, but for every answer they find, a thousand new questions arise. They must seek out a rival priest, in hopes that he can speed them on their way to the goddess herself, but can one dark elf ever trust another?''}}",
        "Summary": "The group of drow adventurers -- [[Quenthel Baenre]], [[Pharaun Mizzrym]], [[Jeggred Baenre]], [[Halisstra Melarn]], [[Danifae Yauntyrr]], [[Ryld Argith]], and [[Valas Hune]] -- are continuing to seek answers for [[Silence of Lolth]]. Escaping through a portal from the fall of Ched Nasad, they wind up in the ruins of the [[Netherese]] city [[Hlaungadath]] in [[Anauroch]]. They commit to seeking help from another [[god]] by contacting Valas's acquaintance [[Tzirik]], a [[priest]] of [[Vhaeraun]], whom Valas last saw in the the [[Labyrinth]] in the [[Northdark]]. Pharaun is able to [[shadow walk]] the group there, but they find that [[House Jaelre]] has left for the surface.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Nimor Imphraezl]] and the drow princes of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] are plotting the downfall of Menzoberranzan, just as they had facilitated the fall of Ched Nasad. Nimor first approaches the King [[Horgar Steelshadow]] of the [[duergar]] city [[Gracklstugh]], promising him a way to defeat the drow. His plan includes uniting multiple allies, namely [[House Agrach Dyrr]] to have them turn on their fellow drow, and the untrustworthy [[cambion|half-demon]] warlord [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and his [[tanarukk]] army. \n\nAs part of Nimor's plot, the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]], [[Gromph Baenre]], is approached by [[Lich]]drow [[Lord Dyrr]]. When Gromph refuses to join with Dyrr in a coup against the matriarchy of Menzoberranzan, Dyrr banishes him to an unknown location. After his disappearance, the city's wizards are distracted by their attempts to determine who will be the next archmage; [[Matron Mother]] [[Triel Baenre]] orders the wizard [[Nauzhror Baenre]] to support a candidate from [[House Xorlarrin]] or House Agrach Dyrr in order to solidify an alliance.\n\nQuenthel's group take a portal from the Labyrinth to [[Cormanthor]] and, with the help of a spell cast by Pharaun, are able to determine in which direction to travel to find House Jaelre and Tzirik. Along the way, they are attacked by the forces of [[Elventree]]. Halisstra is captured, but the others escape and make it to [[Minauthkeep]], the home House Jaelre. They solicit Tzirik's help to contact his god to find out what has happened to Lolth, but he first insists that they help [[Jezz the Lame]] retrieve ''[[Geildirion of Cimbar]]'' book from the lair of a [[beholder]] in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. Once the book is obtained, Tzirik reveals that he has learned Lolth is alive but not speaking or leaving her temple in the [[Demonweb Pits]]. Meanwhile, Halisstra escape her captor, the Lord [[Dessaer]], by killing [[Seyll Auzkovyn]] when the [[Eilistraee]]an priestess attempts to convert her.\n\nBack in the Underdark, Nimor, posing as \"Captain Zheyemd\" of House Agrach Dyrr, leads Menzoberranzan's [[Army of the Black Spider]] to a trap at the [[Pillars of Woe]]. They are ambushed by the duergar army and Vhok's forces, and they are betrayed by the soldiers of Agrach Dyrr. A quarter to a third of the drow army is lost before Triel Baenre learns of the tide of battle and sends [[House Baenre]] forces to rescue them. The army retreats to Menzoberranzan in preparation for a siege, while the opposing armies pursue them.\n\nQuenthel's group decide to take up Tzirik's offer to take their souls directly to the Demonweb Pits via [[astral projection]] to seek Lolth themselves. Once there, Lolth does not respond to any of their entreaties. Tzirik opens a gate and brings his own god, Vhaeraun directly into the domain of Lolth, where he attempts to slay the goddess. [[Selvetarm]] interferes and drags himself and Vhaeraun to the bottom of the Pits. Quenthel's group fights Tzirik in an attempt to save Lolth and escape, but are only successful when Jeggred, who was left behind to guard their bodies, slays Tzirik. However, their faith in Lolth -- particularly Halisstra's -- has been badly shaken.",
