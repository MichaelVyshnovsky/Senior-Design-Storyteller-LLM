A group of Red Wizards of Thay have constructed a base that contains a quartet of netherese portals that each lead to powerful elemental nodes. In order to access the power of those nodes, they need the portal keys. A Red Wizard managed to acquire one of the keys by attacking the Floshin Estates but was caught and executed in Daggerford after he passed the key on to an agent.
Sir Isteval, a retired paladin from Cormyr, hires a group of adventurers to go on a series of quests that result in acquiring the remaining three keys, taking the group to locations such as the Lizard Marsh and Mount Illefarn before engaging in a climactic battle in the ruins of Dragonspear Castle with vengeful red wizards and the rakshasa who has been manipulating events.
