'''''Fires of Zatal''''' is an adventure module for 2nd-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', set in the [[Maztica Campaign Set|Maztica]] setting of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.

{{Quote|''On the Night of Wailing, when the creatures of Viperhand come to life, when the great Maztican gods [[Qotal]] and [[Zaltec]] battled, the great Cloak of One Plume - a magical item of great power and a token of great authority - was believed lost forever.''

''Such was not the case.''

''Rumors fly that the Cloak was rescued that night, and hidden away in a safe location. Now a petty noble of New Amn plans to recover it, and is looking for brave young souls who can bring it back to him. But other players are invovled in the chase, trying to recover the lost Cloak.''

Fires of Zatal ''spans the great continent of [[Maztica]] from the new colony of [[Helmsport]] to the Valley of [[Nexal]], at the foot of Mt. Zatal itself. It is the first adventure for the new'' Maztica ''campaign setting in the Realms; DMs wishing to run this need the ''[[Maztica Campaign Set|Maztica ''Campaign Boxed Set'']]''. This module serves as an introduction to this new world of adventure, a land of wise and savage empires and growing, monstrous threats.''

''Welcome to Maztica. This is not the Realms you're familiar with!''}}
