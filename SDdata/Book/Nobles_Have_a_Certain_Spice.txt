'''''Nobles Have a Certain Spice''''' was a [[bard]] ballad by an anonymous minstrel was became popular in [[1254 DR]].

==Description==
''Nobles Have a Certain Spice'' was a song of somewhat gruesome nature and social commentary about a noblewoman being hunted by [[wolves]] in a forest.

{{Quote|''In forest deep''<br />''A fair lady''<br />''Her secrets keep''<br />''Though wolves dare''<br />''To hunt her down''<br />''To have her life''<br />''To taste the crown''<br />''Nobles have a certain spice.''}}

==History==
Even though the song was popularized in the Year of Silent Steel, the ballad's story came true, in a way, a century later. In [[1348 DR]], a young [[ranger]] [[Florin Falconhand]] hatched a plan to teach an unbearably draconic and rude noblewoman of [[House Crownsilver]], [[Narantha Crownsilver]] a lesson by scaring her, chase her into the woods and then "rescue," in attempts to change her attitude for the better.
