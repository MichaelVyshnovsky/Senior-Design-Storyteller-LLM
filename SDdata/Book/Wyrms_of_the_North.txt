Wyrms of the North was a column by Ed Greenwood published in Dragon magazine. The series debuted in June 1996 (Dragon #230) and ended in May 1999 (Dragon #259), and later reprinted on the Wizards of the Coast website.
Despite the title of the series, the articles covered famous dragons from across western Faer√ªn, along the Sword Coast from Icewind Dale to Calimshan. They offered a detailed look into the lore, actions, abilities, magic and other topics on each dragon.
