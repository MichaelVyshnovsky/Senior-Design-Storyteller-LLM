{{quote|''And when at last Prince Rarvarrick came to the Dread Door and struck mightily with his fist upon it, setting up a great storm of boomings and crashings, a tiny door within the door did open, and out from it thrust a head with no body, that floated in the air where most severed heads would have fallen, and spake unto him: "Thou art too late by a night, puissant prince. For, behold: the foe you seek hath flown. I am bid to say unto you: 'Trouble Travels North.' Make of this what you will, for being but a lonely head with no body, all that befalls is as one to me."''|An excerpt from ''The Roisterings of Bold Prince Rarvarrick''}}
