Hambras Horncall was a periodical chapbook published in the city of Alaghôn of Turmish.
Unlike any other chapbooks, Hambras Horncall did not engage in gossip-mongering and offered information on cultural events of Alaghôn. The publication put out public service announcements, and its reviews were more neutral in tone. Many locals suspected that Hambras Horncall was used by shady underground groups to pass along coded messages disguised as public announcements. Despite it being true, there was little evidence proving it.
