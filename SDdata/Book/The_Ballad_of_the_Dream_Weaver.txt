The Ballad of the Dream Weaver was a famous and popular ballad composed by the bard Talanthe Truesilver in the early 14 century DR.
Used to start and finish the ballad, the refrain ran as follows
Later, female minstrels typically sang "proud lord, laughing lord," but Talanthe used the original "proud lady, laughing lady." 
In the middle, minstrels weaved in their own verses, singing of their favorite legends, strange sightings, hidden treasures, and secrets and intrigues. This led to many variations and personal versions, but the refrain remained the same and was famed across Faerûn.
The ballad was sung slowly, with the words drawn out. Elminster suggested it was similar in mood and tone, though not the actual tune, to a Celtic song of Earth called Dawn of the Day.
Minstrels typically sang The Ballad of the Dream Weaver in the middle or at the close of their performances. They used it as a way to compile and share recent rumors theyd heard.
In the late 1320s DR, then a young half-elf bard, Talanthe visited an obscure and ramshackle tavern in Secomber named the Stag. One night in the taproom, she performed a ballad of her own composition, The Ballad of the Dream Weaver. For some reason, it proved to be popular, becoming one of the most well-known and widely played ballads in Faerûn by the 1360s DR, with many variations. The Stag was renamed The Seven-Stringed Harp to take advantage of its reputation of being where The Ballad of the Dream Weaver was first heard.
By the late 15 century DR, the book simply titled Sword Coast Songbook became available in the city of Baldurs Gate. It collected the sheet music and lyrics of The Ballad of the Dream Weaver, among other musical works, all compiled by Silke Rosena, a bard of Beregost.
