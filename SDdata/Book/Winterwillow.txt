Winterwillow was an instrumental musical composition with no lyrics penned sometime before the early 14 century DR.
Winterwillow was one of many songs, ballads, and musical compositions in Mintiper Moonsilvers repertoire. The Company of Crazed Venturers was present at the famed bard Mintipers performance in Neverwinter sometime in the early-to-mid 14 century DR, during which he performed several songs, including Winterwillow.
