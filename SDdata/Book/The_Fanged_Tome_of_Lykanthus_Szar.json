        "History": "As of [[1374 DR]], it was among the treasures kept within [[Blackstaff Tower]] in [[Waterdeep]], somewhere between the second floor and the ground floor. It was one that [[Tsarra Chaadren]] remembered passing often while studying there.\n\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]], the corpse of the [[Uthgardt]] [[Elk tribe]] warrior [[Ven Salafin]], slain at the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] ''circa'' [[1400 DR]] and briefly revived via ''[[speak with dead]]'', was asked by [[Edgin Darvis]] what his favorite book was. He was indecisive, but for what he considered historical works he answered with ''The Fanged Tome of Lykanthus Szar''<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} or ''[[Galadaster's Orizon]]''."
