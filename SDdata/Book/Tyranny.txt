'''Tyranny''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

==Plot==
High Lord [[Kalahar Twohands]] orders the party to immediately return to the [[Fortress of the Eternal Despot]] from which they have only recently arrived back. New research suggests that a powerful artifact of evil lies underneath the structure and must be retrieved before [[Bane]]'s clergy gets their hands on it.

{{quote|"Bane's power knows no borders." Or so his servants claim. It is a frightening thought. The Lord of Tyrants seeks to extend his dominion over the Delimbiyr Vale and the caverns below; and, as we found out, over both the living and the dead.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}
