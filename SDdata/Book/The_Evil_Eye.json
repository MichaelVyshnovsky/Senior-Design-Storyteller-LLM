        "mainbody": "he Evil Eye was a book dedicated to the story of various types of hags and dangers of dealing with them, published sometime before 1492 DR.\nThe cover of the Evil Eye tome was decorated with an eery etched depiction of eyes that appeared to blink when stared at long enough.\nThe book discussed the practices of hags and their preference for individual and unique magical trinkets and bargains they stroke with mortals. Hags liked to be different from their sisters. Next, the book separated hags into only three groups night hags, sea hags, and green hags. The night hags were described as creatures that predated on victims dreams, slowly consuming their essences, and, eventually, trapping the mortals souls in their soul bags. The tome noted that night hags were known to be petty and selfish. Sea hags, on the other hand, feasted on their victims flesh and they were known to paralyze their victims with a mere glance. The Evil Eye attributed foul appearance and old fish stench to these hags and claimed that they were incapable of even brewing a simple cup of tea. Lastly, the book claimed that green hags were beautiful, powerful, and warned the reader not to speak ill of them.\nCirca , copies of the Evil Eye could be found in the Western Heartlands."
