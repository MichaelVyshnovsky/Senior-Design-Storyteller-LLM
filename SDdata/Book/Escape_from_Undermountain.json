Its subterranean byways are home to all manner of creatures, human and otherwise.''\n\n''When [[Artek Ar'talen|Artek the Knife]] is offered release from prison in exchange for one small errand, he leaps at the chance. All he must do is retrieve one missing nobleman from the twisting corridors of the dungeon that lies beneath the city.''\n\n''Accompanied by comely but klutzy [[Beckla Shadesar|Beckla]], a small-time wizard who may not be exactly what she claims to be, Artek must go deeper into [[Undermountain]] than anyone else has gone before.''\n\n''Getting in will be the hardest thing he's ever done. Getting out will be impossible...''}}",
