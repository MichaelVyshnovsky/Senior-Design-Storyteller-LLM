'''''The Dessarin River''''' was the book that collected historic information about the [[River Dessarin]], popular ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
The book recorded the history of River Dessarin dating back to the time when [[Waterdeep]] was young and the river itself was called the "Road to the North" due to it stretching through [[Evermoors]] and up the [[Spine of the World]]. The bountiful and fertile lands of the Dessarin's delta supported the northern people's first settlements, long before any other settlements of the [[Savage Frontier]] were settled. Historically, the delta and the river itself supported farming and mining communities that grew along its shores.

The historic danger to the settlements along the Dessarin River were [[orc]] hordes that swooped down the stream from the north every decade or so.

Another old and artistic name given to the Dessarin River was "a sword that thrust up into the heart of the North." That was shortened to the more common name given to it in the past, the Sword. The Sword was also the name given to Dessarin River in the [[Netherese]] times.

==History==
In midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''The Dessarin River'' could be found in the city of Daggerford, notably in the city's open library within [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]].
