or early The date of Test of the Samurai is unknown as page 5 only says "1770- Current time." on the Wa Calendar, which gives it a large range. The previous adventure, Ronin Challenge, is also undated, but is limited by the events of Dragonwall to late 1358 DR or early 1359 DR. Since Ronin connects directly to Samurai, this must be similarly dated. In any case, the majority of Kara-Tur sources are set in 1357â€“1359 DR, so Test should be too.
Test of the Samurai is an adventure module by Rick Swan for the Kara-Tur campaign setting and published in 1990. Using the 2-edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset, it is intended for up to 9 player-characters of levels 6 to 9. The module follows on from Ronin Challenge, but has an independent storyline set in Wa.
