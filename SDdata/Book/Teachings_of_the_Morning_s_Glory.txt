The '''''Teachings of the Morning's Glory''''' was a holy text of four volumes, penned by [[Thorndar Erlin]], the High Priest of [[Lathander]] in [[20 DR]].

{{quote|''Know that the purpose of families, in the eyes of the Morninglord at least, is to make each generation a little better than the one before: stronger, perhaps, or wiser; richer, or more capable. Some folk manage one of these aims; the best and the most fortunate manage more than one. That is the task of parents. The task of a ruler is to make, or keep, a realm that allows most of its subjects to see better in their striving, down the generations, than a single improvement.''|Excerpt from the ''Teachings of the Morning's Glory''}}

This [[Lathanderite]] work was created in the early 1{{st}} century DR. The [[book]]'s author, High Priest Erlin, talked about the importance of family for the Morninglord's faithful, improving the family's well-being from one generation to the next. In the same manner, the ''Teachings'' stated that the leader of a realm is responsible for improving the lives of its inhabitants with each passing generation.

By the late-14{{th}} century DR,a copy of the ''Teachings of the Morning's Glory'' was preserved in the library stronghold of [[Candlekeep]].{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|5}}
