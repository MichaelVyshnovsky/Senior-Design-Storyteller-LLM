'''''The Curse of the Vampyr''''' was an old [[book]] that collected lore on the topic of [[vampire]]s, published before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''...And if the Beast finds a way into your home, flee. Leave love and family behind. You will not save them if you fight. You
will not see them again. But they will see you, pale and smiling, calling them into the night.''|Excerpt from ''The Curse of the Vampyr''}}

==Description==
These tomes were bound in a light green cover, inscribed with countless ''[[holy symbol]]'', some well-known and some long-forgotten. ''The Curse of the Vampyr'' was printed on [[paper]], yellowed and cracked with age.

==Contents==
''The Curse of the Vampyr'' was written in flowery and unfashionably archaic words. The tome talked about how dangerous vampires could be with their cold beauty and deceiving charm. The book stipulated that pale-skinned nobles of unearthly charm were dangerous undead creatures, as no vampire could bear a commoner's existence.

As to how ''The Curse of the Vampyr'' advised the readers to protect themselves from the bloodsucking undead, it simply claimed that avoiding being outside on the blackest night was protection enough. It also claimed that the light of [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]] could offer some semblance of safety. The greatest protection, however, was one's home.

Lastly, the book offered a piece of advice on how to spot a vampire: cold flesh, pale skin, bite marks on the neck, clothes soiled with grave dirt.
