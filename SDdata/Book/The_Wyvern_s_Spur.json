The [[Wyvernspur family]]'s powerful heirloom has been stolen, and the grand wizard and patriarch [[Drone Wyvernspur]] is the first to fall to the ancient item's [[curse]]. The family fool, [[Giogioni Wyvernspur|Giogi]], is left to find it, but even recovering the spur cannot guarantee his clan's safety.''\n\n''Fortunately, the famous halfling bard [[Olive Ruskettle]] and a mysterious and talented mage named [[Cat (person)|Cat]] are determined to help. But when betrayal and enchantment threaten Giogi's progress, he must invoke the spur's awesome might... or become its next victim!''}}",
        "Summary": "The novel begins on 19 [[Ches]], [[1358 DR]]. Flattery Wyvernspur sends his apprentice Cat, a twin of Alias, to steal the Wyvernâ€™s Spur from the crypt where it is kept, but Drone sends Jade More, another twin, who takes it first. Flattery sends a wraith to recover it, and Drone fakes his death. The spur falls into the possession of Olive Rustkettle, who eventually gives it to Giogi Wyvernspur, who defeats Flattery with the help of Olive, Drone, and Cat.\n{{sectstub}}",
