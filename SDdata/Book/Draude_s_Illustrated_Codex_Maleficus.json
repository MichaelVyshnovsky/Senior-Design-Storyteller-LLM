        "mainbody": "'''''Draude's Illustrated Codex Maleficus''''' was an evil and forbidden [[book]] from the old days of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "Like other forbidden tomes from Myth Drannor, ''Draude's Illustrated Codex Maleficus'' was a heavy tome bound in [[iron]]. It was wrapped in fabric and locked with iron [[chain]]s. When opened, the tome was filled with disgusting and dark illustrations.",
        "Powers": "This book was imbued with vile and evil [[enchantment]]s. This magic allowed the owner of the book to cast the ''[[repulsion]]'' spell four times a day and increased their reaction in battle. However this power came at a price as the ''Codex Maleficus'' drained constitution from its wielder as long as it remained in their possession.",
        "History": "The ''Illustrated Codex Maleficus'' was locked away inside a long-abandoned [[wizard]]'s laboratory in the First Cellar of the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The book was bound and chained to be destroyed but with the advent of the [[Weeping War]], the evil tome was left behind in the ruined city. In [[1369 DR]], the book still lay within the hidden lab."
