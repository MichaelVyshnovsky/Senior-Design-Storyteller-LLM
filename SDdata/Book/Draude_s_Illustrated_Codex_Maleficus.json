        "mainbody": "raudes Illustrated Codex Maleficus was an evil and forbidden book from the old days of Myth Drannor.\nLike other forbidden tomes from Myth Drannor, Draudes Illustrated Codex Maleficus was a heavy tome bound in iron. It was wrapped in fabric and locked with iron chains. When opened, the tome was filled with disgusting and dark illustrations.\nThis book was imbued with vile and evil enchantments. This magic allowed the owner of the book to cast the repulsion spell four times a day and increased their reaction in battle. However this power came at a price as the Codex Maleficus drained constitution from its wielder as long as it remained in their possession.\nThe Illustrated Codex Maleficus was locked away inside a long-abandoned wizards laboratory in the First Cellar of the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. The book was bound and chained to be destroyed but with the advent of the Weeping War, the evil tome was left behind in the ruined city. In 1369 DR, the book still lay within the hidden lab."
