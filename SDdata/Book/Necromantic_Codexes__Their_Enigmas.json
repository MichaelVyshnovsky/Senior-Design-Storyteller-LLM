        "mainbody": "'''''Necromantic Codexes, Their Enigmas''''' was a scholarly treatise that recorded information on rare and obscure [[book]]s of [[necromancy]], penned sometime before [[1367 DR]].",
        "History": "''Necromantic Codexes'' once was contained in a library of the [[High Heralds]] within the [[Moonrise Towers]]. The book bore stamps of those who read the tome because of its content â€“ lore about necromantic tomes, their magic locks, and information on deciphering them. One stamp was of note. The book was once requested by a [[Red Wizard]] \"researcher\" [[Ilyn Toth]] in his search for the secrets of ''[[The Necromancy of Thay]]''. The librarian denied the request as Toth's interest seemed to be more than just casual research. The librarian also noted that ''Necromantic Codexes'' did not have information on ''The Necromancy of Thay'' and instead, the needed ''[[Tharchiate Codex]]''."
