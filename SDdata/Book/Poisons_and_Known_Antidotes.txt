'''Poisons and Known Antidotes''' was a book cataloging poisons and antidotes published before [[1269 DR]].

==History==

A copy of this book was found in the [[Accursed Tower]] of [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1369 DR]] by adventurers searching for the ''[[Diary of Damien Morienus]]''. The book was hidden in the secret treasure room inside the tower's library. That copy of ''Poisons and Known Antidotes'' was turned into a trap for greedy looters. The insides of the book were hollow with a [[giant spider]] hiding inside in temporal stasis. Once the book was opened the spider was enlarged and animated to attack the thieves.
