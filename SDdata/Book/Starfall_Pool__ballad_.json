        "mainbody": "'''''Starfall Pool''''' was a ballad by an unknown composer about the [[Starfall Pool|glade]] and [[Starfall Pool (pond)|pond]] of the same name located north of [[Silverymoon]] just past the edge of the [[Moonwood]]. It described a place of restful healing, a dancing [[dryad]], and strange dreams. This song was famous throughout [[Luruar]] by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite dragon/296/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Starfall Pool|74}}",
        "Contents": "The ballad was long, and there were many versions. It usually went on to describe the healing of mind and body or meeting fair folk, [[humans]] and [[half-elves]], in deep dreams of joyous recreation, courtship, or humorous exploits, but other versions hinted at dark magic with a [[siren]]'s lure, or an evil [[wizard]] that threatened the glade or the dryad. But each verse was followed by the well-known refrain:\n{{Quote|\nThere is a place in the deep green wood<br />\nWhere the dryad [[Olsheirie]] dwells<br />\nDancing where a keep once stood<br />\nGirt with magic of chiming bells.<br />\n<br />Refrain:<br />\nThough to stray so deep is the act of a fool<br />\nI regret no stride toward Starfall Pool.<br />\n<br />\nCame I there by happy chance<br />\nAnd there I'll thither go again<br />\nTo dream more dreams of fair romance<br />\nFor by the pool I know no pain.<br />\n<br />(Refrain)<br /><br />\nTrees old and green, dark and still<br />\nRing 'round an oak as old as time<br />\nFall down keep and rise up hill<br />\nRest and hear the dryad rhyme.<br />\n<br />(Refrain)<br /><br />\nKindled by the dying embers<br />\nOf a fire that must not stay<br />\nMagic soars and then remembers<br />\nWarding me again away.<br />\n<br />(Refrain)<br /><br />\nBack I'll go when I am able<br />\nThough long rides may lie between<br />\nPeace again upon my table<br />\nLying on the moss so green.\n|From \"Starfall Pool\"}}"
