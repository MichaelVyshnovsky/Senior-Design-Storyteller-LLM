        "mainbody": "De Hursts Diary was the personal journal of the cleric of Mystra and arcane scholar, Lenore De Hurst. It was written for a period of years during the late 15 century DR.\nThe diary contained the personal thoughts and musings that De Hurst believed relevant enough to scribe during their three-year expedition into the Underdark. It was kept separate from De Hursts research work, which was focused on the study of sussur trees and their use in the creation of magical items and use as a source of power.\nIt was scribed in De Hursts distinct cursive script in silver ink."
