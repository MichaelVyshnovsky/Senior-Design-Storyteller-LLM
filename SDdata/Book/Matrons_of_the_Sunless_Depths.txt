Matrons of the Sunless Depths was a treatise by the drow priestess Vlonwelv Auvryndar.
Written in Elvish, the book discussed the importance of matriarchy in drow society. It was not considered a particularly valuable piece.
As of the late 15 century DR, a copy could be found in the guest quarters of Vlonwelvs base in the Muirals Gauntlet section of Undermountain.
