Myconid Song was a song included in the book Folksongs of Faerûn.
The author Folksongs of Faerûn lamented to Oghma, the deity of the bards and scholars, that they knew the specifics of the song but could not accurately transcribe it for others. The song was not inscribed using traditional writing but rather twisting arcs of color.
