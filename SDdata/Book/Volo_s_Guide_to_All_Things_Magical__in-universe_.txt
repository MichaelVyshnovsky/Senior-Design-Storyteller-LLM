Volos Guide to All Things Magical was a pamphlet written by Volothamp Geddarm early in 1358 DR.
Printed on vellum, and a grab-bag full of odds and ends about magic.
Several powerful mages, including Elminster, All copies were hunted down and destroyed. 
The initial pamphlet, "Volos Guide to All Things Magical", was first published early in the . Notoriously, it included a great many spells that had been thought long forgotten and exposed these to folk across Faer√ªn. Several mighty mages, who would rather these spells had stayed forgotten, confronted Volo over this. In response, Volo switched his focus from writing books of magic to writing travelogues. Nevertheless, the spells remained known to the magical community, and even entered common use.
In the , a second pamphlet of the same name was released.
