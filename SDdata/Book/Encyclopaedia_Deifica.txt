Encyclopaedia Deifica Tales of Divinities, Both Living and Dead, Extracted Through Studious Cross-Faith Comparison and Revealed By the Hand of Oghma was a set of books written by Jenelle Einhorn, an acolyte at the Leaves of Learning temple of Oghma in Highmoon. It detailed a range of gods and goddesses of various pantheons.
It was written after the Godswar of 1358 DR, and had an edition printed in 1370 DR. This had a "somewhat rambling" introduction summarizing the overall history of Faer√ªn, mentioning the creator races and arrivals of other races, and describing the nature of the deities of Abeir-Toril.
