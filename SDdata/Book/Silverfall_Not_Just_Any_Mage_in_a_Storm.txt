Not Just Any Mage in a Storm is a novella by Ed Greenwood first published in the 1999 anthology Silverfall.
Maervidal Iloster, a scribe and Harper agent in Shadowdale, has been discovered by the Zhentarim and fears for his life. He encounters Storm Silverhand, explaining his situation. They swap appearances, and Storm allows herself to be captured. While seemingly captured, Syluné contacts her and instructs her to track down Halaster Blackcloak, the mage seemingly behind the conspiracy. Storm wipes out the Zhentarim with the help of local Harpers, sparing only Taerach Thone, a Zhent assassin she discovers is the secret author of the Heartsteel books, a series enjoyed by her and Syluné. Storm confronts Halaster, learning that he has been corrupted by Shar in an effort to claim some of Mystra’s silver fire. Storm is injured but frees Halaster’s mind, although she is nearly killed. Dauntless and Mirt teleport in, confronting Auvrarn Labraster as he has been taken over by the power of Shar, but Elaith Craulnobur arrives and kills him. The other Sisters and Elminster arrive along with Thone arrive and save Storm. Qilué kisses Elaith.
