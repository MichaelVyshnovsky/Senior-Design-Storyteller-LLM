A Guide to Avernus - One Hellish Holiday was a guidebook dedicated to Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells, penned for planeswalkers sometime before the late 15 century DR.
The overview of Avernus included information on the planes geography and a primer on its inhabitants, and their involvement in the endless Blood War. The politics section of the book was a collection of asterisks, addendums, and corrections on the fluid and chaotic chain of command under the Archduke of Avernus, Zariel.
