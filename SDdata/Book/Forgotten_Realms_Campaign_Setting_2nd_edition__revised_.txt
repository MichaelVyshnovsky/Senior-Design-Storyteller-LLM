The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons boxed set for the Forgotten Realms.
This boxed set is designed to immerse players and Dungeon Masters in the Realms. The set includes several booklets that provide an in-depth look at the Realms. These booklets cover a wide range of topics, including the history, geography, politics, and cultures of the various regions within the Realms.
It contains detailed information on the various organizations, factions, and guilds within the Realms, including their hierarchies, goals, and roles in the world. It also includes profiles of key non-player characters and deities that play significant roles in the Realms, complete with their backgrounds and motivations.
This is the revised version of the original boxed second edition campaign setting, which was originally released in 1993.  This boxed set depicts Elminster Aumar on top of a rock on the cover.
