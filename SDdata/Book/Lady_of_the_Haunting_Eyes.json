        "mainbody": "century DR\nLady of the Haunting Eyes was a ballad dedicated to the famed courtesan named Joysarra of Zazesspur, penned by Ronsil Haeladtongue, a minstrel from the same city, some time in or before the 14 century DR.\nLady of the Haunting Eyes was titled after Joysarras nickname. As the case was with many courtesans, those whose fame grew to inspire ballads were already gone by the time the fame put their names on the lips of bards and minstrels. The titular Lady of the Haunting Eyes was dead by the late 14 century DR."
