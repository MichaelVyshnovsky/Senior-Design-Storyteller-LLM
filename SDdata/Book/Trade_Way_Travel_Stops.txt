'''''Trade Way Travel Stops''''', also known by its full name, '''''Trade Way Travel Stops: A Visitor's Guide to the Trade Way South of Daggerford''''', was a guidebook dedicated to the points of interest along the [[Trade Way]] to the south from [[Daggerford]] popular ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
''Trade Way Travel Stops'' was written in a personal and casual style similar to that popularized by [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. The guide told travelers who've experienced everything Daggerford had to offer about all nearby locations along the Trade Way that held more adventures.

The first stop past the city's Caravan Gate was about half-day's travel away from Daggerford. The hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]] was a charming destination founded as the base for guards and law enforcement that kept the Trade Way safe. The book talked about how the hamlet was a small trading hub and was famous for its curio shop, [[Torleth's Treasures]], historical [[Gillian's Hill Cemetery]], and old [[Gillian's Tower]] that was the town's namesake and once the home of the [[ranger]] [[Gillian Cantilar]].

The next stop further down on the guide's list was [[Liam's Hold]], another half-day's travel away. The town was known for its comfortable and welcoming [[Holdfast Inn]], and good protection from the nearby [[Trollbark Forest]]. The town was considered to be old-fashioned and agricultural, and its inhabitants' superstitions gave it a certain charm.

''Trade Way Travel Stops'' recommended not to travel further south past Liam's Hold without the protection of a well-guarded caravan.

==History==
In midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], t''Trade Way Travel Stops'' could be found in the city of Daggerford, notably in the city's open library within [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]].
