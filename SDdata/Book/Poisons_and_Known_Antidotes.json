The book was hidden in the secret treasure room inside the towers library. That copy of Poisons and Known Antidotes was turned into a trap for greedy looters. The insides of the book were hollow with a giant spider hiding inside in temporal stasis. Once the book was opened the spider was enlarged and animated to attack the thieves."
