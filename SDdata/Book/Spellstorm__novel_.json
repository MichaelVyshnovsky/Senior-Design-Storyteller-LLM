Found by some magic-less merchant, rumor has it the Lost Spell is to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.''\n \n''It is a powerful lure, and [[archwizard]]s of every stripe descend upon the merchant, only to be trapped with him inside his manor by a vicious [[spellstorm]]—escape impossible, and their magic useless with the interference from the storm. ''\n\n''Moreover—they find themselves faced with the infamous [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], who claims he's just there to decide who gets the Lost Spell, but who clearly has an agenda of his own.''\n \n''But before Elminster can put whatever plan he has in motion, archwizards start dying.''}}",
