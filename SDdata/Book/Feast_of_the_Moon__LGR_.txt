'''Feast of the Moon''' is an adventure module from the RPGA [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] campaign.

==Plot==
It is the [[Feast of the Moon]] and [[Waterdeep]] is full of happy revelers. In a house at the end of Dretch Lane, the partygoers find themselves being killed off, but the deaths appear to be due to drowning.

{{Quote|I believe Mielikki had a hand in the events that Moonfest night. How else could a seemingly random choice made on a dark street in Waterdeep led to the recovery of the Coalescence of Scorn and the revelation of the true threat to Loudwater.|[[Teseryne Truesilver]]}}
