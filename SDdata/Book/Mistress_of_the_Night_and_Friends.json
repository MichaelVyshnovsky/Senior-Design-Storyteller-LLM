        "mainbody": "Mistress of the Night and Friends was a collection of short stories, written for children, that promoted the Sharran faith. It was published some time during or before 1492 DR.\nOne story in Mistress of the Night told the tale of a beautiful woman who was courted by folks from all across the lands. Her mother worried for a time that she would never find true joy and happiness. But tragedy struck and the womans mother died.\nThe beautiful woman was entirely distraught. Her joy and charm were stripped away as she became overwhelmed with grief and sorrow. It was then that the goddess Shar spoke to her. Shar told the woman that only she truly loved her, no matter the sorrow she carried.\nShar instructed the woman to carry a specific vial and drop it into a well that served a local community. When folks drank from the well, they became sick and eventually died. Nevertheless, the woman maintained her love for Shar.\nPeople from across the realm visited the woman once again. They did not visit because of her beauty or her charm, but because she was Shars High Priestess and her word was indisputable.\nAs of the , one copy of Mistress of the Night and Friends remained in the possession Auntie Ethel, the hag of the Sunlit Wetlands."
