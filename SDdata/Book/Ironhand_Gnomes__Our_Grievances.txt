Ironhand Gnomes Our Grievances was a book of accords dedicated to the Ironhand gnomish clan of Baldurs Gate and their mistreatments in the late 15 century DR.
The book talked about the conflicts between the gnomes of the Ironhand clan, who worshiped Gaerdal Ironhand, and the Church of Gond, with its House of Wonder crafters and artificers. The Ironhand gnomes had spent generations in the workshops of Baldurs Gate, creating works of artifice famed for their precision and beauty, all while other city craftsmen ran crude workshops that produced unsophisticated imitations. However, unwisely, generous gnomes shared their methods with outsiders. As the tome stated, because of that, many of the Ironhand gnomes inventions were credited to the thief-god Gonds servants.
Gaerdal Ironhand spoke to Wolverforce Bongle "Suffer not these Gondians to steal thy livelihoods." The Ironhand gnomes openly criticized the poor craftsmanship. In retaliation, the Church of Gond began defending itself by slandering the Ironhand clan. Subsequently, Wolverforce Bongle became consumed by anger and perished in the Unfortunate Runepowder Incident. In its wake, the city and the Flaming Fist drove the Ironhand gnomes into exile.
In the , a copy of Ironhand Gnomes Our Grievances belonged to Gyldro Angleiron, the blacksmith proprietor of the Rivington General shop in the Rivington district of Baldurs Gate.
