Swordstar was a popular mystical fortune-telling book in the Heartlands of the Realms.
Swordstar was a small, thin book easily held in a pocket.
The book contained a single, cryptic verse on each page, with the page also bordered by random numbers. The reader was intended to cast dice or pebbles to derive meaningful numbers and so be guided to the correct piece of mystical advice. Verses included "Seek stone, calm thought, and fire’s spark", "Much coin, hunted scorn, and wounding all await", "This night holds importance dark", and "Choose the way that’s right and straight".
Written by the dancer and prostitute Myndrarra Tresstyl in the 14 century DR, the book went from little-known to ubiquitous when the priesthoods of various churches attempted to suppress it. The reason for their antagonism was that the book came uncomfortably close to the paid services they provided to supplicants, obfuscated by cryptic wording and theatrical sleight-of-hand. For their efforts, the priesthoods only succeeded in spreading its popularity, and the popularity of its author.
