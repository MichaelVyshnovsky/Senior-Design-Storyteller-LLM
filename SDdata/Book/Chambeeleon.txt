The '''''Chambeeleon''''' ({{Pronounce|kam|BEE|lee|on|refs=

==Description==
The resplendent cover of the spellbook was made of sheets of shimmering [[abalone]] and corners of pressed [[gold]]. It had 66 pages of polished [[electrum]], with embossed writing that contained runes, glyphs, and script. Due to the distinctive elements in its crafting, it was completely waterproof.

==History==
The origins of the ''Chambeeleon'' were unknown, but it was markedly antique. The priesthoods of seven aquatic deities claimed it contained the "creation records" associated with their gods.

According to [[Alaer]], it was found in the court of the [[aquatic elves]] at [[Thunderfoam]] an age before the [[Time of Troubles]]. Years later, the hero [[Galadaunt]] found the tome on the deck of a ''[[ghost ship]]'' in the [[Emerald Isles]]. He eventually sold it to an unnamed [[wizard]] whose apprentice wound up being known as the [[Mad Mage]]. This mage had the tome under guard by a [[succubus]]. His apprentice was [[Arbane]], whose studies and recollection allowed for an understanding of the tome's contents.

==Contents==
The ''Chambeeleon'' was known to contain the following spells:
:''[[water breathing]]'' &bull; ''[[fly]]'' &bull; ''[[lightning bolt]]'' &bull; ''[[fire shield]]'' &bull; ''[[ice storm]]'' &bull; ''[[airy water]]'' &bull; ''[[cone of cold]]'' &bull; ''[[conjure elemental]]'' &bull; ''[[disintegrate]]'' &bull; ''[[glassee]]'' &bull; ''[[part water]]'' &bull; ''[[Drawmij's instant summons]]'' &bull; ''[[reverse gravity]]'' &bull; ''[[vanish]]'' 

It was rumored to contain ''[[imprisonment]]'' and ''[[prismatic sphere]]'' as well. Also, as noted by Arbane, the version of ''conjure elemental'' would only summon ''[[water elemental]]s''; they were loyal to the caster and would never attack them outright.
