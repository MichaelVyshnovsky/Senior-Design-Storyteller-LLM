Uncovering Umgatlik was a research manuscript dedicated to the study of the ancient Netherese lich Umgatlik.
Uncovering Umgatlik was a collection of drafts, manuscripts, and sketches, some of which were done in charcoal. The work was compiled by a hapless Savant Gumbril, who signed his manuscript as Savant Gumbril the Great.
Savant Gumbril discovered lore about what he thought was a long lost god of the ancient Netheril empire. He assembled a team and, eventually, uncovered Umgatliks shrine, buried within the deadly cliffs of the Crabs Claw Coast in the . Uncovering Umgatlik was what Savant Gumbril titled his notes and copies of writings and arcane symbols collected from within the lost crypt. As of 1372 DR, the research remained unpublished. The books future remained unclear, possibly due to Gumbrils rumored death or the research being discredited or even abandoned.
