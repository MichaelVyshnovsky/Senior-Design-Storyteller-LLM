'''''Briel's Book of Shadows''''' was an untitled spellbook.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|34-35}}

==Description==
The folio was bound with leather and contained 21 pages of stained and worn parchment.

==History==
Although untitled, it was commonly referred to as ''Briel's Book of Shadows''. The folio was widely considered to have been penned by the archmage [[Briel]] while he was an apprentice under [[Aumvor]]. [[Ubergast]], the sage, pointed to some evidence that supports this. He discovered the handwriting within the book was similar to a letter penned by Briel which was found in the archives of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Contents==
The book contained notes, musings, ramblings, and spells. It had a chapter on the uses of [[alicorn]]s and the instructions to create a [[homunculus]]. It held the following spells:
