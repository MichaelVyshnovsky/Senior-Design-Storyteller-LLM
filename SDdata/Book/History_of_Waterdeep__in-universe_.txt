The History of Waterdeep was a six-volume series of books that outlined the storied history of Waterdeep, the City of Splendors.
The series of books detailed the history of the famous metropolis, from its pre-history as a gathering place for local traders, throughout the founding of Nimoars Hold in the 9 century DR, up to the early Era of Upheaval in the mid–14 century.
The first volume of the History of Waterdeep offered an appreciated version of citys past, touching on the most impactful events that shaped  growth and development over the centuries. It touched upon the citys criminal justice system, contemporary Waterdhavian lifestyle, and briefly mentioned the famous guilds that played such a critical role in Waterdeeps history.
Volume two set the scene for Waterdeeps founding. It shared with the reader details about life in the Savage Frontier and the Sword Coast North, in the era before the earliest settlement was established at Deepwater Harbor.
In the spring and autumn months, passing traders docked within the harbor to trade with hunters and crafters from local tribes. Timber was gathered at each of these trademoots, so the seaborn merchants could repair their vessels and return next season.
The third volume detailed the rise to power of the Waterdeeps first ruler Nimoar, along with the early challenges the city faced. As a burgeoning community grew from the bi-annual trademoots, Nimoar raised the first wooden palisades to ensure its protection. The growing settlement  came to be known as "Nimoars Hold, the Town of Waters Deep."
After Nimoars Hold successfully weathered a few failed attacks by pirates and nearby raiding tribes, it faced its first truly great challenge. Conflicts between elves and orcs north of Nimoars Hold displaced large populations of trolls, that settled in the nearby Evermoors. After Nimoars passing, the settlement that bore his came to be known only as Waterdeep. The citys warlords rallied together to fight off hordes of trolls in a decade-long series of conflicts known as the Trollwars. These battles ended following the emergence of a skilled young mage named Ahghairon, who turned the tide of war in Waterdeeps favor.
Volume four of the History of Waterdeep detailed the final years of the reign of Raurlor during the 11 century, his growing conflict with Ahghairon―who had become an aged old mage, and the rule of Raurlors successor.
When Ahghairon came to learn of Raurlors plant to created a grand empire of the North, the old wizard confronted the warlord before the citys people. Raurlor attempted to imprison Ahghairon for his public impudence, and even struck out at the old mage with his sword, but was ultimately stopped and slain by Ahghairons magic.
Ahghairon called upon the heads most prominent Waterdhavian families and founded a new governing body, one that he served in publicly, while others were granted anonymity. Waterdeep thrived under the rule of Ahghairon and the Masked Lords. The citys walls were expanded outwards twice over and the influential Council of Guildmasters was founded, to help manage the increasing amount of wealth that flowed in and out of the city.
The fifth volume detailed the rise and fall of Waterdeeps guild masters and the accompany Guildwars that broke out in the mid–13 century DR.
After Ahghairons death, the Lords of Waterdeep stopped appearing in public, and the Council of Guildmasters consolidated power in their absence. Many of the Lords had actually been slain by guild agents, in preparation for the councils emergence. Unfortunately for Waterdeeps citizens, the guild masters fell to vicious in-fighting, as each member openyl assaulted and even murdered their competitors. When so many of the guilds leaders had all but wiped each other out, the councils two remaining members took the "throne" of Waterdeep for themselves, as the two Lords Magister.
The sixth and final volume of History of Waterdeep described the fall of the two Lords Magister and the return of the true Lords of Waterdeep. It then told how the city continued to thrive and flourish, and briefly mentioned some of the more profound events that occurred within its walls.
After a decade of rule, the Lords Magister were visited by the two Lords of Waterdeep that survived the guildmasters coup, Baeron and Shilarn Silmaeril, the latter of whom was Ahghairons apprentice. The Lords Magister were killed in short order. Baeron declared he would take on the role of Open Lord, as Ahghairon was before him, and Shilarn—who remained masked—would recruit from among the citys nobility to restore the ranks of the Masked Lords.
