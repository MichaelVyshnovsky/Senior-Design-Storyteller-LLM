{{Quote|'''''High Adventure is Your Companion<br/>
'''''Throughout the Land of Fate!

''There is no escaping [[Fate]] in the world of [[Zakhara]], home of caliphs and favored land of the [[genie]]s. And the Fate of brave adventurers is to travel the wide realms, vanquishing the unrighteous and protecting the meek.<br/>
A Dozen and One Adventures ''leads the characters from bustling [[Muluk]], City of Kings, to the mysterious citadel of flame, and many points between. They may meet the king who never died, the fish-people of the Great Sea, and other wonder too amazing to mention.<br/>
''This adventure sourcebox contains a 64-page booklet of 13 adventures, a 32-page campaign guide describing Muluk, the northern lands, and several new magical items, a poster map of Muluk and Krak al-Niraan, six map cards, and four MC insert pages featuring NPCs.''

''Recommended for use with the ''[[Arabian Adventures]]'' rulebook.''}}

==Description==
''A Dozen and One Adventures'' includes thirteen short adventures, featuring weird bathhouses, deceptive ghouls, amorous succubi, passionate genies, raucous merriment with desert riders, the sacred salt bond between host and guest, a boasting contest, a mummified talking head in the Hall of Lost Kings, Greek fire, a deranged fire mage, and the Brotherhood of True Flame. The adventures start with beginning characters, and the finale finishes with characters of levels 9-12.<ref>{{Cite dragon/219/Role-playing Reviews: A Thousand and One Adventures|50-51}}
