Doors to the Unknown is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module. It is part of the Planescape campaign setting.
Doors to the Unknown was written by Monte Cook and was first published by TSR, Inc. in 1996. 
The adventure is designed for characters of levels 4 to 7 and takes place in the city of Sigil. The plot revolves around a series of mysterious doors that have appeared throughout the city, each leading to a different location in the multiverse. The players are tasked with investigating these doors, exploring the strange new worlds they lead to, and uncovering the mysteries behind their appearance.
There are four blink portals that appear in Sigil every 500 years and which last for two months. After this the portals disappear for another half-millennium. The overall aim is for the party to probe these portals and find out the secrets behind them. Rumors indicate that these doors lead to restricted planes, of hyper-real super-monsters, and that they were created by the god Aoskar when the Lady of Pain killed him.
