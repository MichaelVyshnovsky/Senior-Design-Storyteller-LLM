For the unprepared [[adventurer]], the Feywild can be perilous; cruel [[giant]]s, fierce beasts, and devious [[fairies]] dwell there. For others, the Feywild is a land of opportunity, with vast tracts of unexplored wilderness filled with ancient ruins and lost treasures. If you’re going to survive long, you’ll need to embrace your wild side and channel the magic and primal power of\nthe Feywild.''\n\nPlayer’s Option: Heroes of the Feywild™ ''presents races, classes, character themes, feats, powers, and other character options that have a strong connection to the Feywild. It also gives players and Dungeon Masters background information on the inhabitants of this weird and wondrous [[plane]], and how adventurers might cross paths with them.''\n}}",
