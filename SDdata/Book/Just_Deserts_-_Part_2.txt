==Synopsis==
The agents descend a crack in the ground, finding an ancient buried temple, where a malign influence drains the life away from all those who go inside. In the first room they discover several statues carrying staves and a ruby.

Those objects, put together, create an ancient weapon, the [[Light Pump]]. After a succession of traps they come across a greater [[mummy]] serving [[Ilmater]] as the guardian of the temple. Proceeding, they encounter the source of the life-draining influence: a [[stone juggernaut]] whose heart is enchanted with a permanent ''[[lifedrain]]'' spell, withering everything in the area constantly. By destroying the gem, and ending the ''lifedrain'', they release an [[efreet]], which wants to "play".
