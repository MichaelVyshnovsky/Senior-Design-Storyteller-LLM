"Just Deserts - Part 2" is the conclusion of adventure in the deserts of Anauroch for Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition, published in Polyhedron UK #2 after beginning in Polyhedron UK #1.
The agents descend a crack in the ground, finding an ancient buried temple, where a malign influence drains the life away from all those who go inside. In the first room they discover several statues carrying staves and a ruby.
Those objects, put together, create an ancient weapon, the Light Pump. After a succession of traps they come across a greater mummy serving Ilmater as the guardian of the temple. Proceeding, they encounter the source of the life-draining influence a stone juggernaut whose heart is enchanted with a permanent lifedrain spell, withering everything in the area constantly. By destroying the gem, and ending the lifedrain, they release an efreet, which wants to "play".
