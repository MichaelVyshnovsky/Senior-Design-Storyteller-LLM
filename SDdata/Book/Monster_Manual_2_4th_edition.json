        "mainbody": "-edition core rules\nMonster Manual 2 is a core sourcebook for the 4-edition  ruleset. An expansion upon the first Monster Manual, it presents many new monsters, as well as new versions of older ones.\nLike the first, Monster Manual 2 consists of only four chapters, though the first chapter composes most of the book. The chapters are as follows\n# Monsters A to Z — This chapter, by far the largest, includes roughly 300 monsters from abolethic skum to yochlol tempters, listed alphabetically. Each section focuses on a particular monster type, with a small amount of background information for use in games, along with statistics for use in an encounter.\n# Glossary — An explanation of the terms used in the book, such as creature origins (including natural creatures and elementals) as well as game mechanics terms.\n# Racial Traits — This chapter serves as a supplement to the Players Handbook, providing players with alternatives to the core races in the form of \"monster\" races. Unlike the core races, however, these races are not extensively playtested and can be unbalanced compared to the others.\n# Monsters by Level - A listing of all the monsters detailed in the book, sorted alphabetically by level and monster role.\n  () (assassincavalierdire beast huntergladiatorhexermystagoguenoblepirateslaver) (razor hydra) () () () () () ()"
