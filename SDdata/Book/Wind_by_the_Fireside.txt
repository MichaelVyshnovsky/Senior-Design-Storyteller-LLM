'''''Wind by the Fireside''''' was a traditional trail ballad by an unknown composer, popular across the [[Savage Frontier]] and the [[Sword Coast North]], with many different forms and variations.

==Scholarship==
The precise origin and history of ''Wind by the Fireside'' were not known, but sages agreed that the poem itself had changed a lot with the passing of centuries. This became clear when taking into account the many versions and variations of the poem in various regions of the Realms. However, the sages did not know what the poem was originally, the extent of the changes, or how or why it changed, only being certain that alterations did take place. Many simply attributed these changes to the natural evolution of language over time and to developments in style.

Some sages theorized the poem began as an ode in some long-gone religion or cult, while others believed it referenced the [[creator race]]s of [[Faerûn]].

==Text==
While there were variations found in different lands, and popular in [[Neverwinter]] and beyond ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], is as follows:

{{quote|''So as you shiver in the cold and the dark,<br />Look into the fire and seen in its spark&mdash;<br />My eye<br />Watching over you.''<br />

''As you walk in the wind's whistling claws,<br />Listen past the howling [[wolf]]'s jaws.<br />My song<br />Comes to you.''<br />

''And when you're lost in trackless snow,<br />Look up high where the [[eagle]]s go.<br />My star<br />Shines for you.''<br />

''In deep, dark mine or on crumbling peak,<br />Hear the words of love I speak.<br />My thoughts<br />Are with you.''<br />

''You are not forsaken.<br />You are not forgotten.<br />The North cannot swallow you.<br />The snow cannot bury you.<br />I will come for you.<br />[[Faerûn]] will grow warmer,<br />And the gods will smile<br />But oh, my love, guard yourself well&mdash;<br />All this may not happen for a long, long while.''}}

==History==
Copies of a [[book]] containing the above text of ''Wind by the Fireside'' could be found around the areas of Neverwinter, [[Daggerford]], and the Sword Coast North ''circa'' 1372 DR.
