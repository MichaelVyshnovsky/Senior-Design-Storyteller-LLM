'''''The Last Threshold''''' is the fourth and final novel of [[The Neverwinter Saga]] by [[R.A. Salvatore]].
{{quote|''In the final book of the #4 New York Times best-selling Neverwinter Saga, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] navigates a winding path littered with secrets and lies. Tangled up in his companion [[Dahlia Sin'felle|Dahlia's]] dark secrets, the ties that once held her close to Drizzt threaten to tear as her bonds to his former foe, [[Artemis Entreri]], continue to grow. Meanwhile, in the caverns of [[Gauntlgrym]], the [[drow]] [[Tiago Baenre]] enlists the help of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in his quest to destroy Drizzt. While making promises they may not keep, the agents of the elite drow mercenary group hide plans of their own. Determined to stand for what's right in the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]] once again, Drizzt forges a new road north—toward [[Icewind Dale]]. Will his new companions follow? Can he fight the darkness alone? Either way, he knows now where he's headed—back to the only place that's ever felt like home.''}}
==Summary==
Now that [[Charon's Claw]] is destroyed, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his companions—not only [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and [[Artemis Entreri]], but also the former [[Shadovar]] [[Ambergris (person)|Ambergris]] and [[Afafrenfere]] rest in [[Neverwinter]] while they decide their next course. Drizzt is resolved to find [[Guenhwyvar]], who has somehow been trapped in the [[Shadowfell]] and can no longer be summoned, but when he attempts to summon her some time later, he is successful. He devises a plan to take his companions, particularly Entreri, to rebuild [[Port Llast]] in order to show them there is something worthwhile and honorable to do with their skills.

While seeking the help of [[Arunika]], Drizzt and Dahlia find evidence of a vampire, which turns out to be [[Thibbledorf Pwent]], [[Bruenor Battlehammer]]'s loyal shield dwarf who had tragically been turned into a vampire by [[Dor'crae]]. Pwent resolves to remain in the sunlight and be destroyed; Drizzt and Dahlia leave him to go in peace and honor. The group heads north.

In the [[Shadowfell]], [[Effron]] is desperate to get back at his mother, Dahlia. He plans to steal Guenhwyvar in order to blackmail Drizzt into leaving Dahlia's side, but the panther is already gone and Lord [[Draygo Quick]] discovers his plan. 

Meanwhile, [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Athrogate]] are alive and well and working for [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. They find out that [[Tiago Baenre]] is seeking [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who now apparently travels with Artemis Entreri, whom Jarlaxle had both befriended and betrayed. Jarlaxle and Athrograte travel on Bregan D'aerthe business to the [[Shade Enclave]].

Drizzt's group travel to Port Llast so that Entreri can retrieve his dagger and Drizzt can enact his plan. They help rebuild Port Llast. Drizzt notices that Guenhwyvar does not seem to be getting enough rest. That is because Draygo Quick has in fact bound her to the Shadowfell, so she is unable to return home to the [[Astral Plane]] when unsummoned. At some point, Effron appears in order to capture Dahlia, but his heart is softened and he ends up joining Drizzt's group instead. Effron tells them about Guenhwyvar.

Drizzt's group go to Draygo Quick's home to retrieve Guenhwyvar. In the process, Dahlia and Entreri are petrified, Drizzt and Effron are captured, and only Ambergris escapes. Drizzt remains a guest/prisoner of Quick for as long as a year before Jarlaxle, having learned of his whereabouts from Ambergris, mounts an assault by Bregan D'aerthe on Quick's residence. Drizzt and his companions are freed and unpetrified. They set forth for [[Icewind Dale]], determined to wait out Tiago's search.

In Icewind Dale, the group inadvertently wander into a portion of [[Iruladoon]], spending a night there that lasts eighteen years. When they awake, it is [[1484 DR]] and it seems the world has forgotten them. Drizzt resolves to stay in Icewind Dale and Dahlia, upset with him, attacks him. Entreri pulls Dahlia away, but not before Drizzt appears to succumb to his wounds on top of [[Kelvin's Cairn]], hearing the voices of his long-dead friends beside him.
