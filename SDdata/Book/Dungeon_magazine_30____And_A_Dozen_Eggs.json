        "mainbody": "\"...And A Dozen Eggs\" is a Waterdeep adventure for Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition published in Dungeon #30.\nSometime around the month of Eleint, twelve tanystropheus eggs from Chult are purchased by Phalantars Philtres & Components for use as potion ingredients. However, the eggs hatch overnight in its warm laboratory and the creatures escape into the Waterdhavian sewers through its garbage chute. Phalantar Orivan reports this to the City Watch as soon as he finds out, but that night the young dinosaurs attack members of the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild, killing one and leaving two badly mauled. The next day Phalantar puts out a reward of 500 gold pieces per living dinosaur and 100 gold pieces per dead, while the Guild offers an additional reward of 200 gold pieces. A large number of adventurers and bounty hunters in Waterdeep jump at this opportunity. \nIn an area beneath a large laundry, one group discovers that its warm temperature and regular pouring of soapscum had made the area a breeding ground for fungi, including a collection of shriekers and violet fungi. Amid the fungi, they spot the corpse of a tanystropheus that was chasing a giant rat. After making their way past, the adventurers find a group of bounty hunters struggling to fend off one of the tanystropheuses and jump to their aid.\nLater, while at a festhall or tavern, the adventurers are approached by a strange old sailor named Pravus Muridae, who informs them that he knows where one of the dinosaurs are in the sewers and will lead them there in return for splitting the bounty. Leading them into the sewers, Pravus eventually reveals himself to be a cleric of the rat god, who has been using the dinosaurs to lure people into the sewers for the purposes of robbing, feeding his wererat minions, and making sacrifices to his god. Parvus then sicks a group of wererats upon them. He and the rest of his wererat allies potentially escape deeper into the sewers to cause further mischief another day, while some of the tanystropheuses are potentially left unrecovered. However, the latter are presumed lethargic from the cold weather of Marpenoth, then dead from the freezing weather of Uktar, and by Uktar 30 all bounties are rescinded.\n •  •  •  • \nSewer Encounters  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nBuildings & Structures Phalantars Philtres & Components\nDungeons \nSettlements Waterdeep\nRegions Sword Coast North\n •  • \nSpells  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n ()\nArmor & Clothing  • \nBuilding Type \nDates  • \nItems  • \nProfessions \nVegetation \nWeapons  •  •"
