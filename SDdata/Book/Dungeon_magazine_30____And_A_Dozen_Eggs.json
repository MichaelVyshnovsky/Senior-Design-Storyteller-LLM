        "Synopsis": "Sometime around the month of [[Eleint]], twelve [[tanystropheus]] [[egg]]s from [[Chult]] are purchased by [[Phalantar's Philtres & Components]] for use as [[potion]] ingredients. However, the eggs hatch overnight in its warm laboratory and the creatures escape into the [[sewers of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian sewers]] through its garbage chute. [[Phalantar Orivan]] reports this to the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] as soon as he finds out, but that night the young [[dinosaur]]s attack members of the [[Cellarers' & Plumbers' Guild]], killing one and leaving two badly mauled. The next day Phalantar puts out a reward of 500 [[gold piece]]s per living dinosaur and 100 gold pieces per dead, while the Guild offers an additional reward of 200 gold pieces.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|8-9}} A large number of [[adventurer]]s and [[bounty hunter]]s in [[Waterdeep]] jump at this opportunity.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|9,12}} \n\nIn an area beneath a large laundry, one group discovers that its warm temperature and regular pouring of [[soap]]scum had made the area a breeding ground for [[fungi]], including a collection of [[shrieker]]s and [[violet fungus|violet fungi]]. Amid the fungi, they spot the corpse of a tanystropheus that was chasing a [[giant rat]]. After making their way past, the adventurers find a group of bounty hunters struggling to fend off one of the tanystropheuses and jump to their aid.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|11-12}}\n\nLater, while at a [[festhall]] or tavern, the adventurers are approached by a strange old sailor named [[Pravus Muridae]], who informs them that he knows where one of the dinosaurs are in the sewers and will lead them there in return for splitting the bounty.{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|12-13}} Leading them into the sewers, Pravus eventually reveals himself to be a [[cleric]] of the [[Sneel|rat god]],{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|14}} who has been using the dinosaurs to lure people into the sewers for the purposes of robbing, feeding his [[wererat]] minions, and making sacrifices to his god. Parvus then sicks a group of wererats upon them. He and the rest of his wererat allies potentially escape deeper into the sewers to cause further mischief another day, while some of the tanystropheuses are potentially left unrecovered. However, the latter are presumed lethargic from the cold weather of [[Marpenoth]], then dead from the freezing weather of [[Uktar]], and by [[Uktar 30]] all bounties are rescinded.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|15}}",
