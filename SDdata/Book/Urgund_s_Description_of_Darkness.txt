Urgunds Description of Darkness was a book telling of the authors captivity in the lower planes.
Although it was a grim work, it was not much more than a listing of names and palaces, for the horrors within them were too much to set down on paper. It was written in a strange and hesitant hand, and bound in a black cover.
Notably, in it Urgund made mention of the Seven Lost Gods of antiquity and their service to the god Bane, the Black Lord. He wrote "...and seated foremost in the Hall of Minor Courtiers were the lesser powers Maram of the Great Spear Haask, Voice of Hargut Tyranthraxus the Flamed One Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud and Camnod the Unseen. These too fell down and became servants of the great lord Bane."
A copy of Urgunds Description of Darkness was stored in the philosophy section of Mantors Library in Phlan around 1340 DR.
