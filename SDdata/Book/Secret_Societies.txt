The Secret Societies tome collected scant lore on various secret societies of Faerûn, penned sometime before 1281 DR.
One chapter in the book talked about the relatively recently formed organization called the Kraken Society or Heralds of the Sea, with a many-tentacled purple squid being their symbol. It was said to had been birthed in the ruins of Ascale out of several groups of criminals, spies, thieves, and priests of Umberlee from north Faerûn. All of them served a single overlord of whom little was known. This secret society was prone to assassinate, torture, and kidnap its enemies.
By the , this book found its way to several locations in the northwest Faerûn, namely the monastic retreat within the Dragons Eye on the Spine of the World, and in the , in the library of the Black Raven Monastery, in the mountains above the Ice Lakes and the Black Raven River.
