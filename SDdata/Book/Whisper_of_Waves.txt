'''''Whisper of Waves''''' by [[Philip Athans]] is the first book in the [[Watercourse trilogy]].

{{Quote|'''''The Wizard.''' Pledged to the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] from boyhood, he will do anything for anyone who can give him more power. In a twisted dimension outside the walls of time and space, he plots and plans.''

'''''The Senator.''' A [[genasi]], he has fought his way up from the streets and will never go back. Amid the tangled streets of [[Innarlith]], he mixes ambition with thoughts of vengeance.''

'''''The Man.''' A master builder, he walks along the coast of [[Faerûn]] and the waves whisper to him of a mighty work, a task worthy of his talents.''}}
