==Description==
''The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook'' details [[sha'ir]]s and also the elemental mages of Zakhara. Players will find information on character attributes, abilities, and role-playing aspects specific to the sha'ir class. It explores various sha'ir organizations and sects, each with its unique traditions and goals. Players can choose to belong to these groups or create their own.

The book introduces the concept of gen and elemental magic. Sha'irs can summon gen to cast spells on their behalf, drawing on the power of the four classical elements: air, earth, fire, and water. It provides rules for summoning and negotiating with gen spirits. It includes a selection of unique spells and magical abilities associated with sha'irs and their gen familiars. These spells often revolve around the control of elemental forces and the granting of wishes.

''The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook'' includes information on the equipment favored by sha'irs and their relationships with their gen familiars. Gen familiars serve as companions, magical aides, and sources of mystical insight.

It offers role-playing tips and suggestions for players who wish to portray sha'ir characters convincingly. It covers topics like dealing with gen, navigating the complexities of genie politics, and interacting with other characters. ''The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook'' also provides campaign ideas and adventure hooks that involve sha'ir characters and the challenges they might face. These adventures often revolve around elemental quests, encounters with otherworldly entities, or dealings with powerful genies. The book discusses how to integrate sha'irs into different campaign settings. It also includes profiles of notable sha'ir NPCs, both allies and adversaries, that can be used in campaigns as mentors, rivals, or sources of knowledge.
