        "mainbody": "Swords of the Daimyo is an adventure for AD&D 1 edition ruleset. It is part of the Oriental Adventures campaign setting and is set in Kozakura in Kara-Tur.\nSwords of the Daimyo was written by David \"Zeb\" Cook with Kelley Foote and published by TSR in 1986, and included a thirty two page gazetteer called Province Book of Miyama and a thirty two page \"Adventure Book\", with a large color map and an outer folder. The module featured cover and interior art by Jeff Easley. It was the first module made for use with Oriental Adventures. The Province book describes the Eastern continent of Kara-Tur, Miyama Province, and the island of Kozakura. The module includes a historical timeline for Kozakura, as well as new monsters.\nSwords of the Daimyo provides an overview of the politics and climate of the lands of Kozakura. After a brief overview of Kozakura, the pack focuses on the province of Miyama, and its government, samurai families, temples and landholdings. The package also includes a list of names and maps of various residences found in the province. It gives the continent map of the world presented in the original Oriental Adventures, and details an entire province and gives a background for one of the five major divisions of the world.\nSwords of the Daimyo contains three adventures. The first adventure is for player characters (PCs) levels 6–10, and takes the characters on a sea voyage to Kozakura. The adventure includes a system for calculating the chances of a crew mutiny. When the PCs arrive in Kozakura, the module states that \"it is likely that one or more will be permanently slain\", with the intention of replacing said characters with new local characters. The other two adventures in the module are designed for Oriental Adventures characters, and revolve around the nefarious activities of the sohei (militant clerics) of the Black Temple. One of these adventures involves the defense of a village against bandits, and the other is a mission to take out the organizer of the bandits. These two adventures form a linked package, separated by time and a few character levels.\n* Adventure 1 Over the Waves We Will Go\n* Adventure 2 Riders of the Black Temple\n* Adventure 3 Lord of the Black Temple\n* Timeline of Kozakura\n* New Creatures\n* Player Characters\n* Maps\nDaidoji Rakan • Fukada Shiro • Gobo the Hermit • Goryu • Hiro Ieyuki • Hiro Koji • Hiro Masaru • Hori Chomin • Hoseki • Ishi • Iyawaei • Kadokawa Yori • Kani • Kiro • Kishimoto Endai • Koda Yoshiuji • Kuda no Nito • Kuroda Saga • Kyo Enoki • Matsue Fusu • Miki-san • Myudo Ichiro • Nado Tori • Naoki Katasube • Niwa Sutai • Nogami Sado • Ochio • Onagata • Ooka Kanetomo • Osamu Muraoka • Otsabe Kanchi • Penri • Rupert Brock • Saito Nobunga • Toragawa • Unwanted One • Watanabe Kanzo • Yonin • Yoshiie\nbakemono • ghoul • giant octopus • goblin rat • goblin spider • hai nu • hengeyokai • human • ixitxachitl • jishin mushi • korobokuru • lich • ningyo • oni • pteranodon • rokuro-kubi • sahuagin • specter • skeleton • spirit folk • tengu • utoyasukata • wako • yuki-on-na\nRealms Kozakura\nPotions philter of love • potion of extra-healing • potion of growth • potion of invisibility • potion of super-heroism\nSpells Accuracy • Aid • Apparition • Bless • Castigate • Cure light wounds • Deflection • Dream vision • Elemental burst • Enchanted blade • Hail of stone • Hold person • Know history • Rope trick • Withdraw\nArmor & Clothing do-maru • hara-ate • hara-ate-gawa • haramaki • kote • sune-ate\nVegetation bamboo • cryptomeria • cypress • lichen • moss • pine\nVehicles ghost ship\nWeapons naginata • tetsubo\nSwords of the Daimyo Back Cover.jpg|Back Cover\n* Design Zeb Cook, Kelley Foote\n* Editing Mike Breault, Anne Gray McCready, Karen Martin\n* Cartography David C.
