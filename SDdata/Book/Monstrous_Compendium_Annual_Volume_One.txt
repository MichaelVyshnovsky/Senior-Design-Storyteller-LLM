The '''''Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume One''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory.

{{Quote|''“They’re ba-ack! Virtually all of the monsters that appeared in TSR’s 1993 AD&D product line, plus many of those that appeared in the ’93 issues of [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]], [[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]], and [[Polyhedron Newszine|Polyhedron]] Magazines, are brought together in this first release in an annual series of Monstrous Compendium supplements.''

This book is crawling with more than 100 denizens of the land, sky, sea, and [[underdark]], waiting to creep into the nearest adventure. Creatures within these pages have appeared in the [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign setting, the [[Al-Qadim]] world of adventure, the [[Ravenloft]] world of horror, the [[Dark Sun]] game world, and even the [[Outer Planes|Outer]] and [[Inner Planes]], but they’ve been reorganized, updated, and edited so they can be used in any campaign. An introduction explaining how to breathe life into random encounters is included too.

Every illustration is brand new and presented in full color, so these monsters are more lifelike than ever before! This is a must-have item for all serious Dungeon Masters.”}}

==Description==
''Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume One'' serves as a supplement to the AD&D game, providing an extensive collection of monsters that were previously published in various 1993 ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' modules, as well as ''[[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]]'' and ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.

The structure of the ''Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume One'' adheres to the format established by earlier ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'' supplements. It features detailed entries for each monster, including physical descriptions, behaviors, combat tactics, and statistics necessary for gameplay. These entries are designed to be easily integrated into the existing binder system of the ''Monstrous Compendium'' series, allowing for a customizable and expansive monster reference library.

In addition to monster descriptions, the ''Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume One'' provides lore and background information for each creature, offering insights into their habitats, societies, and roles within the AD&D world.
