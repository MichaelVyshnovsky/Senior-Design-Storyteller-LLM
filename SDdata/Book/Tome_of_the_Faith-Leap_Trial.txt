Tome of the Faith-Leap Trial was a textbook used to teach Sharran initiates to trust the holy path of darkness that was printed in the ancient times, long before the 15 century DR.
The purpose of the Tome of the Faith-Leap Trial was to help young initiates pass the faith-leap trial, which was part of the Gauntlet of Shar and a right of passage for Dark Justiciars of the Church. It instructed the acolytes to step into Shars darkness and be guided by her along a perilous veering path across an invisible bridge. The tome claimed that those whose heart was closed to the Nightsinger were doomed to plummet into the darkness underneath.
