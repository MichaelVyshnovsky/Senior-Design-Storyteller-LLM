        "mainbody": "he Song of Druids Deep was a song worked on by the Harper bard Tarim Inavule in the late 15 century DR.\nThe song was created to commemorate the events that occurred around the Druids Deep of Thorngap, in the Kings Forest of Cormyr, which was taken over by the druid Halsaime after he was corrupted and maddened by a cursed staff. Although he caused a great deal of destruction and suffering as he plotted to conquer the world, Tarim, Jussko Kwahn, Kirinel Zay, and some heroic adventurers managed to stop him and destroy the staff before he could do more than threaten Eveningstar."
