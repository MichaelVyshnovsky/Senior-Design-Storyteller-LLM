This adventure was released as a prelude for ''[[Lost Crown of Neverwinter]]''.\n\n{{Quote|''The task seems easy enough: Accompany a mysterious traveler and her equally mysterious package from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Neverwinter]].''\n\n''In the Jewel of the North, tasks are seldom easy, though. News travels fast, and the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] have learned of the traveler and the object she carries. Now, a [[necromancer]] readies an ambush for the [[adventurer]]s and their ward, intent on stealing the item for its own sinister purpose.''\n\n''Gates of Neverdeath is a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] Game Day adventure, and is a prequel to  [[Lost Crown of Neverwinter]], the summer 2011 season of the [[D&D Encounters]] official play program. The adventure comes with one full-color battle map, and two ready to play encounters.''}}\n[[Category:Game Day adventures]]\n[[Category:Published in 2011]]\n[[Category:4th edition adventures]]\n[[Category:Works by Erik Scott de Bie]]\n[[Category:Adventurers]]\n[[Category:4th edition sourcebooks]]\n[[Category:Sourcebooks]]\n[[Category:Books]]\ncr4ftxplwsrnb91zv9et77szln6vyea"
