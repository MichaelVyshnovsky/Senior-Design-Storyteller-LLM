{{quote|''I know not what the younger folk are thinking, these days with their deance of elders, new ideas, and ever-louder scorn. It is all so bad for business! Do they not understand that thriving business feathers their nests, and fills their bellies? Or are they all stone-mad? And want to see the end of the world?''|An excerpt from ''A Seat That Draws Blood''}}
