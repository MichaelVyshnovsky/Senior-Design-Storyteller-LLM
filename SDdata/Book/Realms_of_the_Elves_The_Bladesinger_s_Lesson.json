        "mainbody": "\"The Bladesingers Lesson\" is a short story by Richard Baker first published in the 2006 anthology Realms of the Elves.\nDaried Selsherryn an Elven Bladesinger of some nobility is commanding a defensive scouting party in his forsaken homeland of Cormanthyr against a Sembian invading force. The elven troop is small and posted there by higher command for fear of a stealthy flanking of the larger elven force that they are apart of. There is some question as to the value of their post as the River Ashaba was thought to be extremely difficult to ford.\nWhile in the area Daried can not resist visiting the abandoned estate of his familys previous home. When entering the gardens he finds the protective wards countered, and evidence of tomb robbing perhaps decades prior. Of particular frustration to him is the missing Selsherryn Moonblade -  long magically defunct.\nHe excuses himself from the command of his small troop to enquire in the nearby small human settlement in the vicinity of Mistledale.  Daried considers the community  nameless and of no account. There he makes accusations and insinuations on many of the towns folk. When inquiring about the taken  moonblade he finds out that he is just days late - as the house that held the \"acquired sword\" has been ransacked  just nights before his arrival by a band of mercenaries.\nHe engages on the hunt for the mercenary band and the moonblade - tracking them to a critical river fording - one of which he was unaware. The hunt for the moonblade has brought him to the realization that there is a weak point - and further more the Sembians Mercenaries are aware of the river crossing.\nDaried stops an archer named Nilsa who has also followed the marauders - shes bent on killing the raiders one arrow at a time. Nilsa is the local descendant of the man who had taken the moon blade and is clearly of questionable heritage.\nTogether they perform some valiant heroism. Lessons about valor and worth are learned."
