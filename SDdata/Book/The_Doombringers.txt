'''''The Doombringers''''' was one of several [[book]]s written about the [[creator race]]s and published sometime before the [[Wailing Death]] crisis of [[1372 DR]].

==Contents==
The tome collected scant lore about the several races of the ancient [[Toril]] known as the creator races who were not gods, despite what some believed. The book talked about the great power wielded by these races unseen on the face of [[Faerûn]] ever since. They ruled unchallenged for ages until the time called the great cooling – the emergence of new beast-like races that would later become the dominant peoples of Toril.

The book claimed that the true names of the creator races were lost to eons. One of these races was believed to have built fearsome powerful warrior machines – the Doombringers. These ancient Doombringers were threatening to destroy the young races, altering the planet's future, but fate intervened. The race that created these machines of death was pushed to the edges of Faerûn, past the area later to become the [[Spine of the World]]. According to stories, the race tapped into the earth's life force and upset the balance of the natural world. They ignored the warning signs until it was too late, and the earth swallowed the great underground vaults. Trapped in the depths of the earth, the old race lost control of the machines. The great Doombringers left to stand idle. The younger races took the opportunity and attacked the sleeping giants. With time and effort, they pulled the Doombringers to the ground, and the machines of death were disabled.

As centuries passed, the young races lived in fear of the Doombringers' return until the creator race lost its name, and eventually, the fear was forgotten. Very little of them was remembered in the form of legends. The book closed on a lesson the modern races needed to learn. Even the strongest eventually fall.

==History==
Copies of ''The Doombringers'' book could be found around the areas of [[Neverwinter]], [[Daggerford]], and the [[Sword Coast North]]  ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.
