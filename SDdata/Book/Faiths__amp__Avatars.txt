Faiths & Avatars is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons accessory for the Forgotten Realms.
__NOTOC__
Faiths & Avatars detailed the deities of the Faer没nian pantheon. This comprehensive resource includes detailed descriptions of 45 gods, alongside the introduction of four new priest sub-classes. Each deity entry features a thorough presentation, encompassing the deitys background, statistical data, and personal history. Additionally, the book details the physical manifestation of these gods in the mortal realm, known as Avatars, which represents the form most likely to be encountered by adventurers.
The book outlines each deitys religious organization, providing insights into the churchs hierarchy, core beliefs, daily practices, principal places of worship, affiliated religious orders, and the specifics of priestly attire, both for ceremonial purposes and for adventurers. Moreover, it details each deitys holy days and significant rituals. Faiths & Avatars also offers an array of specific spells available to their followers.
The final section of the book introduces four specialized priest sub-classes crusaders, monks, mystics, and shamans, each with distinct roles and abilities.
Faiths & Avatars serves as a definitive source for information on the range of Lesser to Greater human gods within the Faer没nian pantheon, equipping players and Dungeon Masters with an abundance of spells and unique powers tailored for clerics of each distinct faith.
