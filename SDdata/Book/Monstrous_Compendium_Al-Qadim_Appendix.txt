'''''Monstrous Compendium Al-Qadim Appendix''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory. It is part of the [[Al-Qadim]] campaign setting and set in [[Zakhara]].
{{Quote|''Glittering treasures lie undisturbed in darkened caves. Angry [[genie]]s seethe in magically-sealed bottles. Gigantic birds of prey roost atop unscalable mountain peaks. Sea serpents twist and slither beneath blue waves. Alongside a world of stunning beauty and idyllic leisure exits a harsh realm of legendary beasts and monsters.
''The [[Al-Qadim|AL-QADIM]] appendix for your Monstrous Compendium contains 64 pages of monsters drawn from the fables of the Middle East. The creatures in this appendix are perfect for an AL-QADIM campaign, or for spicing up any AD&D game desert setting.''}}

==Description==
