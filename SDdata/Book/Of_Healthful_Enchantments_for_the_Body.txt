'''''Of Healthful Enchantments for the Body''''' was a [[book|tome]] that collected crafting recipes for various [[enchanted]] [[belt]]s and [[boot]]s.

==Contents==
The book collected ingredients, recipes, and arcane formulae required for crafting and enchanting several magic articles of clothing. Some of the recipes listed included ''[[belt of agility|belts of agility]]'' that required use of elemental essence of air, [[star sapphire]] or [[rogue stone]], and spells of ''[[cat's grace]]''. The recipe for ''[[belt or frost giant's strength]]'' required [[blue diamond]]s or [[jacinth]]s and a ''[[bull's strength]]'' spell. Another item listed in the tome was a pair of ''[[boots of striding]]''.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, several copies of the tome could be found across the [[Sword Coast]]. One copy found its way into the hands of Shadow Priests who worshiped the [[King of Shadows]] in the [[Crossroad Keep]], before the fort was re-taken by the [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter]] and the [[Kalach-Cha]].
