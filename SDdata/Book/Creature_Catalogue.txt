Creature Catalogue is a Basic Dungeons & Dragons accessory published in 1986 by TSR, Inc.
Creature Catalogue describes over 200 monsters, most of which had been collected from D&D rules and modules, as well as 80 new monsters which had never been printed before each monster is illustrated and indexed by habitat.  Creature Catalogue collected all the creatures first presented in the official Dungeons & Dragons adventure modules to that time, plus many new creatures and some converted from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. Also included is a comprehensive index of all Dungeons & Dragons monsters found in the Basic, Expert, Companion and Master rulesets.
Each creature in the book is illustrated, and the entries in the book are ordered by type rather than just alphabetically. This includes six sections Animals (including giant and extinct varieties), Conjurations (such as elementals and golems), Humanoids, Lowlife (including insects, plants, and jellies and slimes), Monsters (a catch-all category), and Undead. The Intelligence score of each monster is listed with the rest of its statistics. The book also includes a comprehensive index of all monsters by environment, and Frank Mentzers guide on how to balance encounters according to the levels of the player characters, originally printed in the Master Set, is reproduced in the introduction.
