'''''Queen of Ravens''''' was a [[book]] dedicated to the legends and lore about the mysterious [[Raven Queen]], penned sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''In that time of shattered allegiances between elven Gods, and with the adulation of the shadar-kai elves in her pocket, the woman bid her followers elevate her to godhood. "Do it, and I'll reforge our broken pantheon." She said. "Do it, and I'll make things sweet and synchronous again."''|Excerpt from ''Queen of Ravens.''}}

==Content==
''Queen of Ravens'' was a book full of gorgeous illustrations and artistic renditions of the Raven Queen's history. The tome talked about a woman who was elevated to dignity by her elven followers, the [[Shadar-kai (elf)|Shadar-kai]], in a time of conflict between the members of the [[Seldarine]]. The woman's accession to godhood was to be down via a ritual that was interrupted by those who betrayed her. The Raven Queen killed the dissenters, but the ritual was interrupted. She and her followers were thrown across the planes by the ritual, ending up in the [[Shadowfell]]. The ritual and the transportation ended the Raven Queen's life, but she rose from the ashes of her mortal shell. She was a god-like figure with black eyes and served by black ravens. She was the Raven Queen, Mistress of Life and Death.
