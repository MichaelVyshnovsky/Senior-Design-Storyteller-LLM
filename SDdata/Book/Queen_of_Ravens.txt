Queen of Ravens was a book dedicated to the legends and lore about the mysterious Raven Queen, penned sometime before the late 15 century DR.
Queen of Ravens was a book full of gorgeous illustrations and artistic renditions of the Raven Queens history. The tome talked about a woman who was elevated to dignity by her elven followers, the Shadar-kai, in a time of conflict between the members of the Seldarine. The womans accession to godhood was to be down via a ritual that was interrupted by those who betrayed her. The Raven Queen killed the dissenters, but the ritual was interrupted. She and her followers were thrown across the planes by the ritual, ending up in the Shadowfell. The ritual and the transportation ended the Raven Queens life, but she rose from the ashes of her mortal shell. She was a god-like figure with black eyes and served by black ravens. She was the Raven Queen, Mistress of Life and Death.
