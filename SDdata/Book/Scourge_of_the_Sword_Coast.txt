}}The '''''Scourge of the Sword Coast''''' is a [[D&D Next]] adventure designed for 2nd-level characters. This adventure is the first part of the ''[[Adventurers League/Dreams of the Red Wizards|Dreams of the Red Wizards]]'' campaign, which continues with the ''[[Dead in Thay]]'' adventure.<ref>[[Tito Leati]], [[Matthew Sernett]] and [[Chris Sims]] (February 2014). ''[[Scourge of the Sword Coast]]''. ([[Wizards of the Coast]]), p. 2{{Quote|[[Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle]] ''chronicled the efforts of the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] to unlock the power of elemental nodes located in an abandoned temple dedicated to the Princes of Elemental Evil. A gate to the [[Nine Hells]] lay open for some time, spewing [[devil]]s and smoke. The heroes who closed the gate could not know it then, but amid the chaos of battle, another threat emerged.''

''Now, savage humanoids are raiding the countryside around [[Daggerford]], causing victims of their attacks to seek out the shelter of the town. Stressed from the weight of the refugees, it's up to a brave group of adventurers to end the raids and free Daggerford from its plight.''}}

==Summary==
Recent events caused the brief reactivation of the ''[[portal]]'' to [[Avernus]] in [[Dragonspear Castle]]. During that window of opportunity, the shade of the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]] reentered [[Faerûn]]. Baazka has allied himself with the Red Wizards of Thay whose plans for the [[Sword Coast]], although disrupted by the adventurers hired by [[Isteval|Sir Isteval]], continue regardless. Baazka has revealed a ''portal'' network to the Thayans that they hope to co-opt and use to bring a stream of reinforcements from their homeland. To prevent more setbacks caused by adventurers, Baazka's allies have tasked him to rouse the local monster population into raiding the countryside around Daggerford.

Refugees, fleeing from these raids, are now being turned away from Daggerford. A dwarven relic belonging to [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke Maldwyn]] has been stolen, which has infuriated him and placed Sir Isteval under suspicion in connection to the theft. Adventurers in Daggerford travel to various sites in the area, disrupting the plans of the Red Wizards until finally learning the location of the Thayan base - [[Bloodgate Keep]].
