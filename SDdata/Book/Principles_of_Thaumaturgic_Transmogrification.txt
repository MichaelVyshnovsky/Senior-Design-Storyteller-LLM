'''''Principles of Thaumaturgic Transmogrification''''' was a book on [[magic]] found in [[Faer√ªn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], but known to be ancient.

A copy was in the library of [[Bradda]]'s [[Sage's Shop]] in [[Neverwinter]]; this one had notes scrawled in the margins. When [[Elminster]] visited the city in [[1479 DR]] for the Protector's Jubilee, he asked an adventurer to covertly transcribe the notes on page 238 for him.
