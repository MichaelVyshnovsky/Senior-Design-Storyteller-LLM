        "''Ed Greenwood, who is synonymous with the Forgotten Realms, leads readers through a story that combines the rollicking fantasy adventure for which he is famous with a murder mystery-thriller.\n\nTHAT'S WHAT, FOUR LORDS DEAD?\n\nRevealed in death to have been Masked Lords, three more citizens had been murdered over the preceding day and night: the [[Sembian]] wine-seller and collector [[Oszbur Malankar]]; the [[half-elf]] sorceress and artisan [[Dathanscza Meiril]]; and the moneylender, landlord, and investor [[Ammasker Gwelt]].\n\nAll of Waterdeep now knew someone was killing the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], one by one. Yet that was about where truth ended and speculation--however plausible--began. The broadsheets were full of wild conjecture. Who's behind this? The ousted Lord [[Dagult Neverember]]? The [[Zhentarim]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] or some other Outland Power? [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|The Xanathar]]? Some cabal of guilds or nobles planning a coup?\n\nThe rumors would rage on, whether the [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]] did something or not. That was the trouble with rumors; once loosed, they roamed free like snarling, untamed beasts, with no simple way of stopping them. And all rumors aside, Waterdeep has become . . .\n\nA CITY OF MURDERERS!''\n|}}": "=Summary==",
