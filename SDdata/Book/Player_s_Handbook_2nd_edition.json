        "Description": "The ''Player's Handbook 2nd edition'' was designed to maintain compatibility with the rules of the 1{{st}} edition, while simultaneously streamlining and clarifying the content presented within. This edition categorizes the standard character classes into four broad groups: warriors (encompassing [[fighter]]s, [[paladin]]s, and [[ranger]]s), [[wizard]]s (inclusive of mages and specialist wizards like [[illusionist]]s), priests ([[cleric]]s, alongside guidelines for variations influenced by different mythologies, with [[druid]]s presented as a prime example), and [[rogue]]s ([[thieves]] and [[bard]]s). While the majority of character classes retained similarities to their counterparts in the 1{{st}} edition, notable adjustments were made to the bard class to align more closely with the standardized class structure, and the assassin and monk classes were omitted from this edition.\n\nTSR, Inc. also opted to exclude certain races from the 2{{nd}} edition, including [[half-orc]]s, reflecting a shift in the game's racial options. However, some of these races were reintroduced in subsequent supplemental materials, such as ''[[The Complete Book of Humanoids]]'', ensuring players retained access to a wide range of character creation choices. This evolution in the game's mechanics and options refined and enhanced the player experience, balancing the preservation of familiar elements with the introduction of streamlined processes and clarified rules.\n\nIn 1995, coinciding with TSR's 25th anniversary, an [[Player's Handbook 2nd edition (revised)|updated version]] of the ''Player's Handbook 2nd edition'' was published. This revised edition was expanded by sixty-four pages, primarily to alterations in the layout and the incorporation of new artwork. Furthermore, this edition included a new foreword clarifying that the book should not be considered as ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' 3{{rd}} edition, thereby setting expectations regarding its content and purpose within the continuity of the game's editions.\n\nThe ''Player's Handbook 2nd edition'' was reissued in a premium reprint on May 21, 2013.",
