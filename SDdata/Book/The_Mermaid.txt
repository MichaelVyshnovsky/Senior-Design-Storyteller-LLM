'''''"The Mermaid"''''' was a sailor's song about a [[mermaid]] and a doomed ship, performed and enjoyed in [[Faer√ªn]].The title of the song is unknown, but the lyrics are very closely derived from the real-world folk song "[[wikipedia:The Mermaid (ballad)|The Mermaid]]". The name of its real counterpart is used for convenience.

==History==
[[File:Beckside song.jpg|thumb|300px|''Lunasa (right) and Merlin (left) belting out the song, to no particular audience.'']]
The song was performed as a duet by the [[bard]] [[Lunasa Eveningwood]] and her companion [[Merlin Fastfoot]] while they stayed at [[Beckside Castle]] in [[Cormyr]] one night during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They also sang ''[[Here's a Health to the Company]]'' and ''[[The Crafty Maid's Policy]]'' together.

{{quote|''T'was Friday morn when we set sail,<br/>and we were not far from the land,<br/>when the captain, he spied a lovely mermaid,<br/>with a comb and a glass in her hand.<br/><br/>O the ocean's waves will roll,<br/>and the stormy winds will blow,<br/>while we poor sailors go skipping to the top,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below, below, below,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below.<br/><br/>And up spoke the captain of our gallant ship,<br/>and a well-spoken man was he,<br/>"I have me a wife in Salem by the sea,<br/>and tonight she a widow will be."<br/><br/>O the ocean's waves will roll,<br/>and the stormy winds will blow,<br/>while we poor sailors go skipping to the top,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below, below, below,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below.<br/><br/>And up spoke the cookie of our gallant ship,<br/>and a red hot cookie was he,<br/>saying, "I care much more for my pots and my pans,<br/>than I do for the bottom of the sea."<br/><br/>O the ocean's waves will roll,<br/>and the stormy winds will blow,<br/>while we poor sailors go skipping to the top,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below, below, below,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below.<br/><br/>Then up spoke the cabinboy, of our gallant ship,<br/>and a nasty little lad was he,<br/>"I'm not quite sure I can spell 'mermaid',<br/>but I'm going to the bottom of the sea."<br/><br/>O the ocean's waves will roll,<br/>and the stormy winds will blow,<br/>while we poor sailors go skipping to the top,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below, below, below,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below.<br/><br/>Then three times around went our gallant ship,<br/>and she sank to the bottom of the sea,<br/>Three times around went our gallant ship,<br/>and she sank to the bottom of the sea.<br/><br/>O the ocean's waves will roll,<br/>And the stormy winds will blow,<br/>While we poor sailors go skipping to the top,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below, below, below,<br/>and the landlubbers lie down below.''
