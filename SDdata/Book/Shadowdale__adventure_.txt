'''''Shadowdale''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure module for the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''.
{{quote|'''The Gods walk the Realms'''

''Cast out from their heavenly domain, the gods of the [[Forgotten Realms]] wander the land as mortals&mdash;extremely powerful mortals, to be certain, but mortals nonetheless. They seek the lost [[Tablets of Fate]], the key to their return. But as the good and evil gods of the Realms bring their fight down to earth, the people and lands are caught in between. Nature itself revolts: Strange creatures stalk the countryside, and even magic becomes unpredictable.''

''When a band of adventurers are hired by a young apprentice to rescue her sorceress-mentor, little do they realize the size of the stakes they will soon be playing for. Caught up in a power struggle that will determine the fate of the Realms themselves, the first step is to find the only mortal who may know what's going on&mdash;the legendary sage [[Elminster]]. And that means going to [[Shadowdale]].''

Shadowdale ''is the first of a three-part series of modules for the ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS<sup>&reg;</sup> 2nd Edition roleplaying game. Set in the popular FORGOTTEN REALMS&trade; game world, this module features the same settings and many of the same characters of the first novel of the [[Avatar series|Avatar Trilogy]], ''Shadowdale'', by [[Richard Awlinson]]. This AD&D<sup>&reg;</sup> 2nd Edition adventure is for four to six characters of levels 5-8.''}}

==Description==
''Shadowdale'' is the 1{{st}} book in the [[FRE series|Forgotten Realms Epic series]] and is designed for four to six characters of levels 5-8.

''Shadowdale'' is the first module in a trilogy of adventure modules that chronicles the turmoil known as the "[[Time of Troubles|Godswar]]". This trilogy aligns loosely with the events depicted in the [[Avatar series]] of novels. However, reading the novels is not required to enjoy or understand the adventure, and the events in the module are not exact replicas of those in the books.

Players are encouraged to use their own characters for this adventure, though several non-player characters (NPCs) will play crucial roles throughout. One NPC in particular, [[Midnight]], is essential to the story and must accompany the party for the adventure to progress and reach its conclusion.

This module is designed not only as the beginning of a trilogy but also as the potential foundation for a larger, long-term campaign. Each chapter outlines the intended flow of the story, but the module provides significant freedom for players to shape their actions amidst the chaos of the Godswar. The adventure encourages improvisation to make it more engaging and adaptable to the preferences of the players.

The flexibility of the adventure ensures that it can be easily integrated into an ongoing campaign set in the ''Forgotten Realms'', with room for personal touches and improvisation to suit the group's needs and enhance the overall experience.

==Synopsis==
The adventure begins in the city of [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]] amidst the "Fall" of the gods, causing magical and physical chaos throughout [[Faerûn]].

The PCs are approached by [[Caitlan Moonsong]], who seeks their help in rescuing her mistress from imprisonment by an evil force at [[Castle Kilgrave]]. They may be joined by the wizard Midnight, who is essential to the unfolding events. Caitlan falls ill and cannot accompany the group.

The PCs embark on a journey to Castle Kilgrave, facing challenges and dangers along the way. If they succeed, they rescue [[Mystra]]. If they fail, other NPC adventurers complete the task, and the PCs witness the next steps through Midnight’s pendant.

Mystra receives a pendant from Midnight and uses it to create a [[gate]] to the [[Ethereal Plane]], where she confronts [[Helm]]. Helm kills Mystra, highlighting the importance of the [[Tablets of Fate]]. The PCs are urged, through various signs, to take up the quest to recover the Tablets, and the DM introduces the idea that [[Elminster]] may hold crucial information about the quest.

The PCs travel to [[Shadowdale]], possibly seeking Elminster or following rumors of the Tablets. Along the way, they encounter adversaries such as the avatar of [[Bane]], the [[Zhentarim]], and other powerful factions.

In Shadowdale, the PCs meet Elminster, who reveals key information about the gods’ fall, Helm, and the importance of mortal action in the quest for the Tablets. The PCs explore the region and participate in defending Shadowdale when Zhentarim forces launch an attack.

The [[Temple of Lathander (Freedale)|Temple of Lathander]] in Shadowdale is attacked by Bane, leading to a confrontation involving Elminster, Mystra, and Bane. Their battle results in the apparent destruction of all three and severe damage to the temple.

The adventure ends temporarily with the PCs being captured by the angry inhabitants of Shadowdale. The DM determines the next steps based on whether the adventure will continue into the second module, ''[[Tantras (adventure)|Tantras]]'', or conclude with this event.
