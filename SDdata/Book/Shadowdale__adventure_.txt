Shadowdale is a 2-edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module for the Forgotten Realms.
Shadowdale is the 1 book in the Forgotten Realms Epic series and is designed for four to six characters of levels 5-8.
Shadowdale is the first module in a trilogy of adventure modules that chronicles the turmoil known as the "Godswar". This trilogy aligns loosely with the events depicted in the Avatar series of novels. However, reading the novels is not required to enjoy or understand the adventure, and the events in the module are not exact replicas of those in the books.
Players are encouraged to use their own characters for this adventure, though several non-player characters (NPCs) will play crucial roles throughout. One NPC in particular, Midnight, is essential to the story and must accompany the party for the adventure to progress and reach its conclusion.
This module is designed not only as the beginning of a trilogy but also as the potential foundation for a larger, long-term campaign. Each chapter outlines the intended flow of the story, but the module provides significant freedom for players to shape their actions amidst the chaos of the Godswar. The adventure encourages improvisation to make it more engaging and adaptable to the preferences of the players.
The flexibility of the adventure ensures that it can be easily integrated into an ongoing campaign set in the Forgotten Realms, with room for personal touches and improvisation to suit the groups needs and enhance the overall experience.
The adventure begins in the city of Arabel in Cormyr amidst the "Fall" of the gods, causing magical and physical chaos throughout Faerûn.
The PCs are approached by Caitlan Moonsong, who seeks their help in rescuing her mistress from imprisonment by an evil force at Castle Kilgrave. They may be joined by the wizard Midnight, who is essential to the unfolding events. Caitlan falls ill and cannot accompany the group.
The PCs embark on a journey to Castle Kilgrave, facing challenges and dangers along the way. If they succeed, they rescue Mystra. If they fail, other NPC adventurers complete the task, and the PCs witness the next steps through Midnight’s pendant.
Mystra receives a pendant from Midnight and uses it to create a gate to the Ethereal Plane, where she confronts Helm. Helm kills Mystra, highlighting the importance of the Tablets of Fate. The PCs are urged, through various signs, to take up the quest to recover the Tablets, and the DM introduces the idea that Elminster may hold crucial information about the quest.
The PCs travel to Shadowdale, possibly seeking Elminster or following rumors of the Tablets. Along the way, they encounter adversaries such as the avatar of Bane, the Zhentarim, and other powerful factions.
In Shadowdale, the PCs meet Elminster, who reveals key information about the gods’ fall, Helm, and the importance of mortal action in the quest for the Tablets. The PCs explore the region and participate in defending Shadowdale when Zhentarim forces launch an attack.
The Temple of Lathander in Shadowdale is attacked by Bane, leading to a confrontation involving Elminster, Mystra, and Bane. Their battle results in the apparent destruction of all three and severe damage to the temple.
The adventure ends temporarily with the PCs being captured by the angry inhabitants of Shadowdale. The DM determines the next steps based on whether the adventure will continue into the second module, Tantras, or conclude with this event.
