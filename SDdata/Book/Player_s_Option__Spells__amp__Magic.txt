==Description==
''Player's Option: Spells & Magic'' focuses on the intricacies of magical elements within ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''. This 192-page guide is structured into an introduction, eight chapters, and four appendices, each crafted to enhance the magical framework of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' campaigns.

The introduction provides essential guidance on incorporating the book's content into existing campaigns, emphasizing the roles of magic's power, rarity, and narrative function. It serves as a foundational overview for Dungeon Masters to seamlessly integrate new magical elements.

Chapter one and two explore the magical realms of wizards and priests respectively. These chapters revisit and slightly modify the existing spell lists, explore wizard schools and priest spheres of access, introduce some new specialist classes, and expand upon the customized rules for character classes introduced in ''[[Player's Option: Skills & Powers]]''. Chapter three examines other spellcasting classes including [[bard]]s, [[ranger]]s, and [[paladin]]s. It presents optional abilities, limitations for these classes, and discusses the magical capabilities of multi-classed characters and magic-using monsters.

Chapter four contrasts the traditional proficiency slot system with the character point rules from ''Player's Option: Skills & Powers'', introducing new proficiencies specific to wizards and priests. This chapter also introduces "signature spells" which provide bonuses to wizards when casting their chosen spell. Chapter five focuses on the equipment essential for spellcasters, such as wizards' laboratories and priests' altars. It discusses the benefits and drawbacks of utilizing spell components, alongside rules for their acquisition and the operation of magic shops, including arcanists and apothecaries.

Chapter six presents alternative magic systems, offering diverse methods of spellcasting and magical interaction. Chapter seven extends and revises the methodologies for researching new spells and crafting magical items, providing a deeper and more flexible approach to magic creation. Finally, chapter eight introduces new regulations for spellcasting within combat scenarios, aiming to streamline and enrich magical engagements.

The appendices are rich with additional resources. They feature a compilation of new spells designed to expand the repertoire of both novice and veteran players, and provide exhaustive listings of wizard spells by school and priest spells by sphere, respectively, serving as comprehensive reference tools.
