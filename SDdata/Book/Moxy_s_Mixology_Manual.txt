'''''Moxy's Mixology Manual''''' was a book dedicated to the art of mixology and collecting numerous alcoholic drink recipes, penned sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Contents==
The reader could consider ''Moxy's'' to be a comprehensive guide to cocktails, despite its crass wording and the author's preference for the drinks made with [[gin]]-and-[[whiskey]]. The book also included recipes for [[vodka]], [[vermouth]], and [[rum]] and did not miss a chance to denigrate them as inferior. Lastly, the author recommended that readers never call themselves "mixologists," professional, or amateur; instead preferring the term "bartender." Moxy clearly thought that calling oneself a mixologist made one sound like a "pillock."

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Moxy's Mixology Manual'' could be found in the hands of the proprietors of [[The Singing Lute]] eatery in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].
