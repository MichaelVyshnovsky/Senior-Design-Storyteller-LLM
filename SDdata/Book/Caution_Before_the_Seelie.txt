Caution Before the Seelie was an anthropological and autobiographical work on the place of the Beastlands published sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
This exceedingly rare tome of lore was grimy and covered in dust with yellow feathers and tufts of black fur pressed between its pages. The book also contained a scroll of bestial communion that allowed a mage to scribe the sights of the Seelie summon deva spell.
Caution Before the Seelie was a collection of accounts of one unfortunate hin who, during a tour of the Beastlands, was forced into joining the Seelie Court. The book also collected lore on the Seelie Courts of summer, winter, and sarcastic octopus. However, the last one was not entirely accurate nor reliable.
