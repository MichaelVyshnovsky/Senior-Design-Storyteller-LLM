Maestro by R.A. Salvatore is the second book of the Homecoming series. It was released on April 5, 2016.
Demons abound in the Underdark surrounding Menzoberranzan after Gromph Baenres accidental summoning of Demogorgon to the drow city. Yvonnel Baenre, meanwhile, has advanced her magic and her bodys physical age forward by two decades as she plots to bring more chaos to Menzoberranzan. In Gauntlgrym, Catti-brie discovers that the ancient magic that seals in the primordial is weakening and so the Host Tower of the Arcane must be rebuilt. As she embarks on a task to bring together architects of a restored Host Tower, Jarlaxle requests Drizzts help in returning to Menzoberranzan with Artemis Entreri to rescue Dahlia, who remains in a perpetually confused state as Matron Mother of House DoUrden.
Back in Menzoberranzan, High Priestess Kiriy Xorlarrin plots alongside House Hunzrin and House Melarn to serve her own ends replace House DoUrden with a restored House Xorlarrin under her rule. As Jarlaxles party approaches Menzoberranzan, Drizzt is affected by the Faerzress and Yvonnels magic combined with the mind-powers of Kyorl Odran, leading Drizzt to believe his life since his near-death on Kelvins Cairn has all been a deception, similar to the way Wulfgar was deceived while in the clutches of the balor Errtu. 
On the surface, Catti-brie gathers allies in her quest to rebuild the Host Tower Archmage Gromph Baenre, wizard Penelope Harpell and her clan, Shadovar Lord Parise Ulfbinder, sorcerer Lady Avelyere, cloud giant Caecilia, copper dragon sisters Tazmikella and Ilnezhara, and later Kimmuriel Oblodra as ambassador to the illithid hive mind. Catti-brie has a spat with Gromph that ends with her displaying to him her increased magical powers. When the dwarves discover the Host Tower cannot be rebuilt the way they originally intended, Catti-brie consults with the primordial in order to discover a new, more arcane method of construction.
In Menzoberranzan, Jarlaxle and his party arrive at House DoUrden just as Kiriy enacts her plot and House DoUrden is overcome by House Hunzrin and House Melarn. However, the trio turns the tide, slaying half a dozen priestesses and sending Matron Mother Zhindia Melarn fleeing. The trio hurry to rescue Dahlia but are captured by Yvonnel, who has a devious task in mind. She keeps Jarlaxle, Entreri, and Dalia imprisoned, promising their freedom if Drizzt is willing to become Menzoberranzans — and Lolths — champion against Demogorgon. In a plan as complicated as it is devious, Drizzt serves as the conduit for the combined psionic powers of Kyorl Odran, Yvonnel Baenre, Gromph Baenre, Kimmuriel Oblodra, and the illithid hive mind, ultimately resulting in the defeat of Demogorgon. However, instead of freeing the captives, Yvonnel attempts to make Drizzt choose to sacrifice one of them for the others freedom. Drizzt refuses and Yvonnel, amused by the action, sets Jarlaxle, Entreri, and Dahlia free. Drizzt is not released until a tenday later after he has refused Yvonnels offer to make him king of Menzoberranzan. Instead, she sends him back to Catti-brie, whom he believes is a deception, with the expectation that Drizzt will kill her before realizing his error.
