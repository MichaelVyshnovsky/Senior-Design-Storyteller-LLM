Those who devoted themselves to the [[Faerûnian pantheon|gods of the Realms]] had many temples to visit, while those merely looking for were could find opportunity for employment all across the sprawling city. It was however the criminal element of the Gate, that was most prevalent throughout its many and varied neighborhoods.",
