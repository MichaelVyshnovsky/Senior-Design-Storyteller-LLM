==Synopsis==
The story followed Ondruu the Immortal, once a powerful [[elven]] war [[wizard]], now a [[ghost]] within [[Myth Drannor]]'s ''[[mythal]]''. The ghostly wizard communed with a group of adventurers and took them on a quick tour along the environs of the City of Song. He introduced them to other beings that dwelled within the ''mythal'' as well as told them of the recent invaders: the [[Cult of the Dragon]], led by [[Kya Mordrayn]], and an army of [[drow]] elves. The adventurers eventually met a grizzly end at the hands of an angry [[ormyrr]] and a war band of drow as they attempted to flee the accursed ruined city.
