It is the sword that fells the wicked, and the cloak that warms the indignant.|Excerpt from ''On Matters of Law and Justice.''}}",
        "Description": "The book began by defining the concepts of [[good]]ness and [[lawful]]ness. To be 'good', it said, was to be free from [[evil]] and to seek peace and strike out at wickedness. It said that the practice of upholding the law was to maintain order over chaos, but was not itself free from corruption. It was only the virtue of justice that remained of importance to the Order of the Gauntlet and its holy warriors. It was justice that was demanded by the deities [[Helm]], [[Hoar]], [[Torm]], and [[Tyr]].",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, there remained a copy of ''On Matters of Law and Justice'' in a tollhouse situated along the [[Risen Road]] on the [[Sword Coast]]."
