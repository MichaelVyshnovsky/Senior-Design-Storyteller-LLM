        "mainbody": "'''''Excavation of the Enclave of Nhalloth''''' was a [[book]] that documented an archeological expedition to the ruins of [[Nhalloth]], published sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''[[Elminster]] said Nhalloth was a wonder to behold when it floated in [[Faer√ªn]]'s sky. He was surely right. This [[Netherese]] enclave was once a jewel in the Empire of Magic, with towers that pierced the heavens. And yet it fell, just as all Netherese enclaves did, crashing down when [[Karsus' Folly]] ripped magic from the world. But even after it collapsed into the sea, its ruins still held a strange, twisted beauty.''|Excerpt from ''Excavation of the Enclave of Nhalloth''}}",
        "Content": "This journal was a collection of neatly penned research and diagrams of the archeological expedition to Nhalloth, after the formerly submerged ruins emerged from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] during the [[Spellplague]]. The book's author was a researcher who once excavated the ruins of [[Halruaa]]. When he heard rumors of the Sea of Fallen Stars' waters receding, Nhalloth was his next target. However, looters were the first on the scene, leaving little of value behind. Many of the conclave's valuables were stolen, and [[spellbook]]s were used to build campfires. However, not all ancient glory was lost. The author met a group of [[Shadovar]] pursuers of archeological knowledge. They agreed to work together in searching the ruins.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, several copies of ''Excavation of the Enclave of Nhalloth'' could be found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. One copy was stored in the basement of [[Baldur's Mouth]], and another one was sold by an aspiring writer and the shopkeep of [[The Bibliophile]] in the [[Lower City]], [[Nansi Gretta]]. Another copy was stored in the basement of the [[Arcane Tower]], a lone mage's tower in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Western Heartlands]]."
