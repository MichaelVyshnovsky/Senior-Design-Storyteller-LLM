        "mainbody": "Excavation of the Enclave of Nhalloth was a book that documented an archeological expedition to the ruins of Nhalloth, published sometime in the late 15 century DR.\nThis journal was a collection of neatly penned research and diagrams of the archeological expedition to Nhalloth, after the formerly submerged ruins emerged from the Sea of Fallen Stars during the Spellplague. The books author was a researcher who once excavated the ruins of Halruaa. When he heard rumors of the Sea of Fallen Stars waters receding, Nhalloth was his next target. However, looters were the first on the scene, leaving little of value behind. Many of the conclaves valuables were stolen, and spellbooks were used to build campfires. However, not all ancient glory was lost. The author met a group of Shadovar pursuers of archeological knowledge. They agreed to work together in searching the ruins.\nBy the , several copies of Excavation of the Enclave of Nhalloth could be found in the city of Baldurs Gate. One copy was stored in the basement of Baldurs Mouth, and another one was sold by an aspiring writer and the shopkeep of The Bibliophile in the Lower City, Nansi Gretta. Another copy was stored in the basement of the Arcane Tower, a lone mages tower in the Underdark beneath the Western Heartlands."
