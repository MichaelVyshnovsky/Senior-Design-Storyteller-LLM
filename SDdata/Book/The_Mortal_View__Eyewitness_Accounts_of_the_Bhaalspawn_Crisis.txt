'''''The Mortal View: Eyewitness Accounts of the Bhaalspawn Crisis''''' was a text written after the [[Bhaalspawn Crisis]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].<ref group="note">These books describe the events of the original [[Baldur's Gate series]], particularly ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'', ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'' and ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal]]''.

{{Quote|The Five tore Tethyr to pieces. I don't think anyone expected more Bhaalspawn showing up would fix the war that a pack of them started. Then again, they were all inclined to killing each other, eh? Good riddance.|''Excerpt from The Mortal View''.}}

==Description==
''The Mortal View: Eyewitness Accounts of the Bhaalspawn Crisis'' was a mass-produced tome of accounts. These books were cheaply made, which was apparent due to the poor-quality symbol of [[Bhaal]] printed on their fronts. The inside of the books were stamped with a guild seal from [[Baldur's Gate]].

The accounts in this compiled text covered the main chapters of the crisis, with accounts from (or with regards to) [[Candlekeep]], [[Nashkel]], [[Amn]], [[Athkatla]], [[Saradush]], and Baldur's Gate.

Such accounts differed in their takes on the crisis. There were hundreds of these accounts, for example:

*A particular contributor noted that [[Imoen]] would often cause trouble, and was accompanied by [[Abdel Adrian]]. The contributor was not surprised that [[Bhaal]]'s blood coursed through them.
*An Amnian mercenary stated that the crisis reminded him of [[Sarevok]], who was in league with the party that caused the [[Iron Crisis]]. He claimed that he never thought that Sarevok could be a [[Bhaalspawn]].
*A [[vampire]] loyal to [[Bodhi]] gave a distressed account, cursing both Bhaal and [[Irenicus]] in the process.
*A merchant of Saradush described how [[The Five]] wreaked havoc through [[Tethyr]] and made it clear that they hoped the Bhaalspawn were all dead.
*A [[Flaming Fist]] soldier gave his opinion on Bhaalspawn and would not comment further.
