{{Quote|''A kidnapped child...''

''A priest in distress...''

''A band of adventurers to the rescue...''

''Ruthless kidnappers have abducted the eight-year-old son of Reverend Judge [[Hykros Allumen]], [[Ravens Bluff]]'s reigning high priest of [[Tyr]]. You have been entrusted with the task of delivering the ransom - 500,000 gp worth of [[platinum]], magic, and jewels. Can you see it safely past all the greedy bandits trying to intercept you and take the treasure for themselves? And if you do, can you trust the kidnappers to return the stolen child? A tale of trust, betrayal, and revenge.''

''This classic tournament has been revised for use with the new ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff|City of Ravens Bluff]]'' sourcebook. It is adaptable for use in any low-level, mid-level, or high-level campaign.''}}

==Description==
''Kidnapped'' is set in [[Ravens Bluff]], where the players are tasked with solving the mystery of a high-profile kidnapping. The storyline is designed to be adaptable to various campaign settings, allowing Dungeon Masters the flexibility to integrate the module into their ongoing games without extensive modifications. The narrative begins with the players being enlisted, hired, or otherwise motivated to find and rescue a prominent individual or individuals who have been abducted by unknown forces.

The adventure focuses on non-combat skills and abilities, encouraging players to rely on wit, negotiation, and investigation rather than brute force. Throughout the adventure, players must gather clues, interact with various NPCs, and make decisions that affect the outcome of the story. The module provides detailed descriptions of locations, characters, and potential plot twists.

The adventure is structured to accommodate characters of a specified range of levels, ensuring that the challenges presented are appropriate for the party's abilities. This level range is carefully chosen to provide a balanced experience, offering sufficient challenge to engage experienced players while remaining accessible to those with less advanced characters.
