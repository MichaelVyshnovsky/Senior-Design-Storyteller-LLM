The ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' has been reorganized to be more user friendly. It features information on running a D&D game, adjudicating play, writing adventures, non-player characters (including non-player character classes), running a campaign, characters, magic items (including intelligent and cursed items, and artifacts), and a dictionary of special abilities and conditions. Changes have been made to the item creation rules and pricing, and prestige classes new to the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' are included (over 10 prestige classes). The revision includes expanded advice on how to run a campaign and instructs players on how to take full advantage of the tie-in D&D miniatures line.''\n\n* ''New characters''\n* ''10 new [[prestige classes]]''}}",
