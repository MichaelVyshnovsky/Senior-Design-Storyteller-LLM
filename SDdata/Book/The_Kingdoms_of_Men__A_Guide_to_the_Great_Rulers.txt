'''''The Kingdoms of Men: A Guide to the Great Rulers''''' was a book written by [[Eratharn]] of [[Candlekeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.

It was a compendium and celebration of the [[human]] rulers of various monarchies of [[Faerûn]].
{{quote|History shows that Faerûn has enjoyed many masters. The passing millennia first saw the domination of the [[creator race]]s give way to the hegemony of the [[dragon]]s. The fearsome dragons were then assailed by the might of the [[giant]]s. In turn, the [[elves]] and the [[dwarves]] gained the ascendancy and brought bright civilization to all corners of the Realms. Yet the passing of the years has seen that lowly and oft-despised race known as humankind achieve dominion over all others. The rise and fall of the great human kingdoms has defined the face of Faerûn in the modern era, and those great kingdoms have had rulers that were greater still. This is a compendium of the leaders of the humans. Read on in celebration of their name and legend.|From the introduction of ''The Kingdoms of Men''}}
