        "mainbody": "The tome of Suelivain was a book written by Suelivain, a shade of Thultanthar. In it he included his notes on shadow magic.\nSuelivain was dwelling in Thultanthar when a shadowstorm struck and he lost the tome of Suelivain and several other possessions. These were spread across the Plane of Shadow. Unbeknownst to him, however, a rift to the plane later deposited the tome and the rest of his things in the Halls of Demarch in the city of Tantras in Faer√ªn in or after 1358 DR.\nMembers of Demarchs Folly found the tome of Suelivain before 1374 DR and from it they learned the fundamentals of shadow magic. They tracked down Suelivain and returned his tome and other possessions in exchange for training in the ways of shadow magic."
