'''Azallah''' was the name of another world. It was accessible through the [[Source Stone]], but it is unknown if it is on the same [[Cosmology|plane of existence]] as [[Toril]].{{Speculation}}

==Geography==
Islands could be found across the planet, at least some of which floated above the bodies of [[water]] and bore cities. The elven city of [[Sahaladar]] was considered the greatest of the floating cities in all of Azallah. Beneath the waves were the underwater cities of the Kilm.

==Inhabitants==
Azallah was known to be home to [[elves]] and the [[Kilm]], an aquatic race. The two enjoyed friendly relations.

Among them were the [[paladin]] [[Asheera]] and the [[Shining Order]], who vowed to defended Sahaladar.

==History==
The world was considered peaceful by the paladin Asheera. But then the world was one of many invaded by [[Morag]] and her army of [[Old One|Old Ones]], who raided the cities.

Finally, the magicians of Sahaladar discovered a ''[[portal]]'' into the Source Stone, the [[demiplane]] from which the Old Ones originated. The elves of Sahaladar forged [[Asheera's amulet|an amulet]] that would protect against Morag and the Old Ones, and selected six heroes, among them Asheera, to go into the Source Stone and stop Morag.

But they failed in their quest, and only Asheera was left alive within the Source Stone. There, she encountered [[Hero of Neverwinter|a hero]] from [[Toril]] on a similar mission in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. She granted this hero the amulet to carry on her quest.
