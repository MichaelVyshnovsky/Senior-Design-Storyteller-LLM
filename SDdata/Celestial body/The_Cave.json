        "Geography": "The Cave was located near the center of the cluster. The entire surface of the asteroid was covered in a grass-like vegetation. In the underside of the rock there was a large cavern that served as a docking port for the ''Batship'', as well as a base where plunder collected by the ship's crew was stored before being sold.",
        "Defenses": "The ''Batship'' would promptly jump to protect its lair and prevent it from being located."
