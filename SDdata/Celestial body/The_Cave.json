        "mainbody": "The Cave was a small asteroid in the Tears of Sel√ªne. It was the lair and base of the Batship.\nThe Cave was located near the center of the cluster. The entire surface of the asteroid was covered in a grass-like vegetation. In the underside of the rock there was a large cavern that served as a docking port for the Batship, as well as a base where plunder collected by the ships crew was stored before being sold.\nThe Batship would promptly jump to protect its lair and prevent it from being located."
