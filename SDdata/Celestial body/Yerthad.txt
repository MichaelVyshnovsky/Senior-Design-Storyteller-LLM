'''Yerthad''' was one of the twelve moons of [[Garden]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
Like most of Garden's moons, Yerthad was larger than its parent. In fact, it was two size categories larger, with a diameter of {{SI|395|mi|k|long=yes}}. It was a spherical body.

Yerthad was notable for having an extremely poisonous atmosphere that was also very thick. The surface of the moon was covered with a sea of [[wikipedia:Sulfuric acid|vitriol]], and fumes from the [[acid]] rose to an altitude of about {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}}.
