Harkaum was a little-known planet in an unknown crystal sphere.
Harkaum was dominated by large continents and long strings of islands in between. The continents were primarily covered in mountains and jungles.
Harkaums primary inhabitants were "savage" elves that dwelled in the jungles and on the islands, and humans that lived in widely spaced enclaves of cleared farmland in the jungles. The elves and humans were largely opposed to each other.
Dragons were once numerous, acting as the rulers/owners of the (then enslaved) human enclaves, but they eventually died off.
There were a handful of human liches native to Harkaum, as well as bound liches sent by Larloch from Toril the liches took over ruling the human enclaves after the dragons extirpation from Harkaum.
Monsters were known to inhabit the jungles and islands as well.
The humans, under the instructions of the dragons, made all manner of magical items from dragon scales, blood, fangs, etc., but the supply of materials for such items vanished when the dragons died off.
The process of becoming a lich on Harkaum required dragon brains.
After the liches sent by Larloch took over, they put the humans to work creating new magical items and crafting new spells.
The humans of Harkaum were slaves of the dragons for millennia, raised and trained from birth to farm and craft for the dragons. After the dragons died out, at some point liches sent by Larloch came, "tamed" the few native Harkounan liches, and took over the human enclaves for Larlochs purposes, putting the humans to work again.
