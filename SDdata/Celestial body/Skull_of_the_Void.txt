The '''Skull of the Void''' was a free-standing body floating at a fixed position in [[Realmspace]].

==Geography==
The Skull was located about {{SI|50000000|miles|k|long=yes}} from the [[crystal sphere]] of Realmspace and was always in a stationary position. It was {{SI|12|miles|k|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|10|miles|k|long=yes}} wide and was shaped exactly like a [[human]] skull. The enormous structure appeared to be made of bone, but it quickly regenerated itself if damaged in any way. It also kept constantly refreshing its own air supply.

==Inhabitants==
The hollow object was inhabited by a colony of [[mind flayer]]s that secretly kept about 100 [[beholder]]s of seven different subspecies as cattle. The beholders had their eye stalks constantly removed and their central eyes branded by their illithid owners in order to prevent them from using their abilities and to keep them blind. Since beholders and illithids had established collaborating efforts elsewhere, the existence of this experiment was a well-guarded secret.

The illithids used their beholder cattle to conduct breeding experiments in an attempt to develop their immense brains as trading commodities. After several generations of consuming beholder brains, by the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] the Skull's inhabitants developed the capability to ''[[levitate]]''. This ability was viewed with envy by other illithids, but the Skull's breeders had incorporated them into their genetic makeup, so all their descendants from that point on were also capable of ''levitating''.
