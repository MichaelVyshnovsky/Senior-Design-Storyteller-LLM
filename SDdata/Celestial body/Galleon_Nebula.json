        "mainbody": "The '''Galleon Nebula''' was a large nebula in [[Realmspace]]. It appeared like a multicolored [[galleon]] ship. In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was visible from [[Toril]] during autumn and early winter.",
        "Geography": "The Galleon was a huge multicolored cloud about 2 million miles (3.2 million km) long and tall and over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) wide.\n\nIt orbited the Torilian solar system in a very slow orbit, taking over 4,000 months to complete a full revolution. The nebula shared its orbit with the [[Color Spray Nebula]], but in the opposite position, so the two were never simultaneously visible from Toril.\n\nThe entire nebula was a [[wild magic]] region that wreaked havoc on [[spelljammer]] ships. It caused ships' gravity planes to shift quickly and unpredictably and caused [[magic item]]s on board to buzz in a deafening tone. Once the ships left the nebula, these effects immediately ceased.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Astrologers from Toril believed that the nebula had been placed in the sky by the [[deity|deities]] of [[magic]], both as a sign informing the inhabitants of Toril of the existence of spelljamming technology and as a sign of their blessing for its use. On the other hand, more isolationist astrologers believed that the nebula's wild magic properties served as a warning about the dangers of space travel."
