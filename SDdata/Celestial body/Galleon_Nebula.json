        "mainbody": "he Galleon Nebula was a large nebula in Realmspace. It appeared like a multicolored galleon ship. In the mid-14 century DR, it was visible from Toril during autumn and early winter.\nThe Galleon was a huge multicolored cloud about 2 million miles (3.2 million km) long and tall and over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) wide.\nIt orbited the Torilian solar system in a very slow orbit, taking over 4,000 months to complete a full revolution. The nebula shared its orbit with the Color Spray Nebula, but in the opposite position, so the two were never simultaneously visible from Toril.\nThe entire nebula was a wild magic region that wreaked havoc on spelljammer ships. It caused ships gravity planes to shift quickly and unpredictably and caused magic items on board to buzz in a deafening tone. Once the ships left the nebula, these effects immediately ceased.\nAstrologers from Toril believed that the nebula had been placed in the sky by the deities of magic, both as a sign informing the inhabitants of Toril of the existence of spelljamming technology and as a sign of their blessing for its use. On the other hand, more isolationist astrologers believed that the nebulas wild magic properties served as a warning about the dangers of space travel."
