Dragon Rock was one of the twelve moons of Garden in Realmspace.
Like most of Gardens moons, Dragon Rock was larger than its parent, being about  and  wide. It was bizarrely shaped like a white dragon and was composed entirely of white jade.
The slight atmosphere of Dragon Rock smelled like pipe smoke.
The moon was inhabited by an evil wizard known as Darkon of the Earths Depths, who was also responsible for the creation of the moon. He built the massive structure to observe and study Garden.
