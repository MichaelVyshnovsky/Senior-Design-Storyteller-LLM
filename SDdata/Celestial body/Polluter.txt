Polluter was a satellite of the moon Mingabwe and also considered one of Glyths three moons.
Polluter was a spherical size-A earth body, The tiny, rocky worldlet was covered in craters from meteor strikes. Frozen water could be found on its surface, but it had no atmosphere at all. The surface or interior had never been mapped out or mined.
The paladin Justin Demonslayer, a former space pirate and resident of Mingabwe, abandoned two of his former magical items somewhere on Polluter so that they could no longer be used for evil.
