Sretsam was one of the countless worlds on the Prime Material plane. It was home to a powerful Magi member of the Order of the Eternals, Lady Morgandella the Mighty.
In the late 14 century DR, the Order of the Eternals, a trans-dimensional guild for magic-users of impressive power, elected to hold its 1,238 annual Symposium in the city of Ravens Bluff on the world of Toril, in order to secretly investigate its unusually high levels of magical energies and planar incursions. The Symposiums attendees included Magi Morgandella the Mighty. During the Symposium, Lady Morgandella held the plenary lecture titled Toward an Understanding of the Mechanisms Leading to the Creation of the Draco-Lich.
