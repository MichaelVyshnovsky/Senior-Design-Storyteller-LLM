'''Sunson''' was one of the twelve moons of [[Garden]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
Like most of Garden's moons, Sunson was larger than its parent, with a diameter of {{SI|200|mi|k|long=yes}}. Sunson was a ball of blue [[fire]].

Sunson glowed nearly twice as hot as [[the sun]]—though it was orders of magnitude smaller—and acted as a source of light to those living on Garden. Heat from the moon kept the void of [[wildspace]] warm for a thousand miles (1,600 kilometers).
