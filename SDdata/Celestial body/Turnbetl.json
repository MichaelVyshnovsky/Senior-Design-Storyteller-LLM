        "mainbody": "'''Turnbetl''' was the largest and closest satellite of [[H'Catha]], the farthest planet from the [[the sun|Sun]] in [[Realmspace]].",
        "Geography": "The spherical moon orbited H'Catha along the plane of the flat disc in a very eccentric orbit, with a perigee distance of {{SI|11500|mi|k|long=yes}} and an apogee of {{SI|413000|mi|k|long=yes}}.\n\nThe moon's atmosphere was extremely unstable, composed of highly reactive gases that immediately exploded upon contact with oxygen. The typical atmosphere of a medium-sized [[spelljammer]] could produce an explosion several times stronger than a ''[[fireball]]'' cast by an experienced [[wizard]]â€•enough to be decidedly lethal.",
        "Defenses": "Due to the extremely dangerous nature of Turnbetl, it was recommended that the moon be kept in quarantine so travelers did not approach it."
