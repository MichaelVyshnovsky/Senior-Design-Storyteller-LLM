        "mainbody": "Mystara was a planet located in an unknown crystal sphere, carefully hidden from the rest of the multiverse, and yet was numbered among the worlds best known throughout the multiverse.\nThe planet of Mystara was orbited by two moons, a visible one known as Matera and an invisible one known as Myoshima. And the Wildspace of their crystal sphere differed from others in that it was extremely cold.\nA good deal of portals and other planar accesses existed on Mystara, yet its inhabitants werent as active across the multiverse compared to the inhabitants of Oerth and Toril. They rarely left their home world for long, viewing other planes as places unsuitable for long-term habitation.\nMystarans conceived of the multiverse as being governed by what they called Spheres of Power. There were five of these Spheres of Power &mdash Energy, Entropy, Matter, Time, and Thought.\nEach of the spheres was associated with a particular alignment and element. Matter was associated with lawfulness and earth, Energy with chaos and fire, Time with neutrality and water, and Thought was associated with all alignments and the element of air. Entropy was the outlier, not being associated with anything but destruction and stood in opposition to all the other spheres.\nMystarans believed that the Prime Material plane was the only plane of existence in which all five of the Spheres of Power were perfectly blended in proportions that were precisely equal. They also believed that this was the case with the four fundamental elements. In their eyes, every other plane contained some imbalance of the elements, the spheres, or both. And like many worlds on the Prime, the people of Mystara viewed their planet as the center of the multiverse.\nMystarans also believed mortal magic was governed by four of the five spheres (not Entropy).\nthumb|455x455px\nThe planet Mystara was spherical in shape, though some of its inhabitants believed it to be flat. but its gravity was the same due to a layer of magic molten rock that ran through its core. Known as the Worldshield by immortals, it produced a gravitational field that pulled things towards it from both directions and gave off a dead-magic zone that stretched  out from it. Additionally, Mystaras continental positions were similar to an ancient landmass on Earth known as Pangea. The major landmass on its surface was referred to by Mystarans as the Known World, which was part of a larger continent known as Brun.\nMystaras atmosphere extended up to  and maintained the same pressure throughout, though oxygen levels would deplete at higher altitudes. which was a common facet of planets within Mystaras crystal sphere. The skyshield kept the planets atmosphere in and anything larger than a horse that tried to breach into Wildspace would be slowly deflected as they neared it, though objects entering the skyshield from the outside did not experience this same resistance.\nWithin this crystal sphere it resided, in the world was hidden by incredibly powerful magics, what Mordenkainen referred to as a gap or \"metaphysical missing\" within Wildspace. Any attempts from at scrying the world, or trying to view it through such means as modified arcane eyes, would alert the worlds Immortals. Whether this defensive magic was set up by the Immortals themselves or a precursor race of gods was unknown.\nSome believed the planet to be a living entity,This is not mentioned in later Mystaran sourcebooks, but it is never outright contradicted. what the planetary scholars of Shou Lung would classify as a rare live world, and that the worlds Immortals had to make special arrangements with it before they could cultivate life both on its surface and within its Hollow World.\nUnlike the Calendar of Harptos, which marked its months based on 30-day lunar cycle periods and years totaling 365 days, the major calendar used by the people of this world had only 336 days and had its months based on a lunar cycle of 28-days.\nThe interior of Mystara was hollow,\nDue to a combination of the Spell of Preservation and the Worldshield, a number of spells or forms of magic would not function within the Hollow World. These included divination and summoning. Spells of communication like commune, contact other plane, and ESP. Spells of instantaneous transportation like dimension door, gate, teleport, teleport without error, and word of recall.\nThere were enormous openings to this Hollow World at the north and south poles of Mystara, measuring , through which its motionless sun radiated light out from. They were rarely ever traversed due to both having freezing cold temperatures, perpetually stormy weather, and (due to the Worldshield) a  thick zone of dead-magic. Notably, lodestones always pointed towards the center of the nearest polar opening.\nMuch like the planet Athas, Mystara completely lacked deities,  through the visitations of many planewalkers the existence of deities was known to many Mystarans. Instead, the planet had mortals that raised themselves to an equivalent status, becoming beings known as Immortals. Many cultures in the Known World worshiped the same Immortals.\nLike deities, the Immortals had their own divine realms. Unlike traditional deities, they could not create Immortal offspring any pairing between an Immortal and a mortal resulted in a mortal child.\nEach Immortal was associated with one of the five Spheres of Power\nThe Immortals had little concern for worlds outside their own, including the world of Toril. One exception to this was the Immortal known as Kagyar, who engaged in activities on a variety of planes across the multiverse.\nSome from other worlds, such as the planewalker Mordenkainen, viewed the Immortals as paranoid and powermongers. However, though comparisons could be made between the Immortals and gods, some recognized there were distinct differences in their power. Mordenkainen once speculated that, if the Immortals were to ever focus on expanding their influence beyond Mystara, their powers could grow to catastrophic heights.\nBy chance, some of Mystaras Immortals had names similar to those of deities across the multiverse, as sometimes deities in different crystal spheres came to have the same name by pure chance. In other cases across the multiverse, there were some deities who purposely adopted the moniker of one from another crystal sphere because it was consistently found to invoke awe, respect, or terror in mortals.\nFor example, the people of the Northern Reaches worshiped a pantheon whose members included Immortals with the same names as the Norse deities Freyja, Loki, Odin, and Thor. Though some speculated whether or not Odin was in reality the same Odin that was worshiped on many other worlds, simply masquerading as an Immortal.\nSome of the Immortal patrons of humanoids also shared names with monstrous deities &mdash Bartziluth, patron of bugbears, was also known as Hruggek Jammudaru, patron of ogres, was also known as Vaprak and Ranivorus, patron of gnolls, was also known as Yeenoghu in the gnollish tribal dialect.\nThree odd outliers were the Immortals Karaash, The Shining One, and Wogar &mdash the patrons of orcs, kobolds, and goblins respectively. The three of them were once mortals by the names of Illneval, Kurtulmak and Maglubiyet. Coincidentally, Ilneval, Kurtulmak, and Maglubiyet were also the names of deities respectively worshiped by orcs, kobolds, and goblins on other worlds.\nThe planet Mystara was originally created by ancient god-race known only as the \"Old Ones\", fashioned from the raw elementals forces of the Inner Planes. Once their work was complete, they mysteriously vanished. Over the eons that would follow the Immortals would strive to keep their world hidden from outside forces, though ultimately many gods, archdevils, and demon lords would find their way to Mystara.\nThroughout Mystaras history, much like Krynn and Oerth, its astronomical and astrological records commonly featured phenomena that were caused by either magic or Immortals.\nMembers of the mercantile halfling family Minstrelwish traveled between their home planet of Toril and Mystara on a number of occasions.\nIn a region known as the Northern Reaches, a Northman by the name of Ulf the Mad and his pet winter wolf Raffskjarl became seperated from their hunting party one day after a fight with enormous remorhaz named Dodzorm. Left as the only survivors, the injured Ulf was dragged by his faithful wolf to one of the polar openings of the world. There he came face to face with the \"Lord of Death\", who in an effort to claim his soul wrestled Ulf to mutual exhaustion and challenged him to an ale drinking competition. The Lord of Death was ultimately bested by the Northman, who then made his way home and inscribed his encounter through scrimshaw upon the bones of a white dragon.\nAt some point the planeswalker Mordenkainen stumbled upon the world, having to devise a modified arcane eye to begin scrying upon it. and gave an explanation as to his scholarly pursuits. This managed to appease the Immortal, who then welcomed Mordenkainen in to show off the world of Mystara and all it had to offer,\nMordenkainen would end up staying on Mystara for several years, exploring the depths of its Hidden World, after having been discovered one of the two enormous polar openings by following the legend of Ulf the Mad.\nSome time in the 14 century DR, an Immortal by the name of Kagyar reached beyond his native world and contacted a dwarf on Toril by the name of Norin Bonebreaker. He granted the man a limited list of clerical spells and tasked him with helping the unfortunate, but only in secrecy.\nDuring that same century, a giff by the name of Captain Blotomus landed a hammership on Mystara and picked up some adventurers to help him in rescuing his former crew from pirates led by a neogi named Raver. After Blotomus discovered some of the neogis hobgoblin crew on an asteroid&mdashleft stranded there for having attempted a mutiny&mdashand interrogated them, he learned that Raver was sailing to the Rock of Bral in Realmspace.\nYears later, Volothamp Geddarm visited this worlds continent of Brun.\nAalban A principality of Glantri that was known for its artificers and machine makers.\nAtruaghin Plateau A large isolated plateau in the western region of the Known World that was the homeland of the Atruaghin people.\nBelcadiz A principality of elves and humans in Glantri that produced some of the finest metalsmiths in the Known World.\nBroken LandsA desolate stretch of land near the center of the Known World by their hatred of dwarves, elves, and humans.\nColony Isles An archipelago controlled by the Minrothad Guilds, an organized coalition of seagoing merchants. The largest landmass in this archipelago, Traders Island, had a mountain with a planar gate that could take one to Toril, Oerth, and other worlds.\nCynidicea An ancient subterranean city, that housed an elder evil known as Zargon. According to some planar accounts, both resided beneath the Giants Belt Mountains of Toril rather than this planet.\nEthengar A large grass plain nation.\nThe Five Shires The homeland of this worlds halflings. Underneath a mountain range in this region, known as the Black spires, there existed a persistent portal to the northeastern reaches of Torils halfling homeland Luiren. The gate was well hidden and may have potentially been destroyed at some point.\nGlantri A powerful, though eccentric, magocratic nation northwest of Karameikos. Both the planeswalkers Mordenkainen and Elminster visited this nation, with the Torilian wizard having a much briefer visitation, only coming to retrieve a magical item that had been stolen from him and was met with violence along the way.\nKarameikos A very young kingdom on the southern coast of Brun.\nNorthern Reaches A region in the northernmost reaches of the Known World that consisted of three independent countries. These kingdoms and jarldoms were home to barbarian clans of humans known as the Northmen.\nRockhome The homeland of this worlds dwarves.\nSavage Coast A region west of the Known World, that was notable for being the only place on Mystara where one could find firearms.\nSerraine A flying city constructed and inhabited by gnomes, as well as other flying creatures.\nThis section is primarily tailored to listing creatures that originated from the Mystara setting or those incredibly common between it and other settings, such as the demihuman races.\nAtruaghinA tribal human culture divided into five clans, each guided by a chief advised by shamani, Some of the Atruaghins more powerful shamani were capable of entering the Ethereal Plane and through it visit other worlds. Most often, their shamani were attuned to places like Maztica. Anyone accompanying a shamani or sent by one to another world usually seemed to phase out of some animal when entering the other.\nBeholdersThe beholders on this world were slightly smaller than those of Toril. They tended to have brown or green mottled skin. Their tentacles measured  in length, were unsegmented, and sported eyes the size of a humans.\nDwarvesUnlike the dwarves of Toril, which credited their creation to the deity Moradin, the dwarves of Mystara were created by an Immortal known as Kagyar. They often got along well with the gnomes and halflings on this planet, as they had similar drives and characteristics.\nEthengar A human culture consisting of a loose confederation of nomadic tribes ruled by a great khan. Much like the Atruaghin, some of Ethengars more powerful shamans were capable of entering the Ethereal Plane and through it visit other worlds. Most often, their shamans were attuned to places like the Plain of Horses. Anyone accompanying a shamani or sent by one to another world usually seemed to phase out of some animal when entering the other.\nGem dragonsThere were a variety of gem dragons that were unique to Mystara, though one that it shared with Toril was the ruby dragon.\nFachanAn unusual variety of ogre-descended creatures found in the Savage Coast. Like the fachan of Toril, the fachan of Mystara loomed at a height of .\n HalflingsGenerally known as the hin, they were a bright, adventurous, and intelligent people who generally strove for peace.\nHumanoidsThe humanoids on this planet consisted in part of bugbears, goblins, gnolls, hobgoblins, kobolds, ogres, orcs, and trolls. Each of them had two to three distinct subraces. All of these humanoids could be found in the Broken Lands, though trolls and nomadic clans of gnolls could also be found in the Northern Reaches, in the Trollheim Hills and Gnollheim Hills respectively.\nLupinsA race of canine-like humanoids that were unique to this world. They were somewhat similar in appearance to werewolves, but were in fact wholly unrelated and despised them, sometimes to the point of hunting them down. There were no widely known instances of lupins appearing on Toril, though it wasnt considered impossible that some may have planeswalked between the worlds.\nThri-kreensThese insectoid humanoids were unheard of in the Known World, but small packs of them could be found in an area of the Savage Coast known as the Yazak Steppes.\nTortlesA race of humanoid tortoises. Unlike the tortles of Torils Chultan Peninsula, the tortles of Mystara had a marine offshoot, known as \"snappers.\" These were broader and larger in size, well adapted for swimming with webbed hands and feet, and couldnt hide within their streamlined shells.\nPegataursA race of winged centaurs that were unique to this world.\nRakastaa race of intelligent catlike humanoids related to rakshasas. They were native to this world, but some could be found inhabiting the Vast on Toril.\nVelyas A race of aquatic vampires that had once been surface dwelling humanoids until they were stricken by an ancient curse.\nWerejaguars A variety of lycanthrope found in the tropical rain forests of Mystara.\nWereswinesA variety of lycanthrope that could be found on Mystara and were once sighted on Toril.\nWyrdsA type of undead with strong connections to the Positive Energy plane, created from evil spirits possessing the bodies of dead elves. Instances of them were found in the Vast region of Toril in use by the drow of Nycathandar.\n*Rudolph Van Richten, renowned monster hunter, owned a map of the Known World that he kept within his study in his herbalist shop in the Domains of Dread."
