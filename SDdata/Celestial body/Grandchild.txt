'''Grandchild''' was one of the twelve moons of [[Garden]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
Like most of Garden's moons, Grandchild was larger than its parent, but there was confusion about its size and shape. Astronomical records indicated that it was spherical, yet its dimensions were listed as {{SI|45|mi|k|long=yes}} by {{SI|13|mi|k|long=yes}}, indicating rather an ellipsoid.<ref group="note" name="shape" /> Its surface was perfectly smooth, with no craters from [[meteor]] strikes at all. It had an eerie off-white color.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was widely believed that, when [[Yggdrasil's Child (Garden)|Yggdrasil's Child]], the gargantuan plant holding together the asteroids of Garden, died, a new plant would appear with some connection to the moon Grandchild.<ref group="note">One potential theory is that the moon is a seed from Yggdrasil's Child, but no further suggestions are provided in the source material.
