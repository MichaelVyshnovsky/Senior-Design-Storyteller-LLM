Grandchild was one of the twelve moons of Garden in Realmspace.
Like most of Gardens moons, Grandchild was larger than its parent, but there was confusion about its size and shape. Astronomical records indicated that it was spherical, yet its dimensions were listed as  by , indicating rather an ellipsoid. Its surface was perfectly smooth, with no craters from meteor strikes at all. It had an eerie off-white color.
It was widely believed that, when Yggdrasils Child, the gargantuan plant holding together the asteroids of Garden, died, a new plant would appear with some connection to the moon Grandchild.One potential theory is that the moon is a seed from Yggdrasils Child, but no further suggestions are provided in the source material.
