'''Mystara''' was a planet located in an unknown [[crystal sphere]], carefully hidden from the rest of the [[multiverse]], and yet was numbered among the worlds best known throughout the multiverse.

{{Quote|Mystara is strange, beautiful, and a testament to the sheer variety of worlds in the multiverse. . . . Every time I visit Mystara, I can't help but wonder at how it works and the minds that came together to fashion this marvel from the elemental forces of the [[Inner Planes]]. But this world in particular has strange origins and an even stranger design, which leads me to wonder if there is some reason why Mystara is the way it is.|[[Mordenkainen]]}}

==Cosmography==
The planet of Mystara was orbited by two moons, a visible one known as Matera and an invisible one known as Myoshima.<ref> And the [[Wildspace]] of their crystal sphere differed from others in that it was extremely cold.<ref>
===Portals & Gateways===
A good deal of [[portal]]s and other planar accesses existed on Mystara, yet its inhabitants weren't as active across the multiverse compared to the inhabitants of [[Oerth]] and [[Toril]]. They rarely left their home world for long,<ref> viewing other [[plane]]s as places unsuitable for long-term habitation.
===Spheric Worldview===
Mystarans conceived of the multiverse as being governed by what they called Spheres of Power. There were five of these Spheres of Power &mdash; '''Energy''', '''Entropy''', '''Matter''', '''Time''', and '''Thought'''.

Each of the spheres was associated with a particular [[alignment]] and element. Matter was associated with [[law]]fulness and [[earth (element)|earth]], Energy with [[chaos]] and [[fire]], Time with [[neutral]]ity and [[water]], and Thought was associated with all alignments and the element of [[air]]. Entropy was the outlier, not being associated with anything but destruction and stood in opposition to all the other spheres.

Mystarans believed that the [[Prime Material plane]] was the only plane of existence in which all five of the Spheres of Power were perfectly blended in proportions that were precisely equal. They also believed that this was the case with the four fundamental elements. In their eyes, every other plane contained some imbalance of the elements, the spheres, or both. And like many worlds on the Prime, the people of Mystara viewed their planet as the center of the multiverse.

Mystarans also believed mortal [[magic]] was governed by four of the five spheres (not Entropy).

==Geography==
[[File:Mordy Mystara.png|thumb|''[[Mordenkainen]]'s visit to the world of Mystara.''|455x455px]]
The planet Mystara was spherical in shape, though some of its inhabitants believed it to be flat. but its gravity was the same due to a layer of [[magic]] molten rock that ran through its core. Known as the Worldshield by immortals, it produced a gravitational field that pulled things towards it from both directions and gave off a [[dead-magic zone]] that stretched {{SI|300|miles}} out from it. Additionally, Mystara's continental positions were similar to an ancient landmass on Earth known as [[Wikipedia:Pangea|Pangea]]. The major landmass on its surface was referred to by Mystarans as the Known World, which was part of a larger continent known as Brun.

Mystara's atmosphere extended up to {{SI|80000|miles}} and maintained the same pressure throughout, though oxygen levels would deplete at higher altitudes. which was a common facet of planets within Mystara's crystal sphere. The skyshield kept the planet's atmosphere in and anything larger than a [[horse]] that tried to breach into Wildspace would be slowly deflected as they neared it, though objects entering the skyshield from the outside did not experience this same resistance.

Within this crystal sphere it resided, in the world was hidden by incredibly powerful magics, what [[Mordenkainen]] referred to as a gap or "metaphysical missing" within Wildspace. Any attempts from at [[scrying]] the world, or trying to view it through such means as modified ''[[arcane eye]]s'', would alert the world's Immortals. Whether this defensive magic was set up by the Immortals themselves or a precursor race of gods was unknown.

Some believed the planet to be a living entity,<ref group="note" name="living">This is not mentioned in later Mystaran sourcebooks, but it is never outright contradicted. what the planetary scholars of [[Shou Lung]] would classify as a rare [[live world]], and that the world's Immortals had to make special arrangements with it before they could cultivate life both on its surface and within its Hollow World.
=== Calendar===
Unlike the [[Calendar of Harptos]], which marked its months based on 30-day lunar cycle periods and years totaling 365 days, the major calendar used by the people of this world had only 336 days and had its months based on a lunar cycle of 28-days.{{Cite dragon/123/Just Making Time}}
===Hollow World ===
The interior of Mystara was hollow,

Due to a combination of the ''Spell of Preservation'' and the Worldshield, a number of [[spell]]s or forms of magic would not function within the Hollow World. These included [[divination]] and [[summoning]]. Spells of communication like ''[[commune]]'', ''[[contact other plane]]'', and ''[[ESP]]''. Spells of instantaneous transportation like ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[gate]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', and ''[[word of recall]]''.

There were enormous openings to this Hollow World at the north and south poles of Mystara, measuring {{SI|1000|miles}}, through which its motionless sun radiated light out from. They were rarely ever traversed due to both having freezing cold temperatures, perpetually stormy weather, and (due to the Worldshield) a {{SI|600|miles}} thick zone of dead-magic. Notably, [[lodestone]]s always pointed towards the center of the nearest polar opening.

==Religion==
Much like the planet [[Athas]], Mystara completely lacked [[deities]],  through the visitations of many planewalkers the existence of deities was known to many Mystarans. Instead, the planet had mortals that raised themselves to an equivalent status, becoming beings known as Immortals. Many cultures in the Known World worshiped the same Immortals.

Like deities, the Immortals had their own [[divine realm]]s. Unlike traditional deities, they could not create Immortal offspring; any pairing between an Immortal and a mortal resulted in a mortal child.

Each Immortal was associated with one of the five Spheres of Power

The Immortals had little concern for worlds outside their own,{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/Mystara}} including the world of Toril. One exception to this was the Immortal known as [[Kagyar]], who engaged in activities on a variety of planes across the multiverse.<ref>

Some from other worlds, such as the [[planewalker]] Mordenkainen, viewed the Immortals as paranoid and powermongers. However, though comparisons could be made between the Immortals and gods, some recognized there were distinct differences in their power. Mordenkainen once speculated that, if the Immortals were to ever focus on expanding their influence beyond Mystara, their powers could grow to catastrophic heights.
===Name Similarities===
By chance, some of Mystara's Immortals had names similar to those of deities across the multiverse, as sometimes deities in different crystal spheres came to have the same name by pure chance. In other cases across the multiverse, there were some deities who purposely adopted the moniker of one from another crystal sphere because it was consistently found to invoke awe, respect, or terror in mortals.<ref>

For example, the people of the Northern Reaches worshiped a pantheon whose members included Immortals with the same names as the [[Norse pantheon|Norse deities]] [[Freya|Freyja]], [[Loki]], [[Odin]], and [[Thor]]. Though some speculated whether or not Odin was in reality the same Odin that was worshiped on many other worlds, simply masquerading as an Immortal.

Some of the Immortal patrons of [[humanoid]]s also shared names with [[:category:Monster deities|monstrous deities]] &mdash; Bartziluth, patron of [[bugbear]]s, was also known as [[Hruggek]]; Jammudaru, patron of [[ogre]]s, was also known as [[Vaprak]]; and Ranivorus, patron of [[gnoll]]s, was also known as [[Yeenoghu]] in the gnollish tribal dialect.

Three odd outliers were the Immortals Karaash, The Shining One, and Wogar &mdash; the patrons of [[orc]]s, [[kobold]]s, and [[goblin]]s respectively. The three of them were once mortals by the names of Illneval, Kurtulmak and Maglubiyet. Coincidentally, [[Ilneval]], [[Kurtulmak]], and [[Maglubiyet]] were also the names of deities respectively worshiped by orcs, kobolds, and goblins on other worlds.

==History==
The planet Mystara was originally created by ancient god-race known only as the "Old Ones", fashioned from the raw elementals forces of the Inner Planes. Once their work was complete, they mysteriously vanished. Over the eons that would follow the Immortals would strive to keep their world hidden from outside forces, though ultimately many gods, archdevils, and demon lords would find their way to Mystara.

Throughout Mystara's history, much like [[Krynn]] and Oerth, its astronomical and astrological records commonly featured phenomena that were caused by either magic or Immortals.

Members of the mercantile [[halfling]] family [[Minstrelwish]] traveled between their home planet of Toril and Mystara on a number of occasions.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-02-26 - The Minstrelwish Family}}

In a region known as the Northern Reaches, a Northman by the name of Ulf the Mad and his pet [[winter wolf]] Raffskjarl became seperated from their hunting party one day after a fight with enormous [[remorhaz]] named Dodzorm. Left as the only survivors, the injured Ulf was dragged by his faithful wolf to one of the polar openings of the world. There he came face to face with the "Lord of Death", who in an effort to claim his soul wrestled Ulf to mutual exhaustion and challenged him to an [[ale]] drinking competition. The Lord of Death was ultimately bested by the Northman, who then made his way home and inscribed his encounter through [[scrimshaw]] upon the bones of a [[white dragon]].

At some point the planeswalker Mordenkainen stumbled upon the world, having to devise a modified ''arcane eye'' to begin scrying upon it. and gave an explanation as to his scholarly pursuits. This managed to appease the Immortal, who then welcomed Mordenkainen in to show off the world of Mystara and all it had to offer,

Mordenkainen would end up staying on Mystara for several years, exploring the depths of its Hidden World, after having been discovered one of the two enormous polar openings by following the legend of Ulf the Mad.

Some time in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an Immortal by the name of Kagyar reached beyond his native world and contacted a dwarf on Toril by the name of [[Norin Bonebreaker]]. He granted the man a limited list of [[cleric]]al spells and tasked him with helping the unfortunate, but only in secrecy.{{Cite polyhedron/59/The Living City: The Two Brothers' Butchery|9}}

During that same century, a [[giff]] by the name of [[Blotomus|Captain Blotomus]] landed a [[hammership]] on Mystara and picked up some [[adventurer]]s to help him in rescuing his former crew from pirates led by a [[neogi]] named [[Raver]].<ref> After Blotomus discovered some of the neogi's [[hobgoblin]] crew on an asteroid&mdash;left stranded there for having attempted a mutiny&mdash;and interrogated them, he learned that Raver was sailing to the [[Rock of Bral]] in [[Realmspace]].<ref>

Years later, [[Volothamp Geddarm]] visited this world's continent of Brun.{{Cite card/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus Dice & Miscellany||Hezrou}}

;Ethengar: A large grass plain nation.
;The [[Five Shires]]: The homeland of this world's [[halfling]]s. Underneath a mountain range in this region, known as the Black spires, there existed a persistent portal to the northeastern reaches of Toril's halfling homeland [[Luiren]]. The gate was well hidden and may have potentially been destroyed at some point.
;[[Glantri]]: A powerful, though eccentric, [[magocratic]] nation northwest of Karameikos.<ref> Both the planeswalkers Mordenkainen and [[Elminster]] visited this nation, with the Torilian wizard having a much briefer visitation, only coming to retrieve a magical item that had been stolen from him and was met with violence along the way.

==Notable Inhabitants ==
This section is primarily tailored to listing creatures that originated from the Mystara setting or those incredibly common between it and other settings, such as the [[demihuman]] races.<br />
;Atruaghin:A tribal human culture divided into five clans, each guided by a chief advised by [[shaman]]i, Some of the Atruaghin's more powerful shamani were capable of entering the [[Ethereal Plane]] and through it visit other worlds. Most often, their shamani were attuned to places like [[Maztica]]. Anyone accompanying a shamani or sent by one to another world usually seemed to phase out of some animal when entering the other.
;Beholders:The beholders on this world were slightly smaller than those of Toril. They tended to have brown or green mottled skin. Their tentacles measured {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in length, were unsegmented, and sported eyes the size of a human's.<ref>
;Dwarves:Unlike the dwarves of Toril, which credited their creation to the deity [[Moradin]], the dwarves of Mystara were created by an Immortal known as Kagyar. They often got along well with the gnomes and halflings on this planet, as they had similar drives and characteristics.
;Ethengar: A human culture consisting of a loose confederation of nomadic tribes ruled by a great khan. Much like the Atruaghin, some of Ethengar's more powerful shamans were capable of entering the Ethereal Plane and through it visit other worlds. Most often, their shamans were attuned to places like the [[Plain of Horses]]. Anyone accompanying a shamani or sent by one to another world usually seemed to phase out of some animal when entering the other.
;[[Gem dragon]]s:There were a variety of gem dragons that were unique to Mystara, though one that it shared with Toril was the [[ruby dragon]].
;[[Fachan]]:An unusual variety of [[ogre]]-descended creatures found in the Savage Coast. Like the fachan of Toril, the fachan of Mystara loomed at a height of {{SIrange|9|11|ft|long=yes}}.
; Halflings:Generally known as the hin, they were a bright, adventurous, and intelligent people who generally strove for peace.
;Humanoids:The humanoids on this planet consisted in part of bugbears, [[goblin]]s, gnolls, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[kobold]]s, ogres, [[orc]]s, and [[troll]]s. Each of them had two to three distinct subraces.<ref> All of these humanoids could be found in the Broken Lands, though trolls and nomadic clans of gnolls could also be found in the Northern Reaches, in the Trollheim Hills and Gnollheim Hills respectively.<ref>
;Lupins:A race of [[dog|canine]]-like humanoids that were unique to this world. They were somewhat similar in appearance to [[werewolves]], but were in fact wholly unrelated and despised them, sometimes to the point of hunting them down.<ref> There were no widely known instances of lupins appearing on Toril, though it wasn't considered impossible that some may have planeswalked between the worlds.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-11-27 - Mystara's Lupin}}
;[[Thri-kreen]]s:These insectoid humanoids were unheard of in the Known World, but small packs of them could be found in an area of the Savage Coast known as the Yazak Steppes.<ref>
;[[Tortle]]s:A race of humanoid tortoises. Unlike the tortles of Toril's Chultan Peninsula, the tortles of Mystara had a marine offshoot, known as "snappers." These were broader and larger in size, well adapted for swimming with webbed hands and feet, and couldn't hide within their streamlined shells.<ref><ref>
;[[Pegataur]]s:A race of winged centaurs that were unique to this world.
;[[Rakasta]]:a race of intelligent [[cat]]like humanoids related to [[rakshasa]]s.<ref> They were native to this world, but some could be found inhabiting [[the Vast]] on Toril.{{Cite organized play/LC/Impendant Symposium|12-13}}
;[[Velya]]s: A race of aquatic [[vampire]]s that had once been surface dwelling [[humanoid]]s until they were stricken by an ancient [[curse]].
