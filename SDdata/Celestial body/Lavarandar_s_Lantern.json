        "mainbody": "Lavarandars Lantern was a constellation in Realmspace.\nThis constellation consisted of stars in the shape of an upright rectangle, with four brighter stars of a blue-white hue enclosed within the formation. It was situated far to the south of the constellation Mystras Star Circle and to the west of the Sleepless Knights.\nLavarandars Lantern could be observed in the Sword Coast North, particularly from the village of Twilight Tor around the same time as the Simril festivities.\nOn the Sword Coast, the most common story associated with this constellation told of a king whose four daughters contracted lycanthropy and who built a silver cage to imprison them in while he was away searching for a cure to their condition. The story went on to say that the absent kings nephew, evil-aligned and possessing a strong desire to inherit the throne himself, hurled the caged princesses into the ocean. His actions drew the attention of the ocean goddess Umberlee. She threw the cage back out of the water, but was filled with such rage that it soared far above into the Sea of Night.\nSome astrologers claimed that people born under this constellation displayed a great deal of sympathy and empathy towards others, but would act stoic when confronting their own issues."
