        "mainbody": "'''Lavarandar's Lantern''' was a [[constellation]] in [[Realmspace]].",
        "Description": "This constellation consisted of stars in the shape of an upright rectangle, with four brighter stars of a blue-white hue enclosed within the formation. It was situated far to the south of the constellation [[Mystra's Star Circle]] and to the west of the [[Sleepless Knights]].",
        "Observation": "Lavarandar's Lantern could be observed in the [[Sword Coast North]], particularly from the village of [[Twilight Tor]] around the same time as the [[Simril]] festivities.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "On the Sword Coast, the most common story associated with this constellation told of a king whose four daughters contracted [[lycanthropy]] and who built a [[silver]] cage to imprison them in while he was away searching for a cure to their condition. The story went on to say that the absent king's nephew, evil-aligned and possessing a strong desire to inherit the throne himself, hurled the caged princesses into the ocean. His actions drew the attention of the ocean goddess [[Umberlee]]. She threw the cage back out of the water, but was filled with such rage that it soared far above into the [[Sea of Night]].\n\nSome [[Astrology|astrologers]] claimed that people born under this constellation displayed a great deal of sympathy and empathy towards others, but would act stoic when confronting their own issues."
