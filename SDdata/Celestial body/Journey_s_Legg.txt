'''Journey's Legg''' was an asteroid that existed within the [[Astral Plane]], having previously been among those within the [[Tears of Selûne]]. It was a highly fortified [[neogi]] base and hideout.

==Description==
Behind the rock of the asteroid, the neogi had built inner walls of [[adamantine]] that further shielded their base from intruders.{{Cite adventurers league/Tears Among the Stars|14-15}}

===Interior===
The neogi's prisoner stockade was found amidst a network of tunnels dug deep within the asteroid.

The innermost sanctums of Journey's Legg were set within a maze-like corridor, each set behind locked doors. Notable locales included an incubation chamber for juvenile [[eyedrake]]s, a "meat grinder" chamber that ground down food for pet [[neothelid]]s, and a gauntlet of trap-filled chambers that deterred would-be prison breaks.{{Cite adventurers league/Tears Among the Stars|17-20}}

==Geography==
The asteroid was less than {{SI|8|mi|k}} across.

It was also the main base of operations of the neogi in [[Realmspace]]. Nearly all neogi attacks and raids within the [[Crystal sphere|sphere]] originated from Journey's Legg.

==Trade==
Journey's Legg was used by the neogi as a hub in their slave traffic activities in Realmspace. Slaves captured from [[Toril]] and other nearby locations were first brought there before being sold or put to work by the neogi.

==Defenses==
The asteroid was extremely well fortified and guarded. Journey's Legg was constantly watched over by at least ten neogi [[spelljammer]]s of different types ready to defend it, along with an array of defensive turrets. 

It was also protected by scores of mind-controlled monstrous and otherworldly creatures that had been enslaved by the neogi,{{Cite adventurers league/Tears Among the Stars|7-8}}

==History==
{{Quote|Former slaves, gith soldiers, planar travelers, and adventurers of this allied expeditionary force! You'are about to embark upon a most dangerous hunt, one we have only held as a hpope for so long...Your aim is the destruction of the neogi slaving base of Journey's Legg.|[[Jaan'vald Llanou]].}}

Some time in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[gith]] adventuring party called the [[Draa'zvir]] managed to escape from imprisonment from within Journey's Legg after being captured by neogi slavers. The entire asteroid mysteriously shifted from from its position within the Tears of Selûne to the [[Astral Plane]]. [[Gath Qos]] ''[[wish]]ed'' every prisoner free from Jorurney's Legg and ''[[plane shift]]ed'' her and her allies to nearby [[Stardock]].

Unfortunately, one party member [[Jaan'vald Llanou]], was apprehended by [[Red Wizard]]s and imprisoned in the frozen [[Abeir]]an necropolis of [[Xorvintroth]] on Toril. After Jaan'vald and the other captives of the Red Wizards were freed by [[Remallia Haventree]] and her allies in the [[Harpers]],{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|5}} he was informed by his allies in the [[Sha'sal Khou]] the location of the slavers' base.{{Cite adventurers league/Against the Machine|16}}

Adventurers allied with the Harpers, members of Draa'zvir, and agents of the [[Sha'sal Khou]] formed a spacefaring raiding party and set out for Journey's Legg together. They rallied allies among the [[giff]], aboard their mighty [[great bombard]], and a band of [[gnome ceremorph]]s that piloted the ''[[Id Ascendant]]'', and set out for the Astral Plane.{{Cite adventurers league/Tears Among the Stars|3-6}}

Once within Journey's Legg, they discovered that the neogi of Journey's Legg had allied with a [[illithid]] named [[Xissix]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tears Among the Stars|21}} The two had stolen the artifact known as [[the Anomaly]] from [[Xorvintroth]], and attached it to the otherworldly machine referred to as [[the Engine]], in order to conduct experiments utilizing [[Far Realm]] energy. They had combined the two constructs into a single, sentient entity that phased the entirety of Journey's Legg into the [[Astral Plane]].

While the exact fate of the the combined Anomaly–Engine entity was unknown, Jaan'vald and his fellow adventurers did manage to save many of those enslaved by the neogi raiders.{{Cite adventurers league/Tears Among the Stars|25-26}}

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Xissix]], a [[mind flayer]] who conducted strange experiments with energy from the Far Realm.
