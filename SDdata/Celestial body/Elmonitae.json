The [[Tsunami (spelljammer)|tsunami]] ''[[Storm of Honor]]'', commanded by [[Daimyo]] [[Akahu Nagasa]], fought against six [[neogi mindspider]]s, destroying four and causing the remaining two to flee after a 28-hour-long battle. The ship then landed on Elmonitae and rescued the prisoners. The elven captives were then transferred to the [[armada (spelljammer)|armada]] ''[[Wings of Glory]]'', ushering a five-year-long peace between the elves and the nation of Wa."
