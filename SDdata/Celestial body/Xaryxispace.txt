'''Xaryxispace''' was a small star system in [[wildspace]] that was home to the [[Xaryxian Empire]] of [[astral elves]].

==Description==
The system consisted of the [[star]] [[Xaryxis]] and three natural satellites, the [[planet]]s [[Rivus]], [[Vaerduran]], and [[Xaryndar]].

Also situated within the system was the elf-made [[Imperial Citadel]] of the Xaryxian elves. The citadel siphoned power from the star Xaryxis directly, by means of a {{SIAdj|300000|mi|k|adj=long}} beam of light.
