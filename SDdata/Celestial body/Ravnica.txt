'''Ravnica''' was a [[planet]] whose entire surface was covered by a sprawling city. It was ruled over by ten influential guilds that vied for power amongst each other.

==Geography==
The world existed within its own [[plane of existence]]—also called Ravnica—separate from the [[Prime Material plane]] that housed [[Toril]] and its [[crystal sphere]].

==Description==
The ten guilds of Ravnica held power over its people for thousands of years, forming a web of power dynamics, political intrigue, and large-scale conflicts that spanned the planet's entire surface.

Ravnica was a place of immense financial opportunity, that attracted businesses and merchants from across the [[multiverse]].

==Inhabitants==
Many of the races native to Toril also dwelled on Ravnica, including [[human]]s, [[elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[giant]]s, [[merfolk]], [[minotaur]]s, [[sphinx]]es, and [[dragon]]s. It was also home to some beings native to the [[Feywild]], such as [[dryad]]s, and others from the [[Outer Planes]], including [[angel]]s, [[demon]]s, and [[devil]]s.

The warrens of the Ravnica's undercity house a variety of shadowy creatures, that had coarse gray skin and no mouths upon their faces.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Sylvene]], a [[planewalker]] who traveled to Toril in the mid–15{{th}} century [[DR]], and found new friends and love in the city of [[Waterdeep]].
* [[Tyreus]], the power-hungry [[wizard]] that sought after the ''[[Stone of Creation]]''.
