        "Cosmography": "Eberron was a part of the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] and the overall multiverse, being situated in the [[Deep Ethereal]]. However, there it lay at the center of its own [[material plane]] and its very own cosmology of other [[planes]] that orbited it and had profound effects upon it. Furthermore, this cosmology and its Ring of Siberys sealed the world away from the regular Great Wheel planes, preventing outside [[deities]] and powers both celestial and fiendish from having an influence there.\n\nNevertheless, it was possible to travel to and from Eberron via the planes, at least in theory. One could go through the Ethereal plane or use one of the various [[spell]]s intended for traversing the planes, but the cosmology was designed specifically to prevent this.<ref group=\"note\">As Eberron lies in an alternate material plane, these methods in 3{{rd}}-edition ''Manual of the Planes'' appear applicable, but are unconfirmed and predate the Eberron setting. Nevertheless, the Rift Between Worlds may fit the freak event theory and the World Serpent Inn and Ravenloft's Demiplane of Dread are both demiplanes. Only a few very specific methods of getting there are known.\n\nFirst, there was of course the [[World Serpent Inn]]. A variety of doors here opened to Eberron, with one of the few known relatively permanent ones leading to the [[w:c:eberron:Queen's Kiss|Queen's Kiss]] flower shop in Fairhaven. Others opened to Sarlona, Sharn, and Stormreach, while one rotting door went to a ruined city known as Metrol.{{Cite dragon/351/The World Serpent Inn|27}}\n\nSecond, there was a way through the [[Demonweb Pits]]. Starting from [[Toril]], a cave south of the town of [[Eveningstar]], [[Cormyr]], contained a portal to a part of the Demonweb Pits near the Rift Between Worlds, which linked to the [https://ddowiki.com/page/The_Spinner%27s_Prison Spinner's Prison] in [[w:c:Khyber (Underdark)|Khyber]], Eberron's counterpart to the [[Underdark]]. From there, one could take a passage leading to the Harbor of [[w:c:eberron:Stormreach|Stormreach]], a city on Eberron. One could return the same way and afterward teleport to speed the journey. This was only possible after the Spinner's death in 1479 DR.\n\nThird, there was a way through the [[Demiplane of Dread]], otherwise known as Ravenloft. A misty portal between two trees in the House Jorasco Enclave in Stormreach took a traveler who heard the cries of anguish emanating from within into the mists and onto the [[Old Svalich Road]] in [[Barovia]]. A similar portal also stood, conveniently, near the same cave south of Eveningstar. Certain portals in Barovia took one back to the Eveningstar cave or the House Jorasco enclave.<ref>{{Cite game\n| title     = [[Dungeons & Dragons Online]]: Mists of Ravenloft\n| accessory = \n| developer = [[wikipedia:Standing Stone Games|Standing Stone Games]]\n| publisher = [[wikipedia:Daybreak Game Company|Daybreak Game Company]]\n| designer  = \n| date      = December 2017\n| scene     = \n}}\n\nThe fourth, and most unreliable, way was through [[Baba Yaga]]'s [[Baba Yaga's Hut|dancing hut]], which traveled all the worlds and planes.

        "History": "Eberron and its unique cosmology were created by three great progenitor wyrms. They designed a new cosmic system, made a new planet, and populated it with recreations of the dragons, elves, orcs, and other races of the multiverse. However, they intended that they evolve outside the influence of their respective deities like [[Corellon]], [[Lolth]], [[Gruumsh]], and others.\n\nIn spite this, Lolth would still inevitably somehow gain influence there. After an imprisoned [[demon]] [[w:c:eberron:Overlord|Overlord]] of Eberron known as the [https://ddowiki.com/page/The_Spinner_of_Shadows Spinner of Shadows] (who seemed a lot like Lolth) was slain by adventurers there, a passage called the Rift Between Worlds opened in the Spinner's Prison. This led into Lolth's Demonweb Pits. [[Elminster]], the Sage of Shadowdale, and the [[w:c:eberron:Gatekeepers|Gatekeeper]] druid [https://ddowiki.com/page/Tavnar_Kronnak Tavnar Kronnak] investigated this rift from their respective sides and curious adventurers went through. They found taunting messages from Lolth suggesting she'd allied with and tricked Eberron's [[w:c:eberron:Lords of Dust|Lords of Dust]] and had [[drow]] servants there, as part of a plot to acquire [[w:c:eberron:dragonshards|dragonshards]], destroy Eberron, take over Toril's [[Weave]], become its new goddess of [[magic]], and so on and so forth. She even encouraged the adventurers to come through, like flies into a spider's web. A nearby portal took them to Toril, to a cave south of Eveningstar in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.\n\nIt seems the world was lucky enough to have had a [[w:c:eberron:Last War|Last War]].{{Cite dragon/351/The World Serpent Inn|27}} During this Last War, [[w:c:eberron:House Cannith|House Cannith]] built an enormous prison complex to contain alien and extraplanar threats for all time. A [[warforged]] named [[Warden (warforged)|Warden]] was built to be the immortal keeper of this prison. On the [[w:c:eberron:Day of Mourning|Day of Mourning]], the prison fell, and Warden became corrupted by the very things they were created to imprison.{{Cite web/Idle Champion Spotlight: Warden}} Becoming a servant of the [[Elder Evil]] [[Hadar]], Warden somehow crossed to Toril to procure souls for the Dark Hunger.\n\nHouse Cannith hired the goblin engineer [[Lazaapz]] to investigate an [[w:c:eberron:Eldritch machine|eldritch machine]] built by the [[w:c:eberron:Cul'sir Dominion|Cul'sir Dominion]] for an unknown purpose. Lazaapz discovered it had markings associated with the local plane of [[w:c:eberron:Dal Quor|Dal Quor]].{{Cite web/Idle Champion Spotlight: Lazaapz}} Shortly thereafter, both Lazaapz and the device disappeared from Eberron and transported to the world of Toril.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], during a celebration of [[Dragondown]], a group of [[dolgrim]]s from Eberron somehow made an incursion into Toril, plaguing the village of [[Skeefan]] and the forest around it, the [[Tarlain]] family estate, part of the [[Trackless Sea]] coastline, and the lair of the [[bronze dragon]] [[Chotyn]].",
        "Geography": "Eberron was the site of such cities as [[w:c:eberron:Fairhaven|Fairhaven]] (capital of [[w:c:eberron:Aundair|Aundair]]), [[w:c:eberron:Sharn|Sharn]], [[w:c:eberron:Stormreach|Stormreach]], and [[w:c:eberron:Metrol|Metrol]], which lay in ruins. Its continents included [[w:c:eberron:Khorvaire|Khorvaire]], [[w:c:eberron:Sarlona|Sarlona]], and [[w:c:eberron:Xen'drik|Xen'drik]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The world was home to [[dragon]]s, [[rakshasa]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[warforged]], [[elves]], [[orc]]s, and other races of the multiverse."
