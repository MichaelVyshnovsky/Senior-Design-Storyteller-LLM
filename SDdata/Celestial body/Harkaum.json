        "Geography": "Harkaum was dominated by large continents and long strings of islands in between. The continents were primarily covered in mountains and jungles.",
        "Inhabitants": "Harkaum's primary inhabitants were \"savage\" [[elves]] that dwelled in the jungles and on the islands, and [[human]]s that lived in widely spaced enclaves of cleared farmland in the jungles. The elves and humans were largely opposed to each other.\n\n[[Dragon]]s were once numerous, acting as the rulers/owners of the (then enslaved) human enclaves, but they eventually died off.\n\nThere were a handful of human [[lich]]es native to Harkaum, as well as bound liches sent by [[Larloch]] from [[Toril]]; the liches took over ruling the human enclaves after the dragons' extirpation from Harkaum.<ref>{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-11/Larloch's otherworldly influence}}\n\nMonsters were known to inhabit the jungles and islands as well.",
        "Magic": "The humans, under the instructions of the dragons, made all manner of [[magical item]]s from dragon scales, blood, fangs, ''etc.'', but the supply of materials for such items vanished when the dragons died off.\n\nThe process of becoming a lich on Harkaum required dragon brains.\n\nAfter the liches sent by Larloch took over, they put the humans to work creating new magical items and crafting new [[spell]]s.",
        "History": "The humans of Harkaum were slaves of the dragons for millennia, raised and trained from birth to farm and craft for the dragons. After the dragons died out, at some point liches sent by Larloch came, \"tamed\" the few native Harkounan liches, and took over the human enclaves for Larloch's purposes, putting the humans to work again."
