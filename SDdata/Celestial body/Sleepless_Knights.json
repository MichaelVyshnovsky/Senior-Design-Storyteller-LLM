        "mainbody": "The Sleepless Knights was a constellation in Realmspace. \nThis constellation comprised five middling-bright stars, with one each making up the corner of a square surrounding the fifth. It was situated to the south of the constellation Mystras Star Circle.\nThis constellation could be observed in the Sword Coast North, particularly from the village of Twilight Tor around the same time as the Simril festivities.\nOld legends spoke of the stars in this constellation having once been knights that were oathbound by a king to stand vigil over the North for any approaching armies, who never slept nor wavered in their duty. These legends went on to say that following their kings death a decisive battle took place high in some mountain. Afterwards, the knights decided to ascend into the sky in order to stand vigil over the North for all time.\nReflecting this legend, astrologers claimed that people born under this constellation were incredibly reliable and displayed both a great sense of loyalty to their duties and friends."
