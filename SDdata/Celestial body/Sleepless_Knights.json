        "Description": "This constellation comprised five middling-bright stars, with one each making up the corner of a square surrounding the fifth. It was situated to the south of the constellation [[Mystra's Star Circle]].",
        "Observation": "This constellation could be observed in the [[Sword Coast North]], particularly from the village of [[Twilight Tor]] around the same time as the [[Simril]] festivities.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Old legends spoke of the stars in this constellation having once been knights that were oathbound by a king to stand vigil over [[the North]] for any approaching armies, who never slept nor wavered in their duty. These legends went on to say that following their king's death a decisive battle took place high in some mountain. Afterwards, the knights decided to ascend into the sky in order to stand vigil over the North for all time.\n\nReflecting this legend, [[Astrology|astrologers]] claimed that people born under this constellation were incredibly reliable and displayed both a great sense of loyalty to their duties and friends."
