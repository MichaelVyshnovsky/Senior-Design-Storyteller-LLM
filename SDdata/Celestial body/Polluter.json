Frozen water could be found on its surface, but it had no atmosphere at all. The surface or interior had never been mapped out or mined.\nThe paladin Justin Demonslayer, a former space pirate and resident of Mingabwe, abandoned two of his former magical items somewhere on Polluter so that they could no longer be used for evil."
