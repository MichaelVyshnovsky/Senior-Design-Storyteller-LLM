        "Geography": "The asteroid was hollowed out by a series of tunnels and chambers. The largest of the caverns was the asteroid's namesake: an enormous dock wide enough to moor a large [[spelljammer]] vessel.",
        "Trade": "During the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], spelljammers and [[astral ship]]s docked regularly at Stardock to bring supplies to its inhabitants. Foodstuffs typically stored at Stardock included:\n* [[Aartuk]] tongues;\n* [[Giant space hamster]] hocks;\n* [[H'Cathan doom radish]]es;\n* [[Infinity vine]] stalks;\n* Pickled [[jammer leech]]es;\n* Dried [[mortiss]] meat;\n* [[Puffer]] steaks.",
        "History": "In the distant past, the cave system of Stardock had been the lair of an unknown species of [[dragon]]. Sometime before the 11{{th}} century [[DR]], Stardock was an outpost of the [[illithid]]s from [[Glyth]], dug by [[umber hulk]] slaves. They named it ''Mehiluum'', or Stardock in the common tongue. These illithids built The Rift, the portal leading to the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] level of Undermountain.{{Cite adventurers league/Stardock Under Siege|76}} The outpost was used occasionally by the mind flayers for the following 200 years.\n\nSometime in early [[Eleasis]], [[1369 DR]], the [[Twisted Rune]] discovered the existence of the outpost and used a ''[[wish]]'' spell to create the Rift. Led by [[Priamon Rakesk]] and the [[alhoon]] [[Ralayan]], the Rune raided and conquered the outpost on [[Eleint 9]] that same year. They subsequently used it as a base for magical research, kidnapping [[Halaster Blackcloak]] on [[Highharvestide]] and imprisoning him there in order to discover secrets that might grant the Rune an advantage in their struggle against the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].\n\nOut of Halaster's control, the occupants of Undermountain erupted all across [[Faerûn]] through uncontrolled portals. The event became known as [[Halaster's Higharvestide]].\n\nBy [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} after a long period of abandonment, the asteroid was claimed by a githyanki commander named [[Al'chaia|Al’chaia]] and her troop of [[githyanki]] warriors and [[red dragon]] allies.  It had been converted into a [[crèche]] where young githyanki were raised and trained before moving to the [[Astral Plane]].\n\nFollowing the demise of [[Al'chaia|Al’chaia]], rulership of Stardock fell to Commander [[Urlon]], who transformed and expanded it into a cosmopolitan trading and transportation hub in the region. It became home to all manner of creatures and races.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Stardock Under Siege|4,76}}",
