Spiral was one of the "worldlets" that existed in the same crystal sphere as the Rock of Bral.
Spiral had winding rivers that flowed from the polar seas to the equatorial ocean and back. It was also said to have a little orange sun that, possibly, orbited around the Spiral itself.
The planet was once inhabited by elves, both warriors and farmers, hence Spiral probably had some fertile lands as well as the already mentioned rivers, polar seas, and equatorial ocean. It also had deep caves and mountains, where the elves hid when Spiral was attacked by the scro Tarantula fleet.
