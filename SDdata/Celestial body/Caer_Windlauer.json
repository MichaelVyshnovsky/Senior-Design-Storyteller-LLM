        "mainbody": "'''Caer Windlauer''' was an enormous castle that orbited [[the sun]] of [[Realmspace]] in a comet-like trajectory.",
        "Geography": "The castle orbited the sun at a 45Â° angle with respect to the other planets in a highly elliptical orbit, coming as close as [[Coliar]] and as far as [[Karpri]]. It was a magnificent structure whose grassy estate spanned thousands of acres filled with beautiful trees, streams, and a lake inhabited by a few dozen [[goose|geese]]. The castle itself had ten towers over 100 ft (30 m) tall and was made of perfectly carved stone.",
        "History": "Caer Windlauer used to be located in the city of [[Trondhelm]] on the island of [[Oman]] in the [[Moonshaes]]. Sometime before the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the castle was thrown into space after [[Omar McDauphin]], its introverted occupant, cast a ''[[wish]]'' spell from a ''[[ring of three wishes]]'' asking for total isolation and that he and his family would never be robbed or harmed. The spell caused his family to become part of a group of assassins, for Omar to be turned into a [[stone giant]], for all his possessions to disappear (except for one chair and the geese), and for his entire estate to be thrown into space, forever. The ''ring'' still had one charge left, but the previous ''wish'' also destroyed the last charge so that Omar could never return home.\n\nThe coastal area of Oman where the estate used to be became an ocean-filled bay known as [[Iron Keep Bay]]."
