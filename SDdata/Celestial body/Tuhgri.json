        "mainbody": "he Tuhgri was one of many crystal spheres that were suspended in phlogiston.\nIn 1368 DR, a new yet unnamed universe was being born just outside the worlds of the Tuhgri crystal sphere. Lathander, a Torillian deity known as the Morninglord encouraged his paramour - Chauntea the Earthmother to witness the blossoming. The newborn universe was shaped as two tiny crystal spheres, nestled together similarly to an egg cluster of faerie dragons. Lathander claimed that when the newborn crystal spheres bumped against each other awash with waves of phlogiston, they chimed."
