The Color Spray Nebula was a fan-shaped nebula in Realmspace. It appeared like a flashy multicolored object similar to the effects of a color spray spell. In the mid-14 century DR, it was visible from Toril during spring and early summer
The Color Spray was a huge multicolored cloud about 2 million miles (3.2 million km) long, 1 million miles (1.6 million km) wide at one end and 100 ft (30.5 m) wide at the opposite end.
It orbited the Torilian solar system in a very slow orbit, taking over 4,000 months to complete a full revolution. The nebula shared its orbit with the Galleon Nebula, but in the opposite position, so the two were never simultaneously visible from Toril.
When a spelljammer entered the region, its crew felt a slight tingling sensation, which was a side effect of the nebulas healing properties. A creature entering the nebula was immediately cured of any diseases. However, there was a small (but cumulative) probability that they would also contract a deadly and incurable cancer, that could only be removed by powerful magic such as a wish spell.
Another effect of the nebula was to sometimes drain protective magic items, since its magic seemed to be non-sympathetic to abjuration effects. Items such as rings, armor and cloaks of protection were all at risk of having their magic properties weakened or drained away entirely by the nebula.
The nebula was seen by followers of Mystra as a sign that the deity was pleased by their use of magic. It was also seen by followers of Bane as a sign of his wrath a destructive object that annihilated everything in its path.
The depths of the Color Spray Nebula were also rumored to hold a secret base of the Tenth Pit, a small but dangerous organization of human spacefarers with possible ties with the Zhentarim and other evil organizations in different crystal spheres.
