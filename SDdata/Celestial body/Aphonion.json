        "mainbody": "phonion was a world on the Prime Material plane protected by a powerful Magi member of the Order of the Eternals and the home of some unique spells. Some of the lands of note on Aphonion included the Kingdom of Streams End.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Order of the Eternals, a trans-dimensional guild for magic-users of impressive power, elected to hold its 1,238 annual Symposium in the city of Ravens Bluff on the world of Toril, in order to secretly investigate its unusually high levels of magical energies and planar incursions. The Symposiums attendees included Magi Paragon the Purple, one of the High Masters of the Order, and Lady Dowager Duchess Darra de Aerindale. All the guests stayed at Glittering Star Inn for the multi-day event. Paragon the Purple, however, was a victim of an opportunistic robbery with his cloak of the art and spellbook taken, and eventually returned with some aid from the wizardly heroes of the Living City. During the Symposium, Paragon the Purple helmed the opening lecture titled Necromancy The Blackest Art."
