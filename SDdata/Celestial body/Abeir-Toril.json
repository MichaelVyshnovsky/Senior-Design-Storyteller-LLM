The name was archaic, meaning \"cradle of life\".",
        "Etymology": "Abeir-Toril was a compound word, formed of two words that originated in the ancient language [[Auld Wyrmish]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-01-30 - Etymology of Abeir and Toril}}",
        "Geography": "The shape of the planet was very different from either modern Abeir or modern Toril, consisting of one massive supercontinent known as [[Merrouroboros]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Abeir-Toril was dominated by [[abomination]]s from the [[Far Realm]], among them the most prominent were the [[aboleth]]s from the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. Other races that lived in this prehistoric world were the [[Giant|giantkin]] and the mysterious [[Creator race]]s.",
        "History": "Abeir-Toril was one of many worlds that appeared after [[Ao]] crafted [[Realmspace]] out of the [[phlogiston]]. Unknown to the primordials, the first [[gods]] also began to appear in Realmspace. [[Selûne]] and [[Shar]] were the first ones \n\nWhen the twin goddesses became aware of the threat of the primordials, they rallied all the gods to defend the virgin worlds, even summoning gods from other [[Cosmology|dimensions]] to aid the native gods in the war. While the gods and primordials battled for ages, life flourished on Abeir-Toril. \n\nThe first lifeforms on Abeir-Toril were aberrant, however. Beings from the Far Realm who tried to gain a foothold in Realmspace, among them the [[Eldest]], the oldest-known aboleth and possibly the progenitor of the entire species. The gods also opposed against them, and the [[Cerulean Sign]] was a rune of power created during this time by the gods to oppose those beings.\n\nIt was the end of the [[Shadow Epoch]], during the last period of the [[Days of Thunder]], that a conflict between the [[titan]]s and the [[batrachi]] sparked. To defeat their enemies, the batrachi summoned many primordials from their imprisonment. The gods quickly moved to battle their ancient foes, and a primordial called \"[[Asgorath|Asgoroth the World Shaper]]\" hurled an ice moon down to the surface of Merrouroboros in an event known as the [[Tearfall]], intending to destroy the world she could not claim as their own.\n\nIt was this action that finally spurred Ao to action, leading to the \"changing of stars\", in which the world was separated into two twin planets, Abeir and Toril. Ao gave the primordials control over Abeir, while retaining sovereignty over Toril for the gods. When Abeir-Toril was sundered, the city of [[Xxiphu]], the realm of the aboleth, remained on Abeir.\n\nThose events were unknown to [[Faerûn]]ian sages until after the [[Spellplague]], when the [[dragonborn]] of Abeir and the [[sarrukh]]s of [[Okoth]] revealed forgotten lore regarding the ancient past."
