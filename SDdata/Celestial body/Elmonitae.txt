Elmonitae was a moonlet in the Tears of Sel√ªne. It was a neogi stronghold.
The asteroid was guarded by patrolling neogi mindspiders.
Sometime in the mid-14 century DR, the neogi had imprisoned 100 captives on Elmonitae 60 elves and 40 humans from Wa. The tsunami Storm of Honor, commanded by Daimyo Akahu Nagasa, fought against six neogi mindspiders, destroying four and causing the remaining two to flee after a 28-hour-long battle. The ship then landed on Elmonitae and rescued the prisoners. The elven captives were then transferred to the armada Wings of Glory, ushering a five-year-long peace between the elves and the nation of Wa.
