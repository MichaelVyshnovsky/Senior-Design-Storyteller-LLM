The taint of the dark deity Azrai was passed on in bloodlines as well. It mutated some of its bearers into powerful and monstrous creatures called ''awnsheghlien'', Blood of Darkness.

The ancestors of four of the five modern tribes of humans originated on the southern continent of Aduria, but fled to Cerilia from the increasing oppression by followers of the dark god Azrai.

The deities of old sacrificed themselves to destroy their dark counterpart. The devastation shattered the landscape and showered surviving mortals in divine essence: Eight champions rose as new gods, while many others gained a divine spark they passed to their descendants ever since.<ref>{{cite book/Birthright Campaign Setting/Atlas of Cerilia|6-9}}\n\nIn the following centuries the Anuirean noble house of Roele formed their tribe into an empire, which dominated large parts of Cerilia. It ended when the last of the Roeles fell in a duel with the Gorgon, the most dreadful of ''awnsheghlien''. The ruin of the empire led to the independence of occupied ethnicities and ongoing strive within Anuire for rulership.<ref>{{cite book/Birthright Campaign Setting/Atlas of Cerilia|10-11}}"
