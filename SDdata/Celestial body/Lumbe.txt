The moon was cylindrical in shape, with a length of  and a diameter of .

The exterior of the moon had no atmosphere, but its surface had two doors that led inside. With the doors closed, noises could be heard coming from the inside, but they all ceased as soon as any of the doors were opened.

The laboratorys supply of breathable air was maintained by a constant flow coming out of magical jars. Other bottles scattered throughout the interior exuded a fresh, flowery scent that could be felt throughout the laboratory.
Lumbe was home to the sage Sarelk, a powerful wizard who moved into Realmspace from another crystal sphere, following the Batship. He used the laboratory to research items that could destroy the ship without harming its occupant,
