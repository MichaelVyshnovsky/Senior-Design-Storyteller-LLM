'''Farworld''' was one of the twelve moons of [[Garden]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
Farworld was a {{SIAdj|111|mi|k|adj=diameter}} globe, making it larger than Garden.

The moon was the site of a bustling trading post, despite its distance from other planets, though it was limited to the sale of non-[[magical item]]s.
