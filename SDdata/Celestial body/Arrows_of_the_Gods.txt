The Arrows of the Gods, as it was commonly referred to in the Sword Coast North, was a constellation in Realmspace. 
Among the Bedine tribes of Anauroch it was known as Atars Arrows. In other regions of the Realms it was known as the Caltrop and Suns Signpost.
This constellation consisted of three lines of stars that converged and each ended in a cluster of stars at their outward point, which gave it a resemblance to a set of arrows. The Bedine of Anauroch shared this sentiment, but associated the Arrows with their goddess Atar the Merciless. In some regions of the Realms they were thought to resemble a caltrop instead.
Where the three lines of stars converged was always the direction of true east in the North.
This constellation could be observed in the Anauroch and the Sword Coast North. It was especially visible from the village of Twilight Tor around the same time as the Simril festivities.
Stories told by the Bedine claimed that the Arrows had been shot into their place in the sky by their sun goddess, Atar the Merciless, in order to permanently clear and mark the way for her to rise in that spot each day.
Some astrologers claimed that people born under this constellation were highly driven, took a direct approach to handling their problems, and had blunt personalities.
