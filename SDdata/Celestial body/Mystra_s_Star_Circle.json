        "mainbody": "ystras Star Circle, otherwise known by the Bedine tribes as the Circle of Swords, was a constellation in Realmspace.\nThis constellation comprised many bright stars arranged in a circle. The brightest star in the constellation, called the \"Brow Star\" or \"Algairtha\" by the Bedine, was known to always be in the direction of true north.\nIt was situated above the constellation Auroth the Ice Snake and north of the Sleepless Knights.\nThis constellation could be observed in Anauroch and the Sword Coast North. It was especially visible from the village of Twilight Tor around the same time as the Simril festivities.\nAccording to some fairytales that were often told to children, the goddess Mystra had a castle situated in the center of the circle, known as the \"Castle of Night.\" Those who referred to the constellation as the Circle of Coins claimed that its stars were coins thrown into the Sea of Night by some deities to taunt the destitute.\nSome Bedine tribes believed that the constellation was the location of Nasrs Tent, their cultures afterlife, with the stars being the scimitars of the greatest Bedine to have ever been taken by Nasr. Their name for the star Algairtha was unrelated to this myth &mdash Bedine legends spoke of a great sorcereress in ancient times who challenged their gods, but failed. As punished they transformed her into the star and forever trapped her above in the Sea of Night, her beauty preserved but at the cost of being frozen.\nSome astrologers claimed that people born under this constellation displayed a great sense of curiosity and capacity for learning."
