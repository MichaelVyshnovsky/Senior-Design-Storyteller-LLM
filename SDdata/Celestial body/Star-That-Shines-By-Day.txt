The '''Star-That-Shines-By-Day''' was as celestial body seen from the continent of [[Maztica]]'s [[Valley of Nexal]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, the Star-That-Shines-By-Day shone brightly in the skies over the great empire of [[Nexal]]. It grew in brilliance over the course of a [[tenday]], and this strange occurrence was believed to be a dire omen by the [[cleric]]s [[Atl-Ollin]] of [[Calor]], [[Caracatl]] of [[Tezca]], and [[Hoxitl]] of [[Zaltec]]. Whether gods or mystical means caused the Star-That-Shines-By-Day's brilliance, it was, indeed, soon followed by the fateful arrival of the [[Golden Legion]] to the [[True World]], and eventual destruction of Nexal and return of the Iridescent Ancestor of the Gods, [[Qotal]].
