'''Mystra's Star Circle''', otherwise known by the [[Bedine]] tribes as the '''Circle of Swords''', was a [[constellation]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
This constellation comprised many bright stars arranged in a circle. The brightest star in the constellation, called the "[[Brow Star]]" or "Algairtha" by the Bedine, was known to always be in the direction of true north.

It was situated above the constellation [[Auroth the Ice Snake]] and north of the [[Sleepless Knights]].

==Observation==
This constellation could be observed in [[Anauroch]] and the [[Sword Coast North]]. It was especially visible from the village of [[Twilight Tor]] around the same time as the [[Simril]] festivities.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to some fairytales that were often told to children, the goddess [[Mystra]] had a castle situated in the center of the circle, known as the "Castle of Night." Those who referred to the constellation as the '''Circle of Coins''' claimed that its stars were [[currency|coins]] thrown into the [[Sea of Night]] by some deities to taunt the destitute.

Some Bedine tribes believed that the constellation was the location of N'asr's Tent, their culture's afterlife, with the stars being the [[scimitar]]s of the greatest Bedine to have ever been taken by [[Cyric|N'asr]]. Their name for the star Algairtha was unrelated to this myth &mdash; Bedine legends spoke of a great [[sorcerer]]ess in ancient times who challenged their gods, but failed. As punished they transformed her into the star and forever trapped her above in the Sea of Night, her beauty preserved but at the cost of being frozen.

Some [[Astrology|astrologers]] claimed that people born under this constellation displayed a great sense of curiosity and capacity for learning.
