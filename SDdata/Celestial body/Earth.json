Because of these limitations, magic-users from outside were unable to use some spells to get there, like ''[[gate]]'', ''[[contact other plane]]'', ''[[commune]]'', ''[[summon shadow]]'', while others were impeded to functioned differently. Similarly, extraplanar energies did not leak into Earth, so magical phenomena did not occur and magical creatures did not evolve, and Earth humans were not inspired to conduct serious research into magic.

Fox meat, whether roasted or stewed, was even less popular. In the end, he let the foxes run wild, and in time they displaced the native Faerûnian [[lynx]]. The [[Halfling language|hin word]] for \"fox\" was ''rennard'', after the French word for a fox, ''renard''.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2016)/Altho Minstrelwish}} However, it was known that foxes existed on Toril far before the 1{{st}} century [[DR]], even in the times of ancient [[Netheril]].<ref group=\"note\">Foxes have appeared in earlier-set sources, such as in the time of Netheril in the novel ''[[Sword Play]]'', suggesting Altho was responsible for a different breed of fox or the reintroduction of foxes. Similarly, [[wombat]]s were claimed to have been brought to Toril from Earth.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-10-21 - Wombat Origins}}\n\nMuch like on Toril, there were a variety of animals on this planet that people harvested [[ivory]] from.

These gemstones were usually known by the people of Earth as \"ditroite\",  \"verde antique\", \"rhodizite\", and \"beryllonite\", respectively.\n\nBesides using them for adornment or magical purposes, the people of this world had gemstones serve as representations of their deities or guardian spirits. Some of their legends spoke of gems forming from tears, growing on trees, being excreted by [[horse]]s, or being spat out by a deity or hero."

            "Ancient History": "In the most ancient times of this planet, its landmasses were all part of a singular body of land known as [[Wikipedia:Pangea|Pangea]]. Over the course of this world's ancient history, it would be visited by [[spelljammer]]s on a few occasions.\n\nOn Toril, in the year {{Yearlink|-4366}}, the mages of a nation on the continent of [[Faerûn]] known as the [[Imaskar Empire]] sought to replenish their population after a devastating plague. To this end they opened two great ''[[gate]]s'' to another world, widely believed to have been Earth,{{Speculation}} and kidnapped numerous [[human]]s from different eras of that world's history to serve as their slaves. Those of [[Mulhorand]] hailed from [[Wikipedia:Ancient Egypt|a desert land]] given life by the seasonal flooding of [[Wikipedia:Nile|a great river]] and those of [[Unther]] from [[Wikipedia:Mesopotamia|another desert land]]. After transporting them back to Abeir-Toril, the Imaskari closed the gates forever. With them, these people brought their own societies, mature culture, and later, the gods of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] and [[Untheric pantheon]]s. And over time, through Intermarriage between the desert people and the [[Imaskari]], a new ethnic group would come to form known as the [[Mulan]].\n\nLater came [[Chessentan|a people]] from two lands: a [[Wikipedia:Ancient Greece|collection of city-states]] known for their daring philosophies and a [[Wikipedia:Ancient Roman|land of empire and glory]]; they had similar pantheons of gods. These were followed by folk from [[Wikipedia:Ireland|a rugged land]] with a culture tied to nature, the sea, and the warrior history of its [[Daghdha|dozen-king greater god]]. Each of these people brought their own societies and faiths, and others around the time of the rise of [[Netheril]].The sourcebook ''[[Elves of Evermeet]]'' states on page 4 that the silver elves' society on Evermeet had a strong influence of ancient Celtic culture.",
            "Modern History": "In the early stages of a time known as the [[Wikipedia:Victorian era|Victorian era]], a few spelljammers had visited this world.\n\n''Circa'' Earth year 1965 CE, Elminster first came to this world.{{Cite web/theedverse/2017-09-18 - Elminster 1965}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Timeline\">It's important to note right away that, in this article's attempt to document the visitations of Realms characters to Earth, there is no attempt made to line up Earth dates with Torilian dates or \"[[Marking the years|the marking of years]]\".

This included an introduction by Elminster's scribe [[Lhaeo]], written on the [[Nightal 30|last day of Nightal]].\n\nAround this decade a group of six young children stumbled through a ''portal'' that manifested at an amusement park, transporting them to a world known as the [[Realm]]. Years later the children found themselves on Toril and one of them, an aspiring wizard named [[Presto]], became an apprentice to Elminster.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}\n\nLater, Ed Greenwood and [[Steve Perrin]] \"spent many long days\" working with Elminster researching [[spell]]s, [[spellbook]]s, and [[magic item]]s. At Elminster's bidding, they compiled this lore into ''[[The Magister (sourcebook)|The Magister]]''.<ref><ref> In the {{YearlinkName|1358}} (''circa'' 1988 CE), [[Amelior Amanitas]] agreed to a request by Elminster, due to him generously sheltering Amelior after some incident in [[Volkumburgh]], to provide author [[Jennell Jaquays]] the wealth of information he had regarding [[the North]] and its history. This culminated in the sourcebook ''[[The Savage Frontier]]''. Around that time Ed of the Greenwood was exploring neglected corners of the Realms, sharing some of his lore with an [[elf]] from [[wikipedia:Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] and a would-be conqueror from [[wikipedia:Portland|Portland]].

It was similar in mood and tone, though not the actual tune, to \"[[The Ballad of the Dream Weaver]]\".\n\nThere was a nursery rhyme about a [[Wikipedia:Old Mother Hubbard|\"Mother Hubbard\"]] whose shelves were bare.{{Cite polyhedron/51/The Living City: The Downunda Patisserie|16,17,31}} And a novel by the name of ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', copies of which somehow found their way on to the [[Nelanther Isles]] of Toril.\n\nBoth worlds had [[Wikipedia:Heraldry|heraldry]], though they operated on different sets of rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/2566/ed-luskan.htm|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|title=Luskan Heraldry|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030108163242/http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/2566/ed-luskan.htm|archivedate=2003-01-08|work=Pages From the Sages|accessdate=2010-10-17}} The women of Earth often used a non-shield shape to display their coat of arms, such as a [[Wikipedia:Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]], while the women of Faerûn exclusively used shields.<ref>",
            "Cuisine": "[[File:Elminster and Mordenkainen-2e.jpg|thumb|220px|''Elminster and [[Mordenkainen]] partake in Earth food while in Ed of the Greenwood's home.<br/>The Earth writer covertly watches them from inside a suit of armor.'']]\nThere was a variety of unique and regional cuisine on this planet that Elminster adored. This included Australian [[beer]],{{Cite dragon/185/Magic in the Evening|59}} pina coladas,{{Cite dragon/69/Runestones|12}} [[Wikipedia:pizza|pizza]],{{Cite dragon/213/Series Magic|96}} [[Wikipedia:pumpernickel|pumpernickel]], a carbonated sugared drink known as [[cola nut|cola]],{{Cite dragon/185/Magic in the Evening|57}}{{Cite dragon/167/Game Wizards: Understanding Undermountain|88}} [[Wikipedia:Root beer|root beer]], and many varieties of [[cheese]], such as [[Wikipedia:String cheese|string cheese]].\n\nElminster, a self-described gourmand,{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-03 - Elminster's Visits to Earth in 2020}} The wizard [[Khelben Arunsun]] was partial to [[licorice|liquorice]]. And nearly all wizards of the Realms that interacted with this planet were seen to delight in [[Wikipedia:Butter tart|butter tarts]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-12-21 - Favorite Earth Cuisine}}\n\nSpecialist bakeries here that sold breads, cakes, and pastries were known as [[Wikipedia:Pâtisserie|\"patisseries\"]]. A mage, likely Elminster, claiming to have visited \"far places indeed\", suggested such a name to [[Jemima Chisolm]], owner of the [[Downunda Patisserie]] in [[Ravens Bluff]].",
            "Holidays": "[[File:DragonMirth-Santa.jpg|thumb|220px|''The people of Earth have wild speculations about how Father Christmas delivers so many gifts.<br />To adventurers of other worlds, a [[bag of holding]] would seem most logical.'']]\nDuring this world's [[Wikipedia:winter solstice|winter solstice]], many of its inhabitants celebrated a holiday known as [[Wikipedia:Yule|Yule]], from which a more commercial gift-giving holiday would later be derived known as [[Wikipedia:Christmas|Christmas]]. This holiday had personifications in the form of mysterious figures known as [[Wikipedia:Father Christmas|Father Christmas]] and [[Wikipedia:Santa Claus|Santa Claus]]. Elminster was well familiar with this holiday due to his frequent visits to Earth, as were to a lesser extent Laeral, [[the Simbul]], and [[Storm Silverhand]] of the Seven Sisters.\n\nWhenever Elminster was on Earth during the Christmas season he would provide aid to people, gift food, as well as use his spells to provide shelter and warmth from the winter cold to those in need in. He also enjoyed masquerading as the mysterious \"Father Christmas,\" performing small acts of magic observable to only one or two beings (particularly disillusioned adults and teens who have disavowed Father Christmas). He especially enjoyed showing up as such to Ed of the Greenwood's home on late [[Wikipedia:Christmas Eve|Christmas Eve]] or early Christmas morn', taking the time to raid his wine cellar. These charitable acts, especially the masquerade, were done as part of his duty as a [[Chosen of Mystra]] to foster a belief of magic in others and strengthen their sense of wonder.",
            "Martial Arts": "Much like the Realms, this world had a number of unique fighting styles. Elminster once noted that one of these styles, [[wikipedia:aikido|aikido]], bore similarities to a defensive fighting style practiced by the [[monk]]s of [[St. Noradnar's Hermitage]] that revolved around disarming and disabling one's opponent.<ref>",
            "Technology": "[[File:Elminster, Grubb, and Lowder.png|thumb|220px|From right to left: James Lowder and Jeff Grub struggle to record Elminster's long speeches in ''[[Everybody Wants to Run the Realms]]''.]]\nThis world had a number of strange devices that were unknown to the people of Toril. One such device known to Elminster was called a \"[[Wikipedia:Compact disk|\"CD\"]].<ref>{{Cite document/Sword Coast Survival Guide|43}}\n\nAnother such device, called a [[Wikipedia:tape recorder|\"tape recorder\"]], allowed a user to record audio and later play it back<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/54/The Everwinking Eye: Elminster's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|16}}{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|25}}{{Cite comic/Everybody Wants to Run the Realms|5}} through the use of \"tapes\" or [[Wikipedia:Cassette tape|\"cassettes\"]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/119/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Throat of Talduth Vale|7}} Much like similar devices in the Realms, these had a storage capacity limit. They were used on multiple occasions to record Elminster's speeches on the Realms for later documentation, such as by Ed of the Greenwood, [[James Lowder]], Jeff Grubb, and [[Jean Rabe]]. Due to how rambling and scatter-tongued the old sage could be, these Earthlings had to resort to making multiple recordings in order to catch his every word."
