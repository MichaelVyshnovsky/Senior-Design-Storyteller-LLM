'''Templar''' was one of the twelve moons of [[Garden]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
Templar was a small, {{SIAdj|12|ft|adj=thick}} discworld with a diameter of {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}}. Like most of Garden's moons, Templar was larger than its parent.

==Inhabitants==
The moon served as an outpost for a society of one hundred [[wizard]]s of all [[schools of magic]], who dedicated themselves to studying the secrets of Garden. They were able to survive on their small flatworld by the sale of [[magic item]]s.
