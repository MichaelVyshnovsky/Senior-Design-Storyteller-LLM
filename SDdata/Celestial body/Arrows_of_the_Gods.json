        "mainbody": "The '''Arrows of the Gods''', as it was commonly referred to in the [[Sword Coast North]], was a [[constellation]] in [[Realmspace]]. \n\nAmong the [[Bedine]] tribes of [[Anauroch]] it was known as '''At'ar's Arrows'''. In other regions of the Realms it was known as the '''Caltrop''' and '''Sun's Signpost'''.",
        "Description": "This constellation consisted of three lines of stars that converged and each ended in a cluster of stars at their outward point, which gave it a resemblance to a set of arrows. The Bedine of Anauroch shared this sentiment, but associated the Arrows with their goddess [[At'ar the Merciless]]. In some regions of the Realms they were thought to resemble a [[caltrop]] instead.\n\nWhere the three lines of stars converged was always the direction of true east in the North.",
        "Observation": "This constellation could be observed in the Anauroch and the Sword Coast North. It was especially visible from the village of [[Twilight Tor]] around the same time as the [[Simril]] festivities.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Stories told by the Bedine claimed that the Arrows had been shot into their place in the sky by their [[the sun|sun]] goddess, At'ar the Merciless, in order to permanently clear and mark the way for her to rise in that spot each day.\n\nSome [[Astrology|astrologers]] claimed that people born under this constellation were highly driven, took a direct approach to handling their problems, and had blunt personalities."
