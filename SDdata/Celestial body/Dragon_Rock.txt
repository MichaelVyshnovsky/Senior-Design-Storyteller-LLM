Dragon Rock was a spelljamming port and the most active asteroid in the Tears of Sel√ªne.
The asteroid had a surface about 10 mi (16 km) wide and was located near the edge of the Tears. It featured hundreds of docking ports.
The entire asteroid was owned by twelve honest and trustworthy traders.
The surface of Dragon Rock was entirely dedicated to trade. Docking vessels paid a fee of 1 sp per ton and could freely conduct trade across the asteroid. If they did not wish to stay long, traders had a choice of leaving their merchandise in the hands of the asteroids owners to be sold later on commission.
