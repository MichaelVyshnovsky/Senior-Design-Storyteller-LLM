'''Dragon Rock''' was a [[Spelljammer|spelljamming]] port and the most active asteroid in the [[Tears of Selûne]].

==Geography==
The asteroid had a surface about 10 mi (16 km) wide and was located near the edge of the Tears. It featured hundreds of docking ports.

==Government==
The entire asteroid was owned by twelve honest and trustworthy traders.

==Trade==
The surface of Dragon Rock was entirely dedicated to trade. Docking vessels paid a fee of 1 [[sp]] per ton and could freely conduct trade across the asteroid. If they did not wish to stay long, traders had a choice of leaving their merchandise in the hands of the asteroid's owners to be sold later on commission.

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Ocean's Wake]], a bar and restaurant owned by the rogue [[neogi]] [[Brassons]].

==Inhabitants==
* [[Brassons]], a former neogi slave trader who later became a follower of [[Torm]]. He owned the Ocean's Wake bar and was a good source of information.
