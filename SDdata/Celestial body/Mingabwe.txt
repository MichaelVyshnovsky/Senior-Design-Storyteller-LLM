'''Mingabwe''' was one of the three moons of the planet [[Glyth]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
Mingabwe was a spherical size-B [[Earth (element)|earth]] body, much smaller than [[Toril]]'s moon [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]], which was some {{SI|1000|mile|k|long=yes}} in radius by comparison. From the surface of Glyth, the moon was very beautiful.

Mingabwe orbited Glyth at a distance of {{SI|235000|mile|k|long=yes}}, {{SI|208000|mi|k|long=yes}} from the last of Glyth's four rings. It had its own tiny moon, called [[Polluter]], which was a tiny crater-covered ball with frozen water but no atmosphere.

The Mingabwe's surface was constantly bitter cold, but it never snowed. It was completely covered, however, in packed ice with the only warm areas being where shelters had been built for visitors.

Mingabwe had a single port settlement that was very welcoming to [[spelljammer]]s. Any vessels approaching any closer to the surface of Glyth, however, were likely to be attacked by patrolling [[illithid]]s. The settlement consisted of a few scattered buildings, including inns and trading posts,The ''[[Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace]]'' computer game has Mingabwe charging a 155-[[gp]] mooring fee and a 120-gp air tax, but this conflicts with the [[Realmspace (sourcebook)|''Realmspace'']] sourcebook, which is higher in the canon hierarchy.

==Flora & Fauna==
Hardy, edible plants grew on Mingabwe and were freely available to be picked. There was also water, but as it became more and more scarce, this caused distress to the moon's plant life.

Insects were the only form of animal life.

==Inhabitants==
There was some confusion about the number of settlers on Mingabwe. One scholar of the Realms claimed that only a single man, [[Justin Demonslayer]], lived on the moon. As of [[1360 DR]], he had lived there for over 10 years.

Strangely, that same scholar went on to describe a settlement with multiple persons residing there. These persons were described as generally trusting and good-natured. This was perhaps because there was nowhere to hide on Mingabwe should someone steal from them or commit some other crime. (In fact, only two thieves in the entire history of Mingabwe ever got away with their thefts.) Once thieves had been caught and punished, most folks were ready to implicitly trust them again—for one more chance. Repeat offenders were never seen again, their fates unknown.

==Society==
There was no formal government,
