        "mainbody": "The Eyes of the Watching Woman, as it was commonly referred to in the Sword Coast North, was a constellation in Realmspace. \nAmong the Bedine tribes of Anauroch it was known as The Two Jambiyas and less frequently as the Eyes of Elah. In the Moonshae Isles it was known as The Double Daggers. The inhabitants of Hills Edge were known to vaguely refer to it as \"where Selune looks back.\"\nThe two clusters of blue-white stars that comprised this constellation gave the appearance of two, side-by-side crescents pointing downward, which gave it a resemblance to a pair of eyes. Inhabitants of Hills Edge and some Bedine shared this sentiment and both associated it with the goddess Selune. However, most Bedine in Anauroch felt that the two clusters of stars instead resembled a pair of jambiyas. Similarly, inhabitants of the Moonshea Isles felt that they resembled a pair of daggers.\nThe Eyes were situated across from the constellation Arrows of the Gods. In the North, true west was always known to be in the direction between the two clusters of stars that comprised the constellation.\nThis constellation could be observed in the Anauroch, Hills Edge, the Moonshae Isles, and the Sword Coast North. It was especially visible from the village of Twilight Tor around the same time as the Simril festivities.\nBy the late-15 century DR, there were no known surviving stories behind the name that inhabitants of the Sword Coast North had for this constellation.\nSome astrologers claimed that people born under this constellation were highly sociable and displayed a great degree of adaptability."
