        "mainbody": "The '''Eyes of the Watching Woman''', as it was commonly referred to in the [[Sword Coast North]], was a [[constellation]] in [[Realmspace]]. \n\nAmong the [[Bedine]] tribes of [[Anauroch]] it was known as '''The Two Jambiyas''' and less frequently as the '''Eyes of Elah'''. In the [[Moonshae Isles]] it was known as '''The Double Daggers'''. The inhabitants of [[Hill's Edge]] were known to vaguely refer to it as \"where [[Selune]] looks back.\"",
        "Description": "The two clusters of blue-white stars that comprised this constellation gave the appearance of two, side-by-side crescents pointing downward, which gave it a resemblance to a pair of eyes. Inhabitants of Hill's Edge and some Bedine shared this sentiment and both associated it with the goddess Selune. However, most Bedine in Anauroch felt that the two clusters of stars instead resembled a pair of [[jambiya]]s. Similarly, inhabitants of the Moonshea Isles felt that they resembled a pair of [[dagger]]s.\n\nThe Eyes were situated across from the constellation [[Arrows of the Gods]]. In the North, true west was always known to be in the direction between the two clusters of stars that comprised the constellation.",
        "Observation": "This constellation could be observed in the Anauroch, Hill's Edge, the Moonshae Isles, and the Sword Coast North. It was especially visible from the village of [[Twilight Tor]] around the same time as the [[Simril]] festivities.",
        "History": "By the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], there were no known surviving stories behind the name that inhabitants of the Sword Coast North had for this constellation.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some [[Astrology|astrologers]] claimed that people born under this constellation were highly sociable and displayed a great degree of adaptability."
