'''Nerath''', also known to its inhabitants as "'''The First Work'''", was a world that existed in a different continuum, parallel to that of [[Toril]].

==Cosmography==
The world of Nerath was located in the same [[Prime Material plane]] where the world of Abeir-Toril, among others, existed, but was separated from it by a unthinkably long distance. While it was possible to reach Nerath by traveling beyond the known regions of the [[Astral Plane]] or the [[Elemental Chaos]], such a travel would take many long years and it was easier just to find a [[portal]] that connected both worlds.

===Gateways===
There was at least one known portal to Nerath in [[Sigil]].

[[Baba Yaga]] knew of Nerath and had probably even visited in her [[Baba Yaga's Hut|dancing hut]], which traveled all the worlds and planes. In its Hall of Gateways, a portal called the World Gate linked to every world Baba Yaga knew of, as well as their respective [[Shadowfell]]s and [[Feywild]]s.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/196/Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut|52}}<ref group="note" >While the world of Nerath is not specifically mentioned in the adventure, Baba Yaga is among the archfey known by the people of that world, according to the 4th edition Manual of the Planes (page 36).

==Notable locations==
The [[w:c:pointsoflight:Nentir Vale|Nentir Vale]] was a small vale located in a northern region of this world, where the town of [[Fallcrest]] was located. The [[Silver Unicorn Inn]], where [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] was founded, was one of Fallcrest's more popular inns.

==Notable individuals==
The [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Demascus]] and the [[plague demon]]s [[Murmur]] and [[Scour]] were originally from this world.

[[Omin Dran]], [[Jim Darkmagic]] and [[Binwin Bronzebottom]] were also from this world.<ref group="note">[[Acquisitions Incorporated (sourcebook)]] mentions that [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] was founded in the city of Fallcrest. Fallcrest is the sample city located in the Nentir Vale, described in page 196 of the 4th edition Dungeon Master's Guide.

The [[wizard]]s [[Mordenkainen]] and [[Emirikol]] had visited this world at least once.

==History in Relation to the Realms==
===Ancient History===
In ancient times, the [[dragonborn]] ruled a world-spanning empire named [[w:c:pointsoflight:Arkhosia|Arkhosia]], that warred against [[w:c:pointsoflight:Bael Turath|Bael Turath]], an empire ruled by [[tiefling]]s. Eventually both empires destroyed each other in a devastating war.{{Cite dragon/365/Ecology of the Dragonborn|26}} Even though both races had a long tradition of "enmity", those empires existed so long ago that the dragonborn of [[Tymanther]] in the late years of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] considered such enmity more theoretical than practical.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|Chapter 2}}<ref group="note">The ancient empires of the dragonborn and tieflings mentioned in [[Venom in Her Veins]] seem to be a reference to Arkhosia and Bael Turath, two ancient empires that existed in the world of Nerath. While there is no evidence in Realmslore of said empires existing in the past history of Abeir-Toril, the lore of said empires mentions that they build some colonies in other worlds and planes. Perhaps the history of these ancient empires was discovered by the dragonborn and tieflings of the Realms from these places.

===Modern History===
Approximately 100 years before the fall of the empire of [[w:c:pointsoflight:Nerath_(Empire)|Nerath]] (the great empire of [[human]]kind on this world), worshipers of [[Tharizdun]] native to this world went to Sigil, and from there to [[Pandemonium]], trying to free their god from its ancient prison. They ultimately failed, thanks to the efforts of heroes from the world of Nerath, among them the deva Demascus. However, the evil cultists managed to unleash the [[Abyssal Plague (disease)|abyssal plague]] into many worlds of the multiverse, including Toril.{{Cite dungeon/192/Creature Incarnations: Abyssal Plague Demons}}

==Religion==
===Deities===
Some deities from this world were summoned by the gods of [[Realmspace]] during the [[Dawn War]], to help them defend the newly born worlds of the Material Plane against the [[primordial]] threat.<ref><ref> 

The patron goddess of Demascus, [[Ioun (deity)|Ioun]], was originated from this world. The [[Raven Queen]] and [[Torog]] were also said to have originated from Nerath.

Of the gods of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]], [[Bane]] was worshiped in Nerath as a god of conquest and war.
