The King-Killer Star was a reddish cometary body visible from Toril that was once linked to the Dracorage mythal. Its periodic appearance in the skies of Abeir-Toril caused dragons to go mad with rage, destroying and killing without reason.
The name of the King-Killer Star originated from when the gold dragon known as King Orchrtrien witnessed the red comet and entered into the dracorage. Orchrtrien attacked his loyal subjects, who were forced to kill him in self-defense. While dying, Orchtrien whispered "The red star murdered me."
Lady Winterflower Duskmere was in possession of a stolen copy of a tome from King Orchtriens Library of Draconic Magic. The tome was one of many that had been secretly copied by Rhespen Ash of Dawnfire in . The copy of the tome was a  metaphysical treatise on the fundamental nature of dragons and their links to the forces of creation, the elements of nature, and the stars.  It is inferred that this copy ultimately gave key information to the elves rebelling against dragon rule and led to the first appearance of the comet.
An attempt was made near the end of the Time of Dragons by dragonkind to destroy the King-Killer Star. The missed shot nicked Selûne and created the Tears. The dragon Kisonraathiisar learned of this and inscribed it on one of his scales for posterity.
In the late 15 century, a blue dragon wyrmling named Sparkrender used the passage of the comet to perform a ritual to absorb the power of the great dragons of old that died on Stormwreck Isle.
