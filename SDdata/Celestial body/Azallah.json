        "mainbody": "Azallah was the name of another world. It was accessible through the Source Stone, but it is unknown if it is on the same plane of existence as Toril.\nIslands could be found across the planet, at least some of which floated above the bodies of water and bore cities. The elven city of Sahaladar was considered the greatest of the floating cities in all of Azallah. Beneath the waves were the underwater cities of the Kilm.\nAzallah was known to be home to elves and the Kilm, an aquatic race. The two enjoyed friendly relations.\nAmong them were the paladin Asheera and the Shining Order, who vowed to defended Sahaladar.\nThe world was considered peaceful by the paladin Asheera. But then the world was one of many invaded by Morag and her army of Old Ones, who raided the cities.\nFinally, the magicians of Sahaladar discovered a portal into the Source Stone, the demiplane from which the Old Ones originated. The elves of Sahaladar forged an amulet that would protect against Morag and the Old Ones, and selected six heroes, among them Asheera, to go into the Source Stone and stop Morag.\nBut they failed in their quest, and only Asheera was left alive within the Source Stone. There, she encountered a hero from Toril on a similar mission in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. She granted this hero the amulet to carry on her quest."
