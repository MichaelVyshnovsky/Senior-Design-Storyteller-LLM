The name of this twin planet means life, vitality, the experience of living, and the cycle of life, depending on the words around it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1355632073432817667|title=@TheEdVerse on Twitter|author=Ed Greenwood|date=30|year=2021|month=January}}",
        "Geography": "Abeir had a steel-colored sky due to the [[Arambar (energy)|arambar]], the residual energy left by the death of the [[primordial]] of the [[Arambar|same name]].\n\nThe known continents of Abeir were [[Shyr]], [[Marranth]], [[Irronther]],{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBeeDMJFnzo|title=A Conversation With Elminster About Abeir - Youtube|author=Ed Greenwood|accessyear=2024|accessmonthday=May 15th}} and [[Laerakond]] (at least before it was transferred to Toril), as well as a few archipelagos such as the [[Cold Strait]], the [[Ice Run (Abeir)|Ice Run]], and the [[Khannath]]; and a region of which little was known, [[Lhoraun]]. Among the known bodies of water of Abeir were the [[Andol Sea]], the [[Arserpent Sea]], the [[Boiling Sea]], the [[Dun Seas]], the [[Frozen Seas]], and the [[Oshlar Sea]]. \n\nLike Toril, it also contained an [[Abeiran Underdark|Underdark]] (known as the [[Nardark]] to the local inhabitants). \n\nFor a time, [[Maztica]] was also part of this world as a consequence of the [[Spellplague]], but this landmass was returned to Toril during the [[Second Sundering]].{{Cite dragon+/11/Lore You Should Know: Tabaxi vs. tabaxi}}",
        "Inhabitants": "Abeir was inhabited primarily by primordials, [[dragon]]s, [[dragonborn]], [[dwarves]], [[genasi]], [[halfling]]s, [[human]]s, and a few other races that also inhabited Toril.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stirring the Embers|52}} \n\n[[Elves]] and other [[fey]] creatures were almost unheard of on Abeir, although [[drow]] were known to inhabit its Underdark.\n\nAbeir was also inhabited by [[abomination]]s and other aberrant creatures from the [[Far Realm]], most of them the original inhabitants of [[Abeir-Toril]].",
        "Languages": "The people of Abeir primarily spoke the languages of [[Thorass]] and [[Aklave]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-09-16/Abeiran languages}}",
        "Magic": "[[Magic]] manifested differently on Abeir than in Toril, as there was no [[Weave]] and no normal way to contact any [[god]]s, as gods were wary about this world. Likewise, [[Cosmology|Planar]] magic (or at least planar magic that depended on the [[Nine Hells]]), such as that granted to [[warlock]]s by a pact, also worked differently and was more difficult to use than on Toril.\n\nThe only magic that worked normally on Abeir was that a creature could create on its own, such as the inherent [[elemental magic]] a primordial had in its body or a [[dragon breath|dragon's breath]].{{Cite dragon/379/Displaced Lands and Dire Frontiers|73}} [[Swordmage]]s, on the other hand, were common among the genasi of Shyr.{{Cite dragon/379/Displaced Lands and Dire Frontiers|69-70}}\n\nMagic items also worked normally on Abeir, and Abeiran dragons usually scavenged primordial corpses in order to create powerful [[artifact]]s from their remains, such as the [[Breath of Petron]].\n\n[[Psionics]] were also a type of magic that could be used on this world, however this kind of magic seemed to be as uncommon on Abeir as it was on Toril.\n\nCreating artificial [[portal]]s to Abeir was nearly impossible, but a few natural portals connected Abeir and Toril.",
        "History": "After [[Ao]] sundered the world of Abeir-Toril, splitting it into the two twin planets, Abeir and Toril, he gave Abeir to the few primordials who survived the [[Dawn War]] to rule. Those primordials were tired of war and were unable to overcome their dragon steeds when those rebelled against them, starting the conflict known as the [[War of Fang and Talon]].{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}} After the war the few primordials who survived retreated into hiding and fell silent, and only a handful of dragon lords survived. Not long after, a mighty dragon called [[Gorloun]] founded the first dragon empire, and soon rival draconic realms sprang up thereafter, and the long [[Rule of Dragons]] began. \n\nThese nations quarreled each other for ages, but draconic rule remained nearly unchallenged until the [[Spellplague|Blue Breath of Change]], when both worlds merged for a certain time. Laerakond and other regions of Abeir were transported to Toril, and the fate of the remaining nations on the world of Abeir became a mystery to [[Faerûn]]ian sages."
