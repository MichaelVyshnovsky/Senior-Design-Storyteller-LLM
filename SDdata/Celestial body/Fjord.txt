'''Fjord''' was one of the twelve moons of [[Garden]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
Like most of Garden's moons, Fjord was larger than its parent, but there was confusion about its size and shape. Astronomical records indicated that it was spherical, yet its dimensions were listed as {{SI|67|mi|k|long=yes}} by {{SI|69|mi|k|long=yes}}, indicating rather an ellipsoid.<ref group="note" name="shape" /> Its rocky surface had no atmosphere.

==History==
Fjord was once a prosperous mining colony, but it had been abandoned by the later 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
