The '''Tuhgri''' was one of many [[crystal sphere]]s that were suspended in [[phlogiston]].

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], a new yet unnamed universe was being born just outside the worlds of the Tuhgri crystal sphere. [[Lathander]], a [[Toril]]lian deity known as the Morninglord encouraged his paramour - [[Chauntea]] the Earthmother to witness the blossoming. The newborn universe was shaped as two tiny crystal spheres, nestled together similarly to an egg cluster of [[faerie dragon]]s. Lathander claimed that when the newborn crystal spheres bumped against each other awash with waves of phlogiston, they chimed.
