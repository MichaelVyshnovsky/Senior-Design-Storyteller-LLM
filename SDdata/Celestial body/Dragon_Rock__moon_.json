        "Description": "Like most of Garden's moons, Dragon Rock was larger than its parent, being about {{SI|121|mi|k|long=yes}} and {{SI|32|mi|k|long=yes}} wide. It was bizarrely shaped like a [[white dragon]] and was composed entirely of white [[jade]].\n\nThe slight atmosphere of Dragon Rock smelled like pipe smoke.",
        "Inhabitants": "The moon was inhabited by an evil [[wizard]] known as [[Darkon (wizard)|Darkon of the Earth's Depths]], who was also responsible for the creation of the moon. He built the massive structure to observe and study Garden."
