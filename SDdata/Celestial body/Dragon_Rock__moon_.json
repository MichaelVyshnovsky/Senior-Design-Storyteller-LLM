It was bizarrely shaped like a white dragon and was composed entirely of white jade.\nThe slight atmosphere of Dragon Rock smelled like pipe smoke.\nThe moon was inhabited by an evil wizard known as Darkon of the Earths Depths, who was also responsible for the creation of the moon. He built the massive structure to observe and study Garden."
