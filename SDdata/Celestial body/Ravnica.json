It was ruled over by ten influential guilds that vied for power amongst each other.\nThe world existed within its own plane of existence—also called Ravnica—separate from the Prime Material plane that housed Toril and its crystal sphere.\nThe ten guilds of Ravnica held power over its people for thousands of years, forming a web of power dynamics, political intrigue, and large-scale conflicts that spanned the planets entire surface.\nRavnica was a place of immense financial opportunity, that attracted businesses and merchants from across the multiverse.\nMany of the races native to Toril also dwelled on Ravnica, including humans, elves, centaurs, ogres, giants, merfolk, minotaurs, sphinxes, and dragons. It was also home to some beings native to the Feywild, such as dryads, and others from the Outer Planes, including angels, demons, and devils.\nThe warrens of the Ravnicas undercity house a variety of shadowy creatures, that had coarse gray skin and no mouths upon their faces.\n* Sylvene, a planewalker who traveled to Toril in the mid–15 century DR, and found new friends and love in the city of Waterdeep.\n* Tyreus, the power-hungry wizard that sought after the Stone of Creation."
