Lake Halruaa was located toward the center of Halruaa.
Filled by the Rivers Halar, Maeru and Aluar, Lake Halruaa dominated the center of the Halruaan landscape.
Wind blowing down from the mountains made navigating Lake Halruaa tricky, but it did offer a slight respite from the blazing temperatures that most of the country experienced year round.
