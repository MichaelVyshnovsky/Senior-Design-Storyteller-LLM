Lost Lovers Pool was a pool hidden within a cave in the Shalanar Barony of Erlkazar.
The pool was located hidden within a coastal cave along Shalane Lake, north of the city of Llorbauth. The caves entrance was only open during low tides.The sourcebook erroneously describes this as a "sea cave", and, as the Deepwash is an inland lake, it is also doubtful that it could have had noticeable tides. For comparison, the largest and deepest lake on Earth, Lake Baikal, only has a tidal difference of about  in its depth, which hardly seems enough to hide the entrance to a cave. Furthermore, while we are not given the full dimensions of the Deepwash in any source, it can be estimated from maps to be about  long, which is half the length of Lake Baikal, so we should expect smaller tides.On the other hand, tides are complicated occurrences, and one could speculate about other factors that could enhance the tidal differences of the lake. Perhaps the Deepwash was exceptionally deep—even deeper than Lake Baikal on Earth—making up for its smaller size and width compared to Lake Baikal. The Deepwash runs east-to-west rather than north-to-south, which might also play a factor. Finally, by some accounts, the moon Selûne is much closer to Toril than the Moon is to Earth, which would also strengthen the tides. See this articles talk page for more discussion.
The pool was so named because of a legend about a newly wed couple who mysteriously vanished in the pool and were never seen again.
