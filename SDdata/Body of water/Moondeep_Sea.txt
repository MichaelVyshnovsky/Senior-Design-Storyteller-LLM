The '''Moondeep Sea''' was a subterranean lake, approximately {{SI|240|miles|k|long=yes}} wide, found in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Galena Mountains]] and the cold plains of [[Vaasa]].

==Geography==
The Moondeep Sea was located in the [[Upperdark]]. The cavern which contained it was known as the [[Vault of Gnashing Teeth]], so named for the countless animated skulls stuck to the cavern's ceiling. The water of the lake was fed from the [[Great Glacier]].

The lake was surrounded by a confusing network of tunnels and caverns known as the "Lost Ways," remnants of the ancient [[Dwarf]] kingdom of [[Sarphil]]. These passages wound beneath the lake and deeper into the Underdark.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

The lake was magically connected to the [[Moonsea]] so that moonlight hitting it would be reflected on the surface of its Underdark counterpart.

The city of [[V'elddrinnssharâ€Ž]] lay on a mile-wide island dominated by a plateau in the middle of the lake.

===Flora and Fauna===
The Moondeep Sea was known for its [[giant water spider]]s.
