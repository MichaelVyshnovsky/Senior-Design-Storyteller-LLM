'''Patzcoatl''', or '''the Western Ocean''', was the massive body of water on the western side of the continent of [[Maztica]].

==Geography==
The Western Ocean washed the shores of [[Huetle Island]], and had several villages built on its shores: [[Ixit]], [[Honal]], and [[Azcat]], while the [[Bay of Kolan]] was a sheltered shallow bay inhabited by the [[Kolan]] [[human]] tribes.

==Inhabitants==
The shores of Patzcoatl were inhabited by the sea-faring [[Metahel]] tribes of Maztica, who were exceptional fishers. The Metahel peoples also hunted [[whale]]s that inhabited the waters of the Western Ocean. The tribe also traded in materials gathered, caught, and produced from the Patzcoatl ocean: shells, [[mussel]]s, [[dried fish]], as well as lamp [[whale oil]].

[[Kolan]] tribes of Maztica dwelt in humble villages along the shores of the Western Ocean, sheltered from the [[Huacli]] nation by a mountain chain.

The [[Azuposi]] spirit known as the [[Spider Woman]], or Sus'sistinako dwelled in [[Wenimats]], in a kiva from whence her lover, the Sun, visited her every day, bringing the light to the [[True World]].
