        "mainbody": "The '''Winding River''' was the longest and wildest river of the [[Old Empires]] region. It was found in eastern [[Chessenta]]{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Year of the Ageless One|5}} until the Untherans were able to recover the northern part of their former nation after the [[Second Sundering]] of [[1487 DR]].",
        "Geography": "The Winding River was in the [[Adder Peaks]] and ran across all of Chessenta and part of Unther until it flowed into the [[Methmere]]. The river was dangerous and treacherous, and even expert and veteran sailors thought twice before navigating its waters.",
        "Inhabitants": "It was believed that hermits and [[troll]]s lived near its riverbanks, although such rumors were never confirmed."
