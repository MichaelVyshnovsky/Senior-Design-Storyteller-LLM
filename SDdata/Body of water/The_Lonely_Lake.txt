The '''Lonely Lake''' was an oasis found on the outskirts of the [[Plains of Purple Dust]] in [[east Faerûn]] and the [[Hordelands]].

==Geography==
The oasis was nestled in the foothills on the eastern slopes of the [[Sword Mountains (Mulhorand)|Sword Mountains]] just north of [[Fuirgar]], the Land of the Stone Giants. Its location made it the only source of fresh water for hundreds of miles.
