Siiluth was a natural bay found on the elven island homeland of Evermeet.
Siiluth was found along Evermeets southeastern shore along the Trackless Sea. It lay approximately  northeast of Drelagara.
The beach bordering the bay was unique in that it was the only area of coast along the perimeter of the entire island that actually resembled a beach with sand, whereas the trees of the island abutted the shore everywhere else. The sands of the beach were pure white and had a fine texture.
Siiluth was where the elves constructed the majority of their sailing vessels.
