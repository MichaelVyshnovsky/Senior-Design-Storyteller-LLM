        "mainbody": "The '''Sea of Fallen Stars''', also known as the '''Inner Sea''', was the largest inland body of water in [[Faerûn]]. Its major areas included the [[Dragonmere]], also known as the Lake of Dragons, in the west; the [[Dragon Reach|Dragon]] and [[Easting Reach|Easting]] Reaches in the north; the [[Alamber Sea]] in the east; and the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the south.{{Cite web/FRmap}} The undersea realms of the Inner Sea were collectively referred to by its inhabitants as [[Serôs]].\n\nThe sea served as a crucial trade way for the powers of [[Interior Faerûn|central]] and [[North Faerûn|northern Faerûn]] and beyond. From [[Cormyr's Imperial Navy]] and [[Sembia]]'s 15,000 sailors and corsairs in the west, to the small but hardy fleet of dozen [[Impiltur]]an warships in the east, and the militia-navy of [[Turmish]] in the south, the waters of the Inner Sea were well-traveled by ships that flew the flags of coastal nations in central  Faerûn.",

            "Territorial Waters": "There was a recognized territorial limit of ten miles (16.1 kilometers) offshore among all the nations on the Sea of Fallen Stars. Areas of sea further than ten miles from the nearest land were considered neutral territory. Any attacks on shipping within a country's waters were considered to be acts of war. For most areas, these boundaries were clear, but they became more ambiguous in [[Mulhorand]], [[Thay]], and [[Unther]], owing to continual border disputes."

        "Trade": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[carrack]]s, [[round ship]]s, and [[cog]]s were the most common vessels engaged in trade on the Sea, but [[caravel]]s were becoming more common. \n\nMuch of the 15{{th}} century DR [[jade]] found in the [[Western Heartlands]] came from the Sea of Fallen Stars.",
        "History": {
            "Creation": "Over the millennia, different creation myths regarding the sea spread across the Realms. One tale, which explained how the sea earned its name, was detailed in the [[book]] ''[[History of the Last March of the Giants]]''. It said that the gods above sent a star crashing down to [[Abeir-Toril]] as a punishment for the arrogance of the [[titan]]s. Entire continents were lost in the ensuing earthquakes, fires, and windstorms and the four centrally located seas of [[Faerûn]] merged together, forming the \"Sea of Fallen Stars\".\n\nOther theories maintained the cataclysmic change of landscape was actually the eggs of the first [[dragon]]s raining down onto Toril.{{fact}}\n\nThe true creation of the sea occurred ages ago, in the final years of the [[Days of Thunder]], when the [[primordial]] [[Asgorath|Asgorath the World Shaper]], along with the first [[dragon]]s, were released from their imprisonment by the [[creator race]] known as the [[batrachi]]. In an event known as the [[Tearfall]], the deity hurled an ice moon down to the surface of [[Abeir-Toril]], which wiped out the batrachi and formed the sea.\n\n[[Sarrukh]] accounts dated around {{Yearlink|-31000}} mentioned a \"changing of the stars\" in relation to this event. Few knew what this really signified, but the fact was [[Ao]] created a duplicate of the planet, [[Abeir]], and sent the new world to another realm, with different stellar cartography.{{fact}} Other written accounts note that during the time of its creation an [[avatar]] of the goddess [[Istishia]] was present.",
            "Pirate Wars": "{{sectstub}}\nThe Pirate Wars started in 1201 DR when the pirate lord [[Immurk]] died from a heart attack. Leaving his rough coalition to fall apart. Half a dozen pirates declared themselves to be the succesor of Immurk. During this time several of the most vicious pirates arrose to take the [[Dragonisle]], the stronghold of Immurk. [[Urdogen]] “a red-haired hot-blooded bear of a man,” eventually came to dominate the Dragonisle. Once the internal warfare was over the pirates started raiding the the coastal villages and ships which could not be ignored by the Inner Sea Kingdoms.<ref>",
            "Time of Troubles": "{{sectstub}}\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], the [[chaotic evil]] goddess of the ocean [[Umberlee]] spent much of her time occupying the Sea of Fallen Stars. She caused widespread storms and destruction across many of the [[Pirate Isles]]. Following the return of her divine status, the Sea continued to be turbulent and often stormy. ''Circa'' [[1366 DR]], a group of merchant costers allegedly in league with the [[Iron Throne]] promoted an organized effort to appease her. In the years proceeding this effort the waters of the Sea became gradually calmer.",
            "Spellplague": "On [[Tarsakh 29]] [[1385 DR]], the [[Spellplague]] hit Toril and greatly changed the landscape of the planet. Large openings erupted within the [[Underdark]] and large portions of the sea drained out beneath Toril's surface, greatly lowering the sea level over the next ten years. Coastal cities that once rested on the banks of the sea were made land-locked, and formerly submerged ruins and wrecks were subsequently exposed. One of such resurfaced islands was Hegruth, an Island with a tower that's been submerged in the Sea of Fallen Stars for millennia. The tower ruin of unknown origin and obscurity made it the perfect place for clandestine meetings. The island did not appear on any terrestrial maps.<ref>",
            "The Second Sundering and the Great Rain": "During the [[Second Sundering]] in the autumn of [[1485 DR]], the [[Great Rain]] began to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued unceasingly for over a year. This constant storm caused massive floods; thousands perished from drowning, lightning strikes, or bursts of wind that capsized ships. By the time the rain abated, the Sea of Fallen Stars had swollen back to something approximating its former size, flooding vast tracts of land and numerous cities beneath the waves.<ref>"
