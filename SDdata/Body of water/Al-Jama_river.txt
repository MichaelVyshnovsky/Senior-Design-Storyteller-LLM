Two necks formed Al-Jama River. The eastern neck originated in the southern foothills of [[Al-Sayaj Mountains]], flowing southwest. The western neck originated in the southwest corner of the Cities of the Pantheon, flowing eastward. The city of [[Hudid]] was located where the two necks converged just inland from the shore of the [[Crowded Sea]].
