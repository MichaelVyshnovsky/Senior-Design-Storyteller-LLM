        "Description": "The Springbrook River began in the [[Oakenhall]]'s plateau, up in the [[Elder Spires]] at the heart of the island. The river cascaded from the western side of the mountains and continued seven miles into the Grandlore Forest until it emptied into the Springbrook Shallows.\n\nThe shadow lake was a pool of about {{SI|4'|'\"|long=yes}} deep with its waters always remaining unpolluted and fresh. The Springbrook Shallows was considered a holy place by the [[Church of Silvanus]] and members of the [[Emerald Enclave]]. It was believed that the Oak Father himself bathed in the Springbrook Shallows when visiting the [[Prime Material plane]]."
