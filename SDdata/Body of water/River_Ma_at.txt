The '''River Ma'at''' was a wide, slow-moving body of water that twisted through much of the [[Outlands]].

==Geography==
The source of this river was a large lake near the center of the [[Spire]], particularly a [[divine realm]] half of it known as [[Semuanya's Bog]]. It regularly overflowed at its lower banks, carving a path through the rolling hills of the plane.

The River Ma'at mostly flowed along the seventh ring (or layer) of the Outlands, occasionally crossing through other layers. The distance between the River Ma'at and Torch was roughly a journey of three to eighteen days.<ref>

Throughout the area of Thoth's Estate, the River Ma'at was bordered on either side by deserts and swamps.<ref> There were also a number of villages and towns that dotted its banks in this realm, inhabited largely by the [[petitioner]]s of [[Thoth]].

===Flora & Fauna===
It was quite common to come across [[crocodile]]s and crocodile-like creatures living within the River Ma'at.

==History==
During the reign of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], a [[half-elven]] [[paladin]] of [[Oghma]] from [[Cormyr]] was dispatched on a mission to explore the [[planes of existence]] beyond [[Toril]]. The paladin's name was [[Ambran|Ambran the Seeker]], and excerpts from his journal still survived to the [[Present Age]]. In volume 7, Ambran described how he hired a [[bariaur]] guide named [[Glin]] to take him from [[Sigil]] to the Outlands. Then Volume 9 told of his journey from Ribcage to Automata. Once there, he was able to witness the [[Great Modron March|Modron Parade]] before continuing on to the River Ma'at, accompanied by both Glin and [[Rialiva]], a member of the [[Doomguard]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/204/The Plane Truth Part II: A Journey to the Outlands|31}}
