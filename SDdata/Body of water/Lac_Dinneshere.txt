'''Lac Dinneshere''' ({{Pronounce|lack|_|DIN|eh|sheer|refs=}}) was one of the three lakes of [[Icewind Dale]] in the [[Frozenfar]] of the [[Sword Coast North]] that the [[Ten Towns]] clustered around.

==Geography==
Most of the shoreline of Lac Dinneshere was rocky bluffs and barren tundra. All year round, the waters of Lac Dinneshere were cold enough to kill in minutes anyone entering the lake.

==History==
The lake earned its name from its first human settlers, the [[Nobility of Cormyr|noble]] [[Dinev]] family of [[Cormyr]]. After leaving their home kingdom sometime before the late 11{{th}} century [[DR]], they built their new familial keep on the banks of [[Knucklehead Harbor]].

In the 12{{th}} century, the warrior [[Aihonen]] slayed the [[white dragon]] [[Icasaracht]] on the banks of Lac Dinneshere. Both the dragon and the warrior died in the battle, and Icasaracht sank beneath the lake's icy waters.

==Inhabitants==
Lac Dinneshere was one of three known places where the [[knucklehead trout]] live, the other two being the lake of [[Maer Dualdon]] and [[Redwaters]]. However, one of the lake's aquatic elves made contact with a group of adventurers and a fisher in the town of [[Easthaven]] in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}.

==Rumors & Legends== 
The [[Blade of Aihonen|sword]] of the hero Aihonen possessed powerful enchantments when it was wielded within a "dragon's flight" of Lac Dinneshere.

The Lac Dinneshere was haunted by a ghost of a woman known as the [[White Lady (spirit)|White Lady]]. The Lady died while her husband was away, amassing a fortune for their shared future, and after her death, appeared at shore of the lake where they first met.
