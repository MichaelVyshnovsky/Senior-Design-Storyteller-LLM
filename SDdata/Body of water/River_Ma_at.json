The paladin's name was [[Ambran|Ambran the Seeker]], and excerpts from his journal still survived to the [[Present Age]]. In volume 7, Ambran described how he hired a [[bariaur]] guide named [[Glin]] to take him from [[Sigil]] to the Outlands. Then Volume 9 told of his journey from Ribcage to Automata. Once there, he was able to witness the [[Great Modron March|Modron Parade]] before continuing on to the River Ma'at, accompanied by both Glin and [[Rialiva]], a member of the [[Doomguard]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/204/The Plane Truth Part II: A Journey to the Outlands|31}}"
