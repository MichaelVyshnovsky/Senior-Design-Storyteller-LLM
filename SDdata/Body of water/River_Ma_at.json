        "mainbody": "The River Maat was a wide, slow-moving body of water that twisted through much of the Outlands.\nThe source of this river was a large lake near the center of the Spire, particularly a divine realm half of it known as Semuanyas Bog. It regularly overflowed at its lower banks, carving a path through the rolling hills of the plane.\nThe River Maat mostly flowed along the seventh ring (or layer) of the Outlands, occasionally crossing through other layers. The distance between the River Maat and Torch was roughly a journey of three to eighteen days.\nThroughout the area of Thoths Estate, the River Maat was bordered on either side by deserts and swamps. There were also a number of villages and towns that dotted its banks in this realm, inhabited largely by the petitioners of Thoth.\nIt was quite common to come across crocodiles and crocodile-like creatures living within the River Maat.\nDuring the reign of King Azoun Obarskyr IV, a half-elven paladin of Oghma from Cormyr was dispatched on a mission to explore the planes of existence beyond Toril. The paladins name was Ambran the Seeker, and excerpts from his journal still survived to the Present Age. In volume 7, Ambran described how he hired a bariaur guide named Glin to take him from Sigil to the Outlands. Then Volume 9 told of his journey from Ribcage to Automata. Once there, he was able to witness the Modron Parade before continuing on to the River Maat, accompanied by both Glin and Rialiva, a member of the Doomguard."
