The River Lench, sometimes considered an eastern twin of the Sidewinder River and called by the same name, was a seldom-travelled river that served as the clearest boundary between Damara and Impiltur.
The Lench flowed gently, at least relative to other rivers in the region. As nothing was imported from upstream in the Dunwood, the river saw little traffic north of Lenchford. However, it served the vital strategic purpose of being a clear barrier separating Damara and Impiltur, acting as a highly defensible and obvious border between them.
The Lench began in the southern peaks of the Giantspire Mountains and made its way southwest through the Rawlinswood (later called the Dunwood). It then exited the forest to flow between Impultur on the southern bank and the Damaran Barony of Polten on the northern bank. It ran through the only major crossing point at Lenchford before joining the Great Imphras River just north of Bluefang Water.
During the Vaasan War in the mid&ndash14 century DR, Impiltur became increasingly concerned with the evil aspirations of Zhengyi the Witch-King, although not enough to aid their northern neighbors in the fight against him. With Damaras capitulation to the Witch-King in the , Impiltur mustered their armies and readied themselves for a war, but remained confident that the forces of Vaasa would not be able to invade across the Lench or the Sidewinder.
