        "mainbody": "The '''River Valashar''' was a river in [[Amn]],",
        "Geography": "The river started in the lower peaks of the [[Snowflake Mountains]] in the east of Amn, within the forest of [[Shilmista]]. The headwaters included three sets of waterfalls, as they poured over cliffs to end in a deep forest pool. From this pool the river continued to the west, leaving the forest and growing larger and faster. It became the mighty [[Amstel River]] near [[Trollford]],{{Amstel sources}}",
        "Description": "The Valashar was a wide river that was shallow and calm for up to 20 miles after leaving Shilmista. It picked up volume from springs along its course and deepened. By within 40 miles of Trollford its speed picked up before joining the Amstel River, which was uncrossable.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The pool near the headwaters of the River Valashar was said to be inhabited by [[nereid]]s."
