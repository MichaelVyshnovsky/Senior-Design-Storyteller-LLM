The River Tiryki (Pronounce|tee|REE|kee||refs= into the Bay of Chult near Port Nyanzaru. It was considered by many to be perhaps the most dangerous river in all of Chult.
The river was an extremely perilous route to travel by canoe or boat. Every few miles along its path it suddenly dropped down over a waterfall.
The jungles found on either banks of the river were infested by undead monsters and predatory jungle beasts.
The Grung settlement of Dungrunglung was found near the source of the River Tiryki.
