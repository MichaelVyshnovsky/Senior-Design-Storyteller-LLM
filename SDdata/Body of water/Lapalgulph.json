        "mainbody": "The Lapalgulph was a natural bay found on the Great Sea along the southern coast of the Chultan Peninsula in Tashalar in southwest Faer√ªn.\nThe Lapalgulph was a narrow elongated bay the reached northward into the mainland. Both of its sides were framed with mountains. The River Lapar flowed into the Lapalgulph, ending its trek from the Lapal Sea located further inland.\nThe brackish wasters of the Lapalgulph were closely watched by the yuan-ti of House Jennestas from the dense jungle on its western side. The yuan-ti bribed a monstrous dragon turtle that lived beneath the waters to guard the bay from below. The eastern edge of the Lapalgulphy transformed into a mangrove swamp filled with sword spiders."
