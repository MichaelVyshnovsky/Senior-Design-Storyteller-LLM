The River Specie was the westernmost river in Amn.
The river began in the Small Teeth
This short river was less than 50 miles long, but it was important as a source of gold. Despite being dangerously fast-flowing, it was visited by prospectors every year when the floodplains receded, who panned its waters for nuggets.
