The '''River Specie''' was the westernmost river in [[Amn]].

==Geography==
The river began in the [[Small Teeth]]

==Description==
This short river was less than 50 miles long, but it was important as a source of gold. Despite being dangerously fast-flowing, it was visited by prospectors every year when the floodplains receded, who panned its waters for nuggets.
