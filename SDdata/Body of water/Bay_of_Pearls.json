        "mainbody": "The '''Bay of Pearls''' was a large bay in the southern region of the [[Windrise Ports]] of [[Laerakond]]. The port city of [[Sambral]] was located there. The bay was shallow (often less than 100 feet) and was renowned for its pearl-making oysters.\n\nThe waters of the Bay of Pearls were crystal-like and full of fishes. According to locals, the name of the bay came either from the abundance of pearls found there or from its iridescent sand floor, whose gleaming minerals washed down from the [[Nightmare's Hoof]] and were visible from the surface."
