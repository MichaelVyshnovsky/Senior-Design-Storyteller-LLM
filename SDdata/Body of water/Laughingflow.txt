The '''Laughingflow''', also known as the '''Trollflow''' in [[Nesmé]], was a river located in the [[Evermoors]] in [[northwest Faerûn]]. The name 'Laughingflow' was a rough translation of the original [[Elven language|Elven]] name, which had it self been lost over time.

==Geography==
Emerging from a lake somewhere{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Claugiyliamatar, "Old Gnawbone"}} within the Evermoors, it flowed west and joined the Surbrin at [[Mornbryn's Shield]]. The Laughingflow drained the southern moors, and the land on the other side was relatively barren, in stark contrast to its name.

==Description==
The clear, fast-flowing river had a gravel bottom and banks lined with [[felsul]], [[laspar]], and a few [[blueleaf]] trees. Its water was drinkable but had a sharp mineral tang.

==Inhabitants==
The river was home to many edible [[crab]]s, a few [[shalass]], many schools of the small brown [[lout]], and also slimy but edible black-and-green [[rock eel]]s that inhabited the river bottom.

The Laughingflow was seen as unsafe, for [[troll]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[barbarian]]s would lay in wait nearby to ambush travelers on the river.

The ancient [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]], known as Old Gnawbone, sometimes drank from the lake that fed the Laughingflow.

==Notable Locations==
The [[Riders of Nesmé]] constructed several palisades, earthworks, and base camps along the Laughingflow.

To the south, the town of [[Yartar]] stood at the confluence of the Surbrin and [[River Dessarin|Dessarin rivers]]. Its people fished the Surbrin, Dessarin, and Laughingflow, which they called "the Three Rivers".<ref><ref><ref><ref>
