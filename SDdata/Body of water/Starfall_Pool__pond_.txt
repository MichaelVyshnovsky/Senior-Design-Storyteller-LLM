'''Starfall Pool''' was a small pond located in the [[Moonwood]] of [[north Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. It got its name from the many stars that could be seen reflected in its mirror-like surface on a clear, quiet night. It was made famous throughout [[Luruar]] by the [[Starfall Pool (ballad)|"Ballad of Starfall Pool"]].

==Geography==
Starfall Pool was almost due north from the [[Hunter's Gate]] of [[Silverymoon]] about 50 miles (80 kilometers). Upon reaching the edge of the forest, it was about another mile (1.6 km) into the trees.

==Description==
[[File:StarfallPool-Map.png|thumb|right|250px|''Map showing approximate location. Click to enlarge.'']]
This small pond had a bed of solid stone that could be clearly seen through the crystal waters. The cool water was slightly acidic, but potable, and supported a colony of [[frog]]s along its moss-covered banks. The [[Starfall Pool|glade where the pond formed]] was home to an [[illusion]] of a wandering [[shield]] that sometimes passed over the water.

There was a ''[[portal]]'' in the pool that could be activated by uttering certain words while submerged beneath the surface. When queried about the destination of this ''portal'', [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]], the [[Sage of Shadowdale]], said only "more than one [[dragon]] waits at the other end", and admonished any would-be explorers to put all their worldly affairs in order before they stepped into the Pool.{{Cite dragon/296/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Starfall Pool|75}}
