The '''Immer Stream''' was a small stream located in the town of [[Immersea]] in [[Cormyr]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|4300 Immersea}}

==Geography==
The stream originated from [[Spring Hill]] on the southwest side of Immersea at a small waterfall called [[Sel√ªne's Stairs]]. The stream flowed due east along the south side of Immersea, eventually connecting with the [[Wyvernwater]]. It crossed [[Calantar's Way]] along its way.
