The '''Nogaro River''' was a mighty waterway found in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] in [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The Nogaro River originated in the far southern reaches of the [[Haunted Lands]]. It flowed south for over a thousand miles through thick jungles in the heart of the dead kingdom of [[Nog]], emptying into the [[Foreigners' Sea]] in an area called the [[The Gateway (Zakhara)|Gateway]].

The river flooded each summer with the onset of heavy monsoons strong enough to wash an entire city away overnight.

==History==
The [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] inhabitants of the surrounding jungles would wash newborn babies in the waters of the Nogaro during their naming ceremony. The dead were placed on small rafts to be carried downstream, entrusted to [[Shajar]]'s care in the watery underworld.
