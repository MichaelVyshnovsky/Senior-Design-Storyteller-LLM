        "mainbody": "Lake Akax, also known as the Ghostmere, was a lake found in the borderlands between Akanûl and Chessenta during the 15 century DR.\nLake Akax was a deep, hypersaline lake, and its waters were home to strange elemental oozes that could mimic the forms of those who drowned in the lake. For this reason the lake was feared by most people. During winters, the borders of Lake Akax became a solidified, caustic sludge that could dissolve flesh and bone.\nThe lake had a long and misshapen form that stretched from the dry interior uplands of western Chessenta and Akanûl down to the former mouth of the Akax River at the ruins of Soorenar. The River Akax continued to flow down from the lake across the expansive Adder Swamp until it flowed into the diminished Bay of Chessenta. The settlements of Thurik and Jeblant were found on its northern shores, while the south and east merged into the Adder Swamp.\nThe lake was formed from the remnants of the River Akax and the Akanamere, which were heavily altered by the ravages of the Spellplague in 1385 DR. While the Akanamere shrank to Stoneshield Lake and Lake Fand and its flow redirected into the Adder River via the Belur River, the River Akax was cut off and largely swallowed by the vastly expanded Adder Swamp, forming Lake Akax."
