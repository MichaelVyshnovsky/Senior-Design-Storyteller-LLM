        "mainbody": "The '''Lake of Steam''', also known as the '''Arnaden''', was an inland sea connected to the [[Shining Sea]].",
        "Geography": "With the [[Shaar]] on the east, it separated the [[Shining South]] from the rest of [[Faer√ªn]]. On its shores was a collection of free cities, mainly on the northern and western sides. The southern side, by contrast, was a collection of kingdoms collectively named the [[Border Kingdoms]]. At the center of the lake was the [[Arnrock]]. The mountains around the area were one of the only places that the rare substance, [[zardazil]], could be found.",
        "History": "As of [[1479 DR]], the Lake of Steam was about half the size it was before the [[Spellplague]]. The Arnrock was in the eastern half of the sea rather than the center, and the eastern portion of the sea ended about thirty miles short of the town of [[Derlusk]], where Derlusk was once on the southeastern coast of the sea. A large lake was separated from the main body of the sea and lay near the ruins of [[Innarlith]]. The [[Qurth Forest]] was a small fraction of its former size, and the [[Duskwood]] was completely gone. [[Suldolphor]] was also in ruins.",
