The '''Arundi River''' was an important waterway found in the northeast region of the [[Hordelands]] known as the [[Plain of Horses]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste}}

==Geography==
The Arundi River originated within the southwestern expanse of the [[Quoya Desert]]. It flowed northeast through the desert for hundreds of miles before turning northwest to pass the plains before reaching [[Yal Tengri]] near the [[Iceroot Forest]].
