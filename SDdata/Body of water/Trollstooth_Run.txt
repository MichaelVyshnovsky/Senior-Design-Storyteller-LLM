'''Trollstooth Run''' was one of the watercourses of the [[Esmelflow]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
This stream was named for the large amount of teeth and bones from [[troll]]s and other creatures that are found within its waters, resulting from many battles that took place in the area. These sharp teeth and bones make the stream dangerous for wading in without footwear.

==Geography==
This creek began in the [[Qadim Hills]] and served as the eastern branch of upper river [[Khalleshyr]].
