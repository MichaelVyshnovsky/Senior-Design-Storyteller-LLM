Even the main source for this article, the City of Splendors Web Enhancement, calls it \"Gauster Creek\" in the map key. was a long, swift-flowing stream in the Dessarin Valley and a tributary of the River Dessarin.\nGaustars Creek began somewhere between the Sumber Hills and the High Forest. It meandered generally southwest, eventually cutting a deep gorge in the relatively soft bedrock as it passed by the Forlorn Hills. It was crossed by the Iron Road and emptied into the Dessarin not far from Goldenfields.Using the corrected map from Mike Schleys web site, it states 1 hex = 4 miles, and the stream covers about 15 hexes.\nThe stream was named after Gaustar Jadehammer, a dwarven clan chief that led his people south as they fled from orcs. It was said that he buried the clans wealth—a large chest of gems—somewhere on the banks of this creek in the Year of the Sunset Winds, 1309 DR, before the last member of Clan Jadehammer fell. As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, no such chest had been found.\nVarious creatures made their homes by digging out small caves or tunnels in the walls of the gorge eroded by Gaustars Creek. A large colony of stirges were known to prowl the area for as long as anyone could remember."
