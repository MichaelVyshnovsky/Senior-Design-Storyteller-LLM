Even the main source for this article, the ''City of Splendors'' Web Enhancement, calls it \"Gauster Creek\" in the map key. was a long, swift-flowing stream in the [[Dessarin Valley]] and a tributary of the [[River Dessarin]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|9}}{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}}",
        "Geography": "Gaustar's Creek began somewhere between the [[Sumber Hills]] and the [[High Forest]]. It meandered generally southwest, eventually cutting a deep gorge in the relatively soft bedrock as it passed by the [[Forlorn Hills]]. It was crossed by the [[Iron Road]] and emptied into the Dessarin not far from [[Goldenfields]].Using the corrected map from Mike Schley's web site, it states 1 hex = 4 miles, and the stream covers about 15 hexes.",
        "History": "The stream was named after [[Gaustar Jadehammer]], a [[dwarven]] clan chief that led his people south as they fled from [[orcs]]. It was said that he buried the clan's wealth—a large chest of [[gem]]s—somewhere on the banks of this creek in the [[1309 DR|Year of the Sunset Winds, 1309 DR]], before the last member of Clan Jadehammer fell. As of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], no such chest had been found.",
        "Inhabitants": "Various creatures made their homes by digging out small caves or tunnels in the walls of the gorge eroded by Gaustar's Creek. A large colony of [[stirge]]s were known to prowl the area for as long as anyone could remember."
