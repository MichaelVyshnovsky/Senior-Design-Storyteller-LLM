A network of shallow streams linked the Nakalpgotak Sea with the Lugalpgotak Sea. With a shape similar to a bowl, the Nakalpgotak Sea was  long with steep shores, some with a sheer 45Â° angle. The center of the sea had a depth of .\nThe majority of the Nakalpgotak Sea was filled with thick pack ice and a large portion of the shore had massive walls of barrier ice, with an average height of . Floating within the sea were icebergs, some as long as  and as tall as mountains. During the warmer months of the year, meltwater from the mountains rushed into the sea, causing the water level to rise significantly.\nDue to the low population of humans, the lake was home to a thriving population of polar bears and winter wolves. These predators fed on the large populations of fish, birds, and seals that lived within the sea.\nIn the summer of , an unseasonal heat wave caused a massive flood, inundating dozens of Iulutiun villages that were located near the eastern and northern shores. As a result, thereafter few Iulutiuns would settle near the sea."
