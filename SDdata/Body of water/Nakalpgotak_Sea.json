        "mainbody": "The '''Nakalpgotak Sea''' was a large sea in the [[Alpuk]] region of the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Geography": "The Nakalpgotak Sea was a massive inland sea bordered to the north by the mountains of [[Nakvaligach]] and the east by the [[Keryjek Ridge]]. A network of shallow streams linked the Nakalpgotak Sea with the [[Lugalpgotak Sea]]. With a shape similar to a bowl, the Nakalpgotak Sea was {{SI|120|mi|k|long=yes}} long with steep shores, some with a sheer 45Â° angle. The center of the sea had a depth of {{SI|700|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nThe majority of the Nakalpgotak Sea was filled with thick pack ice and a large portion of the shore had massive walls of barrier ice, with an average height of {{SIrange|100|200|ft|long=yes}}. Floating within the sea were icebergs, some as long as {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} and as tall as mountains. During the warmer months of the year, meltwater from the mountains rushed into the sea, causing the water level to rise significantly.",
        "Flora & Fauna": "Due to the low population of [[human]]s, the lake was home to a thriving population of [[polar bear]]s and [[winter wolves]]. These predators fed on the large populations of fish, birds, and [[seal]]s that lived within the sea.",
        "History": "In the summer of {{Yearlink|-760}}, an unseasonal heat wave caused a massive flood, inundating dozens of [[Iulutiun]] villages that were located near the eastern and northern shores. As a result, thereafter few Iulutiuns would settle near the sea."
