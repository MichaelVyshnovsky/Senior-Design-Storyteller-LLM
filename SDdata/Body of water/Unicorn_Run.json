        "mainbody": "The Unicorn Run was a river that started somewhere in the Star Mounts in the High Forest and joined the River Delimbiyr near Secomber.\nAccording to legends, each of the natural races emerged from Chaunteas womb at the Unicorn Runs source, and traveled down it to the outside world. Whether or not this was true is unclear. To elves, korreds, and halflings, the Unicorn Run was sacred to life and a site of purity. All three races placed taboos on extended trips up the river out of fear that if the river was fouled, no new races would ever be born on Toril again."
