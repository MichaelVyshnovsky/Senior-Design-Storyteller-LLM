        "Geography": "Lake Mulsantir was connected to [[Lake Ashane]] via the wide [[River Mulsantir]]; together the two lakes made up the western and southern borders of Rashemen. Lake Mulsantir was surrounded by Rashemen to the north and Thay to the south. The lakes were located in deep rifts between the high plateaus of [[Ashanath]], Thay, and the [[North Country]]. through which the [[River Gauros]] flowed. \n\nThree rivers drained into the lake from the south: [[River Sur]], [[River Thay]], and River Gauros.",
        "Description": "Lake Mulsantir was a freshwater lake.\n\nThe lake was inhabited by crossbreeds created by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], but these monsters tended to stick to the southern shores. Rashemi ''[[witchboat]]s'' piloted by [[hathran]]s patrolled the lake.",
        "History": "Thay used to attempt to invade Rashemen by controlling and crossing the lake, even creating monstrous crossbreeds in an attempt to inconvenience the Rashemen, but they gave up after failing too many times. However, in [[1370 DR]], Thay once again attempted to sail the Lake Mulsantir in an invasion attempt but were turned back my magical storms created by hathrans.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], the Red Wizards captured a [[dragon turtle]] in [[Lake Thaylambar]] and planned to set it loose under their control into the lake.",
        "Locations on Lake Mulsantir": "* [[Surthay]], a city on its southern shore in Thay.\n* [[Mulsantir]], a city on the northern shore in Rashemen.\n* [[Tezir]], a settlement on the western shore in Thesk.\n* [[Surmarsh]], a marsh along the southwestern shore, between the River Sur and River Thay."
