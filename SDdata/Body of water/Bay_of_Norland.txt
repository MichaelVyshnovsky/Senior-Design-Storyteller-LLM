The Bay of Norland was a prominent bay located on the island of Norland within the Moonshae Isles.
The bay was located near central Norlands eastern shore on with the Sea of Moonshae just northwest of the North Cape.
Reef formations sat at both the north and south ends of the bay, creating a safe passage in the middle for ships while also helping to protect the bay from storms.
