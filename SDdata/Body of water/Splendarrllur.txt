The river Splendarrllur (also known as the Shining River by the shield dwarves) was one of the three greatest rivers of Amn.
The Splendarrllur had cold and swift water, but it was still an important route for the barge traffic from the northeast to Lake Esmel. The river was crossed by an ancient dwarven bridge, the Axe Bridge.
The river was part of the Esmelflow and began somewhere in the northeast of Amn. It was fed by the Vudlur and emptied into Lake Esmel, The Gem Road came close to its waters.
The ancient, mythal-hidden elven city of Myth Lharast was thought to be located five miles west of the Gem Road at the point where the Splendarrllur made its westernmost bend.
