The river '''Splendarrllur''' (also known as the '''Shining River''' by the [[Shield dwarf|shield dwarves]]) was one of the three greatest rivers of [[Amn]].

==Description==
The Splendarrllur had cold and swift water, but it was still an important route for the barge traffic from the northeast to [[Lake Esmel]]. The river was crossed by an ancient dwarven bridge, the [[Axe Bridge]].{{Axe-Star Bridge confusion}}

==Geography==
The river was part of the [[Esmelflow]] and began somewhere in the northeast of Amn. It was fed by the [[Vudlur]] and emptied into Lake Esmel, The [[Gem Road]] came close to its waters.

==Rumors & Legends==
The ancient, [[mythal]]-hidden [[Elf|elven]] city of [[Myth Lharast]] was thought to be located five miles west of the Gem Road at the point where the Splendarrllur made its westernmost bend.
