The '''Clear Whirl River''' was the major river of the kingdom of [[Hartsvale]].

==Description==
The river was cold and often full of ice. On an island in the middle of the river was located [[Castle Hartwick]], from which the monarch of Hartsvale ruled.

==Geography==
The river began in two separate forks in the hills between the [[Ice Mountains]] and the [[Ice Spires]]. The eastern fork started at [[Lake Woe]].[[Lake Woe]] is not labelled on any map, but its description in ''[[Giantcraft]]'', p. 113, places it south of the [[Ice Spires|Ice Spires South]], and only one lake on the maps fits that description. Once the forks came together, the river flowed north through Hartsvale. [[Wyrm River]] was one of its tributaries.
