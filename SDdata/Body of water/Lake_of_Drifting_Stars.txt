The '''Lake of Drifting Stars''' was a freshwater lake that laid to the north of the town of [[Gildenglade]] in [[Turmish]].

==Description==
The Lake of Drifting Stars was a popular rendezvous spot for lovers who sought a romantic encounter during the [[Feast of the Moon]], or the [[Festival of Lovers]], a grand revelry for the inhabitants of Turmish. Its shores were grass-covered hills that overlooked the calm lake. The shores of the lake became commonly patrolled after the [[Time of Troubles]] and the increased activities of the dreaded [[Cult of Malar]].
