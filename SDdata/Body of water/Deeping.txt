The '''Deeping''' was a stream in the [[Cormanthor|Cormanthor forest]].

==Wildlife==
The waters of the Deeping ran clear and was home to a large number of [[wikipedia:bass (fish)|bass]] and [[wikipedia:catfish|catfish]]. In the western section of the Deeping, [[Deeping shrimp]] spawned and were fished by [[halfling]]s who used special trawling nets of tightly woven mesh combined with wooden boards that floated on the surface.
