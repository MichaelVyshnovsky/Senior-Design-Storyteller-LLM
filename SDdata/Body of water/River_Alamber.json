        "mainbody": "The '''River Alamber''' was a long and swift river found in the [[Greenfields (Old Empires)|Greenfields]] in southern [[Unther]] and, after the [[Spellplague]], in central [[Tymanther]].",
        "Geography": "The River Alamber was formed by a network of streams on the northern [[Unthangol Mountains]] that flowed east across the Greenfields before draining into the [[Alamber Sea]]. Its waters provided sediment for the fertile lands of the Greenfields, but the river was unpredictable in its floods, much like the [[River Angol]].",
        "History": "At least twice in recorded history, in [[108 DR]] and in [[731 DR]], the city of [[Unthalass]] was flooded by the waters of the River Alamber.\n\nDuring the Spellplague, because of the violent exchange of lands between the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], the River Alamber got divided into two sections because of the creation of the [[Ash Lake]]. Another lake, [[Lance Lake]], was also created during this cataclysm near the origin of the river, in the Unthangol Mountains.\n\nIn [[1487 DR]], during the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]], the navy of Unther used the waters of the river to lay siege to the Tymantheran port city of [[Djerad Kethendi]]. The siege was lifted when [[Nanna-Sin]] took the form of a [[dragon turtle]] and destroyed the Untheran navy. A second naval battle took place in [[1489 DR]], with a similar result, as the Untherans were unable to defeat the dragon turtle.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Ash Lake]]\n* [[Djerad Kethendi]]\n* [[Firetrees]]\n* [[Lance Lake]]\n* [[Unthalass]]",
        "Trivia": "[[Dragonborn]] from Tymanther called the River Alamber \"''Kuhri Ternhesh''\", what means \"the River of Stone\" in [[Tymantheran (dialect)|Tymantheran]] [[Draconic language|draconic]]."
