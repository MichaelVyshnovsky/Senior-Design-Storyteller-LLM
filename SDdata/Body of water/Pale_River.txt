The Pale River was an elemental vortex connecting two elemental planes.
The Pale River originated in the Great Dismal Delve on the Elemental Plane of Earth, flowing to the marid oyster beds in a particularly filthy area of the Elemental Plane of Water.
The Pale River connected the two elemental planes, permitting travel between them in both directions, but few used this elemental vortex for travel.
