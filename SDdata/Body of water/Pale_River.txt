The '''Pale River''' was an [[elemental vortices|elemental vortex]] connecting two [[elemental plane]]s.

==Location==
The Pale River originated in the [[Great Dismal Delve]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], flowing to the [[marid]] oyster beds in a particularly filthy area of the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].

The Pale River connected the two elemental planes, permitting travel between them in both directions, but few used this elemental vortex for travel.
