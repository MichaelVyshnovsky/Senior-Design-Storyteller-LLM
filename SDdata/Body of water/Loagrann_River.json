        "mainbody": "The Loagrann River was formed by the joining of three tributariesâ€”two of which were named Skull Creek and Whitewater&mdashflowing from the northern part of the Greypeak Mountains. Flowing southwest it joined the Greyflow river about halfway between Llorkh and the junction of the Greyflow and the Delimbiyr rivers.\n* Deadstone Cleft This deep canyon, through which the Loagrann flowed, housed a cave-complex inhabited by a clan of stone giants."
