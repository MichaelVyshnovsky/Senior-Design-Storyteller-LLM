The Great Reflecting Pool was part of the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Accessible only from the Public Gardens, the reflecting pool was believed to have mystical properties. If visited on a crystal clear day, a visitor with a precise question might see the answer within the waters of the pool. Some even believed that the water reflected the nature of a person soul.
Though the reflecting pool did indeed posses magical qualities, the soul reflection was actually an elaborate prank set in place by Ambassador Jiraad. Jiraad placed spells at popular viewing locations around the pool, showing different images to viewers at random intervals.
The pool was maintained and guarded by a pair of marid who lived under the water.
