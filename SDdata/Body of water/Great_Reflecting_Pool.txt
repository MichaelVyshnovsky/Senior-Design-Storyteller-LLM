The '''Great Reflecting Pool''' was part of the complex of the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Rumors and Legends==
Accessible only from the [[Public Gardens of Huzuz|Public Gardens]], the reflecting pool was believed to have mystical properties. If visited on a crystal clear day, a visitor with a precise question might see the answer within the waters of the pool. Some even believed that the water reflected the nature of a person' soul.

Though the reflecting pool did indeed posses magical qualities, the soul reflection was actually an elaborate prank set in place by Ambassador [[Jiraad]]. Jiraad placed spells at popular viewing locations around the pool, showing different images to viewers at random intervals.

==Inhabitants==
The pool was maintained and guarded by a pair of [[marid]] who lived under the water.
