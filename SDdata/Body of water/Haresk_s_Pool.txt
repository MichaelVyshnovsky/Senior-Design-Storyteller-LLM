'''Heresk's pool''' was a placid fishing pond nearby to the [[High Councilor's House]] in the city of [[Ashabenford]] within [[Mistledale]]. It was populated by a number of fish that would harmlessly nibble at the toes of anyone who decided to leap in for a swim.

During [[Haresk Malorn]]'s tenure as [[High Councilor]], his wife [[Imbrautha Malorn|Imbrautha]] and children could be found taking a swim in the pond to cool off during hot days.

==Rumors==
There were legends that the muddy depths of the pond contained chests of [[gold]] coins and jewelry, the hidden cache of treasure from some long-past bandit captain. By the 1360s [[DR]], the bottom of the pool had been dragged four times in search of these riches, but nothing was ever found.
