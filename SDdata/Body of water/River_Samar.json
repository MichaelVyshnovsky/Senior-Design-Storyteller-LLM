        "mainbody": "The River Samar was the only major river within the kingdom of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.\nThe river originated in the Sanrach Mountains in northern Samarach from several smaller creeks near the town of Taruin. It flowed south for approximately  before emptying into the Great Sea at the Bay of Omgar. The River Samar was an important landmark in Samarach in that it blocked the dense Samarlogh for encroaching on the eastern region of the kingdom. The capital of Samargol, as well as several smaller towns, were founded along its banks.\nSmall farming hamlets lined the banks of the river. Massive dwarven nets blocked the mouth of the river to keep any yuan-ti or other serpent folk from traversing its waters. Smaller nets that could be raised and lowered at various checkpoints were found along the inner stretch of the river.\n* Samargol\n* Taruin"
