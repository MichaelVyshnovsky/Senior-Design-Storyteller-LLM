        "Description": "Fed by glaciers in the [[Katakoro Shan]] and [[A-Ling Shan]] mountain ranges, the Muren Tso river flowed across the [[Katakoro Plateau]] until it reached the [[Nor Yudol]] lake, continuing on as the [[Muren Khi]].\n\nThe water of the river was clear and looked fresh, yet minerals from the mountains made the water bitter and mildly poisonous. Those who drank the water suffered from stomach cramps, nausea, and muscle pain.\n\nThe nomads of the steppe were known to \"forget\" to tell travelers of the river's properties."
