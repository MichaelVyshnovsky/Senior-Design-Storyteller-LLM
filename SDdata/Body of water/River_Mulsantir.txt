The '''River Mulsantir''' was a prominent river found between [[Rashemen]] and [[Thay]] in the [[Unapproachable East]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Geography==
The northern section of the River Mulsantir flowed north into [[Lake Ashane]]
while the southern section flowed west from the [[Sunrise Mountains]] to form [[Lake Mulsantir]] in southern Rashemen. The river formed part of the border between Rashemen and Thay as it passed through the [[Gorge of Gauros]].

==Description==
The neck of the river found between Lake Ashane and Lake Mulsantir was considerably wider when compared to the section of the river that flowed south from Lake Mulsantir.

==Notable Locations==
[[Mulsantir]] was located along the river's north shore where it flowed out of Lake Ashane and into Mulsantir Lake.
