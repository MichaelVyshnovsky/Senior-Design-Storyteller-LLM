Razacks Tears was a long stream located in the western region of the Ride on the Moonsea North.
The stream flowed north from the Dragonspines, wound across the Ride before turning northeast and joining with Telstang Brook.
The Verdigris Trail intersected the stream at a bridge crossing just north of Verdigris.
According to legend, Razack was a titan lord that used his great axe to cut a scar into the face of Toril itself.
