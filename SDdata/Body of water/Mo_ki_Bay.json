        "mainbody": "oki Bay or moKi Bay was a bay in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.Text sources in Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms render the name as \"moKi\", while maps in the book and in The Forgotten Realms Atlas render it as \"Moki\". The latter name is used in this article for ease of writing.\nMoki Bay lay on the eastern coast, facing the Straits of Koryo. The settlement of Moki lay on the north side.Moki Bay is not marked on maps, but it may be inferred to be the bay south of Moki on maps.\nAround 1357 DR, Moki Bay was dominated by the pirate Crow Dz Pong, who was known as \"the wu jen of moKi Bay\". He terrorized sailors and coastal settlements from Pyong Do to the Ziyero Ridge, such as Moki. He was theorized to have a hidden fortress somewhere south of Moki Bay, concealed with magic and full of his loot."
