        "mainbody": "The Alaphaer Run was a fast-flowing, supernaturally cold river that found in the Moonsea North region of North Faer√ªn. \nFor much of its length, the river was iced over extensively enough to support a heavily laden sledge, or even a landing dragon.\nAt least some of its unnatural cold came from blessings bestowed on the waters by the goddess Auril, \"Alaphaer\" being one of her older names. The river was known to run in and out of Aurils extraplanar Deep Wilds realm several times as it descended from the Mammothbacks of the northern Abbey Mountains and headed for the Frozen Forest.\nThe river arose and flowed north out of the western Abbey Mountains into the Frozen Forest, flowing almost right to the step pyramid known as the Monument of the Ancients before dispersing."
