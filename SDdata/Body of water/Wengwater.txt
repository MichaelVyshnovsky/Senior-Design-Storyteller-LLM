The '''Wengwater''' was a tributary of [[Lake Weng]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The river was fast and had dangerous rapids. Each year, it flooded, which left small ponds north of the town of [[Amnwater]].

==Geography==
The Wengwater began in the [[Cloud Peaks]] and flowed past Amnwater until it poured into Lake Weng from the east.

==History==
Every few years, someone tried to run the rapids of the Wengwater in a feat of daring, but as of [[1370 DR]], no one in 300 years had successfully navigated them.
