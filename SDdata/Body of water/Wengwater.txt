The Wengwater was a tributary of Lake Weng in Amn.
The river was fast and had dangerous rapids. Each year, it flooded, which left small ponds north of the town of Amnwater.
The Wengwater began in the Cloud Peaks and flowed past Amnwater until it poured into Lake Weng from the east.
Every few years, someone tried to run the rapids of the Wengwater in a feat of daring, but as of 1370 DR, no one in 300 years had successfully navigated them.
