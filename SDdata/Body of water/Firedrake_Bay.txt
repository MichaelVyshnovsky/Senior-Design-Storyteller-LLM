'''Firedrake Bay''' was the bay located between the [[Tethyr Peninsula]] and the [[Starspire Peninsula]], with its shores being the region known as the [[Firedrake Shores]]. [[Port Kir]] was located at its southeastern corner.

==Geography==
The bay was relatively safe from storms and had calm waters. This was with the notable exception of the [[Gullet]], a treacherous straight between who craggy isles known as the [[Tusks]] which marked the end of the bay and the beginning of the [[Race]].

==Flora & Fauna==
The waters of the bay contained a wide variety of shellfish&mdash;clams, lobsters, and [[shrimp]]. A particular kind of lobster, the [[star lobster]], was only found in this bay, in the region of Port Kir.

==Rumors & Legends ==
The ''[[Amulet of Ioma]]'', a magical item once worn by the first [[Black Alaric]], was believed to have been at the bottom of the bay.
