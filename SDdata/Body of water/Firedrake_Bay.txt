Firedrake Bay was the bay located between the Tethyr Peninsula and the Starspire Peninsula, with its shores being the region known as the Firedrake Shores. Port Kir was located at its southeastern corner.
The bay was relatively safe from storms and had calm waters. This was with the notable exception of the Gullet, a treacherous straight between who craggy isles known as the Tusks which marked the end of the bay and the beginning of the Race.
The waters of the bay contained a wide variety of shellfish&mdashclams, lobsters, and shrimp. A particular kind of lobster, the star lobster, was only found in this bay, in the region of Port Kir.
The Amulet of Ioma, a magical item once worn by the first Black Alaric, was believed to have been at the bottom of the bay.
