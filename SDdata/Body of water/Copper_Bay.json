        "Description": "In the bay, the famous yellow hue of the Golden Water was diminished, and at sunset the water took on a coppery color, hence its name. It was a protected bay.",
        "Locations": "[[Orvyltar]], the capital city of [[Ulgarth]], lay at the far end of the bay.",
        "Politics": "Around the mid-to-late 14th century [[DR]], Copper Bay was Ulgarth's safest and biggest port, with its capital sitting on its shore. The majority of the kingdom's trade came through here, so commercial sea traffic in the area was dense. Almost two dozen warships and other defenses defended the bay and its ports."
