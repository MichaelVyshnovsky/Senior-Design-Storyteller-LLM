The '''Tun River''' was an expansive waterway that passed through western regions of [[Cormyr]] and the [[Dragon Coast]], in the [[Eastern Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]].{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}}

==Description==
Great storms coming down from the [[Storm Horns]] wracked the lands along the length of the Tun River, causing it to experience regular flooding.

==Geography==
The Tun River originated in the [[Farsea Marshes]], that along with the [[Tun Marshes]] later became the [[Farsea Swamp]], flowed south through the [[Tunlands]] before emptying into the [[Dragonmere]], at the formation of the [[Gritstone Moorland]]s.

===Geographical Features===
The valley around the Tun River was unsuitable for farmland and was regularly flooded when the water level rose.

===Flora & Fauna===
The waters of the Tun were known as the home to a variety of aquatic animals including [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, [[eel]]s, and even [[crocodile]]s.

[[Maxor]] plants could be found along banks of the river south of the Storm Horns, a fern-like plant from which the substance [[maxoris]] was derived.

==History==
At some point between the catastrophic [[Spellplague]] that in the {{yearlinkName|1384}} and the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the stretch of the Tun River between the Farsea Marshes and the Tun Marshes was swallowed up by the expansive Farsea Swamp that formed out of the two smaller wetlands.
