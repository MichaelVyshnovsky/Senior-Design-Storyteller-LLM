'''Igotak Sea''' was the largest lake in the [[Nakvaligach]] region of the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
The Igotak Sea was a large triangular-shaped lake that was covered in thick ice, up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} thick, for most of the year. The lake itself was {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} in depth at its deepest point. The lakes murky water was drinkable but it was particularly bitter. 

The lake was known for its ever-present fog. The thick fog covered the lake, rising several hundred feet. During the cold of winter, the fog rolled out and covered the entire area around the lake, to a distance of up to {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}.
