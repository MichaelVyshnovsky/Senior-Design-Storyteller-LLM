'''Mo'ki Bay''' or '''mo'Ki Bay''' was a bay in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].<ref group="note">Text sources in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' render the name as "mo'Ki", while maps in the book and in ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'' render it as "Mo'ki". The latter name is used in this article for ease of writing.

==Geography==
Mo'ki Bay lay on the eastern coast, facing the [[Straits of Koryo]]. The settlement of [[Mo'ki]] lay on the north side.<ref group="note">Mo'ki Bay is not marked on maps, but it may be inferred to be the bay south of Mo'ki on maps.

==History==
Around [[1357 DR]], Mo'ki Bay was dominated by the pirate [[Crow Dz Pong]], who was known as "the wu jen of mo'Ki Bay". He terrorized sailors and coastal settlements from [[Pyong Do]] to the [[Ziyero Ridge]], such as Mo'ki. He was theorized to have a hidden fortress somewhere south of Mo'ki Bay, concealed with magic and full of his loot.
