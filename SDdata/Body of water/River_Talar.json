        "mainbody": "The '''River Talar''' was a river in the [[Shaar]] and [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]].",
        "Geography": "The River Talar was fed by both the [[River Shaar|Shaar]] and [[River Channath|Channath]] rivers near [[Shaareach]] and drained thus much of the plains of the Shaar. From this joining, the Talar flowed along the southern fringe of the Shaar, where it rounded the [[Wyrmbones]], ran through the [[Misty Vale (forest)|Misty Vale]] and the [[Dun Hills (Lapaliiya)|Dun Hills]] and finally emptied into [[Talar Bay]] and the [[Shining Sea]].",
        "Description": "Hundreds of miles long, for most of its length, the Talar was wide and slow moving. However, in its last 10 miles (16 kilometers), it rushed through a high, narrow gorge, called the '''Cliffs of Talar'''. It was almost unnavigable between here and its mouth at Talar Bay.",
        "Inhabitants": "A tribe of [[merrow (ogre)|merrow]] and [[scrag]]s dwelled in the gorge, ranging out to hunt in the waters of Talar Bar. The armies of Lapaliiya had made regular but unsuccessful efforts to drive them out before [[1373 DR]].",
        "Locations": "The only bridge across the Talar was the [[Mouth of Istishia]] on the [[Lapal Way]].\n\nThe capital of Lapaliiya, [[Sheirtalar]], sat on its north bank in Talar Bay, while the city of [[Sheirlantar]] sat beside the river in the western Dun Hills."
