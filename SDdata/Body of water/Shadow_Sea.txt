The Shadow Sea was a body of water in Anauroch west of the Scimitar Spires.
The clear waters of the lake were said to have been particularly cool and crisp, and blanketed with menacing clouds of fog and storm clouds that continually rolled over its surface.
The Shadow Sea was surrounded on three sides by the Scimitar Spires mountain range.
In the age of ancient Netheril, an original body of water known as the Hidden Lake filled the space that later contained the Shadow Sea.
The Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants recounts that, in , Hidden Lake was crowned by a mountain that contained the first kobold nation, Darastrixhurthi. Beneath the mountain were the gems that contained the souls that Garl Glittergold would use to create the gnome race. When kobolds began heedlessly mining the gems, Garl collapsed their caverns, transforming the mountain into a lake.
* Thultanthar, when the City of Shade first returned from the Shadowfell it remained floating over the northern edge of the lake.
