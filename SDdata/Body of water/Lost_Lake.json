        "mainbody": "The Lost Lake was found in Cormyr near Wheloon along the Way of the Manticore.\nThough it appeared as a small valley in 1368 DR, the Lost Lake was in fact a lake during times past. A small stream was all that remained of the lake.\nA pair of mages engaged in a sorcerous duel at the site of the lake, eventually blasting a large opening through the rocks along the lakes southern end, allowing all of the water to escape. The mages were not fighting over gold or a rare magical artifact. Instead, they were dueling over the silver surlfish native to the lake.\n* Gladehap"
