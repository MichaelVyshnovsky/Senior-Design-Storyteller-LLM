        "mainbody": "he Ni-Ko Oasis, also known as Mud Pit Hollow, was traditionally considered the endpoint of the Golden Way and the beginning of the Spice Road as it stretched to the east. The oasis also served as the boundary between the continents of Kara-Tur and Faer√ªn.\nLocated in the Plain of Horses, the oasis was a boggy forest bordering on a swamp. The brown water was deep enough to graze the bottom of horse bellies.\nThe bog was inhabited by korobokuru who would occasionally trade or share stories with travelers."
