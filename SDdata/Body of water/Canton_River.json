        "History": "In the [[Mythallar Era]], [[orc]]s roamed the Rampant Peaks and the area around Xinlenal. The orc had sacked caravans and killed people of Ioulaum's enclave, and so the [[archwizard]] wished to discover the location of these [[orc]]s. After many years of tracking them down, his officials finally found that the orcs inhabited the knolls of the Canton River's headwaters. It was then that Ioulaum began his [[Excursion into Extinction]] campaign to slay every last orc, and his troops headed towards the source of the river.\n\nDuring the later part of the the 30{{th}} century [[NY]], parts of the waterway began to descend deep into the earth. After the fall of Netheril, the river had essentially disappeared."
