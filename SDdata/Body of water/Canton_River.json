        "mainbody": "he Canton River was a river located in southern central Netheril that ran below and parallel to the Rampant Peaks.\nThis river was described to be a \"deep waterway\" that was famed for its twelve gushing waterfalls.\nThe Canton River formed in the Rampant Peaks, and flowed eastward past Xinlenal. Once past the enclave, the river sharply turned north, where it deposited into the Snarefell Lake.\nThe waterway was inhabited by diamondeye trout.\nIn the Mythallar Era, orcs roamed the Rampant Peaks and the area around Xinlenal. The orc had sacked caravans and killed people of Ioulaums enclave, and so the archwizard wished to discover the location of these orcs. After many years of tracking them down, his officials finally found that the orcs inhabited the knolls of the Canton Rivers headwaters. It was then that Ioulaum began his Excursion into Extinction campaign to slay every last orc, and his troops headed towards the source of the river.\nDuring the later part of the the 30 century NY, parts of the waterway began to descend deep into the earth. After the fall of Netheril, the river had essentially disappeared."
