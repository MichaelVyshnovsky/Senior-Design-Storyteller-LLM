The '''Methmere''', which was also called '''Lake Meth''', was a lake found in the frontier between [[Chessenta]] and [[Unther]].

==Geography==
The Methmere was near the southwestern edge of the [[Riders to the Sky]]. It was long and narrow, was composed of freshwater and had a winding coastline.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|73}} The [[Winding River]] flowed into it, and the [[River of Metals]] flowed from the Methmere into the [[Alamber Sea]].

The Methmere had a few volcanoes under its waters. By the late years of the 15th century [[DR]], those volcanoes were active and the temperatures in the northern shore made the waters release clouds of steam that covered the peaks of the Riders to the Sky.

==Fauna==
The Methmere had a large population of salmon, trout, and bass. Its deeper waters were also populated by [[plesiosaurus|plesiosaurs]].

==Inhabitants==
Before the Spellplague of 1385 DR, the shores of the Methmere were inhabited by bandits and fishermen from both Unther and Chessenta, who lived in small and isolated settlements. There were at least twelve registered fishing vessels and bandits had trained a few plesiosaurs to raid the lake's waters.

However, after the Spellplague destroyed the Untheran region, the shores of the Methmere became home to a tribe of [[scrag]]s, who also trained the plesiosaurs as mounts and took control of the region by driving away the other inhabitants.
