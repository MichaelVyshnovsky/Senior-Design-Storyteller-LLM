The Amnurflow was a river in Amn that flowed into Lake Weng.
The river was the northernmost of the tributaries of Lake Weng. It began in the Cloud Peaks west of Citadel Amnur. Midway to Lake Weng, it was joined by the Rashturiver from the east. Comassur Creek merged with the Amnurflow five miles northeast of the lake.
This river was named after General Amnur, a legendary military man who was the younger brother of the second king of Amn.
