The '''Trackless Strait''' was a channel of the [[Trackless Sea]] that separated the islands of [[Moray]] and [[Norland]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|11}}

==Geography==
Approximately {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} of ocean within the Trackless Strait separated the two islands. The strait served as the western boundary between the [[Ffolk]] in the south and the [[Northlander]]s in the north. The strait connected the larger Trackless Sea with the [[Sea of Moonshae]].
