'''Kang Bay''' was a bay between the two branches of the [[Koryo Peninsula]] in [[Koryo]] in [[northeast Kara-Tur|northeast]] [[Kara-Tur]].

==Locations==
It held a number of islands, large and small, the greatest of which were [[Quelpart]] and [[Kanko]].

Anticlockwise around the bay lay the Koryoan settlements of [[Tu Pe]] and its floating city; [[Xi Hulang]] on the mouth of the [[Hoparatu River]], which flowed into the bay; [[Koje]]; [[Xai Chung]]; and [[Bejung]], closest to Kanko.

The bay bordered the [[Sea of Kozakura]].

==History==
In ancient times, when the Kanko volcano rose up out of Kang Bay and erupted, it was said that the very skies over Koryo caught fire. According to legend, the entire Han clan sought shelter in the vast [[Dang Caverns]].For simplicity, these eruptions of Kanko have been merged; the intent behind the sourcebook was likely that these were part of a single event. Nevertheless, it is possible that Kanko erupted multiple times.
