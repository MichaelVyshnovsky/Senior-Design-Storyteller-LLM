The '''Wyvernwater''' was a star-shaped freshwater lake more or less centrally positioned in [[Cormyr]].

It had abundant [[crab]], [[eel]], and [[fish]] stocks. Each morning, the lake was covered in a thick mist, and those who fished it early in the morning were therefore known as "mistfishers". The lake was fed by the [[Sword River (Cormyr)|Sword River]] to the northwest, the [[Immerflow]] to the northeast, and the [[Thunder River]] to the east, and it flowed into the [[Dragonmere]] to the south, via the [[Wyvernflow]].
