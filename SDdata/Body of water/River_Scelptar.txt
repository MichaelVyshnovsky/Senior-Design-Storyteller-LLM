The '''River Scelptar''' was a large river that flowed from the [[Qurth Forest]] in the northeast of the [[Border Kingdoms]] to the [[Shining Sea]] in the southwest. The mouth of the river was called simply '''Scelptarmouth'''.

==Geography==
The River Scelptar spanned a distance of approximately {{SI|300|mile|long=yes}}. The [[River Rith]] was a tributary from the north, connecting about {{SI|100|mile|long=yes}} inland.{{Cite web|url=http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/archfr/frbk|title=The Border Kingdoms Archive|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|accessdate=2008-04-25}}

Seasonal flooding occurred in the river every spring.{{Cite polyhedron/138/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}}
===Flora & Fauna===
In the marshy depths of Scelptar north of Dapplegate, a great deal of [[lizardfolk]] and [[mudmaw]]s inhabited the river. The two groups regularly fought each other for supremacy over the water. Additionally, [[Oeble|Oeblaun]] fishermen often told stories of freshwater [[Pike (fish)|pikes]] and [[eel]]s dwelling in the Scelptar's waters, ones large enough to swallow a [[human]] whole, but these were likely nothing but talltales.

==Settlements on the River==
* [[Blackbarn]], a small market town on the southern banks of the River Sceptar, just north of [[The Land of Two Princes]].{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms/Blackbarn}}
* [[Dapplegate]], a large town that stood on the southern banks of the River Sceptar, close to Scelptarmouth.
* [[Oeble]], a city that grew around a spot on the River Scelptar known as the [[Great Ford]].{{Cite polyhedron/138/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|16}} Due to the seasonal flooding these bridges be destroyed and swept away each spring, requiring them to be rebuilt in the summer.

==Trade==
A lot of goods traveled through the River Scelptar by means of barges and small ships, numbering among the primary sea routes of the Shining Sea. Due to dangers in its marshy areas, six [[mercenary]] companies stationed in Dapplegate were dedicated to escorting bargebound shipments.
