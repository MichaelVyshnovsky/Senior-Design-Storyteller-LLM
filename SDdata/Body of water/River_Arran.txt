The '''River Arran''' was a river system found in [[Chondath]] and [[Sespech]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}<ref name=EotSS.M">

==Geography==
The beginning tributaries of the river originated in the [[Chondalwood]] in southern Chondath. The tributaries joined together near [[Elbulder]] and continued to flow northwest for approximately {{SI|300|mi|k|long=yes}} before emptying into the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The river flowed past the [[Golden Plains]] and formed some of the border between Sespech and Chondath.<ref name=EotSS.M"/>

==Notable Locations==
[[Fort Arran]] was located on the western bank of the River Arran near the Vilhon Reach. The river was crossed by both the [[Golden Road]] and the [[Old Road (Vilhon Reach)|Old Road]].<ref name=EotSS.M"/>
