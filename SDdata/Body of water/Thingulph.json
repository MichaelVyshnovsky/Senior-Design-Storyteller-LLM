        "mainbody": "he Thingulph was a part of the Guthland in southern Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.\nThe Thingulph was the wide \"mouth\" of the large bay that dominated the center of Thindol. Several towns were located along its shores.\nThe waters of the Thingulph were made treacherous by surging waters expelled from the vast subterranean waterway known as Labrands Folly which was connected to the gulph.\nThe Thingulphs shallow waters held an abundance of sea life. Yuan-ti members of House Sseradess laired beneath the waters of the western Thingulph approximately  south of Thindar within a coral fortress called Khassinsara. Kuo-toa raiders from Gathgoolgapool used the tunnels of Labrands Folly to enter the Thingulph and attack small coastal settlements or small sailing vessels.\n* Aztul\n* Deltar\n* Khassinsara"
