        "mainbody": "The River Soshenstar was one of the three great rivers of Chult.\nTravelers often used the river to access the interior of the jungle by canoe. It poured over a waterfall about every ten or fifteen miles on its journey to the sea.\nThe river was in the north-central region of the jungle and flowed from the Aldani Basin into the Bay of Chult.\nThe waters of the river were home to crocodiles and a wide range of fish, notably kapenta, giant tigerfish, and several species of electric catfish.\nThe banks of the river were home to boars, dinosaurs, giant scorpions, panthers, and saber-toothed tigers, and were known to be a place where ryath root could be collected.\nThe aldani lived in this river, and dragon turtles were also common near its mouth.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, a battle-scarred giant crocodile had taken up residence inside of a wrecked boat not far south of the rivers mouth.\nThe town of Port Nyanzaru was located at the Soshenstars mouth. At the end of the 15 century DR, the Order of the Gauntlet had established Camp Vengeance on its waters, a few miles north of the Aldani Basin."
