The '''Burning Pool of Natifa''' was a small wonderous body of water located in [[west Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Geography==
The Burning Pool of Natifa was located near a cluster of crescent-shaped ''barchan'' dunes west of the [[Mountains of Forgotten Dreams]].

==Description==
The pool measured {{SI|40|ft}} wide and was {{SI|20|ft}}. The water of the pool had a sweet smell of lemons and roses. Spindly plants called ''[[arafaj]]'' covered the entire surface of the pool, burning continuously and illuminating the entire pool with a magical glow that could be seen {{SI|10|mi|k}} away. These plants burned whenever they were in contact with the pool's surface; even rain did not extinguish them.

Periodically, a fountain would shoot water {{SI|20|ft}}) into the air. 

A stone oven could be found near the southern end of the pool, complete with pots and other accessories. 

==Inhabitants==
The pool took its name from [[Natifa]], a [[ghost]] who inhabited the pool.
