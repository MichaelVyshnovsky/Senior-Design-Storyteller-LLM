        "mainbody": "he Bay of Chessenta was a large bay in the southern Sea of Fallen Stars.\nIt was the preferred means of travel in Chessenta as the Chessentan roads were poorly maintained in the late 15th century DR. Oar-powered Chessentan triremes plied the waters of the often windless bay and there were many small harbors for ships to pull into. In the years after the Spellplague, piracy became a problem and a band of pirates known as the Crimson Sea Maritime Priakos operated in the bay.Brian R. James.  \"Backdrop Chessenta\" Dungeon  #178.
