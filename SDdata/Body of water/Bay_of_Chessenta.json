        "mainbody": "The '''Bay of Chessenta''' was a large bay in the southern [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n\nIt was the preferred means of travel in [[Chessenta]] as the Chessentan roads were poorly maintained in the late 15th century [[DR]]. Oar-powered Chessentan [[trireme]]s plied the waters of the often windless bay and there were many small harbors for ships to pull into. In the years after the [[Spellplague]], piracy became a problem and a band of pirates known as the [[Crimson Sea Maritime Priakos]] operated in the bay.[[Brian R. James]].  \"Backdrop: Chessenta\" ''[[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]] '' #178. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, May, 2010."
