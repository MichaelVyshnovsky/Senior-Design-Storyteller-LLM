        "mainbody": "raders Bay was the only interior waterway in Impiltur. Because of its reputation as a wretched hive of scum and villainy, it was sometimes colloquially called Traitors Bay.\nBecause the coastal port cities along the Easting Reach were sufficient to support legitimate trade, the Bay never gained prominence as a mercantile route. Thus, much of the traffic on Traders Bay consisted of fugitives, bandits, or smugglers attempting to move between the Cold Lands and the Easting Reach without attracting the attention of Impiltur.\nThe term \"Traders Bay\" referred collectively to the final stretch of the Great Imphras River as it passed through two large lakes, Bluefang Water and Old Water, and emptied into the Easting Reach. The only settlement on the Bay was Bay Town.\nPrior to the rise of Zhengyi the Witch-King in the mid&ndash14 century DR, Traders Bay was part of the trade routes of Damaran merchants en route to the Sea of Fallen Stars, but this traffic disappeared with the Witch-Kings conquests in the Vaasan War. Even after the restoration of Damara in the , the only legitimate merchants who chose to travel through the Bay were those desperate to reach the sea as fast as possible, while the rest traveled the safer and better patrolled land route.\nBy the 1370s DR, shipping traffic had begun moving up the Great Imphras River through Traders Bay to Heliogabalus, although this trade hadnt reversed the fortunes of Bay Town.\nSettlements\n* Bay Town\nWaterways\n* Bluefang Water\n* Great Imphras River\n* Old Water"
