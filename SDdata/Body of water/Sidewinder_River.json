        "mainbody": "The '''Sidewinder River''' was a twisting river found in [[Damara]].\n\nThe name \"Sidewinder\" was occasionally also used to describe the [[River Lench]] to the southeast. The reason for this was that the two rivers collectively formed a clear border between Damara and [[Impiltur]].",
        "Description": "The river was too rough for most shipping. It was difficult to cross, making it a site of strategic importance.",
        "Geography": "The Sidewinder was formed from glacial runoff from the [[Glacier of the White Worm]] at the southern end of the [[Galena Mountains]]. It flowed east from the glacier and along the northern border of both the [[Earthwood]] and the ridges of the [[Earthspur Mountains]]. It then flowed through Ravensburg before joining the [[Great Imphras River]] at [[Zarach]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Zarach]]\n* [[Ravensburg]]"
