        "mainbody": "he Sidewinder River was a twisting river found in Damara.\nThe name \"Sidewinder\" was occasionally also used to describe the River Lench to the southeast. The reason for this was that the two rivers collectively formed a clear border between Damara and Impiltur.\nThe river was too rough for most shipping. It was difficult to cross, making it a site of strategic importance.\nThe Sidewinder was formed from glacial runoff from the Glacier of the White Worm at the southern end of the Galena Mountains. It flowed east from the glacier and along the northern border of both the Earthwood and the ridges of the Earthspur Mountains. It then flowed through Ravensburg before joining the Great Imphras River at Zarach.\n* Zarach\n* Ravensburg"
