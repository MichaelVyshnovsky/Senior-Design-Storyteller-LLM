Lake Lhespen was a medium-sized lake found amid the sprawling plains of the Shaar.
The lake sat several hundred miles inland from the Shining Sea, marking the rough midpoint between Sheirtalar and the Great Rift.
The River Shaar flowed into the lake on its northeastern rim and exited on the southern end to eventually join the River Talar to the south.
The town of Lhesper sat on Lake Lhespens northern shore.
