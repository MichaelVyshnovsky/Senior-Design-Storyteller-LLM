'''Lake Lhespen''' was a medium-sized lake found amid the sprawling plains of the [[Shaar]].

==Geography==
The lake sat several hundred miles inland from the [[Shining Sea]], marking the rough midpoint between [[Sheirtalar]] and the [[Great Rift]].

The [[River Shaar]] flowed into the lake on its northeastern rim and exited on the southern end to eventually join the [[River Talar]] to the south.

==Notable Locations==
The town of [[Lhesper]] sat on Lake Lhespen's northern shore.
