'''Batihat al-Saji''', also known as the '''Lagoon of the Brave''', was a bay on [[Jazayir al-Sartan]].

==Geography==
The blue waters of this lagoon were calm, concealing the terror that lay on the bottom. The husks of sunken ships could be seen when the waters were calm.

==Inhabitants==
The water of the lagoon teemed with a variety of fish, crab, coral, and other sea life.

==Rumors and Legends==
A huge shimmering pearl lay at the bottom of the lagoon, serving as a portal to [[Pandemonium]] for [[Kar'r'rga]]. The god would occasionally enter the lagoon and come to the surface to claim his offerings or destroy those who did not pay him proper obeisance.
