The Sea of Caravans, also called Bahr al-Dahil, was an inland sea nestled between north, west, and Interior Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The Sea of Caravans was an important body of water connecting trade and commerce between Qudra and the Free Cities of Zakhara in the north with the Cities of the Heart in the southeast. Both the Mountains of the Lizards Tongue and the Spine of the Dog created steep borders along the entire stretch of the seas western and southern boundaries.
Travel by ship through the sea bypassed hundreds, if not thousands of miles, of perilous desert travel.
