The '''Sea of Caravans''', also called '''Bahr al-Dahil''', was an inland sea nestled between [[North Zakhara|north]], [[West Zakhara|west]], and [[Interior Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The Sea of Caravans was an important body of water connecting trade and commerce between [[Qudra]] and the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] in the north with the [[Cities of the Heart]] in the southeast. Both the [[Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue]] and the [[Spine of the Dog]] created steep borders along the entire stretch of the sea's western and southern boundaries.

==Activities==
Travel by ship through the sea bypassed hundreds, if not thousands of miles, of perilous desert travel.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Adhal]]
* Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue
* Spine of the Dog
* Al-Tariq Channel
