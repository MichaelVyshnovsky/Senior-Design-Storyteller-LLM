The '''Rainbow Falls''' were located in [[Ra-Khati]].

==Geopgraphy==
The mighty chasm of the Rainbow Falls was located where the [[Akundi River]] plummeted over a thousand feet into the [[Gogrus River]] within the [[Katakoro Shan]] mountains.

==Description==
Mist from the waterfalls and prevalent low-hanging clouds regularly created beautiful rainbows but masked much of the mountain walls bordering the falls.

==Rumors and Legends==
Natives of Ra-Khati viewed any absence of the common rainbows as a bad omen.

==Notable Locations==
Buildings of the [[Rainbow Monastery]] could be found along the descending path along the chasm of Rainbow Falls.
