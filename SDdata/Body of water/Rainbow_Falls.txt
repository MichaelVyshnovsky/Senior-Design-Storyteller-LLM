The Rainbow Falls were located in Ra-Khati.
The mighty chasm of the Rainbow Falls was located where the Akundi River plummeted over a thousand feet into the Gogrus River within the Katakoro Shan mountains.
Mist from the waterfalls and prevalent low-hanging clouds regularly created beautiful rainbows but masked much of the mountain walls bordering the falls.
Natives of Ra-Khati viewed any absence of the common rainbows as a bad omen.
Buildings of the Rainbow Monastery could be found along the descending path along the chasm of Rainbow Falls.
