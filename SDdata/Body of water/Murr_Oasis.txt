The '''Murr Oasis''' was an important watering place found on the southern fringe of the [[High Desert]] in the [[Pearl Cities]] of [[west Zakhara]].

==Geography==
Situated atop a landrise, the Murr Oasis overlooked the [[Realm of Bleeding Trees]] to the south. It was the first oasis any caravans traveling between [[Ajayib]] and [[Gana]] would reach when leaving either city. The oasis was equidistant, {{SI|150|mi|k|long=yes}}, from both Ajayib or Gana.
