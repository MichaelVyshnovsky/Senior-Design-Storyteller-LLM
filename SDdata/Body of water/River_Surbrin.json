        "Geography": "It flowed from the glaciers of the [[Endless Ice Sea]]\n\nThe River Surbrin flowed only a few miles to the south and east of [[Mithral Hall]], <ref> north to south along the eastern edge of the Spine of the World. In the [[Underdark]], the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] lay below the Surbrin at one point along its length.<ref>",
        "Description": "Downstream of Silverymoon, the river was generally around {{SIrange|60|70|ft|long=yes}} in breadth, sometimes reaching about {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} and rarely {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. It flowed swiftly and steadily through hard rock and was scoured by boulders, so the riverbed was largely stones and pebbles and it had very little in the way of meandering curves, [[wiktionary:oxbow|oxbows]], sandbars, or [[wiktionary:backswamp|backswamps]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url            = http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm\n| title          = So Saith Ed (Answers from Ed Greenwood) Apr - Jun 2006\n| accessdate     = 2023-01-29\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date           = 2006-04-04\n| publisher      = Candlekeep.com\n| archiveurl     = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028092559/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm\n| archivedate    = 2006-10-28\n}}\n\nGiven their glacial origin, the waters of the Surbrin could be somewhat icy, though they were a little warmer by the time they flowed into the Dessarin.

        "Trade": "It was not uncommon for merchants to take a barge up the Surbrin to [[Mornbryn's Shield]] to load their holds with [[Shield moss]]. There was heated competition for it, and they paid 50 to 75 gp for a bargeful.<ref>",
        "Notable Locations": "The town of [[Nesmé]] sat on the eastern side of the River Surbrin, with a large fortified bridge across it to the stronghold of the [[Riders of Nesmé]].<ref><ref>\n\nThe hamlet of [[Mornbryn's Shield]] lay on the north bank where the Surbrin was met by the Laughingflow.\n\nFurther south, the town of [[Yartar]] stood at the confluence of the Surbrin and Dessarin rivers; it too had a bridge over the Surbrin. Its people fished the Surbrin, Dessarin, and Laughingflow (which they called \"the Three Rivers\").<ref><ref><ref><ref>",

It is much too narrow and rocky where the Surbrin should be wide and navigable, so it is presumed to be a tributary instead."
