The '''Unicorn Run''' was a river that started somewhere in the [[Star Mounts]] in the [[High Forest]] and joined the [[River Delimbiyr]] near [[Secomber]].

| I know why bards who see this river sing of it for the rest of their lives. It is certainly one of the most beautiful regions of all Faerun.

==Description==
According to legends, each of the natural races emerged from [[Chauntea]]'s womb at the Unicorn Run's source, and traveled down it to the outside world. Whether or not this was true is unclear. To [[Elf|elves]], [[Korred|korreds]], and [[Halfling|halflings]], the Unicorn Run was sacred to life and a site of purity. All three races placed taboos on extended trips up the river out of fear that if the river was fouled, no new races would ever be born on [[Toril]] again.<ref><ref>
