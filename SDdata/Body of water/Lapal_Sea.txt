The '''Lapal Sea''' was a prominent freshwater lake found deep in the heart of the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Geography==
The lake was found {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} inland from the coast and the [[Great Sea]]. It measured {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} in length and was slightly elongated from north to south. It served as the dividing border between the [[Mhair Jungles]] in the east and the [[Black Jungles]] in the west. Several rivers emptied into the Lapal Sea from the surrounding jungle including the [[River Amarast]] and a few unnamed rivers. The [[River Lapar]] flowed from the Lapal Sea's southern end, through the jungle to empty into the Great Sea at the [[Lapalgulph]].

==Activity==
Boats were practically unheard of on the Lapal Sea since the [[yuan-ti]] of [[House Sseradess]] inhabiting the area preferred to swim and the other tribes rode harnessed [[elasmosaurus]]es.

==Inhabitants==
The elasmosauruses dominated the Lapal Sea. Other creatures found here included [[ahuizotl]]s, [[chuul]]s, and [[dark tentacle]]s.
