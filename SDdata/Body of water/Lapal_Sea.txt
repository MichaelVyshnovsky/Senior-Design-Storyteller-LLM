The Lapal Sea was a prominent freshwater lake found deep in the heart of the Chultan Peninsula.
The lake was found  inland from the coast and the Great Sea. It measured  in length and was slightly elongated from north to south. It served as the dividing border between the Mhair Jungles in the east and the Black Jungles in the west. Several rivers emptied into the Lapal Sea from the surrounding jungle including the River Amarast and a few unnamed rivers. The River Lapar flowed from the Lapal Seas southern end, through the jungle to empty into the Great Sea at the Lapalgulph.
Boats were practically unheard of on the Lapal Sea since the yuan-ti of House Sseradess inhabiting the area preferred to swim and the other tribes rode harnessed elasmosauruses.
The elasmosauruses dominated the Lapal Sea. Other creatures found here included ahuizotls, chuuls, and dark tentacles.
