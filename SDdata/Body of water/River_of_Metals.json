        "mainbody": "The River of Metals was a river found in Threskel, a realm that was once considered part of northern Unther.\nThe river was named after its rich deposits of precious metals, especially gold.\nThe River of Metals flowed from the Methmere to the Alamber Sea. The city of Messemprar was built in its estuary. \nThe river disappeared after the violent changes in the northern region of Unther that occurred because of the Spellplague of 1385 DR.The river is not seen in the official 4th edition maps.\nThe lands north of the river were exceptionally well-suited for growing crops.\nThroughout recorded history, the river has played host to two separate gold rushes, each of which were halted due to the greed of young chromatic dragons that came down from the Riders to the Sky mountains to claim the riches for their own."
