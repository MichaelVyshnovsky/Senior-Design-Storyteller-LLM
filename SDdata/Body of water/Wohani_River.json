        "mainbody": "The Wohani River was a river in the Po Yul Dzayul Range in Phutan and Tabot.\nJoined by a tributary, the Wohani River had its headwaters in the Po Yul Dzayul Range, near where the range joined the Haraki Ridge. It flowed south through the foothills, crossing the border between the nations of Phutan and Tabot, before emptying into Nam Tso. The lake was also fed by the Nam River, which emerged from the range further to the south. The Wohani River was known for its misty trails and it was overlooked by Hoshki Gompa."
