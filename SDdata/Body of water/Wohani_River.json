It flowed south through the foothills, crossing the border between the nations of Phutan and Tabot, before emptying into [[Nam Tso]]. The lake was also fed by the [[Nam River]], which emerged from the range further to the south. The Wohani River was known for its misty trails and it was overlooked by [[Hoshki Gompa]]."
