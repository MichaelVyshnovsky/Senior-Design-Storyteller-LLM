'''Dowan Pool''' was a pool in the [[Blackrocks]].

==Geography==
The pool lay along the [[Two Pools]] trail accessible from the [[Trade Way]].

==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, [[Thoadrin]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] took the Two Pools trail after ambushing [[Orthil Voldovan]], looking to buy crossbow bolts from a trader by Dowan Pool. He then used the same trail to return to the Trade Way and ambush Orthil Voldovan's caravan again.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|176-177|11}}
