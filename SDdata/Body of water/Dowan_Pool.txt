Dowan Pool was a pool in the Blackrocks.
The pool lay along the Two Pools trail accessible from the Trade Way.
In late , Thoadrin of the Cult of the Dragon took the Two Pools trail after ambushing Orthil Voldovan, looking to buy crossbow bolts from a trader by Dowan Pool. He then used the same trail to return to the Trade Way and ambush Orthil Voldovans caravan again.
