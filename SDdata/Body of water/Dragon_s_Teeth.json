        "mainbody": "'''The Dragon's Teeth''', or '''Lui Do-pah''' were the straits lying between the [[Koryo Peninsula]] in [[Koryo]] and the island of [[Ryuten]] in [[Kozakura]], in [[Kara-Tur]]. It linked the [[Sea of Kozakura]] and the [[ganra ye-do]]. They lay south of [[Paektu-san]].",
        "Description": "Consisting of tangled reefs, unreliable shoals, and even shifting islands, the Dragon's Teeth were well named as a danger to shipping. Worse, they extended for hundreds of miles and were considered to be wholly unnavigable.",
        "Legend": "The reefs had wrecked many ships, killing many sailors and taking the fortunes of kings down to the seafloor. They were thought to be a curse on sailors, that all cursed ships were drawn to their dooms in the Dragon's Teeth. Stories told of [[ghost ship]]s drifting through the straits and hideous sea [[dragon]]s that would emerge from the waves to devour whole crews.",
        "History": "Around [[1350 DR]], when a tsunami wrecked the secret armada of the [[king of Silla]], [[Meo Cha]] and [[Meo Li]] considered themselves very lucky not to get lost in Lui Do-pah."
