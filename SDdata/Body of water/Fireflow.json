        "mainbody": "The Fireflow, also called Gaping Stream, was one of the watercourses of the Esmelflow in Amn.\nThe water in this stream was icy cold.\nThis creek began at the Gaping Face Cascade and served as the western branch of upper Khalleshyr river.\nThe famous ranger Vinnam once escaped from a band of trolls by plunging into this stream. Strangely, the trolls seemed to avoid the water as if it were fire, and so Vinnam named it the Fireflow."
