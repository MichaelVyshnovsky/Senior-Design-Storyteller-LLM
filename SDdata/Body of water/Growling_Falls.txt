The Growling Falls was a 200-foot (60-meter) tall waterfall in the Pasocada Basin. The noise it made was believed to be the growling of a monstrous bear fiend imprisoned there. Because the bear was the child of a god who had assumed an animal form, it could not be killed. It once threatened the land until it was defeated by a hero that the Azuposi called Hinchapa and the Dog People called Incholcpa.
