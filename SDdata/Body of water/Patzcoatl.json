        "mainbody": "atzcoatl, or the Western Ocean, was the massive body of water on the western side of the continent of Maztica.\nThe Western Ocean washed the shores of Huetle Island, and had several villages built on its shores Ixit, Honal, and Azcat, while the Bay of Kolan was a sheltered shallow bay inhabited by the Kolan human tribes.\nThe shores of Patzcoatl were inhabited by the sea-faring Metahel tribes of Maztica, who were exceptional fishers. The Metahel peoples also hunted whales that inhabited the waters of the Western Ocean. The tribe also traded in materials gathered, caught, and produced from the Patzcoatl ocean shells, mussels, dried fish, as well as lamp whale oil.\nKolan tribes of Maztica dwelt in humble villages along the shores of the Western Ocean, sheltered from the Huacli nation by a mountain chain.\nThe Azuposi spirit known as the Spider Woman, or Sussistinako dwelled in Wenimats, in a kiva from whence her lover, the Sun, visited her every day, bringing the light to the True World."
