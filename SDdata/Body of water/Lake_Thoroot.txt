'''Lake Thoroot''' was a large underground lake in the [[Underdark]].

==Geography==
Lake Thoroot was located somewhere beneath [[Cormanthor]] and was connected to [[Battledale]] via a tunnel.

The lake was connected to the [[Lake of Shadows]] by a river, which flowed in the direction of Lake Thoroot. The lakes were about a tenday apart. 

==Description==
Lake Thoroot was a large and flat underground lake. It was surrounded by steep cliffs, a waterfall, and stalactites. An island in the lake housed the [[dwarf|dwarven]] (formerly [[drow]]) city of [[Zanhoriloch]], and the lake boasted a colony of [[aboleth]]s by the same name.

There were green-yellow-glowing jellyfish in the lake.

==History==
In [[1372 DR|1372]]/[[1373 DR]], a [[drow]] expedition led by [[Quenthel Baenre]] camped on the shores of the lake near the waterfall while they sought for information about a downed [[ship of chaos]]. While scouting the lake, [[Valas Hune]] encountered a strange, mutated drow who urged him to flee. Valas was subsequently captured by an aboleth named [[Jooran]], who used his slime to turn him into the same kind of mutated drow. Valas was able to escape back to his companions and [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] returned him to drow-form via a ''[[polymorph]]'' spell.

==Notable locations==
* [[Zanhoriloch]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] settlement on an island and the name of the aboleth colony.
