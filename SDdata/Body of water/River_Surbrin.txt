The '''River Surbrin'''<ref group="note">On the map on page 174 of the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'', a portion of this river is labeled the "River Surbin"'. This is believed to be a typo, as the vast majority of other sources refer to it as the "River Surbrin". was a river in the [[Silver Marches]] and [[Savage Frontier]]. The land around it was known as the [[Surbrin Valley]].<ref>

==Geography==
It flowed from the glaciers of the [[Endless Ice Sea]]

The River Surbrin flowed only a few miles to the south and east of [[Mithral Hall]], <ref> north to south along the eastern edge of the Spine of the World. In the [[Underdark]], the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] lay below the Surbrin at one point along its length.<ref>

==Description==
Downstream of Silverymoon, the river was generally around {{SIrange|60|70|ft|long=yes}} in breadth, sometimes reaching about {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} and rarely {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. It flowed swiftly and steadily through hard rock and was scoured by boulders, so the riverbed was largely stones and pebbles and it had very little in the way of meandering curves, [[wiktionary:oxbow|oxbows]], sandbars, or [[wiktionary:backswamp|backswamps]].<ref>{{cite web

Given their glacial origin, the waters of the Surbrin could be somewhat icy, though they were a little warmer by the time they flowed into the Dessarin. The river was navigable as far north as where it was met by the Rauvin, though it was possible with a small boat and lot of luck to continue up the Surbrin almost to its headwaters and up the Rauvin as far as [[Dead Orc Pass]]. The upper reaches of the Surbrin river valley, however, were still considered remote and quite hazardous.<ref>

In the spring, there was terrific flooding of the land around the junction of the Surbrin and Laughingflow, though the settlement at Mornbryn's Shield there was protected by the namesake ridge.

==Trade==
It was not uncommon for merchants to take a barge up the Surbrin to [[Mornbryn's Shield]] to load their holds with [[Shield moss]]. There was heated competition for it, and they paid 50 to 75 gp for a bargeful.<ref>

==Notable Locations==
The town of [[Nesmé]] sat on the eastern side of the River Surbrin, with a large fortified bridge across it to the stronghold of the [[Riders of Nesmé]].<ref><ref>

The hamlet of [[Mornbryn's Shield]] lay on the north bank where the Surbrin was met by the Laughingflow.

Further south, the town of [[Yartar]] stood at the confluence of the Surbrin and Dessarin rivers; it too had a bridge over the Surbrin. Its people fished the Surbrin, Dessarin, and Laughingflow (which they called "the Three Rivers").<ref><ref><ref><ref>

==History==
The [[Harpell]] family of [[Longsaddle]] finished building a new bridge over the Surbrin, permitting trade north of Nesmé to [[Silverymoon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.<ref>

In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the thieves [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Doric]] crossed a rocky tributary of the River Surbrin in a marshy area on their way to the [[Evermoors cemetery]].<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group="note">As shown in the image, this location is unidentified in ''Honor Among Thieves'' but it is marked on the [https://www.gamestop.com/toys-games/board-games/products/monopoly-dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-movie-edition-board-game/357169.html Monopoly Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves Movie Edition Board Game]. It is much too narrow and rocky where the Surbrin should be wide and navigable, so it is presumed to be a tributary instead.
