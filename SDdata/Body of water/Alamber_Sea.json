        "mainbody": "The Alamber Sea, also known as the Sahuagin Sea, was the primary trade avenue between the nations of Mulhorand, Unther, Thay, and Tymanther (and for a time, High Imaskar as well). As a result, its waters were considered neutral territory.\nAs of 1489 DR, the waters of the Alamber Sea were bordered by Mulhorand to the east and Unther and Tymanther to the west. The nation of Thay bordered the Alamber to the north, except where it connected to the larger Inner Sea. The northernmost island of Alaor served as the center of Thayvian naval power in the region.\nCirca 1270 DR, in an elaborate ritual to summon Kossuths avatar, the high priest of the Kossuthan temple Flaming Brazier in Bezantur attempted to douse the Alamber Sea with a decanter of endless lamp oil and then ignite it. This adversely affected sea life in the Alamber for years to come and engendered hatred in its sahuagin inhabitants towards the port city.\nDespite its status as neutral territory, merchant vessels and other ships found in the Alamber Sea were usually Thayvian in origin. A considerable number of pirates frequented these waters, and below the surface lay the sahuagin kingdom of Aleaxtis.\n Alaor This island in the northern Alamber Sea boasts a considerable Thayvian naval base.\n Ship of the Gods Mulhorandi diviners predict this small volcanic island will erupt in the near future.\nDragonborn from Tymanther called the Alamber Sea \"Vorelheching Kethendia\", what means \"the Beautiful Water of Gems\" in Tymantheran draconic."
