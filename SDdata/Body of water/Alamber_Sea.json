        "mainbody": "The '''Alamber Sea''', also known as the '''Sahuagin Sea''', was the primary trade avenue between the nations of [[Mulhorand]], [[Unther]], [[Thay]], and [[Tymanther]] (and for a time, [[High Imaskar]] as well). As a result, its waters were considered neutral territory.",
        "Geography": "As of [[1489 DR]], the waters of the Alamber Sea were bordered by Mulhorand to the east and Unther and Tymanther to the west. The nation of Thay bordered the Alamber to the north, except where it connected to the larger [[Inner Sea]]. The northernmost island of [[Alaor]] served as the center of Thayvian naval power in the region.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1270 DR]], in an elaborate ritual to summon [[Kossuth]]'s [[avatar]], the high [[priest]] of the [[Kossuthan]] temple [[Flaming Brazier (Bezantur)|Flaming Brazier]] in [[Bezantur]] attempted to douse the Alamber Sea with a ''[[decanter of endless lamp oil]]'' and then ignite it. This adversely affected sea life in the Alamber for years to come and engendered hatred in its [[sahuagin]] inhabitants towards the port city.<ref>",
        "Inhabitants": "Despite its status as neutral territory, merchant vessels and other ships found in the Alamber Sea were usually Thayvian in origin. A considerable number of pirates frequented these waters, and below the surface lay the sahuagin kingdom of [[Aleaxtis]].",
        "Places of Interest": {
            "[[Alaor]]": "This island in the northern Alamber Sea boasts a considerable Thayvian naval base.",
            "[[Ship of the Gods]]": "Mulhorandi diviners predict this small volcanic island will erupt in the near future."
        },
        "Trivia": "[[Dragonborn]] from Tymanther called the Alamber Sea \"''Vorelheching Kethendia''\", what means \"the Beautiful Water of Gems\" in [[Tymantheran (dialect)|Tymantheran]] [[Draconic language|draconic]]."
