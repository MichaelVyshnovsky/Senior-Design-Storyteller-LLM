        "Inhabitants": "Wyrm Bay was so named because of a large population of territorial [[dragon turtle]]s that lived beneath the waves. The dragon turtles were fiercely protective and could easily capsize ships if they weren't busy fighting each other. Safe passage through Wyrm Bay was often directly related to the quality of tribute or treasure offered to the dragon turtles."
