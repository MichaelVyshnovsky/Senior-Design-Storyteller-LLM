        "mainbody": "yrm Bay was found within the Pirate  Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThis roughly circular bay formed much of the eastern edge of Dragonisle\nThe waters of Wyrm Bay were quite clear.\nWyrm Bay was so named because of a large population of territorial dragon turtles that lived beneath the waves. The dragon turtles were fiercely protective and could easily capsize ships if they werent busy fighting each other. Safe passage through Wyrm Bay was often directly related to the quality of tribute or treasure offered to the dragon turtles."
