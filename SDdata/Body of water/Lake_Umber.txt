Lake Umber was a freshwater lake at the base of Thayan First Escarpment between Thay and Aglarond.
The river plummeted from the escarpment and widened, shaping the slow-moving narrow lake. From there, it flowed through the Lower Falls and formed the main wider body of Lake Umber.
Lake Umber was a part of the River Umber, which began in the mountain glaciers
The area surrounding the lake was sparsely populated. It was claimed by both Thay and Aglarond, and only a few fishermen families lived on its banks.
The shores of Lake Umber were fertile enough to support small fishing and farming industries. The most common trees that grew on its banks were oaks, birches, and willows.
The main body of the lake had two vulnerable and unwalled trading towns sitting on its north and south shores Nethentir and Nethjet, respectively. Most of the locals were simple fishermen with a few farms scattered in the area producing food for the residents of the two towns but not for export.
The tharchion of the Thaymount controlled the length of the River Umber, including Lake Umber and both towns of Nethentir and Nethjet.
