        "mainbody": "Taak Lake was a small, fresh-water lake in Alpuk north of the Cold Lands.\nTaak Lake was located off of the Utaak Stream, at the base of the Lugsaas Chain near the gap in those mountains that led to the village of Ishe in Vaasa. It was southwest of the Iulutiun village of Puttak.\nPrior to the 15 century DR, Taak Lake was on the Great Glacier. It was frozen most of the year since it was only  at its deepest point and because of the bitter cold of the region."
