        "mainbody": "'''Shining Falls''' was an amazing waterfall in the [[Graypeak Mountains]] that formed part of the [[River Delimbiyr]]. It marked the beginning of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] and once marked the southernmost point of the [[elf]] realm of [[Eaerlann]].",
        "Description": "The waters fell in a great torrent around a {{SIAdj|120|ft|long=yes|adj=high}}, horseshoe-shaped concave drop-off, making for a breathtaking and beautiful sight. In turn, the top of the falls granted an amazing view of the whole Delimbiyr Vale on one side and of the slopes and woods of the Graypeaks on the other.",
        "Notable Features": "At the top of the waterfall was a tiny island, lying in the middle of the river and right near the drop with no safe way off. It was rocky and covered in shrubs, and drenched in spray from the river and falls; nothing edible was to found except for fish in the river. People on the river bank had a clear view of the island. A stone here was the site of a ''[[portal]]'' that was part of the [[Voices of the Lost]] [[song path]] ''portal'' network. \n\nBehind the falls was a secret entrance (and the single surface entrance) to the Royal Caverns of [[Splendarrmornn]], the capital city of the dwarven realm of [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]]. The Royal Caverns were a legendary tomb of [[dwarf]] royalty,<ref> but tomb raiders had cleared them out long before the mid-1300s DR. By then, the caves were more often used as a hideout by bandits working for the Zhentarim.\n\nAbove the falls were the remnants of an old Eaerlanni portage road, though this had become no more than a light path used by [[deer]]. The ruins of a port could also be found.\n\nDownriver of the falls was a [[strongheart halfling]] village named for it, [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]].",
        "Activities": "The River Delimbiyr was navigable its full length, except at the Shining Falls, which forced a halt to all upriver travel, though efforts were made for the portage of water craft and goods.",
        "History": "In the days of [[Eaerlann]], most trade up the Delimbiyr was taken off the river at Loudwater onto wagons that follow a portage path. It went north around the Shining Falls, before being returned to the river above them. The Eaerlanni elves had an outpost above the falls and the falls marked part of its southern border. By the 14{{th}} only traces remained.\n\nThe [[undead]] cavalry of [[Hellgate Keep]] were known to hunt [[human]]s for sport in the vicinity of Shining Falls.<ref>\n\nAround [[1368]]â€“[[1370 DR]], the [[Zhent]]ish forces occupying [[Llorkh]] and [[Orlbar]] worked to re-establish a portage part around Shining Falls, in an effort to continue trade upriver all the way to [[Sundabar]]. The destruction of Hellgate Keep in [[1369 DR]] only made them more determined, but [[treant]]s in the forest near the [[Heartblood River]] tributary blocked their efforts.\n\n\"Princess\" [[Tianna Skyflower]] of the brigands known as the [[Half-Elven Renegades]] had relocated her base to the edge of the [[High Forest]] near Shining Falls by 1370 DR, her purpose unknown.\n\nAround [[1372 DR]], the Zhents and allied bandits had a significant camp at the base of the falls, with patrols and lesser camps above and around it and a sizeable one in the caves behind leading to the dwarven tombs. They included 280 human soldiers, priests, mages, and 60 [[orc]] laborers. They operated in secret as part of plans to attack settlements upriver, such as Sundabar. They would attack those who stumbled upon them."
