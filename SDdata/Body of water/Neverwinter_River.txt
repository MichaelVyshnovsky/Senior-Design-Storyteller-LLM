Neverwinter River, known to the ancient dwarves as Nethlur, was a major river in the Sword Coast North of northwest Faer√ªn that flowed through the city Neverwinter. Its source was at Mount Hotenow and it emptied into the Bay of Mists on the Sea of Swords.
Neverwinter Rivers bright waters ran warm throughout the year,
Three bridges once spanned the river in the city Neverwinter the Sleeping Dragon, the Winged Wyvern, and the Dolphin, each sculpted in the form of its name. Following the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR, only the Winged Wyvern remained functional

As it flowed through Neverwinter Wood, the river was fed by Beruns River, Edals Creek, the Gibdraw, and the River Morgur.
Many believed the city of Neverwinter was named for the persistent heat in the river that provided warmth regardless of the season. The River District in the city was also named for the Neverwinter River.
When Mount Hotenow erupted, dark ash choked the river for months before it was able to flow properly.
