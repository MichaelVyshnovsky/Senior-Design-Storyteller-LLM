        "mainbody": "The '''River Sur''' was a small river in the [[Unapproachable East]] that flowed down from a spring on the northern face of the [[First Escarpment]] of the [[Thayan Plateau]]. Its waters flowed northeast along the borders of the [[Thay]]an tharchs [[Eltabbar (tharch)|Eltabbar]] and [[Surthay (tharch)|Surthay]], past the [[Surmarsh]], before opening into [[Lake Mulsantir]].\n\nThe river formed a border between the nations of Thay and [[Thesk]].",
        "Description": "The River Sur was narrow and fast at its source but became quite wide a short distance later, slowing in speed. The shallow waters that wound past the Surmarsh were infested with disease-carrying insects.",
        "Notable locations": "A few Thayan settlements dotted the southern shores of the River Sur. They were seldom visited by Thayan tax collectors and generally left to their independence. The Theskian fishing settlement of [[Tezir|Tezir-on-the-Marsh]] was nestled in the lands where the river fed Lake Mulsantir."
