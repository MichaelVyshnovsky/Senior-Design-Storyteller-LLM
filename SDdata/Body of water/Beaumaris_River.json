        "mainbody": "The Beaumaris River flowed south from Mirror Lake, turned east and cut Vaasa in half, flowed through the Galena Mountains at Bloodstone Pass, and headed to the south into Damara.\nThe Beaumaris was a river of meltwater from the Great Glacier that was known to be clean, cold, and refreshing. It was completely frozen during the winter, and during the summer it flowed slowly and was shallow to such an extent that even small boats could not navigate its fords without being carried. \nIn Vaasa, goblinoids and other monsters including minotaurs were known to lair along the river, so the local people considered it dangerous to travel along. Nevertheless, the stretch between Moortown and Kond became an important route for moving trade goods downriver in the late 15 century DR.\nOrigin\nThe river began in Mirror Lake just northwest of Vaasa, which was in turn largely fed by the River Pelauvir.\nVaasa\nThe river entered Vaasa in the northwest though the Bottomless Bogs before winding through the Clefts of Razack to Nigels Ford and on into Bloodstone Pass beneath the Vaasan Gate.\nDead Mans Walk ran adjacent to the river as it flowed through Vaasa. The sites of Moortown and Nigels Ford provided crossing points. In the 15 century DR, another bridge was built near Telos City to span the Clefts and the river far below.\nDamara\nThe river flowed south into Damara through Lake Midai in Bloodstone Valley, and continued along this course under the Damaran Gate and out of Bloodstone Pass. It flowed for many miles until it turned to the northeast, where it merged with the Goliad River at Goliad. The Ford of Goliad, an important strategic site, crossed the Beaumaris just west of its juncture with the Goliad."
