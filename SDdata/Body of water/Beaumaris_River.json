        "Description": "The Beaumaris was a river of meltwater from the [[Great Glacier]] that was known to be clean, cold, and refreshing. It was completely frozen during the winter, and during the summer it flowed slowly and was shallow to such an extent that even small boats could not navigate its fords without being carried. \n\nIn Vaasa, [[goblinoid]]s and other monsters including [[minotaurs]] were known to lair along the river, so the local people considered it dangerous to travel along.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} Nevertheless, the stretch between Moortown and [[Kond]] became an important route for moving trade goods downriver in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "'''Origin'''\n\nThe river began in Mirror Lake just northwest of Vaasa, which was in turn largely fed by the [[River Pelauvir]].\n\n'''Vaasa'''\n\nThe river entered Vaasa in the northwest though the [[Bottomless Bogs]] before winding through the [[Clefts of Razack]] to [[Nigel's Ford]] and on into Bloodstone Pass beneath the [[Vaasan Gate]].\n\n[[Dead Man's Walk]] ran adjacent to the river as it flowed through Vaasa. The sites of [[Moortown]] and [[Nigel's Ford]] provided crossing points. In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], another bridge was built near [[Telos City]] to span the Clefts and the river far below.\n\n'''Damara'''\n\nThe river flowed south into Damara through [[Lake Midai]] in Bloodstone Valley, and continued along this course under the [[Damaran Gate]] and out of Bloodstone Pass. It flowed for many miles until it turned to the northeast, where it merged with the [[Goliad River]] at [[Goliad]]. The [[Ford of Goliad]], an important strategic site, crossed the Beaumaris just west of its juncture with the Goliad."
