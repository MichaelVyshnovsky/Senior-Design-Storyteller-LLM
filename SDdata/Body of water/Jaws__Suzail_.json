From the lake, it hooked back north around the [[Court Close]] and moved back south until turning into a culvert on the opposite side of the block where [[the Winking Eye]] stood.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Jaws' length was greatly shortened. The stream's culvert tunnel began between Castle Obarskyr\nand Cormyr's Royal Court, with the rest of the stream paved and built over.",
