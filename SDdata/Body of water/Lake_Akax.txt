'''Lake Akax''', also known as the '''Ghostmere''', was a lake found in the borderlands between [[Akan没l]] and [[Chessenta]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lake Akax was a deep, hypersaline lake, and its waters were home to strange [[elemental]] [[ooze]]s that could mimic the forms of those who drowned in the lake. For this reason the lake was feared by most people. During winters, the borders of Lake Akax became a solidified, caustic sludge that could dissolve flesh and bone.

==Geography==
The lake had a long and misshapen form that stretched from the dry interior uplands of western Chessenta and Akan没l down to the former mouth of the Akax River at the ruins of [[Soorenar]]. The River Akax continued to flow down from the lake across the expansive [[Adder Swamp]] until it flowed into the diminished [[Bay of Chessenta]]. The settlements of [[Thurik]] and [[Jeblant]] were found on its northern shores, while the south and east merged into the Adder Swamp.

==History==
The lake was formed from the remnants of the [[River Akax]] and the [[Akanamere]], which were heavily altered by the ravages of the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]]. While the Akanamere shrank to [[Stoneshield Lake]] and [[Lake Fand]] and its flow redirected into the [[Adder River]] via the [[Belur River]], the River Akax was cut off and largely swallowed by the vastly expanded Adder Swamp, forming Lake Akax.
