'''Lake Mogador''' was a crucial central location in [[Damara]] for both commercial and political reasons.

==Description==
Given the lake's position as the convergence point for most of Damara's waterways, nearly all goods leaving Damara by water passed through the lake at some point. To protect their interests, the Damaran baronies of [[Morov]], [[Ostel]] and [[Polten]] all maintained heavily armed vessels on the lake in addition to their regular commercial ships.

==Geography==
Lake Mogador was literally situated in the center of Damara bordering several major baronies and duchies. Both the [[Goliad River]] and [[Icelace River]] emptied into the lake, making it the convergence of both of these rivers as well as of their major tributaries, the [[Beaumaris River]] and the [[Galena Snake]] respectively. The lake emptied into the [[Great Imphras River]], which flowed south into [[Impiltur]].

==History==
Following the fall of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Lake Mogador became the sight of a simmering conflict between the southern baronies of Damara as they jockeyed for control over the critical waterway, with some small skirmishes occurring between the fleets of Ostel and Polten.
