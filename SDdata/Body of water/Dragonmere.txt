The '''Dragonmere''' (also known as the '''Lake of Dragons''') was a lake on the [[Dragon Coast]] at the western edge of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] were on the northern part of this lake, with the [[Dragon Coast]] along the south.

The Dragonmere was almost 100 miles from north to south at its widest point. As of [[1372 DR]], at its narrowest point it was ten miles wide, with [[Westgate]] to the south, and [[Urmlaspyr]] to the north.
