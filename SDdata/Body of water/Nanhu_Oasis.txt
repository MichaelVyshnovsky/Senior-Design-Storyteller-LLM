Nanhu Oasis, meaning South Lake Oasis in the language of the horsemen, was an oasis in the Hordelands.
Located east of the Teyla Shan mountain range, Nanhu Oasis was a small, shallow, lake covered in reeds.
Due to the shortage of wells and other oasis in the region, Nanhu Oasis was an important stop for the caravans that went through the Fergana Pass out of Semphar to reach the Silk Road.
During the summer, the lake was known to sometimes dry up, though water could often still be found by digging a little below the surface. No settlements were located along the lake due to its inconstant water supply.
An ubbe lived at the lake around 1359 DR.
