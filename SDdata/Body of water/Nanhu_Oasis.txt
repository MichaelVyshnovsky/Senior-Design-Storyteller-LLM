'''Nanhu Oasis''', meaning '''South Lake Oasis''' in the language of the horsemen, was an oasis in the [[Hordelands]].

== Description ==
Located east of the [[Teyla Shan]] mountain range, Nanhu Oasis was a small, shallow, lake covered in reeds.

Due to the shortage of wells and other oasis in the region, Nanhu Oasis was an important stop for the caravans that went through the [[Fergana Pass]] out of [[Semphar]] to reach the [[Silk Road]].

During the summer, the lake was known to sometimes dry up, though water could often still be found by digging a little below the surface. No settlements were located along the lake due to its inconstant water supply.

An [[ubbe]] lived at the lake around [[1359 DR]].
