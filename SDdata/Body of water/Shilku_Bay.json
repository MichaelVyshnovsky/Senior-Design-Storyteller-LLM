        "mainbody": "Shilku Bay was a coastal inlet located along the western side of Chult. It was one of the few places suitable for landing a ship along the Wild Coast.\nAn active volcano sat to the west of the bay. This volcano erupted during the 15 century DR, creating a river of lava that perpetually flowed into the bay, which caused the water to hiss and turn poisonous with sulfur. Clouds of hot ash and even fiery stones falling from the sky made any effort to land on the western shore by ship exceedingly dangerous. However, the eastern shore continued to have safe landing places.\nDuring the heyday of Hrakhamar, trade roads connected it to Shilku Bay.\nThe eruption of the nearby volcano was still ongoing as of the time of the death curse in the late 15 century DR. During this time, Liara Portyr&mdashleader of the Flaming Fist at Fort Beluarian&mdashsought to fund an expedition of adventurers to scout Shilku Bay and determine if it was worthwhile to establish an outpost there.\n* Shilku This town sat on the western edge of the bay."
