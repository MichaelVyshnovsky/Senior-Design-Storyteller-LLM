        "mainbody": "'''Shilku Bay''' was a coastal inlet located along the western side of [[Chult]]. It was one of the few places suitable for landing a [[ship]] along the [[Wild Coast]].",
        "Description": "An active volcano sat to the west of the bay. This volcano erupted during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], creating a river of lava that perpetually flowed into the bay, which caused the water to hiss and turn poisonous with [[sulfur]]. Clouds of hot ash and even fiery stones falling from the sky made any effort to land on the western shore by ship exceedingly dangerous. However, the eastern shore continued to have safe landing places.",
        "History": "During the heyday of [[Hrakhamar]], trade roads connected it to Shilku Bay.\n\nThe eruption of the nearby volcano was still ongoing as of the time of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{ToA-time}} During this time, [[Liara Portyr]]&mdash;leader of the [[Flaming Fist]] at [[Fort Beluarian]]&mdash;sought to fund an expedition of [[adventurer]]s to scout Shilku Bay and determine if it was worthwhile to establish an outpost there.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Shilku]]: This town sat on the western edge of the bay."
