The '''River Isis''' was a waterway found in the realm of [[Heliopolis]], in both the [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great Wheel]] and [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree]] models of the [[multiverse]], that was named for the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi goddess]] [[Isis]].

==Description==
The waters of the River Isis were cool and clear. Uniquely, in the Great Wheel cosmology they were said to be tinged with a [[magic]] that prevented them from becoming polluted no matter what was put into them. The water was also said to act like [[holy water]], but only while it was within Isis's city of [[Gizekhtet]]. If it was taken beyond the city, it would be normal water.

==Geography==
In the Great Wheel cosmology, the River Isis was said to run solely through the city of Gizekhtet, in the [[divine realm]] of the same name. In the World Tree model, the river was said to instead flow all throughout the desert of Heliopolis, irrigating the land and providing a source for all life in the plane. Along its banks stood the city of [[Thebestys]] and it passed through the city of Gizekhtet.
