The River Umber was a fast-flowing river full of cascades that formed part of the natural borders between Aglarond, Thesk, and Thay.
The river has its headwaters in the high glaciers of Thaymount and flowed west. At the town of Nethentir it flowed down the First Escarpment and into Lake Umber, and from there it flowed past the Tannath Gap between the Tannath Mountains and the Dragonjaw Mountains into the Sea of Dlurg.
The river banks were muddy and fertile. Fields of wild wheat, walnuts, hickories, and oaks grew along its banks.
Vessels could navigate the river, all the way to the eastern end of Lake Umber. Thay often sent trade ships down the river into the Sea of Dlurg and the Sea of Fallen Stars.
