The '''River Umber''' was a fast-flowing river full of cascades that formed part of the natural borders between [[Aglarond]], [[Thesk]], and [[Thay]].

{{quote|''The River Umber rolled lazily through the plain, cutting a broad course into Aglarond. The Umber regularly overflowed its banks because of the Red Wizardâ€™s rain spells, helping to keep the area fertile. ''}} 

==Geography==
The river has its headwaters in the high glaciers of [[Thaymount]] and flowed west. At the town of [[Nethentir]] it flowed down the [[First Escarpment]] and into [[Lake Umber]], and from there it flowed past the [[Tannath Gap]] between the [[Tannath Mountains]] and the [[Dragonjaw Mountains]] into the [[Sea of Dlurg]].

===Flora & Fauna===
The river banks were muddy and fertile. Fields of wild wheat, [[walnut]]s, [[hickory|hickories]], and [[oak]]s grew along its banks.

==Trade==
Vessels could navigate the river, all the way to the eastern end of Lake Umber. Thay often sent trade ships down the river into the Sea of Dlurg and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].
