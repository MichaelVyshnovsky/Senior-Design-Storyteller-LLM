        "mainbody": "Lake Thoroot was a large underground lake in the Underdark.\nLake Thoroot was located somewhere beneath Cormanthor and was connected to Battledale via a tunnel.\nThe lake was connected to the Lake of Shadows by a river, which flowed in the direction of Lake Thoroot. The lakes were about a tenday apart. \nLake Thoroot was a large and flat underground lake. It was surrounded by steep cliffs, a waterfall, and stalactites. An island in the lake housed the dwarven (formerly drow) city of Zanhoriloch, and the lake boasted a colony of aboleths by the same name.\nThere were green-yellow-glowing jellyfish in the lake.\nIn 1372/1373 DR, a drow expedition led by Quenthel Baenre camped on the shores of the lake near the waterfall while they sought for information about a downed ship of chaos. While scouting the lake, Valas Hune encountered a strange, mutated drow who urged him to flee. Valas was subsequently captured by an aboleth named Jooran, who used his slime to turn him into the same kind of mutated drow. Valas was able to escape back to his companions and Pharaun Mizzrym returned him to drow-form via a polymorph spell.\n* Zanhoriloch, a dwarven settlement on an island and the name of the aboleth colony."
