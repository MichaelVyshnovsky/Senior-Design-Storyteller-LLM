The '''Feather Falls''' was a waterfall on the eastern edge of [[Featherdale]], a natural landmark that indicated the border between that dale and [[Scardale]]. It carried the rushing water from the [[River Ashaba]] down into the deep gorge known as the [[the Scar]].  

There were much speculation circulating in Featherdale about what was behind this cascade of water, hiding in the sheer face of the cliff. There were a secret collection of grottoes known as the [[Temple Beneath the Falls]]. Some spoke of this fabled landmark as a tale to share with children, while others regarded it as a mere joke.
