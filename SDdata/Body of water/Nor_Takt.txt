'''Nor Takt''' was a lake in the [[Hordelands]] near [[Khazari]] and [[Ra-Khati]].

==Geography==
This lake was found nestled within the foothills of [[Katakoro Shan]]. Given its location, it was likely that Nor Takt began as a collecting pool from both glacial runoff from the [[Katakoro Glacier]] and over-spill from [[Nor Zanskra]] found to the west.

The [[Takt Muren]] flowed east out of Nor Takt.

==Description==
Nor Takt covered roughly {{SI|900|sq mi|k}}.
