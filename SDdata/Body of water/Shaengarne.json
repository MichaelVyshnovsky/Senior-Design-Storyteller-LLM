        "mainbody": "The Shaengarne was a river that flowed from Maer Dualdon in Icewind Dale to the Sea of Moving Ice.\nThe city of Bremen was located at the river source at the outflow of the lake. The city of Ironmaster was located at the rivers mouth when it met the sea.\nOver 60 scoop-tunnels and viaducts, constructed by the dwarves of ironmaster, siphoned off the rivers water for use by the city. There was also a series of elaborate spill basins and diversions constructed by the dwarves in order to ensure that the river would not cause flooding during the spring runoff.\nThe inhabitants of ironmaster were often known to engage in spearfishing along the Shaengarne river."
