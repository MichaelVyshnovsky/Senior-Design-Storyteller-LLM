The Volomir River was a small waterway found in the far eastern corner of Calimshan.
The river flowed through the Spider Swamp. It originated on the northern end of the swamp near the edge of the Forest of Mir and flowed south for approximately  until it reached the coast and the Shining Sea.
The ruins of Lost Ajhuutal were found just off the eastern bank near the rivers source.
