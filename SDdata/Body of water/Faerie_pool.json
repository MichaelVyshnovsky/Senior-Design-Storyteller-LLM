        "mainbody": "he Faerie pools were small pools of water tainted with an odd mineral in the rocks, located across the Sword Lands, Laerakond.\nThe pools produced gases that cause an \"air frost\" (snowflakes) that, if inhaled, caused brief but vivid hallucinations. Sages believed those gases were product of a mineral infected with the Spellplague. People with strong will could control those hallucinations and a few ones knew how to use that gas to divine the future.\nCommon people believed the Faerie pools were portals to the Feywild, and that fickle fey produced the hallucinations, hence the name of the pools.\nThe Faerie pools began to appear in Laerakond after the Spellplague."
