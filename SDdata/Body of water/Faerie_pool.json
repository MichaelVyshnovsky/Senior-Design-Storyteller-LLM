        "Description": "The pools produced gases that cause an \"air frost\" (snowflakes) that, if inhaled, caused brief but vivid hallucinations. Sages believed those gases were product of a mineral infected with the [[Spellplague]]. People with strong will could control those hallucinations and a few ones knew how to use that gas to divine the future.\n\nCommon people believed the Faerie pools were [[portal]]s to the [[Feywild]], and that fickle [[fey]] produced the hallucinations, hence the name of the pools.",
        "History": "The Faerie pools began to appear in Laerakond after the Spellplague."
