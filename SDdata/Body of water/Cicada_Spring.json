        "mainbody": "Cicada Spring, also known as Grasshopper Spring, was one of the sources of fresh drinking water for the inhabits of the Nexal city in Maztica.\nThe lush Cicada Spring began on Mount Popol, where it cascaded down its southwestern slope into a small freshwater pool from where the waters were carried by a roughly eight-mile-long Aqueduct of Axalt towards the reservoir in the Sacred Plaza at the Heart of the True World. The waters of Cicada Spring were freely available to all and were beloved for their sweet and clean taste.\nThe aqueduct that supplied Nexal with freshwater was built during the reign of the Revered Counsellor Axalt, the successor of Chalco. During this time, often thought to be the peak of the empire, the Aqueduct of Axalt was the most impressive accomplishment of the Revered Counsellor of Nexal."
