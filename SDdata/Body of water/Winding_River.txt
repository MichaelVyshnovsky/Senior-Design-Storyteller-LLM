The Winding River was the longest and wildest river of the Old Empires region. It was found in eastern Chessenta until the Untherans were able to recover the northern part of their former nation after the Second Sundering of 1487 DR.
The Winding River was in the Adder Peaks and ran across all of Chessenta and part of Unther until it flowed into the Methmere. The river was dangerous and treacherous, and even expert and veteran sailors thought twice before navigating its waters. 
It was believed that hermits and trolls lived near its riverbanks, although such rumors were never confirmed.
