The '''Heartblood River''' (sometimes written as '''Heart Blood River''' It was also sometimes known as the '''Hartblood River'''.

==Geography==
It found its source on the north face of the [[Star Mounts]] and wound its way east and south through the [[Dire Wood]].

==Description==
The river gained its name from the red tinge its waters took on as they passed the ruined city of [[Karse]] in the Dire Wood. By the time it joined the Delimbiyr, its waters returned to a normal hue.<ref name=P&P-p36>

==Features==
In the [[Shrine of the Undying Heart]], atop a red stone butte in the center of the Dire Wood, there stood an animated stone statue of the Momentary God, [[Karsus]]. From a gaping hole in its chest, a stream of otherworldly red liquid like blood constantly poured forth, ultimately joining the Heartblood River and giving it its color.<ref name=P&P-p36/>

==Powers==
It was said that drinking from the waters when they still flowed red could grant an increase to magical powers, or help stave off adverse magical effects.
