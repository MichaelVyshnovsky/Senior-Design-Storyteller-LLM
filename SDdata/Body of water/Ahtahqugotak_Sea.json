        "mainbody": "The '''Ahtahqugotak Sea''' was a body of water in [[Ibelgrak Valley]] in [[Angalpuk]] on the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Geography": "The Ahtahqugotak Sea was the largest sea in Angalpuk, at almost {{SI|70|mi|k|long=yes}} across at its widest point, but also quite shallow, being only {{SI|75|ft|long=yes}} deep. In winter, it was covered in thick ice, and in spring this broke apart as platform ice. In summer, it was nearly ice-free. Its waters were clear and calm, while it shores were dense with white [[birch]]es and lush [[evergreen]]s, making it possibly the most picturesque sea on the Great Glacier.\n\nIts waters were fertile with game fish, such as [[bloatfish]], [[black burner]]s, and polar [[cod]]. The surrounding area was almost free of predators and hunters, so [[caribou]], [[musk oxen]], and many kinds of birds were abundant.",
        "Legends": "Despite the abundant game animals and fish, many [[Angulutiun]]s avoided the Ahtahqugotak, fearing the fever virus that had spread from the Ibelgrak Valley in [[460 DR|the Year of Scorching Suns, 460 DR]], to kill thousands. However, there was no evidence that the disease lurked in the Ahtahqugotak water or the local wildlife."
