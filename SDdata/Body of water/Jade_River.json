        "Description": "The green waters of the Jade River rushed down the mountainside before leveling out and flowing lazily across the plains of Threskel.\n\nThe river's color originated was caused by both naturally-forming [[algae]] and industrial waste caused by [[duergar|dwarven]] mines in the Riders' mountains.",
        "History": "After the landscape of Threskel changed following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, the Jade River became no more. A massive plateau erupted from the plains, creating a small lake known as the [[Jade Pond]] and a much smaller waterway that share the Jade's mouth at the Bay of Chessenta, known as the ''Barren River''.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|72}}"
