The tributaries joined together near Elbulder and continued to flow northwest for approximately  before emptying into the Vilhon Reach. The river flowed past the Golden Plains and formed some of the border between Sespech and Chondath.\nFort Arran was located on the western bank of the River Arran near the Vilhon Reach. The river was crossed by both the Golden Road and the Old Road."
