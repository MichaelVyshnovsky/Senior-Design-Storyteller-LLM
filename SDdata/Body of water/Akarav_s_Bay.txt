Akaravs Bay was the northernmost bay of Lake Esmel in Amn.
The bay contained Lake Esmels largest concentration of mineral springs, which kept the waters warm and provided health benefits to those bathing within. 
In addition to many springs, Akaravs Bay was fed by the Splendarrllur.
The bay was named after a priest of Waukeen who discovered the springs and founded the first resort to take advantage of the waters,
