The River Pelauvir, also called The River of Ice, was a cold river in the far north of the Moonsea region.
The river arose in the Tortured Land and flowed eastwards across the desolate tundra just below the Great Glacier. The only bridge known to cross the Pelauvir was Marams Span at Frozen Flindyke.
At a point some 50 miles east of Flindyke, the Pelauvir was joined by the Shattersoul River, which drained down from the Great Glacier. The Pelauvir then continued heading eastwards until it reached the northern edge of Mirror Lake in the far northwestern edges of Vaasa.
Ice toads were known to be found in and along the river.
*Some maps included both Mirror Lake and the Beaumaris River, which flowed south out of the Lake and into Vaasa and Damara, as part of the Pelauvir.
