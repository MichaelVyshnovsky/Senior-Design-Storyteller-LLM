The '''River Pelauvir''', also called '''The River of Ice''', was a cold river in the far north of the [[Moonsea]] region.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-14 - Frozen Forest and its Surroundings
}}

== Geography==
The river arose in the [[Tortured Land]] and flowed eastwards across the desolate tundra just below the [[Great Glacier]]. The only bridge known to cross the Pelauvir was Maram's Span at [[Frozen Flindyke]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

At a point some 50 miles east of Flindyke, the Pelauvir was joined by the [[Shattersoul River]], which drained down from the Great Glacier. The Pelauvir then continued heading eastwards until it reached the northern edge of [[Mirror Lake]] in the far northwestern edges of [[Vaasa]].{{Cite  dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}
===Flora & Fauna===
[[Ice toad]]s were known to be found in and along the river.{{Cite polyhedron/81/The Everwinking Eye: As Cold As Bare Fingers|8}}

==Appendix ==
===Notes===

*Some maps included both Mirror Lake and the [[Beaumaris River]], which flowed south out of the Lake and into Vaasa and [[Damara]], as part of the Pelauvir.
