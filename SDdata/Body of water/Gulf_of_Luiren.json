        "mainbody": "The '''Gulf of Luiren''' was a sea created by the destruction and inundation of [[Luiren]] during the events of the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Description": "The Gulf was shallow, with ruins just beneath the waves. The occasional tower broke the surface",
        "Geography": "The Gulf covered nearly all of the land of Luiren save for the southern portion of the [[Lluirwood]] that sat on the eastern shore.",
        "History": "Luiren was submerged beneath the sea in the {{YearlinkName|1386}}, during the chaotic eaely years of the Spellplague.<ref group=\"note\">[[Canon]] sources do not provide a specific year for the creation of the [[Gulf of Luiren]], and state only that it was created during the [[Spellplague]] ([[1385 DR]]–[[1395 DR]]). However, [[Brian R. James]] (one of the authors of the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'') clarified in a [https://archive.ph/DVYFu Tweet] that the event occurred in [[1386 DR]]. As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, it was still known as a “newborn sea”, and the ruins beneath the surface were still largely untouched by treasure hunters. By this time, trade across the Gulf's waters had become vital for places like [[Chavyondat]] and Delzimmer. \n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], the waters receded and revealed the land of Luiren once again.",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the creatures one would normally find in a large body of salt water, the gulf was home to [[sahuagin]], [[Merrow (ogre)|aquatic ogres]] and [[Scrag|trolls]] and the [[ghost]]s of the former [[halfling]] residents of Luiren.\n\nNot all halflings perished in the flooding, however. Many fled (to places like Delzimmer) while others survived and continued to live on secret island settlements until the Gulf drained in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
