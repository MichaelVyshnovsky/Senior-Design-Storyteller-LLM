The '''Sea of Frozen Tears''', also known as the '''Sea of Tears''' or the '''Lake of Tears''', was a lake on the border between [[Alpuk]] and [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Geography==
In the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Sea of Frozen Tears was a long lake, much of which was covered in platform ice. The Sea sat between the southern tip of the [[Surykyk Range]] and the northern face of the [[Lugsaas Chain]] mountains. The [[giant]] kingdom of [[Kultaakarr]] lay to the northwest of the Sea, and the ancient [[titan]] city of [[Baunilorotha]] sat on its northern coast. The ruins of [[Castle Perilous]] lay just to the south through the [[Valley of the White Worm]]. 

The [[Utaak Stream]] flowed east out of the lake, connecting it to the [[Lugalpgotak Sea]] and feeding [[Taak Lake]].

==History==
Prior to the mid–14{{th}} century DR, the Sea of Frozen Tears was almost completely frozen beneath the [[Great Glacier]], but served as the origin of the Utaak Stream. In the following decades, it was most notable for its proximity to [[Castle Perilous]].

Over the course of the 15{{th}} century, as the Great Glacier continued to melt and retreat northward, giants began migrating to the area to reclaim the ancient titan kingdom of Kultaakarr. By the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, they had excavated and refounded the city of Baunilorotha on the Sea's northern coast as their capital.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}
