        "mainbody": "Calathalureenteir was a large forest stream that ran across the Weldaths southeastern part.\nCalathalureenteir began close to the Forest of Tethyrs edge and flowed northwest, past the Swanmays Glade and pouring into the Nebulae Pool â€“ a body of water north of the elven tree city of Suldanessellar.\nCalathalureenteirs namesake was Calathalureene, a human sorceress from the ages long past who lived along the streams shores and was an ally to Weldaths elves. Those traders who visited the Swanmays Glade in order to do business with Suldanessellar, often camped along the stream, away from the elven tree city, allowing the forest dwellers to approach the visitors."
