        "Description": "Calathalureenteir began close to the Forest of Tethyr's edge and flowed northwest, past the [[Swanmay's Glade]] and pouring into the [[Nebulae Pool]] â€“ a body of water north of the [[elven]] tree city of [[Suldanessellar]].\n\nCalathalureenteir's namesake was [[Calathalureene]], a [[human]] [[sorceress]] from the ages long past who lived along the stream's shores and was an ally to Weldath's elves. Those traders who visited the Swanmay's Glade in order to do business with Suldanessellar, often camped along the stream, away from the [[elven]] tree city, allowing the forest dwellers to approach the visitors."
