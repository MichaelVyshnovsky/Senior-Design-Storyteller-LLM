        "mainbody": "The '''Darkflow River''', or simply the '''Darkflow''', was a short river in the [[Vast Swamp]] that formed part of the border between [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] in the east.",
        "Geography": "The source of the Darkflow lay in the heart of the Vast Swamp, being fed by the marsh-water itself, and it flowed south into the [[Lake of Dragons]].\n\nThe regular rains over the Vast Swamp caused the Darkflow to swell and flood the lands beside it.",
        "Description": "The river was wide and flowed only sluggishly. This was a result of sediment, filth, and pollution in the Vast Swamp—the water was not filtered or cleaned as would happen in a natural marsh. As a result, the river-water was foul and stinking.",
        "Fauna": "The river was home to countless dangerous creatures.",
        "Activities": "[[Lizardmen]] dwelling in the Vast Swamp sometimes ventured down the Darkflow to raid villages.",
        "History": "The village of [[Battlerise]], which stood on the west bank of the Darkflow River, was once beset by lizardmen from the river and monsters emerging from the Vast Swamp. Long before the 1360s [[DR]], its population had plummeted.",
