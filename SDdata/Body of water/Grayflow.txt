The Grayflow was a river found in the western end of the Savage Frontier in northwest Faer√ªn.
Emerging from the Graypeak Mountains, it ran northward toward Llorkh, before veering west. It was joined by the river Loagrann south of Orlbar,
Together, the Grayflow and the Loagrann drained the lands of the Greyvale.
