The '''River of Palms''' was a prominent river on the [[Island of Gardens]] within the [[Genie's Turban]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The river originated near the center of the unnamed forest that dominated the interior landscape of much of the island. It flowed west for approximately {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} before bending south to empty into the [[Great Sea]]. The [[Lake of Palms]] formed after this southward bend in the river.
