The River of Palms was a prominent river on the Island of Gardens within the Genies Turban around 1367 DR.
The river originated near the center of the unnamed forest that dominated the interior landscape of much of the island. It flowed west for approximately  before bending south to empty into the Great Sea. The Lake of Palms formed after this southward bend in the river.
