The '''Fireflow''', also called '''Gaping Stream''', was one of the watercourses of the [[Esmelflow]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The water in this stream was icy cold.

==Geography==
This creek began at the [[Gaping Face Cascade]] and served as the western branch of upper [[Khalleshyr]] river.

==History==
The famous [[ranger]] [[Vinnam]] once escaped from a band of [[troll]]s by plunging into this stream. Strangely, the trolls seemed to avoid the water as if it were fire, and so Vinnam named it the Fireflow.
