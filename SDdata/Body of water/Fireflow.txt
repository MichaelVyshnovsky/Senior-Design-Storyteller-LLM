The Fireflow, also called Gaping Stream, was one of the watercourses of the Esmelflow in Amn.
The water in this stream was icy cold.
This creek began at the Gaping Face Cascade and served as the western branch of upper Khalleshyr river.
The famous ranger Vinnam once escaped from a band of trolls by plunging into this stream. Strangely, the trolls seemed to avoid the water as if it were fire, and so Vinnam named it the Fireflow.
