        "Geography": "[[File:Southern damara 1359 DR.jpg|thumb|300px|''The source of the river in Damara.'']]\nThe Great Imphras River flowed south from [[Lake Mogador]] in central Damara, joined with its first major tributary, the [[Sidewinder River]], before leaving Damara, and then in Impiltur it merged with the [[River Icehilt]] and its second major tributary, the [[River Lench]], before emptying into [[Traders Bay]] and the [[Easting Reach]] beyond.",
        "History": "Prior to the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the river had rough sections of dangerous white water that made it ill-suited to all but the most daring or desperate of merchants."
