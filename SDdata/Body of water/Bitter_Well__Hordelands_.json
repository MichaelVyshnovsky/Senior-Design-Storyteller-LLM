        "Description": "Set on a plateau, this nearly abandoned oasis was small and pitiful. Only three buildings, mostly buried by [[sand]], were located at the site, and two of them were abandoned.\n\nWater from the well tasted bitter and salty.\n\nIt was one of several stops along the [[Bitter Well Caravan Route]] before the route was abandoned.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Ma Chung-ying]] was the only permanent resident of Bitter Well Oasis around [[1359 DR]]. He stayed to keep the well clear of sand, and to report on the few actions of the nomad tribes to [[Shou Lung]], in exchange for a stipend of food and wine."
