        "mainbody": "The River Ashan was a short but swift-running river found in the country of Rashemen.\nThe River Ashan raged as rapids for much of its length, rendering it largely unusable by the Rashemaar people.\nThe Ashan originated as an subterranean waterway beneath the Ashenwood forest then sprang above ground within the Running Rocks range. It flowed east by south-east until it opened up into the great Lake Ashane\nThe banks of the Ashan were lined with green trees in the summer, that were later covered in snow and frost during winter."
