        "mainbody": "The '''River Lench''', sometimes considered an eastern twin of the [[Sidewinder River]] and called by the same name, was a seldom-travelled river that served as the clearest boundary between [[Damara]] and [[Impiltur]].",
        "Description": "The Lench flowed gently, at least relative to other rivers in the region. As nothing was imported from upstream in the [[Dunwood]], the river saw little traffic north of [[Lenchford]]. However, it served the vital strategic purpose of being a clear barrier separating Damara and Impiltur, acting as a highly defensible and obvious border between them.",
        "Geography": "The Lench began in the southern peaks of the [[Giantspire Mountains]] and made its way southwest through the [[Rawlinswood]] (later called the Dunwood). It then exited the forest to flow between Impultur on the southern bank and the Damaran [[Barony of Polten]] on the northern bank. It ran through the only major crossing point at Lenchford before joining the [[Great Imphras River]] just north of [[Bluefang Water]].",
        "History": "During the [[Vaasan War]] in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]], Impiltur became increasingly concerned with the evil aspirations of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], although not enough to aid their northern neighbors in the fight against him. With Damara's capitulation to the Witch-King in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Impiltur mustered their armies and readied themselves for a war, but remained confident that the forces of [[Vaasa]] would not be able to invade across the Lench or the Sidewinder."
