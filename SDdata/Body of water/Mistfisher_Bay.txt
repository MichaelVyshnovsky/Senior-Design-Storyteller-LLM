'''Mistfisher Bay''' was the scenic bay on which the city of [[Immersea]] was founded. The bay had many names but its more popular alias was '''Immer Bay'''.

==Description==
The name of Immer Bay came from the river named the [[Immer Stream]] that cascaded from the [[Spring Hill]] and eventually reached the bay of [[Dragonmere]] where Immersea stood. The other name came from the local attraction: the fleet of colorful "Mist Fishers" that sailed into the lake during sunrise and sailed back into the town's harbors at sunset. The natural beauty of the lake made "Mist Fishers" popular among visitors.

==Flora & Fauna==
Mistfisher Bay's waters were filled with freshwater [[eel]]s, [[silverfin]], [[trout]], [[crab]]s, and [[greenback]]s.
