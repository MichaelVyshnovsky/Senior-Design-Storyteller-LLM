The Kunong River was a river lying in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra and a key artery of the kingdom.
The Kunong River began its course in the high hill country in the central western Kuong Kingdom. From there, it flowed through medium-density jungles.
In the north, the Kunong River crossed the border into Tu Lung. Just inside, it joined the Fenghsintzu River near Kichai.Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, the Kunong River has not been labelled on any map of Malatra. However, based on descriptions, it is most likely the river from the central hill country and joining the Fenghsintzu River.
At the source of the river in the hills stood Javuhansa, a trade town at the end of the Kuong Kingdoms trade road to the south.
The river-port town of Denokanburi stood where the Srelanat Road met the Kunong River. Here, gems and precious metals mined around the kingdom were transferred on the river to Ranguri and much official business was done in the midâ€“14 century DR. The Srelanat Road was the main overland route to the river.
Ranguri, the capital city of the Kuong Kingdom, also stood on the Kunong River. During the rainy season, it saw heavy floods and so had a system of canals for drainage and transport.
