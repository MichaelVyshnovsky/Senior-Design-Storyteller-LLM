        "mainbody": "'''Lake Eredruie''' was an exceptionally beautiful pool of water that was technically a large pond rather than a lake. It was the source the [[Glaemril]] river in the area of [[Deepingdale]]. It was sacred to the followers of [[Labelas Enoreth]] and guarded by both the Dalesmen and [[moon elves]] of [[Bristar]] for its supernatural powers.",
        "Description": "The pond was renowned for the healing property of its waters. One vial of gathered water acted as a ''[[potion of healing]]'', as potent as the [[spell]] ''[[cure light wounds]]'', when consumed by an [[elf]] or [[half-elf]]."
