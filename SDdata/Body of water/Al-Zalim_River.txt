Al-Zalim River was the lifeblood of Muluk, the City of Kings, in the Free Cities of North Zakhara.
The river began its short trek to the Great Sea in the peaks of the Furrowed Mountains found southeast of Muluk.
Fertile lands were found along each bank of Al-Zalim, allowing Muluk to grow and prosper as a city.
