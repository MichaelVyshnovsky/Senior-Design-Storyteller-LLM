        "mainbody": "The Amstel River was a major river of eastern Amn that fed Lake Esmel.\nThis river served as a major route for barges from villages south of Eshpurta to Lake Esmel. The banks near the lake were made of the bright red clay of the region, and many villages profited from sales of pottery.\nThe bulk of the rivers waters came from the Khalleshyr and the River Valashar.\nThe river began 40 miles east of Trollford, where the River Valashar was joined by the Khalleshyr. After Trollford, it fused with the River Rimril, soon after the Rimril was itself joined by Trifin Creek at Eshpurta.\nThe river was fast and deep both west and east of Trollford.  It was impossible to ford for 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of the ford. East of the joining of the Khalleshyr, the Valashar was crossable, but the Khalleshyr was not, so one had to travel even further than 75 miles east if the goal was to reach Eshpurta from the south bypassing the ford. As it approached Lake Esmel, the Amstel became passable again.\nThe Amstel once served as the northern border of the kingdom of Valashar.\n* Eshpurta\n* Trollford"
