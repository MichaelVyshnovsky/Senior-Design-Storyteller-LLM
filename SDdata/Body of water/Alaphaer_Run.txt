The '''Alaphaer Run''' was a fast-flowing, supernaturally cold river that found in the [[Moonsea North]] region of [[North Faerûn]]. 

==Description==
For much of its length, the river was iced over extensively enough to support a heavily laden [[sledge]], or even a landing [[dragon]].{{Cite web | author=Greenwood, Ed | authorlink=Ed Greenwood | publisher=Twitter | date=June 2020 | title=News from the EdVerse | url=https://twitter.com/theedverse/status/1272288771350953984?s=21}}

At least some of its unnatural cold came from blessings bestowed on the waters by the goddess [[Auril]], "Alaphaer" being one of her older names. The river was known to run in and out of Auril's extraplanar [[Deep Wilds]] realm several times as it descended from the Mammothbacks of the northern Abbey Mountains and headed for the Frozen Forest.

==Geography==
The river arose and flowed north out of the western [[Abbey Mountains]] into the [[Frozen Forest]], flowing almost right to the step pyramid known as the [[Monument of the Ancients]] before dispersing.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|64}}
