'''Trifin Creek''' was a swiftly flowing small river with steep banks. Its source was near the [[Snakewood]], and it flowed mainly southward until it merged with the [[River Rimril]] and then joined the [[Amstel River]] past [[Eshpurta]].{{Amstel sources}} There were a few places where the current slowed enough to allow fishing.

A bridge at the end of the [[Eshpurta Road]] from [[Athkatla]] crossed the creek providing access to the southwest gate of Eshpurta, being one of the three bridges of the "Three Bridges Way".
