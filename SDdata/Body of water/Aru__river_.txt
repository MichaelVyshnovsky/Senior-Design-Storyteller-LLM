'''Aru''' was a small river on the island of [[Tsukishima]] in [[Wa]]. It supplied the area with fresh water.

In Wa Year 1608 ([[1190 DR]]), the shogun [[Eiko]] gave its name to the [[Aru|town of Aru]] when it was officially recognized by the government of Wa. Furthermore, he decreed the town the capital of the new [[Aru Province]] (cleaved off the existing [[Jasuga Province]]).
