The '''Vasty Drink''' was a large freshwater lake located in northern [[Gnarhelm]] on the island of [[Alaron]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The lake was found in southcentral Gnarhelm along the foot of the [[Fairheight Range]]. The lake was approximately {{SI|20|mi|k|long=yes}} long from north to south. Along with [[Salmon Bay]], the Vasty Drink separated Gnarhelm into eastern and western halves. The lake flowed northward to empty into Salmon Bay via a small unnamed river. The southeastern corner of [[Hardangheight]] bordered the Vasty Drink on its northwest shore.

==Notable Locations==
A [[moonwell]] was located in a small forest along the Vasty Drink's southwest shore.
