        "mainbody": "Swallow Lake was a body of water in the Sword Coast North where residents of Phandalin would sometimes go swimming in the late 15 century DR.\nThe lake lay just south of the Sword Mountains from Phandalin near the western edge of the Crooked Forest. The hamlet of Halfway lay on the lakes eastern shore.\nFollowing the resettlement of Phandalin in the late 15 century DR, it was not unheard of for residents to head to Swallow Lake for a swim. Even the overprotective Sildar Hallwinter would allow his teenage daughter, Alana Hallwinter, to go there unsupervised with her friends Nedd Angelite, Sasha Flint, and Grace Hardstone."
