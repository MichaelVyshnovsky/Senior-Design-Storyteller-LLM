The '''Allegro River''' was a river in the [[High Ice]] region of [[Netheril]].

==Geography==
Located in the frigid High Ice region, the Allegro River fed the [[Nyanza Lake]] to its north.

===Flora & Fauna===
Schools of [[salmon]] were known to live in the river and thus the Allegro River became known as one of the best salmon fishing spots.

The cold river was not often visited by those of the Netherese Empire, as they couldn't stand the freezing temperatures. However, some fishermen specifically went to the Allegro River for its abundance of fish. Approximately half of the fishermen would never return, however, because of [[hypothermia]] and [[frostbite (condition)|frostbite]], as well as [[remorhaz]] and [[bear]] attacks.
