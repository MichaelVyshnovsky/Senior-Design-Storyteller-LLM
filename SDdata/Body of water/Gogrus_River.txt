}}The '''Gogrus River''' was located in northwestern [[Ra-Khati]].

==Geography==
Due to the steep mountainous terrain, the Gogrus River was the only known route that reached the interior of Ra-Khati. The Gogrus originated high in the icy reaches of [[Katakoro Shan]], flowing down into Ra-Khati and [[Cherrapunni Nor]] before ultimately emptying into the vast [[Jumpa River]].

==History==
The Gogrus was sacred to [[pilgrim]]s traveling to the [[Thousand Sacred Sources of the Gaya|Thousand Sacred Sources]] of the [[Gaya]]. The [[Rainbow Trail]] followed the river into the mountains where several hospices were located. The [[Order of the Rainbow Monks]] operated the hospices, offering food and shelter in exchange for donations.
