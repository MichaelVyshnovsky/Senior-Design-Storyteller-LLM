The '''Guthland''' was the land along the eastern shoreline of the [[Thingulph]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The Guthland covered much of eastern Thindol. The [[River Guth]] formed the Guthland's northern boundary.

==History==
The term "Guthland" dated back to an era between [[-1732 DR]] and [[-189 DR]] when a strong population of [[lizardfolk]] forced the [[human]]s of the [[Thinguth]] tribe to evacuate their easternmost holdings.

==Inhabitants==
Though they spread throughout Thindol and [[Samarach]], the Guthland was still the ancestral home of the Thinguth tribe. Hamlets and villages dotted the entire range of the Guthland. [[Delselar]] was by far the largest city. The eastern borders of the Guthland near the [[Hazur Mountains|Hazur]] and [[Guth Mountains]] were heavily fortified with watchtowers.
