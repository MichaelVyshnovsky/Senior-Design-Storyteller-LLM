        "mainbody": "ake Longreach was a closed lake found in the Moonsea North region of North Faer√ªn.\nIt was located in the lowlands east of the Ride, surrounded by three great mountain ranges, the White Peaks, the Dragonspines, and the West Galenas. \nA portion of the Ilinver Trail ran parallel with the lakes southern banks.\nThe lake was fed from three streams that flowed down from the nearby mountains, the Telstang Brook, Naed Creek, and Razacks Tears. Overflow from the lake flowed south by Castle Vathar and emptied out into the Glumpen Swamp in the land of Thar. \nLong before the Era of Upheaval, the great human general Tyranthraxus laid waste to the civilizations of Barze, Horreb, and Vane in the Moonsea North. His body was then consumed in a great conflagration and his spirit escaped his body and claimed the lives of his own soldiers. Tyranthraxus non-corporeal form was captured within a shining vial of water, and sent to the bottom of Lake Longreach."
