        "mainbody": "he Gogrus River was located in northwestern Ra-Khati.\nDue to the steep mountainous terrain, the Gogrus River was the only known route that reached the interior of Ra-Khati. The Gogrus originated high in the icy reaches of Katakoro Shan, flowing down into Ra-Khati and Cherrapunni Nor before ultimately emptying into the vast Jumpa River.\nThe Gogrus was sacred to pilgrims traveling to the Thousand Sacred Sources of the Gaya. The Rainbow Trail followed the river into the mountains where several hospices were located. The Order of the Rainbow Monks operated the hospices, offering food and shelter in exchange for donations."
