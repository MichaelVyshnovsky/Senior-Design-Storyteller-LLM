The '''Narrow Sea''' was the main body of water in the old [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]]. The Narrow sea once stretched across nearly the whole northern edge of Netheril.

==Geography==
Back during the [[Days of Thunder]], the Narrow Seas ran along the eastern slopes of the [[Graypeak Mountains]].

==Inhabitants==
[[Human]]s of Netheril heavily fished the Narrow Sea, as the sea gave the [[Netherese]] most of their food.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-33800}}, the wizards of the [[sarrukh]] empire of [[Isstosseffifil]] rerouted the Narrow Sea so that it flowed from west to east, thereby making it flow into the [[Underdark]] region of [[Phaerlin]] and flood the home of their enemies the [[phaerimm]].

In {{Yearlink|-3859}}, the villages of [[Fenwick]], [[Gers]], [[Gilan]], [[Gustaf]], [[Moran]], [[Nauseef]], and [[Janick]] on the shore of the Narrow Sea combined for mutual protection, forming the [[Alliance of Seventon]], which later became [[Netheril]].

From {{Yearlink|-3419}} to {{Yearlink|-3416}}, the Netherese and the [[dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]] deliberated for three years and established trade routes across the Narrow Sea.

During the [[Mythallar Age]] of Netheril, several ''[[mythallar]]s'' were placed in the Narrow sea to warm the waters in order to curb the effects of the freezing ice.

In {{Yearlink|-339}}, the ''mythallars'' of the Narrow Sea ceased to function.

By the start of [[Dalereckoning]] in [[1 DR]], the Narrow Sea had gone and been replaced by the frozen wastelands of the [[High Ice]]
