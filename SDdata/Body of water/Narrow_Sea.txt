The Narrow Sea was the main body of water in the old Netherese Empire. The Narrow sea once stretched across nearly the whole northern edge of Netheril.
Back during the Days of Thunder, the Narrow Seas ran along the eastern slopes of the Graypeak Mountains.
Humans of Netheril heavily fished the Narrow Sea, as the sea gave the Netherese most of their food.
