To the South, the continent of [[Zakhara]] was enclosed by the '''Crowded Sea''', or '''Bahr Al-Izdiham''' in [[Midani]].

==Geography==
The eastern half of the Crowded Sea was dominated by four major islands: [[Afyal]] and [[Sahu]] in the North (both were also counted as part of the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] region Most of the smaller islands were contained in [[Jazayir al-Sartan]], and the archipelagos of [[Nada al-Hazan]] and the [[Djinni's Claws]], as well as the uncharted [[Steaming Isles]] and [[Islands of the Utter South]].

Between the cities of [[Jumlat]] and [[I'tiraf]], the Crowded Sea narrowed to form the '''Golden Gulf''' that separated the [[League of the Pantheon]] to the east from its ideological counterpart, the [[Pearl Cities]], to the west.<ref>

==History==
This body of water was so named both for the uncounted islands dotting its expanse and the heavy shipping activity fueled by long-distance trade.<ref name="AA-p11><br/>
