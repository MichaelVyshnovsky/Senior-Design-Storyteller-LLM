To the South, the continent of Zakhara was enclosed by the Crowded Sea, or Bahr Al-Izdiham in Midani.
The eastern half of the Crowded Sea was dominated by four major islands Afyal and Sahu in the North (both were also counted as part of the Ruined Kingdoms region Most of the smaller islands were contained in Jazayir al-Sartan, and the archipelagos of Nada al-Hazan and the Djinnis Claws, as well as the uncharted Steaming Isles and Islands of the Utter South.
Between the cities of Jumlat and Itiraf, the Crowded Sea narrowed to form the Golden Gulf that separated the League of the Pantheon to the east from its ideological counterpart, the Pearl Cities, to the west.
This body of water was so named both for the uncounted islands dotting its expanse and the heavy shipping activity fueled by long-distance trade.
