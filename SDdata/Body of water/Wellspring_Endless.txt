The '''Wellspring Endless''' was a legendary pool said to exist somewhere in the [[Forest of Mir]]. By [[1370 DR]], it had still not been discovered, if it had ever existed at all.

==Description==
The pool was said to by a crystal-blue color and was surrounded by a ring of white stones. It was fed by a subterranean spring. The legends said that if one were to drink from the pool, she or he would live forever. Others warned that the "eternal life" granted by the pool left one in a nightmare-filled state of unconsciousness.
