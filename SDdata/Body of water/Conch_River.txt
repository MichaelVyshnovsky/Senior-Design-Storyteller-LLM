The '''Conch River''', or the '''Sky Path River''', was a river of central [[Netheril]] that was a tributary of the [[Watercourse]].

==Geography==
This body of water started in the [[Columns of the Sky]], a mountain range in the middle of Netheril. It then flowed southward, where it was fed by the [[Pommel Estuary]], and continued southwest until it fed the lengthy Watercourse, which itself then emptied into the [[Heip Lake]].

===Flora & Fauna===
The Sky Path River was believed to be sacred by the [[Rengarth]] [[barbarian]]s that named it. These folk believed it to be the lifeblood of the [[deities]] that roamed the nearby mountains.
