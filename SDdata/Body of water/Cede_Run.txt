Cede Run, or the Cede River, was a pure-water river in Netheril that ran into Hidden Lake.
Cede Run was pure and cool, and its waters froze early in the winter but also defrosted at the start of springtime. Although it contained hardly any fish, the water was not toxic or tainted in any way, but simply very pure.
The short river ran from the southern part of the Shinantra Mountains past Trinity and the Hidden Forest until it deposited into Hidden Lake. The source of Cede Run was known as Cede Pool, a holy site of Jannath and a frequent target of pilgrimages.
