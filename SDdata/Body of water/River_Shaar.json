        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "Some [[fish]] could be found swimming through the River Shaar. These were most of the channel variety and bottom feeders, the type of fish that preferred its sluggish currents."
        },
        "Description": "The waters of the River Shaar notably retained the icy cold and crystal clear quality of the Riftlake, going uncontaminated throughout its journey from Riftlake to the Landrise. The river also flowed strongly year round, being one of the few in the Shaar that didn't severely dwindle during the hottest time of the year.",
        "Reputation": "Many of the nomadic tribes that inhabited the Shaar relied upon the river for sustenance. Beneath the surface, [[gold dwarves]] channeled some of the River Shaar's water into their [[Deep Realm]] for the purposes of drinking, sluicing in their mines, and as a means of providing them an easier means of transportation through parts of the Great Bhaerynden. They made a concerted effort not to contaminate its waters with the waste products of their forges, taking great pride in doing so.",
        "History": "Over the years the River Shaar wore away caves it passed through in the Underdark, carving out a tremendous maze-like network.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|435}}, numerous towns that stood along the River Shaar and Lake Lhespen revolted against the puppet rulers that had been installed by the [[Shoon Imperium]] and the imperial garrisons that backed them.<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"date\">In ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' the date for this event is given as [[436 DR]], whilst all subsequent publications list it as 435 DR. At first glance this could be considered a dating error, however, the original source also stated that the towns were \"...free from the Imperium's rule for the next two years\", yet placed the timing of the Seven Burnings Campaign as only one year later. With this is mind, the change of date in ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]'' and ''Shining South'' corrects for this. These colonies were first to defy the rule of distant [[Shoonach]] and ultimately won their freedom, slaughtering their puppet rulers and their soldiers. However, this state of independence would be short lived, as two years later in {{Yearlink|437}} the ruling [[Qysar]] [[Amahl Shoon VII]] sent seventeen troop ships to quell the uprising, thus beginning the [[Seven Burnings Campaign]].<ref>",
