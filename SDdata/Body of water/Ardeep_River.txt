The Ardeep River was a river in the Sword Coast North region, a few miles southeast of Waterdeep, between the River Dessarin and the River Delimbiyr.
The river originated in the Ardeep Forest and flowed westward to the Sea of Swords, where it forked into three branches forming a small delta. The northern branch was considered a continuation of the Ardeep River, while the central branch was a creek known as the Selpir and the southernmost branch was known as the South Ardeep River.
The fortified village of Nightstone was located on a fenced island on the Ardeep River, a few miles south of the Ardeep Forest. The river served as a moat to the village, and the area was rich with trout.
