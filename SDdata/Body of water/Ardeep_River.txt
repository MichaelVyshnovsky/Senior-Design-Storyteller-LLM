The '''Ardeep River''' was a river in the [[Sword Coast North]] region, a few miles southeast of [[Waterdeep]], between the [[River Dessarin]] and the [[River Delimbiyr]].

==Geography==
The river originated in the [[Ardeep Forest]] and flowed westward to the [[Sea of Swords]], where it forked into three branches forming a small delta. The northern branch was considered a continuation of the Ardeep River, while the central branch was a creek known as the [[Selpir]] and the southernmost branch was known as the [[South Ardeep River]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|13}}

==Settlements==
The fortified village of [[Nightstone]] was located on a fenced island on the Ardeep River, a few miles south of the Ardeep Forest. The river served as a moat to the village, and the area was rich with trout.
