The Oasis of Solitude was located on Dihl al-Taif in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Sitting between Zarif and the Al-Malih River, the Oasis of Solitude was one of the last sources of fresh water on the Ghosts Route to Halwa.
Caravans passing through the oasis typically filled any container that would hold water since they faced  of harsh terrain before the next available source of water.
