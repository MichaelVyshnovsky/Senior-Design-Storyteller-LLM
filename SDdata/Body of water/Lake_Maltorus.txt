'''Lake Maltorus''' was a lake found in [[the Ride]], in the cold lands of [[north Faer√ªn]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Geography==
Lake Maltorus lay in the center of the plains situated between the [[White Peaks]] and the [[Dragonspine Mountains]]. It was fed by the waters of [[Stoneshoulder Creek]], that flowed north from the Dragonspines.

A stretch of the [[Rogan's Sprint]] road passed along the northern shore of the lake.
