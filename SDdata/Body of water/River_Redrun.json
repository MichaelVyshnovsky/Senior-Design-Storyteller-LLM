        "Geography": "The River Redrun began in the [[Druarwood]] and flowed southeast past the [[Moonwood]] and the [[Night Trees]] through the [[Moonlands]]. It flowed past [[Citadel Felbarr]] and joined another river from the [[Rauvin Mountains]] to form the [[River Rauvin]] in the [[Sundabar Vale]], north of [[Sundabar]]. The trail between Citadel Felbarr and Sundabar crossed the Redrun outside of Citadel Felbarr.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, the [[Knights in Silver]] of [[Silverymoon]] planned to turn away the armies of [[Many-Arrows]] at the Redrun Ford, which was also known as the Crossing of the Redrun. However, the Knights in Silver found themselves outnumbered 6-to-1 and were slaughtered. The Many-Arrows forces were aided by the magic of [[Ravel Xorlarrin]] and his [[drow]] forces."
