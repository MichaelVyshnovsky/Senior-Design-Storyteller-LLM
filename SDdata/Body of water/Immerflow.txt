The '''Immerflow''' was one of four major rivers in [[Cormyr]] that fed the [[Wyvernwater]].

The large volume of water falling in the [[Thunder Peaks]] was the reason for the river's existence, and the river formed in the [[Twin Peaks of Urlspur]], near the [[Falls of Tumbling Stars]].

[[Noktil]] was one of the few notable settlements along this river, and the tiny village had several waterwheels along the river's banks.
