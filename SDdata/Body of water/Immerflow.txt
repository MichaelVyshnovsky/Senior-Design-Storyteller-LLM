The Immerflow was one of four major rivers in Cormyr that fed the Wyvernwater.
The large volume of water falling in the Thunder Peaks was the reason for the rivers existence, and the river formed in the Twin Peaks of Urlspur, near the Falls of Tumbling Stars.
Noktil was one of the few notable settlements along this river, and the tiny village had several waterwheels along the rivers banks.
