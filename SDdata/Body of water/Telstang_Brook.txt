Telstang Brook was a long stream located in the western region of the Ride on the Moonsea North.
The stream flowed northwest from the West Galena Mountains, west through Vercy Wood, before joining with Razacks Tears and emptying into Lake Longreach.
Telstang Brook crossed both the Ilinvur Trail, and the Way of the Powrie just outside the settlement of Ilinvur.
