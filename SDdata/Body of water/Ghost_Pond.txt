'''Ghost Pond''' was a body of water located near the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] in [[the Vast]].

It was a large but shallow pool situated beside of the [[North Road]], just north of Sevenecho. It was named for the [[ghost]] regularly sighted on or beside its waters by [[1367 DR]]. Called the [[Drowned Lady]], she was said to have been killed by a lover she spurned, likely by drowning her in the pond later named for her.
