Ghost Pond was a body of water located near the hamlet of Sevenecho in the Vast.
It was a large but shallow pool situated beside of the North Road, just north of Sevenecho. It was named for the ghost regularly sighted on or beside its waters by 1367 DR. Called the Drowned Lady, she was said to have been killed by a lover she spurned, likely by drowning her in the pond later named for her.
