The '''Harmun Rapids''' was a section of rapids on the [[River Rauvin]] just south of [[Sundabar]].

==Geography==
The Harmun Rapids was located downriver and out of sight of Sundabar, just before the [[Icespear River|River Icespear]] joined with the River Rauvin.

==Description==
The Harmun Rapids consisted of a score of black rocks rising out of the river that appeared as fangs.

==Travel==
When traveling downstream, the rapids could be avoided by steering a small craft with a pole or using tow-teams or skilled steering for larger craft. When traveling upstream, a tow-team or many strong polers were required to make it past the rapids.
