}}The '''Golden Flow''', (sometimes spelled '''Goldenflow''',) or the '''Tail of Semphar''', was a river located in southern [[Semphar]].

==Geography==
The Golden Flow originated high in the [[Raurin Alta]] and flowed down into Semphar and [[Gbor Nor]], serving as a green belt marking the border between Semphar and the [[Raurin]] desert.

==Description==
Many foolish [[wizards]] wasted time and money attempting to separate the "gold" from the water. The waters of the Golden Flow actually appeared golden in color, thanks mineral deposits from the Raurin Alta. The minerals gave the water a metallic flavor.

Humans found the water to taste bitter. [[Dwarves]] enjoyed the mineral taste of the water. [[Elves]] and other [[fey'ri]] who consumed water from the Golden Flow were wracked with pain and ugly rashes. The Caliph of Semphar often used this water to determine if one of his subjects had elven ancestry.
