'''River Thay''' was a large, sprawling river that served as a major thoroughfare for the movement of goods and people across northern [[Thay]]. It flowed from [[Lake Thaylambar]] atop the [[Thayan Plateau]], served as the border between [[Eltabbar (tharch)|Eltabbar]] and [[Delhumide (tharch)|Delhumide]], flowed down the northern cliff face of the [[First Escarpment]] and into [[Lake Mulsantir]] and the [[Surmarsh]].

==Description==
The river wide and traversable, heavy with ships and vessels trafficking between the tharchs of [[Surthay (tharch)|Surthay]] and Eltabbar.

It was heavily patrolled by Thayan legions, who stood vigilant against unauthorized wayfarers and marauding aquatic creatures such as [[scrag]]s<ref group="note">The [[Spellbound]] campaign guide refers to these creatures as "skrags". and [[lacedon]]s.
