        "mainbody": "he River Gur was a small river found in Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.\nThe River Gur originated in the eastern slopes of the Sanrach Mountains. The river flowed east, curving near Sormarl Pass, and continued east to empty into the Thingulph near Gurdeth.\nBoat traffic on the river was quite heavy before Samarach separated from Thindol. The settlements that rose along the River Gurs banks during this time period later fell into disrepair as commerce waned.\n* Gurdeth\n* Psamma\n* Samagard"
