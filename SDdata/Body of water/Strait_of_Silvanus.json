        "mainbody": "he Strait of Silvanus was a marine passage between the islands of the Eyes of Silvanus.\nThe Strait of Silvanus flowed between the isle of Ilighôn to the west and the islands of Ixinos and Wavecrest to the east. It crossed with both the Paddle Straits south of the isle of Wavecrest, and the Farshore Straits south of Ilighôn. The Strait of Silvanus was the main marine way for ships entering the Vilhon Reach from the Sea of Fallen Stars. Unlike the Paddle Straits, it was smooth and safe sailing."
