        "mainbody": "he Allegro River was a river in the High Ice region of Netheril.\nLocated in the frigid High Ice region, the Allegro River fed the Nyanza Lake to its north.\nSchools of salmon were known to live in the river and thus the Allegro River became known as one of the best salmon fishing spots.\nThe cold river was not often visited by those of the Netherese Empire, as they couldnt stand the freezing temperatures. However, some fishermen specifically went to the Allegro River for its abundance of fish. Approximately half of the fishermen would never return, however, because of hypothermia and frostbite, as well as remorhaz and bear attacks."
