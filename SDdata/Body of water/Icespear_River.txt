The '''Icespear River''' was a river located in the [[Silver Marches]] region of [[Northwest Faerûn]]. It flowed down from the [[Ice Spires]], through the [[Cold Vale]] and the [[Rauvin Mountains]],<ref group="note">The location, span, and even existence of the Icespear River is inconsistent throughout various editions. It is not listed in ''[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]]'' nor the ''[[Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas]]''. The map from ''[[Silver Marches (sourcebook)|Silver Marches]]'' indicates that the river was south of and parallel to the Fork Road. Page 75 of ''[[Storm King's Thunder]]'' shows the Icespear River running around the eastern edge of the Rauvin Mountains, north of the Fork Road.


==Geography==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the river appeared to begin in the [[Nether Mountains]], before turning east to run roughly parallel with the [[Fork Road]], near the town of [[Deadsnows]].

Over century later, around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the source of the river had changed. It flowed along the eastern slopes of the northern Rauvin Mountains, north of the Fork Road.
