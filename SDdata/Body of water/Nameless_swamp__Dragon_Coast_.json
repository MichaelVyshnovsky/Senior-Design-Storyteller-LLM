        "mainbody": "The nameless swamp of the Dragon Coast was the lair of the black dracolich Hethcypressarvil. It was unmarked on maps, never given a unique name, and unknown of by many in the region, including the Cult of the Dragon.\nThe fetid waterways of the diminutive swamp were tangled with a network of tree roots, and were barely navigable by small prop boats.\nThe swamp was located near the Giants Run Mountains, half a days ride by horseback southeast of the Shou Lung embassy, the Ginger Palace.\nOne of the few people that knew of the swamps location was Prince Kao Chou Tang of the Ginger Palace, due to his regular dealings with the dracolich that made his home within. \nIn the , Prince Tang led an ill-fated expedition into the swamp in order to slay the creature colloquially known as Cypress the Black. All of his punts were overturned and destroyed, and his men slain by Cypress and the beasts of his lair, with minimal effort or exertion.\nIn addition to the undead dragon, the swamp was home to a myriad of snakes, alligators, and even a pair of wyverns that were kept as pets by the great wyrm."
