        "mainbody": "The '''nameless swamp''' of the [[Dragon Coast]] was the lair of the [[black dragon|black]] [[dracolich]] [[Hethcypressarvil]]. It was unmarked on [[map]]s, never given a unique name, and unknown of by many in the region, including the [[Cult of the Dragon]].",
        "Description": "The fetid waterways of the diminutive swamp were tangled with a network of tree roots, and were barely navigable by small prop boats.",
        "Geography": "The swamp was located near the [[Giant's Run Mountains]], half a day's ride by [[horse]]back southeast of the [[Shou Lung]] embassy, the [[Ginger Palace]].\n\nOne of the few people that knew of the swamp's location was Prince [[Kao Chou Tang]] of the Ginger Palace, due to his regular dealings with the dracolich that made his home within.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1364}}, Prince Tang led an ill-fated expedition into the swamp in order to slay the creature colloquially known as Cypress the Black. All of his punts were overturned and destroyed, and his men slain by Cypress and the beasts of his lair, with minimal effort or exertion.",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the undead dragon, the swamp was home to a myriad of [[snake]]s, [[alligator]]s, and even a pair of [[wyvern]]s that were kept as pets by the great wyrm."
