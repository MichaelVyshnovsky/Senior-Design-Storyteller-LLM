        "mainbody": "'''Umaylu Lake''' was a lake in the [[Alpuk]] region of the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Geography": "Umaylu Lake was a very shallow lake, with an average depth of only a few feet. The water in the lake was toxic, due to bacteria from rotting organic material and a high amount of minerals that seeped into the lake from cracks on the lake bed. The water was so toxic that even coming into contact with the oder-less water led to poisoning.\n\nScattered throughout the shallow lake were dull-green pingos. The pingos, rising from {{SIrange|10|100|ft}} in height, were composed of frozen water from the lake. Due to this, coming into contact with a pingo also led to poisoning.",
        "Flora & Fauna": "Due to the high toxicity of the lake, no animals lived within the waters and was toxic to all creatures except [[tirichik]]. Tirichik bathed and relaxed in the lake, rolling around so the shallow water covered their entire body. If a tirichik spent more than three hours in the lake, its skin absorbed the toxic water and took on a green tinge. Its skin became poisonous to the touch for the next twenty four hours.",
        "Inhabitants": "While there were no settlements along the lake, the hunters from the nearby village of [[Imajuvisik]] frequented the shores of the lake. They collected the poisonous ice to be used as ammunition for their [[Ulutiun dictionary#G|''garnok'']]."
