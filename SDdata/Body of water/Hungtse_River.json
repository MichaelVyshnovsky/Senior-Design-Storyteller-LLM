        "Geography": "The Hungtse originated in the [[A-Ling Shan]] mountains from glacial runoff from the [[Glacier of the Dragon]]. It flowed west to east, crossing the large expanse of the [[Katakoro Plateau]] and many provinces in [[Shou Lung]] before ultimately emptying into the [[Celestial Sea]] near the metropolis of [[Karatin]]."
