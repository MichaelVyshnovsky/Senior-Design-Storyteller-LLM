        "mainbody": "'''Highstar Lake''' was a body of water located in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] region of the [[Savage Frontier]].<ref group=\"note\">The location of Highstar Lake varies slightly by edition. The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|FRCS3e]] map shows it within the northern area of the [[High Moor]]. The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|FRCG]] map shows it a bit further east, taking up the northeast corner of the moor. The [[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG]] map shows a smaller, unlabeled body of water that is in the same position as the 3e Highstar Lake. It was the subject of a number of tales, legends, mystifying appearances and mysterious disappearances.",
        "Etymology": "This lake was known by many names among [[human]]s and other races, being called \"Daeurimlakh\" by [[dwarves]] and \"Evendim\" by [[elves]], though Highstar was the most commonly used. Most maps of the High Moor region neglected to label the lake with any specific name.",
        "Description": "Highstar was quite famous for its clear, mirror-like surface. It sat in a bowl formed by [[granite]] in the north and west, as well as [[marble]] and [[limestone]] in the south and east. In the western reaches of granite there was a gap that the lake drained out of, forming a waterfall and series of rapids along the granite cliffs that culminated in the [[hark river]], the southernmost tributary of the [[River Shining]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "Animals commonly found in and around the Highstar included [[frog]]s, [[giant catfish]]es, [[leech]]es, and [[toad]]s."
        },
        "History": "Highstar began life as a mere sinkhole in the High Moors plateau.\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a malevolent [[mage]] was spreading poison within the waters of the lake. This devious act killed large populations of its aquatic life.\n\nDuring the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of men from the surrounding area went missing and were believed to have been abducted by Highstar Lake's fabled denizen. They always returned after a few days' time, with pockets full of ancient [[elven]] [[coin]]s.\n\nSimilarly, infants would periodically appear at the shores of the lake. The locals that took these babies in believed they were the offspring of the same being.",
        "Inhabitants": "The source of the lake's enigmatic goings-on was a creature known as the [[lady in the lake|\"lady in the lake\"]]. Not much was known about her, except that she sometimes took a form that resembled a [[nymph]] and other times appeared as a grotesque ichthyic creature. \n\nAn [[amethyst dragon]] by the name of [[Sh'derra D'zeer]] also resided within the lake. In terms of [[undead]], [[wight]]s and [[lacedon]]s were known to be found within the lake.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was said by some that the depths of Highstar Lake contained the ruins of an ancient [[airship]] that once flew over the skies of [[Netheril]].\n\nSome claimed that a [[lich]] dwelled within the alleged ruins of the lake.\n\nAnother legend told of an ancient temple beneath its waters, that was dedicated to some long-lost [[deity]]."
