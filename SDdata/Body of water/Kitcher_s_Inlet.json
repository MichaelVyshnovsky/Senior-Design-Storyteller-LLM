        "mainbody": "itchers Inlet was a shallow bay located on the eastern coast of Chult fed by the River Olung. It was rather unremarkable compared to the other coastal inlets of the region.\nThe bay earned its name from being \"discovered\" by Cormyrean explorer, Ilyber Kitcher. In truth, Kitcher incorrectly navigated his way past the Bay of Chult and reached the eastern side of the peninsula.\nKitchers Inlet granted ships access to the settlements of Port Castigliar and Mezro."
