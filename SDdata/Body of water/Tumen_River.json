        "mainbody": "The Tumen River was a river in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.Like many sites in Koryo, the Tumen River shares a name with a real-world counterpart the Tumen River, which lies on the border between North Korea, Russia, and China.\nBeginning with two tributaries in the Vorkani Mountains, the Tumen River ran between the mountains and the Naktong Moors, and flowing into the Sea of Kozakura near Konang Pen. It formed the border between the Koryoan kingdoms of Silla in the north and Koguryo in the south.\nIn 1357 DR, villages along the Tumen River were being attacked and even destroyed by giant snakes. The villagers grew desperate for aid."
