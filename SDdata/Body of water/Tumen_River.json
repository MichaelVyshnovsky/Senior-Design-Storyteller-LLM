        "Geography": "Beginning with two tributaries in the [[Vorkani Mountains]], the Tumen River ran between the mountains and the [[Naktong Moors]], and flowing into the [[Sea of Kozakura]] near [[Konang Pen]]. It formed the border between the Koryoan kingdoms of [[Silla]] in the north and [[Koguryo]] in the south.",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], villages along the Tumen River were being attacked and even destroyed by [[giant snake]]s. The villagers grew desperate for aid."
