'''Al-Tariq Channel''', also called the '''Passage''', was a strait found in [[North Zakhara]] connecting the [[Sea of Caravans]] and the North Quarter of [[Suq Bay]].

==Geography==
The Passage stretched for over a hundred miles between the two larger bodies of water. Its southern face was shadowed by the steep cliffs of the [[Spine of the Dog]]. Flat grasslands and fertile river basins were found on the northern shore in the foothills of the [[Furrowed Mountains]].

==History==
Al-Tariq served as an important shipping lane, allowing trade between [[Qudra]] and the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free Cities]] with the [[Cities of the Heart]].<ref>
