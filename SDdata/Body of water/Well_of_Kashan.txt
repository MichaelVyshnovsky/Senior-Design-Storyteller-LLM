The Well of Kashan was an enchanted oasis found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, in 1367 DR.
The Well of Kashan was found somewhere within the Genies Anvil of the High Desert near a stone called the Hand of Makti.
The Well was rumored to be extremely deep. Lush gardens and magical groves were said to exist at its bottom.
Amir Bouladin al-Mutajalli stored all of the wealth of the jann of the House of Sihr at the bottom of the well. The special password needed to view the wonders at the bottom of the well was known only by him and his eldest daughter, Jamala.
