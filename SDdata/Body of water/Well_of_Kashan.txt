==Geography==
The Well of Kashan was found somewhere within the [[Genies' Anvil]] of the [[High Desert]] near a stone called the [[Hand of Makti]].

Amir [[Bouladin al-Mutajalli]] stored all of the wealth of the [[jann]] of the [[House of Sihr]] at the bottom of the well. The special password needed to view the wonders at the bottom of the well was known only by him and his eldest daughter, [[Jamala al-Mutajalli|Jamala]].
