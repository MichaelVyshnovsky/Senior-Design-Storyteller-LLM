Lake Ashane, also known as the Lake of Tears, was a large, glacial lake that formed the western border of Rashemen.
The lake was surrounded by mountains covered in dense pine forests and deciduous trees bordering those forests. The overall smell in the vicinity of the lake was that of red juniper berries.
The lake was home to many aquatic creatures, including nixies and nereids. Wearing clothing in the water was seen as an offense to the water spirits.

Lake Ashane was located on the eastern borders of Narfell and Ashanath, and it was the western border of Rashemen. The lake was somewhat boomerang-shaped and cradled around Immil Vale and Ashenwood. The lake was fed from glaciers in the Icerim Mountains far to the north and the Sunrise Mountains and Lake Tirulag to the east. The southern part of the lake narrowed before it opened up into Lake Mulsantir, which formed part of the border between Rashemen and Thay.
Notable Rashemi cities on the shores of Lake Ashane included Immilmar in the northeast and Mulsantir in the southeast additionally, the village of Dernovia was near the lake. Kront and Two Stars in Ashanath were also not far from the lake.
Many battles have been fought on the shores of Lake Ashane, thus earning it the nickname of the "Lake of Tears".
