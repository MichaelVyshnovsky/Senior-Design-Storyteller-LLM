        "mainbody": "'''Lake Ashane''', also known as the '''Lake of Tears''', was a large, glacial lake that formed the western border of [[Rashemen]].",
        "Description": "The lake was surrounded by mountains covered in dense pine forests and deciduous trees bordering those forests. The overall smell in the vicinity of the lake was that of red [[juniper berry|juniper berries]].\n\nThe lake was home to many aquatic creatures, including [[nixie]]s and [[nereid]]s. Wearing clothing in the water was seen as an offense to the water spirits.",
        "Geography": "[[File:Rashemen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map of Lake Ashane in [[Rashemen]]]]\nLake Ashane was located on the eastern borders of [[Narfell]] and [[Ashanath]], and it was the western border of [[Rashemen]]. The lake was somewhat boomerang-shaped and cradled around [[Immil Vale]] and [[Ashenwood]]. The lake was fed from glaciers in the [[Icerim Mountains]] far to the north and the [[Sunrise Mountains]] and [[Lake Tirulag]] to the east. The southern part of the lake narrowed before it opened up into [[Lake Mulsantir]], which formed part of the border between Rashemen and [[Thay]].\n\nNotable Rashemi cities on the shores of Lake Ashane included [[Immilmar]] in the northeast and [[Mulsantir]] in the southeast; additionally, the village of [[Dernovia]] was near the lake. [[Kront]] and [[Two Stars]] in Ashanath were also not far from the lake.",
        "History": "Many battles have been fought on the shores of Lake Ashane, thus earning it the nickname of the \"Lake of Tears\"."
