'''Kraal Brook''' was a short, swift river in central [[Netheril]] that descended from the [[Lodestar Mountains]].

==Geography==
The river ran from the Lodestar Mountains down to [[Hidden Lake]]. Though only {{SI|20|mile|k|long=yes}} long, it descended {{SI|20000|ft|long=yes}} in that course, and was largely made up of waterfalls, rapids, and other impassable hazards. The city of [[Earsome]] lay near the mouth of the river where it met Hidden Lake.

==History==
Kraal Brook was the site of repeated battles between the [[Netherese]] of Earsome and the [[orc]]s of the nearby [[Hidden Forest]]. Though they felt secure in their military dominance, Earsome was attacked five times during the later years of Netheril by the orcs, starting with the [[Kraal Brook Massacre]] of {{yearlinkConvert|3170|NY}}. The orcs continued attacking until the city was finally destroyed in {{yearlinkConvert|3517|NY}}.
