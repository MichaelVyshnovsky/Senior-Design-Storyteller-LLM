        "Description": "The Starwater carved the land into a [[Eveningstar Gorge|gorge]] just north of the town of [[Eveningstar]], where it cut through the [[Stonecliff]].\n\nThe river was populated by treacherous sandbars, which made it dangerous to those who were not familiar with them.\n\nThe most southerly rapids were in [[Redhand Pool]] in [[Eveningstar]], although boats needed to be fairly narrow to navigate the [[Mouth o' Gargoyles]]."
