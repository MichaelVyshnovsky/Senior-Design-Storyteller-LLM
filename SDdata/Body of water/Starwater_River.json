        "mainbody": "he Starwater River was a river in Cormyr. It flowed south from the Storm Horns mountain range, through the Kings Forest, to the Dragonmere. The city of Marsember was situated on the western bank of the mouth of the river.\nThe Starwater carved the land into a gorge just north of the town of Eveningstar, where it cut through the Stonecliff.\nThe river was populated by treacherous sandbars, which made it dangerous to those who were not familiar with them.\nThe most southerly rapids were in Redhand Pool in Eveningstar, although boats needed to be fairly narrow to navigate the Mouth o Gargoyles."
