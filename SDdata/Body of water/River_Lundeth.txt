The River Lundeth, which was also called the Cascades because of its turbulent flow, was a small river found in northern Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
The river originated in the western Hazur Mountains. It flowed rapidly south through a series of waterfalls to empty into the northern arm of the Thingulph.
The Cascades was home to fossergrims and a few galeb duhr. It was rumored that Hierophant Dezelyna Goldeagle of Chult lived somewhere along the river to ensure the sanctity of the wildlife.
Much of the rivers power was tamed with watermills constructed by the natives of Lundeth located on the rivers mouth. They used the river to power extraordinary machines capable of building up to 100 swords per day.
