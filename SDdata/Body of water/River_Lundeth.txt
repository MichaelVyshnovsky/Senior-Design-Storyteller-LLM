The '''River Lundeth''', which was also called the '''Cascades''' because of its turbulent flow, was a small river found in northern [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The river originated in the western [[Hazur Mountains]]. It flowed rapidly south through a series of waterfalls to empty into the northern arm of the [[Thingulph]].

==Inhabitants==
The Cascades was home to [[fossergrim]]s and a few [[galeb duhr]]. It was rumored that [[Hierophant]] [[Dezelyna Goldeagle]] of [[Chult]] lived somewhere along the river to ensure the sanctity of the wildlife.

==Activities==
Much of the river's power was tamed with watermills constructed by the natives of [[Lundeth]] located on the river's mouth. They used the river to power extraordinary machines capable of building up to 100 [[sword]]s per day.
