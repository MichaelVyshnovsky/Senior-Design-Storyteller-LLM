}}The '''Well of the Cloven Rock''' was a popular well and oasis in [[Anauroch]].

==Geography==
The oasis was located in the [[Hills of Scent]] in [[the Sword]], about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of [[Elah'zad]].

The oasis consisted of a large, crescent-shaped lake, surrounded by many varieties of trees, within a grass-filled, bowl-shaped valley in the hills. The lake was fed by a powerful spring that gushed form from a cleft in a large rock in the center of the meadow. At the end of the meadow, the lake drained into a tiny stream that circled the perimeter of the valley.

A well was also here, from before the spring burst forth.

==Flora and Fauna==
[[Lion]]s roamed the area and lived near the oasis when not hunting in the Hills of Scent.

==Inhabitants==
The oasis and well were popular among the [[Bedine]] tribes. When they encamped here, they always drove away the lions and then posted pairs of guards armed with [[spear]]s, [[bow]]s, and [[sword]]s to keep the tribe safe.
