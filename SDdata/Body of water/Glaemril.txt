The '''Glaemril''', also known as the '''Deeping Stream''', was a small river that ran through [[Deepingdale]]. The river started in the southern spur of the woods of [[Cormanthor]] at [[Lake Eredruie]] and flowed into the [[River Ashaba]], just before the [[Pool of Yeven]].

==Uses==
The town of [[Highmoon]] used the river as its main water source.

==Fishing==
The Glaemril had abundant [[salmon]] that were readily caught, but catching more than one, or not eating a catch, was considered a crime.

==Crossing==
The river could be crossed at a ford just north of Highmoon.

==Notable Locations==
On the tributary of both Glaemril and [[Semberflow]] joining River Ashaba stood an ancient manor, nothing but ruins by the {{YearlinkName|1380}}.
