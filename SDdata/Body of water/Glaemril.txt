The Glaemril, also known as the Deeping Stream, was a small river that ran through Deepingdale. The river started in the southern spur of the woods of Cormanthor at Lake Eredruie and flowed into the River Ashaba, just before the Pool of Yeven.
The town of Highmoon used the river as its main water source.
