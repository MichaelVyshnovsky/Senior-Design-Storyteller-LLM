        "Cosmology": {
            "Great Wheel": "[[File:Styx-3e.jpg|thumb|350px|''The winding course of the Styx through the Lower Planes.'']]\nThe Styx crawled through the uppermost layers of the seven lower planes, as described by the Great Wheel cosmology model: [[Pandemonium]], the [[Abyss]], [[Carceri]], [[Hades]], [[Gehenna]], the [[Nine Hells]], and [[Acheron]].\n\nIts headwaters were located in [[Pandesmos]], the uppermost layer of Pandemonium, as well as several of the river's tributaries. There, its effects were not as powerful as in other planes, so merely touching the water or the spray produced by the plane's intense winds caused no ill effect. While every bit as chaotic and unpredictable as in other planes, the branches of the Styx in Pandemonium were usually shallower.\n\nIn the Abyss, the Styx wound around the [[Plain of Infinite Portals]], the first layer; some channels poured into pits, bringing its waters to several of the deeper layers, while foul water welled up out of other pits to rejoin the Styx. A relatively safe dock could be found in the Pazunian town of [[Broken Reach]]. The river also passed irregularly through the diseased bloody swamps of the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 81: Blood Shallows|Blood Shallows]] forming several disputed islands. In the layer of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 222: Shedaklah|Shedaklah]], the Styx formed the border between the regions under control of [[Zuggtmoy]] and [[Juiblex]]. The layer of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 274: Durao|Durao]] was the main embarkation point for demons departing to fight in the [[Blood War]]. From Pazunia, a branch of the river led to [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 570: Shendilavri|Shendilavri]]. It also flowed into [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 597: Goranthis|Goranthis]] through a massive waterfall.\n\nIn [[Orthrys]] in Carceri, the river mingled with the canals and bogs and soaked the ground with its magic. Unlike in other planes, [[merrenoloth]]s asked for a much lower price to ferry passengers into Carceri, but charged an exorbitant fee of 5000 [[gp]] to ferry a passenger out of the prison layer.\n\nIn the [[Oinos]] layer of Hades, the banks of the Styx were a raging battleground of the Blood War. As it crossed the wasteland, the river came within sight of [[Khin-Oin]]. The residence of [[Iggwilv]] was located next to the river.\n\nThe Styx was the greatest river of the [[Khalas]] layer of Gehenna, rushing through canyons and gorges at shocking speed and over enormous waterfalls. It was incredibly dangerous to sail here.\n\n[[File:Avernus_map-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Approximate course of the Styx through a region of Avernus.'']]\nIn Baator, streams of blood from the unending battles swelled the Styx in the first layer of [[Avernus]]. Tributaries and branches beyond count trickled through all the lower layers as well, but the main course of the Styx connected to the fifth level of [[Stygia]], where it cut a channel through the great frozen sea. It was the only open water there, but was choked with icebergs and filled with [[sahuagin]] and [[fiendish]] [[shark]]s that attacked the boats. A little-known offshoot ran through the trenches of the ninth later, [[Nessus]], into a pool known as the [[Forgotten Lake]]. However, it was unknown how to get here, and some said the branch did not exist at all.\n\nIn [[Avalas]], the top layer of Acheron, the Styx would emerge from a crater on one cube, run for miles, drain down into another crater, and reappear on a different cube entirely. Sometimes, it changed course and drowned whole cities, taking with it memories and lives. In other places, the river flowed through one cube's face only to plummet into another in massive―and deadly―waterfalls.\n\n[[File:Wreychtmirk-2e.jpg|thumb|250px|''Styx destinations from Wreychtmirk.'']]\nClose to its entry point into Avalas, the Styx completely engulfed the cube [[Reizmis]] in a waterfall, casing its material to rust and absorb some of its memory-stealing properties. The [[Doomguard]] held a mining facility deep within Reizmis, where they used the metal to forge ''[[consumptive burst]]'' weapons infused with [[negative energy]].\n\nOne particular cube in Avalas allowed for unusual predictability in the river's course. The Styx ran perfectly uniformly on all six sides of the cube of [[Wreychtmirk]], and flowed from each of those sides into a specific Lower Plane. Each face of Wreychtmirk assumed the characteristics of the destination plane, so a passenger always knew where to end up when embarking from any of the cube's faces.\n\nThe ice of [[Ocanthus]] in Acheron was the final destination of the Styx. It was believed that all the lost memories claimed by the river remained there, trapped in the ice, while some theorized that the icy layer was actually the river's source.\n\nVortices in the river linked to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].<ref> The Styx did not extend into the [[Astral Plane]], but [[portal]]s existed along its banks.",
            "World Tree": "According to the World Tree cosmology model, the Styx was referred to as the River of Blood.\n\nThe source of the River of Blood was thought to lie somewhere in the [[Abyss]]. The river ran strongest through the Abyss, [[Blood Rift]], and the [[Nine Hells]]. It also wound its way through the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]], [[Clangor]], [[Fury's Heart]], [[Hammergrim]], and [[Nishrek]], and ultimately poured out into the [[Fated Depths]]. The only fiendish planes not connected by the River of Blood were the [[Supreme Throne]] and the [[Demonweb Pits]].",
            "World Axis": "In the [[World Axis cosmology]] model, predominant between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]], the River of Blood/Styx flowed through the [[Abyss]] and the [[Nine Hells]] before dumping its pollution into the [[Astral Sea]]."

        "Geography": {
            "Powers": "Despite its uninviting appearance, the water of the River Styx was still a temptation to thirsty travelers in the Lower Planes. However, just a touch or taste of the water was enough to inflict complete amnesia and an effect similar to a ''[[feeblemind]]'' [[spell]] upon a drinker unable to resist it. Even those who did withstand it still lost all short-term memory of the previous eight hours.\n\nBlessings provided by [[Sekolah]] could render [[sahuagin]] temporarily immune to the deleterious  effects of the Styx.\n\nThe waters of the Styx also had the power to temporarily erase the content from the pages of the ''[[Book of Exalted Deeds]]'', rendering its magic inert for up to a century.\n\nLost memories could be restored by powerful spells such as ''[[heal]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[miracle]]'', and ''[[wish]]''."

        "Rumors & Legends": "The origins of the Styx were a mystery. It was rumored that its true source lay at [[Winter's Hall]], where a mix of melting snow, divine [[poison]], and the blood of a tortured [[deity]] flowed into Pandemonium and became progressively infused with the plane's [[evil]].\n\nThe silt at the bottom of the Styx was rumored to contain the memories of all the souls who had lost their identities to the river. The [[shadar-kai (elf)|shadar-kai]] were always interested in obtaining the material from adventurers, who sometimes sought to collect vials of the sediment in order to offer it to the [[Raven Queen]] in exchange for a boon or divine favor.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Styx-dragon-3e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Styx dragons infested the full length of the river.'']]\nThe shallow headwaters of the Styx were inhabited by large versions of freshwater wildlife, such as [[quipper]]s, [[catfish]], [[eel]]s, [[lamprey]]s, [[snail]]s, and [[crustacean]]s. and [[stygian linnorm]]s.{{Cite dungeon/149/Enemies of My Enemy|84-85}}\n\nTravelers were advised to use the boatman [[Charon]] or his servants, the merrenoloths, to navigate the river. They charged a fee of 100 [[gp]] in advance per passenger and never carried cargo. Despite being the most reliable navigators of the river, they were known to sometimes lead their passengers to traps laid out by a third paying party. It was advisable to increase the payment to a merrenoloth to avoid such an inconvenience. Baatezu often employed [[osyluth]]s as boatmen.\n\nIn addition to these fiends, some [[petitioner]]s and, more rarely, mortals worked as ferrymen and ferrywomen. When traversed by competent navigators, any point along the banks of the Styx could be reached within a day.\n\n[[File:Yugoloths by the Styx.jpg|thumb|300px|''Three [[yugoloth]]s on the Styx.'']]\nIf nonnatives attempted to circumvent the river by flying or walking over it, there was a good chance of attracting hydroloths or amnizus.\n\nThe Styx was frequently visited by [[Gorellik]], who periodically drank of its waters to forget his past defeat at the hands of [[Yeenoghu]]."
