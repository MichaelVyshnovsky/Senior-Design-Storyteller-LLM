        "mainbody": "The '''Arkhen Falls''' were the largest and most beautiful waterfall in all of the [[Dalelands]]. It was formed by a spring shooting out from [[Mount Thalagbror]], cascading down the southern face of the northern ridge of the [[Thunder Peaks]]. The rushing waters emptied out into the gorge of the [[Arkhen Vale]] and formed the [[River Arkhen]].\n\nThere was a legend that [[pegasi]] would flutter around the falls.\n\nThe rocky cliffs behind the falls were rich with valuable minerals such as [[copper]] and [[gem stones]]."
