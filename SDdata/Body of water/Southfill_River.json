This began an eight-hundred-year period of war and skirmishes between the humans and ogres, culminating in the appearance of the ogre mage Storm. The north shore of the river was the site of the final great battle between a team of Netherese arcanists and Storm in , and though it was unclear if Storm was slain, he and his ogres never returned."
