        "Geography": "The river originated in the southern Lodestar Mountains near [[Hatchet Mountain]], wound across the plains, passed [[Canlespiere]] and through the [[Hidden Forest]] until it flowed into Hidden Lake.",
        "History": "The fertile lands along the river were home to the [[ogre]]s of [[Chanth]], who were assaulted and overtaken by expansionist [[Netherese]] settlers in {{yearlinkConvert|1004|NY}}. This began an eight-hundred-year period of war and skirmishes between the [[human]]s and ogres, culminating in the appearance of the [[ogre mage]] [[Storm (ogre mage)|Storm]]. The north shore of the river was the site of the final great battle between a team of Netherese [[arcanist]]s and Storm in {{yearlinkConvert|1810|NY}}, and though it was unclear if Storm was slain, he and his ogres never returned."
