        "mainbody": "Lake Drooud was the surface-dweller name for the aquifer that supplied water to Khôltar in south Faerûn for hundreds of years. The dwarves of the Great Rift also used this water source and called it Thauloch. This geologic feature was lost or altered when the Spellplague caused a region of the Shaar and part of the Great Rift to collapse into the Underchasm in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR.\nLake Drooud was located deep below the surface of the Shaar and the Great Rift, directly below Khôltar and lands to the north and west.\nThis aquifer existed in a geologic strata that was relatively close to a region containing molten rock that gave off poisonous vapors and formed extremely hot salt deposits. Very few beings of the Deep Realm inhabited this area, south of Lake Drooud, because of the hazards.\nTo protect this water supply and prevent unauthorized drilling and mining, the Steel Shields of Eartheart patrolled the surface to the north and west of Khôltar.\nKhôltans used pumps powered by steam to pull water up from Lake Drooud and deposit it into a reservoir in the city. From there, the water was further pumped to the upper floors of most buildings using mule-driven devices.\nThe name Lake Drooud was recorded in ancient texts in the Khôltar archives."
