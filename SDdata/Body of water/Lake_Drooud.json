        "mainbody": "'''Lake Drooud''' was the surface-dweller name for the aquifer that supplied water to [[Khôltar]] in [[south Faerûn]] for hundreds of years. The [[dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]] also used this water source and called it '''Thauloch'''.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|65}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 52 Khôltar, Part 3, Third Impressions}} This geologic feature was lost or altered when the [[Spellplague]] caused a region of the [[Shaar]] and part of the Great Rift to collapse into the [[Underchasm]] in the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]].",
        "Geography": "Lake Drooud was located deep below the surface of the Shaar and the Great Rift, directly below Khôltar and lands to the north and west.",
        "Geology": "This aquifer existed in a geologic strata that was relatively close to a region containing molten rock that gave off poisonous vapors and formed extremely hot salt deposits. Very few beings of the [[Deep Realm]] inhabited this area, south of Lake Drooud, because of the hazards.",
        "Defenses": "To protect this water supply and prevent unauthorized drilling and mining, the [[Steel Shields]] of [[Eartheart]] patrolled the surface to the north and west of Khôltar.",
        "Activity": "Khôltans used pumps powered by steam to pull water up from Lake Drooud and deposit it into a reservoir in the city. From there, the water was further pumped to the upper floors of most buildings using [[mule]]-driven devices.",
        "History": "The name Lake Drooud was recorded in ancient texts in the Khôltar archives."
