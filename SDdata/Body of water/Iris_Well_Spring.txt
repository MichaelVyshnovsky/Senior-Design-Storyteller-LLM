Iris Well Spring was a small oasis and  village located just east of Semphar in the Hordelands.
This area was a dreary place for much of the year, but each spring the dormant dwarf irises bloomed, surrounding the area with beautiful blue flowers.
Atabeg Ali al-Mustasib and his daughter Dura lived on a small farm here.
