'''Iron Bay''', sometimes called '''Iron Keep Bay''', was a small bay located on the northern coast of [[Oman's Isle]] in the kingdom of [[Oman]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Geography==
Iron Bay was found on the north shore of Oman's Isle.

==Description==
The waters of Iron Bay were steel gray in color. The [[Iron Keep]] was located along the bay's eastern shore. Iron Bay was considered the best natural harbor available to the [[northmen]]. High mountains on either side of the bay's mouth shielded the inner portion of the bay from the worst of the storms coming in from the sea.

==History==
The site of Iron Bay used to be occupied by [[Caer Windlauer]], a coastal castle that belonged to [[Omar McDauphin]] and his family. As a result of Omar's paranoid and fearful disposition, sometime before the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]] he used a ''[[ring of three wishes]]'' to obtain complete isolation from [[Toril]] for himself and his belongings, as well as ridding his family of all fears. However, the spell ejected the castle and the surrounding estate into orbit around the [[The sun|Sun]], along with Omar, who was transformed into an immortal [[stone giant]]. The spell also donated all the family's possessions to charity and inserted Omar's family into the [[Dark Moon]], a powerful organization of assassins that operated throughout the Moonshaes.

Once the estate was launched into [[wildspace]], the ocean water filled the space left behind, creating the bay.
