Iron Bay, sometimes called Iron Keep Bay, was a small bay located on the northern coast of Omans Isle in the kingdom of Oman within the Moonshae Isles.
Iron Bay was found on the north shore of Omans Isle.
The waters of Iron Bay were steel gray in color. The Iron Keep was located along the bays eastern shore. Iron Bay was considered the best natural harbor available to the northmen. High mountains on either side of the bays mouth shielded the inner portion of the bay from the worst of the storms coming in from the sea.
The site of Iron Bay used to be occupied by Caer Windlauer, a coastal castle that belonged to Omar McDauphin and his family. As a result of Omars paranoid and fearful disposition, sometime before the midâ€’14 century DR he used a ring of three wishes to obtain complete isolation from Toril for himself and his belongings, as well as ridding his family of all fears. However, the spell ejected the castle and the surrounding estate into orbit around the Sun, along with Omar, who was transformed into an immortal stone giant. The spell also donated all the familys possessions to charity and inserted Omars family into the Dark Moon, a powerful organization of assassins that operated throughout the Moonshaes.
Once the estate was launched into wildspace, the ocean water filled the space left behind, creating the bay.
