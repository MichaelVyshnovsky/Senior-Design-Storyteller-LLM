Talagath measured roughly  long and  wide. There were no man-made structures on the island,\nTalagath was a lush and heavily forested island.\nHistorically, the island was used by smugglers and pirates as a meeting place for making deals and exchanging goods. A number of snakes and other beasts lived on the island.\nTalagath was widely believed to be haunted. Anyone staying on the island could not shake the sinister feeling that they were being observed and items from their gear wound up missing when they woke. Unbeknownst to all, the last Magelord of Mintar, a lich named Sardukh, maintained a hidden lair on Talagath and did not suffer those who overstayed their welcome."
