The '''River Angol''' was a long and swift river found in the [[Greenfields (Old Empires)|Greenfields]] in southern [[Unther]].

==Geography==
The River Angol was formed by a network of streams on the northern [[Unthangol Mountains]] that flowed east across the Greenfields before draining into the [[Alamber Sea]]. Its waters provided sediment for the fertile lands of the Greenfields, but the river was unpredictable in its floods, much like the [[River Alamber]].

The river disappeared after the violent changes in the southern region of Unther, that occurred because of the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]].<ref group="note">As the river is not seen in the official ''4th edition'' maps.
