'''Lake Longreach''' was a closed lake found in the [[Moonsea North]] region of [[North Faerûn]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Geography==
It was located in the lowlands east of [[the Ride]], surrounded by three great mountain ranges, the [[White Peaks]], the [[Dragonspines]], and the [[West Galena Mountains|West Galenas]]. 

A portion of the [[Ilinver Trail]] ran parallel with the lake's southern banks.

===Geographical Features===
The lake was fed from three streams that flowed down from the nearby mountains, the [[Telstang Brook]], [[Naed Creek]],{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} and [[Razack's Tears]]. Overflow from the lake flowed south by [[Castle Vathar]] and emptied out into the [[Glumpen Swamp]] in the land of [[Thar]]. 

==History==
Long before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the great [[human]] general [[Tyranthraxus]] laid waste to the civilizations of [[Barze]], [[Horreb]], and [[Vane]] in the [[Moonsea North]]. His body was then consumed in a great conflagration and his spirit escaped his body and claimed the lives of his own soldiers. Tyranthraxus' non-corporeal form was captured within a shining vial of water, and sent to the bottom of Lake Longreach.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}
