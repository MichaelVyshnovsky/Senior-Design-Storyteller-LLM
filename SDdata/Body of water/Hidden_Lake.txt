'''Hidden Lake''' was a large body of water in ancient [[Netheril]], surrounded by the [[Hidden Forest]], the [[Lodestar Mountains]], and the [[Shinantra Mountains]]. After Netheril fell, it dried up and became the [[salt]] pan known as the [[Shoal of Thirst]]. By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] following the return of [[Thultanthar]], the lake had filled with water again and was known as the [[Shadow Sea]].

==Geography==
Several rivers flowed from the surrounding Shinantra and Lodestar Mountains, through the Hidden Forest and into the lake, with none flowing out. These included the [[Cede Run]], the gentle [[Dahla River]], the cascading [[Kraal Brook]],, the [[Tarn River]], and the meandering [[Southfill River]].

==Inhabitants==
Packs of freshwater [[aquatic troll]]s dwelt in the extensive cave systems on the lake's southeastern shore, attacking anyone who came too close.

The forests were inhabited by several tribes of [[orc]]s, who warred mainly with the [[human]]s and local [[elves]].

[[Pixie]]s and [[sylph]]s in the forests around the lake prevented the [[Netherese]] from taking more wood than they needed to survive.

==History==
The ''[[Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants]]'' recounted that in {{Yearlink|-24500}}, the location of Hidden Lake was once a great mountain that contained the first [[kobold]] nation, [[Darastrixhurthi]]. Beneath the mountain were the [[gem]]s that contained the souls that [[Garl Glittergold]] would use to create the [[gnome]] race. When kobolds began heedlessly mining the gems, Garl collapsed their caverns, transforming the mountain into the lake.

The elves of [[Hoyden]] built their village on the north shore inside the Hidden Forest in {{YearlinkConvert|473|NY}}, and lived in relative isolation throughout the tumultuous events to follow.

The [[Netherese]] settled extensively around around the lake, but their more aggressive deforestation plans were thwarted by the efforts of the native [[fey]]. Over the lengthy period of Netheril's history, the five settlements of [[Canlespiere]] ({{YearlinkConvert|1004|NY}}), [[Arisome]] ({{YearlinkConvert|1137|NY}}), [[Algid]] ({{YearlinkConvert|1222|NY}}), [[Trinity]] ({{YearlinkConvert|1244|NY}}), and [[Dahla River City]] ({{YearlinkConvert|3365|NY}}) were built, though none survived long past the [[Fall of Netheril]].

As recorded in ''[[Triumph Exemplar]]'', a famous battle was fought at nearby [[Humaithira]] pass in {{yearlinkConvert|2298|NY}}, the [[Last Stand at Humaithira]]. After a gruelling fight in the mountains, the [[giant]]s led by [[Blóta]] pressed on to the shore of Hidden Lake, leading to a final battle near [[Trinity]] that defeated the giants.

As the lands of Netheril turned to waste under the assault of the [[phaerimm]]s, the Hidden Lake eventually dried up, becoming the Shoal of Thirst salt pan in the [[Great Sand Sea]].

In [[1372 DR]], with the return of the [[Shadovar]], three [[Princes of Shade]] performed a ritual that created a huge storm above the Shoal, and it refilled the lake, which became known as the [[Shadow Sea]].
