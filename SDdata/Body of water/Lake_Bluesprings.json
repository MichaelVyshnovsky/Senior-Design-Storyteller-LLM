        "mainbody": "ake Bluesprings was one of two lakes on the island of Ilighôn, off the shores of the Vilhon Reach.\nThe lake began in the waters of the Calling River, cascading from the Elder Spires at the heart of Ilighôn. The river ran south and eventually expanded into Lake Bluesprings before forming a river once again and reaching the delta that fed into the Sea of Fallen Stars. Lake Bluesprings and the Calling River separated the islands lush forests into two, the Great Forest to the east, and Grandlore Forest to the west.\nFor the most inhabitants of the city of Sapra on Ilighôn, the shores of Lake Bluesprings were a rarely-crossed border. Beyond, laid untamed wilderness of druid-protected forests. Lake Bluesprings shores also served as a popular getaway of Saprans."
