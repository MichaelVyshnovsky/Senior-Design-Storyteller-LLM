        "Description": "The lake began in the waters of the [[Calling River]], cascading from the [[Elder Spires]] at the heart of Ilighôn. The river ran south and eventually expanded into Lake Bluesprings before forming a river once again and reaching the delta that fed into the Sea of Fallen Stars. Lake Bluesprings and the Calling River separated the island's lush forests into two, the [[Great Forest]] to the east, and [[Grandlore Forest]] to the west.\n\nFor the most inhabitants of the city of [[Sapra]] on Ilighôn, the shores of Lake Bluesprings were a rarely-crossed border. Beyond, laid untamed wilderness of [[druid]]-protected forests. Lake Bluesprings' shores also served as a popular getaway of Saprans."
