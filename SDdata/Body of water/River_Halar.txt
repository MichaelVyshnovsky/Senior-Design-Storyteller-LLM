The '''River Halar''' was a small waterway found in western [[Halruaa]].

==Geography==
The River Halar originated from three unnamed tributaries flowing down from the [[Lhairghal Mountains]], joining within the [[Halar Hills]] to form the larger body of the main river. The river flowed southeast through the hills and emptied into [[Lake Halruaa]] after travelling for several hundred miles.
