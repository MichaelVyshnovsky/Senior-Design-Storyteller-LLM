The River Halar was a small waterway found in western Halruaa.
The River Halar originated from three unnamed tributaries flowing down from the Lhairghal Mountains, joining within the Halar Hills to form the larger body of the main river. The river flowed southeast through the hills and emptied into Lake Halruaa after travelling for several hundred miles.
