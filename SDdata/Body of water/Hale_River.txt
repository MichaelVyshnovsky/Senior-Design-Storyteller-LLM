The Hale River was a waterway in the east of ancient Netheril.
The river was formed by runoff from the Gods Legion Mountains (later known as the Desertsmouth Mountains) and flowed due west through the city of Opus and into the southeastern tip of Basin Lake (later known as the Bowl of Loneliness.
The rivers course was dramatically altered by an earthquake in , resulting in the flooding of a nearby valley that would become Basin Lake.
Numerous farms lined the river during the Silver and Golden Age of Netheril. it was subsequently consumed by the growing Anauroch desert and was long gone by the 14 century DR.
Among those who dwelt along the river during the ancient Empire of Netheril, there was a druid who was ultimately cursed by a Netherese archmage into becoming the first of the aballin.
