The River Lapendrar, also called the River of Sorrows, was a river that, as of 1357 DR, formed the western boundary of Thay, in east Faer√ªn. It was named "River of Sorrows" after the gold miners who died working its banks and the Aglarondan army that died there.
The river originated in the Thaymount mountain range. Amruthar lay on the path of the river, and the city of Escalant was at the mouth of the river, where it flowed into the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Creatures that could be found lurking within the extensive river included eels, giant clams, giant gars, giant snapping turtles, morkoths, octopuses, and water drakes.
Sometime after Szass Tam, the Red Wizards deployed water weirds within the river in an effort to enact control upon the various dangerous creatures that inhabited the river. However, these efforts would ultimately prove unsuccessful.
In 1260 DR, an Aglarondan army led by Halacar invaded Thay, and was defeated by the Red Wizards in the Battle of Lapendrar.
