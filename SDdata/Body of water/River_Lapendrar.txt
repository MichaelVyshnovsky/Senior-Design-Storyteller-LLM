The '''River Lapendrar''', also called the '''River of Sorrows''', was a river that, as of [[1357 DR]], formed the western boundary of [[Thay]], in [[east Faerûn]]. It was named "River of Sorrows" after the [[gold]] miners who died working its banks and the [[Aglarond]]an army that died there.

==Geography==
The river originated in the [[Thaymount]] mountain range. [[Amruthar]] lay on the path of the river, and the city of [[Escalant]] was at the mouth of the river, where it flowed into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].
===Flora & Fauna===
Creatures that could be found lurking within the extensive river included [[eel]]s, [[giant clam]]s, [[giant gar]]s, [[giant snapping turtle]]s, [[morkoth]]s, [[octopuses]], and [[water drake]]s.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-04 - River Lapendrar Fauna}}

==History==
Sometime after [[Szass Tam]], the [[Red Wizards]] deployed [[water weird]]s within the river in an effort to enact control upon the various dangerous creatures that inhabited the river. However, these efforts would ultimately prove unsuccessful.

In [[1260 DR]], an [[Aglarond]]an army led by [[Halacar]] invaded Thay, and was defeated by the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] in the [[Battle of Lapendrar]].
