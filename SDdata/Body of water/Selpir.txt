The '''Selpir''' was a slow and quiet creek that forked from the [[Ardeep River]] and the [[South Ardeep River]].

==Geography==
From source to mouth, the Selpir was surrounded by a marshy region known as the Selpir Marsh, which extended all the way to the coast.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|12}} This region contained several ancient [[Ardeep]] tombs, many of which were submerged by the Selpir and breached by its flow, although a few of the tombs remained intact. {{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep}}

==Inhabitants==
The Selpir Marsh was occasionally visited by groups of [[lizardfolk]], but the region was mostly frequented by congregations of [[merfolk]].
