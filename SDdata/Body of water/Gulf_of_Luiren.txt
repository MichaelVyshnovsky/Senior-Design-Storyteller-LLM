The Gulf of Luiren was a sea created by the destruction and inundation of Luiren during the events of the Spellplague.
The Gulf was shallow, with ruins just beneath the waves. The occasional tower broke the surface
The Gulf covered nearly all of the land of Luiren save for the southern portion of the Lluirwood that sat on the eastern shore. 
Luiren was submerged beneath the sea in the , during the chaotic eaely years of the Spellplague.Canon sources do not provide a specific year for the creation of the Gulf of Luiren, and state only that it was created during the Spellplague (1385 DR–1395 DR). However, Brian R. James (one of the authors of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide) clarified in a [https//archive.ph/DVYFu Tweet] that the event occurred in 1386 DR. As of , it was still known as a “newborn sea”, and the ruins beneath the surface were still largely untouched by treasure hunters. By this time, trade across the Gulfs waters had become vital for places like Chavyondat and Delzimmer. 
After the Second Sundering, the waters receded and revealed the land of Luiren once again.
In addition to the creatures one would normally find in a large body of salt water, the gulf was home to sahuagin, aquatic ogres and trolls and the ghosts of the former halfling residents of Luiren.
Not all halflings perished in the flooding, however. Many fled (to places like Delzimmer) while others survived and continued to live on secret island settlements until the Gulf drained in the late 15 century DR.
