Bitter Well Oasis was a small resting stop located in the southern regions of the Quoya Desert within the Hordelands.
Set on a plateau, this nearly abandoned oasis was small and pitiful. Only three buildings, mostly buried by sand, were located at the site, and two of them were abandoned.
Water from the well tasted bitter and salty.
It was one of several stops along the Bitter Well Caravan Route before the route was abandoned.
Ma Chung-ying was the only permanent resident of Bitter Well Oasis around 1359 DR. He stayed to keep the well clear of sand, and to report on the few actions of the nomad tribes to Shou Lung, in exchange for a stipend of food and wine.
