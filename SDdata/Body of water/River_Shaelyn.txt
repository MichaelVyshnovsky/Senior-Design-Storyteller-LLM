The '''River Shaelyn''' was an important waterway found on the [[elven]] island homeland of [[Evermeet]].

==Geography==
The river originated from the [[Lake of Dreams]] near the center of the island. It branched from the lake's eastern shore, traveling toward the [[Silver Hills]] before joining the larger [[River Ardulith]] just north of [[Leuthilspar]].
