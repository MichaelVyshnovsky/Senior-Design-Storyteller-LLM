'''Dahla River''' was a short river in central [[Netheril]] that descended from the [[Shinantra Mountains]].

==Description==
The river was quite slow and gentle, possessing few monsters and little in the way of fish to catch. It was mainly a source of fresh water for travelers over anything else.

==Geography==
The river flowed down from the Shinantra Mountains down to [[Hidden Lake]], passing under [[Whitewater Bridge]] and beyond [[Dahla River City]].

==History==
The normally placid and unremarkable river suddenly flooded during {{yearlinkConvert|3456|NY}} and almost destroyed Dahla River City, leading to the construction of the unnecessarily large and over-engineered [[Whitewater Bridge]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3465|NY}}.
