        "Description": "The Rauvin was often called the Road Through the Marches. The icy and clear waters of the river were navigable up to the [[River Redrun]] near [[Sundabar]]. Trade-barges and rafts shuttled goods and folks throughout the North and from the [[Sword Coast]] cities. The river was drinkable and fishing was plentiful. There were many [[shalass]], lout, rock eels, river crabs, and turtles living in the river.\n\n[[Orc]]s and [[barbarian]]s shot fire [[arrow]]s at the traders who sailed on the river. Generally, the boats which were sailing upstream were also towed by mules or horses. Bandits and robbers often lied in ambush along the shore.",
        "History": "The river received its name from [[Rauvin (dwarf)|Rauvin]], an ancient [[Dwarf|dwarven]] hero.",
