        "mainbody": "The River Rauvin flowed from the Rauvin Mountains into the River Surbrin and eventually drained into the Dessarin River and out to the Sea of Swords.\nThe Rauvin was often called the Road Through the Marches. The icy and clear waters of the river were navigable up to the River Redrun near Sundabar. Trade-barges and rafts shuttled goods and folks throughout the North and from the Sword Coast cities. The river was drinkable and fishing was plentiful. There were many shalass, lout, rock eels, river crabs, and turtles living in the river.\nOrcs and barbarians shot fire arrows at the traders who sailed on the river. Generally, the boats which were sailing upstream were also towed by mules or horses. Bandits and robbers often lied in ambush along the shore.\nThe river received its name from Rauvin, an ancient dwarven hero.\nthumb|right|350px|Traders on the River Rauvin in a small sailboat.\nSettlements\n Everlund\n A city through which the River Rauvin passed.\n Silverymoon\n The Gem of the North.\n Sundabar\n A city of humans and dwarves on the river.\nValleys\n Dead Orc Pass\n The River Rauvin decended hrough a series of waterfalls beneath this cleft.\n Moon Pass\n Where the River Rauvin cut the Nether Mountains in half."
