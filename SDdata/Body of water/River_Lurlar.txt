The '''River Lurlar''' was a river that may have formed part of the border between [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] that flowed into [[the Neck]] between the [[Dragonmere]] and [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Sembia}}The River Lurlar is described as the border between Cormyr and Sembia in some publications, while the [[Darkflow River]] is stated to be the border in others. It is possible that this is an error or retcon, or that the border follows sections of both rivers.
