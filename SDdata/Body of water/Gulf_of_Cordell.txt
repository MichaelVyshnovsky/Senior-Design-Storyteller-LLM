The '''Gulf of Cordell''' was a large body of water that lay east of [[Maztica]] and north of [[Payit]].

==Information==
The Gulf of Cordell was an oceanic gulf the lay just of Payit along Maztica's eastern coast. The bay of the [[Twin Visages]] opened into it, along with the nearby [[Helmsport]]. In the gulf itself were the [[Green Sisters]] (a chain of islands), [[Zilhatec Island]], and [[Maztapan Island]].
