        "Description": "The pool contained clear blue water flecked with gold. The water was contained by a crystalline basin and surrounded by golden sand. The waters reflected the light so brightly that it was hard to gaze upon and the waters flittered golden, distinguishing it from any more ordinary liquid.",
        "Relationships": "Hanali Celanil shared Evergold with several powers of similar outlook: [[Sune]] and [[Sharess]] of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]]; [[Wikipedia:Aphrodite|Aphrodite]] from the [[Greek pantheon|Greek powers]], and [[Freya]] from the [[Norse pantheon]].{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited}}",
        "Powers": "The waters of Evergold had the power to enhance charisma and remove the signs of age for a limited time. A [[philter of love]] created by elven magic was thought to use such water as an ingredient. Hanali Celanil herself could also use Evergold as a giant [[crystal ball]].\n\nSune was known to grant some water of Evergold to her servants for great accomplishments. These gifts were poisonous to all but her priests.\n\nEvergold was also assumed to have the power to destroy the dangerous [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Living Gem]]'', by first showing the item its reflection and then drowning the ''Gem'' completely into the golden waters.<ref>",
        "Cosmography": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Evergold was seen as shifting location, sometimes being with Hanali Celanil in Arvandor; sometimes in Sune's quarter of [[Brightwater]]; in Aphrodite's palace on [[Olympus]], where it appeared in a ceremonial basin; or at still different places, Hanali Celanil always knew its exact location.\n\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]], Evergold was assumed to exist simultaneously in both Arvandor and Brightwater. It also worked as a ''[[portal]]'' between these two places, though it only activated for those associated with the fountain's patron deities.",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]], Evergold was instrumental in saving the goddess Sharess: When [[Shar]] tried to kill her avatar form in [[Calimport]], Sune arrived on the spot and showered the demigoddess with the golden waters. This gave Sharess back both her beauty of old and enough power to shake off the dark influence of the Mistress of the Night she had fallen under.",
        "In the Realms": "The [[House of Firehair]] in [[Daerlun]] featured a pond called [[Brightwater Pool]]. Its waters, glinting golden in the light, were believed to stem from Evergold by the followers of Sune. The water itself, however, was not magical in nature.<ref>",
        "The Lake of Evergold": "The palace of Hanali Celanil in Arvandor stood in the middle of a lake. This lake was known by the name of Evergold as well.",
        "Evergold River": "Within Arvandor, the Lake of Evergold emptied its waters into the Evergold River. In its course it took up the [[Brandywine River]] and later with some other tributaries formed the [[Silverflow River]].<ref>"
