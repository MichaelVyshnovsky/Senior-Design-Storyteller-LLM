The water was contained by a crystalline basin and surrounded by golden sand. The waters reflected the light so brightly that it was hard to gaze upon and the waters flittered golden, distinguishing it from any more ordinary liquid.\nHanali Celanil shared Evergold with several powers of similar outlook Sune and Sharess of the Faer√ªnian pantheon Aphrodite from the Greek powers, and Freya from the Norse pantheon.\nThe waters of Evergold had the power to enhance charisma and remove the signs of age for a limited time. A philter of love created by elven magic was thought to use such water as an ingredient. Hanali Celanil herself could also use Evergold as a giant crystal ball.\nSune was known to grant some water of Evergold to her servants for great accomplishments. These gifts were poisonous to all but her priests.\nEvergold was also assumed to have the power to destroy the dangerous artifact known as the Living Gem, by first showing the item its reflection and then drowning the Gem completely into the golden waters.\nIn the Great Wheel cosmology, Evergold was seen as shifting location, sometimes being with Hanali Celanil in Arvandor sometimes in Sunes quarter of Brightwater in Aphrodites palace on Olympus, where it appeared in a ceremonial basin or at still different places, Hanali Celanil always knew its exact location.\nIn the World Tree cosmology, Evergold was assumed to exist simultaneously in both Arvandor and Brightwater. It also worked as a portal between these two places, though it only activated for those associated with the fountains patron deities.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, Evergold was instrumental in saving the goddess Sharess When Shar tried to kill her avatar form in Calimport, Sune arrived on the spot and showered the demigoddess with the golden waters. This gave Sharess back both her beauty of old and enough power to shake off the dark influence of the Mistress of the Night she had fallen under.\nThe House of Firehair in Daerlun featured a pond called Brightwater Pool. Its waters, glinting golden in the light, were believed to stem from Evergold by the followers of Sune. The water itself, however, was not magical in nature.\nThe palace of Hanali Celanil in Arvandor stood in the middle of a lake. This lake was known by the name of Evergold as well.\nWithin Arvandor, the Lake of Evergold emptied its waters into the Evergold River. In its course it took up the Brandywine River and later with some other tributaries formed the Silverflow River."
