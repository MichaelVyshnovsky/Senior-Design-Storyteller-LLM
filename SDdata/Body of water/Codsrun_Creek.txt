The Codsrun Creek was a small river found on the island of Gwynneth within the Moonshae Isles.
The river originated from the Shee Pool just north of the Myrloch. It flowed northeast from the lake through the western Winterglen before passing through the Codsbay Mire to reach the Codsbay and the Strait of Oman in northern Gwynneth. An unnamed tributary from the foothills north of the Cambro Mountains joined the Codsrun Creek before it entered the Winterglen.
