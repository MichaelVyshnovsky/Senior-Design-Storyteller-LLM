The '''Swanmay River''' was a prominent river located within the kingdom of [[Callidyrr]] on the island of [[Alaron]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The river originated in far northern Callidyrr in the [[Fairheight Range]] near the border with [[Gnarhelm]]. The river flowed south into the [[Dernall Forest]], winding its way through the wood to exit in the forest's southeast corner where it continued to flow east to empty into the [[Sea of Swords]] between [[Torriage Wood]] and the [[Tearglade]]. In all the Swanmay River stretched for over {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} through Callidyrr.
