        "Geography": "This river ran west from the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]] into [[Tel Badir]], a [[D'tarig]] village whose streets winded along it and were cascaded through by it. It was situated between two large streams and four smaller ones, which also came from the Desertsmouth Mountains. A bit west of Tel Badir, the six streams all coaleseced into one large river, hence the name Sixstreams River.\n\nThe Sixstreams ran out westward from Tel Badir into the desert."
