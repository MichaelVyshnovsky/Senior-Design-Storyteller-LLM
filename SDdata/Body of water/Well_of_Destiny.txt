The Well of Destiny was an enchanted pool of water located in the Weeping Desert of the northern Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara.
Drinking the waters of the Well of Destiny imparted glimpses of ones future.
Ardasir al-Darah the Incomparable, a sheikh of the Jann of the Haunted Lands, drank from the Well and saw a vision of himself ruling the jann as amir.
