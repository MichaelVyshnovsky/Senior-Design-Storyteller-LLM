The '''Strait of Silvanus''' was a marine passage between the islands of the [[Eyes of Silvanus]].

==Geography==
The Strait of Silvanus flowed between the isle of [[Ilighôn]] to the west and the islands of [[Ixinos]] and [[Wavecrest]] to the east. It crossed with both the [[Paddle Straits]] south of the isle of Wavecrest, and the [[Farshore Straits]] south of Ilighôn. The Strait of Silvanus was the main marine way for ships entering the [[Vilhon Reach]] from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Unlike the Paddle Straits, it was smooth and safe sailing.
