'''The Alley''' was a long, winding river of eastern [[Netheril]].

==Etymology==
The name of this river, the Alley, came from a military tactic known as the 'alley attack'. The alley attack was used by [[orc]] combatants in order to conceal their approach. As such, the Alley essentially acted as a shield, where the hidden orcs could spring an assault from one direction, while the majority of their warriors charged from the opposite direction.

==Geography==
The Alley began in the [[Abbey Mountains]] to the east, and flowed westward, where it passed by the [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Jockteleg]] to the south. It then flowed northward, and was fed by [[Escalade Rill]], where it then began to flow to the northwest. After a long stretch, the Alley emptied into the Narrow Sea.
