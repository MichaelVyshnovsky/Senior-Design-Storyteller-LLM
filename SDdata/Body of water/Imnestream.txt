The '''Imnestream''' was a river in western [[Amn]].

==Geography==
The river began in the [[Small Teeth]] near the town of [[Imnescar]] and flowed north into the [[Zehoarast Flood Plain]], where it turned sharply west on its journey to the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Description==
Despite how it was named, the Imnestream was a river, not a stream. Its waters were cold and flowed swiftly, and it had many waterfalls and rapids, making it beautiful but not navigable. At the beginning of the river's journey, it passed through pleasant flower meadows and small clusters of trees. When it reached the floodplains, the waters became muddy, but before that they were clean and pure.

[[Bluefin]] and [[silverback]], two local species of fishes, could be speared or netted from the Imnestream, from pools in its path.

Small cottages could be found along the river, but there were no large farms or manors until the Zehoarast. Because&mdash;unlike with the nearby [[River Specie|Specie]]&mdash;no [[gold]] or [[silver]] had ever been found in the river, there were no mills, nor were there armed guards along its banks.

==History==
The river received its name from Crown Prince [[Imnel Torlath I]], a victorious warrior in the [[Ogre Wars]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Local legends spoke of a [[sorceress]] able to take [[wraithform]] who lived in one of the tiny cottages along the river near its source. She was called the [[Witch of Glavvim]]. Some considered her a "were-watchghost", whatever that was, and she was said to often be in disguise.
