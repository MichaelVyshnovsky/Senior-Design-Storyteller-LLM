The Bay of Balefires was a small inlet found within the Lake of Steam of south Faer√ªn.
The bay sat along the southwestern corner of the Lake of Steam near Talagaths Gauntlet.
The bay was relatively shallow and muddy. Large plumes of smoke rose from the sulphorous waters several times a year courtesy of underwater volcanic activity, giving the bay its name.
The only notable location along the Bay of Balefires was the town of Tulmon.
