A trail ran from the lake to Nonthal.The location of Evenstar Vale is unknown, but Polyhedron #101 says it is \"west of Alaghôn\". By the shared location and name, it is presumed to be around the river and lake. It was surrounded by dense forests. \nIn these forests lived small birds called bloodybeaks. These fed on the mosquitoes that were common around the lake.\nEvenstar Vale was a popular meeting place for lovers on the night of the local Feast of the Moon celebration."
