A trail ran from the lake to Nonthal.The location of Evenstar Vale is unknown, but ''Polyhedron'' #101 says it is \"west of Alaghôn\". By the shared location and name, it is presumed to be around the river and lake. It was surrounded by dense forests.<ref> \n\nIn these forests lived small [[bird]]s called [[bloodybeak]]s. These fed on the [[mosquito]]es that were common around the lake.<ref>",
