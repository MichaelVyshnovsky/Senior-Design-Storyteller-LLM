The Lake of Palms was the only source of standing fresh water on the Island of Gardens within the Genies Turban around 1367 DR.
The Lake of Palms was found in the southwest corner of the Island of Gardens approximately  north of the coast and the Great Sea. This roughly circular lake was fed by the River of Palms which originated toward the center of the island.
