The '''Lake of Palms''' was the only source of standing fresh water on the [[Island of Gardens]] within the [[Genie's Turban]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The Lake of Palms was found in the southwest corner of the Island of Gardens approximately {{SI|15|mi|k|long=yes}} north of the coast and the [[Great Sea]]. This roughly circular lake was fed by the [[River of Palms]] which originated toward the center of the island.
