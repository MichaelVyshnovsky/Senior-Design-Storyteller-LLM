The Jaws, or the Jaws Strait, was a small straight found within the Pirate  Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars.
The Jaws sat just south of Dragonisle in the shadow of the Earthspur, connecting the outer Sea of Fallen Stars in the west with the inner southwest region of the Pirate Isles near the islands of Teltar and Sarr.
