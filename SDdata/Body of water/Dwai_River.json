The rivers that are depicted are likely to be other named rivers.\n\nThe river ran near the coast. South of it, the densest jungle in the whole of Malatra could be found in the wide coastal strip that continued south.\n\nThe Dwai River passed by the Laothan fishing village of [[Jivatsa]], where goods from upriver were sold and [[Seng]] and [[Kuong]] met."
