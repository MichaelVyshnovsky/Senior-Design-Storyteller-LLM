The '''Duathamper''' or '''Elvenflow''' was one of two major rivers running through [[Cormanthor]] (the other was the [[River Ashaba]]).

==Geography==
It ran along the southeastern border of the forest. The river was generally deep (more than 30' (9 m) in most places) and wide, although it did become narrow and shallow enough in places to wade across. It was spanned by three black [[granite]] bridges, constructed by the [[elves]].

Dozens of narrow shallow streams diverged from the river as it ran its course, although these were rarely found on maps, and they often ended in small ponds.

===Flora & Fauna===
The river had a large population of [[bass]], [[catfish]] and [[trout]]. The larger trout could be baited by [[button fungus]], which was often found growing underneath [[birch]] limbs.

===Climate===
Every spring, the heavy rains had a chance of causing the river to flood its banks. Although the flooding was not severe, it would cause hundreds of [[fish]] and [[frog]]s to become stranded in the muddy river banks.
