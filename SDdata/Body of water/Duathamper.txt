The Duathamper or Elvenflow was one of two major rivers running through Cormanthor (the other was the River Ashaba).
It ran along the southeastern border of the forest. The river was generally deep (more than 30 (9 m) in most places) and wide, although it did become narrow and shallow enough in places to wade across. It was spanned by three black granite bridges, constructed by the elves.
Dozens of narrow shallow streams diverged from the river as it ran its course, although these were rarely found on maps, and they often ended in small ponds.
The river had a large population of bass, catfish and trout. The larger trout could be baited by button fungus, which was often found growing underneath birch limbs.
Every spring, the heavy rains had a chance of causing the river to flood its banks. Although the flooding was not severe, it would cause hundreds of fish and frogs to become stranded in the muddy river banks.
