The '''Silver Sea''' was the ancient ocean located off the western coast of the super-continent of [[Merrouroboros]] during the [[Days of Thunder]] and before the [[Tearfall|Sundering]] of [[Abeir-Toril]].

==Notable Locations==
The [[Aearee Enclaves]], from whence the [[Aearee]] [[creator race]] originated, was located in the middle of this sea.
