        "mainbody": "Pigeon Rock Oasis was located in the Hordelands.\nLocated just west of the northern Quoya Desert, this small oasis got its name from the nearby outcropping of rock used to identify it. This rock was home to a great number of pigeons, who had carved a large number of nests into the rough surface over the years.\nThis oasis was seldom used. The lack of shade from the hot sun, the salty water, and the dry air from the desert, all made the oasis a poor stop, and prevented people from building any sort of business nearby.\nKilling the pigeons was considered bad luck.\nCategoryOases\nCategoryLocations in the Hordelands\nCategoryLocations in Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryBodies of water\nbqbmvzrr8q0pizliuzt91hsu7omw72e"
