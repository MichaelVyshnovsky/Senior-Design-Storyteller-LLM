        "Description": "The beach bordering the bay was unique in that it was the only area of coast along the perimeter of the entire island that actually resembled a beach with sand, whereas the trees of the island abutted the shore everywhere else. The sands of the beach were pure white and had a fine texture.",
        "History": "Siiluth was where the elves constructed the majority of their sailing vessels."
