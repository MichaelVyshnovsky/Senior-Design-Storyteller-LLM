        "mainbody": "The Clear Whirl River was the major river of the kingdom of Hartsvale.\nThe river was cold and often full of ice. On an island in the middle of the river was located Castle Hartwick, from which the monarch of Hartsvale ruled.\nThe river began in two separate forks in the hills between the Ice Mountains and the Ice Spires. The eastern fork started at Lake Woe.Lake Woe is not labelled on any map, but its description in Giantcraft, p. 113, places it south of the Ice Spires South, and only one lake on the maps fits that description. Once the forks came together, the river flowed north through Hartsvale. Wyrm River was one of its tributaries."
