The Redrun was a stream located in the Ten Towns region of Icewind Dale. It drained water from Lac Dinneshere and carried over to Redwaters lake.
It was a common destination for fishermen who preferred to stay off boats.

In the , two fishermen traveling along the Redrun disappeared within the span of two tendays.
