}}The '''River of the Dawn''' lay between the lands of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Thay]]. Both nations claimed this waterway as their own, and combat between the forces of both sides erupted on occasion.

==Geography==
Though both bordering nations claimed land on the opposite shore of the River of the Dawn, this rapid-flowing waterway followed what is generally accepted as the boundary between Mulhorand and Thay. The river's waters were crossed at only a single point, a bridge constructed as part of the great eastern trading road.

==Inhabitants==
A single Thayan outpost served to cement the nation's claim on the lands surrounding the River of the Dawn, while military patrols in the region provided a similar claim for Mulhorand. In addition, merchants could often be found traveling along the eastern trading road.
