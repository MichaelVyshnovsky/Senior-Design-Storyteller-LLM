        "mainbody": "The Tun River was an expansive waterway that passed through western regions of Cormyr and the Dragon Coast, in the Eastern Heartlands of Faer√ªn.\nGreat storms coming down from the Storm Horns wracked the lands along the length of the Tun River, causing it to experience regular flooding.\nThe Tun River originated in the Farsea Marshes, that along with the Tun Marshes later became the Farsea Swamp, flowed south through the Tunlands before emptying into the Dragonmere, at the formation of the Gritstone Moorlands.\nThe valley around the Tun River was unsuitable for farmland and was regularly flooded when the water level rose.\nThe waters of the Tun were known as the home to a variety of aquatic animals including frogs, toads, eels, and even crocodiles.\nMaxor plants could be found along banks of the river south of the Storm Horns, a fern-like plant from which the substance maxoris was derived.\nAt some point between the catastrophic Spellplague that in the  and the late 15 century DR, the stretch of the Tun River between the Farsea Marshes and the Tun Marshes was swallowed up by the expansive Farsea Swamp that formed out of the two smaller wetlands."
