The Clearflow River was located in the Hordelands near the Lake of Mists.
The Clearflow River flowed south from the Lake of Mists across the Great Amber Steppes until it connected with the River Murghol.
The western bank of the Clearflow River was considered by many to be the edge of civilized lands before the vast expanse of the barbarian Hordelands.
The threat of the nomadic barbarians, as well as possible reprisals from neighboring nations in reaction to the defenses that would be needed to defend the river, kept farming and development along the Clearflow River to a minimum.
