        "mainbody": "The Bay of Taertal was a bay located in southwest Halruaa along the Great Sea.\nThe Bay of Taertal offered natural protection for cities and towns dotting the southwest coast of Halruaa. The presence of Halruaas naval base on Rulasuu dissuaded many would-be pirates from attacking settlements found along the Bay of Taertal.\nThe Bay of Taertal was lined with a huge population of date palms. The palm wood was gathered, enchanted, and used for construction of Halruaan skyships.\n* Khaerbaal\n* Rulasuu"
