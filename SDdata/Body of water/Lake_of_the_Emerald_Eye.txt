The Lake of the Emerald Eye was located in the Land of the Yak-Men within the dominating heights of the World Pillar Mountains in northeast Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The lake was found within the Red Goat province near the heart of the Yikarian Empire. Due to the extreme elevation, the water of the lake was ice-cold.
The Lake of the Emerald Eye was a site favored for performing water sacrifices to the Faceless God of the yak-folk.
