        "Description": "The presence of a mud-brick [[caravanserai]] large enough for a small army made this oasis extremely convenient.\n\nEnlightened travelers could worship the [[Zakharan pantheon|Zakharan gods]] at the Jamal temple. Though blasted by the sands of time, one carved phrase could still be read: \"''How can any man born of earth claim to divine true purposes of the gods?''\"  [[Djinn]] would sometimes appear on the darkest summer nights to debate the meaning of this phrase. Any human who brought fresh [[apple]]s for the djinn was allowed to join the debate. There was a chance that those with perceptive insights into the debate would be granted a ''[[genie wish|wish]]'', while those with blunt observations were slapped.",
        "Ecology": "The Jamal Oasis had waters so clear that travelers could count the pebbles on the bottom of the pool. ''[[Baitan-jan]]'', a leafy [[eggplant]], also grew here in abundance, providing an ample food source. Pack animals also feasted on the primrose-covered hills to the north of the oasis.",
