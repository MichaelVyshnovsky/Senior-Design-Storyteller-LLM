'''Redwaters''', also known as '''Dellon-lune''', 

The lake was peaceful and breathtakingly beautiful. Named for a famous battle as opposed to the color of its waters, the lake actually ranged in hue from dazzling green in the morn to twinkling silver at night.

==Geography==
Redwaters was located on the southern stretch of Icewind Dale.

==History==
{{Quote|''Ever wondered why the lake’s called Redwaters? It’s drunk the blood of our fathers, and their fathers before them. Those wretches from [[Dougan's Hole]] have been warring with us ever since we got here.''|[[Mord]], resident of [[Good Mead]].{{Cite dungeon/220/King of the Wolves|34}}}}

The lake's original name was ''Dellon-lune'', but it was renamed after a fight between rival fishing boats left bloody corpses in the water, hence 'Redwaters.'

Around the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, [[Regis]], [[Companions of the Hall|Companion of the Hall]], witnessed a small skirmish between fishing boats over fishing rights, where one [[Human|man]] died.

==Notable locations==
;Settlements:
The shores of the lake were home to the independent settlements of [[Dougan's Hole]] and [[Good Mead]]. Few folks traveled to Redwaters lake, beyond those that hailed from these hamlets.
