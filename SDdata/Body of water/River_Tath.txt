The River Tath was one of the three great rivers of Chult.
The river was in the western region of the jungle and flowed from the Aldani Basin into the Trackless Sea between the Kobold Mountains and the Mistcliffs As it meandered to the west, it carved out the gorge of Ataaz Kahakla.
The aldani lived in this river, as in the other large rivers of Chult.
It was said that if one were to follow the river up past Kahakla gorge, he or she would find a ruined city guarded by a wise and giving naga, but few made it out alive.
