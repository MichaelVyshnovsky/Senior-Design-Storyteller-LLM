The '''Ni-Ko Oasis''', also known as '''Mud Pit Hollow''', was traditionally considered the endpoint of the [[Golden Way]] and the beginning of the [[Spice Road]] as it stretched to the east. The oasis also served as the boundary between the continents of [[Kara-Tur]] and [[Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
Located in the [[Plain of Horses]], the oasis was a boggy forest bordering on a swamp. The brown water was deep enough to graze the bottom of [[horse]] bellies.

==Inhabitants==
The bog was inhabited by [[korobokuru]] who would occasionally trade or share stories with travelers.
