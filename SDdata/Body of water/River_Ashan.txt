The '''River Ashan''' was a short but swift-running river found in the country of [[Rashemen]].{{Template:Cite book/Unapproachable East|129}}

==Description==
The River Ashan raged as rapids for much of its length, rendering it largely unusable by the [[Rashemaar]] people.

==Geography==
The Ashan originated as an subterranean waterway beneath the [[Ashenwood]] forest then sprang above ground within the [[Running Rocks]] range. It flowed east by south-east until it opened up into the great [[Lake Ashane]]

===Flora & Fauna===
The banks of the Ashan were lined with green trees in the summer, that were later covered in snow and frost during winter.
