'''Cicada Spring''', also known as '''Grasshopper Spring''', was one of the sources of fresh drinking water for the inhabits of the [[Nexal]] city in [[Maztica]].

{{quote|'' An [[aqueduct]]. We have plenty of water in [[Nexal]], but this from the Cicada Spring is the sweetest to drink. It runs into the center of the city, where it can be sampled by all.''|[[Poshtli]], an [[Eagle Knights (Maztica)|Eagle Knight]] of Nexal.}}

==Description==
The lush Cicada Spring began on [[Mount Popol]], where it cascaded down its southwestern slope into a small freshwater pool from where the waters were carried by a roughly eight-mile-long [[Aqueduct of Axalt]] towards the reservoir in the [[Sacred Plaza]] at the [[Heart of the True World]]. The waters of Cicada Spring were freely available to all and were beloved for their sweet and clean taste.

==History==
The aqueduct that supplied Nexal with freshwater was built during the reign of the [[Revered Counsellor]] [[Axalt]], the successor of [[Chalco]]. During this time, often thought to be the peak of the empire, the Aqueduct of Axalt was the most impressive accomplishment of the Revered Counsellor of Nexal.
