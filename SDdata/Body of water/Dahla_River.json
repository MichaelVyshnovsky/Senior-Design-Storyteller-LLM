        "Description": "The river was quite slow and gentle, possessing few monsters and little in the way of fish to catch. It was mainly a source of fresh water for travelers over anything else.",
        "Geography": "The river flowed down from the Shinantra Mountains down to [[Hidden Lake]], passing under [[Whitewater Bridge]] and beyond [[Dahla River City]].",
        "History": "The normally placid and unremarkable river suddenly flooded during {{yearlinkConvert|3456|NY}} and almost destroyed Dahla River City, leading to the construction of the unnecessarily large and over-engineered [[Whitewater Bridge]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3465|NY}}."
