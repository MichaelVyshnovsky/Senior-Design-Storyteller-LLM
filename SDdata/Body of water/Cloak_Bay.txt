'''Cloak Bay''', known as '''Raetheless''' among the [[Fair Folk]], was an elongated bay just to the south of the [[Cloakwood]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Description==
The cliff shores of the Cloak Bay were sparsely populated, encircled by [[Cape Raeth]] to the west and the rocky beaches of the [[Jaws (Sword Coast)|Jaws]] to the east. A smaller bay was connected to Raetheless just behind a diminutive peninsula known as the [[Fang (Sword Coast)|Fang]]. The smaller bay was called [[Borlyth Bay]].

There were six settlements located around the Cloak Bay, but by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they were mostly abandoned because of increased attacks by the creatures of the [[Cloak Wood]] and pirate raids. Despite being sparsely populated, the villages were populated still by some hardy folk. These settlements were [[Orthul's Notch]], [[Calyaun]], [[Eldelorr]], [[Sumbur Rock]], [[Borlyth]], and [[Ausabbason]].
