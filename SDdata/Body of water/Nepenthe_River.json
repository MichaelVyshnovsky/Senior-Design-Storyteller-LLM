        "mainbody": "The Nepenthe River was an underground body of water that flowed beneath a region of the Sword Coast, primarily the High Moor.\nThe source of the river was somewhere in the Misty Forest and was accessible by a cave therein.\nThe waters of the Nepenthe were extremely cold, to the point of nearly freezing. The air was equally cold and noticeably humid.\nAlong the path of the river, the surrounding caves were quite striking. The walls sparkled with veins of valuable minerals and incandescent mushrooms shone in a wide variety of colors.\nDuring the fall of Dragonspear Castle, in the , the mage Ithtaerus Casalia stole a clutch of eggs away from Halatathlaers lair. He hid them away in a cavern on the banks of the Nepenthe.\nIn the , a group of adventurers rafted down the river in order to reach the labyrinth beneath Dragonspear Castle.\nWhen the Shining Crusade took over Dragonspear Castle, around the , they established a supply depot on the banks of the Nepenthe and used it as a means of transporting soldiers and resources. Among them was the mage Strunk of Silverymoon, who was binding the rivers water elementals to his will.\nSometime before the , a group of undead led by Born rose up from the Nepenthe and made their way into Dragonspear.\nThe river passed directly under Dragonspear Castle.\nA number of creatures dwelled within the caves around the river, including sahuagin and ankhegs. The waters were home to a number of water elementals, a nereid, and even a particularly nasty morkoth called Sallissi.\nDuring the midâ€“14 century, the alchemist Bellowgulp Bluefingers and his myconid companion known as the Concoctor regularly traveled along the banks of the Nepenthe, selling their concoctions."
