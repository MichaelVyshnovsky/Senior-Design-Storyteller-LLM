The '''Bay of Taertal''' was a bay located in southwest [[Halruaa]] along the [[Great Sea]].

==Description==
The Bay of Taertal offered natural protection for cities and towns dotting the southwest coast of Halruaa. The presence of Halruaa's naval base on [[Rulasuu]] dissuaded many would-be pirates from attacking settlements found along the Bay of Taertal.

==Flora & Fauna==
The Bay of Taertal was lined with a huge population of [[date palm]]s. The palm wood was gathered, [[enchanted]], and used for construction of ''[[Halruaan skyship]]s.''

==Notable Locations==
* [[Khaerbaal]]
* [[Rulasuu]]
