        "mainbody": "The '''Shining Stream''' was a river in eastern [[Tethyr]] that was the primary tributary of the [[River Ith]].",
        "Geography": "The Shining Stream began in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] and poured into the River Ith. It was fed by [[Swimstar Creek]] near [[Mount Noblesse]].\n\nThough it meandered more than would be expected, it had a strong current. It was deep in most places, but there were several exceptions where it could be forded.\n\nThe river formed the western and northern borders of [[Morninggold|County Morninggold]].",
        "History": "While most of the river was in Tethyrian territory, its headwaters in the Snowflakes were within the barony of [[Carrelath]] in [[Erlkazar]], a garrison of troops from Erlkazar defended them."
