The '''River of Metals''' was a river found in [[Threskel]], a realm that was once considered part of northern [[Unther]].

==Description==
The river was named after its rich deposits of precious metals, especially [[gold]].

==Geography==
The River of Metals flowed from the [[Methmere]] to the [[Alamber Sea]]. The city of [[Messemprar]] was built in its estuary. 

The river disappeared after the violent changes in the northern region of Unther that occurred because of the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]].{{Speculation}}<ref group="note">The river is not seen in the official 4th edition maps.

===Geographic Features===
The lands north of the river were exceptionally well-suited for growing crops.

==History==
Throughout recorded history, the river has played host to two separate gold rushes, each of which were halted due to the greed of young [[chromatic dragon]]s that came down from the [[Riders to the Sky]] mountains to claim the riches for their own.
