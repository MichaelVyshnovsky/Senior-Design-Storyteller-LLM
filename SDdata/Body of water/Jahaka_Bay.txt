'''Jahaka Bay''' was a coastal inlet located along the western side of [[Chult]]. It was fed by the [[River Tath]] that snaked through Chult's western jungles.

==Description==
The bay was much deeper than it was wide, spanning 20 miles (32 kilometers) across and twice that distance inland. It was concealed by mist that poured down from the mouth of the River Tath. 

==Notable Locations==
* [[Jahaka Anchorage]]: This secluded pier-settlement served as a safe haven for a number of pirate crews.
