Jahaka Bay was a coastal inlet located along the western side of Chult. It was fed by the River Tath that snaked through Chults western jungles.
The bay was much deeper than it was wide, spanning 20 miles (32 kilometers) across and twice that distance inland. It was concealed by mist that poured down from the mouth of the River Tath.
