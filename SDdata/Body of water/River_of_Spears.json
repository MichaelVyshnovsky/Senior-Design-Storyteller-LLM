        "Geography": "The River of Spears flowed west from the [[Sword Mountains (Mulhorand)|Sword Mountains]], across the [[Great Vale]], and eventually emptied into the [[Alamber Sea]] at the city of [[Gheldaneth]]. Along with its two tributary flows, the [[Mishtan]] and the [[Klondor]], this river was heavily irrigated for the purpose of farming. Annual flooding in summer enriched the soil of the surrounding regions with valuable nutrients.",
        "Inhabitants": "The River of Spears flowed past the cities of Gheldaneth, [[Ulzel]], and [[Surbroar]]."
