        "mainbody": "he River of Spears provided water to the majority of the farms located in the nation of Mulhorand.\nThe River of Spears flowed west from the Sword Mountains, across the Great Vale, and eventually emptied into the Alamber Sea at the city of Gheldaneth. Along with its two tributary flows, the Mishtan and the Klondor, this river was heavily irrigated for the purpose of farming. Annual flooding in summer enriched the soil of the surrounding regions with valuable nutrients.\nThe River of Spears flowed past the cities of Gheldaneth, Ulzel, and Surbroar."
