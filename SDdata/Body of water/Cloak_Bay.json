        "mainbody": "Cloak Bay, known as Raetheless among the Fair Folk, was an elongated bay just to the south of the Cloakwood on the Sword Coast North.\nThe cliff shores of the Cloak Bay were sparsely populated, encircled by Cape Raeth to the west and the rocky beaches of the Jaws to the east. A smaller bay was connected to Raetheless just behind a diminutive peninsula known as the Fang. The smaller bay was called Borlyth Bay.\nThere were six settlements located around the Cloak Bay, but by the late 14 century DR, they were mostly abandoned because of increased attacks by the creatures of the Cloak Wood and pirate raids. Despite being sparsely populated, the villages were populated still by some hardy folk. These settlements were Orthuls Notch, Calyaun, Eldelorr, Sumbur Rock, Borlyth, and Ausabbason."
