The River Ghaast was a small waterway found Semphar in east Faer√ªn and the Hordelands.
The River Ghaast originated in the western region of the Shalhoond. It was fed by many unnamed tributaries within the forest as well as one reaching through Ejen Horo into the Great Amber Steppes. The river flowed south for several hundred miles before reaching the northern banks of Gbor Nor.
