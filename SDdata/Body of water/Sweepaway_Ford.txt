'''Sweepaway Ford''' was a ford in [[Northknife Pass]], across the [[Dustwall Mountains]].

==Description==
The ford was about {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} wide and several feet deep, near the start of the pass on its [[Bralizzar]] side. Its ice cold waters were very quick, and perilous to cross.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|21}}
