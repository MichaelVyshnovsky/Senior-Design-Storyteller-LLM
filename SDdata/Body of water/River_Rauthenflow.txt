The '''River Rauthenflow''' was a waterway in northern [[Mulhorand]] known for possessing an exceptionally fast current.The bold heading on page 15 of the first edition of [[Old Empires]] reads ''River Rauthengflow'', while the rest of the source spells the river, ''Rauthenflow''. The Rauthenflow connected [[Brightstar Lake|Gbor Nor]] in the [[Hordelands]] with the [[Alamber Sea]].

Due to the high volume of river traffic, pirates were virtually unheard of on the Rauthenflow.
