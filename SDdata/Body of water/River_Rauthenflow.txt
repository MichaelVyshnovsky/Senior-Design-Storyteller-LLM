These falls, located near the mouth of the River Rauthenflow, were considered one of the most spectacular sites in Faerûn.
The area surrounding the River Rauthenflow was inhospitable to most habitation. Despite this, various monsters called this region home. The falls of Rauthgor were known to be frequented by a notable population of mermaids.
The entire length of the river was navigable due to efforts from the ancient empires of Mulhorand and Imaskar. These massive projects added canals around cataracts, fortified the soft banks with stone, and cleared rapids of large rocks.
The Rauthenflow was a vital source of income for Murghôm since they applied a tax to any vessel sailing its waters.
Due to the high volume of river traffic, pirates were virtually unheard of on the Rauthenflow.
