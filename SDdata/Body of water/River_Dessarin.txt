The '''River Dessarin''' was a major river that flowed through the [[Savage Frontier]] in [[Northwest Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
This river was the main route for trade and commerce of this region. It was cold and deep, flowing from the [[Dancing Falls]] at the base of the [[Lost Peaks]] to the [[Sea of Swords]] just south of [[Waterdeep]]. 

==Fishing==
The waters of the Dessarin were home to the [[shalass|silver shalass]], a [[fish]] that was considered a delicacy all across [[the North]].

==Crossing==
The Dessarin had three primary bridges: [[Zundbridge]], south of Waterdeep; the [[Stone Bridge]], farther north and east of [[Red Larch]]; and [[Ironford]]. It also had a ford, usable at certain times of the year&mdash;the [[Dead Horse Ford]] east of [[Yartar]].

==Tributaries==
The Dessarin claimed the [[River Surbrin]], the [[River Rauvin]], and the [[Laughingflow]] as its tributaries, also claiming many smaller rivers and streams flowing from a multitude of places, such as [[Lurkwood]] and the [[Evermoors]] to the north, and the [[High Forest]] to the east.
