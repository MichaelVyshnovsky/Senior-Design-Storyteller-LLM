The River Dessarin was a major river that flowed through the Savage Frontier in Northwest Faer√ªn.
This river was the main route for trade and commerce of this region. It was cold and deep, flowing from the Dancing Falls at the base of the Lost Peaks to the Sea of Swords just south of Waterdeep. 
The waters of the Dessarin were home to the silver shalass, a fish that was considered a delicacy all across the North.
The Dessarin had three primary bridges Zundbridge, south of Waterdeep the Stone Bridge, farther north and east of Red Larch and Ironford. It also had a ford, usable at certain times of the year&mdashthe Dead Horse Ford east of Yartar.
The Dessarin claimed the River Surbrin, the River Rauvin, and the Laughingflow as its tributaries, also claiming many smaller rivers and streams flowing from a multitude of places, such as Lurkwood and the Evermoors to the north, and the High Forest to the east.
