The '''River Esmel''' was a major river located in [[Amn]]. It was one of four rivers that connected [[Amn]] to the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Description==
Esmel River was a peaceful and wide river that drained [[Lake Esmel]] at [[Esmeltaran]] and flowed west to the Sea of Swords. At its source, the waters were warm from the hot springs of the lake, but after a mile, they cooled to normal temperatures, though they still maintained their "chalklike", "irontang" sulfur taste for a good distance from the lake.

The Emsel River was full of barges, even more so than the [[Alandor River]].

Besides grain barges, the river carried fishing barges and pleasure barges. These latter barges were double-decked vessels decorated with purple and gold silks and full of dancers and musicians and wealthy merchants and customers. The professional dancers often doubled as both cooks and barge crews. It was popular for rich merchants to return from Esmeltaran on such barges, and village children would often cluster alongside the river when such barges passed, hoping that a kind merchant would toss them some coins or buttered lake crabs from the boat.

Because of the slowness of river travel, barges historically were easy targets for violent criminal activity. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was illegal to carry a strung bow or cocked crossbow with a half mile of the river banks. This rule was thoroughly enforced by Amnian troops. Notably, such troops were not immune from taking bribes from rich merchants.

The river was crossed by [[King's Arch]], a plain stone bridge constructed by King [[Esmel Torlath|Esmel]] at the small town of [[Gambiton]], southwest of Esmeltaran. It could also be forded at the town of [[Esford]].

Along the river were at least 20 small farming villages and hamlets, whose laborers took water from the river.
