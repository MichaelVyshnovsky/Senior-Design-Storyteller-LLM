The '''Thousand Sacred Sources of the Gaya''' was a collection of hundreds of rivers in the [[Hordelands]] and [[southeast Faerûn]] that fed the [[Gaya]], also known as the [[River Xon]], which flowed between [[Durpar]] and [[Ulgarth]] and [[Xontuil Bay]] and the [[Golden Water]]. Fed by the great [[Jumpa River]], its many tributaries and sources lay throughout the [[Katakoro Shan]] and the [[A-Ling Shan]] ranges of the [[Yehimal]] and the facing plains. These rivers were considered sacred in the [[Padhran religion]] and were a path of pilgrimage for the faithful. They visited sacred sites along each river.

The primary rivers of the Sacred Sources were:
* The [[Jumpa River]]
* The [[Gogrus River]]
* The [[Dharbang River]]
* The [[Akundi River]].
Other rivers that fed these and the Gaya included:
* The [[Shyok River]].
