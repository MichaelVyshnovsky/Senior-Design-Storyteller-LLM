'''Lance Lake''' was a lake found in the [[Greenfields (Old Empires)|Greenfields]] of [[Tymanther]].

==Geography==
Lance Lake sat at the southern end of the Greenfields, on Tymanther, near the origin of the [[River Alamber]] in the [[Unthangol Mountains]].

==History==
During the [[Spellplague]], because of the violent exchange of lands between the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], the Lance Lake was created as a consequence of the cataclysm that leveled the land.
