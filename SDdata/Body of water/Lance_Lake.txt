Lance Lake was a lake found in the Greenfields of Tymanther.
Lance Lake sat at the southern end of the Greenfields, on Tymanther, near the origin of the River Alamber in the Unthangol Mountains.
During the Spellplague, because of the violent exchange of lands between the worlds of Abeir and Toril, the Lance Lake was created as a consequence of the cataclysm that leveled the land.
