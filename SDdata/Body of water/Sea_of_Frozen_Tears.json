        "mainbody": "The Sea of Frozen Tears, also known as the Sea of Tears or the Lake of Tears, was a lake on the border between Alpuk and Vaasa.\nIn the mid-to-late 15 century DR, the Sea of Frozen Tears was a long lake, much of which was covered in platform ice. The Sea sat between the southern tip of the Surykyk Range and the northern face of the Lugsaas Chain mountains. The giant kingdom of Kultaakarr lay to the northwest of the Sea, and the ancient titan city of Baunilorotha sat on its northern coast. The ruins of Castle Perilous lay just to the south through the Valley of the White Worm. \nThe Utaak Stream flowed east out of the lake, connecting it to the Lugalpgotak Sea and feeding Taak Lake.\nPrior to the midâ€“14 century DR, the Sea of Frozen Tears was almost completely frozen beneath the Great Glacier, but served as the origin of the Utaak Stream. In the following decades, it was most notable for its proximity to Castle Perilous.\nOver the course of the 15 century, as the Great Glacier continued to melt and retreat northward, giants began migrating to the area to reclaim the ancient titan kingdom of Kultaakarr. By the , they had excavated and refounded the city of Baunilorotha on the Seas northern coast as their capital."
