The '''Galena Snake''' was a winding river that flowed down the [[Galena Mountains]] in [[Damara]].

==Geography==
Its origin was near to the northeastern edge of the Galenas, close to [[Justin's Mine]]. flowing passed the settlement of [[Samek]]{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} and then down through [[Kinbrace]]. It then turned southeast, forming the border between Soravia and the [[Barony of Morov]], before and joining the [[Icelace River]].

==Description==
The river was extremely cold, and farmers felt that this limited their ability to make use of the water.

The river was not a major travel route because it was quite small. There was a meltwater surge every spring, causing the river to overflow its banks and allowing for travel by [[canoe]] along its swift current. However, outside of this narrow window, it was otherwise unnavigable. The small river proved invaluable to the farmlands in northern [[Damara]], and it was used for transporting goods to Kinbrace.
