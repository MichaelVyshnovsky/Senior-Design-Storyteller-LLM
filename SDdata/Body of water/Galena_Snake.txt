The Galena Snake was a winding river that flowed down the Galena Mountains in Damara.
Its origin was near to the northeastern edge of the Galenas, close to Justins Mine. flowing passed the settlement of Samek and then down through Kinbrace. It then turned southeast, forming the border between Soravia and the Barony of Morov, before and joining the Icelace River.
The river was extremely cold, and farmers felt that this limited their ability to make use of the water.
The river was not a major travel route because it was quite small. There was a meltwater surge every spring, causing the river to overflow its banks and allowing for travel by canoe along its swift current. However, outside of this narrow window, it was otherwise unnavigable. The small river proved invaluable to the farmlands in northern Damara, and it was used for transporting goods to Kinbrace.
