The '''Mere River''' was a river of the [[High Ice]] region that only formed during the warmest weeks of the year.

==Description==
This flow of water was not a permanent feature of the High Ice, and as such, it was merely a river. When the sun rose above the peaks of the High Ice, part of the ice melted, and formed a steady stream. The Mere River was considered dangerous due its slippery icy flow and its surface that never completely froze.

==Geography==
The non-permanent Mere River was one of the more northern rivers of the High Ice, and it fed the [[Nyanza Lake]] to the west.
