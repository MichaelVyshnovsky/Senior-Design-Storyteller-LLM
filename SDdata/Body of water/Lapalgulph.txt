The '''Lapalgulph''' was a natural bay found on the [[Great Sea]] along the southern coast of the [[Chultan Peninsula]] in [[Tashalar]] in [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The Lapalgulph was a narrow elongated bay the reached northward into the mainland. Both of its sides were framed with mountains. The [[River Lapar]] flowed into the Lapalgulph, ending its trek from the [[Lapal Sea]] located further inland.

==Inhabitants==
The brackish wasters of the Lapalgulph were closely watched by the [[yuan-ti]] of [[House Jennestas]] from the dense jungle on its western side. The yuan-ti bribed a monstrous [[dragon turtle]] that lived beneath the waters to guard the bay from below. The eastern edge of the Lapalgulphy transformed into a mangrove swamp filled with [[sword spider]]s.
