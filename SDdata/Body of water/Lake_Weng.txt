'''Lake Weng''' (originally called the '''Lake of Amin''') was a lake in the [[Cloud Peaks]] region of [[Amn]].

==Geography==
Lake Weng was a freshwater lake that formed between the foothills of the Cloud Peaks and a rocky ridge stretching from near the city of [[Crimmor]] to the city of [[Amnwater]], sitting at an altitude of {{SI|1500|ft|long=yes}}. It was fed by the [[Amnurflow]] and [[Wengwater]] and emptied by the [[Alandor River]].

==Trade==
The lake was surrounded by more than half a dozen tiny villages, most notable of which were [[Minsor Vale]], [[Ideepton]], [[Edive]], and [[Shatar]]. The people living along the water survived by fishing in the lake and growing root crops, taking few visitors and supplying food to the upcountry [[Citadel Amnur]] and [[Citadel Rashturl]]. A small amount of barge traffic reached up the river from [[Athkatla]] and [[Crimmor]].{{Cite web/More of Waterdeep and Lands of Intrigue}}

==History==
The lands around the lake were long part of the vast [[Calim Empire]], but only became densely populated in the centuries following [[100 DR]] during which [[Athkatla]], [[Crimmor]], and [[Murann]] were founded.

In [[300 DR]], the churches of [[Lathander]], [[Mystra]], [[Sel没ne]], and [[Shar]] founded towns along the shores of the lake and became the united theocracy of [[Minsorran]].

In the {{YearlinkName|347}}, the emperor [[Shoon VII]] gave governorship of the region around the Lake of Amin to [[Thealnak]] of [[Memnon]] as a reward for creating the ''[[Codex Thealnakkar]]''.

The four settlements of Minsorran were destroyed in {{YearlinkName|600}}, when a harsh midwinter blizzard buried them in snow for months and all the citizens were eaten by the cunning [[white dragon]] [[Icehauptannarthanyx]], who escaped detection. Minsor Vale, the [[Sel没nite]] city, was eventually resettled centuries later and became a small village.
