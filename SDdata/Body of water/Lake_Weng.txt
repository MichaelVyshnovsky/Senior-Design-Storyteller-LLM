Lake Weng (originally called the Lake of Amin) was a lake in the Cloud Peaks region of Amn.
Lake Weng was a freshwater lake that formed between the foothills of the Cloud Peaks and a rocky ridge stretching from near the city of Crimmor to the city of Amnwater, sitting at an altitude of . It was fed by the Amnurflow and Wengwater and emptied by the Alandor River.
The lake was surrounded by more than half a dozen tiny villages, most notable of which were Minsor Vale, Ideepton, Edive, and Shatar. The people living along the water survived by fishing in the lake and growing root crops, taking few visitors and supplying food to the upcountry Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl. A small amount of barge traffic reached up the river from Athkatla and Crimmor.
The lands around the lake were long part of the vast Calim Empire, but only became densely populated in the centuries following 100 DR during which Athkatla, Crimmor, and Murann were founded.
In 300 DR, the churches of Lathander, Mystra, Sel没ne, and Shar founded towns along the shores of the lake and became the united theocracy of Minsorran.
In the , the emperor Shoon VII gave governorship of the region around the Lake of Amin to Thealnak of Memnon as a reward for creating the Codex Thealnakkar.
The four settlements of Minsorran were destroyed in , when a harsh midwinter blizzard buried them in snow for months and all the citizens were eaten by the cunning white dragon Icehauptannarthanyx, who escaped detection. Minsor Vale, the Sel没nite city, was eventually resettled centuries later and became a small village.
