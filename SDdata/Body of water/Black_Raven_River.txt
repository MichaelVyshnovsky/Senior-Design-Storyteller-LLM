The Black Raven River in the North was a tributary feeding into the River Mirar.
Situated in a canyon near this river was the Raven Rock. The Black Raven River spilled out of the River Caves in the Spine of the World and flowed south, past the Fell Wood and the Cold Marshes, the Ice Lakes and merged into the River Mirar.
