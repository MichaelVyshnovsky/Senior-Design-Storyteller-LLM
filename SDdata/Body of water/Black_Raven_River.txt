The '''Black Raven River''' in the [[North]] was a tributary feeding into the [[River Mirar]].

==Geography==
Situated in a canyon near this river was the [[Raven Rock]]. The Black Raven River spilled out of the [[River Caves]] in the [[Spine of the World]] and flowed south, past the [[Fell Wood]] and the [[Cold Marshes]], the [[Ice Lakes]] and merged into the River Mirar.
