The '''River Rimril''' was a river in eastern [[Amn]] that was a part of the [[Esmelflow]].

==Description==
The river began somewhere in the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]]. It poured over [[Eldath's Mount]] at the [[Green Goddess Falls]] and into [[Duskwood Dell]]. From there, it flowed into the [[Snakewood]]. Somewhere below the Green Goddess Falls was an underwater ''[[portal]]'' that connected to the [[Wyvernstones of Hullack]] in northeastern [[Cormyr]]. Travelers had to be [[good]]-aligned, bearing a [[holy symbol]] of [[Eldath]], and in the form of a fish to activate the ''portal''.

When it emerged from the Snakewood, it flowed southwest to [[Eshpurta]]. There it merged with [[Trifin Creek]] and together they joined the [[Amstel River]].{{Amstel sources}} '''Serpent's Tail''' was a local name for this river because it flowed out of the south end of Snakewood.

A bridge that was part of the [[South Road (Amn)|South Road]] crossed the river to reach Eshpurta's southeastern gates.

==History==
During the [[Shoon Empire]], this river flowed through the elvish land of [[Arundath]], the Quiet Forest (as Snakewood was then known). [[Shoon VII]] was collecting [[unicorn]] horns and slaughtered all the elves who tried to protect them. It was said that the River Rimril flowed red with their blood. For years, fishermen could still find some jewelry and trinkets on their hooks.
