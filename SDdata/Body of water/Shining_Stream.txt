The '''Shining Stream''' was a river in eastern [[Tethyr]] that was the primary tributary of the [[River Ith]].

==Geography==
The Shining Stream began in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] and poured into the River Ith. It was fed by [[Swimstar Creek]] near [[Mount Noblesse]].

Though it meandered more than would be expected, it had a strong current. It was deep in most places, but there were several exceptions where it could be forded.

The river formed the western and northern borders of [[Morninggold|County Morninggold]].

==History==
While most of the river was in Tethyrian territory, its headwaters in the Snowflakes were within the barony of [[Carrelath]] in [[Erlkazar]], a garrison of troops from Erlkazar defended them.
