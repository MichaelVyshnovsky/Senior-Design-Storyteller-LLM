The Shining Stream was a river in eastern Tethyr that was the primary tributary of the River Ith.
The Shining Stream began in the Snowflake Mountains and poured into the River Ith. It was fed by Swimstar Creek near Mount Noblesse.
Though it meandered more than would be expected, it had a strong current. It was deep in most places, but there were several exceptions where it could be forded.
The river formed the western and northern borders of County Morninggold.
While most of the river was in Tethyrian territory, its headwaters in the Snowflakes were within the barony of Carrelath in Erlkazar, a garrison of troops from Erlkazar defended them.
