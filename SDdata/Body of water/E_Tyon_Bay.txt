ETyon Bay was a bay to the north of the city of Singye in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur, lying beside the Quang Muku Forest.
By 1357 DR, ETyon Bay had become infested by tigerworms, which sunk four fishing boats and a merchant ship. Singye authorities offered a reward to any who could eliminate the menace.
