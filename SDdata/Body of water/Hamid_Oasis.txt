The '''Hamid Oasis''' was an important site found in the eastern region of the [[High Desert]] of [[west Zakhara]].

==Geography==
Though several man-made wells were found in the area, the Hamid Oasis was the only natural source of standing freshwater for hundreds of miles within the eastern arm of the High Desert, specifically in the open expanse of desert that was surrounded by mountains and cliffs.
