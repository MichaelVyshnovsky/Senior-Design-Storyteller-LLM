Ash Lake was a lake found in the Greenfields of Tymanther.
Ash Lake sat at the amid the Greenfields, on central Tymanther, dividing into two the waters of the River Alamber.
During the Spellplague, because of the violent exchange of lands between the worlds of Abeir and Toril, the River Alamber got divided into two sections when the cataclysm leveled the land, resulting in the creation of the Ash Lake.
The Ash Lake became a vital water route in Tymanther during the First Tymanther-Unther War, as it was used by the Thymari to provide Djerad Thymar with supplies during the war against Unther in 1487 DR.
