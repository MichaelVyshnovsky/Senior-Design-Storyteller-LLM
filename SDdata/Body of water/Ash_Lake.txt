'''Ash Lake''' was a lake found in the [[Greenfields (Old Empires)|Greenfields]] of [[Tymanther]].

==Geography==
Ash Lake sat at the amid the Greenfields, on central Tymanther, dividing into two the waters of the [[River Alamber]].

==History==
During the [[Spellplague]], because of the violent exchange of lands between the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], the River Alamber got divided into two sections when the cataclysm leveled the land, resulting in the creation of the Ash Lake.

The Ash Lake became a vital water route in Tymanther during the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]], as it was used by the [[Thymari]] to provide [[Djerad Thymar]] with supplies during the war against [[Unther]] in [[1487 DR]].
