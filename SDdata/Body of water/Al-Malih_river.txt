Al-Malih River, also called the Dry River, was located in Zakhara near Halwa in 1367 DR.
This river originated northeast of Halwa somewhere in the Great Anvil and flowed past the city for hundreds of miles toward the southwest.
Al-Malih River was a major feature along the Dihl al-Taif trade route since it offered a fresh source of water to caravans parched from hundreds of miles of desert travel.
