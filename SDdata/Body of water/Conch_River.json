        "mainbody": "he Conch River, or the Sky Path River, was a river of central Netheril that was a tributary of the Watercourse.\nThis body of water started in the Columns of the Sky, a mountain range in the middle of Netheril. It then flowed southward, where it was fed by the Pommel Estuary, and continued southwest until it fed the lengthy Watercourse, which itself then emptied into the Heip Lake.\nThe Sky Path River was believed to be sacred by the Rengarth barbarians that named it. These folk believed it to be the lifeblood of the deities that roamed the nearby mountains."
