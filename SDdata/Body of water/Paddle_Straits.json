        "Geography": "Paddle Straits ran to the south from Wavecrest in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], along with the [[Farshore Straits]] that mirrored the Paddle Straits' position to the south of the isle of [[Iligh√¥n]]. The Paddle Straits were considered untraversable by large marine vessels and trade ships, and even smaller ships found the straits challenging and dangerous to navigate through. The waterway was dotted with deadly jagged rocks sporadically raising bone the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Frequent fogging made the Paddle Straits even more perilous."
