The Red River was a tributary of the River Ith in Tethyr.
This creek flowed from the Purple Hills to Myratma and was often flanked by lavenders, hence its former name, Lavender Creek. It received its newer name because its waters flowed red with blood from the First Siege of Myratma during the Reclamation Wars. The fields around it were likewise called the "Red River Fields".
The Red River formed the border between counties Elemetar and Vintor.
