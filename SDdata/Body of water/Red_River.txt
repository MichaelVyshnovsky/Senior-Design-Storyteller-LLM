}}The '''Red River''' was a tributary of the [[River Ith]] in [[Tethyr]].<ref name=LoI:T-p56/>

This creek flowed from the [[Purple Hills]] to [[Myratma]] and was often flanked by lavenders, hence its former name, '''Lavender Creek'''. It received its newer name because its waters flowed red with blood from the [[First Siege of Myratma]] during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]]. The fields around it were likewise called the "Red River Fields".<ref name=LoI:T-p56/>

The Red River formed the border between counties [[Elemetar]] and [[Vintor]].<ref name=LoI:T-map />
