Al-Malja River was found in the far southern corner of west Zakhara.
Al-Malja River flowed east down from Al-Suqut Mountains through the Pearl Cities region. It emptied into the Crowded Sea at Ajayib, the City of Wonders.
Though small in size, Al-Malja, and the fertile lands hugging its banks, were vital for the city of Ajayib.
