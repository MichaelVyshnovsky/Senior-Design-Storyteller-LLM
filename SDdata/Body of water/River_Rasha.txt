The '''River Rasha''' was the great river running through [[Rashemen]] that was vital to the prosperity of the [[Rashemaar]] people.

==Description==
Do its exceptional broadness and general slow-moving pace, the River Rasha was ideal for the transportation of goods and cargo by boat. Over time it became the primary means by which Rashemen's residents moved their commercial goods across the nation.

For the most part, the River Rasha remained free from ice during the colder months of the year.

==Geography==
The Ashan originated underground beneath the eastern stretch of the [[Ashenwood]] forest. After springing aboveground within the forest, the river wound south where it was fed by the [[River Fir]] and the [[River Tir]], just north of [[Lake Tirulag]]. It continued its pathway east along Rashemen's countryside until depositing into the massive [[River Mulsantir]].
