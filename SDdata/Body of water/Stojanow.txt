}}The '''Stojanow''' river, also known to have been called the '''Barren River''' To the west of the river was the [[Grass Sea]], on most of the east bank was the [[Quivering Forest]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

It was used as the primary means to transport ore and minerals from the Dragonspines to the cities of [[Phlan]] and [[Melvaunt]].{{Cite web/More Moonsea}}

==Features==
The city of Phlan covered both banks of the river as it entered the Moonsea. Along the banks of its shores were several fortified hamlets, including [[Kabel's Hill]].

A massive [[silver pyramid]] was built on a large island in the middle of the river, known as the [[Sorcerer's Isle]], sometime around {{Yearlink|-100}}. This was used as a wizards' school until it was later abandoned.

The waters of '''Stojanow''' river near the city of '''Phlan''' were unnaturally murky due to pollutions.{{Cite adventurers league/Blood Above, Blood Below|15}}
