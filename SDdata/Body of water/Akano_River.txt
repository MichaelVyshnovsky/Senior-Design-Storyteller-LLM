The '''Akano River''' was a river on the eastern side of the main island of [[Tsukishima]] in [[Wa]].

==Geography==
The river was located north of the city of [[Uwaji]]. The tributaries of the river flowed down from the [[Ikuyu Mountains]]. The river flowed north parallel to [[Tawata Road]] and the coast, past [[Rukimbaru]], and then turned east to empty into the sea near the town of [[Chozawa]].

==Locations==
[[Chozawa Castle]] was located on the high ground above the river.

==Legends==
In the first year of the reign of [[Kochi]], Master of the Peach Tree, the first emperor of Wa, the first ever [[ch'i-lin]] rose from the waters of the Akano River and presented itself to Kochi. Upon the ch'i-lin's back were a series of characters, from which Kochi created the first written form of the [[Wa-an]] language.

In [[1347 DR|Wa Year 1765 (1347 DR)]], the general and [[daimyo]] [[Muki Nobi]] quelled a peasant uprising, slaughtering all 600 of the peasants. He floated their decapitated heads down the Akano River where they washed out to sea and were discovered by fishermen from Chozawa for several months afterward.
