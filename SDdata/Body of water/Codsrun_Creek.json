It flowed northeast from the lake through the western [[Winterglen]] before passing through the [[Codsbay Mire]] to reach the [[Codsbay]] and the [[Strait of Oman]] in northern Gwynneth. An unnamed tributary from the foothills north of the [[Cambro Mountains]] joined the Codsrun Creek before it entered the Winterglen."
