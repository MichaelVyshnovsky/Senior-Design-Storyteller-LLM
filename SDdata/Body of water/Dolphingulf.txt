The '''Dolphingulf''', known locally as the '''Dolphingulph''' or '''Delphingulph''', was a bay in the [[Chultan Peninsula]], facing the [[Shining Sea]], between the realms of [[Lapaliiya]] and the [[Tashalar]].

==Description==
Lying in the shadow of the [[Delphin Mountains]], it was a long and shallow body of water.

The abundant schools of fish attracted pods of [[dolphin]]s.

==Locations==
The city of [[Sammaresh]], the City of Dancing Dolphins, stood at the eastern end, on a wide sandy beach before three low hills.

The ruins of [[Procalith]], destroyed in the [[Rage of Wizards]] in [[1142 DR]], stood at the foot of the Delphin Mountains, overlooking the Dolphingulf.

==Inhabitants==
An [[aquatic elf]] tribe among the undersea hills at the northern edge of the bay. The elves often went to the markets of Sammaresh to trade rare treasures of the sea.

==Legends==
It was told that the Dolphingulf was protected by an [[ocean strider]]. However, there were no reliable reports confirming this.
