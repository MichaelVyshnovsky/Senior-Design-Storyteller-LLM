The '''Amstel River''' was a major river of eastern [[Amn]] that fed [[Lake Esmel]].

==Description==
This river served as a major route for barges from villages south of [[Eshpurta]] to Lake Esmel. The banks near the lake were made of the bright red clay of the region, and many villages profited from sales of pottery.

The bulk of the rivers waters came from the [[Khalleshyr]] and the [[River Valashar]].

==Geography==
The river began 40 miles east of [[Trollford]], where the River Valashar was joined by the Khalleshyr. After Trollford, it fused with the [[River Rimril]], soon after the Rimril was itself joined by [[Trifin Creek]] at Eshpurta.{{Amstel sources}}

The river was fast and deep both west and east of Trollford.  It was impossible to ford for 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of the ford. East of the joining of the Khalleshyr, the Valashar was crossable, but the Khalleshyr was not, so one had to travel even further than 75 miles east if the goal was to reach Eshpurta from the south bypassing the ford. As it approached Lake Esmel, the Amstel became passable again.

==History==
The Amstel once served as the northern border of the kingdom of [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]].
