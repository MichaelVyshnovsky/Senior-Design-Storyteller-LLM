The '''Canton River''' was a river located in southern central [[Netheril]] that ran below and parallel to the [[Rampant Peaks]].

==Description==
This river was described to be a "deep waterway" that was famed for its twelve gushing waterfalls.

==Geography==
The Canton River formed in the Rampant Peaks, and flowed eastward past [[Xinlenal]]. Once past the enclave, the river sharply turned north, where it deposited into the [[Snarefell Lake]].

===Flora & Fauna===
The waterway was inhabited by [[diamondeye trout]].

==History==
In the [[Mythallar Era]], [[orc]]s roamed the Rampant Peaks and the area around Xinlenal. The orc had sacked caravans and killed people of Ioulaum's enclave, and so the [[archwizard]] wished to discover the location of these [[orc]]s. After many years of tracking them down, his officials finally found that the orcs inhabited the knolls of the Canton River's headwaters. It was then that Ioulaum began his [[Excursion into Extinction]] campaign to slay every last orc, and his troops headed towards the source of the river.

During the later part of the the 30{{th}} century [[NY]], parts of the waterway began to descend deep into the earth. After the fall of Netheril, the river had essentially disappeared.
