The Takt Muren was a small river found in both the Hordelands and Shou Lung.
The Takt Muren flowed slightly northeast from Nor Takt for several hundred miles within the far northern reaches of the Katakoro Plateau. It cascaded over the Yellow Serpent Border Cliffs at the Yellow Thunder Falls.
The water filling the Takt Muren began as glacial runoff from the Katakoro Glacier, filling first Nor Zanskra and then Nor Takt before joining the river and ultimately combining with the Ching Tung River in Shou Lung.
