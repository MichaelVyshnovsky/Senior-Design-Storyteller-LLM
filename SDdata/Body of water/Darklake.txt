The '''Darklake''' was a series of connected bodies of water in the [[Underdark]]. They were formerly linked by waterfalls but later governed by [[Wikipedia:Lock (water navigation)|locks]] created by [[dwarven]] engineers. 

==Geography==
On the shores of the Darklake were the settlements of [[Gracklstugh]], [[Mantol-Derith]], and [[Sloobludop]].

The Darklake was located some 100 miles north and east of the [[Labyrinth]]. Dwarven tunnels carved over the Darklake connected [[Ammarindar]] to [[Menzoberranzan]], a distance of some 250 miles.

==Description==
The Darklake was located in a huge cavern more than 100 miles across. The cavern was up to 1,000 feet tall in some places, but very low in others. It could take more than two days to transverse the lake (from [[Mantol-Derith]] to [[Gracklstugh]] by boat.

The surface of the Darklake was broken with stalagmites, stalactites, and columns.

The duergar of Gracklstugh patrolled the Darklake.

==Inhabitants==
The caverns were used as a relatively safe passage by [[duergar]], although the place had its share of monsters (mainly freshwater [[troll]]s and a type of evil intelligent freshwater manta ray). There may have been a [[portal]] connecting the Darklake to one of the underground rivers servicing [[Skullport]], which if discovered could greatly facilitate trade between the [[Underdark]] and the surface.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Mantol-Derith]]: a trading city situated in an underground cavern three miles below the surface.
