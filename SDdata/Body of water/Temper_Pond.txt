The '''Temper pond''' was a brisk, clear pond found in [[Tegal's Mark]], the capital of [[Tasseldale]]. This body of water served as both a swimming hole for the Tassadran and a cooling pond for the weaponsmiths of [[Tegal Swordsmiths]].

It was rumored that the pond was also the location where the infamous bandit [[Buren|Buren the Black Mask]] hid the cache of [[gem]]s he had stolen from [[Sembia]]n noblewomen over the years.
