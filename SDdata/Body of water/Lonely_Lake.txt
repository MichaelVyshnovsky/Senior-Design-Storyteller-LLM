The Lonely Lake was a small oasis found within the Plains of Purple Dust in east Faer√ªn and the Hordelands.
The Lonely Lake lay on the eastern side of the Sword Mountains in the southern fringes of Mulhorand on the Plains of Purple Dust north of Fuirgar.
Descendants of the mighty wizard Nezram held and protected the oasis.
