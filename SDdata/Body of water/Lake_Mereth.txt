'''Lake Mereth''' was the largest of the lakes forming the [[Teardrops]] in [[Narfell]].

==Geography==
Lake Mereth was the westernmost lake of the Teardrops, flanked by the great mountain of [[Hark's Finger]] to the west. It was connected to the other parts of the Teardrops by a long river to [[Muirenon Lake]], which the [[Cold Road]] crossed some {{SI|30|mile|k|long=yes}} east from Lake Mereth.

==Inhabitants==
The [[Abordabe]] tribe lived in the area between Hark's Finger and the western coast of Muirenon Lake, fishing in the waters of Lake Mereth.
