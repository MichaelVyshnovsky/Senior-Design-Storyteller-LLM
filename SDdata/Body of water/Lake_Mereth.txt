Lake Mereth was the largest of the lakes forming the Teardrops in Narfell.
Lake Mereth was the westernmost lake of the Teardrops, flanked by the great mountain of Harks Finger to the west. It was connected to the other parts of the Teardrops by a long river to Muirenon Lake, which the Cold Road crossed some  east from Lake Mereth.
The Abordabe tribe lived in the area between Harks Finger and the western coast of Muirenon Lake, fishing in the waters of Lake Mereth.
