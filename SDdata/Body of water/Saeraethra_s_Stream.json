        "mainbody": "'''Saeraethra's Stream''' was a minor waterway in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] that merged into the [[Delimbiyr River]] on the western border of [[Daggerford]]'s [[Daggerford/Farmlands|farmlands]].",
        "Description": "Saeraethra's Stream began in the northern parts of the [[Misty Forest]] and trickled west, parallel Delimbiyr, down the [[Sword Hills]], through the deep crags of the [[Lonely Barrens]], crossing the [[Trade Way]] just south of the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]]. From there, Saeraethra's Stream curved northeast, passing through the crag at the bottom of the [[Wild Hills]] and merged into the River Delimbiyr in a small delta, west of Daggerford's farmlands and east of the [[Lizard Marsh]].",
        "History": "The stream gained its name in the {{YearlinkName|1249}}. It was named after the adventuring [[bard]] [[Saeraethra]], who inhabited its shores, was killed defending the land against a band of [[hobgoblin]] raiders."
