The '''River Ith''' was the longest river in [[Tethyr]].<ref name=LoI.T-p56/>

==Description==
The river began in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] and [[Omlarandin Mountains]] and flowed west across Tethyr, passing through the capital city of [[Darromar]] (formerly Ithmong) and into the sea at the [[Sword Coast]] a few miles west of [[Myratma]].<ref name=FRCS-map> The river formed the southern border of the [[Purple Marches]], [[Crown Lands]], and [[Golden Marches]] and the northern border of [[Ankaram|Ankaram Duchy]] and [[Suretmarch]].<ref name=LoI.T-backcover>

In addition to being the longest river in Tethyr, the River Ith was also the fastest, deepest, coldest, and most dangerous.<ref name=LoI.T-p41> It crashed violently out of the Snowflakes, but widened as it flowed west, changing speed of current into power. East of Darromar, the only safe place to cross the river was [[Survale Ford]]. West of Darromar, the river was calmer, and&mdash;after Darromar became Tethyr's capital in [[1367 DR]]<ref name=LoI.T-p41 />&mdash;barge traffic on that part of the river increased.<ref name=LoI.T-p56/>

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-2400}}, the armies of the [[Tavihr Dynasty]] of [[Calimshan]] established garrisons in the region of Omlarandin Mountains south of the river.

The river was named after [[Clan Ithal]], which provided Tethyr with its [[Ithal Dynasty|first dynasty]]. Before {{Yearlink|-293}}, it had been named the '''Wurlur'''.<ref name=LoI1.T-p24>

When [[Ernest Gallowglass]] came to power, he established a heavy a heavy toll for crossing through the city of Ithmong on the river. In [[1367 DR]], after the deposition of Gallowglass, [[Zaranda Star]] tried to negotiate with the city council of Ithmong to remove the toll and thus encourage trade.
