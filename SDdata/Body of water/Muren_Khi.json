        "mainbody": "long\nThe Muren Khi, meaning River of Earth, was a river in the Hordelands.\nBeginning at the Nor Yudol lake in the Katakoro Plateau, and flowing east into Shou Lung, the Muren Khi formed the lower half of the Muren Tso river.\nThe river got its name from the brown, silt infested, water it carried from the lake. The water of the river was otherwise normal, however, if properly gathered, and the correct prayers said, the water became a useful ingredient in healing potions.\nDue to these unique properties, several temples had built small shrines alongside the river to gather its water, and sometimes hired others to desecrate the shrines of rival temples."
