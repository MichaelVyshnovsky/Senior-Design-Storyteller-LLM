        "mainbody": "he Feather Falls was a waterfall on the eastern edge of Featherdale, a natural landmark that indicated the border between that dale and Scardale. It carried the rushing water from the River Ashaba down into the deep gorge known as the the Scar.  \nThere were much speculation circulating in Featherdale about what was behind this cascade of water, hiding in the sheer face of the cliff. There were a secret collection of grottoes known as the Temple Beneath the Falls. Some spoke of this fabled landmark as a tale to share with children, while others regarded it as a mere joke."
