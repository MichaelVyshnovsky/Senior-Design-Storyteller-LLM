The '''Sinna Oasis''' was an important oasis found in [[west Zakhara]].

==Geography==
The oasis was located {{SI|120|mi|k}} west of [[Tajar]] after [[al-Adib River]] terminated, making it an important watering hole for caravans travelling between Tajar on the [[Crowded Sea]] in the east and [[Akota (city)|Akota]] on the [[Great Sea]] in the west, as well as [[al-Badia]] roaming the desert found between [[al-Yabki Mountains]] and [[al-Suqut Mountains]]. The Sinna Oasis sat in the southern shadow of the [[Range of the Marching Camels]].
