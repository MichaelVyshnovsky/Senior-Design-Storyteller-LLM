Al-Zilla River was the smallest of the mighty rivers that traversed the Cities of the Ancients in east Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Al-Zilla originated in the northeast region from a pair of nameless tributaries in the deep jungles near the base of the mountains forming the border with the Haunted Lands.
Though much smaller than the other rivers that dominated this area of Zakhara, Al-Zilla adopted the same criss-crossing pattern as it made its way to the Foreigners Sea.
