Because the waters of Lake Esmel were not drinkable, people from Esmeltaran were willing to pay for water from the Shimmalshyr springs, and sale of this water extended to Athkatla as well, This led to a profitable business for the villagers of Coryllvol.\nThe river received its name during the time of the halfling kingdom of Meiritin.\n Coryllvol  A tiny fishing village that made most of its money from the sale of bottled spring water. \nCategoryLocations in Amn\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations on Lake Esmel\nCategoryLocations in Meiritin\npb41qyrw1n44q88xzffaste9ooe76th"
