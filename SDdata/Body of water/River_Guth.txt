The '''River Guth''' was a small river found in [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The river originated in the [[Hazur Mountains]] in northeast Thindol. It flowed southwest for approximately {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} before emptying into the [[Great Sea]] at the far northern arm of the [[Thingulph]].

==Description==
The waters of the River Guth were only navigable by boat for a few miles above its terminus. No bridges were constructed across the river and the only ford lay beyond a point where boats could safely travel.

[[Gold dwarves]] carved a cart road along the river's northern banks. The same dwarves carved watchposts into the cliffs overlooking the river.

==Inhabitants==
Since the dwarves were not populous enough to keep all of their watchposts fully manned themselves, they often hired [[human]]s as guards to fill any vacant spots.
