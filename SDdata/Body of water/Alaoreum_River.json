        "History": "The flooding of the Alaoreum River became ruinous for the settlement of [[Morningstar Hollows]]. It took several seasons for the land to become consumed by swamps and the inhabitants of Morningstar Hollows moved to the nearby town of [[Velorn's Valor]]. By the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the village was believed to be inhabited by a three dozen lizardfolk who claimed the abandoned human lands.{{Cite web/More of the Vilhon Reach}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1150}}, [[druid]]s of [[Eldath]] and the [[Emerald Enclave]] clashed with [[undead]] armies of [[mohrg]] warlord [[Borran Klosk]] in service of [[Malar]]. The [[Battle of Morningstar Hollows]] concluded in the druids rising waters of Alaoreum River, flooding the undead and, eventually, trapped the mohrg beneath [[Alaghôn]].\n\nBorran Klosk was released from his prison in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. Morningstar Hollows were taken by the creature's undead armies once more. Klosk used his [[necromancy]] to full his army with long-dead folk, murdered by the Emerald Enclave.\n\nOver the centuries since [[Ironcloak]]'s ruination, just to the east from the river, numerous adventurers searched for the treasure cache of the town's lord. Alaoreum River was believed to hide the drowned cache. The treasure rained undiscovered as of the late-14{{th}} century DR.",
