'''Hawkwing's Brook''' was a tributary of the [[Sulduskoon River]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Geography==
The brook began in the [[Starspire Mountains]] and flowed down through [[Uluran|County Uluran]] to join the great Sulduskoon.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Argentwing Dell]] : This small dell is located between Hawkwing's Brook and the Sulduskoon and is roughly shaped like a butterfly.
; [[Uluran Keep]] : The count of Uluran (sometimes) lives in this fort on the western edge of the brook.

==History==
The brook used to be called '''Banshee's Brook''' or '''Tethir Brook''' until a brave, young [[Elf|elven]] warrior woman called Hawkwing lost her life here in [[1364 DR]] defending the [[Forest of Tethir]] against those corrupting it.
