Hawkwings Brook was a tributary of the Sulduskoon River in Tethyr.
The brook began in the Starspire Mountains and flowed down through County Uluran to join the great Sulduskoon.
 Argentwing Dell  This small dell is located between Hawkwings Brook and the Sulduskoon and is roughly shaped like a butterfly.
 Uluran Keep  The count of Uluran (sometimes) lives in this fort on the western edge of the brook.
The brook used to be called Banshees Brook or Tethir Brook until a brave, young elven warrior woman called Hawkwing lost her life here in 1364 DR defending the Forest of Tethir against those corrupting it.
