        "mainbody": "l-Wahl River was an important river found within Interior Zakhara that fed the industry of Hiyal.\nAl-Wahl originated in the peaks of the southern tip of the Furrowed Mountains. It flowed south for a short distance before meeting the North Quarter of Suq Bay at the junction of Al-Tariq Channel.\nThough small, Al-Wahl was a critical resource for the industrious city of Hiyal. The lands surrounding the river were quite fertile."
