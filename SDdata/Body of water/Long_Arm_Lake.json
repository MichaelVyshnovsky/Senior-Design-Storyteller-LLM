        "mainbody": "The Long Arm Lake, previously known as the Lake of the Long Arm,\nThe lake was fed by the Wet River that delivered water from the Wet Wood at the western base of the Orsraun Mountains.\nCenturies before the raising of the Standing Stone, the the Long Arm lake marked the southern border of the domain of Borem, one of the Seven Lost Gods.\nSome time between 409 DR and 516 DR, the magister Eldrus Wands discovered a spelljammer that had crashed in the Wood of Sharp Teeth and out of a sense of amusement piloted it into the depths of Long Arm Lake.\nThe feudal Shou nation of Nathlan was located along the shore of the Long Arm Lake, as was its capital city of Nathlekh.\nSomewhere along the southern shore was a portal that linked to the ruined Sarrukh city of Ilimar."
