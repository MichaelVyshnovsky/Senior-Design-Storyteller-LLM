The Arkhen Falls were the largest and most beautiful waterfall in all of the Dalelands. It was formed by a spring shooting out from Mount Thalagbror, cascading down the southern face of the northern ridge of the Thunder Peaks. The rushing waters emptied out into the gorge of the Arkhen Vale and formed the River Arkhen.
There was a legend that pegasi would flutter around the falls.
The rocky cliffs behind the falls were rich with valuable minerals such as copper and gem stones.
