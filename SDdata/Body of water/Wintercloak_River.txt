The '''Wintercloak River''' connected the [[Deepwash]] with the [[Nagawater]].

==Description==
The river was swift but still navigable, even going upstream if the wind was right and the rowers were strong enough. It passed through several of gorges as it passed through the [[Cloven Mountains]] and through the [[Winterwood]].
