        "mainbody": "The Dragons Teeth Lagoon was the body of water between the \"jaws\" of the Dragons Head Peninsula, the westernmost part of the Tethyr Peninsula.\nDragons Teeth Lagoon was a peaceful inlet in the Trackless Sea and bordering Asavirs Channel to the north. Its name was insured by the shape of the peninsula rather than any sort of draconic activity in the area. The shoreline of the Dragons Teeth Lagoon was known as the Bite and was the location of forty abandoned villas and manors abandoned during the Ten Black Days of Eleint of the . The manors were looted, ravaged, and burned by the angry mobs, and their inhabitants â€“ slaughtered. However, some of the villas were still in use and heavily guarded in the late 14 century DR. Whether used by their rightful owners or not remained a mystery. The Firedrake Road hugged the Dragons Head coastline and passed the abandoned mansions overlooking the Dragons Teeth Lagoon. On rare occasions, ships were ween dropping anchors by some of the villas still in use, and heavily guarded companies prevented anyone from straying off the Firedrake Road along the Lagoons shores.\nThe Tethyr Peninsula was known for its fierce winters. The elements and water freezing in the ruined mansions walls often caused collapses, exposing more and more of their interior with each passing season.\n*Banshees Point, the small forest on the southernmost point of Cape Velen with terrifying whaling heard by passing ships.\n*Carlsmere, once favored villa of the Tethyrean royal family.
