        "Description": "The Calling River was one of the three waterways that started as waterfalls plummeting from a plateau at the center of Ilighôn, forming mist-covered rivers. The [[Elder River]] ran north, passing [[Archentree]], the [[Springbrook]] ran west until it emptied into the [[Springbrook Shallows]], and lastly, the Calling River flowed south into the [[Lake Bluesprings]], through it, and culminating in the river mouth delta that fed into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].",
        "History": "In the early ventures, before Ilighôn was settled, the Calling River served as a path for pilgrims who followed [[Silvanus]]'s call up to the plateau that later became the [[Oakenhall]], or the House of Silvanus.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the shores of the Calling River were a meeting spot of [[Shinthala Deepcrest]], the Amazon Queen of Ilighôn and a member of the Elder Circle of the [[Emerald Enclave]], and [[Ashenford Torinbow]] a [[druid]] from [[Shadowdale]]. The druids met to discuss the looming danger of [[undead]] warlord [[Borran Kiosk]]."
