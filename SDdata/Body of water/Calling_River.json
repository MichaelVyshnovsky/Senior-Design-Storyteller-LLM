The Elder River ran north, passing Archentree, the Springbrook ran west until it emptied into the Springbrook Shallows, and lastly, the Calling River flowed south into the Lake Bluesprings, through it, and culminating in the river mouth delta that fed into the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nIn the early ventures, before Iligh么n was settled, the Calling River served as a path for pilgrims who followed Silvanuss call up to the plateau that later became the Oakenhall, or the House of Silvanus.\nIn the , the shores of the Calling River were a meeting spot of Shinthala Deepcrest, the Amazon Queen of Iligh么n and a member of the Elder Circle of the Emerald Enclave, and Ashenford Torinbow a druid from Shadowdale. The druids met to discuss the looming danger of undead warlord Borran Kiosk."
