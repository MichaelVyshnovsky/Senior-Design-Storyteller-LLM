        "Description": "Esmel River was a peaceful and wide river that drained [[Lake Esmel]] at [[Esmeltaran]] and flowed west to the Sea of Swords. At its source, the waters were warm from the hot springs of the lake, but after a mile, they cooled to normal temperatures, though they still maintained their \"chalklike\", \"irontang\" sulfur taste for a good distance from the lake.\n\nThe Emsel River was full of barges, even more so than the [[Alandor River]]. \n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| text   = The Esmel is more easily walked across than swum.\n| source = An old local saying\n}}\nBesides grain barges, the river carried fishing barges and pleasure barges.
