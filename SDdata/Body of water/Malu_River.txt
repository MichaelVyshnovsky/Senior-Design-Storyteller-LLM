The Malu River was a river in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.
Found on the eastern edge of Koryo, the Malu River began high in the Sillan Mountains, then ran south alongside the Vorkani Mountains. It then turned east through the Quang Muku Forest and emptied into the sea at Foo Nakar.
The largest settlement on the Malu River was the city of Foo Nakar, which lay at its mouth.
Lying near the headwaters of the Malu was the village of Mu Tong.
In the midâ€“14th century DR, pirates plying the Malu River once raided Foo Nakar. They were routed in a defense led by Pouri Lam, mistress of the city.
