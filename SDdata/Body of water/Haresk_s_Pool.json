        "mainbody": "Heresks pool was a placid fishing pond nearby to the High Councilors House in the city of Ashabenford within Mistledale. It was populated by a number of fish that would harmlessly nibble at the toes of anyone who decided to leap in for a swim.\nDuring Haresk Malorns tenure as High Councilor, his wife Imbrautha and children could be found taking a swim in the pond to cool off during hot days.\nThere were legends that the muddy depths of the pond contained chests of gold coins and jewelry, the hidden cache of treasure from some long-past bandit captain. By the 1360s DR, the bottom of the pool had been dragged four times in search of these riches, but nothing was ever found."
