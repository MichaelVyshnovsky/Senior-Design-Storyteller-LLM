The '''Bay of Mists''' was the natural harbor around which the city of [[Neverwinter]] was located.

==Description==
The Bay was one of the few naturally deep ports along the [[Sword Coast]], and sat at the mouth of the [[Neverwinter River]] where it emptied into the [[Sea of Swords]]. the Bay remained ice-free in the winter.

==Trade==
The city of Neverwinter was a prosperous port city largely thanks to the natural advantages of this harbor, where the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] sat. The Bay of Mists saw ships coming and going yearround and at all hours.

==Defenses==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Neverwinter Guard]] had positioned [[catapult]]s and [[ballista]]e to defend the harbor against attackers.{{cite web|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|title=Ed's Twitter|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131000350/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1168297608508522502?s=20|accessdate=2023-01-30}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|87}}, the city of [[Eigersstor]]&mdash;later known as Neverwinter&mdash;was founded on the Bay of Mists by settlers from [[Ruathym]] to take advantage of it as an ice-free port.<ref name=tGHotR-p61>

Following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, chunks of land broke away from the shore to float above the Bay as [[earthmote]]s. at least until Neverwinter was destroyed during the events of the [[Ruining]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}.{{Cite digital book/Gauntlgrym||9}} This cataclysm saw lava make its way down the river to the Bay{{Cite digital book/Charon's Claw/Kindle||6}} and resulted in the destruction of the harbor.

The Bay remained choked with the ruins of the old docks&mdash;known as the [[swamped docks]]&mdash;and a new Docks District would not be fully rebuilt for three decades. Efforts to dredge the Bay were ongoing as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, overseen by Neverwinter's harbormaster, [[Len-jes]].

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of Neverwinter.
* The [[Moonstone Mask]], an inn located on an earthmote above the water.

==Inhabitants==
The warm waters of the Bay made it home to plentiful [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[sahuagin]] had been spotted in the Bay.
