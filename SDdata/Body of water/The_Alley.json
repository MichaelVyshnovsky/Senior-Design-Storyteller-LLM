        "mainbody": "The Alley was a long, winding river of eastern Netheril.\nThe name of this river, the Alley, came from a military tactic known as the alley attack. The alley attack was used by orc combatants in order to conceal their approach. As such, the Alley essentially acted as a shield, where the hidden orcs could spring an assault from one direction, while the majority of their warriors charged from the opposite direction.\nThe Alley began in the Abbey Mountains to the east, and flowed westward, where it passed by the enclave of Jockteleg to the south. It then flowed northward, and was fed by Escalade Rill, where it then began to flow to the northwest. After a long stretch, the Alley emptied into the Narrow Sea."
