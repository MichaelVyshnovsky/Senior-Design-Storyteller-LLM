The Churning Bay was violent gulf on the Vilhon Reach where the city of Hlondeth was founded.
The bay was located along the northern shore of the Vilhon Reach near its western end.
Dangerous even to skilled sailors, the frothing waters of this narrow gulf were home to powerful tides that left many broken ships along the floor of the gulf.
