        "Description": "It flowed fast enough so that it never froze over, even in the harshest of winters, but it was deadly cold if someone fell in.",
        "Geography": "The river flowed southwest down from the [[Great Glacier]], through the far western part of [[Narfell]] and into the Damaran [[Duchy of Soravia]] before arriving in [[Lake Mogador]] in central Damara.",
        "History": "Every harvest, the farmers of Soravia would brave the treacherous rapids of the river to bring their meager goods to market in the south of Damara.\n\nThe Nars rarely crossed the river, but did so during the [[Vaasan War]] to probe the strength of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]]'s armies as they ravaged northern Damara. The riders fell upon a [[Vaasa]]n camp along the Icelace, easily cutting through the [[goblin]] ranks, but were quickly routed when a member of Zhengyi's [[Cult of the Goat's Head]] suddenly raised an army of [[undead]] to face them.\n\nAs of the early 1370s [[DR]], King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] of Damara found the river useful for protecting the northeastern border of his kingdom from aggressive Nar tribes. If the river became needed to repel the tribesmen or the [[blightlords]] of [[Dunwood]], he planned to expand his borders to better defend the river."
