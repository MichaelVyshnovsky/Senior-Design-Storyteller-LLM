        "mainbody": "The Icelace River was a twisting waterway in the Cold Lands.\nIt flowed fast enough so that it never froze over, even in the harshest of winters, but it was deadly cold if someone fell in.\nThe river flowed southwest down from the Great Glacier, through the far western part of Narfell and into the Damaran Duchy of Soravia before arriving in Lake Mogador in central Damara.\nEvery harvest, the farmers of Soravia would brave the treacherous rapids of the river to bring their meager goods to market in the south of Damara.\nThe Nars rarely crossed the river, but did so during the Vaasan War to probe the strength of Zhengyi the Witch-Kings armies as they ravaged northern Damara. The riders fell upon a Vaasan camp along the Icelace, easily cutting through the goblin ranks, but were quickly routed when a member of Zhengyis Cult of the Goats Head suddenly raised an army of undead to face them.\nAs of the early 1370s DR, King Gareth Dragonsbane of Damara found the river useful for protecting the northeastern border of his kingdom from aggressive Nar tribes. If the river became needed to repel the tribesmen or the blightlords of Dunwood, he planned to expand his borders to better defend the river."
