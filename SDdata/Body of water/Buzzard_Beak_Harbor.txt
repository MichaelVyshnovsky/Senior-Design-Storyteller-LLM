Buzzard Beak Harbor was a small bay found off the Easting Reach in northeast Faer√ªn. 
Part of the harbor was in Damara and the other part was in Impiltur. The natural harbor was treacherous to shipping due to the many reefs and high concentration of weeds, but it was a popular destination with smugglers and pirates. 
Rilaunyrs Warship was known to patrol the area.
