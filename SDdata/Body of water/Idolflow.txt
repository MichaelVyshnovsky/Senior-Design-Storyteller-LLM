The Idolflow was a river in eastern Tethyr that fed into the Gorge of the Fallen Idol.
The river was fed by the longer Levast River.
The Idolflow poured into the Gorge of the Fallen Idol and joined the River Ith.
There was evidence that the river had once been much larger and that a lake once filled the area between its connections with the River Ith and the Levast.
