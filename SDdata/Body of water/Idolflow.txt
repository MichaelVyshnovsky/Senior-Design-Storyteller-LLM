The '''Idolflow''' was a river in eastern [[Tethyr]] that fed into the [[Gorge of the Fallen Idol]].

==Geography==
The river was fed by the longer [[Levast River]].

The Idolflow poured into the Gorge of the Fallen Idol and joined the [[River Ith]].

==History==
There was evidence that the river had once been much larger and that a lake once filled the area between its connections with the River Ith and the Levast.
