The '''Wet River''' was a river found in the [[Vilhon Reach]] region of [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]].

==Geography==
The Wet River originated in the southwestern slopes of the [[Orsraun Mountains]] and flowed westward across the [[Shining Plains]]. The river passed through the [[Wetwoods]] at the base of the mountains, contributing to the bog-like conditions that gave them their name, and wound north before emptying into the [[Long Arm Lake]] on the [[Dragon Coast]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Assam]], a small city that was governed by the two city-states of [[Lheshayl]] and [[Ormath]].
