        "mainbody": "The River of the Dawn lay between the lands of Mulhorand and Thay. Both nations claimed this waterway as their own, and combat between the forces of both sides erupted on occasion.\nThough both bordering nations claimed land on the opposite shore of the River of the Dawn, this rapid-flowing waterway followed what is generally accepted as the boundary between Mulhorand and Thay. The rivers waters were crossed at only a single point, a bridge constructed as part of the great eastern trading road.\nA single Thayan outpost served to cement the nations claim on the lands surrounding the River of the Dawn, while military patrols in the region provided a similar claim for Mulhorand. In addition, merchants could often be found traveling along the eastern trading road."
