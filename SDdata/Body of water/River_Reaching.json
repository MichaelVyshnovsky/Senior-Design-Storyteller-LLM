            "Flora & Fauna": "The river was somewhat dangerous, due to being inhabited {{SIAdj|6|ft|adj=long}} eel-fish known as [[lamprey]]s. Such creatures fed on whatever was available to them, which included [[human]]s and [[cattle]] crossing the river. During springtime, they would come out of hibernation and search for food across the full length of the river. Thus, animals and humans rarely bathed or swam there.\n\nA unique species of river [[eel]] that inhabited this body of water were known as dreels. They subsisted upon algae and carrion, which kept the river's waters both clean and clear."
