The '''River Gauros''' was a relatively short river in northeastern [[Thay]] that flowed from the [[Sunrise Mountains]], down the [[First Escarpment]] into the [[River Mulsantir]] in the [[Gorge of Gauros]]. Unlike the other waterways of Thay, this river was only partially navigable and offered little economic or tactical value to the nation's ruling [[tharch]]s and [[zulkir]]s.

==Ecology==
There was little to no plant or animal life that could be found within the River Gauros.

==History==
During an ill-fated invasion of [[Rashemen]] on [[Mirtul 5]], [[1375 DR]], the [[Red Wizards]] serving under Tharchions [[Azhir Kren]] and [[Homen Odesseiron]] temporarily impeded the flow of the icy river with their [[magic]], in an effort to march Thayan legions across the Gorge of Gauros. However, the [[Witches of Rashemen]] countered their [[spell]]s, and sent the waters raging at the soldiers caught in its path.
