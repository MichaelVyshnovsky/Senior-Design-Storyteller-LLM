The Liontongue River, also known as the River Pritan or the River Panka, was a waterway found in the Shining Lands.
The river flowed through Veldorn, Estagund and a small part of Durpar. It originated in the Thrulaliel Mountains in the southwest, flowing north to join the River Madras near the Wood of Dark Trees before turning east and meeting the western bank of the Golden Water. The Liontongue River stretched for several hundred miles along its path to the sea.
