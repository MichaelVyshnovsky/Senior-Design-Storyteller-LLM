The '''Green Goddess Falls''' were a series of waterfalls in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The Falls were part of the [[River Rimril]], as its waters flowed out of the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]]. The largest of the falls was {{SI|400|ft|long=yes}} in height and poured over the cliffs on the west side of [[Eldath's Mount]] and into [[Duskwood Dell]]. Afterward, the waters continued cascading in a number of smaller falls and pools called the '''Steps'''.
