The '''River Olung''' was a major river in [[Chult]].

==Geography==
The River Olung flowed from [[Lake Luo]] in the [[Valley of Embers]] northward to [[Kitcher's Inlet]], The river flowed beside the city of [[Mezro]], forming its western and southern borders.

As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it served as an important border between the "ordinary" region of the jungle, and the area that was infested with [[undead]].

==Inhabitants==
[[Aldani]] were known to inhabit the deep waters of the Olung, and [[dragon turtle]]s were found at its mouth.

The ''[[bara]]'' [[Mainu]] also made her home in the waters, appearing a patch of darkness with golden eyes to those who saw her.
