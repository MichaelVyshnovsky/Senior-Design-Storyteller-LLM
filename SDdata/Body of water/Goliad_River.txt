}}The '''Goliad River''' was an important waterwayÂ found in [[Damara]] in the [[Bloodstone Lands]].

==Geography==
The Goliad flowed north to south, originating high in the [[Galena Mountains]]. The Goliad merged with the [[Beaumaris River]] at the city of [[Goliad]] before continuing south to empty into [[Lake Mogador]] in the center of Damara.

==Description==
Unless frozen solid, the waters of the Goliad River ran wide and deep.

==History==
Because of its size, the Goliad River was ideally suited for barges transporting goods throughout the heartland of Damara.
