        "mainbody": "The Wyvernwater was a star-shaped freshwater lake more or less centrally positioned in Cormyr.\nIt had abundant crab, eel, and fish stocks. Each morning, the lake was covered in a thick mist, and those who fished it early in the morning were therefore known as \"mistfishers\". The lake was fed by the Sword River to the northwest, the Immerflow to the northeast, and the Thunder River to the east, and it flowed into the Dragonmere to the south, via the Wyvernflow."
