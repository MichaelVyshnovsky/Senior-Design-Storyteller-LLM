        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|-231}}, fifty [[sea elves]] migrated to Lake Sember and established a community. This first and largest group of sea elves was known as the [[Kelpor'ral clan]] and once they discovered the safety of the lake more clans followed.\n\nIn the early days these sea elves lived in underground, [[limestone]] caves beneath [[Semberholme]]. Eventually they would construct a small city known as [[Hyaline]], using [[granite]] and limestone mined from the bottom of the lake and then cemented them together with specially bred freshwater mollusks.\n\n''Circa'' [[650 DR]], the sea elf population had grown to four hundred and they were engaging in trade with [[Myth Drannor]] for building supplies. Around this time the lake was still largely devoid of [[human]] fishermen and predatory marine life.",

        "Rumors & Legends": "Purportedly, beneath its waters was the [[Crystalline Towers]], a holy resting place of the [[elves]]."
