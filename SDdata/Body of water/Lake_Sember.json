        "mainbody": "ake Sember was a medium sized freshwater lake in the southwest of Cormanthyr. It was drained by the Semberflow to the east. The elven community of Semberholme was the on the northern shore of the lake.\nIn the , fifty sea elves migrated to Lake Sember and established a community. This first and largest group of sea elves was known as the Kelporral clan and once they discovered the safety of the lake more clans followed.\nIn the early days these sea elves lived in underground, limestone caves beneath Semberholme. Eventually they would construct a small city known as Hyaline, using granite and limestone mined from the bottom of the lake and then cemented them together with specially bred freshwater mollusks.\nCirca 650 DR, the sea elf population had grown to four hundred and they were engaging in trade with Myth Drannor for building supplies. Around this time the lake was still largely devoid of human fishermen and predatory marine life.\n* Hyaline, an ancient sea elf city.\nPurportedly, beneath its waters was the Crystalline Towers, a holy resting place of the elves."
