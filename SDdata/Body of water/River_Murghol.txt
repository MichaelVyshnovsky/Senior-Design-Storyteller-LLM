The River Murghol was a waterway found on the outskirts of Thay and the Great Amber Steppes in east Faerûn and the Hordelands.
The River Murghol originated in the Sunrise Mountains along Thays eastern boundary. It flowed southeast from the mountains onto the great plains of the Hordelands, joining the Clearflow River northwest of the Mountains of Copper. It continued to flow south past the Ganathwood where it joined the River Rauthenflow in Murghôm. It stretched for approximately  along its full span.
