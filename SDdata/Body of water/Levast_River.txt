Levast River was a river in eastern Tethyr that was a tributary of the Idolflow.
The river was believed to have been named after a dwarven clansman.
Levast River fed the shorter Idolflow.
Some dwarves believed that an offshoot of the river broke off and became subterranean, perhaps even entering the ancient realm of Shanatar.
