        "mainbody": "he Laughingflow, also known as the Trollflow in Nesmé, was a river located in the Evermoors in northwest Faerûn. The name Laughingflow was a rough translation of the original Elven name, which had it self been lost over time.\nEmerging from a lake somewhere within the Evermoors, it flowed west and joined the Surbrin at Mornbryns Shield. The Laughingflow drained the southern moors, and the land on the other side was relatively barren, in stark contrast to its name.\nThe clear, fast-flowing river had a gravel bottom and banks lined with felsul, laspar, and a few blueleaf trees. Its water was drinkable but had a sharp mineral tang.\nThe river was home to many edible crabs, a few shalass, many schools of the small brown lout, and also slimy but edible black-and-green rock eels that inhabited the river bottom.\nThe Laughingflow was seen as unsafe, for trolls, orcs, and barbarians would lay in wait nearby to ambush travelers on the river.\nThe ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar, known as Old Gnawbone, sometimes drank from the lake that fed the Laughingflow.\nThe Riders of Nesmé constructed several palisades, earthworks, and base camps along the Laughingflow.\nTo the south, the town of Yartar stood at the confluence of the Surbrin and Dessarin rivers. Its people fished the Surbrin, Dessarin, and Laughingflow, which they called \"the Three Rivers\"."
