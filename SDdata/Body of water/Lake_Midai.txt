Lake Midai was a small but vital freshwater lake found in Bloodstone Barony.
Lake Midai sat at the foot of the Galena Mountains on the western end of the barony.
The lake stretched from north to south for several miles, but was only a mile wide. Though small, the lake was incredibly deep.
The plunging depths of Lake Midai provided ample fishing opportunities for the people of Bloodstone Village.
