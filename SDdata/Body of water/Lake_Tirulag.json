        "Description": "The waters of Lake Tirulag were just as cold as those in the near-freezing [[Lake Ashane]] to the north. Those Rashemaar who wanted to prove their courage (as well as their foolishness) often competed with one another by leaping naked into the lake and swam around for as long as possible. These contests were appropriately followed by great feasts held in well-warmed lodge houses.",
