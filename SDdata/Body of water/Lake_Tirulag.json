        "mainbody": "ake Tirulag was an ice-cold lake found in Rashemen that provided great natural resources and cultural significance for the nation of witches and berserkers.\nThe waters of Lake Tirulag were just as cold as those in the near-freezing Lake Ashane to the north. Those Rashemaar who wanted to prove their courage (as well as their foolishness) often competed with one another by leaping naked into the lake and swam around for as long as possible. These contests were appropriately followed by great feasts held in well-warmed lodge houses.\nFed by the River Tir coming down from the High Country, The lake was located in the center of Rashemens most populated region, within a number of major settlements. Its waters continued west through the River Rasha to the great River Mulsantir.\nThe small village of Tinnir was situated within a forested valley along its southeastern edge.\nThe frigid waters of the lake were rich with trout, a unique species of crayfish, and other aquatic life that provided food for a great number of the Rashemaar people.\nLegends stated that a great stash of treasure lay somewhere at the bottom of Lake Tirulag. While various rumors surround its origin,\nLike much of Rashemen, Lake Tirulag was inhabited by spirits that served as guardians of the land."
