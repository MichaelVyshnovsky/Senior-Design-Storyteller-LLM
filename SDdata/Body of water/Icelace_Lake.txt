'''Icelace Lake''' was a frigid lake in [[Narfell]] that was created from runoff from the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
The body of Icelace Lake was long and thin, almost resembling a bloated river. It stretched across much of northern Narfell, acting as a kind of barrier against the Great Glacier.

==Activities==
Various tribes of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] braved the frigid waters of the lake in deerskin canoes for the rich salmon and trout teeming in the water. Bears were also drawn to the lake because of the fish, but viewed humans as an easy target for a quick meal.
