Skoonds Run was the strait in the Sea of Swords that separated the island of Thelve from the three islands to the south â€“ Arthoum, Nairns Tomb, and Askalet.
Skoonds Run and the islands that surrounded it were located to the west from Candlekeep, a library-fortress on the Sword Coast North. Several natural and man-made harbors we built along Skoonds Run, away from rocks and harsh winds of the Racewind Passage
