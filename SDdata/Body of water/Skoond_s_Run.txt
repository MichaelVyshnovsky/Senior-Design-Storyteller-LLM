'''Skoond's Run''' was the strait in the [[Sea of Swords]] that separated the island of [[Thelve]] from the three islands to the south – [[Arthoum]], [[Nairn's Tomb]], and [[Askalet]].

==Geography==
Skoond's Run and the islands that surrounded it were located to the west from [[Candlekeep]], a library-fortress on the [[Sword Coast North]]. Several natural and man-made harbors we built along Skoond's Run, away from rocks and harsh winds of the [[Racewind Passage]]
