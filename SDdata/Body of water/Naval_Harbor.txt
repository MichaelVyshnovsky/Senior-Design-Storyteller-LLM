The Naval Harbor was part of the waterfront of Waterdeep, City of Splendors.
The harbor was located to the west of Waterdeeps Great Harbor and south of the southern tip of the Castle Ward.
Stormhaven Island partially enclosed the Naval Harbor from the southwest. The rest of the harbor was barricaded with walls. A pair of chain gates on either side of the harbor allowed access to the Great Harbor in the east and the Sea of Swords in the west.
The fleet of Waterdeeps navy was based in the Naval Harbor. Commericial and personal vessels were not permitted in this area.
A pair of stout watchtowers—Harborwatch Tower and Smugglers Bane Tower—watched over the Naval Harbor.
