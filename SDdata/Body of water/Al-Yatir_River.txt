Al-Yatir River was a small but vital river supporting the city of Umara in the Free Cities of Zakhara.
Al-Yatir River originated on the northwest slops at the southern end of the Furrowed Mountains.
The river flowed northwest from the mountains for about a hundred miles before emptying into the Great Sea. Umara was founded on the rivers east bank near the sea.
