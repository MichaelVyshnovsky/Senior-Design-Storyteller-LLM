The '''Long Arm Lake''', previously known as the '''Lake of the Long Arm''',
==Geography==
The lake was fed by the [[Wet River]] that delivered water from the [[Wetwoods|Wet Wood]] at the western base of the [[Orsraun Mountains]].

==History==
Centuries before the raising of the [[Standing Stone]], the the Long Arm lake marked the southern border of the domain of [[Borem]], one of the [[Seven Lost Gods]].

Some time between [[409 DR]] and [[516 DR]], the [[magister]] [[Eldrus Wands]] discovered a [[spelljammer]] that had crashed in the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] and out of a sense of amusement piloted it into the depths of Long Arm Lake.

==Notable Locations==
The feudal [[Shou]] nation of [[Nathlan]] was located along the shore of the Long Arm Lake, as was its capital city of [[Nathlekh]].

Somewhere along the southern shore was a ''[[portal]]'' that linked to the ruined [[Sarrukh]] city of [[Ilimar]].
