The River Arkhen, also known as the River Elzimmer, down to Selgaunt Bay in Sembia.
The great city of Archenbridge, which also served as Archendales capital, gained its name from its position straddling the river over the eponymous Arkhen Bridge along the Dawnpost.
The River Arkhen rested in a deep gorge that cut through the Arkhen Vale. It was fed by the Arkhen Falls, which emerged from Mount Thalagbror, in the Thunder Peaks, and continued southeast between the Marching Mountains and the Arch Wood forest.
The original Arkhen Bridge, a stonework crossing which allowed travel over the River Arkhen, was originally erected around 1100 DR by a dwarven engineer by the name of Naiden Stonewright. In 1293 DR, a massive flood of the river destroyed all but its stone casements and the buttresses, A wooden bridge was built in its place, upon the foundation set in by the dwarf almost two centuries before.
Native Selgauntans always referred to this river as the Elzimmer after a long-dead water wizard.
