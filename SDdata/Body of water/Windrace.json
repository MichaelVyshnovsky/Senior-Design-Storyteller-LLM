        "Geography": "The Windrace stretched roughly from [[the Bowl]] in the south to [[Alphar Isle]] in the north.",
        "Description": "The Windrace derived its name from the strong prevailing winds in the area, allowing for relatively safe and quick travel for a vessel heading from the Bowl to Alphar Isle. Travel in the opposite direction was extremely slow because of the same winds.",
        "History": "A popular way to settle disputes between captains in the Pirate Isles was to race from [[Mirg Isle]] across the Bowl and through the Windrace to Alphar Isle."
