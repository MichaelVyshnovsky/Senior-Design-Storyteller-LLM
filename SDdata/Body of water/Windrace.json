        "mainbody": "The Windrace was a prominent strait found within the Pirate  Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThe Windrace stretched roughly from the Bowl in the south to Alphar Isle in the north.\nThe Windrace derived its name from the strong prevailing winds in the area, allowing for relatively safe and quick travel for a vessel heading from the Bowl to Alphar Isle. Travel in the opposite direction was extremely slow because of the same winds.\nA popular way to settle disputes between captains in the Pirate Isles was to race from Mirg Isle across the Bowl and through the Windrace to Alphar Isle."
