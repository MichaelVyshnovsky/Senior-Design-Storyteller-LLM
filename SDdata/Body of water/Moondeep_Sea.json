        "mainbody": "The Moondeep Sea was a subterranean lake, approximately  wide, found in the Underdark beneath the Galena Mountains and the cold plains of Vaasa.\nThe Moondeep Sea was located in the Upperdark. The cavern which contained it was known as the Vault of Gnashing Teeth, so named for the countless animated skulls stuck to the caverns ceiling. The water of the lake was fed from the Great Glacier.\nThe lake was surrounded by a confusing network of tunnels and caverns known as the \"Lost Ways,\" remnants of the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Sarphil. These passages wound beneath the lake and deeper into the Underdark.\nThe lake was magically connected to the Moonsea so that moonlight hitting it would be reflected on the surface of its Underdark counterpart.\nThe city of Velddrinnssharâ€Ž lay on a mile-wide island dominated by a plateau in the middle of the lake.\nThe Moondeep Sea was known for its giant water spiders."
