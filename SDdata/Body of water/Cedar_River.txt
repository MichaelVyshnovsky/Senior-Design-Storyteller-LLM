The Cedar River was a waterway that passed through the Gulthmere Forest on the Dragon Coast, in the Eastern Heartlands of Faer√ªn.
The river was used by some merchants and traders to move their product to the city of Cedarspoke.
The Cedar River originated at two adjacent mountain ranges first as the North Cedar River flowing northeast from the Orbrekh, and second as the South Cedar River flowing north from the Orsraun Mountains Each of these waterways came together at a point in the forest, before continuing north and emptying out into Starmantle Bay.
* Cedarspoke, the Cedar River passed directly through the capital of Gulthandor, dividing it in half.
