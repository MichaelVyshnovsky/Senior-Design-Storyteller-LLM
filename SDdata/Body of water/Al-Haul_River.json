        "mainbody": "l-Haul River was a small river found in the Free Cities of North Zakhara.\nThe river flowed down from the Furrowed Mountains on a northwestern course before reaching the Great Sea.\nQadib, the City of Wands, was founded along Al-Hauls eastern bank. As with all rivers found along the coast of North Zakhara, the lands surrounding the banks of Al-Haul as it neared the coast were highly fertile, allowing the city and its inhabitants to flourish."
