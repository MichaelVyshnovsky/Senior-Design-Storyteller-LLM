The '''Sea of Moving Ice''', also referred to as the '''Floating Land''' by the [[Reghedmen]] barbarians, was a collection of icebergs and frost-covered isles that floated in the waters of [[northwest Faerûn]].{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|197}}

==Geography==
The Sea of Moving Ice was located west of [[Icewind Dale]] and northwest of the [[Cold Run]].

==Geographical Features==
Almost completely uncharted, the ice masses set wide enough apart for a ship to pass. The ice of the sea changed so that all but the most experienced seafarers could be caught off guard. Proof of such are a collection of ancient ice-locked ships.

==Notable Locations==

==Inhabitants==
Along with [[seal]]s, [[walrus]]es and [[polar bear]]s, the Sea of Moving Ice was also home to other dangers. Lairs of [[ice troll]]s could be found in errant shipwrecks, and [[white dragon]]s often made home within larger icebergs.

Few humans made their home among the icy bergs. Among the few that did were the nomadic [[Ice Hunter]] tribes,{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|101}} and whalers who dwelled upon the sea's icy shores.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|19}}

==Rumors & Legends==
A portal in the Sea of Moving Ice led to the [[High Ice]] in [[north Faerûn]]. It was protected by the [[orc]] [[druid]] [[Thurghom]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Frozen Wastes: The Sea of Moving Ice}}

While the majority of the Reghedmen tribes believed the bergs of the "Floating Land" to be forbidden, the [[Tribe of the Seal]] once attempted to settle its isles.
