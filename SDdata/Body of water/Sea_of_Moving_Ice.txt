The Sea of Moving Ice, also referred to as the Floating Land by the Reghedmen barbarians, was a collection of icebergs and frost-covered isles that floated in the waters of northwest Faerûn.
The Sea of Moving Ice was located west of Icewind Dale and northwest of the Cold Run.
Almost completely uncharted, the ice masses set wide enough apart for a ship to pass. The ice of the sea changed so that all but the most experienced seafarers could be caught off guard. Proof of such are a collection of ancient ice-locked ships.
