The '''River of Shadows''' was a rocky and treacherous waterway located in the nation of [[Mulhorand]].

==Geography==
The River of Shadows flowed west from its origin near the [[Sword Mountains (Mulhorand)|Sword Mountains]]. Its waters emptied into the [[Alamber Sea]] near the nation's capital city of [[Skuld]], from which the river derived its name.

==Inhabitants==
Slave farms could be found near the delta of the River of Shadows, where they produced [[flax]], papyrus, and sheep. The waterway passed the cities of Skuld and [[Jhalhoran]] as it flowed towards the sea.
