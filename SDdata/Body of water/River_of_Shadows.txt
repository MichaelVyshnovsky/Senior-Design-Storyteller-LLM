The River of Shadows was a rocky and treacherous waterway located in the nation of Mulhorand.
The River of Shadows flowed west from its origin near the Sword Mountains. Its waters emptied into the Alamber Sea near the nations capital city of Skuld, from which the river derived its name.
Slave farms could be found near the delta of the River of Shadows, where they produced flax, papyrus, and sheep. The waterway passed the cities of Skuld and Jhalhoran as it flowed towards the sea.
