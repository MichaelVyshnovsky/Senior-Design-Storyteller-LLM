The Uppuk River was the largest and longest river found within the Great Glacier.
The Uppuk River flowed west from the Nakalpgotak Sea for hundreds of miles across the middle of the Great Glacier, acting as a natural boundary between the Alpuk and Nakvaligach regions. Tributaries from the Uppuk flowed into both the Lugotak Sea and the Igotak Sea.
The Uppuk River was very wide. At its narrowest it was still  in width and up to  at its widest point. Its depth ranged from  to .
The river was usually covered in pack ice. Pack ice coverage was lowest during the short summer. The river cut into the permafrost of the Great Glacier, leaving steep banks often covered in piles of icy slush. At some points the river flowed between two near-vertical walls of permafrost.
While there were no bridges built across the mighty river, two massive natural bridges of ice provided a crossing point. Both bridges were up to  in width and rose up to  above the river.
