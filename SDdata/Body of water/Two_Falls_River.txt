Two Falls River was a tributary of the River of Ice in Calimshan.
The river began from springs high in the central Marching Mountains and flowed to the south.
As it flowed south, Two Falls River was pressed between the walls of two cliffs, increasing the flow of its current. The river received its name from a series of two waterfalls along its course. The first, Bottle Falls seemed to swallow the river whole, as the waters poured into a bottle-shaped lava tube. The waters of the river reappeared again a third of a mile southwest, erupting out of the earth at a hillside to form the second "falls".
As they continued still south, the waters carved a deep canyon, before they joined with those of Bakkals Creek at the Cold Eyes to form the River of Ice.
The waters of the river were refreshingly cold.
