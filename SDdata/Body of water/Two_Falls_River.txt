'''Two Falls River''' was a tributary of the [[River of Ice]] in [[Calimshan]].

==Geography==
The river began from springs high in the central [[Marching Mountains]] and flowed to the south.

==Description==
As it flowed south, Two Falls River was pressed between the walls of two cliffs, increasing the flow of its current. The river received its name from a series of two waterfalls along its course. The first, [[Bottle Falls]] seemed to swallow the river whole, as the waters poured into a bottle-shaped lava tube. The waters of the river reappeared again a third of a mile southwest, erupting out of the earth at a hillside to form the second "falls".

As they continued still south, the waters carved a deep canyon, before they joined with those of [[Bakkal's Creek]] at the [[Cold Eyes]] to form the River of Ice.

The waters of the river were refreshingly cold.
