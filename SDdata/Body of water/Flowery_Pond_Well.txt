'''Flowery Pond Well''' was a small oasis situated on the eastern half of the [[Kora Shan]] mountain range.

== Description ==
The oasis received its name from the water lilies that cover the surface of it.

The pond itself, however, was nothing but a muddy pool, shaded by some willows. This, along with it being largely out of sight, because of sitting in a low hallow, and the brackish water, made it an uninhabited, and little-used, oasis.
