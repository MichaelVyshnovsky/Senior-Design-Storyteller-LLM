Flowery Pond Well was a small oasis situated on the eastern half of the Kora Shan mountain range.
The oasis received its name from the water lilies that cover the surface of it.
The pond itself, however, was nothing but a muddy pool, shaded by some willows. This, along with it being largely out of sight, because of sitting in a low hallow, and the brackish water, made it an uninhabited, and little-used, oasis.
