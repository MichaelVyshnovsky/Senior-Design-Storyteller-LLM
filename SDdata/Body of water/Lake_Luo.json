        "mainbody": "Lake Luo was an alkaline lake located in the Valley of Embers, in central Chult, that fed the River Olung.\nDue to nearby volcanic activity the waters of Lake Luo were excessively alkaline and could not support aquatic life forms. The nearby landscape was similarly affected and resembled a barren wasteland.\nLake Luo formed upon a literal hot bed of geothermal activity. It was kept warm by subterranean volcanic vents and received a steady stream of lava from the surrounding valley.\nThe water that flowed from the lake continued into the River Olung, though by that point, its acidity and alkaline levels reached more balanced levels.\nDue to its inability to support natural life forms, only mud and steam mephits dwelled along the shores of the lake."
