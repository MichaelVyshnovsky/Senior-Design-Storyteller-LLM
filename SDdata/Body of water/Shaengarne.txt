The '''Shaengarne''' was a river that flowed from [[Maer Dualdon]] in [[Icewind Dale]] to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

==Geography==
The city of [[Bremen]] was located at the river source at the outflow of the lake. The city of [[Ironmaster]] was located at the river's mouth when it met the sea.

==Description==
Over 60 scoop-tunnels and viaducts, constructed by the [[dwarves]] of ironmaster, siphoned off the river's water for use by the city. There was also a series of elaborate spill basins and diversions constructed by the dwarves in order to ensure that the river would not cause flooding during the spring runoff.

==Inhabitants==
The inhabitants of ironmaster were often known to engage in spearfishing along the Shaengarne river.
