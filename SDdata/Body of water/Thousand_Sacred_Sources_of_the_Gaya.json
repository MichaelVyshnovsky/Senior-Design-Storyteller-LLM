Fed by the great [[Jumpa River]], its many tributaries and sources lay throughout the [[Katakoro Shan]] and the [[A-Ling Shan]] ranges of the [[Yehimal]] and the facing plains. These rivers were considered sacred in the [[Padhran religion]] and were a path of pilgrimage for the faithful. They visited sacred sites along each river.\n\nThe primary rivers of the Sacred Sources were:\n* The [[Jumpa River]]\n* The [[Gogrus River]]\n* The [[Dharbang River]]\n* The [[Akundi River]].\nOther rivers that fed these and the Gaya included:\n* The [[Shyok River]]."
