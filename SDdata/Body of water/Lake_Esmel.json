        "mainbody": "'''Lake Esmel''' was a famous lake in the nation of [[Amn]], being the largest freshwater lake in the [[Lands of Intrigue]].",
        "Description": "The waters of the lake were dark blue, except in the western shallows, where mineral springs gave it a sea green color. The deepest parts were near the eastern and southern shores; near the northern shores, the depth was close to 100 feet (30 meters), but after only a half mile, the bottom dropped severely.\n\nThe waters of the eastern half of the lake were especially cold, These springs were predominantly in [[Akarav's Bay]] and filled the air with a strong scent of sulfur.\n\nThe lake was suitable for boating, swimming, and fishing, and the waters were calm, as storms were relatively rare here. For these reasons, the region around the lake was popular as a resort area. To not disturb the tourists, most fishing was done away from the region of [[Esmeltaran]].\n\nWhere the [[Amstel River]] entered the lake, red clay was abundant, which was used in making pottery or sculptures.",
        "Geography": "Located on the eastern half of Amn and southeast of the city Esmeltaran, Lake Esmel was a way-point that connected the [[Sea of Swords]] to the [[Snakewood]] and the [[Troll Mountains]]. It was directly fed by four rivers rivers flowing down from both the [[Cloud Peaks]] in the north and the [[Small Teeth]] in the south. It was also fed by hot springs on its fourth side.",
        "Flora & Fauna": "Because of the wide variety of temperatures in the lake, its waters were full of a wide variety of fishes. One species of fish, the [[dunchow]] was only to be found here. It was served as a special dish at most inns in Esmeltaran and was a delicacy throughout Amn.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Akarav's Bay": "This northwestern bay of the lake was where the greatest concentration of hot springs were found.",
            "Amstel River": "One of the major rivers feeding the lake, the Amstel River carried with it much barge traffic from the east.",
            "[[Esmel River]]": "This river was the outlet of Lake Esmel and flowed to the ocean.",
            "Esmeltaran": "This was possibly the most beautiful city of Amn.",
            "[[Hyrzashyr]]": "This was the southernmost river feeding the lake.",
            "The [[Scimitar (settlement)|Scimitar]]": "This resort community is located on a scimitar-shaped peninsula on Akarav's Bay.",
            "[[Shimmalshyr]]": "This was also one of the four rivers feeding the lake."

        "Rumors & Legends": "[[File:Esmelda.png|thumb|right|280px|''A pair of boaters are passed under by \"[[Esmelda]]\".'']]\nA monster (or several monsters) were rumored to live at the bottom of Lake Esmel. This creature was called \"[[Esmelda]]\" by the locals. Many claimed to have seen the creature, and it was blamed for the loss of several boats over the years, though most people did not believe the tales. Some suspected that the supposed sightings were simply of the [[red dragon]] [[Balagos]].\n\nWhile it was true that Balagos often bathed in Lake Esmel, the \"Monster of the Lake\" was actually more than a dozen [[Pythosaurus|pythosaurs]] who lived in the deepest, coldest waters. They had been living in the lake since the days of the [[creator race]]s.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], most people still did not understand that pythosaurs lived in the lake, and claims of a powerful [[dragon]] lairing there persisted. Some claimed that the dragon was red, while others said that it was [[Copper dragon|copper]]."
