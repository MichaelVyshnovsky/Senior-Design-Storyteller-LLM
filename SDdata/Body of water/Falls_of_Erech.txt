The '''Falls of Erech''' was a waterfall system found in northern [[Rashemen]].

==Geography==
The waterfall was located where the River Erech emptied into the northern expanse of [[Lake Ashane]] just south of the [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]] and [[Mistbridge]].

==Description==
The falls plunged for hundreds of feet into Lake Ashane, creating a massive white plume of mist.

==History==
It was tradition for youths participating in their [[dajemma]] to camp near the Falls of Erech for at least one night and cast offerings to the spirits and gods into the falls.

==Rumors & Legends==
The falls were rumored to be protected by powerful magic, punishing any who took offerings from the water and rewarding those who displayed proper respect.
