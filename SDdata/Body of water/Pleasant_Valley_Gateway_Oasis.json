        "mainbody": "Pleasant Valley Gateway Oasis was located at the southern end of the Glittering Spires mountains in the Hordelands.\nThis green valley was fed by glacial run-off that formed a small lake that slowly drained the excess water deep underground.\nA group of elves from Sossal settled the valley after fleeing from their cold homeland to begin their own society. The elves desired harmony with nature as well as their neighbors. Violence was always their last resort. Because of this, they were often mocked and targeted by their closest neighborsâ€”the Tuigan and Zamogedi."
