The '''Foreigners' Sea''', also known as '''Bahr al-Ajami''' to native [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] or the '''Segara Sea''' to natives of [[Kara-Tur]], was found due east of mainland [[Zakhara]] and south of the [[Yehimal Mountains]].<ref name ="TFRA.p17">

==Geography==
The Foreigners' Sea was nestled in the giant shadow of the Yehimal Mountains inland, connecting the continent of Zakhara to the rest of the eastern world by sea as the mountain range did by land. Its waters covered the geographical regions of both [[east Zakhara|east]] and [[Northeast Zakhara|northeast]] Zakhara, beginning in the south where the [[Crowded Sea]] ended at the island of [[Afyal]] and continuing north and west into the vast empires of the east.<ref name ="TFRA.p17"/>
