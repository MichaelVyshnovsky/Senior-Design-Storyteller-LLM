        "mainbody": "he Sea of Dlurg, or Etalis among inhabitants of its depths, The majority of its waters were considered the territory of Aglarond.\nthumb|The Sea of Dlurgs southern edge.|460x460px\nThe Sea of Dlurg was a calm body of water, sheltered from storms of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The other shores of the sea were marked by magnificent, steep, and high Dragonjaw Mountains that stretched into Cape Dragonfang to the Sea of Dlurgs northwest. At its narrowest point – roughly halfway between the main body of the Inner Sea and the eastern edge of the bay, the southern and northern shores of the Sea of Dlurg were only fifteen miles apart.\nThe seas waters were some of the richest in aquatic life in the entire Sea of Fallen Stars, with almost no dangers or hostile inhabitants.\nThe Sea of Dlurgs connection to the River Umber made it busy with trade and fishing vessels from the settlements on the seas shores, as well as Nethjet and Nethentir of Thay up the river.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the nation of Thay used the Sea of Dlurg as its shipping lane to the Inner Sea. During active military conflicts, the passage was barred by the Aglarondan fortress of Emmech.\nWith the advent of the Spellplague, the Sea of Fallen Stars lost a significant amount of its waters, and with it, the Sea of Dlurg retreated, removing access to the Inner Sea from its coastal settlements.\nDuring the Second Sundering in the autumn of the , the Great Rain began to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued unceasingly for over a year. This constant storm caused massive floods thousands perished from drowning, lightning strikes, or bursts of wind that capsized ships. By the time the rain abated, the Sea of Fallen Stars had swollen back to its former size, restoring the Sea of Dlurg to its former state.\nSeveral notable settlements stood on the shores of the Sea of Dlurg. Towns of Dlusk and Osker took the seas Aglarondan side, and in Thesk – the city of Milvarune in the Dragonjaw Mountains. All of these settlements fished in the Sea of Dlurg, making the bay their primary food source."
