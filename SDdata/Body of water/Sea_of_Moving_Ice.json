        "mainbody": "The Sea of Moving Ice, also referred to as the Floating Land by the Reghedmen barbarians, was a collection of icebergs and frost-covered isles that floated in the waters of northwest Faerûn.\nThe Sea of Moving Ice was located west of Icewind Dale and northwest of the Cold Run.\nAlmost completely uncharted, the ice masses set wide enough apart for a ship to pass. The ice of the sea changed so that all but the most experienced seafarers could be caught off guard. Proof of such are a collection of ancient ice-locked ships.\nthumb|right|250px|Location of the Sea of Moving Ice.\nLandmarks\n* Angajuks Bell, a favored landmark that allowed some travelers to get the attention of the beloved sperm whale Angajuk.\n*Black Ice Tower, the lone spire that served as home to the Ice Witch, Hedrun Arnsfirth.\n* Dark Duchess, this abandoned pirate ship held a portion of the hoard belonging to the famous white dragon Arveiaturace.\n* Oyaviggaton, an iceberg that was claimed by the dragon Arauthator.\n* Solstice, a snowflake-shaped isle that housed the frost giant fortress of Grimskalle.\nSettlements\n* Karffbadh, since Encased in ice, this frost giant settlement was once one of the four great cities of the Jhothûn empire.\n* Revels End, the Lords Alliance prison used to house the most heinous of criminals, along with those that proved to be the most dangerous of threats.\n* Svardborg, another giant settlement that was reclaimed after being hidden away among icebergs.\nAlong with seals, walruses and polar bears, the Sea of Moving Ice was also home to other dangers. Lairs of ice trolls could be found in errant shipwrecks, and white dragons often made home within larger icebergs.\nFew humans made their home among the icy bergs. Among the few that did were the nomadic Ice Hunter tribes, and whalers who dwelled upon the seas icy shores.\nIn the , the arcanists of Ythryn found a mysterious stone spindle that beneath the seam, an artifact that dated back to the ancient kingdom of Ostoria.\nThe Waterdhavian whale hunter Jendren Uruth made regular excursions into the sea in search of ambergris during the late 1480s DR.\nA portal in the Sea of Moving Ice led to the High Ice in north Faerûn. It was protected by the orc druid Thurghom.\nWhile the majority of the Reghedmen tribes believed the bergs of the \"Floating Land\" to be forbidden, the Tribe of the Seal once attempted to settle its isles."
