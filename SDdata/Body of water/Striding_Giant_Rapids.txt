The Striding Giant Rapids was the name for a sections of rapids located around a petrified giant in the middle of the River Rauvin, just downriver from Everlund.
Striding Giant Rapids was located just out of sight and to the west of Everlund in the Rauvin Vale.
The Striding Giant was a statue (in fact, a petrified hill giant) of a giant stepping through the waters of the river. The statue caused a "snag" in the river.
Rumors of a terrible fate for anyone who disturbed the Striding Giant ensured that the obstacle was not removed from the river.
