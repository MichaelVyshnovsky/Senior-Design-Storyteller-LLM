The '''Striding Giant Rapids''' was the name for a sections of rapids located around a [[Flesh to stone|petrified]] [[giant]] in the middle of the [[River Rauvin]], just downriver from [[Everlund]].

==Geography==
Striding Giant Rapids was located just out of sight and to the west of Everlund in the [[Rauvin Vale]].

==Description==
The Striding Giant was a statue (in fact, a petrified [[hill giant]]) of a giant stepping through the waters of the river. The statue caused a "snag" in the river.

==History==
Rumors of a terrible fate for anyone who disturbed the Striding Giant ensured that the obstacle was not removed from the river.
