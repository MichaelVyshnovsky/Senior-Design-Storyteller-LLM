The '''River Erech''' was a small waterway found in northern [[Rashemen]].

==Geography==
The River Erech originated in the [[Icerim Mountains]] and the [[Teardrops]] in eastern [[Narfell]]. It flowed south into Rashemen to connect with the northern shore of [[Lake Ashane]] at the [[Falls of Erech]]. The river served as a border between the [[North Country]] in Rashemen and Narfell to the west.

The [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]] crossed over the River Erech at the [[Mistbridge]].
