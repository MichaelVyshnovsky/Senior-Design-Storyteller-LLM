The River Erech was a small waterway found in northern Rashemen.
The River Erech originated in the Icerim Mountains and the Teardrops in eastern Narfell. It flowed south into Rashemen to connect with the northern shore of Lake Ashane at the Falls of Erech. The river served as a border between the North Country in Rashemen and Narfell to the west.
The Long Road crossed over the River Erech at the Mistbridge.
