        "History": "The river became the border between Tethyr and Calimshan in the {{YearlinkName|-150}}, when the [[syl-pasha]] of [[Calimport]], [[Kamus el Tarshaj]], ceded the lands of [[Monrativi Teshy Mir]] over to Tethyrâ€”supposedly as a reward for Tethyr's assistance in the Eye Tyrant Wars more than a decade earlier."
