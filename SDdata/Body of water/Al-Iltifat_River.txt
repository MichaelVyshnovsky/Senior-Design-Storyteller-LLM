Al-Iltifat River was one of the mightiest rivers in the Cities of the Ancients in East Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Al-Iltifat wound for hundreds of miles from the fringes of the barren Haunted Lands, through the jungles of the Ruined Kingdoms before finally emptying into the Crowded Sea where it met the Salt Jungle.
The course of the river changed constantly as it meandered through the terrain on its way to the sea.
