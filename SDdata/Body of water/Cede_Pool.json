        "Description": "The pool was the source of the [[Cede Run]], an unusually pure and clear river. [[Jannathan]]s believed that the pool was a blessed site and that it provided prophetic dreams and visions to those who visited, and a great many [[pilgrim]]s arrived every [[summer solstice]] after passing through the friendly [[Amaunator]]-aligned town of [[Trinity]]. Skeptics maintained that the visions were mere delusions brought on by a waterborne taint, even though the water source was renowned for its purity."
