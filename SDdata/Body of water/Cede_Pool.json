        "mainbody": "Cede Pool was a body of water in the Shinantra Mountains that was a holy site of Jannath during the time of ancient Netheril.\nThe pool was the source of the Cede Run, an unusually pure and clear river. Jannathans believed that the pool was a blessed site and that it provided prophetic dreams and visions to those who visited, and a great many pilgrims arrived every summer solstice after passing through the friendly Amaunator-aligned town of Trinity. Skeptics maintained that the visions were mere delusions brought on by a waterborne taint, even though the water source was renowned for its purity."
