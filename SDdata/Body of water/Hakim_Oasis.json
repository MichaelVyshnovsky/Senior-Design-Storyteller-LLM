        "mainbody": "The Hakim Oasis was found near the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara.\nThe oasis was located  southwest of Tajar along the western edge of al-Yabki Mountains.\nThe Hakim Oasis was vital for caravans travelling between Gana and Tajar traversing the western side of the mountains. Caravans enjoyed the waters of al-Sabiya River for much of the journey, but the Hakim Oasis provided a much needed respite after al-Sabiya River terminated."
