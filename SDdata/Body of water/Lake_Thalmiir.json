        "mainbody": "Lake Thalmiir, also known as Purewaters, was a subterranean lake located in the Middledark beneath eastern Cormyr, near Sschindylryn.\nRelative to the surface, the lake lay south of the Wyvernwater and extending halfway to the Dragonmere. Lake Thalmiir had a unique torus shape when looked at vertically, characterized by fjord-like arms extending from its edges. These arms had resulted from ancient magma flows that shattered the surrounding rock. The lake resided in a large vault-like cavern with mushroom-shaped ceilings, where it was surrounded by wide but low-ceilinged caverns formed from cleavage planes in the rock. The shores of Lake Thalmiir were tiered with rock ledges, each  wide, a consequence of the cleavage planes in the rock. The shores were shaped rather like \"steps\" around the lake.\nA portal on the northwestern shore provided an \"easy walk\" to Sschindylryn, while also leading to an ancient monastery elsewhere in the Underdark.\nThe lakes waters were warm because of the underlying magma, which supported a unique ecosystem. The warmth circulated throughout the lake, aided by the movement of fur stack fungi within its depths.\nLake Thalmiir hosted a variety of unique creatures. The depths were filled with tree-like fur stack fungi, which filtered the water and were responsible for its purity.\nAmongst other creatures, the lake was inhabited by sightless black eels up to over  long, luslar fish, and freshwater eyes of the deep.\nLake Thalmiir was named after Thalmiir, a thaalud that had been interred there over a millennium prior to the . Cave fishers had held the area, until they were eradicated by drow, at a very high cost in lives. Since then, Lake Thalmiir had been contested by drow and mind flayers, both seeking control over the area.\nIn the , a fierce battle occurred between a deep dragon and the defenders of Sschindylryn over the lake. Although the dragon was eventually driven away, it resulted in the loss of hundreds of combatants, some of them sorcerers and priestesses of Lolth. The drow left the enchanted accoutrements of their fallen in the waters throughout every conflict, rather than disturbing the possessions of the dead.\n* Mralrynx Arzhund, a Netherese lich.\n* Xaughvulnaar, an undead elder brain.\n* Drythroat A natural rock trench through which the lake overflowed into Daerbraun.\n* Daerbraun A pit-shaped lake named after a drow war leader who perished in its waters. It received overflow from Lake Thalmiir and drained into the Lowerdark.\n* Portal A portal on the northwestern shore led to an ancient, abandoned drow monastery.\nRarely, thaluud came to Lake Thalmiir believing that guidance from Thalmiirs spirit could be found there.\nElminster himself advised against venturing there, citing the numerous threats that outweighed the potential rewards."
