The Great Imphras River was a system of three rivers found in Damara and Impiltur.
The source of the river in Damara.
The Great Imphras River flowed south from Lake Mogador in central Damara, joined with its first major tributary, the Sidewinder River, before leaving Damara, and then in Impiltur it merged with the River Icehilt and its second major tributary, the River Lench, before emptying into Traders Bay and the Easting Reach beyond.
Prior to the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the river had rough sections of dangerous white water that made it ill-suited to all but the most daring or desperate of merchants.
