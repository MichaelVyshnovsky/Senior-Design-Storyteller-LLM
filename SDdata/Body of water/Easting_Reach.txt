The '''Easting Reach''' was a wide expanse of water at the northeast edge of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It was calm and predictable, and was therefore well suited to trade. The city of [[Sarshel]] lay at its mouth.

==Settlements==
In [[Impiltur]], [[Sarshel]] was on the west bank of the Easting Reach at its mouth, and [[Kielbast]] was a little further north. [[Ilmwatch]] was even further to the north, and [[Buzzard Beak Harbor]] lay just south of there. [[Uthmere]] was on the eastern side of the Reach adjacent to Ilmwatch, and the [[Soleine River]] flowed into the Reach at its northernmost point.
