The Springbrook was the river that flowed from the Elder Spires at the center of Iligh√¥n and ended in a shallow pool of the Springbrook Shallows.
The Springbrook was born in the Elder Spires, in a plateau at the islands center. From the Oakenhall plateau, the Springbrook cascaded majestically off the mountains and ran west, approximately  until growing into the Springbrook Shallows.
