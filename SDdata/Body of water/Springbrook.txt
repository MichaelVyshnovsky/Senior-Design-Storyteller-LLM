The '''Springbrook''' was the river that flowed from the [[Elder Spires]] at the center of [[Iligh么n]] and ended in a shallow pool of the [[Springbrook Shallows]].

==Description==
The Springbrook was born in the Elder Spires, in a plateau at the island's center. From the [[Oakenhall]] plateau, the Springbrook cascaded majestically off the mountains and ran west, approximately {{SI|6|mi|k|long=yes}} until growing into the Springbrook Shallows.
