        "mainbody": "The Falls of Erech was a waterfall system found in northern Rashemen.\nThe waterfall was located where the River Erech emptied into the northern expanse of Lake Ashane just south of the Long Road and Mistbridge.\nThe falls plunged for hundreds of feet into Lake Ashane, creating a massive white plume of mist.\nIt was tradition for youths participating in their dajemma to camp near the Falls of Erech for at least one night and cast offerings to the spirits and gods into the falls.\nThe falls were rumored to be protected by powerful magic, punishing any who took offerings from the water and rewarding those who displayed proper respect."
