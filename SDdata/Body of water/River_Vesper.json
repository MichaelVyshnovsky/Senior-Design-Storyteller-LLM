        "mainbody": "The '''River Vesper''' was a river in the [[Vast]] that ran from the [[Earthspur Mountains]] to the [[Dragon Reach]].{{Cite web/More of the Underdark and the Vast|}}",
        "Geography": "The River Vesper began in the Earthspur Mountains\n\nThe town of [[King's Reach]] marked the highest navigable point on the river.\n\nThe River Vesper could be forded at [[Viperstongue Ford]]. As this coincided with the Viperstongue pass through the mountains, it was a strategic crossing.\n\nThe river emptied into the Dragon Reach in a wide delta, called the Vespermouth. In high summer, its banks turned into fields of stinking mud, producing clams and worms. The city of [[Calaunt]], formerly a village known as \"Vespermouth\", sat at the mouth of the Vesper.",
        "Activities": "The Vesper was a major trade route for goods exported from the Vast. However, it also offered off-road travel for [[orc]]s, [[thief|thieves]], and [[adventurer]]s trying to avoid notice without getting lost. Some also sailed up the river to raid inland settlements.",
        "Rumors & Legends": {
            "Treasure": "An occasional curious sight on the Vesper was a collection of ''[[ioun stone]]''s hovering above the water. Sightings were reported the full length of the river, but only began in the 1350s [[DR]]. A dozen glowing, twinkling stones were seen dancing in a slowly turning ring, some 6 feet (1.8 meters) or so above the water and moving here and there across it. The stones avoided efforts to grab them, and by [[1370 DR]], no one with a net, the ability to fly or a magical means of catching one was lucky enough to spot the ring. There was no known explanation for the phenomena, but a tale told in riverside taverns claimed that anyone who could grab one of the ''ioun stone''s could keep it, but was also compelled by a ''[[geas]]'' to perform some dangerous task, with a different task for each stone.\n\nVery rarely, [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[gold]] washed down the river, likely from a flooded tomb-cavern or the legendary gold-caves of the [[Giantspike Mountains]].",
            "Monsters": "Some pirates and sailors, fearful of putting into Calaunt, believed that there were certain creatures haunting the Vesper, and that they cursed a sailor who crossed them with bad luck.\n\nRumors of monsters in Calaunt were helped along by occasional sightings of odd [[shark]]-like fins glimpsed moving through the mud of the Vespermouth delta, suggested to belong to a [[bulette]]."
