        "Geography": "Al-Sari originated in the foothills of the southwest tail of the [[Furrowed Mountains]]. It flowed on a northwestern course until reaching Liham and the [[Great Sea]].",
        "Features": "Two stone bridges crossed the river as it wound its way through the [[Furrowed Mountains]]. These bridges were easily destroyed by removing key stones if the hill tribes inhabiting the region were ever threatened. [[Al-Badia]] trading along the banks of the river gave the hill tribes a wide berth to avoid any unwanted debacles.",
        "History": "Al-Sari River was used to transport goods from Liham across the hinterlands to the people inhabiting the regions of the Furrowed Mountains."
