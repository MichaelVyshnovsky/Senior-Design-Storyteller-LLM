        "mainbody": "Al-Sari River divided the city of Liham in North Zakhara.\nAl-Sari originated in the foothills of the southwest tail of the Furrowed Mountains. It flowed on a northwestern course until reaching Liham and the Great Sea.\nTwo stone bridges crossed the river as it wound its way through the Furrowed Mountains. These bridges were easily destroyed by removing key stones if the hill tribes inhabiting the region were ever threatened. Al-Badia trading along the banks of the river gave the hill tribes a wide berth to avoid any unwanted debacles.\nAl-Sari River was used to transport goods from Liham across the hinterlands to the people inhabiting the regions of the Furrowed Mountains."
