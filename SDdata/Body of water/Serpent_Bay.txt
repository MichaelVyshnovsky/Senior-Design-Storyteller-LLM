Serpent Bay was nestled between the two southern peninsulas of the Cities of the Ancients region in east Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Roughly rectangular in shape, Serpent Bay was naturally sheltered from the harsh weather of the Crowded Sea, making it an ideal spot for mariners to moor were it not for the terrors lurking beneath the waters surface.
The waters of Serpent Bay shone with azure color thanks to its shallow basin.
True to its name, Serpent Bay was home to countless serpents, sahuagin and other ocean terrors.
