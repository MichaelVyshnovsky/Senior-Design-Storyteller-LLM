The '''Cauldron of Blue Fire''' was a subterranean [[plagueland]] lake located in the depths of the [[Chasm]] of [[Neverwinter]].

==Description==
The Cauldron of Blue Fire was a lake located within a cavern of roughly 500 feet (152 meters) in diameter, below the [[Plaguechanged Warrens]]. Deep within the lake was the small plagueland the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] sought to study and cultivated.

The dreaded [[Symphony of Madness]] was also located within the Cauldron.

==Inhabitants==
The Cauldron of Blue Fire was home to a cell of the Abolethic Sovereignty studying the plagueland. They also had there a few of their [[plaguechanged]] experiments to help them watch the lake, as well as the newest prisoners they had kidnapped to experiment with.

==History==
At some point before [[1467 DR]], a branch of the Abolethic Sovereignty discovered the Cauldron of Blue Fire and became interested in the small plagueland below Neverwinter. They began to use it to further the experiments that would aid them to create the Symphony of Madness.

At some point in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]], the [[Order of Blue Fire]] took a particular interest in the Chasm, claiming large swaths of it in the name of their mysterious master. Alarmed by this, [[Scar Company]] called upon the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to descend into the depths of the Chasm and fight with plaguechanged creatures and blue fire cultists alike. When the heroes finally reach the bottom, they discovered the [[Twisted Fane]] and, after a difficult battle, were able to defeat the [[foulspawn]] warding the place. However, it was later discovered that the Twisted Fane was not the source of the [[Spellplague]] energy.

Further investigations led the heroes to the Cauldron of Blue Fire, where the Spellplague had weakened the barriers between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Far Realm]], allowing aberrations to seep through. When they finally reached the actual bottom of the Chasm, they discovered the true identity of the Chasm's master: a powerful [[aboleth]] overseer named [[A'Drx'l]], living within the plagueland lake. After a difficult battle, the heroes were able to kill the aboleth, crippling the efforts of the Abolethic Sovereignty in Neverwinter, at least for a time.
