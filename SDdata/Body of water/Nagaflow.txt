}}The '''Nagaflow''' was a river in the country of [[Sespech]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Geography==
The source of the Nagaflow lay in the depths of of the [[Chondalwood]]. The river was described as long and lazy. After linking with the [[Wintercloak River]], it widened into a deep, freshwater lake called the [[Nagawater]], then finally drained into the [[Vilhon Reach]] near [[Nimpeth]].

==Inhabitants==
[[Naga]]s from the [[Nagawater]] often swam down the Nagaflow. The river's upper stretch was a spawning ground for all breeds of naga.

[[Giant frog]]s lived in the river near the southern edge.<ref>

Furthermore, [[Phelriss]], a [[yuan-ti]] [[yuan-ti anathema|anathema]], made its lair in the area. It was venerated as a god by a cult of [[dark naga|dark]] and [[spirit naga]]s.

==Canal==
In the 1360s and 1370s DR, the city-state of [[Innarlith]] attempted to build a canal that connected the Nagaflow to the [[Lake of Steam]] in order to create a major trade route under the city's control that would connect the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the oceans of [[Toril]]. The project was clandestinely opposed by both the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards of Thay,]] both of which had much to lose if this trade route was created in competition with their own routes and services. Ransar [[Pristoleph]] defeated the opposition, however, and in [[1374 DR]] ordered the project to be completed.  <ref>
