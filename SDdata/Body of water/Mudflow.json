        "mainbody": "he Mudflows were strange rivers of warm mud that were more common in the eastern and southern regions of the Sword Lands, Laerakond.\nThe mudflows released dangerous gases that caused dizziness or, with prolonged exposure, even death. The waters of the mudflows eventually cooled and later detonated in strange storms of mud that blew up ores of strange metals in the surrounding areas. Swordlanders sought out the mudflows because of that."
