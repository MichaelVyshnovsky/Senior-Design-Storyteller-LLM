        "mainbody": "The '''River Tching''' was a small river found in northwestern [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Geography": "The River Tching was formed from numerous creeks originating in the [[Tching Mountains]]. It flowed south and east to empty into the [[Thingulph]] south of [[Lundeth (Thindol)|Lundeth]].",
        "Description": "This river lacked the boat traffic and other signs of commerce presents on Thindol's other rivers. As it flowed toward the Thingulph the River Tching fed several stagnant marshes. The mouth of the River Tching was a delta spanning several miles.",
        "Inhabitants": "Thindol's few remaining tribes of [[lizardfolk]] were found along the length of the River Tching. The [[human]]s in the area tolerated the lizardfolk as long as they kept their activities near the river banks.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The lizardfolk were actually the eyes of the [[House Sseradess|Sseradess]] in the region, relaying messages back to the [[yuan-ti]] on a regular basis. The lizardfolk also ferried messages and goods on behalf of the yuan-ti to [[Narubel]]."
