The '''River Athis''' was a river in the [[Raurin]] fed by a magical spring in [[Terbakar]]. The spring dried out with the dying curse of the pharaoh [[Amun-Re]], depopulating [[Bakar]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|4}}

==Overview==
The River Athis was fed by a magical spring, which teleported water into its basin. As of {{yearlink|1356}}, the source of the water was within the [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|40}} The river followed a sinuous, northerly path, crossing through [[Pazar]], the sacred [[Oasis of the White Palm]], the city of [[Phoenix (city)|Carthag (later renamed Phoenix)]], and further north, where it was joined by the waters of the [[Me'at Halwa]]{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|94}} on its way to the lands where [[Martek]] made his kingdom.

Within the Pyramid of Amun-Re, the waters of the River Athis had magical healing properties.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|45}}

==History==
