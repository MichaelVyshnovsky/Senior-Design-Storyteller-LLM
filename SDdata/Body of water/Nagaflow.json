        "mainbody": "he Nagaflow was a river in the country of Sespech in the Vilhon Reach.\nThe source of the Nagaflow lay in the depths of of the Chondalwood. The river was described as long and lazy. After linking with the Wintercloak River, it widened into a deep, freshwater lake called the Nagawater, then finally drained into the Vilhon Reach near Nimpeth.\nNagas from the Nagawater often swam down the Nagaflow. The rivers upper stretch was a spawning ground for all breeds of naga.\nGiant frogs lived in the river near the southern edge.\nFurthermore, Phelriss, a yuan-ti anathema, made its lair in the area. It was venerated as a god by a cult of dark and spirit nagas.\nIn the 1360s and 1370s DR, the city-state of Innarlith attempted to build a canal that connected the Nagaflow to the Lake of Steam in order to create a major trade route under the citys control that would connect the Sea of Fallen Stars to the oceans of Toril. The project was clandestinely opposed by both the Zhentarim and the Red Wizards of Thay, both of which had much to lose if this trade route was created in competition with their own routes and services. Ransar Pristoleph defeated the opposition, however, and in 1374 DR ordered the project to be completed."
