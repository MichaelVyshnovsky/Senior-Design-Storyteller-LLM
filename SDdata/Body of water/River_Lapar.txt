The River Lapar was found in the heart of Tashalar on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
The River Lapar originated on the southern end of the Lapal Sea. It flowed south for approximately  through dense jungles before reaching the Great Sea and emptying into the Lapalgulph. The river served as the southern border between the Black Jungles in the west and the Mhair Jungles in the east.
Yuan-ti from House Jennestas patrolled the jungles around the River Lapar.
