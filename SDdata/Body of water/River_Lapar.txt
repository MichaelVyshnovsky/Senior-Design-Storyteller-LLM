The '''River Lapar''' was found in the heart of [[Tashalar]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The River Lapar originated on the southern end of the [[Lapal Sea]]. It flowed south for approximately {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} through dense jungles before reaching the [[Great Sea]] and emptying into the [[Lapalgulph]]. The river served as the southern border between the [[Black Jungles]] in the west and the [[Mhair Jungles]] in the east.

==Inhabitants==
[[Yuan-ti]] from [[House Jennestas]] patrolled the jungles around the River Lapar.
