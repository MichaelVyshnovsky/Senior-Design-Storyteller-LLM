The '''Semberflow''' was a river in the [[Cormanthor|Cormanthor forest]].On page 7 of the Cormanthor booklet of [[Elminster's Ecologies]], the Semberflow is called a ''stream'', yet in the Settled Lands section of Elminster's Ecologies, it is stated as being a ''river''. Also, page 96 of [[Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves]], names the Semberflow as a ''river''.
