        "mainbody": "Al-Tariq Channel, also called the Passage, was a strait found in North Zakhara connecting the Sea of Caravans and the North Quarter of Suq Bay.\nThe Passage stretched for over a hundred miles between the two larger bodies of water. Its southern face was shadowed by the steep cliffs of the Spine of the Dog. Flat grasslands and fertile river basins were found on the northern shore in the foothills of the Furrowed Mountains.\nAl-Tariq served as an important shipping lane, allowing trade between Qudra and the Free Cities with the Cities of the Heart."
