        "mainbody": "Batihat al-Saji, also known as the Lagoon of the Brave, was a bay on Jazayir al-Sartan.\nThe blue waters of this lagoon were calm, concealing the terror that lay on the bottom. The husks of sunken ships could be seen when the waters were calm.\nThe water of the lagoon teemed with a variety of fish, crab, coral, and other sea life.\nA huge shimmering pearl lay at the bottom of the lagoon, serving as a portal to Pandemonium for Karrrga. The god would occasionally enter the lagoon and come to the surface to claim his offerings or destroy those who did not pay him proper obeisance."
