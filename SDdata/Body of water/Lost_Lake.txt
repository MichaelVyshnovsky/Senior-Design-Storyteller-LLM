The '''Lost Lake''' was found in [[Cormyr]] near [[Wheloon]] along the [[Way of the Manticore]].

==Description==
Though it appeared as a small valley in [[1368 DR]], the Lost Lake was in fact a lake during times past. A small stream was all that remained of the lake.

==History==
A pair of [[mage]]s engaged in a sorcerous duel at the site of the lake, eventually blasting a large opening through the rocks along the lake's southern end, allowing all of the water to escape. The mages were not fighting over [[gold]] or a rare magical artifact. Instead, they were dueling over the silver [[surlfish]] native to the lake.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Gladehap]]
