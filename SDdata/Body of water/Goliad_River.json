        "mainbody": "he Goliad River was an important waterwayÂ found in Damara in the Bloodstone Lands.\nThe Goliad flowed north to south, originating high in the Galena Mountains. The Goliad merged with the Beaumaris River at the city of Goliad before continuing south to empty into Lake Mogador in the center of Damara.\nUnless frozen solid, the waters of the Goliad River ran wide and deep.\nBecause of its size, the Goliad River was ideally suited for barges transporting goods throughout the heartland of Damara."
