        "mainbody": "he Fire River was a river in the Vast that ran from the Earthspur Mountains to the Dragon Reach.\nThe Fire River was a wide and mostly placid river that flowed west across the southern Vast, north of the Earthfast Mountains, and into the Dragon Reach and ultimately the Sea of Fallen Stars. Along its course, it was joined by a number of springs, which originated in dense stands of trees.\nThe river had its headwaters in the Earthfast Mountains It ran down through the High Country and into the Vast lowlands. \nThe only major cataract on the Fire River was a thundering waterfall near the village of Dragon Falls. There was a rope-pulled ferry across the river for merchant caravans going along the North Road, located a thousand yards above the village. However, the Dragon Falls themselves were actually a spring that cascaded over a bluff alongside the road and joined the Fire River.\nAt the town of Mossbridges was the big multi-span bridge where the Coast Road crossed the Fire River.\nAt its end, the Fire River ran between two large hills and emptied into the Dragon Reach. Here its mouth was a small and sheltered natural harbor, upon which both Sarbreen and the city of Ravens Bluff sat.\nThe waters of the Fire River held some attraction for greater sea hags.\nGoing down the Fire River, settlements on or beside it were Dragon Falls, Highbank Forest, Mossbridges, and Ravens Bluff.\nGoods were transported up and down the Fire River by barge. Logs were also floated down from forests to mills near Sarbreen.\nLegend had it that the Fire River valley had seen more new and destructive spells hurled down it than any other spot in Faer√ªn, at least after the days of Netheril.\nMalanthus Stormstaern, Magister of 154&ndash177 DR, owned a keep near the headwaters of the Fire River, in the Earthfast Mountains, but this was later destroyed in an avalanche.\nThe rampaging red dragon Halarglautha Firewings inflicted flaming destruction upon dwarf, human and orc settlements along the river, apparently giving the Fire River its name."
