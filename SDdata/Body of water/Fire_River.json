        "mainbody": "The '''Fire River''' was a river in the [[Vast]] that ran from the [[Earthspur Mountains]] to the [[Dragon Reach]].",
        "Description": "The Fire River was a wide and mostly placid river that flowed west across the southern Vast, north of the [[Earthfast Mountains]], and into the Dragon Reach and ultimately the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Along its course, it was joined by a number of springs, which originated in dense stands of trees.\n\nThe river had its headwaters in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] It ran down through the [[High Country]] and into the Vast lowlands. \n\nThe only major cataract on the Fire River was a thundering waterfall near the [[village]] of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]]. There was a rope-pulled ferry across the river for merchant caravans going along the [[North Road]], located a thousand yards above the village. However, the [[Dragon Falls (waterfall)|Dragon Falls]] themselves were actually a spring that cascaded over a bluff alongside the road and joined the Fire River.\n\nAt the town of [[Mossbridges]] was the big multi-span bridge where the [[Coast Road]] crossed the Fire River.\n\nAt its end, the Fire River ran between two large hills and emptied into the Dragon Reach. Here its mouth was a small and sheltered natural harbor, upon which both [[Sarbreen]] and the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] sat.",
        "Inhabitants": "The waters of the Fire River held some attraction for [[Sea hag|greater sea hag]]s.\n\nGoing down the Fire River, settlements on or beside it were [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]], [[Highbank Forest]], [[Mossbridges]], and [[Ravens Bluff]].",
        "Activities": "Goods were transported up and down the Fire River by barge. Logs were also floated down from forests to mills near Sarbreen.",
        "History": "Legend had it that the Fire River valley had seen more new and destructive spells hurled down it than any other spot in Faer√ªn, at least after the days of [[Netheril]].\n\n[[Malanthus Stormstaern]], [[Magister]] of [[154 DR|154]]&ndash;[[177 DR]], owned a keep near the headwaters of the Fire River, in the Earthfast Mountains, but this was later destroyed in an avalanche.\n\nThe rampaging [[red dragon]] [[Halarglautha|Halarglautha Firewings]] inflicted flaming destruction upon [[dwarf]], [[human]] and [[orc]] settlements along the river, apparently giving the Fire River its name."
