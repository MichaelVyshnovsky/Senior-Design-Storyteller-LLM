        "mainbody": "he Ama River originated in the lands of the Ama Basin and ended in the Yellow Sea.\nThe Ama River was fed by all water draining from Ulhai Shan to the north and west, and the Chigiogi Mountains to the south. It flowed west to east, eventually draining into the Yellow Sea. The river flooded during spring to the point of being unrecognizable from the surrounding marshland. It froze solid during the winter months, creating a highway for the forest tribes.\nMany spirit folk haunted the depths of the great river."
