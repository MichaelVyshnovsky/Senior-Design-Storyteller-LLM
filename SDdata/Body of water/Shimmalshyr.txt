The '''Shimmalshyr''' was a short river in [[Amn]].

==Geography==
The Shimmalshyr flowed northwest into [[Lake Esmel]].

==Description==
The Shimmalshyr was cold all year round and was one of the few in Amn to freeze solid over the winter.

The river was spring-fed. Because the waters of Lake Esmel were not drinkable, people from [[Esmeltaran]] were willing to pay for water from the Shimmalshyr springs, and sale of this water extended to [[Athkatla]] as well, This led to a profitable business for the villagers of [[Coryllvol]].

==History==
The river received its name during the time of the [[halfling]] kingdom of [[Meiritin]].

==Notable Locations==
; Coryllvol : A tiny fishing village that made most of its money from the sale of bottled spring water.
