The '''River Samar''' was the only major river within the kingdom of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The river originated in the [[Sanrach Mountains]] in northern Samarach from several smaller creeks near the town of [[Taruin]]. It flowed south for approximately {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} before emptying into the [[Great Sea]] at the [[Bay of Omgar]]. The River Samar was an important landmark in Samarach in that it blocked the dense [[Samarlogh]] for encroaching on the eastern region of the kingdom. The capital of [[Samargol]], as well as several smaller towns, were founded along its banks.

==Description==
Small farming hamlets lined the banks of the river. Massive [[dwarven]] nets blocked the mouth of the river to keep any [[yuan-ti]] or other serpent folk from traversing its waters. Smaller nets that could be raised and lowered at various checkpoints were found along the inner stretch of the river.

==Notable Locations==
* Samargol
* [[Taruin]]
