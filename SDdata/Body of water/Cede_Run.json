        "Description": "Cede Run was pure and cool, and its waters froze early in the winter but also defrosted at the start of springtime. Although it contained hardly any [[fish]], the water was not toxic or tainted in any way, but simply very pure.",
        "Geography": "The short river ran from the southern part of the [[Shinantra Mountains]] past [[Trinity]] and the [[Hidden Forest]] until it deposited into Hidden Lake. The source of Cede Run was known as [[Cede Pool]], a holy site of [[Jannath]] and a frequent target of pilgrimages."
