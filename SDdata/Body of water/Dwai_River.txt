The '''Dwai River''' was a river lying between the [[Kuong Kingdom]] and [[Laothan]] in [[Malatra]].<ref group="note">Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, the Dwai River has not been labelled on any map of Malatra. The rivers that are depicted are likely to be other named rivers.

The river ran near the coast. South of it, the densest jungle in the whole of Malatra could be found in the wide coastal strip that continued south.

The Dwai River passed by the Laothan fishing village of [[Jivatsa]], where goods from upriver were sold and [[Seng]] and [[Kuong]] met.
