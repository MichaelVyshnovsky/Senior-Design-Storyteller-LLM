        "mainbody": "The Horsewater Pool in Ashabenford was the horse pond, fed by a nearby spring, upon which city locals, nearby Dalesfolk and travelers alike would hitch up their mounts and allow them to rest and drink some water. The pond was shallow enough for horses to wade in without getting their riders wet, and wide enough to accommodate a number of mounts.\nIt was a popular locale to meet new folk, catch up on news in the Dalelands and hear the latest gossip. During the summer months this spot would feature vendors selling fruit, pickled goods and ice-cold beer."
