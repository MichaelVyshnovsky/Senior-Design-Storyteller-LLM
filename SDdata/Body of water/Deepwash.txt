The '''Deepwash''' was a freshwater lake and, as of [[1370 DR|1370]]&ndash;[[1372 DR]], the largest lake in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The northwestern stretch was known as '''Shalane Lake''' in [[Erlkazar]].

==Geography==
Deepwash lake was almost as deep as [[Lake Esmel]] in [[Amn]]. and by [[Shalane River]] flowing from the icecold [[Impresk Lake]]. The lake's main outlet was the [[Wintercloak River]]. Fishing was safest in the Shalane Lake region, because a huge [[dragon turtle]] residing in the Deepwash did not enter those waters as often.

The Shalane Lake stretch formed part of the eastern border of the barony of [[Shalanar]] in [[Erlkazar]], and the whole of the lake served as the northern border of [[Ahlarkhem]].

==Inhabitants==
The lake was very deep and was home to a very large dragon turtle, with a shell 30 feet (10 meters) in diameter, who resided near the lizardfolk city of [[Surkh]]. In Surkh, the dragon turtle was highly respected, and some even worshiped it, believing it to be an honor to be killed and eaten by it. The turtle was large enough to capsize ships and had a very high intelligence.
