Melanith Bay was found in eastern Dambrath. The bay was named for Queen Melanith who ruled Dambrath during the 11 century DR.
Melantih Bay stretched north from the Great Sea and was tucked safely away from the brunt of any violent sea storms. The River Ammath flowed into the bay from its north side near Hazuth.
