        "mainbody": "The '''River Salban''' was a small river found in western [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Geography": "Originating in an underground spring within the [[Sanrach Mountains]] on the border with [[Samarach]], the River Salban flowed briefly eastward before reaching the [[Thingulph]] and the [[Great Sea]]. The capital of [[Thindar]] was located along its banks where it met the Thingulph.",
        "Description": "The river emerged from the mountains on a cliff face high above the grasslands below, plunging downward in a massive waterfall known as [[Salban Falls]]. Once past the waterfall, the river broadened and the flow slowed down considerably.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "A side passage from the river was rumored to provide access to the [[Mines of Selgol]] and the [[Firelands]] beneath the jungles of [[Chult]]. Many brave explorers and [[adventurer]]s sought this secret trail but none returned to speak of what they discovered."
