        "mainbody": "he River Salban was a small river found in western Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.\nOriginating in an underground spring within the Sanrach Mountains on the border with Samarach, the River Salban flowed briefly eastward before reaching the Thingulph and the Great Sea. The capital of Thindar was located along its banks where it met the Thingulph.\nThe river emerged from the mountains on a cliff face high above the grasslands below, plunging downward in a massive waterfall known as Salban Falls. Once past the waterfall, the river broadened and the flow slowed down considerably.\nA side passage from the river was rumored to provide access to the Mines of Selgol and the Firelands beneath the jungles of Chult. Many brave explorers and adventurers sought this secret trail but none returned to speak of what they discovered."
