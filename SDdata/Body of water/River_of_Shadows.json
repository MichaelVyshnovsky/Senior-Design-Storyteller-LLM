Its waters emptied into the Alamber Sea near the nations capital city of Skuld, from which the river derived its name.\nSlave farms could be found near the delta of the River of Shadows, where they produced flax, papyrus, and sheep. The waterway passed the cities of Skuld and Jhalhoran as it flowed towards the sea."
