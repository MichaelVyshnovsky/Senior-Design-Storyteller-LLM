        "mainbody": "he River Angol was a long and swift river found in the Greenfields in southern Unther.\nThe River Angol was formed by a network of streams on the northern Unthangol Mountains that flowed east across the Greenfields before draining into the Alamber Sea. Its waters provided sediment for the fertile lands of the Greenfields, but the river was unpredictable in its floods, much like the River Alamber.\nThe river disappeared after the violent changes in the southern region of Unther, that occurred because of the Spellplague of 1385 DR.As the river is not seen in the official 4th edition maps."
