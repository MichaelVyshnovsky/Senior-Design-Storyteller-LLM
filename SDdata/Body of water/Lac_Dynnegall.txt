Lac Dynnegall was the only freshwater lake found on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
The lake was found along the northern edge of the Breasal Marsh near north central Moray. The Shannyth River fed the lake from its southern shore, and exited on the north shore to empty into the Sea of Moonshae. Lac Dynnegall was roughly  long.
The small village of Dynnegall was located on the lakes northeast shore. The swampy lake provided the villagers with a good supply of peat which was used for heating purposes.
