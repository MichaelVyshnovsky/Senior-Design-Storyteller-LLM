        "mainbody": "The Harmun Rapids was a section of rapids on the River Rauvin just south of Sundabar.\nThe Harmun Rapids was located downriver and out of sight of Sundabar, just before the River Icespear joined with the River Rauvin.\nThe Harmun Rapids consisted of a score of black rocks rising out of the river that appeared as fangs.\nWhen traveling downstream, the rapids could be avoided by steering a small craft with a pole or using tow-teams or skilled steering for larger craft. When traveling upstream, a tow-team or many strong polers were required to make it past the rapids."
