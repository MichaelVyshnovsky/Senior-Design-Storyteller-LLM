        "mainbody": "The '''Redrun''' was a stream located in the [[Ten Towns]] region of [[Icewind Dale]]. It drained water from [[Lac Dinneshere]] and carried over to [[Redwaters]] lake.\n\nIt was a common destination for fishermen who preferred to stay off boats.",
        "Features": "During most of the year, the Redrun was little more than a steady stream. When the ice from Kelvin's Cairn melted in the spring, the rush of fresh ice water transformed it into raging whitewater rapids.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, two fishermen traveling along the Redrun disappeared within the span of two [[tenday]]s."
