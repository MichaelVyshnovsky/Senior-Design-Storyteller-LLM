        "Geography": "A tributary of the [[Wyvernflow]] fed Rathool's Pond, though it lay within the city itself. [[Trout]] could be found in it.",
        "History": "For some centuries, Whelunians used the pond as a burial site for war heroes and those slain in battle, depositing them in the pond together with their [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s. Though the corpses decomposed, their armor and weapons took longer to rust away, turning the water orange-brown with rust.\n\nBy the mid–13th century [[DR]], Rathool's Pond was the local swimming pool and fishing hole. Nevertheless, the contaminated waters were considered unsafe for drinking or fishing, as they were suspected to cause sickness. However, the priests of [[Chauntea]] at the [[Harvest Hall]] opposed efforts to clean it up, fearing the dead would be disturbed and their spirits grow angry.\n\nThe [[elf|elven]] farmer [[Bryn Ohme Thornwood]] mentioned Rathool's Pond as an example of how some natural areas of Cormyr had been damaged by human activity.",
