The '''Khalleshyr''' was one of the rivers of the [[Esmelflow]] in [[Amn]].

==Geography==
The Khalleshyr was a major tributary of the [[Amstel River]]. It joined with that body of water at [[Trollford]]{{Amstel sources}} after flowing for 100 miles. The river began in the [[Qadim Hills]] of the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]] with the joining of the [[Fireflow]] and [[Trollstooth Run]].

==Flora & Fauna==
The river was full of [[dionnel]], a rare, golden-colored fish that was considered a delicacy to the west in [[Athkatla]]. They were very difficult to catch.
