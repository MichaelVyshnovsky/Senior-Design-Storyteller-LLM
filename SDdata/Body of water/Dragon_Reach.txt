The Dragon Reach was a northwestern fjord of the Sea of Fallen Stars that stretched between the Vast and the Dalelands. 
The name likely derived from the days, circa , when elves ruled the forested western shore, orcs were teeming to the east, and dragons laired about the Moonsea and held sway over the northern part of the Reach.
