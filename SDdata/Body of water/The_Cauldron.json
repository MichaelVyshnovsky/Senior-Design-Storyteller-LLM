        "Description": "Lava flows poured into the ash-covered waters of the Cauldron from the wastelands to the north. These flows continuously formed massive clouds of steam that combined with the surrounding smoke and ash clouds formed by the surrounding volcanoes. \n\nThe waters of the bay were far too toxic to support aquatic life. In fact, it was covered in a layer of floating ash and soot."
