        "mainbody": "The Khalleshyr was one of the rivers of the Esmelflow in Amn.\nThe Khalleshyr was a major tributary of the Amstel River. It joined with that body of water at Trollford after flowing for 100 miles. The river began in the Qadim Hills of the Troll Mountains with the joining of the Fireflow and Trollstooth Run.\nThe river was full of dionnel, a rare, golden-colored fish that was considered a delicacy to the west in Athkatla. They were very difficult to catch."
