        "Geography": "The Farshore ran south of Ilighôn, in a similar fashion to the [[Paddle Straits]], located south of the isle of [[Wavecrest]]. There were two entrances into the [[Vilhon Reach]] form the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]: through the central part of the [[Eyes of Silvanus]], sailing \"between the eyes of Silvanus\" as they said – the islands of Ilighôn and Wavecrest. The second entrance was through the risky waters of the Farshore Straits. Smaller vehicles preferred to enter through the Farshore due to its narrow size. Pirate and smuggling vessels often took advantage of large ships, rarely risking the straits' jagged rocks.\n\nDespite common use by undesirable parties, the Farshore Straits were monitored from the [[Aphrunn Mountains]], which offered a wide-open overview of the aquatic passageway."
