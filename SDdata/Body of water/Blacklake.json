        "mainbody": "'''Blacklake''' was a lake found in the city of [[Neverwinter]].",
        "Description": "The lake sat in the middle of a city park, and was large enough to support boating. During summer months, it would shrink and leave behind a smelly and muddy swamp at its edges, which would become overgrown with brambles.",
        "Geography": "The lake was located in the center of the [[Blacklake District]], which was named for it.",
        "History": {
            "Pollution": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Blacklake became utterly polluted by ash and debris from the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, as well as by filth and rubbish from the refugees and vagabonds who made their homes in nearby ruined houses. It even contained several destroyed ships. By [[1479 DR]], the lake looked more like a midden pit, overflowing with a thick, black sludge than a body of water.\n\nThat same year, the sludge even developed magical properties and gave rise to sludge-covered [[zombie]]s in the streets, suggesting it was more than mere pollution, and [[alchemist]]s like [[Hazel (individual)|Hazel]] studied the phenomenon. The cause of this transformation was apparently the corrupting power of [[Ghaunadaur]], a god of abominations and [[ooze]]s, for a self-proclaimed [[Chosen of Ghaunadaur]] later led an attack of sludge zombies on Blacklake District. He was defeated by Hazel and the [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].",
            "Restoration": "Efforts to dredge and restore the lake and surrounding park had begun in the late 1470s DR, and by the end of the decade this had become one of [[New Neverwinter]]'s goals.\n\nAs of [[1489 DR]], the lake had been significantly cleaned and cleared, and it was renamed the \"Bluelake,\" although it remains unclear to what extent this name entered into general use.{{cite web|author=[[Jeremy Crawford]]|title=Jeremy Crawford's Twitter|url=https://www.sageadvice.eu/bluelake-district-what-happened-to-blacklake/|accessdate=2021-06-25}}<ref group=\"note\">The name \"Bluelake\" is used on the 5{{th}}-edition map of Neverwinter in the ''[[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]'', page 52, set ''circa'' [[1489 DR]]. However, other products, such as the [[Neverwinter (game)|''Neverwinter'' MMO]] (which is up to date with the current D&D storyline but set ''circa'' [[1479 DR]]) and the [[Acquisitions Incorporated (sourcebook)|''Orrery of the Wanderer'']] adventure (understood to be set in [[1496 DR]]), still use the name \"Blacklake\"."
