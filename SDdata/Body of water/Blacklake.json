        "mainbody": "Blacklake was a lake found in the city of Neverwinter.\nThe lake sat in the middle of a city park, and was large enough to support boating. During summer months, it would shrink and leave behind a smelly and muddy swamp at its edges, which would become overgrown with brambles.\nThe lake was located in the center of the Blacklake District, which was named for it.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Blacklake became utterly polluted by ash and debris from the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the , as well as by filth and rubbish from the refugees and vagabonds who made their homes in nearby ruined houses. It even contained several destroyed ships. By 1479 DR, the lake looked more like a midden pit, overflowing with a thick, black sludge than a body of water.\nThat same year, the sludge even developed magical properties and gave rise to sludge-covered zombies in the streets, suggesting it was more than mere pollution, and alchemists like Hazel studied the phenomenon. The cause of this transformation was apparently the corrupting power of Ghaunadaur, a god of abominations and oozes, for a self-proclaimed Chosen of Ghaunadaur later led an attack of sludge zombies on Blacklake District. He was defeated by Hazel and the Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge.\nEfforts to dredge and restore the lake and surrounding park had begun in the late 1470s DR, and by the end of the decade this had become one of New Neverwinters goals.\nAs of 1489 DR, the lake had been significantly cleaned and cleared, and it was renamed the \"Bluelake,\" although it remains unclear to what extent this name entered into general use.The name \"Bluelake\" is used on the 5-edition map of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast Adventurers Guide, page 52, set circa 1489 DR. However, other products, such as the Neverwinter MMO (which is up to date with the current D&D storyline but set circa 1479 DR) and the Orrery of the Wanderer adventure (understood to be set in 1496 DR), still use the name \"Blacklake\"."
