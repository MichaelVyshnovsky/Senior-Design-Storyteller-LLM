'''Al-Zulma River''' was a small river found in [[North Zakhara]].

==Geography==
Al-Zulma orginated in the northern reaches of the [[Furrowed Mountains]].

==Description==
The river stretched for roughly a hundred miles, flowing north and northeast down from the mountains before reaching the coast of the [[Great Sea]] and the city of [[Utaqa]]. As with all rivers found along the coast of North Zakhara, the lands surrounding the banks of Al-Zulma as it neared the coast were highly fertile, allowing the city and its inhabitants to flourish.

==Notable Locations==
* Utaqa
