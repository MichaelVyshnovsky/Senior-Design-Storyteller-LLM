'''Maer Dualdon''' ({{Pronounce|mair|_|dew|AWL|dun|refs=}}) was a cold lake in [[Icewind Dale]]. It was the largest of the three in the region, with deep azure waters.

{{quote|''This time of year is what we Icewind Dale locals like to call "winter." Look out on the lake. You get past the Burial Isle and the whole damned thing is frozen. Any other route is directly over rough land, no trails.''|[[Rawleigh Gallaway]]}}

==Geography==
It was in the northwest region of the [[Ten Towns]], on the far end of [[Kelvin's Cairn]].

==Ecology==
The lake was a major source of [[Trout#Knucklehead|knucklehead trout]], whose bones were used in the art of [[scrimshaw]]. It was also home to families of curious [[otter]]s.

==History==
Maer Dualdon was once the main objective for everyone that made the trek to Icewind Dale.

;Settlements:
The towns of [[Bremen]], [[Targos]], [[Termalaine]], and [[Lonelywood]] were situated on its silvery banks.

Circa [[1269 DR]] the [[Accursed Tower]] of [[Damien Morienus]], a former master of theÂ [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], stood on the western bank of the lake across from [[Lonelywood]]. It disappeared during the event called [[Great Thaw|the Great Thaw]], later in [[1369 DR]] the tower was discovered by a group of adventurers, sunken deep into the ground, still accessible via the circle of stones on Maer Dualdon's bank (actually the top part of one of the tower's spires).

==Rumors & Legends==
A traveling [[wizard]], who passed [[Bryn Shander]] in [[1281 DR]], claimed that Maer Dualdon's waters were warm because of a pit to [[Hells]] under its lakebed. The wizard also claimed that one day Maer Dualdon would turn into a like of fire.
