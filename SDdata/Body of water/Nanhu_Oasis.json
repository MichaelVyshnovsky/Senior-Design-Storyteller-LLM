        "Description": "Located east of the [[Teyla Shan]] mountain range, Nanhu Oasis was a small, shallow, lake covered in reeds.\n\nDue to the shortage of wells and other oasis in the region, Nanhu Oasis was an important stop for the caravans that went through the [[Fergana Pass]] out of [[Semphar]] to reach the [[Silk Road]].\n\nDuring the summer, the lake was known to sometimes dry up, though water could often still be found by digging a little below the surface. No settlements were located along the lake due to its inconstant water supply.\n\nAn [[ubbe]] lived at the lake around [[1359 DR]].",
