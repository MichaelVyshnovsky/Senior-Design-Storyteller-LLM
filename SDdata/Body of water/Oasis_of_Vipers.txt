}}The '''Oasis of Vipers''' was an old, well-watered set of three pools in [[Anauroch]] that was mostly ignored by the [[Bedine]].

==Geography==
This oasis was located near the northernmost border of [[the Sword]]. It consistent of three separate small pools.

==Flora and Fauna==
The oasis had a large variety of plant life: [[wikipedia:en:Fouquieria columnaris|boojum trees]], [[wikipedia:en:Fouquieria splendens|ocotillos]], and other small cacti; [[wikipedia:en:Acacia|acacia]], palm, and [[wikipedia:en:Tamarix|tamarisk]] trees; and [[wikipedia:en:Tribulus terrestris|puncture vines]]. The vines formed a thick underbrush and webbing among the trees and concealed the bones of many dead creatures, including [[camel]]s and [[human]]s.

The oasis was home to hundreds of extremely poisonous [[snake|serpents]], which hunted each other and any life that attempted to drink water from any of the pools. Because of this, there was a complete absence of birds, [[lizard]]s, or rodents common to other oases.
