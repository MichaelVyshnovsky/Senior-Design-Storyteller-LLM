The River Estan was a small waterway found Semphar in east Faer√ªn and the Hordelands.
The River Estan originated deep within the northeast and eastern areas of the Shalhoond and the northern fringes of Teyla Shan. Many unnamed tributaries joined within the forest to form the main body of the river. The River Estan flowed southwest out of the forest to empty into Gbor Nor. The city of Estanil lay on its southern bank where it met Gbor Nor.
