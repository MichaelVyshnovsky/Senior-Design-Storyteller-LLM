Horse Pond was a pond in Amphail on the Sword Coast.
It was a muddy pond containing frogs and water lilies, and it was used for drinking and washing water for horses.
In the midâ€“14th century DR, there was an incident in which skeletons ventured out of the pond and ran amok through the village, strangling people before they were destroyed.
There was a legend that at the bottom of the pond there was a hidden entrance to the tomb of the Maiden King, who ruled the area a long time before the 14th century DR. According to legend, she lay sleeping forever on a stone bed with her magic two-handed sword resting on her chest.
Some adventurers entered the pond on several occasions and found nothing, but one band at least never returned.
