The '''Nepenthe River''' was an underground body of water that flowed beneath a region of the [[Sword Coast]], primarily the [[High Moor]].

==Geography==
The source of the river was somewhere in the [[Misty Forest]] and was accessible by a cave therein.

==Description==
The waters of the Nepenthe were extremely cold, to the point of nearly freezing. The air was equally cold and noticeably humid.

Along the path of the river, the surrounding caves were quite striking. The walls sparkled with veins of valuable minerals and incandescent mushrooms shone in a wide variety of colors.

==History==
During the fall of [[Dragonspear Castle]], in the {{YearlinkName|1290}}, the [[mage]] [[Ithtaerus Casalia]] stole a clutch of eggs away from [[Halatathlaer]]'s lair. He hid them away in a cavern on the banks of the Nepenthe.

In the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, a group of adventurers rafted down the river in order to reach the labyrinth beneath Dragonspear Castle.

When the [[Shining Crusade]] took over Dragonspear Castle, around the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, they established a supply depot on the banks of the Nepenthe and used it as a means of transporting soldiers and resources. Among them was the mage [[Strunk]] of [[Silverymoon]], who was binding the river's [[water elemental]]s to his will.

Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a group of [[undead]] led by [[Born]] rose up from the Nepenthe and made their way into Dragonspear.

==Notable Locations==
The river passed directly under Dragonspear Castle.

==Inhabitants==
A number of creatures dwelled within the caves around the river, including [[sahuagin]] and [[ankheg]]s. The waters were home to a number of [[water elemental]]s, a [[nereid]], and even a particularly nasty [[morkoth]] called [[Sallissi]].

During the midâ€“14{{th}} century, the [[alchemist]] [[Bellowgulp Bluefingers]] and his [[myconid]] companion known as [[the Concoctor]] regularly traveled along the banks of the Nepenthe, selling their concoctions.
