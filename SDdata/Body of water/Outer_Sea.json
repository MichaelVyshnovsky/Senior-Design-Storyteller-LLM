        "mainbody": "he Outer Sea, or the Great Outer Sea, was a term used to refer collectively to the seas that surrounded the continent of Faer没n. These were the Trackless Sea, which bordered west Faer没n, and the Great Sea that bordered south Faer没n. This served as a contrast to the continents major inland body of water, the Inner Sea.\nDuring the Twelfth Ser么s War, a number of ports along the Outer Sea were attacked by the forces of Iakhovas. The war came to an end when the Whirlpool Gate of Myth Nantar was used to expel Iakhovas from the Inner Sea and into the Outer Sea.\nThe Outer Sea shared many of the same sentient races as the Inner Sea, morkoths, and sahuagins. However, they exhibited a number of sociological and physiological differences from their Inner Sea counterparts."
