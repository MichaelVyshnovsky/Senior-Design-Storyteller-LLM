The lake was full of ice and covered in a thick mist that drifted down from the massive mountain at its center.
The lake was located south of the Ice Spires SouthLake Woe is not labelled on any map, but its description places it south of the Ice Spires South, and only one lake on the maps fits that description.
Mount Woe, one of the tallest mountains in northern Faer√ªn, was at its center.
