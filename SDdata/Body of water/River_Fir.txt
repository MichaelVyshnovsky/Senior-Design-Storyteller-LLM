The River Fir was a rather nondescript waterway located in the nation of Rashemen.
The Fir originated in the granite mountains of the Running Rocks and extended south a ways until it connected with the great River Rasha, before emptying out into Lake Tirulag.
While not nearly as long, it ran roughly parallel with the north-south road that linked the trade city of Mulptan to the great "City of Warriors" Thasunta.
