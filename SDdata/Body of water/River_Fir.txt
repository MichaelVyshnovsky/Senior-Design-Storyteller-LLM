The '''River Fir''' was a rather nondescript waterway located in the nation of [[Rashemen]].{{Template:Cite book/Unapproachable East|129}}

==Geography==
The Fir originated in the [[granite]] mountains of the [[Running Rocks]] and extended south a ways until it connected with the great [[River Rasha]], before emptying out into [[Lake Tirulag]].

While not nearly as long, it ran roughly parallel with the north-south road that linked the trade city of [[Mulptan]] to the great "City of Warriors" [[Thasunta]].
