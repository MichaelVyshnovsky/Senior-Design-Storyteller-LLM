The Nauseef Flow was a short river in Netheril.
The Nauseef Flow was described to be quiet. Though its source, the Firehorn Peaks, was known to emit a red glow during Midsummer, the Nauseef Flow did not.
The river started in the Firehorn Peaks. From there it flowed east into the Netheril River, which itself flowed close to the Eastern Forest.
