'''Azure Falls''' was a waterfall in [[Calimshan]].

==Description==
The falls were located on [[Mount Ulaarn]] in the [[Alimir Mountains|Alimir mountain range]], where they tumbled down a deep crevice in the solid rock.

At the base of the falls was a deep pool, which was a favorite place for animals to drink. For this reason, hunters would often hide in small grottoes beside and behind the falls to shoot at game.

The falls were the beginning of the [[Maridflow]] river.

==History==
The falls were created in {{Yearlink|-7687}} during the [[Steam Clashes]], a war that broke out between the [[djinni noble]] [[Calim]] and a rebel [[marid]] named [[Ajhuu]]. In one of the battles, two of Ajhuu's lieutenants, [[Haj]] and [[Luar]] were slain with such magical power that it created the rift in Mount Ulaarn that became the falls. The falls were originally named '''Hajluar's Falls''', but over time, the name became corrupted into Azure Falls.
