The '''Fountains of Memory''' were a mysterious source of water that permitted one to see inside pieces of the history selected by the observer.

==Description==
Originally, they were a series of pools located somewhere in the [[Northdark]]. After the [[Spellplague]], the pools were destroyed but the springs that fed the pools remained. They mingled with ordinary springs, so the waters were not as powerful as before.

==History==
Originally the Fountains of Memory were a sacred place for [[deep gnome]]s, who jealously kept the secret of their location. Once in [[1379 DR]], it was permitted to [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] to use them, thanks to his friendship with [[Flinderspeld]].

After the Spellplague, the Fountains were altered. The [[shadovar]] managed to claim them and relocated them to their secret village for captured [[Chosen]] in the [[Lost Peaks]].

In [[1486 DR]], [[Farideh]] often used it. It was presumed destroyed in the fall of the village.
