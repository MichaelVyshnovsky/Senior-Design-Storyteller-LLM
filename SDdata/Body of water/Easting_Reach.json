        "mainbody": "The Easting Reach was a wide expanse of water at the northeast edge of the Sea of Fallen Stars. It was calm and predictable, and was therefore well suited to trade. The city of Sarshel lay at its mouth.\nIn Impiltur, Sarshel was on the west bank of the Easting Reach at its mouth, and Kielbast was a little further north. Ilmwatch was even further to the north, and Buzzard Beak Harbor lay just south of there. Uthmere was on the eastern side of the Reach adjacent to Ilmwatch, and the Soleine River flowed into the Reach at its northernmost point."
