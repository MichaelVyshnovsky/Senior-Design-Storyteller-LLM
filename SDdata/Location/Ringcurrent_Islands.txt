The '''Ringcurrent Islands''' were an grouping of small isles in the northern waters of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] lake,{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|16}} that dominated the landscape of the greater [[Moonsea]] region of [[North Faerûn|northern Faerûn]].

==Description==
The archipelago got its name from the circular arrangement in which its isles were situated. They were originally formed and continually encircled by an eddy of water made by the currents of the [[Trank River]].

==Geography==
The isles were situated in a tight grouping on the north coast of the Moonsea, south of the [[Twilight Marsh]] swamp.<ref group="note">While the exact location of the Ringcurrent Islands is not show on a map, it was said to be south of the [[Twilight Marsh]], a location shown on the map included on page 56 of [[Dungeon magazine 170]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[black dragon]] [[Throstulgrael]] relocated to the nearby [[Twilight Marsh]] and claimed dominion over the resident [[lizardfolk]].{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|5}} Throstulgrael leveled many of the lizardfolk huts along the northern and western islands, forcing them to relocate to those further south.

To appease the dragon, the lizardfolk of the captured two score people from the farms along the [[Trank River]] and imprisoned them in cages on the central King's Island.{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|9}}

==Notable Locations==
* King's Island, the Y-shaped island in the center of the archipelago's eddy. While all three tribes of the Twilight Marsh, made camp on the isle, it was the ancestral home of the Lizard King that ruled over all the lizardfolk.

==Inhabitants==
The [[Muckmarsh]] clan of lizardfolk built their thatched huts on many of the Ringcurrent Isles.
