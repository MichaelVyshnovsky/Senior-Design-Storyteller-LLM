}}'''Dralpur''' was a mining city of 8000 people in the kingdom of [[Ulgarth]] in [[southeast Faerûn]].

==Geography==
It was located on the eastern slopes of the [[Galuil Mountains]], known locally as the Mountains of Gold. This relative altitude made it the coolest inland city in the kingdom.

It stood at the northern end of [[Barbarians' Road]], which formed the border between the realm and the [[barbarian lands (Utter East)|barbarian lands]] of the east,

==Industry==
As well as being a mining city working the Mountains of Gold, Dralpur was also home to many craftsmen. The city's smithies produced all manner of farming tools, which were supplied to the eastern [[mingari]] farms of Ulgarth. Weavers here produced silk and textiles, which, although they could not compete with [[Durpar]]ian products, met the everyday needs of Ulgarthan folk.

==Government==
Dralpur was governed by Baron [[Kevin Olwynson]] around [[1367 DR]].

==Defense==
A small but talented force of 500 warriors protected the city. Olwynson secured their loyalty and skills by paying them well with [[gold]].
