        "mainbody": "The Waterclock was a landmark in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nThe Waterclock provided a precise means of tracking time within the perpetual gloom of the Underdark. Suspended from a massive stalactite in the main cavern, the Waterclock was positioned between the Central and Lower Trade Lanes.\nThe clock not only kept track of highsun, midnight, dawn, and dusk but also displays the months, the three tendays in each month, and the various holidays celebrated in the realm.\nMaintaining the Waterclocks precise functionality required constant vigilance and upkeep. The moisture-rich air and the generally unfavorable conditions in Skullport necessitated frequent oiling, adjusting, and replacing of delicate parts and balances. Additionally, the springs were prone to stretching and wear, and the reservoirs had to be refilled on a regular basis. To ensure the clocks uninterrupted operation, priests of Gond worked in rotating shifts.\nTo safeguard the Waterclock, its creators incorporated numerous defensive mechanisms. Tampering with the Waterclock, whether physically or magically, had dire consequences. Intruders risked severed limbs, electrocution, or volleys of darts from hidden mechanisms. In addition, hostile spells directed at the clock had a chance of reflecting back upon the caster. The device was further protected due to its enhanced durability. It was also immune to disintegrate. Any disturbance around the Waterclock was likely to draw the attention of the Skulls of Skullport, further discouraging interference.\nThe Waterclock was designed and constructed by three Gondsmen in collaboration with the gnomes Tykkyl and Tohkkal Burrwarden. The project was headed by Master Karl Gustavis Gearwizzen, a human cleric of Gond and a seasoned engineer. The Waterclock was conceived in 1369 DR in the aftermath of Halasters Higharvestide."
