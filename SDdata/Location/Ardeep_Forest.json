        "mainbody": "The '''Ardeep Forest''', also known as the '''Faraway Forest''' or '''Elfwood''', was a relatively small but thick woodland in [[northwest Faerûn]]. [[Elf|Elven]] scribes usually compounded the name to \"Ardeepforest\" in order to denote the forest as opposed to the [[Ardeep|realm]] that once encompassed a large part of the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Geography": "In the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the forest was a few miles east of [[Waterdeep]], on the south bank of the [[River Dessarin]]. Three clearings in the northwest corner closest to Waterdeep were favorite rendezvous spots for clandestine lovers and runaways.{{Cite dragon/270/The New Adventures of Volo: The Ardeep|93}} The interior of Ardeep Forest contained many ridges and steep gullies that were hidden beneath thick vines, dense shrubbery, and cloaking mists that presented a danger to casual travelers. In addition, tunnels, cellars, and vaults constructed by [[dwarves]] during a time of alliance became pitfalls centuries later.",
        "History": "[[File:Illefarn -626DR.png|thumb|right|275px|''Map showing the extent of the forest in −626 DR.'']]\nThe forest was once much bigger than the extent shown on maps of the 14{{th}}–century DR. In the [[-626 DR|Year of Oaths Forsaken, −626 DR]], the trees extended unbroken (except by rivers) from [[Neverwinter Wood]] down through [[Kryptgarden Forest]], Ardeep Forest, the [[Misty Forest]], and ended in the [[Trollbark Forest]] north of the [[Troll Hills]]. Millennia before that, the forest was connected to what eventually became the [[High Forest]].\n\nThe dwarvish contributions to the (eventual) hazards of Ardeep Forest were primarily built during the 6{{th}}–century [[DR]] when the kingdom of [[Phalorm]] briefly flourished.\n\nDuring [[the Retreat]], begun in the [[1344 DR|Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR]], the elves left behind many [[baelnorn]] and [[green warder]] guardians to protect the tombs of their ancestors and guard their legacy.\n\nAbout a decade before the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the inhabitants of the neighboring village of [[Nightstone]], led by Lord [[Drezlin Nandar]] from [[Waterdeep]], started making hunting expeditions into the forest in an attempt to reestablish the [[Nandar Lodge|hunting lodge]] held there by House Nandar two centuries earlier. These incursions infuriated the few remaining elves. In the following years, the conflict escalated until the elves assaulted Nightstone and killed Drezlin. In the aftermath, his widow, [[Velrosa Nandar]], made peace with the elves and pledged never to make any such expeditions into the forest again. She kept that promise until her death one year later when the [[cloud giant]]s attacked Nightstone.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "[[File:Dragon270-Ron Spencer-FloatingTower.png|thumb|right|275px|''One of the floating towers seen above the Ardeep Forest.'']]\n[[Cloud palace|Floating towers]] (including [[Maddgoth's Castle]]) have been observed above Ardeep Forest over a good portion of its history. They were attributed to various [[mage]]s and [[cloud giant]]s but the owners rarely revealed themselves. Bard-spun yarns of ships from other worlds were also tavern favorites.{{Cite dragon/270/The New Adventures of Volo: The Ardeep|95}}\n\nSomewhere in the eastern section of the forest were the remains of a desecrated elven tomb. As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, all that was left above ground was a stone arch with a decrepit iron gate, and even the bones had been looted from the site. The arch was a one-way ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] in [[Undermountain]].",
        "Notable Locations": "; [[Crypts of the Deepening Moon|The Crypts of the Deepening Moon]]\n: The royal vaults of abandoned Ardeep.\n; [[Dancing Dell]]\n: Contained a magical rock sacred to the followers of [[Eilistraee]].{{Cite dragon/270/The New Adventures of Volo: The Ardeep|94}}\n; [[Glen of Aloevan|The Glen of Aloevan]]\n: The site of a ''portal'' that led to a [[pocket plane]] wherein lay the ghost of the maddened laranla (queen) and [[Chosen]] of [[Mystra]] and [[Sehanine Moonbow|Sehanine]], [[Embrae Aloevan]]. The site was guarded by an otherworldly [[dragon]] and the laranla's attendants, all priests of Sehanine.\n; [[Floshin Estates|The Floshin Estates]]\n: A lightly wooded expanse of land that bordered the forest proper. [[Elorfindar Floshin]], lord of the lands, guarded the House of Long Silences from his secret [[fey'ri]] relatives in penance for his family's actions.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|4-5}}\n; [[Green Glade|The Green Glade]]\n: a ring of elm trees that encompassed a minor [[mythal|mythal's]] effects.{{Cite dragon/270/The New Adventures of Volo: The Ardeep|93-94}}\n; [[Harpshield Lands]] / [[Dungeon of the Shield]]\n: Were owned by the [[Harpshield]] royal family, some of whose members survived the drow raids of {{Yearlink|942}}, fled to [[Nimoar's Hold]], and eventually became House [[Majarra]], although they mostly forgot their royal lineage over the centuries. Their land bordered the southeastern ridge of the forest. The dungeon was beneath Harpshield Castle.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5}}\n; [[House of Long Silences|The House of Long Silences]]\n: Was located at the bottom of the northern spur of the forest.\n; [[House of Stone]]\n: A huge tower fallen to ruin just east of the forest contained [[Stoneturn Well]] that connected to the [[Underdark]].\n; [[Nandar Lodge]]\n: The foundations of a hunting lodge that was abandoned by its stubborn owner after repeated elf attacks.\n; [[Phylund Hunting Lodge]]\n: Known for hosting hunts of exotic creatures, brought from elsewhere.\n; [[Reluraun's Tomb]]\n: The final resting place of a fallen elf warrior, cursed by evil magic during his final battle.\n; [[Talmost Keep]]\n: Located just outside the end of the forest's northern spur and was the royal seat of [[House Talmost]], never reclaimed by its descendants.",
        "Inhabitants": "In [[1358 DR]], [[Strumferrel]], a [[Tanar'ri]] posing as a evil human wizard named [[Glandowr]], lived in a tower in the forest.{{Cite comic/Telling Lies}}{{Cite comic/The Truth}}{{Cite comic/Rights and Wrongs}}\n\nTraditionally, the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] had been active in the forest. As of [[1374 DR]], two cells operated here, one hunted down worshipers of [[Eilistraee]] near the [[Dancing Dell]] and the [[Ladystone]]; and the other guarded the ruins of [[Phalorm]].\n\nBy the 1480s [[DR]], in the years surrounding the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the forest was inhabited by a group of [[wood elf|wood elves]] from [[Evermeet]], led by [[Rond Arrowhome]]. The elves took it upon themselves to preserve the forest's ruins and wildlife.",
        "Flora & Fauna": "Thanks to the loamy ground, Ardeep Forest's vegetation was thick and healthy and aided the growth of [[mushroom]]s that glowed faintly. Visitors to Ardeep Forest either came to experience a truly untamed woodland or to seek privacy. It was a place with sun-speckled paths, parcels of deer, and pleasant verges among [[blueleaf]], [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] and [[weirwood]] trees. Deeper into the forest the vegetation became dense with shrubbery, cloaked in vines, shrouded in mists, home for wild [[boar]], [[wolves]], and the occasional [[owlbear]]. After the elves left, various monsters including [[assassin vine]]s, tribes of [[kobold]]s, [[nyth (creature)|nyths]], [[tendriculos]]es, thirsts of [[stirge]]s, and other creatures moved into the forest. As of 1372 DR, patrols by [[ranger]]s and the [[Harpers]] kept the larger predators and bandits from settling in the verges."
