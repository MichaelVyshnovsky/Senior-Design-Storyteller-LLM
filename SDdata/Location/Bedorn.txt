Bedorn was a coastal realm of the Border Kingdoms. The Shining Sea lay off its coastline to the west and the Scelptarmouth (the mouth of the River Scelptar) was found to the north. The main centre of activity in Bedorn was the town of Oparl.
The bogs and marshes that made up much of the land in Bedorn acted as efficient natural defenses against invasions by the nomads of the Shaar to the south. Bedorn had long since become a playground for rich Calishite satraps who built many palaces and lavish abodes in Oparl and the immediately surrounding areas. This resulted in much of the land here being transformed into a lush and beautiful landscape of grass and trees. Many of these satraps hosted games and events for their own satisfaction, such as beast hunts or fights to the death. Occasional invasions from the Shaar and even pirate landings proved to be only a small inconvenience due to the powerful wizards who inhabited Bedorn. Ilcanorr was one such wizard.
Although Bedorn was inhabited by many wealthy and powerful nobles, merchants and wizards, the majority of its populace was made up of the servants, maids, cooks and other personnel employed to work for them. The main trade was breedingâ€”farms existed for the purposes of producing rare and unusual creatures that could be sold in Calimshan, Chessenta and the Tashalar.
Despite appearing as though each piece of land was governed and protected by its landowner, a secretive government existed in Bedorn made up of only a few of the most powerful landowners.
