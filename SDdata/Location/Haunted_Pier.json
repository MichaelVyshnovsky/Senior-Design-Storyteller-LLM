        "mainbody": "he Haunted Pier was an area where ships could dock along the treacherous river that flowed through the Shadowfell city of Evernight. However, after that river became a stream of lava in the 15 century DR, only ghost ships could use the docks. \nSeveral piers made of stone were all that still stood in the lava. Ghostly ships would occasionally materialize alongside one of these piers and dock as if to unload cargo. Although no one was ever seen on board, the creaking of the ships rigging and the sounds of moving cargo could be heard throughout the area. The ships would eventually depart&mdashhaving lingered for as little as a few hours to as long as several days&mdashand vanish upstream.\nThe piers stood on the south bank of the river just upstream from the three bridges that connected the north and south shores. Nearby was a fire-damaged warehouse that served as an outpost for representatives from Thay.\nWhen the river was still navigable by normal boats, unwary sailors were frequently shipwrecked while sailing into Evernight. The river became overrun with lava following the events of the Ruining in the , when the eruption of Mount Hotenow on the Material Plane caused its twin in the Shadowfell to also erupt. However, the Shadowfell volcano never stopped erupting, thus leading to the river becoming a perpetual flow of lava. This led to the abandonment and haunting of the piers."
