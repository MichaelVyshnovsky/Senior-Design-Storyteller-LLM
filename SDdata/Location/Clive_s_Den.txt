Clives Den was one of several pirate coves of the "planet" Garden and one of its only safe spelljamming ports.
The small settlement was led by Clive the Fearsome. There had been eleven Clives since the founding of Clives Den, over a period of 125 years. In 1360 DR, the current Clive was formerly known as Orion of Calimshan.
Clives Den charged a moorage fee of 200 gold pieces and an exorbitant air tax of 400 gold pieces. An additional cargo tax was also charged, which was based on the amount of cargo being carried by mooring spelljammers.
The location had a number of small shops that catered to merchants. Among them were
* The Blind Parrot
* Orins Borrowed Goods
* Bills Battered Weapons
* Olafs Armory
* Aldos Supplies
