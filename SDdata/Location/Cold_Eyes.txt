The Cold Eyes was an enigmatic carving of giant eyes that overlooked the River of Ice in Calimshan.
The carving was found on the eastern cliffside of the river, at the point where its two tributaries, the Two Falls River and Bakkals Creek, came together.
The carving included two expressionless eyes and the top of a nose. Most assumed that the rest of a face was carved below the powerful currents of the rivers, but no one had ever proven this, as the task was exceptionally difficult. However, all of those who touched the visible portion of the carving agreed that it felt as cold as ice&mdashhence the name&mdashno matter what time of year it was.
The citizens of Manshaka and Schamedar each believed that the eyes were gazing towards their cities and that this showed the favor of their gods.
