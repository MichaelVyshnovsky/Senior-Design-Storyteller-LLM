The '''Cold Eyes''' was an enigmatic carving of giant eyes that overlooked the [[River of Ice]] in [[Calimshan]].

==Location==
The carving was found on the eastern cliffside of the river, at the point where its two tributaries, the [[Two Falls River]] and [[Bakkal's Creek]], came together.

==Description==
The carving included two expressionless eyes and the top of a nose. Most assumed that the rest of a face was carved below the powerful currents of the rivers, but no one had ever proven this, as the task was exceptionally difficult. However, all of those who touched the visible portion of the carving agreed that it felt as cold as ice&mdash;hence the name&mdash;no matter what time of year it was.

==Rumors & Legends==
The citizens of [[Manshaka]] and [[Schamedar]] each believed that the eyes were gazing towards their cities and that this showed the favor of their gods.
