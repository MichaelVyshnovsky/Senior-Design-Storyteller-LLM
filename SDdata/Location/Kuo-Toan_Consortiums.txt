The '''Kuo-Toan Consortiums''' were some kind of ancient [[kuo-toa]] nation in [[Serôs]] beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Geography==
The Kuo-Toan Consortiums consisted of a number of cavernous cities along the [[Plains of Duna]].

==Culture==
The kuo-toans of this nation widely engaged in the practice of [[slavery]], primarily of the [[locathah]]s.

==History==
The [[Second Serôs War]] began in {{YearlinkConvert|-8228|TS}}, with the war's combatants being the Kuo-Toan Consortiums and the [[sea elf]] empire of [[Aryselmalyr]]. The elves would rally the enslaved locathah against their masters, as well as various [[crabmen]] and [[merfolk]].
