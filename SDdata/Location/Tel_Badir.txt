'''Tel Badir''' was a [[D'tarig]] village located along the eastern edge of [[The Sword]] in [[Anauroch]].

==Geography==
Tel Badir was situated atop a hill, overlooked by the nearby [[Tethyamar Mountains]], which was situated between two large streams, and four smaller ones winded and cascaded their way through it.

==Trade==
The inhabitants of Tel Badir frequently conducted trade with members of the [[Zhentarim]], though it was also a location that many outlanders flocked to do business under a low profile. The D'tarig traded goods that were common to the region, including [[camel]]s and [[frankincense]]. Their camels in particular were known to be quite sturdy and well-trained. Merchants here were also known to trade barrels, kegs, [[rope]]s, sand-sledges, sacks, and waterskins.

The nomadic [[Bedine]] tribes were often known to come here to shop for replacement camels, metal cooking implements, and over-priced weaponry. The D'tarig caravan [[Biradoon]] was also known to depart from this village.

==History==
Starting in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Zhentarim began working to gradually deprive the native D'tarig of any control they had over their own village. They hoped to transform it into a base for trading artifacts from the lost kingdom of [[Anauria]] to people all across [[Faer√ªn]]. They also hoped to transform it into a jumping off point for caravans crossing the desert towards the [[Sword Coast]].
==Inhabitants==
The village was inhabited entirely by D'tarig.

Many resented the stranglehold of power the Zhentarim held over them and dreamed of wiping their presence from the village, but were reluctant to do so in fear of retaliation from the organization. Such inhabitants rebelled against the Zhentarim in secrecy by ambushing lone or drunken magelings, setting [[tent]]s and storechests on fire, and sabotaging their equipment whenever possible. Members of the Zhentarim were known to blame these acts on their enemies, the [[Harpers]].

However, some D'tarig were known to have sold out to the Zhentarim. The organization was also known to have spies in the village that posed as independent, outlander merchants.
