The '''Fallen Lands''' were a barren area of the [[Savage Frontier]], home to many monsters and even more mysteries.

==Geography==
They were located just west of the [[Anauroch]] desert, along one side of the [[Triangle of Trees]]. The [[Far Forest]] was located to its north, while the [[Weathercote Wood]] was situated to its south.

==Geographical Features==
The rolling hills and scrublands of the Fallen Lands appeared rather ordinary during the daytime hours. At night, strange and seemingly in inexplicable radiances appeared in sporadic locations.

The area held scores of ruins that served as reminders of ancient cities and the battles that brought them down. It was a favored destination for treasure-seekers and other adventurers alike.

==History==
These lands were once part of the realm of [[Netheril]], home to those not powerful enough to reside within the empire's famous floating cities. Some 14{{th}}-century [[sage]]s argued many of these mages migrated southward, and ultimately settled [[Halruaa]].<ref>

During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Zhentarim]] agents actively scoured the area looking for ancient Netherese [[relic]]s.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, unidentified flying creatures were seen flying in the skies over the region.

After [[Hellgate Keep]] fell in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, many of the [[fiend]]s of the Far Forest ventured south into the Fallen Lands.

Around the same time, a pair of adventurers, [[Vanthorm]] and [[Haladan]], claimed they saw an enormous [[beholder]] leading bands of [[hobgoblin]]s in their capture of bestial creatures with the goal of breeding them.

==Rumors & Legends==
There were some local rumors that powerful [[mage]]s dwelled within the southern Fallen Lands and used their [[magic]] to keep away the evil beings of Hellgate Keep.<ref>

The motes of light that appeared at night were believed by some to be the after-effects of ancient [[arcane]] spells.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Spellgard]]: These ruins dated back to the ancient Netherese empire.
* [[The Reversed Obelisks]]
* [[Valley of the Dogs]]: Two bands of warring hobgoblins fought over this forested valley.
* [[Jortay's Folly]]
* [[Taransen's Grave]]
* [[Stormkeep]]: The abandoned stronghold earned its names from the bolts of lightning that shot out from its highest tower.

==Inhabitants==
Only monstrous creatures were known to inhabit the Fallen Lands. These ranged from the more common [[leucrotta]]s, [[doppelganger]]s, [[grick]]s, [[harpies]], and [[naga]]s, to the more rarely encountered [[displacer beast]]s, [[krenshar]]s, [[gray render]]s and [[gibbering mouther]]s. 

Several tribes of [[orc]]s dwelled within this area for some time. In the southern reaches of the Fallen Lands, these tribes were all ruled by petty kings and constantly feuded with another&mdash;these included the [[Black Bone]], [[Black Slasher]], [[Seven Eye]], and [[Severed Fist]] tribes. They all showed fealty the [[Bloody Scar]] and their [[shaman]]â€“king [[Ogrash]], a tribe that ruled over the northern reaches of the Fallen Lands and the bordering Greypeak Mountains. All of the tribes used [[axe beak]]s as [[mount]]s, fighting atop them with [[lance]]s and [[shortbow]]s.
