        "mainbody": "Blackgate was a district located in the Outer City of Baldurs Gate. It was noteworthy for being the only neighborhood that formed outside Black Dragon Gate, north of the Upper City. It surrounded the part of the Trade Way that extended north of the city, en route to Waterdeep.\nThe region served as a waiting area for merchants and caravaneers moving their goods along the Trade Way. Traders were forced to stable their pack animals in Blackgate, while their products were transferred to another conveyance while moving through the city.\nBlackgates alleys were seemingly packed with people, many of whom worked as laborers, shop assistants, or as dockhands in Gray Harbor. There was a large shield dwarf population, who mainly earned their living as blacksmiths or farriers.\nThe group known as Shars Serpents was the most prominent gang in Blackgate during the late 15 century DR."
