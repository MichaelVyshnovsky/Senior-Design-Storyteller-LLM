        "mainbody": "'''Blackgate''' was a district located in the [[Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was noteworthy for being the only neighborhood that formed outside [[Black Dragon Gate]], north of the [[Upper City]]. It surrounded the part of the [[Trade Way]] that extended north of the city, ''en route'' to [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "The region served as a waiting area for merchants and caravaneers moving their goods along the [[Trade Way]]. Traders were forced to stable their pack animals in Blackgate, while their products were transferred to another conveyance while moving through the city.\n\nBlackgate's alleys were seemingly packed with people, many of whom worked as laborers, shop assistants, or as dockhands in [[Gray Harbor]]. There was a large [[shield dwarf]] population, who mainly earned their living as blacksmiths or farriers.",
        "Crime": "The group known as [[Shar's Serpents]] was the most prominent gang in Blackgate during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
