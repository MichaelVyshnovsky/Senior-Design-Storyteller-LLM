Tammar was a large town in Thesk.
As of 1372 DR, it had a population of 3,594.
It was razed by the Tuigan Horde and subsequently besieged by bandits who took heavy tolls from passing caravans. The government of Thesk hired a hundred orc soldiers to rid the town of the bandits and these orcs were later hailed as heroes in Tammar. The town was since rebuilt.
