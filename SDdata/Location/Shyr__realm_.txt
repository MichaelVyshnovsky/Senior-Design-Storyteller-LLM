Shyr was a realm that existed on the world of Abeir, located on the continent of the same name. It was the ancestral homeland of the genasi of Akan没l.
Shyr was the realm ruled by the primordial Karshimis. In the wake of the Spellplague in 1385 DR, a part of Shyr was exchanged with its equivalent regions in Faer没n eastern Chondath and western Chessenta. That region would become the Faer没nian kingdom of Akan没l.
Parts of Unther were also sent to the realm of Shyr. The genasi lords bargained with the Mulhorandi who were displaced to the world of Abeir, who sold the Untherans as slaves. In the late years of the 15 century DR, an individual calling himself Gilgeam fomented a rebellion among the Untheran slaves. The rebels fought many battles against their Shyran masters and their Mulhorandi allies, but in , when they were about to have a major battle against the Shyrans, the rebels were transported to Toril by the effects of the Second Sundering, leaving the Shyrans unscathed.
The Anarchs of Shyr were an arcane order tasked with the protection of the Shyran population.
