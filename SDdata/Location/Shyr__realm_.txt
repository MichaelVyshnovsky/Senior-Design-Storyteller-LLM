'''Shyr''' was a realm that existed on the world of [[Abeir]], located on the [[Shyr (continent)|continent of the same name]]. It was the ancestral homeland of the [[genasi]] of [[Akan没l]].

==History==
Shyr was the realm ruled by the [[primordial]] [[Karshimis]]. In the wake of the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], a part of Shyr was exchanged with its equivalent regions in [[Faer没n]]: eastern [[Chondath]] and western [[Chessenta]]. That region would become the Faer没nian kingdom of Akan没l.

Parts of [[Unther]] were also sent to the realm of Shyr. The genasi lords bargained with the [[Mulhorand]]i who were displaced to the world of Abeir, who sold the Untherans as slaves. In the late years of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an individual calling himself [[Gilgeam]] fomented a rebellion among the Untheran slaves. The rebels fought many battles against their Shyran masters and their Mulhorandi allies, but in {{YearlinkName|1487}}, when they were about to have a major battle against the Shyrans, the rebels were transported to [[Toril]] by the effects of the [[Second Sundering]], leaving the Shyrans unscathed.

==Organizations==
{{main|Anarch of Shyr}}
The Anarchs of Shyr were an arcane order tasked with the protection of the Shyran population.
