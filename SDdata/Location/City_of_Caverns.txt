The '''City of Caverns''' was a [[sahuagin]] city in the [[Sea of Swords]] by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The city was essentially a giant air-filled cavern, far beneath the surface of the sea. The City of Caverns led down into the [[Underdark]].

==Structure==
The sahuagin of the City of Caverns had built ornate structures within it. Excellently crafted golden statues of marine life and shells were shown around many parts of the city, surrounded by the rushing waters of waterfalls. An arena, which held an [[ettin]], was used as a fighting ground. The city's floors were beautifully tiled, and large structures such as a giant [[shark]]'s maw and ornate dome-shaped objects were scattered around the underwater city.

The royal throne room was located to the west of the city, where the leading monarch resided.

==Inhabitants==
The sahuagin inhabitants of the city often warred with [[drow]] and [[illithid]]s.

==History==
The sahuagin had ruled the city for countless generations. Aeons ago, [[Sekolah]] visited the city to the rejoicing of all, and his great song filled their hearts. However, Sekolah told the high priestess, [[Senityili]], that the city would, in the future, be no more. He told of signs that surface dwellers would arrive, and only they would stand between their city and destruction. Thus, the sahuagin waited for their surface saviors-to-be.

A southern part of the city, however, was closed off by a mad drow [[mage]]. When he passed, he forced a [[spectator]] [[beholder]], and his [[imp]] companions, to guard a chest containing a relic of Sekolah.

Around [[1358 DR]], a civil war broke out in the city. The two sides were the loyalists who supported King [[Ixilthetocal]], and the rebels who supported Prince [[Villynaty]].
