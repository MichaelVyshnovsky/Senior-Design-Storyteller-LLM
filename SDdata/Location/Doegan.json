        "mainbody": "'''Doegan''' (pronounced ''durgan'') was a realm in the [[Utter East]] of [[southeast Faerûn]]. It was one of the Five Kingdoms of the Utter East.",
        "Geography": "[[File:Utter east tharkar.jpg|thumb|left|''A map of the Utter East showing Doegan and its neighbors.'']]\nIt lay south of the [[Free Cities of Parsanic]] and west of the country of [[Edenvale]].<ref> The coastal area of Doegan was known as the Doegan Shores. The land around the Capital was open and clear, with pleasant green fields and palm trees, but harsh times saw it become dry and rocky, or as rippled brown earth like dried mud with patches of broken, rougher land. Marshes lay in the northwest.\n\nThe climate was hot and muggy, and even a [[horse]] would grow weary here.",
        "History": {
            "Howl of Vengeance": {
                "Rathgar the Raider": "[[File:Howl of Vengeance Rathgar 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Rathgar the Raider and Grubkern view the aftermath of battle with undead.'']]\n:Rathgar investigated just in time, finding an undead horde almost at his doorstep. Fighting in and around the capital, they repelled the invaders and burned their crypts. Rathgar pardoned Grubkern, and Grubkern revealed the name of the leader of the undead: Aelric the Avenger.\n\n:Rathgar and his army pursued Aelric to the [[Serpent Valley]], where he rallied his undead forces. Rathgar overcame them in bloodforge battle, forcing them to retreat once more.\n\n:Aelric's army holed up in Old Stone Keep. Resolute, both rulers prepared for a final battle. Ultimately, Rathgar defeated Aelric, putting an end to the old king's curse. He returned victorious to the capital and the throne, settling his clansmen in Doegan, where they prospered and lived without fear of reprisal.",
                "Aelric the Avenger": "[[File:Howl of Vengeance Aelric 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Aelric the Avenger bursts through the gate of Doegan.'']]\n:When Rathgar's forces pursued the princess to Old Stone Keep, Aelric protected her and struck back against them in a bloodforge battle, favoring crypt-born creatures. Victorious, Aelric scattered Rathgar's own bloodforged forces.\n\n:In disarray and dread, Rathgar and his army retreated into the Serpent Valley. Aelric pursued, exploiting the chaos to once again strike at his foe.\n\n:Ultimately, Rathgar's army fled to Doegan's capital with Aelric's horde hot on his heels. They crashed through the city gates and walls and fought the invaders in the streets, with steel and fire and magic. Thus did Aelric the Avenger fulfil the old king's curse and liberate Doegan. The princess became queen, with Aelric at her side, and brought peace to Doegan."

            "During the Legendary Campaign": "[[File:Howl of Vengeance Intro a.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A wartorn and devastated Doegan.'']]\nFormerly a powerful nation, Doegan fell into decline under the rule of [[Patric Fulgirth]], an idle ruler who cared not for the needs of the people. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] sought to depose Fulgirth, and thought this would be an easy task.\n\nLater, the cunning mage [[Gim Blacktongue]] used treachery to usurp the throne of Doegan. Although the kingdom prospered, it did so under an air of suspicion, and Doegan folk called for a new and trustworthy rule. The leader of the Legendary Campaign came to Doegan and attempted to remove Blacktongue from power.\n\nEventually, Doegan fell into the safe hands of [[Hariah Highkin]]. The capital prospered, the borders held firm, and people were happy. Nevertheless, on a quest to unify the wartorn Utter East through conquest, the leader of the Legendary Campaign returned and tried to conquer Doegan, no matter the cost to the realm.",
            "Modern history": "In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Queen [[Rosalind]] of [[Edenvale]] ordered [[Atreus Eleint]] and [[Yago]] expelled from her kingdom, with an honor guard to escort them to the Doegan Shores and put on the first ship to the [[Sword Coast]]. However, they escaped before that could occur.\n\nAlso in 1368 DR, delegates of Doegan and [[Konigheim]] met in [[Tharkar]] under the pretense of negotiating a treaty. However, both sides planned to sabotage the proceedings by murdering one of their own, so as to unite the rest of the Kingdoms against the other. Their plots were foiled by an agent from [[Ulgarth]], and there was no overall change in the political structure of the Five Kingdoms.<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Emperor [[Aetheric III]] abducted [[Eidola Boareskyr]], the bride-to-be of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron Paladinson]] in an attempt to summon a foreign army to defeat the demons that plagued Doegan due to use of the bloodforge.<ref><ref> The plan failed, and Eldrinpar was sacked by a horde of monsters. The mad mutated emperor, Aetheric III, was almost assassinated by [[Artemis Entreri]], then finished off by the band of paladins sent by Waterdeep. Chancellor Ikavi Garkim became the new ruler of Doegan and declared Mar and Ffolk to be full equals. By the end of the events, to ensure the bloodforge was used responsibly, Garkim shared the position of Emperor with the Chosen of Tyr, Ingrar Welven, and they cast the monsters out of the city.<ref>"

        "Government": "[[File:Howl of Vengeance Aelric 4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The queen of Doegan ruling over a rejuvenated Doegan, with her champion Aelric.'']]\nIn the 7th century [[DR]], Doegan was ruled by a succession of monarchs.",
        "Notable Locations": "The capital of Doegan was [[Eldrinpar]], formerly known simply as the Doegan Capital.\n\nIn the northeast, upriver from the Doegan Capital, lay [[Serpent Valley]]. In the mountains to the west stood [[Old Stone Keep]]."
