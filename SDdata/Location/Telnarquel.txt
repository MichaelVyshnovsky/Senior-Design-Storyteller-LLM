'''Telnarquel''', also called '''The Hidden City''', was a city in the [[Underdark]] that was so well concealed that some [[drow]] explorers refused to believe that it actually existed. In truth, it did indeed exist, deep below [[Yallasch]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]],{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-03-12/Telnarquel}} but was abandoned for an unknown reason at some point during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It lay empty for a few decades until an [[alhoon]] made the city its lair.

==Rumors & Legends==
[[Dove Falconhand]] once claimed to be from Telnarquel for a cover identity while ''[[polymorph]]ed'' as a drow infiltrating a large group of [[Vhaeraun]]-worshipers who were covertly invading [[Scornubel]] in [[1369 DR]].
