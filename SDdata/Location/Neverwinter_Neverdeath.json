        "mainbody": "'''Neverdeath''', also called the '''Neverdeath Graveyard''', was the burial ground and cemetery of [[Neverwinter]]. It was named for a common blessing given over the dead: as long as the city remained in summer, it was believed that the dead would not turn into [[undead]].",
        "Description": "[[File:Doomguides Watch NVW MMO.webp|thumb|300px|''The wall between the two sections of Neverdeath, ''circa'' 1479 DR.'']]\nNeverdeath consisted of two wide, roughly square areas of the city surrounded by a thick and looming black wall of stone and wood pierced by stark black gates. Each of these was a sprawling cemetery: the so-called '''Main Graveyard''' was located in the northeastern of the two sections, while the southwestern section was known as the '''Pauper's Section'''. The graveyards included sprawling rows of tombstones interspersed with old trees, crumbling statues, and mausoleums.\n\nThe graveyard was considered sacred to [[Kelemvor]], and [[doomguide]]s from the [[Eternal Order of Kelemvor]] were responsible for protection of the area.",
        "Geography": "It was located within the Neverwinter city walls, and lay on the southern edge of town near the [[Protector's Enclave]]. A cobblestone street surrounded the graveyard, and no buildings were built within 50 paces its outer walls.\n\nIn Neverdeath's same location on the [[Shadowfell]] were [[Evernight]]'s [[Graveyard (Evernight)|Graveyard]] (coinciding with the Pauper's Section) and the [[Corpse Market]] (coinciding with the Main Graveyard).",
        "History": "Neverdeath was a centuries-old burial ground for the people of Neverwinter. \n\nThe graveyard was still used to bury the dead&mdash;albeit with much simpler markers and haphazard graves than before the disasters The gates were always kept closed, and if ever they opened, it would draw the attention of concerned onlookers.\n\nAlso in 1479 DR, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Tolivast]] hid in Neverdeath while cursing the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter#False Crown|Crown of Neverwinter]]''. While Tolivast had control over a small army of undead, he was chased down by a group of [[adventurer]]s that killed him, retrieved the ''Crown'', and destroyed most of his undead minions. Around the same time, yet another Red Wizard necromancer named [[Jack]] began raising undead in the cemetery.\n\nFinally, following the events of the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], the [[Neverwinter Guard]] turned its attention to Valindra's activities in Neverdeath, and sent the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to assist the [[Kelemvorite]]s&mdash;led by Doomguide [[Volahk]]&mdash;in ending her plots. From the Kelemvorites' last foothold of [[Doomguide's Watch]], the adventurers started by culling the undead, rescuing Doomguides throughout Pauper's Field, and reconsecrating the area. The adventurers also delivered the [[phylactery]] of the [[lich]] [[Zarifrax]] to Volahk, ended a Thayan effort to revive a dangerous [[ogre]] named [[Arleon|Arleon the Unforgiven]], helped the [[Harper]] agent [[Windle]] to thwart a plot by the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and clashed with Valindra's forces at the [[Clockwork Tomb]]. Ultimately, they succeeded in driving out the Thayans from the graveyard, and were able to report evidence of her future plans to Neverwinter's [[Sergeant Knox]].\n\nSometime in the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} Neverdeath became the site of infighting by members of the Cult of the Dragon between traditionalists and the followers of [[Severin Silrajin]], who were seeking the remains of [[Cruven Gantara]] with the aid of the [[green dragon]] [[Charthraxis]]. The Harpers coordinated efforts to thwart both factions, led by an agent named [[Boward]].\n\nThe graveyard continued to be infested with undead as of at least {{Yearlink|1491}}.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Main Graveyard": "[[File:Craftmans Rest NVW MMO.webp|thumb|300px]]\nThe Main Graveyard was the northeastern walled-in half of the graveyard. The thick western wall separating it from the Pauper's Section was the site of numerous towering mausoleums with interconnected catacombs. Notable locations in the Main Graveyard included:\n* '''Craftsman's Rest''', an old section of the cemetery containing ornamental tombs and graves. Craftsman's Rest in turn contained:\n** A [[Shadow crossing (Evernight)|shadow crossing]] to Evernight located in the center.\n** The [[Artisan's Tomb (Neverdeath)|Artisan's Tomb]].\n** The [[Waterclock Guild's Crypts]], a massive complex beneath an unassuming mausoleum dedicated the city's [[Waterclock Guild]].\n* [[Hallix Mausoleum]], the humble family tomb of the Neverwinter [[Hallix]] family.\n* [[Merchant's Landing]], a section where many of the most prominent merchants of Neverwinter were interred. \n* The [[Monini Crypts]], the family tombs of the Neverwinter [[Monini]] family.",
            "Pauper's Section": "[[File:Paupers Field NVW MMO.webp|thumb|300px]]\nThe Pauper's Section, also known as '''Pauper's Field''' or the '''Pauper's Graveyard''', was the southwestern walled-in half of the graveyard. It was a hilly area that traditionally served as the place where Neverwinter's poorest were buried, and which became a site of mass graves following the Ruining. It contained more simple headstones and tombs than the Main Graveyard. It's communal catacombs dated back to the establishment of Neverdeath, and had been built by a handful of civic-minded citizens. Notable locations in the Pauper's Section included:\n* [[Crypt of Vers Never]], a presumably empty tomb that was once intended for [[Vers Never]].\n* Graves of the [[Lucanis]] family.\n* The [[Lynching Tree]], a site where accused criminals were buried.\n* A nondescript tomb recognizable only by an inscription above the doorway reading \"Home Again, To Rest Forever\". This tomb was connected to the [[Dolindar Tomb]] in Evernight via a [[Crevice of Dusk]].\n* The [[Rift (Neverdeath)|Rift]], a ravine formed during past disasters.\n* [[Soldier's Memorial]], a burial section for military veterans. Soldier's Memorial in turn contained:\n** The [[Soldier's Monument]].\n** The [[Wizard's Tomb (Neverdeath)|Wizard's Tomb]]."

        "Inhabitants": "As of 1479 DR, corpses were said to shamble about the graveyard at all hours. This included [[skeleton]]s, [[wight]]s, and [[zombie]]s (including [[zombie hulk]]s).\n\nAny visitors to Neverdeath found themselves assailed by lesser undead creatures that burst from the ground. Many of these were servants of the Thayans, and were meant not only to deter intruders but to provide advance warning of any threats to their operations. At this time, living cultists and [[gnoll]]s allied with the Thayans also became active in the area. Despite these dangers, unscrupulous individuals were known to hunt for treasures in the graves."
