'''Senshi islands''' was an island chain located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
The Senshi Islands formed a series of diverse islands, ranging in size, extending from [[Mikedono]] into the [[Gulf of Mi]]. While some of these islands were bare, weathered rocks, continually struck by the ocean waves, the majority hosted vibrant clusters of lush greenery. Additionally, each island offered at least one or two sheltered inlets, providing secure havens for fishing boats to anchor and rest.

The islands in the chain were: '''Heike''', '''Ieyaku''', '''Kamine''', '''Mifura''', '''Mishi''', '''Ojo''', '''Senshi''', '''Shimo''', '''Tojuki''', '''Tsune''' and '''Uemi'''.

The waters surrounding the Senshi Islands teemed with a multitude of small fishing boats, tirelessly plying their trade. Renowned as one of the finest fishing grounds in Kozakura, the Senshi chain was particularly famed for its expansive [[oyster]] beds, from which precious [[pearl]]s are harvested. Navigating the treacherous currents on the eastern side of the islands was avoided by the boats, while [[junk]]s wisely steered clear of that perilous area.

Kamine and Tsune were rugged rocky formations devoid of natural water sources. In contrast, the remaining islands featured either natural springs or sufficient rocky catch basins that sustained the growth of plant life. Notably, the island of Senshi boasted dense vegetation, thriving in abundance. Along an eastward-facing shore, a shrine dedicated to one of the oldest sea gods in Kozakura proudly stood, embodying the island's deep connection to the realm of the sea.

==Inhabitants==
The islanders predominantly engaged in fishing and pearl diving, with many [[sea spirit folk]] actively participating as skilled divers.
