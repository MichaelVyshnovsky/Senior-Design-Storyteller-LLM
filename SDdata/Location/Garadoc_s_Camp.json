From this breathtaking view, the Black Ravens spied on surrounding movements and they were able to make sudden attacks against the people of the south. The Black Ravens hunted in the woods and meadows of the Frost Hills.\nThe camp was the base of operations of a band of raiders. They were mostly warriors with no children indeed, the barbarians families were hidden in nearby safer villages.\nThis camp was ruled by Garamel Talonhand, a female veteran explorer and a bandit who criticized outsiders as weak and decadent.\n* Garamel Talonhand\n* Kelemoc Ravenheart\n* Vagha the Bloody\n* Jomol the Old"
