Caerwich was a small island, known to sailors as a legendary and haunted place located somewhere on the Sea of Swords.
The island had a conical shape, and was no more than a few hundred yards wide. It was perpetually covered in a blueish mist. The waters around the island hid a reef, which, combined with the mist, resulted in the area becoming a graveyard for ships that ran against it. The sailors who perished in the aforementioned ships became zombies, and would raise from the sunken ships to attack any visitors to the island.
The interior of the island was covered in thick bushes and ferns, which were home to many exotic birds. On the northern side of the island, an opening to the Moaning Cave was hidden under hanging moss. This cavern was round in shape, about a hundred feet long and filled with stalactites, in addition to being a dead-magic zone.
The island was a place mostly known through rumors and legendsâ€”very few sailors were able to travel to it and come back to tell the tale.
Apart from the zombies and birds, the only inhabitant was a blind hag, known to sailors as the Witch of the Moaning Cave.
The island was located roughly  southwest of the westernmost point of the Moonshae Isles. About halfway between Caerwich and the Moonshaes were the Gull Rocks. 
In the , Captain Deudermont upon hearing the name of the island when assaulted by a doppleganger, embarked on a journey to Caerwich with his friends. When they reached their destination, they fended off an attack from the local zombie population and received a prophetic riddle relating to Drizzt DoUrden from the Witch of the Moaning Cave.
