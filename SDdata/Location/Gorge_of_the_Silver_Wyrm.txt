}}The '''Gorge of the Silver Wyrm''' was a canyon in [[Hartsvale]] through which the [[Wyrm River]] flowed.

==Description==
The gorge was deep and dark. On one side of the canyon, the walls were sheer [[granite]] cliffs, against which the Wyrm River flowed. On the other side was a road full of ruts that led to the mines of Earl [[Radborne Wynn]]. Small footpaths led up a steep, rocky slope to the various [[silver]] mines from the road. Pine trees used to cover the slope, but were cut down because of the mining.

==Geography==
The gorge was found within the [[Ice Spires|Ice Spires South]].

==History==
[[Silver]] was discovered in the gorge by the Wynn family early in the history of Hartsvale, and this silver supported the country as its primary export.

It was in this canyon, in [[1369 DR]], that Queen [[Brianna Burdun]] and her escorts were ambushed first by [[fire giant]]s
