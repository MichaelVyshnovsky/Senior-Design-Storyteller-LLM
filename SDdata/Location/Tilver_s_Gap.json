        "mainbody": "ilvers Gap was a major pass through the Thunder Peaks that sat at an intersection of the Dalelands, the Stonelands, and Cormyr. It was home to the independent city of Tilverton, which was annexed by Cormyr and ultimately destroyed by the forces of Thultanthar.\nTilvers Gap cut a wide east-west passage through the northern Thunder Peaks, providing an ideal route through the mountain range. It met the Dalelands and Cormanthor forest to the east, bordering Mistledale, Sessrendale, and Semberholme. To the north, the Thunder Peaks met the Desertsmouth Mountains, with only the narrow climb of Shadow Gap allowing passage. Eastwards, the dry plains of the Gap turned to the desolate and inhospitable Stonelands and the foothills of the Storm Horns, while to the south the foothills of the Thunder Peaks were interrupted by the upper Immerflow river as it ran its course into the heart of Cormyr.\nThe Moonsea Ride passed straight through Tilvers Gap, and the North Ride intersected it at the city of Tilverton at the western end of the pass. The Gap was critical to trade and travel between Cormyr, the Dalelands, and the Moonsea, and regularly came under threat from foreign agents and barbaric raiders from the Stonelands and beyond. After 1356 DR, Cormyrean soldiers were deployed to patrol these routes, with squads of heavily-equipped mounted warriors supported by War Wizards.\nThe plains, hills, and forests of the Gap were home to hunters, trappers, prospectors, and loggers, with ranching and horse breeding also popular. The annexation of Tilverton brought a number of Cormyrean frontiersmen and merchants who saw opportunities in the newly-secured lands.\nIn ancient times, the Gap was part of the sprawling woodlands of Cormanthor, linking the western Forest Country to it through the Thunder Peaks. Netheril conquered the Gap and held it as its southern frontier, driving the native orc and goblin tribes south deeper into the Forest Country, and constructing the fortress of Blister in -1286 DR. The fortress overlooked the Gap from the edge of the mountains, and served as a regional base for defending the whole southern frontier and supporting colonial expeditions beyond. Despite the magical and military power of Netheril, the frontier collapsed over centuries and Blister was isolated while orcs and goblins effectively controlled the Gap and future Stonelands. Blister was finally destroyed in -312 DR by an army of kobolds, 27 years after the fall of Netheril.\nAfter Netheril, the only settlement of note in Tilvers Gap was Tilverton, both of which were named after the archwizard Tilvara who made her home there. In 1356 DR, Cormyr deployed an army of Purple Dragons to the Gap in order to protect Tilverton from oncoming threats in the region, including marauding orcs, the Zhentarim, and the conquests of Lashan Aumersair. In Kythorn of that year an army of thousands of orcs was destroyed while it besieged Tilverton, and the city shortly agreed to become a protectorate of the Dragon Throne. The Purple Dragons then used the Gap as a secure base to operate from, striking forth and fighting the Zhentarim in Daggerdale and adjoining lands.\nTilverton was destroyed during battle with the forces of Thultanthar in 1372 DR, creating the Black Crater. Despite the loss of the city, Cormyr kept the Gap as part of the realm, going on to fortify the area, reroute the Moonsea Ride, and support the settlement of New Tilverton.\nThe Spellplague of 1385 DR resulted in the Black Crater becoming a plagueland, the Tilverton Scar. Despite the increased dangers, Cormyr continued to hold onto the region."
