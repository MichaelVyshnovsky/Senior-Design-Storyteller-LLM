'''Eiresse''' was a tiny pirate cove on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].

It lay near the southwestern tip of the island, nominally a part of the kingdom of [[Corwell]]. It faced the eastern capes of the island of [[Flamsterd]].

By the cozy harbor stood a small tower, where lived the pirate [[Cairak Redbeard]] and [[Alabhansree Alanasker]], known locally as as "Cymra Shanbadhe", The Lady in Silver, but really a princess of [[Ormpur]] who'd gone missing in [[1357 DR]]. They still lived there by [[1372 DR]]. Beneath the cove were winding natural sinkholes that led to the sea, where cold-water [[giant octopus]]es laired.
