Eiresse was a tiny pirate cove on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles.
It lay near the southwestern tip of the island, nominally a part of the kingdom of Corwell. It faced the eastern capes of the island of Flamsterd.
By the cozy harbor stood a small tower, where lived the pirate Cairak Redbeard and Alabhansree Alanasker, known locally as as "Cymra Shanbadhe", The Lady in Silver, but really a princess of Ormpur whod gone missing in 1357 DR. They still lived there by 1372 DR. Beneath the cove were winding natural sinkholes that led to the sea, where cold-water giant octopuses laired.
