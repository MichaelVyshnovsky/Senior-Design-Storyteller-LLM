'''Civilized Phlan''' referred to the section of [[Phlan]] that was reclaimed and rebuilt after the city's long history of destruction and rebuilding.

==Description==
Civilized Phlan was surrounded by thick stone walls to help separate it from the hidden evils buried beneath the ruins as countless chambers were sealed off over the centuries.
