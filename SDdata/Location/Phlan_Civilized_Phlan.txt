Civilized Phlan referred to the section of Phlan that was reclaimed and rebuilt after the citys long history of destruction and rebuilding.
Civilized Phlan was surrounded by thick stone walls to help separate it from the hidden evils buried beneath the ruins as countless chambers were sealed off over the centuries.
