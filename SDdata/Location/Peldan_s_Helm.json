        "mainbody": "'''Peldan's Helm''' was a small town located in the western region of [[Mistledale]], in the [[Dalelands]], during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It stood as a refuge for [[Humanoid|humanity]] in the [[Beast Country]] during their conflicts with the [[goblinoid]] species within, and out further west.",
        "Description": "The town of Peldan's Helm comprised stone cottages that were encircled by tall stone walls. Due to the inherent danger of the region, citizens would go about their daily lives of farming and woodcutting in large bands, finding increased safety in numbers.\n\nDue to the rather open area, compared to the more forested dales, the region around Peldan's Helm had been the site of many battles over the centuries. As a result, many of the town's bolder farmers and woodcutters would often come across such finds as prized treasure, valuable relics from long-past conflicts, or the occasional hastily dug mass grave.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of [[1367 DR]], all the inhabitants of the town claimed descent from its founder, [[Peldan Faern]]. These citizens were, in large part, people of the forest, that is [[ranger]]s, hunters, and woodsmen. Among these were a number of furniture makers, carvers, and other woodworkers, who practiced their craft within the safety of the town's walls. Those courageous enough to venture out of their protection were well-warned to do so armed and with capability to cry alarm and call for help should any danger prove more than they could handle.\n\nDespite the wariness of the town, it attracted a large number of adventurers and monster hunters from neighboring [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]]. The locals felt every creature that was slain was one fewer to antagonize their town.",
        "History": "The Helm began as an independent freehold under the stewardship of the retired [[Cormyr]]ian soldier, Peldan Faern. As legend stated, Peldan plunged his [[greatsword]] into the ground, laid his helm upon the pommel, and claimed all the land within its sight as his own.",
        "Notable locations": "* Meeting Hall: This building was the favored meeting place for discussions regarding all the important matters within the town, served as a rallying point for the local militia, and housed religious services for the good-aligned, and [[Nature domain|nature]]-related [[deities]]. Peldan's greatsword and his helm were hung with pride from its rafters.\n* [[The Man With Fire in His Hands]]: A fairly average inn/tavern so named for the portrait hung over the bar of a long-dead local [[wizard]]."
