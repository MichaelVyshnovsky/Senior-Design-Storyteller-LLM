        "mainbody": "hackles Ward was one of the wards of the city of Calimport.\nShackles Ward was the poorest ward of the city, inhabited primarily by slaves and slavers. It was the most southwestern ward of the city and lay outside the city wall.\nThe drudach walls within the ward were strangely nonexistent, the stones having been scavenged over the years for other uses.\nThe fourth son of Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal, Sultan Harun el Pesarkhal had official control of Shackles Ward. His vizar was Kamal el Estarq. Both of them were controlled by the Twisted Rune, through their agent Tamol yr Pirit, who was a lover of Kamal. Both men were aware of their manipulation by this jhasina they went along with it, knowing that the Twisted Rune made for powerful allies.\nShackles Ward was divided into four sabbans with thirteen drudachs.\nAlso known as \"Slaver Sabban\" or \"the Flesh Market\", this sabban served as the holding area for new slaves being prepared for sale. It used to contain four drudachs, but the fourth, located in the center of the sabban, became a refuge dumb. Later, it was entirely enclosed with mud bricks, such that now a raised platform exists. This platform was as high as the sabban walls and served as a central marketplace for the sale of slaves.\nHundreds of thousands of slaves lived in this sabban, within tiny tents or shacks.\nThe sabban mark for this sabban was a shackled hand and chain. It contained three drudachs&mdashSuq Drudach, Filus Drudach, and Yrsh Drudach.\n The Fetters  This fancy, two-story building was the location of the guildhouse for the Slavemasters Circle. Location Filus Drudach.\n The House of Nine Blessings  This two-story temple of Loviatar had white-glazed brick with a black and blue mosaic of Loviatars whip. Location Suq Drudach.\n Katars High  This two-story tavern catered to those buying slaves. However, it had a secret entrance to the Muzad used by escaping slaves. Location Suq Drudach.\n The Strong Arms  This three-story former-khanduq was the guildhall for the Mighty Guild of Bouncers, Laborers, and Sellswords. Location Yrsh Drudach.\n Amlakkhan Edijo  This three-story minaret served as the amlakkhan for Edijo Sabban. It had additional amlakkar to protect against slave uprisings. Location Yrsh Drudach (at the intersection of Edijo Sabban).\nAlso known as \"Penitents Sabban\", this district served as a secondary holding area for new slaves as well as a place to house the sick and dying. It was located on the southwestern tip of the city and sat atop a 30-foot cliff overlooking the coast. Because of the number of sick people clustered here, it was often the starting point for epidemics.\nThe sabban mark for this sabban was two eyes with tear drops. It contained three drudachs&mdashSalit Drudach, Galit Drudach, and Agnab Drudach.\n RÃ´ghiian Stables  This was little more than a small wooden shack. Location Salit Drudach.\n House of the Bound Hands  This two-story building with a three-story minaret was a temple to Ilmater. Location Galit Drudach.\n The Adhavensarai  This cheaply built, two-story former-khanduq was one of the only places slaves could freely purchase items in the city. Location Agnab Drudach.\nAlso known as \"Sadimmin Sabban\", this westernmost area of the city served as a military base for the Sadimmin, the Calishite army. New recruits tended to be posted here, as opposed to the other garrisons around the city. It contained three drudachs&mdashMarkif Dudach, Ibahr Drudach, and Astek Drudach.\n Amlakkhan Minqa  This three-story minaret served as the amlakkhan for Minqa Sabban. Like Amlakkhan Edijo, it had additional amlakkar. Location Markif Drudach.\n Dome of the Balak  This villa contained three domed buildings and served as the residence and office of the balak (colonel) in charge of training new recruits to the Sadimmin. Location Ibahr Drudach.\n Garrison Katar  This three-story barracks was where new recruits hoping to join the Farisans or the Qysaghanni were housed. Location Ibahr Drudach.\n Fourth Scimitar Garrison  This three-story barracks housed the Fourth Scimitar division of the Sadimmin. Location Astek Drudach.\n Ninth Scimitar Garrison  This three-story barracks housed the Ninth Scimitar division of the Sadimmin. Location Astek Drudach.\n Giidaradah  This opulent two-story house was home of the shyk (major) of Minqa Sabban. Location Astek Drudach.\nAlso known as \"Red Veil Sabban\" or \"Tall Tankards Sabban\", this was the cleanest section of Shackles Ward and was dedicated to entertainment. Located close to the gates to Palace Ward, it tempted merchants and nobles from that ward with brothels, gambling halls, and large, four-story taverns.\nThe sabban mark for this sabban was two oil lamps sharing a single flame, which was the family crest of el Qhibal clan. It contained four drudachs&mdashWaga Drudach, Biteq Drudach, Terbas Drudach, and Selsela Drudach.\n The Beacon of Battle  This poor, two-story, red-glazed brick building served as a temple to Tempus. From here, servants of Tempus sought out gladiators from among the slaves market. Location Biteq Drudach.\n El Muzaddhishadah  This three-story building was the guildhall for the Guild of Plumbers and Sewer-Workers. Location Waga Drudach.\n House of el Niral  This two-story building was the home of el Niral clan. Location Terbas Drudach.\n Villa of Tatir the Slavemaster  This expensive villa was the residence of one of the chief slavemasters of Shackles Ward. Location Selsela Drudach."
