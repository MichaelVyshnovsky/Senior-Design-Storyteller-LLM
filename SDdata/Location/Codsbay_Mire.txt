The Codsbay Mire was a marshland located on the island of Gwynneth within the Moonshae Isles.
The marsh was found in northern Gwynneth where the Codsrun Creek delta met the Strait of Oman on the Sea of Moonshae. Both ends of the marsh covered the Codsbay, covering approximately  including the numerous unnamed small islands within the delta.
The ruins of the village of Manger sat on the southwest border of the Codsbay Mire.
