        "mainbody": "The '''Barrowlands''' was a region of eastern [[Impiltur]], located along the [[Easting Reach]]. It was a dark and foreboding place that existed as a remnant and memory of the ancient realm of [[Narfell]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|56-71}}",
        "Description": "Located south of the [[Old Water]], a few miles north of [[New Sarshel]], the Barrowlands was a barren landscape of earthen mounds that were nearly completely devoid of life. The only known flora was a small, black-leafed shrub that was referred to as [[widow's tear]]s by the local populace.\n\nBeneath the mounds was a series of interconnected chambers. These were affected by [[magic]] that rendered them completely full of darkness, which could not be abated by nearly any natural source of light.",
        "Population": "The Barrowlands were shunned by the local [[Impiltur]]ans and they avoided passing through unless absolutely necessary. As of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], there were rumors about a hidden, subterranean cabal of [[Nar demonbinder]]s that escaped from the [[Great Conflagration (event)|Great Conflagration]] and embraced [[undead|undeath]] as [[lich]]es.",
        "History": "In the [[786 DR|Year of the Moaning Gorge, 786 DR]], the greatly feared [[balor]] [[Ndulu]] appeared in the Barrowlands to wreak havoc and claim vengeance on the Realm of the Sword and Wand.\n\nPrior to his death in the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]], the adventurer [[Yargildas]] traveled through the Barrowlands and reported about his findings.",
