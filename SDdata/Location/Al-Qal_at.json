        "mainbody": "l-Qalat,The map for Corsairs of the Great Sea shows an alternate spelling of \"Qalat.\" also called the Fortress, was a highly contested island in the Great Sea off the coast of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR.\nThe island sat offshore roughly  from Qudra to the southeast and Liham to the east. The island itself measured  in length and  wide. Much of the island was dry and barren, with three separate plateaus jutting from its center. The western side of the island was forested.\nMany corsair captains laid claim to the prized island because of its strategic location within easy striking distance of their hated enemy, the mamluks of Qudra. However, the corsairs inability to work together cohesively prevented any permanent presence on the island."
