The Imnescourse Trail also passed along the southern edge near the Small Teeth.\n* Battlescarred Bard, an inn on the Trade Way.\n* Harvest House, a temple of Chauntea.\n* Imnescar, a town in the foothills of the Small Teeth.\n* Esford, a village in the west.\n* The Narthaen estate.\n* Ombreir, the fortified country estate of the Araunvol family.\n* Shepherdston, a village in the west."
