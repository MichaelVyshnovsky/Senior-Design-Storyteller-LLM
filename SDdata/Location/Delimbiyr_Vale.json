        "mainbody": "The '''Delimbiyr Vale''', also known as the '''Shining Valley''', encompassing the western, upper reaches of the [[Delimbiyr River]]. The vale was a nigh-endless stretch of sweeping valley that attracted travelers and settlers who could brave life in the [[Savage Frontier]]. However, parts of it were forsaken, filled with falling ruins, monsters, and ancient secrets.",

            "Geographic Features": {
                "Bodies of Water": "* [[Delimbiyr River]]: The great river ran all the way through the valley before emptying into the [[Lizard Marsh]].\n* [[Loagrann]]: This river flowed through a part of the Greypeaks, at the landmark of [[Deadstone Cleft]].",
                "Forests": "* [[Far Forest]]: This grove formed the northern point of the [[Triangle of Trees]].\n* [[Laughing Hollow]]: Seldom visited by men, this [[fey]]-inhabited forest was home to the [[wild elf]] known as the [[King of the Woods]].\n* [[Misty Forest]]\n* [[South Wood]]: The aptly named southern point of the Triangle of Trees was home to a [[Zhentarim]] stronghold.",
                "Mountains": "* [[Greypeak Mountains]]: The rocky mountains in the eastern region of the Vale earned their name from the [[stone giant]]s that dwelled amongst their peaks.\n:* [[Dawn Pass]]: One of the few passes that cut through the Greypeak Mountains, the Dawn Pass was the only route that could accommodate wagons.\n:* [[Seshrentor]]: This tower in the Greypeaks was once home to a powerful [[lich]].",
                "Regions": "* [[Gray Vale]]: The fertile, southeastern stretch of the valley\n* [[Fallen Lands]]: Located in the eastern region of the vale, this area held a number of old ruins and magical anomalies.\n* [[Upvale]]: The northern stretch of the valley separated the [[Tall Trees]] of the High Forest from the Far Forest to the east.",
                "Wetlands": "* [[Lonely Moor]]: This solitary scrub land was located near the Anauroch Desert.\n* [[Lizard Marsh]]: Before the Delimbiyr River opened into the [[Trackless Sea]], it formed this network of streams, waterways and swampland."

        "History": "The ancient elven realm of [[Eaerlann]] once held much of the upper Delimbiyr Vale, with its western border lying {{SI|100|mile|k}} west of the River Delimbiyr. They established a great fortress at the head of the valley; called Ascalhorn, it became Hellgate Keep.<ref>\n\nThe [[Barony of Steeping Falls]] was formed on the northern back of the Delimbiyr River, in the {{YearlinkName|133}}, by the [[vampire]] [[Artor Morlin]]. It stood for almost three centuries before dissolving.\n\nA half-century later, in the {{YearlinkName|183}}, the kingdom of [[Athalantar]] was founded by the Stag King, [[Uthgrael Aumar]]. The king and his son both oversaw the realm for some time, before it was taken over by the powerful [[magelord]]s. The Kingdom of the Stag was freed from their unjust rule by the [[Chosen]] of [[Mystra]] [[Elminster Aumar]] and saw prosperity for over a century. Unfortunately, Athalantar was wiped out by a horde of marauding [[orc]]s in the {{YearlinkName|342}}.\n\nFor hundreds of years, the [[demon]]ic forces of [[Hellgate Keep]] controlled a stretch of the Delimbiyr Vale, but the fall of that ancient citadel in the {{YearlinkName|1369}} put an end to its authority in the region.\n{{Sectstub}}",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Settlements": "* [[Daggerford]]: The walled city of the vale was built around a keep that sat atop a small hill overlooking the coast.\n* [[Julkoun]]: Surrounded by a moat and wooden palisade, this small village was well-protected from nearby [[bandit]]s.\n* [[Llorkh]]: Founded by [[dwarves]] and men, this mining town was taken over by the [[Zhentarim]] for a time, before being completely abandoned.\n* [[Loudwater]]: A town by the river.\n* [[Orlbar]]: This small farming village was located at the junction of [[Loagrann]] and Greyflow rivers. It was once controlled by the Zhentarim, but was abandoned when attacked by [[stone giant]]s in the 1480s DR.<ref>\n* [[Secomber]]: The folk of this town lived well off the land but had to defend against monstrous creatures such as [[hobgoblin]]s.\n* [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]]: An ancient [[shield dwarf]] kingdom that existed below the upper Delimbiyr Vale."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-to-late 1300s DR, [[lightfoot halfling]]s had settlements along the banks of the lower Delimbiyr, with the greatest concentration around Secomber. [[Tiefling]]s, the progeny of the demons of Hellgate Keep, were found the upper Delimbiyr Vale.\n\nHowever, ''circa'' 1372 DR, few seemed to be interested in founding a settlement in the region of the vale near the [[Silver Marches]] as it was a desolate region.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, many settlers of the North were attracted to the lands of the Delimbiyr Vale.\n\nBeyond the civilized folk, the vale was home to monsters and monstrous [[humanoid]]s, such as hobgoblins and [[bugbear]]s.\n\nIn the [[Underdark]] caverns beneath this wild land dwelt a demonic general known as [[Kaanyr Vhok]], the Sceptered One, who had amassed an army of [[tanarukk]]s and [[fiendish]] beasts."
