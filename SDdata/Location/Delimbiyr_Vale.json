The vale was a nigh-endless stretch of sweeping valley that attracted travelers and settlers who could brave life in the Savage Frontier. However, parts of it were forsaken, filled with falling ruins, monsters, and ancient secrets.\nThe Vale was bound on the north by the Nether Mountains and to the south by the South Wood. Its western edge was the High Forest but no part of the High Forest was considered a part of the Vale. Despite this, the High Forest in the south ran almost to the banks of the Delimbiyr, narrowing the Vale considerably.\nTwo areas of the Delimbiyr Vale were often referred to as Upvale and Gray Vale by the locals. Upvale was an area of open grasslands in the northern Delimbiyr Vale between Tall Trees and the Far Forest. Gray Vale was in the southwest and consisted of the area of grasslands through which the rivers Greyflow and Loagrann flowed.\nThe lower Delimbiyr had floodplains, situated around Daggerford.\nBodies of Water\n* Delimbiyr River The great river ran all the way through the valley before emptying into the Lizard Marsh.\n* Loagrann This river flowed through a part of the Greypeaks, at the landmark of Deadstone Cleft.\nForests\n* Far Forest This grove formed the northern point of the Triangle of Trees.\n* Laughing Hollow Seldom visited by men, this fey-inhabited forest was home to the wild elf known as the King of the Woods.\n* Misty Forest\n* South Wood The aptly named southern point of the Triangle of Trees was home to a Zhentarim stronghold.\nMountains\n* Greypeak Mountains The rocky mountains in the eastern region of the Vale earned their name from the stone giants that dwelled amongst their peaks.\n* Dawn Pass One of the few passes that cut through the Greypeak Mountains, the Dawn Pass was the only route that could accommodate wagons.\n* Seshrentor This tower in the Greypeaks was once home to a powerful lich.\nRegions\n* Gray Vale The fertile, southeastern stretch of the valley\n* Fallen Lands Located in the eastern region of the vale, this area held a number of old ruins and magical anomalies.\n* Upvale The northern stretch of the valley separated the Tall Trees of the High Forest from the Far Forest to the east.\nWetlands\n* Lonely Moor This solitary scrub land was located near the Anauroch Desert.\n* Lizard Marsh Before the Delimbiyr River opened into the Trackless Sea, it formed this network of streams, waterways and swampland.\nThe ancient elven realm of Eaerlann once held much of the upper Delimbiyr Vale, with its western border lying  west of the River Delimbiyr. They established a great fortress at the head of the valley called Ascalhorn, it became Hellgate Keep.\nThe Barony of Steeping Falls was formed on the northern back of the Delimbiyr River, in the , by the vampire Artor Morlin. It stood for almost three centuries before dissolving.\nA half-century later, in the , the kingdom of Athalantar was founded by the Stag King, Uthgrael Aumar. The king and his son both oversaw the realm for some time, before it was taken over by the powerful magelords. The Kingdom of the Stag was freed from their unjust rule by the Chosen of Mystra Elminster Aumar and saw prosperity for over a century. Unfortunately, Athalantar was wiped out by a horde of marauding orcs in the .\nFor hundreds of years, the demonic forces of Hellgate Keep controlled a stretch of the Delimbiyr Vale, but the fall of that ancient citadel in the  put an end to its authority in the region.\nLandmarks\n* Dungeon of the Hark A group of wererat bandits launched their raids from this underground domain.\n* Halls of the Hammer The whereabouts of the dwarves that dwelled within this hold was unknown to the locals.\n* Hammer Hall Since abandoned, this lone cabin was the home to a group of adventurers.\n* The Nighthunt Favored by adventurers, this tavern was located about a days ride east of Loudwater.\n* The Mosque of Tyr A temple-stronghold dedicated to the Maimed God.
