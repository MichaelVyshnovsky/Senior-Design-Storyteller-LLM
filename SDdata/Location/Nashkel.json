        "mainbody": "above sea level\nNashkel was an Amnian town on the northern slopes of the Cloud Peaks. Although a part of Amn, Nashkel was separated from the rest of the realm by the mountains and was relatively autonomous.\nThe town lay on the lower northern slopes of the Cloud Peaks, and at an altitude of  above sea level it was the highest town in Amn, with the next highest being Imnescar and those around Lake Weng. Its outlying farms were the northernmost extent of Amns claimed territory. It was near the confluence of the Trade Way, Bitten Road, and Uldoon Trail. It suffered harsh winter storms every year, but the locals were hardy and took it in stride.\nNashkel was the main overland trade route between Amn and the Sword Coast, but was frequently isolated from the south by winter blizzards and storms in the mountain passes.\nThe town exported barley, beers, sheep and their wool, and the meat and pelts of hunted game (there was little demand for furs in Amn proper, but its merchants were happy to trade it onwards). It also provided expert guides for those traveling in the nearby mountains, as well as supplies and equipment for caravans as they passed through. At least once per winter season a caravan would refuse to hire guides or buy assistance before heading through the Cloud Peaks, only to require immediate rescue. On occasion a caravan might only be found again in the next spring.\nEnterprising merchants sometimes organized tourist groups in Nashkel, and took them to visit Durlags Tower far to the north.\nSometime before Mirtul, in the , the Cyricist cleric Mulahey and his kobold minions began to contaminate the iron mines outside of Nashkel. He did so under the direction of the bandit leader Tazok, and by extension, Rieltar Anchev of the Iron Throne. These events directly led to the Iron Crisis that plagued the Sword Coast in the same year. As tensions built up between Amn and Baldurs Gate, Nashkel became a staging point for Amnian soldiers as they prepared for battle against the Flaming Fist.\nThat same year a traveling carnival came to Nashkel and set up just east of town. It featured a number of merchant stalls, gambling tents end even performers such as the Great Gazib and the Amazing Oopah.\nShops\n* Cloud Peak Outfitters Equipment shop for mountain travelers run by Salla Pitontoes, a halfling cleric of Tymora.\n* Nashkel Store, a general store.\n* Plashdeep Stables, a horse trader.\nTemples\n* Icedawns House, a shrine to Auril.\n* The Temple of Helm, overseen by the cleric Nalin.\n* The Abbey of Highsong, a Sorlyn temple some distance northwest of town.\nTaverns and Inns\n* The Belching Dragon A fairly ordinary, drinks-only tavern.\n* The Nashkel Inn, a simple inn.\n* The Northern Light An inn and tavern permanently lit by magical lights.\nOther\n* Nashkel carnival, a carnival that set up in 1370 DR.\n* Nashkel mines, the expansive iron mines nearby in the mountains.\n* A refuge south of the town between the Eggs of the Dragon and the Staring Ranger.\n* Mayor Berrun Ghastkill, of the Ghastkill family.\n* DaerRagh, an anti-social mage.\n* Loaber Plashdeep, a Harper agent.\n* Noober, a very annoying man."
