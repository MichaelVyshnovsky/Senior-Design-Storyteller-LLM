Elven Port was a flourishing elven city that stood at the edges of the High Forest.
Its piers were wetted by the river Delimbiyr. Elven Port was long one of the most accessible ruins of old Earlann and it was visited by several groups of adventurers. For many years, the ruins of Elven Port had provided cover to marauders and a few predators. However, by 1366 DR, the old tower of the towns lord was occupied by a powerful group of daemonfey, led by Vaerilmor Floshin. Vaerilmor and his followers were luring elven adventurers to corrupt them with their foul magic.
Between 1366 DR and 1372 DR, all the adventurers who came across this place disappeared without leaving any traces.
