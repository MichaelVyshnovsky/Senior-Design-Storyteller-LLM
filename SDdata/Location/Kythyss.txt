'''Kythyss''' was a small coastal town located in the kingdom of [[Callidyrr]] on the island of [[Alaron]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
Kythyss was the southernmost settlement found on Alaron. It was located at the tail end of the [[High King's Road]] where the [[Sea of Swords]] and the [[South Great Head]] met. Kythyss was found in the county of [[Stirgewick]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Kythyss had been infiltrated by [[Amn]]ian [[mercenary|mercenaries]] from [[Snowdown]] who were aided by traitors.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|4}} This occurred since the citizens were desperate for protection given that High King [[Derid Kendrick|Derid]]'s forces were occupied elsewhere. The natives of Kythyss decided to hire mercenaries to help protect the town. The same mercenaries were bribed to serve the needs of Viceroy [[Erliza Daressin]] of [[Westphal]]. These mercenaries were led by [[Ghelvan|Ghelvan "the Buzzard"]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|7}}
