Chessenta was one of the so-called [[Old Empires]] of [[Faerûn]].\n\n{{Quote|Chessenta is a mosaic of a nation that was made by ten different artists, all of them blindfolded|[[Heptios]], mage of [[Cimbar]].}}",

        },
        "History": "Chessenta was founded in {{Yearlink|-1771}} as an autonomous province of the first [[Unther]]ic empire. It was named after their first Grand Viceroy, [[Iphram Chess]]. His first official proclamation was the cleansing of all indigenous species, notably the [[Turami]] peoples of the [[Akanûl|Akana]] and the [[Batoi]] [[halfling]]s along the [[Adder River]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|70}}\n\nIn [[929 DR]] the city states of Chessenta, led by the war hero [[Tchazzar]], drove the armies of Unther to the [[Riders to the Sky]] mountains, freeing Chessenta from Untheric rule. During Tchazzar's brief Chessentan Empire, the city of [[Cimbar]] was the capital of Chessenta. In [[1018 DR]], Tchazzar disappeared while fighting [[sahuagin]] and the people of Chessenta believed he had ascended to [[god]]hood. After Tchazzar's disappearance, the kingdom slowly broke apart into squabbling city states, around [[1117 DR]]. Tchazzar returned in [[1373 DR]] to reestablish his kingdom but disappeared again following the chaos of the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]].\n\nIn the decades after the Spellplague the war hero [[Ishual Karanok]] rose to rule Chessenta. Under his guidance, Chessenta was unified as a single nation again. During the rule of the [[House Karanok|Karanok]] dynasty, during the 15th century DR, the capital of Chessenta was the city of [[Luthcheq]]. In [[1479 DR]], his descendant, [[Shala Karanok]], was the ruler of Chessenta\n\nUnder Tchazzar's guidance, Chessenta was finally able to conquer [[Threskel]], making it a vassal state. However, Tchazzar slowly descended to madness and tried to destroy Luthcheq, and was eventually defeated by the Shala's loyalists, the Brotherhood of the Griffon, the army of [[Akanûl]] and a group of knights from [[Tymanther]] at the [[Battle of Luthcheq]]. After the battle, Shala was reinstated as the war hero.\n\nFollowing the chaos of the [[Second Sundering]], Chessenta once again broke apart into squabbling city states.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Q&A 16}}",
        "Religion": "After the Spellplague, [[Amaunator]] gained many followers who saw him as the ancient Untherian god [[Hokatep]] returned to [[Faerûn]].  As Chessenta was a martial society, [[Tempus]] had many followers. [[Oghma]] had a large temple in [[Erebos]] and, since [[Kelemvor]] had almost no presence in the region, the temple of [[Waukeen]] assumed responsibility for tending to the dead.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta}}\n\nIn addition to the common Faerûnian religions there were several regional cults.  The [[Cult of Tchazzar]] always had a large membership in Chessenta and with Tchazzar's return the cult was been reinvigorated and was building a huge temple in Luthcheq in 1479 DR.  The Cult of [[Entropy]] worshiped the [[primordial]] [[Entropy]] and a cult worshiped the archfey [[Sebakar]], the Lord of Crocodiles.",
