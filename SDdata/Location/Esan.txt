'''Esan''' was a community of weavers and one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].

==Description==
Esan was a village concerned with upholding their idea of morality, following the order of [[shogun]] [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1769|WY}} to raise the nation's moral standards. Non-married men and women were not allowed to associate together, and women had to walk at least 10 steps behind any men. The people of Esan were thus suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming.

Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.

The village had a population of about 410 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.

==Geography==
Esan was located on the eastern side of the Fochu Peninsula of [[Tsukishima]]. A trail led to the southwest to [[Zuke]], and another trail let northeast into the foothills of the [[Jofosu Range]].

==Government==
Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]], and Esan was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed. The ''shoya'' of Esan after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was [[Ginoyo Yashishira]], a man obsessed with proper "morals".

==Trade==
Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Esan had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The people were weavers, but there is no evidence that they actively traded their goods with other settlements.

The cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 4 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 5 [[yuan]] to sell.

==Defenses==
About 41 citizens of Esan served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.

==Religion==
Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Esan were strict followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]]. They were usually strongly opposed to anyone visiting their village who would not demonstrate devotion to the Path by making a donation to a shrine, reciting a prayer, or spitting on the symbol of [[Chauntea]], who was considered a heretical faith.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Etsi Hashoto]], a [[butterfly]]-collector.

==History==
Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. One of the villagers, Etsi Hashoto, purchased one of these strange, human-faced insects from someone who had found it in the Jofosu Mountains.
