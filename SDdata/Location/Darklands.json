This vast subterranean realm stretched all the way from Cairnheim in the west to Traaskl Thorog in the east.\nThe great duergar city of Dunspeirrin was the most powerful stronghold in the region. However, the duergar controlled only a relatively small part of the Darklands, owing to the sheer size of the region.\nCategoryRegions\nCategoryLocations in the Underdark\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\npipu771xz3gfy5wgqqqaw5pgs2sfx05"
