        "mainbody": "he Hall of Mists, located deep inside the High Forest, was an ancient stronghold of the Baetith, an organization of sages and lorekeepers that began in the ancient sarrukh empire of Isstosseffifil. Their role as the constructors of this temple remained in the form of two stone golems resembling bipedal dinosaurs.\nThese golems protected gates within the temple that allowed one access to both realms in the Outer Planes and the Negative Material Plane. They also guarded several ornamental treasures, including gold and Platinum statuary, religious ornaments, and a number of magical artifacts.\nThe Hall of Mists were also guarded by a powerful arakhor, known as the Grandfather Tree, summoned here by the elves in . Wards around the tree, presumably placed by them, prevented anything from breaching the gates from their opposite sides.\nIn , an unknown thief stole seven of the Nether Scrolls, and three of them were hidden away in the Halls of Mists. The three Nether Scrolls were later scattered to other locations by Mintiper Moonsilver in 1344 DR.\nIn the Year of the Fell Firebreak, 883 DR, the magical chaos emanating from Hellgate Keep caused the place to be infested by giant red ants. The ants tunneled deep and opened passages to the Halls of Mists."
