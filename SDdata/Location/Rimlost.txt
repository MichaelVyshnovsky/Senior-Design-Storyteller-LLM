Rimlost was a tower located on the northern region of Fimbrul, that served as a temple for the followers of the primordial cults of Laerakond.
Rimlost was the most sacred place of worship in Laerakond. Followers of the primordials never spoke of the site for fear that dragons would discover it and form a coalition to destroy the tower.
The town of the same name in Gontal was founded in 1385 DR by Prince Nathur Hethkantan as his way to honor this tower.
