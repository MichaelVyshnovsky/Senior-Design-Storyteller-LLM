'''Rimlost''' was a tower located on the northern region of [[Fimbrul]], that served as a temple for the followers of the [[primordial]] cults of [[Laerakond]].

== Background ==
Rimlost was the most sacred place of worship in Laerakond. Followers of the primordials never spoke of the site for fear that [[dragon]]s would discover it and form a coalition to destroy the tower.

==Legacy==
The [[Rimlost (keep)|town]] of the same name in [[Gontal]] was founded in [[1385 DR]] by Prince [[Nathur Hethkantan]] as his way to honor this tower.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|82}}
