        "Geography": "Ankaram was located between the [[River Ith]] and the [[River Agis|River Memnon]]. It was bordered by the [[Sea of Swords]] in the west and the [[Forest of Mir]] in the east.<ref name=LoI1:T-map>\n\nThe region was sparsely populated but included several well-guarded forts along the border, so Calimshan was cautious about ever attacking it.\n\nThe duchy contained two counties, [[Calimmon]] and [[Monteshi]], the latter of which included [[Monrativi Teshy Mir]], an area of contention between Calimshan and Tethyr.\n\nAnkaram was the location of two of the most dangerous adventuring sites of Tethyr, the ruined cities of [[Shoonach]] and [[Memnonnar]].",
        "Government": "In [[1369 DR]], Duchess [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] ruled Ankaram, officially from her castle of [[Maratimmir]], 30 miles east of the city of [[Myratma]].",
        "History": "Ankaram was given to Tethyr as a gift in {{Yearlink|-150}} by [[Syl-pasha|Syl-Pasha]] [[Kamus el Tarshaj]] of Calimshan.\n\nBefore the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]], this duchy was known as \"Ankramir\". After Queen [[Zaranda Star]] rose to power in [[1369 DR]], Ankaram was considered a part of the [[Ankramir|Principality of Ankramir]], which also included [[Kamlann]] and the [[Purple Marches]]."
