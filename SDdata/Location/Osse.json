It lay between the [[Eastern Sea]] of Kara-Tur and the [[Western Ocean]] before Maztica, and north of the [[Southern Ocean]].

        "People": "The people of this land were known as the Osse,{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Incarnates, Soulborn, Totemists}} or [[Osslander]]s. An aboriginal people with an ancient culture, they had strong ties to their ancestors and to their land, and in touch with the natural world. They believed all things had spirits, from trees to rocks to the air itself. They venerated these natural spirits and the spirits of the ancestors alike.\n\nThey gave rise to [[spirit shaman]]s, shamanic priests who commanded the spirit world, and to [[totemist]]s, who channeled the raw [[magic]] of nature spirits, in the form of [[incarnum]]. Spirit shamans went on quests to discover their path in life, to preserve nature, and to balance the spirit world. This walkabout could take these spirit shamans as far as the distant continent of [[Faerûn]].",
