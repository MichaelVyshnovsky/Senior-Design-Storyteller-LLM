        "mainbody": "'''Silverscales''' was a neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]], located in the [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]] on the west side of the city wall. The various seaside businesses, taverns and inns were tucked away in narrow alleys and under staircases, built on the mudflats along the coast of the [[Dragon Reach]]. It was a rough-and-tumble, seedy region of the city dominated by the scent of sea water and not-so-fresh fish.",
        "Notable locations": {
            "Businesses and Shops": "*[[Ashakar's Accessories]]: An premium-priced curios store that featured items from the [[merfolk]] of the depths of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n*[[Buftooroo's Dry Goods]]: Unlike most of the businesses in Silverscales, this store offered everyday necessities.\n*[[Dock Ice House]]: This establishment was one of the most important businesses on the docks, as they provided for the safe shipment of fish and seafood from the neighborhood's many restaurants and fisheries.\n*[[Fishing Tackle]]: In addition to the typical [[net]]s, hooks, poles and tackle this store offered fish pies and butter-brandy to Ravenian fisherman and seafarers.\n*[[Fresh Fish]]: This aptly-named seafood grocer brought in \"daily specials\", but specialized in crab.\n*[[Misti Morgan's Moonlight Pawnshop]]: The proprietor of this shop, [[Misti]], would lent money to her clients in exchange for items used as collateral.\n*[[Ornagar's Smoked Eels & More]]: This cannery packed all sorts of seafood including [[squid]], [[oyster]]s, and of course, [[eel]]s, that would be shipped throughout [[the Vast]] and the [[Moonsea]].\n*[[Ravens Bluff Fish Market]]: Overseen by the [[Fishmongers Association]], the city's fish market was an amazing spectacle, full of skilled traders, anglers and carts packed with the local catch.\n*[[Samara's Scrimshaw]]: This bulk supplier of bone and shell decorations employed dozens of [[gnome]] carvers.\n*[[Talon's Tattoo Parlor]]: The parlor of the [[half-ogre]] tattoo-artist [[Talon Darkoak]], who was famous among the sailors of the Inner Sea, offered both decorative and [[create magic tattoo|magical tattoos]].\n*[[Talton's Ivory & Scrimshaw]]: [[Talton]] and his assistant carvers offered a large variety of decorative items, such as hair pins and combs, [[scabbard]]s and [[coffer]]s made of bone and [[ivory]].",
            "Inns, Taverns and Restaurants": "*[[Embrol Sludge's Eatery & Shell Shoppe]]: Quite unique in its operations, this establishment functioned as a seafood restaurant and jewelry shop that specialized in sea-themed shell necklaces.\n*[[Endelo's Tankard]]: An old, ramshackle tavern that catered to the poorest sailors that came through the Bluff.\n*[[Flirin's Sea Morsels]]: The seafood delicacies offered by this immensely-popular diner attracted patrons from throughout all of the Bluff, including many nobles.\n*[[Lucky Coin Inn]]: Located on the corner of [[Fishleap Lane]] and [[the Belt]], this run-of-the-mill inn offered generous portions of low-quality food.\n*[[Shark Fin Tavern]]: Converted from an old warehouse, this quality tavern offered a warm atmosphere where Ravenians could enjoy good food and drink.\n*[[Ship's Wheel Tavern]]: An anomaly in Silverscales, this nautical-themed tavern offered an exceptional selection of [[wine]] and [[beer]].\n*[[Silver Lady|Silver Lily]]: While it has been relocated to the [[Seaglimpse]] neighborhood and renamed the [[Silver Lady]], this restaurant was a nice, quiet stop to have a bite.\n*[[Skullv's Bar and Bait]]: This run-down tavern doubled as a bait shop and a restaurant of sorts (though the quality of food was quite poor).\n*[[Swill & Spill Tavern]]: Known as the cheapest bar in Ravens Bluff, this establishment was completely decrepit and outright overrun with [[rat]]s.",
            "Open Areas": "*[[Gullgulp]]: Located on the north end of the neighborhood, this open area was littered with beached boats, discarded sails, nets and other nautical trash.",
