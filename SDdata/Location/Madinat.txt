'''Madinat''', or the '''Round City''', was the name of the main sector of the city of [[Dhaztanar]] in [[Semphar]].

==Description==
Madinat sat next to the harbor of [[Furdah Rustauk]]. It was considered to be the heart of Dhaztanar. As the nickname of the Round City implied, Madinat formed a perfect circle. 

Surrounded by a moat and a strong outer and inner wall, Madinat was the most fortified section of the city. An open courtyard stretched behind the outer walls until it reached a third inner wall. This wall protected the houses of notable citizens, gardens, temples, and the palace of the caliph.

Four gates in the walls, known as the [[Grand Bab]], led to the Caliph's palace, the [[Dar al-Kalif]].
