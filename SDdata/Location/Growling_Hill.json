        "Description": "Originally the site of a [[wizard]]'s tower, the site fell to ruin and became buried by mud and grass growth, resembling a small irregularly shaped hill. An intermittent growling sound of unknown origin could be heard if one pressed their ear to the ground. Local parents claimed there was a great beast living under the hill, who would surely eat naughty children.",
        "Geography": "The hill was about a day's walk northeast of [[Crimmor]] not far from the [[Bitten Road]], north of the [[Alandor River]] and west of [[Minsor Vale]] and [[Lake Weng]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Amn}}"
