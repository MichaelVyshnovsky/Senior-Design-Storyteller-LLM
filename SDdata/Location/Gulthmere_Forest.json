        "mainbody": "The '''Gulthmere Forest''', known for a time as the nation of '''Gulthandor''', marked the boundary between the [[Dragon Coast]] and the [[Vilhon Reach]] in [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]]. It was an overgrown forest of [[pine]] and [[cedar]] that was sacred to the god [[Nobanion]] and his followers. To those within the Reach, it was known as the \"seat of power\" for the lands' [[druid]]s.",
        "Description": "It was an untamed, subtropical expanse of woodland predominantly made up of [[cedar]] and [[pine]] trees. The terrain of the forest was hill country,\n\nThe forest housed several ''[[portal]]''s, including one that was connected to the lost city of [[Ilimar]], the underground city of [[Fluvenilstra]], and another linked to [[Nobanion]]'s [[divine realm]] in the [[House of Nature]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The [[Cedar River]] flowed north through the Gulthmere Forest, dividing the city of [[Cedarspoke]] in two. It was fed by its northern and southern arms, that flowed down from the [[Orbrekh]] and [[Orsraun Mountains]] respectively.\n\nLocated within the forest south of Starmantle was the [[Lightless Lake]], also known as the Moonmere. It was home to a tribe of [[bullywug]]s who believed the lake to be holy to [[Ramenos]].\n\nThe hilly terrain of the forest included at least two dormant volcanoes."
        },
        "Government": "For hundreds of years beginning in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]], the Gulthmere Forest along with the [[Chondalwood]] were watched over a band of druids, led by one the five [[Grand Druid]]s of the Realms. Their order defended the the forest realm from the expansion of neighboring nations, and eventually formed the expansive druidic organization known as the [[Emerald Enclave]].\n\nSome time during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the forest of Gulthmere transformed into the nation of Gulthandor. This forest realm was still governed by the druidic leaders of the region, headquartered in [[Cedarspoke]].{{Cite web/Map of Faerûn 5th edition}}",
        "Society": "The faith of [[Nobanion]] was perhaps the strongest in all of the Gulthmere forest;",
        "History": "The great city of Cedarspoke was founded in the forest around the beginning of the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].\n\nWhen the druids of [[Silvanus]] in the forest united to form the Emerald Enclave in the {{YearlinkName|717}}, in order to strike out against the encroachment of the [[wizard]]s of [[Turmish]] known as the [[Windlass]]. They led precision assaults against the Turmish logging camps and drew them into a great battle at Cedarspoke, from which they emerged victorious.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the forest was the location of a ''[[Roar of Shadows|great battle]]'' between Nobanion and the god [[Malar]]. With the help of his [[druid]] allies, Nobanion kept Malar from entering the Reach, and the Beastlord was forced to turn north.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the [[Fellowship of the Purple Staff]] established themselves within the forest, and by [[1372 DR]], had founded three small hamlets in its northeastern region. Although they were originally resisted by the Nobanionites, who mistook their actions for wanton slaughter of wildlife, the two groups formed a steady alliance. With the help of the Fellowship, the inhabitants of these settlements built roads to trade with nearby [[Amry]] and [[Telpir]] as well the subterranean [[dwarven]] miners. \n\nWhen the [[Fane of Shadows]] came to [[Toril]] on the [[Prime Material plane]], it first appeared in the Lightless Lake within the forest.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Cedarsproke]]: A small city, in the heart of the forest, that served as a [[druid]]ic stronghold. Despite their presence in the area, the city was not a settlement of the [[Emerald Enclave]].\n* [[Gurnth]]: This village, located in the forest's depths, was home to a cult of Nobanion-worshipers.\n* [[Monastery of Oghma]]: A small holy building that was destroyed in the 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Hulther's Mimics}}",
        "Inhabitants": "As was the case with other untamed forested regions of the Realms, Gulthmere was home to a great many [[fey]] creatures. [[Green dragon]]s were known to dwell in the forest, as was at least one rookery of [[kir-lanan]]s."
