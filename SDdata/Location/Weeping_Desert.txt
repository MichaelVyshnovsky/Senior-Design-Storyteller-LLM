The Weeping Desert was located in the Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara.
It was a sandy expanse running from limestone hills at the base of the Furrowed Mountains to massive barchan dunes separating it from the Burning Lands.
By 1367 DR, the Weeping Desert earned its name from the prevalence of undead spirits, such as ghosts, ghost horses, and the undead giants known as rom. A large set of ruins was believed to be the source of the keening sounds that kept travelers awake at night. A large clan of rom was hidden beneath this ruin at the magical underground spring known as the Well of Despair.
