The Fields of the Dead were the rolling hills east of Baldurs Gate between the Winding Water and the River Chionthar on the Sword Coast.
Around the mid–9 century DR, before the founding of Amn, this land was a favored battleground for control of the lands north of Calimshan.
Kings Strohm IV and Samyte of Tethyr were buried here. In 1264 DR, thieves stole the Shield of Silvam and the Royal Masque Blades from the tombs.
Centuries after the fighting, by the mid–14 century DR, bones still littered the field and cairns of the dead were everywhere. Now used for farming and ranching, plows occasionally turned up skeletons in rusting armor, weapons, and other detritus.
