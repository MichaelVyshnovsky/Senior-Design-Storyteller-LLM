'''Hlaunga''' was a secret, [[Zhentarim]]-manufactured [[oasis]] located within the [[Anauroch]] desert. During the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] it served as a way point for [[Zhent]] caravans that traveled across ''Great Grand Sea'' via the [[Black Road]].

==Geography==
Hlaunga was located in the southern stretch of [[the Sword]], just below the southern peaks of the [[Scimitar Spires]] mountain range. 

==Inhabitants==
The Zhentarim kept a contingent of [[mage]]s and the [[Zhentilar]] a garrison of soldiers in Hlaunga, to protect the collective groups' interests from the [[Bedine]].
