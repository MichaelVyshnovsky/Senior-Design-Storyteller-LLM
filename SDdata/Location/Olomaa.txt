Olomaa was an artificially-created oasis utilized by the Zhentarim located in the Anauroch desert.
The oasis was splayed out over two hills and the valley that lay tween them. The Zhents fortification at the oasis was rather bare-bones, consisting of a stone house, a small pasture, and a fountain for water. Their lone amenities came in the form of a handful of bathing pools. 
Olomaa was located in the northwestern stretch of the Sword, some ways southwest of the Dragons Back Peaks. 
The oasis was rich a variety of flora, including frankincense trees and other varieties that produced fruit. 
Olomaa was encircled by trench that held a great number of enormous cacti that offered some natural protection from animals or outsiders. Hidden beneath the trench were a number of man-made traps involved blades that would spring out from beneath the sands when triggered. 
Circa the midâ€“14 century DR, the camp at Olomaa was home to only a few Zhentilar warriors, a single priest of Cyric, and most notably, the beholder Xualahuu.
