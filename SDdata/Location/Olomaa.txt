'''Olomaa''' was an artificially-created oasis utilized by the [[Zhentarim]] located in the [[Anauroch]] desert.

==Description==
The oasis was splayed out over two hills and the valley that lay tween them. The Zhent's fortification at the oasis was rather bare-bones, consisting of a stone house, a small pasture, and a fountain for water. Their lone amenities came in the form of a handful of bathing pools. 

==Geography==
Olomaa was located in the northwestern stretch of [[the Sword]], some ways southwest of the [[Dragon's Back Peaks]]. 

===Geographical Features===
The oasis was rich a variety of flora, including [[frankincense]] trees and other varieties that produced fruit. 

==Defenses==
Olomaa was encircled by trench that held a great number of enormous [[cacti]] that offered some natural protection from animals or outsiders. Hidden beneath the trench were a number of man-made traps involved [[blade]]s that would spring out from beneath the sands when triggered. 

==Inhabitants==
''Circa'' the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the camp at Olomaa was home to only a few [[Zhentilar]] warriors, a single priest of [[Cyric]], and most notably, the [[beholder]] [[Xualahuu]].
