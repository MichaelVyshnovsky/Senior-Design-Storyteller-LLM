'''Mierskar''' was a small farming town in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
It lay just below [[Lushpool]] on the road south to [[Dungar]], and on the [[Lapal Way]] between [[Ithmong (Lapaliiya)|Ithmong]] and [[Sheirlantar]].

==Government & Religion==
Mierskar was a vassal of Lushpool.

The civic deity of Mierskar was [[Deneir]].

==Population==
The town had a population of 1,617 in 1373 DR.

==History==
While the [[Shoon Imperium]] still ruled this land, an imperial satrap had the foresight to establish a collection of all that was known about the [[yuan-ti]] at one place of education. They settled on Mierskar, owing to the notable [[wizard]]'s school that dominated the town. The Great Library of Mierskar, as the collection was known, survived the fall of the empire in the {{YearlinkName|450}}.

In the [[Rage of Wizards]] of the {{YearlinkName|1142}}, the wizards' school was destroyed, but the Great Library remained untouched.

==Notable Locations==
This small town was most notable for the Great Library of Mierskar, one of the greatest along the [[Tashtan Coast]]. Based around the lore of the yuan-ti, it was a boon to research about them and their history on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Entry was forbidden to all actual [[Scaled Ones]], however.
