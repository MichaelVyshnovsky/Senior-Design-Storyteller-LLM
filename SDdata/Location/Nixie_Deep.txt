The Nixie Deep was a small region of the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The Nixie Deep was located offshore from Almorel past the Breakers Rocks in the eastern reaches of the Lake of Mists.
This section of the lake derived its name from the frequent spottings of nixies and other sea creatures.
