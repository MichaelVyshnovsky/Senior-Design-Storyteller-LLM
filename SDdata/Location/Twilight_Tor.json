It lay on the shore of a small mountain lake, [[Lake Glorfindar]].\n\nThe village was made up mainly of worshipers of [[Marthammor Duin]]. It was largely unknown, but the villagers were welcoming of friendly travelers who visited. There were excellent conditions for stargazing .\n\nThe villagers threw a [[Simril]] festival most years, with stargazing at night and various games and celebrations."
