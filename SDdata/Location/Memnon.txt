Memnonnar
Memnon, a key port of trade for Calimshan, was the former capital of the efreeti kingdom of Memnonnar.
Memnon was situated on the northern border of the Calim Desert, at the mouth of the River Agis, and along the Trade Way.
While the official ruler of the city in 1370 DR was Sultan Arin yn Kahar el Sujil, the real power was in the hands of his vizar, Anders el Gnurlbrach. Despite being a half-orc, since at least 1357 DR, Anders was very popular both with the general populace of Memnon and with the syl-pasha of Calimshan. This was in part because he established an elected city council.
Memnon served as the northernmost naval base for the Qysanallojal, Calimshans navy. The ships docked here were the smallest and fastest in the fleet, designed for scouting and anti-piracy purposes. In 1357 DR, the navy was growing so quickly that fishermen were being forced to find new docks.
Memnon was a key trade city for Calimshan. It was that kingdoms northernmost port, and nearly all caravaneers on the Trade Way stopped there for at least a day regardless of whether they were traveling north or south, as Memnon was on the edge of the Calim Desert. The city thus served the function of a massive caravanserai, offering inns, stables, repairs, supplies, or entertainment to those whod just survived the trek across the desert or to those about to make it.
Additionally, Memnon was considered a fishing town, producing both a high quantity and a high quality of fish, shrimp, and shellfish of many varieties..
In the late 1340s DR, Conner and Vaji ran confidence tricks in all the major cities of Calimshan, including Memnon, before they went on to Manshaka.

In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Vajra, Conner, and Salabak sailed back into Memnon on the trail of the mage Chancil Crystalheart. However, his thugs and apprentices waylaid them with a wand of telekinesis, hurling them high into the air. Fortunately their fall was broken by an orange-sellers stall, and they were surrounded by eager-to-help beggars, which Salabak drove off with the illusion of a squealer. They followed Chancils apprentice to his home, where they attempted to rescue the kidnapped cat child.
Conner claimed Memnon to have the best organized beggars guild in Faerûn, with very strict rates. According to hm, theyd charge for any service, even helping someone up if theyd fallen, and just to spit-polish a sword was 10 copper pieces.
