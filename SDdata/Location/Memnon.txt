'''Memnon''', a key port of trade for [[Calimshan]],<ref name=FRCS-p156/> was the former capital of the [[efreet]]i kingdom of [[Memnonnar (country)|Memnonnar]].<ref name=EotSS-p40/>

==Geography==
Memnon was situated on the northern border of the [[Calim Desert]], at the mouth of the [[River Agis]], and along the [[Trade Way]].<ref>

==Government==
While the official ruler of the city in [[1370 DR]] was [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|Sultan]] [[Arin el Sujil|Arin yn Kahar el Sujil]], the real power was in the hands of his [[Alzhedo dictionary#V|vizar]], [[Anders el Gnurlbrach]].<ref name=EotSS-p112/> Despite being a [[half-orc]], since at least [[1357 DR]], Anders was very popular both with the general populace of Memnon and with the [[syl-pasha]] of Calimshan. This was in part because he established an elected city council.<ref name=EotS-pp56-57/>

===Military===
Memnon served as the northernmost naval base for the [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|''Qysanallojal'']], Calimshan's navy. The ships docked here were the smallest and fastest in the fleet, designed for scouting and anti-piracy purposes. In [[1357 DR]], the navy was growing so quickly that fishermen were being forced to find new docks.<ref name=EotS-pp56-57/>

==Trade==
Memnon was a key trade city for Calimshan. It was that kingdom's northernmost port, and nearly all caravaneers on the [[Trade Way]] stopped there for at least a day regardless of whether they were traveling north or south, as Memnon was on the edge of the [[Calim Desert]]. The city thus served the function of a massive [[wikipedia:en:Caravanserai|caravanserai]], offering inns, stables, repairs, supplies, or entertainment to those who'd just survived the trek across the desert or to those about to make it.<ref name=EotS-pp56-57/>

Additionally, Memnon was considered a fishing town, producing both a high quantity and a high quality of fish, shrimp, and shellfish of many varieties.<ref name=EotS-pp56-57/>.

==History==
In the late 1340s [[DR]], [[Conner]] and [[Vajra Valmeyjar|Vaji]] ran confidence tricks in all the major cities of Calimshan, including Memnon, before they went on to [[Manshaka]].{{Cite comic/The Last Betrayal|25}}

[[File:Memnon - comic.jpg|thumb|left|''A view of the city of Memnon, circa 1357 DR.'']]
In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Vajra, Conner, and [[Salabak]] sailed back into Memnon on the trail of the mage [[Chancil Crystalheart]]. However, his thugs and apprentices waylaid them with a ''[[wand]] of [[telekinesis]]'', hurling them high into the air. Fortunately their fall was broken by an orange-seller's stall, and they were surrounded by eager-to-help beggars, which Salabak drove off with the illusion of a [[squealer]]. They followed Chancil's apprentice to his home, where they attempted to rescue the kidnapped [[cat child]].{{Cite comic/Shell Game}}

==Society==
Conner claimed Memnon to have the best organized beggar's guild in [[Faerûn]], with very strict rates. According to hm, they'd charge for any service, even helping someone up if they'd fallen, and just to spit-polish a sword was 10 [[copper pieces]].{{Cite comic/Shell Game|5-6}}
