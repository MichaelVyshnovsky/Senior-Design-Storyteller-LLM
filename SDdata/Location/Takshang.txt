Takshang was a small hermitage located at the foot of Ghalyi Shan in the Hordelands.
The hermitage was located halfway up a cliff, tucked away in a cleft in the great mountain. No stairs or ladders led to Takshang. Ropes were typically used to move supplies or assist visitors in ascending the steep approach.
A single, three-room building comprised the entire hermitage.
The only permanent resident of Takshang was Gyawa Zangpo, an oni serving out his imprisonment on Toril.
