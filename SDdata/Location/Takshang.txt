'''Takshang''' was a small hermitage located at the foot of [[Ghalyi Shan]] in the [[Hordelands]].

==Description==
The hermitage was located halfway up a cliff, tucked away in a cleft in the great mountain. No stairs or ladders led to Takshang. [[Rope]]s were typically used to move supplies or assist visitors in ascending the steep approach.

A single, three-room building comprised the entire hermitage.

==Inhabitants==
The only permanent resident of Takshang was [[Gyawa Zangpo]], an [[Me-zu oni|oni]] serving out his imprisonment on [[Toril]].
