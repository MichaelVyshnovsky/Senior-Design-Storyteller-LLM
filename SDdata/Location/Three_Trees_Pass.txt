'''Three Trees Pass''' was a major pass between the [[Troll Mountains (the Vast)|Troll Mountains]] and the [[Giantspike Mountains]] in [[the Vast]]. The [[North Road]] ran through it to connect [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]] and [[King's Reach]].

==Description==
The pass was a long cleft between the two mountain ranges. It was rocky, dangerous, and desolate.

==History==
Three Trees Pass was named, obviously, for three great old [[pine]]s that were all that lived in the bleak landscape, and which marked the height of the pass. The name arose in conversation between two [[Sembia]]n merchants who'd explored the [[dwarf|dwarven]]-held lands of Vast (during the time of [[Roldilar]], [[610 DR|610]]–[[649 DR]]), as they sought a trade-route from the dwarven mines down to the [[River Vesper]].

To that end, the North Road was laid through Three Trees Pass, linking Kurth and King's Reach. [[Human]]s waged costly battles against the [[orc]]s of the mountains to control the pass, but were ultimately successful. The effort saved the last of the dwarves of Roldilar from being wiped out by the orcs at the fall of that kingdom.

Conflicts continued to be fought through the pass as human prospectors moved into the surrounding mountains and clashed with the orcs.

==Usage==
During summer in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], traders from King's Reach and Kurth headed to the summit of the pass, where they made armed camps and sold supplies to miners working the nearby mountains. These included mining equipment, [[mule]]s, food, and [[trap]]ped [[chest]]s. They also bought ores and nuggets. Once a month, prior to the goddess's disappearance in [[1358 DR]], a [[priest]] of [[Waukeen]] passed through to dispense healing for exorbitant prices.

Due to the frequent orc attacks, no one lived in Three Trees Pass, nor built permanent structures.

==Rumors & Legends==
Supposedly, caches of thousands of [[gold]] nuggets, bags of gold gravel, and [[gem]]s were stashed all over the pass, suggesting it was one of the richest locales in [[Faerûn]]. However, anyone trying to find or dig up any of it would up be watched by human guards, dwarf miners, and orc raiders, and risked being attacked as soon as they found anything of worth.
