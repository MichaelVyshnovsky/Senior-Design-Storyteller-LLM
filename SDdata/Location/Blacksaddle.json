        "Geography": "Blacksaddle was a kingdom filled with small hills and roughly triangular in shape, with the towns of [[Bloutar]], [[Syrnt]] and [[Telcharn]] marking each corner of the triangular border. the southern border was marked by the [[Shaarwall]], a strip of hills separating the Border Kingdoms and the Shaar.

        "Trade": "The main sources of revenue for the Barony was farming, stonecutting and crafted items. The barony was covered in small farms, providing enough agricultural product for domestic use as well as a trade good to be exported. Blue and red marble was quarried in the Shaarwall. Gems were often found in these quarries and were used by artisans to craft or decorate a range of items.",
        "Defenses": "Raids and skirmishes are commonplace due to the location and prosperity of the barony along the northern edge of the Shaar. Stone watchtowers were constructed across the barony and the citizens are always armed while travelling. The Swords, heavily armed cavalry numbering just under 400 members, was the army of the kingdom. \n{{fq\n| text   = And now the swordsmen raise their steel<br/>And now they bring their blades down<br/>Brigands scream and chargers reel<br/>As a nomad crown comes crashing down\n| source = ''The Ballad of Blacksaddle'' by Laetha the Wanderer\n| float  = right\n| width  = 300px\n}}\nThe barony has gained a far-reaching reputation for both their military skill and constant skirmishes.
