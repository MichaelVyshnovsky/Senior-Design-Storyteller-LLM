'''Lopango''', also known as the '''Land of Fire''', was a land on the southern end of [[Maztica]]. It was covered in forest or jungle and high mountains. Some maps depicted archers with [[longbow]]s there.<ref>

==Locations==
Known places in Lopango included [[Pichu Umu]], [[Apu Roca]], and [[Mt. Cuzcalac]].

==Trade==
The lands of Lopango were known for exporting [[chocolate]] [[wafer]]s, found as far as the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Lopango was once part of [[Merrouroboros]], the ancient super-continent that eventually broke up into [[Faer√ªn]], [[Kara-Tur]], Maztica, and [[Zakhara]]. Lopango was known for its active volcanoes at this time. During the height of the [[Batrachi Empires]], ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-31500}} in the [[Days of Thunder]], the [[batrachi]] lord [[Bazim-Gorag]] claimed that his domain stretched "to the fiery peaks of Lopango in the south".

In the {{YearlinkName|370}}, the [[Shoon Imperium]]'s [[Great Colony Fleet]] set out from [[Calimshan]] to colonize the [[Moonshae Isles]] with 600 ships. After a great storm fell upon them and blew them off course, the surviving twenty ships were stranded on the shores of Lopango.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}
