'''Needle's Bones''' was a massive grotto, resembling a sinkhole, located in the jungles of [[Chult]].

==Description==
The walls of the cavity were sheer rock, covered in vines and moss. The bottom was covered by a shallow pool of murky green water that was full of skeletal remains.

==History==
Originally, this landmark served as the lair of the [[green dragon]] [[Ormalagos]].

At some point the nearby [[batiri]] [[goblin]]s concocted a plan to slay the dragon commonly known as Needle. They trapped her with nets and pelted her with [[spear]]s while schools of carnivorous [[quipper]]s consumed her from below. Ormalagos was slain and the tribe of goblins were nearly completely eradicated.
