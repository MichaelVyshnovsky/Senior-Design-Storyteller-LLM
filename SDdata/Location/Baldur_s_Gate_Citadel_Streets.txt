Citadel Streets was a small, and rather segregated, district located on the north side of the Upper City of Baldurs Gate.
The predominant feature of this district was the grand Watch Citadel, the fortress that served as a barracks and training grounds for the Upper City police force known as the Watch. The citadel itself was partitioned by a city wall that extended in from northern border of the city proper, with traffic being directed through the Citadel Gate.
A couple of patriar families kept their manses within this district, most notably the Provoss and the Whitburns.
