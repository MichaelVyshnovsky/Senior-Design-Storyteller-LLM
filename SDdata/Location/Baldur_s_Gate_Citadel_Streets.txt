'''Citadel Streets''' was a small, and rather segregated, district located on the north side of the [[Upper City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Notable Locations==
The predominant feature of this district was the grand [[Watch Citadel]], the fortress that served as a barracks and training grounds for the Upper City police force known as [[the Watch]]. The citadel itself was partitioned by a city wall that extended in from northern border of the city proper, with traffic being directed through the [[Citadel Gate]].

A couple of [[patriar]] families kept their manses within this district, most notably the [[Provoss]] and the [[Whitburn]]s.
