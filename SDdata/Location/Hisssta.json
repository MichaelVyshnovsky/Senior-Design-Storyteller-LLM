Like all land masses within the atmosphere of Coliar, Hisssta was a floating island, one of many thousands.\nThe port contained several structures. A stream flowed through the town and poured off the edge to fall to unfathomable depths.\nThe lizardfolk of Coliar maintained primitive communistic governments. On Hisssta, that governments business was centralized at the Hall of the People.\nthumb|right|A lizardfolk within Hissstas government warehouse.\nHisssta charged a moorage fee of 90 gold pieces and an air tax of 40 gold pieces. This was an exorbitant tax compared to the average 5-gold-piece air tax imposed at other lizarfolk ports within the planet. An additional cargo tax was also charged, which was based on the amount of cargo being carried by mooring spelljammers.\nThe communal government maintained a publicly owned warehouse where off-world trade deals were arranged and goods were purchased, sold, and stored.\nthumb|right|A lizardfolk preacher in the temple of Semuanya on Hisssta.\nThe islanders of Hisssta were known to revere the god Semuanya, and the port contained at least one temple dedicated to him.\n* Athlass Armory\n* Jamm Services\n* Siths General Store\n* Sslishs Tavern"
