        "mainbody": "'''Anga Vled''' was a village of [[gnomes]] in the [[Fields of the Dead]] of the [[Western Heartlands]], ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Geography": "This farming community was located on the north bank of the [[River Chionthar]], west of [[Elturel]]. It took about a day to reach the village on horseback from Elturel.\n\nAnga Vled was among the gnome settlements linked through the [[magic]]al transportation network known as the [[Trail of Mists]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}",
        "Trade": "Anga Vled was on a caravan route and traded mainly in food. Produce from this village included [[asparagus]], [[carrot]]s, [[Zucchini|marrows]], parsnips, and radishes. They also made a bread with spiced vegetables, and a very strong parsnip wine. Around 1370 DR, there were two gnomes skilled at training, [[horseshoe|shoeing]], and healing horses. Occasionally, they had horses to trade or sell, typically when a merchant or traveler had to move on, leaving behind a sick or injured [[mount]] in their care. There was also a wheelwright, by name and by trade.",
        "Defenses": "All around the land side of the city were small ring-shaped forts made of earth where folks could quickly set up a defense against the various hazards of life on the plains. [[Goblins]], [[hobgoblins]], [[bugbears]], and even [[trolls]] were known to roam and plunder the area, not to mention the [[human]] bandit gangs that prowled the plains.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the early 1370s DR, [[Gudelmer Wheelwright]] was the most well-known member of this community. His skill at making and repairing wagons garnered him quite a reputation among those who passed through Anga Vled on a regular basis."
