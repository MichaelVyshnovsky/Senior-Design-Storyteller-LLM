'''Lith''' was a small island in the [[Pirate Isles]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. 

==Geography==
The island of Lith sat between [[Hawk's Isle]] in the west and [[Lurath]] in the east.

==Description==
There were no natural harbors on the island.

==Inhabitants==
Lith was never settled by the pirates of the isles. A brood of ravenous [[neogi]] dominated the island. Though Lith lacked [[umber hulk]]s for the neogi to enslave, their powers appeared to work on the natural animals of the island which were used as the neogi desired.

==History==
Lith was directly involved in the poetic naming of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Hundreds of years ago sages witnessed stars falling from the sky above the Pirate Isles. Research teams were sent to investigate and discover the landing spot, but none returned. The falling star was actually a crashing [[Neogi deathspider|neogi broodship]] that was badly damaged in a struggle with a [[Shou]] [[dragonship]]. The neogi crashed on Lith and quickly made the island a new lair.
