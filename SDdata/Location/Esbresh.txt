'''Esbresh''' was a settlement near the [[Utter East]] and [[Ulgarth]] in [[southeast Faerûn]], lying on the shore of the [[Great Sea]].

There was a certain slaving ring based out of [[Luskan]] in far [[northwest Faerûn]], fronted by one [[Inther Blackfeather]], that reached all the way to Esbresh and [[Kelazzan]].<ref><ref>
