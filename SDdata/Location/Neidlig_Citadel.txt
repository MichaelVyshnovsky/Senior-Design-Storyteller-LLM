Neidlig Citadel was an ancient ruined fortress that served as the home of the Neidlig goblin tribe.
The fortress was a remnant of ancient goblin architecture, and by the 14 century DR had mostly fallen into ruin. The outer walls had largely collapsed, but some of the towers and the main keep remained intact. Most of the tribe lived in the keeps dungeons and in a series of tunnels and caverns beneath it.
Unlike most goblin lairs it was not hidden at all, as the Neidlig were fully confident in their martial strength compared to any of their enemies.
The Citadel lay in the Goblin Marches just north of the High Moors and west of the Stonelands.
The Neidlig were ruled by King Srubaash, and the goblins were joined by various hobgoblin, orc, and ogre allies.
