'''Deepingdale''' was one of the more peaceful, albeit strong, dales within the [[Dalelands]], with a strong connection and loyalty to the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthor]]. There were few other places in [[Faerûn]] where men and elves enjoyed such rich unity and friendship. Its capital city was the large town of [[Highmoon]] that rested in the high-traffic road of the [[East Way]].

==Government==
The government of Deepingdale was led by an appointed lordship, where a deserving and dedicated citizen was appointed by the town council as [[Lord of Highmoon]]. The Lord was responsible for declaring decrees which defined the current laws of the Dale. The council was composed of appointed, trusted citizens of Highmoon and the surrounding countryside.

===Law & Order===
Similar to the legal system in [[Battledale]], the Dalesfolk of Deepingdale regularly policed themselves in regards to minor crimes and disagreements. More serious issues and crimes were brought to the Lord of Highmoon. Most of the laws created by the lord were considered forgiving and just; crimes such as murder or arson were punished severely and matters involving armed combatants were considered military enemies of the Dale.

There was a minor law regarding fishing, where anyone who were to fish for more than a single [[salmon]] for their meal, from either the [[Glaemril]] or [[Wineflow]] rivers would be considered a [[bandit]].

===Defenses===
The armed forces of Deepingdale consisted of a standing military comprising two companies of elven archers, a [[Tower Guard (Deepingdale)|Tower Guard]] of human and [[half-elf]] forces and a militia of able-bodied Dalesfolk known as the [[Swords of Deepingdale]].

==Society==
Most of the Deepingdalesmen enjoyed lives as farmers, woodsman and hunters. Their relationship with the [[Elven Court]] ranged from cordial to prideful in their friendship and unity.

==Economy==
Although it was not as large a trading power as [[Archendale]], or the other trading dales, Deepingdale did import many daily-use finished goods such as cookware, [[lantern]]s, linens and textiles through Highmoon. Conversely it was the largest supplier of game, furs and timber for the Dales. 

Highmoon was a local trading hub in the area, a favored city for travelers to buy Daleland goods. It was the home to trading costers such as [[Silverhand House]], [[Andelmaus Logging]] and [[Hanseld's Emporium]] in late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Deepingdale was founded by a [[Half-elf]] [[sorceress]] named [[Imryll Eluarshee]], also known as the ''Deeping Princess''. They had a vision of a community where elves, half-elves and humans could live together in the lore of culture found in Cormanthor.

Since the majority of the elves began migrating to [[Evereska]] in the great [[Retreat]], Deepingdale has become the ''de facto'' home to those that remained in the forests of the Dalelands. These elves and the Dalesmen have united even further in their war against the [[Drow]] raiders from ancestral Cormanthor who worshiped the deity [[Vhaeraun]].

==Geographical Features==
This dale encompassed a deep valley between the [[Arch Wood]] and [[Semberholme]] forests, along the [[Glaemril]]. It was bordered on the east by the [[Glaun Bog]] and the beginning of the [[Dun Hills]]. The valley began in the west at Highmoon, which sat on the East Way. The elvish villages of [[Bristar]] and [[Moonrise Hill]] were also part of the Dale.

===Mountains===
* [[The Blood Horn]]: This mountain stood atop the ruins of former [[Sessrendale]] and was home to a [[red dragon]] known as [[Thraxata]].

===Rifts===
* [[Darkwatch]]: This thicket of dark [[oak]]s and gnarled thorn trees surrounded a long scar in the ground, filled with darkness. It was rumored to be home to an ancient evil imprisoned by the Elves.

===Bodies of Water===
* The [[Glaemril]]: A swift and strong river was rich in salmon.
* [[Wineflow]]: This river was just as abundant in fish as the Glaemril.
* [[Hallow Creek]]
* [[Lake Eredruie]]: Regarded as sacred to the followers of [[Labelas Enoreth]], this lake was actually an over-sized pond whose water had magical healing properties.

== Notable Locations ==
===Temples===
; [[Leaves of Learning]]: The temple of [[Oghma]] featured one of the largest libraries in [[Faerûn]] outside of [[Candlekeep]].
; [[Rhauntides Tower]]: This small tower on top of [[Spell Hill]] was home to the former Sage of Deepingdale, [[Rhauntides]].
; [[Tower of the Rising Moon]]: The black-walled stronghold in Highmoon served as home to the Lord of Deepingdale.

===Settlements===
; [[Highmoon]]: Deepingdale's capital was also the dale's only major settlement. It acted as a hub of trade in the area, nestled around the East Way between [[Arabel]] and Ordulin.
; [[Bristar]]: This village of [[moon elves]] maintained its allegiance to Deepingdale following the Retreat. As of [[1372 DR]] it was the largest remaining communities of Elves in Cormanthor.
; [[Moonrise Hill]]: Another Elven village located northeast of [[Lake Eredruie]]; they contributed numbers to the Swords of Deepingdale.
