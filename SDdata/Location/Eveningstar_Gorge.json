        "Geography": "[[File:Forgotten Keep.png|thumb|right|250px|''A map showing the location of Eveningstar Gorge.'']]\nEveningstar Gorge was located north of the town of [[Eveningstar]], where the [[Starwater River]] broke through the [[Stonecliff]]. This allowed one of the only routes up to the dangerous [[Stonelands]],",
        "Flora & Fauna": "The base of the gorge was covered with scrub trees and thickets, some of which produced berries. Brave children from the town played there often.\n\n[[Tressym]], the famed winged cats, were thought to have originated in the Eveningstar region, and most of the population lived and hunted in the gorge, keeping rodent numbers low.\n\nIn the winter, [[wolves]] would migrate down from the Stonelands to the gorge to hunt, giving rise to the term \"wolf winters\" for particularly harsh winters in the region.",
        "Notable Locations": "* The Haunted Halls, a [[dwarven]] keep built into the western cliff face of the gorge.\n* [[Old Meg's Hut]], an old ruin that once was home to a [[hag]].\n* [[Rivior's Keep]], the original home of the bandit lord [[Rivior]], for whom the Haunted Halls were built.\n* [[Redhand Pool]], a small lake on the Starwater River.\n* Starwater River, the river that formed the gorge.\n* [[Thaddath farm]], a ruined farm later used as a dump."
