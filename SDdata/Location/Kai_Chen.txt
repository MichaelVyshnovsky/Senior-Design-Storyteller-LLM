Kai Chen was a former province somewhere in Kara-Tur.
Some time before the midâ€“14 century DR, in the stadium of old Kai Chen province, up-and-coming warriors could challenge veteran samurai to ritual battles as a test of their prowess. If successful, they won lasting fame and accolades, and were gifted with the Kaga-To katana as a symbol of this.
