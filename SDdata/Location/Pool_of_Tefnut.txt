The '''Pool of Tefnut''' was an oasis that would appear and disappear in [[Raurin]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|25}} It was named for the goddess [[Tefnut]], one of the members of the [[Pharaonic pantheon]] who was forced to stay behind instead of traveling to [[Realmspace]] to become part of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Overview==
The pool of Tefnut would remain in its location until a good-aligned person looked into its waters. They would see two almond-shaped eyes, which would volunteer to answer their questions. Once they had asked three questions, the oasis would vanish. All travelers who had witnessed the oasis would find their water reserves refilled, and their thirst quenched.
