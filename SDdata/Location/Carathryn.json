        "History": "Carathryn was a flourishing town and dominated by the Ilmatari faith.\n\nOne morning in the [[848 DR|Year of the Vigilant Familiar, 848 DR]], the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'' appeared on the altar of Ilmater. The Ilmatari told the story that Ilmater himself had placed it there. High Priest [[Ilnger Obskoth]] proclaimed it as \"the hand of holy Ilmater made manifest among us\", and it swiftly became the most venerated sacred object in Carathryn.\n\nIn the [[1123 DR|Year of the Shattered Chains, 1123 DR]], the Teeth of [[Talos]] storms lashed the southern [[Sword Coast]]. The storms completely sunk the Dragonstail peninsula, taking Carathryn with it. In later years, both the Dragonstail and Carathryn were a hazard to mariners along the coast, by ripping open the hulls of passing ships.",
