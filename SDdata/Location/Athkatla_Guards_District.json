        "mainbody": "The '''Guards District''' of [[Athkatla]] was a district on the east end of the city, that served as the home for many of the ''city of coin's'' guards and mercenaries, as well as a haven for its adventurers. \n\nMost Athkatlans did not have a favorable view of adventurers, and didn't consider it a genuine trade. As such, those who lived the adventuring lifestyle were not welcome in most parts of the city, unless they were to spend an extravagant amount of coin. In this regard, the ''guards district'' became the home of the Athkatlan adventurer.\n\nThe guards district was located on the southern bank of the [[Alandor River]], just east of the [[Bridge District (Athkatla)|bridge]]. Leading out the city further was the ''Heroes' Gate''.",
        "Notable locations": "*[[Den of the Seven Vales]]: This combination inn/festhall was considered quite clean and very popular\n\n*[[Five Flagons|Five Flagons tavern]]: A well-liked tavern that was established some time around [[1370 DR]]"
