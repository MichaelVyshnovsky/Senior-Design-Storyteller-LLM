'''Forharn''' was an underground city of [[gnome]]s found within the [[White Peaks]] mountain range of the [[Moonsea North]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|62}}

==Geography==
The city was hidden within the deepest depths beneath [[Kossuth's Ire]], a volcano found among the eastern peaks of the mountains.

It was one of the many settlements of gnomes linked by the [[magic]]al transportation network known as the [[Trail of Mists]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}
==Government==
Forharn was governed by the [[Hammers of Flandal]], a council that comprised city elders and experienced craftspeople.

The city's sigil was an upturned hammer set over a mountain.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|79}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Kossuth's Ire erupted after a long period of dormancy. While the gnomes of Forharn were fortunate that their home was not damaged during the eruption, passages to their underground home were cut off by magma flows for a time.

==Inhabitants==
In addition to its gnomish residents, Forharn was home to two [[dragon]]s that were raised and cared for by the city's clergy, an adult red dragon named [[Rauklarnemis]] and an elder blue dragon named [[Trakaulorr]].
