        "mainbody": "'''Goldenfields''', nicknamed the '''Granary of the North''', was a walled abbey to [[Chauntea]] of spectacular scope and size. It was the most prolific provider of crops, grains and fruits to the people of [[the North]].\n\nThe walled temple-complex featured a small town of several dozen longhouses, an abbey, an inn,",
        "Geography": "The walls and farms of Goldenfields were built on raised land within the [[Dessarin Valley]]  that covered over {{SI|30|mi²|k|long=yes}}.\n\nIt was located south of [[Bargewright Inn]], on the western side of the [[River Dessarin]], at the end of the [[Northfurrow Trail]].",
        "Government": "The complex was originally run by its founder, the [[Chauntea]]n [[cleric]], [[Tolgar Anuvien]].\n\nSometime during the 14{{th}} or 15{{th}} centuries DR, Goldenfields came under the influence and sway of the [[Emerald Enclave]]. Its members were just as welcome within as faithful Chauntean [[church of Chauntea|clergy]].",
        "Trade": "The vast farms of Goldenfields grew a number of grains including [[rice]], [[corn]], [[barley]] and hops. It had [[apple]] and [[orange]] orchards along with a number of [[herb]] and vegetable gardens. The latter of these cultivated a number of root vegetables including [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, [[potato]]es and others such as [[tomato]]es and squash.\n\nIt featured a number of livestock paddocks where oxen and cattle were allowed to graze. Smaller pens housed [[sheep]], pigs, turkey and chickens.\n\nGoldenfields provided much of the food consumed in [[Waterdeep]] and the neighboring settlements, but did not seek payment in return. They donated this food to others in honor of Chauntea.",
        "Defenses": "The lands around Goldenfields were well patrolled by well-armed Chauntean priests.\n\nThe complex was encircled by a massive wall constructed from mortared stone. It was {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} tall from the outside, {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} tall from the elevated inside, and {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} wide nearly all around. Stone towers and barracks were constructed on the walls, about {{SIrange|1|2|mi|k|long=yes}} apart from one another.",
        "History": "The complex was founded shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, by Tolgar Anuvien, one of the [[Company of Crazed Venturers|Crazed Venturers]] who hailed from nearby Waterdeep. In the following decade it grew to be the largest \"temple\" dedicated to Chauntea.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Goldenfields had grown from {{SI|20|mi²|k|long=yes}}[[Volo's Guide to the North]] and the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]] show linear growth in the size of Goldenfields, from 20 to 30 square miles. [[Storm King's Thunder]] states the farmlands take up \"more than\" 20 square miles, which is technically true. \n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Goldenfields was assaulted by a band of [[Guh]], her tribe of [[hill giant]]s and their allied [[goblinoid]] forces.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Earth Mother's Bounty]]: This shop sold seeds and ornamental cornucopias to Goldenfields' visitors.\n* [[Goldengulp Brewery]]: Some 60 people worked in the brewery, brewing its [[Goldengulp|namesake beer]].\n* [[Harvesthome Abbey]]: The holy house of Chauntea was the largest and most-decorated structure within the complex.\n* [[Northfurrow's End]]: This three-story inn offered delectable food and spacious accommodations.",

            "Notable Residents": {
                "14{{th}} Century": "* Tolgar Anuvien, the abbey's founder.\n* [[Nindil Jalbuck]], one of the [[Masked Lord]]s of [[Waterdeep]].",

        "Rumors and Legends": "Local rumors stated that Chauntea herself was quite proud of Goldenfields and had a personal hand in its growth and defense.<ref group=\"note\">Page 45 of [[Volo's Guide to the North]] erroneously refers Chauntea as \"he\"."
