        "mainbody": "oldenfields, nicknamed the Granary of the North, was a walled abbey to Chauntea of spectacular scope and size. It was the most prolific provider of crops, grains and fruits to the people of the North.\nThe walled temple-complex featured a small town of several dozen longhouses, an abbey, an inn,\nThe walls and farms of Goldenfields were built on raised land within the Dessarin Valley  that covered over .\nIt was located south of Bargewright Inn, on the western side of the River Dessarin, at the end of the Northfurrow Trail.\nThe complex was originally run by its founder, the Chauntean cleric, Tolgar Anuvien.\nSometime during the 14 or 15 centuries DR, Goldenfields came under the influence and sway of the Emerald Enclave. Its members were just as welcome within as faithful Chauntean clergy.\nThe vast farms of Goldenfields grew a number of grains including rice, corn, barley and hops. It had apple and orange orchards along with a number of herb and vegetable gardens. The latter of these cultivated a number of root vegetables including carrots, onions, potatoes and others such as tomatoes and squash.\nIt featured a number of livestock paddocks where oxen and cattle were allowed to graze. Smaller pens housed sheep, pigs, turkey and chickens.\nGoldenfields provided much of the food consumed in Waterdeep and the neighboring settlements, but did not seek payment in return. They donated this food to others in honor of Chauntea.\nThe lands around Goldenfields were well patrolled by well-armed Chauntean priests.\nThe complex was encircled by a massive wall constructed from mortared stone. It was  tall from the outside,  tall from the elevated inside, and  wide nearly all around. Stone towers and barracks were constructed on the walls, about  apart from one another.\nThe settlement was founded as an abbey around the  by Tolgar Anuvien.The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition places the foundation circa 1359 DR, whereas Volos Guide to the North places it circa 1355 DR. Given the events which happened there during the Time of Troubles, the latter is more likely correct. In a few years time Goldenfields grew into a massive fortified farmland.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, Myrkul and a host of skeletal servants appeared in Goldenfields. They were driven out of the city walls by the Tolgar Anuvien and Malchor Harpell, a battle during which the High Priest almost lost his life.\nAround 1395 DR, a disease called the Putrescent Anathema spread from Stump Bog to Goldenfields. It hit the plentiful farmlands very hard, and thousands died due to the lack of grain to feed themselves. \n* Earth Mothers Bounty This shop sold seeds and ornamental cornucopias to Goldenfields visitors.\n* Goldengulp Brewery Some 60 people worked in the brewery, brewing its namesake beer.\n* Harvesthome Abbey The holy house of Chauntea was the largest and most-decorated structure within the complex.\n* Northfurrows End This three-story inn offered delectable food and spacious accommodations.\nThe temple-complex was home to over 5,000 individuals. It was tended to by Chauntean clergy and protected by vigilant guardsmen, hired adventurers and treants of the Emerald Enclave.\n14 Century\n* Tolgar Anuvien, the abbeys founder.\n* Nindil Jalbuck, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. \n15 Century\n* Ellardin Darovik, the magnanimous abbot of Goldenfields.\n* Lifferlas, an awakened tree that dwelled within the orchards.\n* Miros Xelbrin, innkeep of Northfurrows End.\n* Zi Liang, one of the abbeys acolytes.\nLocal rumors stated that Chauntea herself was quite proud of Goldenfields and had a personal hand in its growth and defense.Page 45 of Volos Guide to the North erroneously refers Chauntea as \"he\".\nThe complex was founded shortly before the , by Tolgar Anuvien, one of the Crazed Venturers who hailed from nearby Waterdeep. In the following decade it grew to be the largest \"temple\" dedicated to Chauntea.\nBy the , Goldenfields had grown from Volos Guide to the North and the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition show linear growth in the size of Goldenfields, from 20 to 30 square miles. Storm Kings Thunder states the farmlands take up \"more than\" 20 square miles, which is technically true. \nIn the late 15 century DR, some time after the War of the Silver Marches, Goldenfields was assaulted by a band of Guh, her tribe of hill giants and their allied goblinoid forces."
