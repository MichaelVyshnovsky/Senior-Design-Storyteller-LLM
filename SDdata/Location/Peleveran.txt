Peleveran was a city built into the side of the Landrise, just north of the River Shaar. There was a hidden temple deep in the ruins that was rumored to house a portal to the Nine Hells.
In 1018 DR, Peleveran was destroyed in a battle between two factions of the Cult of the Dragon, one of which had fallen to the worship of Gargauth.
