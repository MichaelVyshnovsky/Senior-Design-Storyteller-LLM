'''Peleveran''' was a city built into the side of the [[Landrise]], just north of the [[River Shaar]]. There was a hidden temple deep in the ruins that was rumored to house a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Nine Hells]].

==History==
In [[1018 DR]], Peleveran was destroyed in a battle between two factions of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], one of which had fallen to the worship of [[Gargauth]].
