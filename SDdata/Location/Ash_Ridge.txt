The '''Ash Ridge''' was a mountainous area of the [[Sword Mountains]] , along the [[Thunderhoof Pass]].

==Geography==
Ash Ridge stood to the northeast from [[Gnomengarde]], long the mountain pass towards the [[Old Owl Well]] valley.

==History==
Before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Thunderhoof Pass was an important trade way that led to the Old Owl Well. Following the disastrous [[Spellplague]] that ravaged the face of [[Toril]], the Thunderhoof Pass, the Ash Ridge, and the Old Owl Well were taken over by the [[orc]]s of the [[Many-Arrows Kingdom]]. Powers of the [[Lords' Alliance]] showed little interest in the mountain pass as the trade withered away. Despite having little strategic value, Lord [[Neverember]] used [[adventurer]]s to claim the Thunderhoof Pass for [[Neverwinter]], with a promise of grand rewards.
