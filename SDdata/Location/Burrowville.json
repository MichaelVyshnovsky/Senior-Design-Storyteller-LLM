        "Description": "Burrowville stood on the hills between craggy Ridge to the south and the [[Snakewood]] to the north. A small baron trail crossed the Ridge and eventually led to a road connected to the town's southern neighbor – [[Keczulla]]. Despite being the shortest ride, the trail was rarely used by merchants and travelers who used a much longer road that looped around the Ridge; instead, traveling the long way around to Keczulla took over 25 days. The shorter way was a dangerous option as it passed a wild territory of [[troll]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[leprechaun]]s, [[wolves]], and [[cyclops]]es.{{Cite polyhedron/64/Short People|11}}",
        "Government": "Burrowville was governed by the town council{{Cite polyhedron/64/Short People|9}} Years after the Zhentarim incident, councilman [[Malakii Farseer]] was elected mayor after years of civil service.",
        "Trade": "The town's main export was the rarest type of [[tobacco]] grown exclusively in the fields outside of town.\n\nThe tobacco fields were mortgaged by Burrowville in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, due to the town's financial strains due to poor harvest. The annual payments depended on the crops at 12,000 [[danter]]s per year.\n\nApart from vacationing and tobacco trade, the hin community kept [[mule]]s and [[ponies]] and grew [[gooseberries]].",
        "History": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, a famous stout folk adventuring company, the [[Short People]], used Burrowville as their vacationing spot. During that time, a plot by the dreaded [[Zhentarim]] became known to one of the city councilmen – Malakii Farseer. In attempts to establish a foothold in Amn, the Zhentarim purchased Burrowville's mortgage. If Burrowville could not pay the year's mortgage of 12,000 danters on time, the Black Network would claim the town's ownership in foreclosure. This was likely to happen as Burrowville suffered three years of poor harvest due to weather. To make things direr, the Zhentarim bullied local merchants into offering a ridiculously low price for Burrowville's harvest.\n\nMalakii Farseer enrolled the aid of the famed Short People in escorting crop wagons to the markets of Keczulla, where Burrowville would be able to offer a fair price for the luxurious tobacco. Halfling named [[Theodore Thistledown|Theodore \"Badger\" Thistledown]] was put in charge of the shipment.{{Cite polyhedron/64/Short People|12-13}}\n\nIn reward, the adventurers were given [[gold]] from the transaction, permission to construct a shrine to [[Moradin]], a set of [[silk]] finery, two of the Short People – [[Ally Thistledown]] and [[Verna Burrtoes]], received positions on the town council, while \"Badger\" Thistledown received a profitable teamster contract.{{Cite polyhedron/64/Short People|14}}",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Elenor Thistledown]], the overprotective hin mother of \"Badger\" and Ally Thistledown in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR."
