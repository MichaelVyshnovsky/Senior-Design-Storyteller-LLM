        "mainbody": "The '''Hollow Mountain''', later called '''Mount Grimmerfang''', was a mountain in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]]. It was the capital of both the [[orc]] kingdom of [[Vastar]] and the [[dwarf]] kingdom of [[Roldilar]].",
        "History": "The mountain was originally known as the \"Hollow Mountain\".\n\nAt some point, the monstrous orc [[Ologh]] rose to the position of [[Overking]] of Vastar, and created a throne for himself, holding court from the Hollow Mountain. When Ologh the Overking was killed by the [[black dragon]] [[Iyrauroth]] in the [[572 DR|Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]], the throne was left vacant and Vastar descended into civil war.\n\nEventually, [[Grimmerfang]] defeated his last rival and seized the throne in the [[580 DR|Year of the Loose Coins, 580 DR]]. Orc-King Grimmerfang renamed the Hollow Mountain after himself, to Mount Grimmerfang.\n\nHowever, dwarves invaded and Vastar fell in the [[610 DR|Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR]]. The dwarves took Mount Grimmerfang from the orcs and slew Grimmerfang himself at the mountain. He was left entombed there.\n\nThe same year, the dwarves founded the kingdom of Roldilar, under [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]]. Tuir placed his throne deep beneath Mount Grimmerfang and held court from there. It was here in the [[645 DR|Year of the Costly Gift, 645 DR]], that [[Maskyr One-Eye]] bought the vale of [[Maskyr's Eye]] from King Tuir.\n\nResurgent orcs engulfed Roldilar in the [[649 DR|Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]] \n\nKnowledge of the location of Mount Grimmerfang eventually became lost. Those few dwarven elders still alive by [[1370 DR]] who could still identify Mount Grimmerfang refused to tell [[human]]s or [[elves]] about it.\n\nIyrauroth returned to Mount Grimmerfang sometime between [[1369 DR]] and [[1373 DR]] and laired there.",
        "Location": "By 1370 DR, the [[sage]] [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]] estimated Mount Grimmerfang to be the first peak north-east of [[Mount Wolf]], placing it in the [[Giantspike Mountains|Giantspike]] or [[Earthspur Mountains]]. However, he'd not investigated this himself to confirm.The map on page 145 of ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'', seen in the sidebar, depicts Mount Grimmerfang as actually just south-east of Mount Wolf."
