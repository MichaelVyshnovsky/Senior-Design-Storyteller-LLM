Nishishima was an island located in Kozakura.
Nishishima was located near Toyaki Province. The island featured rocky beaches and further inland, hills covered in thick forests.
Nishishima was uninhabited. It was used by wako as a temporary hide-out and place to stop to make repairs. The island was also used for initiation ceremonies for new wako crew members. The ceremony involved lighting large bonfires, that were visible far out to sea. These ceremonies were dangerous as evil ghosts and spirits were attracted to the ceremonies and attempted to haunt, possess and even kill any unprotected individual.
