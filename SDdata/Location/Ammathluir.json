        "Geography": "Ammathluir was situated south of the [[Long Forest]] in western Luiren.",
        "Description": "Though it boasted a population of 10,000 [[halfling]]s, only a small fraction of the buildings of Ammathluir were found above ground, leading travelers to believe the city was just a simple village. Most of the population resided within [[halfole]]s underground.\n\nA temple to [[Yondalla]] was built into the side of a hill in Ammathluir.",
        "Inhabitants": "Many skilled woodcarvers and tradesmen lived in Ammathluir, drawing caravans from the nearby [[Great Trade Way]].",
        "Activities": "Luiren traded [[salbread]], [[Luiren Stout]], and various carved wooden items with [[Dambrath]] and the surrounding nations of the Shining South.",
        "Armed Forces": "At least a dozen halfling [[whistler]]s lived in Ammathluir, helping to keep the city safe from wild animal attacks."
