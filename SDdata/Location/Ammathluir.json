        "mainbody": "mmathluir was an important trading hub in Luiren in the Shining South.\nAmmathluir was situated south of the Long Forest in western Luiren.\nThough it boasted a population of 10,000 halflings, only a small fraction of the buildings of Ammathluir were found above ground, leading travelers to believe the city was just a simple village. Most of the population resided within halfoles underground.\nA temple to Yondalla was built into the side of a hill in Ammathluir.\nMany skilled woodcarvers and tradesmen lived in Ammathluir, drawing caravans from the nearby Great Trade Way.\nLuiren traded salbread, Luiren Stout, and various carved wooden items with Dambrath and the surrounding nations of the Shining South.\nAt least a dozen halfling whistlers lived in Ammathluir, helping to keep the city safe from wild animal attacks."
