}}'''Tellerth''' was a medium-sized town found in the [[Barony of Polten]] in [[Damara]]. It was a farming community.

==Geography==
Situated with its fields along the edge of the [[Rawlinswood]], Tellerth was the easternmost settlement found in Damara. connecting it to the [[Merchant's Run]] to the south and to [[Narfell]] to the north.

==History==
During the [[Vaasan War]] of [[1347 DR]], the Baron of Polten, [[Donlevy the Old]], decided to hide his baby son among the folk of Tellerth in order to keep him safe. Thus, [[Donlevy the Young]] grew up as a simple farmer in the town.

During the [[Bloodstone Wars]] of [[1359 DR]], The people of Tellerth adopted an isolationist outlook even from their own barony, turning their back on Baron [[Zorth BelMaris]] when the [[Morov]]–[[Ostel]]–Polten alliance failed to send troops to support the army of [[Bloodstone]]. he was able to reestablish the barony's ties with Tellerth.

The people of Tellerth at this time were supportive of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], and reserved a special enthusiasm for his [[Twilight Riders]], who headed to the town in 1359 DR.

Until the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, any aspirations that Tellerth's people had of logging in the Rawlinswood were stopped by the local [[druid]]s of the [[Circle of Leth]]. However, the Circle was driven from the woods by the [[Rotting Man]] that year. This left the woods without their defenders, but also left Tellerth vulnerable to the Rotting Man as well.

==Inhabitants==
The inhabitants of Tellerth were known for their independent mindset. As a whole, they were distrustful of strangers. 

Tellerth's relationship with the [[centaur]]s of Rawlinswood was not as good as it could have been, and the leader of those centaurs in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], known as the [[Prancer]], was known to strongly dislike [[human]] settlements so close to the forest.

===Notable Inhabitants===
