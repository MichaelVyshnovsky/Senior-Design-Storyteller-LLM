        "mainbody": "he Enlightened Ring was part of the core of the Yikarian Empire in 1367 DR.\nThis central province in the Land of the Yak-Men was located high in the World Pillar Mountains of northeast Zakhara. The Enlightened Ring was framed by three other yikarian provinces including Fiends Wing to the south and east, Ghost Leopard to the north, and Red Goat to the west. Most of the province consisted of a single large plateau.\nThe Elder governed the province, but the ultimate rule of the entire empire fell to the Lotus Emperor in the capital of Nathong atop the Gate of Heaven.\nThough the province was an arid region of the mountains, the soil and rock was rich with minerals. The Elder kept his dwarven slaves toiling away night and day to gather the riches of the earth.\n* Gate of Heaven"
