        "History": "The village was originally founded by nomads hailing from the [[Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue]] as a religious retreat. Most of these nomads were devoted acolytes of [[Hajama]] the Courageous and [[Haku]] the \"Master of the Desert Wind.\"",
        "Inhabitants": "Quabah's original founders were all strictly celibate males.\n\nThe culture of Quabah changed when [[Yezeed]], a revisionist leader, adjusted their doctrines to allow marriage. Within a generation, women began flocking to Quabah, as word had spread that the men treated their wives with the same reverence they showed the gods."
