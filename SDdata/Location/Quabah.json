        "mainbody": "uabah was a small village that lay south of the Pit of the Ghuls within the High Desert of Zakhara.\nThe village was originally founded by nomads hailing from the Mountains of the Lizards Tongue as a religious retreat. Most of these nomads were devoted acolytes of Hajama the Courageous and Haku the \"Master of the Desert Wind.\" \nQuabahs original founders were all strictly celibate males.\nThe culture of Quabah changed when Yezeed, a revisionist leader, adjusted their doctrines to allow marriage. Within a generation, women began flocking to Quabah, as word had spread that the men treated their wives with the same reverence they showed the gods."
