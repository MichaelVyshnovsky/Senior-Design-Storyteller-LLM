        "mainbody": "A ballad known as ''Lancameth's Last Expedition'' described the final adventure of [[Bryam Lancameth]], a famous explorer from [[Amn]], and his well-known companions, which came to a tragic end in the passages and rooms behind the Wailing Dwarf's facade. Captain Lancameth put up the gold to mount the expedition ostensibly to discover the source of the eerie sound for which the monument was named, but in all likelihood there were hopes of glory and treasure as well. There were no known survivors.\n\nKnown expedition members were:\n* Captain [[Bryam Lancameth]], human fighter of [[Amn]]\n* Lady [[Starthorn]], [[elf]] [[ranger]] from the [[Yuirwood]] of [[Aglarond]]\n* [[Nhair Ebendar]], [[halfling]] [[rogue]] from [[Athkatla]]\n* [[Dog Wizard]], [[wizard]] (real name unknown, race unknown, possibly [[tiefling]])\n* Matron [[Iremar]], priestess of [[Oghma]]",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "* The braided beard was over 1,000 ft (305 m) long and was carved tucked into the Dwarf's belt.\n* The Dwarf's hands rested on the haft of a spectacularly large double-bladed [[battleaxe]].\n* The giant helm was carved with dwarven runes in a forgotten language and may have been adorned with [[gem]]s.\n* The First Antechamber was a large cavern located at the end of a long throat-like passage.\n* Another passage from the First Antechamber led to a large abandoned dwarven city carved into both sides of a great rift, crisscrossed by ancient suspension bridges, elevated roads, and stone paths of dubious safety."

        "Defenses": "The first challenge to gaining entry was the exposed climb up Mount Batyr and along the narrow path to the statue's mouth. The breezes in and out of the eyes and mouth were erratic; from light zephyrs to gale-force winds. At their strongest, objects and creatures not securely fastened to stone were either blown out to plummet nearly 4,000 ft (1,220 m) or sucked down the 100 ft (30 m) throat to land unceremoniously in the First Antechamber.\n\nThe First Antechamber was the station of the first [[guardian naga]] who reportedly had four [[troll]]s in [[chain]]s, likely insane from centuries of captivity, used as a [[regenerate|regenerating]] food source. Guardian nagas were known to be very inquisitive about spells, rituals, and esoteric knowledge, and acquisitive of new and interesting magic items. Therefore, it was theoretically possible to negotiate an escape from the jaws of death, but a guardian naga would never bargain for passage into the heart of the mountain.",

        "Rumors and Legends": "Many have speculated about the cause of the sounds emitted from the towering Dwarf. The most common theory was that it was caused by the temperature differential between the air inside the structure and the air outside. However, anyone who experienced the mercurial nature and unexpected power of the Dwarf's \"breath\" was quickly disabused of any notion that the Dwarf's wail had a simple explanation.\n\nIf ''Lancameth's Last Expedition'' was based on fact, then it stands to reason that the items and weapons of that ill-fated exploration party came into the possession of the guardian nagas patrolling the Wailing Dwarf. Each of the stalwart adventurers had a signature weapon that added to their renown. According to legend, they were:\n* Lancameth's ''[[Clockwork blade of venom|Clockwork Blade of Venom]]''\n* Starthorn's ''[[Bow of death's rain|Bow of Death's Rain]]''\n* Ebendar's ''[[Punching dagger of Quar-Shan|Punching Dagger of Quar-Shan]]''\n* Dog Wizard's ''[[Jagged staff of Hellgate|Jagged Staff of Hellgate]]''\n* Iremar's ''[[Astral mace of blasting|Astral Mace of Blasting]]''\n\nIn the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]], the [[ogre mage]]s [[Sothillis]] and [[Cyrvisnea]] discovered a history of [[House Kuldelver]] entitled ''[[Runes of the Wailing Dwarf]]'' in the abandoned home of the [[Horned Mage]] somewhere in the [[Small Teeth Mountains]]. This and other historical documents led the pair to plot and eventually attack [[Esmeltaran]] with the hope of finding the plundered and relocated Armory of [[Nedeheim]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the [[guardian naga]]s and the [[troll]]s that managed to survive outside the naga's jurisdiction, the ancient dwarven dwelling was inhabited by [[spider]]s, [[ooze]]s, [[slime]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and gloomy dwarven [[ghost]]s.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], [[cloaker]]s and [[stirge]]s were noted as inhabiting the structure.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]] it was reported that the malformed [[maur]] [[Managg]] had taken up residence in the bowels of the Wailing Dwarf and was rallying the remaining troll tribes."
