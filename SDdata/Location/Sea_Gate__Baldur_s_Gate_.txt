The '''Sea Gate''' was a gate and local landmark in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was situated in the city's Old Wall, in the region separating the [[Upper City]] district of [[Manorborn]] from the [[Lower City]] district of [[Seatower]].

It was one of the city's four, generally lesser well-known, "[[patriar]] gates" that connected the poor Lower City to the Upper City. These entrance ways were constructed using private funds and were only accessible to the city's wealthy noble class, those individuals bearing their livery, or certain powerful criminal individuals.
