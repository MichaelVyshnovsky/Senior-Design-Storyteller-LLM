The Sea Gate was a gate and local landmark in the city of Baldurs Gate. It was situated in the citys Old Wall, in the region separating the Upper City district of Manorborn from the Lower City district of Seatower.
It was one of the citys four, generally lesser well-known, "patriar gates" that connected the poor Lower City to the Upper City. These entrance ways were constructed using private funds and were only accessible to the citys wealthy noble class, those individuals bearing their livery, or certain powerful criminal individuals.
