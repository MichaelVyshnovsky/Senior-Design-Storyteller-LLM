        "mainbody": "'''Alonmarch''' was a county in [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|Duchy]] [[Suretmarch]] in eastern [[Tethyr]].",
        "Geography": "Alonmarch was located just where the lowlands and the highlands of Tethyr met.",
        "Government": "In [[1370 DR]], Count [[Vartan Thrynnar]] ruled Alonmarch from his castle of [[Thynnar's Hold]] atop [[Komar's Hill]].",
        "History": "Alonmarch was one of the few stable areas of the country during the unrest of the Tethyrian Interregnum, because Count Vartan Thrynnar went out of his way to protect his tenant peasants, permitting some of them to even take refuge in Thrynnar's Hold.\n\nThe region had traditionally been the site of many monster uprisings, as was the case with much of eastern Tethyr. In 1370 DR, because of the conflict with [[Teldorn Darkhope]] southeast in [[Kzelter]] and the defection of two cities from [[Amn]] in the north, many of the needed troops had been pulled out of the area.",
        "Notable Locations": "The home of the [[Knights Kuldar]], the fortified religious settlement of [[Barakmordin]] was located within Alonmarch.\n\nThe [[Tardeth Llanistaph|Duke's]] mansion of [[Veaddakar]] was also located here."
