        "mainbody": "'''Demoncysts''' were pockets of the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 248: The Hidden Layer|Hidden Layer]], the 248{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], that had become linked to the [[Prime Material plane]] and scattered across the [[Demonlands]].",
        "Description": "Demoncysts were enclosed spaces containing fragments of the Hidden Layer, a barren and rocky [[Cosmology|plane]] of violent lightning storms. The cysts were typically 100 feet (30.5 meters) or more in diameter. The Abyssal environment inside them did not interact with the surrounding terrestrial environment (and vice versa), although creatures could freely pass into and out of them. Thus, each demoncyst appeared as a fully self-contained cavern or bubble of the Hidden Layer's weather and topography.",
        "Geography": "Demoncysts were scattered across the Demonlands of [[northeast Faerûn]].",
        "History": "The demoncysts first appeared ''circa'' {{YearlinkName|-160}}, when [[Eltab]] was summoned by Narfell to fight in the [[Great Conflagration (war)|Great Conflagration]] against [[Raumathar]]. Somehow, this summons also bound pieces of his Abyssal realm, the Hidden Layer, to the Material Plane, and these pieces became scattered across northeast Faerûn. The locus of this binding of the two planes was a [[calling circle]] called the ''[[Adamantine Binding]]'' inside Eltab's palace, which was located inside the largest demoncyst, known as the [[Hall of the Hidden Throne]], in the depths of the [[Citadel of Conjurers]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|204}}, the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi deity]] [[Anhur]] imprisoned Eltab within a demoncyst beneath [[Thaymount]]. \n\nIn the 600s DR, settlers in the Great Dale uncovered many demoncysts, and inadvertently released many of the inhabitants.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|922}}, the [[Zulkir]] of [[Conjuration]] [[Jorgmacdon]] ruptured a demoncyst when he temporarily released Eltab to fight for the forces of Thay, causing waters from the [[Styx]] to flow out of the cyst and create the [[River Eltar]].\n\nEltab was freed from his imprisonment in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. Although free, Eltab was unable to return to the Abyss due to the ''Adamandine Binding'', and so returned to the demoncyst instead. In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the demon lord was driven out and resettled in the demoncyst of the Hall of the Hidden Throne.",
        "Inhabitants": "Some demoncysts contained [[demons]], [[half-fiend]]s, [[tiefling]]s, or other servants of Eltab, while others were empty save for whatever entered from the Realms."
