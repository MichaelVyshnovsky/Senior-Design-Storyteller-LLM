        "Geography": "The settlement was built on the coast of the [[Narrow Sea]], between [[Bandor]] and [[Northreach]].",
        "Trade": "Vandal Station traded heavily with nearby Bandor Village, buying the [[silver]] and [[gold]] mined there.",
        "History": "Vandal Station was founded in {{yearlinkConvert|723|NY}} by the [[Vandals]] tribe of Rengarths, who fiercely protected the area as far away as the [[Cold Forest]]. During the following [[Silver Age]], the [[Netherese]] took up aggressive mining expeditions in the [[Barren Mountains]], coming into conflict with the Vandals as they passed. This came to a head in {{yearlinkConvert|1412|NY}} when the Vandals killed an entire group of miners and their guards who had been digging up their sacred burial grounds in search for gold and silver.\n\nA plague from Bandor Village struck in {{yearlinkConvert|2328|NY}}, sweeping through the population and reducing it from 4500 to fewer than 500 souls. Unable to protect their ancestral lands, most of the survivors moved to distant [[Frostypaw]], while the few who remained patrolled the land in small groups in an attempt to protect their most important sites.\n\nVandal Station ceased even being a village in {{yearlinkConvert|2784|NY}}, with just a few scattered holdouts residing in the area. The ruins of the city became covered in a sheet of lethally cold ice, and in the spring of {{yearlinkConvert|3353|NY}} wolves descended upon the site and took the last Vandal bodies, fully removing Vandal Station from history."
