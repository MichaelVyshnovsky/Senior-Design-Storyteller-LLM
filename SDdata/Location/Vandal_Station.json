        "mainbody": "Vandal Station was a Rengarth town during the time of ancient Netheril.\nThe settlement was built on the coast of the Narrow Sea, between Bandor and Northreach.\nVandal Station traded heavily with nearby Bandor Village, buying the silver and gold mined there.\nVandal Station was founded in  by the Vandals tribe of Rengarths, who fiercely protected the area as far away as the Cold Forest. During the following Silver Age, the Netherese took up aggressive mining expeditions in the Barren Mountains, coming into conflict with the Vandals as they passed. This came to a head in  when the Vandals killed an entire group of miners and their guards who had been digging up their sacred burial grounds in search for gold and silver.\nA plague from Bandor Village struck in , sweeping through the population and reducing it from 4500 to fewer than 500 souls. Unable to protect their ancestral lands, most of the survivors moved to distant Frostypaw, while the few who remained patrolled the land in small groups in an attempt to protect their most important sites.\nVandal Station ceased even being a village in , with just a few scattered holdouts residing in the area. The ruins of the city became covered in a sheet of lethally cold ice, and in the spring of  wolves descended upon the site and took the last Vandal bodies, fully removing Vandal Station from history."
