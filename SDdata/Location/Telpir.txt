Telpir (also seen as Telpiir) was an independent city on the Dragon Coast. The city stood north of Turmish, with the nations borders within an eyesight of Telpirs walls, and east of Starmantle.
Telpir was located at the eastern tip of the Dragon Coast just past the point where the coastline turned southward. The Sea of Fallen Stars was to the north and east, the Gulthmere Forest was to the south and west. Beyond the forest to the southwest were the Mountains of the Alaoreum, and northern Turmish was due south. The island of Storna was also a few miles off the coast from Telpir.

The city walls of Telpir were built in a semicircle around the part of the city what was not bordered by water. The drystone wall a low structure with a single wooden lookout tower, that often collapsed during storms.
Telpir was a port city and was known to trade with other cities on the Inner Sea. As of the , the nascent nation called the Holy Realm, founded by the Fellowship of the Purple Staff in the eastern Gulthmere, had economic ties to Telpir. The dwarves of Ironfang Deep and the Mountains of the Alaoreum also traded with merchants out of Telpir.
Telpir maintained close relationships with the neighboring nation of Turmish. A “friendly ally,” shared a mutually beneficial trade pact. Additionally, Telpir and Turmish offered each-others ships a “port haven,” allowing ships in distress enter the harbor for safety and repair. The allyship of the two also often brought hugh but fluctuating numbers of Turmishite inhabitants to the city of Telpir.
The governing body of Telpir was a voting advisory council called the Archave. All nine council members were elected by the Telpirs landowners (within the city walls only). The election took place every summer. Each decision agreed upon by the Archave was passed along to the city ruler – the Lord of Telpir, who, in turn, enacted their resolutions into law. The Lord of Telpir was also in charge of policing the city as well as enforcing the law of the land. Overall power levels in the hands of acting Lords of Telpir varied from one ruler to another. Some found ways to creatively reinterpret the Archaves directives, while others simply acted as symbolic leaders. Oftentimes, the High Priest of the Tower of the Morning was just as influential as the Lord of Telpir.
