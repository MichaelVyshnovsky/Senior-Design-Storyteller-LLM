'''Fisher's Float''' was an [[earthmote]] located in the vicinity of the [[Docks District (Neverwinter)|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]].
 
==Description==
Fisher's Float hovered over the [[Sea of Swords]] south of Neverwinter's Docks. A small and thriving fishing village was located on the earthmote.

==History==
The village of Fisher's Float was founded by survivors of the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]]. Although rumors about how the fishermen had thrived since those days because they had made pacts with dark powers were pretty common in Neverwinter, the Neverwintans nonetheless traded with them ever since the foundation of the village.
