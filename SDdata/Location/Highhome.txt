'''Highhome''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] fastness{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}
{{Quote|With this [[sword]], forged by the dwarves of Highhome, I pledge to remain stalwart and true.|[[Cymrych Hugh]]}}

==Description==
This dwarven stronghold was naturally protected by the surrounding mountains.

==History==
Highhome was founded by dwarves circa [[-7000 DR|–7000 DR]].

Some time prior to [[-201 DR|–201 DR]], the [[Sword of Cymrych Hugh]] was forged by Highhome dwarves.

In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], there were only a handful of defenders (known as cragwardens) left to protect Highhome.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|61}} In the same century, a [[ki-rin]] named [[Daiwon]] fought off a [[red dragon]] and took refuge in Highhome.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Finellen]], a [[shield dwarf]] hero of the [[Darkwalker War]]
