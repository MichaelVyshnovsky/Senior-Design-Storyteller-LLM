Highhome was a dwarven fastness
This dwarven stronghold was naturally protected by the surrounding mountains.
Highhome was founded by dwarves circa –7000 DR.
Some time prior to –201 DR, the Sword of Cymrych Hugh was forged by Highhome dwarves.
In the 15 century DR, there were only a handful of defenders (known as cragwardens) left to protect Highhome. In the same century, a ki-rin named Daiwon fought off a red dragon and took refuge in Highhome.
