        "mainbody": "Thonns Fist (also known as Vosos) was the largest island in the Archipelago of Altumbel on the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThe islands was a massive granite cliff, originally referred to in some primitive human tongue as \"Raunshee\", a name meaning \"club-head\". Beneath its surface, Thonns Fist was tunneled out by its kobold inhabitants, possibly connecting to the Underdark on mainland. These tunnels were so extensive that many of them suffered collapses on the surface. At least one of these collapses left open to the sky a huge cavern, which had been used by the kobolds as a temple to Kurtulmak until rainwater filled the cavern, turning it into a shallow lake.\nThe kobolds that made their home on Thonns Fist grew fungi on both its surface and within their underground dirt chambers.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, as part of larger invasion of islands south of Altumbel a force of kobolds overran Thonns Fist, driving out what few hermits or fisher-folk were living there. In the years that followed at least pirate raids were conducted against the island, both of which the kobolds managed to repulse.\n* Temple of Kurtulmak After a surface collapse and rainwater left the cavern it was housed in to become a lake, the kobolds relocated this to the deeper reaches of their warrens."
