The Street of the Learned exited Huzuz through the Craft District, leading many students to the ferries that transported them to Al-Bidir Sallah on the opposite bank of Al-Sarif River.\nAs the name implied, the Craft District was the home of many artisans and craftsmen, including some major families and guilds.
