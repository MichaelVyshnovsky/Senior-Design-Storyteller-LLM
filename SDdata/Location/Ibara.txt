'''Ibara''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Ibara was situated near the shores of [[Nora-ko]].

==Trade==
Despite being located on Nora-ko, the village primarily engaged in farming rather than fishing. The notorious and ominous reputation of Nora-ko has deterred all but the most daring or reckless villagers from venturing onto its waters. This apprehension has effectively isolated Ibara, turning it into a tranquil, somewhat secluded community.

==Government==
As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the village's [[myoshu]] was [[Gobo (hengeyokai)|Gobo]]. The village's calm demeanor was well-suited to Gobo, who harbored a secret identity as a cat [[hengeyokai]] and was also a [[wu jen]]. While the villagers had their suspicions about Gobo's true nature, there was no open hostility towards him, largely due to the significant influence and control he wielded over their lives. Gobo's rule was characterized by tyranny and impulsiveness, and he often made harsh demands of the [[Kozakuran dictionary#H|''hyakusho'']] under his authority. The villagers' fear of his mysterious powers kept them compliant and in check.
