        "mainbody": "he Bubble Net, or Waterspout, was an elemental vortex connecting two elemental planes.\nThe Bubble Net was what the marids called a large column of air that connected the Elemental Plane of Water to the Elemental Plane of Air, allowing passage to clouds of the Elemental Plane of Air.\nOn the Elemental Plane of Air, the djinn called this vortex the Waterspout because it resembled a large tornado made of water. Djinn attempting to travel to the Elemental Plane of Water through this vortex suffered from dangerous riptides plaguing the water.\nThis vortex was said to be created by a great leviathan pulling air from the greatest depths of the Elemental Plane of Water."
