        "Geography": "Rainbow Gorge was located on the south side of the central Rauvin Mountains, between [[Mount Gaeram]] and [[Faerang's Doom]]. It connected to Dead Orc Pass to create a pass through the mountains.",
        "Description": "Rainbow Gorge was the exit of the River Rauvin from the [[Rauvinheart caverns]], through which the river passed under the Rauvin Mountains from the [[Cold Wood]]. Geothermal heat forced the waters out in geysers before emerging in waterfalls out of the cliff face at the gorge. The mist in the air created a constant rainbow. A steep, ancient trail followed the east side of the gorge along Faerang's Doom until it reached Dead Orc Pass.",
