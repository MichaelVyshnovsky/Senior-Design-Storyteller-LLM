        "mainbody": "The Genies Anvil, also called Saddan al-Jinn, was a barren stretch of land in the High Desert of Zakhara laying between the Mountains of Forgotten Dreams and the Mountains of the Lizards Tongue. \nMany dangerous obstacles threatened would-be travelers in this land. Vicious dust storms could blind riders so they could not even see the ears of their camels. Rain rarely fell, and sources of water were practically non-existent. Scorching daytime temperatures could be followed by freezing nights.\nAside from its nasty weather, the Genies Anvil was also home to the House of Sihr, a tribe of enlightened jann. Amir Bouladin al-Mutajalli, their leader, had a reputation for ruthlessness.\n* Tomb of Anak-Raya This old burial site stored the Scrolls of Destiny."
