        "mainbody": "hang-liu-shui, or Inexhaustible Spring Halt, was a small town located on the Spice Road on the Plain of Horses.\nThis oasis could be found between the Merket Depression and the Ni-Ko Oasis.\nThe actual well was found beneath a lone willow tree near a muddy pond. Water from the well was drawn from a clean underground river. The constant supply of water from the river, which allowed it to never dry out, even in the worst heats, spawned the nickname of Inexhaustible Spring Halt.\nA small house, half buried in the ground, was located near the pond. Altho Farambler, a halfing from Faer√ªn, had setup a small business here by 1359 DR, often selling water to travelers."
