'''Dock Ward''' was one of the four port wards of the city of [[Calimport]].<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />
{{Quote|Just ask anybody—they'll tell ya Dock Ward 'as the most o'everything!|A common testimonial from a seaman of Dock Ward<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />}}

==Description==
Dock Ward had the highest percentage of taverns and [[festhall]]s in the whole metropolis of Calimport. It also had the most warehouses and the most shipping berths, even more than neighboring [[Calimport/Armada Ward|Armada Ward]], where the [[Nallojal|navy]] kept their ships.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

The ward was known for its rowdy entertainment. After taverns, festhalls, and inns, the next most common buildings were warehouses, followed by cheap row houses built atop the ward's taverns and then by [[rope]] sellers and sail makers.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 /> Structures made of mud bricks or wood, with thatched roofs, were common here.<ref name=Calimport-p26> There were a few houses or other larger buildings, such as the villas of the [[pasha]]s of sea-related guilds, but these were rare.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

The public docks were located here and in [[Calimport/Hook Ward|Hook Ward]] to the east.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 /> Dock Ward was a long and narrow ward, stretching west to east on the water. To the north, it bordered [[Calimport/Palace Ward|Palace Ward]], [[Calimport/Jewel Ward|Jewel Ward]], [[Calimport/Grand Ward|Grand Ward]], [[Calimport/Quill Ward|Quill Ward]], and [[Calimport/Wizard Ward|Wizard Ward]].<ref name=Calimport-p29>

==Government==
The ruler of the ward was Sultan [[Batras el Tuladim|Batras yn Faruk el Tuladim]]. He was promoted to the position of sultan by [[Syl-pasha|Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]] for helping the rising [[caleph]] attain his position during the [[Darkstalker Wars]]. Batras, a [[sabbalad]] at the time, used his connections with the guilds of harbormasters and shipbuilders to financially ruin his own opponents, while he arranged for the murders of members of [[El Djenispool]], the main opponents of [[El Pesarkhal]].<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

As Dock Ward's leader, Batras preferred to allow the guilds to be run by their pashas.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

==Sabbans==
Dock Ward was divided into three ''[[sabban]]s'' with nine ''[[drudach]]''s.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

===Aktorral Sabban===
Also known as "Tavern Sabban", this ''sabban'' was dominated by alcohol-selling establishments.  It contained three ''drudachs'': Qademit Drudach, Markhib Drudach, and Meena Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

The mark for this ''sabban'' was a [[mug]] of ale, with the liquid forming a wave at the top.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

; Notable Locations
; The Ninth Bell : This was a popular two-story tavern. Location: Qademit Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />
; [[Palace of the Cresting Wave]] : This luxurious, seven-story temple was dedicated to [[Istishia]], the god of [[elemental water]]. Location: Markhib Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />
; The Black Dolphin's Wake : This was another two-story tavern. Location: Markhib Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />
; Shipmates' Hall : This well-built, five-story building was the base of the Master Mariners' Guild of Calimport. Location: Meena Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

===Jarûz Sabban===
Also known as "Festhall Sabban", this district was known for its many festhalls.  It contained three ''drudachs'': Harayal Drudach, Bayown Drudach, and Rehla Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

The ''sabban'' mark was a pair of dice. Residents and visitors liked to touch the ''sabban'' mark for good luck, and in many places in the district, the mark had been worn down to a pair of cubes.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

; Notable Locations

; Maridah : The "House of the [[Marid]]", this four-story building served as the headquarters for the League of Harbormasters, Dock-Workers, and Ferrymen. Location: Bayown Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />
; The [[Copper Ante]] : This simple, two-story festhall was a gambling hotspot and tavern owned and frequented by [[halfling]]s. The building had a cellar, and before the Darkstalker Wars, it was also the base for multiple halfling criminal organizations. Location: Rehla Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

===Ylar Sabban===
Also known as "Inn Sabban", this district contained the largest concentration of inns in the ward.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />

; Shelamardah : This three-story building was the headquarters of the Loyal Order of Fishmongers. Location: Affar Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp62-64 />
