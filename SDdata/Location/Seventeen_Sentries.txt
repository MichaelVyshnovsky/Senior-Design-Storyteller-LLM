The '''Seventeen Sentries''' were a mysterious circle of [[standing stone]]s in central [[Amn]].

==Description==
The Sentries were a circle of seventeen monolithic stones atop a small hill. The grass between them was always green, and travelers who slept within its bounds were never disturbed by wild animals and always received a refreshing night's sleep. [[Druid]]s suggested that the stone circle was a holy site of [[Silvanus]] and other nature [[god]]s.

==Geography==
The Sentries lay on the south face of the [[Lake Way]] ridge, a day's ride east from [[Purskul]] along the [[South Fork]].
