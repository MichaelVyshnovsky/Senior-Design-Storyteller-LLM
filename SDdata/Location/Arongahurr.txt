Arongahurr was an enclave of Netheril that was destroyed during the Fall, notable for its ultimate distance from its homeland.
When the enclave crashed, it came to a rest on the shores of Yal Tengri at the east end of the Shadowmount Peaks, just north of the Iceroot Forest.
After crashing during Karsuss Folly in , the enclave was ruined but still partially intact. Due it its remote location, it remained completely unknown to the wider world through the 15 century DR.
