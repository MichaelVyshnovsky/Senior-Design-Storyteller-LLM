        "mainbody": "undaria was a barony briefly in place in County Morninggold in Tethyr during the Tethyrian Interregnum.\nThe barony lay in a valley in the southwestern foothills of the Snowflake Mountains. It was surrounded by gentle rolling hills and farmland.\nMorninggold Keep, the county seat of County Morninggold, stood in the same valley as this barony.\nOn paper, the ruler of Pundaria was Baron Pundar, though his appointment was contested by Countess Zaranda Star. Pundar had appointed the half-ogre Togrev as \"lord high commander of the armed forces of Pundaria\".\nIn late spring of the , when Zaranda Star journeyed from her castle to the city of Zazesspur to sell loot acquired in Thay, she encountered a band of bandits who were raiding farmhouses and killing peasants. They claimed to be collecting taxes for Baron Pundar, who had been legally appointed ruler by the \"capital\" of Zazesspur, by reason of \"ancient right\". Zaranda refuted such claims, insisting that she was countess of the region and that there was no true capital of Tethyr at the time with the authority to appoint barons. She challenged the leader of the bandits, Togrev, to single combat, and slew him."
