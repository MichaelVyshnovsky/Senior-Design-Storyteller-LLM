'''Lhuvenhead''' was a village in the [[Rauvin Vale]] within [[Luruar]].

==Geography==
Lhuvenhead was located along the [[River Rauvin]], forty miles upriver from [[Everlund]] along the [[trail between Everlund and Sundabar]].

==Trade==
As a lucrative river town with decrepit docks, Lhuvenhead was crowded with [[barge]]s and [[keelboat]]s all year long. A number of inns, taphouses, and festhalls catered to the riverfolk who worked on the Rauvin.

==History==
On [[Flamerule 1]], [[1485 DR]], Lhuvenhead was destroyed by the [[orc]] forces of [[Many-Arrows]] led by [[Hartusk]] as they approached Everlund. The village had already been abandoned so there were no casualties, but all the docks and buildings were burned or torn down, with the debris sent floating down the river.

==Inhabitants==
The village served as a summer retreat for the nobility of [[Sundabar]]  and Everlund.
