Llewellyn was a small coastal town located in the kingdom of Callidyrr on the island of Alaron within the Moonshae Isles.
Llewellyn was located along the High Kings Road in southern Callidyrr in the county of Stirgewick. The town sat along the eastern coast with the Strait of Alaron on the north end of Llewellyn Harbor within Bregonshire.
Several hundred cottages filled the town, surrounding a few larger structures.
Llewellyn was named after its Lord Llewellyn.
A stone tower located about a mile from the shore provided a degree of protection against raiding Northlanders.
