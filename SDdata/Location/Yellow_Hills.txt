'''Yellow Hills''' was a little-known and mostly unimportant [[gnome|gnomish]] settlement in [[Faerûn]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the only notable thing that came from Yellow Hills were [[Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodle]]s, a type of eccentric chairs that were so preposterous, they were sure to become the latest rage in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. The equally eccentric merchant and interiors decorator [[Yani Pavani]] was especially enamored with the outlandish items.
