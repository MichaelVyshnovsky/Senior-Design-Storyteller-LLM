The '''Lands of Intrigue''' was a collective term used to describe the nations of [[Amn]], [[Calimshan]], [[Muranndin]], [[Erlkazar]], [[Velen]] and [[Tethyr]].

An older term for the same territory was the '''Empires of the Sands''',<ref name=EotS-backcover> though that term was a misnomer, as out of all the nations that made up the region only Calimshan had any deserts to speak of.
