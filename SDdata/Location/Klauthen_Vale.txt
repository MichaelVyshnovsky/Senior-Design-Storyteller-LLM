'''Klauthen Vale''' was an area of land claimed by [[Klauth]], a [[red dragon]], in the [[Spine of the World]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Klauth, "Old Snarl"}}

==Geography==
Found lying among the mountains west of [[Mirabar]] and east of [[Raven Rock]], the valley was a narrow and winding chasm.

The vale was protected from the cold climate of the North thanks to ancient and powerful magics, which changed its climate to remain always warm despite the season.

==Description==
"Old Snarl" filled the valley with sheep, goats, and [[rothé]] for eating.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Orothryn's Well]] : This tiny but very deep pond was found in the middle of the valley.

==History==
Klauth made the valley his home after he almost died in a crash there on the [[Mirtul 4|fourth of Mirtul]] in [[1360 DR]]. He had been wounded after a battle with three other dragons. He remained in hiding within the valley to gather his strength and made it his new lair.
