'''Jiksidur''' was a [[Netherese]] [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Netheril]] ruled by the Sorcerer-King [[Larloch]].

==History==
Larloch rose to become Sorcerer-King of the enclave of Jiksidur in Netheril.

In [[-339 DR|the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR]], Larloch had Jiksidur hovering high over [[east Faerûn]] to spy on the rival empires of [[Narfell]] and [[Raumathar]]. A [[contingency]] spell warned Larloch that Jiksidur was facing impending doom, and he fled the city riding a [[dragon]], [[Aungahlaumitor]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_(2010-2016).zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 11-30-2021| date = 11-30-202}}. Very soon after, Netheril suffered [[Karsus's Folly]], all magic failed, and Jiksidur fell from the sky. It flipped over in its descent and crashed upside down into the earth, utterly destroyed under its own weight.

Jiksidur had landed in the plains of Narfell. Soon after its fall, agents of the [[Nentyarch]] tunneled into the mountaintop and excavated the ruins, seeking whatever treasures they could salvage. Some of these ultimately ended up in the tombs of [[Nar demonbinder]]s. The remains of Jiksidur later came to be known as the mountain of [[Hark's Finger]].

Larloch later traded with [[Szass Tam]] to recover some of the treasures of Jiksidur. However, most of its surviving wealth and magic was still buried under the mountain as late as [[1374 DR]]. At this time, it was one of only three Netherese enclaves to have its ruins located and identified.
