        "mainbody": "Loravatha was a small human realm in northwest Faer√ªn, created from the destruction of the kingdom of Delimbiyran in 697 DR.\nLoravatha lay in the Forlorn Hills, atop the dwarven realm of Dardath. The land was hilly and broken, with grasses and small scrub forests.\nLoravatha was originally a barony of the kingdom of Delimbiyran. Succeeding Phalorm in the , Delimbiyran overtook the lands formerly held by the dwarven and elven realms of Dardath and Ardeep.\nIn the , the Sharran high priestess Lalondra Worul became a lich, in the process killing her faithful True Servants of Shar who controlled an extensive network of Sharran temples across the Sword Coast. Completely uncontrolled, the leaderless faithful of her church caused mayhem and destruction across the region, and threatened numerous cities and realms. When King Davyd Snowsword of Delimbiyran deployed his soldiers in force to counter the violence, he was assassinated by a Sharran fanatic. Without a clear heir, King Davyds realm fell into civil war and broke apart into the independent small realms of Loravatha, Calandor, Harpshield, Talmost, Scathril, Dauntylgar, Secomber, and more lost to history.\nShortly after in the , an orcish force from the High Forest invaded and destroyed several of the weakened and disunited claimants. The Duke of Calandor managed to form an alliance with his rivals, and together they threw back the invasion. Though the realms remained independent, their wars largely ended thanks to this instance of cooperation.\nBy the 14 century DR, Loravatha and most of the other realms had disappeared, with the notable exceptions of Daggerford and Secomber. One of the few remnants of Loravatha was the Crumbling Stair, a destroyed mansion and arcane school from the time of Phalorm."
