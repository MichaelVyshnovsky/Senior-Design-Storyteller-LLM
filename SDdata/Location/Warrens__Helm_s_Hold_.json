        "mainbody": "The '''Warrens''', also known as the '''Underscar''', was an series of underground tunnels that snaked beneath an area of [[Helm's Hold]].",
        "Geography": "The Warrens' other nickname originated from the fact they were located beneath [[Scar Alley]].",
        "History": "As Helm's Hold grew in population, local engineers were forced to expand city infrastructure. They began excavation beneath Scar Alley in order to accommodate new tunnels for drainage. Unfortunately they inadvertently broke through into the subterranean [[Crypts of the Vigilant Eye]], and were overrun by monstrous creatures. By the time the [[Spellplague]] wreaked destruction upon the region, in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, The entire undertaking was left unfinished and the tunnels were abandoned by city officials.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]], ''circa'' the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Ashmadai]] took hold within the Warrens, led by a [[devil]] known as the [[Shepherd of the Damned]]. The monstrous fiend was slain by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] before the siege finally came to an end.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that some tunnels deep within the Warrens connected to the underground [[Sanatorium]], located beneath the [[Cathedral of Helm]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Since the Warrens' abandonment, its passageways became a haven for small, [[:Category:Monstrous humanoids|monstrous humanoids]] such as [[kobold]]s and [[goblin]]s, that had been afflicted by [[spellscar]]s."
