        "mainbody": "'''Kirinwood''' was a large village on the [[Cormyr/Coast|coast]] of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Geography": "Kirinwood was located on the north bank of the [[Kirinar Stream]] that flowed into the [[River Mistwater]] and the [[Dragonmere]]. It was inside a tiny forest of the same name that sheltered the village from strong coastal winds, and east of nearby bogs.",
        "Government": "The village was strongly influenced by a druidic circle called the [[Talkers to the Trees]], which oversaw the surrounding forest and strictly regulated what could be harvested from it.",
        "Trade": "The village lay in the agricultural heartlands of Cormyr amid a small wood tended by druids, making Kirinwood an excellent place to buy crops in bulk or seek guidance on matters of forestry. It had three mills that processed [[oat]]s, [[corn]], [[wheat]], and the farmer's market brought [[alfalfa]], [[fruit]], [[poultry]], and [[egg]]s from surrounding farms. Nearby orchards supplied plentiful [[apple]]s, while the bogs the west yielded [[blueberry|blueberries]] and [[raspberry|raspberries]] harvested with the aid of [[gawl crawler]]s.\n\nThe village made and sold a lot of fern-and-mint [[wine]] that cleared the throat and tasted like [[spruce]] bark. They also made a fiery [[mushroom]] [[ale]] and a famous mushroom gravy that was sent all across Cormyr and the [[Dragon Coast]], both of which sold for 5 [[sp]] per hand keg.\n\nFine white [[sand]] was gathered from ridges north of Kirinwood and used in glassworking at [[Galandor's Glassworks]]. This workshop made exceptionally fine glass objects, from simple [[marbles]] to finely-ground [[lenses]] and complex sculptures, and had customers from around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].",
        "History": "The [[Kirinar]] noble family made their home in remote Kirinwood, and [[Ardest Kirinar]] founded a wizard's school to win some influence and fame in the realm. His plans came to ruination when competing [[mage]]s broke into a fierce spell battle that wiped out his student body, his whole family, and the lower levels of his estate-turned-school. The \"Tower That Will Not Fall\" continued to hover in place regardless, becoming a local attraction that was regularly checked by [[Purple Dragons]] to ensure nothing dangerous took up residence.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Daliver's Door]], a friendly inn.\n* The [[Falling Tower]], the levitating ruins of the Kirinar wizard college.\n* [[Galandor's Glassworks]], a famous [[dwarf|dwarven]] glassworks.\n* The [[Old Troll's Foot]], a druidic restaurant.\n* The [[Unicorn's Pool]], a high-quality tavern.",
        "Inhabitants": "* Sir [[Ajandor Surehand]] was a knight who retired to his family farm in Kirinwood."
