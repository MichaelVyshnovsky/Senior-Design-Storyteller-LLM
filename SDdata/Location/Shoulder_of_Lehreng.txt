The Shoulder of Lehreng, or simply the Shoulder, was a rocky plateau found within the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn.
The low plateau covered the expanse between the Alimir Mountains in the west, the Lake of Steam in the north, Talagaths Gauntlet in the east, and the Shining Sea in the south.
The Shoulder of Lehreng was named for a mythical giant, Lehreng, who was infamous in children stories told in the region.
The town of Tulmon and Suldolphor were located along the edge of the Shoulder.
