        "mainbody": "The '''Bitterstone''' neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]], was a collection of reputable, if somewhat modest, nautical-themed businesses within the city's [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]]. This area was considered the heart of the harbor, its long-standing stone and timber buildings having served the trade and shipping businesses of the Bluff for many decades. From [[Blacktree Boulevard]] in the east to [[Morlgar's Ride]] in the south, the streets of Bitterstone were always bustling with activity and trade, illuminated at night by the glow of [[torch]] lights.\n\nThe area of Bitterstone was named after a Ravenian miller of years past who established a home here when it contained only a few scattered buildings. They were rumored to have been a knight of the nearby kingdom of [[Cormyr]].",
