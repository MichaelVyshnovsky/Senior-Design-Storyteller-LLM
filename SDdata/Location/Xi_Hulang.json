        "mainbody": "Xi Hulang was the capital city of the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur around 1357 DR. It lay at the mouth of the Hoparatu River on Kang Bay.\nThe city was the home of King Wanang Sun, ruler of Koryo. An ex-general, he ran the city, like his kingdom, like an army, always building and upgrading defenses and establishing reliable lines of supply, but also putting in place strict laws and regulations, including curfews, licenses, and annual censuses. However, twice or thrice a year, he went out among the people of the city and listened carefully to their views and received their complaints, before correcting their misconceptions and explaining why he would not alter his rules. The settled workers of the city respected and admired him for this.\nAlso living in Xi Hulang was Merquam Pang, one of the most prosperous merchants of Koryo. He lived with his Shou wife, Mai Lan, in their mansion."
