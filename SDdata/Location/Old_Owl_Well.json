        "mainbody": "'''Old Owl Well''', once known as '''Quesseer''', was a watering hole located in the [[Lost Hills]] north of the [[Sword Mountains]]. It was a popular rest stop for caravan traffic, especially between [[Yartar]] and [[Neverwinter]].",
        "History": "The ancient [[Sarrukh]] had built a vault near the site during the last days of [[Isstosseffifil]]. It had been filled with useful ''[[chardalyn]]s'', but after the fall of their civilization the trapped [[deepspawn]] set to guard the vault caused the entire area to be overrun by spawned magical monsters. This unnatural population of monsters caused the vault to become inaccessible and made the entire region uninhabitable.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|1484|NY}}, at the adamant insistence of the Terraseer [[Arthindol]], the Empire of [[Netheril]] began earnestly colonizing the [[Savage Frontier]] to their west. They established several outposts at which [[Netherese]] travelers heading west could get fresh [[horse]]s and supplies, such as at [[Spirecoast]] and [[Kryptgarden Falls]]. The Terraseer himself identified a perfect spot for one such outpost to be built north of a mineral-rich mountain range, a good spot from which to spy upon the nearby [[elves]]s of [[Illefarn]]. However, the area was infested with [[owlbear]]s, so the Terraseer had his Netherese allies destroy the 3,000-strong population of beasts in a bloody conflict known as the [[Caravan War]]. The outpost was named \"Old Owl Well\" after the victory over the owlbears in {{YearlinkConvert|1491|NY}}.\n\nAfter defeating the successive waves of owlbears and other beasts, the outpost of Quesseer was established. The Netherese scouts then tracked the remaining beasts back to their underground lairs, then found and destroyed the deepspawn within. To their amazement, they found a massive hoard of ''chardalyn'' gems inside. This seemingly chance discovery prompted a great deal of research into the stones and their magical uses, possibly shaping Netheril's development as the Terraseer intended.\n\nA watchtower was built by [[Arthindol]] at this location to act as an outpost. Once secured, [[arcanist]]s arrived and began to drill a hole that eventually dug more than {{SI|5|mile|k|long=yes}} below the surface then, with an extensive system of pipes, they established an everlasting water supply that could provide {{SI|20|gallon|l|long=yes}} per day. Because the Netherese had fought hard over several battles for the site, the elves of Illefarn were already well aware of their presence by the time the outpost could be built. Without the ability to secretly spy upon their neighbors, the Netherese instead made it into a meeting spot for different peoples and nations to trade at. Quesseer thus served as a nexus for Netherese colonists, Illefarni elves, [[Illuskan]] seafarers, [[Ice Hunters|Ice Hunter tribesmen]], and the [[shield dwarves]] of [[Haunghdannar]] to come and meet at. For the next few centuries it became known for its excellent pure water well, and the large numbers of magical beasts that continued to inhabit the surrounding area. This state of affairs continued until it was abandoned in {{YearlinkConvert|1764|NY}}, following the fall of [[Illusk]] to an [[orc]]ish horde.\n\nOld Owl Well remained a strategically important watering hole. Every group that held any power in the nearby regions since the Netherese left (except the [[Harpers]]) claimed ownership of the site. Since [[1360 DR]], a tribe of orcs held Old Owl Well for at least a decade.\n\nThe [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter]] under the command of [[Callum]] of the [[Neverwinter Nine]] retook Old Owl Well from the orcs so that a direct trade route to [[Triboar]] and Yartar could be re-established in order to bring more money into the coffers of struggling Neverwinter, still recovering from its war with [[Luskan]]. Thankfully, the efforts of the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the [[paladin]] [[Casavir]] allowed Neverwinter to keep possession of the site for the foreseeable future.\n\nFollowing the [[Spellplague]], overland traffic through the region all but stopped and the Well was largely forgotten by both [[human]]s and orcs.\n\nIn approximately [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} Old Owl Well was nothing but a ruined watchtower that had nothing but a few crumbling walls. However, the well still pumped clean, fresh water. During that time, a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] named [[Hamun Kost]] had set up camp and began searching the area for hidden lore of an ancient time.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the time of Netheril, Old Owl Well was occupied by a group of warriors who kept the peace and a smaller group of arcanists who used [[crystal ball]]s to scry on nearby Illefarn, watching for signs of aggression.\n\nNearly 3 millennia later, the orc occupants of the Well numbered around 600. Unlike previous owners, the orcs did not charge travelers to use the well; instead, they simply attacked passers-by. Adventurers or particularly capable caravaneers occasionally left them beaten, but they never did enough lasting damage to threaten the orcs' survival. Eventually though, the orcs were devoured by the [[dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]], leaving the Well open to travelers again."
