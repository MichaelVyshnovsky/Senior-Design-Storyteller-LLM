        "mainbody": "Old Owl Well, once known as Quesseer, was a watering hole located in the Lost Hills north of the Sword Mountains. It was a popular rest stop for caravan traffic, especially between Yartar and Neverwinter.\nThe ancient Sarrukh had built a vault near the site during the last days of Isstosseffifil. It had been filled with useful chardalyns, but after the fall of their civilization the trapped deepspawn set to guard the vault caused the entire area to be overrun by spawned magical monsters. This unnatural population of monsters caused the vault to become inaccessible and made the entire region uninhabitable.\nIn , at the adamant insistence of the Terraseer Arthindol, the Empire of Netheril began earnestly colonizing the Savage Frontier to their west. They established several outposts at which Netherese travelers heading west could get fresh horses and supplies, such as at Spirecoast and Kryptgarden Falls. The Terraseer himself identified a perfect spot for one such outpost to be built north of a mineral-rich mountain range, a good spot from which to spy upon the nearby elvess of Illefarn. However, the area was infested with owlbears, so the Terraseer had his Netherese allies destroy the 3,000-strong population of beasts in a bloody conflict known as the Caravan War. The outpost was named \"Old Owl Well\" after the victory over the owlbears in .\nAfter defeating the successive waves of owlbears and other beasts, the outpost of Quesseer was established. The Netherese scouts then tracked the remaining beasts back to their underground lairs, then found and destroyed the deepspawn within. To their amazement, they found a massive hoard of chardalyn gems inside. This seemingly chance discovery prompted a great deal of research into the stones and their magical uses, possibly shaping Netherils development as the Terraseer intended.\nA watchtower was built by Arthindol at this location to act as an outpost. Once secured, arcanists arrived and began to drill a hole that eventually dug more than  below the surface then, with an extensive system of pipes, they established an everlasting water supply that could provide  per day. Because the Netherese had fought hard over several battles for the site, the elves of Illefarn were already well aware of their presence by the time the outpost could be built. Without the ability to secretly spy upon their neighbors, the Netherese instead made it into a meeting spot for different peoples and nations to trade at. Quesseer thus served as a nexus for Netherese colonists, Illefarni elves, Illuskan seafarers, Ice Hunter tribesmen, and the shield dwarves of Haunghdannar to come and meet at. For the next few centuries it became known for its excellent pure water well, and the large numbers of magical beasts that continued to inhabit the surrounding area. This state of affairs continued until it was abandoned in , following the fall of Illusk to an orcish horde.\nOld Owl Well remained a strategically important watering hole. Every group that held any power in the nearby regions since the Netherese left (except the Harpers) claimed ownership of the site. Since 1360 DR, a tribe of orcs held Old Owl Well for at least a decade.\nThe Graycloaks of Neverwinter under the command of Callum of the Neverwinter Nine retook Old Owl Well from the orcs so that a direct trade route to Triboar and Yartar could be re-established in order to bring more money into the coffers of struggling Neverwinter, still recovering from its war with Luskan. Thankfully, the efforts of the Kalach-Cha and the paladin Casavir allowed Neverwinter to keep possession of the site for the foreseeable future.\nFollowing the Spellplague, overland traffic through the region all but stopped and the Well was largely forgotten by both humans and orcs.\nIn approximately 1491 DR, Old Owl Well was nothing but a ruined watchtower that had nothing but a few crumbling walls. However, the well still pumped clean, fresh water. During that time, a Red Wizard of Thay named Hamun Kost had set up camp and began searching the area for hidden lore of an ancient time.\nIn the time of Netheril, Old Owl Well was occupied by a group of warriors who kept the peace and a smaller group of arcanists who used crystal balls to scry on nearby Illefarn, watching for signs of aggression.\nNearly 3 millennia later, the orc occupants of the Well numbered around 600. Unlike previous owners, the orcs did not charge travelers to use the well instead, they simply attacked passers-by. Adventurers or particularly capable caravaneers occasionally left them beaten, but they never did enough lasting damage to threaten the orcs survival. Eventually though, the orcs were devoured by the dragon Claugiyliamatar, leaving the Well open to travelers again."
