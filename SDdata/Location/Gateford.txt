Gateford was a small barony town located in the Western Heartlands, in the vicinity of Berdusk.
Gateford was covered by the Baron of Gateford.
Circa 1372 DR, certain rumors circulated that claimed a romantic thirst between the Baron of Gateford, who was not named, and the High Scrivener of Deneir - Althune Dembrar. These rumors remain unconfirmed while some were confident that Althune Dembrar would never lower herself to the man of the Barons "quality."
