        "mainbody": "vang was a small community on the western edge of Vaasa.\nThe village was nestled at the base of the West Galena Mountains besides a tributary of the Beaumaris River, and lay at the meeting of two trails comprising the east-west route between the Moonsea North and the Bloodstone Lands. The westward trail to the Moonsea led through a pass in the mountains called Garumns Climb, and then continued across the Plains of Barze, through the Vercy Wood, and ended in Ilinvur. The eastward trail connected Avang with the community of Moortown in the Bottomless Bogs of northeastern Vaasa, and to the Dead Mans Walk trail that traversed across the southern part of Vaasa.\nThe community served as a market for supplies and services for local small mines as well as the nearby dwarven community of Delhalls. It served as a way-point on the trails westward.\nIn the spring of the , the town became a place of refuge for peoples uprooted from Ilinvur and the Plains of Barze when elementals from the Tortured Land unexpectedly swept onto their lands and attacked. Over the course of a few months, the influx of refugees led the local population to double."
