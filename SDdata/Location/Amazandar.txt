'''Amazandar''', also known as the '''City of Gems''' was the capital of the [[Lost Kingdoms|Lost Kingdom]] of [[Anauria]].

==Geography==
Amazandar was located west of the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], due west of the peak [[Rausrawna]], known as Mount Shaddath to the Anaurian people, southwest of [[Anauril]], the City of Swords.

===Geographical Features===
The city lay above rich veins of [[gem]]s that could be reached by numerous deep shafts and tunnels.

==Trade==
As the capital of Anauria, Amazandar dominated trade between Anauria, and the other survivor-states of ancient [[Netheril]], [[Asram]], and [[Hlondath]]. 

==History==
The city was founded about the same year as Netheril's fall in {{Yearlink|-339}}. It would eventually have to contend with the encroaching [[Anauroch]] desert. 

In the {{YearlinkName|111}}, pressures from the encroaching desert combined with large raids of goblins led by the orc shaman [[Andegril|Andegril the Wise]], caused the collapse of the kingdom of Anauria.<ref group="note">According to pages 116 of ''[[Netheril: Empire of Magic|Netheril Empire of Magic: The Winds of Netheril]]'', this event occurred in [[450 DR]]. This is direct conflict with a statement on page 12 of the same book that says the kingdom fell in [[111 DR|3970 Netheril Year]], or 111 DR. Its survivors melted away into the surrounding kingdoms, melded into nomadic tribes or perished in the harsh conditions.

==Rumors and Legends==
A crypt system beneath a temple of [[Jergal]] in the city was said to house the fabulous tomb of [[Thausimbel Thardresk|King Thausimbel the Wise]] and his daughter, [[Shaddara|Queen Shaddara the Fair]]..

==Inhabitants==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, over a thousand years after the fall of Anuaria, the gem mines beneath Amazandar were inhabited by the [[phaerimm]] of the [[Buried Realms]].
