The '''Rauvin Vale''' was a valley dominated by the [[River Rauvin]] in [[Luruar]].

==Geography==
{{Climate/Silver Marches/River valley}}
The Rauvin Vale was bordered by the [[Nether Mountains]] to the north, the [[High Forest]] ([[Turlang's Wood]]) to the south, [[Everlund Pass]] and the [[Silverwood]] to the west, and [[Moon Pass]] to the east. <ref group="note">The fold-out map included in the ''[[Silver Marches (sourcebook)|Silver Marches]]'' sourcebook labels the area between the Nether Mountains and the High Forest the "Upper Rauvin Vale." The same map labels the area along the Rauvin River west of [[Silverymoon]] the "Lower Rauvin Vale." However, the sourcebook itself refers only to the "Rauvin Vale." The novel ''[[Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf]]'' states that [[Lhuvenhead]] was the largest settlement in the Rauvin Vale (page 329), indicating that only the area between the Nether Mountains and the High Forest should be considered the Rauvin Vale.

==Inhabitants==
Communities of [[human]]s, [[elf|elves]], [[goblin]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[ogre]]s dwelt in the vale. In the 14th century [[Dalereckoning|DR]], [[troll]]s uprooted from their homes in the [[Evermoors]] often wandered into the Rauvin Vale in search of new lairs.

==Wildlife==
Common wildlife in the Rauvin Vale were [[brown bear]]s, [[deer]], [[elk]], [[rothé]], [[red tiger]], and [[Wolf|wolves]]. [[Dire bear]]s, [[dire wolf|dire wolves]], [[dire rat]]s, [[worg]]s, [[wereboar]]s, and [[werewolf|werewolves]] were occasionally spotted.
