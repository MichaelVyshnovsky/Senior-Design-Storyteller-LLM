The Cavern of the Everlasting was located beneath the fortress of Sarahin in the Haunted Lands.
The Cavern of the Everlasting was a natural cavern. The cavern housed five statues depicting heroes of the Everlasting. Tables and benches were used during meetings.
This location was often used when the holy slayers of the Everlasting wished to hold a meeting during the heat of the day. Located underground, this cool chamber was a comfortable solution.
Festivals or celebrations, usually as the result of the death of an enemy, were held here.
