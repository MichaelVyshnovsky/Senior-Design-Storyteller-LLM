The walls within the passage were decorated with relief sculptures depicting scenes of stone giant life giant families at play, scenes of their craftspeople toiling away, all surrounded by the beasts and critters of the natural world. 
The cliff walls were dotted doorways and windows, a number of which were obscured by trees growing within the canyon.
Thousand Faces was overrun by a collection of phaerimm-controlled beholders in the , and nearly all of its residents were slain or forced to flee.
