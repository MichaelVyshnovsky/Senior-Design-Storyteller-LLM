Porrenath, the Second City of the Sword, was one of the first major cities in the empire of Jhaamdath.
The Second City lay a short distance northeast of the First City, Naarkolyth, on the southern edge of the Orsraun Mountains. After its destruction, it lay in the Selmal Basin beneath the waters of the Vilhon Reach.
Porrenath was founded in , becoming the second of Jhaamdaths major cities.
A period of bloody imperial expansionism started in the , which resulted in the logging of the Chondalwood and the massacre of the Nikerymath elves. The elves responded in the  by performing a High Magic ritual that created a great wave from the Inner Sea that tore out of Jhaamdath Bay and washed over the Cities of the Sword, carving out the Vilhon Reach in the process. Porrenath remained a sunken ruin hidden in the Reach, with its many psionic artifacts slowly leaking into the water and affecting the surrounding environment.
The sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR, becoming the Vilhon Wilds. This was almost as quickly reversed in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering hiding the ruins once more.
