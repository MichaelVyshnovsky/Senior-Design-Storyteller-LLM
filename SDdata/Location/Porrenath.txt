'''Porrenath''', the Second City of the Sword, was one of the first major cities in the empire of [[Jhaamdath]].

==Geography==
The Second City lay a short distance northeast of the First City, [[Naarkolyth]], on the southern edge of the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. After its destruction, it lay in the [[Selmal Basin]] beneath the waters of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
Porrenath was founded in {{Yearlink|-5600}}, becoming the second of Jhaamdath's major cities.

A period of bloody imperial expansionism started in the {{YearlinkName|-276}}, which resulted in the logging of the [[Chondalwood]] and the massacre of the [[Nikerymath]] [[elves]]. The elves responded in the {{Yearlink|-255}} by performing a [[High Magic]] ritual that created a great wave from the [[Inner Sea]] that tore out of [[Jhaamdath Bay]] and washed over the Cities of the Sword, carving out the Vilhon Reach in the process. Porrenath remained a sunken ruin hidden in the Reach, with its many [[psionic]] artifacts slowly leaking into the water and affecting the surrounding environment.

The sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. This was almost as quickly reversed in [[1486 DR]] by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]] hiding the ruins once more.
