'''Myth Adofhaer''', formerly known as '''Adofhaeranede''', was a ''[[mythal]]''-cloaked [[sun elf]] city in the ancient realm of [[Siluvanede]] (founded c. {{Yearlink|-8400}}) in the [[High Forest]].

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-5300}}, Siluvanedenn elves established a ''mythal'' in the city, then known as Adofhaeranede, and renamed it to Myth Adofhaer.

Around {{Yearlink|-4300}}, at the end of the [[Seven Citadels' War]], [[Eaerlann]] annexed Siluvanede by force. Learning of the taint of the [[fey'ri]] houses, untainted Siluvanedenn [[Elven high mage|High Mages]] put the entire city of Myth Adofhaer and all its citizens into magical stasis in order to emerge in the far future, thus avoiding association with them. It was later reported that the Eaerlanni had sent Myth Adofhaer away from [[Faerûn]].

===Legacy===
Even by the 14{{th}} century, a number of old songs written in the [[Elven language]] told of the ''mythal''-cloaked Siluvanedenn city of Myth Adofhaer.

By [[1374 DR]], it was being rumored that an old book had recently been uncovered in a ruined Eaerlanni library, purportedly telling of Myth Adofhaer's exile and, more importantly, the conditions by which it might return. This information was of particular interest to the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], the organization that sought the removal of all [[human]]s from Faerûn. They hoped the sun elves would share their anger at the loss of elven might, and hunted for the book.

==Stasis==
The entire city and all its citizens were placed in magical stasis by the power of its ''mythal''. It was effectively removed from the world until certain conditions were met.
