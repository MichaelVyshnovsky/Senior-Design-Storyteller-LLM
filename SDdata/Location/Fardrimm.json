        "Geogrpahy": "Located in the [[Northdark]] portion of the Underdark, the Fardrimm was located near the [[drow]] cities of [[Ched Nasad]], [[Yathcol]],. The portion of the Fardrimm, called the [[Lowroad]],  connected the Northdark with the subterranean regions of Faer√ªn beneath the [[Anauroch]] desert,",
        "Geography": "*[[Lowroad]], the subterranean road that went eastward from [[Ascore]] to [[Netheril]]",
        "History": "During the [[Age of the Proud People]], this network of tunnels served as a secret link between the dwarfholds of the [[Northkingdom]]. Unfortunately, they were difficult to keep clear of Underdark wildlife and had been infested by the {{YearlinkName|-100}}.\n\nDuring the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], dwarves from the citadels of [[Citadel Adbar|Adbar]] and [[Citadel Felbarr|Felbarr]], along with those from [[Sundabar]] maintained patrols within their portions of Fardrimm. While most dwarves of these dwarfholds thought that clearing the tunnels was a futile effort, the optimistic merchant [[Rurik Silverhilt]] often hired adventurers to clear their passageways with the aim of bringing them into the sole ownership of the dwarves of the North. He saw the endeavor as extremely profitable, and by the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, had brought back a number of caravans full of trade goods from the Underdark."
