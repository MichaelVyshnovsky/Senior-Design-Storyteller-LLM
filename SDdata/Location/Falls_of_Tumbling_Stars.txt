The Falls of Tumbling Stars was a waterfall and hidden mountain valley in the Thunder Peaks north of Cormyr. It was believed sacred to Mielikki, the Lady of the Forest, and most significant site of the church of Mielikki in the late 14 century DR.
The falls stood on the Immerflow river just after its headwaters in the Twin Peaks of Urlspur. The Immerflow ran from north-east to south-west and cascaded down the mountainsides, where it met the long East Way linking Sembia and Cormyr before it continued into the Hullack Forest. The whole valley was concealed from the wider world and could only be reached via secret trails.
Within the vale were a number of holy pools. Anyone who was wounded and bathed in these would, by Mielikkis grace, be miraculously restored.
The vale was home to a small community of human and half-elf Walkers of the Forest Way, including highly skilled rangers and priests of Mielikki.
Circa 1370 DR, the Mielikkian community here was led jointly by Hawk of the Lady Neretheen Jalassan, a priestess, and by Hawk of the Lady Beldryn Stormstone, who was Lord Ranger.
The valley was well-defended against trespassers by Mielikkian rangers and archers, who all had lethal prowess with the bow.
The Mielikkians would escort their fellow faithful and injured people in need of healing to the vale via the secret trails. It was also a setting off point for high-ranking members of the church to make pilgrimages to the far-off Unicorns Run.
They were also the greatest enemies of the Bloodmoon Circle of Malarites based at the Wyvernstones of Hullack. In this, they were joined by members of the church of Eldath operating in the area.
