The '''Falls of Tumbling Stars''' was a waterfall and hidden mountain valley in the [[Thunder Peaks]] north of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|18}} It was believed sacred to [[Mielikki]], the Lady of the Forest, and most significant site of the [[church of Mielikki]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The falls stood on the [[Immerflow]] river just after its headwaters in the [[Twin Peaks of Urlspur]]. The Immerflow ran from north-east to south-west and cascaded down the mountainsides, where it met the long [[East Way]] linking [[Sembia]] and [[Cormyr]] before it continued into the [[Hullack Forest]]. The whole valley was concealed from the wider world and could only be reached via secret trails.

==Description==
Within the vale were a number of holy pools. Anyone who was wounded and bathed in these would, by Mielikki's grace, be miraculously restored.

==Inhabitants==
The vale was home to a small community of [[human]] and [[half-elf]] Walkers of the Forest Way, including highly skilled rangers and priests of Mielikki.

==Government==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], the Mielikkian community here was led jointly by Hawk of the Lady [[Neretheen Jalassan]], a priestess, and by Hawk of the Lady [[Beldryn Stormstone]], who was Lord Ranger.

==Defenses==
The valley was well-defended against trespassers by Mielikkian rangers and archers, who all had lethal prowess with the [[bow]].

==Activities==
The Mielikkians would escort their fellow faithful and injured people in need of healing to the vale via the secret trails. It was also a setting off point for high-ranking members of the church to make pilgrimages to the far-off [[Unicorn's Run]].

They were also the greatest enemies of the [[Bloodmoon Circle]] of [[Malarite]]s based at the [[Wyvernstones of Hullack]]. In this, they were joined by members of the [[church of Eldath]] operating in the area.
