        "Geography": "The village sat below the eastern Barren Mountains, southwest of the [[Bay of Ascore]].",
        "Trade": "Bandor's people mined rich veins of [[gold]] and [[silver]] from the [[Barren Mountains]], and traded it to nearby large settlements including the [[dwarves]] of [[Ascore]], the [[Netherese enclave|flying enclave]] of [[Sanctuary (enclave)|Sanctuary]], and the [[Rengarth]] of [[Vandal Station]]. The metals were then traded elsewhere in Netheril across the [[Narrow Sea]].",
        "History": "The village was founded in {{YearlinkConvert|1423|NY}}, and spent its whole existence as a mining community. It was a place where common miners could strike it rich, but they contended with constant cave-ins, underground monster attacks, and lethal fights with other miners. It came to a sudden end in {{YearlinkConvert|2328|NY}} when a lethal plague killed every member of the community and passed on to nearby Vandal Station, where it killed another 4,000 before burning out.\n\nIt was reported that the plague originated from an interaction with [[Aarakocra|winged humanoids]] who inhabited the [[Sanguine Mountain|nearby mountains]]."
