The '''Quivering Forest''' was a forest stretching from the foothills of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]] in the north to within {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} of [[Phlan]] in the south. It acted as a barrier to the great gray waste of [[Thar]] to the east. The Quivering Forest lay mainly on the east bank of the [[River Stojanow]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|53}}

==Geography==
The section of the Quivering Forest that stood within the [[Domains of Dread]] bordered [[Mount Baratok]]{{Cite adventurers league/The Darklord|8}} and had an ever-present mist that made it only dimly lit during the daytime. During the evening, it would become completely dark.
===Flora & Fauna===
[[Morcant Burl]], a purple-hued hardwood, grew only in the Quivering Forest.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|65}}{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|23}} Other plants found within this forest included [[safflower]]s,{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|24}} [[pine]] trees,{{Cite adventurers league/The Horseman|13}} and [[needle blight]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/The Ghost|14}}

Creatures known to inhabit the Quivering Forest included [[elk]]s, [[squirrel]]s,{{Cite adventurers league/Suits of the Mists|27-28}} [[owl]]s,{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|61}}  [[ettercap]]s,{{Cite adventurers league/The Ghost|7-8}} [[sparrow]]s, [[wild dog]]s, and [[wolves]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Ghost|10}}

==History==
The Quivering Forest was first planted as a copse of trees at the time Phlan was founded, c. [[367 DR]]. Due to its magical nature, it grew to a great forest in the span of a single [[human]] generation.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|81}}

In [[1306 DR]], the Quivering Forest was one of the areas within Phlan that suffered from burning during the event known as the [[Dragon Run]].

In [[1350 DR]], [[Ren o' the Blade]] traveled through the Quivering Forest on his way to the city of Phlan.<ref>

In [[1383 DR]],{{Cite adventurers league/The Ghost|7}} following the [[Zhentarim]]'s takeover of the [[Moonsea]] region,{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|5}} Lord [[Cvaal Daoran]] of Phlan made a pact with the dark [[fey]] of the Quivering Forest, promising not to log or travel in the forest in exchange for their aid. the fey protected Phlan from similar destruction.

In [[1456 DR]], his foolhardy son Lord [[Talaric Daoran]] violated the pact by sending loggers into the Quivering Forest. Unknown to the people of Phlan, he had been killed by the [[green hag]] [[Jeny Greenteeth]], a powerful [[unseelie fey]] that had a part in the original pact.

In [[1489 DR]], a [[wild elf]] [[ranger]] named [[Surruk]] spent two weeks patrolling the forest with a bow made of Morcant burl, making sure none of the more malevolent [[fey]] bothered anyone.{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|6}}

In the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], parts of the Quivering Forest were pulled along with a large section of the lands surrounding Phlan into the Domain of Dread known as [[Barovia]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Beast|8-9}}{{Cite adventurers league/The Seer|8}}

Following its pull into Barovia, the [[Dark Powers]] of the Domains of Dread empowered Jeny Greenteeth and raised Talaric Daoran as a [[ghost]] to haunt her.{{Cite adventurers league/The Ghost|16}} Later on through the use of [[divination]], Jeny was able to determine that whatever brought the Quivering Forest into Barovia was not the doing of [[Strahd von Zarovich]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Darklord|12}}

Other changes that occurred within the forest included many animals becoming larger and more threatening.{{Cite adventurers league/The Ghost|12}} The wild dogs and wolves of the forest became agents of Greenteeth, reporting the presence of any strangers to her. Many of the forest's wild elves became hostile towards others or lost their minds to madness.

Eventually, monsters from Barovia began to spill out into the Prime Material section of the Quivering Forest where the veil between the worlds was thin. These creatures included [[ghoul]]s, [[invisible stalker]]s, [[spectre]]s, [[werewolves]], [[wight]]s, [[wraith]]s, and [[vampire spawn]].{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|62}} [[Buhrell Caah]], a [[half-orc]] scout of the [[Emerald Enclave]], tried to lead a group of [[adventurer]]s into the forest to petition its wild elf inhabitants for aid, but they disappeared into the mist.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|69-70}} He then stumbled across the village of [[Thornbud]], whose inhabitants dubbed the supernatural mists the "breath of the dragon" and wrongly blamed them as the result of the [[green dragon]] [[Vorgansharax]] polluting the forest with [[magic]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Greenhall]], a wild elf encampment.
* [[Thornbud]], a village of [[pixie]]s kept hidden by toadstools. Was located in the section of forest that had not been taken into Barovia.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|70}}

==Rumors & Legends==
There were many stories surrounding the fey of this forest, such as farmers being punished for not leaving an offering from the year's first harvest or unruly children being taken away.
