        "Inhabitants": "Its waters supported a thriving eel harvest where fishermen navigated in flat-bottomed skiffs. The swamp teemed with [[giant leech|giant leeches]], snails, and other unsavory creatures. Amidst the murky depths, a few resilient religious recluses have found solace, though pinpointing their exact whereabouts proved challenging.",
        "History": "Shibinuma was formed after an earthquake-induced shift in the course of the Jito River circa {{yearlinkConvert|1381|KY}}."
