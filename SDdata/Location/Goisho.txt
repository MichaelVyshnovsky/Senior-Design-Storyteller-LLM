'''Goisho''' was a town in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. It lay at the edge of the foothills of the [[Vorkani Mountains]], beside the [[Quang Muku Forest]], on the [[Hoparatu River]].

For many years, the [[Hu'i Wing]], a massive magical brazier that revealed the future and was one of the most valued relics of Koryo, was the centerpiece of a shrine near Goisho. It was tended to by the [[Wing-ta]] order of [[monk]]s. However, some ten generations before [[1357 DR]], [[Kozakura]]n forces stole the Hu'i Wing and carried it off to [[Karak]], and they built it into their fortress there.
