        "mainbody": "The Valley of Dog-Men was nestled deep within the Kun-Yen Shan mountain range in the Hordelands.\nA large colony of gnolls claimed this valley. The gnolls were originally summoned to serve a powerful wizard, but stayed around and thrived after the wizards death. As of 1359 DR their numbers hovered around 400.\nTheir presence in the isolated valley gave rise to many legends about savage dog-faced men who abducted beautiful women.\nA group of the gnolls clashed with inhabitants of the Valley of Exiles while they were out exploring for new territory."
