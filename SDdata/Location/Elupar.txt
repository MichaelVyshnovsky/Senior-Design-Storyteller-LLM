'''Elupar''' was a small fishing village in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Geography==
It lay on the eastern shore of the [[Deepwash]] at the foot of the [[Cloven Mountains]].<ref><ref> It was the closest settlement to the settlement of [[Lachom]].

==Government==
In the mid-to-late 1300s DR, Elupar did not have an official leader nor government, only an loose band of fisherman, though they did employ a sheriff to keep the peace. However, the position often remained empty as the village was a sleepy little place and offered little excitement.

==Trade==
Being nearby the [[lizardfolk]] city of [[Surkh]], the good folk of Elupar were afraid of their scaly neighbors. Even though this wariness was irrational and fueled by nothing but stories, Elupar stayed out of Surkh's business.

==Culture==
Like other city-states of the Vilhon Reach, Elupar celebrated the festival of the [[Rotting Dance]] with a wild, joyful celebration. The festival celebrated the city-states' independence from [[Chondath]]. Even though the exact date of the liberation was unknown, the Rotting Dance took place every year on [[Higharvestide]].

==Defenses==
Elupar did not have a militia.

==History==
From [[900 DR]] through [[902 DR]], the Chondathan civil war later named the [[Rotting War]] consumed the nation. The grand finale of the conflict was the creation of a magical and extremely deadly plague that decimated Chondathan armies. The survivors took the plague home, spreading death. The devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured [[Arrabar]]'s loss of influence. All the cities of Chondath, apart from [[Iljak]], declared independence, becoming city-states. Even though Elupar was just a small fishing village at the time, it gained independence nevertheless.

In the {{YearlinkName|1184}}, a thief stole a holy [[spellbook]] of [[Mielikki]]—''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''—from the ranger [[Rhighaermon O'Antlers]] and sold it to Lord Lathamp of Elupar. Rhighaermon, along with a half-dozen devotees of the Forest Queen, raided Lathamp's palace to steal it back. The [[book]] was seized from the vaults amidst a fierce battle against the noble's Eluphan guards.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* Lord [[Lathamp]], a 12{{th}}-century noble based in Elupar
* [[Tammarast Tengloves]], the [[Bard]] of Elupar and the author of ''[[The Strings of a Shattered Lyre]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|1342}}.{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|5}}
