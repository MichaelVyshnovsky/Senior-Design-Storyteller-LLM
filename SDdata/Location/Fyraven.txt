'''Fyraven''' was the oldest human-settled area of [[Tethyr]].

==Geography==
Fyraven was a county of [[Cape Velen]]. It occupied the central stretch of the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]], between counties [[Firedrake (county)|Firedrake]] and [[Greenshores]].

==Government==
In [[1370 DR]], the county was ruled by the young [[Tanar Keelson]], who was only fifteen-years-old at the time. His county seat was at [[Monguldarath]], a haunted estate.

==Notable Locations==
The town of [[Tulmene]] was the only settlement of significant size in the county.

==History==
The majority of the original twelve clans of Tethyr originated from this small region. Indeed, their burial sites could still be found throughout the county. Most recognizable were the toroid burial mounds of [[Clan Fyrson]].
