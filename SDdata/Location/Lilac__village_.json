        "mainbody": "'''Lilac''' was the home of [[lacerial]]s who resided in the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]]. The name was inspired by the [[lilac]] scent lacerials emitted when feeling longing for home.{{Cite living jungle/Inhabitants of the Jungle|13}}",
        "Description": "Lilac was a busy village, well-hidden by the jungle vegetation. The village population included all four species of lacerials: finheads, bladebacks, hornheads, and flyers, who lived along with a smaller population of [[yuan-ti]]. These snake folk considered lacerials their \"cousins\" and showed them and their peaceful way great respect. In general, Lilac's doors were closed to outsiders. However, the village was always ready to answer pleas for help from goodly creatures.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin|8}}\n\nMost structures of Lilac were simple huts of various sizes. Each of the species of lacerials preferred slightly different homes. Fliers liked to nest in open-sided homes elevated from {{SI|6'|'\"|long=yes}} to {{SI|25'|'\"|long=yes}} above ground. Fliers liked to build light shelters as they felt uncomfortable with heavy construction above their heads. Oftentimes their homes were in dire need of repair after every storm. Bladebacks and finheads resided in the most traditional huts, usually consisting of a single huge room with decorated walls. The biggest huts usually belonged to hornheads as they were the biggest of their kind. Their homes tended to have one wall missing and often had gated backyards around their abodes.",
        "Geography": "Lilac stood on the downriver shores of the [[River of Laughing Idols]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/The Courage of a Coward|2}}",
        "Government": "Lilac was ruled by the council of the village elders.",
        "Trade": "Lacerials of Lilac faced a fair share of xenophobia from their neighboring community of [[Rudra]]. On the other side of the political spectrum were the yuan-ti of Malatra, with whom Lilac engaged in mutually beneficial trade. If aggression with Rudra reached the boiling point, yuan-ti were sure to aid lacerials. Along with the yuan-ti, Lilac traded with [[hyena katanga]] folk.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin|2}}",
        "Culture": "Every night, the entire population of Lilac participated in the ritual known as the ''[[Moment of Remembrance]]''. Lacerials lowered themselves on one knee with hands over their hearts and prayed to the southern sky. This ritual filled the air of Lilac with scents of [[rose]]s, lilacs, and ozone - these smells signified sadness, longing for home, and despair in [[saurial language|Lacerial scent language]]. The ''Moment of Remembrance'' was the ritual of grieving for lacerials' lost homeworld.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin|9}}",
        "History": "The conflict with the village of Rudra that took place in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] was caused by the lacerials of Lilac \"tearing out\" [[vanilla]] plants from the grove that held significance in the eyes of both towns of Lilac and Rudra. In reality, lacerials carefully and lovingly transplanted two dozens of vanilla plants.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin|5}} Lacerials were in decline and produced no eggs after their arrival to Malatra, and they were hoping to use vanilla plants as a part of a powerful fertility spell to stop their race from eventual extinction. As another way of resolving the stranding in the alien world, lacerials searched for a way to repair an [[oscray]] skyship - a ''[[spelljammer]]''.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Fisster]], the Third Servant of the Snake-Mother, a yuan-ti guadian of Lilac ''circa'' the 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Quickwing]], the flyer elder of Lilac.\n*[[Starr]], the bladeback warrior elder of Lilac.\n*[[Strongarm]], the Guardian of the Lacerial, a finhead who kept his town free ''circa'' the 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Trueblood]], the hornhead [[wizard]] elder of Lilac."
