The '''House Fajirik Military Camp''' was a relatively permanent outpost of [[House Fajirik]], located west of the [[Jamal Oasis]] in the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]].

==Inhabitants==
Soldiers stationed here were often bored, which many traders took advantage of by bringing goods and services for them to spend their money on. Captain [[Ramad bin Yusif al-Kahn]] kept men on watch constantly along the southern border of a barren weed field called a ''qara'a''.  During peacetime, these soldiers had nothing to do except stare out into the vast emptiness of the desert and wait for any movement from the soldiers of [[House Ashurim]], which was located on the other side of the ''qara'a''.  This waiting game had lasted up to 200 years by [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

Funding for these soldiers was rumored to come from [[Tajar]] for House Fajirik, and [[Qudra]] for House Ashurim.
