Within that courtyard was the towns well, which gave Kanaglyms dwarven residents more than they bargained for.\nKanaglym was located entirely underground, beneath the High Moor, directly underneath Dragonspear Castle. It was accessible by a cave network that lay beneath the castle, through which flowed the Nepenthe River. The river passage was one notable means to gain access to the ruined dwarven city.\nAs of the Era of Upheaval, the entrance to Kanaglym was protected by the ghost of the dragon Halatathlaer, former companion and mount of Daeros Dragonspear, founder of Dragonspear Castle.\nCirca the mid–6 century DR, the Duchy of Hunnabar existed on the surface lands above Kanaglym.\nKanaglym was founded in the , when the High Moor was warm and fertile.

There she encountered the specter of Kae Deverell, whose body briefly housed the avatar of the god Bhaal. While in the ruined town, Midnight traveled through a shimmering portal into the White Plain.\nA decade later, in the , a necromancer by the name of Kherriun set up operations within the ruins of Kanaglym. He began to raise an army of undead slaves, to aid the efforts of his ally Hephernaan, a servant of the fiend Belhifet. Kherriun had acquired an amulet that allowed him control over Kanaglyms guardian, Halatathlear.\nThat same year, the wild mage Neera made a pilgrimage to Kanaglym to speak with the spirit of her deceased mentor Adoy.\n* Zhadroth, a lich whose physical form remained trapped in Kanaglym, whose imprisonment was presided over by the Endless Watcher.\nThe town was the site of the Fountain of Nepenthe, a watery portal that allowed travel between the Prime Material and the Fugue Plane."
