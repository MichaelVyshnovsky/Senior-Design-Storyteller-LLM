        "mainbody": "laurachyndaar (formerly Myth Glaurach, the City of Scrolls) was a ruined Eaerlanni city situated on the river Starsilver, a tributary of the river Delimbiyr, in the Nether Mountains. It was a garden city with ornate buildings and white domes, built on the ruins of an Aryvandaaran city.\nMyth Glaurach was built on top of the pre-existing ruins of an Aryvandaaran city whose name is presumed to be lost. The city was raided by orcs in 864 DR and sacked. Sarya Dlardrageth found the mythal stone of the city buried in a deep pit to protect it from attackers, and she used the magic of the stone to summon demons that could remain permanently in Faerûn. Araevin Teshurr subsequently restored the mythal and altered it in such a way that it can now withstand fiendish intervention. The daemonfey army fled the ruins in the same year they arrived after losing a battle to an elven army from Evermeet outside of Evereska. The leader of the elvish army, Seiveril Miritar left a contingent of elves to guard the ruins after Sarya left.\nThere were a number of portals beneath the grand mages palace.\nA shrine dedicated to Labelas Enoreth – the Star Mausoleum, could be found in Myth Glaurach before the citys fall. The site of worship was visited by Labelass avatar on at least one occasion, where he created the Girdle of Labelas, a holy item later worn by the gods High Priests.\nIn its original state, the mythal barred all fiends and anyone who had ever eaten the flesh of elves, dwarves or humans, but this was destroyed by Sarya Dlardrageth and remains so. Other aspects of the mythal continued to function. It was not possible to cast acid, conjuration, death, evil, or fire spells within the mythal, and spells that calm animals and prevent weed growth were active."
