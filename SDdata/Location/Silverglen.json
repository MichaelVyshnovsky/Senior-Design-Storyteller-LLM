        "mainbody": "ilverglen was a grove and temple in the city of Silverymoon dedicated to the deity Silvanus in the midâ€“14 century DR. It was often used for worship services by priestesses of Lurue.\nThe Temple of Silver Stars was located in the eastern part of the Northbank section of Silverymoon. It was south of the Halls of Inspiration and many of the citys other temples, west of the High Palace, and east of the citys Market. Along its eastern boundary was the Harper Hall.\nThis grove had the look of a well-maintained park, with carefully tended trees.\nCirca 1358 DR, the druid known as Willa OGreensleeves inhabited the grove.\nBy 1367 DR, there was a rumor that a network of passageways existed beneath the grove that connected Harper Hall to various buildings across the city, including the Dancing Goat tavern, the Map House, and the Vault of the Sages. Nearly every copse of trees in Silverymoon was the subject of sightings of the avatar of the Unicorn Queen, including those in Silverglen."
