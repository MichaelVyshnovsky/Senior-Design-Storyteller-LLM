        "mainbody": "The Beggars Nest was one of the districts of Neverwinter in the 14 century DR.\nThe Beggars Nest comprised the southeast quadrant of the city. It was named for the districts inhabitants, the poorest of Neverwinter. \nDuring the citys struggle with the Wailing Death in 1372 DR, the Beggars Nest was the most afflicted, as the plague first appeared there. The district was soon overrun by undead, as many of the inhabitants of the district died to the plague and a yuan-ti named Gulnan took advantage of the chaos to raise an army of undead. Eventually, the Hero of Neverwinter defeated the yuan-ti, disrupting her necromantic rituals and putting an end to the undead nightmare.\nWhen Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the Beggars Nest was completely destroyed by the earthquakes that followed the cataclysm. A huge, canyon-like chasm replaced most of the district.\n* Neverwinter Academy\n* The Shining Serpent Inn"
