'''Mafrad''' was a small town found along the banks of the mighty [[Nogaro River]] within the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region of [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
Mafrad was located inland approximately {{SI|60|mi|k}} due west of [[Rog'osto]] along the coast of [[Bahr al-Ajami]]. The town sat at the end of a cleared trail that connected the Nogaro with an unnamed river to the east. The trail made travel through the jungles relatively easy.
