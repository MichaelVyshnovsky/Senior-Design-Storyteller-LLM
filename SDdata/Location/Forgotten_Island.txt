The '''Forgotten Island''' was a small uninhabited island in the [[Shining Sea]], far to the south of [[Calimshan]] and off the coast of [[Chult]].

==Description==
===Geographical Features===
In the center of the island was a large volcano.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|3}} It was long dormant by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|11}} not overly steep, and its summit could be climbed up to in around six hours.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|12}}

A number of caverns existed beneath the surface of the island.

===Flora & Fauna===
This island was host to a variety of ancient tropical plants and [[dinosaur]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|5}} [[triceratops]]es, [[iguanodon]]s, [[tyrannosaurus rex]]es, [[velociraptor]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|9-10}} and [[stegosaurus]]es.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|16}} Beyond dinosaurs, the island was host to some [[monkey]]s and tropical [[bird]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|21}} a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists exploring the Realms under the leadership of the charismatic [[Waukeenar]] [[Devlin (Ravens Bluff)|Devlin]]{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|4}} They went on to locate an ancient [[Sunite]] relic called ''The [[Sacred Heart of the Beast]]'', which was said to have the power to bend any animal to its will. With the relic in-hand they began trying to colonize the island sometime around the month of [[Flamerule]], hoping to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract wealthy people from all across the Realms.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}}

A [[mage]] among the group by the name of [[Briella Farthing]] would create a ''[[portal|gate]]'' between the nearby Shining Sea and the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]], hoping to later bring money and nobles from her homeland in [[the Vast]] to the endeavor.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|13}}

A [[Hierophant]] [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] by the name of [[Baerwald]] caught wind of the group's plans and sailed to the island in hopes of dissuading them from it, thereby saving the balance of nature. Rebuffed by Devlin, the druid went on to concoct his own plan for getting rid of the expedition, beginning with accelerating the growth of a strong colony of [[olive slime]]s in caverns beneath the island.

In the direction of Briella's portal the expedition team constructed a dock.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|5}} They then went on to construct further into the jungle a [[Devlin's campsite|campsite]] for their operations.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|6-7}} And eventually, they managed to convince a petty noble from [[Calimport]], a Prince [[Faruq]], to visit them under the notion of being a potential investor.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20}} Meanwhile, Baerwald toiled away on his own plan, using his druidic [[divine magic|magic]] to carve out a smooth, perfectly straight concave channel down the side of the volcano and into a tunnel he dug down into the caverns below the island.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|11}} And without any intervening on the druid's part, the olive slimes came to infect several dinosaurs on the island, turning them into [[slime creature]]s and thus breaking the ''Sacred Heart's'' control over them.

On [[Marpenoth 1]], Baerwald caused a tree to fall upon the camp's outbuilding, destroying Briella's magical [[mirror]] she was using for two-way communication with the outside world. The druid showed up two days later, hoping this loss would make them listen to reason and when it did not he threatened them with dire consequences if they did not leave. On [[Marpenoth 5]], two members of the group by the names of [[Argus]] and [[Wedonai]] were patrolling the island and came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a stegosaurus. Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered [[spirit|forest spirit]]s, whilst Argus would tell Devlin that the creature's wounds suggested an attack from another dinosaur, an occurrence that shouldn't be possible while the ''Sacred Heart of the Beast'' was active.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|19}} Instead of letting the issue trouble his mind, Devlin spent much of the day instructing their cook [[Periscot]] in the kitchen, since Prince Faruq had a very particular palate and he wanted to ensure their potential investor had a most pleasurable visit.

On [[Marpenoth 11]], five slime infected velociraptors attacked the expedition site's messhall.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20-21}} The group managed to kill the raptors, but the building was left in ruins, Argus died from the attack, and a [[fighter]] by the name of [[Mallus]] was left both wounded and unknowingly infected by the olive slimes. The next day Briella left with Wedonai and the [[half-elf]] scout [[Jarkus]] to check on the ''Sacred Heart of the Beast''. The day following that, the island was hit by powerful monsoon winds and thunderstorms. Storms continued to hit the island on [[Marpenoth 14]].

By [[Marpenoth 15]], the trio reached the summit of the volcano and encountered Baerwald. He engaged them in a conversation about how their group was threatening the balance of nature on the island. Things took a violent turn and Baerwald subdued both Jarkus and Wedonai, condemning them to the olive slive caverns, then took Briella to a [[plane of existence]] known as the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] in hopes to convince her that the island shouldn't be mistreated by humans and demihumans.

The two spellcasters would be absent from the [[Prime Material]] for five days,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|22}} On [[Marpenoth 16]], the group left the campsite to discover their dock and two [[caravel]]s had both been destroyed, likely by aquatic dinosaurs infected by the olive slimes,<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|6}} leaving them stranded on the island. Everyone was dejected over this, though Mallus remained strangely calm. By [[Marpenoth 19]], a thoroughly dejected Devlin goes about murdering his crew under the cover of night. He then burned as much of the complex as he could before hanging himself the next day. When the two spellcasters finally returned to the Prime Material on [[Marpenoth 21]], Briella was thoroughly convinced she had upset the balance of nature and needed to set things right.

Briella's father, [[Maskin Farthing]] of [[Farthing Custom & Trade]], grew concerned from having not heard from his daughter through her mirror in two weeks and so hired a group of [[adventurer]]s to travel to the island and rescue her. Unbeknownst to the adventurers, Maskin also hoped to capture and bring back some creatures on the island, as several unscrupulous merchants had offered him hefty sums for a pair of dinosaurs.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|4-5}} In under a day of travel they reached the Forgotten Island on [[Marpenoth 22]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|4-5}}

The adventurers went about thoroughly investigating the ruined campsite, potentially even speaking with Devlin through use of a ''[[speak with dead]]'' spell, trying to discern what had transpired on the island.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|6-8}} They would then be attacked by several dinosaurs that were either infected by the olive slimes or fully metamorphosed by them into slime creatures,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|9-10}} potentially getting infected by them.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|23}} Eventually the adventurers made their way up to the summit of the volcano, passing the corpses of Jarkus and Wedonai along the way, who had long since metamorphosed into slime creatures. At the summit they found Briella manipulating strings of raw magic around the ''Sacred Heart'', Baerwald standing next to her, and six [[magma para-elemental]]s walking in a choreographed circle around her about {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} out from her.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|11-12}}

The adventurers approached the two in some manner, needing to keep a distance due to orders given by the para-elementals to maintain a perimeter. Baerwald remained tight-lipped, overwhelmingly paranoid that his plans might be interrupted, whilst Briella was affable and open to explaining the situation. She explained to them the powerful magics surrounding the ''Sacred Heart'' and expressed her feelings of responsibility. They also learn that Baerwald's plan was as follows - when the ''Sacred Heart's'' removal caused the volcano to erupt, the resulting lava would flow directly down his concave channel and into the island's caverns, thereby killing most of the olive slime colony and, by his estimate, arguably restoring the balance of nature on the island.

How the adventurers resolved the situation, as well as whether or not they made it back to Ravens Bluff, was unknown.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|15-16}}<ref group=note>The adventure module ''A Land Remembered'' provides a multitude of possible ways in which the situation on the volcano could be resolved, making it impossible to narrow down one as the true ending:<br/>(1) The adventurers could simply allow Briella to sacrifice herself.<br/>(2) They could find a way to [[dispel magic|dispel the magic]] on the ''Sacred Heart'', which would cause the volcano to erupt.<br/>(3) One of the adventurers could choose to sacrifice themselves, resulting in the volcano's eruption and the adventurer being ''[[reincarnate]]d'' by Baerwald into a [[human]].<br/>(4) A corpse could be made to remove the relic, through such spells as ''[[animate dead]]'', resulting in the volcano's eruption.<br/>(5) The adventurers could try to [[polymorph]] an animal into a human or demihuman and have them remove the relic, resulting in the volcano's eruption.<br/>(6) Or the adventurers could use the hands of a corpse to remove the relic, puppeted by ''[[telekinesis]]'', or use a magic destroying item like the ''[[coryinshard]]''. But while the adventurers were away, the crew of the ''Mare's Milk'' went about and captured a pair of mated stegosauruses, corralling them below deck of the caravel.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|16}}
