        "mainbody": "Throden was a village located in the heart of Forestfall Fen as of the late 15 century DR. It was populated by lizardfolk of a tribe of the same name as well as by their kobold allies of the Queenstooth tribe. The entire village was ruled over by a black dragon known as \"Queen\" Vorazidrar.\nOriginally a lizardfolk settlement, the older and more central parts of the village were far larger than a first glance would suggest. The newer outskirts showed signs of kobold construction, and was designed for the benefit of both lizardfolk and kobolds.\nAll roads in Throden eventually led to Vorazidrars lair, a stone cave located in the deepest swamp waters.\nWhile the lizardfolk were led by Othokent and the Queenstooth kobolds had leaders such as Spittleburn, both groups acknowledged Vorazidrar as their \"Queen\" as of the late 15 century DR.\nThe village was under constant threat from both the growth of the swamp and the predations of the other inhabitants, such as the Muckgrunter trolls, the holdfast vines, various local monsters, and meenlocks from the Feywild. Keeping the area safe required the coordinated effort of both the kobolds&mdashwho ventured into the swamp and formed a perimeter to keep invaders away from the village&mdashand the lizardfolk&mdashwho defended the village proper and provided reinforcements to the kobolds as needed. Lizardfolk patrols also kept and eye on visitors and occasionally lured them into traps. These patrols could navigate the dangerous swamp with ease, and were only encountered if they wished to be.\nThroden as a lizardfolk settlement was quite old. The kobolds arrived alongside Vorazidrar sometime before the 15 century DR, at which point the village became home to both groups after the kobolds sought them out for greater protection. Despite the constant conflict within Forestfall Fen, Vorazidrar kept the village nominally safe, such as by killing Wrathburn, an adventurer from the North.\nVorazidrars reign ended in the late 15 century DR when a party of adventurers trapped her in her lair on the orders of the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand. The lizardfolk were not upset to see her deposed.\nThe lizardfolk of Throden were emotionless and calculating, and were neither afraid of nor offended by strangers in their settlement. Unlike the kobolds, who mocked those they fought, the lizardfolk merely observed without judgment and took no delight in victory. Also unlike the kobolds, the lizardfolk disliked the conflict that the Queens presence had brought, and were not particularly loyal to her except out of practicality. They offered her \"gifts\" of tribute in exchange for gifts of protection.\n* Othokent, leader of the Throden lizardfolk in the late 15 century DR.\n* Spittleburn, a leader among the Queenstooth kobolds in the late 15 century DR."
