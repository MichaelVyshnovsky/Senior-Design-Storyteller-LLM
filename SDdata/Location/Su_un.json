        "Description": "It was a desert island, a bleak place of sand and jagged rocks with constant wind.",
        "History": "Seeking a suitable locale for his hermitage, the [[shukenja]] and holy man [[Chiquong]] had journeyed to the southern tip of Saishu, but had still found nothing to his liking. So instead he raised the island of Su'un from the depths of the sea. There he dwelled, with the wind his only companion.\n\nThe shukenja [[Pitalla]] was believed to have later visited Su'un and left the ''[[leaping fish]]'' there.",
        "Legends": "Rumors told that Chiquong still lived on Su'un by [[1350 DR]], and that he could predict the future and hid great riches."
