'''Pumpside''' was a neighborhood in the [[Ravens Bluff/Southside District|Southside]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]], located across the [[Fire River]], south of [[Ravens Bluff/The Shutters|The Shutters]] and east of the [[Tlasbras Neighborhood]].

==Description==
The neighborhood of Pumpside was a startling contrast of poverty and wealth that laid in the shadow of the [[House of War]]'s high walls. Most of the building south of [[Stonekeep End]] were rundown rooming houses protruding from the wood bordering the neighborhood.

==Geography==
Pumpside was a square neighborhood of around fifteen city blocks. To the east, Pumpside's border was [[Mraedara's Street]], to the west – [[Zeldazar Street]], [[Hammerstone Street]] – north, and Stonekeep End – south. [[Stonekeep Concourse]], [[Burning Shield Lane]], [[Landleen Lane]], and [[Helhavryn's Walk]], all ran parallel to Zeldazar Street and Mraedara's Street. In turn, [[Conant Court]] and [[Kalikoolan Lane]] were laid perpendicular to them. [[Samarglast Lane]] cut the neighborhood diagonally, from where Stonekeep Concourse crossed with Hammerstone Street and ended at a moot with Stonekeep End and Zeldazar Street.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Brothers Galgolar Pawnshop]], south of the crossing of Hammerstone Street and Stonekeep Concourse, run by [[Jeffers Galgolar]] and [[Malachi Galgolar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[Cliff's Bard & Swill]] on Stonekeep End and Landleen Lane, a late night drinking establishment and a festhall that became popular in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[House of War]], a temple complex dedicated to [[Tempus]] that occupied a quarter of the neighborhood.
*[[House of Whelk]], a busy Merchant House on Helhavryn's Walk and Samarglast Lane, that produced [[fish]] pastes and [[fishing net]]s.
*[[Magestrand Manor]], a manse on Zeldazar Street and Samarglast Lane, home to [[Oracle (Ravens Bluff)|Oracle]], a one time Minister of Divination of Ravens Bluff.
*[[Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility]] that replaced a smelly junkyard on Zeldazar Street and the western end of Hammerstone Street.

==History==
It was forgotten, why the neighborhood was called Pumpside. However, most historians thought that the name originated from a [[horse]]-powered water pump used to irrigate the fields that once grew where the Pumpside neighborhood would eventually grow.

In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, after the conclusion of the war against [[Myrkyssa Jelan]], a family man carpenter was discovered to had served under the Warlord's banner during the war. Despite being a law-abiding citizen since the war's end, he was lynched in Pumpside.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] officers were investigated over bribery and racketeering.
