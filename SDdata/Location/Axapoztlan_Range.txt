The Axapoztlan Range was the mountain range that separated Kultaka, and later the Borderlands, from the desert Sands of Itzcala in Maztica.
The Axapoztlan Range stood to the west from the arable Kultakan land and the savannah later claimed by the Borderlands, the territory of New Waterdeep. The range protected the coastal region from the hot Sands of Itzcala that occupied the majority of the lands beyond.
In the , the event known as Rockfire took place underneath the Trackless Sea, seemingly severing the Underdark connection between the continents of Maztica and Faer√ªn. Following Rockfire, dwarves emerged in the Sands of Itzcala, eventually becoming known as desert dwarves of Maztica, and the drow emerged from the Underdark entrance on the Axapoztlan Range only to eventually become known as the Ancient Ones.
