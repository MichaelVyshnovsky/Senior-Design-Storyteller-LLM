{{otheruses4|the geographic north of Faerûn|the region known as The North|The North}}
The region of '''North Faerûn''' stretched from the frigid [[High Ice]] and the [[Anauroch]] desert in the north, south along the shores of the inland [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]] in the northern region of [[Faerûn]]. It was a region of contrasting landscapes, including the lush forests of the [[Dalelands]], the desolate sands of the Anauroch, the coastal cities of the [[Moonsea]] and [[Moonsea North]] regions, and the bitter colds lands of the [[the Ride]].

==Regions==
===Anauroch===
{{Main|Anauroch}}
The desert was once a rich, flourishing land claimed by the ancient [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]]. After a terrible war marked by an ever-increasing magical arms race, the region was drained of all life and transformed into a desolate wasteland. This desert swallowed the human empires and [[Lost Kingdoms|survivor-states]] of this region, remaining sparsely populated by scattered [[Bedine|desert tribes]] for centuries. The Netherese Empire reemerged in [[Faerûn]] during the 15{{th}} century – following the arrival of the [[Thultanthar]] [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] from the [[Shadowfell]] – but once again collapsed as it had millennia prior.

===Eastern Heartlands===
{{Main|Eastern Heartlands}}
With the exception of the [[Cormanthor]] forest,
* [[Cormanthor]]: This magnificent and ancient forest was once home to [[Cormanthyr]], a great empires of the [[elven]] people, along with its famed capital of [[Myth Drannor]], a city that served as a beacon of culture, art, and magic for the united peoples of the Realms.
* [[Dalelands]]: The forested region southwest of the Moonsea was divided into a number of sparsely-populated dales; independent and self-sufficient states of small cities, rural towns, and rustic farmsteads, united under the leadership of the [[Dales Council]].
* [[Moonsea]]: The lands around the Moonsea lake held a number of conflicting city-states that just as readily banded together for great power as they did engage in all-out war with one another. The most notable of these were [[Melvaunt]] and [[Phlan]] in the north, the former power of [[Zhentil Keep]] in the west, [[Hillsfar]] in the southwest, and [[Mulmaster]] on the southern shore.

===Moonsea North===
{{Main|Moonsea North}}
The wild lands north of Moonsea Lake were seen far and wide as largely inhospitable, with a wealth of natural resources that attracted those willing enough to seize them.
* [[The Ride]]: The cold steppes of the Moonsea North housed tribes of fierce, mounted barbarians that were often drawn into conflicts with the region's "civilized" cities,{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|50}}
* [[Thar]]: The great grey moors of Thar were home to bands of savage [[orc]]s, and in its ancient past, one of the greatest [[ogre]] kingdoms in all the Realms. The land languished for many years however, becoming an inhospitable waste that served as little more than a series of paths through which Moonsea caravans could pass. 
* [[Tortured Land]]: A barren and unrelenting stretch of volcanic landscape that did not serve as home to only a sparse population. Monstrous creatures of fantastic and unique appearance could be found within the desolate lands also known as the "land-in-suffering".{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|62}}

This region along the eastern shore of the [[Dragon Reach]] was a temperate land of rolling farmlands, marked by the rugged peaks of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] and the forests along the eastern border with [[Impiltur]]. which rose to prominence in the region throughout the 15{{th}} century DR.
