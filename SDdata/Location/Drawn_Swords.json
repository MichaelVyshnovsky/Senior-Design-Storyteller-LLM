        "mainbody": "'''Drawn Swords''' was an isolated village found in the [[Backlands]] of the [[Western Heartlands]]. The settlement was named for the vigilance and mind for defense that was demanded of all of its residents, thanks to the assaults it suffered on regular basis.",
        "Description": "The village sat atop a single rocky hill that overlooked the surrounding landscape. Rows of cottages were built in rings along the sides of the hill ascended upward towards a small copse of trees that surrounded the tower of [[Swordskeep]].",
        "Geography": "Drawn Swords was located east of the [[Reaching Woods]], approximately equidistant between [[Hill's Edge]] along the [[River Reaching]] to the south, and the [[Hill of Lost Souls]] to the north; and northwest of [[Skull Gorge]].\n\nBetween the village and Skull Gorge was a monument created by local [[mountain giant]]s called [[Fallen Giant Tomb]].",
        "Trade": "All manner of exotic goods came through Drawn Swords, which was surprisingly given its distance from any major trade roads or nearby settlements.",
        "Defenses": "At least half the villagers of Drawn Swords were well-trained in archery, and used the town's elevated to aid in its defense. They hung [[quiver]]s of arrows just inside the doors of many buildings, and trained in firing volleys together as they worked their way towards Swordskeep tower for greater advantage.",
        "History": "Throughout history a number of battles have been fought on the hill atop which Drawn Swords was built. It was constantly being attacked by outsiders,\n\nAs of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], worshipers of [[Sune]] would regularly make offerings to their goddess in town, accompanied by the [[Stag Warriors]] of the nearby [[Flame Grove]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that the town was protected by the group known as the [[Harpers]] and that one of their members owned its resident [[Sword and Dragon]] inn. Stories tell that the Harpers took interest in Drawn Swords and constructed the inn within Swordskeep tower to hide and protect a ''[[portal]]'' that linked it with the city of [[Berdusk]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Swordskeep]], a ruined tower that provided protection to the town's residents.\n* [[Sword and Dragon]], a pleasant-enough establishment that was always packed with adventurers and owned by some mysterious [[Berdusk]]an business owner.",
        "Inhabitants": "Despite its small size and relative isolation, Drawn Swords was the meeting place for several [[adventurer|adventuring]] parties, notable among them [[Saern's Sharp Swords]]."
