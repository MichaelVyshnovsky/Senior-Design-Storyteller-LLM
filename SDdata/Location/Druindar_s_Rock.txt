Druindars Rock was a rocky outcropping somewhere in Cormanthor, and a favored zone for elves to spell-duel.
The rocky formation rose over the treetops of Cormanthor. The formation was wooded on top, but it had a narrow projection that had no greenery on it.
In , Delmuth Echorn lured Elminster Aumar, recently knighted an armathor, to Druindars Rock for a spell-duel. Galan Goadulphyn and Athtar Nlossae rushed to the mountain during the duel, concerned that Galans cache would be revealed or buried a tree nearly fell upon them. Ultimately, fallout from the battle wound up slaying Athtar and causing Galan to fall while climbing.
To the Srinshee, that was the most likely place for a spellbattle or moot, if a Cormathan challenged another.
