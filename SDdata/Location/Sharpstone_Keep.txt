'''Sharpstone Keep''' was a large fortress located somewhere near [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The fortress was opulent in its heyday. It was also massive, arguably too large for any one bandit group to control on its own. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], bandit groups had carved out ruts for their carts into the stone floor, and homages to [[Gruumsh]] were etched into the walls. Following the arrival of [[giant]]s, some corridors were widened to accommodate them.

==History==
Sharpstone Keep was constructed with wealth gained from operations at [[Frostsilver Mines]].

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, bandits from the [[Burntbone Horde]] used the Keep as a camp from which to terrorize the roads between the Keep, the Frostsilver Mines, and Waterdeep. In response to a group of the Horde's [[goblin]] and [[kobold]] bandits attacking travelers on the road to Waterdeep, [[Laeral Silverhand]] employed [[adventurer]]s, who chased them back to Sharpstone Keep and slew their leader, an [[ogre]] known as [[Vargor|Vargor the Fierce]]. However, this was not sufficient to end the attacks between the Keep and the Mines, and Laeral concluded that the Horde's aggression was likely associated with [[Storm King's Thunder|conflicts among the giants]] in [[the North]]. Sure enough, when her adventurers returned to Sharpstone Keep, they discovered that a [[fire giant]] named [[Harkald Firesworn]] had declared himself king of the place, and had brought ogres and [[orc]]s with him. After the adventurers slew him, the Burntbone Horde fled Sharpstone Keep to the Frostsilver Mines.
