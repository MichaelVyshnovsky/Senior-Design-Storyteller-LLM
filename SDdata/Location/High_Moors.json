        "mainbody": "'''The High Moors''' were elevated uncultivated lands that, together with the [[Farsea Marshes]] (or [[Farsea Swamp]] during the century that followed the [[Spellplague]]), formed the northern frontiers of the Forest Kingdom of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|17}}",
        "Description": "The High Moors, like the rest of Cormyr, received a lot of precipitation every summer and spring and snowfall in winter. The area also was known for commonly occurring mists from where they stretched to the [[High Horn]] and the [[Eveningstar Gorge]]. The Moors were untamed and largely unexplored lands speckled with ruins of keeps, [[giants]]' castles, and other ancient structures inhabited by the remnants of the once powerful monster communities. Many believed that the High Moors hid ancient secrets of fallen civilizations and mysterious alien elder powers.",
        "Geography": "The High Moors were located in the foothills of the [[Storm Horn Mountains]], on their northern slopes with the [[Stonelands]] and the [[Goblin Marches]] bordering its northern edge. The [[Farsea Marshes]] bordered the Moors' western edge, separated by the [[Shore of Sorrow]].",
        "History": "During the glory days of [[Myth Drannor]] and when [[Suzail]] was still a fledging settlement, ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|200}}, the Goblin Marches and the High Moors were home to a mighty empire of [[goblin]] raiders who successfully ruined nearby kingdoms of [[Asram]] and [[Anauria]]. When the desert of [[Anauroch]] encroached on their lands, the goblins scattered into disjointed tribes, some of which retreated to the High Moors.\n\nAt some point before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Maris Khorma Terrabin]], a researcher and writer, built a small keep north of the High Moors from whence she traveled across the Moors and the Goblin Marches and collected information on the local species' ecologies.\n\nSometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, sages discovered tales of a forgotten city-state that once stood in the Moors. The lore came from a [[book]] called the ''[[Yielding Tide]]'' and talked about how powerful mages trapped a minor female deity underneath the city in an attempt to siphon her divine powers. It was believed that the goddess was still trapped under the ruins in the late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Inhabitants": "The only active [[human]] group that maintained its presence in the High Moors was the Black Network, the [[Zhentarim]] that moved its caravans across the Goblin Marches. Apart from the Zhentarim, the High Moors had minor holds of power established by the region's goblins. Goblin trilbies, the [[Neidlig]], tribe of six hundred, and the [[Fenlis]] â€“ hunted and laired on the High Moors.\n\nThe region was inhabited by [[griffon]]s who were believed to have a central lair in a cave somewhere near the High Moors north of the [[Castle Kilgrave]]. [[Copper dragon]]s inhabited the Storm Horns near the edge of the High Moors, with [[hieracosphinx]]es inhabiting the areas closer to the border's center, and [[hill giant]]s claimed the eastern side of the region."
