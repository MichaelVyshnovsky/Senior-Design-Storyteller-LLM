The '''Thousand Maws''' were a group of one hundred caves located in the [[Nether Mountains]] and were the homes of the [[Thousand Fists]] [[orc]] tribe. 

==Structure==
Many of the caverns were huge, such as [[Arraggar]], the home of around 60 orcs, and [[Oltho]], where roughly 70 orcs lived. The Thousand Maws were a spiderweb network of tunnels which wove throughout the mountains.  Many trails spanned the outer edges of the Maws, where the orc tribes posts scouts to watch the enemies or prey.

===Interior===
A few of the caverns were overgrown with [[Wikipedia:mushroom|mushrooms]] and the Thousand Fists tribe would used slaves to collect and farm these locations.

==History==
For years the orcs of the Thousand Fists tribe dwelt on the southern passes of the Nether Mountains and fought against the [[Ripped Gut]] orc tribe over control of [[Moon Pass]]. In [[1372 DR]], the Thousand Fists created an alliance with their rivals after the influence of a [[tanarukk]] emissary who was sent from [[Hellgate Keep]].

==Inhabitants==
The [[Blood of Morueme]] [[dragon]]s hunted the fringes of the Thousand Maws causing the Thousand Fists to move their livestock underground.
