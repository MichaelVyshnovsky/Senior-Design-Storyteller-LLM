'''Jhachalkhyn''' ({{Pronounce|jah|CHALk|in|refs=}}) was a drow city in the [[Underdark]].

==Geography==
It wasn't very clear where exactly Jhachalkhyn lay but it was far in the south from [[Menzoberranzan]] but not as far from the City of Spiders as [[Maeralyn]] was, in fact it was so near that it was considered reasonable to assume that refugees from the city would flee to Menzoberranzan, once it was destroyed.

==History==
At some point around [[1136 DR]], Jhachalkhyn was infiltrated by the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], who posed as minor nobility.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}}

Some time around [[1360 DR]], Jhachalkhyn was destroyed by another drow city called Maeralyn. Its citizens were assumed to flee towards Menzoberranzan.

Despite the destruction and defeat at an enemy's hand, Jhachalkhyn's political system and infrastructure proved to be rather resilient. It was still ruled by [[Lolth]]'s matriarchy and had a functional merchant class.

During the [[Silence of Lolth]], Jhachalkhyn's matriarchy lost its spells. The loss of power was exploited by the Jaezred Chaulssin fosterage under [[Xorthaul Barriath]] in the form of a streak of assassinations. This caused a shift in political power from the matriarchy to the merchant class who then became the assassins' guild sponsors.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|4}}

After the [[Spellplague]], the city was practically ruled by the Jaezred Chaulssin.{{cite web
