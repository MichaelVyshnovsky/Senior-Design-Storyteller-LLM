'''Gontal City''' was a port city and the capital of the kingdom of [[Gontal]], [[Laerakond]].{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|51-52}}

==Government==
As of [[1479 DR]], Gontal City was ruled by Queen [[Imreera Hethkantan]], who was a hands-off ruler who appeared to be more interested in sending expeditions to the [[Glaur Barrens]] than in actively ruling the land. The [[Twelvefold]] noble families held a large amount of power and some considered the families to be the true rulers of Gontal, although this wasn't actually true.

==Military==
Gontal City's military were the [[Tabards]], a highly trained military force that answered only to the queen.

==Economy==
Gontal City was the heart of Gontese trade. The Twelvefold families held control of a large number of trade guilds and Gontal City had full control of the [[Gontal Pass]] in the mountains, making the city a mandatory stop for trading caravans hoping to commerce with other Gontese settlements.

==History==
After the [[Blue Breath of Change]] sent [[Laerakond]] to [[Toril]], a group of pioneer [[dragonborn]] and [[human]]s founded the kingdom of Gontal, with Gontal City as their seat of power. As of 1479 DR, agents from both [[Melabrauth]] and [[Skelkor]] were sent to Gontal City to spy for their [[dragon]] overlords.
