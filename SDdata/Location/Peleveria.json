        "mainbody": "Peleveria was an ancient kingdom that occupied territory between and touching on the Firesteap Mountains, the Shaarwood, and the Landrise.\nThe grasslands of the area were marked by the River Pelevar, which ran south from the Firesteap Mountains to join the River Shaar just east of the Shaarwood. The River Shaar in turn flowed along a westerly course from the Landrise to join Lake Lhespen.\nThe ruins of the capital city of Peleveran could be found near the point where the River Shaar surfaced, built into the cliffs of the Landrise.\nThe greater area of what was once Peleveria was by 1373 DR part of the lands claimed by the Shaaran Ankheg Tribe."
