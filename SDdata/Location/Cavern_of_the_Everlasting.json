The cavern housed five statues depicting heroes of the Everlasting. Tables and benches were used during meetings.\nThis location was often used when the holy slayers of the Everlasting wished to hold a meeting during the heat of the day. Located underground, this cool chamber was a comfortable solution.\nFestivals or celebrations, usually as the result of the death of an enemy, were held here."
