The '''Heart of the Eagle''' was a treasury located within the fortress of [[Sarahin]] in the [[Haunted Lands]].{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|30}}

==Description==
Carved from the rock of the ridge upon which Sarahin stood, the Heart of the Eagle was a tight chamber decorated with several tapestries. Windows provided a splendid view of the river gorge below.

==History==
One of the tapestries was actually a ''[[tapestry of folded existence]]'' housing the entire treasure horde of the [[Everlasting]].
