        "mainbody": "Shou-town was a district in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral. It was populated largely by Shou humans from Shou Lung in Kara-Tur on Toril.\nThe borders of Shou-town were Dock Street on the leading-edge side, Grand Street on the starboard side, Dragon Street on the port side, and Eel Street on the trailing-edge side. It had a small open district square in the center.\nThe district was noisy and active, with busy folk going about their trades, while the tattooed Yakuza kept an eye on any visitors.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Shou-town had a population of several hundred Shou immigrants, mostly those fleeing suffering on Toril on board departing spelljammers and working for their passage, and the community seemed to be expanding daily. They were a close-knit community. However, the Yakuza quickly took hold in Shou-town and fought vicious battles to expand their territory.\nUnlike Shou Lung, Shou-town did not have nobles or noble warriors its people were almost exclusively artisans and craftsmen.\nIn practice, the district was ruled by the thieves guild known as the Yakuza, and their leader Ozamata Ku Murawa. The Yakuza engaged in extortion, racketeering, and gambling.\nHowever, Lord Chan Fu Wi, the official emissary to Bral from the Emperor of Shou Lung, was the only true noble Shou in Bral. While he believed that arguing with the Yakuza over leadership of the Shou people was beneath him, were he to give an order to the inhabitants of Shou-town, it would almost certainly be obeyed. Nevertheless, no Shou would betray the dominant Yakuza.\n* Hanwo Cobblery\n* The Shou Embassy\n* Yakuza House"
