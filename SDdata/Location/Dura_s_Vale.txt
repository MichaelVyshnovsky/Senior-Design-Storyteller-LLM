'''Dura's Vale''' was a [[valley|vale]] located in the [[Brynwood]] [[forest]] in [[the Vast]]. It laid approximately 26 miles (41 kilometers) from [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] and a league (5.5 kilometers) southeast of the [[Misty Vale]].

==History==
The [[ranger]] [[Dura Gerathu]] lived in the vale, and so the vale was named for him.

On the 29th of [[Eleasis]] of [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], members of the [[Vipers]] bandits followed Dura to his home in the vale and surprised him in his cabin. There they murdered him for his discovery of the [[Vipers' Nest]] and robbed his valuables, leaving his cabin open to the elements.

Two [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]] later reported Dura's death to [[the Green Lady]], a friend of Dura.

==Inhabitants==
The ranger Dura Gerathu lived in the vale until his death

==Description==
Dura's Vale was a little bowl-shaped valley with a small lake, which was filled with [[carp]]. An overgrown but still usable path led down into the vale and towards Dura's log cabin. This was a single-room structure with shuttered windows and fireplace.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}
