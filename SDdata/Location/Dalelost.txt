'''Dalelost''' was a ruined city lying in the [[Land of the Lions]] near the [[Lake of Steam]].

==Geography==
It lay on the northern shore of the Lake of Steam, just south of the [[Ankhwood]] and on the trail between [[Ankhapur]] and [[Yhep]].<ref>

==Trade==
Once upon a time, this settlement was a competitor of Yhep for much of the local [[pearl]] trade.

==History==
Despite its prosperity, over the course of a decade several disasters and misfortunes—the nature of which was forgotten to history—left Dalelost in ruins and abandoned by its people.

''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the ruins of Dalelost were occupied by a cabal of [[Banite]] [[cleric]]s, though they were in turn dominated by the [[Twisted Rune]].

==Description==
The Banites maintained a small temple to [[Bane]] and controlled a number of lesser [[undead]].

==Rumors & Legends==
It was thought that greater undead existed in their lairs below the ruins.
