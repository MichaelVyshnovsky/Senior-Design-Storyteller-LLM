city
Dalelost was a ruined city lying in the Land of the Lions near the Lake of Steam.
It lay on the northern shore of the Lake of Steam, just south of the Ankhwood and on the trail between Ankhapur and Yhep.
Once upon a time, this settlement was a competitor of Yhep for much of the local pearl trade.
Despite its prosperity, over the course of a decade several disasters and misfortunes—the nature of which was forgotten to history—left Dalelost in ruins and abandoned by its people.
Circa 1372 DR, the ruins of Dalelost were occupied by a cabal of Banite clerics, though they were in turn dominated by the Twisted Rune.
The Banites maintained a small temple to Bane and controlled a number of lesser undead.
It was thought that greater undead existed in their lairs below the ruins.
