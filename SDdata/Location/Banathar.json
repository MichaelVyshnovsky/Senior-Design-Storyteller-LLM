        "mainbody": "Banathar, also called Banthar, was a small mining village in Turmish in the Vilhon Reach in the 14 century DR.\nThe humble village of Banathar was located on the southern border of Turmish, on the slopes of the Aphrunn Mountains. Banathar was connected to the city of Merrydell by a small trail and lay south of the Turmway. Historically, Banathar served as a waystop on the Lilit Pass trail.\nBanathar began its life as a brigands stronghold. But by the midâ€“14 century DR, the stronghold was abandoned and the village took on a new identity as a sleepy mining and sheep-herding village.\nSometime circa 1358 DR, an adventurer descended into a local cellar and discovered a sack of precious rubies.\nDespite Banathars diminutive size, the town held a shrine to Silvanus, like many of the smaller villages of the Vilhon Reach.\nThere were many stories that claimed that the bandits who settled Banathar left behind countless buried treasures, there for adventurers picking. Over the villages history, many coin-filled leather satchels had been discovered around the village, with the finding of the rubies being the most significant by 1370 DR."
