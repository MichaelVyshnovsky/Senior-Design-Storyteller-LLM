'''Urvraunt''' was an [[enclave]] of [[Netheril]] that was destroyed during [[Karsus's Folly]], notable for its distance from Netheril.

==Geography==
When the enclave crashed, it came to a rest near the [[Yellow Sea]] at the eastern end of the [[Mountains of Amara]], north of the [[Talmaruk Islands]].

==History==
After crashing during Karsus's Folly in {{Yearlink|-339}}, the enclave was ruined but remained somewhat intact. Due it its incredibly remote location, it stayed completely unknown to the wider world through the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
