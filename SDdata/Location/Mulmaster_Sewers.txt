The '''sewers of Mulmaster''' were a rather ramshackle sanitation system of pipes and tunnels beneath the city-state.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|8}}{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|39}}

==Structure==
These sewers were quite extensive.{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|41-42}} Between these walkways was a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} deep trench through which sewage flowed. In some areas, these walkways were connected by bridges of metal grating.

The network was regularly in a flooded state, with water reaching up to knee height or approximately {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}. Its tunnels were also unlit, requiring a [[torch]] to traverse, and thick with the stench of decay.
===Functionality===
With the city-state of [[Mulmaster]] having been built within a depression formed by an arc of overbearing peaks, most of the sewer tunnels were at an incline that became less steep the closer they got to the harbor. Through this steep decline, refuse was gradually emptied into Mulmaster Bay.

===Sewer Ecology===
This sewer network had a reputation for monsters lairing within it, [[lacedon]]s,{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|13}}{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|8-9}} [[umber hulk]]s, and [[yellow mold]]. But the creatures most commonly encountered were insects, [[rat]]s, and [[giant rat]]s. One could also find crustaceans in the areas closer to the harbor.

These sewers were a hotbed of [[disease]]s that one could be exposed to, often by falling into or walking through the sewage. The diseases commonly contracted within the sewers included [[blinding sickness]], [[filth fever]], the [[shakes]], [[slimy doom]], and [[sewer plague]].{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|8}}

===Surface Connections===
The sewers could be entered by means of manhole covers or by removing grates, the cracks of which provided what little light there was to be found.
* The [[Wave and Wink]], a popular dancehall in the western part of Mulmaster, had an entrance into the sewers.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|10-11}}

==Groups of Interest==
Since early in its history, the sewers had a reputation for being frequented as a hideout by criminals, Because of this, they were regularly policed by the city-state's military.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/63/The Everwinking Eye: Who's Who in Mulmaster|7}}

The sewers did have dedicated workers with their own storage rooms in the network, though over time the number of men in this profession dwindled until they were far and far between by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], a woman named [[Lyetta]] escaped from her [[Zhentarim]] slaves into the sewers, evading all manner of beasts that later badly injured the Zhents that went in after her. She eventually entered a secret chamber where a [[displacer beast]] was lairing and climbed into a recess out of its reach.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, many of the pipes and tunnels within this network were in a state of rusting and crumbling respectively.

In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, a pair of mated [[flumph]]s by the names of [[Laal]] and [[Xol]] entered the sewers from the [[Underdark]] by means of a fissure, trailing the activity of a band of [[troglodyte]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|10}} The two eventually stumbled upon the activities of the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] within a tomb that predated both Mulmaster and its sewers. When Xol moved in for a closer look he was discovered by the cultists and killed with two shots from a [[crossbow]], his body left to fall into the sewers. 

Xol's corpse was carried along by the sewers' streams until it came to clog up the mouth of a discharge pipe,{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|5}}

[[Audra Maskyr]], a sergeant in the [[City Watch (Mulmaster)|City Watch]], proceeded to hire three groups to investigate reports of monsters within the sewers and eliminate any threats they come across. One was a rather inexperienced band of [[adventurer]]s that hailed from [[Sembia]],{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|9}} The second was a gang of [[Zhentarim]] [[mercenaries]]. And the third was another band of adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|6-7}} The first group, after hearing the disembodied voice of Laal (a failed attempt at [[telepathy|telepathic]] communication) pleading for help, they became convinced that the sewers were haunted. Later on they encountered the second group of adventurers sent into the sewers, who they informed them of their ghostly encounter.

Around the same year a number of other debacles occurred within the sewers. A group of adventurers had to traverse them{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|51}} A storm caused by the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] brought such a degree of rain upon the area that the sewer system was overflooded, resulting in an otyugh fleeing from the sewers in a panic and attacking anyone around it. And a group of [[troll]]s smashed their way through the walls leading into the sewers, infesting them and becoming an obstacle for a group of adventurers that were sent down to uncover the lost [[Selfaril Uoumdolphin|Sword of Selfaril]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Grimnoth]], a young adult [[black dragon]] that had made its lair within the Mulmaster sewers.
