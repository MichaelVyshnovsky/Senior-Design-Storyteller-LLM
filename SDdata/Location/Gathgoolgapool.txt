Gathgoolgapool was a kuo-toan city-state found in the Middledark.
Gathgoolgapool was located in a large subterranean waterway called Labrands Folly. It was found near the halfway point, between the Great Sea and Shining Sea, between the Fire Lands and the Serpent Deeps.
Yuan-ti of House Sseradess enslaved the kuo-toa, forcing them to collect food and other valuables.
