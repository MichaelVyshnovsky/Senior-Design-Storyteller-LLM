        "mainbody": "The largest of the [[Windrise Ports]], '''Tarmalune''' was a huge, cosmopolitan port city located on the southeastern shores of [[Laerakond]], considered by its inhabitants to be the rival of [[Faerûn]]ian [[Waterdeep]] in wealth, tolerant outlook, entrepreneurial spirit, the ambition of its residents, and the sheer number of constantly unfolding opportunities that presented to the inhabitants of the city. The city bustled with activity and its streets were crowded day and night with merchants, traders, [[adventurer]]s, nobles and commoners alike.",
        "History": "Tarmalune was originally named Tarmhaven,{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|53-54}} and like the other Windrise Ports, was part of the domains of the [[Dawn Titan]] [[Achazar]]. Most inhabitants of Tarmalune were descendants of the [[humanoid]] clans of the [[Sword Lands]].\n\nEventually, Achazar fell into a deep sleep and the slaves declared themselves free. [[Dragon]]s shunned Tarmhaven out of fear of Achazar, who sleep in the form of giant pillar of fire amid the city, allowing Tarmhaven to grow in wealth and influence across [[Abeir]]. In time the city became known as Tarmalune Great Port, and later just as Tarmalune.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], [[Tarmalune Trade House|Tarralune merchants]] arrived to [[Neverwinter]] in hopes to arrange permanent trade routes between Laerakond and Faerûn, and to outmaneuver their rivals from [[Lylorn]], who arrived in [[Luskan]] with similar goals.",
        "Government": "{{Main|Council of Tarmalune}}\nTarmalune was ruled by the twenty members of the [[Council of Tarmalune]], an assembly of traders of many races and both genders, although [[human]] males were predominant among its ranks. The head of the Council was known as the Lord Speaker. In 1479 DR, the Lord Speaker was [[Hamminas Dorn]].{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|51}}",
        "Defenses": "{{Main|Vigilant}}\nThe city had no standing army but the [[Vigilant]] order acted as the city watch. If needed, the Vigilant hired adventurers or mercenaries to supplement their own forces.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|52}}",
        "Law and Order": {
            "Cargo Taxes": "Tarmalune authorities did not tax shop sales or goods carried by land, but they did tax unloaded ship cargo. Black-uniformed city inspectors known as \"ravens\" were in charge to record any unloaded goods in the docks and issue the orders for merchants to pay the respective taxes. Harming or hampering an inspector earned imprisonment, seizure of all goods and city properties, and exile from Tarmalune; also, if an inspector resulted injured, an identical injury was inflicted to the injurer."

Rent contracts were renewed annually, usually in midsummer, unless a person lost wealth or prestige, being forced to get a less expensive home. As of 1479 DR, the number of citizens in Tarmalune was increasing at such rate that public houses were becoming scarcer and more expensive.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|49}}\n\nPets were forbidden for commoners, but wealthy Tarralune could have pets, usually exotic animals. However, even the humblest Tarralune keep a few caged chickens for fresh eggs, or to eat them if needed.\n\nThe highborn Tarralune also employed permanent maids and \"hands\" (servants who performed multiple tasks, such as taking care of animals, provide personal protection, or do menial work). Servants working for people of lower status only did it as part-time jobs.",
            "Religion": "Religion was uncommon in Tarmalune, like in the rest of the Windrise Ports, and the following of minor cults dedicated to the Dawn Titans or to dragons, as well as general superstition, were more universal than worshiping the [[gods]], that were a novelty introduced in [[Laerakond]] since the [[Blue Breath of Change]]. Among the major cults of Tarmalune was the [[Seekers of Scales]], a cult that worshiped dragons in general.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|4}}\n\nHowever, thanks to their cosmopolitan nature and their trade with Faerûn, the cities of the Windrise Ports were more open to the concepts of religion and the gods than other places of Laerakond. Although there was no preferred religion among Tarralune, the most influential religions established in the city were the faiths of [[Bahamut]], [[Sune]], [[Tempus]], [[Tiamat]], [[Umberlee]], [[Valkur]], [[Vergadain]], and [[Waukeen]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|50-52}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Building the Pyre|41}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|52}}"

Tarn-traders were independent sponsors, brokers, and hucksters, usually former merchants who had retired from their business or had sold their tarnelds, and had enough resources and contacts to successfully arrange mercantile deals for third parties.\n\nDarren shifted constantly in popularity, with the least desirable disappearing for a time and then reopening with new names and sponsors (named \"varth darren\").{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|50}} As of 1479 DR, the most frequented darren were the [[Golden Teacup]]{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|40}} and [[The Black Boot (Tarmalune)|The Black Boot]].",

While they disdained [[Eskorn]], seeing it as a backwater kingdom, they also traded with them. They had trade deals with their sworn rivals, the cities of the [[Dusk Ports]], as well, but such deals were uncommon and problematic.\n\nThey avoided to trade with the rest of the nations of Laerakond. They saw the dragon empire [[Skelkor]] a problematic nation full of dragon masters and slaves that were not good trade partners. This point of view became more severe after [[Gauwervyndhal]] tried to kidnap [[Halagothra|Halagothra the Healer]] some years before 1479 DR. [[Relmaur]] and [[Fimbrul]] were viewed as uncivilized places not worth the time.\n\nIn 1479 DR, some Tarralune merchants were starting to travel to [[Melabrauth]], even if was a dragon empire as well, because they saw a chance of getting good deals in the trade of old relics and rare herbs.",

Tarralune merchants had trade deals with many of the important cities in the [[Sword Coast]], including [[Athkatla]], [[Baldur's Gate]], and Waterdeep. Tarralune merchants also traded with the nation of [[Tethyr]] and many nations of the [[Shining Sea]], among them [[Tashalar]] and the cities of [[Tharsult]]. By 1479 DR, they had started to sent merchant ships to the port cities of [[Chult]]. \n\nTarralune merchants avoided to trade with the people of [[Calimshan]] and other slaver kingdoms, seeing them as no better than Skelkor. They also avoided [[Evermeet]] altogether, distrustful of the [[elves]] living there. \n\nWhile in the first years of trade deals between Laerakond and Faerûn, they avoided the [[Sword Coast North]], as there were no important settlements there in the years following the [[Spellplague]], they began to venture there in the late years of the 15 century [[DR]]. In 1479 DR they started to trade with Neverwinter."
