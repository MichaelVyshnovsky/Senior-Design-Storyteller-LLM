The city of Karse was built at the \"foot\" of the fallen god.\nKarsus Butte was the source of the Heartblood River, the foaming red-hued waterway that flowed westward through the forest.\nThe butte was formed immediately after Karsuss Folly in the , when Karsus was destroyed a moment after achieving apostheosis and his godly remains plummeted down to Toril.\nOn Hammer 1 in the , Galaeron Nihmedu used magic from a powerful artifact taken from within the Karsus Butte to summon the Return of the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar to Faer√ªn from the plane of Shadow. \nThe single notable structure atop the Karsus Butte was the Shrine of the Undying Heart, a temple built atop the butte dedicated to the Momentary God.\nKarsus Butte was considered a holy site by the cultists that worshiped him.\n* Wulgreth, the lich and former archmage that made his lair within the Karsus Butte centuries after his fall."
