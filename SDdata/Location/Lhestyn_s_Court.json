        "mainbody": "'''Lhestyn's Court''' was an alleyway in [[Waterdeep]] haunted by [[greater shadow]]s. It was named after [[Lhestyn Silmaeril]], a famous [[Lords of Waterdeep|Open Lord]] of the city in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The location was notorious as a killing ground for unscrupulous nobles to dispose of enemies and \"problems\" while keeping their hands clean.",
        "Location": "Lhestyn's Court was the interior of the city block bounded by the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] to the east, [[Chasso's Trot]] to the south, [[Copper Street]] to the west, and [[Immar Street]] to the north.<ref group=\"note\">This portion of Immar Street is incorrectly labeled as [[Thunderstaff Way]] on the map accessory to ''[[Waterdeep: Dragon Heist]]''. The inconspicuous entrance was on Immar Street just across from the primary entrance to the [[Jhansczil Villa]].",
        "History": "At the end of the 13{{th}} century, Lhestyn had taken on the persona of the \"Masked Lady\" and had infiltrated the Waterdhavian branch of the powerful [[Shadow Thieves]] consortium. In the {{YearlinkName|1298}}, she surreptitiously led groups of Shadow Thieves into deadly ambushes in this dead-end alley. None of the Shadow Thief agents escaped alive. Over the course of a [[tenday]], seven of these unsuspecting parties and totaling some fifty Shadow Thieves met their demise at the hands of the Masked Lady and her allies. This essentially drove the criminal organization out of Waterdeep.\n\nIt took more than twenty years, but the spirits of five of the betrayed Shadow Thieves manifested as greater shadows haunting Lhestyn's Court, making it a deadly place to wander. The area remained safe from two bells before [[highsun]] until two bells after, or if an intruder bore a light source of some kind. But other times the shadows could be seen flitting across the walls of the court, and any objects or detritus weighing less than {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}} were whirled and tossed about even on calm days.\n\nWhen they attacked a victim, even the victim's own shadow joined in the swarm. The first cut was always a slash across the right ankle, a signature move of the Shadow Thieves, who often left the right foot of an unfortunate assassin or thief at the scene of a failed attempt. As the fight progressed, the victim's shirt was ripped open and more slashes formed a bloody pattern on their chestâ€”that of the mask insignia of the Shadow Thieves with a gash through one eye. Once dead, the body was always found with the right foot severed and the victim's head barely visible from the street through the narrow archway into the court.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "* Those not familiar with the history of Lhestyn's Court usually believed it was named after her because it was where she died, but this was not the case.\n* The noble families [[Jhansczil]] and [[Rosznar]] were thought to be the primary contributors to feeding the shadows of Lhestyn's Court, trapping unsuspecting victims inside until death was inevitable."
