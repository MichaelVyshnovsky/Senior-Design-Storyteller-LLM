'''County Varyth''' was a region of lush farmland in [[Tethyr]] but also struggled with an elevated monster population.

==Geography==
Varyth was a member of the [[Crown Lands]]. It was between the [[River Ith]] and the [[Sulduskoon River]] and bordered County [[Rivershire]] and County [[Hazamarch]] in the [[Golden Marches]].

==Trade==
County Varyth produced large [[barley]] crops, as well as [[wine]]s and [[pipeweed]].

==Government==
County Varyth was ruled by a pair of mages, Count [[Dancon Riiklass]] and his wife [[Iimvara Riiklass]]. Dancon held the official power, but the Countess-Consort ran the everyday business of the county for him, as he was more often involved with his mutual role as Duties Chancellor of Tethyr. Their home was in the keep [[Tor Arcana]] on the River Ith.

==History==
As of [[1370 DR]], the county struggled with a relatively large population of monsters; as [[Elf|elves]] from the eastern portions of the [[Forest of Tethir]] drove the monsters out of their woods, they tended to cross the Sulduskoon and enter Varyth.
