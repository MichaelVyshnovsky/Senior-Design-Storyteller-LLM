        "mainbody": "'''Vanesci Hamlet''', or simply '''Vanesci''', was a town in [[Konigheim]] in the [[Utter East]] of [[southeast Faerûn]].<ref group=\"note\">Although not specifically stated, the geographic location of Vanesci Hamlet as being in Konigheim is determined by comparing the game map of ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' with standard maps of the region. It lay outside the [[Phantom Pass]], which connected it to the [[Kingdom of Nix]] on the [[Forbidden Plateau]].<ref group=\"note\">Although named a hamlet, in-game text refers to Vanesci as a town or village, suggesting a hamlet that grew into a town.",
        "Description": "Vanesci Hamlet was built upon a bed of [[gravel]] or stones, with cottages with light beige walls, arched or half-circle windows with flower boxes, and peaked turquoise-[[tile]]d roofs with chimneys; the ruined settlement in the Phantom Pass was of the same architectural style. There were granaries on the outskirts of town and a fountain in the middle.\n\nThe land around the settlement was mostly brown dirt with patches of green grassland and trees. To the east was a farm of some green plant. North of the town, a canal ran west to east, with sides supported by logs. Beyond it were fields of [[wheat]] and [[pumpkin]]s.\n\nTo the north, the land grew rocky, with cliffs rising upwards.",
        "History": {
            "During the Legendary Campaign": "[[Hjerik Broadkin]], an inhabitant of Vanesci, publicly challenged the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] to a duel as they passed through the streets. This took the form of a bloodforge battle, waged in and around Vanesci Hamlet.\n\nLater, the bandit [[Niro Longtooth]] extorted the folk of Vanesci into giving up their food supplies, else the town would be raided. When the leader of the Legendary Campaign returned, with followers starving for food, the villagers had none to spare. The leader surprised Longtooth, confronting the bandits in a bloodforge battle in the streets and fields of the town.\n\n[[Jesse Hearthe]], a popular and politically influential mage who had retired to Vanesci Hamlet, later denounced the Legendary Campaign, which aimed to unify the Utter East through conquest. To defend their honor, the leader faced Hearthe in a bloodforge battle."
