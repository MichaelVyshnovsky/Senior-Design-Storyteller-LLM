Only few people lived on the island of [[Sahu]] in the early 1400s [[DR]].{{Ne-time}} Some of them formed the small village of '''Jinutt''', which was located on the northern coast below the plateau dominating the island's interior.

==Inhabitants==
The inhabitants were fishermen who traded their catch for other goods and services to Sahu's second village, [[Misbahd]].
