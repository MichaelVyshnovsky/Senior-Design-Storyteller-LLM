Only few people lived on the island of Sahu in the early 1400s DR. Some of them formed the small village of Jinutt, which was located on the northern coast below the plateau dominating the islands interior.
The inhabitants were fishermen who traded their catch for other goods and services to Sahus second village, Misbahd.
