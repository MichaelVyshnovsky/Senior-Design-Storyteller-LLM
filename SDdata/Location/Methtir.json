Those lowlands were mostly composed of wild woods and arid grasslands.\nFor most of its history, the Methtir was the northern region of Unther.\nDuring the Second Sundering, of Nightal 26 of 1486 DR, large swaths of the Methtir region were exchanged with lands of the equivalent region in Shyr, a continent of the world of Abeir, when the Untherans were returned to Toril. The Untherans quickly reconquered the Methtir, but were unable of retrieve their other former lands. As of 1489 DR, most of the reborn nation of Unther was located in the Methtir region.\n*Methmere\n*Methwood\n*Riders to the Sky\n*River of Metals\n*Winding River"
