        "mainbody": "ilpur was an important Impilturian city found on the shores of the Easting Reach in the mid–14 century DR.\nDilpur was a rather insignificant location until its population swelled with refugees. After the influx of citizens, plans were quickly made to construct new city walls and expand the docks.\nDilpurs population in 1357 DR was 15,000, many of whom were refugees from neighboring Sarshel when that city fell into decline after a drop-off in trade from Damara.\nDilpurs lords—Imbraun, Soargilm, and Sambrar—were concerned for the future of their city. They believed a renewal in trade, specifically for bloodstone, would benefit the city and Impiltur as a whole, but the renewed trade with Damara might also tempt many of Dilpurs citizens to return to Sarshel."
