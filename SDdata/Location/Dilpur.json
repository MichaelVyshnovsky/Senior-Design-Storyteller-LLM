        "Activities": "Dilpur was a rather insignificant location until its population swelled with refugees. After the influx of citizens, plans were quickly made to construct new city walls and expand the docks.",
        "Inhabitants": "Dilpur's population in [[1357 DR]] was 15,000, many of whom were refugees from neighboring [[Sarshel]] when that city fell into decline after a drop-off in trade from [[Damara]].\n\nDilpur's lords—[[Imbraun]], [[Soargilm]], and [[Sambrar]]—were concerned for the future of their city. They believed a renewal in trade, specifically for [[bloodstone]], would benefit the city and Impiltur as a whole, but the renewed trade with Damara might also tempt many of Dilpur's citizens to return to Sarshel."
