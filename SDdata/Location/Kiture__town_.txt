Kiture (, though under a different name. In the , when the kingdom of Kurrimal was founded as the successor of Aleaxtis, this towns name was changed to that of the prince put in charge of governing it.
Compared to other towns, Kiture had an unusually high rate of malenti births. Most malenti spawned in this town were quickly put to death, while some managed to survive to become priestesses of Sekolah, spies, or warriors. However, due to Kittures brutal elimination of malenti newborns, it was not uncommon for malenti in any three of these groups to go rogue and take up life in Ser√¥s.
