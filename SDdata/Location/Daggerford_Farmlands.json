        "mainbody": "aggerfords Farmlands included Eastern and Western Farmlands. Both areas laid on the south bank of Delimbiyr River to the east and west of Daggerford, respectively. Eastern Farmlands were two hours walk away from the city.\nThe Farmlands were sizable plots of valley land, worked only by a handful of farmers who lived in the center of each. These lands belonged to the Duke Daggerford and were regularly patrolled by the citys guard force, making it the calmest and safest small stretch of the Trade Way. The Western Farmlands were famously a beautiful spot in the fall during the apple-picking season. \nEastern Farmlands laid on a stream that grew deeper and eventually merged with Delimbiyr River. It was known to be a home of several species of fish that fed the locals. In the streams deeper part it split and encircled a small island, thick with trees and a single willow. That island was known for its fishing spots and a large deep forbidding hole that dropped into a sizable underground cave. The cave had access to fresh water and was a home to a species of harmless giant mushrooms that exuded thick mist-like spore clouds. The island was accessible by a single boat held in place with a mooring.\nThe Eastern Farmlands held lush apple orchards, corn and grain fields. The gristmill there was one of the  major sources of food for Daggerford and the grains were stored in a series of silos not far from the mill.\nSometime before 1372 DR, an unnamed wizard lived in the Western Farmlands in his humble tower and pursued his alchemical vocation, even though he was considered \"evil\" he helped the locals with his potions and fueled economy by hiring the local laborers to acquire certain ingredients. Eventually he decided to pursue immortality and successfully transformed himself into a lich. However that unlife was cut short after a group of paladins and clerics from Waterdeep heroically slew the undead wizard, leaving his imp familiar Boonmoppet living alone in his tower.\nIn 1372 DR, during the period of strife caused by Zhentarims attempt to take over Daggerford, the lands outside of the city walls were provided no defense and the city patrols were withdrawn by Baron Matagar Bugo. During that year, a group of heroes led by the Hero of Daggerford were tasked by Maerovyna, a cleric of Chauntea, with visiting her friend Fernd Krip, the owner of the Eastern Farmlands gristmill. The mill was a major food supplier and its recent slowdown threatened Daggerford with famine.\nWhen the heroes reached the Eastern Farmlands they were greeted by a young girl who claimed to have lost her dog Fluffy who fell into a forbidding hole on the fishing island in the stream. Once he heroes tied rope to an old willow tree and descended into the abyss they were faced with the same little girl grinning devilishly. She was Boonmoppet the imp who quickly opened a gate into the Planes, summoning his \"dogs\" Fluffy, Moxy, and other kocrachons, while fleeing through another gate. Defeating the demons and closing the portals, the adventurers followed the imp and found themselves inside his tower in the Western Farmlands. However the imp was more mischievous and lonely, rather than evil and malicious, the heroes were granted access to magical goods left behind by Boonmoppets master as the imp was happy to trade and have a conversation with someone who didnt want to slay him on sight.\nOnce the Hero reached the mill, it became obvious that it was in disarray. The silo had only a few moldy bags of grain and a family of mice while inside, the place was in disarray and rat-infested. The miller, Fernd Krip was acting like a raving lunatic, and not simply heartbroken. Further investigation revealed that the miller was driven barking mad by Loru, a slaad who befriended him in a guise of a kindly monk. The slaads plan was to have the miller mix Lorus toxins with the produce to infect the local and raise an army of slaadi. However the Hero of Daggerford saw through the lies and slain the monster, saving the city from starvation, locals from becoming an army of extraplanar creatures, and Fernds sanity was restored with the help from one of Maerovynas acolytes.\nEastern Farmlands\n*Churlgo Farm the halfling farm that produced famous Churlgo Cheese. Located not far from the gristmill.\n*Daggerford Graveyard the plot of land across from an apple orchard used, as the citys graveyard. Apart from many mossy and lichen-covered gravestones and memorials, the graveyard held the Bricket family crypt and a mortuary mausoleum, at its center.\n*Docks a small dock was located to the north from the mill and Churlgo family far. It was a stop for barges that slowly moved up and down River Delimbiyr.\n*gristmill a major producer of grains and flours that fed Daggerford. The mill was located past the Graveyard and not far from the Churlgo farm. A grain silo was adjacent to the mill.\nWestern Farmlands\n*Boonmoppets tower the small tower that belonged to a wizard who lived just outside the farmers homes. Located on a cobbled path crossroads across from an ancient moss-covered obelisk that was carved with faded directions.\n*Maxillian Manor the farmhouse of the apple-growing Maxillian family of secret lycanthropes who lured unwitting adventurers and hunted them for sport for several generations before 1372 DR.\n*Old wishing well the place where a known hero Peredus the Great met his demise. The well itself was long dried by 1372 DR and had a sign in front that read \"Toss a coin into the well for good luck.\" and below was etched by a vandal the following \"And watch out for ghosts. Ha ha ha...\"\nThe Farmlands were scarcely populated mostly by the common folk who worked the fields and orchards. The farmers livestock included cows and chickens, and wild boars were known to lair in the burrows of the Eastern Farmlands. Mice and rats also scavenged among the livestock.
