        "Description": "The Farmlands were sizable plots of valley land, worked only by a handful of farmers who lived in the center of each. These lands belonged to the Duke Daggerford and were regularly patrolled by the city's guard force, making it the calmest and safest small stretch of the Trade Way. The Western Farmlands were famously a beautiful spot in the fall during the apple-picking season.",
        "Geography": "Eastern Farmlands laid on a stream that grew deeper and eventually merged with Delimbiyr River. It was known to be a home of several species of fish that fed the locals. In the stream's deeper part it split and encircled a small island, thick with trees and a single [[willow]]. That island was known for its fishing spots and a large deep forbidding hole that dropped into a sizable underground cave. The cave had access to fresh water and was a home to a species of harmless giant [[mushroom]]s that exuded thick mist-like spore clouds. The island was accessible by a single boat held in place with a mooring.",
        "Trade": "The Eastern Farmlands held lush [[apple]] orchards, [[corn]] and grain fields. The [[gristmill]] there was one of the  major sources of food for Daggerford and the grains were stored in a series of silos not far from the mill.",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1372 DR]], an unnamed [[wizard]] lived in the Western Farmlands in his humble tower and pursued his alchemical vocation, even though he was considered \"evil\" he helped the locals with his potions and fueled economy by hiring the local laborers to acquire certain ingredients. Eventually he decided to pursue immortality and successfully transformed himself into a [[lich]]. However that unlife was cut short after a group of [[paladin]]s and [[cleric]]s from [[Waterdeep]] heroically slew the undead wizard, leaving his [[imp]] [[familiar]] [[Boonmoppet]] living alone in his [[Boonmoppet's tower|tower]].\n\nIn 1372 DR, during the period of strife caused by [[Zhentarim]]'s attempt to take over Daggerford, the lands outside of the city walls were provided no defense and the city patrols were withdrawn by Baron [[Matagar Bugo]]. During that year, a group of heroes led by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] were tasked by [[Maerovyna]], a [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]], with visiting her friend [[Fernd Krip]], the owner of the Eastern Farmlands' gristmill. The mill was a major food supplier and its recent slowdown threatened Daggerford with famine.\n\nWhen the heroes reached the Eastern Farmlands they were greeted by a young girl who claimed to have lost her [[dog]] [[Fluffy]] who fell into a forbidding hole on the fishing island in the stream. Once he heroes tied rope to an old willow tree and descended into the abyss they were faced with the same little girl grinning devilishly. She was Boonmoppet the imp who quickly opened a ''[[gate]]'' into the Planes, summoning his \"dogs\" Fluffy, [[Moxy]], and other [[kocrachon]]s, while fleeing through another ''gate''. Defeating the demons and closing the portals, the adventurers followed the imp and found themselves inside his tower in the Western Farmlands. However the imp was more mischievous and lonely, rather than evil and malicious, the heroes were granted access to magical goods left behind by Boonmoppet's master as the imp was happy to trade and have a conversation with someone who didn't want to slay him on sight.\n\nOnce the Hero reached the mill, it became obvious that it was in disarray. The silo had only a few moldy bags of grain and a family of mice while inside, the place was in disarray and rat-infested. The miller, Fernd Krip was acting like a raving lunatic, and not simply heartbroken. Further investigation revealed that the miller was driven barking mad by [[Loru]], a [[slaad]] who befriended him in a guise of a kindly [[monk]]. The slaad's plan was to have the miller mix Loru's toxins with the produce to infect the local and raise an army of slaadi. However the Hero of Daggerford saw through the lies and slain the monster, saving the city from starvation, locals from becoming an army of extraplanar creatures, and Fernd's sanity was restored with the help from one of Maerovyna's acolytes.",
