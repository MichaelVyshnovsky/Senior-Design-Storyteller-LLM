        "mainbody": "Jhachalkhyn () was a drow city in the Underdark.\nIt wasnt very clear where exactly Jhachalkhyn lay but it was far in the south from Menzoberranzan but not as far from the City of Spiders as Maeralyn was, in fact it was so near that it was considered reasonable to assume that refugees from the city would flee to Menzoberranzan, once it was destroyed.\nAt some point around 1136 DR, Jhachalkhyn was infiltrated by the Jaezred Chaulssin, who posed as minor nobility.\nSome time around 1360 DR, Jhachalkhyn was destroyed by another drow city called Maeralyn. Its citizens were assumed to flee towards Menzoberranzan.\nDespite the destruction and defeat at an enemys hand, Jhachalkhyns political system and infrastructure proved to be rather resilient. It was still ruled by Lolths matriarchy and had a functional merchant class.\nDuring the Silence of Lolth, Jhachalkhyns matriarchy lost its spells. The loss of power was exploited by the Jaezred Chaulssin fosterage under Xorthaul Barriath in the form of a streak of assassinations. This caused a shift in political power from the matriarchy to the merchant class who then became the assassins guild sponsors.\nAfter the Spellplague, the city was practically ruled by the Jaezred Chaulssin."
