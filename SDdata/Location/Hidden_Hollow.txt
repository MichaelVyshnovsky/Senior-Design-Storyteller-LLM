'''Hidden Hollow''' was an independent town in the [[Kingdom of Earthenmore]] in [[the Vast]] that was built in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and worked by members of the [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[Clan Shado]].

==Description==
Despite its age, Hidden Hollow grew rapidly. The population grew to five hundred souls in only 18 months after its founding. The town itself and 500 acres of land around it were encircled by a large wall.

==Geography==
Hidden Hollow was built at the northernmost end of the [[Glorming Pass]] that crossed the [[Earthfast Mountains]] south. [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] was its closest northern neighbor along the [[North Road]], {{SI|28|mile|k|long=yes}} away, and [[Sevenecho]] was its southern neighbor, {{SI|64|mile|k|long=yes}} away across the Earthfasts.{{Cite living city/Cenotaph|5}}

==Government==
Hidden Hollow and its surrounding territories were independent from the rest of the Vast by design. It was claimed by the tiny Kingdom of Earthenmore and governed by Duchess [[Heather Dragonsnap]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Earthenmore's claim to the land was not objected to by the neighboring city-states, and its location made it commercially important to [[Procampur]] and [[Mulmaster]], as Hidden Hollow could increase the security of the North Road and Glorming Pass, thus strengthening trade. As long as Hidden Hollow was not imposing tolls on passing caravans, its international relationships remained positive.

==History==
Heather Dragonsnap was a renowned [[gnome|gnomish]] adventurer from [[Ravens Bluff]] who, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], put a claim on a piece of no man's land at the entrance to the Earthfast Mountains. No one disputed the gnome's claim as the land was untamed and ripe with dangerous [[goblin]] and [[orc]] tribes. This threat did not dissuade Heather. She assembled a like-minded group of people to settle a new town on the wild land. By [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}}, Heather and her group had already constructed the first building of Hidden Hollow, namely a stockade by the entrance to the mountain pass. The stockade's supplier was [[Steprock and Sons]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] mining company based in the Vast. [[Nadd Parker]], a freelance reporter, penned an article about the town's founding in the same month's issue of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]]. In her interview for the periodical, Heather Dragonsnap announced that Hidden Hollow would be an independent settlement, seeking an alliance with other cities of the Vast.{{Cite trumpeter/2-1/Keeping a Bad Gnome Down – Part II|2}}

By [[Flamerule]] of 1371 DR, Sir [[Tyrell Darkmoon]] of Ravens Bluff held the title of a Baron of Hidden Hollow.{{Cite trumpeter/2-7s/Government Positions Draw Plenty of Nominations|3}} By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Hidden Hollow was already considered to be a busy township under Duchess Heather Dragonsnap's rule. Sometime in or before Hammer and [[Alturiak]] of 1372 DR, Hidden Hollow suffered from a wave of crime. Builders and laborers who were working hard constructing the ever-growing township fell prey to a mysterious murderer. It was discovered that Hidden Hollow had a "nest" of malicious [[tanar'ri]], and the slayings lasted for a whole month. [[Kima Greyleaf]] and a group of [[Knights of the Golden Rooster]] traced [[fiend]]ish activity to Hidden Hollow. The Duchess asked Kima Greyleaf to eradicate the threat, but the tanar'ri were sly and framed Kima and her associates for murder. The group was brought to Judge [[Judith Hangman]], who, in turn, was revealed to be a [[nalfeshnee]] fiend. Kima Greyleaf, Knights of the Golden Rooster, and Clan Shado stood against the nalfeshnee and a whole nest of tanar'ri. To make the conflict worse, one of the battle's participants, [[Ellaquin Shadowsteel]], attracted the attention of Lord [[Vondryxx]], a [[balor]] who had a score to settle. Vondryxx challenged Ellaquin to a battle and beheaded the adventuring knight. The battle of Hidden Hollow raged on until the [[wizard]] [[Aranwe]] of [[Aglarond]] used a magical device to transform himself into a powerful creature of the [[upper planes]]. Subsequently, Vondryxx fled, and the tanar'ri nest was destroyed. This grand battle was also reported by Nadd Parker for ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter.''{{Cite trumpeter/3-1/Tanar'ri "Nest" Destroyed in Hidden Hollow|3-4}}

In the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the village of Hidden Hollow became the site of a massacre. It was evacuated three months before a group of good dragons were attacked and massacred amidst the empty settlement by evil servants of [[Tiamat]]. The aerial massacre left Hidden Hollow in ruins, being damaged by plummeting draconic corpses.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Spirit|6}} A [[Harper]] agent named [[Patch]] was tasked with the investigation of the massacre above the town.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Spirit|15}}
