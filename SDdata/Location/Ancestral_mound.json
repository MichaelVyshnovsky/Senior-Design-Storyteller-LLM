        "mainbody": "An ancestral mound, or ancestor mound, was a holy place of utmost important to the tribal peoples of Faer√ªn.\nEvery Uthgardt tribe had an associated mound, which was fixed at a specific location. Here, they believed their founders of tribe were buried, and worshiped totems, particularly during Runemeet. An altar mound, carved into the shape of a tribes totem beast, was placed in the centre of an ancestral mound.\nMultiple tribes could share their ancestral mound, such as the Black Lion tribe and Red Tiger tribe, whose ancestral mound was Beorunnas Well. Other known mounds were Raven Rock, the Great Worm Cavern, Flint Rock, Morgurs Mound, Stone Stand, Shining White and the Grandfather Tree.\nMost family groups, or clans of a specific tribe, would live only a few weeks trek from their ancestral mound. \nthumb|right|Overhead and cross-sectional views of Uthgardt ancestral mounds (left) standard and (right) the Elk tribes Flint Rock.\nTribal shamans could cast spells on such a mound to bring forth a ghostly apparition of an ancestor. Doing so was very beneficial, but also somewhat risky. Shamans who were not wise enough could become subject to the uncontrollable wrath of the ghost. However, if controlled successfully, the ghost could be made to guard the ancestor mound, or tell the shaman ancient tribal secrets.\nWhen shamans of a tribe would pass away, their relics, as well as their remains, would be buried in the mound."
