        "mainbody": "bar, also called the Lost City of Ubar, was a unique city found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, in 1367 DR.\nUbar was the given name of the city in Jannti, the common genie tongue, but the desert giants referred to the location as Dayya in their own language.\nThis mystical city was said to rise from the sands of the Genies Anvil of the High Desert whenever the genies commanded. Other travelers said it was a permanent fixture of the desert. \nUbar was ringed with strong stone walls and iron gates. Eight octagonal-shaped towers provided splendid views of the surrounding terrain. Ubars central market was built around a deep well. All of the buildings in Ubar were large enough to accommodate giants, prompting the logical conclusion that it was originally constructed by desert giants.\nBecause of the Amirs poor health, and lack of leadership to direct routine maintenance, many of the buildings in Ubar were in need of repair.\nThe Amirs palace, the Red Tower of Dayya, was located in the center of the city.\nMosques to Hajama, Najm, and Haku could be found within Ubar.\nPerhaps in an attempt to win back a location that was originally theirs, desert giants raided Ubar frequently.\nUbar was populated by an astonishing 200,000 jann, though many of them only visited periodically while wandering the desert. Any janni within the city was not required to answer the call of a shair.\nUbar fielded 2,000 soldiers to guard the city. Many of these soldiers were camel lancers and archers."
