        "mainbody": "Farview was a small village located on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.\nFarview was the westernmost settlement on Moray. It was located toward the center of the island on the coast of the Trackless Sea several miles west of the southern edge of the Breasal Marsh.\nNorthlander followers of the Storm Maiden liberated the village of Farview. They used timber harvested from the nearby Shannyth Forest to construct some of the finest ships seen within the Moonshae Isles. These ships were important because they allowed the Storm Maiden to move her troops among the islands of the Moonshaes, thus Farview was heavily guarded to ensure their protection."
