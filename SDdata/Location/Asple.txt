Asple was a small fishing community on the north-western shores of the Vilhon Reach.
Asple was nestled on the east most edge of the Aphrunn Mountains, on the shores of the Vilhon Reach and to the south of the island of Iligh√¥n.
Even though Asples main production was fish, the town also housed a rich and prosperous stone quarry that supplied the Reach. The town of Asple also attracted industrious adventurers in search of old sunken ships flush with treasures as the local fishers were quite knowable on the matter.
Asple was settled on the north-western shores of the Vilhon Reach in 50 DR, during the period of fast expansion and settlement of the region.
As of the late 14 century DR, Asple remain an independent city-state, mostly due to lack of attention from its neighbors. However, the town posed little danger and was an easy target for a takeover.
