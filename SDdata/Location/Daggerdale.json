        "mainbody": "Daggerdale, originally named Merrydale, was a remote region of the Dalelands located between the Desertsmouth Mountains and the Dagger Hills. It was a region of dark forests and rocky hills with a single large settlement named Dagger Falls.\nMost of the folk in Daggerdale were hunters and farmers, living in small villages and isolated homesteads. The people were generally xenophobic and fearful of outsiders, due in large part to the bandit and monster attacks that regularly plagued the countryside. This was exacerbated by continuous assaults and schemes enacted by Zhentarim spies and agents throughout the 14 century. Generally speaking, the Dalesfolk of Daggerdale wanted to be left alone.\nSince the , and Randal Morns reclamation of the dale, the lord used his Freedom Riders to drive beasts and Zhents from the lands. The Freedom riders are supplemented by mercenaries bands to keep the scattered farmlands of Daggerdale safe.\nBy the , the Lords Retinue had been formed, a fighting force of 150 mounted warriors that patrolled the dale and its roads. Stationed in Castle Daggerdale and Dagger Falls mostly, they would be supplemented by local village militias when their numbers were insufficent.\nDaggerdales economy was largely based on subsistence crops, furs and livestock, most notably sheep. Deposits of beryl found deep in the Dagger Hills meant that emeralds could potentially be mined, however the threat of lycanthrope attacks in the area made most excursions too dangerous. Most of Daggerdales manufactured goods had to be imported though.\nthumb|left|The crest of Daggerdale.\nDwarves were the first recorded residents of the area. They built a small settlement at the future site of Dagger Falls to act as a portage around the River Tesh and to store metals before they were transported south for trade.\nThe human history of Daggerdale went back to the Jhaamdathan settlers to the dale. Certainly, the history before the arrival of humans was recorded by the elves of Rystall Wood thousands of years ago. These first human settlers fled from destroyed Jhaamdath in the , were led to the northwestern foothills of the Dagger Hills by a man named Dordrien. These Jhaamdathan refugees built a small keep in those hills to defend their lowland town (which the dwarves had no interest in), which took the name of Dordrien. They traded the crops and livestock that they farmed in the lowlands for dwarven crafts.\nRefugees from the Netherese survivor states of Asram, Anauria, and Hlondath fled east toward the Moonsea and founded Teshar in the . By the end of that same year, the last people of Dordrien left their holdings in the Dagger Hills due to orc attacks from the mountains. House Mindosel commissioned Cormyrean cartographers to map the lands of the Inner Sea to mark the year of their familys elevation to the nobility of Teshar in 112 DR.\nCenturies later, drow raiders from the Twisted Tower of Ashaba made their way into the Tesh Valley and began raiding the human settlements there. These raids brought about the collapse of Teshar as a nation in the , and reduced it to scattered villages.\nLater, a mysterious and powerful mage named Alokkair came out of the West and helped one of the regions petty lordlings, Hlonagh, to conquer his neighmbours. In the , they found Hlontar amid the ruins of Teshar. Although he served for awhile as the court wizard of the kingdom, Alokkair soon killed the lord and most of his family, taking one of his daughters as his wife. He ruled over Hlontar as its Wizard-king through a combination of oppression, superior magic and an excellent network of informers and toadies. In the , Alokkairs three daughters defeated him and Hlontar reverted back to a realm of independent allied villages known as Merrydale.\nThe undead servants of a group of master vampires plagued the land of Merrydale for many years. In the , the most influential family of the dale, the Morns, renamed the land Daggerdale after the traditional name the dwarves had for the land.\nTerribly weakened by the infestation of vampires, certain factions considered the dale ripe for the taking. Increased numbers of Malar-worshiping lycanthropes stalked the fringes of the Cormanthor forest, seeking Daggerfolks to feast upon and infect. Many would-be wizard conquerors began to infiltrate the realm at this time, unleashing their deadly constructs upon the land. It was during this time that Shraevyn the Weapons-Mage created the Sword of the Dales in the .\nLike the other dales, Daggerdale fell briefly under the sway of Aencar the Mantled King in 1038 DR. Shortly thereafter, in the , Daggerdale regained its traditional independence when Aencar died.\nThe Daggerfolk enjoyed prosperity as a trading partner of the Tethyamar dwarves prior to its fall in 1104 DR, which resulted in economic collapse of the dale. During this period the tyrannical Mage-lord, Colderan Morn, rose to power in the mid 1200s and drove the remaining dwarves from the dale.\nColderan blamed Clan Brightblade for the disappearance of his son and heir, Belard Morn. In actuality Belard had been kidnapped by Colderans drow \"allies\" before being rescued by the Harpers (including Elminster and Storm Silverhand). Belard and eventually his son Flars Morn were raised in secret by the Harpers away from the Dale until an opportunity arose to reveal Flars heritage to him.\nReturning to Daggerdale, Flars found his grandfather, Colderan, had passed away and roving bands of Zhent-sponsored outlaws held sway. Uniting the dale once again under the rule of the rightful Morn family, Flars soon sired one of Daggerdales most famous lords, Randal Morn.\nLater in the , when refugees from fallen Teshendale started flocking to Daggerdale, the first agents of the Zhents arrived. By 1336 DR, the Black Network claimed Dagger Falls as their own, driving Randal Morn, the hereditary lord of Daggerdale, into the hills and installing Malyk as ruler. The House of Morn had ruled Daggerdale for centuries prior to the arrival of the Zhents, and Randal was the last surviving male heir.\nMorn began fighting the Zhentarim with guerrilla warfare, with the first major victory occurring nearly two decades later with the death of the puppet ruler Malyk in the . The Zhentarim responded aggressively, leading to a series of events that culminated in all-out civil war by 1369 DR.\nWith events abroad such as the recent destruction of Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim had its attention elsewhere during this time, allowing Morn the window he needed to reclaim the Dagger Falls and thus the region.\nRandal was the last male heir to the House of Morn. His sister, Silver Cormaeril lived to the south, married into the Cormaeril family of Cormyr. Unless Morn produced an heir, control of Daggerdale would pass to the Cormaeril family upon his death.\nIn the , Randal Morn died after catching pneumonia on a hunting trip. Randal Morns nephew, Sathrin Cormaeril, arrived in Daggerdale and claimed the throne. Sathrin ruled until 1425 DR when he died and was succeeded by his son Domavos. Domavos attended the renewal of the Dales Compact in Mistledale during that same year.\nAfter 44 years of his reign Domavos died in the  and was succeeded by his son Barathal.\nIn the , Neranya Cormaeril, Barathals sister was attacked by werewolves and joined the lycanthropes of White Crag.\nIn 1480 DR, the evil Zhentarim cleric Rezlus attempted to seize control of Daggerdale through the Tower of Void where four heroes from the Dalelands stood and opposed him. Upon the Zhentarims defeat, the dragon Incendius destroyed Daggerdale but was killed by the human fighter of the four heroes. The Cyricist Zhentarim then began their invasion of Tethyamar.\nDaggerdale was a more remote region of the Dalelands, in the upper region of Tesh Valley between the Desertsmouth Mountains and the Dagger Hills. Very few paths entered in and out of dale, and heavy woodlands further isolated, and protected, the farmlands and more pristine open areas.\nThis lightly wooded dale of rolling hills was perhaps one of the most unspoiled of landscapes among the Dalelands. Daggerdale was divided up by numerous rocky valleys and the few settled areas are centered around the town of Dagger Falls.\n*Border ForestThis forest rested on the northern border of Daggerdale. It connected to three other regions but was rarely frequented by travelers. The native inhabitants were fey, such as satyrs, pixies, sprites and dryads. These fey had a hostile attitude towards civilized races due to past dealings with Zhentarim loggers working out of Snowmantle.\n*Dagger FallsThe nearby town of Dagger Falls was named after this waterfall. It has a sheer drop that could not be navigated by boats or returning salmon.\n*Dagger HillsThis was the hilly area south-east of Dagger Falls. At one time, it contained tilled farmland which has since been abandoned and reclaimed by nature. Many monsters and predatory animals made this area their home.\n*Desertsmouth MountainsThese mountains ran along the western border of the Dalelands. They were previously home to the Tethyamar dwarves, trade partners of the Daggerfolk, prior to the fall of their kingdom at the hands of a savage horde. Descendants of the monstrous attackers, orcs, ogres and fiends, still lived in on the mountain tops.\n*Anathars Dell This was a Brightblade holding in southern Daggerdale.\n*Castle Daggerdale The famed keep overlooked the Tethyamar Trail and the thorp of Serpentsbridge from the western edge of the Dagger Hills.\n*Dagger Falls The was the capital and largest settlement in Daggerdale.\n*Hadreths Glen A small hamlet along the southwestern edge of the Border Forest.\n*Snowmantle In isolated village near the Border Forest that was leveled in 1369 DR.\n*Tachepp One of the small elven villages of Daggerdale.\n*Teshmere A hamlet just west of Dagger Falls along the Black Road.\n*Tethyamarside Another hamlet south of Dagger Falls along the Tethyamar Trail.\n*White Chalk Hollow This hamlet was located along the southwestern edge of the Border Forest."
