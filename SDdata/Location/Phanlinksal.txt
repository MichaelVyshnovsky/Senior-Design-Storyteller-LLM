'''Phanlinksal''' was a ruined [[illithid]] settlement located in the [[Underdark]].

==Geography==
Phanlinksal was located in the [[Upperdark|Upper]] [[Northdark]] beneath the [[Lurkwood]], a few weeks' march west of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Structure==
The settlement was located in a long, narrow cavern and built in the form of a castle centered around a stalagmite tower, which served as living quarters for prominent members of the community. Inside the tower, balconies lined the walls, overlooking the central [[elder brain]], which was constantly attended to by nimble-fingered slaves. Other structures in the city included the Axial Plaza, a capture pit, thrall barracks, a gladiatorial arena, and birthing pools.

Just outside the city was a [[roth√©]]-inhabited "herd island" surrounded by gorges with a narrow, magical bridge connecting it to the settlement.

==Inhabitants==
Before its destruction, Phanlinksal was home to an elder brain and up to 120 illithids and three times that number of thralls.

==History==
The city was founded in the {{YearlinkName|491}}, by the elder brains ruling illithid society. They chose a defensible cavern close to the surface to allow for easy raiding of [[Uthgardt]] tribes in the [[Lurkwood]]. One of the elder brains was relocated to the site. Despite this, the settlement always remained small.

In the {{YearlinkName|568}}, illithids from Phanlinksal attempted to invade the [[drow]] city of Menzoberranzan from the [[Eastways]]. But the mind flayers were defeated and 80 of them were executed by a [[vampiric illithid]] (kept as a "pet" by [[House Oblodra]]) in a location later named the [[Cavern of the Severed Tentacles]].

The illithids continued to be a nuisance to Menzoberranzan. In the {{YearlinkName|1328}}, the ruling [[House Baenre]] grew tired of illithid raids and armed themselves to destroy Phanlinksal. The city was spared when [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]], one of the more prominent mind flayers, agreed to serve [[Matron Mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]] as her secret advisor in exchange for her sparing the city.

In the {{YearlinkName|1339}}, the renegade drow [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his companions [[Belwar Dissengulp]] and [[Clacker]] were captured and enthralled by illithids and taken to serve as slaves in Phanlinksal. In the confusion, many illithids were killed by their thralls or by the [[zin-carla]] inhabiting the body of [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]], which was seeking Drizzt. The few surviving illithids abandoned the city and fled to their kin in [[Gauntlgrym]].

The abandoned settlement was then inhabited by a [[neothelid]]. The [[Sept Ill'Ghact]], which was founded by [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]] in the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, began using the ruined city as their base. The sept's intention was to create a new elder brain and rebuild the city, but their progress was slow, particularly after Methil was severely injured in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. The sept remained inactive for several decades until it was taken over by the [[ulitharid]] [[Galgast El-Venken]].

By the time of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the sept was firmly entrenched in Phanlinksal and had tamed the neothelid to serve as a guardian. However, to the outside world, the settlement still appeared abandoned.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]]
* [[Galgast|Galgast El-Venken]]
