Blackfeather Barrens was an area of badlands in southeast Faerûn. A kenku-dominated wasteland known for its hostility towards outsiders, it was feared even among the other inhabitants of the Beastlands in the late 14th century DR.
It was a land of fractured plains and desolate canyons. It lay between the monster realms of the Beastlands.
A rookery town of kenkus called Blackfeather was hidden somewhere in the Barrens.
The kenkus of Blackfeather Barrens mercilessly attacked all trespassers.
