        "mainbody": "Xai Chung was a settlement in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur around 1357 DR.\nIt lay on the western side of Kang Bay near the foot of the Vorkani Mountains,\nXai Chung was governed by Meo Yungdo, who also advisor to King Wanang Sun.Meo Yungdo is only stated to be an advisor, but as an important noble based in the city, and because some governors are top advisors to the king, it is assumed that Yungdo is also governor of Xai Chung.\nIt was a rather sedate place, compared to Tu Pe, at least. One road there was Lu Chan Street.\nThe ancestral mansion of the Meo family stood in Xai Chung.\nThe Nikanii bazaar was a market in Xai Chung. On display here in the midâ€“14th century DR was the skeleton of one of the birdmen of the Vorkani Mountains a Koryoan adventurer discovered the bones in the nest of a giant spider he had slain.\nThe bodies of three members of Koryos \"night brotherhoods\" were once found in Lu Chan Street circa 1347 DR, apparently having slain each other for dark secrets.\nAround 1350 DR, the king of Silla ordered \"nameless ones\" of one of these brotherhoods to kidnap Meo Li, the teenage daughter of Meo Yungdo. They swung down from the rooftops, used magic sleep powder on her, and whisked her away from her guards.It is not clear which of the siblings Meo Li and Meo Cha is speaking in the \"Races and Classes\" section on page 124 in the Koryo chapter of Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms. As Meo Chas kidnapping in Tu Pe is slightly different (as mentioned on the same page), it is assumed to be Meo Li. Thus details of her kidnapping and events on Lu Chan Street are assumed to be in Xai Chung, not Tu Pe or Pyong-do."
