        "Description": "The small village was one of many hamlets that were sprinkled along the minor trade route of the Firedrake Road, that bent along the [[Firedrake Shores]], through the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]], and reached the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]]. Toaketh was among more notable hamlets, situated on the crossing of the Firedrake Shores and the road that ran north towards the town of [[Murann]], not far from [[Khalid's Wall]].",
        "History": "The village was named after the [[wizard]] named [[Ildabar Toaketh]], a recluse who was long dead by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], with his humble often-plundered tomb being part of the village. Toaketh's main claim to fame were its ''Toaketh knives'', special never-dulling small blades created by Ildabar Toaketh. The secret of their creation was kept secret by the craftsmen of the village, and the knives were considered [[Mystra]]s blessing to all chefs and cooks of the [[Sword Coast]] and wider [[Faer√ªn]]."
