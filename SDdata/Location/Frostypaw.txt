Frostypaw was a Rengarth city during the time of ancient Netheril.
The city was built on the coast of the western Narrow Sea.
The Rengarth folk hunted the beasts of the tundra around Frostypaws and traded furs, clothes, and other products derived from them.
Founded in , Frostypaw was the main port city of the Rengarth barbarians. Situated far from other settlements on the cold plains, it could only be reached via ship, sled dog, or magical transportation until Netherese magical alterations in the Silver Age ( to ) made the harsh weather more amenable.
As the Netherese took to the sky in their enclaves during the Golden Age ( to ), the Rengarths distrust of magic led to them focusing more on trade with the dwarves of Ascore, and reacted to the approach of flying cities with arrows and javelins. Despite the hostility, the Age of Discovery ( to ) saw an influx of trade with Netheril when pearls and other valuable goods were found in the water a few miles off shore. While the flying enclaves were still driven away, those Netherese who didnt flaunt their magic were allowed in.
The barbarians suffered a schism in  when the local Angardts befriended a Netherese arcanist and began learning arcane magic. While the Angardts were happy to learn magic that could be used against marauding orcs and goblins, their cousins could not countenance the idea and violently expelled the Angardts from their lands over the next seven years.
Towards the end of Netheril, the phaerimms magical attacks led to the weather around Frostypaw returning to its naturally inhospitable state, and most of the Netherese left for warmer climes. Near the time of Karsuss Folly, as the High Ice expanded south and the Narrow Sea dried up, the Rengarth abandoned Frostypaw completely as they migrated west into the Savage North.
