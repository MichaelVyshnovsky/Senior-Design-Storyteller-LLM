The Earthroot was a vast domain in the Underdark.
Since it lay beneath the Unapproachable East—buried deep below Thay and the Sunrise Mountains—few people knew of its existence and even fewer explorers mapped its tunnels and caves.
Located in the Earthroot was the duergar realm of Fraaszummdin and part of the drow city of UndrekThoz. It also harbored the ruins of the ancient empires of Nar, Raumathar, and Imaskar once built in and around the region of the Dust Desert. The most mysterious and greatest hidden realm in the Earthroot was the realm of Deep Imaskar itself. It lay below the Endless Wastes in the most eastern part of the Earthroot.
