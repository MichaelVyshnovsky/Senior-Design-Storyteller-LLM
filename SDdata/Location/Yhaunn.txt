}}'''Yhaunn''' ({{Pronounce|uh|HAWN|refs=}}) was a coastal city of [[Sembia]] built on an ancient quarry site. The oldest city in Sembia, Yhaunn was a small but lively place that was quite different from the other major cities of the realm.

==Description==
Yhaunn was unable to spread out horizontally, and so the city filled the basin with vertical homes and businesses, with three-, four-, and five-story half-timbered buildings the norm, and any sort of green space or garden a true rarity. By decree of the city government, every seventh building was made wholly of stone in order to limit the spread of fires in the densely-packed blocks. The structures had upper levels that built out over the street to win more space, and this architectural environment reached its most extreme form in the [[Stiltways]] district, where the overarching buildings were connected by bridges and walkways, leaving the ground level a damp, shadowed slum, while the upper floors were home to breezy and luxurious clubs and shops.

From the landward approach the city was not visible, with only a lantern-lit glow seemingly emanating from the ground at night. The cliffs around the edges of the city were the abode of high-reaching villas and estates owned by the wealthiest merchants, on safe, well-lit streets festooned with hanging plant-baskets. As the basin sloped down towards the sea, the prosperity also lowered, with the streets becoming darker and the buildings more crowded and over-reaching as the homes intermixed with inns, shops, and sharedoor apartment flats. Much of the portside city were slums or near to it, with only the commercial harbor kept in a proper state of care. The [[Cormyrean]] [[Thentias]] had a great many property investments in Yhaunn, and may have been the most powerful landlord in the city. 

===Society===
The people of Yhaunn had a more relaxed and less pretentious attitude as a whole, preferring tolerance and practicality over the snobbery and manic mercantilism of [[Selgaunt]] and [[Saerloon]],

==Geography==
Yhaunn sat inside a huge, hollowed-out bowl of stone on the edge of the cliff-lined [[Yhauntan Bay]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], the result of centuries of determined quarrying in ages past. The main road out of the city, [[Tildaryn's Ride]] passed west to [[Yuthgalaunt]] and then [[Ordulin]],{{Cite interactive atlas|Sembia}} 

The nearby coast was an austere and threatening stretch of black and brown rocks, cliffs and small jutting islands, with very few sandy beaches or accessible shores.

===Climate===
The coasts around Yhaunn were typically windy all year round, blowing cold winds fairly constantly that whipped up the waves and scoured the cliffs. with only highly-placed locations such as the [[Sky's Mantle]] able to catch the wind. In winter, the low temperatures could freeze stretches of the coast, particularly the shallow tide pools, making it even more hazardous to travelers.

===Flora & Fauna===
The lands around Yhaunn were developed into farmer's fields and pastures, lined with hedgerows and inhabited by creatures such as [[fox]]es, [[mice]], [[badger]]s, and small [[bird]]s. [[Toad]]s and [[frog]]s were relatively common around Yhaunn, and were well-liked by the locals, who considered their croaking songs melodious and recorded them in poetry. They were also appreciated as guard animals of sorts, as they would stop croaking when an intruder approached.

The coasts north and south of the city were generally inhospitable to plant and animal life, with the constant wind and waves scouring the seaside rocks thoroughly, though it became less harsh to the south near [[Selgaunt]].

==Government==
The city was ostensibly governed by the [[Nessarch]], a mayoral figure elected by the Fives Council who then ruled for life. As of [[1358 DR]], the Nessarch was [[Andilal Tharimpar]], a retired adventurer. He maintained this position through the tumultuous events of [[1374 DR]]. The city was in practice run by the Fives Council, a council made up of the first 75 property-owning merchants to enter the chambers during session who managed to get seated at the 15 five-seater round tables there.

A small community of [[merfolk]] lived nearby in Yhauntan Bay, typically staying isolated from the surface, though younger members were interested in increased contact and trade. They were threatened by [[sahuagin]], who were considered unusual for lairing so far north in colder waters.

==Trade==
Yhaunn emerged before [[Dalereckoning]] as a seaside stone quarry, where fine stone was cut from the cliffside for use elsewhere around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Many large buildings in [[Alaghôn]], [[Cimbar]], [[Saerloon]], [[Selgaunt]], [[Westgate]], and [[Velprintalar]] were built with Yhauntan stone, including a monument likely built by [[Kergaard Twinblade]] of Westgate around {{Yearlink|-50}}.

Through the 14{{th}} century, Yhaunn was a major port and merchant's delight, exporting manufactured goods such as [[textile]]s, [[wicker]]work, and [[brick]]s, with the [[Glasscrafter's Hall]] supporting the skilled artisans that made its famous [[glass]]ware. Distinctive among the Sembian ports, Yhaunn was the gateway for goods passing between the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and the [[Dalelands]], as well as serving as the primary port for Ordulin.

The harsh winds and rocky cliffs along the coast resulted in little coastal settlement near Yhaunn, with only a few scattered fishers among the land-facing farmers and view-seeking estate-holders. Piracy was a somewhat common occupation practiced on the limited landing spots, though not necessarily a profitable one. Large-scale [[fish]]ing was still practiced from Yhaunn, with the waters south of it fished intensively.

Yhaunn remained an important trade port and economic power through the 15{{th}} century DR, despite the disasters of the [[Spellplague]] and the domination of [[Thultanthar]]an [[Netheril]] over Sembia. Yhaunn served as a vital link to the world for Netheril, bringing the most cunning merchants there astounding wealth, while the general population supplied Netheril's demand for expendable labor and sword-arms for its imperialistic projects.

==Defenses==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Yhaunn kept a garrison force of 3,000 city guards, a formation of experienced veteran soldiers called "watchblades" who defended the city, policed the streets, and enforced justice within its walls. They were well-equipped with [[plate armor]] and typically bore [[halberd]]s, [[longsword]]s, [[mace]]s, and [[dagger]]s. The guard force also patrolled the waters around Yhaunn with a small naval detachment of 9 proper warships from the main Sembian navy.

The city walls were built along the top of the cliffs to the edge of the sea, with only a single main gate. The [[Road Gate]] was built into the [[Roadkeep]] castle that also served as the headquarters of the city guard and general secure location for the city's governance.

==History==
The earliest known human settlers in the region were [[Jhaamdath]]an refugees that colonized [[the Dalelands]] in the second century before [[Dalereckoning]]. The settlement grew from an ancient quarry and dock that was in use as early as {{Yearlink|-50}}, more than four centuries before the founding of [[Chancelgaunt]] and [[Saerloon]]. As a minor note of interest, Yhaunn came to be unique among these old cities of Sembia, as the others changed their names over time from the original [[Chondathan]] settler names, while Yhaunn remained unchanged.

Around [[1307 DR]], the wizard [[Zrie Prakis]] destroyed a tavern in Yhaunn with ''[[fireball]]s'', as it unwittingly used his personal sigil for its street sign.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], the breakdown of the [[Weave]] caused a [[dead-magic zone]] to form in one of the city's old mines. The zone lasted indefinitely afterwards, and the magically-bereft tunnels were turned into the prison known as [[the Hole]].

Around the mid-14{{th}} century DR, [[sahuagin]] posed as the local [[merfolk]] and raided the surface near Yhaunn. An investigation by [[Lucas Surin]] uncovered the truth of the matter and prevented hostilities between the Sembians and merfolk. Around the same period, a mysterious merchant travelled around nearby [[Surd]], selling stolen sahuagin artifacts. Though no friends of the sharkmen, the people of Surd, Yhaunn and [[Tulbegh]] offered rewards for the capture of the merchant, believing he was antagonizing the sahuagin into hostilities with the surface.

On [[Eleasis 15]] of [[1373 DR]], [[Moonshadow Hall]] and the [[Stiltways]] came under attack by the forces of the local [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|temple of Shar]] as part of a plan by the [[Thultanthar]]an [[shade]] [[Variance Amatick]]. Several priests were killed, but the [[Sharran]] cell was located and captured by the city's guard forces.

During the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the agents of Thultanthar worked to destabilize Sembia into a civil war, and Yhaunn aligned with Overmistress [[Mirabeta Selkirk]] and Ordulin. On [[Uktar 11]], [[Erevis Cale]] and his fellows raided the Hole in order to rescue [[Endren Corrinthal]] while the city's forces were distracted by a [[kraken]] controlled by [[Rivalen Tanthul]]. The kraken killed over a thousand people and destroyed much of the lower city before being driven off, crippling Yhaunn's ability to host ships. The city survived the [[Shadowstorm]] that destroyed Ordulin, and in the following years fell under the control of Netheril along with the rest of Sembia.

In [[1385 DR]], during the [[Spellplague]], the cliffs that surrounded the city broke away and became [[earthmote]]s, in the process killing nearly ten thousand inhabitants, and raising a number of floating islands above the city that later became the [[Air District]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1420}}, mercenaries from Yhaunn struck forth at [[Tasseldale]] after more subtle means failed, bloodily conquering the dale and bringing it under Sembian control.

The [[Shadovar]] masters of Sembia helped the city recover from the ravages of the [[Wailing Years]], and by [[1479 DR]] it had fully recovered and had even more residents than before the Spellplague.

==Organizations==
The [[Harpers]] were relatively powerful in Yhaunn in the mid-14{{th}} century DR, working with the Fives Council to drive out illicit groups such as gangs, slavers, smugglers and other criminals. Attempts by the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Cult of the Dragon]] to gain footholds in the city led to somewhat frequent battles between small bands of each faction's fighters.

==Rumors & Legends==
The [[Lurker in the Shallows]] was a mysterious, unknown aquatic creature reputed to lurk nearby in [[Yhauntan Bay]]. Guesses ranged from a [[morkoth]], sea [[dragon]], or [[eye of the deep]], but all agreed that it had a lair filled with fabulous treasures that was confounding hard to find.

A mysterious ship crewed by [[zombie]]s sailed the waters east of Yhaunn in the 14{{th}} century DR, accompanied by an undead [[giant octopus]].
