Malars Throat was a ward of the coastal city of Port Nyanzaru in Chult that lay outside the city walls. It was a slum where the citys poorest residents lived in dilapidated buildings stacked upon one another running along the walls of a ravine. It was a gritty contrast to the vibrancy of the wards that lay within the walls.
Malars Throat served as a southern entrance to the walled areas of the city by way of a gate known as Ubtaos Jaws. The district comprised a jungle-draped ravine extending south, with rows of small, rundown buildings of old wood and stone which clung to the steep-sloped ridges, often with each structures roof serving as the floor of the one above it. Narrow and often muddy footpaths lined the sides of the ravines, but the major walkways were the many swaying footbridges that crisscrossed the ravine&mdashsome over  in the air&mdashto connect all levels of the district. These bridges were made of bamboo lashed together with rope and treated with strong smelling pitch and oil. The largest bridges were  wide and over  in length.
Owing to the high walls of the ravine and the jungle trees above, Malars Throat was darker and cooler&mdashalthough no less humid&mdashthan the rest of Port Nyanzaru. Even during the day, some parts of the district were lit only by speckles of light filtering through the jungle canopy.
The floor of the ravine would flood during heavy rains, creating runoff that streamed through Ubtaos Jaws and into the Port Nyanzaru harbor (often carrying away any unattended baskets, refuse, and even the occasional person).
Those wishing to circumvent the trade monopolies of Port Nyanzarus merchant princes could find black markets in Malars Throat. Finding a black market buyer or seller was as simple as asking the right questions to the right people, and it usually took about a half day to track down a new blackmarketeer. However, black market dealings were harshly punished by the Ytepka Society, so any such venture was risky.
Malars Throat was prone to attacks by jungle monsters&mdashnotably undead, pterafolk, and grungs and abutted the Chultan jungles at its furthest end. or to the Temple of Tymora.
Temple of Tymora While the Tymoran faithful of Port Nyanzaru didnt consider themselves particularly fortuitous, they still revered the Lady of Luck.
The Satchel Shop This leather goods store sold a suspicious number of satchels, some specially designed for smugglers.

Malars Throat was home to Port Nyzanzarus poorest residents. and while visitors could find the sensory overload of the peculiar slum to be unsettling or overwhelming, its inhabitants were more than accustomed to it. Among those who made their homes in the district were so-called "fisherlings" thieves who would drop fishing hooks from the high bridges to expertly steal purses right off the belts of unsuspecting visitors.
During the colonial rule of Amn over Port Nyanzaru, Malars Throat was among the districts where people had to live if they did not work for a major trading company.
