'''Malar's Throat''' was a ward of the coastal city of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] that lay outside the city walls. It was a slum where the city's poorest residents lived in dilapidated buildings stacked upon one another running along the walls of a ravine.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|5}} It was a gritty contrast to the vibrancy of the wards that lay within the walls.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|24}}

==Description==
Malar's Throat served as a southern entrance to the walled areas of the city by way of a gate known as [[Ubtao's Jaws]]. The district comprised a jungle-draped ravine extending south, with rows of small, rundown buildings of old wood and stone which clung to the steep-sloped ridges, often with each structure's roof serving as the floor of the one above it.{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|6}} Narrow and often muddy footpaths lined the sides of the ravines,{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|5}} but the major walkways were the many swaying footbridges that crisscrossed the ravine&mdash;some over {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} in the air&mdash;to connect all levels of the district. These bridges were made of [[bamboo]] lashed together with [[rope]] and treated with strong smelling [[pitch]] and [[oil]]. The largest bridges were {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} wide and over {{SI|200|feet|long=yes}} in length.

Owing to the high walls of the ravine and the jungle trees above, Malar's Throat was darker and cooler&mdash;although no less humid&mdash;than the rest of Port Nyanzaru. Even during the day, some parts of the district were lit only by speckles of light filtering through the jungle canopy.

The floor of the ravine would flood during heavy rains, creating runoff that streamed through Ubtao's Jaws and into the Port Nyanzaru harbor (often carrying away any unattended [[basket]]s, refuse, and even the occasional person).

==Trade==
Those wishing to circumvent the trade monopolies of Port Nyanzaru's [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] could find black markets in Malar's Throat. Finding a black market buyer or seller was as simple as asking the right questions to the right people, and it usually took about a half day to track down a new blackmarketeer. However, black market dealings were harshly punished by the [[Ytepka Society]], so any such venture was risky.

==Defenses==
Malar's Throat was prone to attacks by jungle monsters&mdash;notably [[undead]], [[pterafolk]], and [[grung]]s and abutted the Chultan jungles at its furthest end. or to the [[Temple of Tymora (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple of Tymora]].

==Notable Locations==
:;[[Temple of Tymora (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple of Tymora]]: While the [[Tymora]]n faithful of Port Nyanzaru didn't consider themselves particularly fortuitous, they still revered the Lady of Luck.
:;The [[Satchel Shop]]: This [[leather]] goods store sold a suspicious number of [[satchel]]s, some specially designed for smugglers.{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|7}}
:;[[Ubtao's Jaws]]: The gate that connected the ground level of the ravine to the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] and [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]] of Port Nyanzaru.

==Inhabitants==
Malar's Throat was home to Port Nyzanzaru's poorest residents. and while visitors could find the sensory overload of the peculiar slum to be unsettling or overwhelming, its inhabitants were more than accustomed to it. Among those who made their homes in the district were so-called "[[fisherling]]s": thieves who would drop [[fishing hook]]s from the high bridges to expertly steal purses right off the belts of unsuspecting visitors.

During the colonial rule of [[Amn]] over Port Nyanzaru, Malar's Throat was among the districts where people had to live if they did not work for a major trading company.<ref name=FRCG-p102>
