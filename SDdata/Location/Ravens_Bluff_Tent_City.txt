Tent City, also known as Tent Town, was a sprawling tent community outside of the North Gate of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR. It was considered by some to be an unofficial district of the city.
The communitys name derived from it being largely made up of canvas or brightly-dyed silk tents. It was also host to corrals, stalls, and a few permanent structures. Many of the tents had wooden plank walkways between them.
The Cross Road, the road connected Tantras and Mossbridges to Ravens Bluffs North Gate, cut right through the center of Tent City. A smaller, less impressive gate was situated on the road to mark the outer boundary of Tent City.
Tent City was host to a variety of different merchants, vendors, and ware hawkers.

When The Three Women War ravaged the Vast countryside, those who had the money to do so moved into Ravens Bluff, hoping to wait out the conflict. Eventually bands of thieves moved into Tent City and began using it as a staging ground for their raids on Ravens Bluff.
The many vendors that once did business in Tent City were sent overflowing into both the Market District and the Torchtown neighborhood of the Uptown District, seizing vacant rooms in many of the citys abandoned buildings. The residents with money filled Ravens Bluffs one-story cottages, causing such overcrowding that they were eventually torn down in favor of constructing taller structures. Others found homes in the rundown buildings along the docks and the banks of Fire River. The more destitute of the displaced had little choice but to sleep in the citys alleys or upon its rooftops.
