'''Tent City''',{{Cite organized play/LC/The Purrfect Opportunity|2}} also known as '''Tent Town''',{{Cite organized play/LC/The Laws of Luck|18-19}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Vengeance|27}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Housecleaning II: Mission of Mercy|26}} was a sprawling [[tent]] community outside of the [[North Gate (Ravens Bluff)|North Gate]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/86/The Living City: Friar Cookpot|6}} It was considered by some to be an unofficial district of the city.

==Description==
The community's name derived from it being largely made up of [[canvas]] or brightly-[[dye]]d [[silk]] tents.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/84/The Living City: Traagor's Tours and Souvenir Shop|13}} It was also host to corrals,<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Stop the Pack Train|3}} stalls,{{Cite polyhedron/86/The Living City: Friar Cookpot|6}} and a few permanent structures.{{Cite organized play/LC/Going Home|3}} Many of the tents had wooden plank walkways between them.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Boy and His Mammoth|8}}

The [[Cross Road]], the road connected [[Tantras]] and [[Mossbridges]] to Ravens Bluff's North Gate, cut right through the center of Tent City. A smaller, less impressive gate was situated on the road to mark the outer boundary of Tent City.{{Cite organized play/LC/At Last, Ravens Bluff|6-7}}

==Trade==
Tent City was host to a variety of different merchants, vendors, and ware hawkers.

==History==
In the spring of {{Yearlink|1355}},<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/At Last, Ravens Bluff|2}}No firm date is present in any of the versions of ''At Last, Ravens Bluff''. The ages of certain NPCs in ''[[Counterfeit Dreams]]'', which is set a few weeks later, agree with sourcebooks such as ''[[Gateway to Ravens Bluff, the Living City]]'' (which is set in 1355 DR) and ''[[Inside Ravens Bluff, the Living City]]'' (which can also be surmised to be set in 1355 DR). For more information, see [[User:Ir'revrykal/LC timeline/Adventures#At Last, Ravens Bluff|here]]. the notorious con artist [[illusionist]] [[Mortimer Mittlemer]] was running a scam outside Tent City's gate with his wife [[Marilyn Mittlemer|Marilyn]] and associate [[Elmerth Willowit]], impersonating a [[City Guard (Ravens Bluff)|City Guardsmen]] and shaking down newcomers for 10 [[gold piece]]s in return for "permits" to enter Ravens Bluff, as well as smaller fees for keeping their weapons or [[horse]]s.

When [[The Three Women War]] ravaged the [[Vast]] countryside, those who had the money to do so moved into Ravens Bluff, hoping to wait out the conflict.{{Cite organized play/LC/Attention Shoppers|14}} Eventually bands of [[thieves]] moved into Tent City and began using it as a staging ground for their raids on Ravens Bluff.

The many vendors that once did business in Tent City were sent overflowing into both the [[Ravens Bluff/Market District|Market District]] and the [[Torchtown]] neighborhood of the [[Uptown District (Ravens Bluff)|Uptown District]], seizing vacant rooms in many of the city's abandoned buildings. The residents with money filled Ravens Bluff's one-story cottages, causing such overcrowding that they were eventually torn down in favor of constructing taller structures. Others found homes in the rundown buildings along the docks and the banks of [[Fire River]]. The more destitute of the displaced had little choice but to sleep in the city's alleys or upon its rooftops.

Many felt that Tent City would never return, with the Three Womens War having demonstrated the superior safety of life behind Ravens Bluff's walls.{{Cite organized play/LC/Going Home|3}} Residents slowly trickled back in following its reconstruction,{{Cite organized play/LC/The Laws of Luck|18-19}}

==Notable Locations==
* The [[A.V.O.W. shelter]], a permanent structure and animal shelter that was established after the Three Women War with the hope of finding homes for all the animals that lost their owners during the conflict.{{Cite organized play/LC/Going Home|3}}
* The [[Dancing Bear inn]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Hero Takes a Fall|4}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Stolen Property|10}}
* [[Marigold's Menagerie]], a permanent structure animal shelter and animal training center.{{Cite polyhedron/97/The Living City: The Hand of Mercy and Marigold's Menagerie|10}}{{Cite organized play/LC/The Purrfect Opportunity|2}} It managed to remain standing followed the forced dismantling of Tent City, due in part to its use by a band of thieves.

==Inhabitants==
Tent City was a tight-knit community whose population fluctuated with the seasons, usually peaking during the summer months.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Laws of Luck|18-19}} with many beggars working the crowds that passed through.{{Cite organized play/LC/Crawl|2}}

Residents were suspicious of non-residents, though not hostile or rude.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Laws of Luck|19}} most of the time unwilling to offer up information freely.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Amy-Sue]], a destitute child.
* [[Zorbano|Madame Zorbano]], a fortune teller, lived there in a tent of fine purple silk that was festooned with silvery moons and stars and topped with a yellow pennant.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Friend of a Friend|3}}
* [[Mather Sagra]], a man that was skilled in providing people disguises.
* Tent town was among the places that the roving street vendor [[Friar Cookpot]] frequented.
