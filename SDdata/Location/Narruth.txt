Narruth was a small island located within the Land of the Lions region of South Faerûn.
Narruth lay in the northwest corner of the Lake of Steam west of Mintar and north of the island of Olodel.
The island served as the base and home for a group of warrior-merchants called the Baldovans. The Baldovans operated their own trading coster from the island. The group did not welcome uninvited visitors.
