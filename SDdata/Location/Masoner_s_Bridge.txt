'''Masoner's Bridge''' was the name of the crossing over the [[Immerflow]] on the [[East Way]] in [[Cormyr]], just before the road entered [[Hullack Forest]].

==Notable Locations==
Close to Masoner's Bridge, on a wooded hillside, was a small mausoleum built of stone that housed the bones of one [[Chancsozbur]], a man who'd once foolishly tried to swindle [[Manshoon]] of the [[Zhentarim]] some time in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The tomb was built by Lord [[Chess]] of [[Zhentil Keep]], who, on Manshoon's orders, seized Chancsozbur's holdings and sold them off to fund the construction, then had his men slay Chancsozbur's kin when they came. Thereafter, the Zhentarim controlled the tomb and used the upper level as a smuggling waystation, whilst Manshoon stored some of his [[clone]]s in the lower level. Chancsozbur's stone coffin could be rotated to give access to the lower level.<ref>
