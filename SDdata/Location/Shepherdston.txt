'''Shepherdston''' was a small village of [[sheep|shepherds]] and [[cow|dairy]] farmers in southern [[Amn]].

==Geography==
The village was about halfway between [[Esmeltaran]] and [[Imnescar]] along the [[Imnescourse Trail]], solidly in the [[Dauntir]] region.

==History==
Sherpherdston was formerly an important caravan stop on the road between [[Esmeltaran]] and [[Murann]], but that faded when the realm's capital moved to [[Athkatla]]. It became a surprisingly common place in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] for [[Tethyr's Court|Tethyrian nobles]] to hide out during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|civil wars]] of the country, though the noble exiles never stayed for long as they feared that they would be pursued and found at Shepherdston, though it never actually happened. It was common hearsay in the village that the nobles had hidden their caches of treasure in the nearby [[Umar Hills]], with few of them returning to collect the goods.
