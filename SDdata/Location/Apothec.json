        "mainbody": "Apothec was an ancient Netherese realm that prospered for a time until it was destroyed by the plagues of Moander.\nThe realm lay in southeast Netheril near the Desertsmouth Mountains, along the Pox River which flowed from Moanders Footstep.\nThe Apothecs shared a common ancestry with the Netherese people, but eschewed the use of magic in favor of herbalism, medicine, and other more natural cures for ailments. They enjoyed good relations with the Netherese, and heavily traded with each other.\nIn , Moander tainted the Pox River with a lethal and virulent plague. The Apothecs were unable to resist it, and they were completely wiped out. Though they ceased to exist, the term \"apothecary\" came to be commonly used in the Realms for all those who made medicines and cures."
