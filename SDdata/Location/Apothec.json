        "Geography": "The realm lay in southeast [[Netheril]] near the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], along the [[Pox River]] which flowed from [[Moander's Footstep]].",
        "History": "The Apothecs shared a common ancestry with the Netherese people, but eschewed the use of magic in favor of [[herb]]alism, medicine, and other more natural cures for ailments. They enjoyed good relations with the Netherese, and heavily traded with each other.\n\nIn {{yearlinkConvert|2105|NY}}, Moander tainted the Pox River with a lethal and virulent plague. The Apothecs were unable to resist it, and they were completely wiped out. Though they ceased to exist, the term \"[[apothecary]]\" came to be commonly used in the [[Realms]] for all those who made medicines and cures."
