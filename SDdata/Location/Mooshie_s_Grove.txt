'''Mooshie's Grove''' was the home of [[Montolio Debrouchee]] ("Mooshie") and was a diamond-shaped grove of trees and piled stone walls in the [[Rauvin Mountains]] near the [[Coldwood]].

==Structure==
The grove featured elevated walkways and beautifully designed huts. It was surrounded by tall [[pine]]s and emitted a magical aura.

==History==

===Drizzt===
Mooshie's grove was the site of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]'s [[ranger]] training.

===Pikel===
As a test, the [[elf]] [[Tarathiel]] took [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]], the [[dwarf]] [[druid]] from the [[Spirit Soaring]], to the grove, where they encountered a [[unicorn]], symbolic of the nature goddess [[Mielikki]]. Pikel befriended the unicorn, and Tarathiel considered him to have passed the test.
