Mooshies Grove was the home of Montolio Debrouchee ("Mooshie") and was a diamond-shaped grove of trees and piled stone walls in the Rauvin Mountains near the Coldwood.
The grove featured elevated walkways and beautifully designed huts. It was surrounded by tall pines and emitted a magical aura.

Mooshies grove was the site of Drizzt DoUrdens ranger training.
As a test, the elf Tarathiel took Pikel Bouldershoulder, the dwarf druid from the Spirit Soaring, to the grove, where they encountered a unicorn, symbolic of the nature goddess Mielikki. Pikel befriended the unicorn, and Tarathiel considered him to have passed the test.
