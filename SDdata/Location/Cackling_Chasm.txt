The Cackling Chasm was a deep canyon found in Icewind Dale that was home to a vicious pack of gnolls in the late 15 century DR.
The chasm had a feasting area where the gnolls fed, that was filled with bones of all manner of animals including elk, reindeer, and even other gnolls.
The chasm was located in the northern foothills of the Spine of the World mountains.
The gnolls were originally led to the chasm by the Fang of Yeenoghu, Chyzka. Unfortunately they arrived to the region during the Everlasting Rime and were found little opportunities to feed within the raging snows.
Some time during the , the gnolls managed to capture and imprison a chardalyn berserker who wandered too far close to their den.
That same year, Chyzka and other gnolls managed to slay Nabira Moarskull of Easthaven, and recover her fishpole. 
Speaker Trovus of Caer-Konig saw the gnolls of the Cackling Chasm as a grave threat to the people of his community. He was ready to place a bounty out for each gnoll head that was brought back to him. 
While many of the gnolls of the pack feared Chyzka, they hardly shared any loyalty for one another.
