The '''Cackling Chasm''' was a deep canyon found in [[Icewind Dale]] that was home to a vicious pack of [[gnoll]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The chasm had a feasting area where the gnolls fed, that was filled with bones of all manner of animals including [[elk]], [[reindeer]], and even other gnolls.

==Geography==
The chasm was located in the northern foothills of the [[Spine of the World]] mountains.

==History==
The gnolls were originally led to the chasm by the [[Fang of Yeenoghu]], [[Chyzka]]. Unfortunately they arrived to the region during the ''[[Everlasting Rime]]'' and were found little opportunities to feed within the raging snows.

Some time during the {{yearlinkName|1489}}, the gnolls managed to capture and imprison a [[chardalyn berserker]] who wandered too far close to their den.

That same year, Chyzka and other gnolls managed to slay [[Nabira Moarskull]] of [[Easthaven]], and recover her ''[[fishpole]]''. 

==Rumors & Legends==
Speaker [[Trovus]] of [[Caer-Konig]] saw the gnolls of the Cackling Chasm as a grave threat to the people of his community. He was ready to place a bounty out for each gnoll head that was brought back to him. 

==Inhabitants==
While many of the gnolls of the pack feared Chyzka, they hardly shared any loyalty for one another.
