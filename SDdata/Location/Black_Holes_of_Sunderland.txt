'''The Black Holes of Sunderland''', also called simply '''the''' '''Black Holes''', were a region along the slopes of the southern [[Galena Mountains]] of [[Vaasa]] pocked with monster-infested caves.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Description==
The Black Holes were notorious for having one of the densest populations of unfriendly beasts and monsters in Vaasa, making its proximity to the farming and mining communities of the heavily populated [[Sunderland]] a central reason why the [[Vaasan]] people were known to be always ready for a fight. During the rule of King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] of [[Damara]], the Black Holes became a popular destination for adventurers and mercenaries seeking to claim the generous bounties posted on the Holes' monstrous inhabitants.

==Geography==
The Black Holes lay in the slopes of the Galena Mountains at the southern edge of the Sunderland grasslands.

===Geographical Features===
The caves that comprised the Black Holes were varied in terms of size and depth. Some were shallow and just large enough for a monster to hide within, while others were deep and part of an interconnected network of caverns leading to the [[Moondeep Sea]] in the [[Underdark]], while still others were said to be tunnels that stretched as far as [[Damara]] or [[Thar]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

===Flora & Fauna===
Local monsters used the Holes for shelter from the harsh Vaasan winters, making them into lairs and nests. [[Goblinoids]] and [[giant|giantkin]] were common, and [[leucrotta]], [[owlbear]]s, and [[quaggoth]]s were not unheard of.

==History==
While the Black Holes had always been dangerous, they became even more perilous after the defeat of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, when the remnants of his monstrous armies were said to have fled to the caves to regroup.

Among the stragglers of Zhengyi's forces was the [[Cult of the Goat's Head]], a group dedicated to the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]] that was once led by Zhengyi himself. Their presence drew the attention of [[drow]] faithful of [[Kiaransalee]] dwelling in [[V'elddrinnsshar]] deep below the Black Holes, who began launching attacks against this cult to their goddess's rival. Within a decade, they had nearly wiped out the Orcus worshipers, and inadvertently provided a great service to the surface-dwellers of Vaasa and Damara (who mistook the drow for Zhengian allies if they ever came across them).

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], one of the rising threats from within the Black Holes was a tribe of deranged quaggoths who worshiped The Render, an aspect of [[Malar]] more commonly venerated as the Bear God of the [[Great Glacier]].
