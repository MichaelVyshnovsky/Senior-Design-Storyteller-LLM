Immediately north of the city were rich [[iron]] mines. Immediately south of the city were terraced rice fields.\n\n[[Tawata Road]] connected Rukimbaru to [[Uwaji]] in the south, and another road led north from Rukimbaru to [[Chozawa]].",
        "Government": "The [[daimyo]] of the city in [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]] was [[Matasuuri Kimmu]].\n\nThe military governor during the same year was [[Tekinjo Yojairo]]. Yojairo's role was to act as an intermediary between the emperor and the [[shogun]].",
        "Defenses": "The military forces present to defend the city at any time included 850 mounted [[samurai]], 400 additional samurai on foot, and 100 [[sohei]].",
        "Trade": "Rukimbaru had a very strong and diverse economy. There were industrial districts that produced textiles, works of art, and tools. Traditional artisan's secrets were passed down from generation to generation here, which meant that the city was known for the best furniture, jewelry, and lacquerware. Rukimbaru was also especially known for the production of the best [[sake]] in the empire.\n\nFrom Rukimbaru's thriving ports sailed daily [[silk]], [[rice]], and all manner of vegetables.",
        "History": "At one time in history, Rukimbaru was the capital of Wa.",
        "Notable Locations": "Rukimbaru was full of museums, schooling centers, and temples, some of which were the oldest shrines in existence on [[Toril]]. Among the most notable schools was the [[Shinobugaoaka]], a major university, which housed the greatest library in Wa.\n\nThe city was also noted for its many beautiful [[tea]] gardens (''[[rojo]]''), placed far from the commercial centers for peacefulness.\n\nThe most notable site was of course the [[Imperial Palace]], the mansion palace of the emperor and his relatives, which was carved from white stone with pink latticework.",
        "Inhabitants": "Besides the emperor's family, the military governor and multiple deputies of the shogun resided in the city.\n\nThe culture of Rukimbaru's citizens was among the most traditional of all Wanese cities.\n\nBesides the emperor, among the more notable of Rukimbaru's inhabitants were:\n* [[Hosigawa Orie]], a [[monk]] and author, who wrote epic tales about powerful [[samurai]] and beautiful [[geisha]]s,\n* [[Jutei-Ni]], Daimyo Kimmu's wife,\n* [[Kisha Yunoko]], the emperor's young concubine, and\n* [[Osari Toyo]], a deputy to the [[Wa-an dictionary#H|''hatamoto'']]."
