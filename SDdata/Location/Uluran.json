        "mainbody": "luran was a mountainous county in Kamlann in Tethyr.\nUluran also went by the names Shepherds County, since most of its inhabitants were shepherds, and the Tomb Hills, since most of the royalty of Tethyr were buried somewhere underneath its mountains. The latter tradition came about to prevent the looting of the graves of the royal families.\nIn addition to shepherds, many among the population of Uluran were hunters and trappers.\nThis long and narrow county of Kamlann was occupied primarily by the Starspire Mountains. To its west, on the Starspire Peninsula was its sister county of Starspur. To its north was the great forest of Wealdath, while across the Sulduskoon River to the south were the Purple Marches and the Crown Lands.\nHawkwings Brook, a tributary of the Sulduskoon, divided the county&mdashand the Starspire Mountains&mdashin two.\nBy 1370 DR, former member of Company of Eight, Silvanus Moondrop, ruled Uluran from his county seat at Uluran Keep."
