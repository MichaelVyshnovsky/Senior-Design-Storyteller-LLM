        "mainbody": "The '''Wall''' was a structure that separated the [[Protector's Enclave]] of [[Neverwinter]] from the [[Chasm]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The Wall was built with stone, wood, and other materials taken from the debris of Neverwinter. It stretched from the [[Neverdeath]] graveyard to the [[House of Knowledge]] and the [[Neverwinter River]].\n\nThe Wall was manned by the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. Outposts across the Wall always had at least ten guards watching them, and groups of soldiers and mercenaries constantly patrolled the Wall to one end to the other, day and night.",
        "History": "The Wall was built after the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in [[1451 DR]], when survivors determined that they needed an effective way to protect themselves from the [[plaguechanged]] creatures spawned from the Chasm. The Wall was built using debris and other materials, and initially it was patrolled by the survivors themselves.\n\nIn [[1463 DR]], the Wall withstood an assault by [[undead]] sent by [[Sylora Salm]] of [[Thay]].\n\nWhen [[Dagult Neverember]] arrived in Neverwinter, he saw the Wall's effectiveness and hired engineers and workers to reinforce it. He also appointed a few of his [[Mintarn]] mercenaries to watch the Wall alongside the civilian volunteers.\n\nDuring the decade of the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]], after the Chasm was sealed, Neverember ordered the Wall to be torn down."
