'''Alatorin''' was the ancient dwarven settlement formed when [[Taark Shanat]]'s [[dwarves]] defeated the inhabitants of [[Rringlor Noroth]] in the [[Cloaker Wars]], including four [[blue dragon]]s slain by Taark himself. It was the first settlement established in [[Shanatar]] and contained [[Brightaxe Hall]] and the famous [[Wyrmskull Throne]].

==History==
Alatorin was founded at the end of the Cloaker Wars when Taark Shanat's dwarves claimed the caverns for themselves. It was captured by the [[drow]] of [[Guallidurth]] during the [[First Spider War]] ({{Yearlink|-8170}} to {{Yearlink|-8150}}), at which time the eight kingdoms of Shanatar allied to reclaim it.

The [[Second Spider War]] in {{Yearlink|-8145}} saw the dwarves reclaim Alatorin from the drow, but the drow attacked again in the [[Third Spider War]] around {{Yearlink|-6150}}. This conflict lasted around thirty years, with the eventual victory of the drow. Alatorin was evacuated by the dwarves (who took the Wyrmskull Throne with them).
