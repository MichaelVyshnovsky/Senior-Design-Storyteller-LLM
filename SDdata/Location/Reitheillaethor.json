        "mainbody": "'''Reitheillaethor''' or '''Rheitheillaethor''' ({{Pronounce|RHY|thigh|WAY|eh|thor}}) was a [[wood elf]] village located within the [[High Forest]] in [[the North]]. For some of its history it existed as a winter retreat for the forest's [[elves]], a place for them to take up seasonal residence before continuing their nomadic ways in the warmer months of the year. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] however, it became part of something larger, one of the first communities of the High Forest that strove to revive a long-lost elven empire.",
        "Description": "The village comprised numerous naturalistic buildings and shelters that appeared to grow out of the roots and trees of the forest floor. Seven outer structures encircled a central, white [[marble]] lodge built within the space formed by four great [[oak]] trees. \n\nSmaller, temporary shelters such as huts, lean-tos, and tents surrounded this prominent arrangement, The weirwoods of Reitheillaethor were magically protected against fire. \n\nThe village boasted a sculpture carved by the famous [[stone giant]] artist [[Aris (giant)|Aris]], depicting [[human]]s and elves dancing together in celebration and glee.",
        "Geography": "It was situated on the bank of the [[Heartblood River]], just beyond the borders of the [[Dire Wood]] east of the ruins of [[Karse]].",
        "Government": {
            "Relationships": "The elves of the village maintained an amiable relationship with the nearby [[treant]] community.\n\nGuests of the elves were free to enter or leave the village as they wished, provided they did not endanger its safety in any way."
        },
        "Trade": "Reitheillaethor elves had the reputation as being expert hunters, foragers, fishers, and craftspeople. They were known to sculpt strong and highly sought-after [[clay]] pots that fetched a good price in local markets.",
        "Defenses": "In order to maintain its strong defenses, patrols were assigned to watch over the eastern reaches of the High Forest and keep watch over the nearby Dire Wood.",
        "History": "As of the [[Era of Upheaval]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Reitheillaethor was considered to be one of the elven peoples' youngest settlements within the High Forest.\n\nOn [[Ches 1]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Rheitheillaethor was attacked by [[daemonfey]] and [[orc]]s under their control. The combined forces overwhelmed the village's defenses and drove out its guardspeople.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Lady Morgwais had united her village with those of [[Nordahaeril]] and [[Teuveamanthaar]] with the hopes of uniting all the tribes of the High Forest and restoring the kingdom of [[Eaerlann]].",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* Lady [[Morgwais]], ruler of the village and the wood elves of the High Forest.\n* Lady [[Jaementhe]], another authority figure.\n* Captain [[Hulrune Silverbow]], leader of the guard.\n* [[Gaerradh]], an elf ranger and scout in the High Forest.\n* [[Fomoyn]], a xenophobic [[orc]]-hunter."
