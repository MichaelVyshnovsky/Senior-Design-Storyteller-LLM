'''Quill Ward''' was one of the seven central wards of the city of [[Calimport]], the center of much of the city's administrative activities, and a gathering place for sages, scholars, and scribes.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

==Description==
Quill Ward had the largest concentration of libraries in Calimport. Most of these were not public but were private collections, but there were a few notable exceptions. Because of all the studious activity, it was one of the quietest areas of the city. Its inns and boarding homes were peaceful places to stay.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
[[File:Quill Ward location.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''A map of the city of [[Calimport]], with Quill Ward highlighted in red.'']]
Quill Ward was located north of [[Calimport/Wizard Ward|Wizard Ward]],<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 /><ref name=Calimport-p29> and it also bordered [[Calimpor/Grand Ward|Grand Ward]] on the west, [[Calimport/Khanduq Ward|Khanduq Ward]] and [[Calimport/Hammer Ward|Hammer Ward]] on the north, and [[Calimport/Crypt Ward|Crypt Ward]] on the east. A tiny stretch of its Hikaya Drudach bordered [[Calimport/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] in the southwest.<ref name=Calimport-p29 />

==Government==
The ruler of the ward was [[Sultan]] [[Abbas el Quaahl|Abbas yn Akkabar el Quaahl]], who was also a [[vizar]] to [[Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]], having followed him to Calimport from [[Manshaka]] during the latter's rise to power. A ruthlessly evil man, many feared him as much as the syl-pasha.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

Abbas' son [[Malik el Quaahl|Malik]] ran most of the administrative operations of the ward. While he ran the ward honestly, he was an exceptionally gifted forger, and used his skills to frame his enemies.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

==Defenses==
This district of the city had a special defense unique to it. It was surrounded by a powerful magical ward that granted several powerful effects. First, it was impossible for fire to grow larger here than that found in a typical fireplace. Second, the light from any candle shone twice as bright as a normal candle would. Third, it was impossible to catch a disease when within the ward, (though catching a disease outside the ward and entering it meant that one would still suffer the effects of the illness.) Lastly, [[paper]] and [[parchment]] never aged when within Quill Ward, meaning that the pages books and documents felt always supple and new. Only the first effect was commonly known.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

==History==
It was a [[wizard]]ess from [[El Namor]] family who protected Quill Ward. [[Nureh el Namor|Nureh yr Catahra el Namor]], known as the Emerald Enchantress, created the powerful defensive magic in the {{YearlinkName|693}} as a way of protecting her own private library, the [[Emerald Archives]].<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

==Sabbans==
Quill Ward was divided into three ''[[sabban]]s'' with nine ''[[drudach]]''s.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

===Hapij Sabban===
Also known as "Scribe Sabban", this ''sabban'' filled the western third of the ward and had the greatest percentage of libraries, schools, and scribing services in Calimport. Like a library, the entire ''sabban'' was quietâ€”disturbingly so.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

Most of the buildings in this sector had no businesses on the ground floors, so nearly all entrances were over bridges from the ''sabban'' and ''drudach'' walls or up stairs to the second floors. Living quarters were typically found on the ground or upper floors.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 /> Access to the byways atop the walls was furthermore especially important in this ''sabban'', because at least some of the gateways into Hapij Sabban had been sealed to block entry from the ground.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 /><ref group="note">The source specifically mentions the gateway to [[Calimport/Khanduq Ward|Khanduq Ward]] as being sealed off, but this is impossible, as Khanduq Ward shares no borders with Hapij Sabban. It is possible that [[Calimport/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] is intended, as it only shares a small border with Hapij Sabban and would be a lower-caste sector. However, the gateways from Vahlen Sabban in [[Calimport/Grand Ward|Grand Ward]] are noted as being open, but Makista Sabban from Grand Ward is not mentioned, nor are any of the ''[[sabban]]s'' of [[Calimport/Wizard Ward|Wizard Ward]], even though these too share borders.

The mark for this ''sabban'' was a quill with a black drop of [[ink]] at the tip. It contained three ''drudachs'': Hikaya Drudach, Na'adil Drudach, and Fikra Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

; Notable Locations
; The Halruaan Scrivenora : This four-story building was a scribing business that had good prices. In the upper floors, seven retired sages still lived. Location: Hikaya Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; The Imperium Archives : This four-story private library contained documents about the [[Shoon Imperium]]. Location: Na'adil Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; The Graven Word : This four-story structure was the home of the Masterful Order of Clerks, Scribes, and Scriveners. Location: Na'adil Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; The [[Spell-Lord's House]] : This immense temple to [[Azuth]] had an enormous magical rose-colored window on its eastern face. It also housed one of the best libraries not owned by private families. Location: Fikra Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

; Notable Inhabitants
A former Grand Vizar of Calimport, one [[Ali el Samesaj]], once lived in this ''sabban''. Almost half the buildings in this ''sabban'' still showed signs of damage from magical duels between then-[[druzir]] el Samesaj and a group of would-be assassins of one of the sultans.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

===Nasim Sabban===
This ward occupied the northeastern third of the ''sabban''. It was a poorer neighborhood than the rest of the ward and acted as a sort of buffer between the more expensive and quieter areas and Hammer Ward.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

The northern borders of this ''sabban'' contained a barbed-wire spear fence to mark where the syl-pasha wished to construct a wall to separate the Outer Wards of Calimport from the Central Wards.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

The mark for this ''sabban'' was a flame surrounding three stacked coins. The mark had been used for this ''sabban'' since at least {{Yearlink|1220}}, but no one really knew what it meant.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

Nasim Sabban contained three ''drudachs'': Eggaeda Drudach, Nuvis Drudach, and Yaraf Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

; Notable Locations
; The Sultan's Library : This fancy, three-story building was the private library of the sultan. Location: Eggaeda Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; Home of the Healers : This simple, three-story hall was the base for the Circle of Physicians and Midwives. Location: Nuvis Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; Villa of Pasha Qoriha : Pasha Qoriha's estate had a mixture of three- and four-story buildings, all of them of superb construction. Location: Nuvis Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; The [[Bards' Wisdom]] : This private library collection included many works of interest to [[bard]]s. The two-story building was owned by Druzir [[Kamal el Kitaeb]]. Location: Yaraf Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; Villa of Pasha Khaetim : Owned by another [[pasha]] with a notable estate, this villa contained orante buildings of three and four stories. Location: Yaraf Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

===Jhaapir Sabban===
This ward was also known as "Arch Sabban" because of the unique architectural feel of the district. While most ''sabbans'' had countless bridges and ramps connecting the raised byways to the second-stories of buildings in the city, many of the bridges and ramps in Arch Sabban led to no-longer used minarets and had elaborate arch designs. The publicly open minarets were a common meeting site for lovers to gaze over the city. Even the mark for this ''sabban'' was a representation of two of its famous archways.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

Apart for its architectural significance, the Jhaapir Sabban marketed in supplies for scribing and bindingâ€”parchment, [[vellum]], and ink were all for sale here. Like most of the ward, this was a quiet and peaceful sector, occupying the southeastern third, where it bordered Wizard Ward and Maker Ward.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

Jhaapir Sabban also contained a good number of inns and the homes of lower-powered [[wizard]]s. It contained three ''drudachs'': Jemil Drudach, Jhalal Drudach, and Shuzah Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />

; Notable Locations
; The [[Gallery Majesta]] : This three-story temple was dedicated to [[Deneir]]. The first floor served a religious function, while the second story acted as a gallery for magical [[artifact]]s. Location: Jemil Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; [[Temple of Old Night]] : A small unimportant-looking shrine was located in this ''sabban'' that was one of five secret entrances to the great subterranean temple of [[Shar]] in the [[Muzad]]. Location: Jemil Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-p65>
; Eli yn Estaar's Inks : This was one of the many ink-sellers in the ''sabban''. [[Eli yn Estaar]] owned this two-story row-house establishment. Location: Jhalal Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; [[Memnon's Fingers]] : This four-story guildhall was the headquarters of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters. Pentagonal in shape, it had five minarets that were made to look like everburning candles. Location: Jhalal Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; Vimahlydah : This was the guildhall of the Choral Council. It was a well-built four-story structure. Location: Shuzah Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
; Summarl's Scrolls and Maps : This three-story business and row-home sold maps and scrolls. Location: Shuzah Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />
