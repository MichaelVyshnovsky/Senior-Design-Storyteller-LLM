        "Description": "The city was built as a single large castle. A wonder to the eye, the city seemed to be hewn from the top of its mountaintop resting place rather than being built there; the entire place was ornamented tastefully, and caught the eye in an especially fetching way at dawnbreak.",

One of them had a spiral staircase along its trunk.\n\nOrchtrien's personal palace was a hive-like structure with a great door, that had a smaller door on the right doorblade for human-sized guests. The southern towers had a surrounding garden, that smelled of [[brunfelsia]].{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|37-38}} Another tower, where he watched over things, was surrounded by greenery, which included [[pine]] trees, mutated by magical experiments so that their needles clinked with a metallic sound in the wind, and some of the flowers were pale, fleshy, with lidless eyes in their centers. The tower had illusory ceilings in the center of its one-room floors, to allow for a wyrm's ease of movement.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|40-42}}",
