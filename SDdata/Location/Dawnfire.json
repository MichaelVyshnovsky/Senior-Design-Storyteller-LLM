        "mainbody": "Dawnfire was the ancient capital of the kingdom ruled by the gold dragon King Orchtrien by the end of the Time of Dragons.\nThe city was built as a single large castle. A wonder to the eye, the city seemed to be hewn from the top of its mountaintop resting place rather than being built there the entire place was ornamented tastefully, and caught the eye in an especially fetching way at dawnbreak.\nThere was a single road from the base of the mountain all the way up to the castle. To the southeast were other lands that Orchtrien contested with other dragons.\nOrchtriens palace had at least one archway of precious metals, inlaid with gems, and marble stairs.\nThere was an Elf Quarter in Dawnfire, a grove of oak and shadowtop trees transplanted from old forests. One of them had a spiral staircase along its trunk.\nOrchtriens personal palace was a hive-like structure with a great door, that had a smaller door on the right doorblade for human-sized guests. The southern towers had a surrounding garden, that smelled of brunfelsia. Another tower, where he watched over things, was surrounded by greenery, which included pine trees, mutated by magical experiments so that their needles clinked with a metallic sound in the wind, and some of the flowers were pale, fleshy, with lidless eyes in their centers. The tower had illusory ceilings in the center of its one-room floors, to allow for a wyrms ease of movement.\nThere were a number of half-dragon soldiers in the city, comprising Orchtriens personal guard.\nKing Orchtrien had deputies, two of which were Maldur Breakstone and Rhespen Ash.\nIn , Orchtrien destroyed large portions of the city, including the royal keep and fortress, during the first Rage of Dragons.\n* Orchtrien\n* Bexendral\n* Maldur Breakstone\n* Rhespen Ash\n* Serdel\n* Winterflower Duskmere"
