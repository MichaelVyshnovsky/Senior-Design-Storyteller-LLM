'''Irondrake Rock''' was a valley with a rocky spire in the [[Stonelands]] until the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
Formerly, Irondrake Rock was a straight spire visible from afar in the Stonelands. Around it was a grassy meadow with rocky, sheer walls, forming a valley where the ground level rose closest to the spire, giving it a vaguely funnel-like shape. After 1357 DR, the eponymous rock had been reduced to a puddle of melted stone.

===Geographical Features===
There was a grotto at the base of the spire. At the top of the spire was a ''[[portal]]'' to a section south of [[Stone Stand]], within the [[High Forest]].

===Flora & Fauna===
Once, there were tall grass, weeds, and wild flowers in the meadow and birds nested Irondrake Rock. A [[dragon]] was said to have once made its lair here, after which the spire was named, according to Mirt.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, [[Shandril Shessair]]'s party, led by [[Mirt]], came to Irondrake Rock, where the moneylender sought the hidden ''portal''. While they camped, they were assaulted by the [[Zhentarim]] forces of [[Gathlarue]], including her two apprentices, [[Tespril]] and [[Mairara]]. The rock formation was destroyed during the fight. [[Delg Ironstar]] also perished in the valley. Since then, another name for the valley was Delg's Dell.
