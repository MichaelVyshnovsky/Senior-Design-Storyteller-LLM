Shaus was a Turmish city that once stood in the vicinity of the Orsraun Mountains in the Vilhon Reach.
The city of Shaus fell victim to the orcs of Candlekairn clan that amassed a horde and spilled from the Orsraun Mountains in Turmish. The conflict became known as the War of 512, in which the horde razed Shaus, Marikor, and Dauntshield. After the orcs were broken and repelled, only the village of Dauntshield was rebuilt.
