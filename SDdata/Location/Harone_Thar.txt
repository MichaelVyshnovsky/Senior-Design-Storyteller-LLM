'''Harone Thar''' was a [[dragonborn]] settlement in [[Relmaur]], [[Laerakond]].

==Background==
Harone Thar was one of the two "mobile" settlements the Relmorn dragonborn always maintained near the city of [[Rokthorl]]. Every time the location of Rokthorl changed, the dragonborn also moved Harone Thar to an eastern cavern near the capital's current location.
