'''Torglor''' was one of the eight subkingdoms of the [[dwarven]] realm of [[Shanatar]].

==Geography==
Torglor was located beneath the [[Snowflake Mountains]], which formed the border of the surface realms of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]]. It was the deepest of the eight kingdoms, being found in the [[Middledark]]. Only a handful of passages connected Torglor with the surface. 

==Inhabitants==
Formerly a kingdom of [[shield dwarves]], by the 1300s DR, the ruins of Torglor were used as an encampment, called [[Gatchorof]], of a large contingent of [[githyanki]] led by a powerful [[mage]] wielding a [[vorpal]] sword made from [[silver]]. These warriors from the [[Astral Plane]], and their allies, established extensive fortifications. From these fortified caverns, the githyanki waged war against the [[mind flayer]]s of [[Oryndoll]]. 

==History==
The dwarves who lived in Torglor had fought with the mind flayers of Oryndoll so extensively that they developed unique knowledge and equipment in battling the illithids. Much of the equipment was so well-made that they remained functional after centuries.

==Religion==
As worshipers of [[Diirinka]], the dwarves of Torglor were known for their inventions and their skill in rune magic.
