        "mainbody": "'''Guard''' was a village of [[centaur]]s located in the [[Barony of Bloodstone]] in [[Damara]].",
        "Description": "Guard sat in a great clearing approximately {{SI|375|feet|long=yes}} in diameter. Two massive plots for growing [[oat]]s, each {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} by {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}}, dominated the center of the clearing. These farms were encircled by the village's single path, which bisected the town and exited the clearing to the southwest and northeast. Buildings were spaced well apart throughout the clearing, with no streets to provide order to the village's planning.",
        "Geography": "The town lay within [[Bloodstone Pass]] about {{SI|10|miles|k|long=yes}} south of [[Bloodstone Village]] in a forest  which was part of the [[Warrenwood]].",
        "Government": "Guard was led by a Council of Elders. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this council was comprised of Chief [[Kiros]], War Chief [[Valon]], and Elder [[Shinar]].",
        "Trade": "The centaurs of Guard were largely isolated, and engaged in little to no trade, instead providing for themselves. They grew oats, foraged for [[berry|berries]], and hunted wild game.",
        "Defenses": "During the reign of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], the centaurs entered into a mutual defense agreement with the [[halfling]]s of [[Waukeshire]] and the displaced [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Clan Orothiar]] called the [[Alliance of Belt Watchers]]. As part of this, they contributed to and could make use of the defenses of the [[Warren]], an underground fortress in Bloodstone Pass. \n\nThe village boasted a small legion of 160 armed cavalry who were commanded in battle by [[Charvon]]. Defense of the town and the tactics of the defenders were the purview of War Chief Valon.",
        "History": "Despite having historically strained relationships with the [[humans]] of [[Bloodstone Village]], the centaurs of Guard had a cordial relationship with Baron [[Tranth]] during his rule in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR.\n\n[[Emelyn]] the Gray, a [[human]] [[wizard]], helped to found an academy for [[magic]] in or near the village prior to the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR As he got older, he eventually retired to his school to teach, but the school was destroyed during the [[Vaasan War]]. \n\nToward the end of the Vaasan War, with Bloodstone Pass becoming isolated by the forces of Zhengyi the Witch-King and resources becoming scarcer, Guard began to be terrorized by Zhengyi's bandit allies demanding tribute. Although they hated this arrangement, it was generally accepted that Zhengyi's allies were too strong to oppose. Instead, the centaurs joined the Alliance of Belt Watchers, a mutual defense arrangement with the local halflings and dwarves, to help protect themselves.\n\nFear changed to hope with the arrival of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his companions, including Emelyn the Gray, who soon rallied the various races of Bloodstone Pass to resist the Witch-King's allies. Many centaurs of Guard rode alongside Gareth's armies during his campaigns in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] to unite Damara and overthrow the Witch-King,",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "In the late 1350s DR, notable members of Guard included:\n* [[Kiros]], the Chief of the Council of Elders\n* [[Valon]], the War Chief and member of the Council of Elders\n* [[Shinar]], a [[priestess]] and member of the Council of Elders\n* [[Vikos]], a young but talented writer\n* [[Charvon]], the commander of the centaur cavalry legion"
