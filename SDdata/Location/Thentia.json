        "mainbody": "'''Thentia''' was a city located in the [[Moonsea North]] region of [[Faerûn]]. It was well known for its citizens' impassioned sense of self-determination, its reputation as the free and open of the cities around the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]], as well as its significant population of [[arcane spellcaster]]s.",
        "Description": {
            "Weather": "Unlike much of the Moonsea, particularly neighboring [[Melvaunt]], the weather in Thentia was most often rather pleasant, resembling a crisp Spring day."
        },
        "Geography": "The city was located at the mouth of the [[River Thent]], where it emptied into the Moonsea lake. The [[Sword Trail]] ran west from the city along the coast towards Melvaunt, and the [[Ruined Way]] went northeast towards [[Hulburg]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}",
        "Government": {
            "Law & Order": "Thievery was absolutely not tolerated in Thentia, and no thieving guilds were permitted to operate within its walls.\n\nSimilarly, anyone caught committing any sort of commercial malfeasance such as extortion, fraud or economic subversion were severe punishments. While the sentences were harsh, including fine, imprisonment, and even death; the greater penalty was the damage done to a person's commercial reputation."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Culture": "Thentia was a free-spirited place that welcomed those that did not fit in with Realms around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. A relaxed atmosphere filled the city's streets and it's citizens often had little cares beyond their own personal goals.",
            "Nobility": "Nobles in Thentia were granted the titles of \"Lord\" or \"Lady\" along with scarce few benefits. They were permitted to fly their own coat-of-arms and keep a private force of no more than 40 men in house livery."
        },
        "Economy": {
            "Trade": "Due to its focus on free enterprise, Thentia conducted more trade outside its borders than other, larger Moonsea cities."
        },
        "Defenses": "Thentia had one of the weakest militaries among the Moonsea powers. They were guarded by a cavalry of some sixty mounted soldiers known as the [[Riders of Thentia]].{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Everwinking Eye: Inside Thentia|7-8}}\n\nThe city watch known as the Warders served as Thentia's police force. 10 of whom were always stationed at the [[Watchlord's Tower]].\n\nWhile Thentia boasted no navy, their ships were protected by city's resident spellcasters. In truth, Thentia's [[archmage]]s were impressive enough in their own right to discourage open aggression taken towards the city or their sea trade.",
        "History": "The city was founded at the start of the 9{{th}} century [[DR]], in the {{YearlinkName|800}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1276}}, Thentia was among the settlements and city-states that lent their resources to the reconstruction of the ancient [[Citadel of the Raven]] in the northern slopes of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].\n\nDuring the early 14{{th}} century, ''circa'' the {{yearlinkName|1330}}, Thentia was captured and occupied by [[Maerhul]], one of the lords of [[Zhentil Keep]]. The city's residents left their home for nearby [[Hillsfar]] then slowly reintegrated themselves into its walls as merchants and traders. In short order they threw the [[Zhentarim]]'s economic hold over the city in disarray, and Thentia was freed from its control.\n\nLater on it was among the powers of the Moonsea that agreed to the treaty of unity put forth by the Coronal of [[Myth Drannor]] some time before the {{yearlinkName|1479}}. The cities and nations allied themselves to stand against the returned empire of [[Netheril]] and its campaign of conquest against the Realms of [[north Faerûn]]. After the conflict came to end and Netheril's plans were thwarted, Thentia and many of the Moonsea's smaller cities strove to form their own identity in the Realms, lest they come under the heel of another over-zealous power.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Local legend spoke of an intelligent blade known as the [[Beirmoura|Bright Sword]] that hovered throughout the city at times, cutting down members of the city's spellcasting community. It was said the sword craved the unique magical items that these individuals possessed.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Inns & Taverns": "*[[The Beacon]], a pleasant and lively inn that provided outside illumination via a globe that had been enchanted by ''[[continual light]]''.\n*[[The Bullroarer]], a boisterous and fun tavern.\n*[[The Inlet]], the tranquil establishment run by the knowledgeable and genteel [[minotaur]] named [[Thud]].",

        "Inhabitants": {
            "Organizations": "A minor cult formed in veneration of the enigmatic Bright Blade for some time, but dissolved over time.\n\nThe [[Knights of the North]] were known to have maintained a secret hideout in Thentia as of the early 1370s DR.",
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Beldergast]], a textile merchant that also served as a spy of the [[Zhentarim]].\n* [[Flammuldinath Thuldoum]],\n* [[Norrin]], a renowned [[blade (class)|blade]] and the leader of the [[Golden Gauntlets]].\n* [[Phourkyn One-Eye]], the [[sunwyrm]] that assumed the identity of a human man.\n* [[Rilitar Shadow-water]], a powerful [[moon elf]] wizard.\n* [[Scattercloak]], a mysterious mage.\n* [[Serise Hulmaster]], the mother of former [[Hulburg]]an regent, [[Geran Hulmaster]], active in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Yalaith Oruboryl]], the infamous \"Lady of the Parties\"."
