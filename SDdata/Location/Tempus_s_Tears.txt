Tempuss Tears was a village at the intersection of the Skuldask Road and Thundars Ride at the heart of the Fields of the Dead.
There was a large standing stone set up at the intersection with an inscription 
Tempuss Tears was among the gnome settlements linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists.
The dwarf and gnome villagers lived in burrow homes as the area of the village was covered in stone ruins.
The villagers said the stones were under the protection of Amaeraszantha, an amethyst dragon.
Located in the ruins was the Stone that Speaks. Scholars of Candlekeep had long sought that relic.
