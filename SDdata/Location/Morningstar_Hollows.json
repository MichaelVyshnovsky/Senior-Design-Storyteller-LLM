        "History": "The flooding of the Alaoreum River took several seasons. After inhabitants of Morningstar Hollows moved to nearby [[Velorn's Valor]], the abandoned village was taken over by bogs and swamps. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the village was believed to be inhabited by a three dozen lizardfolk.{{Cite web/More of the Vilhon Reach}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Morningstar Hollows were taken by the [[undead]] armies of [[mohrg]] [[Borran Klosk]] of Turmish. The undead warlord used his [[necromancy]] to fill his army with long dead folk, murdered by the [[Emerald Enclave]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the lizardfolk of Morningstar Hollows was gone, driven away by a slew of adventurers seaking fame and fortune. The lizardfolk moved on to the [[Wetwoods]] while a gang of bandits took over the village, ambushing scar pilgrims."
