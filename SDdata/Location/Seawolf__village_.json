        "Notable Inhabitants": "[[Branwen]], a priest of Tempus, left her native Seawolf at a young age due to the village's stance on female Tempuran priests. Despite being reviled by the populace, she held no resentment for her former home, seeing her treatment there as a challenge she had overcome."
