        "mainbody": "eawolf was a village on Giantspine, one of the islands that composed Norheim. By tradition, the local Tempuran clergy was entirely made up of men, and women were barred from becoming priests of the Lord of Battles.\nBranwen, a priest of Tempus, left her native Seawolf at a young age due to the villages stance on female Tempuran priests.
