The '''House of the Four Moons''' was a white-domed temple to [[Sel没ne]] in [[Veltalar|Velprintalar]] (now Old Velprintalar), [[Aglarond]]. In [[1368 DR]] it was led by High Priestess [[Dyltharra]] and served by six other priestesses, who kept contact between [[Alassra Silverhand|the Simbul]], the [[Royal Council of Aglarond]] and the [[Harpers]].
