'''Hollowbold''' was a ruined [[dwarven]] realm located under much of the [[dragon]] empire of [[Skelkor]].

==Background==
Hollowbold was composed of several underground dwarf settlements linked by a series of cave networks.

==History==
As of [[1479 DR]], Hollowbold had been abandoned for untold centuries. Not even dragons cared about this realm. The few who knew about it rumored about great treasures still unclaimed in the ruined dwarven holds.
