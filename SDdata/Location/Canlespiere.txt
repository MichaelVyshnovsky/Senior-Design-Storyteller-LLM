'''Canlespiere''' was a [[Netherese]] city near the [[Hidden Lake]] in the heart of [[Netheril]].

==Geography==
The city was built on the west bank of the [[Southfill River]], south of the Hidden Lake and [[Hidden Forest]].

==Trade==
The lands around Canlespiere were especially rich and fertile. Vast farmlands around the city provided the food that fed several [[enclave]]s.

==History==
Originally the [[ogre]] town of Chanth, Canlespiere came to be in {{YearlinkConvert|1004|NY}}. Seeking to claim the fertile farmlands in the region, the [[arcanist]] [[Miren]] demanded that the ogres depart with threats of force. When they refused, they were slaughtered or driven out, leading to the seven-year [[Ogres' Stand]] war as the ogres were slowly expulsed from the region. Over the following centuries, the Netherese slowly developed the region into an agricultural breadbasket.

Canlespiere's most famous inhabitant was the arcanist [[Noanar]], who settled there after wandering in from foreign lands. He practiced and perfected his fire-based spells while living in Canlespiere, and tested them on the local ogre population by joining teams of soldiers as they hunted ogres. This came to an end in {{YearlinkConvert|1559|NY}} when the ogres managed to kill him and drag his body away.

In {{YearlinkConvert|1804|NY}}, the ogres suddenly returned to the area, this time under the leadership of the [[ogre mage]] [[Storm (ogre mage)|Storm]]. Instead of directly attacking the city, Storm had his ogres raid the surrounding farmlands, which proved very effective. Netheril was forced to deploy huge numbers of soldiers to defend the region, but Storm's canny tactics and his magical powers were able to easily overcome them. Two years into his war, two survivors of a battle managed to report back with what they had seen, and the revelation of their magical foe caused arcanists to join the fight against him. This continued until {{YearlinkConvert|1810|NY}}, when Storm met the arcanists in a great magical battle on the north bank of the Southfill River. Though it was unclear whether Storm had been killed, his forces dispersed and the ogre mage himself never showed himself again.

With the ogres quelled, Canlespiere enjoyed a long period of prosperity and peace. Their farmlands were bountiful, horses were raised on the surrounding plains, and the Southfill River provided a good amount of catch. After {{YearlinkConvert|3200|NY}}, the [[phaerimm]]'s draining of the environment caused the gradual loss of the farmlands, and the population began declining. By the time of [[Karsus's Folly]] only a few hundred holdouts remained, and by {{YearlinkConvert|3600|NY}} the city was abandoned as the desert engulfed it.
