        "mainbody": "he Ash Ridge was a mountainous area of the Sword Mountains , along the Thunderhoof Pass.\nAsh Ridge stood to the northeast from Gnomengarde, long the mountain pass towards the Old Owl Well valley.\nBefore the 15 century DR, the Thunderhoof Pass was an important trade way that led to the Old Owl Well. Following the disastrous Spellplague that ravaged the face of Toril, the Thunderhoof Pass, the Ash Ridge, and the Old Owl Well were taken over by the orcs of the Many-Arrows Kingdom. Powers of the Lords Alliance showed little interest in the mountain pass as the trade withered away. Despite having little strategic value, Lord Neverember used adventurers to claim the Thunderhoof Pass for Neverwinter, with a promise of grand rewards."
