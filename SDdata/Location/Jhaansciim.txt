'''Jhaansciim''' was a small fishing village on the northern shores of the [[Firedrake Bay]], along the [[Firedrake Road]] that stretched along the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]].

==Description==
The fishing village stood on a minor dangerous trade route that brought merchants and travelers in on occasion. The place was known for its lone inn – [[The Wallside]], its unassuming-looking but delectable [[Nantennebra spicy fish stew|spicy fish stew]]s, and the local haunt – the so-called [[Crimson Tread]].

==Geography==
Jhaansciim stood on the southern edges of the [[Tethyr Peninsula]], about a mile southwest of [[Khalid's Wall]].

==Rumors & Legends==
*Crimson Tread was a supernatural occurrence that caused the locals and visitors to leave bloody footprints in the wake, which signaled ill luck and doom. Those who left bloody footprints were soon killed by an unknown ghostly presence within a [[tenday]]. Locals claimed that the Crimson Tread was a once-local boy known as [[Hathem Gedlaera]].

==Notable Locations==
*[[The Wallside]], Jhaansciim's only inn known for its quality food and gorgeous view of the Firedrake Bay.

==Notable Inhabitants==
*[[Hathem Gedlaera]], a young boy who was suffering from bullying and left Jhaansciim at some point before [[1370 DR]], consumed by anger, he joined the [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Amn]]. He was believed to be a failure of a thief, killed by some unknown party and thought to had become the dreaded Crimson Tread of Jhaansciim.
*[[Illuse Nantennebra]], the proprietress of The Wallside in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
