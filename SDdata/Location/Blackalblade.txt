'''Blackalblade''' was a small city and the capital of [[Ondeeme]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]].

==Geography==
The town was located on the border of Ondeeme and The Barony of [[Great Oak (kingdom)|Great Oak]] near the western edge of [[Qurth Forest]].

==Government==
The city was governed by a council of eight merchants, which would choose three of its members to head it. This council was influenced by a group of local [[wizard]]s called the [[Slee]].

==Trade==
Blackalblade was one of the weathiest cities in the Border Kingdoms and was famed for its [[gem]]-cutting and jewellery-making industry. Its location near the [[Raundawn Hill]] gave it access to a plentiful supply of raw gems. The council would hire famous gem-cutters from abroad to work their trade for the benefit of the city. The city was home to the [[Sparkling Hall]], the first human school of gem-cutting and jewellery-making. Gems and jewelry from Blackalblade were seen adorning many nobles across [[Faer√ªn]].

There were several inns located in the city. The most popular inns were [[Naraxalan's]] on Gardlaer Street, [[Orlisk's Orb]] on The Street of Stallions, and [[The Old Knight]] on Reldruth Street.

Blackalblade was home to a unique type of festhall called a [[drauda]]. They ranged from regular taverns with some gambling and gossip to dark, violent establishments filled with illicit business.
* [[Droum's Beard]] was located on Turnwall Lane, and was a large drauda with a whole central floor for dancing and other exhibits.
* [[Skaeling's Scorpion]] was located on Sarkskull Lane, and was a "dark" or "blood" drauda infamous for illicit activity.
* [[The Burning Mask]] was located on Dragonfang Street, and was a "dark" or "blood" drauda infamous for illicit activity.
* [[The Laughing Nazir]] was located on Glaudra Lane, and was known for gambling.
* [[The Sunset Cloak]] was located on Darcandle Street and was the most expensive drauda.

==Defenses==
Law and order were maintained by the [[Kauroanars]], a constabulary of roughly 70 men led by Lord Mace Heldraego Rauntlet. Their base of operations was [[Lawgauntlet Hall]] on Murloar Street, which also housed the Hall of Law and the constabulary armory and barracks.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Astlur Adaunt]], council member and master weaver originally from the [[Sword Coast North]].
* Lord Mace [[Heldraego Rauntlet]], originally from [[Calimshan]] and in charge of the Kauroanars.
* [[Ildyn Onsypir]], a gem-cutter from [[Athkatla]].
* [[Nardarra Leonpur]], council member and seller of scents and potions originally from [[Calimshan]].
* [[Urthe Crownshimmer]], a gem-cutter from [[Baldur's Gate]].
* [[Ylothin Tlarst]], council member and moneylender from [[Rashemen]].

==History==
The city was named after [[Kururn Blackalblade]], a famous pirate who built the first house in what would become the city.
