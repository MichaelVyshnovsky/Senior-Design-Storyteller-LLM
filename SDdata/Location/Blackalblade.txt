Blackalblade was a small city and the capital of Ondeeme in the Border Kingdoms.
The town was located on the border of Ondeeme and The Barony of Great Oak near the western edge of Qurth Forest.
The city was governed by a council of eight merchants, which would choose three of its members to head it. This council was influenced by a group of local wizards called the Slee.
Blackalblade was one of the weathiest cities in the Border Kingdoms and was famed for its gem-cutting and jewellery-making industry. Its location near the Raundawn Hill gave it access to a plentiful supply of raw gems. The council would hire famous gem-cutters from abroad to work their trade for the benefit of the city. The city was home to the Sparkling Hall, the first human school of gem-cutting and jewellery-making. Gems and jewelry from Blackalblade were seen adorning many nobles across Faerûn.
There were several inns located in the city. The most popular inns were Naraxalans on Gardlaer Street, Orlisks Orb on The Street of Stallions, and The Old Knight on Reldruth Street.
Blackalblade was home to a unique type of festhall called a drauda. They ranged from regular taverns with some gambling and gossip to dark, violent establishments filled with illicit business.
