        "mainbody": "'''Nightingale Court''' was a busy administrative and cultural part of [[Myth Drannor]] filled with majestic structures. The area was badly damaged and destroyed in the [[Weeping War]].",
        "Geography": "Once, this area was filled with beautiful architecture. After the Nightingale Court was hit hard during the Fall of Myth Drannor, erosion and vegetation have consumed the district.\n\nA magic statue stood at the center of the district called the ''[[Ear of Myth Drannor]]''. The monument's enchantment carried sounds and voices from across the city to the round plaza where it stood. The citizens and guests of Myth Drannor could ask the monument a question and have it carry a related sound in place of the answer later.\n\nOne of Myth Drannor's damaged ''Orrery'' spinning spires was located to the north-east. It was once used to efficiently magically transport objects around the city.\n\nA ruined temple of [[Mystra]] stood to the north of the ''Ear of Myth Drannor''. A patch of healing [[blueglow moss]] grew further west.\n[[File:Great stone head.jpg|thumb|''A strange magical monument, the Great Stone Head.'']]\nA strange shrine was located in the far west part of the court. ''The Great Stone Head'' statue requested a return of small statuette ''eidolons'' that represented many gods and demi-gods, in exchange rewarding the person returning it with a magically enchanted ring.\n\nAn entrance to a tomb that once served as a hidden stash for the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] was located up the stairway north of the stone head shrine.\n\nNightingale Court had an entrance to the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] via the underground passage that was taken over by [[lizardfolk]]. Another underground access in the court led to the [[Elven Catacombs]]' prison level. An elevated pathway to [[Speculum Grounds]] was located in the south-east of the district. A door to the [[Castle Cormanthor]] passage could be found at the center-north of the area.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the adventurers from [[Phlan]] helped to cleanse the ruined Temple of Mystra of [[dark naga]]s, removing one of the ''spawn pools'' of the ''[[pool of radiance]]''. That act restored [[Anorrweyn Evensong]]'s ghostly patronage of the area.",
        "Inhabitants": "In 1369 DR, Anorrweyn Evensong haunted the destroyed temple of Mystra she and her elven sect created.\n\n[[Malgi Hi]] and the lizardfolk tribe he led resided in the ruined district. They constantly feuded over territory with [[orc]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, and the [[Cult of the Dragon]].\n\nA pack of [[arraccat]]s lived in one of the destroyed structures in the area as well as a group of dark nagas led by [[Skerndli]] and [[Gorgat]] that occupied the temple of Mystra."
