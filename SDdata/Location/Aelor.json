        "Geography": "Aelor neighbored [[Daroush]], the location of the infamous [[gold]] mines. [[Amah]] was the closest city to Aelor, located to the south on the shores of the Vilhon Reach and the town of [[Xorhun]] to the north.",
        "History": "Aelor was settled in [[277 DR]], practically overnight, following a discovery of seemingly rich gold vein. However, this proved to be untrue and gold deposits were exhausted only five year later. By [[282 DR]], most industrious prospects of Aelor suffered financials losses and by [[284 DR]], Aelor became a ghost town of abandoned buildings. Most inhabitants of Aelor moved on to the city Amah.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], Amah returned to life as a small independent city-state. The neighboring [[Hlondeth]] had no interest in expansion and the takeover of Amah. [[Dediana Extaminos]], the [[yuan-ti]] ruler of Hlondeth, was focused on effective rulership of her domain, however if possibility to take over Amah or other neighboring city-states arose, she was willing to consider expansion."
