        "mainbody": "century DR.\nAelor was a shot-lived prospector settlement located within the Lilit Pass of the Vilhon Reach, later turned into a city-state.\nAelor neighbored Daroush, the location of the infamous gold mines. Amah was the closest city to Aelor, located to the south on the shores of the Vilhon Reach and the town of Xorhun to the north.\nAelor was settled in 277 DR, practically overnight, following a discovery of seemingly rich gold vein. However, this proved to be untrue and gold deposits were exhausted only five year later. By 282 DR, most industrious prospects of Aelor suffered financials losses and by 284 DR, Aelor became a ghost town of abandoned buildings. Most inhabitants of Aelor moved on to the city Amah.\nBy 1370 DR, Amah returned to life as a small independent city-state. The neighboring Hlondeth had no interest in expansion and the takeover of Amah. Dediana Extaminos, the yuan-ti ruler of Hlondeth, was focused on effective rulership of her domain, however if possibility to take over Amah or other neighboring city-states arose, she was willing to consider expansion."
