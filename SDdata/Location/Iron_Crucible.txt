The Iron Crucible was an elemental vortex connecting two elemental planes.
The Iron Crucible was a large fountain of liquid metal located near the Sevenfold Mazework. This fiery vein of ore connected the Elemental Plane of Earth to the lava tube located beneath the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
Travelers using the Iron Crucible were met by efreet ships floating on the lava that carried them to the City of Brass.
This elemental vortex allowed travel both ways, but efreet travelling to the Elemental Plane of Fire often ran into yakmen who attempted to collect ridiculous tolls before allowing their passage.
