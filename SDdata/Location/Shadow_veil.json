        "mainbody": "The '''Shadow Veil''' was a sizable and permanent [[planar]] rift in [[Thay]] that allowed for [[shadow crossing|crossing]] between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Shadowfell]].",
        "Description": "The Veil appeared as a tall, shifting curtain that looked like a combination of a shadow and a heat mirage. Anything seem through the Veil appeared dim, flickering, and almost unreal.\n\nThe presence of the Veil both empowered and interfered with ''[[portal]]s'' to and from the Shadowfell.",
        "Geography": "The Shadow Veil cut through the town of [[Veil (town)|Veil]]&mdash;where it provided access to and from the [[Shadowfell Road]]&mdash;and across the surrounding landscape. and the smoke of eruptions from the [[Thaymount]].",
        "History": "During the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Thayans led by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] made use of the Shadow Veil when mastering the Shadowfell Road in pursuit of their goals at the [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] near Neverwinter. Thayan guards and fortifications were placed on both sides of the Veil to defend access to the Road.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[Netherese enclave|flying city]] of [[Kolthunral]] arrived in the area to besiege [[Surcross]] and Veil and to deny the Thayans access to the Shadowfell Road. The city remained close to the Veil in order to ensure that its ''portals'' functioned correctly, however the fluctuating planar energies of the Veil also interferes with the city's mighty [[meteor tube]]s&mdash;which worked by hurtling projectiles in and out of the Shadowfell&mdash;by causing their missiles to miss their targets. Thus, the areas beneath the Veil were protected from the Netherese bombardment that decimated the nearby [[Charnel Fields]].\n\nBy that same time, a Thayan commander and [[Banite]] [[priest]] named [[Renault Abrecht]] believed that he had devised a means to collapse the Shadow Veil."
