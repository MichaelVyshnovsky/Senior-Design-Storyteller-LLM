'''Pellamcopse Woods''', also known simply as '''Pellamcopse''', was a forest located east-northeast of [[Waterdeep|Waterdeep's]] [[Northgate (Waterdeep)|Northgate]]. After the [[Spellplague]], the woods were nicknamed "Pellamcorpse" due to their sinister reputation.

==Description==
The forest contained a large number of [[briar]]s and was a favorite hunting ground of [[Tsarra Chaadren]].

==Inhabitants==
The forest was inhabited by [[peryton]]s and [[buarala]] (trees with tentacles and maws).

The most famous creature in the woods is the [[Nameless Haunt]], a fearsome cat-man created by the merging of the [[tressym]] [[Nameless (tressym)|Nameless]] (Tsarra's familiar) and the [[human]] [[Raegar Stoneblade]] (Tsarra's husband). The Nameless protected the Pellamcopse from magical intrusion and guarded ''[[Azuredge]]'' until it was retrieved by [[Meloon Wardragon]] in [[1479 DR]]
