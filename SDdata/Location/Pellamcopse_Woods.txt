Pellamcopse Woods, also known simply as Pellamcopse, was a forest located east-northeast of Waterdeeps Northgate. After the Spellplague, the woods were nicknamed "Pellamcorpse" due to their sinister reputation.
The forest contained a large number of briars and was a favorite hunting ground of Tsarra Chaadren.
The forest was inhabited by perytons and buarala (trees with tentacles and maws).
The most famous creature in the woods is the Nameless Haunt, a fearsome cat-man created by the merging of the tressym Nameless (Tsarras familiar) and the human Raegar Stoneblade (Tsarras husband). The Nameless protected the Pellamcopse from magical intrusion and guarded Azuredge until it was retrieved by Meloon Wardragon in 1479 DR
