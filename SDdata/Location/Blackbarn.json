        "mainbody": "'''Blackbarn''' was a small market town located at the intersection of the [[Long Trail]] and the [[Scelptar Road]] in the southern part of the [[Border Kingdoms]].",
        "Geography": "Blackbarn was located on the southern bank of the [[River Scelptar]], just north of [[The Land of Two Princes]]. The streets were paved with cobbles and most buildings were made of brown stone, with maroon-tiled roofs.\n\nDespite its name, there was no barn within the town. \"Wagonhouses\" were used instead to store produce for trade. These warehouses were designed so that a wagon could be filled via chutes located along the bottoms of the buildings.",
        "Government": "Blackbarn was governed by a council of local merchant lords called the Trantors. They elected a High Trantor from their numbers who acted as head of state.",
        "Trade": "Blackbarn was a prosperous town and was home to many merchants. These merchants would travel the [[Border Kingdoms]] in caravans or river barges towards ports along the [[Shining Sea]] for export to [[Calimshan]] and beyond.\n\nLocal inns included [[The Silent Knight]], [[The Black Boot (Blackbarn)|The Black Boot]], [[The Unsnug Snail]], [[The Laughing Cat]], [[The Minstrel's Folly]], [[Old Nag]] and [[Dance With The Knights]].",
        "Defenses": "The town was a peaceful and safe place to live thanks to the presence of the [[Ghost Lances]], also know as the \"Black Knights\". They were the ghosts of knights exiled from [[Tethyr]] centuries ago, who resided in a crypt under Blackbarn, cursed by a powerful [[wizard]] named [[Kulaskular]]. \n\nThe Lances hunted thieves and brigands, leaving the law-abiding locals in peace. They appeared in small groups whenever criminal action occurred in the town, from kicking a dog to murder, or when the town was under threat from outside forces. They usually appeared in groups of three to a dozen. The spectral knights never spoke but were elegant in their gestures and could write messages in many languages.",
        "History": "The town was founded when exiled female mercenaries of the [[Silent Knife]] from [[Calimshan]] settled the area. The town's name derived from one of the early large structures, a large black barn built with [[duskwood]].\n\nSome time in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the town became infested with [[gremlin]]s. They committed many acts of thievery and vandalization, persistently resisting the residents' efforts to exterminate them. Eventually residents started to refer to them as \"the Blackbarn Curse\" and bodies of those killed were strung up on posts. To circumvent the gremlins many things in the town began being made from stone or were locked away behind cupboards or with stout locks.{{Cite polyhedron/116/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms: Blackbarn and Bloutar|9}}",
        "Inhabitants": "* Althalas, a local sage who resides on Barwinter Street. Originally from [[Tethyr]]. \n* Thurbald, another loca sage who resides on Crowns Street. Originally from [[Calimshan]]."
