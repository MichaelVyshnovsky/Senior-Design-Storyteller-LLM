Suzails Promenade was a long, splendorous, semi-circular street that arched the Royal Court district. It was the most important street in the city, and one of the best shopping strolls on Toril. For a brief war-torn period of time in Cormyrs history, it was called The March.
The Promenade was a broad street, luring the city visitors with its beauty and architecture. The street linked the two main gates of Suzails 80-foot-high curtain walls, from Horngate to the west to Eastgate. The Promenade arched separating the Court precinct from the rest of Suzail.
Suzail is famous for its day-long fairs and festivals. The Festival of the Sword was one of the fairs unique to Suzail, was held at the Royal Court district, spilling onto the Promenade. The mounted parade showing off the citys best arms and armor took place there followed by the race to the gates in the ornate fence of the Royal Court where the participants were toasted with expensive wines, sherries, and other exotic alcohol.
The promenade was famous for the beautiful continual faerie fire that went up nightly lighting it with a soft amber glow. The arcane illumination provided the street with visibility during the night, and the regular Purple Dragon patrols kept it safe. An additional benefit of the faerie fire - it kept Suzail less smoky than most other large cities, keeping the number of torches and lamps lower.
Due to the Promenades location and size, the road was used by the citys garrison and defense forces. All citizens were retained to leave the Promenade immediately after a particular four-note horn call was blared. The city held drills about thrice a year to train the citizens in case of an attack.
*Suzails temples and shrines were located on the Promenade. Tymoras rich and beautiful temple, the Towers of Good Fortune, was located on the east side of the Promenade where it met the Royal Ride road. The Silent Room, Deneirs temple, was on the west side by the eastern end of the ornate fence that separated the luxury of Promenade from the cobbled plazas of the Royal Court building. Lesser shrines to Lliira, Tyr, Malar, Milil, and Oghma were spread between the Silent Room and the Towers of Good Fortune. Lliiras was on the north side of Stonebow Street, between Torch Street to the west and Blade Lane on the east. Oghmas was located on the west side inside Eastgate. Malars shrine - on the north of the Royal Ride road just a few buildings west of the shrine of Tyr. Milils shine was on the west side of Coachwheels, north to Blade Lane.
* Memories of Queen Fee was an expensive and fashionable club overlooking the Promenade. It was often frequented by nobles looking for company and gossip.
*The Six Candles, lovingly called Sixer by the locals, was a tavern serving good food, frequented by tourists, and local older men playing games at the back of the dining room. Rumors had it that they were entangled with an infamous smuggler Saszesk.
*The Wailing Wheel was facing the Horngate. Owned by merchant Thentias, it was the quietest and least popular of Suzails inns. It was always cold, dirty, subpar food, with almost no service.
*The Dragons Jaws was the infamous inn owned by Gnorm facing the Promenade. Its taproom was the place of many dramatic events over the years, including the death of a mind flayer and the revelation of a gold dragon.
Almost all the oldest and richest noble families of Suzail resided to the north of the Promenade.
