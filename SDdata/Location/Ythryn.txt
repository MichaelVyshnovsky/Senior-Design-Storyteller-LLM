'''Ythryn''' ({{Pronounce|EETH|rin|refs=}}), later known as the '''Necropolis''', was one of the spectacular [[Netherese enclave|enclaves]] of [[Netheril]] that soared across the skies over a millennium before the [[Era of Upheaval]]. Like nearly all of the ancient empire's flying cities, Ythryn came crashing down to [[Toril]], remaining largely intact as a necropolis embedded deep within the heart of the [[Reghed Glacier]] in the [[far North]] of [[Faer√ªn]].

The submerged ruins were regarded as little more than a tomb for the ancient [[Netherese]], full of deadly magic awaiting anyone who sought its arcane secrets.

{{Quote|The ''[[Codicil of White]]'' is rumored to contain a spell or ritual that can carve a passage through the [[Reghed Glacier]], under which the lost city Ythryn is buried.|[[Vellynne Harpell]], ''circa'' [[1489 DR]].}}

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
The enclave was formed upon a large disc, atop which sat its many odd-shaped towers and turrets, along with several shorter, domed structures. The outer rim of the disk was dotted with fourteen wizard's spires, each of which resembled a single claw reaching over the city's edge.

As with other of Netheril's enclaves, Ythryn was powered by a single ''[[mythallar]]'' Its magic was the source of the city's flight capabilities, and could also recharge expended magic items.

[[File:YthrynMythallar.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A [[tomb tapper]] protecting the city's ''[[mythallar]]'' from intruders.]]
The necropolis of Ythryn was the carrier for a form of magical disease known as the ''[[arcane blight]]'', which slowly transformed living [[humanoid]]s into [[nothic]]s.

===Culture===
The residents of Ythryn spent much of their time either studying the arcane arts or reveling in a life of luxury and joy, without much want or need. They focused their academic work on the acquisition of information regarding the lost giant realm of [[Ostoria]].

During its glory days, the city boasted an orchestra that was famous across all the lands of [[Toril]]. It also had a stadium that hosted matches of the popular sport known as ''[[Chain Lightning (sport)|Chain Lightning]]''. Chimeric pets were quite popular among the citizens of Ythryn, particularly [[hare]]s that were given wings.

==Geography==
The final resting place of Ythryn was about a {{SI|1|mi|k}} southeast of the deepest reaches of subterranean [[Caves of Hunger]].

==Government==
During its glory days, Ythryn was ruled by the Netherese [[arcanist]] [[Iriolarthas]], who actually underwent the process of [[lichdom]] long before the city came crashing down to Toril.

The governance of the enclave was carried out by a cabal of eight arcanists referred to as the [[Wizards of the Ebon Star]].

==History==
When Iriolarthas and his apprentices first activated the city's ''mythallar'' and elevated the city into the skies, they traveled to the region of the continent that would later be referred to as [[the North]]. They searched for long-lost magics, that dated to the ancient [[giant]] realm of [[Ostoria]].

Finally, in the autumn of the {{YearlinkName|-343}}, the arcanists of Ythryn recovered a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils<ref>[[Christopher Perkins]] (September 2020). ''[[Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden]]''. Edited by [[Kim Mohan]]. ([[Wizards of the Coast]]), p. 231. ISBN [[Special:BookSources/978-0786966981|978-0786966981]]. at the floor of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. They began experimenting upon the recovered artifact, inadvertently causing an eruption of power that disabled the enclave's ''mythallar'', and sending the flying city plummeting into the ground.

As the city crashed into the Reghed Glacier, the heat of the impact caused it to fall deeper beneath the icy surface. Once its descent was over, the Frostmaiden [[Auril]] covered the ruins in ice as a means to lay claim to the new prize.

[[File:Ythryn.jpg|thumb|center|600px|The necropolis of Ythryn, beneath the [[Reghed Glacier]] where it remained for centuries.]]

Around the {{yearlinkName|1489}}, four [[wizard]]s of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], [[Avarice]], [[Dzaan]], [[Nass Lantomir]], and [[Vellynne Harpell]], undertook an expedition to uncover the secrets of the frozen enclave. The scholars sought a means to end the ''[[Everlasting Rime]]'' that plunged Icewind Dale into eternal winter.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that the portion of glacier above the necropolis could be parted by an inscription included within the ''[[Codicil of White]]'', a holy book of the [[Auril]]ian faith.

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Ythryn observatory.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The observatory's Arch-Astronomer, however, was one of the more hopeful of Ythryn's residents.]]
In the time of ancient Netheril, the enclave of Ythryn housed the lich-arcanist Iriolarthas, his apprentices and other Netherese elites. During this time, [[iron golem]]s were also often used as guardians and sentries.

Some of the poor wretched souls who survived the crash eventually succumbed to death by starvation, and transformed into [[shadow]]s after their death. One such survivor [[Drakareth]], managed to survive a bit longer by killing some of the other surviving Netherese, before becoming a [[wraith]] himself.

In the centuries after its collapse, frozen necropolis became overrun by [[nothic]]s,
