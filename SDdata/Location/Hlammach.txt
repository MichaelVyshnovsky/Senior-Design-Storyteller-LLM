'''Hlammach''' was a bustling port city in [[Impiltur]] located on the [[Easting Coast|northern coast]] of [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] leading into the [[Easting Reach]]. Along with [[Lyrabar]] further south, Hlammach was home to much of the realm's great wealthy and old guard of noble families.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

Like many of Impiltur's grand cities, Hlammach was free from slums and poverty for a great many years,

==Description==
Hlammach was a compact, walled-city that had a grand port that was nearly always full of ships. As the last stop before the eastward [[Royal Road]], Hlammach was always a hive of activity. Goods that arrived from across the Inner Sea left the city via the Royal and [[Herald's Road]]s before dispersing east.

The royal mint of Impiltur was located in Hlammach. The city received many of its [[gold]] and [[silver]] shipments from the mines of the [[Earthfast Mountains]], which were brought south through [[Amgoth]] county via its [[Amgoth Road|namesake road]].{{Cite dungeon/137/Man Forever}} The mint was often the target of aspiring [[thief|thieves]], who could not resist the magnificent trove of [[currency|coins]] and [[trade bar]]s, but was well-protected by Hlammach's city watch.

==History==
Hlammach rivaled [[Lyrabar]] in importance during the days before the unification of Impiltur. Its location gave it natural control of the entire northeastern region of the sea. Hlammach also had a cold relationship with [[Sarshel]] even after Impiltur's founding. Many believed this was the main reason that refugees from Sarshel chose to settle in [[Dilpur]] over the larger and more prominent Hlammach.
