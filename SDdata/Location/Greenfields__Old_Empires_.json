Typical herd animals usually found in the Greenfields included cattle, [[donkey]]s, [[goat]]s, [[ox]]en and [[sheep]]."

        "History": "Before the foundation of Unther, the Greenfields were inhabited by [[Turami]] tribes that farmed the land for centuries until the arrival of the [[Mulan]]. Historically, it was the breadbasket of the nation since almost 70% of the country's food came from this region and it had many productive farms.\n\nIn the 14th century [[DR]], the Greenfields was a land troubled not only with monsters problems but with bandit problems. The authorities of Unther had posted a militia of almost 1000 soldiers to take care of the situation, as well as offered rewards to [[adventurer]]s to deal with the [[sphinx]]es and the bandits, to no avail. The mysterious [[Enclave]] also built their headquarters on this region. To boot, Untheran farmers had overused the land, and the crops were less productive than in past centuries.\n\nDuring the [[Mulhorand]]i [[invasion of Unther]], in the late years of the 14th century, the Mulhorandi army took control of the Greenfields, exporting its food to their country.\n\nDuring the Spellplague, the Greenfields were hit hard by the violent exchange of lands between the worlds of Abeir and [[Toril]]. As a consequence of this cataclysm, the [[Ash Lake|Ash]] and [[Lance Lake]]s were created. After the foundation of [[Tymanther]], the region became part of the [[dragonborn]] nation and it filled role of being the nation's breadbasket, much as it had been for Unther in the past.",
