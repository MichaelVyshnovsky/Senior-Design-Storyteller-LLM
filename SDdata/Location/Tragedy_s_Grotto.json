        "mainbody": "Tragedys Grotto was a small hollow and shrine to Ilmater, the Crying God, and St. Ulrach found in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale.\nThe grotto was tucked away between some villas and merchant compounds, in a spot easily overlooked and easily avoidedâ€”just as the wealthy citizens of this neighborhood preferred.\nOnly  at its widest, it was a narrow grotto between three tree-covered knolls atop which the rear walls of the villas and compounds stood. A fast-flowing stream ran down the middle and was fed by two tributaries. At the heart of the grotto, the stream widened into a small pool,  wide. At the center of this pool stood a statue of St. Ulrach, which served as the shrine to Ilmater. Although unkempt and grim, it was nevertheless a very picturesque place.\nThis place had a long and storied history as a place of sadness, suffering, and misfortune, in happenings small and great and with more than its fair share. In particular, it was the scene of no small number of suicides. Thus, it came to be called Tragedys Grotto by the folk of Loudwater. Because of this reputation, the site was considered sacred to the Crying God.\nThe last elf to rule Loudwater took her own life here in the late 10 century DR. Her reasons were lost with her.\nAccording to local stories, heroes of Loudwater of the time first sighted the approaching Rensha forces from here\nThe monks of the Monastery of St. Ulrach came regularly but not frequently to tend to Tragedys Grotto in the late 14 century DR.\nIt was commonly believed to be haunted by the spirits of the unquiet dead. In particular, there was a story of a ghost that wandered Tragedys Grotto after each Shieldmeet. Those who followed it were said to find great treasure, or else sorrow and doom."
