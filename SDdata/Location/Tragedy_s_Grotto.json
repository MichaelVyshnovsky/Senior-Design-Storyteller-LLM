        "mainbody": "'''Tragedy's Grotto''' was a small hollow and shrine to [[Ilmater]], the Crying God, and [[St. Ulrach]] found in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].",
        "Location": "The grotto was tucked away between some villas and merchant compounds, in a spot easily overlooked and easily avoidedâ€”just as the wealthy citizens of this neighborhood preferred.",
        "Description": "Only {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} at its widest, it was a narrow grotto between three tree-covered knolls atop which the rear walls of the villas and compounds stood. A fast-flowing stream ran down the middle and was fed by two tributaries. At the heart of the grotto, the stream widened into a small pool, {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} wide. At the center of this pool stood a statue of St. Ulrach, which served as the shrine to Ilmater. Although unkempt and grim, it was nevertheless a very picturesque place.",
        "History": "This place had a long and storied history as a place of sadness, suffering, and misfortune, in happenings small and great and with more than its fair share. In particular, it was the scene of no small number of suicides. Thus, it came to be called Tragedy's Grotto by the folk of Loudwater. Because of this reputation, the site was considered sacred to the Crying God.\n\nThe last [[elf]] to rule [[Loudwater]] took her own life here in the late 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. Her reasons were lost with her.\n\nAccording to local stories, heroes of Loudwater of the time first sighted the approaching [[Rensha]] forces from here{{cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}",
        "Activities": "The monks of the [[Monastery of St. Ulrach]] came regularly but not frequently to tend to Tragedy's Grotto in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was commonly believed to be haunted by the spirits of the unquiet dead. In particular, there was a story of [[Brother Sheer|a ghost]] that wandered Tragedy's Grotto after each [[Shieldmeet]]. Those who followed it were said to find great treasure, or else sorrow and doom."
