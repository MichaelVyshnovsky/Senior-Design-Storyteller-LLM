The Warehouse District of Port Nyanzaru was a section of the citys Harbor Ward where goods being shipped into or out of the city were stored.
The district was characterized by its canals that separated the rows of warehouses. Full-size merchant ships could be towed through these canals by dinosaurs, allowing for the vessels to be brought straight to the sites where their cargo was to be loaded or unloaded. Because traffic jams were a notable concern with this arrangement, organizing this towing operation was one of the key responsibilities of Port Nyzanzarus harbormaster.
The Warehouse District was located in central Port Nyanzaru, east of the drydocks and west of the public docks.
In the late 15 century DR, the harbormaster in charge of traffic management in the Warehouse District was Zindar.
