The '''Great Vale''', also known as '''Asanibis''' in the [[Mulhorandi language]], was considered the breadbasket of the nation of [[Mulhorand]]. It included the lands that lie between the [[Dragonsword Mountains]] and the [[Menesankh]].


==Geography==
The area that made up the Great Vale accounted for the majority of Mulhorand's farmland. The region was heavily irrigated, and the annual flooding of the [[River of Spears]] provided the soil with an infusion of sediment on a regular basis.

==History==
Attacks by monsters in this region increased over the course of [[1358 DR]], leading citizenry to demand that the land be cleared of such dangers.

==Inhabitants==
The population of the Great Vale was composed primarily of [[humans]]. The majority of these individuals made their homes in the towns of [[Surbroar]], [[Klondor]], [[Ulzel]], and [[Mishtan]], though a fair number resided at the farms of the region. Rumors also indicated that intelligent storms known as [[Skriaxit]] may have once been found in the area around Klondor.

==Places of Interest==
