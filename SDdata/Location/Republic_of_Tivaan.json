        "mainbody": "The Republic of Tivaan was a merfolk republic on the Hmur Plateau, beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars, that formed out of rebellion against the oppressive king of Thalorlyn.\nIn , in the midst of the Third Serôs War, a group of spies discovered that Coronal Essyl Merynth of the Aryselmalyr Empire and King Kyron of Thalorlyn were secretly allied with a trio of fiendish krakens for further power. This revelation led to the formation of the Republic of Tivaan. Despite the power of their kraken allies and the artifact known as the Emerald Eye, the rebels managed to depose Kyron and his loyalists a year later. They were all banished from the Hmur Plateau, disestablishing Thalorlyn and having the Republic of Tivaan take its place.\nHaving lost his puppet state, the focus of the Third Serôs War shifted as Coronal Essyl began sending his forces against the upstart republic. In , the republic would forge an alliance against Aryselmalyr with the Arcana of Humbar, a usually isolationist nation of morkoths.\nDeposed from the Thalorlyn throne, but still an ally to the Coronal, the exiled King Kyron sought to create a new center of power for himself. He and his loyalists constructed the temple of Vynagyr along the slopes of the Nalaan Plateau, finishing it in , and dedicated it to Those Who Sleep Below. From his new base of power Kyron worked together with Essyl to forge alliances with various evil creatures of the Inner Sea, including morkoths and scrags, hoping the addition of such forces could help them to quell the rebellions against Aryselmalyr.In the original text the temple is referred to as being dedicated to \"long forgotten evil powers\". With Dagon retconned in Grand History of the Realms as a member of Those Who Sleep Below and as the reason behind Kyrons madness, it retroactively suggests that the temple is dedicated to them.\nIn , the first Passing of the shalarin occurred, as the Wildtide Portal and shalarin flooded into the Inner Sea from the Sea of Corynactis. The newcomers were quickly attacked by the forces of Essyl and Kyron, with the added aid of their Emerald Eye. The Republic of Tivaan, the Dukars of Myth Nantar, and the Arcana of Humbar would quickly rush to the aid of the shalarins and summarily forge an alliance with them against Aryselmalyr.\nIn , the Dukars would finally slay the mad exiled king and take his Emerald Eye into custody. His loyalists then divided, with some joining the Republic of Tivaan and others maintaining their allegiance to Coronal Essyl. The Third Serôs War would eventually come to an end in . From then on the Republic maintained peaceful relations with the other nations of Serôs.\nYears later in , the Fourth Serôs War began as a massive horde of merrows and koalinths invaded the Hmur Plateau. Their numbers too great to overcome, they overran the Plateau and brought about the fall of the Republic of Tivaan. Feeling desperation, a mermaid stole the Emerald Eye from one of the towers of the Dukars, believing the powerful artifact could drive away the invaders. However, she became corrupted by the Emerald Eye, taken over by \nWith her mind corrupted by the Emerald Eye, the mermaid imposed herself upon the invaders, declaring them to be the Second Kingdom of Kyron and becoming their leader in a continued conquest of the Hmur Plateau. The war would eventually come to an end in , with the possessed mermaid killed and the Emerald Eye taken back into the custody of the Dukars. The mermaids body would be buried in the Plains of Duna, subsequently renamed the Haunted Plains, and the Kingdom of Thalvan would be founded as the successor to the Republic of Tivaan by King Darmox.It is never stated within either of the primary sources, Sea of Fallen Stars and Grand History of the Realms, what the \"Second Kingdom of Kyron\" was. In its summary of the Serôs Wars on page 153, Sea of Fallen Stars states that the Fourth Serôs Wars belligerents were the \"Second Kingdom of Kyron vs. koalinth and merrow hordes.\" This would seem to imply that the Republic of Tivaan was this \"Second Kingdom of Kyron\", however, it seems unlikely that the republic who rebelled against Kyrons rule would take such a name for themselves and is contradicted by the text on the two cited pages stating that the destruction of the Second Kingdom of Kyron adversely affected the Serôsian population of koalinths &mdash if koalinths were in opposition to this Second Kingdom, then its destruction would logically be advantageous to them. This leaves the conclusion that the \"Second Kingdom of Kyron\" must refer to the collective forces under the mermaid corrupted by the Emerald Eye and the spirit of King Kyron within it."
