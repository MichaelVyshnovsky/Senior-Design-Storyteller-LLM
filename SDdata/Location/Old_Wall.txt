"The '''Old Wall'''" was a term used to refer to those structures and streets occupying the area where the original walls of [[Silverymoon]] once were.

==Location==
The Old Wall began at the Docks west of the [[Moonbridge]] and went northwest to [[Dancer's Mask Lane]], which it followed as it ran north. Then it bent sharply to the east until it reached [[the Market]]. The Old Wall served as much of the Market's western border until ending at the Docks east of the Moonbridge.

==History==
Construction of the original wall of Silverymoon was begun in [[637 DR]] and completed by [[Uktar]] of that same year, when Silverymoon officially became a city. By [[734 DR]], the growing city was suffering from problems of overcrowding; new walls were built that nearly doubled Silverymoon's size. Sections of the Old Wall and its foundations were intentionally left standing to be used as supports for new buildings.

==Notable Locations==
[[Helmer's Wall]], which used to be a gatehouse to the city within the Old Wall, was a popular tavern among students at the many colleges.
