The '''Mucklestones''' were a ring of standing stones on the northeastern tip of the [[Forest of Lethyr]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|34|3}}

==Description==
The Mucklestones were a ring of standing stones that bordered a cleared out, circular bowl on the land. The stones were about six feet tall, two feet deep, four feet wide, and etched with nature runes.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|78-79|9}} While in [[Gameliel]]'s holding, the branches atop the bowl were bare and dead, with the stones themselves were covered in slime and fungi.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|89|10}}

In {{yearlink|1372}}, the Mucklestones formed an elaborate arrangement that occassionally shifted about; elder druids had tracked it, claiming that sometimes the entire clearing moved, taking the stones along with it, though never very far.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|135}}

==History==
the Mucklestones were in the keeping of the druid [[Briartan]] since at least {{yearlink|1372}}{{cite book/Lady of Poison|73|8}} The blightlord used the Mucklestones as a staging area for his [[blightspawned]] [[volodni]] and their raids.

After the blightlord's demise, his power over the stones receded on its own.

==Powers==
The Mucklestones served as magical portals, allowing access to places throughout Faer√ªn.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|53-54|6}} At least one of those portals led into [[Sunglade deep]] in the [[Yuirwood]]; each portal had druidic script pointing where they lead, though it was nigh-undecipherable to outsiders.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|202}}
Using the ''[[keystone]]'', [[Ususi Manaallin]] opened a portal into the [[Celestial Nadir]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|94-95|11}}

By {{yearlink|1497}}, many of the portals accessible through the Mucklestones had broken down or been rerouted because of the [[Spellplague]].{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|135}}
