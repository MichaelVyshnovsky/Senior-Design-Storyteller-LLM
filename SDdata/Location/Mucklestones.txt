The Mucklestones were a ring of standing stones on the northeastern tip of the Forest of Lethyr.
The Mucklestones were a ring of standing stones that bordered a cleared out, circular bowl on the land. The stones were about six feet tall, two feet deep, four feet wide, and etched with nature runes. While in Gameliels holding, the branches atop the bowl were bare and dead, with the stones themselves were covered in slime and fungi.
In , the Mucklestones formed an elaborate arrangement that occassionally shifted about elder druids had tracked it, claiming that sometimes the entire clearing moved, taking the stones along with it, though never very far.
the Mucklestones were in the keeping of the druid Briartan since at least  The blightlord used the Mucklestones as a staging area for his blightspawned volodni and their raids.
After the blightlords demise, his power over the stones receded on its own.
The Mucklestones served as magical portals, allowing access to places throughout Faer√ªn. At least one of those portals led into Sunglade deep in the Yuirwood each portal had druidic script pointing where they lead, though it was nigh-undecipherable to outsiders.
Using the keystone, Ususi Manaallin opened a portal into the Celestial Nadir.
By , many of the portals accessible through the Mucklestones had broken down or been rerouted because of the Spellplague.
