        "Geography": "The ruins were part of the broader [[Ruins of the Serpent Kings]] found near the village of [[Buldamar]] along the eastern shore of [[Azulduth]], the Lake of Salt, in [[southeast Faer√ªn]].",
        "History": "The ruins were first discovered during the early days of the empires of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]] and promptly plundered for the treasure they contained. These [[magic]]al discoveries were used to bolster the magical might of the two empires.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a fair number of eager [[adventurer]]s explored the ruins with hopes of find treasure missed by countless others. This trend continued through the late 15{{th}} century DR, largely driven by tales told by businesses in Buldamar eager to bring in scavengers and explorers as customers."
