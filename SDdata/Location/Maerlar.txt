'''Maerlar''' was a city located in the country of [[Mulhorand]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|B1dlc}} 

==Geography==
Maerlar sat at the crossroads of the [[Great South Road]], [[Great East Road]], and the [[Road to the Dawn]] in north Mulhorand.

==Government==
The precept of Maerlar's main duty was to maintain guards at the crossroads and protect incoming trade. Vizier [[Rezim]] typically sent his underlings here to serve as precept after they had disappointed him in some way. The city lacked a precept in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, but someone was expected to be appointed relatively soon, in the next half-year or so, though Rezim might well wait until he had a suitable candidate to rid himself of.

==Trade==
Maerlar's location meant that most trade going overland to the capital city [[Skuld]] passed through its gates.

==Notable Locations==
* A [[temple of Mielikki (Maerlar)|temple of Mielikki]]
