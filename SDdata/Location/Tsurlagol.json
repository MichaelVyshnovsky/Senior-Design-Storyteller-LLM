To merchants, it was '''\"The Gateway to the Unapproachable East\"'''; to pirates it was '''\"Pirate's Haven\"'''. It had the unenviable record of being raided, destroyed, and rebuilt more often than any other city in the surrounding lands, such that to the local [[dwarves]], \"Tsurlagol\" was a byword for \"job available\".",
        "Etymology & Language": "When founded, the city was known as \"Chessagol\", but this later evolved into its modern name, \"Tsurlagol\". The name \"Tsurlagol\" was pronounced as ''Tsss-SIR-lah-gol'' or ''TSIR-lah-gol'', and its people were called \"Tsurlagoli\". Its people spoke the [[Easting language]],{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} which was related to the [[Damaran language]].{{cite book/Player's Guide to Faerûn|15}}",
        "History": {
            "Early history": "Tsurlagol was almost as old as its sister-city [[Procampur]], and shared a common origin, having also been founded by [[human]] settlers from fallen [[Jhaamdath]] (what is now [[Chondath]]). They settled on the southern coast of the Vast and, in the [[-72 DR|Year of Enchanted Hearts, −72 DR]], founded the city of Chessagol, as it was then known.\n\nAccording to local legend, the first Tsurlagol was destroyed by uncontrollable powerful [[magic]]. This was the first of many times that the city would be destroyed.\n\nFrom then on, over the course of Tsurlagol's long history, the city was raided, sacked, burned, and destroyed numerous times, by pirates, conquerors, [[orc]]ish and other hordes, [[magic]], and various other forces. No conquerors held it for long. But each time and each generation, the people salvaged whatever survived and rebuilt the city. They relied on their trade to fund their reconstruction, and local [[dwarf|dwarves]] received a steady income rebuilding Tsurlagol each time. In this way, the city was rebuilt at least twenty times.\n\nIn the early 5th century [[DR]], King [[Meldath I]] of [[Impiltur]] led a conquest of the Vast and other nearby lands, turning Chessagol and Proeskampalar (Procampur) into vassal city-states. He took the royal regalia of both cities.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|63}}<ref group=\"note\">[[Dragon magazine 346|\"Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom\"]] names this warrior king \"Meldath the Magnificent\". However, ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' lists only [[Meldath I]] \"the Mighty\" ([[441 DR]]–[[445 DR]]) and [[Meldath II]] ([[445 DR]]–[[448 DR]]). The name and details would suggest that this is in fact Meldath I. Both Proeskampalar/Procampur and Chessagol/Tsurlagol later became independent, but this event has not been detailed.\n\nOnce, early in Tsurlagol's history, an unknown warrior rode before the walls, waving his banner and boasting. The city's defenders met the challenge and attacked; four of them brought down the nameless warrior and slew him. His treasure was discovered, and the city's acquisitive [[wizard]]s took one particular gem, the [[Moaning Diamond]] [[artifact]]. The nameless warrior was cremated and his bones stored in one of Tsurlagol's ossuaries.\n\nAccording to mosaics found in the subterranean ruins of Tsurlagol, wizards once using [[fire magic]] started a blaze that got out of control and burned down the city again. So fierce was the inferno that a wizard in an azure cloak was forced to use the Moaning Diamond to cause a great earthquake to topple the walls and towers of Tsurlagol, burying the city itself beneath the earth to put the fire out. The wizard died in the earthquake and was treated with honors. Later tales in the Vast claimed that it was the [[god]]s who sent the earthquake in response to people's pleas.This event is difficult to date, being described by [[Mumchance]], a 330-year-old [[dwarf]] in 1246 DR, as occurring shortly before his great grandfather's time. Assuming ~75 years for a dwarven generation, this may have occurred some time in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn the 7th century [[DR]], Chessagol came under the rule of King [[Lamoth]] and his newly royal family, though they were not considered legitimate. Lamoth sought to bolster his line by marrying his children to the royal families of [[Cormyr]], [[Milvarn]], [[Westgate]], and others around the Inner Sea. Finally, he successfully arranged a marriage between his daughter [[Elthia]] and Prince [[Bellodar III]] of Impiltur. Bellodar became king of Impiltur, and Elthia queen, in the [[642 DR|Year of Sifting Sands, 642 DR]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|88–89}}\n\nIn the mid–13th century [[DR]], the Vast suffered rampaging hordes of [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[bugbear]]s, supplemented by some human brigands and half-breed rogues. In the summer of the [[1246 DR|Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR]], the orc warlord [[Fottergrim]] and the [[magelord]] [[Archlis]] led a mixed horde of them against Tsurlagol. It was thought that they bribed the gate guards to allow them access. The horde invaded the city and took over, while numerous local [[humanoid]]s of their kinds flocked to join the city.{{CotMD-time}}\n\nFortunately, the [[Thultyrl]] of [[Procampur]] chose to honor his city's treaty with Tsurlagol and led an army to besiege and free the city, with the aid of the [[Siegebreaker]]s, an adventuring band of sappers. In their expedition, the Siegebreakers discovered the Moaning Diamond beneath Tsurlagol. By the siege's end, the southwest and western walls of Tsurlagol were destroyed, thanks partially to the Siegebreakers diverting a river beneath it and mostly to use Archlis using the Moaning Diamond to collapse them. Fottergrim and Archlis were slain, Procampur's armies victorious, and Tsurlagol was liberated. Fottergrim's silver-plated skull was mounted on a pillar halfway between the two cities with a warning against threatening Procampur's allies.",
            "Modern history": "In the [[1317 DR|Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR]], the [[Plague of Dragons]] quickly spread around the Inner Sea, from the [[Vilhon Reach]] to [[Impiltur]]. As it reached them, Tsurlagol declared a quarantine against the plague.\n\nBy as late as the early 1350s DR, the city could still be known as \"Chessagol\", and was home to King [[Osbrun]]. In the [[1351 DR|Year of the Crown, 1351 DR]], the king's treasury and armory were robbed—by magic, some said. This included the shield called ''[[Thurbrand's protector]]'', sold by the warrior [[Thurbrand]] to Osbrun some time before. <ref group=\"note\">''[[The Magister (sourcebook)|The Magister]]'' uses the old name \"Chessagol\", at odds with the more common name of \"Tsurlagol\" used in earlier history and earlier sources. It may be that the old name survives, or that this Chessagol is in fact a different locale."
        },
        "Demographics": "In [[1372 DR]], the city was listed with a population of 17,594, making it the smallest of the sister-cities of the Vast. The human population was of largely [[Chondathan]] and [[Damaran]] extraction.",
        "Government & Politics": {
            "Relations": "Tsurlagol was one of the five so-called \"sister cities\" of the Vast, together with [[Calaunt]], [[Procampur]], [[Ravens Bluff]], and [[Tantras]]. It was the smallest of the five.\n\nTsurlagol had a long-term alliance with neighboring Procampur,{{Cite web/More of the Underdark and the Vast|}} with a mutual defense pact. According to the treaty, Procampur promised to protect Tsurlagol against outside invasion, or liberate it if conquered, and could recover any expenses for the effort from Tsurlagol's treasury. Procampur actually kept to this promise, such as when Tsurlagol was occupied by an [[orc]]ish and [[goblinoid]] horde in 1246 DR. In exchange, Tsurlagol provided financial aid and spying services to Procampur. The arrangement was beneficial to both cities."
        },
        "Economy & Trade": "Tsurlagol was a prosperous city with a busy port. It was the last such city on the north coast of the [[Inner Sea]], before one reached [[Impiltur]] and the [[Unapproachable East]], giving it the title \"the Gateway to the Unapproachable East\". In this position, it became a crossroads and meeting place for traders and sailors from the Vast, Impiltur, the [[Vilhon Reach]], and the [[Old Empires]]. The city also saw a great number of [[dwarf|dwarves]] travelling through, transporting [[metal]]s, [[sword]]s, messages, and other errands between their kind.\n\nThe city was an open and free port for all, allowing even pirates and smugglers to enter and do business with legitimate merchants, provided that they behaved while they were there. As such, it was also known as \"Pirate's Haven\". A number of former pirates became merchants based in Tsurlagol. Nevertheless, many denizens of the [[Pirate Isles]] kept hideouts in the city, where they could stash stolen goods, contraband and prisoners.\n\nThe city had a number of regular traders. Among others, from [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[1370 DR]]: the [[Smokeflower House]] merchant house sold goods from [[Altumbel]]; the \"Old Masters\" of the [[Brotherhood of Wool Carders and Weavers]] sold bolts of cloth and bales of wool; and the [[Zorden]] noble family operated its merchant fleet out of Tsurlagol and other cities. Over the [[Inner Sea]], [[glass]] from [[Turmish]] was imported, and [[copper]] and [[iron]] from the mines of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] were exported to Turmish and [[Chondath]].\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Vellard Sisters Shipwright]] was a major shipbuilder that crafted [[raker]]s or battle-[[caravel]]s, three at a time, with [[Selvard Haeleophar]], Master Shipbuilder, of [[Telflamm]] being Vellard Sisters' main competitor.{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-01-13 - Warship Builders}}",
        "Culture & Society": {
            "Merchants": "Quite a number of the city's most prominent [[merchant]]s were once involved in piracy, which they called the \"Free Trade\". Living off their ill-gotten riches, they retired to the shore to acquire respectability.",
            "Religion": "Tsurlagol was unusual for having relatively few [[temple]]s, [[Tymora]]. However, it was a major center of worship of Helm, and the [[Noble Hand]] was the most prominent temple of the god.\n\nIn Tsurlagoli funereal rites, the dead were cremated and their bones stored in ossuaries, and kept in underground crypts.",
            "Thieves": "The thieves of Tsurlagol had such close ties with the pirates and smugglers who came through the city that they shared some similarities and overlap. Many were either former pirates or smugglers, or others who aspired to such a life on the sea. They were familiar with sailing and navigation, and were more likely to hide contraband about their persons than to hide themselves in the shadows (which were scarce on the deck of a boat). They tended towards a semi-nomadic lifestyle, traveling alone and less likely to pick up henchmen.\n\nTsurlagoli thieves were of the opinion that, as [[mage]]s didn't pretend to be pirates, they should not pretend to be mages. As such, they rarely mastered the tricks of using [[spell]]-[[scroll]]s.\n\nCuriously, the city once had two thieves' guilds divided by gender: one open only to men, and the other only to women. However, the men's guild was wiped out, leaving only the women's, which later also accepted male members. However, this guild was the [[Sharwomen]], which was directly controlled by the [[Cult of the Shadow]] temple of [[Shar]]."
        },
        "Layout": {
            "Temples": "Unusually, the city had relatively few [[temple]]s for its size, namely:\n* [[Selûne]]: [[The Rising Moon]]\n* [[Umberlee]]: [[Battering Wave]]\n* [[Shar]]: [[Cult of the Shadow]]\n* [[Helm]]: [[Noble Hand]]\n* [[Tymora]].\nThe Cult of the Shadow temple also doubled as a thieves' guild.Although the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' 2nd edition (revised): ''A Grand Tour of the Realms'' and ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'' state that Tsurlagol has only three temples—those of Selûne, Umberlee, and Shar—the latter source also mentions a temple of Tymora and ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' adds one of Helm, bringing the number to five. This implies that the temples of Helm and Tymora may be very new or very small, or that they are in fact [[shrine]]s. The Noble Hand doubles as a guard training school, which may also discount it from this list."
        },
        "Organizations": "The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were represented in Tsurlagol at the [[Thayan enclave]], established in [[1368 DR]].\n\nThere were once two thieves' guilds in the city, divided by gender. The men's guild was wiped out years before [[1367 DR]], but the women's guild, called the [[Sharwomen]], began accepting male members. They were, however, controlled by the local cult of [[Shar]].",
        "Local Legends & Rumors": "The ruins of old Tsurlagols were a favorite target of [[adventurer]]s and they were often explored. They were inhabited by a variety of [[undead]] and other monsters, and others that came in to prey on the adventurers. They acquired a reputation for being dangerous, so many entrances were sealed. But with each succeeding city, the entrances and locations and knowledge of the ruins became lost to history.\n\nLocal tales imagined the ruins to be full of great treasures and magical artifacts, but most were well-looted. The [[Moaning Diamond]] [[artifact]] came to Tsurlagol early in its history, was rediscovered in a crypt beneath it in 1246 DR, and was lost beneath the city again.\n\nThe royal regalia of old Chessagol was said to be buried with King Meldath I of Impiltur, in his tomb in the [[Hill of Tombs]]."
