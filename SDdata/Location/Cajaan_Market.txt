Cajann Market was a vast, open-air marketplace in Calimport.
By both day and night, the marketplace was full of bazaar carts and stands with merchants hawking their wares. The sabbalad, Pasha Nur el Wariq, charged high fees for use of the selling space.
The market took up the majority of Cajaan Sabban in Grand Ward and covered three separate drudachs Dabun, Samelej, and Mitadh.
The site was once the home of Cajaan Bazaar, which included four shining white-marble khanduqs built during the Third Age of Calimshan when the Cajaan Dynasty ruled. The vast sums of gold stored in the khanduqs melted and poured down into the Muzad to be collected by the undercitys citizens of dubious reputation.
