'''Highmoon''' was a large town and the capital of [[Deepingdale]], known to be the secondmost well-integrated settlement of [[human]]s, [[elves]], and [[half-elves]] in all of [[Faerûn]], after [[Luruar]]'s [[Silverymoon]]. It was prosperous, exciting and often full of adventurers and travelers from [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and beyond.

==Government==
Highmoon was led by the [[Lord of Highmoon]], who also served as the ruler over all of Deepingdale. By [[1372 DR]], this position was held by [[Theremen Ulath]].

==History==
The city was founded in the late 11{{th}} century DR, but grew quickly over its 400-year existence. The population rose to over 3000 by [[1372 DR]] and over 8000 by [[1479 DR]]. Although early growth of the city was stymied by a lack of military support, conflicts with [[church of Vhaeraun|Vhaeraunian]] (particularly [[Clan Auzkovyn|Auzkovyn]]) Drow of Cormanthor spurred its expansion and fortification.

Highmoon was attacked on [[Tarsakh 17]], the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], by the [[black dragon]] [[Zarlandris]], who destroyed the [[Tower of the Rising Moon]] before being killed.{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|71}}

==Notable Locations==

* Lords' Barracks: This military structure was home to the [[Watchmen of Highmoon]]. It also housed some of the elven archers that defended Deepingdale and had a small building that served as their collective armory, storing their armaments of hundreds of weapons and sets of armor.
* The [[Leaves of Learning]]: This temple to [[Oghma]], led by Learned Father Higher Atlar [[Hasicor Danali]], contained one of best libraries in [[Faerûn]]. Notably, it excluded [[magic]]al matters from its shelves.
* The crypt of the [[Twelve Dancing Wizards]]: an invisible mausoleum that floated above Highmoon's rooftops.

* [[Silverhand House]]: This merchant coster exported rare woods, resin, [[amber]], and furs to the cities of [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]] and [[Ordulin]].

;Inns & Taverns:
* [[Oak and Spear]]: A taproom known for their local homebrew.
* [[The Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]]: This rowdy inn was regulated by its owner, the retired adventurer [[Gorstag]].
* [[The Silver Shield]]: A rather fancy inn, run by an elven family.
