Highmoon was a large town and the capital of Deepingdale, known to be the secondmost well-integrated settlement of humans, elves, and half-elves in all of Faerûn, after Luruars Silverymoon. It was prosperous, exciting and often full of adventurers and travelers from Cormyr, Sembia, and beyond.
Highmoon was led by the Lord of Highmoon, who also served as the ruler over all of Deepingdale. By 1372 DR, this position was held by Theremen Ulath.
The city was founded in the late 11 century DR, but grew quickly over its 400-year existence. The population rose to over 3000 by 1372 DR and over 8000 by 1479 DR. Although early growth of the city was stymied by a lack of military support, conflicts with Vhaeraunian (particularly Auzkovyn) Drow of Cormanthor spurred its expansion and fortification.
Highmoon was attacked on Tarsakh 17, the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, by the black dragon Zarlandris, who destroyed the Tower of the Rising Moon before being killed.
