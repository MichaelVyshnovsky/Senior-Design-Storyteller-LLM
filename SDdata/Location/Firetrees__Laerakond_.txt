Firetrees, originally named Durlyndbold and later Raurokh, was a ruined fortress located in eastern Eskorn, Laerakond.
The fortress was located in a scorched land of tumbled stones, amid a forest of burned tree trunks and fire-blackened rocks where no new plants could grow, hence its name. The fortress was enveloped in a powerful magic that warped the senses, abilities, and shapes of any living creatures, and mysterious eerie lights drifted about its ruins.
Terrible monsters plagued the land and scholars also believed the place was cursed with a mysterious sentient spell. Unknown to most people, a few tribes of dragonborn also lived in the subterranean ruins of Firetrees since centuries before the Spellplague.
The fortress was built by dwarves in the ancient past of the world of Abeir, and originally was named Durlyndbold. When a sentient spell appeared and began to spread a plague that rotted flesh, the dwarves abandoned Durlyndbold and scattered across Abeir.
The fortress was later reclaimed by the gold dragon Raurokhymdhar, who renamed it Raurokh and transformed it into a dragonborn prison and a laboratory to create more slaves. Among the dragonborn who lived in Raurokh was the legendary hero Shasphur.
After the death of Raurokhymdhar, only a few scattered tribes of dragonborn remained in 
Raurokh, and the fortress was abandoned and mostly forgotten. Eventually, the people of Eskorn began to call the place Firetrees.
