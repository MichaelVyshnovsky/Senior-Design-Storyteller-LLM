'''Songfarla''' was an ancient and hidden [[rock gnome]] realm located in the eastern spur of the [[Sunrise Mountains]].

==Geography==
Songfarla was located in the eastern Sunrise Mountains at the source of the most northwestern tributary of the [[River Murghol]], which was approximately equidistant from the ruins of [[Delhumide]] and the [[Lake of Mists]].

==Trade==
To maintain their hidden existence, the gnomes of Songfarla traded their goods quietly, utilizing merchants who claimed no affiliation with any realm. These merchants operated in [[Almorel]], [[Murghyr]], and [[Duirtanal]] for things that the gnomes could not make themselves—they were otherwise completely self-sufficient.

==Defenses==
Songfarla's greatest defense was its anonymity. Not even the [[Thay]]an Zulkir of Divination knew of its existence. Practically all passages into and around Songfarla were hidden by powerful [[illusion]] magic.

==History==
A settlement in the Sunrise Mountains was founded by escaped slaves from [[Netheril]]. In {{Yearlink|-3149}}, it became the kingdom of Songfarla when its population exploded with an influx of more refugees.{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|56}}

The kingdom was later caught up in the wars between [[Raumathar]] and [[Narfell]], when conjured [[demon]]s attacked in {{Yearlink|-555}}. Afterwards, the gnomes cloaked their realm in illusions to avoid future detection and attack.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|-469}}, the population of Songfarla was dwindling until four [[svirfneblin]] clans migrated there, the [[Covarrkar]], [[Fungusfoot]], [[Glasszhorm]], and [[Longstepper]] clans.

==Rumors & Legends==
Gnomish tales tell of the purchase of Songfarla's lands for a massive piece of fool's gold, though whom the lands were bought from and even if it was fool's gold that was used (another common tale says gilded [[granite]]) could change with the teller.

==Notable Locations==
The Gilded Nugget was a vast cavern within the mountains located in the thickest part of a massive gold vein that was somehow naturally studded with gemstones. The Nugget was a center of both government and worship (it was considered one of [[Garl Glittergold]]'s greatest temples) as well as a community hub for other activities, including commerce and the arts.
