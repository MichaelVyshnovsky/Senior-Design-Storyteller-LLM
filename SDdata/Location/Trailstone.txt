'''Trailstone''' was an [[Amn]]ian village on the border with [[Tethyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It defected to the latter in {{yearlink|1370}}.

==Description==
By {{yearlink|1370}}, Trailstone was a modest village, with no great landmarks.

===Geographical Features===
Southwest of the settled area, there was a haunted burial mound; on the southeastern downward slope, the mound had a [[refuge]] created by [[Maldiglas Turntower]].{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|75}}There are inconsistencies in the sources for the founding of Trailstone. The inn is alternatively stated to be created in 1316 or in 1348, as is the town. This article makes the assumption that the 1348 date refers to the New Spulzeer Inn, while a third inn was built in 1326 after the fire, while the conflicting information from FR3 is superseded by the latter sources.

==Government==
The place had a mayor, [[Jordy Droverson]], as of {{yearlink|1370}}.

==Trade==
Its defection to [[Tethyr]] had far-ranging consequences for the latter.{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Tethyr|18}} Locally, however, most of the inhabitants were subsistence farmers, offering few services other than drink and a stop along the [[Tethir Road]].

==Defenses==
As of {{yearlink|1370}}, one of the troops garrisoned here was commanded by [[Timoth Eyesbright]]. [[Geiron Hawkwinter]] was also attached as a scribe.{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Tethyr|79}}

The zone was also patrolled by the garrison of [[Chevangard]].{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Tethyr|88}}

==History==
The town rose around the [[Spulzeer Inn]], which was raised by the [[Spulzeer]] family in {{yearlink|1316}}{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Amn|22}}{{cite book/Castle Spulzeer|7}}. Another inn was built after a fire in {{yearlink|1326}}; a third inn, the [[New Spulzeer Inn]], was built in {{yearlink|1348}} by [[Rafe Spulzeer]].{{cite book/Castle Spulzeer|36}}{{cite book/Empires of the Sands|13-14}} At first, Trailstone was seen as a mere watering hole and rest stop, but it gained notoriety through its defection.{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Amn|52}}

In [[Ches]] of {{yearlink|1370}}, the communities of Trailstone and [[Riatavin]] announced their intention to defect from Amn and join Tethyr: the shocked Tethyrian court at [[Darromar]] sent a representative from the local counts. The response from Amn's [[Council of Six]] was brusque enough that it prompted Queen [[Zaranda Star]] of Tethyr to officially recognize both settlements as under the protection of Tethyr; troops were sent late in the month to reinforce the location, and the [[Order of the Blue Boar]] was conscripted to reinforce [[Spellshire]].{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Tethyr|51}}

The two communities defecting cited their economic and political treatment as the reason for their rebellion; Maztican trade had not benefited them at all, as all wealth and influence went to northern, southern, and western Amn. By the end of the second [[tenday]] of [[Tarsakh]], Amnian officials had officially resigned themselves to the loss.{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Amn|23}}

By [[Kythorn]], more than half of the [[Shadow Thieves]] operatives in the city were found dead. The troops remained garrisoned past [[Eleint]] of that year, though Tethyr was on a war footing elsewhere.{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Tethyr|52}} Because of the situation, while the location remained a small watering hole, it had swelled to nearly twice its size with soldiers.

The [[Vinson]] family retreated to its holdings in Trailstone after the death of [[Kirsoph Vinson]].{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Amn|10}}
