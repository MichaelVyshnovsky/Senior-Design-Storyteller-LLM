Harheldur () was a small, little-known kingdom of dwarves in east Faerûn. It was home to the Harheld clan of dwarves.
The realm lay beneath the easternmost Sunrise Mountains, near Thay and Murghôm.
As of the 15 century DR, Harheldur traded with Murghôm but not with Thay, producing and exporting salt, bowls, small tools, and hinges.
