        "Geography": "It was located at an intersection of the [[Ithal Road]], right where it split to lead either to [[Ithal Pass]] or [[Saradush]].",
        "Description": "The abbey had three corner towers, each one with a temple dedicated to one of its three deities. The other buildings of the abbey, including the central keep, were devoted to the collective worship of the Triad.",
        "History": "Barakmordin was founded in the [[839 DR|Year of Ten Atonements, 839 DR]], during the reign of King [[Samyte]] of Tethyr. The original incarnation of the abbey was a shrine for Torm, with partial fortifications and a garrison. The abbey was partially destroyed in the [[909 DR|Year of the Ogre, 909 DR]] by a [[goblin]] horde from the [[Omlarandin Mountains]]. When the abbey was reconstructed, the three distinctive corner towers were added. A shrine to [[Ilmater]] was added in the [[1070 DR|Year of the Spawning, 1070 DR]], as thanks for the Tormish abbey's loyalty to the [[Lions' Dynasty]] during a period of political turmoil. Further donations were made by King [[Alemander I]], who funded the construction of outer walls and a large, central keep. A group of Tyrran paladins aided the abbey during a monster attack, proving their order's worth. In the [[1198 DR|Year of the Lean Purse, 1198 DR]],''Lands of Intrigue: Tethyr'' (p. 90) erroneously claims that this event occurred in \"the Year of Three Faces, 1198 DR\". [[1198 DR]] is the Year of the Lean Purse; [[1089 DR]] is the Year of Three Faces. It is unclear which year is intended. the abbey became dedicated to the Triad as a whole.",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin]], an organization of holy warriors devoted to the Triad, were based out of Barakmordin."
