The '''Halls of the Hunting Axe''' were halls that were part of the [[dwarven]] realm of [[Besilmer]] before falling into ruin when the realm fell. 

==Geography==
They were located {{SI|30|miles}} South-East of the [[Stone Bridge]] and were used as a dwarven city, occupied by the [[Delzoun]]. 

==Description==
The halls were constructed of stone with arched walls, and once contained windows consisting of coloured mosaics. They featured gardens and a moat. As of [[1368 DR]], the smashed shards of coloured glass were popular for use in making bottles.

==Inhabitants==
As of 1368 DR the ruins were occupied by [[doppelganger]]s and [[leucrotta]], who prefered to attack at night.
