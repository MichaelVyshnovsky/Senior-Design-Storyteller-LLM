        "mainbody": "arastrixhurthi (\"A fortress fit for dragons\" in Draconic) was an ancient kobold nation. It was a vassal state to the dragon kingdom of Darastriverthicha during the last millennium of the Dawn Ages (), located in what was later the Shoal of Thirst. It was ruled by Kurtulmak. \nDarastrixhurthi was made up of many kobold metropolises known as labyrinths.\nAccording to kobold legend, the then-mortal Kurtulmak built Darastrixhurthi after being released from service by his mistress, the  green dragon Caesinsjach. His aim was to create a lair as majestic as the one he built for Caesinsjach, so he found a place with a near limitless supply of metal ore and precious stones. Although he intended to build the lair by himself, he soon was helped by many of his brethren, and the resulting mine became the most structurally sound and resourcefully designed fortress of the age. \nAccording to the Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, Darastrixhurthi was inhabited by a great number of kobolds as well as urds, originally appointed by their dragon masters as defenders of the city, but eventually elevated as a caste higher than their land-bound brethren.\nNear the end of the Time of Dragons, kobold miners broke into some gem-encrusted caverns below their labyrinths, where they met the first gnomes. The kobolds quickly enslaved them and stole their soul-gems, where many unborn gnomes still slept.\nDarastrixhurthi was destroyed around , during the first Rage of Dragons. According to the Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants, while Caesinsjach and her fellow dragons attacked Darastrixhurthi, Garl Glittergold seized the opportunity to rescue the gnome soul-gems trapped by the kobolds and then destroyed the fortress while fleeing pursuers, creating the Hidden Lake.\nAfter the destruction of Darastrixhurthi, Asgorath elevated both Kurtulmak and the dragonwrought kobold Kuraulyek to divinity, to ensure the survival of the kobold and urd races.\nThe few kobold and urd survivors of Darastrixhurthi fled to the lands around the Moonsea, and later spread west to the Ice Lakes near Luskan, and east to the later-destroyed kingdom of Zexthandrim in the Mountains of Copper."
