The Whalebones were an archipelago located in the Trackless Sea, located east of Ruathym and north of the Korinn Archipelago. The islands were called the Whalebones because of the whale skeletons that could be found on the islands beaches.
Petty, warmongering kings ruled over the islands, often skirmishing in battles whose casualties rarely exceeded a few dozen. The larger islands were home to massive rocs that were used as mounts by the storm giants of Maelstrom. The islanders paid tribute to the rocs and giants by leaving them food and treasure.
Finback, the tallest island of the Whalebones, held the lair of the crazed bronze dragon, Tauntzoth of the Rocks, prior to her death.
