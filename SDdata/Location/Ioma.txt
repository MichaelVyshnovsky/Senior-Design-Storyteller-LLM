Ioma was a small island in the Nelanther Isles to the west of Amn.
The island had only one town, Ioma Town, with a population of 800 in 1479 DR. Most of the island was occupied by a mountain of the same name, which contained a large vein of Iomic crystal at its peak.
By the late 15th century DR, the island had become a competitor of Skaugs, although its port was only half as large. The island was protected by a small cadre of Cowled Wizards from Amn.
