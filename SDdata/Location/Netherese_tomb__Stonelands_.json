        "mainbody": "A '''Netherese tomb''' in the [[Stonelands]] was the site of conflict in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}",
        "Geography": "The tomb was located in a dry, dusty region of the [[Stonelands]]. It was connected to an extensive cave network that went deep underground to the [[Underdark]], linking to [[Daeronnax]]'s lair and a small [[Drow outpost (Stonelands)|drow outpost]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The area around the tomb was inhabited by [[harpies]], [[lizardfolk]], and [[scorpion]]s. Deeper in the caves around the tomb lived [[sand mephit]]s, [[bat]]s, [[umber hulk]]s, more lizardfolk, and the [[kobolds]] of [[Clan Daeronnax]].\n\nThe tomb itself was home to the [[mummy]] [[Laeron]], and a number of loyal [[tomb guardian]]s, [[skeleton warrior]]s, [[quell]]s, and [[wheep]]s.",
        "History": "During the 1480s [[DR]], the tomb was invaded by the [[adventurer]]s [[Popkin Shortshanks]], [[Jarull Cartcoster]], [[Liantor Stoneborn]], [[Helayna]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], and [[Tristran of Daggerford]]. They smashed a few [[undead]] and then passed through the secret passage behind Laeron's throne into the deeper caves, where they were ambushed and defeated by Clan Daeronnax kobolds. Popkin escaped and sought aid, sending a second team of adventurers to rescue her friends. By the time the reinforcements arrived, Laeron and more guardians had roused to defend the tomb, only to be smashed down again."
