'''Yinazzil''' was a small town found along the coast within the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region of [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
Yinazzil was found approximately {{SI|110|mi|k}} southwest of [[Rog'osto]] along the coast of [[Bahr al-Ajami]]. It lay at the edge of the jungle but was not close to any of the mighty rivers of the Ruined Kingdoms, making the purpose of its location somewhat puzzling.
