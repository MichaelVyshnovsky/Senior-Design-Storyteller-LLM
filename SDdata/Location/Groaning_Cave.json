It was also believed to safeguard myriad of priceless elven treasures.\nThe cave could be found in the northern end of Evereska, just beyond the Hall of the High Hunt.\nSome said that the depths of the cave housed the mythal that enveloped and protected Evereska and the outskirts leading to the Vine Vale."
