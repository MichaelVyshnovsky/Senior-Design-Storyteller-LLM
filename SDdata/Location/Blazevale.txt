The '''Blazevale''' was a valley near [[Evereska]] that separated the [[Sharaedim]] from the [[Greycloak Hills]] to the north.

It was a broad, sand-scoured valley. It was made up of scrubby [[pine]]s, [[cactus|cacti]], and [[wolfroot]], where only the hardiest of [[rabbit]]s, [[moon fox]]es, [[mice]], [[lizard]]s, and [[meadow quail]] survived.<ref>
