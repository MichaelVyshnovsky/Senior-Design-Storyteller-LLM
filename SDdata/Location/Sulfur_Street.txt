'''Sulfur Street''' was a street located in the wealthier second quarter of the city of [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]].<ref>

==History==
On [[Tarsakh 3]], [[1361 DR]], [[black firedrake]]s that were being secretly bred underground beneath the city of Innarlith by the clandestine [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rym√ºt]] escaped from their hatchery and rampaged through the city. Sulfur Street was located near their point of entry onto the surface and at least three blocks of the street caught fire from the fires created by the black firedrakes. The street was also filled with bodies of victims.<ref>
