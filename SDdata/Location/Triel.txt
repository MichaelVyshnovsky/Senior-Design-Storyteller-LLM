Triel was a small village in the Fields of the Dead located at the intersection of the Trade Way and the Dusk Road, south of Boareskyr Bridge. The city of Elturel was located to the southwest and the Trielta Hills were located to the northeast.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the ruler of Triel was Elvar the Grainlord. By 1479 DR, Triel was part of Elturgard.

Triel had a log-and-boulder stockade and locked its gates at night. Most travelers were unwelcome after dark.
Triel had few farms in the area and had to import everything it needed, especially food.
Much of the room behind the stockade was used to store grain and dry vegetables for the winter months when merchant visits were few and far between.
By , Triel had been incorporated into the young theocratic realm of Elturgard.
