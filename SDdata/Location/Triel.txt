'''Triel''' was a small village in the [[Fields of the Dead]] located at the intersection of the [[Trade Way]] and the [[Dusk Road]], south of [[Boareskyr Bridge]]. The city of [[Elturel]] was located to the southwest and the [[Trielta Hills]] were located to the northeast.

==Government==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the ruler of Triel was [[Elvar the Grainlord]]. By [[1479 DR]], Triel was part of [[Elturgard]].<ref>

==Notable Locations==
* [[Singing Wind Inn]]

==Defenses==
{{Fq|text=Castles are well and good for impressing people, covering over dungeon cells, and keeping all the neighboring rats dry. But if you've not the strength to hold them when some armed host comes to call, they rapidly become grand and expensive tombs.|source=[[Oren Bel Danarr]], Sage of Triel, ''Musing on the Realms''{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|95}}}}
Triel had a log-and-boulder stockade and locked its gates at night. Most travelers were unwelcome after dark.

==Trade==
Triel had few farms in the area and had to import everything it needed, especially food.

Much of the room behind the stockade was used to store grain and dry vegetables for the winter months when merchant visits were few and far between.

==History==
By {{Yearlink|1479}}, Triel had been incorporated into the young theocratic realm of [[Elturgard]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Brinna Brightsong]], a 15{{th}} century [[DR]] [[bard]], killed by the [[Cult of the Absolute]].
* [[Gomwick]], a 15{{th}} century messenger, killed by [[gnoll]]s.
* [[Oren Bel Danarr]], The Sage of Triel.
