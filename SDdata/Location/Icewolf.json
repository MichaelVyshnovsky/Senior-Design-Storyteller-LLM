        "mainbody": "'''Icewolf''' was a small village located on the [[Ice Peak]].",
        "Government": "The [[shaman]], [[Bleak Sky at Morning]], ruled over this village. The governor and the rest of the village were anti-[[Luskan]], and would not support them in their conquests. Luskan, however, did not see Icewolf as a threat.",
        "Defenses": "Icewolf had a standing army of 50 warriors, as well as several large boats.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, [[mage]]s of [[Hellgate Keep]] infiltrated the village and tried to find the location of [[Thlaaklauthimir]]'s lair. After getting permission from the shaman, the [[Heroes of Ascore]] slew the robed mages and the great [[white dragon]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that a shipwreck lay very close to the village, and that it contained a vast sum of valuables.",
        "Notable Locations": "The village contained a temple, a training hall, and a gem-trader's office. An Ice Hunter [[cleric]] had a home here, and he provided treatment for the injured. There was a small [[Northlander]] complex to the north of the village, which was also the place of the [[magical]] ''[[Northhelm]]''. A [[cursed]] [[ring]], known as the ''[[ring of vulnerability]]'', was stashed in a chest by mages of Hellgate Keep. Icewolf Village was the last stop before ascending to [[Freezefire]]'s lair.",
        "Inhabitants": "Though originally only inhabited by Ice Hunters, many Northlanders moved into the village. [[Yeti]]s and [[ice hound]]s also roamed the settlement.\n\nThe women of Icewolf wore very expensive jewellery, from ancient [[gold]] to [[platinum]] coins."
