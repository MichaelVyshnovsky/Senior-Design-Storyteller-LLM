        "mainbody": "Icewolf was a small village located on the Ice Peak.\nThe shaman, Bleak Sky at Morning, ruled over this village. The governor and the rest of the village were anti-Luskan, and would not support them in their conquests. Luskan, however, did not see Icewolf as a threat.\nIcewolf had a standing army of 50 warriors, as well as several large boats.\nIn the , mages of Hellgate Keep infiltrated the village and tried to find the location of Thlaaklauthimirs lair. After getting permission from the shaman, the Heroes of Ascore slew the robed mages and the great white dragon.\nIt was rumored that a shipwreck lay very close to the village, and that it contained a vast sum of valuables.\nThe village contained a temple, a training hall, and a gem-traders office. An Ice Hunter cleric had a home here, and he provided treatment for the injured. There was a small Northlander complex to the north of the village, which was also the place of the magical Northhelm. A cursed ring, known as the ring of vulnerability, was stashed in a chest by mages of Hellgate Keep. Icewolf Village was the last stop before ascending to Freezefires lair.\nThough originally only inhabited by Ice Hunters, many Northlanders moved into the village. Yetis and ice hounds also roamed the settlement.\nThe women of Icewolf wore very expensive jewellery, from ancient gold to platinum coins."
