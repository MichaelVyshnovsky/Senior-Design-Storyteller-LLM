'''Port Nyanzaru'''<ref group=note name=note1>The spelling is "Nyanzaru" in all written sources until ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' but is spelled "Nyranzaru" on the map that came with [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'']]. In ''[[Tomb of Annihilation]]'' the city is again spelled "Nyanzaru", which implies that "Nyranzaru" was simply a misspelling. was a port city in northern [[Chult]] and the major trading center for all of Chult.<ref name=TJoC-p27>

Although independent in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]],<ref name=TJoC-p27 /> it subsequently became an [[Amn]]ian colony until at least [[1479 DR]]<ref name=FRCG-p102/> before regaining independence sometime in the 1480s DR.{{ToA-time}}

==Geography==
The small port city was located on the [[Bay of Chult]] at the mouths of the [[River Soshenstar]] and the [[River Tiryki]].<ref name=TJoC-p27/> It was built atop four hills: [[Mount Sibasa]], [[Temple Hill (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple Hill]], [[Throne Hill]], and [[Yklwazi Hill]].

Accessing Port Nyanzaru by sea through the Bay of Chult required sailing through the domain of [[Aremag]], a great [[dragon turtle]] who demanded tribute from any and all passing ships.

===Wards and Districts===
[[File:Port_Nyanzaru_Map.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''A map of Port Nyanzaru.'']]The walled portion of the city was roughly separated into three wards: the upscale [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]], the bustling [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]], and the crowded [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]].

Additionally, three slum districts lay outside the city's walls: the [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]] to the west, [[Port Nyanzaru/Malar's Throat|Malar's Throat]] to the south, and [[Port Nyanzaru/Tiryki Anchorage|Tiryki Anchorage]] to the southeast.

==Government==
As of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, the [[Triceratops Society]] (a.k.a., the Ytepka Society) was the most powerful organization in Port Nyanzaru, and controlled the unloading and loading of all cargo at the docks. They kept tabs on all visitors coming ashore, especially if a visitor was suspected of being a [[mage]] or of carrying [[magic]] items. If the visitor headed off into the jungle, the Society would send agents to notify the surrounding villages.<ref name=TJoC-p27/>

Amn asserted colonial control in Chult during the late 14{{th}} century DR, and by the late 15{{th}} century DR, they controlled all mercantile activities in the city.<ref name=FRCG-p102/> The Amnian rulers were profiteers, and their taxes were notably high as residents were effectively charged for the safety that the city offered from the jungles. People unaffiliated with a major trading company were forced to live in the shantytowns outside the walls.<ref name=FRCG-p102/>

===Merchant Princes===
Sometime in the 1480s DR, the city gained independence from Amn due to the influence of a consortium of [[Chultan]] traders backed by the Triceratops Society. With help from the Society, the seven richest of these traders then rose to the title of [[merchant prince]]s and ruled the city in a council where each had equal vote. This council could freely create or change the laws of Port Nyanzaru, and would then defer to the city's judiciary to interpret their laws with wisdom and flexibility. The merchant princes took on relatively few day-to-day responsibilities of running the city&mdash;preferring to delegate to family members and underlings and somewhat inefficient, but it was reinforced by the vigilance of the Triceratops Society, who rooted out real and potential disruptors of the princes' rule. 

The merchant princes' power was predicated on their wealth and mercantile influence. The merchant princes' influence was thus almost entirely confined to Port Nyanzaru Their influence in the Old City was somewhat lessened by the presence of the so-called "[[Old City#Government|beggar princes]]", who controlled the area's thieves and used extortion and threats to wield unofficial political power in the district.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|7}}

The palace of [[Goldenthrone]] was the seat of power for the merchant princes. This was where they held audiences and met with their subjects or official visitors,

In addition to ruling the city, the merchant princes solidified their power by taking total control&mdash;either directly or through their intermediaries&mdash;over the sale and export of key products, trade goods, and services that passed through Port Nyanzaru. Any sale of a good or service which was claimed by a merchant prince but fell outside of their oversight was considered to be an illegal black market dealing. 

If a prince chose to retire, they could pass their wealth and title to a family member or to another wealthy individual of their choice, although their decision was subject to a vote among the other princes in the latter case. By the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the seven merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru were:

* [[Ekene-Afa]], who controlled the sale of [[weapon]]s (including [[magic weapon]]s), [[shield]]s, [[rain catcher]]s, [[canoe]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[wagon]]s, and other traveling gear.
* [[Ifan Talro'a]], who controlled the sale of [[beast]]s (most notably [[dinosaur]]s and [[flying monkey]]s) and the training of such beasts.
* [[Jessamine]], who controlled the sale of [[herb]]s and other [[:Category:Plants|plants]] as well as [[poison]]s and writs of assassination.
* [[Jobal]], who controlled the sale of jungle guide services and mercenary services.
* [[Kwayoth√©]], who controlled the sale of [[alcohol]], [[insect repellent]], [[oil]], [[perfume]].
* [[Wakanga O'tamu]], who controlled the sale of lore, [[magic item]]s (including [[potion]]s and [[spell scroll]]s), and [[item enchantment]] services.
* [[Zhanthi]], who controlled the sale of [[cloth]], [[gem]]s, [[jewelry]], and nonmagical and nonmetal [[armor]].

===Law and Order===
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the city was patrolled by guards paid by the merchant princes. In addition, certain laws&mdash;notably those that involved a threat to Chult's social fabric or to legal economic activity&mdash;were enforced by the Triceratops Society. The city's judges had broad leeway in their interpretation of laws, and fortunately, they had a reputation for being surprisingly resistant to bribes, intimidation, and other forms of corruption.

Most criminals were sentenced to [[Executioner's Run]], a beast-filled pit in the Old City where the brutal deaths of the condemned served as cheap entertainment for the city's populace. However, the Run offered the tantalizing promise of freedom, exoneration, and even fame if the condemned was able to escape the pit alive.

It was possible to legally kill someone in Port Nyanzaru by purchasing a "sanction" from the merchant prince Jessamine. These were writs that allowed for a specified individual to be killed via an approved method&mdash;usually by stabbing or by poisoning&mdash;and cost a minimum of 150 [[gold pieces]] (which was subject to be raised based on factors such as the reason for the sanction, the status of the target, and the ability of the purchaser to pay). These were not common&mdash;no more than six sanctions tended to be sold in a given year&mdash;and many chose not to purchase sanctions for fear of being sanctioned themselves in retaliation.

Smugglers and black market sellers were dealt with particularly harshly under Port Nyanzaru's laws. [[Slavery]] was not illegal, although it was unwelcome in the city and slavers were not able to do business with the merchant princes.

==Trade==
Abundant wealth passed through Port Nyanzaru,{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|4}} and a wide variety of both mundane and exotic goods could be found in the city. The majority of foreign trade took place in the [[Grand Souk]] while locals made more use of the [[Red Bazaar]],{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|6}} As the sale of most goods was governed by the merchant princes' monopolies, foreign traders had to work through the princes' agents to legally do business in the city. Ships arriving into port were subject to inspection, sometimes with the use of [[Zindar|the Harbormaster]]'s magic, and customs agents might confiscate trade goods.

The city's main exports were resources from the jungle and the mountains, including jewels, [[gold]], [[timber]] (notably from [[rubber tree]]s), exotic plants (and poisons, [[perfume]]s, and [[medicine]]s derived from them), and colorful textile [[dye]]s. and gem-cutting and jewelry-making were well established trades. The [[Dye works (Port Nyanzaru)|dye works]] in the Market Ward transformed imported cloth into colorful commodities beloved by both local and foreign buyers. The city's [[apothecaries]] also had long traditions of mixing poisons and antidotes.

==Culture==
Residents of Port Nyanzaru spoke the [[Chultan language]].

Cleanliness was very important to the people of Port Nyanzaru of all social classes. The people strove to bathe every day, either at the [[Public bathhouse (Port Nyanzaru)|public Bathhouse]], the [[Temple of Sune (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple of Sune]], or at one of the dozens of private bathhouses across the city. Saunas and baths were likewise the cornerstone of the villas of the city's rich. Thanks to the frequent rains, the city itself was also quite clean.

===Food and Drink===
The recreational alcohol of choice was [[tej]]. Popular foods in the city as of the late 15{{th}} century DR included [[atkilt wat]], [[asa wat]], [[crema Athkatla]], [[doro t'ibs]], [[kinche]], and [[kita]]. [[Fish]] and other seafood were staples, and were sold at a [[Fish market (Port Nyanzaru)|fish market]] in the Market Ward where prices tended to be higher in the mornings when the selection was better. Chultan fisherman preferred to fish in the ocean rather than the rivers because it was safer to stay out of the jungle. [[Reptile]] meat was also eaten, but was seen as tough and undesirable relative to fish.

===Entertainment===
[[File:Dinosaur_Race.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''A race through the streets of Port Nyanzaru.'']]
The people of Port Nyanzaru enjoyed loud and wild [[music]], and believed in enjoying every precious moment of life.

===Religion===
Like the rest of Chult, the people of Port Nyaznaru originally worshiped the [[Deity|greater god]] [[Ubtao]], the protector and patron of Chult. By the 14{{th}} century DR, worship of [[Savras]] had also gained traction in Port Nyanzaru, whose [[priest]]s provided the valuable service of keeping tabs on the inscrutable activities of their [[yuan-ti]] enemies.

Following Ubtao's apparent abandonment of Chult at the end of the 14{{th}} century DR, which was believed to be due to him growing tired of the people's warring amongst each other, the Chultan people of Port Nyanzaru came to accept the gods of northern missionaries, most notably [[Waukeen]], the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon|Faer√ªnian goddess]] of trade, who was popular among the city's powerful merchant class. This was accompanied by worship of [[Gond]], who was popular among the city's artisans, crafters and engineers; Savras, to whom one of the first [[Temple of Savras (Port Nyanzaru)|great temples]] to a foreign god was build in the city; [[Sune]], who was appreciated for her emphasis on beauty and cleanliness; and [[Tymora]], who was popular among the vulnerable lower-classes outside the protective city walls who relied on luck (and the defensive walls of the [[Temple of Tymora (Port Nyanzaru)|Tymoran temple]]) to protect them from jungle monsters.

Eventually, animosity arose against foreign missionaries, who were seen as exploiting the local populace. Thus, by the late 15{{th}} century DR, the city's priests were largely local Chultans even though their gods were foreign.

==Defenses==
The city was designed with defense as a priority due to the many pirates in the waters of the [[Shining Sea]].<ref name=TJoC-p27/> It was protected by a high stone wall<ref name=FRCG-p102/> that encompassed the inner wards of the city, while the slums remained outside and relatively undefended. Meanwhile, additional walls within the city created added security for important or wealthy areas. The walls themselves were massive edifices of fitted stone adorned with colorful geometric patterns and images of beasts and heroes. In cases of an attack from the sea, warning bells within the fort were sounded and a red beacon was lit atop the harbor's [[Lighthouse (Port Nyanzaru)|lighthouse]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, city had no standing army{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|24}} and the merchant princes made no effort to send mercenaries into the jungle to reduce the threats it posed. As such, the residents of the districts outside the walls organized their own volunteer "[[Citizens' Brigade]]" to defend themselves. In cases of an attack, warning [[horn]]s were used to tell people outside the walls to flee through the gates to safety.

Because of the hot and humid climate, Port Nyanzaru's defenders rarely wore [[heavy armor]], and preferred [[Leather armor|leather]] or [[hlang|dinosaur hide shields]] and [[hide armor|armor]]. However, there was growing interest in [[metal]] armor by the late 15{{th}} century DR, particularly in equipment made from lightweight [[titansteel]].

Thanks to the many rain traps located atop the buildings, it was easy to put out fires within the city.

==History==
===Ancient History===
A lost civilization once occupied the site that would become Port Nyanzaru, and left behind the great ziggurats of the Old City{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|35}}{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|9-10}} the Harbor Ward, and Tiryki Anchorage.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|7-8}} Their ruins were often filled with [[trap]]s{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|32}} and marked by carvings of wavy or circular patterns,{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|10}} perhaps even having them [[Embalming fluid|embalmed]] and placed in [[sarcophagi]] in tombs within or beneath the ziggurats.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|33}}

At some point, a temple to [[Umberlee]] was established in caves beneath the Harbor Ward, however this came to be abandoned.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|30}}

===1300s DR===
By the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, Port Nyanzaru had become the most important trade hub in all of Chult,<ref name=TJoC-p27 /> and maintained this distinction even after [[Mezro]] ended its isolation in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}.<ref name=TJoC-p27 /> While unconfirmed, it was thought that Port Nyanzaru's harbormaster during this time paid a monthly tribute to a powerful dragon turtle in exchange for keeping all other sea monsters from harming the port and hindering trade.<ref name=TJoC-p27/>

Under Amnian rule beginning in the late 14{{th}} century DR, Port Nyanzaru existed for the purpose of extracting resources for its foreign overlords, and people not affiliated with their trading companies were discriminated against and left exposed to the dangers and [[disease]]s of the jungle.<ref name=FRCG-p102 />

===1400s DR===
One night during the 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Pyramid of the Moon]] manifested within sight of Port Nyanzaru's walls. By morning, it had vanished along with over 200 people from the city, none of whom were ever seen again.

Amn withdrew from the city in the late 15{{th}} century DR. This was done under pressure from powerful merchants and after a realization that failure to surrender the city would mean a bloody conflict that would likely end with them losing control regardless.

In the late 1480s DR, [[vegepygmy]] outside of Port Nyanzaru was on the rise. The plant creatures threatened the port inhabitants' safety. Port Nyanzaru's government paid well to adventurers to venture out into the jungles and cull vegepygmies and their chieftains, slowing the creatures' rapid territory expansion.{{Template:Cite game/Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation}}

Nine years after the city's independence from Amn, the [[death curse]] struck [[Toril]], leading to an influx of adventurers to Port Nyanzaru seeking the curse's source.{{ToA-time}} At this time, a plot by yuan-ti to smuggle an artifact known as the ''[[Dreamer's Amulet]]'' into the city set of a frenzy of activity as the city's factions theorized that the item might be causing the death curse.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|3}}
