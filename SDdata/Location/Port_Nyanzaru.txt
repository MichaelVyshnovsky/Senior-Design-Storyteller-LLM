Port NyanzaruThe spelling is "Nyanzaru" in all written sources until Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide but is spelled "Nyranzaru" on the map that came with Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. In Tomb of Annihilation the city is again spelled "Nyanzaru", which implies that "Nyranzaru" was simply a misspelling. was a port city in northern Chult and the major trading center for all of Chult.
Although independent in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it subsequently became an Amnian colony until at least 1479 DR before regaining independence sometime in the 1480s DR.
The small port city was located on the Bay of Chult at the mouths of the River Soshenstar and the River Tiryki. It was built atop four hills Mount Sibasa, Temple Hill, Throne Hill, and Yklwazi Hill.
Accessing Port Nyanzaru by sea through the Bay of Chult required sailing through the domain of Aremag, a great dragon turtle who demanded tribute from any and all passing ships.

Additionally, three slum districts lay outside the citys walls the Old City to the west, Malars Throat to the south, and Tiryki Anchorage to the southeast.
As of the mid&ndash14 century DR, the Triceratops Society (a.k.a., the Ytepka Society) was the most powerful organization in Port Nyanzaru, and controlled the unloading and loading of all cargo at the docks. They kept tabs on all visitors coming ashore, especially if a visitor was suspected of being a mage or of carrying magic items. If the visitor headed off into the jungle, the Society would send agents to notify the surrounding villages.
Amn asserted colonial control in Chult during the late 14 century DR, and by the late 15 century DR, they controlled all mercantile activities in the city. The Amnian rulers were profiteers, and their taxes were notably high as residents were effectively charged for the safety that the city offered from the jungles. People unaffiliated with a major trading company were forced to live in the shantytowns outside the walls.
Sometime in the 1480s DR, the city gained independence from Amn due to the influence of a consortium of Chultan traders backed by the Triceratops Society. With help from the Society, the seven richest of these traders then rose to the title of merchant princes and ruled the city in a council where each had equal vote. This council could freely create or change the laws of Port Nyanzaru, and would then defer to the citys judiciary to interpret their laws with wisdom and flexibility. The merchant princes took on relatively few day-to-day responsibilities of running the city&mdashpreferring to delegate to family members and underlings and somewhat inefficient, but it was reinforced by the vigilance of the Triceratops Society, who rooted out real and potential disruptors of the princes rule. 
The merchant princes power was predicated on their wealth and mercantile influence. The merchant princes influence was thus almost entirely confined to Port Nyanzaru Their influence in the Old City was somewhat lessened by the presence of the so-called "beggar princes", who controlled the areas thieves and used extortion and threats to wield unofficial political power in the district.
The palace of Goldenthrone was the seat of power for the merchant princes. This was where they held audiences and met with their subjects or official visitors,
In addition to ruling the city, the merchant princes solidified their power by taking total control&mdasheither directly or through their intermediaries&mdashover the sale and export of key products, trade goods, and services that passed through Port Nyanzaru. Any sale of a good or service which was claimed by a merchant prince but fell outside of their oversight was considered to be an illegal black market dealing. 
If a prince chose to retire, they could pass their wealth and title to a family member or to another wealthy individual of their choice, although their decision was subject to a vote among the other princes in the latter case. By the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the seven merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru were
* Ekene-Afa, who controlled the sale of weapons (including magic weapons), shields, rain catchers, canoes, saddles, wagons, and other traveling gear.
* Ifan Talroa, who controlled the sale of beasts (most notably dinosaurs and flying monkeys) and the training of such beasts.
* Jessamine, who controlled the sale of herbs and other plants as well as poisons and writs of assassination.
* Jobal, who controlled the sale of jungle guide services and mercenary services.
* Kwayoth√©, who controlled the sale of alcohol, insect repellent, oil, perfume.
* Wakanga Otamu, who controlled the sale of lore, magic items (including potions and spell scrolls), and item enchantment services.
* Zhanthi, who controlled the sale of cloth, gems, jewelry, and nonmagical and nonmetal armor.
As of the late 15 century DR, the city was patrolled by guards paid by the merchant princes. In addition, certain laws&mdashnotably those that involved a threat to Chults social fabric or to legal economic activity&mdashwere enforced by the Triceratops Society. The citys judges had broad leeway in their interpretation of laws, and fortunately, they had a reputation for being surprisingly resistant to bribes, intimidation, and other forms of corruption.
Most criminals were sentenced to Executioners Run, a beast-filled pit in the Old City where the brutal deaths of the condemned served as cheap entertainment for the citys populace. However, the Run offered the tantalizing promise of freedom, exoneration, and even fame if the condemned was able to escape the pit alive.
It was possible to legally kill someone in Port Nyanzaru by purchasing a "sanction" from the merchant prince Jessamine. These were writs that allowed for a specified individual to be killed via an approved method&mdashusually by stabbing or by poisoning&mdashand cost a minimum of 150 gold pieces (which was subject to be raised based on factors such as the reason for the sanction, the status of the target, and the ability of the purchaser to pay). These were not common&mdashno more than six sanctions tended to be sold in a given year&mdashand many chose not to purchase sanctions for fear of being sanctioned themselves in retaliation.
Smugglers and black market sellers were dealt with particularly harshly under Port Nyanzarus laws. Slavery was not illegal, although it was unwelcome in the city and slavers were not able to do business with the merchant princes.
Abundant wealth passed through Port Nyanzaru, and a wide variety of both mundane and exotic goods could be found in the city. The majority of foreign trade took place in the Grand Souk while locals made more use of the Red Bazaar, As the sale of most goods was governed by the merchant princes monopolies, foreign traders had to work through the princes agents to legally do business in the city. Ships arriving into port were subject to inspection, sometimes with the use of the Harbormasters magic, and customs agents might confiscate trade goods.
The citys main exports were resources from the jungle and the mountains, including jewels, gold, timber (notably from rubber trees), exotic plants (and poisons, perfumes, and medicines derived from them), and colorful textile dyes. and gem-cutting and jewelry-making were well established trades. The dye works in the Market Ward transformed imported cloth into colorful commodities beloved by both local and foreign buyers. The citys apothecaries also had long traditions of mixing poisons and antidotes.
Residents of Port Nyanzaru spoke the Chultan language.
Cleanliness was very important to the people of Port Nyanzaru of all social classes. The people strove to bathe every day, either at the public Bathhouse, the Temple of Sune, or at one of the dozens of private bathhouses across the city. Saunas and baths were likewise the cornerstone of the villas of the citys rich. Thanks to the frequent rains, the city itself was also quite clean.
The recreational alcohol of choice was tej. Popular foods in the city as of the late 15 century DR included atkilt wat, asa wat, crema Athkatla, doro tibs, kinche, and kita. Fish and other seafood were staples, and were sold at a fish market in the Market Ward where prices tended to be higher in the mornings when the selection was better. Chultan fisherman preferred to fish in the ocean rather than the rivers because it was safer to stay out of the jungle. Reptile meat was also eaten, but was seen as tough and undesirable relative to fish.

The people of Port Nyanzaru enjoyed loud and wild music, and believed in enjoying every precious moment of life.
Like the rest of Chult, the people of Port Nyaznaru originally worshiped the greater god Ubtao, the protector and patron of Chult. By the 14 century DR, worship of Savras had also gained traction in Port Nyanzaru, whose priests provided the valuable service of keeping tabs on the inscrutable activities of their yuan-ti enemies.
Following Ubtaos apparent abandonment of Chult at the end of the 14 century DR, which was believed to be due to him growing tired of the peoples warring amongst each other, the Chultan people of Port Nyanzaru came to accept the gods of northern missionaries, most notably Waukeen, the Faer√ªnian goddess of trade, who was popular among the citys powerful merchant class. This was accompanied by worship of Gond, who was popular among the citys artisans, crafters and engineers Savras, to whom one of the first great temples to a foreign god was build in the city Sune, who was appreciated for her emphasis on beauty and cleanliness and Tymora, who was popular among the vulnerable lower-classes outside the protective city walls who relied on luck (and the defensive walls of the Tymoran temple) to protect them from jungle monsters.
Eventually, animosity arose against foreign missionaries, who were seen as exploiting the local populace. Thus, by the late 15 century DR, the citys priests were largely local Chultans even though their gods were foreign.
The city was designed with defense as a priority due to the many pirates in the waters of the Shining Sea. It was protected by a high stone wall that encompassed the inner wards of the city, while the slums remained outside and relatively undefended. Meanwhile, additional walls within the city created added security for important or wealthy areas. The walls themselves were massive edifices of fitted stone adorned with colorful geometric patterns and images of beasts and heroes. In cases of an attack from the sea, warning bells within the fort were sounded and a red beacon was lit atop the harbors lighthouse.
As of the late 15 century DR, city had no standing army and the merchant princes made no effort to send mercenaries into the jungle to reduce the threats it posed. As such, the residents of the districts outside the walls organized their own volunteer "Citizens Brigade" to defend themselves. In cases of an attack, warning horns were used to tell people outside the walls to flee through the gates to safety.
Because of the hot and humid climate, Port Nyanzarus defenders rarely wore heavy armor, and preferred leather or dinosaur hide shields and armor. However, there was growing interest in metal armor by the late 15 century DR, particularly in equipment made from lightweight titansteel.
Thanks to the many rain traps located atop the buildings, it was easy to put out fires within the city.
A lost civilization once occupied the site that would become Port Nyanzaru, and left behind the great ziggurats of the Old City the Harbor Ward, and Tiryki Anchorage. Their ruins were often filled with traps and marked by carvings of wavy or circular patterns, perhaps even having them embalmed and placed in sarcophagi in tombs within or beneath the ziggurats.
At some point, a temple to Umberlee was established in caves beneath the Harbor Ward, however this came to be abandoned.
By the mid&ndash14 century DR, Port Nyanzaru had become the most important trade hub in all of Chult, and maintained this distinction even after Mezro ended its isolation in the . While unconfirmed, it was thought that Port Nyanzarus harbormaster during this time paid a monthly tribute to a powerful dragon turtle in exchange for keeping all other sea monsters from harming the port and hindering trade.
Under Amnian rule beginning in the late 14 century DR, Port Nyanzaru existed for the purpose of extracting resources for its foreign overlords, and people not affiliated with their trading companies were discriminated against and left exposed to the dangers and diseases of the jungle.
One night during the 15 century DR, the Pyramid of the Moon manifested within sight of Port Nyanzarus walls. By morning, it had vanished along with over 200 people from the city, none of whom were ever seen again.
Amn withdrew from the city in the late 15 century DR. This was done under pressure from powerful merchants and after a realization that failure to surrender the city would mean a bloody conflict that would likely end with them losing control regardless.
In the late 1480s DR, vegepygmy outside of Port Nyanzaru was on the rise. The plant creatures threatened the port inhabitants safety. Port Nyanzarus government paid well to adventurers to venture out into the jungles and cull vegepygmies and their chieftains, slowing the creatures rapid territory expansion.
Nine years after the citys independence from Amn, the death curse struck Toril, leading to an influx of adventurers to Port Nyanzaru seeking the curses source. At this time, a plot by yuan-ti to smuggle an artifact known as the Dreamers Amulet into the city set of a frenzy of activity as the citys factions theorized that the item might be causing the death curse.

Port Nyanzaru was inhabited largely by humans of Chultan descent. A few tabaxi lived in the city, working as minstrels or guides out of Port Nyanzaru. Chultan shield dwarves lived in the port, including albino dwarves. Yuan-ti also spies resided in Port Nyanzaru, monitoring the merchant princes, treasure hunters, and adventurers.
