It was inhabited by the monarchy of the Ffolk.\nthumb|A map of the City of Callidyrr showing the 380x380px\nCaer Callidyrr was a city that stood in the shadows of the castle that shared the citys name – Caer Callidyrr. Its spires, had numerous paved roads, alleys, and stairways that webbed its four quarters surrounding the great open square – the Market Square, located below the towering castle.\nLike many other cities, Callidyrr had slums.\nThe citys harbor in Whitefish Bay was protected by the breakwater and a seawall created by the druids.\nUnderneath Caer Callidyrr laid a network of storm sewers that drained through the seawall\nThe City of Callidyrr had two major roads that crossed its quarters and stretched beyond. The Fairheight Road ran from the citys Market Square northwest along the fortresss side and reached the Fairheight Mountains. The High Kings Road was the second major road and an important highway of the isle of Alaron that ran south.\nJust like the entirety of the Kingdom of Callidyrr, the city of Caer Callidyrr was ruled by His Highness, High King Sovereign of Callidyrr and monarch of all the lands of the Ffolk. King Reginald Carrathal held the title circa the  and after the rebellion of the same year, the Crown of the Isles was claimed by Tristan Kendrick.\nthumb|A 14 century 380x380px\nThe Ffolk inhabitants of Caer Callidyrr were generally considered to be friendly and accustomed to the visitors from across the Sword Coast. The city was a bright and cheerful setting of busy markets, fabled weaponsmiths, and abundant entertainment of musicians, minstrels, and bards. The city streets were always hosting musicians performing their music for the citizens daily, making many guests mistakingly confuse an ordinary day for a festival. The music typically consisted of Ffolk bards, Waterdhavian minstrels, and pipe players of Calimshan. It was virtually impossible to avoid ever-present singing and music. Its many taverns were relatively quiet, pleasant, and clean, which was not typical for similar port cities.\nUnlike music, magic was somewhat rare in Caer Callidyrr.\nThe city was a busy, bustling hub of trade and barter. It was the biggest and the wealthiest city of the Moonshaes, with a small flotilla of fishing vessels entering and leaving the bay daily. The citys shipyards constructed sturdy seafaring vessels, and docks provided anchorage to many trade galleons and longships. Mechanical pulley-operated cranes were seen rising above the water, transporting catch to nearby canneries that dotted the shores.\nCaer Callidyrr had busy naval trade routes that connected it to several important trade hubs. The route to Waterdeep was a journey of about eight days, and the Ffolk merchant sold their fine steel, buying oil, spices, and cloth from the inhabitants of north Faerûn. The route to Calimport provided the Moonsaes with silks, fine fabrics, spices, parchment, and horses while supplying Calimport with steel and weapons. Within the Sea of Moonshae, Caer Callidyrr sold fine weapons to Corwell and bought ales, sheepand horses, and able-bodied workers, while Moray bought weapons and steel and sold ores and coal. Lastly, the isle of Mintarn bought lumber from Caer Callidyrr.\nCaer Callidyrr was known for producing and exporting thick Callidyrr mead. Valuable illicit trade goods found on the streets of Callidyrr after dark included Calishite ginyak weed as well as able-bodied slaves from Amn and Tethyr.\nThe city was protected by the Scarlet Guard, the mercenary company loyal to the High King. The Guard was split into four brigades, each overseeing its quarter of Caer Callidyrr. Each brigade, in turn, was split into individual companies, each of which had its own insignia that was flown in streaming pennants atop the Callidyrr castle. Their uniform consisted of bright red cloaks and helmets topped with tall red plumage. The first three brigades consisted of human veterans and mercenaries. The fourth brigade, however, possessed an awe and terror-inspiring reputation – the ogre brigade.\nThe Callidyrr dragoons were famed defenders of the realm and the capital city in the 15 century DR, founded by the High Queen Alicia Kendrick, when the Moonshaes were plagued by Amnian invaders, ravaging lycanthropes, and giants. Their ranks were filled from the acomplished members of the High Kings elite guard.
