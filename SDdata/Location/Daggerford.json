        "mainbody": "'''Daggerford''' was a small but consequential town located in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] within the greater [[Sword Coast]]. While it was primarily a farming community, and considered by some to be a mere stopover, the town had great ambitions to grow and be seen as an alternative to their northern neighbor of [[Waterdeep]]. \n\nDespite its modest size and somewhat inflated sense of importance, Daggerford was resilient. It was something of a relic from the old kingdom of [[Delimbiyr]], too stubborn to fall even when a series of wars, crusades, and other conflicts threatened the entirety of the Sword Coast. Daggerford's coat-of-arms was a ''[[silver]] [[dagger]]'', covered in blood atop a field of dark blue.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "It was a walled settlement with a population that by and large lived in the outlying hamlets, farms, and estates, rather than within the town proper. As such, the streets of Daggerford were not densely populated.\n\nSurrounding the town wall was a modest moat, with three crossing points at each of the town's three gates — the Farmer's Gate in the north, the Caravan Gate in the west, and the River Gate in the south.\n\nSitting atop a hill in the center of Daggerford was the grand [[Ducal Castle]], which was technically older than the town itself.",
        "Geography": "[[File:DelimbiyrVale.png|thumb|''Daggerford environs circa late 15{{th}} century DR.'']]\nThroughout its storied history, Daggerford's dukes claimed the lands from as far away as the [[Floshin Estates]] to the north and [[Dragonspear Castle]] in the south. In truth, the duchy comprised the town proper and the surrounding farmsteads which numbered around a score. It was the largest settlement located between the metropolises of Waterdeep, 150 miles (241.4 km) to the north, and [[Baldur's Gate]] to the south.{{DagLoc}} \n\nThere were a number of small but notable landmarks situated around Daggerford. The familial estate of [[Elorfindar Floshin|Sir Elorfindar Floshin]] was about two days away, and the home of his son [[Elorshin Floshin|Elorshin]] was approximately the same distance to the east. Near Elorshin's home was the temple known as the [[Mosque of Tyr]], which the younger [[gold elf|elf]] maintained. \n\nOn a small hill near the town was an entrance to a nearby ''[[song path]]'', a network of ''[[portal|portals]]'' that were connected to works of oratorical art, such as songs and epic poems. The ''song path'' near Daggerford was referred to as the ''Voices of the Lost'', named for the [[Voices of the Lost|song]] that was required for its opening.\n\n[[Gillian's Hill]], [[Liam's Hold]], and [[Black Helm Tower]] were each within a day's travel of Daggerford.",
        "Government": {
            "Dukes of Daggerford": "The first Duke of Daggerford was [[Rugyar]] the Just.\n\n''Circa'' [[1270 DR]], the still young [[Edwin Daggerford]] was the Duke of Daggerford, until his death defending the city from the [[Baatezu]] [[Gorgomorz]]. His young son [[Conan Daggerford]] inherited the title.\n\nIn the mid–14{{th}} century, the town was ruled by [[Pryden Daggerford|Duke Pryden Daggerford]]. Unfortunately, the duke lost his life in the [[First Dragonspear War]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Pwyll Daggerford|Pwyll \"Greatshout\" Daggerford]], so named for his magically booming voice.\n\nAfter Duke Pwyll's presumed death in [[1372 DR]], the city's leadership was taken over by a wealthy merchant member of the city council, [[Matagar Bugo]]. That brief change of power was a part of a [[Zhentarim]] plot to take over Daggerford. Matagar's reign ended when he was incinerated by the invading [[Gorgomorz]]. After the Zhentarim plot was thwarted and the city defended itself, Duke Pwyll, revealed to still be alive, and held hostage by the enemies of the city, returned to the throne.\n\nDuke [[Maldwyn Daggerford]] received his title before the {{YearlinkName|1485}} as the tradition of primogeniture decreed that the title be passed to the eldest male child. It was the opinion of many in the town, however, that his elder sister, [[Morwen Daggerford|Lady Morwen]] would be more suited to the role. \n\nAfter the practice of primogeniture was suspended the [[1486 DR|following year]], Lady Morwen assumed the title of Duchess of Daggerford."

            "Guilds": "After the establishment of guilds, each type of guild was maintained by a Guildmaster, even if it was only a single town representative, to ease trade between cities. They eventually formed into the Council of Guilds during the early 14{{th}} century, and many of them amalgamated into a fewer number of guilds by the 15{{th}} century.\n\nThe [[Mariners' Alliance]] served the town's many sailors, boatmen and other seafarers. In [[1372 DR]] they were involved in weapon smuggling with the Zhentarim.."
        },
        "Defenses": "In addition to the Duke and his personal guard, Daggerford maintained a [[Daggerford militia|standing militia]]. It comprised the town's citizens who were healthy enough to serve, regardless of gender or race. Those who were not required to serve included those who were too young or too old, women who were pregnant, and women who were raising young children. As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the militia comprised only 50 individuals – which was one-tenth of the town's citizens.{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report}}\n\nNewly–recruited militiamen were granted some training and given very rudimentary arms. Service was required three days out of every month and typically consisted of fairly light duties, unless the town was in immediate peril.",
        "History": {
            "Founding": "In [[133 DR]], on the precise spot of future Daggerford, the outlaw [[Artor Morlin]] built [[Morlin Castle]] and founded the Barony of [[Steeping Falls]]. The kingdom of [[Elembar]] was founded in the area in [[146 DR]] by folk from nearby [[Tavaray]], building the capital city of [[Delimbiyran (city)|Delimbiyran]] north of the river. Over the following centuries, power was concentrated there as Tavaray was abandoned in [[302 DR]] and [[Athalantar]] was destroyed by [[orc]]s in [[342 DR]], and the native [[Illuskan]]s were largely supplanted by north-migrating [[Tethyrian]]s. Steeping Falls was abandoned by [[403 DR]] due to the horrors emanating from Castle Morlin, and Elembar itself fell to an orc horde in [[511 DR]], though the capital survived and the kingdom was reformed under King [[Javilarhh Snowsword]] as [[Delimbiyran]].\n\nDelimbiyran joined [[Phalorm]] in [[523 DR]] alongside [[Ardeep]] and [[Dardath]], forming a united and strong realm in the North. Unfortunately, the realm suffered terrible wars and disasters over the next century and dissolved in [[615 DR]], leaving Delimbiyran as the sole power in the region It was during this age that the area around what would be Daggerford became a duchy and grew significantly in power and influence. Though a vigorous and strong kingdom, Delimbiyran also proved short lived, collapsing into civil war in [[697 DR]] and breaking into numerous competing realms. [[Calandor]] held the lands around the capital city and the ruins of Morlin Castle, and managed to survive the centuries despite the capital city being destroyed by a magical disaster originating from [[Myth Drannor]] in [[714 DR]].\n\nThe town took its name from a 10{{th}} century legend about a boy named Tyndal who protected his family and their trade wagon while crossing the Delimbiyr River. Tyndal's family was assaulted by [[lizardfolk]] raiders, and he slew six of the beasts armed with only a [[dagger]]. While the story grew into myth over the course of the next few hundreds of years, records stated that fabled event did actually occur, at the site of the future Ducal Castle, in the {{YearlinkName|931}}. All of the subsequent Dukes of Daggerford claimed to be descended from Tyndal. \n\nHaving earned fame in his youth and wealth as a merchant, Tyndal married [[Eleesa]], the daughter of the Duke of [[Calandor]] in the {{YearlinkName|945}}. Some [[947 DR|two years later]], the [[white dragon]] [[Cortulorrulagalargath]] came crashing to [[Toril]] after an aerial fight with the [[silver dragon]] [[Teskulladar]], and demolished the city of [[Delimbiyran (city)|Delimbiyran]], killing the Duke but sparing his daughter and his son-in-law Tyndal. The newly-risen Duke Tyndal relocated the seat of power from Delimbiyran and began construction of his Ducal Castle atop the remnants of [[Morlin Castle]]. Over the course of the next hundred years, the people of Daggerford began to build a proper town outside of the new castle.\n\nDuring the mid–13{{th}} century, [[Derval Ironeater]] and the rest of [[Clan Ironeater]] moved into town and began rebuilding many of its wooden structures out of stone.",
            "14{{th}} Century": "[[File:Coalition.png|thumb|right|250px|The flag of Daggerford (right) with those of [[Waterdeep]] and the [[Flaming Fist]]]]\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1270}}, the [[Baatezu]] named [[Gorgomorz]] became the infamous \"Daggerford's Devil\", slaughtering countless innocents and aiming at Daggerford's destruction. Gorgomorz was banished by the young Duke [[Edwin Daggerford]]'s trap but he was gravely injured in battle and shortly passed.\n\nThe town of Daggerford was given sovereignty in the {{YearlinkName|1320}} by [[Conan Daggerford|Duke Conan Daggerford]]. He allowed for the formation of the [[Council of Guilds]], the ruling body that has governed the town ever since.\n\nDaggerford was the site of a [[Battle of Daggerford|great battle]], when it was assaulted by the [[Hordes of Dragonspear (army)|hordes of fiends]] that poured out from [[Dragonspear Castle]] in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}. The town was defended and its assailants defeated by combined forces of elves, dwarves, and men. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Daggerford's army lent 50 of their soldiers, one-tenth of the town's population, to the [[Coalition|Coalition army]]. They fought under the command of [[Haither Stonehand|General Haither Stonehand]] who knew each of her soldiers personally.\n\nAlso around that time, [[lizardfolk]] under the command of a lich named [[Redeye]] began extorting [[Pwyll Daggerford|Duke Pwyll]] the sum of tens of thousands of [[gold piece]]s. The duke in turn hired several adventuring companies to remove the threat to the duchy.\n\nSometime in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a group of [[troll]]s began to infest Daggerford's sewer system.\n\n[[Derval Ironeater]] claimed the city of Daggerford had no skilled [[tattoo]]ists within its walls as around this time in its history.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Duke Pwyll Daggerford seeming perished during a hunt, gored by a wild beast. Daggerford mourned the death of the city's leader even though many found his death's circumstances highly suspicious. Shortly after, a wealthy merchant and a member of the city council [[Matagar Bugo]] proclaimed himself the new Duke. His great mercantile aspirations of turning Daggerford into a trading juggernaut to rival [[Waterdeep]] encountered unfortunate circumstances of bandits ambushing trade caravans in the middle of the day, secretly Zhentarim agents, [[orc]] forces supplied with weapon shipments that passed through Daggerford. The city militia's investigation bore no success. \n\nEventually, [[Astriel Shalyn]], an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]], a traveling adventurer, and their companions [[Purfbin Doogrick]] and [[Raegen Brunegar]] involved themselves to untangle the schemes and plots surrounding these events. Their investigation uncovered the Zhentarim forces entering a dark alliance with the infamous baatezu [[Gorgomorz]] and the [[tanarukk]] of [[Dragonspear Castle]]. The Zhentarim planted the puppet ruler Bugo to take over Daggerford, while Gorgomorz sought to destroy the town. \n\nZhentarim planned on betraying Gorgomorz. Once the devil's orcs invaded Daggerford, Zhentarim would lead Matagar's griffon mercenaries to defeat the invaders, imprison Gorgomorz inside a magical orb, and leave Matagar Bugo as a puppet ruler with the full support of the citizens and the Lords' Alliance.\n\nAstriel's adventurers tracked the Duke and [[Bronwyn Daggerford|his sister Bronwyn]] to [[Illefarn]], where they being kept under guard by the [[Griffons Mercenary Company]]. Pwyll and Bronwyn Daggerford were freed, and Astriel with her adventurers took a stand against Gorgomorz. In the end, they slew the devil, and returned Duke Pwyll back to the throne of Daggerford.",
            "15{{th}} Century": "At some point prior to the [[Second Sundering]], the duchy of Daggerford entered into the [[Lords' Alliance]].\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke Maldwyn]] became involved with a woman named [[Natyssa]]. She was in fact a [[succubus]] called [[Pencheska]] working for [[Tarul Var]] of [[Thay]], both of whom sought the duke's death. The duke himself became possessed by the spirit of [[Baazka]], the [[pit fiend]] who orchestrated the [[Second Dragonspear War]] a century before. \n\nThe succubus and the spirit of the pit fiend attempted to murder Duke Maldwyn and incriminate a group of adventurers. While it was unknown how the conflict between the groups actually played out, Pencheska was able to imprison the duke's sister Lady Morwen in [[Cromm's Hold]], assume her likeness, and succeed her \"brother\" as Daggerford's new duchess. By the time the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] was broken, when the region was being assaulted by [[giant]]s, she had brokered an agreement with the [[Zhentarim]] to ensure the \"safety\" of her people.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, \"Lady Morwen\" was still serving as the town's duchess. It was unknown if the individual was the real duchess or still the succubus Pencheska posing as her. Around this time, the \"duchess\" sent a recently formed adventurers group to search for [[Christos Tellum]], the noble heir to [[Tellum's Hold]]. The nobleman and his party went missing in the [[Dessarin Valley]] after some recent forest fires. The young nobleman was soon delivered to the \"duchess\" along with the mysterious ''magical flask'' he had set out to recover. \n\nAfter the ''flask'' was brought into the town, Daggerford was briefly plagued by a [[vampire]], [[Dar Lavien]] who unleashed the undead on the population. Dar Lavien was slain by the same adventuring group sent to recover Tellum. \n\nThe \"duchess\" used the adventurers to recover the ''[[Ambergul Blade]]'' under the pretense that its magic was needed to restore Christos Tellum's health. The blade wound up in the hands of the [[rakshasa]] [[Nadir]], who utilized a [[slaad]]i portal to once again throw Daggerford into chaos. In the ensuing mayhem, the ''Ambergul Blade'' was used to uncork the mysterious ''magical flask'', releasing an ancient [[red dragon]] called [[Karrnsyrrl]]. The dragon caused significant damage to Daggerford but departed shortly thereafter, along with Nadir and the young Christos."
