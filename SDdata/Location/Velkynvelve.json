        "mainbody": "Velkynvelve (\"unseen knife\" in the Drow language) was a small drow outpost of the city of Menzoberranzan in the late 15 century DR. It was specifically used to collect slaves captured in various raids before taking them to the city as workers or sacrifices to Lolth.\nThe commander of the outpost was Ilvara Mizzrym of House Mizzrym and her senior officials were Shoor Vandree and Asha Vandree of House Vandree and Jorlan Duskryn of House Duskryn.\nCirca 1486 DR, there was a great escape of prisoners. Some months later, the command was given to the wizard Servan Llarabbar."
