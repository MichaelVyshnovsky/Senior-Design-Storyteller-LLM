The village of Elbulder was to the south of the forest.\nThe forest was once home to the green elf realm of Nikerymath. It contains the hidden city of Rucien-Xan.\nthumb|A satyr of Satyrwood keeping an eye on humans.\nThe Chondalwood was the home of wild elves.\nAs of 1368 DR, troops of satyrs patrolled the Old Road, scaring travelers into making haste out of the forest or to go around it, and the forest was also inhabited by voadkyn (wood giants) and centaurs. As of 1372 DR, savage druids lived in the forest and posed a threat to anyone approaching them. Clans of ghostwise halfling roamed about the forest, never staying in one spot for too long. Various plant creatures such as shambling mounds and tendriculos also lived here. All of these intelligent races had one goal in mind to prevent human encroachment.\nThe Eldreth Veluuthra were active in this forest, and as of 1374 DR, generally received support from the forests inhabitants such as the centaurs, ghostwise halflings and satyrs. The wild elves in the forest provided the organizations agents with shelter. Talindra Amalith of the VelNikeryma (the Eldreth Veluuthras guiding council) sought out new wild elf recruits in this area.\nTotoruan of the Chondalwood, a member of the People of the Black Blood, lived here around 1372 DR.\nFor many years, the people of the Vilhon Reach wondered over the existence of an elven realm called Rucien-Xan within the forest."
