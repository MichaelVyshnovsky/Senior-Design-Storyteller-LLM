        "mainbody": "'''Cortryn''' was a militaristic duchy of the post-[[Shoon Imperium]] period that sought to attain imperial glory between the 5{{th}}–8{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "Cortryn controlled a wide area of land east of [[Lake Esmel]], ranging from the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]] in the north to the [[Tejarn Hills]] in the south. [[Eshpurta]] was its northernmost city.",
        "History": "The northern frontier of [[Calimshan]] was long known as the [[Ralamnish Ridings]], as part of the greater [[Calishar Emirates]]. As the [[Emirate of Amin]] developed on the western coast, the interior region was left mostly unsettled. The kingdom of Valashar was founded in [[361 DR]]{{Valashar dates}} by Lord [[Ashar Tornamn]] of [[Tethyr]], who attempted an ambitious campaign of conquest and colonization. This  resulted in the disastrous war with [[Cormyr]] in [[376 DR]], his own execution, and the abandonment of the realm.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Shoon Imperium in [[450 DR]], Cortryn was founded on the former lands of Valashar in the {{YearlinkName|491}}, resettled by people from Tethyr and Calimshan led by the noble [[Kadar el Aktorral]]. Kadar claimed an obscure imperial title that gave him the right to the land, and marched with an army of hired mercenaries. The new duchy took control of a wide swathe of land stretching from the Troll Mountains to the Tejarn Hills, including the brutal conquest of the [[halfling]] realm of [[Meiritin]].\n\nThe expansionist realm came into conflict with [[Amn]] in [[520 DR]], and King [[Imnel Torlath I]] died in battle with the forces of Cortryn.\n\nAfter decades of abuse and enslavement by the domineering rulership of Cortryn, [[Bellabar Huntinghorn]] of Meiritin led an exodus of halflings away in the {{YearlinkName|514}}. They traveled far to the north and settled around [[Secomber]] with their kin, then joined with the realm of [[Phalorm]]. The remaining halflings of Meiritin mostly abandoned the province in [[523 DR]], leaving it empty.\n\nAt some point, the ruling lord [[Bevedaur]] went on a [[serpent]] hunt in the swamps at the mouth of the [[Winding Water]], the future site of [[Lathtarl's Lantern]]. His party was attacked by an army of [[lizardfolk]] and the whole company wiped out.\n\nCortryn was overtaken in [[731 DR]] by the [[Ring of Eyes]], a cabal of five [[beholder]]s and their minions. The ruling family of Cortryn was destroyed and lands conquered, and the beholders waged an ongoing war against the [[elf|elves]] of [[Shilmista]] and King [[Strohm III]] of Tethyr. This lasted until the {{YearlinkName|757}} when the [[mage]] [[Tashara of the Seven Skulls]] slew the beholders and shattered their domain.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|69}}\n\nThe former realm was finally absorbed by Amn in the {{YearlinkName|760}}, with Eshpurta going on to become Amn's eastern capital and major military base.\n\nA conspiracy to recreate Cortryn emerged in [[1370 DR]], organized by the [[Knights of the Shield]]. They sought to restore the old monarchy of Amn via the installation of [[Pehllus Tanislove]], and return Meiritin and Cortryn as independent realms once more. Under this scheme, the rebellious city of [[Riatavin]] would become the seat of the duchy with [[Mundal Krimmevol]] as leader."
