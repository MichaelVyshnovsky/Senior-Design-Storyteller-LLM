'''Haelhollow''' was a location along the [[Trade Way]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Geography==
The Trade Way crossed Haelhollow, leaving one of its sides across the road from the other. The [[Blackrocks]] around Haelhollow were a rocky area, and Haelhollow in particular boasted a number of stone formations akin to ramparts around it.

==History==
Haelhollow was an expected camp spot for large caravans according to [[Thoadrin]] ''circa'' {{yearlink|1357}}.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|188|12}} Late that year, the mage [[Aumlar Chaunthoun]] unleashed a spell over Haelhollow in an effort to damage [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan in order to better capture [[Shandril Shessair]]; it took [[Korthauvar Hammantle]]'s intervention to prevent the spell from actually killing her.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|224-225|14}}
