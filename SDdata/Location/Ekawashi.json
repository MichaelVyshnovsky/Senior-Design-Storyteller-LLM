        "Description": "Ekawashi Village was a tranquil peasant community comprising ninety-three buildings that was controlled by the [[Niwa clan]]. Despite being the largest settlement in the [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']], it maintained a low-key character.\n\nThe unassuming nature of the village was partly due to the decision of the shoen's [[jito]] to establish his base in [[Kuda]], a nearby location, rather than in Ekawashi itself. This choice by the jito resulted in minimal disturbance to the daily lives of the villagers by powerful [[samurai]] lords.\n\nThe absence of high-ranking samurai and the relative peace it brought inadvertently made Ekawashi an attractive haven for a particular type of visitor. Disreputable travelers and noblemen seeking anonymity found the village appealing thanks to its low profile and the reduced likelihood of encountering trouble. This characteristic made Ekawashi a discreet and favored stopover for those who wished to travel incognito or avoid the scrutiny often found in more prominent or heavily patrolled areas."
