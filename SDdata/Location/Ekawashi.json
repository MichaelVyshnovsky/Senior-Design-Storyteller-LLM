        "mainbody": "Ekawashi was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura.\nEkawashi Village was a tranquil peasant community comprising ninety-three buildings that was controlled by the Niwa clan. Despite being the largest settlement in the shoen, it maintained a low-key character.\nThe unassuming nature of the village was partly due to the decision of the shoens jito to establish his base in Kuda, a nearby location, rather than in Ekawashi itself. This choice by the jito resulted in minimal disturbance to the daily lives of the villagers by powerful samurai lords.\nThe absence of high-ranking samurai and the relative peace it brought inadvertently made Ekawashi an attractive haven for a particular type of visitor. Disreputable travelers and noblemen seeking anonymity found the village appealing thanks to its low profile and the reduced likelihood of encountering trouble. This characteristic made Ekawashi a discreet and favored stopover for those who wished to travel incognito or avoid the scrutiny often found in more prominent or heavily patrolled areas."
