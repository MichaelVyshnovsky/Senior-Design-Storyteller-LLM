        "Description": "Its piers were wetted by the river [[Delimbiyr]]. Elven Port was long one of the most accessible ruins of old [[Earlann]] and it was visited by several groups of adventurers. For many years, the ruins of Elven Port had provided cover to marauders and a few predators. However, by [[1366 DR]], the old tower of the town's lord was occupied by a powerful group of [[daemonfey]], led by [[Vaerilmor Floshin]]. Vaerilmor and his followers were luring elven adventurers to corrupt them with their foul [[magic]].",
        "History": "Between [[1366 DR]] and [[1372 DR]], all the adventurers who came across this place disappeared without leaving any traces."
