'''Wanderfen''' was a small village in the [[Mere of Dead Men]], just south of [[West Harbor]] that ended its existence in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Wanderfen had little history of note. The village was taken back by the Mere sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. One of the village's refugees was a [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] named [[Goodwife Aruna]] who resettled in the nearby hamlet of West Harbor. The hamlet lost most of its scant inhabitants to the creatures unleashed by the [[King of Shadows]], while other were dragged away by the wandering [[undead]] of the swamp.
