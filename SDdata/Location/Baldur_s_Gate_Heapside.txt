'''Heapside''' was a large district in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] that included the portion of the city northeast of [[Gray Harbor]]. It was bordered by the Old Wall of the city to the north, [[the Steeps]] to the west and [[Eastway (Baldur's Gate)|Eastway]] to the south.

==History==
The name ''Heapside'' originally referred to the entirety of what came to be known as the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. This changed following the events of the [[Tax Revolts]], when the terms "Upper City" and "Lower City" came into use and replaced "Old Town" and "Heapside".

==Notable Locations==
;Businesses:
* [[Baldur's Mouth]]: Housed in a narrow five-story building with the words "Baldur's Mouth" printed vertically down the front,<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Day of the Devil|15}} this news carrier disseminated the news of the day by means of town criers and [[broadsheet]]s that were printed by [[mechanical scribe]]s.
* [[Candulhallow's Funeral Arrangements]]: A family-business that both aided in the care of deceased Baldurians and occasionally sold corpses
* [[Sorcerous Sundries]]: One of the most visually-stunning buildings in the city, this shop specialized in [[magic]]al [[Material component|components]], along with other services provided by its proprietor.

;Taverns and restaurants:
* [[Blushing Mermaid]]: This tavern was infamous across the [[Sword Coast]] as a gathering place where the lowliest of dregs could conduct their shady dealings.
* [[Splurging Sturgeon]]: Formerly a struggling tavern, the Sturgeon was reformed as a seafood restaurant that offered a wide-range of tasty dishes featuring nearly anything that was fished from local waters.

;Temples:
* [[Shrine of the Suffering]]: The Baldurian shrine to [[Ilmater]] was small and rather unremarkable, however its attendants catered to the most destitute of the Gate's residents.
