        "mainbody": "'''Gheldaneth''' was the second largest city in the nation of [[Mulhorand]], as well as one of its sixteen preceptual governments. It would later come to be the only city in Mulhorand to survive the [[Spellplague]] after [[1385 DR]].",
        "Geography": "[[File:Mulhorand1357DR.jpg|thumb|273px|''Gheldaneth on a larger map of Mulhorand, dated to around [[1357 DR]].'']]\nThis city was situated in the [[Menesankh]] region of Mulhorand, the southern coast of the [[Alamber Sea]], where the mouth of the [[River of Spears]] emptied.",
        "Description": "Gheldaneth was largely made up of urban sprawl and hosted a large port facility.",
        "Government": "Gheldaneth had a preceptual government, which ruled over both the city and the area at the mouth of the River of Spears. Its rulers in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], as recommended to the vizier by the Thothian priesthood, were the Precept [[Derlaunt]] and the Divine Precept [[Tholaunt]]. The latter was an [[incarnation]] of [[Thoth]] and had the authority to overrule Derlaunt.\n\nSeeing as Thoth was a god of knowledge, it was compulsory in Gheldaneth for all citizens to attend the city's university, even slaves.",
        "Trade": "The city imported various foods from the [[Great Vale]], which arrived either by land or sea, as well as miscellaneous good from [[Unthalass]] that came through its port facility. Gheldaneth was also notably the primary source of [[magic item]]s in Mulhorand.",
        "History": "Following the Spellplague, the city's population was greatly reduced. By [[1479 DR]], it had sworn fealty to [[High Imaskar]] and the Imaskarians stationed troops in the city to ensure its loyalty.",
        "Inhabitants": "The city was home to many ethnic Mulhorandi who carried on many of their traditions. The city also housed many [[tiefling]]s, descendants of slaves who made pacts with dark forces.",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Arcanum of Magic]], a university and temple dedicated to Thoth. as well as the largest building in all of the city, with its towering lining the northern wall. There the city's inhabitants learned how to count, read, write, and answer simple questions about both the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] and Mulhorand's history.\n* A [[Wizard College (Gheldaneth)|wizard's college]] that was adjacent to the Arcanum of Magic. It was the only place in Mulhorand besides [[Skuld]] where one could study [[wizard]]ry.\n* The temple of [[Horus-Re]]: a ruined temple buried deep under the city.\n* A temple dedicated to [[Isis]].\n* A temple dedicated to [[Nephthys]]."
