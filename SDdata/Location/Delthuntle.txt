Delthuntle was a commercial center and port in Aglarond. 
The city primarily made a profit through trade with the genasi nation of Akanûl, especially its capital, Airpur.
Some of Delthuntles specialties include oysters and pink pearls, as supplied by Morada Topolino.
The city suffered from some difficulty with pirates that patrol the coastline.
The citys trade with Akanûl helped give it one of the highest non-native genasi populations throughout Faerûn.
There was a large halfling community in Delthuntle that was not seen as second class.
