The '''Druarwood''' was a forest west of [[Cold Wood]] and northeast of the [[Moonwood]] in the [[Silver Marches]].

==Description ==
The forest was sparse and narrow, full of pine, spruce firs and conifers. As the hills approached the mountains, the forest gave way to the scrub and heaths that were arid and cold, in which there were looming glaciers and peaks.

Druarwood had a bad reputation as a place always being raided by [[orcs]], [[giants]], and other dangerous creatures. That fame was wholly deserved. [[Frost giant]]s and [[hill giant]]s descended into the forest looking for wild game, timber, and forage. Druarwood was also known for [[rothé]], [[dire bear]]s, and [[dire wolverine]]s; these latter creatures were so evil that even giants kept away from them.
