The '''Loyal Maid's Hall''' was a room in [[Castle Obarskyr]].

==Interior==
The hall was well lit.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1479}}, there were always two [[Purple Dragons]] stationed in the Loyal Maid's Hall. In the aftermath of the massacre during the [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the [[War Wizard]] [[Surgol Velard]] called upon those two soldiers to help him move the mask dancer [[Amarune Whitewave]], whom he had incapacitated with a ''[[wand of sleep]]'', believing her too suspicious. Those soldiers returned to their post just in time to miss [[Storm Silverhand]] and [[Mirt]].
