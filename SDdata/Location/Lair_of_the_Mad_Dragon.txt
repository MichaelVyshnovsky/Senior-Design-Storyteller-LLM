The '''Lair of the Mad Dragon''' was the name given to the network of caverns located beneath the [[Sanatorium]] of [[Helm's Hold]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. They served as the lair of the mad [[green dragon]] [[Chartilifax]], protector of the ''[[Hex Locus]]'' and servant of the Prophet [[Rohini]].

==Description==
The walls and floors of the caves were unnatural in appearance, as if they were formed from stone that had been recently mined. Much of the dragon's lair resembled a swamp, with streams of blood-colored saltwater than flowed up the rocky walls and warped plant life that was alien to underground terrain.

The cave walls were illuminated by luminescent rock formations,

==Geography==
Chartilifax's lair was located beneath the [[Sanatorium]] of the [[Cathedral of Helm]] in [[Helm's Hold]].It could be accessed by the lower dungeons that lay beneath the cathedral's underground crypts.

===Flora & Fauna===
Warped trees grew within the Lair of the Mad Dragon, forming at angles that were not typically found among natural plant life. 

==History==
During the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]], just following the downfall of the Prophet [[Rohini]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] ventured into the catacombs beneath the Cathedral of Helm into the Lair of the Mad Dragon. They massacred the scattered [[Ashmadai]] cultists that lingered within, and put an end to Chartilifax's madness and slew him as well.

==Inhabitants==
The [[plaguechanged]] Chartilifax roamed his caverns in his [[humanoid]] form, taking on the appearance of a green [[elf]]. While he would cautiously observe anyone while under this guise, it was only a matter of time before he transformed into his true draconic form and demonstrate how his caverns were ideal hunting grounds for a green dragon.

There was at least one [[mimic]] that dwelled within a rocky alcove hidden behind a collapsible cavern wall.
