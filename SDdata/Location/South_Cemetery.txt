The '''South Cemetery''' was a graveyard located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The cemetery was located in south Zhentil Keep in the far eastern section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]]. 

==Description==
A stone wall that stood {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall separated the cemetery from the rest of the city. A spiked black [[iron]] fence added another {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} to the wall's height. A set of large doors, also made from black iron, formed the main entry to the cemetery. Carvings of winged monsters, death's heads, an hourglass, and a setting sun adorned the doors.

The South Cemetery's close proximity to the [[River Tesh]] made the ground surprisingly spongy. The easternmost guard tower in the city's defensive wall bordered the South Cemetery. The [[Zhentilar]] stationed there seemed to be somewhat leery of any [[undead]] within the cemetery since they sealed all of the arrow slits and murder holes facing the cemetery.

==Inhabitants==
Undead could be discovered roaming the South Cemetery at certain times. These included [[wight]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[shadow]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[ghoul]]s, and [[spectre]]s.

==Defenses==
A glyph atop the main gate sealed the cemetery from any kind of undead entering or leaving. However, though the glyph did function at one time, it was no longer set properly as of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.

==History==
The South Cemetery was named when there were more cemeteries found in the city, all of which were found in the main part of Zhentil Keep located on the north bank of the River Tesh. This was the only cemetery that existed in the city following its destruction in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

It was originally "consecrated" to [[Bane]], and later turned to unholy ground since the [[god]]'s death. There was a chance that anyone buried here would rise as some kind of undead creature.
