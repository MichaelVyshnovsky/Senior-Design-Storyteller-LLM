Eburishima was an island located in the Tenmei Province of Kozakura.
Eburishima was inhabited solely by fishermen. The fishermen of Eburishima were also smugglers, working mostly with the yakuza and on occasion wako from Shinkoku. They primarily smuggled silk and spices out of the island of Tenmei so they could avoid paying tariffs.
