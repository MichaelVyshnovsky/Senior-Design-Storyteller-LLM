The  statue featured the likeness of the tortle Gumdarr, blowing into a large stone sounding horn.
Gumdars statue was built atop a sand-covered beach, dotted with enormous black rocks that were covered in moss.
Nearly a century before the time of the Second Sundering, the Bitch Queen crashed near the statue of High Horn. Over the course of the following decades, several other vessels crashed or otherwise washed ashore at the beach beneath High Horn, including the Dawn Avenger and the Carcerius, among others.
A two-headed plesiosaurus roamed in the waters near High Horn.
