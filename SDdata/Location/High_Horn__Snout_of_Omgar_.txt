'''High Horn''' was an enormous statue of a revered [[tortle]] that was built atop the isle known as the [[Snout of Omgar]] in [[Chult]].

==Description==
The {{SIAdj|30|ft|adj=tall}} statue featured the likeness of the tortle [[Gumdarr]], blowing into a large stone sounding horn.

==Geography==
===Geographical Features===
Gumdar's statue was built atop a sand-covered beach, dotted with enormous black rocks that were covered in [[moss]].

==History==
Nearly a century before the time of the [[Second Sundering]], the ''[[Bitch Queen (ship)|Bitch Queen]]'' crashed near the statue of High Horn. Over the course of the following decades, several other vessels crashed or otherwise washed ashore at the beach beneath High Horn, including the ''[[Dawn Avenger]]'' and the ''[[Carcerius]]'', among others.

==Inhabitants==
A two-headed [[plesiosaurus]] roamed in the waters near High Horn.
