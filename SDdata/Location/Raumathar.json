        "mainbody": "'''Raumathar''' was a great eastern empire that spanned the [[Northeast Faer没n|northeast]] and [[East Faer没n|east]]ern regions of [[Faerun]] over the span of ~800 years. It included the lands that eventually became the nations of [[Rashemen]] and [[Thay]]. \n\nThe [[Raumviran]] people were known to be powerful [[Raumathari battlemage|battle-wizards]], capable of wielding both sword and magic against the [[demon]]ic forces of [[Narfell]] they so-often fought. As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], their art of fighting was still known by a select few people.",

            "Settlements": "*[[Almorel]]: This major trading city would remain a noted settlement in the [[Hordelands]] for over a thousand years after the fall of the empire.\n*[[Winterkeep]]: The capital city of the empire that served as home to the royal family."

        "History": {
            "Great Conflagration": "In {{Yearlink|-160}}, the last of these wars, which came to be known as the [[Great Conflagration (war)|Great Conflagration]], began with the summoning of the [[avatar]] of [[Kostchtchie]] and his [[frost giant]] armies from the [[Icerim Mountains]]. Although Raumathar pushed back the Nar assaults with [[elemental magic]], they eventually lost Winterkeep in the siege.\n\nIn response, the Raumviran tapped into long-lost [[Imaskari]] lore and elicited the aid of [[white dragon|white wyrm]]s, devastating the armies from Narfell and driving them from their lands. Commander [[Thulkarr]] pressed the attack and led the Raumviran armies, along with their [[magic]]al [[stone constructs]], through a series of [[portal]]s to outflank the Nar in [[Dun-Tharos]]. In response, the [[Nentyarch]] ordered the opening their own otherworldly passageways to the [[Abyss]] to drive out the [[golem]]s and, feeling vulnerable from the assault eventually used a dark ritual to summon the deity [[Eltab]] himself.\n\nA series of battles over the next two years would end with an isolated Raumvarin force left to desperate action; in {{Yearlink|-150}} they summoned an avatar of the [[deity]] [[Kossuth]], who left nothing but ash and smoke in his wake. The people of both Raumathar and Narfell were left devastated and scattered, their empires in ruins. The few surviving Raumvirans were then pushed westward by the [[Suren]] people.",
            "Legacy": "An isolated and esoteric group of Raumviran witches, those that would come to be known as the [[Witches of Rashemen]], first appeared around the year {{Yearlink|-108}}. They swore to preserve the lore and knowledge of the Raumathar empire for years to come."
