The Doors of Shajar were a pair of gargantuan stone statues named for Shajar that stood in the eastern mouth of east Zakharas Grey Jungle.
The Temple of the Serpentine Empress was located roughly  southwest from this landmark.
The Doors of Shajar were once the ends of a huge stone dam that was built to force the River Abdo into a nearby citys large resevoir. Over time the dam fell apart, leaving the statues the only remaining parts of it.
