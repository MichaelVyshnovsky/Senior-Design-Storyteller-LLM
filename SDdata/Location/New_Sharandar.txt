'''New Sharandar''' was a settlement of [[elves]] and [[high elf|eladrin]] that straddled two realms, one on [[Toril]] and the other in the [[Feywild]], on either side of an extra-planar ''[[portal]]''. It was the home to the descendants of the elven kingdom of [[Illefarn]], offering them protection from the malevolent forces of the [[dark fey]].

==Description==
On the continent of [[Faerûn]], New Sharandar took root in the remains of Sharandar, the  capital of the elven survivor state [[Iliyanbruen]] from which it drew its name. Although they lay in ruin, the magnificent buildings of Old Sharandar featured ornate architecture and decoration.

Within the Feywild, New Sharandar took the form of utilitarian wooden structures and outposts set within the boughs of the plane's massive trees.

On the side in the Neverwinter Wood, the ''[[Fey Crossing]]'' that connected the two instances of New Sharandar resembled a gaping hole in the center of a gigantic [[oak]] tree. While peering through the passageway only shows the other side of the tree, stepping through the hole leads directly into the courtyard of the New Sharandar in the Feywild.

==Geography==
Due its unique formation in both the Prime and Feywild, New Sharandar had two geographical location. In [[Faerûn]], it existed in the ruins of Old Sharandar, within the [[Neverwinter Wood]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. Within the Feywild, New Sharandar was located within a region of the Feywild beneath the fey temple called the [[Arcane Reservoir]].

==Government==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the bi-planar settlement was led by the [[fey knight]], [[Merrisara Winterwhite]].

==Defenses==
The outpost of New Sharandar was protected by several forward observation camps established by the Iliyanbruen elves. These posts allowed them to take note of incoming threats from further out into the Feywild.

==History==
Millenia before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the great elven kingdom of [[Illefarn]] stood as the home of the ''Tel-quessir'' in the North. It remained strong until the {{YearlinkName|-1100}}, when its last coronal called for a ''[[Retreat (Illefarn)|Retreat]]'' to [[Evermeet]], and it was divided into three smaller realms, [[Ardeep]], [[Rilithar]], and Iliyanbruen in the Neverwinter Wood. 

Iliyanbruen continued on for nearly 1300 years, until it too fell to ruin by the {{YearlinkName|177}}. Only a few scattered elven settlements remained within the forest, along with the ruins of [[Sharandar]], its capital city. Many of those who left Faerûn traveled to the Feywild to continue on the traditions of the Iliyanbruen elves and Eladrin.

When the [[Spellplague]] fractured the foundations of existence on Toril, in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the barriers between the planet in the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]] and the Feywild were weakened. Over time, the elven and eladrin descendants of Iliyanbruen uncovered a ''portal'' that connected the Neverwinter Wood to their ancestral home in the Feywild. They formed a new home for themselves, with fortifications on both sides of the ''portal'', called New Sharandar, in honor of the capital of their lost home.

After claiming their new home, many elves set out to restore the lost settlements of Iliyanbruen and repair the ruins of Old Sharandar. Not all of the fey were so committed to peaceful endeavors however. In the years leading up to the 1480s DR, the elves and eladrin launched a campaign against the dark fey that desecrated and took their region of the Feywild. 

Around the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]] threatened their home when he waged war upon New Sharandar, from his [[Malabog's Castle|castle]] in the [[Feydark]]. Led by Merrisara Winterwhite, the fey of New Sharandar responded with swift action of their own, sieging the giant-king's castle and slaying the malevolent monarch with the aid of the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] in Neverwinter.

Over the following decade, the three [[hag]]s of the [[Odious Court]] began to work against the fey of New Sharandar to claim the [[Arcane Reservoir]] for their own use. They manipulated the remnants of Malabog's army to serve their ends and each claimed a territory in  the Feywild that threatened New Sharandar's mere existence.

==Notable Locations==
;Portals
* ''[[Fey Crossing]]'', the passageway that linked the Feywild to Toril.
