        "mainbody": "Srelanat was an important trade town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra. It stood on the mouth of the Ranu River at the terminus of the Srelanat Road.\nThe town was home to the oldest and most productive emerald mines in southern Malatra. These mines were found on temple land, and thus they and the town were tightly controlled by the priesthood under Priest Kalivan circa 1357 DR.\nWith such riches, there was much crime and jinyan flourished here. The town was the center of a widespread gem smuggling network."
