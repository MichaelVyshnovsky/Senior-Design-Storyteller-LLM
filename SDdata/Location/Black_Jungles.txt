The '''Black Jungles''' were a heavily forested region of southern [[Tashalar]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The Black Jungles were bordered in the west by the [[Hazur Mountains]], in the east by the [[Lapal Sea]], and in the north by the [[Delphin Mountains]]. The jungles ran right up to the coast of the [[Great Sea]] in the south and a smaller arm of the jungles reach the coast of the [[Shining Sea]] in the north. The [[Tashan Gap]], though it was technically a pass between the two mountain ranges, was filled with an arm of the Black Jungles. Several rivers branching off from the Lapal Sea, including the [[River Amarast]] and [[River Lapar]], marked the end of the Black Jungles and beginning of the [[Mhair Jungles]].
