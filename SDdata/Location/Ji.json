South of Ji, roads led east and west to Tsetu and UChan Gompa. The road between Ji and UChan Gompa was safe and saw heavy traffic around .\nAbove the town of Ji stood Noko-Ji Peak, and its name meant \"the blow high over Ji\".\nWhen the soldiers of Shou Lung invaded and seized the whole of northern Tabot in , with the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, artisans in Ji fashioned the five crystalline warriors and a group of great dang-ki and wu jen animated them and gave them magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of Lokar Pass. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands. The crystalline warriors went into the mountains to await the day when Tabot again had need of them. The date of the battle would be considered holy and celebrated as Crystal Day."
