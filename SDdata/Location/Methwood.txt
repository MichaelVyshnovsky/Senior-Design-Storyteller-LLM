The '''Methwood''' was a dense forest located in the frontier between [[Chessenta]] and [[Unther]].

==Geography==
===Flora & Fauna===
The Methwood was a large and hot forest is filled with [[cypress]], [[date]] [[Palm|palms]], [[cedar]], [[juniper]], and [[mulberry]] trees, with lots of vine growth. The vegetation was thick, making travel difficult.

It was home to the common fauna of the [[Old Empires]] area, such as [[elephant]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[leopard]]s.

==Inhabitants==
Although the Methwood was the only significant forest in Unther, Untheran people avoided to chop down its trees because of the numerous monsters that inhabited the area.

The Methwood was inhabited mostly by [[chimera]]s and Untheran [[druid]]s, although the druids had either died or left the forest by the 13th century [[DR]]. By the late years of the 14th century, the wood was home for small tribes of [[elves]] and [[half-elves]]. 

In [[1374 DR]], a cell of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], led by [[Talindra Amalith]] of the [[Vel'Nikeryma]], operated in the forest.

In the late years of the 15th century, it was discovered that a tribe of [[fey]] also lived in the forest. Those fey were hostile against the inhabitants of [[Luthcheq]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|70, 75}}

==Legends==
It was rumored that an ancient city of the [[Turami]] who lived in this region before the foundation of Unther was lost in the forest. However, nobody had ever found the slightest hint about the location of this city.

==Notable inhabitants==
* [[Skuthosiin]], the green dragon, had one of his lairs in the Methwood.
