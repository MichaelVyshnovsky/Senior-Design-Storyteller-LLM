The '''Dragon's Spine''' was a mountain range located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
The Dragon's Spine were located on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. They rang along the length of the island. It was named after the legendary [[Li lung|earth dragon]] believed to slumber beneath the lands of Kozakura.

==History==
During the [[Age of Gods]], the [[Earth Dragon]], pleased with Shinkoku's beauty, chose to rest on the evolving land, giving rise to the imposing mountain chain known as the Dragon's Spine that stretched across the entire island. From time to time, earthquakes that shook the region were attributed to the Earth Dragon stirring in its slumber.
