        "mainbody": "'''Gildenglade''' was once the second-largest settlement within [[Turmish]], located in the forest area at the foot of the [[Aphrunn Mountains]], until its destruction in [[1423 DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/104/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Country Treasures|8}} It was a haven for non-[[human]] populations, home to many of the [[dwarves]], [[half-elves]], and [[elves]] of the nation.",
        "Geography": "Gildenglade was built at the base of the [[Aphrunn Mountains]], not far from the [[Lake of Drifting Stars]] to the north. The city was connected to [[Halondar]], or the Turmway, by two major roads that ran from Gildenglade north towards the trade route.{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|20}} A minor trail connected Gildenglade with the town of [[Merrydell]] to the west.",
        "Government": "The elves of the community served as rulers, their skill with preservation allowing them to handle negotiations with the [[Emerald Enclave]].{{Cite web/More of the Vilhon Reach}}",
        "Trade": "Its economy was based primarily upon woodcutting and mining. [[Elves]] and [[half-elves]] of the city were used as a woodcutting force as well as governors; however, they enjoyed the hard work and were not mistreated. Furthermore, elves were given the final say in what and when was cut down. Elves planted new trees and kept the woods to the east and west of the city protected to maintain the balance. This equilibrious existence kept Gildenglade from conflicts with the Emerald Enclave and local tree-dwellers and [[dryad]]s. This strategy also made the city the major exporter of wood and wood carvings in Turmish, allowing the country to avoid wide-scale logging in other places.\n\n[[Dwarves]] of Gildenglade mainly concentrated on mining the unusually pure veins of [[gold]] underneath the city. The city's [[gnome]] population, by the most part, lived in earthen mounds that served as homes and sometimes as small businesses, while some lived in above-ground buildings.",
        "Cuisine": "Gildenglade served humble but hearty foods such as thick [[lamb]] and vegetable [[stew]], generously seasoned with local [[herbs]]. The town had fresh [[bread]], served with meals, and as for dessert - various fruits and [[pie]]s were a common sight.",
        "Defenses": "Gildenglade's defenses consisted of the town militia of various ranks and levels of battle experience. Some were members of the city watch, while others were retired army veterans. They did not have uniformed armor nor weapons, giving them a certain makeshift rustic charm. Ranged troops were the town's many hunters, proficient with the [[bow]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a group of adventurers, by chance, stumbled into a lair of the [[kobold]] [[Scything Claw tribe]]. The lair was poorly defended at the time due to an ongoing raid into [[goblin]] territories. Adventurers defeated the guards and looted the kobolds' treasures. Unbeknownst to the adventurers, the town of Gildenglade had a truce with the Scything Claw tribe that has been in place for many years. The truce was a challenging achievement after Gildenglade and kobolds spent years on skirmishes and attacks against each other. Gildenglade ordered the adventurers to return the loot in fear of a war with chief [[Greshlyrr]]'s kobolds. However, Scything Claw tribe thought the raid was a grave offense, and Greshlyrr helmed an assault on the town of Gildenglade.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, citizens of Gildenglade became concerned by the nearby volcano - [[Mount Kolimnis]]. All signs pointed towards its eventual eruption and the city's demise. Gildenglade hired a [[wizard]], [[Danirro of Alaghôn]] to find a spell that could quell the roaring mountain. In the summer of {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Danirro was successful. The wizard climbed Mount Kolimnis to perform his long-researched magic. The man was never allowed to finish the spell chant as agents of the Emerald Enclave appeared by his sides and pushed him into the volcano. Danirro of Alaghôn was unlucky enough to be wearing his ''[[ring of feather falling]]''. He slowly roasted on his way down before disappearing forever in lava. Danirro's laboratory was destroyed by a suspicious blaze that erupted at the same time, and with the wizard and his home destroyed, the spell was lost. Gildenglade received a grim warning from the Emerald Enclave not to meddle with the forces they did not understand.\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, many rumors of gold and treasure attracted creatures known as [[crimson death]]. Late at night, these vampiric mists took on shapes of ghostly humans with picks, sacks of gold, and shovels, moving across the city streets. The mirages dissipated when touched; however, some successfully lured curious individuals into hidden spots to be slain and consumed. There were several theories about the nature of the crimson death. Some claimed they were guided by greater evil intelligence, while others said the creatures followed their instincts. Interestingly enough, there was never more than one crimson death witnessed at the time.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1423}}, [[Mount Kolimnis]] of the [[Aphrunn Mountains]], erupted, burying the city under several hundred feet of ash and hot mud. Almost 50,000 inhabitants died in the eruption, while only a few hundred fled from the disaster, carrying the memory of their destroyed home with them. Several years after the faithful eruption, cold lava cracked open, revealing a series of caverns that led into the dead city. Some brave adventurers attempted to helm an excavation but were faced with a strangely-well preserved ghost town infested with deadly denizens of the [[Underdark]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "*Before the town's destruction, many adventurers and dwarven prospectors were attracted to Gildenglade by its many stories of lost gold. These stories were many indeed. Some told of gold stolen by a caravanmaster and lost in the mountains, some told of golden ore taken during goblin and [[bugbear]] raids, while others claimed the existence of old honor-gold buried by dwarves.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Public House of Gildenglade]], the town's social center in the mid-14{{th}} centry DR.\n*[[Tallstrider Inn]], was a humble gnomish inn, popular in the mid-14{{th}} centry DR.\n*[[Temple of Lliira (Gildenglade)|Temple of Lliira]], one of the wealthiest temples in Turmish. It was guided to prominence by the Lady [[Morintar]], following the [[Time of Troubles]].",
