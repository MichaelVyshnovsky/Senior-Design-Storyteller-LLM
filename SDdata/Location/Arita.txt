'''Arita''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Arita, a small village with eigthy-three buildings, was once a serene and prosperous farming community. It served as a vital hub where local peasants could trade their produce downstream and interact with merchants from [[Okahira]]. However, recent events have cast a shadow over the village's former tranquility.

The village has fallen under the control of [[hu hsien]] from a nearby fortified tower. Shortly after assuming command of the nearby tower, one of the hu hsien infiltrated Arita, assassinated the [[myoshu]], and assumed his role. This impostor, along with his compatriots from the tower, was exploiting the village and its environs, masquerading as rightful authorities.

The villagers, deceived by the guise of legitimacy, have reluctantly accepted the hu hsien's oppressive rule, enduring their increasing demands and injustices. Yet, beneath this veneer of submission, tensions were escalating. The hu hsien's greed grows, even as their plunder yields diminishing returns, pushing the community to its breaking point.

As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, Arita stood on the brink of revolt, its people yearning for a figure of strength and leadership to rally them against their oppressors.
