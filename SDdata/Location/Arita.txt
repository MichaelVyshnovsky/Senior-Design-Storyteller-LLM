Arita was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura.
Arita, a small village with eigthy-three buildings, was once a serene and prosperous farming community. It served as a vital hub where local peasants could trade their produce downstream and interact with merchants from Okahira. However, recent events have cast a shadow over the villages former tranquility.
The village has fallen under the control of hu hsien from a nearby fortified tower. Shortly after assuming command of the nearby tower, one of the hu hsien infiltrated Arita, assassinated the myoshu, and assumed his role. This impostor, along with his compatriots from the tower, was exploiting the village and its environs, masquerading as rightful authorities.
The villagers, deceived by the guise of legitimacy, have reluctantly accepted the hu hsiens oppressive rule, enduring their increasing demands and injustices. Yet, beneath this veneer of submission, tensions were escalating. The hu hsiens greed grows, even as their plunder yields diminishing returns, pushing the community to its breaking point.
As of , Arita stood on the brink of revolt, its people yearning for a figure of strength and leadership to rally them against their oppressors.
