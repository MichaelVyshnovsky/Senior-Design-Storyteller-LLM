        "Geography": "The system of caves were located within the northern reaches of the [[Spine of the World]] mountains.",
        "History": "These caves were originally formed by a group of [[dwarven]] prospectors who sought out valuable minerals and metals.\n\nSome time later, the Reghedmen barbarians took up residence within the tunnels. These [[chardalyn berserker|berserkers]] came to be exposed to [[chardalyn]] and were tainted by the substance's inherent powers.",
        "Inhabitants": "The barbarians that dwelled within the cave were originally members of the [[tribe of the Bear]]. They forsook the worship of the tribe, and rededicated themselves to the Frostmaiden [[Auril]]. In return for their devotion, Auril bestowed upon them a sacred blue flame that granted them continual warmth and a form of limited immortality.\n\nTwo [[white dragon]] [[wyrmling]]s also dwelled within the caves, called [[Gelym]] and [[Tyzar]]."
