        "mainbody": "he Cave of the Berserkers was a cavern system in the Spine of the World named for the Reghedmen barbarians that dwelled within.\nThe system of caves were located within the northern reaches of the Spine of the World mountains.\nThese caves were originally formed by a group of dwarven prospectors who sought out valuable minerals and metals.\nSome time later, the Reghedmen barbarians took up residence within the tunnels. These berserkers came to be exposed to chardalyn and were tainted by the substances inherent powers.\nThe barbarians that dwelled within the cave were originally members of the tribe of the Bear. They forsook the worship of the tribe, and rededicated themselves to the Frostmaiden Auril. In return for their devotion, Auril bestowed upon them a sacred blue flame that granted them continual warmth and a form of limited immortality.\nTwo white dragon wyrmlings also dwelled within the caves, called Gelym and Tyzar."
