        "mainbody": "oryllvol was a small fishing village in southern Amn famous for its spring water.\nThe village sat on the Shimmalshyr river as it flowed to Lake Esmel.\nThe people of Coryllvol fished the river and traded their catch elsewhere, but found far more money in bottling and exporting their pure spring water. The Shimmalvol Waters Company maintained exclusive deals with buyers in Esmeltaran and Athkatla, ensuring the highest prices possible.\nSome time before 1370 DR, the village discovered that wealthy outsiders greatly prized their spring water and were willing to pay through the nose for it. Exploiting this market to the fullest, the village soon began increasing in size and wealth."
