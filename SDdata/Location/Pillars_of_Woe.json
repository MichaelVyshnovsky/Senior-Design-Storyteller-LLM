        "mainbody": "The '''Pillars of Woe''' was a cavern and gorge located between [[Gracklstugh]] and [[Menzoberranzan]] in the [[Northdark]] of the [[Underdark]].",
        "Geography": "The Pillars of Woe was located not far south of Menzoberranzan. It was {{SI|25|mile|k|long=yes}} north of [[Rhazzt's Dilemma]] and some {{SI|20|mile|k|long=yes}} from the [[Lustrum]] mine.",
        "Description": "The Pillars of Woe was a cavern half a mile across with its ceiling a few hundred feet high. There were shelf-like caverns on each side and many columns supporting the roof. In the center was a gorge that narrowed between two large columns.",
        "History": {
            "Battle of the Pillars of Woe": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Menzoberranyr [[Army of the Black Spider]] and the [[duergar]] armies of Gracklstugh (under the command of [[Horgar Steelshadow]] and the aid of [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]]) fought their first battle at the Pillars of Woe. It turned out to be an ambush; the duergar were already there when the drow arrived, as was the [[tanarukk]] army of [[Kaanyr Vhok]]'s [[Scourged Legion]], which turned on the drow. At the beginning of the battle, the contingent of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] also turned against their fellows. The drow army suffered high losses—a quarter to a third of their total number—and were only able to retreat back to Menzoberranzan when a small contingent of [[House Baenre]] was sent to cover their backs. The duergar and tanarukk armies continued on to besiege Menzoberranzan."
