        "mainbody": "'''Trollbridge''' was a small village near the [[High Forest]]. North of it lay the [[Evermoor Way]] and the [[Dessarin]] with the [[Dead Horse Ford]]. Less than two days' march from it lay the [[Drygully Tunnel]], an entrance to the [[Underdark]]. Through this raiding parties of [[drow]] came to the World Above to threaten the inhabitants of the small village.",
        "Structure": "A wooden palisade surrounded the village to protect it from raiders.",
        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], [[Fyodor]] and [[Liriel Baenre]] passed through the village to obtain supplies after emerging from the Underdark.\n\nIn the same year, the village was said to have been attacked by a drow female who had ensorcelled a swordsman. If the story was true, it may have been [[Quenthel Baenre]] in her pursuit of Liriel Baenre, or stories of Fyodor and Liriel themselves that the locals twisted due to the presence and/or prejudice against drow.",
        "Notable locations": "The only inn of Trollbridge was the [[Steaming Kettle]], run by [[Saida]] in [[1361 DR]]. The inn itself resembled a barn with stone walls and narrow windows. The inn served meals of dark ale and steamed grain porridge.",
