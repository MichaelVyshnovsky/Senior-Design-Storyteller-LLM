'''Lannort''' was a hamlet in [[the North]] founded in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
Lannort lay a short distance downstream of [[Loudwater]] on the [[Delimbiyr River]], in the upper [[Delimbiyr Vale]].

==Trade==
Lannort was home to the noxious [[Falthryn and Daughters Tannery]], and [[Galdegut's Boneyard]], operated by [[Morluth Galdegut]]. Both businesses were linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Samril's Fine Blades]] in [[Secomber]], to whom they supplied [[leather]] and [[bone]].
