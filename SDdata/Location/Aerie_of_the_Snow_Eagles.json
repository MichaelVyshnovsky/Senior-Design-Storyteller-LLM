        "mainbody": "The Aerie of the Snow Eagles was the only known large settlement of the avariel left on Toril. A citadel made of glassteeled crystal, it was located near the eastern edge of the Great Glacier, atop the sheared peak of Mount Sundabar, and part of the northernmost Icerim Mountains.\nThe avariel community of Mount Sundabar, including nests on the mountains flanks, was loosely governed by Winged Father Aquilan Greatspan, who had as of  led the community for near five centuries, and seen the avariel survive, if not exactly prosper, amidst the ruins of the Ice Kingdom of Dareth.\nBefore the First Flowering, the avariel, who had left Faerie before many of the rest of their elf kin, found themselves the frequent victims of dragon attacks. The dragons, who favored avariel flesh, eventually drove the avariel to the brink of extinction, forcing the survivors to live squalid lives as destitute nomads, unable to take flight for fear of being eaten. They slowly traveled east, hoping that their draconic foes would not find them.\nMillennia passed and eventually a group of avariel nomads braved the climb up a remote and sheer mountain on the eastern fringe of Pelvuria. Curiously, the peak of the mountain was gone and instead they found a great plateau. Assuming that the plateau was made by a Netherese arcanist to create one of their enclaves, the avariel decided to settle. Thankfully for the elves, the realm of white dragons that had lived in the range had all been killed by a group of dwarves not long previous. Safe from their ancient foes and isolated from those far below them on the ground, the winged elves managed to prosper.\nIn fact, so isolated were they that when the Retreat came in 1344 DR the Snow Eagle avariel failed to hear it. After a couple of decades though, Queen Amlaruil Moonflower heard of them and decided to send emissaries to the Aerie, hoping to inform her winged cousins of their potential new home.\nAs part of the crystal citadel was the temple of Aerdrie Faenya, with the entire settlement named after, and built around, the great temple. The temple was built to replace, and in likeness of, the lost top of Mount Sundabar. Within its glassteeled walls mild winds and tiny clouds danced around, with rain showers eruption out of thin air, a constant manifestation of the powers of the Lady of Air and Wind herself. The temple floor was overgrown with tropical plants, thriving in the sunlight and heat from the crystal walls, and watered by the rain to resemble a jungle paradise. Birds from near and far flew around alongside the Avariels whose young tested their wings inside the citadel."
