Min Loh was a fishing village in Malatra.
It lay south of Tran and stood on the bay that faced the Eastern Sea.
In the midâ€“14 century DR, it was considered the best spot for hunting sharks and even kraken if one further ventured out into the sea.
Min Loh was inhabited by sea spirit folk, who helped in hunting and fishing.
