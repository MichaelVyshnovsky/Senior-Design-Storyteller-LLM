'''Occidian''' was an [[elf|elven]] city before the [[Crown Wars]] and a center of elven music and dance in the northern parts of [[Faerûn]].

==History==
The city was destroyed in the [[-24400 DR|Year of Singing Sirens]] when a huge [[orc]] horde rushed over many parts of the northern continent. The orcs managed to overrun the northland plains and plunged deep into the forests. Many circles of High Magi had bonded with their brothers and sisters in the tower of Occidian so when the orcs broke the wards and destroyed the tower, a magical backslash killed many of the High Magi in other cities like [[Sharlarion]].
