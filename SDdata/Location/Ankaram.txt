Duchy Ankaram, formerly Ankramir, was the territory of Tethyr bordering Calimshan in the south.
Ankaram was located between the River Ith and the River Memnon. It was bordered by the Sea of Swords in the west and the Forest of Mir in the east.
The region was sparsely populated but included several well-guarded forts along the border, so Calimshan was cautious about ever attacking it.
The duchy contained two counties, Calimmon and Monteshi, the latter of which included Monrativi Teshy Mir, an area of contention between Calimshan and Tethyr.
Ankaram was the location of two of the most dangerous adventuring sites of Tethyr, the ruined cities of Shoonach and Memnonnar.
In 1369 DR, Duchess Vajra Valmeyjar ruled Ankaram, officially from her castle of Maratimmir, 30 miles east of the city of Myratma.
Ankaram was given to Tethyr as a gift in  by Syl-Pasha Kamus el Tarshaj of Calimshan.
Before the Tethyrian Interregnum, this duchy was known as "Ankramir". After Queen Zaranda Star rose to power in 1369 DR, Ankaram was considered a part of the Principality of Ankramir, which also included Kamlann and the Purple Marches.
