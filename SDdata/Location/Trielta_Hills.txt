The '''Trielta Hills''' laid to the north-east of [[Triel]] and north-west of [[Hardbuckler]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]

==Description==
The Trielta Hills was an area of pastoral and idyllic rolling hills, spotted with rocky outcroppings, tiny farming settlements, shallow close-to-the-surface "scratch mines," and an occasional fortified hold. The hills were crossed by a lesser-used northern winding branch of the [[Dusk Road]].

The hills were among locations linked through the [[magic]]al transportation network known as the [[Trail of Mists]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}

==Inhabitants==
They were home to many communities of [[rock gnome]]s as well as three communities of [[orcs]] by [[1492 DR]].{{Cite web/More of the Western Heartlands}} When words of such veins spread, it attracted dozens of adventurers and fortune-seekers who were seen as a blight by the locals. Because of the small volume of these mining discoveries, no nation or trade consortium cared to claim the land or set up large-scale mining operations.

Despite the idyllic nature, the Trielta Hills still had some danger. The rumors and news of precious metals attracted small-time crooks and thieves to the area, and of course, there were hungry monsters found in the hills.

==Rumors==
There were no rumors of lost kingdoms, wizards towers, ruined holds or any such thing about the Trielta Hills, making them almost unique for their normality.

==History==
Sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|-320}}, a collection of lizardfolk tribes called [[Kalran]], based out of the [[Serpent Hills]], attacked the rock gnome settlements in the Trielta Hills.  The surviving gnomes, fearing further invasion, fled their homes.

During the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return of the Archwizards]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the last three free of the deadly [[phaerimm]] came from the Trielta Hills, leading a force of [[hobgoblin]]s and [[illithid]]s towards [[Evereska]].

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Trielta Hills were still peaceful with an occasional spout of trouble. One band of marauding [[lizardfolk]] was found in the area, who took a gnomish family hostage. But the crisis was averted by a local halfling sheriff and a band of local militia.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the growing power of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] planned on co-opting the [[orc]]s of the Trielta Hills into their ranks. Agent [[Mhoss]], [[True Soul]] 26, was set to the [[Ringfork Stronghold]] but was dismembered by the stronghold's ruler â€“ Lord [[Heradd]] as the simple negotiation attempts were seen as a sign of weakness by orcs. The second recruitment attempt was sending Sir [[Yax]] of [[Scornubel]], another True Soul, who was intimately familiar with the orcish culture. Sir Yax was accompanied by two [[orge]]s and issued a challenge to Lord Heradd, using the death of True Soul 26 as an excuse. Yax was to defeat the orc ruler and force him to swear allegiance to the Absolute; in return, the cult was planning on offering Heradd help in subjugating the other two orcish tribes in the Trielta Hills.

*[[Ringfork Stronghold]], the orcish stronghold led by Lord [[Heradd]] ''circa'' 1492 DR.
