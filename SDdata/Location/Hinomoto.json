        "Description": "Hinomoto lacked distinctive mountain ranges, though the forested ridges running through [[Gumi Province]] were sometimes called the Fokobi Hills. Occupying the southern part of Gumi Province, the [[Fokobi Forest]] sustained the livelihood of the island's inhabitants, who engaged in fishing and timber cutting for repairing passing ships.\n\nThe largest town on Hinomoto, [[Itzuhachi]] in [[Mito Province]], served as a vital shipping port and stopover for vessels navigating the [[Straits of Ama]].\n\nRecognized as the Island of a Thousand Shrines due to its religious significance, Hinomoto boasted numerous temples and shrines devoted to [[Heavenly Brother]] and his lesser aspects, spread across the entire island, from coastal areas to the most remote forest lands. By decree of the first emperor, the presence of weapons was forbidden on the island to maintain its sanctified peace. Although this decree was occasionally disregarded, it remained punishable by death if enforced by the authorities. Within towns and villages, weapons were not openly worn, except by [[samurai]] who possess special dispensation from the shugodai in Itzuhachi.",
        "Inhabitants": "Residing along the northwest coast of Hinomoto, [[hai nu]] served as guardians of one of the entrances to the residence of the [[Lord of the Sea]]."
