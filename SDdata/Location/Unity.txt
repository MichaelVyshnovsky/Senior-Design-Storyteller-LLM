'''Unity''' was a [[Netherese]] city during the time of ancient [[Netheril]].

==History==
Unity was founded in the early 600s NY (around {{Yearlink|-3260}}) and served to defend against goblins.

Unity was the site for the largest of all temples constructed for the glory of [[Amaunator]]â€”the [[Forested Enclave of the Face of the Sun]]. This towering structure soared 17 stories into the sky and was visible for miles around.

In {{YearlinkConvert|3348|NY}}, Unity was successfully attacked by the bandit lord [[Olostin]], starting his 33 year reign of terror.<ref>

In {{YearlinkConvert|3499|NY}}, the city was besieged by extra-planar fiends, who waged a three-year war for the city before being banished or killed by [[Karsus]]. 

In the spring of {{YearlinkConvert|3514|NY}}, magically mutated creatures began coming out of the [[Far Horns Forest]] near Unity, believed to be caused by Karsus's use of [[heavy magic]] during the war against the fiends.
