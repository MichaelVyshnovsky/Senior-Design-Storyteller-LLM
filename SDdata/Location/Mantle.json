            "The Masterways": "These tunnels were north of the [[Clawrift]]. As they did not lead to wide areas of the Underdark, the Masterways were considered a very safe spot in the otherwise perilous area. Several drow nobles use these passages for sport hunting.\n\nWithin the Masterways were the Cavern of the Masters where the wizards of [[House Xorlarrin]] and [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] performed rituals to help [[Lolth]] in her creation of the [[Demon Weave]]. The Masters of [[Sorcere]] performed arcane experiments in the Masterways. The [[Glowstones]] were also in the Masterways, which acted as a meeting area with naturally luminescent rocks.",
            "The Wanderways": "The Wanderways were the northeastern caverns of the Mantle. They were a winding arcane maze constructed by the archmage of Menzoberranzan.",
            "The Westways": "These tunnels lead to [[Blingdenstone]], [[Mithral Hall]], [[Luruar]], [[Mantol-Derith]], and Phanlinksal. The Westways were often scouted and patrolled by drow forces. In these tunnels was the [[Lustrum]], an cavern filled with rich ore and [[gemstone]]s."
