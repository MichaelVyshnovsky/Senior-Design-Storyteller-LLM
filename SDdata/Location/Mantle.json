        "mainbody": "he Mantle was a series of passages and side-caverns around the main cavern of Menzoberranzan.\nThe Mantle consisted of dark tunnels that were spread throughout the Dark Dominion, and was split into sub-caverns the Eastways, the Masterways, the Wanderways, and the Westways.\nWithin the Eastways were Ablonsheirs Cave, named for Ablonsheir Uluar, a former archmage of Menzoberranzan, the Cavern of the Severed Tentacles, named for a failed invasion of illithids from Phanlinksal, and the Pit-Warrens, a jail for criminals and prisoners.\nThese tunnels led to Driders Chasm, the Fardrimm and the tunnels of fallen Delzoun, which was claimed by dwarves.\nThese tunnels were north of the Clawrift. As they did not lead to wide areas of the Underdark, the Masterways were considered a very safe spot in the otherwise perilous area. Several drow nobles use these passages for sport hunting.\nWithin the Masterways were the Cavern of the Masters where the wizards of House Xorlarrin and House Barrison DelArmgo performed rituals to help Lolth in her creation of the Demon Weave. The Masters of Sorcere performed arcane experiments in the Masterways. The Glowstones were also in the Masterways, which acted as a meeting area with naturally luminescent rocks.\nThe Wanderways were the northeastern caverns of the Mantle. They were a winding arcane maze constructed by the archmage of Menzoberranzan.\nThese tunnels lead to Blingdenstone, Mithral Hall, Luruar, Mantol-Derith, and Phanlinksal. The Westways were often scouted and patrolled by drow forces. In these tunnels was the Lustrum, an cavern filled with rich ore and gemstones."
