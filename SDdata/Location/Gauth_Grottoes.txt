The '''Gauth Grottoes''' formed an area of the [[Underdark]] distinct from its main regions. The grottoes were located 30 miles south and 7 miles down from [[Darkhold]]. They were close to the [[Northdark]], the [[Buried Realms]] and the [[Darklands]] but had no direct connections to any of these areas.
