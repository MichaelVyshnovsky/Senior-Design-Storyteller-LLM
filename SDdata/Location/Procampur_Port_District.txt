The Port District was a district of the city of Procampur in the Vast, comprising the harbor and entry gates. It was officially outside the city proper and outside the Thultyrls influence and laws.
Lying at the western end of the Great Way, beyond two huge towers, the Port District faced onto the Dragon Reach. Regardless, the port area was hemmed in by two stub walls leading off the main city walls that curved to meet the shore in a rough crescent. and another onto the Great Way and the main part of the city.
Being outside the citys laws, the buildings here kept to no particular purpose, style, size, or roof color, unlike the other districts that were reserved for specific activities. It contained places that could not or would not fit into the other districts, being home to warehouses, fisherfolk, and ship-builders that needed to be nearer the sea, as well as stables and facilities for training and caring for mounts and livestock that didnt belong to Procampan authorities. There were also cheaper inns and taverns that catered to travelers, as well as a number of small "bed-and-beer" houses that huddled around them. It could be a crowded and dank place, and in parts disreputable.
The docks comprised eleven piers. There were also two drydocks.
Contrasting with the order and duty of the other districts, the Port District was a relatively chaotic and dangerous place Although it operated fairly normally in the daytime, after night fell it became a rowdy area where the young and daring ventured out and dangerous folk prowled with cocky attitudes, ready weapons, and a need to show off. It was also commonly where one would hire coin-lads and coin-lasses to spend an evening with. Beggars were also present, as begging was banned elsewhere in the city. The Port District was said to be a place where something was always going on.
Visitors, citizens, and foreign traders here could come and go freely and act as they liked, within reason. To those who entered, the gate guards of the Diamond Legion would explain the citys rules and laws to all who asked, and did so readily and patiently.
Naturally, the Port District was the hub of Procampurs trade with cities in other lands. With frequent trade in and out of Procampur, the eleven piers were constantly in use all year round. Shipbuilding was also a significant business here, so the drydocks were also always in operation circa 1370 DR, a new ship for the Ravens Bluff navy was under construction.
Procampurs Diamond Legion kept the peace here as they did elsewhere in the city but usually only showed up after a fight was over and usually arrested both parties regardless.
However, corporal punishments and executions were also carried out here, at The Ways End.
On Uktar 17, the , a Sel√ªnite priestess visiting from Ravens Bluff named Justina Palfry was murdered in the Port District. Local rumor claimed this was committed by a supposed serial killer dubbed the Portside Mangler thought to be responsible for the recent deaths of a former barmaid and a dancing girl in the district. However, the Proctors declared there were no links between the murders. In fact, the Sharran priestess Inosencia Cielian was later found to have murdered Justina solely to become a Dark Justicar. 
Later, Lady Constantine Grimm was also murdered in the Port District, her body discovered in an alley by a passing bard who quickly alerted local people. A crowd of onlookers gathered that had to be dispersed by the Diamond Legion so the Proctors could investigate.
