        "mainbody": "'''Surcross''' was a heavily fortified town in western [[Thay]] on the border with [[Thesk]].",
        "Geography": "The town was located on the border of [[Thesk]] and Thay. It lay at the base of the [[Thayan Plateau]] east of the [[Thesk Mountains]] and south of the [[River Sur]] and the [[Sur Hills]]. Prior to the [[Spellplague]], the town lay along [[Cold Road|the road]] from [[Nethentir]] to [[Two Stars]]. Following the Spellplague, this region became craggy and broken, and the skies were often choked with smoke from the [[Thaymount]]. As such, the area came to be known as the [[Bonedark Hills]].",
        "Government": "Surcross was controlled by a Thayan military governor who ruled from the town's central citadel, the [[Tombstone]]. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], this was [[Ukulsid]], who would entertain his people's pleas and pass judgment on their disputes within the Tombstone's [[Hall of Petition]]. However, he was known to conscript or kill any petitioners who so much as annoyed him with their needs. Ukulsid was loyal to [[Szass Tam]].\n\nThe Thayan army was in complete control of the government and the town watch. Those who violated the law could expect to be imprisoned or expelled if lucky, but more likely executed and [[Animate dead|reanimated]] to serve in the army.",
        "Trade": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Surcross served as the eastern anchor of the Thayan's so-called \"[[Shadowfell Road]]\", which connected it to the [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] in [[Neverwinter Wood]] and served as a key supply line for [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]'s nefarious operations in the [[Sword Coast North]].",
        "Defenses": "Surcross was heavily fortified as of the late 15{{th}} century DR, and boasted a larger garrison than most cities many times its size. This was for the simple reason that Szass Tam, in his paranoia, saw the town as the first line of defense in the case of an unlikely assault on Thay from the west. The town and surrounding area were well-patrolled by Thayan forces both living and undead. Some of these forces rode [[chariot]]s pulled either by undead creatures or propelled wholly by [[magic]]. The most elite troops were the [[Sunmasters (Thay)|Sunmasters]], evil [[cleric]]s and [[warlock]]s who wielded radiant energies.\n\nThe town was ringed by a heavy stone wall nearly {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} thick and dozens of feet high. This was known as the [[Wall of Crypts]], so named because of the hundreds of corpses stored within the wall to serve as an emergency reserve army of [[zombies]] should the wall ever be breached. The main gate, known as the [[Gates of Bone]], was made from the bones of [[humanoid]]s and monsters, and could animate as a fearsome undead [[construct]] to defend the town. \n\nFive thin, windowless towers&mdash;hundreds of feet tall but only a few dozen feet in diameter&mdash;stood equidistant from the town's center along the perimeter. These were known as the [[Fingers of Szass Tam]], and employed a number of powerful defensive magics. The walls were enchanted to allow defenders to see and hurl [[spell]]s from inside, but were solid [[marble]] to any attackers from outside. In addition, the Fingers had the ability to project fields of force, which could serve either as bridges to quickly deploy troops around the city or as shields to protect from areal assaults (although such a shield could only spread across the whole city for a few minutes at a time).",
        "History": "Because of its location, many renegade [[Red Wizards]] were known to pass through Surcross while fleeing west out of Thay.\n\nThe entire region surrounding the town was devastated during the Spellplague in the late 14{{th}} century DR, \n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Surcross was the largest Thayan settlement west of the Thayan Plateau, At this time, town's garrison was comprised of soldiers loyal to Valindra Shadowmantle and Ukulsid&mdash;both of whom in turn served Szass Tam&mdash;however servants of [[Dempharis Sibront]], the self-proclaimed \"[[zulkir]] in exile\", had begun to infiltrate their ranks.\n\nThat same year, as part of the ongoing [[Shadovarâ€“Thay War]], Surcross came under attack from the floating [[Netheril|Netherese]] citadel of [[Kolthunral]]. The city's forces proved largely insufficient to repel this assault, and soon the town's vast garrison had been reduced to half strength, even accounting for the practice of reanimating slain soldiers or civilians to add to the undead ranks. and only the protective shields of the Fingers of Szass Tam prevented the town from being completely obliterated by areal bombardment. As the situation became more dire, the Thayan army instituted martial law, locking down the town, requisitioning nearly all remaining food, and brutally repressing any dissent or disrespect in the populace, no matter how mild. During this siege, the town was said to be choked in hot smoke and eerily quiet.",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Fingers of Szass Tam]], five highly magical guard towers around the town's perimeter.\n* The [[Garrison (Surcross)|Garrison]], a heavily fortified series of barracks for the Thayan troops, which contained ''[[teleportation circle]]s'' to allow for speedy deployment around the city.\n*[[Gates of Bone]], the main passage through the town's defensive wall.\n*[[Tombstone|The Tombstone]], the central citadel from which the town was ruled. The top floor contained an opulent throne room wherein the town's leaders could commune with Szass Tam, while the cellar contained a massive ossuary used for necromantic experiments.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Isma Lecere]], a corporal in the Thayan military who led the elite [[Sunmasters (Thay)|Sunmasters]] contingent in the late 1470s DR.\n* [[Omdros]], a [[half-orc]] [[death mage]] who led the saboteurs loyal to Dempharis Sibront embedded within the Thayan ranks in the late 1470s DR.\n* [[Ukulsid]], an undead gnoll who served as the town's military governor in the late 1470s DR."
