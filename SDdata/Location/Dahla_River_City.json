        "mainbody": "Dahla River City was a quiet waterfront village in ancient Netheril.\nThe town was located east of the Shinantra Mountains and south of the Hidden Forest, at the point where the Dahla River entered the western Hidden Lake. Its closest neighbors were Trinity to the south and Hoyden to the north.\nThe village was first settled in . The pioneers cleared the area south of town to plant crops and build ranches, and led quiet, isolated lives. In , the Dahla River flooded and almost destroyed the town, leading to the construction of the nearby Whitewater Bridge in .\nThe isolation of Dahla River City was such that their first indication that something was amiss in Netheril was a sudden phaerimm attack in , which destroyed the village. The few survivors fled south into the new wastelands of Netheril, witnessing the aftermath of the battles between the sharn and phaerimm, with only a handful surviving to join the Netherese successor states thanks to the intervention of a group of adventurers."
