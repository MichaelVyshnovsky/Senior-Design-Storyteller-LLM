The Lair of the Night Masters was the secret lair of Manshoon and his vampire associates during the time he led the Night Masks in the guise of Orbakh. 
The lair was located in Westgates sewers and could only be entered through the secret back entrance in a trapped tunnel. 
The lair had several coffins which were fakes designed to fool thieves and to cower lower-ranking Night Masks. A trapped teleporter led to Orbakhs audience chamber.
The main entrance had been destroyed around 1391 DR by the Eye of Justice.
