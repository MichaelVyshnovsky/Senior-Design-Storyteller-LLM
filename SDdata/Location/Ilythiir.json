        "History": {
            "[[Dawn age]]": "The [[elf|elves]] came to [[Toril]] via gates of the [[Fey]], around {{Yearlink|-27000}}. The [[dark elf|dark elves]] were the members of the second immigrant wave and differed from the elves of the first immigration wave, [[aquatic elf|aquatic elves]], [[avariel]]s and [[lythari]]s, It wasn’t clear how they managed it but the Ilythiiri negotiated with dragons and founded the first elven state on [[Faerûn]], Ilythiir, with the capitol of [[Atorrnash]]. \n\nLike all other elves during that time, the Ilythiiri didn’t have an idea that something like an [[Seldarine|elven pantheon]] existed. [[Ghaunadaur]]’s faith was a minor player but had only a small following. In Ilythiir, religious affiliation wasn’t a factor that prevented one from climbing the social ladder as proven by [[Ka'Narlist]], a follower of [[Ghaunadaur]], who managed to advance to a position like one of the leaders of Attornash.Where he was respected to foreign diplomats whom he met for the first time.\n\nAfter accidentally destroying their own country around {{Yearlink|-25400}}, elves from [[Tintageer]] fled to Toril. then killing, and then taking the red dragon [[Mahatnartorian]]’s territory for themselves.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-25000}}, the [[Dracorage mythal]] was created as a concerted effort of elves. This act, gradually weakened the hold of the dragons and eventually lead to the end of the Time of Dragons and with it to the start of the [[First Flowering]].\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-24500}}, [[Lolth]]’s attention was directed to Toril through the intrusion of Kethryllia into her [[Demonweb Pits]].",
            "[[First Flowering]]": "During the first millennium of the First Flowering, Ilythiir spread further to the south and to the east of the continent. Around the time of {{Yearlink|-23200}}, Ilythiir's territory included the [[Shaar]] and the [[Forest of Amtar]].\n\nDuring this time Ilythiir was on generally good terms with the newly founded elven nations,\n\nAround [[-18000DR]], some Ilythiiri nobles discovered [[Ghaunadaur]] as a suitable patron for them. Other evil [[deity|deities]], [[Lolth]] among them, also made inroads into the nobility of that country.\n\nIn a matter of centuries, [[Lolth]]'s machinations successfully poisoned the previously good relationships between Ilythiir and the other nations. It went to the point, that the different [[elf|elven]] subraces sought a means to get rid of [[dark elf|dark elves]]. The idea didn't revolve around killing but the creation of a dark-elf free piece of land. Among those who were excluded from the project and from the result were dark elves on their side like worshipers of Eilistraee The exclusion heightened general resentments between dark elves and others.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-17600}}, the [[First Sundering]] to create the aforementioned dark elf-free land was cast, the continent was destroyed as collateral damage. Among this collateral damage was [[Atorrnash]], Ilythiir's capitol. The casualties in lives were immense Conflict with the [[church of Eilistraee]] opened the path for Ghaunadaur and Lolth to become more popular.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-17500}}, three [[elf|elven]] realms, [[Thearnytaar]], [[Eiellûr]] and [[Syòrpiir]] made steps to unify themselves into a single nation. Ilythiir sabotaged these efforts",
            "[[Crown Wars]]": "The Crown Wars were a series of wars that led to the end to the [[elf|elves]]' golden age."
