'''Orthul's Notch''' was a sparsely-populated [[fish]]ing hamlet on [[Cape Raeth]] to the southwest of the [[Cloakwood]].

==Description==
Orthul's Notch was nestled in a small indent in Cape Raeth's eastern side, facing [[Cloak Bay]]. By the 14{{th}} century DR, Orthul's Notch was a collection of single-store cottages reinforced with local wood and scavenged marine salvage. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in the Notch.

The few remaining inhabitants of Orthul's Notch survived through salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for [[crab]]s, [[silverfin]]s, and [[laethe]], a species of [[eel]]-like creatures.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Orthul's Notch, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14{{th}} century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster assaults.
