        "mainbody": "'''Termalaine''' was the second-northernmost settlement of [[Ten Towns]], and the third largest in the region in the 1300s. As delightful as it was, the town maintained a bitter fishing rivalry with the walled settlement of [[Targos]]. The city gets its name from [[tourmaline]] mining.\n\nIt was home to a great many craftspeople and shipwrights, whose work was placed on display with the fleet of fishing vessels that were owned by the town.",
        "Geography": "Termalaine was located on the eastern shore of [[Maer Dualdon]], due north of [[Bryn Shander]].",
        "Government": {
            "Relationships": "Termalaine's main rival was [[Targos]], and their feuds for fishing rights on [[Maer Dualdon]] from time to time ended in bloodshed."
        },
        "Trade": "Historically, the area was rich in [[tourmaline]] mining.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|1342}}, [[goblin]]s raided Termalaine. Were it not for the intervention of [[Clan Battlehammer]], the town may have been destroyed.\n\nThe city of Termalaine was taken over several times by [[barbarian]] forces. The infamous barbarian [[Heafstaag]] had previously conquered it twice, but failed a third. During his last attempt, in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, Heafstaag and his allies tried to conquer all of the Ten Towns in one massive attack.\n\nThe attack by the [[Tribe of the Bear (Icewind Dale)|Tribe of the Bear]] during the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]] forced more than half the townsfolk to take shelter in [[Bryn Shander]], but the damage was quickly repaired.",
        "Defenses": "In time of war, the city could call upon around 100 to 500 [[human]] militia who fought with [[dwarf|dwarven]] weapons and wore lightweight armor.",
        "Notable locations": {
            "Inns and Taverns": "* [[Blue Clam]]: This fisherman's favorite tavern was decorated with [[scrimshaw]] and trophies\n* [[Eastside|The Eastside]]: This comfortable and spacious inn was among the best accommodations in all of Icewind Dale",
            "Landmarks": "* The gem mine, which was regularly close and re-opened depending on the activity of monsters coming up from the [[Underdark]].\n* Market Square, located along the harbor.\n* Town hall, located a block from the Market Square.",
            "Residences": "* Agorwal's House, a large house located near the center of town."
