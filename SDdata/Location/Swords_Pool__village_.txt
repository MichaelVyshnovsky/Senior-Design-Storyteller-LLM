'''Swords Pool''' was a [[village]] in [[the Vast]], lying on the [[North Road]] between [[Dead Tree Hollow]] and [[King's Reach]].

==Description==
The village lay in a wooded dell on the North Road. It served as a stopover for travelers, and was notable for its high-quality inn, the [[Inn of the Nine Swords]], which stood on the western side of the road. Around [[1370 DR]], it was owned by the three [[Mellicot]] sisters: [[Melicent Mellicot|Melicent]], [[Meliors Mellicot|Meliors]], and [[Melusine Mellicot|Melusine]].

Behind the inn lay [[Swords Pool (pool)|Swords Pool]] itself, a deep and dark body of water. The Mellicots stocked the pool with [[trout]] and a type of fish they called "[[manyfins]]". They discouraged fishing, but some people did it anyway on dark nights.

==Local legends==
The pool was the source of a local treasure tale that gave it, the village, and the inn their names. In the early history of the Vast,{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades|}} to protect and preserve them.

In the mid-1370s [[DR]], several young [[blade magic]]ians of the Vast re-founded the Nine Swords Company, and used the Inn of the Nine Swords.
