The Gloomfrost was a large cavern in Icewind Dale, situated somewhere far to the northeast beyond the Reghed Glacier.
Many monsters laired here and ice tunnels that connected to it were infested by remorhazes.
The Gloomfrost was also home to an elderly prophet who called herself the Gloomfrost Seer and a blind dwarven smith named Tiernon Denthelm of Clan Hearthstone.
