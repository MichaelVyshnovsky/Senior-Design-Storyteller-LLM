        "mainbody": "'''Halfhap''' was a heavily fortified small town on the northern frontier of [[Cormyr]]. It was one of Cormyr's farthest-flung holdings, and had a large [[Purple Dragons]] garrison.",
        "Geography": "Halfhap was located on the [[Moonsea Ride]] at the edge of the [[Stonelands]], halfway between the [[Thunder Peaks]] and the [[Storm Horns]]. [[Tilverton]] was about {{SI|60|mile|k|long=yes}} to the northeast, the closest major settlement.{{Cite interactive atlas|Sembia}} To the southwest, the Ride climbed through [[Gnoll Pass]] and beyond the [[Storm Horns]], reaching [[Castle Crag]] and then [[Arabel]] at the terminus of the Moonsea Ride about {{SI|130|mile|k|long=yes}} away. \n\nThe [[Stonebolt Trail]] bypassed Halfhap and Tilverton entirely, running in a straight line across the Stonelands from Gnoll Pass to [[Shadow Gap]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Cormyr}}\n\nOther notable sites in the area included the ruins of [[Darkenshield]], the [[Tower of Ruin]], and [[Wyvernwatch Castle]].",
        "Trade": "As it was functionally a heavily fortified camp for the Purple Dragons in the desolate border regions of the Stonelands, Halfhap was very dependent on imports of finished goods, especially for the military. It mostly functioned as a central point of protection and supply for the scattered prospectors, ranchers, hunters, and other rural folk who lived in the Stonelands and around the upper [[Immerflow]] river. As the gateway to the Stonelands, Moonsea, and Dalelands, it also served as a stopping point for travelers, merchants, and adventurers passing through to other lands.",
        "Defenses": "As the bulwark of Cormyr against the wilderness of the north, Halfhap was extremely well defended. It regularly dealt with [[Zhentarim]] raids, hordes of [[orc]]s, and monsters migrating out of the Stonelands. Out of its population of 2,200, approximately 1,100 were [[Purple Dragons]], including an elite force of [[hippogriff]] cavalry. It was surrounded by a solid curtain wall, and had large gate-keeps at the eastern and western ends of the town. Four large barracks were arrayed around the inside of the wall, each housing up to 300 Purple Dragons. A large, specialized stable in the west end of town housed the hippogriffs.\n\nThe keeps had four floors and space for 100 soldiers to bunk. They had inner and outer gates, extensive arrow slits and murder holes, and were fitted with boiling oil dispensers and [[ballista]]e. Underground armories with winch-powered elevators supplied ballista bolts and other supplies to all levels of the keeps.\n\nThe garrison patrolled as far as [[Gnollpost]] in [[Gnoll Pass]], and [[Mootpost]], halfway to [[Tilverton]]. The heavy military presence meant that Halfhap and the roads around it were generally safe, though not at all welcoming.",
