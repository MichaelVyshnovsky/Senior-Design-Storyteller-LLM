        "mainbody": "Sows Foot was a district in the Outer City of Baldurs Gate. It was the eastern-most neighborhood located outside of the city walls, nestled in between Twin Songs and Whitkeep. The borders between these locales were not well-defined and often the subject of great debate.\nThere were few, if any, notable locations in this neighborhood.The Murder in Baldurs Gate DMs screen shows Hamhocks Slaughterhouse as being in the middle of the Sows Foot district, but the more recent Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus explicitly states it is in Stonyeyes."
