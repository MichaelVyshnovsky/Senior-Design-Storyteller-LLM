        "Geography": "Essembra sat astride [[Rauthauvyr's Road]], and saw a large amount of traffic on that road between [[Sembia]] and the [[Moonsea]].\n\nThe mansion of [[Sharburg]] was located some miles southwest of town.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-22/Sharburg}}",
        "Description": "The town itself was deep in the forest of [[Cormanthyr|Cormanthyr:]] the trees of the Elven Court woods hemmed Essembra on all sides. There was a central walled section of the town surrounded by fields, along with of cottages fronting along Ratuthauvyr's Road for a mile or more. Few cross streets or back alleys cut through the town.\n\nAccording to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], visitors usually found Essembra pleasant, but curiously unimpressive.",
        "History": "Essembra was settled when the Ordulin-Hillsfar road was cut through the Elven Court.{{cite book/Dragons of Faer√ªn|97}}\n\nFor centuries, Essembra was barely even a hamlet. When Aencar became the Warlord of Battledale in [[1030 DR]], he declared Essembra to be his seat since it was near his [[Aencar's Manor|ancestral manor]]. Aencar's chief lieutenant, [[Ramorth Wyvernblade]], took the title of lord of Essembra and built his manorhouse there.\n\nIn [[1422 DR]] [[Sembia]]ns allied with [[Netheril]] fought forces from [[Myth Drannor]] near Essembra.  The battle forced abandonment of the town.",
