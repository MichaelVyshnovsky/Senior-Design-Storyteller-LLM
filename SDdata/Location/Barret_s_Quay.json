        "mainbody": "arrets Quay was a small island in the eastern reaches of the Korinn Archipelago in the Moonshae Isles.\nThis island lacked any major port cities. Its population consisted primarily of humans, along with a few dwarves. Residents of the island were noted by outsiders for their taciturn nature.The text states that \"no other races\" could be found on Barrets Quay besides dwarves and humans, however, this is contradicted by one of the sample characters for Treasure Hunt being an elf from the island (p. 4)."
