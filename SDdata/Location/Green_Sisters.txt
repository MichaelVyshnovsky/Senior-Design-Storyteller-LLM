The Green Sisters were an archipelago of islands east of Maztica.
The Green Sisters were sparsely-populated jungle islands with freshwater streams and sandy beaches. The main population of the islands was bronze-skinned Maztican humans who wore golden jewelry and face piercings. The inhabitants were friendly and survived on hunting and fruit gathering. The dreaded hakuna creatures were a major danger in the islands jungles. Like many parts of Maztica, the human inhabitants practiced slavery.
In the , the Green Sisters became the first landfall of the Golden Legion trade expedition that ended up "discovering" the continent of Maztica. Cordells ships reached the northernmost island of the Green Sisters on the 40 day of the expedition. By the 47 day, the Golden Legion visited several other archipelago islands while moving south, finally stopping at the island that would later be known as St. Ippen. Friendly locals greeted the expedition on each of the islands and willingly shared their fresh water and fruit with the strange taller metal-clad humans. On St. Ippen, Cordells expedition used the tongues spell to communicate with the locals who happily shared information on nearby mainland Maztica. While on the island, Halloran of the Golden Legion was attacked by a fearsome local hakuna beast, a black-colored dragonne, but survived the enchanter. As a gift, the expedition received several young female slaves – a gift happily accepted by Cordell and his trusted cleric of Helm – Bishou Dominicus. The clerics daughter Martine was infuriated with her father for accepting such a savage gift that went against their Helmite faith. Nevertheless, her objections were dismissed by the commanders.
On Tarsakh 18 of the , Gondites of Lantan built a temple on the largest island of the Green Sisters. The island was named St. Ippen and priests began work on the Great Lighthouse.
