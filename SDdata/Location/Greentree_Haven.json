        "mainbody": "reentree Haven, also known as the Dancing Place by Dove Falconhand, was a glade on the Sword Coast that had once been the Magister Eirl Rauthantannar.\nAnyone under any spell in the haven could turn invisible at will for as long as they bore a spell, and for up to four minutes afterwards. Those who leapt within the grove were affected as per the jump, faerie fire and feather fall spells, unless they willed otherwise.\nThose who were aware of the glades properties could, through an act of will, change the temperature by up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) for as long as they remained in the grove or until someone else changed it again. During extremes of temperature, though, this was liable to generate fog at the edges of the grove.\nThose who cast spells such as fly, telekinesis or levitation found the effect tripled in duration, and the range to encompass the entire grove. Those who cast protective spells, on the other hand, found all their effects maximized in strength and improved to the limits of conventional magic, whatever their own power as casters furthermore, those who cast a defensive spell within the grove gained the ability to recast it without the need to refresh their powers, up to once per spell cast.\nThe glades final and most elusive power was its ability to enhance item enchantment. It allowed for double efficacy, allowing for twice as many charges, or for the enchantment to take half as long, for instance.\nIn , Eirl Rauthantannar, already old, decided to undergo Mystras Choice, and laid down in barren ground, asking that it bear life once more. Mystra approved of his choice, transformed his decanter of endless water into a spring, and the land around his body into an enchanted grove.\nIn , Dove Falconhand attempted to improve the enchantment of several swords at Greentree Haven. Unfortunately, a curse cut her efforts short, and she only left alive because of Mirts appearance. She was a regular dancer at the grove."
