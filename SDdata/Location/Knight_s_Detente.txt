The '''Knight's Detente''' was a boisterous festhall with rooms for rent in [[Eshpurta]] in early [[1370 DR|1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard]].

It was a place for soldiers to carouse, flirt, gamble, laugh, and spend their pay on poor quality but overpriced food and drink. Non-military were not welcome, although it was said that a person could gain entrance if they could last more than five seconds arm-wrestling the burly [[half-orc]] bouncer, [[Xom]].
