        "mainbody": "Suiters Hill was a small rustic yet prosperous human town in the Vast, far from the bustling metropolis of Ravens Bluff.\nSuiters Hill was located about three weeks worth of travel northeast of Ravens Bluff. The town had strong ties to merchant organizations, including those that ventured across the seas to Maztica.\nThe town proper was laid out around its main street with the Temple of the Vigilant, a once-majestic temple dedicated to Helm, placed at its end. Interiors of many buildings and establishments in town were decorated with Maztican ornamentations – furniture, wall decorations, ceramic masks, sculptures of bone, clay, gold, rose quartz, carved obsidian, and tapestries of woven feathers.\nThe town of Suiters Hill was run by the local Church of Helm. The citys Mayor was a member of the clergy, and the High Watcher was the towns sheriff. Aside from these two positions of power, the clergy had the governing power. The sheriffs wore gold-foiled stars that bore Helms Unsleeping Eye.\nIts main industry was farming and agriculture, and in the years after the colonization of Maztica, it became famous for growing vast fields of the rare Maztican species of maize, or corn. Maztican corn took to the towns fields wonderfully and quickly influenced its trade and culture, being the only producer of Maztican corn in all the Vast. The town also raised horses, cows, chickens, and hogs.\nTo no surprise, Suiters Hills cuisine was thoroughly corn-centric – everything made with corn meal, corn bread, corn-on-the-cob, corn pone, corn relish, corn chowder, hominy stew, popped corn, and many other maize dishes.\nIn the late 14, the , Suiters Hill became strangely cut off from the rest of the Vast, and its corn fields turned into a fiendish \"reality wrinkle.\" All was done by a powerful ultroloth called Eyes of Fire, who was imprisoned in Maztica and brought to Suiters Hill. The fiend spread its influence out of its obsidian prison after the Baglin Brothers robbed and torched the local temple of Helm, killing the towns sheriff – High Watcher, and the High Priest. Without the priest, Eyes of Fire was able to spread its magic out and started plotting its freedom. When odd things began happening in town after the fire, Mayor Jeb Galtin sent a word to Ravens Bluff, offering a payment in exchange for the help of the Living City heroes.\nThe heroes investigation proved fruitful. They discovered an obsidian box – a sarcophagus that impressed the fiend. Its magic was damaged during the Baglin Brothers robbery. Jeb Galtins daughter, the paladin named Cassie, deputized adventurers as honorary members of the church and made them the Deputy Watchers. In their investigation, the adventurers cared with endless swarms of crows that plagued the corn fields, all driven into frenzy by the fiend, as well as attacked by animated scarecrows, and enthralled villagers and village elders who were preparing the Eyes of Fires release.\nOn the second day of the investigation, enthralled villagers finished the construction of a pyramid that would be used for a ritual sacrifice to release the Eyes of Fire. The enthralled cultists kidnapped Cassie Galtin, intending her to be the sacrifice. The heroes battled Matthias, whose body was inhabited by the ultroloth while trying to spare innocent villager lives. Eventually, the creature was defeated and sealed once again by the reassembled Xoxitlhuachis golden snake idol.\nSubsequently, any and all damage done to the town was quickly repaired and the temple rebuilt, thanks to the booming lucrative corn trade. Some of the Helmite adventurers from the Bluff took over the Temple of the Vigilant, and some even suggested that one of them wed Cassie Galtin.\n*Kiln, a humble potters shop and a massive spin used to create Maztican-style ceramics.\n*Maize House Inn, the towns main inn run by Matthias in the late 14 century DR.\n*Pyramid in the Cornfield, a tall sacrificial multi-tiered pyramid built by the enthralled villagers in the late 14 century DR.\n*Smithy, a workshop located on the bluff of the plateau, overlooking the endless sea of corn.\n*Tannery, a walled chemical-filled building, operated by a town elder named Zach in the late 14 century DR.\n*Temple of the Vigilant, the temple to Helm attended by five priests, burned down in 1371 DR.\n*Woodshop, a fenced carpenters shop on the towns main road, worked by six young muscular men and a single village elder and the master carpenter named Guiser, in the late 14 century DR.\nInhabitants of Suiters Hill were humans who rarely saw any demihumans or other more exotic species of humanoids. Many were wary of these strange outsiders, while some even displayed xenophobia towards anyone they considered \"freaks.\"\n*Abe, a child who volunteered to guide the town guests in the late 14 century DR.\n*Bob, a farmer who died defending the town from the Baglin Brothers in the late 14 century DR.\n*Jeb Galtin, the towns Mayor and a Novice of Helm in the late 14 century DR.\n*Cassie Galtin, Mayor Galtins daughter.\n*Kline, a harpsichord player employee of the Maize House Inn in the late 14 century DR.\n*Neham, a High Watcher and a town defender, killed in the late 14 century DR."
