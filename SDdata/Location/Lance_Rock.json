        "mainbody": "'''Lance Rock''' was a stone monolith outside of [[Red Larch]], a few miles west of the [[Long Road]]. This landmark was {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}, slender, and made of stone unlike any found in the region.",
        "Geography": "Lance Rock was located about {{SI|15|mi|k|long=yes}} southwest of Red Larch and stood on an open plain. It could be seen from miles away when the weather was clear. It was gray [[granite]], had nothing noticeable growing on it, and leaned to the east at about 30 degrees from vertical.",
        "History": "Sometime in the distant past, the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]] (better known as \"Old Gnawbone\") noticed a young [[red dragon]] (named [[Smergadas]]) had invaded her territory and gorged himself on the local wildlife. As he slept off his overindulgence, she brought this enormous lance of stone all the way from the [[Sword Mountains]] and dropped it on the invader.{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Claugiyliamatar, \"Old Gnawbone\"}} By the [[1491 DR|Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR]], there was no trace of the vanquished dragon, but Lance Rock still stood.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In 1491 DR, some folks in Red Larch believed Lance Rock had an evil presence that caused a plague to threaten the town."
