'''Dynloch Pass''' was a pass through the [[Synnorian Mountains]] in central [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]], connecting [[Myrloch Vale]] to the main body of [[Corwell]]. It exited the mountains on the south side near [[Freeman's Down]]. It was close to, and might join into, [[Synnoria]].<ref>

==Description==
It lay very high in the mountains, and its approaches were winding and hidden, making it little-known to all but the local druids, [[dwarves]], and [[Llewyrr]] [[elves]].

==History==
The pass and the lands around were once tended by the [[druid]] [[Gwendolynn]], but she was killed in the {{YearlinkName|1345}} by [[Trahern]] while he was laying a trail for the invading [[Northmen]].

The pass was subsequently used by [[Grunnarch the Red]], the [[Bloodriders]], and accompanying Northmen and [[firbolg]] armies in an attempt to split Corwell in two and intercept refugees fleeing from eastern villages. It took them two days to traverse the pass.
