'''Vehlarr''' was a city named after its creator, the werewolf [[Vehlarr]], who united the werewolf packs of the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] into a single nation. The city was the site of the [[Circle of Vehlarr]], a magic portal into the city of [[Myth Lharast]], until the deity [[Selûne]] destroyed both cities in [[720 DR]], after being angered by the warfare between them.{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Six}}

==Rumours==
It is rumoured that Vehlarr was not destroyed and still exists on another ageless plane. On nights of a full moon, the city is supposed to return to [[Abeir-Toril]] and it supposedly accessible through the [[Circle of Vehlarr]]. The rumour has never been substantiated.
