The only way into the small village of log homes was by taking the trail to Red Larch.\nThe economy of the village centered around logging and the horse-powered sawmill. As of 1365 DR, the leader of the loggers was a wizard named Ghelkyn who levitated the cut timber to waiting horse teams who would then transport them to Red Larch for sale.\nAs of 1365 DR decisions about the town were made by consensus but the most influential people were Ghelkyn and Shala Thaeral, the Voice of the Circle.\nThe small village was also home to Tchandrae Euinwood, a girl with mysterious powers of magical identification.\n* The Stag at Rest was a dark tavern run by Delgara the Slim."
