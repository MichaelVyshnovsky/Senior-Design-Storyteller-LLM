'''Visrana''' was a ruined city within the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]].

==History==
The ancient and decaying ruins of Visrana were discovered by [[Kuong]] soldiers in service to the temple of the [[Lords of Creation]]. Exploring the long-sealed tombs, they inadvertently unleashed spectres and other wicked creatures. Thereafter, they abandoned the city to the jungle once more, and the Priest-King of the day forbade any exploration of the ruins or their surroundings, and only the courage or the foolish tried. The nat of Visrana went on to plague [[Gapapurang]].<ref>

==Inhabitants==
By the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ruins and jungles around were haunted by [[spectre]]s, [[Nat (spirit)|nat]], and other supernatural creatures.
