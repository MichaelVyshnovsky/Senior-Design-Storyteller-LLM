Buldamar was a small village found in Okoth.
The village was found along the eastern shore of Azulduth, the Lake of Salt, in southeast Faer√ªn.
Buldamar began as a collection of camps setup by adventurers exploring the nearby Okothian ruins called the Vaults of Record. The prosperity of the inhabitants who stayed in Buldamar rose and fell over the centuries depending on the number of explorers drawn to the region. During slow times the villagers scraped together a living mining salt and fishing on Azulduth.
As of the , Okoth was alive with activity from Sarrukh agents in human form who explored the nearby ruins for any remaining treasure, and hunting down anyone they could find who had removed treasure from the area.
