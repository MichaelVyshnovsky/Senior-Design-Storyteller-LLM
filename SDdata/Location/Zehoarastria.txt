Zehoarastria was the formal name of the region of Amn north of the Small Teeth and west of the Trade Way.In this introduction of the area, Volo defines Zehoarastria as "all of Amn between the Trade Way and the sea" however, after that, he only treats the region as encompassing lands north of the Small Teeth. Lands south of the Small Teeth belong to the Swordbelt. So it is assumed that the word all was misused on his part.
Encompassing the lands of Amn between the Sea of Swords and the Trade Way, Zehoarastria was named for the swampy floodplains found within its territory. The infamous traveler and author Volothamp Geddarm postulated that Zehoarastria would have been one enormous city were it not for the presence of the swamp.
