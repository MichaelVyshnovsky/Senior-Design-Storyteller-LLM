They were originally formed and continually encircled by an eddy of water made by the currents of the Trank River.\nThe isles were situated in a tight grouping on the north coast of the Moonsea, south of the Twilight Marsh swamp.While the exact location of the Ringcurrent Islands is not show on a map, it was said to be south of the Twilight Marsh, a location shown on the map included on page 56 of Dungeon magazine 170.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the black dragon Throstulgrael relocated to the nearby Twilight Marsh and claimed dominion over the resident lizardfolk. Throstulgrael leveled many of the lizardfolk huts along the northern and western islands, forcing them to relocate to those further south.\nTo appease the dragon, the lizardfolk of the captured two score people from the farms along the Trank River and imprisoned them in cages on the central Kings Island.\n* Kings Island, the Y-shaped island in the center of the archipelagos eddy. While all three tribes of the Twilight Marsh, made camp on the isle, it was the ancestral home of the Lizard King that ruled over all the lizardfolk.\nThe Muckmarsh clan of lizardfolk built their thatched huts on many of the Ringcurrent Isles."
