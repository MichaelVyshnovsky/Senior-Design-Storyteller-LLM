        "Description": "The rock was tall and blade-like in shape. It sat atop cliffs overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice, and rose over {{SI|140|feet|long=yes}} above these already {{SIAdj|160|foot|long=yes}} cliffs.<ref group=\"note\">This height is based on the description of Revel's End's tower, which is described as being carved out of the Windbreak.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the high-security prison of [[Revel's End]] was carved out of the rock's northwest side. The rock earned its name because of its role in shielding the prison from the harsh winds coming off the [[Reghed Glacier]]."
