Ithmong Calimaronn
Darromar, formerly known as Ithmong,There are two cities called "Ithmong" in the Realms Ithmong in Tethyr and Ithmong in Lapaliiya. Thus it is not always clear which mentions of "Ithmong" pertain to the one in Tethyr and which to the one in Lapaliiya. However, the Tethyrian Ithmong is more well known and better detailed. was a metropolis and the capital of Tethyr.
It lay on the River Ith. Its central location ensured that the queens armies in 1479 DR were never more than five days hard ride from any trouble in her domain.
The city included a scenic river walk paved with red bricks and decorated with lilac and honeysuckle and flanked with willow trees.

The city was divided into quarters by the River Ith (east&ndashwest) and the Ithal Road (north&ndashsouth), with the Ithal Bridge in the center. Clockwise from the northwest quarter to the southwest quarter were
* The Royal Quarter,
* The Black Quarter,
* The Caravan Quarter, and
* The Temple Quarter.
The city was formerly ruled by a council, but Queen Zaranda felt that it was necessary to have one person in charge at the top. This position was held by the Lord-Mayor Ternan Grannox in 1370 DR. It was a position that was appointed or elected once every three years. In truth, however, Ternans Consort Brenna Grannox dictated her husbands every move, manipulating him with lies that resulted in some improper treatment of her social and/or political foes.
The city watch had around 200 members, but the army of Tethyr, a further 5,000, was garrisoned in this city when not on duty or assigned elsewhere.
The settlement began as a Calishite frontier garrison town named Calimaronn until it was sacked in the Battle for Calimaronn by Tethyrian tribes led by Chieftain Mong Ithal of Clan Ithal. The town was named Ithmong from thenceforth.
