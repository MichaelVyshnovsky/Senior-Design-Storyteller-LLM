Tymanther Unther
The Methtir, an Untheric word for "Northern Plains", was the name of the northwestern shore of the Alamber Sea, in the Old Empires region.
The Methtir extended east from the Riders to the Sky to the Alamber Sea. Those lowlands were mostly composed of wild woods and arid grasslands.
For most of its history, the Methtir was the northern region of Unther.
During the Second Sundering, of Nightal 26 of 1486 DR, large swaths of the Methtir region were exchanged with lands of the equivalent region in Shyr, a continent of the world of Abeir, when the Untherans were returned to Toril. The Untherans quickly reconquered the Methtir, but were unable of retrieve their other former lands. As of 1489 DR, most of the reborn nation of Unther was located in the Methtir region.
