Delzoun, also known as the Northkingdom, was a great dwarven nation of the North during the Age of the Proud People, reigning over the north for almost 4,000 years, from  to .
At the height of their influence and strength, the kingdom extended from the Ice Mountains south to the River Rauvin and Nether Mountains.
The name survives as a middle name among modern day dwarves, one bearing much prestige.
The Dirge of Delzoun was an epic dwarven ballad that recounted tales of the kingdoms mightiest heroes and greatest treasures.
Like their kin from Ammarindar to the south in the Greypeak Mountains, the dwarves of Delzoun were masterful smiths and stone masons.
Much of the Delzoun wealth was gained by trading with the Netherese humans, though they were also known trading allies of the elven realms of Illefarn and Eaerlann. They notably created the Fardrimm, a series of underground roads spanning the breadth of their empire and beyond into other areas of the North. The most famous of these underground roads was the Lowroad, which linked the Delzoun lands with Netheril. Dwarves of Delzoun would often trade gems, ironworks and weapons for gold and arcane secrets from the magocratic empire.
