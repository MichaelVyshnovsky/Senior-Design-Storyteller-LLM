'''Delzoun''', also known as the '''Northkingdom''', was a great [[dwarven]] nation of [[the North]] during the [[Age of the Proud People]], reigning over the north for almost 4,000 years, from {{Yearlink|-3900}} to {{Yearlink|-100}}.

==Geography==
At the height of their influence and strength, the kingdom extended from the [[Ice Mountains]] south to the [[Rauvin|River Rauvin]] and [[Nether Mountains]].

==Society==
The name survives as a middle name among modern day dwarves, one bearing much prestige.

===Culture===
The ''[[Dirge of Delzoun]]'' was an epic [[dwarvish|dwarven]] ballad that recounted tales of the kingdom's mightiest heroes and greatest treasures.

===Trade===
Like their kin from [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] to the south in the [[Greypeak Mountains]], the dwarves of Delzoun were masterful smiths and stone masons.

Much of the Delzoun wealth was gained by trading with the [[Netherese]] [[human]]s, though they were also known trading allies of the [[elven]] realms of [[Illefarn]] and [[Eaerlann]]. They notably created the [[Fardrimm]], a series of underground roads spanning the breadth of their empire and beyond into other areas of the North. The most famous of these underground roads was the [[Lowroad]], which linked the Delzoun lands with [[Netheril]]. Dwarves of Delzoun would often trade [[:category:gem stones|gems]], ironworks and [[weapon]]s for [[gold]] and [[arcane]] secrets from the magocratic empire.

==Notable locations==
;Landmarks:
*[[Fardrimm]]:
*[[Lowroad]]:

;Settlements:
*[[Ascore]]: This bustling port city, found on the shores of the [[Narrow Sea]], prospered during the years when Delzoun trafficked goods to and from ancient Netheril.
*[[Citadel Adbar]]: The heroically resolute fortress survived for centuries after the fall of Delzoun, and joined the nation of [[Luruar]] for some time, before closing their borders to outsiders in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
*[[Citadel Felbarr]]: The capital fortress of Delzoun endured the orc invasions that claimed the realms of the Northdark,
*[[Citadel Sundbarr]]: Built over the great volcanic chasm known as the [[everfire]], this dwarfhold survived Delzoun's collapse by virtue of the colossal defenses forged from the primeval flame. It would go on to serve as the embodiment of the unity shared between the dwarves and heart humans of the North. 
*[[Ghaurin's Hold]]: This millennia-old stone keep manor was the ancestral home of the [[Stoneheart]] clan, and served as a monument to their storied history.

==History==
The kingdom was founded by a dwarf of the same name.

The dwarves completed construction of [[Citadel Felbarr]] in {{Yearlink|-1900}}.

The [[Illuskan]] [[Maerin]] commissioned a number of Delzoun artisans, including [[Immar Fardelver]], to construct [[Gauntlgrym]] in {{Yearlink|-335}}.

[[Citadel Sundbarr]] and [[Ascalhorn]] accepted human refugees from the recently fallen Netheril in {{Yearlink|-333}}. In the same year, the dwarves began to slowly abandon [[Ascore]].

In the [[-111 DR|Year of Terrible Anger, -111 DR]], the Delzoun fell prey to the same [[orc]] assaults that devastated other kingdoms of the North, though the kingdom endured for few more years. Finally, in {{Yearlink|-100}}, Delzoun fell to the [[phaerimm]]s and other dangers. Surface settlements including [[Citadel Adbar]], Citadel Felbarr, [[Mithral Hall]], and [[Sundabar]] survived the fall but the [[Underdark|underground]] settlements of the Northdark were not so fortunate.
