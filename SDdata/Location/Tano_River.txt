The Tano River, also known as the Tanokawa, was a river located in Kozakura.
The Tano River was located on the island of Shinkoku. Its mouth was found next to Waturi Forest and the town of Renkyu.
Verifiable encounters of Lord of the River confirmed his presence in the Tano. A shrine to the Lord of the River was built within the river itself, upstream of Renkyu. River spirit folk and humans who relied on the river for their livelihood made regular pilgrimages to the shrine. Treasure was found within the shrine, as a result it was guarded by water elementals, giant carp, and water spirits.
