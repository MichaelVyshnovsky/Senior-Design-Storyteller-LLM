The '''Tano River''', also known as the '''Tanokawa''', was a river located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
The Tano River was located on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. Its mouth was found next to [[Waturi Forest]] and the town of [[Renkyu]].

==Inhabitants==
Verifiable encounters of [[Lord of the River]] confirmed his presence in the Tano. A shrine to the Lord of the River was built within the river itself, upstream of Renkyu. [[River spirit folk]] and [[human]]s who relied on the river for their livelihood made regular [[pilgrim]]ages to the shrine. Treasure was found within the shrine, as a result it was guarded by [[water elemental]]s, [[giant carp]], and water spirits.
