The '''Spider Swamp''' was a hot, fetid swamp resting at the southwestern corner of [[Calimshan]].{{Cite interactive atlas|B1cSElc}}

==History==
The swamp was formed when a great [[marid]] was slain.

The demon lord [[Zanassu]] the Spider Demon once ruled over the evil creatures of Spider Swamp.

By [[1479 DR]], the area of the swamp had dried up and become the [[Plain of Stone Spiders]]. At this time, the local creatures had been changed by some power which granted them elemental powers.
