Bregonshire was an open plain located in the kingdom of Callidyrr on the island of Alaron within the Moonshae Isles.
Bregonshire comprised much of southern Stirgewick in Callidyrr, ranging from the Rushdown Wood through the peninsula of the South Great Head to the coast of the Sea of Swords. The High Kings Road passed through Bregonshires western side near the coast of the Strait of Alaron.
