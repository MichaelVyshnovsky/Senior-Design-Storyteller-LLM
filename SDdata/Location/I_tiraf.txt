Itiraf was a large city that served as the capital of the federation of Pantheist cities in 1367 DR. The governing body of the region, the League Conclave, was located here.
It lay on the banks of Al-Hadi River, directly across the Golden Gulf from the Pearl City of Jumlat.
Like all Cities of the Pantheon, Itiraf held to strict moral standards and exclusive belief in the five Gods of the Pantheon. Citizens strongly believed in the comparative barbarism of people from outside the Pantheist League, and the city had a reputation for finding out breakers of the law and punishing them swiftly, leading to its title "City of Confessions".
Apart from priests and sages in religious lore, Itiraf exported glassware and crystals.
The Sword of the True Gods kept 8,000 soldiers and 3,000 cavalry stationed in Itiraf. The city also maintained a watch of 2,000 guards and 300 clerical reserves. Six mamluk units of the Exalted and Devoted Mamluk Society, numbering 1,800 men, also served here. Itirafs navy consisted of 16 ships.
