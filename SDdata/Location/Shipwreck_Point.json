        "History": "During Zhentil Keep's razing, the majority of the city's navy was assaulted by [[white dragon]]s, resulting in the vessels being encased in giant blocks of ice. The miniature icebergs eventually came to rest naturally in the spot that would be later known as Shipwreck Point. In the years following Zhentil Keep's destruction, the clergy of [[Umberlee]] declared Shipwreck Point to be consecrated by their goddess, proclaiming that any who dared defile the place would risk the Bitch Queen's curse.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The dead sailors caught within the frozen ships were believed to haunt the region as [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, and [[ghoul]]s."
