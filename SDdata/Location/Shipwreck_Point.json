        "mainbody": "hipwreck Point was a section of the River Tesh that was home to a collection of ruined ships following the destruction of Zhentil Keep in the .\nShipwreck Point lay on the south coast of the River Tesh just east of the Foreign Quarter. \nDuring Zhentil Keeps razing, the majority of the citys navy was assaulted by white dragons, resulting in the vessels being encased in giant blocks of ice. The miniature icebergs eventually came to rest naturally in the spot that would be later known as Shipwreck Point. In the years following Zhentil Keeps destruction, the clergy of Umberlee declared Shipwreck Point to be consecrated by their goddess, proclaiming that any who dared defile the place would risk the Bitch Queens curse.\nThe dead sailors caught within the frozen ships were believed to haunt the region as zombies, skeletons, and ghouls."
