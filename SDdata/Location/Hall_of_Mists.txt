The '''Hall of Mists''', located deep inside the [[High Forest]], was an ancient stronghold of the [[Ba'etith]], an organization of sages and lorekeepers that began in the ancient [[sarrukh]] empire of [[Isstosseffifil]]. Their role as the constructors of this temple remained in the form of two [[Stone golem|stone golems ]]resembling bipedal [[dinosaur|dinosaurs]].

These golems protected [[gate|gates]] within the temple that allowed one access to both realms in the [[Outer Planes]] and the [[Negative Material Plane]]. They also guarded several ornamental treasures, including [[gold]] and [[Platinum]] statuary, religious ornaments, and a number of magical artifacts.

The Hall of Mists were also guarded by a powerful [[arakhor]], known as the [[Grandfather Tree]], summoned here by the elves in {{Yearlink|-12500}}. Wards around the tree, presumably placed by them, prevented anything from breaching the gates from their opposite sides.

In {{Yearlink|-2436}}, an unknown thief stole seven of the [[Nether Scrolls]], and three of them were hidden away in the Halls of Mists. The three Nether Scrolls were later scattered to other locations by [[Mintiper Moonsilver]] in [[1344 DR]].

In the [[883 DR|Year of the Fell Firebreak, 883 DR]], the magical chaos emanating from [[Hellgate Keep]] caused the place to be infested by giant red ants. The ants tunneled deep and opened passages to the Halls of Mists.
