The Castings was a district within the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
Situated beneath the Furnace, Castings served as the barracks for the efreeti army.
Castings was the home of the efreeti soldiers, including the Ring of the Unquenchable. Since fighting among the soldiers was a common event, regular citizens were not safe here.
