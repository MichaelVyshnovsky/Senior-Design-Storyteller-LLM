        "History": "In [[1263 DR]], [[Fzoul Chembryl]] broke with the [[Black Lord's Altar]], the orthodox banite church run by the [[High Imperceptor of Bane]] in [[Mulmaster]] and declared the Black Altar the new centre of the Black Lord's church.<ref name=GHR> With this power shift, Fzoul brought a large portion of Zhentil Keep's priests of Bane into the ranks of the [[Zhentarim]].<ref name=RoZK> Fzoul remained highpriest of the Black Altar well into the 1350s [[DR]].{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|269}}\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], warrior-priests of the [[High Imperceptor]] briefly took control of the Black Altar, but Fzoul routed the orthodox banites.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|276}} During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], the Black Altar was destroyed when the [[avatar]] of the god Bane fell to the Realms directly on top of the temple. Bane ordered the temple to be rebuilt. On the final night of [[Marpenoth]], [[1361 DR]], the Black Altar was again devastated by a huge column of flame that fell from a low hanging cloud. This was the signal that the [[Banedeath]] was to commence. Again, it was rebuilt, though as a temple to [[Cyric]]. \n\nFrom [[1361 DR]] to [[1368 DR]], the Black Altar was a temple to Cyric, but in 1368 DR, the Black Altar finally obliterated by a blast of powerful divine fire sent from the god [[Mask]]. On a nine-day ritual in [[Mirtul]], [[1370 DR]], Fzoul Chembryl consecrated the ruins of the Black Altar to [[Iyachtu Xvim]] and summoned the [[Tyrantfog]]. the Black Altar was still not rebuilt.",
