It was the site of the [[Kingdom of Nix]].<ref group=\"note\">The geographic location of Nix is determined by comparing the game map of ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' with standard maps of the region.\n\nThe only way to reach it was through the elusive [[Phantom Pass]], but even then, Nix only appeared once a year, around harvest-time. [[Vanesci Hamlet]], a [[human]] settlement, lay near the entrance in [[Konigheim]], many miles from Nix.\n\nThe almost-alien landscape around Nix was covered in slabs of gray stone and greenish swamps dotted with ponds. The trees were weirdly formed, with tendril-like branches and above-ground roots."
