        "mainbody": "Nonthal was a city, reputed for being the most peaceful and stable in the nation of Turmish, in the Vilhon Reach.\nThe citizens of Nonthal loved the citys stability and attempted to stay out of conflicts if possible. For that reason, the numerous adventurers that passed through were often met with cold shoulder and the overwhelming stench of the towns cattle industries.\nThe city itself was quite dull in appearance. Its streets were filled with market stalls and tradesmen.\nThe city had a functioning sewer system, that was fixed, expanded, and improved by Joster Barbellow, of the Barbellow gnome family. The \"Lord of the Sewers\" was hired by Nonthal for the job sometime in the 15 century DR.\nthumb|A map of Turmish, showing the location of Nonthal along the 265x265px\nNonthal stood just north from and connected to the Turmway and the town of Centaur Bridge via a well-traveled road that continued further north towards the towns of Sambryntyn and Moonhunt Down a bit further.\nThe citys main trade was cattle. Nonthal was surrounded by a strong aroma of manure, slaughterhouses, and the chemical stench of its many tanneries. It served as a market town for smaller farming communities that were sprinkled around Nonthal.\nThe city was named after a wizard, who moved there in the early-to-mid 13th-century DR. He built his cottage behind an inn and put up signs warning people to leave him alone, then promptly disappeared. His house was quickly ransacked of valuables, and the cottages stone walls were broken apart to be used elsewhere.\nAt some point in the late 14 century DR, a powerful mage named Fern walked Nonthals Path, dispelling its portals with his clever spells. When he reached the destination – an old dung hole that held the final portal to the fabled wizards lair, Fern attempted to dispel it. However, the magic traps were smarter than Fern, and they teleported him to Anauroch, across Faerûn. This attempt was witnessed and immortalized in writing by Adamar Session, bard of Starmantle. Eventually, Fern returned to Nonthal and could always be found in the Three Trees Inn, plotting further attempts.\n*13 Gates of Magic, a set of portal traps that guarded Nonthals Hold, scattered every three steps along Nonthals Path. Without uttering correct passwords for each, they spirited unwitting adventures to Yliyl of Anauroch, Whitehorn mountains of Thar, Dlathilvaer of Evereska, serpent-infested location in Chult, Halruaa, Underdark, among others.\n*Nonthals Hold, the hidden lair of the wizard Nonthal, protected by a series of magical teleporting traps along Nonthls Path. The hold itself was rumored to be hidden in Feywild, and contained powerful enchanted items and spellbooks.\n*Nonthals Path, the road that began in the center of the city and led towards the magically-hidden Nonthals Hold, beyond a misused dung-pit.\n*Three Trees Inn, the center of most activities in the city and the main lodging available for ambitious gold-seekers. Individuals who were brave enough to walk Nonthals Path were a major entertainment for the guests of the inn.\nNotably, Nonthal had a significant gnomish population, reviled only by the city of Xorhun. Many of them were illusionists by trade and made a living entertaining and pranking travelers with sparkling lights and raucous sounds."
