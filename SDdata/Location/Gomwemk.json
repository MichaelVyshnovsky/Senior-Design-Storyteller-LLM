        "mainbody": "omwemk was a village located in the Alpuk region, in the Novularond, and was the largest Innugaakalikurit settlement within the Great Glacier.\nGomwemk was located in a deep valley, surrounded by mountains. \nThe village was composed of modest ceenach and snowhouses, surrounded by a stone wall,  in height. The wall itself was surrounded by a trench,  in width and  deep, and was filled with fairy ice.\nThe village was itself a ruse. Due to their fear of frost giants, the villagers lived in an intricate network of tunnels and caves underneath the surface. The entrances to the tunnels were located in a few snowhouses within the stone walls on the surface and blocks of ice hid the tunnel entrances. Several tunnels extended beyond the stone wall and trench of the village above, leading to hidden entrances several miles away.\nThe villagers lived their lives underground. The inhabitants mainly left the tunnels to restock on food supplies, but also to get some fresh air and bathe in the sun. \nA group of inhabitants, calling themselves the Surfacers, have begun to question this way of life. The growing faction believes that returning to the surface was the best way forward for the village, and that the villagers could defend themselves from frost giant raids."
