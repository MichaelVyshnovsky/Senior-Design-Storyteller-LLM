The Tunnels of Dwarvenhome were a series of tunnels that connected the islands of Gwynneth and Alaron within the Moonshae Isles.
The tunnels exited Gwynneth at multiple points beneath the Taeya Bog, passing beneath the northern reach of the Strait of Alaron. They continued beneath the northern region of the Dernall Forest before reaching the Fairheight Range.
The dwarven Clan Rustfire fled Gwynneth via the Tunnels of Dwarvenhome in the late 15 century DR in order to escape the evil fey forces that were amassing there.
