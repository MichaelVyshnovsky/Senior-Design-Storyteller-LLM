The '''Tunnels of Dwarvenhome''' were a series of tunnels that connected the islands of [[Gwynneth]] and [[Alaron]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|4}}

==Geography==
The tunnels exited Gwynneth at multiple points beneath the [[Taeya Bog]], passing beneath the northern reach of the [[Strait of Alaron]]. They continued beneath the northern region of the [[Dernall Forest]] before reaching the [[Fairheight Range]].

==History==
The [[dwarven]] [[Clan Rustfire]] fled Gwynneth via the Tunnels of Dwarvenhome in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] in order to escape the evil [[fey]] forces that were amassing there.
