Kalb Bahriy Sahr, or the Shark Reef, was a island chain formed from coral reefs. This reef was located in the Djinnis Claws in the Crowded Sea southwest of mainland Zakhara. 
These small islands were composed of coral and rock. No known charts existed for safely navigating them, making most sailors give them a wide berth.
Dangerous waves and powerful storms surrounding the reef regularly dashed ships against the islands if they got too close.
As the name implied, the waters surrounding these islands were teeming with sharks of all sizes represented by many different species.
