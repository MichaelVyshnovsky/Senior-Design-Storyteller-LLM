            "Defense": "The city houses a large fleet of ships, both military and mercantile. The port was well-protected by the royal warships."

        "History": "The settlement of ''Impil's Tor'' was originally founded by [[Impil Mirandor]] in the [[135 DR|Year of Old Beginnings, -135 DR]], atop the ancient dwarfhold of [[Felimar]]. The founder Impil was a refugee who fled the fall of ancient [[Jhaamdath]]. The fledgling settlement was renamed ''Lyrabar'' by Impil's son [[Ornrath Mirandor|Ornrath]], in the [[-118 DR|Year of Elven Delights, -118 DR]], who proceeded to open up trade agreements with the nearby [[dwarven]] settlements.\n\nIn the [[1295 DR|Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR]], the capital city of [[Dilpur]] was sacked during the [[Prince's Revolt]]. When [[Rilimbrar|King Rilimbrar]] assumed the throne that year, he established Lyrabar as new capital of the re-established kingdom.\n\nWhen the [[Spellplague]] struck in [[1385 DR]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] receded, the city's port was left dry, disrupting trade until the port was rebuilt closer to the water.  Lyrabar was known for its criminal organizations, which made secret arrangements with the city guard.",
