        "mainbody": "Lyrabar, previously known as Impils Tor, was a great port-city that served as the capital of Impiltur for many years. It boasted some of the most grand and beautiful builds of the realm, including the Royal Palace and the tower of the Lords of Imphras II.\nThe city was long and narrow, stretching over a mile along the northern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nPrior to the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR, the city had no slums or impoverished quarter. The priests of Ilmater tended to the poorer citizens of Impilturs large cities and maintained their social welfare.\nLyrabar was home to one of the trade enclaves operated by the Red Wizards of Thay.\nThe city houses a large fleet of ships, both military and mercantile. The port was well-protected by the royal warships.\nThe settlement of Impils Tor was originally founded by Impil Mirandor in the Year of Old Beginnings, -135 DR, atop the ancient dwarfhold of Felimar. The founder Impil was a refugee who fled the fall of ancient Jhaamdath. The fledgling settlement was renamed Lyrabar by Impils son Ornrath, in the Year of Elven Delights, -118 DR, who proceeded to open up trade agreements with the nearby dwarven settlements.\nIn the Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR, the capital city of Dilpur was sacked during the Princes Revolt. When King Rilimbrar assumed the throne that year, he established Lyrabar as new capital of the re-established kingdom.\nWhen the Spellplague struck in 1385 DR and the Sea of Fallen Stars receded, the citys port was left dry, disrupting trade until the port was rebuilt closer to the water.  Lyrabar was known for its criminal organizations, which made secret arrangements with the city guard.\nLandmarks\n* Royal Gaols The city was home to one the several prisons that harbored criminals of the realm.\n* Royal Palace\n* Tower Pureheart\n* Towers of the Wind"
