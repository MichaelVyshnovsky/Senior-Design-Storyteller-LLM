The '''Tesh Bridge''' connected the main quarters of [[Zhentil Keep]] with the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] on the southern shore of the [[River Tesh]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The bridge crossed the River Tesh where it merged with the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]], connecting the eastern sections of the [[Zhentil Keep/Harbor District|Harbor District]] and [[Zhentil Keep/Common Quarter|Common Quarter]] with the Foreign Quarter.

==Description==
Two main gates, the [[North Tesh Gate]] and [[South Tesh Gate]], sat at either end of the bridge. Each gate was flanked by a pair of guard towers manned by [[Zhentilar]] soldiers.

A series of water gates found beneath the bridge controlled all ship traffic to and from the Moonsea via the River Tesh.

==History==
The Tesh Bridge was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, during the assault on the city by the forces of [[Cyric]] during the [[Fall of Zhentil Keep]]. The bridge was blown up by [[orc]] forces resentful of their treatment by the Zhentilar as they retreated into the Foreign Quarter.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Gond|Gondsmen]] were contracted to rebuild the Tesh Bridge and reconnect the Foreign Quarter with Zhentil Keep. The Gondsmen's efforts were stymied several months later by attacks from the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].
