'''Hyecho''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. It primarily produced baskets (of poor quality).

==Description==
Hyecho was a tiny, depressing village. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as ''[[minka]]'', built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.

The people of Hyecho were, as a rule, hateful individuals and un trusting of outsiders to the point of refusing to accept anyone not from the village through their gates. The village had a population of about 150 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.

==Geography==
Hyecho was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of [[Tsukishima]], north of [[Fochu]], off a spur trail from the [[Hisano Road]].

==Government==
Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]]. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed.

==Trade==
The xenophobic citizens of Hyecho refused to trade with anyone from outside their village.

==Defenses==
About 15 citizens of Hyecho served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.

==Religion==
Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Hyecho were not particularly religious.

==History==
Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.
