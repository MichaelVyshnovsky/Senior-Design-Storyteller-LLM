'''Bloodbark Grove''' was a grove of trees found in the southern stretch of the [[High Moor]] on the [[Sword Coast]].

==Geography==
It was located a short ways away from the [[Misty Forest]], southeast of [[Dragonspear Castle]].

===Flora & Fauna===
[[Blackthorn tree]]s and [[belladonna]] bushes were found within the grove.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Dushwick|Lord Dushwick]] and his manservant [[Chalmers]] were passing through the grove, traveling from the nobleman's estate. Unfortunately for him, Chalmers lost nearly half of his lord's belongings during the journey.

==Notable Locations==
A single stone house could be found within the Bloodbark Grove. It was home to a hunter, his wife, and their son. At some point the young man went missing in the forest and was transformed into a [[vampire|fledgling vampire]]. Someone in the household was the proud owner of the [[Sundermaul|warhammer]] that was falsely stated to have been the fabled ''[[Crom Faeyr]]''.

==Inhabitants==
The woods were full of dangerous creatures such as [[wolves]], along with their [[dire wolf|dire]] and [[dread wolf|dread]] varieties, as well as [[greater basilisk]]s and [[bombardier beetle]]s. Even the plants of the grove were deadly, as evidenced by the resident [[shambling mound]]s.

It was also home to an elder [[druid]] named [[Onoroth]].
