        "mainbody": "'''Wyrm's Crossing''' was a double-bridge structure that spanned the [[River Chionthar]] along the [[Trade Way]]. Unlike most bridges in the Realms, it housed a number of structures and was considered once a district of the [[Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The great stone bridges of the crossing were connected by [[Wyrm's Rock]], the massive [[Flaming Fist]] fortress that rose far above the waters of the river.\n\nAll of the goods that passed to the district of [[Rivington]] by land were taxed at Wyrm's Crossing.",
        "Description": "[[File:WyrmsCrossing.png|thumb|''A map of Wyrm's Crossing.'']]\nThe bridges of Wyrm's Crossing were massive stone arches that rose high above the waters of the Chionthar river. They were constructed beyond the islet in the center of the river, which housed the [[Flaming Fist]] stronghold of [[Wyrm's Rock]].\n\nExtending from either side of Wyrm's Rock were wooden drawbridges that could be raised or lowered to halt foot-and-cart traffic or allow tall ships to pass underneath. While the bridges were so tall that nearly any ship could pass underneath without trouble, the most prodigious of naval vessels were forced to navigate beneath the northern bridge, as the waters below were deeper. Ships of all sorts often traveled beneath Wyrm's Crossing at night, when the bridges were always raised. Having this done during daylight hours required a special fee paid to both the Flaming Fist and the city's coffers.\n\nAtop the bridges proper were an assortment of wattle-and-daub buildings, such as tenements and shops, built atop their expanse and precariously slung over their sides. This formed a narrow road that wound between the congestion of buildings, through which caravans and other travelers had to maneuver. Wyrm's Rock allowed for none of this overland traffic to pass around its walls, forcing travelers through its well-guarded tunnel.",

            "Landmarks": "* [[Wyrm's Rock]]: This [[granite]] fortress loomed over the small islet that connected the bridges of Wyrm's Crossing."
