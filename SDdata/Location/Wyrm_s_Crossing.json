        "mainbody": "yrms Crossing was a double-bridge structure that spanned the River Chionthar along the Trade Way. Unlike most bridges in the Realms, it housed a number of structures and was considered once a district of the Outer City of Baldurs Gate. The great stone bridges of the crossing were connected by Wyrms Rock, the massive Flaming Fist fortress that rose far above the waters of the river.\nAll of the goods that passed to the district of Rivington by land were taxed at Wyrms Crossing.\nthumb|A map of Wyrms Crossing.\nThe bridges of Wyrms Crossing were massive stone arches that rose high above the waters of the Chionthar river. They were constructed beyond the islet in the center of the river, which housed the Flaming Fist stronghold of Wyrms Rock.\nExtending from either side of Wyrms Rock were wooden drawbridges that could be raised or lowered to halt foot-and-cart traffic or allow tall ships to pass underneath. While the bridges were so tall that nearly any ship could pass underneath without trouble, the most prodigious of naval vessels were forced to navigate beneath the northern bridge, as the waters below were deeper. Ships of all sorts often traveled beneath Wyrms Crossing at night, when the bridges were always raised. Having this done during daylight hours required a special fee paid to both the Flaming Fist and the citys coffers.\nAtop the bridges proper were an assortment of wattle-and-daub buildings, such as tenements and shops, built atop their expanse and precariously slung over their sides. This formed a narrow road that wound between the congestion of buildings, through which caravans and other travelers had to maneuver. Wyrms Rock allowed for none of this overland traffic to pass around its walls, forcing travelers through its well-guarded tunnel.\nBusinesses\n* Danthelons Dancing Axe This popular establishment sold all manner of items that an adventurer might need on their journeys.\nLandmarks\n* Wyrms Rock This granite fortress loomed over the small islet that connected the bridges of Wyrms Crossing."
