It was established by [[Azkuldar III|King Azkuldar III]] as a means to protect the kingdom from the increasingly antagonistic [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]] located on the surface of [[Faer√ªn]] to the east.",
        "Activities": "Within the college, Ammarindar [[wizard]]s would research new [[spell]]s and methods of spell preparation, with the particular focus of thwarting the [[Netherese arcanist]]s.",
        "History": "Xothol was established in the year {{Yearlink|-550}} at a time when the [[arcanist]]s of Netheril began experimentation with the [[Shadow Weave]]. Once the Empire fell in {{Yearlink|-339}}, support for the arcane institution waned in the kingdom and it was finally shut down by [[Tormalk|King Tormalk]] in {{Yearlink|-286}}, and magically sealed until it was needed once again. The college remain unmolested during the fall of Ammarindar during the rampage of the [[demon]]s from [[Ascalhorn]] in [[882 DR]], and well into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
