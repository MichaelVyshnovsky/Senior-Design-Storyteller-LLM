The ancient port city of '''Zazesspur''' was the former capital of [[Tethyr]].<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />

==Description==
Architecturally and culturally, Zazesspur was an odd mixture of Tethyrian and [[Calimshan|Calishite]] influences, with others blended in. Most buildings were several stories tall and constructed of tight-fitting stone. They were decorated ornately around windows and doors and along the edges of the roofs.

==Geography==
The city was located on the [[Sword Coast]], south of the [[Starspire Peninsula]].

The coastal plains around Zazesspur were markedly more green than the lands further east and inland.  The city was bisected by the [[Sulduskoon River]] as it flowed into the sea.

==Layout==
[[File:Zazesspur map.png|thumb|right|300px|''A map of the city, showing its districts and gates.'']]
The river divided the city into a southern [[Zazesspur/Low City|Low City]] and a northern [[Zazesspur/High City|High City]]. The Low City was older, having been built over older ruins. The High City was larger and represented what most folks though of when hearing the word "Zazesspur".<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />

The High City was divided into six districts, which included:<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />
* [[Zazesspur/High City/The Bindery|The Bindery]]
* [[Zazesspur/High City/Wainwrights' District|Wainwrights' District]]
* [[Zazesspur/High City/Garden District|Garden District]]
* [[Zazesspur/High City/Market District|Market District]]
* [[Zazesspur/High City/Carpets District|Carpets District]]
* [[Zazesspur/High City/Ships' District|Ships' District]]

The Low City was not officially divided into districts; however, it still had two distinct regions or boroughs&mdash;the [[Zazesspur/Low City#The Fortress|The Fortress]] and [[Zazesspur/Low City#Karlaggar|Karlaggar]]. Karlaggar was a mercenaries' quarter. The Fortress was a sector full of smithies and warehouses.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />

==Defenses==
The walls of the city stood {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} high in some places. They had many gaps in them after the fall of the royal family during the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]]. 

Seven gates provided access into the city. Entering the High City were the [[Sea Gate (Zazesspur)|Sea Gate]] from the west, the [[Trade Gate]] from the north, the [[Dung Gate]] from northeast, and the [[South Gate (Zazesspur)|South Gate]] south. [[Karlag's Gate]] and the [[Hill Gate]] entered the Low City, while the remaining "gate" was the port entrance to the river. All gates were [[wikipedia:Barbican|barbican]] style with two [[wikipedia:Portcullis|portcullises]]. All gates were guarded by at least six guards, who could sound alarms to summon more. They were open only during daylight hours.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />

==Government==
The city was ruled by a council of lords. and these had close connections with the [[Purple Hills Council]].

[[Slavery]] had been illegal in Zazesspur for generations. Prostitution was legal.

During the Interregnum, the city guard of Zazesspur bore [[crossbow]]s and [[bronze]] [[halberd]]s. They were uniformed in [[morion]]s and bronze [[cuirass]]es with puffy blue shirts and [[pantaloons]]. The city guard served the city council and were a separate entity from the city police.

==Trade==
Zazesspur was famous for its wool [[carpet]]s, furniture, and cabinets. In fact, some considered Zazesspur to export the finest woodcraft in all the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]]. The city imported grain and livestock from [[Darromar]]. Much of Zazesspur's food also came from the fertile [[Purple Hills]].

Tethyr's two major roads, the [[Trade Way]] and [[Ithal Road]], both connected with the city. Along with [[Myratma]] in the south, Zazesspur was one of Tethyr's two largest ports.

In [[1357 DR]], the [[gold coin]] minted by Zazesspur, the ''[[gulder]]'', was the most valuable gold coin in Tethyr; 100 [[Amn]]ian ''[[danter]]s'' would exchange for 107 ''gulders''.

Primarily because of its trade with a small tribe from the eastern [[Starspire Mountains]], Zazesspur was one of the few places in Tethyr where [[dwarves]] might actually be encountered in the mid-1300s [[DR]].

===Guilds===
Many guilds operated with the city, among them:
; The Hostlers and Stablehands Guild : This guild represented those who worked in inns and stables. Their colors were green and blue.
; The Jesters, Fools, and Harlequins Guild : This guild represented those who worked in the comedic entertainment industry. They had a mix of many colors.
; The Taverners, Innkeepers, and Provisioners : This guild represented those who worked in inns, taverns, and provisioner's shops. Their colors were green and brown.

==Religion==
[[Sune]] was a favored deity within the city.

==History==
In ancient past, the area now occupied by Zazesspur was above major regions of [[Old Shanatar]]. Specifically, the catacombs of Zazesspur were once the subterranean city of [[Ultoksurllur]], which served as the capital of the [[Sondarr|Seastar Kingdom of Sondarr]], one of the eight subkingdoms of [[Deep Shanatar]]. Clan Ghalmrin then dwelled in Ultoksurllur. The dwarves built a surface city there as well; the name is forgotten, but evidence of dwarven stonework still remained in some of Zazesspur's roads and ramparts.<ref name=LoI1-T-p21>

The city was first settled by [[Calishite]] [[human]]s as a fishing village. In {{Yearlink|-1570}}, it became a fortified city and the seat of the Calishite [[Emir]] of Tethyr,<ref name=EotSS-p17 /><ref name=LoI1-T-p23> whose palace was placed in the city's center.<ref name=LoI1-T-p23 /> At this point, the entire city was located south of the Sulduskoon River, in what would later be considered the Low City. The [[Forest of Tethir]] then bordered the river, and so the [[elves]] controlled the northern shore.<ref name=LoI1-T-p23 /> In {{Yearlink|-1320}}, slaves built the Trade Way from Zazesspur to [[Memnon]]. 20 years later, a road was begun heading east. 200 years later, in {{Yearlink|-1130}}, it finally reached what would later become [[Ithal Pass]] at the fortress of [[Akkabbel]].<ref name=LoI1-T-p23 />

In the {{YearlinkName|-387}}, Zazesspur was conquered by [[Tethyrian]] [[barbarian]]s<ref name=LoI1-T-p24> from the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]] and the [[Purple Hills]].<ref name=LoI1-T-p24 /> Calimshan maintained troops there for a time, but in the {{YearlinkName|-315}}, after a short siege, it was conquered and taken over by the Tethyrian tribes and renamed '''Fort Karlag''', after [[Karlag|their warlord]].<ref name=LoI1-T-p24 />

Before the start of the [[Shoon Imperium]], in the {{YearlinkName|-5}} King [[Amahl Shoon I]] restored the city's name to Zazesspur and constructed a new palace and court there, making Zazesspur the capital of the kingdom.<ref name=LoI1-T-p24 />

After the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], the population of Zazesspur increased because of large numbers of refugees from the region around [[Castle Tethyr]]. The population and prestige of Zazesspur then began to decline with the establishment of [[Darromar]] as the new capital of the kingdom under Queen [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda]] and King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Haedrak]]. The citizens were not fond of their change in societal status in the country.

==Notable Locations==
; [[City Hall (Zazesspur)|City Hall]] : The chief administrative building for the Council of Lords.{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|16}}
; [[Dung Gate]] : A breach in the outer wall of the city.
; [[Palace of Governance]] : A civic building constructed in the city's center during the Interregnum.
; [[Smiling Centaur]] : A tavern in the city.
; [[Street of the Seamstresses]] : A street known for its brothels.
; [[Thread-Biters' Lane]] : A street once known for its brothels.

==Inhabitants==
The city did not have as large a population of spellcasters as one might expect for a city of its size. [[Wizard]]s coming from [[Amn]] in the north usually continued on to [[Calimshan]] in the south, expecting higher sources of income and greater comforts in that country.
===Notable Inhabitants===
*[[Andred Kuroone]], a [[thael leaf]] merchant in the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-1-6 - Andred Kuroone, Lurandural Veltree, Jhalanavress Tanthavur, and Orstrar Galannavruk}}
*[[Joysarra]], a famed courtesan who was the inspiration for ''[[Lady of the Haunting Eyes]]'', a popular ballad.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205715/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Apr – Jun 2006| accessdate = 28-10-2024| date = 28-10-2024}}

==Rumors & Legends==
During the Interregnum, some of the locals believed that "black [[galley]]s", [[Zhentarim]] [[Slavery|slave]] ships, carried off children in the night from docks hidden within Zazesspur's catacombs.

==Trivia==
Male and female prostitutes were known as "notch-tooths" within the city, because they used to work on Thread-Biters' Lane.
