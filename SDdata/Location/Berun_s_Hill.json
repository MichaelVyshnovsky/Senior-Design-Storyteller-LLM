        "mainbody": "Beruns Hill was a  bare-topped, conical hill that commanded a splendid view of the valley of the Dessarin River to the east.\nThe hill was used as a lookout for advancing barbarians and orc hordes from north and east. The hill got its name from the ranger Berun. He was slain by an orc horde but managed to take 300 tuskers with him, before they overwhelmed him.\nIn 1351 DR, a group of fifty dwarven priests of Marthammor Duin discovered the dwarven tomb that had long been talked about in legends of the North. They found that this cavernous crypt belonged to none other than Maegar, of the Royal House of the Helm of Gharraghaur, and that it had been plundered long ago by duergar.\nLegend tells that under the hill lay the grave of an ancient dwarf with rich golden armor and treasures, but none ever found it."
