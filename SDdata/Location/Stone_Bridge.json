        "mainbody": "Stone Bridge was a bridge located along the River Dessarin, connecting Red Larch and the Long Road via the Stone Trail to Beliard on Jundars Pass, and the High Forest.\nThe bridge, which was also a temple to Moradin, was a single arch,  in length and  in height, made of granite, roughly six paces wide, with no railings or barriers. It was originally built to connect the two halves of the realm of Besilmer, and was wide enough to cope with the broadest flow of the river in times of flooding.\nAs of the , it was a site of pilgrimage for dwarves of certain moral outlook.\nStone Bridge was originally constructed to link the ancient Halls of the Hunting Axe to another long-lost dwarfhold.\nThe bridge was the site of a fight between Torhild Flametongue, founder of the dwarven realm of Besilmer, and a hill giant, resulting in Torhilds death.\nDuring the final days of the Ironstar clan of dwarves, their king, Daurvos Frostbeard, was cut down on the bridge by orcs while the clan was attempting to flee south. While mortally wounded, he cried to Moradin for aid and died. Moradins avatar, a  armored dwarf, appeared on the bridge, rallying the fleeing dwarves and leading them to victory over the orcs.\nLegends claimed that the avatar of Moradin fell down onto the Stone Bridge at the start of the Time of Troubles. He was said to have guarded the walkway, in order to bar a number of malevolent deities from reaching the Celestial Stairway that had appeared in Waterdeep."
