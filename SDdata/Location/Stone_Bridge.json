        "Description": "The bridge, which was also a temple to [[Moradin]], was a single arch, {{SI|2|mi|k|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|400|ft|long=yes}} in height, made of [[granite]], roughly six paces wide, with no railings or barriers. It was originally built to connect the two halves of the realm of [[Besilmer]], and was wide enough to cope with the broadest flow of the river in times of flooding.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, it was a site of [[pilgrim]]age for dwarves of certain [[lawful good|moral outlook]].",
        "History": "Stone Bridge was originally constructed to link the ancient [[Halls of the Hunting Axe]] to another long-lost dwarfhold.\n\nThe bridge was the site of a fight between [[Torhild Flametongue]], founder of the dwarven realm of [[Besilmer]], and a [[hill giant]], resulting in Torhild's death.\n\nDuring the final days of the [[Ironstar]] clan of dwarves, their king, [[Daurvos Frostbeard]], was cut down on the bridge by [[orc]]s while the clan was attempting to flee south. While mortally wounded, he cried to Moradin for aid and died. Moradin's avatar, a {{SIAdj|20|ft|adj=high}} armored dwarf, appeared on the bridge, rallying the fleeing dwarves and leading them to victory over the orcs.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Legends claimed that the avatar of Moradin fell down onto the Stone Bridge at the start of the [[Time of Troubles]]. He was said to have guarded the walkway, in order to bar a number of malevolent deities from reaching the [[Celestial Stairway]] that had appeared in [[Waterdeep]]."
