Lands south of the Small Teeth belong to the [[Swordbelt]]. So it is assumed that the word ''all'' was misused on his part.",
        "Geography": "Encompassing the lands of Amn between the [[Sea of Swords]] and the Trade Way, Zehoarastria was named for the swampy [[Zehoarast Floodplains|floodplains]] found within its territory. The infamous traveler and author [[Volothamp Geddarm]] postulated that Zehoarastria would have been one enormous city were it not for the presence of the swamp.",
