Idyllglen was a settlement in Faer√ªn that was the target of multiple gnoll attacks. Their final assault upon the city was pivotal in the events that led to the fall of Zariel.
In the citys distant past, it was constantly threatened by neighboring gnoll tribes. The towns cleric Solndor Brightstar led the population in prayer to Lathander for help. The deity, moved by the townsfolks bravery, sent the then-solar Zariel to their aid. With the angels help, the gnolls were driven away.
Some time later, the gnolls attacked again, personally led by Yeenoghu and aided by demons. Zariel led the Hellriders to fight the demons, banishing Yeenoghu.
