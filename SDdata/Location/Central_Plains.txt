The '''Central Plains''' was a more-temperate region of [[Rashemen]] in the center of the cold and inhospitable country. It housed a scattering of homesteads of the [[Rashemaar]] people.

==Description==
The atmosphere of the plains varied wildly depending on the time of year. Its beautiful was highlighted by vibrant wildflowers during the summer months, contrasted with the bare, snow-covered scenery that appeared in winter.

==Geography==
===Flora & Fauna===
Like the weather, the various species of animals that appeared in the plains differed greatly depending on the season. During the warm months all manner of critters such as [[mice]] and [[vole]]s ran across the grassy plains, along with predatory animals like [[foxes]], [[coyote]]s and [[wolverine]]s.

During the coldest time of year, droves of [[reindeer]] and [[caribou]] journeyed across the snow, drawing out [[wolves]] from the nearby [[High Country]]. On rare occasions, [[ice troll]]s and even [[white dragon]]s ventured down from the cold peaks to raid the [[human]] settlements.
