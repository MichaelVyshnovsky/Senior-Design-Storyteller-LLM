Akota was the name of a small city found in west Zakhara.
Akota was sandwiched by the Range of the Marching Camels in the north and al-Suqut Mountains in the south. It was found southwest of the mighty High Desert along the coast of the Bahr al-Kibar where the caravan route from Tajar ended.
Akota exported gold, slaves, wood, and exotic goods to the Land of Fate through an overland trade route crossing the southern High Desert to the city of Tajar. Many inhabitants would speak the language Akotan next to Midani, acquired through their trade contacts with the country of Akota beyond Zakhara.
