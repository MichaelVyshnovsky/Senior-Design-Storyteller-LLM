'''Lothen''', called the '''City of the Silver Spires''', and later known as simply '''Lothen of the Silver Spires''', was a city of the ancient [[sun elf]] realm of [[Siluvanede]] (founded c. {{Yearlink|-8400}}).

==Geography==
The city once stood at the southern boundary of Siluvanede, amidst the great [[High Forest]], at a time when it was much larger in extent. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was located in the western side of the High Forest. It wasn't very far from the [[dwarf]] ruin known as the [[Hall of Four Ghosts]], though maps placed it just south of the [[River Dessarin]], east of the [[Lost Peaks]].<ref>

==History==
Lothen was once known as a center of study in Siluvanede.

The city survived the [[Seven Citadels' War]] and was annexed by [[Eaerlann]] at the war's conclusion ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-4300}}, when Siluvanede became a vassal realm.

By around the 3{{rd}} century DR, the city still stood and was known as Lothen of the Silver Spires. It was recorded as a contemporary of the [[human]] kingdom of [[Athalantar]] ([[183 DR|183]]–[[342 DR]]). At the time, it was the only place in all of Siluvanede where other races were permitted. People of all races came here to consult the [[Aeltagarr]], the most senior [[sorceress]] of the realm and a kindly and revered seer.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|34-35}}

Finally, in the [[882 DR|Year of the Curse, 882 DR]], [[demon]]s surged out of [[Hellgate Keep]], overrunning Eaerlann and causing its collapse. The demon hordes ravaged the High Forest, though they never reached the Siluvanedenn city of Lothen.

The still-standing but ruined city was later overrun by [[orc]]s. They were well-established there by the mid–14{{th}} century DR.

Following their escape from Hellgate Keep in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], the [[daemonfey]] members of [[House Dlardrageth]], including [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] and her sons, took refuge in a secret lair beneath Lothen. From this base, they sought out surviving and imprisoned [[fey'ri]] allies, in recovering old caches of weaponry and [[magic]], and spying on the elves of the [[North]]. They largely abandoned this base when they relocated to [[Myth Glaurach]] in the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]

==Inhabitants==
By [[1372 DR]], the city was home to orcs of the [[Horned Lord (tribe)|Horned Lord]], [[Sharpspike]], and [[Tanglethorn]] tribes. These orcs were worshipers of [[Malar]], the Beastlord, and their leaders were vicious [[ranger]]s and [[druids]]. These tribes were the strongest orc community surviving in the High Forest.

==Description==
Magnificent at its height, Lothen was built from silvery stone with tall and slender towers. Though these towers yet stood firm, the city had long lain in ruins by the 14{{th}} century DR.

==Locations==
By the early 1370s DR, orc [[druid]]s had rededicated some of the old elven temples to Malar.

Deep beneath Lothen were a number of long-forgotten but still intact conjuring chambers. House Dlardrageth occupied these rooms and turned them into a stronghold in 1369 DR.
