        "mainbody": "Maatar was an artificially created, Zhentarim-controlled oasis located in the Anauroch desert. \nMaatar housed a number of stone structures that served as fortified barracks, beneath which were tunnels that stored an arsenal of supplies, weapons, and magical armaments.\nIt was said to be a bountiful oasis that was rich with vegetation including nut-producing trees, and its underground tunnels harbored a small mushroom farm containing fine frill-collars that were used for Zhent alchemy.\nThe isolated outpost was located on the western stretch of the Sword, west of the Wall of Fallen Djinn mountains, possibly along the Black Road.\nIt was protected by a stone wall that was manned by Zhentilar soldiers.\nAs of the midâ€“14 century DR, the settlement had a meager contingent of sixteen Zhentilar troops, served by three priests and led by a sole Zhentarim wizard.\nThe Zhentarim collected a large reserve of weapons and skeletons in the garrison of Maatar, the latter of which were animated into a small horde of undead to serve under their command."
