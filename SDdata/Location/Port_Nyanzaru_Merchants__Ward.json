        "mainbody": "The Merchants Ward of Port Nyanzaru, Chult was home both to many temples and to the grand villa estates of the citys merchant princes. As such, it was considered the citys upper-class district.\nThe Merchants Ward comprised the western half of the walled portion of Port Nyanzaru, abutting the Harbor Ward to the east. The southern portion of the ward was an open space dominated by the Grand Souk, a huge covered marketplace. Much of the rest of the Merchants Ward was built on and around two steep hills Temple Hill to the north and Throne Hill in the center if the ward. A wide stone bridge atop arched columns connected the tops of these two hills, while a second bridge spanned above the Grand Souk to connect the hilltop to the slopes of the southern mountain overlooking the city, where several merchant princes villas were located. Access to these hilltops was restricted by walls and gates.\nThe ward was characterized by decorative banners and elaborate stonework.\nGoldenthrone This magnificent palace served as the meeting place and audience chamber for the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru. It was situated atop Throne Hill.\nGrand Souk This bustling emporium was one of the three great mercantile centers of the city.\nJewel Market A more exclusive twin of the Grand Souk where Chultan gemstones were bought and sold. It sat at the base of Throne Hill.\nTemple of Gond The house of the Wonderbringer was popular among the citys artisans, crafters and engineers. It sat at the base of Temple Hill.\nTemple of Savras This holy house of Savras was perhaps the most magnificent building in all of Port Nyanzaru. It sat at the top of Temple Hill.\nTemple of Sune Located on a small islet off the coast, this holy house was only accessible on foot by means of an elevated stone bridge from Temple Hill.\nDespite its name, most merchants in Port Nyanzaru could not afford to live in the Merchants Ward (and instead made their homes in the Market Ward). Instead, the Merchants Ward was home to the citys wealthiest citizens."
