'''Pazar''' was a city in the kingdom of [[Bakar]], abandoned after the [[river Athis]] dried out.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|36}} The [[Star of Aga-Pelar]] was secreted away in the [[Temple of Eilish]] in the city, used to trap the [[efreet]] [[Khalitharius]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|39}}

==Background==
Pazar was constructed on an island within the River Athis. The white rock of the island was excavated as the city grew, exposing more limestone to the flow of the river. Entire blocks of the city had begun to sink by the time the city fathers decided to use powerful spells to reinforce the foundations; when the river dried and the city was abandoned, these spells eventually faltered, leading to the entire city being swallowed up into the empty spaces of the limestone.

Around the late 3{{rd}} century DR, Princess [[Sithal Al-Husn]] of Pazar was married to [[Athis Al-Din]] of Akhir, but she was kidnapped on her wedding night by [[Habrauk Al-Nirin]] of the Al-Alisk clan. This unleashed a blood feud that lasted for five generations, until by the year {{yearlink|370}} DR, the bloodlines of Pazar, Akhir, and the Al-Alisk clan were all extinguished both by the fighting and the Curse of Amun-Re.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}}<ref group="note">Martek's final preparations involved spiriting away the city of Akhir and the Crypt of Al-Alisk to a subdimensional bubble, and they were complete no sooner than 370 DR. Thus, the feud must've finished sometime before that year and started 65-110 years before then.

The last administrator to leave, [[Kalif Maniozimus]], had a statue to himself erected on top of the [[Temple of Eilish]].

==Imprisoning of Khalitharius and Prophecy==
After Khalitharius rampaged through Raurin with the [[Malatath]], he was stopped by the archmage [[Martek]]. The wizard created a lead box to use as the efreet's prison, and set the Star of Aga-Pelar, a gem of inestimable beauty, to function as a stopper. However, the prison would only hold for a thousand years. Vizier Martek secreted the prison in the Temple of Eilish, and made sure only the most determined could release the efreet by placing mighty magic to guard the prison.

By using the Star of Aga-Pelar as a stopper for the prison and prophesizing the need for the gem later on, Martek sought to ensure that adventurers would release the efreet a thousand years later in the future. The wizard was positive Khalitharius would resume the rampage rather than return to their home plane, thus leaving themselves vulnerable to Martek returning as well to use their full power in order to bind them for good.

In {{yearlink|1356}}, adventurers employed by Aman Al-Raqib removed the Star of Aga-Pelar, accidentally releasing [[Khalitharius]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|17}}

==Statue of Maniozimus==
The only structure of note visible in the city as of the mid-14{{th}} century DR was the statue of Maniozimus, half-buried to its chest in sand, visible from {{SI|10|miles|long=yes}} away.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}} It held a tablet, where it was written that the city had once been great.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|37}} The structure under the statue was the [[Temple of Eilish]], which had actually sunk into the ground after the drying of the Athis.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|36}}
