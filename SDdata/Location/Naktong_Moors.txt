The '''Naktong Moors''' were a tract of moorland in the land of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. They lay west of the settlement of [[Konang Pen]].<ref group="note">Like many sites in Koryo, the Naktong Moors share a name with a real-world counterpart: [[Wikipedia:Nakdong River|Nakdong River]], also written as "Naktong", in Korea.

==Trade==
Local folk from Konang Pen dug peat out of the moor to use as fuel.

==Inhabitants==
It was said that [[magical beast]]s dwelled upon the moors, including [[unicorn]]s and the notorious [[s'domo rhan]], a giant beetle that could disguise itself as a beautiful woman. There were [[undead]], too, such as [[zombie]]s and [[mummy|peat mummies]] that had been preserved in the bogs.

==History==
[[Huat Rhu]], the famed general of [[Koguryo]], once led his soldiers on an expedition into the Naktong Moors. They never returned. By the 14th century [[DR]], it was rumored they still wandered the moors, now as peat mummies and zombies hunting for fresh blood.
