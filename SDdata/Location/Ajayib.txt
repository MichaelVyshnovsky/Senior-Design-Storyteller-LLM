'''Ajayib''', also called the "'''City of Wonders'''", was the youngest of [[Zakhara]]'s [[Pearl Cities]], and its most westerly. Beyond it lay the wilderness of [[al-Suqut Mountains]].

==Geography==
Located along the western coast of the [[Crowded Sea]] along the banks of [[Al-Malja River]], Ajayib was both the southernmost and westernmost of the major Pearl Cities.

==Trade==
The source of Ajayib's wealth was cultivated on the steep hills which rose above the city. Though famous for their splendid [[coffee]], Ajayib also exported fruits, [[frankincense]], and other aromatic [[resin|gums]]. The productions of bright [[dye]]s was also a major portion of their trade dealings. 

==History==
Ajayib was the youngest of the great Pearl Cities, having only established an [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]] mosque in [[1357 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Inhabitants==
Natives of Ajayib were proud to live on the frontier. They were generally independent, strong-willed, and opinionated.

[[Halima al-Wahsi]] was the Calipha of Ajayib in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Defenses==
The city guard of Ajayib numbered 8,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry. The Calipha personally commanded an elite unit of [[farisan]] that numbered 300 soldiers. Ajayib's navy numbered six ships used to combat pirates and western raiders. 

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that Ajayib was built upon the foundation of a much older city. The ancient settlement was supposedly carved into the cliffs shadowing Ajayib. A series of caves could be found in these cliffs, and though they were looted generations ago, many believed that Ajayib's savage ancestors still prowled the dark caverns.
