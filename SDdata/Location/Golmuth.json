After its destruction, it lay in the Selmal Basin beneath the waters of the Vilhon Reach.\nGolmuth was founded in  as the fifth of Jhaamdaths cities, preceded the same year by nearby Gharrent.\nIn the , Jhaamdath began aggressively deforesting the Chondalwood and slaying the elves of Nikerymath. The elven response in the  was a High Magic ritual that caused a great wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the Cities of the Sword and destroy the aggressors. Golmuth remained a sunken ruin hidden beneath the water, with its many lost psionic artifacts slowly affecting the nearby environment.\nThe sunken ruins of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by the lower sea levels that followed the Spellplague in 1385 DR, becoming the Vilhon Wilds. They were then returned to obscurity by the Great Rain and Second Sundering in 1486 DR."
