        "Description": "The mine was a large mining complex. It's tunnels were usually {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in height and {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} tall. The tunnels of the upper parts of the mine were worn with age and often covered in a layer of dust. The tunnels found in the lower parts of the mine better maintained. Meandering irregular circular tunnels with smooth walls were found here.",
        "Geography": "The mine was located in the eastern part of [[Bloodstone Pass]]. It's three entrances were found within a high canyon."
