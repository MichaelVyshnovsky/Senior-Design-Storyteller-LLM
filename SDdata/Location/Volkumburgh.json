But in ''The Shattered Statue'', it was stated that the temple is south of the village. Northeast of the village was a set of ruins known as the [[High Pasture]].",
        "Trade": "Volkumburgh was a herding village, their primary trade good being [[sheep]] and the wool they grew.",
        "History": "Founded in [[999 DR]],\n\nIn the mid-12{{th}} century [[DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}} King [[Proster Obarskyr]] ordered Volkumburgh's [[College of Shaping Magics]] to construct a new breed of [[stone golem]]s, designed to help expedite his building projects. In later centuries, this information could only be found in a single obscure government document in [[Suzail]].\n\nLater that same year Volkumburgh Vale was sacked by [[Awtawmatawn|that same golem]], leading to the destruction of both the magic colleges within it. Lord Volkumburgh's treasure was known to the inhabitants of his village, though its location was not. Over time it would come to be known as \"Volki's treasure.\"\n\nLord Volkumburgh's manor would be rebuilt as the [[Crimson Wyrm]], while the rest of its remains were used to construct the small village. Later, some man would approach the lord and task him with hiding one of the golem's hands within the village, which he tucked away beneath its fountain.\n\n{{Quote|Long ago a stranger brought a giant stone hand to lord Volkumburgh and said that he must hide it, for others would come to find it. Legend says that Lord Volkumburgh buried the hand and his vast treasure with soft earth, fine stone and deep water.|''A local Volkumburgh legend''}}\n\nOver the two centuries that followed their destruction, the residents of Volkumburgh would loot the ruins of the valley's colleges for valuables to either keep or sell. Many even considered it a right of passage to loot something sellable from the ruins.\n\nDuring the [[Flight of the Dragons]], an adult [[red dragon]] by the name of [[Flashfire]] emigrated from the north, eventually coming to settle within the abandoned Temple of the Dragon Oracle in [[1358 DR]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"YearConfusion\">Page 16 of ''The Shattered Statue'' states that Flashfire, \"...came south several years ago in the dragon invasion that destroyed the city of [[Phlan]] on the shores of the [[Moonsea]].\" Describing the event known as the Flight of the Dragon, which occurred in 1356 DR. However, that page also states that Flashfire only moved into the Temple of the Dragon Oracle recently. For more information on this, see Note 1. He went on to force knowledge of the temple's location upon the inhabitants of Volkumburgh, demanding they bring him a monthly tribute in the form of five sheep. Though, even when this tribute was paid, Flashfire's [[gargoyle]] minions would still sometimes terrorize Volkumburgh Vale,\n\nIn 1358 DR,{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} the [[wizard]] [[Amelior Amanitas]] set up a workshop in the village in the form of a huge tower, as well as some fragments of it<ref> that he managed to merge back together into an arm through use of [[potion]]s. Amelior's efforts to reconstruct the golem attracted the attention of the devout followers of Valmous and their [[neanderthal]] allies, who occupied the college ruins and kept the villagers from getting into them.\n\nAs a result of this, over time the Awtawmatawn, the ruins of the magical colleges, Amelior Amanitas, and the arm he found all became taboo topics in the village. Amelior later discovered one of the statue's feet in a temple in [[Suzail]], which locals mistakenly believed to be a piece of [[Grumbar]]. In the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]], some time before the [[Feast of the Moon]], he arranged for the foot to be shrunken down, stolen, and then delivered to him by a group of [[adventurer]]s in Suzail. Estimating where the other fragments might be, he then tasked them with seeking out the rest of the fragments. \n\nThose adventurers went on to recover one of the golem's lost hands, hidden beneath a fountain in the village. The discovery of this hand led many villagers to conclude that Volki's treasure had to be hidden somewhere in the village. Thus they proceeded to dig many pits and trenches within the village green.\n\nA few days after the collected parts were turned in to Amelior, the awakened Valmous and his disciples attacked the village alongside an army of neanderthals, seeking to destroy the Awtawmatawn. At the same time, Lychor unleashed a counter-force of [[undead]] in hopes of both protecting the golem and claiming it for himself. This horde of undead included a hundred [[skeleton]]s, twenty [[zombie]]s, and ten [[wight]]s. During this siege Awtawmatawn finally awakened and began to rampage around Volkumburg, destroying Amelior's workshop in the process. Both armies, as well as everyone else in the village, stopped to gawk as this occurred. Lychor then used the distraction to cast a deadly spell on Valmous and those around him, putting him out of action for the rest of the battle.\n\nAmelior would gift the adventurers a number of [[magic item]]s to aid them in the battle. These included [[brass]] bottles containing his two loyal [[ogre]] servants and the [[djinn]] [[Hasan (djinn)|Hasan]], a brass bottle that unleashed a [[ballista]] with twenty bolts that was manned by four zombies, three [[Potion of growth|''potions of growth'']], three [[Potion of giant strength|''potions of giant strength'']],\n\nAs of [[1369 DR]], the Crimson Wyrm had been repaired and Volkumburgh was still a rustic village of miners and sheep farmers.",
        "Inhabitants": "Despite being very isolated from the rest of [[interior Faerûn]], the inhabitants of Volkumburgh were relatively friendly and very open with strangers. Though they would fall silent whenever one of their taboo topics came up. Any attempt to threaten them into speaking of those taboos would make them more stoic and standoffish.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Amelior's workshop]]\n* [[Crimson Wyrm]], the town's tavern and inn."
