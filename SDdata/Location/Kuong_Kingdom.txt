The '''Kuong Kingdom''', or simply '''the Kuong''', was the southernmost nation in [[Malatra]], lying amidst the dense jungles of southern [[Kara-Tur]]. It was home to the [[Kuong]] people.{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|62-63}} With its priest-kings wielding absolute power in civil and religious matters, it was a theocratic empire dedicated to the [[Lords of Creation]] that dominated the Jungle Lands with expansion efforts and campaigns of conquest.

==Geography==
The Kuong Kingdom was bounded in the south and west by the [[Himasla Mountains]], bordered in the northwest and north by the empire of [[T'u Lung]] (along the [[Fenghsintzu River]]) and the [[Warring States]], and in the northeast by the [[Purang]] hill country and the kingdom of [[Laothan]].{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}<ref group="note">It's possible that the [[Warring States]], which occupy much the same area on the ''The Forgotten Realms Atlas'' and ''Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas'' maps, are a part of or else include the Kuong Kingdom. The traditional border with Laothan was marked by the ruins of the oft-fought-over fortress of [[Tua Koh]].

While the underlying terrain was largely hills and steep ridges, rising to high hill country in the south, this was blanketed all over by thick jungles, with regions characterized only by density. Medium-density jungle grew in the west, on both sides of the [[Kunong River]] basin (fed by the southern hills) and along the border with T'u Lung. Meanwhile, high-density jungle—the greatest in all Malatra—lay south of the [[Dwai River]] in a wide coastal strip that continued all the way south past the Himasla Mountains.

==Language==
The inhabitants spoke the [[Kuong language]]. Coming from a different linguistic stock to the [[Laothan language|Laothan]] and [[Purang language|Purang]] languages also spoken in Malatra, Kuong was distinctly unlike all other languages spoken in Kara-Tur. Because it was so unique, the Kuong people believed it to be specially blessed. However, most linguists observed that it was highly complex, followed no logic, and thought it weird. It was difficult to learn for even the most gifted minds.

==People==
The Kuong people were of similar race to the [[Purang people]], having brown skin and wavy black hair, and lacking epicanthic folds. Though they had more in common culturally with them and with the [[Seng]] of Laothan than with the northern nations of Kara-Tur, their national character was very different. The Kuong were known to be hospitable and hardworking, but also remarkably accepting of fate and obedient to their leaders and not doubting their caste system and hierarchy.

==Government==
An aggressive and expansionist empire, In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], Priest-King [[Vishnan VII]] ruled the Kuong Kingdom. His chief advisor was his dowager mother, Lady [[Natiya]], the leading member of the nobility.

Beneath the Priest-King was an aristocracy, comprising lesser nobles and the royal family, their ranking determined by their relationship to the Priest-King and thus to the divine. Naturally, members of the royal family were foremost and had the most influence in the kingdom. In any case, they had only what authority and power the Priest-King deigned to give them. Typically, they governed provinces and lesser districts, provided armies, and oversee civil projects like building temples and bridges. Appointments were made with a preference for those who had close links to the temples. The Priest-King personally chose those who would reign as satraps over outer territories and serve as generals over those armies.

Beneath them was a hereditary bureaucracy that managed the everyday matters of the kingdom. The Priest-King had the right to dismiss an irresponsible or incompetent bureaucrat and appoint a replacement; Vishnan VII did this often.

==Religion==
The faith of the [[Lords of Creation]] was the state religion of the theocracy of the Kuong Kingdom. It was not uncommon for worshipers to follow more than one deity in the pantheon, but Kuong [[monk]]s, [[shukenja]], and [[sohei]] notably followed only a single deity. However, Kuong followers of the Lords of Creation did not typically engage in philosophical considerations and did not place much value in respecting [[Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]]s. In fact, they were considered some of the most authoritarian and arbitrary believers of any faith in the Malatra region.

Extravagant temples dedicated to one or multiple Lords of Creation were found all across the Kuong Kingdom. Worship of the Lords of Creation and hosting celebrations were almost their only purposes. Meanwhile, a complex network of [[monasteries]] both trained priests and served as administrative centers for the kingdom.

Ecclesiastical matters were managed ultimately by the High Priest; in the mid–14{{th}} century DR, this was High Priest [[Malvaya]]. Officially, the church hierarchy had little say in the governing of the Kuong Kingdom, yet the influence of faith was felt in Kuong festivals, civil projects, and the favoring of nobles with temple links for appointment to certain positions. Moreover, the church was required to approve almost all areas of life. This led to bribery, extortion, and selling favors becoming rife and the jinyan crime families, though they still supported the temples.

==Economy==
The Kuong were masters of stonecutting and stone-carving, a talent testified to by the massive yet intricately carved stonework in their magnificent temple cities.

The land was also rich in minerals, giving the Kuong a great source of wealth. They mined [[gem]]s in the Akashnu Mountains and collected precious metals. However, they enjoyed jewelry made in southern Laothan.

Owing to the dense jungle, many villages practiced [[Wikipedia:Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and every ten to twenty years had to relocate to find and create fresh fertile farmland. They focused on growing tropical fruits and vegetables, rather than rice, which required building dams and waterways. These difficulties sparked the Kuong Kingdom's desire for the agriculturally well-developed lands of Laothan.

==Relations==
Being surrounded by dense jungles and fierce tribes, the Malatran nations were protected from most external threats but also constrained and trapped together. Through their shared history, the Kuong, the Seng, and the Purang had long fought one another and several times pushed their borders back and forth. Among them, the Kuong Kingdom was the most dominant politically and took an imperialistic and aggressive approach. Many Kuong viewed their neighbors as barbarians and uncivilized.

The Kuong Kingdom coveted the fertile agricultural lands of Laothan and desired northern expansion and conquest. It had spies in King Thok Lian's court keeping the priest-king apprised of Seng troubles and in 1357 DR was laying the groundwork for a surprise invasion.

Similarly, the Kuong Kingdom once tried to annex the Purang hill tribes, but struggled against their guerilla tactics; the Purang excelled at hit-and-run attacks and resisted being drawn into battle. The Kuong could not gain a foothold and suffered losses, and finally gave up on conquering the hill country.

The Kuong Kingdom's other important neighbor was the empire of T'u Lung. As a show of strength, the Kuong built fortresses along the border, by the Fenghsintzu and Kunong Rivers. However, for its part, T'u Lung displayed little interest in marching over the border.

==Culture==
Kuong clothes were made of light silks and gauzy fabrics, and men and women both wore sarongs and brightly colored billowing [[trousers]], as well as a variety of [[gold]] and [[silver]] jewelry.

Settlements in the Kuong Kingdom were centered around temples and government buildings. In the villages, most of the buildings were constructed of [[bamboo]] and palm leaves woven together. These were raised off the ground on stilts in order to keep the floor dry during the rainy and flood seasons and for protection from insects and wild animals. Meanwhile, in the towns and cities, the majority of buildings—namely the houses and palaces of the wealthy, important public buildings, defensive walls, fortresses, and most businesses—were built of stone, so that they might stand forever alongside the reign of the priest-kings. The stone was quarried locally where available but usually hauled great distances. Their exterior surfaces were always carved and occasionally even painted or inset with [[gem]]s and precious stones, displaying historical events, Kuong legends, and the Lords of Creation. Temples and government buildings were the most intricate and extravagant, while defensive walls and fortresses were quite impressive.

Wealthy Kuong could have multiple wives and consorts in their households.

==Society==
Despite Kuong respect for authority, They were known as "jinyan" (called [[yakuza]] elsewhere). The strongest jinyan family was the [[Jarvatya]], based in the capital of Ranguri.

Use of [[magic]] was strictly the preserve of the priesthood, as it was believed only those devoted to the Lords of Creation had the wisdom to use [[magic]] properly. The only [[wu jen]] allowed were also practicing priests, whether [[monk]]s, [[shukenja]]s, or [[sohei]]. Otherwise, all magic-users acting outside the priesthood were seen as abominations and evil-doers, hated and feared by all, and they were hunted down and impaled in public. Needless to say, such wu jen were barely known of within the Kuong Kingdom, but it was thought they learned their art in secret from the wu jen priests and identified each other via secret passwords, symbols, and talismans. Thus [[witch hunter]]s were active here.

Among the warriors, [[singh rager]]s were especially well known.

==History==
===Early History===
[[File:Kuong ruins.jpg|250px|thumb|''The ruins of a Kuong city, overgrown by the Malatran jungle.'']]
In Kuong belief, after the [[Lords of Creation]] made Malatra, the god [[Yama]] populated the land with animals and peoples he had created. Thereafter, with great interest, he monitored their development. Early on in its history, Malatra was reigned over by Yama's near-[[demigod]]s, but over the centuries they declined in power and stature. In time, their descendants became the ordinary humans of Malatra. The Kuong most firmly recalled this point, and maintained that the direct descendants of the Lords of Creation were, naturally, their divine priest-kings.

The Kuong Kingdom arose in the Akashnu Mountains, founded by [[Vishnan I]] with the ancient city of Suranatra as its capital. From the outset, it was an aggressive and theocratic empire. Funded by the gems and precious metals of the Akashnu Mountains, the rich and puissant priest-kings of Suranatra expanded their dominion to the Kunong River and to the coast.

Eventually, to better administrate this greater territory, the priest-kings were forced to relocate their capital to Parmahana.No local calendar is given for the Kuong Kingdom or Malatra, so estimated dates are presented in the standard [[Dalereckoning]] for consistency and clarity, despite this calendar most likely not being known in the Kuong Kingdom. This event is "over 600 years" before a setting date of 1357 DR, so some time before [[757 DR]]. the Kuong deserted Parmahana, leaving much behind.The reason for abandoning Parmahana is unknown. While it might be another shift for administrative ease, the description suggests a disaster of some kind, possibly disease. The people made an exodus through the jungle, founding a temporary capital at [[Beradandar]], before moving on to the permanent capital at [[Ranguri]].

When Priest-King [[Vishnan IV]] discovered a spring that produced ''[[elixir of youth]]'', he established the temple and town of [[Durapatya]].This event is undated and unrelated to the larger history. It is placed here for convenience.

At one point, Kuong temple soldiers came across the ancient city of Visrana. In exploring the ruins, they inadvertently unleashed [[spectre]]s, [[nat (spirit)|nats]], and other things. A priest-king of the time forbade further exploration of the area.<ref group="note" name="unrelated"/>

From Ranguri, the priest-kings turned their attention north, conquering fresh territories and making their first incursion into the southern jungles of Laothan, the land of the divided Seng kingdoms. They even seized the important fortress city of [[Tua Koh]], which would pass back and forth between Seng and Kuong multiple times.This is "almost 200 years" before a setting date of 1357 DR, so some time after [[1157 DR]]. defended Laothan, and repelled the Kuong. The final siege and battle saw Tua Koh ruined.

Since then, the Kuong Kingdom focused on the jungles to the east and south of T'u Lung and, from around [[1300 DR]], apparently gave no thought to expanding northward.

===Modern History===
Hungry for its prosperous agricultural lands

In [[1356 DR]], a Kuong temple sohei tried to assassinate the great Seng wu jen [[Hueng]], master of a school of magic in the town of [[Deikhou]]. The attempt failed and the assassin died.

Moving covertly, the Kuong army of conquest began marching north in [[1357 DR]], going through the Purang hill country between [[Feng Nu]] and [[Lumpur]] and entering Laothan in secret. While the [[Blood Tree]] and [[Twisted Palm]] tribes were well aware of the army passing through their lands, the Kuong carefully avoided conflict and gave gifts to make up for the intrusion. The Purang tribe leaders were in various minds on whether to accept this. Meanwhile, the Kuong forces assembled at a secret camp in the jungle between Tua Koh and Kwang Tre. Once they'd mustered a sufficient force, the Kuong army planned to seize Kwang Tre, expecting an easy victory, then rush down the [[Phu River]] to surprise the capital [[Cheinang]] and strike a decisive blow against the Seng. However, the Kuong Kingdom had its own internal troubles: High Priest Malvaya invented reports of unrest at the border and covered up predictions by Kuong diviners that the army of conquest would suffer misfortune, as part of his own power play.
