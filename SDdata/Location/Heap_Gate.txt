The Heap Gate was a gate and local landmark in the city of Baldurs Gate. It was located in the region of the old wall that seperated the Upper City marketplace of the Wide from the Lower City district of Heapside.
It was one of the citys four, smaller "patriar gates" that connected the poorer Lower City to the affluent Upper City. Generally, these entrances were only accessible to select individuals, such as the citys wealthy patriar, those persons bearing their livery, or the powerful Kingpins that operated territory for the Guild.
