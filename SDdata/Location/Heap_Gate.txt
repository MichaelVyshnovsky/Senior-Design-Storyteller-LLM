The '''Heap Gate''' was a gate and local landmark in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was located in the region of the old wall that seperated the [[Upper City]] marketplace of [[the Wide]] from the [[Lower City]] district of [[Heapside]].

It was one of the city's four, smaller "[[patriar]] gates" that connected the poorer Lower City to the affluent Upper City. Generally, these entrances were only accessible to select individuals, such as the city's wealthy patriar, those persons bearing their livery, or the powerful [[Kingpin]]s that operated territory for [[the Guild]].
