            "Geographical Features": "The region was characterized by badlands, steep-sloped striated rock formations carved by the advancing and retreating of the [[Great Glacier]]. The rock of the area was distinctly reddish in color, varying from bright blood-red to dark purplish. The whole area was littered with massive boulders and fields of broken rocks and gravel.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "As a stretch of badlands, nothing of note grew in the area. \n\nThis region of central Vaasa had a reputation for being home to nothing but foul monsters. It was home to [[bulette]]s and [[chromatic dragons]] as well as many of the other cold-weather creatures common across northern Vaasa, including [[winter wolf|winter wolves]], [[glacier snake]]s, [[white pudding]]s, [[moon dog]]s, and [[yeti]]."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "As with most regions in Vaasa, [[goblinoids]] and [[giant|giantkin]] made their homes in the area. A tribe of [[fog giant]] nomads hunted in the Wastes and had found a way to tame the local bulettes."
