Axe Rock was a projecting crag of rock that travelers on the Evermoor Way used as a landmark.
Axe Rock was located on the north side of the Evermoor Way about two days travel southwest of Everlund.
A spring emerged from high up in the formidable rock formation, but ancient dwarven stonework guided the drinkable water down smoothly carved troughs and channels to a pond beside the road. The spring was still providing water as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
