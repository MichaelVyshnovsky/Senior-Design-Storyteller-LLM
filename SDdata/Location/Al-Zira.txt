Al-Zira, or the Arm, formed the large islands of the Djinnis Claws in the Crowded Sea southwest of mainland Zakhara. 
All kinds of genies could be found on the islands of Al-Zira. Marid enjoyed the warm coral lagoons, djinn flew through the air with the birds, and dao explored the rocky mountains.  The efreet were the only major form of genie not found on the island.
These islands were widely feared because they were believed to be owned by the marid.
