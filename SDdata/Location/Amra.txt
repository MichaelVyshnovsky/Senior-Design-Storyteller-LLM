'''Amra''' was an ancient [[human]] kingdom of [[Laerakond]].

==History==
According to old legends, one of the kings that ruled Amra centuries before the [[Spellplague]] was a [[dragonheir]]. This king made [[Gauwervyndhal]] promise that she or any other [[dragon]] would never attack the [[Sword Lands]].

Amra fell when the king was assassinated and the lords fought one another for the throne. Amra's castles and keeps were destroyed during the war.

==Legacy==
Even after Amra fell, no dragon attacked the Sword Lands ever since.
