The Valley of the Dogs was a forested valley between Harkwood and Weathercote Wood, in the Fallen Lands.
It was inhabited by two hobgoblin tribes called the Spittlemaws and Fistclenches. The two tribes were in a perpetual war over the area, though neither side could explain or remember why the valley was so important to them.
