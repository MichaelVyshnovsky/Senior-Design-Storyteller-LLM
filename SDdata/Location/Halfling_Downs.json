        "mainbody": "'''Halfling Downs''' was a particularly fertile stretch of land found in the [[Duchy of Carmathan]] in [[Damara]].",
        "Geography": "Halfling Downs was situated amidst rolling hills in the southeast corner of the duchy along the borders of [[Impiltur]] and the Barony of [[Ostel]]. It was nestled between [[Ravensburg]] and [[Zarach]].",
        "History": "For its size, Halfling Downs was one of the most productive farmlands throughout the [[Bloodstone Lands]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]],\n\nThe halflings of the region tolerated visitors but preferred to be left to themselves, until an incident with a rampaging [[bulette]] required the assistance of the [[Twilight Riders]] of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]]. and terrorized the region for many months before the Riders defeated the beast without a single casualty while passing through the area in {{Yearlink|1359}}. Their heroics did much to warm the people of Carmathan to the idea of accepting Bloodstoneâ€™s baron, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], as their potential future king.",
        "Inhabitants": "The farmland was inhabited primarily by [[tallfellow halfling]]s who prided themselves on hard work and tended to keep to themselves, A small population of [[human]] farmers also called the region home.\n\nA rowdy band of [[halfling]] [[adventurer]]s known as the [[Kneebreakers]] hailed from the Downs."
