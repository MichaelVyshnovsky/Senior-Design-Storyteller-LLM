It was nestled between Ravensburg and Zarach.\nFor its size, Halfling Downs was one of the most productive farmlands throughout the Bloodstone Lands as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR,\nThe halflings of the region tolerated visitors but preferred to be left to themselves, until an incident with a rampaging bulette required the assistance of the Twilight Riders of Bloodstone. and terrorized the region for many months before the Riders defeated the beast without a single casualty while passing through the area in . Their heroics did much to warm the people of Carmathan to the idea of accepting Bloodstoneâ€™s baron, Gareth Dragonsbane, as their potential future king.\nThe farmland was inhabited primarily by tallfellow halflings who prided themselves on hard work and tended to keep to themselves, A small population of human farmers also called the region home.\nA rowdy band of halfling adventurers known as the Kneebreakers hailed from the Downs."
