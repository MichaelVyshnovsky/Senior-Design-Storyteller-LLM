The Eyes of Silvanus were two islands, Ilighôn and Wavecrest, near the mouth of the Vilhon Reach on the Sea of Fallen Stars. The islands were formed from mountains when Jhaamdath was flooded.
After the Spellplague hit and the waters from the Sea of Fallen Stars receded, the islands were joined with mainland Turmish due to the lowered water level.
