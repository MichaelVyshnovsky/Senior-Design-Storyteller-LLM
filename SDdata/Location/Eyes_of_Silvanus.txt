The '''Eyes of Silvanus''' were two islands, [[Ilighôn]] and [[Wavecrest]], near the mouth of the [[Vilhon Reach]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The islands were formed from mountains when [[Jhaamdath]] was flooded.

After the [[Spellplague]] hit and the waters from the Sea of Fallen Stars receded, the islands were joined with mainland Turmish due to the lowered water level.
