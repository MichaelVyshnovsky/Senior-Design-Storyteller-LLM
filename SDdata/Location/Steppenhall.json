        "mainbody": "Steppenhall, also referred to as Little Narfell, was a small village and farming community located in the Duchy of Soravia in eastern Damara.\nSteppenhall sat along the winding banks of the Icelace River near its junction with the Galena Snake, making it an important staging point for re-routing goods to the rest of the duchy. It also served as an informal meeting ground and watering hole for farmers from all across northeastern Damara, from nearby villages by Kinnery or Merkum to places far to the north, like Hinterford or Newbelle\nIn the , Steppenhall hosted the army of Bloodstone, led by Olwen Forest-Friend, as they hunted down the last of Zhengyi the Witch-Kings occupying forces following the Bloodstone Wars. It was used as a staging point to strike against a hobgoblin threat that folk hoped could serve as a way to unite the peoples of Damara and Narfell.\nGiven the close proximity with Narfell, many inhabitants of Steppenhall maintained close relationships with Nar tribesmen. Some of the tribesmen, especially of the Var, even visited the village on a regular basis to hear the latest news of the region.\n* The Freezing Fox, a tavern run by the gentle Tremaine and his beautiful daughter Meg."
