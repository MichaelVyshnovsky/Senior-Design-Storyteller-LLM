}}'''Windless''' was a town in [[Bloodstone Valley]] in [[Damara]] founded in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The town lay within Bloodstone Valley several miles southeast of [[Bloodstone Village]]. It was set well off the main road.

==Government==
Windless lacked a formal government, leaving all major decisions in the hands of small council.

==History==
The town was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, following the [[Bloodstone Wars]], and was largely made up of folk looking to get away from the turmoil that had been invited upon [[Bloodstone Village]] first by the arrival of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] and later by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]].

==Inhabitants==
The folk of Windless considered their town to be a suburb of Bloodstone Village, and preferred to lead quieter lives away from the bustle of that settlement. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century, they were largely loyal to Gareth Dragonsbane, and many served in the [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] army and helped to garrison the nearby [[Damaran Gate]].
