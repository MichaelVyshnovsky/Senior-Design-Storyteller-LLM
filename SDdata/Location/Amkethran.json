        "mainbody": "'''Amkethran''' was a village embedded into an outcropping of rock located in the [[Calim Desert]] from its edge in [[Calimshan]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|[[Balthazar|He]] runs a monastic order in a remote village in the Calim Desert... it will serve to both hide you from retribution as well as serve as a base from which you can attack the enclaves of [[Abazigal]] and [[Sendai]].|Melissan to Gorion's Ward}}",
        "Geography": "Amkethran was partly built on several levels on a large rock. A large cave opening into the side of that rock was used as a cemetery, although when [[Gorion's Ward]]'s party arrived it was magically sealed off as the [[lich]] [[Vongoethe]] had taken temporary residence in it.\n\nThe village in the [[Calim Desert]] was several hundred miles southwest of [[Saradush]], with a direct path in-between through the heart of the [[Forest of Mir]] and passing the [[Marching Mountains]]. A safer, but longer, route between Saradush and Amkethran by horse was four days west along the [[Ithal Road]] then a day south at [[Darromar|Ithmong]], reaching the edge of the Calim Desert in two days after passing the western tip of the Forest of Mir. On horse, Amkethran appeared by the early afternoon since entering the desert.",
        "Government": "Although the village had a mayor, [[Omar Haraad]], his position was mainly in name only, owing to the oppressive forces of the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Balthazar]]. In [[1368 DR]], it was under the unofficial leadership of Balthazar, the leader of the local monastery. The village was in very bad shape, as its inhabitants lived in poverty and had to contend with Balthazar's mercenaries, who also lived there and did basically whatever they liked.",
        "Notable Locations": "The village had a tavern named the [[Zephir]], and a seller of powerful scrolls who had fled from [[Saradush]] had also set up shop there. The monastery of Amkethran was a courtyard with single thirty feet high white marble walls located at the east of the village. The monastery existed for generations before the birth of the village and its high walls provided shade to inhabitants of the hot desert. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the monastery monk population near went extinct because of the conflict of [[Bhaalspawn|Bhaalspawns]].",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "Notable inhabitants were:\n* [[Balthazar]]\n* [[Saemon Havarian]]\n* [[Regund]]\n* [[Lysus]]\n* ''Warrior monks''"
