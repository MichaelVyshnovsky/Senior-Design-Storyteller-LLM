        "History": "One of its founders was the master [[dragonrider]] [[Sharlario Moonflower]]. In the [[Year of Singing Sirens|Year of Singing Sirens,]] a huge orc horde threatened the city. The orcs were led by the demon [[Haeshkarr]]. At that time most, High Magi of Sharlarion were dead and only the [[archmage]] [[Kethryllia Amarillis]] was left to lead the defenders. All others died in a magical backslash when they were bonded with the circle of High Magis in [[Occidian]] during the city's destruction. Besides being an archmage, Kethryllia was also a good fighter, and two nights before the attack began she even managed to complete a mighty magical [[sword]], known as [[Dharasha]]. The second best defense of the city was at that time [[dragonrider]]s, but they were away in the south to hunt down two [[black dragon]]s. Only the archmage and the inhabitants could stand against the orc horde. But they managed to defeat them under heavy losses. Kethryllia even followed the demon into the [[Abyss]]. In doing this, she brought [[Faerûn]] to the attention of [[Lolth]].",
