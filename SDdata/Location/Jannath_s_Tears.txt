'''Jannath's Tears''' were a small chain of islands in the [[Sea of Swords]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}}

==Geography==
The islands were located between the [[Moonshae Isles]] to the west and [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]] to the east.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1052}}, High King [[Bayle Carrathal]] of the Moonshae Isles sent a small fleet to Jannath's Tears with the intent to annex the islands into his kingdom. His forces were sunk by the navy of Baldur's Gate, who came to the Tears' defense. Following this embarrassment, Bayle was deposed later that same year and replaced by [[Yolanda Carrathal]], grandniece of his father.
