        "mainbody": "Mulptan was the great trade city of Rashemen. It was one of the nations more cosmopolitan locales and was considered the \"Gateway\" to the lands of the north.\nThe vast, wind-battered city was encircled by a great stone wall, outside of which was its great trading field. The tents and and stalls found in mercantile marketplace were crowded with people of many different ethnicities and foreign nations.\nMulptan lay on the intersection of the Huhrongs Road and a long road that ran north-south through Rashemen. It was located  east of Immilmar, about five days south of the Falls of Erech, and three days east of the Ring of Blue Fire, as traveled by horseback.\nMulptans great trading fields drew foreign merchants and businesspeople from many nearby nations, including Damara and Impiltur.\nMany traders came to Mulptan from  the Long Road, a route that crossed the Endless Wastes from the Cold Lands and connected to Huhrongs Road.\nThe infrastructure of Mulptan predated the city itself, dating back to the ancient conflicts between Narfell and Raumathar.\n* Western Quarter, a region of Mulptan inhabited predominantly by folk from Damara or Thesk. Ironically it was located on the northeastern side of the city.\n* Shou Quarter, the southern district of the city that presumably housed many Shou people.\nMulptan was home to the Ydrass and Vrul Rashemaar clans, each of whom enjoyed an old and sometimes bloody rivalry with the other."
