Because it was only a few miles from the [[River Adder]], Luthcheq maintained its status as a maritime city.",
        "Culture": "Like most of Chessenta, Luthcheq had a martial culture that valued physical fitness and the military arts.  Prior to [[Tchazzar]]'s return in 1479 DR, [[mage]]s were persecuted and forced to live in their own ghetto.  At the urging of his adviser [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]], Tchazzar enacted laws protecting magic users.",
