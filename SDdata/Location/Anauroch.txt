'''Anauroch''' ({{Pronounce|ah|NOR|ach|refs=}} {{Pronounce|alt=yes|an|OAR|ock|h|refs=}} {{Pronounce|alt=yes|a|NAW|rock|refs=}} {{Pronounce|alt=yes|an|OAR|ock|refs=}}), or '''The Great Sand Sea''', was a magical desert in [[North Faerûn|northern Faerûn]]. It held the remnants of the once-powerful [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]], their flying enclaves having crashed to the ground when their greatest mage [[Karsus]], in a desperate bid to end the war against the [[phaerimm]], challenged the goddess [[Mystryl]] for her divine mantle, causing the [[Weave]] to falter and all magic to fail. For generations since, Anauroch, the greatest desert in Faerûn, encroached relentlessly on border nations, burying them beneath the sands.{{Fact}}

{{Quote|''"Desert, but not lifeless. Scorching hot by day, chill at night, but only dunes and hard plain in the south, where the Bedine swing their swords at you and play "I'm fiercer" with any intruder. Cold rock to the north, and more life than you'd think for a land so parched, with old, fell magic beneath your boots and the stony spires of ruins covered and then laid bare by the sands when storms howl, like old teeth sticking up from a buried jawbone.''|Anonymous [[Harper]] agent<ref>{{Cite web/geocities/Ed Says: Geography of the Realms}}}}

==Geography==
The northern area of the Anauroch was a frozen land of rocks and the black glacier known as the [[High Ice]]. The middle area was the dry [[Plain of Standing Stones]], where winds abraded jagged rocks that stood in the middle of a sea of gravel. Lastly, the southern part was commonly known as [[the Sword]], a hot sandy desert. Anauroch was bordered on the west by the [[Silver Marches]], the [[Savage Frontier]], and [[Evereska]]; on the south by [[Cormyr]] and south-east by the [[Dalelands]]; on the east by the [[Moonsea]] and [[the Ride]].

==Life and Society==
The Bedine nomads were simplistic in nature and survived by raiding and guiding caravans through the hidden passes, making their home on the surface of the wastes, traveling from oasis to oasis. They were divided into a dozen or so minor tribes lead by sheiks, whose wealth was measured not by [[gold]], but by the size and well-being of their herds. The Bedine were good-natured and noble, and the encroachment upon their home by the Shadovar trapped them in an exposed position.{{Fact}} Suspicious of magic at the best of times, they had to deal with a vastly superior magical force altering the environment around them.{{Fact}}

The [[Zhentarim]], always eager to make a profit, fought long and hard to secure routes for their caravans through the desert. The northern routes across the [[High Ice]] were plagued by monsters too numerous to fight and in the south humanoid raiders and interference from the [[Dalelands|Dales]] and [[Cormyr]] hindered their efforts. After years of painstaking effort the Zhentarim created a caravan route via oases in [[the Sword]], the sandy southern portion of Anauroch. The garrison constantly fought to defend its territory, but despite years of bitter fighting with the Bedine, the Zhentarim held little more land in Anauroch than that on which they stood.{{Fact}}

Below the dunes of Anauroch lurked what remained of the evil [[phaerimm]], a race of reptilian spellcasters with near-unrivaled mastery of the [[Magic|Art]], long imprisoned in a magical shell called the [[Sharn Wall]] under the desert. The phaerimm were forgotten by all but the wisest of sages until the barrier holding them [[Return of the Archwizards|was broken]]. After fighting the combined armies of most of [[Evereska]], [[Evermeet]], the [[Heartlands]], the [[Chosen of Mystra]], and the [[Shadovar]]—all at once—the remaining phaerimm were scattered beneath the surface.{{Fact}}

The returned masters of Anauroch, the ancient Netherese wizards of [[Thultanthar]], warped and twisted by their long exile in the Plane of Shadow, were determined to retake what they considered their birthright, longing to restore the barren wasteland that was Anauroch to the once-fertile [[Netheril (region)|land of Netheril]]. The Shadovar had a regimented society, ruled by [[Telamont Tanthul]] and his [[Princes of Shade]], all working in unison, toughened by centuries of hardship in the Plane of Shadow, to accomplish their common goal. They all but ignored the Bedine and Zhentarim, considering them beneath their notice.{{Fact}}

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-34500}}, the [[sarrukh]] empire of [[Isstosseffifil]] rose to prominence. Throughout the [[Days of Thunder]] they ruled much of the land that would one day become Anauroch. Eventually, their empire fell at the hands of the phaerimm and they were forced by the Netherese to scatter.

In {{Yearlink|-461}}, the phaerimm started casting spells in the land of Netheril that eventually caused the creation of Anauroch.

In [[10 DR]], the Netheril region was renamed Anauroch, to reflect the great desert that the region had become.{{Fact}}

In [[329 DR]] the Anauroch desert finally stopped perpetually expanding outward as the sharns defeated the phaerimms.

In [[1038 DR]], the sands of Anauroch began to spread out southward once more.

The arrival of Thultanthar in [[1372 DR]] brought about significant change in the political and geographic landscape of the Anauroch. In that year, three Princes of Shade performed a ritual that created a huge storm above the Shoal of Thirst, and transformed it into the Shadow Sea. For around a year, they used shadow blankets to melt the glacier of the High Ice, before that plan was disrupted.

In [[1385 DR]] the [[spellplague]] caused the merging of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], creating changes in the landscape of Faerun, including large areas that collapsed into the underdark.  Changes to the Anauroch were not specified, but a large area of the Frozen Sea was marked as the "Deep Maw" on a map from [[1479 DR]]. <ref>

By [[1479 DR]], the Anauroch was an arid dust bowl spotted with youthful forests. The melted glacier created rivers and grasslands. Rain fell and the temperature was moderated. Some areas had grown lush and verdant.

In [[1485 DR]], Bedine rebels began a concentrated effort to overthrow their Netherese overlords following Netheril's war in [[Cormyr]].

In [[1487 DR]], Thulanthar's cataclysmic destruction in [[Myth Drannor]] signaled the end of the Second Netherese Empire, and by [[1488 DR]] the empire was reduced to a shadow of its former size. By this point Netherese forces and Bedine tribes were in full conflict, warring over key points in the desert. One such battle near the [[Memory Spire]] managed to awaken a hive of phaerimm sleeping within, causing the aberrations to begin leeching life from the land around them.

Some time after [[1485 DR]], the Anauroch was once more a desert.

==Rumors & Legends==
The ruins of the very first [[cloud palace]], belonging to the father of the [[cloud giant]]s, [[Nicias]], were thought to be located somewhere in the great desert.

There was a [[Faerûn]]ian folktale that stated the Anauroch desert was formed by a single [[golem]]. The construct was tasked by its master to shovel sand into the region, but was subsequently forgotten about. After continuing with its task for so long, it was said to have formed the desert.{{Page needed}}

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Black Road]] was a [[Zhentarim]] built trade route across the northern portion of the Sword that included the artificial oasis [[Vuerthyl]].<ref name=SKT>{{Cite adventurers league/The Black Road}} 
*[[Lundeth]], an ancient village near the southwestern edge of the Anauroch, was rebuilt by the Shadovar.
* The ruins of the flying city [[Negarath]] created a cavern system beneath a canyon in the Plain of Standing Stones.
* The [[Obsidian Chapel]], a temple to [[Bane]] that was plundered by Bedine raiders sometime well before [[1281 DR]].
* [[Oreme]] was a ancient [[Sarrukh]] city near the frozen sea that the Shadovar rebuilt.
* [[Orofin]] an fortified ancient city southwest of the Scimitar Spires was rebuilt by the Shadovar. 
* [[Rasilith]] was an ancient city at the edge of the Quarter of Emptiness that the Shadovar rebuilt.
* [[Ularith]], a hidden sand-swept [[Netherese]] death sect temple complex defended by a powerful [[lich-lord]]. The complex held a massive portal network that connected the temple and its many hidden crypts all across [[Faerûn]], some being as far as [[Mulhorand]] or even beyond, reaching the [[Utter East]].

===Empire of Shadows===
Returned in [[1372 DR]], [[Thultanthar]], the City of Shadows, was a floating mountaintop, sliced off and inverted, with a city built upon it. It was built centuries past, before the folly of [[Karsus]], and no magic like it survived in Faerûn in the 14th century, as the reincarnated [[Mystra]] restricted mortals from ever again creating such potent spells as the ones that created Shade's ''[[mythallar]]''.{{Fact}}

===Ruins of Hlaungadath===
About forty miles east of the ruined city [[Ascore]] on the northwestern border of the desert, another abandoned city rose from the sands. [[Hlaungadath]] was one of the three floating cities that [[Mystra]] saved during the destruction of [[Netheril]]. It was a city that landed near the High Ice and was eventually abandoned. Old but largely intact, the ruins were inhabited by a clan of [[lamia]]s. The lamias stalked the nearby oases, preying on careless Zhentarim or unwary [[Bedine]]. Anyone knowledgeable of the desert knew of the evil of Hlaungadath and gave the ruins a wide berth.{{Fact}}

==Inhabitants==
The only people to call Anauroch home were the nomadic [[Bedine]] tribes and a small [[Zhentarim]] garrison, tasked with patrolling and defending a line of oases along the [[Black Road]], the trade route that winded west from the ruins of [[Teshendale]] to [[Llorkh]] at the foot of the [[Graypeak Mountains]]. A diminutive people called the [[D'tarig]] were the only other major inhabitants, who lived along the borders of the desert and interact somewhat with peoples from surrounding countries.{{Fact}}

Finally, on [[Nightal 20]] in [[1372 DR]], the Netherese enclave of [[Thultanthar]] (also known as the City of Shade) of the ancient Netherese Empire re-emerged from the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the skies above the [[Dire Wood]], before drifting into Anauroch, settling above the [[Shoal of Thirst]], bringing the evil and warped [[Shadovar]] into the Realms.{{Fact}} This Shadovar population subdued the local Bedine for roughly 100 years before their fortunes were swiftly reversed when Thulanthar crashed down on [[Myth Drannor]], robbing the Netherese of their capital and reducing them to a handful of settlements and forces skirmishing with the Bedine.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Telamont Tanthul]], ruler of the Shade Enclave, a powerful shadow archmage.
* The [[Princes of Shade]], the sons of Telamont Tanthul.
* [[Ruha]], a Bedine [[Harper]]. She attempted to capture the Seraph of Lies [[Malik el Sami yn Nasser]] to bring him before a [[High Harper]] court.
