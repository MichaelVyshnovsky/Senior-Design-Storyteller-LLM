'''Tupaal''' was an underwater city of the [[sea elves]] located on the edge of [[Yhauntan Bay]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], in the underwater region of [[Selu'Maraar]] which it was the capital of until [[942 DR]].

==History==
During its time as the capital, Tupaal was ruled by the [[Coronal]]. [[Arak Thuvys]] reigned for eighty-eight years from the {{Yearlink|851}} to the {{YearlinkName|929}}. Coronal Arak died in an outbreak of an unnamed [[plague]] and two of his heirs, [[Tumak Thuvys]] and [[Tenala Thuvys]], perished in the same blight, leaving the throne to [[Salak Thuvys]], who reigned until the {{YearlinkName|942}}. Salak's throne was passed to Coronal [[Farlyssa Thuvys]], after the [[Thuvys]] family ousted the [[Thuvys]]. She became known as the last ruler of Tupaal, who moved the capital of Selu'Maraar to [[Aluwand]] in 942 DR. As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Tupaal existed as an underwater city, a neighbor of [[Sembia]].
