        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|-1469|TS}}, the Aryselmalyr Empire ignites the [[Third Serôs War]] by lashing out against minor raids from [[aquatic ogre]]s and [[koalinth]]s. Four years later, in {{YearlinkConvert|-1465|TS}}, [[merfolk]] within Thalorlyn began rebelling against Aryselmalyr over the oppressive violence that was occurring in the Third Serôs War.\n\nAryselmalyr's ruler, [[Coronal]] [[Essyl Merynth]], secretly appropriates the rebellion by supporting a traitorous merfolk by the name of [[Kyron]], who like him had succumbed to the maddening whispers of [[Dagon]]. With the Coronal's influence Kyron slowly rose to a position of leadership among the rebellious merfolk, all the while passing military secrets back to his benefactor.\n\nTwo years later, Thalorlyn itself to be independent and claimed the city of [[Myth Nantar]] for itself. Rebellions would slowly arise against Thalorlyn's new king. The Aryselmalyr Empire would viciously crack down on this, killing an estimated thirty percent of the merfolk in Serôs.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|-1461|TS}}, Coronal Essyl had an expedition dispatched to the mysterious [[Trench of Lopok]]. His agents would return to him later that same year with a trio of [[fiendish]] [[kraken]]s, fellow servants of Dagon that were willing to ally themselves with the mad rulers, along with a powerful [[artifact]] that they forged called the ''[[Emerald Eye of Kyron|Emerald Eye]]''. Essyl would gift this artifact to Kyron so as to ensure the mad King's loyalty.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|-1455|TS}} the various merrows and koalinths of Serôs decided to combine their forces, forming the [[Horde of the Bloodtide]], but this consolidated front continued to be no match against the combined forces of Aryselmalyr and Thalorlyn. That same year a group of spies discovered that the corrupt rulers' secret alliance with the krakens for further power. This revelation led to the formation of a rebel group known as the [[Republic of Tivaan]]. Despite the power of their kraken allies and the ''Emerald Eye'', Tivaan managed to depose Kyron and his loyalists a year later, casting them out from the Hmur Plateau and becoming its successor state.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Tivaan\" />"
