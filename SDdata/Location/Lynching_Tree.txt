The '''Lynching Tree''', also known as the '''Tree of Souls''' to followers of [[Kelemvor]], was a massive, gnarled [[tree]] located in the [[Pauper's Section]] of [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] in [[Neverwinter]]. Amidst its roots was the site of a mass grave for violent criminals.

==Description==
After years of being the preferred place to bury accused criminals&mdash;ranging from truly despicable bandits to falsely accused innocents&mdash;the tree came to be suffused with [[evil]] energy. 

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|1479}}, [[Thay]]an [[wizard]]s in service to [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] began to tap into the tree's dark spiritual power to fuel their [[ritual]]s as part of their ongoing occupation of the Neverdeath Graveyard. In response, [[Acolyte]] [[Mina Neyman]] of the [[Eternal Order of Kelemvor]] set out to cleanse the tree with the aid of [[adventurer]]s.

Later, when the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]] conspired against Neverwinter, [[Archdruid]] [[Morningdawn]] recognized the tree as the only place in Neverwinter where she could perform a ritual to summon the twisted [[Archfey patron|fey patron]] of [[Nostura]], one of the Ascendancy's leaders. The ritual succeeded, summoning the [[hag]] known as Auntie [[Margath Bale-eye]], and allowing Morningdawn to banish her with the aid of the [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].
