Immilmar was the capital city of Rashemen and seat of power for the nations Iron Lord. Beyond its political importance as the heart of Rashemen, it was perhaps most famous for its great crafters, whose goods were renowned across the Unapproachable East and the Cold Lands.
At the center of Immilmar was the Lords citadel, built with the help of the mighty Wychlaran. Around the keep was the central part of Immilmar, that comprised stone buildings that were only found in the countrys large cities.
The homes that were built farther-out were constructed like those found throughout the rest of Rashemen wood-and-stone lodges that featured steep-sloped roofs. The waterfront on the western side of the city was a pleasing locale that was always active with fishers and other boat-faring folk.
The city was set upon the western coast of Rashemen, overlooking the great Lake Ashane.
While Immilmar and the entire nation of Rashemen were ruled by the Iron Lord, known by Rashemaar as the Huhrong, the true power was held by the Wychlaran. It was by their permission that the great warrior-rulers were able to wield their power.
Merchants and traders from Thesk and the Cold Lands regularly traveled throughout Immilmar, selling wares and goods from their respective homes. Similarly, traders and fisherman from nearby Rashemaar villages come to the city to earn their keep.
Immilmar was renowned for its craftspeople that specialized in working with wood, leather, and iron.
In addition to the 60 or so berserkers from the local lodges, Immilmar was defended by Iron Lords Guard, a military group of approximate 1800 warriors.
Originally a fortress of the ancient Narfell Empire, Huhrongs Citadel was built around the ruins, and the rest of the city were built out from there. 
The city was partially flood in the , when agents of Thay melted a portion of the glacier that covered the Icerim Mountains.
Some years later gangs of murderers somehow teleported into Immilmar and began slaying important city leaders. They were defeated in short order by the resident berserkers.
