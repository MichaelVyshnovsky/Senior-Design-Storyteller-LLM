city
Dloemen was an abandoned and ruined city within the Umber Marshes, located north of the town of Escalant in Aglarond.
The city of Dloemen was long-uninhabited ruins long before the 13 century DR. As of the , the ruins were a base for the activities of a marilith named Araunrhee for several years. She dispatched her tanarri troops to raid surrounding areas for prisoners. Her demonic army was allowed to devastate the local ecology by devouring much of its wildlife. All captured humans were dragged back to a ruined temple in Dloemen, where Araunrhee performed a dark ritual, sacrificing the mortals in order to increase her hellish powers. Maxan Maxer, a long-time lover and adventuring partner of Storm Silverhand, a Chosen of Mystra, attempted to bring down Araunrhee but was decapitated by the fiend. However, her operations were disturbed, and she disappeared from Dloemen, taking Maxans head and body with her.
The fall of the fiendish ritual and destruction of Araunrhees shrine created destructive spellstorms that ravaged southern Thay for a year afterward. Soon after, with no magical barriers, Dloemen ruins were claimed by the expanded bogs of the Umber Marsh.
