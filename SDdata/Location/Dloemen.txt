'''Dloemen''' was an abandoned and ruined city within the [[Umber Marshes]], located north of the town of [[Escalant]] in [[Aglarond]].

==History==
The city of Dloemen was long-uninhabited ruins long before the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1260}}, the ruins were a base for the activities of a [[marilith]] named [[Araunrhee]] for several years. She dispatched her [[tanar'ri]] troops to raid surrounding areas for prisoners. Her demonic army was allowed to devastate the local ecology by devouring much of its wildlife. All captured humans were dragged back to a ruined temple in Dloemen, where Araunrhee performed a dark ritual, sacrificing the mortals in order to increase her hellish powers. [[Maxan Maxer]], a long-time lover and adventuring partner of [[Storm Silverhand]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], attempted to bring down Araunrhee but was decapitated by the [[fiend]]. However, her operations were disturbed, and she disappeared from Dloemen, taking Maxan's head and body with her.

The fall of the fiendish ritual and destruction of Araunrhee's shrine created destructive ''[[spellstorm]]s'' that ravaged southern [[Thay]] for a year afterward. Soon after, with no magical barriers, Dloemen ruins were claimed by the expanded bogs of the Umber Marsh.
