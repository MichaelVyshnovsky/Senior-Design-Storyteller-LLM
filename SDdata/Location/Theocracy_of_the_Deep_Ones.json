        "mainbody": "The Theocracy of the Deep Ones was a morkoth kingdom beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars that lasted for a 109 years, existing from  to , and was one of the big powers of the Third Epoch of Serôs.\nThe Theocracy of the Deep Ones arose in the wake of the Sixth Serôs Wars end in the .\nA hundred and two years after their rise to power, the Theocracy instigated the Seventh Serôs War when they attacked the merfolk empire of Hmurrath and the shalarin kingdom of Esrath on two fronts. From the former, the morkoths stole a powerful artifact known as the Emerald Eye of Kyron. The Emerald Eye would play a major role in the war going forward, as the morkoths used its powers to great effect.\nIn the , during one of the last battles of the War, a legion of elite morkoth warriors slew the storm giant adventurer Lorthan and took from him the legendary double-bladed sword Krakenscourge. Determined to reclaim the weapon that had long been lost to them, the hidden and normally isolationist Triton Protectorates unexpectedly joined the fray. The tritons not only reclaimed the Krakenscourge from the morkoths, but their intervention dealt a crushing blow to the Theocracy of the Deep Ones. With their war lost, the morkoths were forced by the tritons to scatter and flee to even lower depths of the Inner Sea."
