        "mainbody": "The '''Theocracy of the Deep Ones''' was a [[morkoth]] kingdom beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] that lasted for a 109 years, existing from {{YearlinkConvert|-145|TS}} to {{YearlinkConvert|-36|TS}}, and was one of the big powers of the [[Third Epoch]] of [[Ser么s]].",
        "History": "The Theocracy of the Deep Ones arose in the wake of the [[Sixth Ser么s War]]'s end in the {{YearlinkName|-215}}.\n\nA hundred and two years after their rise to power, the Theocracy instigated the [[Seventh Ser么s War]] when they attacked the [[merfolk]] empire of [[Hmurrath]] and the [[shalarin]] kingdom of [[Es'rath]] on two fronts. From the former, the morkoths stole a powerful [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Emerald Eye of Kyron]]''. The ''Emerald Eye'' would play a major role in the war going forward, as the morkoths used its powers to great effect.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-106}}, during one of the last battles of the War, a legion of elite morkoth warriors slew the [[storm giant]] [[adventurer]] [[Lorthan]] and took from him the legendary [[double-bladed sword]] ''[[Kyron the Krakenscourge|Krakenscourge]]''. Determined to reclaim the weapon that had long been lost to them, the hidden and normally isolationist [[Triton Protectorates]] unexpectedly joined the fray. The [[triton]]s not only reclaimed the ''Krakenscourge'' from the morkoths, but their intervention dealt a crushing blow to the Theocracy of the Deep Ones. With their war lost, the morkoths were forced by the tritons to scatter and flee to even lower depths of the Inner Sea."
