'''Innisfall''' was a hamlet in the vicinity of [[Dragonspear Castle]].

==History==
The [[Shining Crusade]] targeted Innisfall in [[1368 DR|the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], hoping to sack the small settlement and gain supplies and recruits. However, when they arrived, the hamlet was nearly empty of both people and supplies. Innisfall had been forewarned by [[Corinth]], a Crusade scout who had family in Innisfall, and the entire hamlet evacuated shortly before the Crusade arrived.
