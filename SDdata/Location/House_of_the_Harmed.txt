The '''House of the Harmed''' was a temple of [[Ilmater]] found in [[Aralent]], home to the well-respected priest Master Sufferer [[Olbedan]].

In the [[1343 DR|Year of the Boot, 1343 DR]], the people of [[Hlondeth]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] requested that the [[Graycloak's Wolves]] adventuring company deliver the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the holiest book of the [[church of Ilmater]]—to Master Sufferer Olbedan at the House of the Harmed in Aralent. However, during the harsh winter, Graycloak's Wolves fell prey to [[doppelganger]]s and [[leucrotta]] preying on travellers and never made it to Olbedan. The ''Tome'' was thought lost in the winter snows.
