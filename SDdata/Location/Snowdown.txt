Snowdown was an island of the Moonshae Isles. It lay to the east of Gwynneth.
Snowdown was one of the most temperate islands of the Moonshaes. It was characterized by rolling hills and good roads.
The Andover Heights dominated the islands western side. There were three lakes, Mal Feargal in the north, and Mal Sul and Harloch (which were connected by a short river) in the central region. The Maloren Sods occupied much of the easternmost parts of Snowdown. The settlements of Pengram, Harloch, and Llandrain, as well as the capital city of Westphal, were all connected by the Snowdown Ride the only other settlement was Brannoch. A single Moonwell was located in the forest near the southern shore of Mal Sul.
Snowdown had a strong agricultural background, exporting such things as kiwis. Prior to its occupation the island was the first stop for ships coming from Amn or Calimshan and the royal family provided supplies to other islands in the Moonshaes. Following their occupation, Amnian merchant cartels would ship anything of value back to Amn.
In the early 1400s DR, Amn hired mercenaries to invade the Moonshae Isles and they seized Snowdown. Thereafter, they subjected Snowdown to Amnian rule. In the years that followed, Snowdown was effectively under a military occupation, with the royal family held hostage in their palace. Mercenary companies policed the cities, crushing any act of defiance or anyone who dared to show allegiance to the High King of the Moonshaes.
By 1479 DR, Snowdown was ruled by Lady Erliza Daressin, a vampire, and Viceroy of Caer Westphal.
In the ten years that followed, the Amnian occupiers overworked the native Ffolk as they chopped down much of Snowdowns woodlands, stripped its mines, and clogged its waterways with refuse. Several rebellions arose to fight against Lady Erliza, each time ruthlessly put down by soldiers. By 1489 DR the Amnians, noticing the islands diminishing returns, began to ponder that holding onto Snowdown might be more trouble than it was worth. Meanwhile, Ffolk rebellions were quietly brewing with support from Alaron.
The Ffolk and colonists from Amn lived on the island. It was one of the few places on the Moonshae Isles where the Ffolk had never mixed with Northlanders.
Following the Amnian occupation, the island experienced an influx of creatures seeking mercenary work, for the Amnian rulers didnt care about allegiances or origins of their mercenaries. These included drow, goblinoids, ogres, and orcs. The island especially experienced an influx of half-breed creatures, such as cambions, half-elves, and half-orcs.
This influx of creatures made Snowdown feel more crowded than other islands in the Moonshaes and the number of inhabitants from foreign lands eventually outnumbered the population of native Ffolk.
