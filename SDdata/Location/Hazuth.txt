Hazuth was a city located in eastern Dambrath.
Located north of Melanith Bay where the River Ammath terminated, Hazuth served as a convenient place for depositing bluewood harvested from inland forests.
20,000 people of various races called Hazuth home. Many docked their ships here during the violent rainy season since the bay offered natural protection.
Traders from distant lands such as Westgate and Chondath would travel here to buy horses.
