Oeble, previously known as Oeble-town,
Lawlessness on the streets of Oeble.|375x375px
The chaotic nature of the city led to a relatively quick turnaround of small businesses that sprang and got extinguished across Oeble. It was very common for businesses to change names and locations every few months. However, some more permanent establishments managed to be stable enough to be known outside the city and even received mention in Volothamp Geddarms famous, or infamous, travel guides.
Yuan-ti of the House Eselemas trafficked slaves and mordayn powder from beneath the town in an area called the Underways. It was from there that they maintained a portal to the city of Essembra in Battledale around the year 1359 DR. Slave trade and fencing of stolen goods were done in the open in the Underways. Persistently, there were rumors of spellcasters dwelling deep in the Underways, who offered permanent facial alteration through magic to those on the run from the law.
Oebles neighbors considered the city to be a "doorstep danger," yet valued it as a neutral ground that separated the Border Kingdoms and their rulers. One of the High Dukes from the Border Kingdoms thought Oeble to be "too useful to destroy," and many shared that opinion well into the late 14 century DR. Despite that, dangers of conquest or subtle domination were ever-present.
Oeble was built as a trading center centuries before the late 14 century DR. Historically, the town was a lawless land, but by the 14 century, it had established code of laws and rulership and policing force. However, as a city, Oeble remained a dangerous and crime-ridden settlement.
Circa the early-to-mid 14 century DR, a spirit naga named Ssensariith became entangled in an infamous incident known as the Night of Seven Nagas.
In the late 14 century DR, the Faceless Master of Oeble diffused and broke an annexation attempt by the Talduth Vale through diplomatic negotiations with the Barony of Great Oak and Owlhold. Oeble convinced the Barony of Great Oak and Owlhold to proclaim their support of independent Oeble and insinuate that if Oeble were to be part of the Talduth Vale, both regions would be forced to attack and destroy the city.
On Kythorn 11, the , a priceless tome known as The Black Bouquet arrived to Oeble, carried by Miri Buckman of the Red Hart Guild. The book was daringly stolen from her by Aeron sar Randal and his accomplices. The priceless item attracted the attention of Dark Sister Sefris Uuthrakt, a Disciple of the Dark Moon, as well as several crime leaders of Oeble, including the tanarukk leader of the Red Axes – Kesk Turnskull.
*There existed a prophecy in the Border Kingdoms that a dragon would one day reveal a mighty treasure somewhere in Oeble. Many believed it to be nothing more but an attempt to attract greedy individuals to Oeble, yet those who believed the prophecy pointed out that it predated the city.
