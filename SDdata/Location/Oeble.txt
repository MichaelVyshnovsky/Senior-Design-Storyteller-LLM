'''Oeble''', previously known as '''Oeble-town''',

{{quote|''Oeble? A place built on the bones of betrayed men: if you venture there , take care not to join their number. Beware the knives, lad – everyone in the place knows how to throw them, or just where to plunge them...''|Mage Royal [[Ghuldribrand Mroster]] of [[Zindalankh]], in conversation with [[Volothamp Geddarm]], [[1353 DR]]{{Cite polyhedron/138/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}}}}

==Description==
[[File:BorderKingdomsMap.jpg|thumb|''A 14{{th}} century [[DR]] map showing the position of Oeble at the center of the [[Border Kingdoms]].''|375x375px]]
Streets of Oeble were chaotic and maze-like, twisting and turning around private walled courtyards, tallhouses with looming balconies, swayed into dark bawling alleyways, and homes that rose up to four stories high above stores and businesses on ground floors. Oeble's two main streets were [[Alhan's Ride]] and [[Vriel's Walk]] that crossed the [[River Scelptar]] via bridges ([[Alhan's Span]] and [[Vriel's Leap]], respectively) and sliced the city from north to south. Between Alhan's Ride and Vriel's Walk stood the city's third bridge – the [[Arch of Gargoyles]], that linked [[Laskalar's Square]] to the northern side of Scelptar. All three bridges were in chronically poor condition.The map of Oeble featured in ''[[Power of Faerûn]]'' seems to have erroneous compass rose that was not flipped along with the map. To avoid confusion, the map was flipped to match the position seen in ''[[The Black Bouquet]]'' novel and to match descriptions and positions of streets described in ''[[Polyhedron Newszine]]''.

The [[Dead King's Walk]] is a waving street that crossed the city from east to west on Scelptar's southern shore. Oeble's largest streets began on Laskalar's Square. They were [[The Rolling Shields]], that crossed the [[Sixturrets]] intersection before reaching the edge of town to the west and [[Balamonthar's Street]] to the east. Both crossed the Dead King's Walk before reaching the edges of Oble.

Over the city's streets stretched the so-called [[Rainspans]]. These elevated ways connected the higher-rising buildings of Oeble's southern part. These rickety and often crumbling bridges could be found leaping from balconies, windows, and roofs. No building was untouched by Rainspans, including commercial structures like the [[Griffingate House]] inn in the heart of Oeble.

Underneath Oeble laid its shady subterranean underbelly – the twisting underground ways and tunnels known as the [[Underways]] (also known as the "Lawless Below" by the locals). Most entrances to the Underways were narrow, claustrophobic stairways, slippery due to blood and refuse, that could often be found in Oeble's dark alleyways or building cellars. Most non-human and monstrous populations dwelt in these river-seepaged tunnels. The Underways had inns, taverns, and other businesses, tucked away in their dimly-lit depths. The Underways were constantly expanded, and most of it remained unmapped due to strict local laws. Spies and agents of the Faceless Master monitories entrances to the Underways, so any adventurers or guests of the city could abandon hope to slip into Oeble's underbelly unnoticed.

==Geography==
{{quote|''All [[rogue]]s meet in Oeble.''|An old saying}}<br/>
Oeble straddled the River Scelptar west of the [[Qurth Forest]] near the center of the Border Kingdoms. It was built on the [[Great Ford]] of Scelptar.{{Cite polyhedron/146/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|43}}

==Government==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the rule was in the hands of the [[Faceless Master]] and the greedy [[Council of Nine Merchants]] who were more effective at bickering and infighting than influencing the ruler. The Faceless Master always listened to the Council's voice but rarely cared for it nor followed it. By [[1374 DR]], the original Faceless Master was long dead, and his guise and responsibilities were claimed by his female chamber-slave. The [[Faceless Master (impostor)|Faceless Master impostor's]] true name was unknown, but she possessed a natural gift of mimicry, making most, if not all, never found the ruler's identity. Unlike her predecessor, the imposter loved Oeble and sought to protect it from neighing regions' attempts at conquest. She was a master manipulator, who manipulated adventurers, groups, enemies, and spread rumors that aided her agenda.

Oeble's "guard" and police force was the group known as the [[Gray Blades]]. The Blades' number was over three dozen in the late 14{{th}} century DR. Members of the organization were well compensated and consisted of [[human]] and [[half-elven]] outlaws from outside of Oeble who had skills and appreciated quality consorts, food, wine, and pay, all generously provided by the Faceless Master. The Gray Blades were actively disliked by the city's citizens for their harsh methods and spycraft. In battle, Gray Blades were formidable. They were well-trained in acrobatics, sharpshooting, and deflecting missiles and could anticipate trouble from afar.

===Laws===
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the government of Oeble placed a ban on leaping off the Rainspans or causing a creature's fall, as well as dropping or tossing items onto the streets below. However, this law never stopped Oeblaun from dropping deadly missiles, [[dart]]s, [[knives]], or rocks onto the heads of unlucky targets.

Despite its laws and police, Oeble greeted every dawn with numerous dead citizens who perished under cover of the night in various violent ways.

===Dead Cart===
In the southeastern part of the city were its garbage-middens – where Oeblaun dead were buried in mass graves. Every day the so-called Dead Cart, driven by [[Hulm Draeridge]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR, patrolled the streets and collected the city's overnight cadavers.


==Trade==
[[File:Oeble lawless.png|thumb|''Lawlessness on the streets of Oeble.''|375x375px]]
The chaotic nature of the city led to a relatively quick turnaround of small businesses that sprang and got extinguished across Oeble. It was very common for businesses to change names and locations every few months. However, some more permanent establishments managed to be stable enough to be known outside the city and even received mention in [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s famous, or infamous, travel guides.

[[Yuan-ti]] of the [[House Eselemas]] trafficked slaves and [[mordayn]] powder from beneath the town in an area called the Underways. It was from there that they maintained a ''[[portal]]'' to the city of [[Essembra]] in [[Battledale]] around the year [[1359 DR]]. Slave trade and fencing of stolen goods were done in the open in the Underways. Persistently, there were rumors of spellcasters dwelling deep in the Underways, who offered permanent facial alteration through magic to those on the run from the law.

Oeble's neighbors considered the city to be a "doorstep danger," yet valued it as a neutral ground that separated the Border Kingdoms and their rulers. One of the High Dukes from the Border Kingdoms thought Oeble to be "too useful to destroy," and many shared that opinion well into the late 14{{th}} century DR. Despite that, dangers of conquest or subtle domination were ever-present.

==History==
Oeble was built as a trading center centuries before the late 14{{th}} century DR. Historically, the town was a lawless land, but by the 14{{th}} century, it had established code of laws and rulership and policing force. However, as a city, Oeble remained a dangerous and crime-ridden settlement.

''Circa'' the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century DR, a [[spirit naga]] named [[Ssensariith]] became entangled in an infamous incident known as the [[Night of Seven Nagas]].

In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Faceless Master of Oeble diffused and broke an annexation attempt by the [[Talduth Vale]] through diplomatic negotiations with the [[Barony of Great Oak]] and [[Owlhold]]. Oeble convinced the Barony of Great Oak and Owlhold to proclaim their support of independent Oeble and insinuate that if Oeble were to be part of the Talduth Vale, both regions would be forced to attack and destroy the city.

On [[Kythorn 11]], the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, a priceless tome known as ''[[The Black Bouquet (book)|The Black Bouquet]]'' arrived to Oeble, carried by [[Miri Buckman (ranger)|Miri Buckman]] of the [[Red Hart Guild]]. The book was daringly stolen from her by [[Aeron sar Randal]] and his accomplices. The priceless item attracted the attention of Dark Sister [[Sefris Uuthrakt]], a Disciple of the [[Dark Moon]], as well as several crime leaders of Oeble, including the [[tanarukk]] leader of the [[Red Axes]] – [[Kesk Turnskull]].

==Rumors & Legends==
*There existed a prophecy in the Border Kingdoms that a [[dragon]] would one day reveal a mighty treasure somewhere in Oeble. Many believed it to be nothing more but an attempt to attract greedy individuals to Oeble, yet those who believed the prophecy pointed out that it predated the city.
