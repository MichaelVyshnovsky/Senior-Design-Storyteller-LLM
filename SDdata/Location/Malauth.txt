Malauth was the "most sinister" goblin realm in the Rauvin Mountains in Luruar.
Malauth was located in the central southern foothills of the Rauvin Mountains.
In 1372 DR, Queen Nargharab was the recognized leader of Malauth. However, Nargharab was known to be the puppet of seven priests of Maglubiyet known as the Malauthar. The Malauthar used rituals and signs to instill fear in the realms inhabitants, who began suspecting that the Malauthar made up those signs and meanings at whim.
