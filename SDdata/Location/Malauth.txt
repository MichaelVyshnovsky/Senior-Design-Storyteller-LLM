'''Malauth''' was the "most sinister" [[goblin]] realm in the [[Rauvin Mountains]] in [[Luruar]].

==Geography==
Malauth was located in the central southern foothills of the Rauvin Mountains.

==Government==
In [[1372 DR]], Queen [[Nargharab]] was the recognized leader of Malauth. However, Nargharab was known to be the puppet of seven priests of [[Maglubiyet]] known as the [[Malauthar]]. The Malauthar used rituals and signs to instill fear in the realm's inhabitants, who began suspecting that the Malauthar made up those signs and meanings at whim.
