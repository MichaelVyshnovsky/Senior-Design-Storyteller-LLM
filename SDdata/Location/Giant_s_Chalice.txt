'''Giant's Chalice''', otherwise known as '''Suswynfa''' by its octopoid inhabitants,

==Description==
Giant's Chalice had a large U-shape, making it what some referred to as an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxbow_lake oxbow lake].

==Geography==
In relation to the surface, Giant's Chalice was said to be located 12 miles beneath the [[Trader's Road]] and it was connected to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It was said to stretch from the southernmost tip of the [[Lake of Dragons]], down to [[Asbravn]], and then up to the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]]

In relation to the Lowerdark, it was located roughly north of [[Cairnheim]].

==History==
[[Stone giant]]s once dwelled above the Giant's Chalice and some believed that [[dwarves]] from [[Shanatar]] dubbed the lake "Giant's Chalice" because of this.

In [[1357 DR]], the lake would spend years fruitlessly trying to negotiate peace with their savage cousins, who often would feast upon them. Over time their population would greatly decline because of this.

By [[1372 DR]] members of this race concluded that more active measures needed to be taken. They began honing their skills in combat and [[magic]], while also appealing to their [[sea elf]] trading partners for aid in the conflict.

==Flora & Fauna==
Creatures in the Lowerdark were known to travel from miles away just to drink from this lake. Predatory creatures typically prowled around the lake for such prey.

Within its depths laid a glowing coral reef, whose light could be seen from above the water in some parts. These were tended to by blue ring octopuses, who some in 1372 DR estimated had been living there for over a millennium. They were known to carve this coral into intricate shapes and then trade them with sea elves traveling from the Sea of Fallen Stars through flooded passages. These sea elves often came from the kingdom of [[Naramyr]] and would resell them at the city of [[Myth Nantar]].
