        "History": "During the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the [[Valsharess]] began a campaign to declare herself supreme ruler of the Underdark. When her forces took over the northern drow territories, Lith My'athar was the only city that remained unconquered. A fragile alliance existed between the native [[Lolth]] worshipers and a group of refugees composed of [[Eilistraee]] worshipers, led by The Seer, a powerful Eilistraeean priestess.\n\nDuring that year, the [[adventurer]] known as [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]] and companions found themselves conscripted into the defense of the city. The adventurer had initially entered [[Undermountain]] as part of an effort to defend [[Waterdeep]] against attacks on the surface by the Valsharess's forces. Eventually, they rescued [[Halaster Blackcloak]] from imprisonment but, in return, the Mad Mage placed a [[Geas/Quest|geas]] on the hero to defeat the Valsharess, then magically transported the adventurer and companions to Lith My'athar.\n\nKnowing that an attack on the city was inevitable, the Seer tasked the adventurers with weakening the attacking forces by disrupting alliances that the Valsharess had made with factions of [[beholder]]s, [[illithid]]s, and an [[undead]] cult lead by the [[dracolich]] [[Vix'thra]], while seeking potential allies among the [[golem]]s on the Isle of [[Alsigard the Maker|the Maker]] and another nearby island with a mysterious settlement of [[avariel]].\n\nWhen the attack came, the adventurer co-coordinated the defense of the city, first at the main gate and then the city's port."
