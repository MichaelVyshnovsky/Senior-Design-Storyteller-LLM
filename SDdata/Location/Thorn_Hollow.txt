'''Thorn Hollow''' was a group of shallow caves in [[Thorngap]], a [[druidic circle]] in the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]]. It was briefly taken over by the druid [[Halsaime]] and used as a stronghold in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The Hollow was a series of caverns, tunnels, and open spaces in the depths of the King's Forest.

==Inhabitants==
Halsaime made his home there, along with the druids [[Garick]], [[Flinbeck]], [[Thomren]], [[Larres]], [[Drien]], and [[Carm Woodrusk]]. They lived alongside a number of [[wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[dire bear]]s, and other animals. During his madness, the caverns became filled with [[red musk zombie]]s and [[vine horror]]s, and the animals were driven into a frenzy.

==History==
[[File:Thorn Hollow corruption node.jpg|300px|thumb|''A corruption node.'']]
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the druid Halsaime received a [[Halsaime's staff|powerful cursed staff]] from his friend [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]]. Oriphaun had taken it from a [[Shadovar]] agent he killed while protecting the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'', and correctly identified that it was a dangerous artifact best handled by the wise. Unfortunately, Halsaime was overcome by a furious madness and used the staff's power to twist nature and his fellow foresters into a force to conquer the world with.

The [[Harpers]] [[Kirinel Zay]], [[Tarim Inavule]], and [[Jussko Kwahn]] investigated the situation after the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] returned from Thorngap carrying the [[red musk zombie|red musk disease]]. Guided by the tracker [[Garstrom Toom]], their agents found Thorn Hollow and looked for Halsaime, instead finding corrupted druids and monsters. Several "corruption nodes" were scattered about the caverns, trapping the resident [[bear]]s in their dens with red musk seeds that drove them into a maddened rage. After eliminating the corruption nodes and their druidic defenders, the adventurers found the dying Carm Woodrusk, who had resisted Halsaime's power and paid the price for it. With her last breath she revealed that Halsaime was hidden at the nearby [[Druid's Deep]], sending the Harpers on one last mission.
