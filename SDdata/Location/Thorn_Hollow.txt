Thorn Hollow was a group of shallow caves in Thorngap, a druidic circle in the Kings Forest of Cormyr. It was briefly taken over by the druid Halsaime and used as a stronghold in the mid-1480s DR.
The Hollow was a series of caverns, tunnels, and open spaces in the depths of the Kings Forest.
Halsaime made his home there, along with the druids Garick, Flinbeck, Thomren, Larres, Drien, and Carm Woodrusk. They lived alongside a number of wolves, bears, dire bears, and other animals. During his madness, the caverns became filled with red musk zombies and vine horrors, and the animals were driven into a frenzy.

During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the druid Halsaime received a powerful cursed staff from his friend Oriphaun Huntsilver. Oriphaun had taken it from a Shadovar agent he killed while protecting the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll, and correctly identified that it was a dangerous artifact best handled by the wise. Unfortunately, Halsaime was overcome by a furious madness and used the staffs power to twist nature and his fellow foresters into a force to conquer the world with.
The Harpers Kirinel Zay, Tarim Inavule, and Jussko Kwahn investigated the situation after the ranger Peron Uthe returned from Thorngap carrying the red musk disease. Guided by the tracker Garstrom Toom, their agents found Thorn Hollow and looked for Halsaime, instead finding corrupted druids and monsters. Several "corruption nodes" were scattered about the caverns, trapping the resident bears in their dens with red musk seeds that drove them into a maddened rage. After eliminating the corruption nodes and their druidic defenders, the adventurers found the dying Carm Woodrusk, who had resisted Halsaimes power and paid the price for it. With her last breath she revealed that Halsaime was hidden at the nearby Druids Deep, sending the Harpers on one last mission.
