        "Description": "Gatajima, under the nominal control of [[Kanshu]], was an island characterized by its windswept terrain and notable absence of harbors. Encircled by steep cliffs and perilous rocks, it posed a challenging obstacle for anyone attempting to access its shores. Only experienced sailors well-versed in navigating the surrounding waters could navigate past the rocky surf to reach its hidden shores.",
        "Inhabitants": "Precisely due to its formidable nature, Gatajima has become a favored sanctuary for those seeking refuge and seclusion. Over time, Gatajima has served as a hiding place for [[wako]] pirates and other outlaws, who have occasionally stored their ill-gotten treasures within its confines."
