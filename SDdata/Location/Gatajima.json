        "mainbody": "Gatajima was an island located in Kozakura.\nGatajima, under the nominal control of Kanshu, was an island characterized by its windswept terrain and notable absence of harbors. Encircled by steep cliffs and perilous rocks, it posed a challenging obstacle for anyone attempting to access its shores. Only experienced sailors well-versed in navigating the surrounding waters could navigate past the rocky surf to reach its hidden shores.\nPrecisely due to its formidable nature, Gatajima has become a favored sanctuary for those seeking refuge and seclusion. Over time, Gatajima has served as a hiding place for wako pirates and other outlaws, who have occasionally stored their ill-gotten treasures within its confines."
