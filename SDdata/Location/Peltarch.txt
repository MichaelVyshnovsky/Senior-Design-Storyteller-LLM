'''Peltarch''' was the only permanent town of any size in [[Narfell]] as of [[1479 DR]], with most of the inhabitants being [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] of the [[Ulyoon]] tribe.

==Geography==
The town was located on the southern shore of [[Icelace Lake]] and was constructed from the masonry of Old Peltarch to the north of the current settlement.

==Trade==
Peltarch traded with many foreigners, as the few caravans that took the route over the frozen ice of the Icelace Lake in winter, instead of the far more dangerous [[Giantspire Gap]], came to this settlement to do their trade. This made them wealthier than the rest of their kinsmen, who in turn considered them outlanders.
