        "mainbody": "Chondath was a country located in the Vilhon Reach. It had a long history. It was located on what once was the psiocracy of Jhaamdath on the shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Chondath was later a confederation of city-states under the capital of Arrabar, but used to be a powerful nation in times long past.\nAll of Chondath was ruled by Eles Wianar, the Lord of Arrabar. He resided in the Generon, a large palace located in the capital.\nChondathans were primarily traders, often dealing with far-off lands. They were also a somewhat warlike people and distrusted wizards and magic altogether.\nWaukeen, the goddess of trade, was heavily worshiped here. Other important gods were Helm, god of guardians Lliira, goddess of joy Malar, god of the hunt Talos, god of storms and Tempus, god of war.\nTraditional Chondathan chairs were constructed to have very distinct high backs.\nChondalwood A large forest south of Chondath that was inhabited by elves, satyrs, and centaurs.\nthumb\nChondath was a country with a fabled past, once the site of a mighty empire ruling over much of the Vilhon Reach, Sembia, and arguably Westgate all under the control of the Chondathan Illistine family. It was formed from a confederation of city-states in the  during a brutal war with the elves of nearby Chondalwood.\nContinuing the war with elves, Chondath under the ruler Laviar Illistine sent a force of 10,000 soldiers into the Chondalwood. They are massacred, with scarce 200 soldiers returning alive.\nSometime before the  the cities of Chondathan and Chauncelgaunt were founded by Chondathan colonists in Sembia. Over time these colonies became known as Saerloon and Selgaunt, respectively.\nIn the  the Chondathan city of Mussum was hit by a mysterious plague, which killed more than three quarters of the population in less than a day, and the city was abandoned.\nSoon after, Hlondeth regained its independence from Chondath.\nCivil war broke out in Chondath in the  and, following two years of bitter Rotting War, the city-states of Chondathan, Chancelgaunt, Following foul plagues imbued the magic of the lower planes sweeping across the empire, unleashed by the war, the Chondathan empire broke apart.\nCirca 1017 DR, exodus of several grand mercenary companies from the Vilhon Reach elected to leave Chondath, being fed up by conflicts, wars, and bloodshed. The mercenaries though Chondath to be honor-less and along with their families, traveling hospitals, mobile sanctuaries, and courts, slowly traveled the continent until they reached the unclaimed lands on the north-western shores of the Akanamere. With time the yellow rolling hills and valleys of scattered ruins were turned into militaristic yet bloodless Blade Kingdoms.\nChondath regained some measure of its former power in the , in part by lending mercenaries to the power struggles in Chessenta\nIn the , as part of the Spellplague unleashed the previous year, great swaths of Chondath and western Chessenta were catastrophically exchanged with parts of the world of Abeir, from the land of Shyr. Several Chondathan cities were destroyed, left high on peaks or at the bottoms of ravines. Meanwhile, the draining of the Sea of the Fallen Stars lowered the sea level of Vilhon Reach, exposing new lands and Jhaamdathan ruins. Surviving genasi from Shyr soon formed the kingdom of Akan√ªl.\nArrabar The capital of Chondath was an ancient city with a large portion of Chondaths army.\nHlath A busy port city that exported much of the regions lumber.\nIljak Another port city in Chondath.\nShamph This thriving city benefited greatly from the war between Hlath and Iljak.\nMussum This plague-ridden ruin was known for the House of Holy Suffering temple which lay near or in it."
