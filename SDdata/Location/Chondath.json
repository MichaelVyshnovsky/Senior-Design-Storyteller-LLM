It was formed from a confederation of city-states in the {{YearlinkName|144}} during a brutal war with the elves of nearby [[Chondalwood]].<ref name = \"GHotR-p63\">\n\nContinuing the war with elves, [[Chondath]] under the ruler [[Laviar Illistine]] sent a force of 10,000 soldiers into the [[Chondalwood]]. They are massacred, with scarce 200 soldiers returning alive.<ref name = \"GHotR-p68\">\n\nSometime before the {{YearlinkName|400}} the cities of Chondathan and Chauncelgaunt were founded by Chondathan colonists in [[Sembia]]. Over time these colonies became known as [[Saerloon]] and [[Selgaunt]], respectively.<ref name = \"GHoTR-p73\">\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|472}} the Chondathan city of Mussum was hit by a mysterious plague, which killed more than three quarters of the population in less than a day, and the city was abandoned.<ref name = \"GHoTR-p88\">\n\nSoon after, [[Hlondeth]] regained its independence from Chondath.<ref name = \"GHoTR-p93\">\n\nCivil war broke out in Chondath in the {{YearlinkName|900}} and, following two years of bitter [[Rotting War]], the city-states of Chondathan, Chancelgaunt,<ref name = \"GHoTR-p109\" /> Following foul plagues imbued the magic of the lower planes sweeping across the empire, unleashed by the war, the Chondathan empire broke apart.<ref name = \"GHoTR-p109\">\n\n''Circa'' [[1017 DR]], exodus of several grand mercenary companies from the Vilhon Reach elected to leave Chondath, being fed up by conflicts, wars, and bloodshed. The mercenaries though Chondath to be honor-less and along with their families, traveling hospitals, mobile sanctuaries, and courts, slowly traveled the continent until they reached the unclaimed lands on the north-western shores of the [[Akanamere]]. With time the yellow rolling hills and valleys of scattered ruins were turned into militaristic yet bloodless [[Blade Kingdoms]].{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}}\n\nChondath regained some measure of its former power in the {{YearlinkName|1150}}, in part by lending mercenaries to the power struggles in [[Chessenta]]<ref name = \"GHoTR-p121\">\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1386}}, as part of the [[Spellplague]] unleashed the [[1385 DR|previous year]], great swaths of Chondath and western Chessenta were catastrophically exchanged with parts of the world of [[Abeir]], from the land of [[Shyr]].{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Spellplague: The Wailing Years}} Several Chondathan cities were destroyed, left high on peaks or at the bottoms of ravines. Meanwhile, the draining of the Sea of the Fallen Stars lowered the sea level of Vilhon Reach, exposing new lands and Jhaamdathan ruins. Surviving genasi from Shyr soon formed the kingdom of [[Akan√ªl]].",
