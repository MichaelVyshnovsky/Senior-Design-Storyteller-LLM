        "mainbody": "Cormanthor, also known as the Old City, formerly as Ahkiilor or \"place of duty\", was the oldest ward in the city of Myth Drannor.\nThe ward was the seat of power for the Coronal of Cormanthyr, along with the arms-major and spell-major, commanders of the AkhVelahr and AkhFaer respectively.\nAlong with these military leads, the ward served as home to many of the citys high mages, as well as its noble families. Among the many noble elven families that kept an estate in the city were the houses Ammath, Dahast, Hawksong, Irithyl, Khaalvandar, Maerdrym, Mistrivvin, Moonglamer, Neirdre, Omberdawn, Raedrimn, Silverspear, Starym, and Ulondarr.\nWhile there were no official regulations that excluded non-elves from the ward, many of the Old Citys residents took action to keep them away from the area. The noble elves took subtle actions to make those residents unwelcome, while the amrathors of the Coronal Guard enforced an unofficial curfew, by escorting non-elves from the ward in the hours after dusk.\nThe Old City was located on the northern side of the city, adjacent to the citys other wards.\nIt was bordered to the south and west by the Street of Evening Star, and the east by the Bridge of Heroes.\nThe ward included the stretch of Oacenths stream north of Tilvers dam.\nLandmarks\n* Castle Cormanthor, the ancient stone-and-crystal fortress that first rose from the earth when the first of the Elfblades was drawn out of the ground in Cormanthor.\n* Dragondark Tower, one of the citys many schools of wizardry.\n* The Onaglym, the \"House of Gems\" that served as the guildhall for the Gemcutters and Jewellers Guild in the city.\n* Silversgate, the magical stone archway that served as a portal to the Silverymoon Pass\n* Ursplindaar, the four-story fortress-library built upon the ground level.\nFesthalls, Inns & Taverns\n* Saunders Halls, the inn built  above the ground among the trees of the forest.\n* Serpentspires, a particularly lavish festhall owned by Onharr the Scalebright.\nResidences\n* Gargoyles Hall, home to the disgruntled half-elf archmage Joylith Dlanyr.\n* Jendarks Tower, a rather nondescript wizard tower.\n* Khaalvandar, the grand treetop manse of the royal Irithyl family.\n* Omberdawn Villa,an expansive multi-tiered villa that became a festering swamp after the fall of the city.\nShops\n* Blackbuckles Wines & Tonics, the halfling-owned spirits shop that was popular among the citys soldiers.\n* Samblars Swords, a smithy that in bladed weapons influenced by both elven and dwarven artisans.\nTemples\n* House of Song, the fortress-temple of Oghma that boasted the greatest collection of written lyrics, fabled ballads, and other songs in the entirety of the Cormanthyrian empire.\n* Temple of Sehanine Moonbow, the open air temple to the elven Goddess of Moonlight."
