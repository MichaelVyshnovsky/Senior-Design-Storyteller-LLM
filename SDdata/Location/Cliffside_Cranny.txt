The '''Cliffside Cranny''' was a hole in [[Luskan|Luskan's]] wall created by an earthquake that occurred around [[1460 DR]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|400}}  The cranny was assessable by foot or boat and served as an unofficial city gate.  In [[1480 DR]] the cranny was guarded by [[Waterdeep|Waterdavian]] guardsmen assigned to keep plague victims from leaving Luskan.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|472}}
