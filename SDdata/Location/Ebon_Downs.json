        "mainbody": "he Ebon Downs were a burial ground deep within the Silverwisp Swamp, just south of the southern High Road.\nDeathjump spiders were known to lurk around this area.\nHistorically, the Ebon Downs served as a burial site for the inhabitants of the village of Grimhollow.\nSometime in the late 15 century DR, a Netherese necromancer known as Idris made pacts with a number of wights within the cemetery known as the Barrow Lords to form an army capable of striking against Thay and to lay siege to the Sword Coast. With the help of a powerful artifact called Deathknell, he raised many undead from this site that went on to overwhelm Grimhollow, adding more to their ranks.\nNews of the rising undead eventually reached Lord Neverember, who proceeded to dispatch a contingent of the Neverwinter Guard to counter the threat. That contingent flew the banner of Kelemvor and was led by a doomguide named Vesper Soulhearth. They fought bravely, but being ill-prepared the contingent ultimately fell at the hands of the Barrow Lords. Only Vesper managed to survive and flee to a nearby temple to Kelemvor for safety. Later Lord Neverember would task a group of adventurers to travel down to the Ebon Downs in search of Vesper and her lost contingent.\nWhen those adventurers arrived, they found that the Barrow Lords were assaulting the temple of Kelemvor with a horde of bone golems and zombies."
