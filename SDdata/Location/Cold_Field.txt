The '''Cold Field''' was a flat, treeless moor located south of [[Cormanthor]] and [[Velarswood]] between [[Harrowdale]] and [[Scardale]].

==Description==
The Cold Field was a battlefield haunted by ghosts of soldiers. The land was scarred by [[dragon breath|dragon's breath]]. It was most dangerous in winter. In summertime, shepherds from the local dales used the field as pasture for their sheep, since the animals didn't mind the restless spirits.

==History==
The Cold Field was the site of a great battle and was therefore haunted by ghosts. [[Mathira Melarn]], an [[Eilistraee]]an priestesses and bearer of the [[Crescent Blade]], was slain here and the blade wound up in the gullet of a [[purple worm]]. The blade was retrieved in [[1372 DR]] by [[Halisstra Melarn]] and [[Ryld Argith]]; Halisstra then carried the blade to the [[Demonweb Pits]], intending (but failing) to slay [[Lolth]].
