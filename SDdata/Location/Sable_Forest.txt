The '''Sable Forest''' was located on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] near the [[City of Brass]]. 

==Description==
The Sable Forest was filled with large black trees called serpent trees. These trees were usually bare of leaves, taking their nourishment from heat instead of light.

==Activities==
[[Noble efreeti]] held hunts in the Sable Forest on a daily basis. Any unwelcome trespassers often found themselves run down by savage [[hell hound]]s.
