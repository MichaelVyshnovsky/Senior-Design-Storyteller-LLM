'''Ruathym''' ({{pronounce|ROO|uh|thim|refs=

==Geography==
Ruathym was located to the south of [[Holgerstead]], another settlement on the island, and close to the magical ruins of [[Inthar]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, the ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'' brought [[Liriel Baenre]] and her companion [[Fyodor]] to the island, where they hoped to harness the rune magic of [[Yggdrasil's Child]]. They stayed in Ruathym for some time, investigating suspicious disappearances and deaths of local fishermen and others. Liriel defeated the [[drow]] [[banshee]] at Inthar and discovered that [[Dagmar]], the daughter of [[Ulf]] the Shaman, was betraying her people to the [[Kraken Society]]. Liriel eventually discovered and defeated a conspiracy by [[Luskan]] and the Kraken Society.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Green Room]], a library.
* [[Hall of Black Waves]], a temple to [[Umberlee]] run by a tribal [[shaman]] named [[Uther Jeroggean]] in [[1358 DR]].
* [[Trelleborg]] barracks, where single men lived after leaving their families. Women were forbidden to enter.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Dagmar]], daughter of Ulf and twin of Ygraine; betrayed her people to the Kraken Society and died in [[1361 DR]].
* [[Hrolf]] the Unruly, pirate captain of the ''Elfmaid''.
* [[Ulf]] the Shaman of Ruathym town.
* [[Ygraine]], daughter of Ulf and twin of Dagmar; prophesied to be the one to return the magic of ''[[hamfriggan]]'' shapeshifters to Ruathym.
