'''Ormpur''', or in the local vernacular '''"Ormpar"''', and known as the '''City of Saffron''', was an independent city-state on the northeastern edge of [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]]. It was one of the [[Cities of the Seabreeze]], and was often treated as part of the realm of Lapaliiya.<ref group="note">Although Ormpur is described as an independent city-state with a history distinct from that of Lapaliiya, it is included in sections about Lapaliiya, in [[Shining South (sourcebook)|''Shining South'' (2004)]] and ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]''. It also has shared culture, such as the civic deities, the term "chansreena" for a princess, and the dominant Tashalan human ethnicity. It is unknown to what extent Ormpur shares the history and culture of Lapaliiya and what it does not have in common. Please see the main [[Lapaliiya]] article for history and culture that Ormpur may or may not share.

==Geography==
[[File:Lapaliiya 2e.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Lapaliiya, showing Ormpur at the northern edge.]]
The city stood at the eastern tip of the [[Shining Sea]], at the head of [[Ormpur Bay]] It lay at the northwestern end of the range called the [[Wormbones]] and the edge of the [[Shaar]] From Ormpur, trails led south to [[Sheirtalar]] in Lapaliiya, northwest to [[Theymarsh]] and northeast to [[Derlusk]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]].

A pebble beach lay on the coast north of Ormpur.

==Economy & Trade==
Ormpur was named the City of Saffron for good reason. Ormpur Bay was the only place in [[Faerûn]] where the [[crocus]] flower grew in abundance. From this flower, the rare [[spices|spice]] [[saffron]] was produced in Ormpur. The city kept a reserve stockpile of this valuable and much-sought-after spice, as well as stocks of other spices, all well guarded.

==History==
===Early History===
Early in its history, Ormpur established a long-running alliance with a clutch of [[chromatic dragon]] [[wyrmling]]s and formed a cavalry mounted on them. They allowed Ormpur to remain independent and grow strong.

In the age of the [[Shoon Imperium]], [[Qysara]] [[Shoon V]] ([[281 DR|281]]–[[300 DR]]) demanded that the Cities of the Seabreeze host garrisons of imperial soldiers. In the [[285 DR|Year of Wasteful Pride, 285 DR]], the Shoon Imperium snatched control of Lapaliiya, then launched the [[Tashalar Campaigns]], conquering the cities as possessions of the Shoon Imperium. But through shrewd diplomatic maneuvering in the imperial court and the tacit threat of the wyrmling cavalry, Ormpur kept its independence, even if in name only.

''Circa'' [[995 DR]], five mages somewhere fought over the ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]''. Their spell-battle left one changed and trapped in the form of a stone, and lying somewhere amongst thousands of like stones on the pebble beach north of Ormpur.

In the [[1142 DR|Year of the Sword's Oath, 1142 DR]], the [[Coiled Cabal]], a group of [[yuan-ti pureblood]] mages, attempted to reconquer the Cities of the Seabreeze. They were opposed by over two dozen [[archmage]]s of Lapaliiya and [[Tashluta]], who fought first the yuan-ti, then each other as they vied for their own power. For a full season, in a conflict called the [[Rage of Wizards]], they waged wild [[spell]] battles up and down the [[Tashtan Coast]]. By its end, the cities of Lapaliiya and the [[Tashalar]] had suffered gratuitous destruction, but not one wizard or yuan-ti had won a single crown. Disgusted, for centuries after the Lapaliiyans and Ormpurrans would see wizards with suspicion and instead treat the clergies with much greater respect, leading to the establishment of the civic faiths, as well as the faith-based relations between the cities.<ref group="note">Although it is unknown whether Ormpur was affected by the Rage of Wizards, it has the same (but softened) custom of a civic faith that in Lapaliiya arose out of the Rage of Wizards, suggesting Ormpur was affected too.

Once, a legendary bandit lord of Lapaliiya called [[Felingar]] stole a chansreena of Ormpur, together with her dowry, as she journeyed to her wedding to an important [[archmage]] of [[Halruaa]].

===Modern History===

}}
In the 13th century [[DR]], Ormpur was ruled by High Suikh [[Naether]]. He was succeeded by his nephew, [[Askulder]], known as the "Hand of Tiamat". Both were served by the court fool [[Jeremmer Hardree]], called the Mad Jester for his bold tongue. Askulder adopted a foster daughter, [[Maerildarraine]], who would be declared Chansreena of Ormpur.{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|97}}

On [[Kythorn 12]] in the [[1306 DR|Year of Thunder, 1306 DR]], High Suikh Askulder was murdered by his own foster daughter, Chansreena Maerildarraine. She seized the throne and declared herself Queen of Ormpur, then led her loyal knights to plunder and burn the temple of Tiamat, but the flames spread through the city. This outrageous act triggered a holy war, and by the end of the day, hundreds lay dead. To Ormpurrans, this shocking day would be known ever afterward as "[[Bloodsword]]". Nevertheless, the jester Jeremmer continued to served Queen Maerildarraine too.

Supported by the [[church of Tiamat]], [[Helbareim Alanasker|Helbareim "the Storm Wind" Alanasker]] eventually deposed Queen Maerildarraine. She died fighting in her own throne room, and the fool Jeremmer was grievously wounded defending her, but survived in the care of priests. Helbareim then became High Suikh himself. However, Ormpur would not recover; once a great city-state, these internal conflicts saw its power wane, leaving it a weakened realm.

Then, in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Helbareim's daughter and only heir, Chansreena (princess) [[Alabhansree Alanasker]], went missing from Ormpur. Also missing were many magical blades that had been kept hidden in secret storage niches in the palace, and a large amount of [[saffron]], comprising Ormpur's entire reserve, as well as other spices, a fortune intended as the Chansreena's dowry. Obsessed with finding her, Helbareim spent a good deal of the city's treasury in efforts to locate and retrieve Alabhansree, all without success. He first suspected several notorious thieves: [[Hoond]] of [[Shussel]], [[Veldyn Uruin|Veldyn "the Fingers" Uruin]], and even the adventurer [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]]. The whole Ormpurian court believed the thief had originated from the [[North]], and Ormpurian agents in [[Waterdeep]] hunted for information in that city and all along the [[Sword Coast]]. Rumors in Sword Coast ports suggested they'd taken a ship to [[Mintarn]] or the [[Moonshae Isles]]. Later, based on false reports, he hired a number of adventuring companies to raid the slave pits of [[Llurth Dreier]], a [[drow]] city in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Shaar]]. However, he would not find a single clue to her true fate, and these failures broke his spirit.

Helbareim's deteriorating state continued the decline of Ormpur begun by the war. Ormpur was steadily succumbing to the influence of the Overkings of Lapaliiya by [[1373 DR]].

By [[1374 DR]], Helbareim still reigned amongst this swirl of influence. It was considered possible that Overking [[Shaliim Wyrmslayer]] of Lapaliiya might propose an alliance, raising Helbareim's political power in exchange for the church of Tiamat's influence over [[dragon]]s to protect Shaliim against the [[Black Wyrms]].''[[Dragons of Faerûn]]'', page 74, apparently mistakenly mixes up Shaliim's and Helbareim's problems, saying the Black Wyrms want revenge against Helbareim, when ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]'' page 103 already established their threat to Shaliim. This article writes the most likely situation.

After the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Ormpur stood, in some form, by [[1479 DR]].<ref><ref group="note">Ormpur appears on the 4th-edition map with the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'', but its status is unknown. It is not listed as ruins, however.

Ormpur was a monarchy, with a ruler titled the High Suikh and a princess called the Chansreena.<ref group="note">''[[Halls of the High King]]'' and [[Polyhedron magazine 057|''Polyhedron'' #57]] give the spelling as "Suihk", while later sources ''Serpent Kingdoms'' and ''Dragons of Faerûn'' use "Suikh", while ''Shining South'' uses both. ''Halls of the High King'' also uses both "Chasreena" and "Chansreena", while the later sources use "Chansreena". The later spellings are adopted for the wiki. Through the mid-to-late 14th century DR, the current High Suikh was Helbareim "the Storm Wind" Alanasker, a devout defender of Tiamat supported by her church. However, with his daughter and sole heir missing, he was the last of his line. Broken by her loss, he was a target for influence by various powers and factions, such as the Overking of Lapaliiya, and the Eselemas and Se'Sehen yuan-ti, who inserted corrupted courtiers into his confidence.

The city was also home to a number of noble families. One, at least, was in fact a cabal of [[beholder]] mages. They were outcasts of the [[Alimir Hive]] and used [[magic]] to adopt [[human]] form and pass among Ormpurrans.

The royal court included a number of courtiers. A custom of the royal court was the Torch Court, a brief daily session held just before midnight. The full court was in attendance.

}}
The rulers of Ormpur were attended and entertained by a court fool. The most notable was Jeremmer Hardree, the Mad Jester, who served two kings and a queen in the 12th and early 13th centuries DR.

==Relations==
The city had a long-established alliance with a clutch of [[chromatic dragon]] [[wyrmling]]s. With it, they fielded wyrmling-mounted cavalry.Both sources refer to "a clutch of chromatic wyrmlings", that is, baby dragons. However, in 3rd and v.3.5s of D&D, dragons are only counted as wyrmlings for the first five years of life, while the history has this alliance last over fifteen centuries. It's possible the initial wyrmlings of the 2nd century before DR have aged and grown to fully mature [[wyrm]] or [[great wyrm]] status by the 14th century DR, or that a local dragon or dragon family continues to loan its young from each clutch to Ormpur. Furthermore, wyrmlings vary in size over Tiny, Small, and Medium, and are generally too small to ride; only the Medium-sized [[red dragon]] wyrmling could feasibly be ridden by a human. It is unclear what threat the wyrmlings pose, other than their cuteness.

Despite being an independent city-state, Ormpur's waning power left it weak and succumbing to the influence of the Overkings of Lapaliiya. It was commonly counted as culturally a part of that realm.

As recounted in the records of the royal court, dating back to Ormpur's founding, the [[wild elves]] of the [[Misty Vale (forest)|Misty Vale]] were known to be utterly feral and xenophobic, hunting and slaying all trespassers.

==Religion==
Ormpur had the same tradition of a civic deity as in Lapaliiya, though it was not as stringently applied. Nevertheless, [[Tiamat]] the Dragon Queen was the official civic deity of Ormpur, owing to her church supporting Helbaerim. The royal temple of Tiamat was looted and burned on the day of Bloodsword.

==Population==
Ormpur was a large city of 24,612 people. The [[human]] population was of largely original [[Tashalan]] ethnicity. This was in contrast to the largely [[Shaaran]] population of neighboring Lapaliiya. Unlike Lapaliiya, Ormpur was never invaded by Shaaran nomads, who were instead invited into the markets.
