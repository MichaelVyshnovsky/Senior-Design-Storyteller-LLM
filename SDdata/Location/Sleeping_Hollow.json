        "mainbody": "'''Sleeping Hollow''' was an [[Arn]] settlement on the [[Arnrock]] volcano in the [[Lake of Steam]] through the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The settlement was the closest thing to a town on the island, although it was more appropriate to call it a ramshackle collection of small homes and boarding houses.",
        "History": "Sleeping Hollow was obliterated when the Arnrock erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1386}}.",
        "Notable Locations": "The \"town\" was home to the [[Brazen Buck]], which was not just the only inn and the only tavern, but also the only establishment that catered to non-halflings on the island.",
        "Inhabitants": "Sleeping Hollow&mdash;and indeed the whole Arnrock&mdash;was home to the Arn, a population of interrelated [[Strongheart halfling|strongheart]] [[halfling]] farmers, fishers, and [[copper]]smiths. The island's only permanent non-halfling resident was [[Belathra Kyndle]], the proprietor of the Brazen Buck."
