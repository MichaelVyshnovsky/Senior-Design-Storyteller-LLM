The Foreign Quarter was the section of Zhentil Keep that was separated from the rest of the city by the River Tesh during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The Foreign Quarter was located on the south bank of the River Tesh where it met the Moonsea.
Like the other sections of Zhentil Keep, a protective wall surrounded the entire area. Access to the quarter by land was allowed through the River Trail Gate in the west and the Throat Gate in the east. Traffic from Zhentil Keeps Common Quarter and Harbor District was achieved via the Force Bridge and Tesh Bridge.
All non-Zhent traffic from both land and sea passed through the Foreign Quarter. Many of the inns, taverns, and feasthalls here were owned by the various Lords of Zhentil Keep.
The Foreign Quarter was the only section of Zhentil Keep to avoid the complete and utter destruction when Cyrics forces attacked in the . This occurred because orcs resentful of their treatment by the Zhentilar abandoned the main city and destroyed the two bridges, effectively shielding the Foreign Quarter from attack.
Zhentilar guardposts, barracks, and armories were situated throughout the entire quarter.
