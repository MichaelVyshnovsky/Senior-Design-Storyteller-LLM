The '''Foreign Quarter''' was the section of [[Zhentil Keep]] that was separated from the rest of the city by the [[River Tesh]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Foreign Quarter was located on the south bank of the River Tesh where it met the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]].

==Description==
Like the other sections of Zhentil Keep, a protective wall surrounded the entire area. Access to the quarter by land was allowed through the [[River Trail Gate]] in the west and the [[Throat Gate]] in the east. Traffic from Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Common Quarter|Common Quarter]] and [[Zhentil Keep/Harbor District|Harbor District]] was achieved via the [[Force Bridge]] and [[Tesh Bridge]].

==Activities==
All non-[[Zhent]] traffic from both land and sea passed through the Foreign Quarter. Many of the [[inn]]s, taverns, and feasthalls here were owned by the various Lords of Zhentil Keep.

==History==
The Foreign Quarter was the only section of Zhentil Keep to avoid the complete and utter destruction when [[Cyric]]'s forces attacked in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. This occurred because [[orc]]s resentful of their treatment by the Zhentilar abandoned the main city and destroyed the two bridges, effectively shielding the Foreign Quarter from attack.

==Defenses==
[[Zhentilar]] guardposts, barracks, and armories were situated throughout the entire quarter.

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Pride of Zhentil Keep]]
* [[Leathercrafter' Guild]]
* [[Rak's Apothecary]]
* [[Tymora's Holy Hall of Good Fortune and Casino]]
* [[Battlehall]]
* The [[Tesh Inn]]
