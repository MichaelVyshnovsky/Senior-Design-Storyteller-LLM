        "mainbody": "Arthoum was the smallest of the islands west of the shores of the fortress library of Candlekeep on the Sword Coast.\nArthoum was similar to all seven islands west of Candlekeep. It was a rocky outcropping that rose above the Sea of Swords. It was a collection of fissured granite with temperate woodlands growing among the cracks. Pools of collected rainwater in rock basins and freshwater springs could be found on the island. Most of the island was barren and dotted with sea caves and geyser-like blowholes that released clouds of steam and water mist in fumes that darted up into the air from the crevices during storms. Its rocky southern shores were suitable for hauling ashore large marine vessels.\nArthoums northern shores were awash by Skoonds Run, which separated it from the large island of Thelve and three of its southern sisters. Arthoum was the smallest and westernmost of the three, the others being Nairns Tomb and Askalet. Arthoum laid  south of Thelve and just  away from Nairns Tomb.\nArthoums rocks housed an impressive seabird population of thousands, and its rocks were marked by the birds guano. Several species of predatory sea creatures could also be found on the island.\nThe origin of the islands name was lost to the ages. However, sages believed that Arthoum and its other six sibling islands were all named after sailors and settlers who claimed these lands in the long-forgotten past."
