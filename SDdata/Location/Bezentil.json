        "mainbody": "Bezentil was a walled trading settlement located in the Great Dale, that was previously considered by the Nars people to be a part of their territory in the countryside of Narfell. It was a town of farmers and outdoorsmen,\nBezentil was easily recognizable by the ten,  tall stone markers that were situated  apart along the road passing through tows. Each of these were inscribed with the symbol of a tree set within a circle.\nBezentil was situated along the Great Road, between the settlements of Uthmere and Kront. \nThe ancient fortress of Val-Murthag was just two days travel away from the town.\nLocal governance was overseen by a village council, led by Kassantra Mufdan, and law enforcement was carried out by Sheriff Trag Finstek and his handful of militiamen.\nThe only business conducted in Bezentil was trade between the locals and those folk passing along the Great Road.\nIt was one of the few locales in the Great Dale that housed a working forge, even if it did not boast particularly skilled metalsmiths.\nBoth Bezentil and the land upon which it was built fell under the protection of the druidic Circle of Leth.\nFor many years leading up to the early 14 century DR, Bezentil was one of the regions numerous \"waymeets\" of the numerous Nars tribes. These large swaths of land situated along elongated worn paths served as the camping grounds for the nomadic, horse-riding people.\nIn the , the Windblown Goat inn was built along the side of the Great Road, attracting folks from the surrounding area. The increased number of visitors led to the towns founding within a short time.\nCirca the , groups of wolves would gather around the towns walls on nights of a full moon, in what came to be known by locals as the Great Howling. The beasts would then carry out a series of attacks on nearby passers-by.\nUnbeknownst to the towns residents, Bezentils stone markers dated back to when only elves lived in the Great Dale and possessed strong conjuration magic within their configuration. Anyone that touched each of the markers at a precise time during the vernal or autumnal equinoxes would be transported via portal to a matching set stone markers in the eastern continent of Kara-Tur, bypassing the perilous Endless Wastes.\n* Divine Den, considered the most important temple to Malar in all of Faer√ªn.\n* Stables and livery, operated by Cassilla Fen. \n* Stricks Trading Post, the general store operated by Gennia and Abrihando Strick.\n* Windblown Goat, the small but welcoming inn around which the town was built."
