'''Kultaakarr''', also called the '''Throne of the Titan Lords''',{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} was a realm of [[giants]] in the [[Cold Lands]] founded in the 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}

==Geography==
The realm was located in northern [[Vaasa]]. It was bordered to the north by the [[Great Glacier]] and the [[Surykyk Range]] mountains, and to the south by the [[Lugsaas Chain]] mountains. It encompassed the [[Sea of Frozen Tears]].

==Government==
Kultaakarr was ruled by [[Titan (disambiguation)|titan]] lords from their provisional capital of [[Baunilorotha]] on the northern coast of the Sea of Frozen Tears.

==Defenses==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the titans had begun raising an army that had the potential to destabilize the region.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}} Their frost giant warriors and berserkers favored [[greataxe]]s while their spellcasters favored [[flail]]s and ice [[magic]],{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|11-12.14-15}} and could summon mighty [[frost titan]]s.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|10}}

==History==
In the distant past, Kultaakarr was a subkingdom of [[Ostoria]] and was lost beneath the ice with the advance of the Great Glacier around {{yearlink|-2550}}. Once the Glacier began to retreat after [[1038 DR]], giants began returning to the region in increasing numbers.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|5}}

From Kultaakarr, [[frost giant]]s explored the Great Glacier and sought the ruins of [[Iyraclea’s palace]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}},{{4e-time}} a band of [[Auril]]-worshiping frost giants were called to these ruins by a [[Zhengyian artifact]], and slew a band of [[Banite]] Warlock Knights who were likewise seeking this artifact. 

Tensions remained between the Warlock Knights and Kultaakarr, although this had yet to escalate into war as of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}. By this time, the titans were also opposed by the [[gold dragon]] [[Tamarand]], the [[King of Justice]].

A decade or so later, [[Annam All-Father]] broke the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]], thus throwing the hierarchies of all giant communities in [[Faerûn]] into chaos.
