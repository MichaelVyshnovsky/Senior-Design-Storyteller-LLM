The '''Starn''' was a valley somewhere in [[Faerûn]]. It was rural land by the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The valley was crossed by the [[Larrauden]] river, and the [[Gar's Road]] entered it from the east. Opposite from the entrance lay a keep, the [[Shrine of the Sheaf]]. A town, [[Buckralam's Starn]], lay between them, and there were a number of farms surrounding.

==Government==
The valley was briefly dominated by the [[Iron Fox]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point, the [[bard]] [[Talost]] visited the Starn Valley, and described Buckralam's Starn, perhaps not very kindly. Around {{yearlink|753}}, a local band of adventurers, [[Taver's Talons]], were slain in battle with a [[dragon]].

In {{yearlinkName|755}}, the local town of Buckralam's Starn came under the control of a bandit known as the Iron Fox, who took the Shrine of the Sheaf as his fortress, renaming it Fox Tower. He was later defeated and removed by [[Elminster Aumar]], a wandering [[Chosen of Mystra]], with the help of a local woman, [[Immeira]].
