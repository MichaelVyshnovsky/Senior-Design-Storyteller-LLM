        "mainbody": "he Dancing Haven was a shrine dedicated to the drow goddess Eilistraee, located in the Northern Ward of the city of Waterdeep, in 1491 DR. It was a sister temple to the reclaimed Promenade of the Dark Maiden, found near Skullport.\nThe Dancing Haven was originally meant to be a forest-temple to Eilistraee that should have replaced a block of abandoned buildings in the Field Ward of Waterdeep. Later developments prevented the creation of the forest in that area, and the project was therefore moved to the Northern Ward.\nThe Dancing Haven was a small tree grove, planted and grown within an abandoned, roofless building in the Northern Ward of Waterdeep. It was used as a base of operations for the followers of Eilistraee in the city.\nAfter her return in the 1480s DR, during the Second Sundering, the drow goddess Eilistraee was seen dancing and speaking to mortals in many places, especially along the Sword Coast. Waterdeep was one of such places in 1491 DR, the Dark Maiden appeared dancing under the walls of the city, up the road to Amphail.\nAfter the event, many of her followers traveled to the City of Splendors with the goal of creating a forest-shrine dedicated to the goddess, and establishing a presence in the city. They persuaded Remallia Haventree, the Waterdhavian Harper representative, to offer her support to the endeavor. The new influx of drow in Waterdeep also caused some taverns to hold drow-themed shows, with performers painting their skin obsidian and wearing silvery wigs. However, on the other hand, not all Waterdhavians were happy about drow walking free in their cities. For example, some nobles and guildmasters voiced discontent and incredulity towards drow being allowed to have a temple within Waterdeep.\nNonetheless, Remallias support of the followers of Eilistraee persisted, and they started to buy buildings that were part an abandoned, ruined block in the Field Ward, with the goal of demolishing them and create a forest in their place. However, due to the chaotic developments in that area, the Dancing Haven was temporarily moved to the North Ward. The Eilistraeens planted and grew a small grove of trees within an abandoned, roofless building, and then used it as a templeÂ and base of operations. From there, the priestess Trelasarra Zuind led the other moondancers on a series of expeditions to cleanse, rebuild and resupply the Promenade of the Dark Maiden, the headquarters of the Church of Eilistraee, near Skullport. In the 1490s DR, the operations finally led to its restoration. The Promenade and the Dancing Haven became sister temples, providing the followers of the Dark Maiden with a foothold both on the surface and in the Underdark of Waterdeep. Trelasarra wanted to simply engage in the worship of her goddess and uphold her teachings, but she was well aware of the dangers for the newly restored Promenade, and garrisoned the temple as if at war."
