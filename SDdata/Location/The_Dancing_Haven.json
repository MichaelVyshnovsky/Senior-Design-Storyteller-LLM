[[Waterdeep]] was one of such places: in [[1491 DR]], the Dark Maiden appeared dancing under the walls of the city, up the road to [[Amphail]].\n\nAfter the event, many of her followers traveled to the City of Splendors with the goal of creating a forest-shrine dedicated to the goddess, and establishing a presence in the city. They persuaded [[Remallia Haventree]], the Waterdhavian [[Harper]] representative, to offer her support to the endeavor. The new influx of drow in Waterdeep also caused some taverns to hold drow-themed shows, with performers painting their skin obsidian and wearing silvery wigs. However, on the other hand, not all Waterdhavians were happy about drow walking free in their cities. For example, some nobles and guildmasters voiced discontent and incredulity towards drow being allowed to have a temple within Waterdeep.\n\nNonetheless, Remallia's support of the followers of Eilistraee persisted, and they started to buy buildings that were part an abandoned, ruined block in the [[Field Ward of Waterdeep|Field Ward]], with the goal of demolishing them and create a forest in their place.{{cite web\n| url            = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1077302665338634241\n| title          = Ed Greenwood on Twitter\n| accessdate     = 2018-12-24\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date           = 2018-12-24\n}} However, due to the chaotic developments in that area, the Dancing Haven was temporarily moved to the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]]. The Eilistraeens planted and grew a small grove of trees within an abandoned, roofless building, and then used it as a templeÂ and base of operations. From there, the priestess [[Trelasarra Zuind]] led the other [[Church of Eilistraee|moondancers]] on a series of expeditions to cleanse, rebuild and resupply the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]], the headquarters of the [[Church of Eilistraee]], near [[Skullport]].{{cite web |url= https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/legends-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-16?fbclid=IwAR0LWCRcfDa5qfMBSsLD8mWPsi2nwAHTP58gQrecWC5wSswbE3vY2Z0wG4k |title= Personalities from the Forgotten Realms Magic Set |accessdate=2021-07-20 |publisher= Wizards of the Coast}} In the 1490s DR, the operations finally led to its restoration.{{cite web\n| url            = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1234680460543811585\n| title          = Ed Greenwood on Twitter\n| accessdate     = 2020-03-03\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date           = 2020-03-03\n}}{{cite web\n| url            = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/796182273288704000\n| title          = Ed Greenwood on Twitter\n| accessdate     = 2016-11-09\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date           = 2016-11-09\n}} The Promenade and the Dancing Haven became sister temples, providing the followers of the Dark Maiden with a foothold both on the surface and in the [[Underdark]] of Waterdeep. Trelasarra wanted to simply engage in the worship of her goddess and uphold her [[Church of Eilistraee#Eilistraee's Teachings|teachings]], but she was well aware of the dangers for the newly restored Promenade, and garrisoned the temple as if at war.{{cite web\n| url            = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1235039364763115522\n| title          = Ed Greenwood on Twitter\n| accessdate     = 2020-03-04\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date           = 2020-03-04\n}}{{cite web |url= https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/legends-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-16?fbclid=IwAR0LWCRcfDa5qfMBSsLD8mWPsi2nwAHTP58gQrecWC5wSswbE3vY2Z0wG4k |title= Personalities from the Forgotten Realms Magic Set |accessdate=2021-07-20 |publisher= Wizards of the Coast}}"
