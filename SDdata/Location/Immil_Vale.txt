Like much of Rashemen, the valley was protected by the many fey spirits and telthors that were bound to the stones and trees found within.
A single bheur was known to dwell within an abandoned mine that was dug out inside the vale.
To the Rashemaar people the Immil Vale was a place of pure magic and enchantment.

Many people made pilgrimages to the Immil Vale, believing it to be the center of some manner of spiritual network.
