        "mainbody": "elligheim (meaning \"Holy Home\" in the giant language) was an ancient fire giant-ruled kingdom in Faer√ªn, during the Time of Giants of the Dawn Age ( to ).\nThe southern borders of this kingdom stretched along the Dragon Sea.\nIn the year , the fire giants of this kingdom established twelve mighty fortresses along the shore of the Dragon Sea.\nA century later, it would be one of the kingdoms that fought in the Thousand Year War against the ancient dragon kingdoms. Over the course of this war, Helligheim was gradually made isolated from the rest of Ostoria and terribly weakened. One by one the dragons overran and shattered their fortresses along the Dragon Seas coast. By the time the King-Killer Star appeared in the sky, only one remote keep in the Giantspike Mountains remained.\nIt was one of the few fragment kingdoms that survived past Ostorias fall, but within a millennia it eventually fell. By some accounts, only surviving for another century or two. The jotunbrud gradually retreated further into the frozen north, their most powerful runecasters sealing the last remaining keep."
