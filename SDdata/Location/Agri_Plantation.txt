Agri Plantation was the biggest plantation in northern Thay.
Around 1352 DR, Blacklands son Wynter left the plantation his father worked at and left Thay, eventually becoming a Harper.
By 1362 DR Blackland Ironhoof had been running the plantation for some time, making almost all of his slave purchasing in Eltabbar, while the Agri Plantation had a good slave breeding program in place.
