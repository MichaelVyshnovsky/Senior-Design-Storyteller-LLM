'''Agri Plantation''' was the biggest plantation in northern [[Thay]].

==History==
Around [[1352 DR]], Blackland's son Wynter left the plantation his father worked at and left Thay, eventually becoming a [[Harper]].

By [[1362 DR]] Blackland Ironhoof had been running the plantation for some time, making almost all of his slave purchasing in [[Eltabbar]], while the Agri Plantation had a good slave breeding program in place.
