        "mainbody": "The '''Plain of Standing Stones''' was one of the three major subdivisions of the [[Anauroch]] desert. The northern [[Dwarf|dwarves]] called it ''Turlaghh'', the \"Field of Broken Dreams\".",
        "Geography": "Anauroch was divided into three distinct areas, the central of which was the Plain of Standing Stones. To its north was the [[High Ice]], and to the south was the sandy region known as [[the Sword]].\n\nThe mostly waterless region of the Plain was full of gravel and jagged rocks. The area was ravaged by powerful winds, and was almost devoid of trees.\n\nVery little of the region was actually flat plain; much of it rose up as a plateau over the sandy desert to the south. The winds had carved the stone into pillars, spikes, and other strange shapes, and it was full of cliffs, rifts, and rubble.\n\nUnlike in the Sword, the [[Netheril|Netherese]] did not build many settlements here before the [[Fall of Netheril]] and the creation of the desert, so there were not many ruins or buried treasures. However, the mineral wealth of the land was great,",
        "Flora and Fauna": "A few small shrubs and trees managed to survive here, within cracks and ravines. Some of the larger canyons and hidden valleys were actually lush regions. In these latter places, herds of wild sheep and other animals survived.",
        "History": "The Plain of Standing Stones was formed by the same magic that ruined the rest of Anauroch. Before that time, a few significant events occurred in the region.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-3145}}, the great [[arcanist]] [[Ioulaum]] led an army against a horde of [[orc]]s near the southern end of the Plain of Standing Stones.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1205}} ''chardalyn'' was discovered here",
        "Notable locations": {
            "[[Aerithae's Rest]]": "This hidden valley was a secret paradise.",
            "[[Fallen Giant Rift]]": "This cracked and branched canyon was home to [[hill giant]]s.",
            "[[Heroes' Helm]]": "This rock formation looks like a giant helmet.",
            "The [[Hidden Valley of Srindin]]": "This was once the home of a retired [[Elf|elven]] explorer.",
            "The [[Pillar of Tauros]]": "This rock formation towers 100 yards (90 meters) over the surrounding land.",
            "The [[River of Gems]]": "This solitary ice-fed river within Anauroch flowed down from the High Ice.",
            "The [[Shattered Tower (ruins)|Shattered Tower]]": "These ruins of an old, crashed [[storm giant]] [[cloud palace]] rested in the Plains.",
            "The [[Swordpoint (peak)|Swordpoint]]": "This mountain peak was tall and narrow, almost like a needle.",
            "[[The Throat (Anauroch)|The Throat]]": "This huge sinkhole was the at the end of the River of Gems."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "Bands of [[human]] or [[Dwarf|dwarven]] outlaws sometimes managed to survive here, and there were also a few barbarian tribes of [[hill giant]], [[hobgoblin]], human, [[ogre]], or [[verbeeg]] tribes living in caves within some of the hidden ravines and valleys that supported animal life."
