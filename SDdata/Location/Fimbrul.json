        "mainbody": "Fimbrul, also known as the Land of Giants, was a small nation of giants located amid the northern Howling Mountains in Laerakond. Fimbrul was known for its few landmarks and the small communities hidden in the snowy mountains.\nDarrawn was the only proper Fimbran city, the rest of the settlements being small trade moots or strongholds not acknowledged by the giants. Because of that, every settlement was self-sufficient and ruled itself.\nFimbrul was composed mostly by the Howling Mountains range.\n* Blackhold&mdashThe neutral trade moot of Fimbrul.\n* Court of Rorn&mdashThe cave system where slept the Dawn Titan known as Blazing Rorn the Fury.\n*Darrawn&mdashThe only Fimbran city and capital of the giant nation.\n* Dragonbones&mdashA seemingly bottomless chasm where all dragons in Laerakond went to die.\n* Forgefires&mdashA small community of xenophobic dwarves.\n* Glaedorn&mdashA cave full of gemstones and other precious ores.\n* Rimlost&mdashA tower where the followers of the Dawn Titans congregated.\nAfter the War of Fang and Talon, most of the surviving primordials of Abeir went to the Howling Mountains to hide from the wrath of their dragon steeds, and eventually entered into a coma-like sleep. Most of those primordials, such as Blazing Rorn the Fury or Cirotralech, went to hide in the mountains that eventually will become part of Fimbrul.\nIn 1469 DR, a group of oni appeared in Fimbrul and organized the usually scattered Fimbran orc tribes into formidable war bands. The oni then led them against the Fimbran giants."
