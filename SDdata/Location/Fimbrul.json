Most of those primordials, such as Blazing Rorn the Fury or [[Cirotralech]], went to hide in the mountains that eventually will become part of Fimbrul.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|26}}\n\nIn [[1469 DR]], a group of [[oni]] appeared in Fimbrul and organized the usually scattered Fimbran [[orc]] tribes into formidable war bands. The oni then led them against the Fimbran giants."
