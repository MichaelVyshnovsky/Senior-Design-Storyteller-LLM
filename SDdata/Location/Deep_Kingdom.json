        "History": "The Deep Kingdom was established after the fall of [[Telantiwar]] and stood unconquered for generations.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1250}}, the nation of [[Unther]] waged war against both the Deep Kingdom and the elves of the [[Yuirwood]].<ref>\n\nThe [[Thunder Blessing]] filled the caverns of the Deep Kingdom beyond their capacity, so a large number of gold dwarves set out to expand in new lands.\n\nThe reigning monarch of the Deep Kingdom in [[1373 DR]] was [[Karriva Simmerforge|Queen Karriva]] of [[Clan Simmerforge]]. However, the actual power in the Deep Kingdom lay in the hands of the Deep Lords, the governing clan council. Each of the clans had the right to appoint four clan elders to the council, which ruled from some time in the 7th Century DR. Kings, Queens, High Princes, Princes Royal, Axe Princes, Princess, Princess Royal, War Princess, and Duke were just some of the common hereditary more exalted titles which continued to represent the royalty. Due to endless feuds, bickering and internecine wars, and the rising threat of drow and duergar, the Deep Lords were created to maintain unity within the Deep Kingdom. They dispensed justice, commanded the armies, and dictated policy.\n\nWhen the [[Spellplague]] struck Toril in [[1385 DR]], great rifts opened up in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], which in turn caused the collapse of great swathes of land. The [[Underchasm]] formed in [[South Faerûn|southern Faerûn]], devastating the Great Rift, including the Deep Realm and its capital of [[Underhome]]. Many gold dwarves were able to flee the cataclysm through the elemental ''[[portal]]s'' that fed the Riftlake, and others, including the Deep Lords, fled east to the devout city of [[Eartheart]]."
