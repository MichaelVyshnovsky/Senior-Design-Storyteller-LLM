The Fens of the Fallen was a small forest located on the island of Gwynneth within the Moonshae Isles.
The Fens of the Fallen were located in Myrloch Vale along the southeast shore of the Myrloch. The forest was bordered to the south by the Highlands.
The Fens of the Fallen were notoriously dangerous, for it was within this forest where Kazgaroth rose.
