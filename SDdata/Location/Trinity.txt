'''Trinity''' was a long-lived [[Netherese]] community on [[Hidden Lake]] devoted to the worship of [[Amaunator]].

==Geography==
The city sat on the southeastern shores of the lake at the mouth of the [[Cede River]]. Behind it, the [[Hidden Forest]] rose up into the [[Shinantra Mountains]], the source of the Cede River. Northwards lay [[Dahla River City]], and to the east was [[Algid]].

==Trade==
Trinity largely kept to fishing and light farming, with large numbers of religious pilgrims of [[Jannath]] also passing through on the way up the Cede River to the [[Cede Pool]] holy site.

==History==
The settlement was founded in {{YearlinkConvert|1244|NY}} by members of three different [[Amaunatori]] groups that had escaped persecution by [[Sharran]]s. They spent the first year discussing theological matters, ultimately discarding their differences and focusing on what united them. Together, they built a new and unique religious sect, one that did not particularly care for the hierarchical, strict, and legalistic bureaucracy that tended to dominate Amaunatori societies. Instead, they focused more on social cohesion and conscientiousness as virtues, making it by far the most relaxed and friendly Amaunatori city in Netheril.

Netheril's Golden Age ({{Yearlink|-2207}} to {{Yearlink|-1206}}) saw the city flooded with [[Jannathan]] pilgrims passing through to the nearby [[Cede Pool]]. The unorthodox and friendly locals were more than happy to welcome the travelers, and earned quite a bit of coin from them to.

Trinity experienced quiet prosperity during the Age of Discovery ({{Yearlink|-1205}} to {{Yearlink|-697}}). Some decent ore deposits in the Shinantra Mountains were discovered, but were never exploited, and expeditions to find and identify strange, hairy creatures lurking in the highlands produced nothing. Trinity instead found glory in the construction of a great temple to Amaunator in {{YearlinkConvert|3022|NY}}, the [[Temple of Time]].

The Shadowed Age, from {{YearlinkConvert|3163|NY}}, brought omens and portents upon the priests of the Temple of Time. Each potentate experienced dreams of fires, storms, and darkness, with no apparent cause or solution. Although nearby Algid was destroyed by [[phaerimm]]s in {{YearlinkConvert|3374|NY}}, the people of Trinity trusted in the safety of their city, even as the dreams of oncoming doom spread to the wider population. The Temple of Time suddenly began shining brightly with reflected sunlight in {{YearlinkConvert|3420|NY}}, and though it blinded passersby it served as a glorious beacon for Amaunator visible from miles away.

[[Karsus's Folly]] occurred 100 years later in {{YearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}, and the Temple ended its divine glow. The sun was occluded by an eclipse and the sky filled with thunder and lightning, and within only a few hours the entire population of Trinity abandoned the city under the cover of darkness and evacuated towards the south.
