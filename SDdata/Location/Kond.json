        "mainbody": "he community of Kond was carved into the steep cliffs along the southern side of the Clefts of Razack above the Beaumaris River in Vaasa. \nIt served as a stop for trade goods that had been floated down the Beaumaris from Moortown. The folk used an ingenious system of winches and pulleys, along with magic from some warlocks, to get the goods up the  cliff face to the wagons waiting at the rim. \nKond was originally a delve for minotaurs, but they were routed in the  by the Warlock Knights of Vaasa.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, it was a waypoint along the Dead Mans Walk, which scaled up from the canyon floor to the west to the top of the cliffs to the east."
