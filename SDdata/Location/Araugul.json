        "Geography": "At the time of its founding, Araugul lay in the [[Windy Plains]] region of the southern Netheril steppes, midway between the [[Shinantra Mountains]] and the [[Storm Horns]], not far southeast of the cities of [[Kismet]] and [[Rasilith]]. As the Anauroch desert expanded past it, it came be in [[the Sword]] between the [[Quarter of Emptiness]] to the north and the habitable remains of the Goblin Marches to the south.{{Cite interactive atlas|Anauroch}}",
        "History": "The southern frontier of Netheril had long been fought over by tribes of [[goblinoid]]s, [[orc]]s, and other [[humanoid]]s, with the [[goblin]]s becoming the most powerful and entrenched group by the Shadowed Age.{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|23}} The arrival of the mysterious [[Great Hlundadim]] in the {{YearlinkName|-393}}, led to the creation of the nation of Hlundadim and the great fortress of Araugul in the Windy Plains, unifying many disparate groups into an army with a single identity.\n\nDust storms and the desertification of the Windy Plains by [[268 DR]] drove the inhabitants of Araugul into a panic, sending them fleeing south as the land seemed to turn against them. The Great Hlundadim disappeared as well, and the nation of Hlundadim ceased to exist. Over the following centuries Araugul and the lands around it were slowly resettled as the goblinoids and their kin attempted to rebuild what was lost.\n\nThe last great massing of the goblins from Araugul occurred after the warming period that began in [[1038 DR]]. Faced with a drier climate that turned much of the remaining Goblin Marches to dust, the inhabitants of Araugul and nearby regions rallied under the warlord [[Izac Uthor]] and attempted a huge migratory invasion of [[Northwest Faer√ªn|the North]], only to be annihilated in the [[Battle of Bones (battle)|Battle of Bones]] at [[Torgor's Triangle]] and [[Skull Gorge]]."
