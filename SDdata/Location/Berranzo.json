        "mainbody": "erranzo was a failed colony on the western side of the island of Gundarlun in the Trackless Sea.\nIt was originally built by Calishite humans circa 1330 DR for the purposes of mining and refining, and was home to some 2000 people. Wizards here employed fire elementals to refine the ore.\nBut, circa 1333 DR, after only three years of operation, every inhabitant of Berranzo was driven mad and most killed, the reason unknown. For some months thereafter, Northmen captains came across ore ships adrift in the sea, crewed only by gibbering lunatics and the dead, their precious cargos still present.\nThe Berranzo colony was abandoned and left to fall into ruins by 1370 DR, with even the bold local Northmen afraid to venture there.\nCategoryColonies\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryHuman locations\nCategoryLocations on Gundarlun\nCategoryLocations in the Trackless Sea\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n6vexy9dcl5jmgwt2k8js2cc0z5ytkti"
