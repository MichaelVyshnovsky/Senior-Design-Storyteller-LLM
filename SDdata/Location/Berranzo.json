        "History": "It was originally built by [[Calishite]] [[human]]s ''circa'' [[1330 DR]] for the purposes of mining and refining, and was home to some 2000 people. [[Wizard]]s here employed [[fire elemental]]s to refine the ore.\n\nBut, ''circa'' [[1333 DR]], after only three years of operation, every inhabitant of Berranzo was driven mad and most killed, the reason unknown. For some months thereafter, [[Northmen]] captains came across ore ships adrift in the sea, crewed only by gibbering lunatics and the dead, their precious cargos still present.\n\nThe Berranzo colony was abandoned and left to fall into ruins by [[1370 DR]], with even the bold local Northmen afraid to venture there.",
