        "mainbody": "Oeble, previously known as Oeble-town,\nthumb|A 14 century 375x375px\nStreets of Oeble were chaotic and maze-like, twisting and turning around private walled courtyards, tallhouses with looming balconies, swayed into dark bawling alleyways, and homes that rose up to four stories high above stores and businesses on ground floors. Oebles two main streets were Alhans Ride and Vriels Walk that crossed the River Scelptar via bridges (Alhans Span and Vriels Leap, respectively) and sliced the city from north to south. Between Alhans Ride and Vriels Walk stood the citys third bridge – the Arch of Gargoyles, that linked Laskalars Square to the northern side of Scelptar. All three bridges were in chronically poor condition.The map of Oeble featured in Power of Faerûn seems to have erroneous compass rose that was not flipped along with the map. To avoid confusion, the map was flipped to match the position seen in The Black Bouquet novel and to match descriptions and positions of streets described in Polyhedron Newszine.\nThe Dead Kings Walk is a waving street that crossed the city from east to west on Scelptars southern shore. Oebles largest streets began on Laskalars Square. They were The Rolling Shields, that crossed the Sixturrets intersection before reaching the edge of town to the west and Balamonthars Street to the east. Both crossed the Dead Kings Walk before reaching the edges of Oble.\nOver the citys streets stretched the so-called Rainspans. These elevated ways connected the higher-rising buildings of Oebles southern part. These rickety and often crumbling bridges could be found leaping from balconies, windows, and roofs. No building was untouched by Rainspans, including commercial structures like the Griffingate House inn in the heart of Oeble.\nUnderneath Oeble laid its shady subterranean underbelly – the twisting underground ways and tunnels known as the Underways (also known as the \"Lawless Below\" by the locals). Most entrances to the Underways were narrow, claustrophobic stairways, slippery due to blood and refuse, that could often be found in Oebles dark alleyways or building cellars. Most non-human and monstrous populations dwelt in these river-seepaged tunnels. The Underways had inns, taverns, and other businesses, tucked away in their dimly-lit depths. The Underways were constantly expanded, and most of it remained unmapped due to strict local laws. Spies and agents of the Faceless Master monitories entrances to the Underways, so any adventurers or guests of the city could abandon hope to slip into Oebles underbelly unnoticed.\nOeble straddled the River Scelptar west of the Qurth Forest near the center of the Border Kingdoms. It was built on the Great Ford of Scelptar.\nIn the 14 century DR, the rule was in the hands of the Faceless Master and the greedy Council of Nine Merchants who were more effective at bickering and infighting than influencing the ruler. The Faceless Master always listened to the Councils voice but rarely cared for it nor followed it. By 1374 DR, the original Faceless Master was long dead, and his guise and responsibilities were claimed by his female chamber-slave. The Faceless Master impostors true name was unknown, but she possessed a natural gift of mimicry, making most, if not all, never found the rulers identity. Unlike her predecessor, the imposter loved Oeble and sought to protect it from neighing regions attempts at conquest. She was a master manipulator, who manipulated adventurers, groups, enemies, and spread rumors that aided her agenda.\nOebles \"guard\" and police force was the group known as the Gray Blades. The Blades number was over three dozen in the late 14 century DR. Members of the organization were well compensated and consisted of human and half-elven outlaws from outside of Oeble who had skills and appreciated quality consorts, food, wine, and pay, all generously provided by the Faceless Master. The Gray Blades were actively disliked by the citys citizens for their harsh methods and spycraft. In battle, Gray Blades were formidable. They were well-trained in acrobatics, sharpshooting, and deflecting missiles and could anticipate trouble from afar.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the government of Oeble placed a ban on leaping off the Rainspans or causing a creatures fall, as well as dropping or tossing items onto the streets below. However, this law never stopped Oeblaun from dropping deadly missiles, darts, knives, or rocks onto the heads of unlucky targets.\nDespite its laws and police, Oeble greeted every dawn with numerous dead citizens who perished under cover of the night in various violent ways.\nIn the southeastern part of the city were its garbage-middens – where Oeblaun dead were buried in mass graves. Every day the so-called Dead Cart, driven by Hulm Draeridge in the late 14 century DR, patrolled the streets and collected the citys overnight cadavers.\nthumb|Lawlessness on the streets of Oeble.|375x375px\nThe chaotic nature of the city led to a relatively quick turnaround of small businesses that sprang and got extinguished across Oeble. It was very common for businesses to change names and locations every few months. However, some more permanent establishments managed to be stable enough to be known outside the city and even received mention in Volothamp Geddarms famous, or infamous, travel guides.\nYuan-ti of the House Eselemas trafficked slaves and mordayn powder from beneath the town in an area called the Underways. It was from there that they maintained a portal to the city of Essembra in Battledale around the year 1359 DR. Slave trade and fencing of stolen goods were done in the open in the Underways. Persistently, there were rumors of spellcasters dwelling deep in the Underways, who offered permanent facial alteration through magic to those on the run from the law.\nOebles neighbors considered the city to be a \"doorstep danger,\" yet valued it as a neutral ground that separated the Border Kingdoms and their rulers. One of the High Dukes from the Border Kingdoms thought Oeble to be \"too useful to destroy,\" and many shared that opinion well into the late 14 century DR. Despite that, dangers of conquest or subtle domination were ever-present.\nOeble was built as a trading center centuries before the late 14 century DR. Historically, the town was a lawless land, but by the 14 century, it had established code of laws and rulership and policing force. However, as a city, Oeble remained a dangerous and crime-ridden settlement.\nCirca the early-to-mid 14 century DR, a spirit naga named Ssensariith became entangled in an infamous incident known as the Night of Seven Nagas.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Faceless Master of Oeble diffused and broke an annexation attempt by the Talduth Vale through diplomatic negotiations with the Barony of Great Oak and Owlhold. Oeble convinced the Barony of Great Oak and Owlhold to proclaim their support of independent Oeble and insinuate that if Oeble were to be part of the Talduth Vale, both regions would be forced to attack and destroy the city.\nOn Kythorn 11, the , a priceless tome known as The Black Bouquet arrived to Oeble, carried by Miri Buckman of the Red Hart Guild. The book was daringly stolen from her by Aeron sar Randal and his accomplices. The priceless item attracted the attention of Dark Sister Sefris Uuthrakt, a Disciple of the Dark Moon, as well as several crime leaders of Oeble, including the tanarukk leader of the Red Axes – Kesk Turnskull.\n*There existed a prophecy in the Border Kingdoms that a dragon would one day reveal a mighty treasure somewhere in Oeble. Many believed it to be nothing more but an attempt to attract greedy individuals to Oeble, yet those who believed the prophecy pointed out that it predated the city.\nthumb|Rowdy inhabitants of Oebles\"Lawless Below\".|320x320px\n*Griffingate House, a large ornate and old inn in the center of the city and its most imposing structure. \n*Laskalars Square, a city plaza in front of the Griffingate House.\n*Melders Door, a rowdy inn and a tavern in the Underways, directly under the Sixturrets, ran by an enigmatic, dangerous, and eloquent wizard of low morals named Melder in the late 14 century DR. \n*Slarvyns Sword, an expensive eatery on Tarandar Street, connected to the Underways through its cellar.\n*Skulls New and Used, an infamous shop that dealt in magical treasures and relics that stood on Sarl Street and was run by Thoele Raervrun in the late 14 century DR.\n* The Hungry Haunting, a humble eatery in the Underways known for its exotic cheeses, strange alcohols, and mystery meat stews, ran by a fence and skilled masseuse named Imrys Skaltahar in the late 14 century DR.\n*The Paeraddyn, a walled, well-protected, and \"safe\" inn complex that included a bathhouse, stables, gardens, minstrels bower, and a luxurious market advertised as \"A Taste of Oeble.\" The Paeraddyn was secretly owned by the Faceless Master, who profited heavily from its reputation and safety.\n*The Talondance, an expensive tavern in the Underways, named after the clawed hands of its patrons, ran by a lonely scarred mage Naneetha Dalaeve in the late 14 century DR.\nthumb|Just another fray in 400x400px\nOeble was inhabited by outlaws who escaped neighboring or faraway lands, those who did not or could not fit anywhere else, monsters, monstrous humanoids, and a wide variety of black market dealers and rare item traders.
