'''Hap''' was a small village in [[Battledale]], located south of the [[Standing Stone]] halfway between [[Essembra]] and [[Featherdale]], at the base of the former volcano, [[Haptooth Hill]]. It was minor, peaceful settlement inhabited in large part by woodcutters and [[herb]]-growers. Despite its serene nature, it did attract many [[adventurer]]s looking to explore the ruins and tunnel system under Haptooth Hill.

==Defense==
The defense and leadership of Hap was left to War Watcher [[Elphron Pharlyn]], a veteran officer of the [[Lord's Men (Battledale)|Lord's Men]], appointed by Lord [[Ilmeth]]. He had the resources of the Lord's Men or forces of the [[Abbey of the Sword]] at his disposal if requested.

==History==
Hap was once controlled by [[Dracandros]] and his [[drow]] minions until he was overthrown by adventurers.

==Notable locations==
*[[Tower of Dracandros]]: The keep formerly inhabited by Dracandros and his allies rested on the top of Haptooth Hill.

*The [[Millery Inn]]: A small rooming house that served adequate lodgings and food to those who stayed, and some who lived, in Hap.

===Shops===
*[[Delmuth's Barrel]]: This large, and extremely well-stocked, general store was run by a retired, [[dwarven]] warrior.

*[[Glarth's Anvil]]: The smithy of Hap provided rough, but sturdy weapons, armor and other goods made of [[iron]].

*[[Haestar's Woodworks]]: [[Haestar]] and his assistants were among the quickest in the dales to provide semi-finished woodwork.
===Shrines & Temples===
*[[Lathander's Open Hand]]: a small, but bustling, stone chapel dedicated to the [[Lathander|Morninglord]].
*[[Temple of Sune (Hap)|Temple of Sune]]: a small temple dedicated to the goddess of love.
