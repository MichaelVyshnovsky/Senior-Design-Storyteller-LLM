'''Al-Mauqida''', or the '''Hearth''', was the bazaar in the city of [[Liham]] in [[north Zakhara]].

==Description==
The Hearth was named for the multitude of red clothing worn by the roaming citizens of Liham. The marketplace was often clogged with camels and caravans, creating a congested bustle of activity.
