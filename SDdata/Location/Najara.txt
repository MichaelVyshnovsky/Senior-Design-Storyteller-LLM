'''Najara''', a large kingdom in the [[Western Heartlands]], was inhabited by a wide variety of [[naga]]s, [[yuan-ti]], and [[lizardfolk]].

==Geography==
It comprised parts of the [[High Moor]], the [[Forest of Wyrms]], and the [[Marsh of Chelimber]], with the [[Serpent Hills]] lying in the center.

==Government==
Not operating as a typical state, its status as a kingdom is a disputed subject.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1474 DR]], [[Jarant]] killed the previous King of Snakes [[Ebarnaje]], triggering a civil war and increasing yuan-ti and lizardfolk activity in the area. This made Najara more relevant to [[Elturgard]] and [[Evereska]].

Due to more nations gaining knowledge of Najara, it became a subject of interest for its many ancient ruins, including some from the [[Netherese]] empire and the kingdom of [[Boareskyr]].

==Religion==
The main deity of this land was [[Sseth]], but with some yuan-ti becoming increasingly disappointed in him, they turned to the forbidden, worshiping [[Zehir]].

==Geography==

==Locations==
