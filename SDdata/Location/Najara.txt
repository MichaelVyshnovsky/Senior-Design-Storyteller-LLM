Najara, a large kingdom in the Western Heartlands, was inhabited by a wide variety of nagas, yuan-ti, and lizardfolk.
It comprised parts of the High Moor, the Forest of Wyrms, and the Marsh of Chelimber, with the Serpent Hills lying in the center.
Not operating as a typical state, its status as a kingdom is a disputed subject.
Circa 1474 DR, Jarant killed the previous King of Snakes Ebarnaje, triggering a civil war and increasing yuan-ti and lizardfolk activity in the area. This made Najara more relevant to Elturgard and Evereska.
Due to more nations gaining knowledge of Najara, it became a subject of interest for its many ancient ruins, including some from the Netherese empire and the kingdom of Boareskyr.
The main deity of this land was Sseth, but with some yuan-ti becoming increasingly disappointed in him, they turned to the forbidden, worshiping Zehir.
