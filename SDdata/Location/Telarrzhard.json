        "mainbody": "Urvraunt was a Netherese enclave that was destroyed during the Fall, notable for its ultimate distance from Netheril.\nWhen the enclave crashed, it came to a rest in the northern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains above the Utter East, just west of the Yehimal Mountains and northeast of the Kingdom of Nix.\nAfter crashing during Karsuss Folly in , the enclave was ruined but remained partially intact. Due it its immensely remote location, it stayed completely unknown to the wider world through the 15 century DR."
