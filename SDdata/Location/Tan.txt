Tan was a small volcanic island in the Pirate Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
Tan was found just east of Bulta in the eastern region of the Pirate Isles.
This islands central mountain had a large smoking crater and rumbled occasionally.
The natives of Tan were simple fishermen who were quite superstitious of the smoking mountain. Human sacrifice, in a vain attempt to appease the mountain, was not unheard of here.
Despite all of the evidence, Tan was not a volcano, but home to a red dragon named Eshcaz the Red.
