'''Tan''' was a small volcanic island in the [[Pirate Isles]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. 

==Geography==
Tan was found just east of [[Bulta]] in the eastern region of the Pirate Isles.

==Description==
This island's central mountain had a large smoking crater and rumbled occasionally.

==Inhabitants==
The natives of Tan were simple fishermen who were quite superstitious of the smoking mountain. [[Human]] sacrifice, in a vain attempt to appease the mountain, was not unheard of here.

==Rumors & Legends==
Despite all of the evidence, Tan was not a volcano, but home to a [[red dragon]] named [[Eshcaz|Eshcaz the Red]].
