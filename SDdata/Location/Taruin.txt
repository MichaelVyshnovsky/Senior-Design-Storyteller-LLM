'''Taruin''', also known as '''the City of Seven Spices''', was a large city in [[Samarach]].

==Description==
The city stood on the junction of the creeks that merged, forming the [[River Samar]]. Wild jungles of [[Samarlogh]] bordered the city and the trade route that ran east towards the [[Mines of Selgol]].

==Trade==
The City of Seven Spices' name was the result of the rare [[spice]]s that Taruin gathered in the surrounding fields. The City of Seven Spices was the major producer and exporter of [[spice]]s in Samarach. [[Salt]] was imported into the city from [[Selgol]] as numerous salt caravans moved through Taruin towards Samargol.

==Defenses==
Taruin was a walled city that housed a large part of Samarach's armed forces. The city also was one of the settlements that sent out Elite Guard Patrols to secure the jungle nation's trade roads.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Serpent's Demise]], a boisterous inn and tavern that welcomed locals and outsiders alike.
*Shrine of [[Waukeen]], a small but prosperous shrine built after the goddesses' return to the Realms in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
*[[Ottelmar]], a [[wine]] connoisseur who frequented the Serpent's Demise in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Selvar]], a skilled [[wizard]] and famed inventor of ''[[Selvar's Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms]]'' [[spell]] who lived some time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
