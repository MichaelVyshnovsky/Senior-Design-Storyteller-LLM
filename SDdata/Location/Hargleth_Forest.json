        "mainbody": "The Hargleth Forest was a large forest located in eastern Eskorn, Laerakond.\nThis forest was dotted with countless ancient ruins that dated back to the time when Eskorn was ruled by dragons. The area was inhabited only by monsters and outlaws, and all roads and trails in Eskorn faded away in the forest.\nThe forest was good for hunting, either for sport or for food, and hunters from nearby Mistshaws usually hired adventurers to deal with monsters or bandits hiding in the forest."
