        "mainbody": "he City of Caverns was a sahuagin city in the Sea of Swords by the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe city was essentially a giant air-filled cavern, far beneath the surface of the sea. The City of Caverns led down into the Underdark.\nThe sahuagin of the City of Caverns had built ornate structures within it. Excellently crafted golden statues of marine life and shells were shown around many parts of the city, surrounded by the rushing waters of waterfalls. An arena, which held an ettin, was used as a fighting ground. The citys floors were beautifully tiled, and large structures such as a giant sharks maw and ornate dome-shaped objects were scattered around the underwater city.\nThe royal throne room was located to the west of the city, where the leading monarch resided.\nThe sahuagin inhabitants of the city often warred with drow and illithids.\nThe sahuagin had ruled the city for countless generations. Aeons ago, Sekolah visited the city to the rejoicing of all, and his great song filled their hearts. However, Sekolah told the high priestess, Senityili, that the city would, in the future, be no more. He told of signs that surface dwellers would arrive, and only they would stand between their city and destruction. Thus, the sahuagin waited for their surface saviors-to-be.\nA southern part of the city, however, was closed off by a mad drow mage. When he passed, he forced a spectator beholder, and his imp companions, to guard a chest containing a relic of Sekolah.\nAround 1358 DR, a civil war broke out in the city. The two sides were the loyalists who supported King Ixilthetocal, and the rebels who supported Prince Villynaty."
