The '''Ashenwood''' was a wild evergreen forest in [[Rashemen]] known for its large number of [[fey]] inhabitants. The [[Rashemaar]] people considered the Ashenwood a sacred site that filled with ancient [[magic]], and refused to settle within its borders.

==Geography==
The Ashenwood was located between [[Lake Ashane]] to the west and hills and the [[Sunrise Mountains]] to the east. A river marked its southern boundary.

It was located a day's walk south of [[Immilmar]].

===Flora & Fauna===
[[File:Ashenwood.png|thumb|''Ashenwood's flora and fauna.''|520x520px]]
The forest comprised a number of different varieties of trees, including [[pine]]s and [[fir]]s, along with [[ash]] and [[aspen trees]].

It was alive with all manner of forest critters, such as [[badger]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[deer]], [[squirrel]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[fox]]es.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, agents of [[Thay]] set fire to a large swathe of the Ashenwood, driving out the forest's bestial creatures towards the villages and towns found east of the trees.

==Rumors & Legends==
Mothers in Rashemaar families told their children of the "[[Wood Man]]" a terrifying specter that haunted the Ashenwood forest. The being was in fact quite real and no mere legend at all.

==Notable Locations==
The [[River Rasha]] and [[River Ashan]] both originated as underground waterways deep beneath the Ashenwood forest.

==Inhabitants==
They very stones and trees of the Ashenwood inhabited by powerful spirits known as [[telthor]]s. 

While there were no [[human]]s that dwelled within the Ashenwood, hunters made regular forays into the woods to go hunting. There were certainly plenty of dangerous beasts within, such as [[owlbear]]s, [[troll]]s, [[ettercap]]s, [[stirge]]s, and even some covens of [[annis]] and [[green hag]]s. Many of these creatures made regular raids against the nearby Rashemaar settlements.

===Notable Inhabitants===
*[[Bristlebeard]], an ''[[awaken]]ed'' [[dire boar]] with a benevolent streak.
*[[Dar-Guran]], the vicious [[dire troll]] that was over a century old.
*[[Gnarlthorn]], a [[treant]] that sought to combat a blight in the forest.
*[[Hornclaw|Hornclaw the Gray]], a particularly massive owlbear.
*[[Stormwind]], a wise treant that allied itself with the local [[Wychlaran]].
