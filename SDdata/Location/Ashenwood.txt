The Ashenwood was a wild evergreen forest in Rashemen known for its large number of fey inhabitants. The Rashemaar people considered the Ashenwood a sacred site that filled with ancient magic, and refused to settle within its borders.
The Ashenwood was located between Lake Ashane to the west and hills and the Sunrise Mountains to the east. A river marked its southern boundary.
It was located a days walk south of Immilmar.
