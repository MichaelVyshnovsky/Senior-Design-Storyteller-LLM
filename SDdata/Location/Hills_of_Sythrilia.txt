The '''Hills of Sythrilia''' were a range of hills in [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. They were named for [[Sythrilia]], a famous heroine of ancient Thindol.

Through these hills ran a network of narrow caves. Around [[1374 DR]], these were home to the [[Sythrilian Sybil]], a noted psychic seer.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}
