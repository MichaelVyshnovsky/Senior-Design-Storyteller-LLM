        "mainbody": "Masoners Bridge was the name of the crossing over the Immerflow on the East Way in Cormyr, just before the road entered Hullack Forest.\nClose to Masoners Bridge, on a wooded hillside, was a small mausoleum built of stone that housed the bones of one Chancsozbur, a man whod once foolishly tried to swindle Manshoon of the Zhentarim some time in the 14 century DR. The tomb was built by Lord Chess of Zhentil Keep, who, on Manshoons orders, seized Chancsozburs holdings and sold them off to fund the construction, then had his men slay Chancsozburs kin when they came. Thereafter, the Zhentarim controlled the tomb and used the upper level as a smuggling waystation, whilst Manshoon stored some of his clones in the lower level. Chancsozburs stone coffin could be rotated to give access to the lower level."
