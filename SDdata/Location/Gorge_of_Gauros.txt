The '''Gorge of Gauros''' was a rocky canyon in northern [[Thay]], located within the [[Gauros|eponymous tharch]].

==Description==
The southern face of the gorge encompassed a stretch of the [[First Escarpment]], a steep precipice that served as the natural border of the [[Thayan Plateau]]. The northern face was a small plateau that extended from the southern-facing peaks of the [[Sunrise Mountains]]. The [[River Mulsantir]] flowed along the floor of the gorge, connecting with the [[River Gauros]] along its path.

Like the overshadowing Sunrise Mountains, the canyon was rich with valuable minerals, highly sought after by both the Thayan and [[Rashemi]] people.

==History==
Among their other conflicts, the countries of Thay and Rashemen often battled one another for control of the gorge and its natural resources. Another battle occurred on [[Mirtul 5]], [[1375 DR]], where the River Gauros crossed the gorge, as the legions of [[Tharchion]]s [[Azhir Kren]] and [[Homen Odesseiron]] fought the [[Hathran]]s and barbarous warriors of Rashemen.
