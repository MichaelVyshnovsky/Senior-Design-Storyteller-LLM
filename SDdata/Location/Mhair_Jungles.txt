The Mhair Jungles were a prominent jungle forest found in southern Tashalar on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
The Mhair Jungles were an important geographical feature in that they helped separate the Chultan Peninsula from Halruaa and Lapaliiya in the east. They blended with the Black Jungles located on the western side of the Lapal Sea, with several rivers, including the River Amarast and River Lapar, helping to designated a border between the two large jungles.
