The '''Mhair Jungles''' were a prominent jungle forest found in southern [[Tashalar]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The Mhair Jungles were an important geographical feature in that they helped separate the Chultan Peninsula from [[Halruaa]] and [[Lapaliiya]] in the east. They blended with the [[Black Jungles]] located on the western side of the [[Lapal Sea]], with several rivers, including the [[River Amarast]] and [[River Lapar]], helping to designated a border between the two large jungles.
