            "Functionality": "Like many sewer systems in the Realms,{{Cite web/theedverse/2017-07-31 - Sewer Technology}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-04-12 - Sanitation in the Realms}} this one operated on a tidal flushing system. Throughout its history, the sewers often suffered from flooding due to the [[Dragon Reach]]'s tides washing the sewage back into the system whenever the wind blew eastward, though the gratings on its outlets prevented the tides from washing in large objects.\n\nOver time, efforts were made to lessen the severity of this backwash, but they could not fully solve the issue. These included enlarging the size of pipes and hollowing out increasingly large water-chambers along the network of pipes. Attempts at establishing a huge, dungeon-like network across all of Tantras, similar to the [[sewers of Waterdeep]], were always thwarted by flooding.\n\nIn the eastern reaches of subterranean Tantras, some of the larger chambers were outfitted with a form of primitive water-wheel—a string of [[bucket]]s on [[chain]]s powered by [[mule]] locomotion—which raised up to empty into silo-like water-towers. Occasionally these silos were drained in a gravity-powered flood through the easternmost sewers, carrying the dung out into the marshy fields immediately east of Tantras.\n\nDuring the winter season, cold weather would cause the sewers to freeze and, even with the heat that [[dung]] generated, the system would become inefficient. On the other hand, the cold air also cut down on the smell and caused [[disease]]-carrying insects to be largely or wholly absent. Around this time of year, Tantras would resort to [[nightsoil cart]]s (sometimes mounted on [[sledge]]s) to carry their waste away to be spread over the farm fields surrounding the city.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Sewers & Catacombs of Tantras}}"
