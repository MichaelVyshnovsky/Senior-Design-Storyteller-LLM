'''Seaserpent Tamed by Umberlee''' was a statue in the [[Gray Harbor]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
The statue was located in the [[Lower City]], very close to the [[Water Queen's House]].

==History==
In [[1482 DR]], the hand of this statue, as well as others, was stolen by agents of [[the Guild]]. All but those of the [[Outer City]] were enraged, and the [[Flaming Fist]] conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up, even when searching the [[Calim Jewel Emporium]]. Later, the [[Beloved Ranger]] was vandalised by bored noble youths. [[Horgold Hadru]] took in the young nobles, as he owed the youth's family a favor.
