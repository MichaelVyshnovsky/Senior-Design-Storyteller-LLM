This fiery vein of ore connected the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] to the lava tube located beneath the [[City of Brass]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].\n\nTravelers using the Iron Crucible were met by [[efreet]] ships floating on the lava that carried them to the City of Brass.\n\nThis elemental vortex allowed travel both ways, but efreet travelling to the Elemental Plane of Fire often ran into [[yakmen]] who attempted to collect ridiculous tolls before allowing their passage."
