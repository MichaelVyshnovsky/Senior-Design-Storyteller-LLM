        "mainbody": "'''Fang Island''' was a small island that sat in the mouth of the [[River Mirar]] in the city of [[Luskan]].",
        "Description": "The island was uninhabited and craggy, and earned its name because its sharp rocks were known to tear apart any [[boat]] or [[barge]] that was swept downriver. It hosted a self-sustaining area of ''[[wild magic]]'' that would randomly discharge dangerous [[spell]]s. Although rare, these [[magic]]al bursts could illuminate a dark night in the city.",
        "Geography": "The island lay between [[Harbor Arm Island]] and the inhabited islands in the River Mirar's mouth ([[Blood Island]], [[Closeguard Island]], and [[Cutlass Island]]).",
        "History": "The [[Arcane Brotherhood]] had plans to build on the barren Fang Island as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and its ''wild magic'' zone was the result of a failed effort by them to create an extremely powerful [[ward]] there. They subsequently were unable to remove this phenomenon.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, the island was seized by [[Deudermont]] and [[Ship Kurth]], and was used as part of a blockade of the river in their battle to drive [[Arklem Greeth]] and the Arcane Brotherhood out of the city.\n\nDuring the traumatic events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the island was suffused with fire and light as it lifted into the air as an [[earthmote]]. It remained above the city for a century, occasionally spawning terrifying monsters or spilling [[acid]] rain.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]], it had returned to the river and was once again noted for its tendency to tear ships apart. It remained uninhabited."
