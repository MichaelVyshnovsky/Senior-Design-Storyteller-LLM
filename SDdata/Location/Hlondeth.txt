Hlondethar warriors prided themselves in their immaculate appearance. They kept their gear repaired and polished, their blades were always freshly-sharpened, and their clothes were clean and pristine. Hlondethar warriors often wore green cloaks, tunics, and tabards - the main color of their city. Their armor, shields, and helmets were inlaid with small pieces of green marble (or emeralds among the rich). Shields were often decorated with various snake motifs, with the image of two coiled snakes being the most prevalent one. The warriors green cloaks were pinned with golden brooches of the same intertwined circular snake shape. Another common decoration was a single golden and aquamarine snake-shaped earing in the left ear.

Later in 145 DR, the city came into open conflict with the mercenary armies of Dempster Turmish, who besieged Hlondeth. At the time, Hlondeth was ruled by a human warlord named Gestin who was a capable military leader. Gestins knowledge of the territory and strategy made him confident in the invaders failure unless they gained control of the Churning Bay in the waters of the Vilhon Reach. Gestin committed to not losing a single life to the useless conflict. Under the warlords command, the city was able to outlast this siege with the help of the pirates of the Vilhon Reach. Gestin offered the pirate captains a safe harbor within the city in exchange for aid against the Turmite army and supply runs for Hlondeth. The promise of safe harbor brought 60 vessels to the city-states aid.
After the war, Gestins political power grew along with Hlondeths legal and pirate smuggling trade. During that period of growth,  House Extaminos made a fortune by quarrying unique emerald-hued marble from the Orsraun Mountains.

In the , Lord Dempster helmed another attack on Hlondeth but was beaten by the citys mighty walls and the spells of Riliton Mandleweave.

The eruption of Mount Urguth near Hlondeth brought an end to this period in the . According to historians, the eruption blackened the skies above Hlondeth for several months, entwining days and nights. This event also ended the more than century-long rule of Gestins family. Several powerful churches that supported the warlords rule became displeased and sought a new ruler. House Extaminos saw the opportunity. Meanwhile, Illistine of Chondath used the cover of volcanic darkness to secretly move its mercenary troops and navy into Hlondeth seizing power within the city.
In the , Laviar Illistine of Chondath used Hlondeth to assemble an army to lead it against the Kingdom of Turmish. This was the worst kept secret, and Alaghôn amassed their own troops. After the clash, both nations entered the Stalemate and armies retreated unable to win nor lose.
To everyones surprise, in the spring of the , an army of kobolds under the banner of the Tattered Cloth Legion, commanded by the drow queen Nathglaryst of Undraeth, attacked the city. The kobold legion invaded the citys sewer system at dusk, murdering over 1,000 unsuspecting inhabitants of Hlondeth. The attackers torched the governors palace and the entirety of the city quarter that housed Hlondeths rich and powerful. Many of the citys residents took refuge in the family compound of green-marble-built House Extaminos, the only stronghold within the city that withstood the fires. Lord Shevron Extaminos had a strange affinity with snakes since his childhood and the family palace housed over a thousand serpents - Lord Extaminoss pets. At the end of the first week of the kobold siege, Shevron Extaminos spent hours praying to Ilmater, asking for aid and divine guidance. When he opened his eyes, he realized that his entire collection of serpents gathered around, ready for Lord Shevron to command. Inspired by his pets, Shevron Extaminos charged into battle, leading a slithering army of snakes against kobolds, with the mercenaries of House Extaminos following suit. That night the governing quarter of Hlondeth was taken from the invaders, with Lord Shevron Extaminos perishing in battle. Several days later, Hlondeth was free once again. After the siege was over, it was revealed that the drow queen Nathglaryst claimed the Hlondeths treasury during the war and disappeared with it never to be seen again.
The kobold siege embittered Hlondeth against their Hondathan masters due to lack of help in the time of need. This led to several attempts for Hlondeth to gain independence that eventually was claimed in the , when members of House Extaminos orchestrated a rebellion against Chondath. It was at this time that the House re-consecrated in the name of Sseth in his guise as Varae, a change which was met with middling acceptance from the populace. The  brought new secured trade routes between the Shining Plains and Hlondeth.
