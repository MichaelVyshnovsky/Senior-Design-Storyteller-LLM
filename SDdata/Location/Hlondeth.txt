Hlondeth was a well-run, organized, and efficient walled city-state. and natural sources. After dark, the view of the city was reflected off the waters of the Vilhon Reach. The city also eschewed stairs in favor of ramps and poles to be better used by the yuan-ti. The city had a functioning sewer system and numerous omnipresent fountains.
The ruling power sat in the governing quarter of Hlondeth, where the governors palace was located before it was burned down in 527 DR. The same quarter housed villas, palaces, and homes of the citys nobility, including the green-marble stronghold of House Extaminos.

Hlondeth was built in the Churning Bay of the Vilhon Reach,  its northern shore, opposite of Sespech. The bottom of the bay held many sunken ships and many undiscovered treasures. Mount Ugruth was located in close proximity to the city and often threatened it with volcanic rumblings. The city-states territory included  radius around Hlondeth. The territory included about a dozen small villages and numerous vineyards.
Ssvaklors were rare draconic creatures that could be found in the atreas teeming with yuan-ti. Hlondeth was not an exception. Dmetrio Extaminos was attempting to create ssvaklors using a set of black dragon eggs in the In the late 14 century DR, to great disdain of the Cult of Tiamat. Under the rule of House Extaminos various serpentine creatures served the yuan-ti masters and guarded the citys catacombs. These creatures included histachii servitors and ophidians. As of late-14 century DR, flying snakes imported from the Mhair Jungles became quite popoular and wide-spread pets among the locals.
In 1373 DR the matriarch of the Extaminos family was Dediana Extaminos who had a snakes tail instead of legs. She ruled over the city with a light hand. Her mate was First Consort Ssibalentanamas, a spirit naga cleric of Sseth, who was also known as First Keeper of the Sacred Eggs, his main task was guarding the yuan-ti brood chambers.
Hlondeth was a very prosperous city and active in trade and commerce with its neighbors, being one of the busiest ports in the Vilhon Reach. It transported goods into the lower half of nearby Turmish. It traded actively with the tribes and city-states of the Shining Plains to the west. Hlondeth was always eager to recruit adventurers to serve as caravan guards and was known for its extensive patrols.
Hlondeths relationship with Sespech was very tense for quite a while, for Dmetrio Extaminos, son of Dediana Extaminos, was in love with the barons eldest daughter however, his courting attempts remained unsuccessful. Hlondeth was known to rarely participate in the Southsands Games, training maneuvers between Turmish and Chondath. But the city profited from hosting the competitions via tourism that attracted tens of thousands of visitors from across the Realms.
Under the control of the yuan-ti, Hlondeth established a hidden portal that connected the City of Serpents with a temple to a yuan-ti snake god in the Black Jungles of Tashalar.
Hlondeth also engaged in heavy trade with nagas and other yuan-ti of Sespech region. Hlondeth imported Sespechian wine, perfumes, herbs, spices, and poisons, while exporting tough textiles to be used in cloth awnings, artful mosaic tiles, and various aloe-based medicinal liniments.
The people of Hlondeth valued trade, ritualized combat, and nature. Magic-users were treated with suspicion in Hlondeth, and the citys kobold population was kept in an enslaved state. Hlondeth welcomed visitors of most races with open arms, and the city itself was considered a pleasant place. Its yuan-ti inhabitants did not discriminate or mistreat humans.
Hlondethar were well-versed in languages such as Common, bullywug, firenewt, lizardfolk, troglodyte, or yuan-ti. Possibly due to unnatural influence of serpentine magics over the city of Hlondeth, its inhabitants felt irrational fear of birds of prey and giant birds, and felt strange uneasiness around harmless avian creatures such as crows, sparrows, pigeons, doves, and seagulls.
Following the strengthened presence of the yuan-ti in Hlondeth, serpent folk learned to sway the citys human inhabitants. Over time they used psionics to make humans pliable and receptive of yuan-ti control.
Wizards of Hlondeth imitated the architecture of their city in the colors of the garments they preferred. Silk robes of bright reds, deep greens, and azure were the dominant colors. Popular jewelry among spellcasters and regular folk was made of gold and included necklaces, torcs, snake-like chain links, and bracelets. Magical and enchanted jewelry was greatly valued above all else.
Many Hlondethar taverns catered to the tastes of its yuan-ti population. Ale was served with a small raw speckled egg floating in the drink, a treat for serpentine creatures. Somewhat gruesomely, a Hlondethar dish popular among visitors was black adder stew.

Hlondethar warriors prided themselves in their immaculate appearance. They kept their gear repaired and polished, their blades were always freshly-sharpened, and their clothes were clean and pristine. Hlondethar warriors often wore green cloaks, tunics, and tabards - the main color of their city. Their armor, shields, and helmets were inlaid with small pieces of green marble (or emeralds among the rich). Shields were often decorated with various snake motifs, with the image of two coiled snakes being the most prevalent one. The warriors green cloaks were pinned with golden brooches of the same intertwined circular snake shape. Another common decoration was a single golden and aquamarine snake-shaped earing in the left ear.
Arcane Hlondethar spellcasters were often described as cold and calculating. Extended contact with yuan-ti magics affected wizards who hailed from the city-state. They were blessed with the affinity for psionics and most learned cause fear, darkness, polymorph other, suggestion, and charm person spells at an early stage of their studies.
Founded in the , Hlondeth was established as an important port at the end of the Turmway, a long road that ran through Turmish, connecting Hlondeth with Alaghôn.
The  saw the construction of the trade route known as the Pikemens Folly that connected the newly-built city of Ormath with Hlondeth. This led to a population surge in Hlondeth, eclipsing Alaghôn. In the  Alaghôn gained a new mayor in Dempster Turmish, following a short but bloody civil war and by , Alaghôn claimed all the lowlands that bordered Hlondeth.
Later in 145 DR, the city came into open conflict with the mercenary armies of Dempster Turmish, who besieged Hlondeth. At the time, Hlondeth was ruled by a human warlord named Gestin who was a capable military leader. Gestins knowledge of the territory and strategy made him confident in the invaders failure unless they gained control of the Churning Bay in the waters of the Vilhon Reach. Gestin committed to not losing a single life to the useless conflict. Under the warlords command, the city was able to outlast this siege with the help of the pirates of the Vilhon Reach. Gestin offered the pirate captains a safe harbor within the city in exchange for aid against the Turmite army and supply runs for Hlondeth. The promise of safe harbor brought 60 vessels to the city-states aid.
After the war, Gestins political power grew along with Hlondeths legal and pirate smuggling trade. During that period of growth,  House Extaminos made a fortune by quarrying unique emerald-hued marble from the Orsraun Mountains. The nobility of House Extaminos started positioning themselves to gain political power for themselves, but Gestins popularity and success stifled it. In the , Lord Dempster helmed another attack on Hlondeth but was beaten by the citys mighty walls and the spells of Riliton Mandleweave. Additional aid came from an adventuring company known as the Company of the Howling Harpoon who flanked Alaghôns army, destroying its supplies and siege machinery. By the , Alaghôn amassed fleet big enough to attack Hlondeth yet again however, the peace was achieved with Dempsters death in his sleep. Florentine Dempster, the new leader of Alaghôn, immediately eased hostilities and called a new attack off.thumb|The city of Hlondeth.|352x352px
The hundred-year period following the conflict was known as Calmwaters, a period in which trade and civilization flourished in the Vilhon Reach. The eruption of Mount Urguth near Hlondeth brought an end to this period in the . According to historians, the eruption blackened the skies above Hlondeth for several months, entwining days and nights. This event also ended the more than century-long rule of Gestins family. Several powerful churches that supported the warlords rule became displeased and sought a new ruler. House Extaminos saw the opportunity. Meanwhile, Illistine of Chondath used the cover of volcanic darkness to secretly move its mercenary troops and navy into Hlondeth seizing power within the city.
In the , Laviar Illistine of Chondath used Hlondeth to assemble an army to lead it against the Kingdom of Turmish. This was the worst kept secret, and Alaghôn amassed their own troops. After the clash, both nations entered the Stalemate and armies retreated unable to win nor lose.
To everyones surprise, in the spring of the , an army of kobolds under the banner of the Tattered Cloth Legion, commanded by the drow queen Nathglaryst of Undraeth, attacked the city. The kobold legion invaded the citys sewer system at dusk, murdering over 1,000 unsuspecting inhabitants of Hlondeth. The attackers torched the governors palace and the entirety of the city quarter that housed Hlondeths rich and powerful. Many of the citys residents took refuge in the family compound of green-marble-built House Extaminos, the only stronghold within the city that withstood the fires. Lord Shevron Extaminos had a strange affinity with snakes since his childhood and the family palace housed over a thousand serpents - Lord Extaminoss pets. At the end of the first week of the kobold siege, Shevron Extaminos spent hours praying to Ilmater, asking for aid and divine guidance. When he opened his eyes, he realized that his entire collection of serpents gathered around, ready for Lord Shevron to command. Inspired by his pets, Shevron Extaminos charged into battle, leading a slithering army of snakes against kobolds, with the mercenaries of House Extaminos following suit. That night the governing quarter of Hlondeth was taken from the invaders, with Lord Shevron Extaminos perishing in battle. Several days later, Hlondeth was free once again. After the siege was over, it was revealed that the drow queen Nathglaryst claimed the Hlondeths treasury during the war and disappeared with it never to be seen again.
The kobold siege embittered Hlondeth against their Hondathan masters due to lack of help in the time of need. This led to several attempts for Hlondeth to gain independence that eventually was claimed in the , when members of House Extaminos orchestrated a rebellion against Chondath. It was at this time that the House re-consecrated in the name of Sseth in his guise as Varae, a change which was met with middling acceptance from the populace. The  brought new secured trade routes between the Shining Plains and Hlondeth.
The Chondathan civil war, later named the Rotting War, lasted from 900 to 902 DR. During that time, Hlondeth withstood several attacks by Chondathan forces, but eventually, the war led to splintering of Chondat into independent city-states. attracted by crime, smuggling, and black markets. In the , Lord Saros took leadership of Turmish and established solid trade relations with its old enemies in Hlondeth.
By the , House Extaminos at last siezed control of the city after defeating a competitor noble family and the death of its heirless, Wariton Minlow. House Extaminos led Hlondeth and its scions slowly started mixing their blood with yuan-ti.

The last day of the  was celebrated by another eruption of Mount Ugruth. Hlondeth felt the tremors of the explosion however, the damage was minimal, with the ashes covering city streets and darkening its skies. Hlondeth remembered its history well and was ready for attempts of stealth to take over. However, Chondath was too busy dealing with its own problems and weakened by the Rotting War to attempt another takeover.
An Ilmatari holy item, The Tome of Torment surfaced in Hlondeth in the  after Kortolt Rushtyn of the Tanarspear Hill was murdered by brigands. The bandits attempted to sell the holy book in Hlondeth but were slain by enraged citizens. The book was given to the Graycloaks Wolves, a local adventuring company to be transported to the House of the Harmed in Aralent.
In the , Mount Ugruth came to life once again. A series of earthquakes rumbled for several months before dying down. These earthquakes opened up a naturally-formed tunnel that descended deep into the earth. House Extaminos thought the cavern to be the pathway into the Underdark used by the drow invaders of 527 DR. The ruling family-sponsored five adventuring companies, an army of ophidians, and a party of yuan-ti to enter Underdark through the new tunnel, but none returned. Dediana Extaminos sought more brave adventurers willing to scout the tunnel in search of drow or kobold activity.
By the , the Cult of the Dragon usurped the majority of Hlondeths black market and slavery operations. During that time, Dmetrios cultists used a copy of the Tome of the Dragon to create ur-histachii in the catacombs under the city. In response, Mavanna Blackspine of the Sisterhood of the Silver Fire sought adventurers of Chondath and Sespech to recover a copy of Sammasters grimoire. The information about the ur-histachii was leaked by Medusanna Mhairdaul, a High Priestess of the Cathedral of Emerald Scales who was attempting to weaken the Extaminos rule in her favor.
By the late-14 century DR, House Extaminos was successful in creating a breeding program that eventually birthed extaminaars, snake-blooded humanoids that were used across Faerûn as agents of Extamins and the yuan-ti. They operated in secrecy and often created lairs in cities sewers, plotting to increase the influence of House Extaminos, finding targets of breeding experiments and objects for grafting.
In the , the Serpent Sibyl, an avatar of Sseth during the Time of Troubles, appeared in the Scaled Halls of Varae, deep in the catacombs underneath Hlondeth. The avatar took over the ancient temple and gathered a cult that quickly amassed numbers that were sure to threaten the power of House Extaminos. Sibyls cult found allies in the Plague-Mothers Children, human Talonite worshipers, and the Serpents Secession, a human anti-yuan-ti resistance band led by Gonthril Astinar.
On Kythorn 23, the , a plague known as the Pox burned through the human inhabitants of Hlondeth.
