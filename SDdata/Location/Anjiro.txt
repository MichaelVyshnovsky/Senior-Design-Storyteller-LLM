'''Anjiro''' was a village in [[Aru Province]] on the island of [[Tsukishima]] in [[Wa]], lying near the capital town of [[Aru]].

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, the [[shoya|headman]] of Anjiro grew suspicious of events in the village and wrote a report to the [[daimyo]] of the province, [[Benju Matsutomo]]. Although Benju asked for more details, the headman fell out of contact. Then, in the summer of that year, his body was discovered dead in the [[House of Heavenly Sand]] in [[Aru]], having been poisoned and dumped there by [[ninja]], likely the [[Yamaguchi]] clan that served Eichiro Tanaka of Anjiro.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Eichiro Tanaka]].
