        "mainbody": "'''Rabruin's Tor''' was a small settlement in the [[Hullack Forest]] in the [[Cormyr/East Reaches|East Reaches]] of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "The community lay atop a prominent crag (the eponymous Tor), and consisted of the families of [[Estann Rabruin]] and his five sons. They cut wood and ranched from the Tor throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "The Tor was just outside of the eastern edge of the Hullack Forest along the [[East Way]], on the southern side of the highway.",
        "History": "In the early 1330s DR, the woodcutter and wainwright Estann Rabruin bought and settled the Tor, building his family's home there. As part of his ambitions, he also backed a project to cut a road through the Hullack Forest called the [[Hullackheart Trail]] that would run from [[Thunderstone]] to meet the East Way below the Tor. This project was quickly noticed by the Crown of Cormyr, who realized it would disturb the monsters and ruins in the depths of the forest, and create a new, remote settlement that would easily foment problems for the realm while demanding an official [[Purple Dragons]] garrison, a King's lord, and other administrative necessities. Unwilling to pay the price so that some merchants could profit off of it, King [[Rhigaerd Obarskyr II]] decreed a ban on all woodcutting within a half-day's travel of the north end of [[Stag's Skull Bridge]], effectively ending the effort.\n\nAlthough the roadbuilding project ended, Estann Rabuin stubbornly remained on the Tor with his family, who continued to woodcut and ranch from their elevated homestead."
