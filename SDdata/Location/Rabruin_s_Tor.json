        "mainbody": "Rabruins Tor was a small settlement in the Hullack Forest in the East Reaches of Cormyr.\nThe community lay atop a prominent crag (the eponymous Tor), and consisted of the families of Estann Rabruin and his five sons. They cut wood and ranched from the Tor throughout the 15 century DR.\nThe Tor was just outside of the eastern edge of the Hullack Forest along the East Way, on the southern side of the highway.\nIn the early 1330s DR, the woodcutter and wainwright Estann Rabruin bought and settled the Tor, building his familys home there. As part of his ambitions, he also backed a project to cut a road through the Hullack Forest called the Hullackheart Trail that would run from Thunderstone to meet the East Way below the Tor. This project was quickly noticed by the Crown of Cormyr, who realized it would disturb the monsters and ruins in the depths of the forest, and create a new, remote settlement that would easily foment problems for the realm while demanding an official Purple Dragons garrison, a Kings lord, and other administrative necessities. Unwilling to pay the price so that some merchants could profit off of it, King Rhigaerd Obarskyr II decreed a ban on all woodcutting within a half-days travel of the north end of Stags Skull Bridge, effectively ending the effort.\nAlthough the roadbuilding project ended, Estann Rabuin stubbornly remained on the Tor with his family, who continued to woodcut and ranch from their elevated homestead."
