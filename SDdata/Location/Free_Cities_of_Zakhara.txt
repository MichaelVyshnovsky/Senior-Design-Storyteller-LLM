The '''Free Cities of Zakhara''' were a group of city-states along the north coast of [[Zakhara|that continent]].

==Geography==
Each of these city-states was located at the mouth of a river. The cities were [[Hafayah]], [[Liham]], [[Muluk]], [[Qadib]], [[Umara]], and [[Utaqa]]. They swore fealty to the [[Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]], but maintained a larger degree of independence than other parts of Zakhara.

==Government==
The Free Cities' independence was limited mainly by the nearby city of staunch [[Qudra]] and its mamluks.

==Trade==
Main products of the Free Cities included clothing, rice, [[agate]]s, [[semi-precious stones]],<ref> pottery, coffee, indigo dye, purple cloth and clothing, and trade in northern goods<ref><ref>.
