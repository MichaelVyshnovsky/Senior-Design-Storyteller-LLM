'''Waturi Forest''' was a forest located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Waturi Forest was a forest of large [[mahogany]] and [[teak]] trees that spanned several provinces on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. It was located to the west of the town of [[Renkyu]].

==Inhabitants==
Waturi Forest was home to the largest population of [[bamboo spirit folk]] in Kozakura.

Due to the forest's proximity to Renkyu, the bamboo spirit folk were forced to defend their bamboo groves from [[human]] lumberjacks. As a result, the shugo-daimyo [[Katsuhara Omitsu]] had designated certain areas of the forest where exploitation of bamboo and lumber were authorized.
