Waturi Forest was a forest located in Kozakura.
Waturi Forest was a forest of large mahogany and teak trees that spanned several provinces on the island of Shinkoku. It was located to the west of the town of Renkyu.
Waturi Forest was home to the largest population of bamboo spirit folk in Kozakura.
Due to the forests proximity to Renkyu, the bamboo spirit folk were forced to defend their bamboo groves from human lumberjacks. As a result, the shugo-daimyo Katsuhara Omitsu had designated certain areas of the forest where exploitation of bamboo and lumber were authorized.
