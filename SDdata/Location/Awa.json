        "Description": "Awa was a flourishing community, with 127 buildings, including several warehouses owned by the [[Niwa clan]]. The village's strategic location at the confluence of the [[Tara-gawa]] and [[Furo-gawa]] rivers played a pivotal role in its prosperity.",
        "Trade": "The shipping business in Awa was a lucrative venture and was exclusively controlled by the Niwa clan. This monopoly not only enhanced the economic significance of the village but also underscored the strategic importance of its location for trade and transportation.\n\nA significant portion of the produce from the upland [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']], either intended for market or collected as rent and taxes, was transported to Awa to be shipped downstream.",
        "Government": "As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the village's [[jito]] was [[Kuroda Saga]]. Although the management of the shoen of Awa was primarily handled from [[Tamanokuni]], the Niwa clan recognized the village's importance and maintained a considerable presence there.",
        "Defenses": "A contingent of ten [[samurai]] and thirty [[bushi]] was stationed in Awa."
