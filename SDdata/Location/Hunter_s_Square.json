        "mainbody": "unters Square was a courtyard in Port Nyanzaru, Chult where adventurers and members of the Hunters Guild of Chult congregated to plan their hunts and trade for lures and equipment.\nThe square was located south of the Bazaar and just inside Port Nyanzarus main gate.The Neverwinter video game does not specify which of Port Nyanzarus three gates is this \"main gate\". Elsewhere, the game also refers to this gate as the \"south gate\", and given that Hunters Square is located south of Wakanga Otamus villa, of the docks, and of the Bazaar, it is most reasonable to assume that it lies just inside either Ubtaos Jaws or the Tiryki Gate. However, the in-game map of the city does not correspond closely to the map provided in Tomb of Annihilation, and thus it is not possible to identify a definitive canon location for Hunters Square. \nDuring the events of the death curse in the late 15 century DR, the famed writer and traveler Volo visited Hunters Square and became enamored with the hunters tales of dangerous Chultan beasts, particularly the King of Spines."
