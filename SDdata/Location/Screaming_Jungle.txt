The Screaming Jungle was a wooded area in the Gaping Maw, the 88 level of the Abyss.
The Screaming Jungle was a lush, deeply shadowed jungle named for the noises of the many fiendish primates, including monkeys, lemurs, and apes, that dwelt under the vast canopies of the area. The ground gave way to an immense bog around the city of Lemoriax.
The city of Lemoriax stood on the edge of the Screaming Jungle.
It was rumored that a plateau lost deep within the jungle housed a two-way portal to the 90 layer of the Abyss, the Guttering Grove, presided over by Ilsidahur.
The Screaming Jungle was inhabited by a wide variety of creatures. Tribes of troglodytes and lizardfolk called the boggy area their home, as did hezrou demons and some yuan-ti cultists who managed to survive the perils of living within the Abyss. Within the thick, lush inland, dire apes and barlgura often fought over territory with the dinosaurs who also inhabited the region.
