The '''Screaming Jungle''' was a wooded area in the [[Gaping Maw]], the 88{{th}} level of the [[Abyss]].

==Description==
The Screaming Jungle was a lush, deeply shadowed jungle named for the noises of the many [[fiendish]] primates, including [[monkey]]s, lemurs, and [[ape]]s, that dwelt under the vast canopies of the area. The ground gave way to an immense bog around the city of Lemoriax.

==Notable Locations==
The city of [[Lemoriax]] stood on the edge of the Screaming Jungle.

It was rumored that a plateau lost deep within the jungle housed a two-way portal to the 90{{th}} layer of the Abyss, [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 90: The Guttering Grove|the Guttering Grove]], presided over by [[Ilsidahur]].

==Inhabitants==
The Screaming Jungle was inhabited by a wide variety of creatures. Tribes of [[troglodytes]] and [[lizardfolk]] called the boggy area their home, as did [[hezrou]] demons and some [[yuan-ti]] cultists who managed to survive the perils of living within the Abyss. Within the thick, lush inland, [[dire ape]]s and [[barlgura]] often fought over territory with the [[dinosaur]]s who also inhabited the region.
