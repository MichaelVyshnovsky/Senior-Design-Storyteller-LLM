Awana was an island in the Celestial Sea, part of the island chain known as the Three Sisters.
Awana was located north of the Joi Chang Peninsula and the Ausa province of Tu Lung.
Awana was the only place where the spice of the same name, awana, was known to grow.
Around the midâ€“13 century DR, Awana and the other islands that made up the Three Sisters were disputed territory between the nations of Shou Lung and Tu Lung.
In 1357 DR, Tan Wui Locca, member of the royal Tan family of Tu Lung whose jurisdiction included the Three Sisters, had a fleet of war ships anchor off the coast of Awana after being told by an apparition that the Shou were going to attempt to take the island chain.
The island was said to be inhabited by dangerous monsters and cannibal humans.
