        "mainbody": "The Tying Place was the name of a courtyard in Manass primarily used to stable horses and other pack animals.\nThis courtyard was surrounded by stables and corrals. Many visitors to Manass commonly left their animals in this location while they explored the city. The Tying Place was also used for the site of a livestock market on a monthly basis.\nAs one would expect for any area housing a large collection of animals, the stench emanating from the square was often overbearing to those not accustomed to it."
