Dunspeirrin, also known as the City of Sunken Spires and Underspires, was a duergar city below the Orsraun Mountains in the Darklands of the Middledark.
Around 1369 DR, the duergar sent the Army of Steel into the caverns of Taark Shanat to stop the Army of Gold regaining the shield dwarf kingdom of Deep Shanatar and started the War of Gold and Gloom. As of 1372 DR, the gold dwarves and duergar were still fighting.
Around 1491 DR, their king was Olorn Ridaugaur who wielded the Barakuir scepter, one of the ten Ruling Scepters of Shanatar.
