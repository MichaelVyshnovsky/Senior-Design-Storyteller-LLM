The [[Sable Wars]], which began in {{Yearlink|-11450}}, were a series of battles during the [[Second Crown War]]. Aided by a few allies from [[Keltormir]] and [[Shantel Othreier]], Eiellûr and Thearnytaar invaded Ilythiir, aiming to reform or conquer the [[dark elves]] before they destroyed any more realms. Over half their forces were wiped out by the dark elves' corrupt magic.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-11200}}, the kingdom was destroyed by the dark elf kingdom of Ilythiir during the Second Crown War.\n\nAs the ages past, the ruins of Thearnytaar were taken over by the [[Thornwood]].",
