'''Mhairhetel''', also known as the '''City of Renegades''', was a small city in [[Serpentes]] situated at the southeastern tip of the [[Mhair Jungles]]. It was considered to be one of [[Faerûn]]'s most notorious [[pirate]] ports.

==Government==
Mhairhetel was ruled by the [[Rhaunister]] family, which was made up of junior [[yuan-ti pureblood]] members of [[House Jennestas]]. By [[1373 DR]], the city's High Lord was [[Istasfis Nsaran]], who attained the position by marrying the previous High Lord's widow.

==Defenses==
Mhairhetel was defended from the Mhair Jungles' monsters and overland attacks by patrols of human-sized [[snake]]s stationed on the eastern side of the [[Guth Mountains]] and the east end of the [[Dolsel Gap]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|-125}}, Mhairhetel was founded by the [[Halruaa]]n [[archmage]] [[Hetel Hastalhorn]], who sought to take advantage of the Mhair Jungles' hidden treasures. This initial chapter of the city was short-lived, however, and by the [[-124 DR|following year]], its founder had disappeared and nearly the entire population abandoned the settlement.

Despite this initial misfortune, Mhairhetel's population quickly started growing again, supplemented by consistent waves of refugees seeking to escape their homelands, and by [[1373 DR]] it had grown into a small but viable city with a population in the thousands.

Since several centuries before the 14{{th}}, especially before the alliance between the [[Rundeen]] trade consortium and [[House Se'Sehen]] was forged after the [[Time of Troubles]], Mhairhetel was thought of as a useful asset to the [[yuan-ti]] tribes of Serpentes as a unique conduit for trade with outlanders. The port's role as a common starting point for [[human]]s from the coasts of the [[Great Sea]] who wished to explore the Mhair Jungles was also seen as a convenient factor for surveillance.

==Rumors & Legends==
Although the Rhaunister family's yuan-ti identity was kept secret, rumors about their ability to talk to snakes and the conduction of experiments to turn people into human-serpent hybrids ran rampant.
