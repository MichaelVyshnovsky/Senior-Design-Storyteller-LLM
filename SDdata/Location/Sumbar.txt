'''Sumbar''' was a small island in the [[Pirate Isles]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. 

==Geography==
Sumbar was found near the center of the Pirate Isles along the northwest edge of [[the Bowl]].

==Description==
A series of treacherous reefs surrounded the island. To make matters worse, the reefs appeared to shift on a daily basis so they were never in the same position.

==Inhabitants==
The island was inhabited by the mysterious [[Oracle of Nasmen]], which would answer a single question after an appropriate offering was made. The Oracle took the form of a well atop a ridge.
