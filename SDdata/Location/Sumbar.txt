Sumbar was a small island in the Pirate Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
Sumbar was found near the center of the Pirate Isles along the northwest edge of the Bowl.
A series of treacherous reefs surrounded the island. To make matters worse, the reefs appeared to shift on a daily basis so they were never in the same position.
The island was inhabited by the mysterious Oracle of Nasmen, which would answer a single question after an appropriate offering was made. The Oracle took the form of a well atop a ridge.
