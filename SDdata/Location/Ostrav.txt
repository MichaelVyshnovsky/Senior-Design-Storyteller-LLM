Ostrav was a small farming village found in the grasslands of the Duchy of Arcata in Damara along the Beaumaris River.
Despite their relatively small size, the politically neutral community managed to survive and thrive during desperate times such as the rise of Zhengyi.
Ostrav was known for its friendly inhabitants and fabulous inns.
