'''Rannath''' was a vale in [[Thay]].

==Geography==
Rannath was a vale that ran from the northeast to the southwest across the [[Surague Escarpment]] northwest of [[Pyarados]].

===Flora & Fauna===
Matter from other planes had entered the zone in {{yearlink|952}}, which made it a likely location for many abyssal creatures such as [[bodak]]s or [[bebilith]]s.

==History==
The [[Red Wizards]] of Thay slew [[Magister]] [[Baerzlus Anagathiir]] in that location after a long and extreme spellbattle in {{yearlink|952}}, straining the [[Weave]] to its limit and in fact fraying it somewhat. Though [[Azuth]] repaired most of the damage, visits from beings from the [[Abyss]] became a normal feature of the zone well into {{yearlink|1370}}.
