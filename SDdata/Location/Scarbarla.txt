'''Scarbarla''' was a small realm located in the northern coastal region of [[Turmish]] and known for its pirates.

==Description==
===Geography===
Scarbarla was a realm situated on the northerly coastal regions of Turmish. Originally, it was bordered on the south and west by dense forest.

==History==
The Scarbarlatine were a people largely consisting of fisherfolk and pirates. Their nation flourished for a long time, but they expanded their borders only slowly, preferring to focus on the sea and its bounties.

When they did eventually try to absorb the woods bordering them into their realm, they met stiff resistance in the form of the native [[satyr]] population, beginning with raids but resulting in all-out war that devastated both sides.

Scarbarla's misfortune continued as those that their pirates had raided decided to take their revenge against the realm while it was weakened from war, by attacking Scarbarla's coastline. Monsters from inland harried the realm as well, and even worse, the region suffered from a full decade of harsh winters.

Some time in the early-to-mid 9{{th}} century [[DR]], the last survivors of Scarbarla abandoned their homes.

About a century after this exodus, however, the first waves of Turmishan colonists ventured north, hoping to found an independent, culturally diverse realm of their own. It was not recorded whether any of these experiments in realm building had been particularly successful, only that they had been small, varied, and the source of much confusion about Turmishan cultural norms to visiting strangers from other lands.

The region continued to be known as the Scarbarlatine in Turmish, after the people who long ago lived there, though the names of the small states that claimed territory up in those lands were many.
