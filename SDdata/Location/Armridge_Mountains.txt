The '''Armridge Mountains''', also known as the '''Ushar Mountains''',<ref group="note">This alternative name seems to appear only in [[The Great Glacier (sourcebook)|''The Great Glacier'' (1992)]], so it could be reasonably inferred that this is the Armridge Mounatins' name in the [[Ulutiun language]]. were a mountain range in [[Sossal]] near the border with the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
The Armridge Mountains sat in the west of Sossal just outside the eastern edge of the Great Glacier, and lay due northeast of the Glacier's [[Novularond]] Mountains.

The [[Sossrim]] settlements of [[Uldfest]] and [[Shannath]] lay between the mountains' eastern edges and the [[Angsaas Chain]], while the settlement of [[Dharvil]] lay on the southeastern side. A road heading east from Dharvil connected these settlements to [[Sundice]] and then beyond to [[Naupau]] on the coast, while a trail known as "[[Reach (trail)|The Reach]]" heading south from Uldfast connected them to the Great Glacier and then beyond to far off [[Vaasa]].

The [[Forrok Stream]] originated in the southeastern corner of the mountains and flowed west into the Glacier.

==History==
The Armridge Mountains were settled in {{YearlinkName|-2320}} by a clan of [[Rashemi]] explorers and traders. They were led by a warrior named [[Soss]], and would come to be known as the first of the Sossrim.

The Sossrim of the Armridge Mountains came under attack from an invading force of [[frost giants]] in the {{YearlinkName|-300}}, and drove them off with aid from the empire of [[Raumathar]]. This event led to the area's Sossrim swearing fealty to Raumanthar, although that empire would crumble a century and a half later.

In the {{YearlinkName|331}}, the Sossrim clans were united under the first king of Sossal, [[Ylaethar]] "The Bear."
