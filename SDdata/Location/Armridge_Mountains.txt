The Armridge Mountains, also known as the Ushar Mountains,This alternative name seems to appear only in The Great Glacier (1992), so it could be reasonably inferred that this is the Armridge Mounatins name in the Ulutiun language. were a mountain range in Sossal near the border with the Great Glacier.
The Armridge Mountains sat in the west of Sossal just outside the eastern edge of the Great Glacier, and lay due northeast of the Glaciers Novularond Mountains.
The Sossrim settlements of Uldfest and Shannath lay between the mountains eastern edges and the Angsaas Chain, while the settlement of Dharvil lay on the southeastern side. A road heading east from Dharvil connected these settlements to Sundice and then beyond to Naupau on the coast, while a trail known as "The Reach" heading south from Uldfast connected them to the Great Glacier and then beyond to far off Vaasa.
The Forrok Stream originated in the southeastern corner of the mountains and flowed west into the Glacier.
The Armridge Mountains were settled in  by a clan of Rashemi explorers and traders. They were led by a warrior named Soss, and would come to be known as the first of the Sossrim.
