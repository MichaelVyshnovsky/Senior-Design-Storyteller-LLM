        "mainbody": "Quaraqand was a city in the Plain of Horses of northwestern Kara-Tur. It was the home of the Igidujin tribe.\nThe city stood deep in the southern Chigidi Mountains, leaving it quite isolated.\nThe city was ruled by the cruel and despotic Qaland family.\nUnder the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. However, the most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain.\nFurthermore, Qaland Takk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by Takk himself.\nFrom Quaraqand, the Igidujin often raided the surrounding villages, nomad camps, and caravans, especially those of the Fankiang tribe, whom Takk hated. Ostensibly, most of these raids were to steal Steppe horses but in truth it was largely to sate their bloodlust. They massacred their victims, leaving no man, woman, or child alive.\nThe Igidujin favored clubs, both the war club known as chokhor modo and the throwing club called a sidam. Their commanders also employed hawks trained to attack targets."
