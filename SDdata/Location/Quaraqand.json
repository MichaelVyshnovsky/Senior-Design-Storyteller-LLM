        "mainbody": "'''Quaraqand''' was a city in the [[Plain of Horses]] of northwestern [[Kara-Tur]]. It was the home of the [[Igidujin]] tribe.",
        "Geography": "The city stood deep in the southern [[Chigidi Mountains]], leaving it quite isolated.",
        "Government": "The city was ruled by the cruel and despotic [[Qaland]] family.",
        "Law & Order": "Under the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. However, the most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain.\n\nFurthermore, Qaland T'akk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by T'akk himself.",
        "Activities": "From Quaraqand, the Igidujin often raided the surrounding villages, nomad camps, and caravans, especially those of the [[Fankiang]] tribe, whom T'akk hated. Ostensibly, most of these raids were to steal [[Steppe horse]]s but in truth it was largely to sate their bloodlust. They massacred their victims, leaving no man, woman, or child alive.",
        "Defenses": "The Igidujin favored [[club]]s, both the war club known as ''chokhor modo'' and the throwing club called a ''sidam''. Their commanders also employed [[hawk]]s trained to attack targets."
