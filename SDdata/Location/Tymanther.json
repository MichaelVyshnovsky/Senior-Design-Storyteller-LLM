        "mainbody": "Tymanther was a displaced section of the Abeiran, militaristic, dragonborn-ruled state of Tymanchebar. Tymanther was located in the Old Empires region that was once southern Unther. The bulk of the dragonborn population resided in its capital, the citadel city of Djerad Thymar.\nDespite having been ripped from the world of Abeir, Tymanther was a relatively calm and arid mesa-land of forests, mountains, and plains. some creatures native to Abeir inhabited the region, such as the scathebeasts.\nTymanther originally encompassed the territory between the Black Ash Plain and the Riders to the Sky. and the southern coast of the Alamber Sea\n* Marthessel\n* Black Ash Plain\n* Menesankh\n* Greenfields\n* River Alamber\n* River of Swords\n* Unthangol Mountains\n* Methtir\n* Methmere\n* Methwood\n* Riders to the Sky\n* Winding River\nDjerad Thymar was the seat of power for the highly militant dragonborn kingdom, struggling to make a name for themselves in the lands of Faerûn. Tymanther was ruled by the Vanquisher, who acted as both a monarch and a general.\nTymanther was misunderstood as a nation and its trading partners were limited. As of 1479 DR, it had good relations with both High Imaskar and Chessenta, despite the mutual enmity of both nations. They held a deep mistrust of the dragon princes of Murghôm, believing they were only a step away from the tyrannical dragon empires of Abeir, and were openly hostile toward Akanûl, owing to a longstanding grudge with the genasi of that land, and engaged in brief skirmishes with the lands military forces.\nIn 1486 DR, during the Mulhorandi rebellion against the Imaskari, High Imaskar asked for Tymantheran military aid, but the Thymari chose to openly cut diplomatic relations instead, as they had not forgotten that the Imaskari failed to fulfill their promise to help them during their political crisis with Chessenta in 1479 DR. Despite this, Tymanther maintained a good diplomatic relationship with Deep Imaskar.\nAs of 1489 DR, Tymanther was in an open war against the returned nation of Unther, as the God-king Gilgeam was adamant in his ambition to reclaim all of the former lands of Unther.\nThe vast majority of Tymantherans shared a common culture that was based on a sense of responsibility to their clans  and had a highly militaristic lifestyle, with hierarchical castes and strict laws. All citizens spent some time in the Lance Defenders, the kingdoms highly trained army, and the population was ever-ready to take up arms again should their country be threatened.\nThe Tymantherans had a known tolerance for races of all kinds, extending their courtesy even to races who were generally disliked, such as tieflings. This tolerance did not, however, equate to equality before the law and only dragonborn were allowed to participate in Tymanthers authoritarian government.\nThe Tymantherans had a strong and abiding hatred of dragons, perpetuated by terrifying tales of draconic cruelty and retelling of the dragonborn struggle for freedom on Abeir. Though the dragons of Toril had nothing to do with this horrid past that haunted the race, the dragonborn were not particularly forgiving in this regard, and individuals who took up dragon-hunting for whatever reasons were honored as heroes among the Tymantherans. This hatred of dragons was strong, even carrying over to a condemnation of the worship of good dragon gods, such as Bahamut.\nAlthough individuals could worship the gods if they wanted to, the worshiping of the gods was something frowned upon by most traditionalist clans. Despite that, the faiths of Bahamut and Tiamat had a strong presence in the area. Worshiping Tiamat was illegal—making this religion a minor and secretive cult. The Platinum Cadre was the official Bahamutan church in Tymanther.\nIlmater and Chauntea were also popular gods in Tymanther, although their faiths only were present in the outlying villages and homesteads.\nIn 1487 DR, the religion of the god Enlil was officially allowed in Tymanther, after the advent of the Second Sundering.\nThe bulk of Tymanthers population was composed of dragonborn, most of them descendants of the survivors of Tymanchebars destruction, although a few dragonborn were also immigrants from Laerakond who had traveled to Tymanther to join the Thymari clans. Although tieflings were a minority of the Tymantheran population, they were openly accepted by the dragonborn. Humans and dwarves also were a minority in the outlying Tymantheran settlements.\nAfter the Second Sundering, a minority of Mulani refugees who fled from Unther were also allowed to join the Tymantherans after they helped the dragonborn in their battle against the Untherans.\nIn the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR, during the Spellplague, the Abeiran nation of Tymanchebar was dropped onto the region of Unther, whose kingdom in turn was transported to Abeir. The surviving dragonborn of Djerad Thymar founded the kingdom of Tymanther in tribute to their lost brethren, and to the kingdom they believed they had accidentally destroyed.\nDuring the Wailing Years, the dragonborn had to fight to survive in a land full of Spellplague-mutated horrors, but they eventually tamed the land and prospered as a nation. Around 1479 DR, Tymanther was making a name for itself with its small elite cadres of soldiers attacking well-known dragon lairs. Some of these troops returned as heroes, and they spread the reputation of Tymanther to the rest of Faerûn. Thymari dragonborn were sought out as skilled mercenaries by other Faerûnian nations.\nIn the Year of the Ageless Ones, 1479 DR, due to the plans of the taaldaraxi of Brimstones xorvintaal, Tymanther was facing diplomatic problems with Chessenta and Akanûl. Although Tymanther sent an ambassador to try to solve the situation in a peaceful manner, negotiations went bad, mostly because the Thymari were also allies of High Imaskar. The situation worsened when a group of abishai disguised as dragonborn began to kill Chessentan citizens. When the killers were discovered by the Brotherhood of the Griffon, the Thymari diplomatic delegation was kicked out of Chessenta, and the relationship between the two nations became delicate.\nAt the same time, Tymanther had been invaded by ash giant tribes controlled by the green dragon Skuthosiin. Thanks to Vanquisher Tarhuns military acumen, as well as the actions of heroes such as the paladin Medrash, the Thymari were able to kill Skuthosiin, after having besieged his fortress of Ashhold on Flamerule 5, ending the giant threat to Tymanther.\nOn Nightal 26 of the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR, as part of the Second Sundering, the lands of Unther that had been transported to Abeir by the Spellplague returned to Toril, while at the same time Tymanther was about to be returned to Abeir. On the same day, the god Enlil returned to Toril, summoned by Kepeshkmolik Dumuzi. Enlil manifested in Djerad Thymar in the form of a dragonborn, stopping the process that would return Tymanther to Abeir and choosing the dragonborn as his new protégés. However, the dragonborn nation was reduced to Djerad Thymar, Djerad Kethendi, and small holdings along the coast of the Alamber Sea and Ash Lake.\nThe Untherites immediately went to war with Tymanther, and tried to regain their former lands, but the dragonborn fiercely defended what little territory they had, triggering the First Tymanther–Unther War. Although the Tymantherans won that war and expelled the Untherite forces from their territory, Gilgeam never relented from his ambition and, as of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR, both nations were waging another war.\nthumb|right|400px|A map of Tymanther circa 1486 DR.\n* Arush Ashuak, a village that served as the breadbasket of Tymanther, located on the Greenfields.\n* Arush Vayem, a small, isolated village located in the Smoking Mountains. \n* Djerad Kethendi, a port city in the Alamber Sea.\n* Djerad Thymar, the dominant Tymantheran settlement and its capital city.\n* Ruinspoke, a village that served as the base of operations for adventurers exploring Untheran ruins.\n* Kepeshkmolik Thymara, founder of Djerad Thymar on Faerûn. \n* Kepeshkmolik Tarhun, Vanquisher of Tymanther in 1479 DR and until his death in 1486 DR.\n* Yrjixtilex Kallan, Tarhuns successor in 1487 DR.\n* Daardendrien Medrash, a paladin of Torm and Bahamut, and a national hero of Tymanther in the 1480s DR.\n* Verthisathurgiesh Mehen, an accomplished mercenary in the late years of the 15th century DR.\n* Kepeshkmolik Dumuzi, the first cleric of Enlil after the Second Sundering."
