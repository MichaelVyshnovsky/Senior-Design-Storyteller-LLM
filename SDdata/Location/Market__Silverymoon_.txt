The Market was a large open area in Silverymoon set aside for merchants to sell their wares. It was a very popular area for folk of the city to frequent in the warmer months of the year.
The Market was located in Northbank. It began at Hunters Gate on the northern wall and divided Northbank by stretching south all the way to the Docks. The High Palace, the temples, and most of the homes of the nobles were located east of the Market.
