'''Hisssta''' was a major port of the planet [[Coliar]] in [[Realmspace]],

==Description==
[[File:Hall of the People Interior-PoR.png|thumb|left|''A lizardfolk sits at a stone desk in Hisssta's Hall of the People.'']]
Hisssta was a [[lizardfolk]] [[spelljamming]] port. Like all land masses within the atmosphere of Coliar, Hisssta was a floating island, one of many thousands.

The port contained several structures. A stream flowed through the town and poured off the edge to fall to unfathomable depths.

==Government==
The lizardfolk of Coliar maintained primitive communistic governments. On Hisssta, that government's business was centralized at the Hall of the People.

==Trade==

Hisssta charged a moorage fee of 90 [[gold piece]]s and an air tax of 40 gold pieces. This was an exorbitant tax compared to the average 5-gold-piece air tax imposed at other lizarfolk ports within the planet. An additional cargo tax was also charged, which was based on the amount of cargo being carried by mooring [[spelljammer]]s.

The communal government maintained a publicly owned warehouse where off-world trade deals were arranged and goods were purchased, sold, and stored.

==Religion==
[[File:Temple of Semuanya Interior-PoR.png|thumb|right|''A lizardfolk preacher in the temple of [[Semuanya]] on Hisssta.'']]
The islanders of Hisssta were known to revere the god [[Semuanya]], and the port contained at least one temple dedicated to him.
