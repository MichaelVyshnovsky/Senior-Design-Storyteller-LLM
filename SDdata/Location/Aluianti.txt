'''Aluianti''' was a village of [[gold elves]] in [[Semberholme]].

==Description==
Aluianti was one of the smaller settlements within the region, typically housing no more than fifty residents at any given time. The village boasted an exclusive populace of gold elves, although it remained open and welcoming to all elves.

==Trade==
At the heart of Aluianti's cultural identity lied its artisans, whose creative endeavors garnered widespread admiration. The inhabitants of the village were primarily skilled artisans, channeling their expertise into crafting exquisite pottery, exceptional paintings, and masterful jewelry adorned with precious gems. Aluianti's artistic offerings have earned it a reputation for producing works of unparalleled beauty and craftsmanship.

==History==
Aluianti was established in The Year of Tomes, -54 DR. Seeking respite from the tumultuous political climate in Cormanthor and driven by concerns for the clan's prosperity, the influential heads of the Aluianti families made the pivotal decision to relocate to this idyllic locale.
