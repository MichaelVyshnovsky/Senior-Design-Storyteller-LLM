'''Brannoch''' was a small town located on the island of [[Snowdown]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
Brannoch was located in eastern Snowdown along the coast of the [[Sea of Swords]]. Brannoch was unique among Snowdown's settlments in that it was the only one not connected to [[Snowdown Ride]]. This was largely because the marsh of [[Maloren Sods]] separated the town from the rest of the island, making constructing a road to Brannoch nearly impossible.
