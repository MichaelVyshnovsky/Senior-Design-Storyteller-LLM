'''Ataaz Kahakla''', meaning '''Gorge of Death''' in the [[Chultan language]], was a canyon on the [[River Tath]] in [[Chult]].

{{Quote|Fear notâ€¦ The gorge is named for the ancient [[coral]] it is cut through, and the skeletons of long-dead creatures interred within.|[[Azaka Stormfang]], jungle guide}}

==Description==
Ranging in height from 50 to 200 feet (15 to 60 meters), the cliff face was lined with many rows of coral. Although dead, the coral kept its colors, making for a multicolored display that seemed as if the cliff was underwater. Amidst the coral were also whole skeletons of sea creatures, including [[giant shark]]s and [[Plesiosaurus|plesiosaur]]s. It was an awe-inspiring sight.

==Geography==
The River Tath passed through Ataaz Kahlaka as it turned sharply west to empty into [[Jahaka Bay]] between the [[Mistcliff Mountains]] to the north and the [[Kobold Mountains]] to the south.

===Flora & Fauna===
The jungle along the gorge was home to [[dinosaur]]s, including [[triceratops]], as well as massive flocks of [[parrot]]s. The waters were home to [[crocodile]]s.

==Inhabitants==
Packs of [[pterafolk]] were known to attack travelers within the gorge.

Near the northern exit of the gorge dwelt the "guardian of the river": a particularly ornery plesiosaur which tried to prevent anyone from crossing.
