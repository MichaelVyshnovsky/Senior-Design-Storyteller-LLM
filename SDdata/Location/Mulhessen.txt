'''Mulhessen''' was a small town in [[Sembia]].

==Geography==
The town was located north of [[Saerloon]] along [[Belduuk Road]] where it met the [[Way of the Manticore]] between [[Selgaunt]] to the east and [[Daerlun]] to the west. The stretch of Belduuk Road leaving Mulhessen northward to [[Saerb]] was locally known as "[[Rattlebones Ride]]".<ref>{{Cite web/Realmslore/Melvos Hammerstars, Part Two}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Mulhessen pledged loyalty to Saerloon, after its armies and shades of [[Thultanthar]] ravaged and conquered the city of [[Ordulin]].
