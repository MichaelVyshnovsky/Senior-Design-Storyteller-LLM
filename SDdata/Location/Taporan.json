        "mainbody": "aporan was a small riverside settlment found in the nation of Rashemen.\nThe town comprised a series of stone buildings lined with cobblestone streets, an arrangement that was rather uncommon among towns and cities in Rashemen. It featured a broad stretch of waterfront docks that were always lined with pole-propelled vessels and other river boats.\nThe town was situated on the long road that extended south from the Huhrongs Road to the Golden Way, at the point where it crossed with the River Tir.\nTaporan was well known for the rowdy fishers and rivermen that conducted their business along the River Tir. Passage on a vessel downriver to Ashane cost 1 gp, with an upriver return trip priced at 3 gp. \nThe White Dragon and Goblin, and Wolf berserker lodges all maintained alehouses in Taporan. The Wolf lodge house was the largest of the three.\nWhile the towns rivermen were quite industrious, they were considered brave and even a bit foolhardy among their fellow Rashemaar. They were fond of boisterous singing and excessive drink, though maintained themselves while on the waters.\nThere were a disproportionate number of berserkers living within Taporan, given its reputation as a fishing community."
