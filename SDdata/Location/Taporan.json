        "mainbody": "'''Taporan''' was a small riverside settlment found in the nation of [[Rashemen]].",
        "Description": "The town comprised a series of stone buildings lined with cobblestone streets, an arrangement that was rather uncommon among towns and cities in Rashemen. It featured a broad stretch of waterfront docks that were always lined with pole-propelled vessels and other river boats.",
        "Geography": "The town was situated on the long road that extended south from the [[Huhrong's Road]] to the [[Golden Way]], at the point where it crossed with the [[River Tir]].",
        "Trade": "Taporan was well known for the rowdy fishers and rivermen that conducted their business along the [[River Tir]]. Passage on a vessel downriver to [[Ashane]] cost 1 [[gp]], with an upriver return trip priced at 3 [[gp]].",
        "Notable Locations": "The [[White Dragon lodge|White Dragon]] and [[Goblin lodge|Goblin]], and [[Wolf lodge|Wolf]] [[Rashemaar berserker|berserker]] lodges all maintained alehouses in Taporan. The Wolf lodge house was the largest of the three.",
        "Inhabitants": "While the town's rivermen were quite industrious, they were considered brave and even a bit foolhardy among their fellow [[Rashemaar]]. They were fond of boisterous singing and excessive drink, though maintained themselves while on the waters.\n\nThere were a disproportionate number of berserkers living within Taporan, given its reputation as a fishing community."
