        "History": "It was built by [[Lanaxis]] and formed the capital of the [[giant]] kingdom of [[Ostoria]] for over a thousand years. When [[Ulutiu]] died and his amulet began to freeze the northernmost part of [[Faer√ªn]], Voninheim was placed under threat by the advancing ice, but [[Othea]], Lanaxis's mother, forbade him from intervening. Lanaxis attempted to defy Othea, but Voninheim was destroyed by the ice."
