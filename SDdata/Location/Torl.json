        "History": "Torl was established in {{YearlinkName|50}} on the north-western bank of the Vilhon Reach.\n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Torl remained a port city, but by that time [[gold]] mines, which were the main attraction of the town, had been exhausted for the most part. The mined gold continued to flow through the town's ports, but its amounts were minuscule. In [[1370 DR]], rumors of a new rich gold vein in [[Aphrunn]] started to surface, promising a busy future for Torl, if the rumors were indeed true."
