        "mainbody": "The Free Barony of Felshroun was an independent town located in the Border Kingdoms.\nFelshroun was a diamond-shaped walled town located on the cross-road between Blacksaddle, Realm of the Smoking Star and Shandolphyns Reach along the north-west coast of the Border Kingdoms. Felshroun laid claim to the fertile meadows and small forests north of the Duskwood, between Lammatars Water and the West Dusking River.\nFelshroun was a crowded labyrinthine town. Narrow streets and alleys winded around buildings up to five stories high. \nFelshroun was ruled by a Free Baron, who was elected to rule for a decade. \nThe Free Baron ruled from the Hall of Domes, located at the center of Felshroun. It was from there the Free Baron acted as judge for criminal proceedings, financial disputes and merchant negotiations. Diplomats and important visitors were hosted within the Hall of Domes. the building contained the towns armory and dungeon. \nThe Free Baron appointed three individuals called the Knights of Justice as magistrates for the town. The Free Baron was protected by an all-women bodyguard detail. The detail, made up of veteran former pirates from the Inner Sea area, were heavily armed and each carried a hold person wand.\nThe true power in Felshroun were the Four Mages. The Four Mages were a relatively rare group in Faerûn, as four powerful wizards who agreed to live near each other in peace was indeed a rarity in the Realms. Each mage lived in one of the four towers along the walls of the town, were they lived in seclusion to focus on their magical studies or teaching their apprentices. Each of the Four Mages had apprentices, totalling about three dozen in total.\nFelshroun is famous for its horses. Merchants from as far away as Tashalar and the Vilhon Reach travel to the town yearly to purchase Felshrounan horses. \nThe town hosts a thriving local economy as well. Felshroun has two shopping districts, Fendle Street and Lorndragon Lane. Fendle Street is lined with small retailers and pawn shops selling all sorts of goods, and is the location of several taverns. Lorndragon Lane is a smaller street with shops catering to fine goods and items, such as gems and high fashion. Storrockh Street hosts stables for travellers and shops that rent and sell carts or coaches.\nHoundworm Street was home to Felshrouns black market and red light district. Due to the frequent fights and robberies, the street was heavily patrolled by the Foresters.\nThe town was protected by a diamond-shaped wall. At each corner of the wall was a tower, were the Four Mages lives. Each tower was heavily defended by various magical traps. \nFelshrouns defence was maintained by a company of rangers called the Foresters. In addition to defense of the town and its territory, the Foresters assisted the citizens in planting crops, repairing irrigation channels and the removal of diseased plants. Like most rangers, their uniforms were designed to blend in with the forest. Their leather armor was brown, green and grey. They each wore a maroon sash across their midriff, which had their unit symbol upon it, a silver falcon atop a bears paw.\nThe Foresters mounted regular patrols of a dozen units on horseback, with each unit accompanied by either a priest of Chauntea or Mielikki, or an apprentice of the Four Mages. The ranking member of each patrol wears a ring of shooting stars and a hunting horn cast from silver.\nA pseudo-militia called the Watchers assist the Foresters. Their duty was to light a special beacon when alerted by the call of a Foresters horn or ring of shooting stars. The beacons notified the reserve unit that a patrol required assistance. The reserve unit consisted of twenty-four Foresters and two apprentice wizards. This reserve unit headquarters was in Highgirt Hold near the Duskwood. Instead of riding horses, this unit rode pegasi.\nright|thumb|A map of the region surrounding Felshroun\nFelshroun was founded in  by the Four Mages. The four powerful wizards agreed to settle in the same area and life in peace with each other. The Four Mages built the four towers and the walls that connected them.\nOn Tarsakh 17 in , the Four Mages successfully repelled an attack on the town by the Red Wizards of Thay. This nighttime spellbattle was known as the Night of Fire.\n* Moldy Cheese and Laughing Spoon, Pinchbecks Tankard and The Rum Boot were popular taverns.\n* BlackBoars Eye, Dunselbows House, Mother Fustins, The Beardhouse, The Gone Gallant and The Sunset Swan were inns and rooming houses found within the town.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, the important inhabitants of the town were\n* Balaethan Aromm, the Free Baron.\n* Araundra Golaunstone, one of the Four Mages.\n* Durendair Hammask, one of the Four Mages.\n* Immirton Loaden, one of the Four Mages.\n* Selcheress Mhairtal, one of the Four Mages."
