Olostins Hold was a fortified keep lying between Everlund and Yartar just off the Evermoor Way, in the northwest edges of the High Forest. 
Olostins Hold was home to about 200 people and provided security for about 600 farmers and ranchers in the surrounding area. It was the only permanent human settlement in the High Forest.
This particular section of the High Forest was sometimes referred to as Turlangs Wood. The locals were very careful to not irritate the forces of the forest. The woodcutters cut down dead trees only. 
The hold existed prior to becoming known as the Dread Keep when it was the stronghold of Olostin, who secured it as a place safe from the arcanists of Netheril after being told its location by a phaerimm. It was razed and gutted by the Netherese around -477 DR, ending Olostins reign of terror.
In around 1372 DR, the inhabitants had difficulties facing the trolls driven away from the Evermoors down to the south. Due to these monstrous predators, the road between Yartar and Everlund became very dangerous.
