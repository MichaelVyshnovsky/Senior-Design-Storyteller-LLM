'''Olostin's Hold''' was a fortified keep lying between [[Everlund]] and [[Yartar]] just off the [[Evermoor Way]], in the northwest edges of the [[High Forest]]. 

==Description==
Olostin's Hold was home to about 200 people and provided security for about 600 farmers and ranchers in the surrounding area. It was the only permanent [[human]] settlement in the High Forest.

This particular section of the High Forest was sometimes referred to as [[Turlang's Wood]]. The locals were very careful to not irritate the forces of the forest. The woodcutters cut down dead trees only. 

==History==
The hold existed prior to becoming known as the Dread Keep when it was the stronghold of [[Olostin]], who secured it as a place safe from the arcanists of [[Netheril]] after being told its location by a [[phaerimm]]. It was razed and gutted by the Netherese around [[-477 DR]], ending Olostin's reign of terror.

In around [[1372 DR]], the inhabitants had difficulties facing the [[troll]]s driven away from the [[Evermoors]] down to the south. Due to these monstrous predators, the road between Yartar and Everlund became very dangerous.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Mardan Elthondsson]], lord of the village
* [[Borstad Nomephel]], leader of the largest shrine in the town
* [[Felevel the Green]], a powerful [[druid]]
* [[Uhrieved Hartshorn]], owner of the [[Flaming Flagon]] tavern, [[Zhent]] informant, and secret master of vicious brigands in the area
* [[Aedelvana]], an [[arcane]] spellcaster
* [[Keled Strongarm]], constable of the town
