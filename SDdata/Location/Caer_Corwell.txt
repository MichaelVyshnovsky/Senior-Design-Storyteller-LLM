'''Caer Corwell''' was a small city

==Geography==
The keep was located on a rocky cliff overlooking the common fields of [[Corwell]] and the waters of [[Corwell Firth]].

==Structure==
===Castle===
The castle was surrounded by a high wooden [[wikipedia:palisade|palisade]] which ended in a stone gatehouse. The front gates of the castle were made of strong wood and an iron [[wikipedia:portcullis|portcullis]] was lowered from the gatehouse, which had four stout watchtowers. Rising above the from the courtyard, the keep was protected by three [[wikipedia:parapet|parapeted]] towers; the banner of the [[Kendrick]] family, a silver [[bear]] on a black field, hung in splendor from the tallest point of the castle.

===City===
A large village green spread out below the keep with a [[druid]]'s grove, surrounded by a ring of massive oak trees in the center, that also contained a [[Moonwell]]. The small wooden buildings of the [[Ffolk]] were protected by a three-sided low stone wall. It was surrounded by storage buildings which the city itself was built around.

[[Elminster]] remarked that the city's inns, [[The Boar's Tusk]] and [[The Red Stag]] were fine. The Boar's Tusk was run by an old hunter named Garek and had an almost exclusively male customer base while the Red Stag was run by a former Waterdhavian barmaid named Miriam, who left the city for a rural life. It was a quieter establishment that specialized in savoury food.

==Notable locations==
* [[The Boar's Tusk]]
* [[The Red Stag]]

==Inhabitants==
[[Tristan Kendrick]] and his father's ward, [[Robyn Kendrick|Robyn]] were raised within the castle walls.

==History==
Around [[1375 DR]], the great city fell into ruins.
