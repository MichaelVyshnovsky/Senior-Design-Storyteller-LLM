Caer Corwell was a small city
The keep was located on a rocky cliff overlooking the common fields of Corwell and the waters of Corwell Firth.
The castle was surrounded by a high wooden palisade which ended in a stone gatehouse. The front gates of the castle were made of strong wood and an iron portcullis was lowered from the gatehouse, which had four stout watchtowers. Rising above the from the courtyard, the keep was protected by three parapeted towers the banner of the Kendrick family, a silver bear on a black field, hung in splendor from the tallest point of the castle.
A large village green spread out below the keep with a druids grove, surrounded by a ring of massive oak trees in the center, that also contained a Moonwell. The small wooden buildings of the Ffolk were protected by a three-sided low stone wall. It was surrounded by storage buildings which the city itself was built around.
Elminster remarked that the citys inns, The Boars Tusk and The Red Stag were fine. The Boars Tusk was run by an old hunter named Garek and had an almost exclusively male customer base while the Red Stag was run by a former Waterdhavian barmaid named Miriam, who left the city for a rural life. It was a quieter establishment that specialized in savoury food.
