        "History": "Ito-jo was the ancestral home of the [[Ito family]] in Maeshi, built on a small island near the coastline. Its misfortunes started when in {{YearlinkConvert|712|WY}}, the lordship of Ito went to [[Ito Saburo]], a greedy man secretly manipulated by a [[demon]] [[spirit]], a [[Krakentua (Ito-jo)|krakentua]]. Saburo was in a feud with the [[Nambu family]], a branch of the Ito family that had split from the main branch in {{YearlinkConvert|619|WY}}, over the governorship of Maeshi. In order to destroy his enemies, Saburo agreed to sacrifice one of the [[Seven Swords]] to the Krakentua in [[646 DR]].\n\nHowever, in {{YearlinkConvert|720|WY}}, despite the extinction of the Nambu clan, the [[sohei]] of the [[Sun Temple]] burned the castle to the ground on the [[Night of Burning Flowers]] and all the Ito family and their retainers were slain. Sensing the evil inside, the sohei placed an ''[[ancient curse]]'' over the castle's ruins.\n\nSome years afterward, it was discovered that the site was haunted by people who had died in the Night of Burning Flowers.\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|1433|WY}}, a group of twelve infected people—two men, three women, four children, and three elders—settled in the abandoned ruins of Ito-jo, where they occupied the old gardeners' huts and eked out a meager livelihood. They claimed to be refugees of the mainland and lived in fear. Although wary of visitors, they were not inhospitable, and would even put them up for the night, provided all windows and doors were barred and weapons put away. They all turned into tagamaling busos at midnight. Meanwhile, at least three [[tigbanua buso]] lived in the abandoned ruins of the castle of [[Ito-jo]] in Wa, where they scavenged for carrion in the crypts.<ref group=\"note\">While page 9 of ''Night of the Seven Swords'' refers to the reader from the tagamaling to the tigbuana, it is unknown what connection the two groups of buso have."
