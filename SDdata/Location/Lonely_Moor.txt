The Lonely Moor was an area of boggy land northwest of Evereska in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn. It was occupied by bands of gnolls and bugbears.
Some time during the mid-14 century DR, a scholar named Bookman Thomas sought to survey the Lonely Moor to uncover more information about a long-dead sorcerer from Netheril.
In the , a great battle took place in the moor, between an army of Daemonfey and the elves of Evereska and Evermeet. The battle turned in favor of the elves when Araevin Teshurr restored the mythal at Myth Glaurach to normal, and the demons on the battlefield were instantaneously un-summoned from the field.
* Aumvors Castle This black, basalt tower served as home to both Aumvor and, centuries later, his great-grand-niece Morasha.
In addition to the monstrous humanoids the Lonely Moor was home to smaller scavengers like jackals and hyenas.
