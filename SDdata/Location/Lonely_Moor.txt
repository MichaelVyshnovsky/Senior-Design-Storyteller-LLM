The '''Lonely Moor''' was an area of boggy land northwest of [[Evereska]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]]. It was occupied by bands of [[gnoll]]s and [[bugbear]]s.

==History==
Some time during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], a scholar named [[Bookman Thomas]] sought to survey the Lonely Moor to uncover more information about a long-dead sorcerer from Netheril.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a [[Battle of the Lonely Moor|great battle]] took place in the moor, between an army of [[Daemonfey]] and the [[elves]] of [[Evereska]] and [[Evermeet]]. The battle turned in favor of the elves when [[Araevin Teshurr]] restored the [[mythal]] at [[Myth Glaurach]] to normal, and the [[demon]]s on the battlefield were instantaneously un-summoned from the field.

==Notable locations==
* [[Aumvor's Castle]]: This black, basalt tower served as home to both Aumvor and, centuries later, his great-grand-niece [[Morasha]].

==Inhabitants==
In addition to the [[monstrous humanoid]]s the Lonely Moor was home to smaller scavengers like [[jackal]]s and [[hyena]]s.
