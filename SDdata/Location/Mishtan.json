        "mainbody": "'''Mishtan''' was one of many villages within the [[Great Vale]] of [[Mulhorand]], later deemed to be a small city, and was one of the nation's sixteen preceptual governments. It stood out from others due to being one of the centers of [[Osiris]] worship in Mulhorand and because it was the gateway to the [[Land of the Dead]]&mdash;the resting place of Mulhorand's [[pharaoh]]s and their families.",
        "Government": "Mishtan had a preceptual government, which ruled over both the city and the nearby Land of the Dead. of the temple known as the [[Gateway to the Afterworld]]. Its ruler in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], as recommended to the vizier by the Osiran priesthood, was the Precept [[Temis]].",
        "Trade": "Tombs for the pharaohs and other construction projects were a never-ending occurrence in Mishtan, as the Osiran clergy were in charge of the Land of the Dead. During the flood season, the village was typically teeming with artisans, masons, and [[slavery|slaves]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Mishtan's regular population in [[1357 DR]] was 2,000, but could easily swell to 30,000 if a large construction project was taking place. These surplus workers would dwell within makeshift homes surrounding Mishtan. By [[1372 DR]], the stable population of Mishtan was around 6,459."
