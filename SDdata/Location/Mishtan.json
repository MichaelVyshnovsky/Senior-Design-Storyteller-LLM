Its ruler in the 14 century DR, as recommended to the vizier by the Osiran priesthood, was the Precept Temis.\nTombs for the pharaohs and other construction projects were a never-ending occurrence in Mishtan, as the Osiran clergy were in charge of the Land of the Dead. During the flood season, the village was typically teeming with artisans, masons, and slaves.\nMishtans regular population in 1357 DR was 2,000, but could easily swell to 30,000 if a large construction project was taking place. These surplus workers would dwell within makeshift homes surrounding Mishtan. By 1372 DR, the stable population of Mishtan was around 6,459."
