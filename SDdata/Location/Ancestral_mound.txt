An '''ancestral mound''', or '''ancestor mound''', was a holy place of utmost important to the tribal peoples of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Activities==
Every [[Uthgardt]] tribe had an associated mound, which was fixed at a specific location. Here, they believed their founders of tribe were buried, and worshiped [[totem]]s, particularly during [[Runemeet]]. An altar mound, carved into the shape of a tribe's totem beast, was placed in the centre of an ancestral mound.

Multiple tribes could share their ancestral mound, such as the [[Black Lion tribe]] and [[Red Tiger tribe]], whose ancestral mound was [[Beorunna's Well]]. Other known mounds were: [[Raven Rock]], the [[Great Worm Cavern]], [[Flint Rock]], [[Morgur's Mound]], [[Stone Stand]], [[Shining White]] and the [[Grandfather Tree]].

Most family groups, or clans of a specific tribe, would live only a few weeks trek from their ancestral mound.

Tribal [[shaman]]s could cast [[spell]]s on such a mound to bring forth a ghostly apparition of an ancestor. Doing so was very beneficial, but also somewhat risky. Shamans who were not wise enough could become subject to the uncontrollable wrath of the [[ghost]]. However, if controlled successfully, the ghost could be made to guard the ancestor mound, or tell the shaman ancient tribal secrets.

When shamans of a tribe would pass away, their relics, as well as their remains, would be buried in the mound.
