        "mainbody": "resttet was a village in the Nakvaligach region within the Great Glacier. It was the largest Nakulutiun settlement.\nKresttet was located in a desolate valley with a thick layer of permafrost, large boulders and was filled with crevasses. The crevasses covered the valleys floor like a web, each between  in width. Tremors were frequent, which caused new crevasses to form and existing ones to widen.\nThe village was made up of simple ceenach arrayed in a disorganized fashion. Planks and crude bridges crossed over the network of crevasses. The villages kaiurit dictated that no crevasse was to be filled or altered and that relocating a ceenach was forbidden. Kresttets source of fresh water was a stream located  north of the village.\nSince the valley was so barren, game was sparse for the villagers. The village had a small caribou herd and supplemented their diets by hunting the polar hares who lived in the valley and harvesting a type of edible lichen.\nThe residents of Kresttet were extremely hostile to outsiders, obeying a jyykach and killing any on sight. The corpses of their victims were then dumped into one of the many crevasses. The jyykach held until they reached their monthly jyykach quota. The residents had to face frequent attacks and raids from frost giants and white dragons."
