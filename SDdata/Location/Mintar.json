        "mainbody": "Mintar was a large city-state in the Land of the Lions region of south Faerûn, on the northwestern shores of the Lake of Steam, that was conquered by a faction of the Church of Bane led by Teldorn Darkhope in the mid-14 century DR.\nIt was connected to two roads, Darkhopes Road connecting it westward to the town of Kzelter and Tyrants Road (renamed from \"Coast Road\", in reference to Teldorn) connecting it eastward to the city-state of Saelmur. Below the surface, the catacombs of Mintar connected more or less directly to the beholder city of Zokir in the Underdark.\nEvery spring, the fields around Mintar were flooded by the swelling waters of the River Mintar.\nFrom  to circa ,The Code of the Harpers (1993) notes that the \"conflict\" between the Harpers and the Magelords of Mintar came to ahead in the midst of the Harpers invading the drow city of Undraeth. Powers & Pantheons (1997), which makes no mention of the Magelords, dates this conflict to circa 1150 DR. Later, Dragons of Faerûn (2006) would instead date the defeat of the Magelords at the hands of the Harpers to 1128 DR. As there are no other sources that corroborate the date given by Dragons of Faerûn, this can be considered an instance of misdating and thence the true downfall of the Magelords of Mintar was in 1150 DR. the city-state was a magocracy ruled by a cabal of wizards known as the Magelords of Mintar. \nAfter the fall of the Magelords, the city-state became a monarchy. Its rulers were officially referred to by the title of Grand Murlistar. However, Calishites, as well as many outsiders and Mintaran commoners, Under the rulership of Teldorn Darkhope, who declared himself to be the \"Dark Tyrant of Mintar\",3 edition sources continue to describe the city as Banite, thus Mintars state religion likely switched back sometime after Banes resurrection in 1372 DR. after it was revealed that they had in fact not been receiving their spells from a reborn Bane,\nThe other major power over the state was the Zhentarim. Originally an alliance forged by Fzoul Chembryl, One connected the city to the Citadel of the Raven, the other to Zhentil Keep.\nMintars other major ally was a group of beholders from the Alimir Hive that had been brought together by the elder orb Vaxall, who himself was another member of the Black Network.\nBefore its conquest by Banites, Mintar produced boats and ships, seafood, wagons, and wine. All of these goods continued to be produced following the Banite takeover, but ceased to be exported, save to the Mintaran occupied village of Kzelter. The one product that continued to see some limited export outside the city was wine, particularly the Mintar Gold that was produced by the merchant Georborg Fireblade, though part of his profits still went towards the coffers of the Church of Bane.\nEquipment shops were generally poorly stocked, as the Banites would purchase anything of use or value, though would only compensate merchants with just enough currency to keep them afloat. and life for slaves in the city was harsh.\nPrior to Mintars takeover by the Banites, giant leech hunting was a popular sport among the Mintaran nobility. These leeches, which grow to the size of small rowboats, would typically be lured to the surface by dropping blood or raw dropped into the water. Then the noble would spear the beast with a small, barbed harpoon. A long, violent struggle would ensue, eventually culminating in the giant leechs death.\nMintar was host to several fishing festivals that were held throughout every year. During these festivals, much notoriety was garnered by those nobiles who brought in the largest leeches. Besides fishing festivals, prior to Banite rule the city held a grand spring festival, simply known as the Celebration of Spring, to celebrate the receding of the River Mintars annual floodwaters.\nTeldorn would eventually instate his own holidays, some of them revolving around the citys gladiatorial arena, the Thunder Room.\nThe city was the base of Knights of the Black Gauntlet, a Banite military order of crusaders and helmed horrors. Their numbers were swelled over time by mercenary warriors and wizards,\nA special contingent of helmed horrors, the Doom Brigade, were created by Darkhope with the doom of Bane spell.\nCirca -5100 DR, Mintar began life as one of many garrisoned fortresses that were established by the armies of the First Kingdom of Mir. Sometime in the 25 years following the Mirran armys defeat at the hands of Jhaamdath in , on the plains north of the tiny fishing town of Ankhapur, Mintar along with the other Mirran fortresses were overtaken by the Jhaamdathan army as they pushed the Mirrans all the way back to garrisons at Fort Saradush.\nIn , after a year long siege on their eastern fronts, the leaders of Mir and Coramshan came together for negotiations and came to the conclusion that only unification of their states would ensure survival against Jhaamdath. United under the rulership of Ukhar IV, the Coramshite-Mirran army unleashed a devastating counterattack against the Jhaamdathans and within two months pushed them all the way back to Saelmur. The fighting continued on into , with Jhaamdath losing Saelmur. Eventually a truce was reached between the two nations, with the promise that both would abandon any claims over the Land of the Lions, leaving Mintar and others in the region independent.\nIn the , Mintar was struck by the Crimson Death and lost 16% of its population from the plague.\nIn the , during a Rage of Dragons the blue great wyrm Iryklathagra was driven to attack Mintar. She battled with its defenders for nearly a month before returning to her lair, leaving the city in ruins and many local ships sunk. Up until that conflict, a cabal of wizards known as the Magelords of Mintar had been vying for power in the shadows of the Mintaran government. With the devastation left by Iryklathagra, the few surviving Magelords arose as the city-states new leaders, promising to protect the populace against any further attacks by dragons.\nThe Magelords of Mintar become engaged in a conflict with the Harpers on the Turmish coast circa , having been hired by Calishite merchants to eliminate their presence in south Faerûn. The Magelords would ultimately lose this conflict and chaos would ensue in the city-state.\nSometime later during that period, Ankhapur tried to convince Mintar and Saelmur to unite into a single country. However, these efforts failed for a multitude of regions, such as the general preference among Arnadens for local governance and independence, trade dis-agreements, and difficulties with defenses.\nIn the wake of the Time of Troubles, Teldorn Darkhope, then a mid-ranking Banite and former adventurer that had settled in Mintar, was approached by the elder orb Vaxall under the polymorphed guise of a younger beholder with the assumed name of \"Xavlal\". Vaxall offered Darkhope an alliance with a group of beholders that it claimed to represent. Having prior to this received visions of conquest and reward while within the citys Banite temple (that were in actuality the work of Iyachtu Xvim under the guise of Bane), Darkhope was open to the idea and together the two forged a plan to sieze power in Mintar.\nOn Midwinters Eve in 1362 DR, Teldorn Darkhope and small company of the Knights of the Black Gauntlet appeared in the Mintaran palace through a ghostly black hand and slayed Obril Alaekyn,Faiths & Avatars (1996) refers to Teldorn and his Knights as having arrived in Obrils throne room, but Empires of the Shining Sea says they appeared in Obrils bedchambers. his fiancee Fyriana Darkenstar, and panicking mobs. At least one such mob blamed magic or mages in general for the Grand Murlistars death and stormed the mansion-and-tower home of Kosmal Ontos.\nKosmal tried to calm the mob down and disperse it, leaving his apprentice Enthos Raziir in his secret summoning chamber with a marilith named Malatorna that they had conjured and trapped with greater planar binding. Unwilling to listen to reason the mob attacked the wizard, restrained him, and burnt him at the stake. Not long after Raziir discovered his masters smoldering remains on the street and in a panic took what he could from the tower before fleeing to Saelmur.\nOver the next several days the black knights, backed up by twice the number of helmed horrors and their flameskull commanders, eliminated all opposition within Mintar &ndash the churches, its two schools of swordsmanship, and the local thieves guild, and anyone else that dared to openly disagree with the proclamations of Teldorn. They sacked and burned citys temples. Much of Mintar would burn down over the first few weeks of occupation. Though at first intentional, the damage grew out of the hands of the Banites as the fire spread.\nNon-Banite priests were attacked, hunted down, and burned at the stake. Some managed to flee the city and lead other refugees to safety,\nAfter the major threats to his rule were eliminated, Teldorn went about recruiting mercenary forces from all across south Faerûn. The buildings that were destroyed from the fires during takeover would eventually be either rebuilt or replaced, providing the Mintaran army much needed space to house its troops, horses, and equipment.\nIn , a Mintaran troop on a wide patrol beyond the city-state under the guise of bandits or slavers encountered a small group of Ala-min. Feelign that the tribesmen were foraging too close to Mintar the troops attacked. Caliym Zalaster and his personal guards came across the scene and intervened, killing several of the troops and taking their heads, but in the process Zalaster was killed. Due to the disguises as bandits, Mintars blame for the murder of the Ala-min leader went unknown.\nBy , the city was firmly under the iron rule of Teldorn Darkhope. as part of a holy quest. By stonewalking to various Banite and Xvimlar holy sites, Fzoul managed to travel from Mulmaster to Mintar over a period of 17 days. On Nightal 7 he arrived with great fanfare from the populace, but quickly went about meeting with Teldorn in private. Alone, Fzoul scarred Teldorn with the mark of Xvim, flooding his mind with visions from Xvim. At that moment Tendor realized that he had been receiving his powers and spells from the Baneson all along and converted to his church.\nAt dawn on Nightal 8, Teldorn Darkhope addressed the masses and troops of Mintar, announcing their alliance with Fzoul Chembryl. Fzoul in head recognized Teldorn as the \"Lord Knight Imperceptor of the Baneson\" and the head of his own sect of the Church of Xvim.\nBy the end of 1369 DR, Mintar was mustering its forces for an invasion of Kzelter, There had long been local legends of an ancient stash of powerful magic, Tethyrian treasures, and weapons buried somewhere near or beneath Kzelter. Iyachtu Xvim confirmed the existence of this lost armory to Fzoul and Teldorn in the visions he provided, urging them to seek it out as a holy quest.\nIn the month of Uktar, the counts of the Tethyrian counties Mirkazar and Surkazar sent intelligence reports that suggested a buildup of troops and army movements in Mintar. In response, Tethyr sent a small contingent of troops to Kzelter.\nFrom Nightal 10 to Nightal 26, Teldorn and Fzoul managed to secretly ascertain the location of hidden armory beneath Kzelter and the nearby Plains of Pehrifaal.  From the armory, Fzoul took eleven tyrant blades. With knowledge of the armory in their hands, the two went about planning the conquest of Kzelter in earnest, wanting to ensure their control over it. Fzoul then returned to Zhentil Keep to construct a stone walk link between Mintar and Zhentil Keep.\nIn the month of Hammer, the contingent of Tethyrian troops detected no activity from Mintar, their scouts and spies unable to even find the supposed amassed army. In response, the commander of the troops sent a request to Count Yuldar Llistiin for them to disband. Finding themselves invigorated with new-found strength by the fog, the Knights of the Black Gauntlet marched upon Kzelter.\nThe bulk of the troops surrounded the town under the cover of the Forest of Mir, the Thornwood, and the Qatarn Hills.\nIn the month of Flamerule, Tethyr sent two thousand troops to their garrison town of Ithal Pass in anticipation of a further Mintaran advance, bolstering Tethyrs south. Around that same time, Mintar began sending caravans of troops and supplies north. Information on their movements would be leaked to both Tethyr and Calimshan, leading both nations to reinforce their eastern borders, though later intelligence reports showed little activity among the massed Mintaran forces. The nation of Saelmur would likewise beef up its defenses.\nIn Eleint the syl-pasha of Calimshan offered his aid to Tethyr and sent a token force to retake Kzelter. However, the syl-pasha was likewise interested in the legendary lost armory and ordered his troops that, should they free the town, to search for it before turning Kzelter over to the authorities.\nIn Uktar, Fzoul Chembryl constructed a stone walk site at the Citadel of the Raven, linking it to Mintar, then traveled to the city to congratulate Teldorn on his conquest of Kzeltar. Fzoul then stayed at Mintar for a tenday, enjoying the warmth of the Lake of Steam region.\nThough Teldorn had desired to commit more military action that year, but was stymied back home by strikes, popular uprisings,Sleep of Ages and [https//web.archive.org/web/20040619185816/http//www.wizards.com80/default.asp?x=dnd/pg/20030806x Portals Under the Black Gauntlet] state that (part of) the reason for the stall in military action was Teldorn having difficulty locating the lost armory. Page 154 of Empires of the Shining Sea agrees with these sources, in at least that it states Teldorns forces were having no luck finding the armory. However, Cloak & Dagger had him and Fzoul \"...secretly uncover the hidden armory...\" a year prior. Thus hostilities between Kzelter and Ithal Pass were few and far between, as the Tethyrians and Mintarans both focused their efforts towards refortifying and planning for the future. and schemed to one day conquer large portions of the Sword Coast South.\nIn 1372 DR, Teldorn and his forces were standing by, awaiting orders from Fzoul on what city to wage war against next.\nIn 1373 DR, in the midst of Sammasters Rage of Dragons, the red great wyrm Balagos flew over the Land of the Lions and unleashed a firestorm in Mintar and Saelmur, killing over half of the population of both city-states.\nAround 1370 DR, rumors circulated around the cities of Ankhapur, Darromar, and Saelmur that Mintar was selling much of its imprisoned youth off into slavery. According to the rumors, this \"conscription service\" was being done in order to raise funds for to pay off the increasing numbers of mercenaries that were under Mintars employ, mercenary forces that speculated as being amassed for battle against lthal Pass.\nAround that same period rumors began to circulate around the Nagalands suggesting that Mintaran agents had uncovered a lost method for transforming water nagas into banelar nagas. The increasing presence of the latter within the Nagawater were speculated to be a result of this.\n* Academy of the Drawn Sword, a school of swordsmanship that was burned down by several fireballs cast by mages under the Banite payroll.\n* The Magelords Rest, an inn. Like every other inn and boarding house in Mintar, it was occupied by the citys troops.\n* Market Plaza. Under Taldorns rule, it was occupied by the tents of many of the citys troops.\n* Master of the Blade Academy, another school of swordsmanship.\n* Mage Tower, residence of the marilith Malatorna.\n* Suns Shadow Shrine.\n* Temple of the Dark Lord, the citys central Banite temple.\n* The Thunder Room, a government building turned gladitorial arena and Banite shrine.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, the permanent residents of Mintar typically numbered around a minimum of 45,000, with the population exceeding 50,000 during the summer months. By 1370 DR, Banite tithing records estimated the population to be at 34,000 and to mostly consist of humans. By that time very few mages remained in the city and sages were nearly non-existent. Those that remained of both groups were largely those that served under Teldorn.\nA resistance movement existed among the populace, referred to by some as the \"Pursuers of Freedom\" due to the central role of the Pursuers of Pure Knowledge, the Oghmanytes of Mintar that chose to remain in the city. They were dedicated to the cause of documenting everything that transpired in the city so that the Banites could one day be held accountable for their crimes, as well as hindering and impeding the efforts of the Banites."
