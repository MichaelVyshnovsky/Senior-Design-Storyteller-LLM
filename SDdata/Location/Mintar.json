        "mainbody": "'''Mintar''' was a large city-state in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faerûn]], on the northwestern shores of the [[Lake of Steam]], that was conquered by a faction of the [[Church of Bane]] led by [[Teldorn Darkhope]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "It was connected to two roads, [[Darkhope's Road]] connecting it westward to the town of [[Kzelter]] and [[Tyrant's Road]] (renamed from \"Coast Road\", in reference to Teldorn) connecting it eastward to the city-state of [[Saelmur]]. Below the surface, the catacombs of Mintar connected more or less directly to the [[beholder]] city of [[Zokir]] in the [[Underdark]].\n\nEvery spring, the fields around Mintar were flooded by the swelling waters of the [[River Mintar]].",
        "Government": {
            "Allegiances": "Mintar's other major ally was a group of beholders{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|57}} from the [[Alimir Hive]] that had been brought together by the [[elder orb]] [[Vaxall]], who himself was another member of the Black Network.<ref>"
        },
        "Trade": "Before its conquest by Banites, Mintar produced boats and ships, seafood, [[wagon]]s, and [[wine]]. All of these goods continued to be produced following the Banite takeover, but ceased to be exported, save to the Mintaran occupied village of Kzelter. The one product that continued to see some limited export outside the city was wine, particularly the [[Mintar Gold]] that was produced by the merchant [[Georborg Fireblade]], though part of his profits still went towards the coffers of the Church of Bane.\n\nEquipment shops were generally poorly stocked, as the Banites would purchase anything of use or value, though would only compensate merchants with just enough currency to keep them afloat. and life for slaves in the city was harsh.",
        "Culture": {
            "Festivals & Holidays": "Mintar was host to several fishing festivals that were held throughout every year. During these festivals, much notoriety was garnered by those nobiles who brought in the largest leeches. Besides fishing festivals, prior to Banite rule the city held a grand spring festival, simply known as the Celebration of Spring, to celebrate the receding of the River Mintar's annual floodwaters.\n\nTeldorn would eventually instate his own holidays, some of them revolving around the city's gladiatorial arena, the [[Thunder Room]]."
        },
        "Defenses": "The city was the base of [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]], a Banite military order of [[crusader]]s and [[helmed horror]]s. Their numbers were swelled over time by [[mercenary]]{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals Under the Black Gauntlet}} [[warrior]]s and wizards,\n\nA special contingent of helmed horrors, the [[Doom Brigade]], were created by Darkhope with the ''[[doom of Bane]]'' spell.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|72}}",
        "History": {
            "Banite Coup": "In the wake of the [[Time of Troubles]], Teldorn Darkhope, then a mid-ranking Banite and former [[adventurer]] that had settled in Mintar, was approached by the elder orb Vaxall under the ''[[polymorph]]ed'' guise of a younger beholder with the assumed name of \"Xavlal\". Vaxall offered Darkhope an alliance with a group of beholders that it claimed to represent. Having prior to this received visions of conquest and reward while within the city's Banite temple (that were in actuality the work of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] under the guise of Bane), Darkhope was open to the idea and together the two forged a plan to sieze power in Mintar.\n\nOn [[Midwinter|Midwinter's Eve]] in [[1362 DR]], Teldorn Darkhope and small company of the Knights of the Black Gauntlet appeared in the Mintaran palace through a ghostly black hand and slayed [[Obril Alaekyn]],''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' (1996) refers to Teldorn and his Knights as having arrived in Obril's throne room, but ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' says they appeared in Obril's bedchambers. his fiancee [[Fyriana Darkenstar]], and panicking mobs. At least one such mob blamed [[magic]] or mages in general for the Grand Murlistar's death{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals Under the Black Gauntlet:The Mage-Tower Portal}} and stormed the [[Mage Tower|mansion-and-tower]] home of [[Kosmal Ontos]].\n\nKosmal tried to calm the mob down and disperse it, leaving his apprentice [[Enthos Raziir]] in his secret summoning chamber with a [[marilith]] named [[Malatorna]] that they had conjured and trapped with ''[[greater planar binding]]''. Unwilling to listen to reason the mob attacked the wizard, restrained him, and burnt him at the stake. Not long after Raziir discovered his master's smoldering remains on the street and in a panic took what he could from the tower before fleeing to Saelmur.\n\nOver the next several days the black knights, backed up by twice the number of helmed horrors and their [[flameskull]] commanders, eliminated all opposition within Mintar &ndash; the churches, its two schools of swordsmanship, and the local [[thieves' guild]], and anyone else that dared to openly disagree with the proclamations of Teldorn. They sacked and burned city's temples. Much of Mintar would burn down over the first few weeks of occupation. Though at first intentional, the damage grew out of the hands of the Banites as the fire spread.\n\nNon-Banite priests were attacked, hunted down, and burned at the stake. Some managed to flee the city and lead other refugees to safety,",
            "Banite Rule": "After the major threats to his rule were eliminated, Teldorn went about recruiting mercenary forces from all across south Faerûn. The buildings that were destroyed from the fires during takeover would eventually be either rebuilt or replaced, providing the Mintaran army much needed space to house its troops, [[horse]]s, and equipment.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1368}}, a Mintaran troop on a wide patrol beyond the city-state under the guise of [[bandit]]s or slavers encountered a small group of [[Ala-min]]. Feelign that the tribesmen were foraging too close to Mintar the troops attacked. [[Caliym]] [[Zalaster]] and his personal guards came across the scene and intervened, killing several of the troops and taking their heads, but in the process Zalaster was killed. Due to the disguises as bandits, Mintar's blame for the murder of the Ala-min leader went unknown.<ref>\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1369}}, the city was firmly under the iron rule of Teldorn Darkhope. as part of a holy quest. By ''stonewalking'' to various Banite and Xvimlar holy sites, Fzoul managed to travel from [[Mulmaster]] to Mintar over a period of 17 days. On [[Nightal 7]] he arrived with great fanfare from the populace, but quickly went about meeting with Teldorn in private. Alone, Fzoul scarred Teldorn with the ''[[mark of Xvim]]'', flooding his mind with visions from Xvim. At that moment Tendor realized that he had been receiving his powers and spells from the Baneson all along and converted to his church.\n\nAt dawn on [[Nightal 8]], Teldorn Darkhope addressed the masses and troops of Mintar, announcing their alliance with Fzoul Chembryl. Fzoul in head recognized Teldorn as the \"Lord Knight Imperceptor of the Baneson\" and the head of his own sect of the Church of Xvim.\n\nBy the end of 1369 DR, Mintar was mustering its forces for an invasion of Kzelter, There had long been local legends of an ancient stash of powerful magic, Tethyrian treasures, and weapons buried somewhere near or beneath Kzelter.<ref> Iyachtu Xvim confirmed the existence of this lost armory to Fzoul and Teldorn in the visions he provided, urging them to seek it out as a holy quest.\n\nIn the month of [[Uktar]], the counts of the Tethyrian counties [[Mirkazar]] and [[Surkazar]] sent intelligence reports that suggested a buildup of troops and army movements in Mintar. In response, Tethyr sent a small contingent of troops to Kzelter.\n\nFrom [[Nightal 10]] to [[Nightal 26]], Teldorn and Fzoul managed to secretly ascertain the location of hidden armory beneath Kzelter and the nearby [[Plains of Pehrifaal]].  From the armory, Fzoul took eleven ''[[tyrant blade]]s''. With knowledge of the armory in their hands, the two went about planning the conquest of Kzelter in earnest, wanting to ensure their control over it. Fzoul then returned to Zhentil Keep to construct a ''stone walk'' link between Mintar and Zhentil Keep.\n\nIn the month of [[Hammer]],<ref> the contingent of Tethyrian troops detected no activity from Mintar, their scouts and spies unable to even find the supposed amassed army. In response, the commander of the troops sent a request to Count [[Yuldar Llistiin]] for them to disband. Finding themselves invigorated with new-found strength by the fog, the Knights of the Black Gauntlet marched upon Kzelter.\n\nThe bulk of the troops surrounded the town under the cover of the [[Forest of Mir]], the Thornwood, and the [[Qatarn Hills]].\n\nIn the month of [[Flamerule]], Tethyr sent two thousand troops to their garrison town of [[Ithal Pass]] in anticipation of a further Mintaran advance, bolstering Tethyr's south.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|52}}<ref> Around that same time, Mintar began sending caravans of troops and supplies north. Information on their movements would be leaked to both Tethyr and Calimshan, leading both nations to reinforce their eastern borders, though later intelligence reports showed little activity among the massed Mintaran forces. The nation of Saelmur would likewise beef up its defenses.\n\nIn [[Eleint]] the [[syl-pasha]] of Calimshan offered his aid to Tethyr and sent a token force to retake Kzelter. However, the syl-pasha was likewise interested in the legendary lost armory and ordered his troops that, should they free the town, to search for it before turning Kzelter over to the authorities.\n\nIn [[Uktar]], Fzoul Chembryl constructed a ''stone walk'' site at the Citadel of the Raven, linking it to Mintar, then traveled to the city to congratulate Teldorn on his conquest of Kzeltar. Fzoul then stayed at Mintar for a [[tenday]], enjoying the warmth of the Lake of Steam region.\n\nThough Teldorn had desired to commit more military action that year, but was stymied back home by strikes, popular uprisings,''[[Dungeon magazine 69/Sleep of Ages|Sleep of Ages]]'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040619185816/http://www.wizards.com:80/default.asp?x=dnd/pg/20030806x Portals Under the Black Gauntlet]'' state that (part of) the reason for the stall in military action was Teldorn having difficulty locating the lost armory. Page 154 of ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' agrees with these sources, in at least that it states Teldorn's forces were having no luck finding the armory. However, ''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'' had him and Fzoul \"...secretly uncover the hidden armory...\" a year prior. Thus hostilities between Kzelter and Ithal Pass were few and far between, as the Tethyrians and Mintarans both focused their efforts towards refortifying and planning for the future. and schemed to one day conquer large portions of the [[Sword Coast South]].\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Teldorn and his forces were standing by, awaiting orders from Fzoul on what city to wage war against next.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals Under the Black Gauntlet:The Kzelter Portal}}\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], in the midst of [[Sammaster]]'s [[Rage of Dragons]], the [[red dragon|red]] great wyrm [[Balagos]] flew over the Land of the Lions and unleashed a firestorm in Mintar and Saelmur, killing over half of the population of both city-states.<ref>"
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Around 1370 DR, rumors circulated around the cities of Ankhapur, Darromar, and Saelmur that Mintar was selling much of its imprisoned youth off into slavery. According to the rumors, this \"conscription service\" was being done in order to raise funds for to pay off the increasing numbers of mercenaries that were under Mintar's employ, mercenary forces that speculated as being amassed for battle against lthal Pass.\n\nAround that same period rumors began to circulate around the [[Nagalands]] suggesting that Mintaran agents had uncovered a lost method for transforming [[water naga]]s into [[banelar naga]]s. The increasing presence of the latter within the [[Nagawater]] were speculated to be a result of this.<ref>",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Academy of the Drawn Sword]], a school of swordsmanship that was burned down by several ''[[fireball]]s'' cast by mages under the Banite payroll.\n* The [[Magelords' Rest]], an inn. Like every other inn and boarding house in Mintar, it was occupied by the city's troops.\n* Market Plaza. Under Taldorn's rule, it was occupied by the [[tent]]s of many of the city's troops.\n* [[Master of the Blade Academy]], another school of swordsmanship.\n* [[Mage Tower]], residence of the marilith Malatorna.\n* [[Sun's Shadow Shrine]].<ref>\n* [[Temple of the Dark Lord]], the city's central Banite temple.\n* The [[Thunder Room]], a government building turned gladitorial arena and Banite shrine.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, the permanent residents of Mintar typically numbered around a minimum of 45,000, with the population exceeding 50,000 during the summer months. By 1370 DR, Banite tithing records estimated the population to be at 34,000 and to mostly consist of [[human]]s. By that time very few mages remained in the city and sages were nearly non-existent. Those that remained of both groups were largely those that served under Teldorn.\n\nA resistance movement existed among the populace, referred to by some as the \"Pursuers of Freedom\" due to the central role of the [[Pursuers of Pure Knowledge]], the [[Oghmanyte]]s of Mintar that chose to remain in the city. They were dedicated to the cause of documenting everything that transpired in the city so that the Banites could one day be held accountable for their crimes, as well as hindering and impeding the efforts of the Banites."
