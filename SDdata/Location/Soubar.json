The [[paladin]] knight [[Priam Agrivar]] planned to journey to the settlement, but was interrupted.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|1}}\n\nAs of [[1489 DR]], priests of [[Bane]] were rebuilding the [[Black Abbey]] a former [[Baneite]] monastery. This had brought in much needed skilled workers, trade, and wealth. The project was unpopular with some locals, but they were advised to remember the [[Creed Resolute]], which discouraged religious discrimination.",
