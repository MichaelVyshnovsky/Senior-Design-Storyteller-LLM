        "mainbody": "Soubar () was a small village on the Trade Way, south of the Boareskyr Bridge and Forest of Wyrms, north of Scornubel. It was often used as a way-station for traders traveling along that road.\nThe population was highly variable, shrinking to an armed camp in the winter with the decline of caravan traffic. Soubar had no formal government, which led to a lawless culture full of brigands and ruffians.\nIn the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR, there were rumors of a barbarian horde threatening Soubar. The paladin knight Priam Agrivar planned to journey to the settlement, but was interrupted.\nAs of 1489 DR, priests of Bane were rebuilding the Black Abbey a former Baneite monastery. This had brought in much needed skilled workers, trade, and wealth. The project was unpopular with some locals, but they were advised to remember the Creed Resolute, which discouraged religious discrimination.\nThe Purple Flame operated in Soubar in 1358 DR.\nInns and taverns\n* Blue Griffon\n* Winding Way \nTemples\n* The Black Abbey"
