'''Uzurr''', also called the '''The City of Toiling Monks''', was a city in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]]. Uzurr was a member of the [[Lapal League]] and one of the [[Cities of the Seabreeze]]. It was devoted to [[Ilmater]], the Crying God.

==Geography==
It lay sprawling across three hilltops west of the [[Lapal Way]],

==History==
During the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]] ([[27 DR|27]]–[[450 DR]]), Ilmatari missionaries of the [[Order of St. Uzurr]] from [[Calimshan]] traveled to Lapaliiya and founded a walled monastery called the [[Cloister of St. Uzurr]]. In the following centuries, a city grew up around the monastery, known simply as "Uzurr".

[[Yuan-ti]] [[Yuan-ti pureblood|purebloods]] began infiltrating Uzurr on [[Eleasis 1|Eleasias 1]], the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]] with the aim of assassinating Abbot [[Kadar al Ilmater]] and stopping his research into curing [[tainted one]]s and [[broodguard]]s.<ref name=tGHotR-p153>

==Government==
The city was dominated by the Order, and ruled by the Abbot of St. Uzurr; this was [[Kadar al Ilmater]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]]. Like in other cities of Lapaliiya, Uzurr's civic deity was Ilmater Uzurr was one of the five most powerful city-states of the [[Lapal League]] and contributed a representative to its Grand Council. In practice, the Overking of Lapaliiya needed the support of Uzurr, among the other five, to have decrees passed by the Grand Council.

==Economics==
Uzurr and the Order cultivated, produced, and exported olives, [[wine]]s, and assorted [[spices]] to support themselves.
