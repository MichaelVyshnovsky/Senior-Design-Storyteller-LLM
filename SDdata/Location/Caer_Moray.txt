Caer Moray was a coastal town on the island of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
Caer Moray was located in northern Moray on the coast of the Sea of Moonshae where the Shannyth River met the sea.
A wooden palisade surrounded the town.
The town was inhabited by 1,500 loyal servants of the High King during the late 15 century DR.
The town was a frequent target of the Black Blood tribe, though these attacks seldom resulted in anything more than a few lycanthrope deaths.
