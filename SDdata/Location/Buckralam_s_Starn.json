Afterwards, the town was taken over by the Iron Fox, who took the Shrine of the Sheaf as his own \"Fox Tower\", published a code of laws, renamed the town to Foxs Starn, and claimed the land around it to be the Realm of the Fox.\nThe Iron Foxs men spread vile rumors about Tavers Talons, including that they were fiends in human form, or scouts from a bandit kingdom.\nThe town had a tavern, the Trough and Plough, and boasted a small market, known simply as the Market during the Iron Foxs rule, people were flogged in the market over minor transgressions. The local shrine to Chauntea was called the Shrine of the Sheaf.\n* Immeira\n* Rarendon\n* Taver\n* Adreim"
