'''Pyarados''' was a lawless city located in the [[Pyarados (tharch)|eastern frontier]] of [[Thay]]. It was a wild city of adventurers that served as a base of operations for those who sought to explore the rugged [[Sunrise Mountains]] and lands further east.

==Description==
The city of Pyarados was divided between an ordered, central core and a chaotic, sprawling outer expanse. The inner region had wide clean streets that housed the beautiful parks, luxurious establishments and grand palaces of the Red Wizards and wealthy merchant-class. The inner walls of Pyarados denoted the original border of the city but had since been expanded outward. Beyond the wall was a series of winding mud-covered streets that rambled between small shacks and crude temporary shelters.

*[[Weeping Slave]]: One of the lower priced drinking establishments in Pyarados that catered to drunks, poor folk, and down-on-their-luck cripples.
