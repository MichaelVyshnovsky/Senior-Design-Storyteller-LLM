Pyarados was a lawless city located in the eastern frontier of Thay. It was a wild city of adventurers that served as a base of operations for those who sought to explore the rugged Sunrise Mountains and lands further east.
The city of Pyarados was divided between an ordered, central core and a chaotic, sprawling outer expanse. The inner region had wide clean streets that housed the beautiful parks, luxurious establishments and grand palaces of the Red Wizards and wealthy merchant-class. The inner walls of Pyarados denoted the original border of the city but had since been expanded outward. Beyond the wall was a series of winding mud-covered streets that rambled between small shacks and crude temporary shelters.
