'''Hartsvale''' was a small [[human]] kingdom lying in the [[Ice Spires]] in [[north Faerûn]].

==Geography==
The realm lay in a remote valley in the Ice Spires, a range of ever-frozen peaks lying north of the [[Ice Mountains]], west of the [[High Ice]] of [[Anauroch]], and south of the [[Endless Ice Sea]]. This valley contained low rolling hills, forests of pine, and frozen plains.

==History==
The land was cleared of [[giant]]s by [[Hartkiller]] for the human inhabitants, triggering the [[War of the Hart]]. Its first king was [[Brun]].

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Hartsvale was rent by a civil war fought between twin princes over who would succeed their late father. Prince [[Camden]] allied himself with a tribe of [[Ice Spire ogre]]s, but [[Goboka]], the ogre chieftain, demanded Camden's firstborn daughter in payment. To this, Camden agreed, having no children yet and knowing his line favored males. With their aid, he won the throne.

In time, of course, King Camden had a daughter, [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]], but he reneged on the deal, declining to surrender her. In the [[1366 DR|Year of the Staff, 1366 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} when she was grown, an emissary of the ogres visited his castle to remind him of his dark deal. To keep up appearances, king and ogres arranged an ambush in which Brianna was kidnapped.), who wished to breed Brianna with a giant to give birth to a being to unite the giant kingdoms.

[[Tavis Burdun]], a [[firbolg]] [[ranger]], disobeyed orders and tracked them down, rescuing Brianna and returning her to Hartsvale. They revealed Camden's deal, and he was deposed. Brianna succeeded him as queen of Hartsvale.

The Twilight Spirit did not give up. He later sent the first [[ettin]], [[Arno and Julian]], disguised as Prince [[Arlien]], who used magic to rape Brianna. Arlien was discovered and defeated, but Brianna became pregnant with Arlien's child.

Brianna fled, protected by Tavis and a man named [[Avner]], and gave birth to her child in secret within a cave.{{Cite dragon/245/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of the Trial of Cyric the Mad|68}} and Tavis slew the Twilight Spirit, freeing Hartsvale from the giant's schemes.

Afterward, Tavis and Brianna were wed, and together, they ruled Hartsvale.

In [[1489 DR]], political tensions arose when [[Grauman]], the ruling king at the time, made preparations to pass his the throne to his son [[Taumarik]]. Many earls objected to Taumarik's marriage to a [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] from [[Silverymoon]].

==Government==
The kings of Hartsvale, members of [[House Hartwick]], were rumored to have giant blood themselves. They defended the realm against a large tribe of especially cunning and evil [[ogre]]s,

==Inhabitants==
In modern [[Faerûn]], Hartsvale was inhabited by humans and a small population of [[firbolg]]s. Giant lands and steadings surrounded the kingdom, with social taboos amongst both humans and giants preventing them from interacting with each other. 

==Language==
The Hartsvalers spoke the Hartsvaler dialect of the [[Bothii]] language, which they shared with the [[Uthgardt]],{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26, 28}} treated as a dialect of [[Illuskan language|Illuskan]].<ref name=FRCS-p168>

==Trade==
Massive [[redwood]] [[tree]]s were exported south out of Hartsvale to be used in shipbuilding. Hartsvale's redwood masts and keels could be found as far south as the city of [[Westgate]].
