Archtassel was an unwalled "tassel" (outsiders would call it a village) of Tasseldale.
Woodcutting and trapping were the usual trades in Archtassel. Brethyl fur—fox fur studded with "drops" of clear rock crystal—was produced here and sold in Sembia. The carvers here were famous for their relief-cut doors and wall panels.
