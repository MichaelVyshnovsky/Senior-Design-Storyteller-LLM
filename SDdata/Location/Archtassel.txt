'''Archtassel''' was an unwalled "tassel" (outsiders would call it a [[village]]) of [[Tasseldale]].

==Trade==
Woodcutting and trapping were the usual trades in Archtassel. [[Brethyl fur]]—[[fox]] fur studded with "drops" of clear rock crystal—was produced here and sold in [[Sembia]]. The carvers here were famous for their relief-cut doors and wall panels.
