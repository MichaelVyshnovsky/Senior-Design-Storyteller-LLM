Ichiyama was a mountain located in Kozakura.
Ichiyama was located in Oie Province on the island of Shinkoku. The colossal peak dominated the surrounding mountain range, its snow-covered summit visible even from the distant capital, Dojyu.
Regarded as a sacred mountain, Ichiyama stood as the tallest in central Shinkoku, and it held a significant place in the islands formation myths. Numerous shrines and temples graced its slopes, offering pilgrims and travelers a place of spiritual solace.
The northern side of Ichiyama sheltered a glacier and was susceptible to frequent avalanches during the winter season. Lower down its slopes, the renowned Temple of Kanchai-ryu was found, a distinguished religious center within Kozakura.
The mountain was believed to be the dwelling place of at least one tien lung, also known as a celestial dragon. Additionally, encounters with tengu and oni mage were not uncommon on its hallowed grounds.
