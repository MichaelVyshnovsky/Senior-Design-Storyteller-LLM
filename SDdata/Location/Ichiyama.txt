'''Ichiyama''' was a mountain located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Ichiyama was located in [[Oie Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. The colossal peak dominated the surrounding mountain range, its snow-covered summit visible even from the distant capital, [[Dojyu]].

Regarded as a sacred mountain, Ichiyama stood as the tallest in central Shinkoku, and it held a significant place in the island's formation myths. Numerous shrines and temples graced its slopes, offering [[pilgrim]]s and travelers a place of spiritual solace.

The northern side of Ichiyama sheltered a glacier and was susceptible to frequent avalanches during the winter season. Lower down its slopes, the renowned [[Temple of Kanchai-ryu]] was found, a distinguished religious center within Kozakura.

==Inhabitants==
The mountain was believed to be the dwelling place of at least one [[t'ien lung]], also known as a celestial dragon. Additionally, encounters with [[tengu]] and [[oni mage]] were not uncommon on its hallowed grounds.
