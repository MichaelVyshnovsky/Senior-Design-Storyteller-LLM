Evenstar Vale was a scenic valley just to the west from Alagh√¥n
Like most of the nation of Turmish, the Evenstar Vale was located in the Halondar Valley, between the Aphrunn Mountains in the south, the Orsraun Mountains in the north, and the Sea of Fallen Stars to the east.
The grass-covered hills of the Evenstar Vale overlooked the Evenstar Lake, making the beautiful locale a popular rendezvous spot for lovers who sought a romantic encounter during the Feast of the Moon, or the Festival of Lovers, a grand revelry for the inhabitants of Turmish. Because of that reputation, the shores of the lake became often stalked by the savage Cult of Malar. This looming danger arose shortly after the Time of Troubles, followed by increased Turmishian patrols in the area.
