Highcliff was a town near the Mere of Dead Men. It was the closest village to Crossroad Keep and Neverwinter and its docks were drowned by bustling labor and seagull cries.
The Weeping Willow Inn was located between West Harbor and Fort Locke.

The inhabitants of Highcliff were traders, while some of them practiced magic, enchanting items and selling them to wanderers. Also, since it was the only port in the region, much trade came from merchant boats. Before the Second War of the Shadow, many travelers sailed the boats, since the roads were much more dangerous than the sea was.
