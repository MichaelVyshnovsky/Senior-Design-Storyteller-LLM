Underhome, also known as the Great City of the Dwarves, was the capital city of the Deep Realm of the gold dwarves located within the Great Rift, from the Age of the Proud People until the year 1385 DR. It was a heavily defended fortress, home to the great treasures and wealthiest clans of the gold dwarves of Faerûn.
The city was ruined and abandoned as of the late 15 century DR, and it was rumored to contain a great deal of treasure.
This great dwarfhold consisted of three massive caverns, whose colossal, 70 (21.3 m) tall, solid-gold gates were nestled into the eastern face of the Great Rift, overlooking the Riftlake. The cavernous tunnels were lined with spired buildings similar to those that could be found on Torils surface lands. They were often interconnected with one another by means of floating bridges and accessed by many-tiered walkways and mechanical elevators. The entrance to Underhome was protected by a number of magical wards and inscribed with powerful arcane runes.
The city was ruled by the council known as the Deep Lords, nobles of the realms greatest clans. While they oversaw Underhome, they served the monarch of the Deep Kingdom. During the late 14 century DR, this was Queen Karrivva of Clan Simmerforge.
Underhome was the trading center for dwarves of the Deep Realm. The city was home to a great many businesses including moneylenders, caravan masters, cheese-makers, butchers, weapon and armorsmiths, and boar-breeders whose herds were out grazing within the Rift. The garment-makers and clothiers of Underhome set the trends for dwarven fashion across Faerûn.
On one occasion, the golden gates of Underhome withstood the assault of a great wyrm, who launched its body at them with all its might.
When the Spellplague struck Toril in 1385 DR, great rifts opened up in the Underdark beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars, which in turn caused the collapse of great swathes of land. The Underchasm formed in southern Faerûn, devastating the Great Rift, including the Deep Realm and its capital of Underhome. Many gold dwarves were able to flee the cataclysm through the elemental portals that fed the Riftlake, and others, including the Deep Lords, fled east to the devout city of Eartheart. In their absence, drow moved into the ruins, fleeing from the devastation of their homes deeper below ground. These refugee squatters claimed the city for a time before being driven out by a force from Eartheart, who then sealed it off.
The fortress of Underwatch was established near the entrance that led to the ruins of Underhome. The dwarven guardians aided surface-dwellers in their travels into the exposed areas of the Underdark, but fiercely protected their former noble city of Underhome. Nevertheless, the ruined city had come to be occupied by not only the odd drow, but by terrible beasts as well. As of the , the ruins remained largely unexplored.
