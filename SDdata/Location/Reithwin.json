        "Description": "Once a haven for worshippers of [[Selûne]], the town along with the surrounding lands was consumed by the Shadow Curse unleashed by [[Ketheric Thorm]], a former devoted Selûnite follower who eventually turned to the cult of [[the Absolute]] as leading general.",
        "Geography": "The town was located on the banks of the [[River Chionthar]] to the west of Elturel in the Shadow-cursed Lands. This town could be traveled to from a mountain pass known as the [[Risen Road]] or through the [[Underdark]] (via a [[Shattered Sanctum|temple of Selûne]]). A toll was required for passage through the town. The [[Thorm Mausoleum|Grand Mausoleum]] was constructed to serve as the final resting place of the [[Thorm]] family.",
        "History": "[[File:Reithwin coat of arms.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Reithwin's coat-of-arms.'']]\nReithwin was founded by the followers of [[Selûne]].\n\nAccording to the [[Infernal Mason]] from the [[House of Hope (demiplane)|House of Hope]], Reithwin and the Moonrise Towers used to be a happy home to his then master Ketheric Thorm until a tragedy happened and his wife [[Melodia Thorm|Melodia]] passed away.\n\n''Circa'' the {{Yearlink|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} Ketheric had turned to the goddess of [[Shar]] to cope with the loss of his daughter [[Isobel Thorm|Isobel]]. Forming a Sharran army of [[Dark Justiciars]] from the [[Underdark]], the town of Reithwin became a battlefield between Ketheric's followers and opposing forces of Shar. As Ketheric was beginning to lose the war against the anti-Sharran forces he unleashed the Shadow Curse out of desperation, turning the whole town into a darkened wasteland.\n\nIn the year [[1492 DR]], a century after the Shadow Curse devoured the town, the curse was still lingering, and anyone daring to pass through would require carrying a [[Kar'niss|moonlantern]] or being Sharran-blessed to survive.\n\nIf the shadow curse were to be lifted by the Absolute Adversaries, people from the [[Cionthar Valley]] and Baldur's Gate were ready to resettle the ruined town mere six months after the end of the [[Absolute crisis]].",
