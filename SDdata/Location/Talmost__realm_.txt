'''Talmost''' was a small [[human]] realm in [[northwest Faer√ªn]], created from the destruction of the kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]] in [[697 DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5,6}}

==Geography==
Talmost lay between the southern [[Dessarin Valley]] and [[Delimbiyr Vale]] on the northeast edge of the [[Ardeep Forest]], in the former territory of Delimbiyran.

==History==
Talmost was originally a territory of the kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]]. Succeeding [[Phalorm]] in [[616 DR]], Delimbiyran overtook many of the lands formerly held by the [[dwarf|dwarven]] and [[elf|elven]] realms of [[Dardath]] and [[Ardeep]].{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|7}}

In the {{YearlinkName|697}}, the [[Sharran]] high priestess [[Lalondra Worul]] became a [[lich]], in the process killing her faithful [[True Servants of Shar]] who controlled an extensive network of Sharran temples across the [[Sword Coast]]. Completely uncontrolled, the leaderless faithful of her church caused mayhem and destruction across the region, and threatened numerous cities and realms. When King [[Davyd Snowsword]] of Delimbiyran deployed his soldiers in force to counter the violence, he was assassinated by a Sharran fanatic turned martyr. Dying without an heir, King Davyd's realm fell into civil war and broke apart into the small, independent realms of Talmost, [[Calandor]], [[Scathril]], [[Harpshield]], [[Loravatha]], [[Dauntylgar]], [[Secomber]], and more lost to history. The Talmosts continued to rule their territory as independent royalty.

Shortly after in the {{YearlinkName|702}}, an [[orc]]ish force from the [[High Forest]] invaded and destroyed several of the weakened and disunited claimants. The Duke of Calandor managed to form an alliance with his rivals, and together they threw back the invasion. Though the surviving realms remained independent, their wars largely ended thanks to this instance of cooperation.

In the {{YearlinkName|942}}, [[drow]] raiders struck hard along the [[Sword Coast]], with Talmost and Harpshield pillaged and the people enslaved. The Talmost Lands were ravaged, and the royal family fled and resettled in [[Nimoar's Hold]], though they maintained their ownership of the ancestral lands. They became officially ennobled in Waterdeep the same year and became one of the leading families of the city.

By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the other realms of Delimbiyran had largely fallen to ruin, with only [[Daggerford]] and [[Secomber]] remaining prominent. Talmost Keep lay in ruins, though the Talmosts maintained hunting lodges and employed crofters to herd sheep and cattle in the Talmost Lands.
