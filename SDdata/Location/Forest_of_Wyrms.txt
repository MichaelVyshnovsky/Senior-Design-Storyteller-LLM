The '''Forest of Wyrms''', known as '''Ss'kowlyn'raa''' by the [[yuan-ti]], was a dark and dangerous forest found in the [[Western Heartlands]].

{{Quote|...though Ghosun advised me against doing so. Ultimately, I chose it for the same reason he tried to discourage me: because only a fool would enter this wood intentionally.|Excerpt from the ''[[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide (in-universe)|Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]''.}}

==Description==
The air in the forest was cool and damp, and mists covered some areas of the ground. 

==Geography==
The Forest of Wyrms was located between the [[Serpent Hills]] and the [[Trielta Hills]], just south of the [[Winding Water]] river.

===Flora & Fauna===
It contained many [[pine]]s and tall [[redwood]] trees, some with trunks more than {{SI|20|ft}} in diameter. There was not much vegetation on the forest floor and the terrain was mostly smooth. [[Helmthorn]] brush grew dense in the forest.

Befitting its name, the forest was home to great many species of [[poison]]ous and constrictor [[snake]]s.

==History==
The forest was once part of the elven realm of [[Shantel Othreier]].

''Circa'' the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. adventurers and [[Harpers]] sometimes journeyed into the forest to battle the [[lich]] at [[Lyran's Hold]].

==Rumors & Legends==
An ancient [[sarrukh]] city within the forest once held an [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Naja Fountain]]''.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Lyran's Hold]] was a warded tower created by the wizard [[Lyran]].
* [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]], one of the most ancient set of ruins in all the Realms.
* [[Thlohtzin]], the former fortress of a [[lich]] that was then taken over by yuan-ti.
* The lair of [[Tharas'kalagram]], a [[red dragon]] that lived in a small volcano.

==Inhabitants==
The forest's name was derived from the population of [[green dragon]]s who inhabited the eastern side of the forest. They tended not to stray too close to the western side because of the proximity of [[Soubar]] and the likelihood of encountering adventurers nearby, but some younger or bolder dragons were found in this area. Dragon slayers ventured into the forest to hunt these great beasts,

Other creatures are also known to lair within the forest, including [[giant rhinoceros beetle]]<nowiki/>s, [[hill giant]]s, [[sword spider]]s, [[stirge]]s, [[behir]]s, [[hydra]]s, and [[wyvern]]s.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Agyrtclughwaur]], the [[green dragon|green]] [[wyrm]].
* [[Rylatar'ralah'tyma]], the mature female [[red dragon]].
* [[Morentherene]], the green dragon half-sister of the [[half-dragon]] [[Ziatar]].
* [[Terpenzi]], a great [[dark naga]] that led a population of [[ophidian]]s in the forest ''circa'' the fall of [[Netheril]].
* [[Ralionate]], an ancient green dragon apparently not aligned with the yuan-ti, made this forest her lair.
