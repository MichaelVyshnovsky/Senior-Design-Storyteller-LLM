'''Bejung''' was a settlement in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]] around [[1357 DR]]. It lay on the western side of [[Kang Bay]].

==History==
In ancient times, the area held a city later called Old Bejung. However, with the eruption of the nearby [[Kanko]] volcano, it was engulfed in poisonous gas that killed all the people, before the city itself was obliterated in a matter of seconds and buried in ash. Over time, the site of the city was lost.

However, by [[1357 DR]], the location of Old Bejung had been found again. A barbarian called [[Yuf Bawrax]] discovered an entrance into the ruins of the city; he declined to step foot inside, but would show it to others.

==Notable Locations==
;Farmlands: North of Bejung were farmlands. The wealthy merchant [[Merquam Pang]] owned a well-guarded estate here.
;The Sharpening House: A tavern in Bejung that was often frequented by Yuf Bawrax.

==Rumors==
Since Old Bejung had been destroyed and buried so swiftly, many speculated that its treasures had survived and were plentiful, but it was an enormous burial mound to search through.
