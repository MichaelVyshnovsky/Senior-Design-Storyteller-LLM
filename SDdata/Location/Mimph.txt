'''Mimph''' was a coastal city of [[Sespech]]. It could only be reached by sea or overland travel as no road led to this city. Despite this limitation, it still saw a fair amount of overland trade.

{{quote|''I see the scales, jaws, and claws that shout "monster" to most, aye, but I see more than that. I see that from among the ranks of men, who lack such trimmings, come the worst monsters.''|[[Dazratha Alaemalarr]], Sage of Mimph, ''[[Lady in Chains, or I Say What I See]]''}}

==Description==
Mimph was a busy port city with its harbor chuck-full of ships nestled so close to each other, their masts looked like a thick leaf-less winter wood. Most buildings in Mimph were made out hand-raved of pale gray [[granite]] and were shaped like sharp-angled small, simple squares. All doors and windows were square as well, and sharp-looking flights of stairs veered around the hilly city, leading up the town's piers.

The streets of Mimph were often filled with town criers and over-eager advertisers, usually young humans, who tried their best to out-scream their peers and lead guests of the city to inns and taverns who paid for the criers' services. Street vendors were equally aggressive in selling their goods. Women were known to sell sweet, and hot mulled [[wine]] by a [[tankard]] for six [[copper]]s per serving. And the city's doxies were a common sight in the neighborhoods near the docks.

==Government==
The city's rulership was in the hands of the Overlord. The title belonged to Admiral [[Kalisa Tauno]] as of [[1372 DR]]. Unlike many other rulers of Sespech, Kalisa was not one of Baron [[Aldorn Thuragar]]'s – the leader of Sespech's, past adventuring companions. Before that, High Priest [[Marasa Ferrentio]] of [[Helm]] and the spiritual guide for Baron Thuragar was the city's Overlord, before retiring to focus on the work of the [[Church of Helm]].

Baron Aldorn Thuragar was a regular and often unexpected visitor in Mimph. The other cities of Sespech received Baron frequently as well. Mimph visits for the ruler of the nation often included attending service at the local Temple of Helm. 

==Trade==
Mimph and its closest naval neighbor – [[Arrabar]], shared certain animosity towards each other. Many merchants conducted business in only one of the two cities at the time not to provoke the other. It was common for the Arrabarran vessels to board ships heading to Mimph and claiming their cargo.

Despite lacking land trade routes, Mimph received merchants who disliked doing business with [[Chondath]]. These caravans left the [[Old Road (Vilhon Reach)|Old Road]] after reaching [[Ormpetarr]] and traveled through roadless territory or took boats across the [[Nagawater]].

==Defenses==
In the late 14{{th}} center [[DR]], Baron Aldorn Thuragar ordered a navy built based out of Mimph, creating its sizable naval defenses to battle piracy by the Arrabarran fleet. 

Land defenses of Mimph often included mercenary adventuring companies who were contracted to serve as the city's guards. Mimph hired private naval vessels as well. The ships escorted rich merchant vessels.

Mimph, like other cities of Sespech, was a part of a well-connected pay network. Spies from Arrabar and other major cities in the area traveled to Mimph to deposit collected covert intel on military activities, news, and trade deals information. Mimph's messengers collected the intel and forwarded it to the cities of [[Fort Arran]] or [[Ormpetarr]].

==History==
The city of Mimph was established in the {{YearlinkName|132}} to the west from the capital of Chondath – Arrabar. For several years, the shiny new city was overshadowing Arrabar, attracting inhabitants and trade away, threatening to leave its neighbor a short town. The aggressive growth was thwarted by Arrabarran armies in the {{YearlinkName|135}} that razed Mimph.

As years passed and the [[Chondathian Empire]] established the [[Barony of Sespech]], the city of Mimph quietly sprouted back to life. Soon, Sespechians grew dissatisfied with the Chondathian rule, and Mimph, along with the other Barony cities, failed several tempts to gain independence. The separation was completed in the {{YearlinkName|902}}, as the [[Rotting War]] decimated the Chondathian Empire.

By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Lord [[Eles Wianar]] of Chondath was plotting to invade Sespech via a land attack on the city of [[Elbulder]] and simultaneously – a naval strike on [[Mimph]]. Previous attacks on the cities were nothing but probes and reconnaissance. Wianar believed that this strategy would saw confusion among the cities of Sespech.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161101074749/http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=fr/fx20020508rt| title = Rand's Travelogue: More of the Vilhon Reach!| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}
