The Naga Crawls were a series of caverns in the Deep Wastes noted as the lair of a trio of spirit naga.  
The Naga Crawls were located 52.5 miles (84.4 km) east of Szith Morcane at the end of a branch of tunnels through the Deep Wastes.
A roughly 150-ft-deep (45.7 m) set of caverns, the ceiling of the Naga Crawls was about 8 ft (2.4 m) in height at the entrance and only 4 ft (1.2 m) high further in. Cold streams of water wound their way through the Crawls, trickling into shallow pools at the deepest parts of the cavern. A single rusted iron ladder provided the only means of entrance from the tunnels of the Deep Wastes to the narrow caverns above, the stream pouring down the ladder in a cold waterfall.
At some point before 1372 DR, a trio of spirit naga made these caverns their home. They lured many creatures to their deaths here, earning the cavern its moniker. During the Silence of Lolth, they managed to coax a stone giant deep into their lair, where they could feast on its trapped corpse.
