Druids Grove was a large clearing filled with standing stones in a rough circle located to the northwest just outside of the village limits of Shadowdale.
Oak trees surrounded the area around the Grove. Mistletoe grew quite heavily around the Grove.
Several druids stayed in the area and tended the Grove, though they kept themselves apart from the rest of the Shadowdale community. A more formal group of druids, known as the Circle, once tended the Grove. Shortly after 1358 DR the Circle moved on and left the Grove.
Druids Grove had been a meeting place and a place of worship for druids for centuries before the 1300s DR.
