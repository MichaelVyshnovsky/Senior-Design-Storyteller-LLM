'''Druid's Grove''' was a large clearing filled with standing stones in a rough circle located to the northwest just outside of the village limits of [[Shadowdale]].

==Flora==
Oak trees surrounded the area around the Grove. [[Mistletoe]] grew quite heavily around the Grove.

==Inhabitants==
Several druids stayed in the area and tended the Grove, though they kept themselves apart from the rest of the Shadowdale community. A more formal group of druids, known as [[the Circle]], once tended the Grove. Shortly after [[1358 DR]] the Circle moved on and left the Grove.

==History==
Druid's Grove had been a meeting place and a place of worship for druids for centuries before the 1300s DR.
