        "mainbody": "Sapra was the only port city on the isle of Ilighôn of the Eyes of Silvanus, in the Sea of Fallen Stars, off the shores of the Vilhon Reach.\nSapra was the only port on the entire island. The city was calm, quiet, and possibly, the cleanest settlement in all of Faerûn.\nThe city welcomed those who wanted to flee oppression by wizards. Sapra aided refugees from the lands ruled by spell-casting tyrants, and its inhabitants even included several \"retired\" Red Wizards who fled Thay. The islands magics shielded the ex-wizards from Thayan divinations.\nthumb|The location of Sapra off the shores of the 320x320px\nSapra stood on a small bay on the southeast of Ilighôn, directly in front of the cape passage gap in the reefs of Eldaths Ring that encircled the island. The Great Forest and Mielikkis Garden surrounded the city on land, while its harbors were awash with waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars through the Strait of Silvanus and the Farshore Straits. The Hierophant trail led from the city of Sapra towards the Oakenhall, or the House of Silvanus at the heart of the island.\nThe city of Sapra was ruled and guarded by the druids of the Emerald Enclave who venerated both Silvanus and Eldath. Not a single unwanted nor unwelcome visitor was allowed to enter the harbors of Sapra under the druids watchful eye. Direct rulership of Sapra was in the hands of a council of six elders whose position on the council was a part-time job. The council met as the need arose, usually once a month. In the late-14 century DR, the leader of the council was the local blacksmith, Mayor Thomas Flagcairn.\nThe city of Sapra was mandated by the Emerald Enclave to control its size and population. In the late-14 century, Sapras population was at 2,000 souls, pushing the Emerald Enclaves limits. Due to the number and growing size, the towns lodging and housing prices were on the rise as well. However, by the later parts of the 1370s DR, Sapras population expanded dramatically to over 3,000 souls.\nSapras export was humble and consisted mainly of foodstuff and various herbs, all produced by the islands lush forests. The slow trade only had a handful of merchant ships docking in Sapra every month. Because of that, most things not produced locally were valued highly. Locals spent a lot of time negotiating trades and bartering.\nthumb|An resident of Sapra overlooking the city.|alt=|left\nSapras harbors and waters surrounding the isle of Ilighôn were defended by the Seven Sentinels of Silvanus, a group of water and air elementals who pummeled unwanted visitors and washed ashore allies whose vessels suffered damage or drowning innocents. The Seven Sentinels also guided friendly ships across the perilous reefs of Eldaths Ring towards Sapra. Additionally, Sapra, just like the entirety of Ilighôn, was shrouded in the faith-magic zone, a gift from Mystra, goddess of magic, to Silvanus. While on the island, all arcane magic was negated, permanent and long-lasting spells fizzled out, and wizardly magic items stopped functioning.\nBy the , Sapra had been peacefully existing under the control, protection, and policies of the Emerald Enclave for over 200 years. until Sapra was finally allowed to expand by the .\nEverything changed with the advent of the Spellplague that reshaped the Vilhon Reach and drained the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Eyes of Silvanus were no longer islands, instead becoming the new edge of Turmish and later its only port city. In the 100 years that followed, the citys population exploded to more than double its size&mdash8,500 souls included the locals, druids, and Turamis.\n* City Hall, the place for the councils gathering, center of the citys bureaucracy, and archives.\n* The Dazzling Dolphin, an expensive and clean inn that charged ten times the average for lodgings.\n* The Temple of Tempus, a large temple dedicated to the Lord of Battles.\n* The Shrine to Eldath, one of the few small places of worship in the city."
