        "mainbody": "othaerin was one of the eight subkingdoms of the dwarven realm of Shanatar.\nThe former kingdom was found underneath the surface realm of Amn. It lay inside of two massive caverns connected by a network of tunnels, with the northern half of the kingdom under the Cloud Peaks and the southern half below the Small Teeth Mountains. The southern parts were located under the volcanoes Kossuths Eyes and were filled with lava tubes and veins of magma, deep within which a gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire existed.\nThe ruling shield dwarves belonged to Clan Azerkyn, which had some azer blood. The other major clans of the kingdom were Clan Arjotun and Clan Blackbanner. The realm was famous for being the home of some of the greatest giant slayers in history. The northern part of Xothaerin was also famous for its scholars, who were considered to be some of the greatest minds in Shanatar. Due to their affinity of fire and heat, Clan Azerkyn lived in the southern part of the kingdom.\nAs of , the northern part of the ruined kingdom was home to several tribes of fomorians while the southern caverns were home to an aggresive tribe of tlincalli from Maztica. The tlincalli tribe founded a realm called Oaxaptupa within the caverns and tunnels of southern Xothaerin. Also found throughout the vast network of caves and tunnels were small communities of giants and trolls. Fire elementals and salamanders were known to inhabit the southern area and there were reports that an efreeti made its home there as well.\nThe pyromancers of Clan Azerkyn crafted fine magical armor and weapons.\nAfter the fall of Shanatar, it was rumoured that the dwarves of Clan Azerkyn emigrated to the Elemental Plane of Fire.\nThe dwarves of Xothaerin worshiped Sharindlar as its patron deity."
