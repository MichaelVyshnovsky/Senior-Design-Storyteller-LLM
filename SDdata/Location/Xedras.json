        "mainbody": "'''Xedras''' was the capital of the [[Xedran Reefs]], an [[ixitxachitl]] nation beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], and the holiest of its Six Holy Cities.",
        "Geography": "Xedras was located in the western shallows of [[Ser么s]], {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}} beneath the waves of the Inner Sea and approximately {{SI|40|miles|long=yes}} southeast of the coastal surface city of [[Telpir]].",
        "Description": "The city was hidden beneath the ruins of another, a forgotten city of the [[Aryselmalyr Empire]] that was identifiable by only a lone tower made of coral and piles of rubble. Unlike other cities of the Xedran Reefs, which were built as spread-out warrens of tunnels and subcaverns, over two-thirds of Xedras was housed in one huge central cavern that measured {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} tall. Like other 'chitl cities, it had a central entrance, exiting at the tower, that was purposely designed to be noticeable so that invaders could be lured into its trap-riddled passages. There was a distance of roughly {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} between the cavern's ceiling and this surface entrance. The site also had seven hidden entrances scattered about the surface ruins.\n\nMuch of the city within the cavern consisted of the repurposed ruins of a [[kuo-toa]]n city, which fell long before the ixitxachitls settled there, while other parts were constructed from pieces of [[masonry]] and stonework taken from the Aryselmalyr ruins above. A central temple dedicated to the kuo-toan god [[Blibdoolpoolp]] once stood in the cavern, but the ixitxachitls tore it down along with an immense statue of the goddess, breaking it into pieces that they used to build slave huts on the city's outskirts.\n\nLike other cities of the Xedran Reefs, Xedras had a great central temple dedicated to their patron god, [[Ilxendren]], around from which the rest of the city grew outward, with the city spanning a {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} radius out from this central temple, though unlike those other cities it also had two minor temples. Other characteristics common to Xedran cities included an outbuilding near the central temple where the ruler's personal slaves were held, two military garrisons for the military, and at least four public shrines to Ilxendren on the city's outskirts.",
        "Government": "Xedras had a theocratic government, centered around the patron god of the ixitxachitls, Ilxendren. It was the seat of power for the Vitanar, a title given to the head ruler of the Xedran Reefs. The Vitanar was considered by his subjects to be a manifestation of Ilxendren and because of this perceived divinity his laws and commands were never questioned by the populace.",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to ixitxachitl, the city of Xedras was home to a large population of enslaved [[koalinth]]s, [[locathah]]s, and [[merrow (ogre)|merrow]].",
        "History": "Following the [[Twelfth Ser么s War]], Xedras kept the neighboring city of [[Thuridru]] in check, preventing its outcast [[merfolk]] and vengeful ruler [[Sharna]] from causing problems for wider Ser么s. retaking the 'chitl land that was stolen by the [[Kataar]] clan of merfolk."
