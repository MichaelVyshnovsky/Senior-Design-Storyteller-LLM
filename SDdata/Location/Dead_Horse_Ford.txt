'''Dead Horse Ford''' was a crossing on the [[Dessarin River]] south of [[Calling Horns]]. The ford was a part of [[Jundar's Pass]], the trail from [[Beliard]] to Calling Horns. Dead Horse Path ran from the ford to [[Noanar's Hold]] along the banks of the Dessarin.

It drew its name from the battle fought here where the hero Destril Longtracker had three [[horse]]s slain from underneath him.
