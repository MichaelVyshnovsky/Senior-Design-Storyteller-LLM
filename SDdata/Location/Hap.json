It was minor, peaceful settlement inhabited in large part by woodcutters and herb-growers. Despite its serene nature, it did attract many adventurers looking to explore the ruins and tunnel system under Haptooth Hill.\nThe defense and leadership of Hap was left to War Watcher Elphron Pharlyn, a veteran officer of the Lords Men, appointed by Lord Ilmeth. He had the resources of the Lords Men or forces of the Abbey of the Sword at his disposal if requested.\nHap was once controlled by Dracandros and his drow minions until he was overthrown by adventurers.\n*Tower of Dracandros The keep formerly inhabited by Dracandros and his allies rested on the top of Haptooth Hill.\n*The Millery Inn A small rooming house that served adequate lodgings and food to those who stayed, and some who lived, in Hap.\n*Delmuths Barrel This large, and extremely well-stocked, general store was run by a retired, dwarven warrior.\n*Glarths Anvil The smithy of Hap provided rough, but sturdy weapons, armor and other goods made of iron.\n*Haestars Woodworks Haestar and his assistants were among the quickest in the dales to provide semi-finished woodwork.\n*Lathanders Open Hand a small, but bustling, stone chapel dedicated to the Morninglord.\n*Temple of Sune a small temple dedicated to the goddess of love."
