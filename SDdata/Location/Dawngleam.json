        "mainbody": "'''Dawngleam''' was a fishing [[village]] in southeastern [[Cormyr]].<ref name=VGC-p83><ref name=BC-p45>{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}}",
        "Geography": "Dawngleam was situated on the shore of the [[Neck]], the strait between [[Dragonmere]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Just to the northwest was the village of [[Wormtower]], and to the east was the mouth of the [[Darkflow River]], which marked the border of Cormyr and [[Sembia]]. Dawngleam lay on the [[Bluemist Trail]], which ran along the coast from [[Marsember]] in the west.<ref name=BC-p45/>",
        "History": "In [[389 DR]], ''[[Valashar's Bane]]'', the flagship of the Cormyrean Crown Prince [[Azoun I]], went down during a storm in the Neck. No lives were lost, and the crew was able to reach land in smaller boats from the ship. Happy that all hands were safe, the prince declared that it was \"the best gleaming dawn seen in Cormyr yet\". When the village was founded on the site nearly a thousand years later, it was named Dawngleam in honor of Azoun.<ref name=SFS-p19>\n\n[[Volo]], the well-known traveler and guidebook author, claimed that inspiration for the name also came from a song by the Cormyrean minstrel [[Darbrukk Syndylver]]. The song, titled ''[[The Sun Comes Up Again]]'', used \"dawngleam\" as a poetic term for the sunrise.<ref name=VGC-p83/>\n\nBefore the expansion of Dawngleam's docks began in the 1360s [[DR]], the village nearshore consisted of a group of tiny islands joined to the shore and each other by bridges. These islands were popular places for picnics, trysts, and clandestine meetings. They later became anchoring points for the new docks.<ref name=VGC-pp84-85>\n\nThe islands were actually surviving fragments of an ancient citadel of [[mage]]s founded by an [[elf]] mage. This group of elves, [[half-elves]], and [[human]]s were known as the [[Soond]], and their citadel was known as the [[Soond Sharr]]. The goal of the Soond was to discourage the presence of humans in what would become Cormyr, in order to preserve the pristine state of the forests and to maintain those forests as hunting grounds for the elves. That dream became a fiery nightmare when a [[dragon]] destroyed the castle and stole its wealth and [[magic]].<ref name=VGC-p85>\n\nNot all the magic was lost, however. Among the dormant enchantments was the ability to cause a ghostly bridge to appear on any of the islands when the words \"mother bridge\" were spoken on certain spots. The bridge led to the next island or to the shore, and once a particular bridge was brought into being, it could not be invoked again until after the next [[Selûne (moon)|new moon]]. This power was used by [[pirate]]s and smugglers to evade their enemies, and it was said to have inspired [[Alustriel Silverhand]] to create the [[Moonbridge]] of [[Silverymoon]].<ref name=VGC-p85/>",
        "Defenses": "Dawngleam's significance as a port was minimal until the 1360s [[DR]], when the Cormyrean navy established a base there to guard against pirates operating through the Neck. Among other defensive measures were the renovation of the docks and the construction of dockside [[ballista]] towers. This military presence meant that [[merchant]]s felt secure enough to conduct honest business there, resulting in the rapid growth of the village. Around this time, Dawngleam repelled its first pirate raid. This, along with the expansion of the village, made the construction of defensive walls a probable development for the future.<ref name=VGC-pp83-84>\n\nThe [[War Wizards]] took an active role in the defense of the growing community. In the late 1360s [[DR]], they uncovered and killed an [[adventuring company]] hired by [[Westgate]] interests to [[poison]] the village wells and sabotage work being done on the docks.<ref name=VGC-p84>",
        "Trade": "By the 1360s [[DR]], Dawngleam adopted a new [[fish]]-packing process developed in [[Chessenta]]. This involved preserving fresh fish in seasoned [[oil]]s rather than [[salt]], and storing them in [[clay]] shells that were guarded against breakage by wooden racks and crates. This prevented spoilage as the fish were shipped and sold throughout [[Faerûn]].<ref name=VGC-p84/>\n\nAround the same time, Dawngleam launched a joint venture with [[merfolk]] to set up protected [[clam]] beds. The project involved a shallow cove which was caged to protect the clam beds against [[lizardfolk]] and predatory sea creatures.<ref name=VGC-p84/>\n\nOther projects included the construction of new shipbuilding facilities, while village land was being purchased by Cormyrean and Sembian investors.<ref name=VGC-p84/>",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Argyr's Realmsry": ":This warehouse-sized general supply shop was owned by [[Austas Argyr]], who sold a wide variety of items including food and drink, clothing, furniture, tools, hardware, and adventuring gear. As a result of Dawngleam's rapid growth, Argyr feared potential competition from the businesswoman [[Aurora]], whom he suspected of having spies in the village. Thus, he always went out of his way to be extremely helpful to his customers. This included placing special orders from [[Suzail]] and Marsember.<ref name=VGC-p86>",
            "The Maiden Danced at Dawn": ":This [[tavern]] served food including sausages, hot bread, biscuits, and nut cakes, as well as a selection of [[beer]] and [[wine]] that varied in quality. They also served a dark red house [[brandy]] called [[Maiden's Kiss]], which was popular among the locals.<ref name=VGC-p86/>",
            "The Moondown Mooring": ":By the late 1360s [[DR]], this otherwise pleasant [[inn]] with good, hot food had prepared for Dawngleam's future prosperity by significantly raising its prices and building a new wing. Unfortunately, this new addition to the inn was located where the stables once were, as evidenced by the lingering smell.<ref name=VGC-p86/>"
