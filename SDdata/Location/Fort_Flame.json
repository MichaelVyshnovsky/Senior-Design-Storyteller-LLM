        "mainbody": "'''Fort Flame''' was a small fort and colony on the [[Bay of Balduran]] in southeastern [[Anchorome]]. It was inhabited and run by a detachment of the [[Flaming Fist]].",
        "Geography": "The fort was located at the mouth of a river that flowed into the large Bay of Balduran.",
        "Government": "The settlement was led by [[Bellan]], one of the few surviving leaders of the original expedition.",
        "Defenses": "The fort was constantly attacked by [[wild elf|wild elves]]. Bellan's intentions included acquiring some [[alchemist's fire]] in order to burn down a portion of the jungle for agricultural purposes and to create a buffer zone against the elven attacks.",
        "History": "The settlement was established in the {{YearlinkName|1364}} by the survivors of a Flaming Fist expedition commissioned by [[Eltan]] whose objective was to explore Anchorome and to find the fate of [[Balduran]]'s last voyage. After the discovery of a ruined fort where the likely remains of Balduran's expedition were found, the Flaming Fist were attacked by wild elves and sea monsters similar to [[whale]]s, which destroyed all the expedition's ships. Roughly 100 members managed to escape the elves' attack alive, and founded Fort Flame south of their territory.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, reinforcements were sent to Fort Flame, increasing its population to about 300 people, including newly arrived [[elves]] whose objective was to attempt to establish communication with the local elves. Those attempts, however, were unsuccessful, as the [[Faer√ªn]]ian elves and the locals did not share a common language and the locals did not display any interest in communication.",
        "Inhabitants": "Besides its leader Bellan, notable inhabitants of Fort Flame by 1366 DR included [[Oalan]], a member of the [[Eagle Knights]]; the [[half-elf]] [[Morella]]; and the [[halfling]] [[Wuxxul Silvertongue]], who referred to the settlement as a \"[[mosquito]]-infested torture-land\"."
