After the discovery of a ruined fort where the likely remains of Baldurans expedition were found, the Flaming Fist were attacked by wild elves and sea monsters similar to whales, which destroyed all the expeditions ships. Roughly 100 members managed to escape the elves attack alive, and founded Fort Flame south of their territory.\nIn the , reinforcements were sent to Fort Flame, increasing its population to about 300 people, including newly arrived elves whose objective was to attempt to establish communication with the local elves.
