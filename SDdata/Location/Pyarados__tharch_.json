        "mainbody": "'''Pyarados''' was a small but vital tharch, located in the eastern region of [[Thay]], just west of the [[River Thazarim]]. Despite its size, it was important to the nation as it controlled access to the valuable minerals found within the eastward [[Sunrise Mountains]]. The lands east of the Thazarim held vast slave plantations and many estates of the nation's [[Red Wizards]].",
        "Armed Forces": "The tharch was renowned for its famed [[Griffon Legion]], warriors and [[warmage]]s that soared the skies over Thay atop their aerial [[griffon]] mounts.",
        "Economy": "Heavy taxes were imposed on mining businesses that sought to mine the depths of the Sunrise Mountains. Even the most basic of survival equipment were sold at exorbitant rates within Pyarados' towns and settlements.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Kepetur]], one of the last remaining prayer towers of [[Mulhorand]], one that was infested with [[demon]]s as of the early [[Era of Upheaval]].\n* [[Pyarados]], the capital of the tharch was an eclectic, wild city of both immense wealth and outright destitution. It served as a gateway to the untamed wilderness due further east.",
        "Geographical Features": "* [[Serague Escarpment]]: The eastern border of Pyarados included a small portion of the sheer cliff face that further elevated the Sunrise Mountains above the [[Thayan Plateau]]."
