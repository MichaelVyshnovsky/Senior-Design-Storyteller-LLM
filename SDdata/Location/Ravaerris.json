        "mainbody": "Ravaerris was a Zhentarim stronghold and outpost constructed on the edge of Anauroch. By the late 15 century DR, it was a buried and long-abandoned ruin said to contain many unclaimed magical treasures.\nRavaerris was a large fort established as a staging point for Zhentarim prospectors tasked with discovering and excavating treasures of ancient Netheril. It was notable for its many special vaults designed to house the artifacts they unearthed. Following the events of the Spellplague, the entire fort was swallowed by the ground, but it was rumored to have remained intact.\nThe stronghold was located on the eastern edge of Anauroch, west of the Border Forest. By the , the forest had seemingly expanded to include the buried forts former location.\nThe fort was established in the 14 century DR sometime before the Return of Netheril. As of the time of its destruction, Ravaerris was the largest of the Zhentarims outposts along the edge of Anauroch. Despite many challenges and hardships, the Zhents stationed there managed to accrue an impressive trove of ancient Netherese treasures procured from the dangerous desert, potentially including relics, spells, captive creatures, and magic potent enough to slay the Princes of Shade.\nRavaerris remained under Zhentarim control until the events of the Spellplague in the , during which some unknown artifact or magic housed within the vaults began to emit waves of force that caused a hidden fault to appear beneath the fort. This fault swallowed Ravaerris whole and then sealed itself shut, burying the fort below ground. The few Zhentarim survivors were convinced that the fort had endured this ordeal, and for the next century, members of the faction maintained the belief that Ravaerriss treasures remained waiting to be reclaimed.\nPrior to the Spellplague, the fort housed a whole company of Zhentarim prospectors seeking Netherese relics, aided by diggers, diviners, and soldiers."
