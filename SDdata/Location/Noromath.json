        "mainbody": "oromath was a duchy in name only, being the western half of the  elven territory of the great Wealdath forest of Tethyr.\nThe name \"Noromath\" is Elvish for \"Legacy of the North\". It was called such by the Elmanesse elves of the forest.\nNoromaths official borders were east of County Greenshores, south of Amn, west of Durmista, and north of County Uluran however, the elves cared little for such human distinctions.\nNoromath was the original home of the Elmanesse tribe of elves, Green elves from the Suldusk also occupied the region, since the tribes were unified. The major population of the western half of the forest, however, was composed of goblins, hobgoblins, centaurs, and satyrs.\nA small population of humans lived in the town of Brost on the outskirts of the forest to the north.\nIn 1370 DR, Allain \"Foxfire\" Kevanarial was the official representative of the Elmanesse tribes to the Tethyrian court. While officially a duke, he did not consider himself a duke at all, and he refused to declare any place his ducal seat."
