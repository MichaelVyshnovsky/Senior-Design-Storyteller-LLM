        "mainbody": "'''Old Phlan''', referred to the largest portion of [[Phlan]] that was occupied by monstrous creatures and lay in ruin throughout much of the city's history of destruction and rebuilding. It stood in stark contrast to [[Phlan/Civilized Phlan|Civilized Phlan]], the last remnant of humanity within the city's walls throughout the middle of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], before Phlan was rebuilt whole once again, proud amongst the [[Moonsea]] powers.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|50}}",
        "Description": "For much of its history, the sealed chambers of Old Phlan often contained wondrous treasure and deadly monsters. When the city was still in ruin, builders often refused to work in these areas due to the risk to their safety.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|47}}",
        "Geography": "Old Phlan comprised nearly all of Phlan at one point, including part of the city's [[Phlan/Slums District|slums]] and all of the city blocks north, all the way to [[Valjevo Castle]], along with the entirety of [[Nobles' Quarter|Mansion District]] on the opposite side of the [[Stojanow River]].\n\nAfter reconstruction throughout the 15{{th}} century, Old Phlan became incorporated into the broader Old City, alongside the area previously referred to as Civilized Phlan.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|14}} The Old City was the portion of Phlan that remained fortified within its city walls,{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|12}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, Phlan was assailed by the [[dragon]]s of [[Thar]] in a conflict that came to be known as the [[Dragon Run]]. The city was left in ruin and many of its citizens were slain outright. Its ruined streets became overrun by [[goblin]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[orc]]s, and other monstrous creatures. Within the next few decades the ruins of what came to be known as Old Phlan were claimed by [[Tyranthraxus]] the Possessing Spirit, inhabiting the body of a [[bronze dragon]] and claimed the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' beneath [[Valjevo Castle]].\n\nOver time, the [[Council of Ten]] and leading community members holed up in the area of the city near the docks known as Civilized Phlan, orchestrating the means by which they could reclaim their city.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|12}} [[Adventurer]]s, looters, thieves and other opportunistic individuals were attracted to the chaos of the city, some with ill intent, and others that sought to help make things better.\n\nThe city was given true hope for renewal when one intrepid [[Heroes of Phlan|band of heroes]] ventured into the ruins of Old Phlan. They proved themselves the saviors of Phlan by defeating Tyranthraxus and helping drive his minions outside the city's walls. Many of Phlan's dreadful and nefarious denizens had been ousted by the {{yearlinkName|1367}}, even though its infrastructure remained largely destroyed. Even then, the city as a whole possessed a renewed spirit and hope for better years to come.\n\nThroughout the late 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries, Old Phlan was gradually rebuilt to its former glory from some centuries past.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|52}}{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|60}} On occasion, there was some overlap with terminology, but by and large Old Phlan had merely become a part of the city's long and storied past.",

            "Nobles' Quarter": "Previously known as the Mansion District, this walled off portion of the city was situated on the east side of the [[Stojanow River]].\n* [[Kovel Mansion]], a noble estate that had been taken over for a period by a band of [[thieves]] and the [[illusionist]] known as [[Fengor]].\n* [[Lyceum of the Black Lord]], an old temple of [[Bane]] that served the city's [[Knights of the Black Fist]] before falling to ruin.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|27}}",
