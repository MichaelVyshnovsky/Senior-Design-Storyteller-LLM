        "mainbody": "Old Phlan, referred to the largest portion of Phlan that was occupied by monstrous creatures and lay in ruin throughout much of the citys history of destruction and rebuilding. It stood in stark contrast to Civilized Phlan, the last remnant of humanity within the citys walls throughout the middle of the 14 century DR, before Phlan was rebuilt whole once again, proud amongst the Moonsea powers.\nFor much of its history, the sealed chambers of Old Phlan often contained wondrous treasure and deadly monsters. When the city was still in ruin, builders often refused to work in these areas due to the risk to their safety.\nOld Phlan comprised nearly all of Phlan at one point, including part of the citys slums and all of the city blocks north, all the way to Valjevo Castle, along with the entirety of Mansion District on the opposite side of the Stojanow River.\nAfter reconstruction throughout the 15 century, Old Phlan became incorporated into the broader Old City, alongside the area previously referred to as Civilized Phlan. The Old City was the portion of Phlan that remained fortified within its city walls,\nIn the , Phlan was assailed by the dragons of Thar in a conflict that came to be known as the Dragon Run. The city was left in ruin and many of its citizens were slain outright. Its ruined streets became overrun by goblins, kobolds, orcs, and other monstrous creatures. Within the next few decades the ruins of what came to be known as Old Phlan were claimed by Tyranthraxus the Possessing Spirit, inhabiting the body of a bronze dragon and claimed the pool of radiance beneath Valjevo Castle.\nOver time, the Council of Ten and leading community members holed up in the area of the city near the docks known as Civilized Phlan, orchestrating the means by which they could reclaim their city. Adventurers, looters, thieves and other opportunistic individuals were attracted to the chaos of the city, some with ill intent, and others that sought to help make things better.\nThe city was given true hope for renewal when one intrepid band of heroes ventured into the ruins of Old Phlan. They proved themselves the saviors of Phlan by defeating Tyranthraxus and helping drive his minions outside the citys walls. Many of Phlans dreadful and nefarious denizens had been ousted by the , even though its infrastructure remained largely destroyed. Even then, the city as a whole possessed a renewed spirit and hope for better years to come.\nThroughout the late 14 and 15 centuries, Old Phlan was gradually rebuilt to its former glory from some centuries past. On occasion, there was some overlap with terminology, but by and large Old Phlan had merely become a part of the citys long and storied past.\nSlums District The poorest neighborhood in Phlan that stood directly northwest of Civilized Phlan.\n* Jeromes of Melvaunt, a general store run by a gentleman who came to the city from Melvaunt.\n* Nat Wylers Bell, an inn that was favored by criminals, mercenaries and other down-on-their-luck individuals.\n* Denelors Tower, a wizards tower that remained standing within the slums even during the worst time of the monstrous occupation.\n* Slum Market, the labyrinthine marketplace that was plagued by local pickpockets.\nNobles Quarter Previously known as the Mansion District, this walled off portion of the city was situated on the east side of the Stojanow River.\n* Kovel Mansion, a noble estate that had been taken over for a period by a band of thieves and the illusionist known as Fengor.\n* Lyceum of the Black Lord, an old temple of Bane that served the citys Knights of the Black Fist before falling to ruin.\nOther Landmarks\n* Cadorna Textile House, the mansion and mercantile business of the noble House Cadorna.\n* Kutos Well, a drinking well that concealed entrance to Phlans underground catacombs.\n* Mantors Library, the grand library that remained a treasure trove of knowledge even during the citys darkest days.\n* Podol Plaza, Phlans busy and lively marketplace.\n* Valjevo Castle, the home of the Cinnabar Throne and the seat of power for all of Phlan."
