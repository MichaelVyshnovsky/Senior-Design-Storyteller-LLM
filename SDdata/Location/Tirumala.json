        "mainbody": "Tirumala, sometimes called the \"Holy City,\" was a rich city-state in the Beastlands ruled over by a rakshasa of the same name as of the late 15 century DR.\nThe city was located among seven \"holy hills\" which sat at the northern end of the Curna Mountains south of Durpar and north of Estagund.\nThe city sat atop the ruins of a Durpari settlement that had been destroyed by giants. The old ruins were reclaimed and rebuilt by Tirumala, who claimed that the site was sacred.\nLater, in the , the city signed a unique trade agreement with Estagund which mystified the people of that realm, none of whom could believe that their raja would agree to such terms. In truth, the rajas trusted vizier, Devang was secretly a rakshasa in league with Tirumala.\nTirumala was primarily populated by rakshasa nobility, orc and hill giant soldiers, kenku spies, and slaves of human, halfling, and kenku origins."
