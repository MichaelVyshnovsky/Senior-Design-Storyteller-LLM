The '''Queen's Market''' was one of two major marketplaces in the city of [[Darromar]], the capital of [[Tethyr]]. northeast of [[Ithal Crag]] and the palace of [[Faerntarn]]. was located just off the Queen's Market.

Market fees to sell in the Queen's Market were 3 ''donsars'' ([[copper]] pieces) per day during the colder months of [[Marpenoth]] through [[Tarsakh]]. The fee was raised to 3 ''paxars'' ([[silver]] pieces) per day from [[Mirtul]] to [[Eleint]] and a full ''aenar'' ([[gold]] piece) on [[Greengrass|Greencourt]] and [[Highharvestide|Harvestcourt]].
