        "Geography": "The temple was located in the Underdark, below a dwarven mine and above the [[myconid]] cavern of King [[Feerus]]. It was several cavern floors above [[Menzoberranzan]].",
        "Defenses": "The stronghold had several puzzles and secret doors, some with instructions, requiring hidden keys or riddled with [[Dethek]] runes. Several traps were set around the perimeter, including ''[[fireball]]'' and [[spinner]] traps. If an intruder managed to access the lowest floor, many ''[[magic missile]]'' traps awaited them.\n\nIllusory walls were used in combination with the traps to hide artifacts required to move to the final temple level. They made sure that, even if they fell, the third and final floor could never be accessed by any others.",
        "History": "[[Clan Black Axe]] built the temple after they were forced out of their original home, the [[Cavern of Cloven Heads]], by [[Menzoberra the Kinless]] and her [[drow]] army. The clan prepared defenses and wrote books and notes about those slain at their previous home.\n\nLater, the dwarves fell in battle against an unknown drow house, which had allied with a group of [[derro]] dwarves, including numerous savants. After this event, the derro occupied the top two levels of the temple. During this time creatures such as [[hook horror]]s, [[dragazhar]]s, [[roper]]s, and [[spitting crawler]]s roamed the temple's halls. A pair of [[umber hulk]]s and an [[aboleth]] also made the temple their home.\n\nWhilst under derro control, the drow sent them a [[svirfneblin]] prisoner, [[Vlakverdling]], to cement their alliance. The deep gnome was later rescued by a group of adventurers, on their way to Menzoberranzan in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nThe same adventurers studied the dwarven parchments left by the Black Axe Clan, defeating many derro in their wake. After passing many secret passages, they acquired the artifacts (a chalice of healing waters and a holy symbol of Dumathoin) required to pass through to the third and level.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = 310px\n| source = Spirit of the Fountain\n| text   = Welcome, for here the spirit of the Black Axe Clan resides.
