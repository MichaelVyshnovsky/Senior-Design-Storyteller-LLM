        "mainbody": "The '''Dolsel Gap''' was a mountain pass found between [[Tashalar]] and [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Geography": "Located along the southern region of the [[Hazur Mountains]], the gap allowed passage between Thindol and Tashalar. The dense [[Black Jungles]] encroached upon the Dolsel Gap but gave way to the [[Guthland]].",
        "Description": "Dolsel Gap was covered with dense jungle that was perpetually cloaked with mist.",
        "Activity": "Dolsel Gap was heavily patrolled on both ends as it was the only navigable land route that connected the [[Thindol Basin]] with the Black Jungles. Vigilant Thindolese patrols refused entry for anyone passing into Thindol through Dolsel Gap, and the [[House Jennestas|Jennestas]] did the same for anyone attempting to enter the Black Jungles.\n\nTroops of baboonlike [[gambol]]s roved in the area as well.",
        "History": "Untold centuries before the 1300s [[DR]], [[yuan-ti]] sacrificed [[Lapal]] slaves in a vile ritual. Their tortured spirits rose as [[crimson death]]s haunting the Dolsel Gap, where they preyed on all sentient beings, [[human]]s and [[serpentfolk]] alike, but targeting especially yuan-ti.",
