The Yaks Horn was a southwestern province of the Yikarian Empire in 1367 DR.
This province was split into equal parts of rocky terrain from the World Pillar Mountains on the northeastern side, and a portion of the desert wasteland known as the Haunted Lands in the southwest. The Yaks Horn was easily the driest province of the Yikarian Empire.
Mother Millstone served as governor of the Yaks Horn.
