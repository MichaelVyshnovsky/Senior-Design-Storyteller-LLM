'''Bezentil''' was a walled trading settlement located in the [[Great Dale]], that was previously considered by the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] people to be a part of their territory in the countryside of [[Narfell]]. It was a town of farmers and outdoorsmen,

==Description==
Bezentil was easily recognizable by the ten, {{SI|5|ft}} tall stone markers that were situated {{SI|10|ft}} apart along the road passing through tows. Each of these were inscribed with the symbol of a tree set within a circle.

==Geography==
Bezentil was situated along the [[Great Road]], between the settlements of [[Uthmere]] and [[Kront]]. 

The ancient fortress of [[Val-Murthag]] was just two days' travel away from the town.

==Government==
Local governance was overseen by a village council, led by [[Kassantra Mufdan]], and law enforcement was carried out by Sheriff [[Trag Finstek]] and his handful of militiamen.

==Trade==
The only business conducted in Bezentil was trade between the locals and those folk passing along the Great Road.

It was one of the few locales in the Great Dale that housed a working forge, even if it did not boast particularly skilled metalsmiths.

==Defenses==
Both Bezentil and the land upon which it was built fell under the protection of the [[druid]]ic [[Circle of Leth]].

==History==
For many years leading up to the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Bezentil was one of the regions numerous "[[Waymeet (Narfell)|waymeets]]" of the numerous Nars tribes. These large swaths of land situated along elongated worn paths served as the camping grounds for the nomadic, [[horse]]-riding people.

In the {{YearlinkName|1338}}, the [[Windblown Goat]] inn was built along the side of the Great Road, attracting folks from the surrounding area. The increased number of visitors led to the town's founding within a short time.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, groups of [[wolves]] would gather around the town's walls on nights of a full moon, in what came to be known by locals as the Great Howling. The beasts would then carry out a series of attacks on nearby passers-by.

==Rumors & Legends==
Unbeknownst to the town's residents, Bezentil's stone markers dated back to when only [[elves]] lived in the Great Dale and possessed strong [[conjuration]] magic within their configuration. Anyone that touched each of the markers at a precise time during the vernal or autumnal equinoxes would be transported via ''[[portal]]'' to a matching set stone markers in the eastern continent of [[Kara-Tur]], bypassing the perilous [[Endless Wastes]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Divine Den]], considered the most important temple to [[Malar]] in all of [[Faerûn]].
* Stables and livery, operated by [[Cassilla Fen]]. 
* [[Strick's Trading Post]], the general store operated by [[Gennia]] and [[Abrihando Strick]].
* [[Windblown Goat]], the small but welcoming inn around which the town was built.
