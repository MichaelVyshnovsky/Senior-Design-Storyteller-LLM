        "mainbody": "'''Mouth o' Gargoyles''' was a [[village]] in the [[King's Forest]] in [[Cormyr]], situated on the [[Starwater Road]] (where it crossed [[Starwater River]]) between [[Dhedluk]] to the northwest and [[Immersea]] to the east.<ref name=VGC-p166><ref name=VGC-p171>",
        "History": "The village's name originated with a long-dead [[wizard]] who lived in a cave on the site. He used [[gargoyle]]s to launch raids at night against river cargoes and against travelers who camped in the area. Eventually, other wizards were hired to get rid of the winged terrors and their master. The [[magic]]al battle that followed destroyed the cave, which was previously known as the [[Mouth of the Gargoyles]], and only its name lived on.<ref name=VGC-p166/>\n\nThat titanic battle also caused an area of [[wild magic]] to manifest where the village later sat. This eldritch [[curse]] made the entire place extremely unpredictable for the use of magic, whether through [[spell]]s or the activation of [[magic item]]s (but not the mere presence of them). The use of such powers usually resulted in all kinds of strange, random, often harmful effects. This led to a permanent ban on the use of magic within the village by order of the Crown.<ref name=VGC-p166/>",
        "Government": "Signs were posted throughout Mouth o' Gargoyles for everyone to see, clearly stating that using magic was against [[Laws of Cormyr|Crown law]] because of the dangers. Violators were typically imprisoned for a [[tenday]] and had their carried goods confiscated. Guilty [[adventurer]]s had their charters revoked, or suspended for at least a month. Those who could prove their use of magic was purely accidental (which was difficult) received lighter sentences.<ref name=VGC-p166/> \n\n[[War Wizards]] and officers of the Crown were not bound by this law, but they had their own strict policies about breaking it.<ref name=VGC-p166/>",
        "Trade": "Professional trades engaged in by the villagers included woodcarving, furniture-making, and the production of oils (oilmakers were known as \"lighters\"). The lighters pumped natural oil from deep fissures near the site of the destroyed cave. The danger of this was that once in a while a fireball or a jet of flame would burst from the earth and hurl the lighter into the air. There was also a bad smell around the rocks that made many people sick. One type of oil produced and sold by the lighters was [[amberglow]]. This was used as a lubricant and to prevent blades from rusting.<ref name=VGC-p166/>",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Bendagar's Barrels": ":In this large former barn, the shopowner [[Bendagar]] and his team of workers made and sold [[barrel]]s of all sizes, small enough to fit in the palm of one's hand, or large enough to contain a full-grown [[horse]]. Never seen without a pipe and a [[tankard]] of [[ale]], Bendagar was described as looking rather like a barrel himself and enjoyed gossiping about Cormyrean politics and the nobility. His fair prices meant that [[merchant]]s could afford to buy his products in bulk.<ref name=VGC-p167>",
            "Thaelin's Finework": ":This shop was owned by [[Thaelin Althor]], a seven-feet-tall retired [[warrior]] from [[Chessenta]] who made and sold exquisitely crafted boxes and coffers of ornamental design. A pair of crossed [[sword|two-handed swords]] were mounted on his wall, and it was said that he used those swords to slay seventeen [[orc]]s when they came out of the forest to raid the village. Apparently, the raiders knew that they would not be fought with magic but made the fatal assumption that the village could not be defended.<ref name=VGC-p168>",
            "The Gargoyle's Perch": ":This roadhouse [[inn]] was run by twelve friends who also hired themselves out as escorts. It had a good selection of ales and stouts, but that was the best that could be said about it. The [[wine]] selection was poor, as was the food, and the rooms were dimly lit and rarely cleaned.<ref name=VGC-p168/>"
        },
        "Rumors and Legends": "One mystery that plagued Mouth o' Gargoyles was the strange disappearances of villagers throughout the years. Some believed they went through magical ''[[gate]]s'' that formed as a result of wild magic. Others speculated that a mad wizard had kidnapped them, or they were taken by [[drow]] raiders.<ref name=VGC-p166/>"
