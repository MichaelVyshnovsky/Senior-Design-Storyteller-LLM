The '''Giant's Craw''' was a valley at the eastern base of the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], just north of [[River Ashaba]] in [[Shadowdale]]. It was dotted with a few lone [[pine]] trees and had the remnants of a long-lost trail leading down to the rock bed, though it had not been used for ages.

==Features==
The valley was distinct for having a huge slab of shimmering [[obsidian]] that glowed with a violet hue. If any pieces of the stone were mined, or otherwise removed they lost this magical radiance. This was due to the fact the living rock was enchanted with a permanent ''[[faerie fire]]'' [[spell]].

The valley was also significant in that it held [[Shraevyn's Tomb]].

==History==
The valley was once home to a group of [[hill giant]]s but they were driven out some time before [[1359 DR]], by then-resistance-fighter [[Randal Morn|Lord Randal Morn]]. Around the year [[1369 DR]], the valley was known for having [[Zhentarim]] activity.
