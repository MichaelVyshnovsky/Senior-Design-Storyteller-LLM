'''Punton Bridge''' was a bridge in the nation of [[T'u Lung]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
This bridge was situated above the [[Fenghsintzu River]] in T'u Lung's [[Bashan Do]] province, ending right before the border between Bashan Do and [[Wai]], where it connected to the [[Conqueror's Highway]].

==History==
At some point a conflict was fought here by members of the [[Wai clan]], which came to be known as the "Stand of Punton Bridge". Combatants on the side of the Wai clan included [[Heomo Ling]], [[Jenshi]], and the [[bushi]] [[Sang Yi]], who were all rewarded afterwards for their bravery.<ref>

In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, in the month of [[Kara-Turan calendar|Hsuan]], an intelligent monster resembling a giant [[hippopotamus]] built a lair beneath the bridge. The nearby city of [[S'seh Yando]] sent four mighty [[warrior]]s to slay the beast, but they fell by its hands. From that point on the monster exerted control over the bridge, demanding a toll from anyone that wished to cross it.
