Punton Bridge was a bridge in the nation of Tu Lung in the 14 century DR.
This bridge was situated above the Fenghsintzu River in Tu Lungs Bashan Do province, ending right before the border between Bashan Do and Wai, where it connected to the Conquerors Highway.
At some point a conflict was fought here by members of the Wai clan, which came to be known as the "Stand of Punton Bridge". Combatants on the side of the Wai clan included Heomo Ling, Jenshi, and the bushi Sang Yi, who were all rewarded afterwards for their bravery.
In , in the month of Hsuan, an intelligent monster resembling a giant hippopotamus built a lair beneath the bridge. The nearby city of Sseh Yando sent four mighty warriors to slay the beast, but they fell by its hands. From that point on the monster exerted control over the bridge, demanding a toll from anyone that wished to cross it.
