'''Omberdawn villa''' was the familial estate of the [[Omberdawn]] family, as well as a magnificent public park located in the [[Myth Drannor/Cormanthor|Cormanthor]] district of [[Myth Drannor]]. Following the destruction of the city, the grounds became a swamp that was known as '''Sullymarsh'''.

==Description==
The structure of Omberdawn villa comprised two multi-level structures, one built upon the ground and another {{SI|40|ft|}} above at tree-level. The ground level building itself was three stories tall, with two subterranean levels.

==Geography==
Sullymarsh was connected to the lower level of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] in the north-west area of the park. The pathway of winding walkways to the north let to the once-serene [[Glim-Gardens]]. [[Speculum Grounds]] laid to Sullymarsh's south-west. 

King [[Pujik]]'s [[ormyrr]] tribe resided by one of the ''spawn pools'', an extension of the ''[[pool of radiance]]''.

A massive patch of healing [[blueglow moss]] could be found in the north-east of the marsh.

Sullymarsh was one of the locations of Myth Drannor that had beautiful spires of the city's Orrery constructed. The Spinning Spire of Sullymarsh laid destroyed in the Weeping War and was inactive ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
Architects of Myth Drannor used their engineering and magic skills to turn this marsh into a magnificent public park. The park surrounded a beautiful lake that was maintained via a complex system of waterways constructed by the [[dwarves]] of Myth Drannor and protected by water spirits, [[Naiad|naiads]]. Intricately-carved bridges were constructed to allow the citizens of the city to cross the waterways.

By [[1369 DR]] the nature and the failure of the city's waterways reverted Sullymarsh back to its natural state, a marsh.

During the [[Cult of the Dragon]] attempt to corrupt the city's ''[[mythal]]'' and the ''pool of radiance''. A group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] encountered the [[Pujik]]'s tribe and subsequently defeated him, freeing the ormyrr of the Cult's leader's corrupting influence. After the corruption was thwarted, the ''pool of radiance's'' ''spawning pools'' receded away from Sullymarsh. The ormyrr [[Samaj]] and [[Flem]] offered to trade with the rescuers to aid them in their quest.

==Inhabitants==
Before the fall of Myth Drannor, the villa housed one of the city's most respected noble elven houses. [[Avourel Omberdawn|Lord Avourel Omberdawn]] commanded the [[hippogriff]] wing of the [[Akh'Velahr]]'s [[Wing & Horn]] flying cavalry, while [[Fieryat Omberdawn|Lady Fieryat Omberdawn]] led the [[pegasi]] riders.

In [[1369 DR]], a tribe of [[ormyrr]] claimed Sullymarsh as their home, led by the king [[Pujik]], enthralled by [[Kya Mordrayn]] of the occupying forces of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

Sullymarsh was a hunting ground for [[gargoyle]]s and [[margoyle]]s that resided in the ruins of the city. The resurgent ''pool of radiance'' and the Cult's necromancers also flooded the area with the undead, some under the Cult's control, and some completely unleashed.

A ghost of [[Anorrweyn Evensong]], a [[cleric]] of [[Mystra]] could be encountered in the park she favored in life.
