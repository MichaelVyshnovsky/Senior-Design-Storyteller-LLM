        "mainbody": "'''Dun-Tharos''' was a city located near the center of the [[Rawlinswood]], which was the seat of various men and women known as [[Nentyarch]]s.",
        "History": "Construction of Dun-Tharos as a traditional citadel of black stone was completed in {{Yearlink|-970}} over the ruins of [[Narathmault]] by [[Thargaun Crell]], the first Nentyarch of Tharos (later [[Narfell]]). He named his realm, and his citadel, in honor of his father, who was the one to rediscover Narathmault forty-five years before. Dun-Tharos saw seventeen generations of Narfelli Nentyarchs occupy it before the end of the [[Great Conflagration (war)|Great Conflagration]] in the {{YearlinkName|-150}} that destroyed the Empire of Narfell.\n\nIt was not until the {{YearlinkName|722}}, when the Great Druid of [[Circle of Leth|Leth]] erected a tree-fortress around the ruins of the old citadel. The Great Druid took up the title of Nentyarch and passed the title on to their successors.\n\nThe Circle of Leth controlled Dun-Tharos for almost six hundred and fifty years until, on [[Midwinter]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the [[Chosen]] of [[Talona]], known as the [[Rotting Man]] led an army of corrupted [[druid]]s and [[volodni]]s to drive out the Circle.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|118}}\n\nThe Rotting Man killed and animated the fortress's trees and made Dun-Tharos his home. This situation lasted only sixteen months however, until the Rotting Man too was driven out. Unfortunately, the conflict that led to this occurrence, also roused the [[demon|demonic]] energies that dwelt beneath the citadel.\n\nStill dead and rotting from the influence of Talona, the place infested with demons, Dun-Tharos became a place of immense danger, ruled by several petty [[demon lord]]s{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|135}} and their [[fiend]]-worshiping mortal cultists, the [[Fraternity of Tharos]].{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|144}}",
        "Structure and Sample Rooms": "Dun-Tharos had once boasted great plazas, and temples dedicated to abyssal powers. There had been statuary, facades, and such, but they had crumbled by 1373 DR. Though the encroaching wilderness had reduced most of the city to stagnant pools and rubble, the outline of what had once been a city was still vaguely visible.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|271|29}}\n\nTunnels beneath the city stretched for miles in all directions. In them, wooden doors with pull-rings were common; as of {{yearlink|1373}}, they had held up against the passage of time, proving very resistant to the usual ravages. Stone faces were often carved around door frames.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|210|21}} Clutter and bizarre noises were common throughout the ruins. At least one of the underground rooms held obelisks, and another one, iron blades rising from the ground just like obelisks, though they had crumbled from rust and use. Another room in the underground tunnels beneath the city was covered in murals of vile acts, some of which were bleached of all color. It was a trap, where anyone who touched or got too close to the pictography in the ground would be absorbed into it.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|213-214|21}} Another room held a number of salt-like crystals of numerous sizes, which were actually an otherwise unknown kind of [[demon]].\n\nThe [[Barrow of the Queen Abiding]] connected these tunnels to a location just past the [[Arches of Xenosi]], several miles away from the city, through a secret door.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|173-174|17}} The [[Sighing Vault]] was hidden somewhere in these labyrinthine tunnels.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|186|18}} The [[Lurker in the Middle]] was also lurking amongst those corridors.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|215|22}}\n\n[[The Close]], a fortress made of magically grown trees, had been added to aboveground Dun-Tharos in {{yearlink|722}} by the [[Circle of Leth]]. The head druid of that circle began to call himself the [[Nentyarch]] by that time.",
