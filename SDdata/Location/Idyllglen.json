The town's cleric [[Solndor Brightstar]] led the population in prayer to [[Lathander]] for help. The deity, moved by the townsfolk's bravery, sent the then-[[solar]] Zariel to their aid. With the angel's help, the gnolls were driven away.\n\nSome time later, the gnolls attacked again, personally led by [[Yeenoghu]] and aided by [[demon]]s. Zariel led the [[Hellriders]] to fight the demons, banishing Yeenoghu."
