A '''cove with hot springs''' was located somewhere along the coast of [[Stormwreck Isle]] off the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Description==
The cove was filled with steam and the water from above spilled into a grey basalt hollow making the water look turquoise and luminescent. This pool was framed with rare vibrantly colored [[wind spore]]s. Life-giving magic persisted in the cove and those who bathed in its spring could restore their health.

==Inhabitants==
The cove was once the site of a [[brass dragon]]'s death.<ref group="note">Presumably, it was the place where the legendary brass dragon [[Turadaer]] died centuries prior to 1481 DR, as the cove had significant magical effects.

''Circa'' [[1481 DR]],{{Stormwreck-time}} three [[fume drake]]s inhabited the waters of the hot spring, ready to kill anyone intending to gather the mushrooms or enter the water.
