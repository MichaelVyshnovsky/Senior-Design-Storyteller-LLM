A cove with hot springs was located somewhere along the coast of Stormwreck Isle off the Sword Coast North.
The cove was filled with steam and the water from above spilled into a grey basalt hollow making the water look turquoise and luminescent. This pool was framed with rare vibrantly colored wind spores. Life-giving magic persisted in the cove and those who bathed in its spring could restore their health.
The cove was once the site of a brass dragons death.Presumably, it was the place where the legendary brass dragon Turadaer died centuries prior to 1481 DR, as the cove had significant magical effects.
Circa 1481 DR, three fume drakes inhabited the waters of the hot spring, ready to kill anyone intending to gather the mushrooms or enter the water.
