Sayan was a city in Laothan in Malatra and the biggest seaport in the realm.
It was situated on Laothans northern coast, on the shore of the Eastern Sea southeast of the Hanchi Shoals. A trail ran west along the coast to Thiam and another ran south through the jungle to Pursai.
The city was the home of the Nuyen, a powerful clan in Laothan. As of 1357 DR, it was ruled by Prince Nuyen Phi. The Nuyen and their allies and supporters together maintained the largest army in Laothan and dominated the north.
