'''Thruldar''', the most westerly outpost of [[Estagund]],<ref> was found on the border of [[Luiren]], on the edge of the [[Lluirwood]].<ref> It was located along the trade route which ran from Estagund and [[Durpar]] west to [[Delzimmer]] in northern Luiren in the lands between the Lluirwood and the [[Toadsquat Mountains]]<ref>. Referred to as Traders Way,<ref> the great Trade Way,<ref> or the Great Trader's Way.<ref>, this was presumably a section of [[Trader's Way]], or a branch of it.<ref group="note">This road is shown on older maps (''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'', page 11) and ''[[The Shining South (1993)]]'' as winding between the [[Toadsquat Mountains]] and the [[Lluirwood]], but newer maps show no such road (''FRCS'' 3rd-edition map and ''[[Shining South (sourcebook)]]'', page 143).

At some point this was a thriving town of around 9,000, around a third of which were [[Halfling|hin]] and special facilities for smaller folk could be found in most inns. The prominent halfling Baker [[Chaka|chaka]] did business here, dealing in exotic foodstuffs, and it was the home base of the Cochin chaka, which specialised in woodworking and over half the population either worked for or with. Their warehouses dominated the town along with sawmills and woodworking shops. Wood from the Lluirwood was shipped all over the [[Shining Lands]] and Luiren. The two largest temples were to [[Tymora]] and [[Silvanus]].<ref><ref group="note">The estimated date for the information in ''[[The Shining South (1993)]]'' is 1367 DR, but maps use the ruin icon for this settlement, and according to later sources (''[[Shining South (sourcebook)]]'' '''Thruldar''' was destroyed in 1264 DR.

'''Thruldar''' fell into ruin following its destruction by a [[druid]] named [[Voolad Espiral]] and his army of [[Dark tree|dark trees]] and other plant creatures. Most of the inhabitants were slain during the surprise attack and the town was razed. Several of the local ghostwise hin tribes banded together to slay the druid, but he would soon rise again as a ghost. The hin placed powerful spells upon '''Thruldar''''s walls and sealed the spirit and his remaining minions inside. Thereafter they kept careful watch on the area to discourage adventures seeking the settlement's abandoned wealth from disturbing the wards and possibly freeing Voolad.<ref> Although Voolad had been long since dead, his mad spirit remained trapped in the settlement and was released during the [[Spellplague]].<ref>
