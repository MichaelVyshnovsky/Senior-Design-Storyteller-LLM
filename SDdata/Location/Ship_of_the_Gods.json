However, an eruption killed all the population of the island.\nAround 1357 DR, the island was used as a pirate haven. It was believed that some pirates had stolen the Galley of the Gods and hid it on the island.\nAn eruption in 1369 DR caused part of its upper slopes to collapse, There have been unconfirmed speculative claims that there was treasure buried inside the volcano.\nThe island seem to have disappeared after the Spellplague of 1385 DR.As the island is not mentioned in 4th edition related lore, neither appears in post-Spellplague official maps.\nA secret temple to Geb called the Golden Forge was located within a volcano on the island."
