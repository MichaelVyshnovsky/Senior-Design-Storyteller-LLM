        "History": "Around [[957 DR]], the island was settled by [[Unther]]ans. However, an eruption killed all the population of the island.\n\nAround [[1357 DR]], the island was used as a pirate haven. It was believed that some pirates had stolen the [[Galley of the Gods]] and hid it on the island.\n\nAn eruption in [[1369 DR]] caused part of its upper slopes to collapse, There have been unconfirmed speculative claims that there was treasure buried inside the volcano.\n\nThe island seem to have disappeared after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]].<ref group=\"note\">As the island is not mentioned in 4th edition related lore, neither appears in post-Spellplague official maps.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "A secret temple to [[Geb]] called the [[Golden Forge]] was located within a volcano on the island."
