        "mainbody": "he Giantspire Gap, also called the Giant Gap, was the main pass through the Giantspire Mountains separating Damara and Narfell.\nWhile it was the main pass through the mountains, it was more appropriately described as a region of foothills between the taller spurs of the Giantspire Mountains. The Long Road passed through the Gap between Damara to the west and Narfell to the east, though this route was seldom used, owing to marauding monsters During the winter, the Gap was completely blocked by snow.\nAlthough treacherous, the Gap was the primary trade route connecting Damaran merchants to the Nar tribes.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Gap was claimed by both Damara and Narfell, as well as by Kardobbik, the hobgoblin king of the Giantspires.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, travelers through the Gap were subject both to headhunting raids by the bugbears of the Blood Mountain tribe as well as to paying a toll charged by the goblins of the Razor Heart tribe. The Razor Heart queen, Maaqua, was beleived to have a relationship with Damara that emboldened her \"taxation\" of the route."
