The '''Sumber Hills''' were a range of hills in the middle of the [[Dessarin Valley]]. The [[River Dessarin]] flowed through the hills, providing a source of water travel between [[Yartar]] and downstream communities such as [[Beliard]], [[Bargewright Inn]], and [[Womford]]. The [[Larch Path]] and the [[Dessarin Road]] provided passage through the hills.

==History==
One of the first settlements in the Sumber Hills was the underground city of [[Tyar-Besil]], a part of the [[shield dwarf]] kingdom of [[Besilmer]]. Tyar-Besil was abandoned and fell into ruin in {{Yearlink|-4190}}, after the king of Besilmer died in battle.

The Sumber Hills were left alone until the [[Knights of the Silver Horn]] started clearing the area of its native inhabitants in the {{YearlinkName|893}}. The knights attempted to set up fortresses in the hills but were stopped by [[Uruth Ukrypt]]. These events eventually played a part in the [[Orcfastings War]], and the First and Second [[Trollwars]].

Around the {{YearlinkName|1000}}, settlements started springing up around the Sumber Hills, creating roads and trails that bisected the hills.
