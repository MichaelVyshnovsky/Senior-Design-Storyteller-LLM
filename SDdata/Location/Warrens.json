        "mainbody": "The '''Warrens''' was an unofficial neighborhood underneath the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] and [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] in [[Waterdeep]]. The newest delvings extended east through the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]], to the side of the plateau, which were then used to build cliff-face homes overlooking the [[Undercliff]]. The tunnels mainly consisted of 5-foot tall passages and rooms which avoided intersecting with the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers]] and [[Undermountain]].\n\nThe Warrens had existed for hundreds of years by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and were inhabited primarily by [[gnome]]s and [[halfling]]s. The existence of the tunnels was unknown to most Waterdhavians until the gnomes told the halfings about the tunnels and the halflings told everyone else, and by [[1479]] DR increasing numbers of dwarves were also finding homes there.\n\nAround 1479 DR the mining through the City of the Dead repeatedly breached into the tombs there. Although the damages were quickly repaired, reports of hauntings and apparitions began emerging in the tunnels, and even rumors of residents being possessed by restless spirits. Some enterprising residents then began trying to take advantage of the situation by seeking out the alleged ghosts, hoping to question them and learn the secrets of the Waterdhavian nobility.\n\nThere was a temple dedicated to [[Baravar Cloakshadow]] located within the Warrens. The elder high priest of the temple, as of 1479 DR, was [[Ompahr Daergech]]. His great-great-great-granddaughter, [[Roywyn Daergech]] was also a priest at the temple.<ref>"
