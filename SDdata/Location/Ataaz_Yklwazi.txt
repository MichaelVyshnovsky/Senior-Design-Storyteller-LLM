Ataaz Yklwazi, meaning Gorge of Blades in the Chultan language, was a volcanic canyon in Chult located north of the Valley of Lost Honor.
The canyon earned its name from the jagged shards of basalt that shot up from the ground. They resembled the Chultan short spears known as yklwas.
As of the late 15 century DR, Ataaz Yklwazi was territory under the control of local firenewts.
