        "mainbody": "The Misbegotten Realms were a place somewhere.\nIt was the site of the Verdant Desert, which was formerly known as the Verdant Forest before something Nimrod of Nump, the mage who made his lair there, did.\nThe realms had some unexplained, and possibly unwanted, connection to Earth, recording several strange and occasionally regrettable references to its popular culture of past decades.\nOne of the realms was the Kingdom of Slumdudgeon. Within its borders stood the legendary House of Out, whatever that was.\nThe realms were home to such mages as Nimrod of Nump, inventor of spells and magical items and mishaps Mooncalf the Monocular, who once cast Bigbys interposing eye without another eye handy and of course the great sage Elkwhisker, who went to Earth and rambled on about all this.\nIt was a silly place."
