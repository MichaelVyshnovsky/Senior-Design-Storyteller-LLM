        "Geography": "It was the site of the Verdant Desert, which was formerly known as the Verdant Forest before something Nimrod of Nump, the mage who made his lair there, did.\n\nThe realms had some unexplained, and possibly unwanted, connection to [[Earth]], recording several strange and occasionally regrettable references to its popular culture of past decades.",
        "Notable Locations": "One of the realms was the Kingdom of Slumdudgeon. Within its borders stood the legendary House of Out, whatever that was.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "The realms were home to such mages as [[Nimrod of Nump]], inventor of spells and magical items and mishaps; Mooncalf the Monocular, who once cast ''Bigby's interposing eye'' without another eye handy; and of course the great sage [[Elkwhisker]], who went to Earth and rambled on about all this.",
