Gurdeth, which was also called the City of Stilts, was a small city found in southern Thindol on the shore of the Thingulph.
Gurdeth was founded on the western shores of the Thingulph atop an island found in the middle of the River Gur where it emptied into the gulf.
Gurdeth was called the "City of Stilts" because the vast majority of its buildings rested upon poles. Most buildings were also tied to neighboring structures for added stability during periodic flooding. Since most of Gurdeths buildings were raised, the roads within the city were found beneath the buildings, making them dark and gloomy places even during the day. Anyone brave enough to travel Gurdeths underroads did so well-armed.
The merchants and traders of Gurdeth were quite wealthy, though the means of their success was acquired through disreputable methods and cutthroat politics.
House Sseradess poisoned Gurdeths wells with a diluted poison that created tainted one and broodguards servants for the yuan-ti.
