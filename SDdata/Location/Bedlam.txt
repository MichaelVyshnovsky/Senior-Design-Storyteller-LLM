'''Bedlam''' was a large [[gate-town]] leading to [[Pandemonium]] from the [[Outlands]]. 

{{Quote|''You don't have to be barmy to live here, but it sure helps!''|Gossup Blint of the Bleak Cabal}}

==Description==
The gate-town was divided into three parts. The lowest part of the town, called Gatemouth, was found on the lower slope of the hill upon which Bedlam was built. From here, eight large boulevards begin their rise to the rest of the gate-town. The architecture in this part of Bedlam was mishmash of chaotic designs, filled with unnaturally curved walls and corners that seem to alter reality itself. The upper part of Bedlam, called the Citadel district, was located further up the hill. The architecture in this part of the gate-town was far less chaotic and was home to the upper class of Bedlam. Dividing Citadel and Gatemouth was Midtown. This wide district was home to most of the inns and taverns found in Bedlam.

===Gates===
The gate to Pandemonium was located in Gatemouth. It was found within a very tall tower made from [[obsidian]]. The tower was as tall as Maurash and topped with a large hand reaching for the sky. Along the base of the tower were six entrances called blastgates. From these archways of [[iron]] and stone a constant, foul smelling wind blew across the gate-town.

==Geography==
Bedlam was built on the slopes of Maurash, a hill made of volcanic stone.

==Inhabitants==
Bedlamites were known for being malevolent and spiteful. Anyone who spent more than a few days in Bedlam tended to display symptoms of extreme anxiety and narcissism, as well arguing with voices whose origin was unknown, compelling an individual to break free from reason and sanity.

==History==
During the reign of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], a [[half-elven]] [[paladin]] of [[Oghma]] from [[Cormyr]] was dispatched on a mission to explore the [[planes of existence]] beyond [[Toril]]. The paladin's name was [[Ambran|Ambran the Seeker]], and excerpts from his journal still survive to this day. In the final volume of the journal, he described arriving in Bedlam and his time there.{{Cite dragon/204/The Plane Truth Part II: A Journey to the Outlands}}{{Cite dragon/205/The Plane Truth Part III: The Transformation}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Some Bedlamites held that the massive tower around the gate was formed as the result of some long-forgotten [[deity|god]] unsuccessful attempt to escape Pandemonium. Others claimed the tower was a piece of art crafted personally by either [[Cyric]], [[Hruggek]] or [[Zeboim]].
