The '''Fields of Nun''' was an open stretch of land running through the northern region of [[Chondath]] between the [[Vilhon Reach]] and the [[Akanamere]].

==Description==
The Fields were fallow and tainted by the death and [[disease]] that had been inflicted there in times passed.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Trail of Tears:The Scourge of Pestilence}}

==Geography==
The Fields of Nun lay between the [[Nunwood]] and the northern end of the [[Chondalwood]]. The [[River Nun]] ran through it.

The Fields lay along the [[Trail of Tears]], a pilgrimage route for the devout of [[Tempus]]. Pilgrims arrived from a one-way ''[[portal]]'' in [[Mistledale]] amid a ring of standing stones on a hill overlooking the river, followed the trail to an unnamed barrow on which nothing could grow because of all the diseased soldiers buried beneath,{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Trail of Tears:Death Before Dishonor}}

==History==
The Fields of Nun was the site of an expenditure of [[Necromantic]] [[magic]] in {{YearlinkName|902}}, that released a devastating plague upon Chondath during a civil war that was later called the [[Rotting War]] because of the disease.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Garagos]] appeared near the ruins of the village of [[Gosra]] to destroy the imposter [[marilith]] [[Glackzana]] who had constructed a temple in his name.

==Inhabitants==
The fields were haunted by [[ghoul]]s and [[ghast]]s that still carried diseases from the Rotting War, such as [[cackle fever]] and [[red ache]].
