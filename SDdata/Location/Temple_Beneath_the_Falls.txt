The '''Temple Beneath the Falls''' was a series of caves located behind the [[Feather Falls (waterfall)|Feather Falls]] in [[Featherdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Inhabitants==
Children from the village of [[Feather Falls (village)|Feather Falls]] enjoyed playing in the caves. Smugglers and other darker sorts used the caves to hide items as well as themselves. The caves had been used for kidnappings and slave trading as well.

==History==
Sometime during the mid-1260s [[DR]], the townsfolk took up arms against cultists who were using the caves as a temple. It remained unclear as to whom the cultists served, but guesses included [[Moander]], [[Juiblex]], [[Ghaunadaur]], and [[Ilsensine]].
