'''Ansi''' , meaning '''West Protecting Fortress''', was a small town located in the northern regions of the [[Quoya Desert]] within the [[Hordelands]] around [[1359 DR]].

==Description==
The small town of Ansi was little more than a fortified inn built near an oasis of bitter water.

What little importance the town had came from the fact that it sat at the top of a narrow pass in the hills of the Quoya Desert, and only its close proximity to [[Shou Lung]] kept it from being totally unknown.

The town itself was mostly rundown buildings, surrounded by a wall of brick. The wells produced enough water for a few small [[melon]] farms, but farming in the area was difficult because of the constant winds blowing dust, which often accumulated along the walls, sometimes even spilling over.

The town offered few services, including a [[wikipedia:en:caravanserai|caravanserai]], wool and hide dealers, a few melon farmers, and a pair of merchants who bought and sold goods with the nomads who came and went through the year. It also had a small temple to the Shou gods, serviced by a single priest.

==Inhabitants==
No more than 100 people lived in this small settlement. Most, if not all, of them had [[Shou]] ancestry.

[[Li Kao-teh]], the owner of the caravanserai, was secretly an agent for the Shou Lung empire, reporting strangers and unusual events to the censors of the nearby province of [[Chukei]].
