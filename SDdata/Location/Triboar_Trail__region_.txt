The Triboar Trail was a stretch of foothills and rolling, sparsely wooded plains extending between the Sword Mountains to the south and the Neverwinter Woods to the north. The area got its name from the trail of the same name. The Triboar Trail was also sometimes referred to as the Triboar Cutoff  or named after the town of Conyberry as the Cony Gap.
