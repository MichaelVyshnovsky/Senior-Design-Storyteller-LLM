'''Abbor''' was a village in [[Tethyr]] that supplied the city of [[Ithmong]] (later [[Darromar]]) with food.

==Description==
Abbor was a small [[hamlet]] of about 80 to 100 persons living in 12 to 15 simple homes. The village was surrounded by farmland. The villagers divided up the land into smaller fields with fences and tall bushes, where they cultivated cereal crops.

==Geography==
Abbor was located in the county of [[Monteshi]], in the duchy of [[Ankaram]] in Tethyr.<ref name=LoI1-T-map /> The village was located southeast of the city of Ithmong about {{SI|5|miles|k|long=yes}} from the [[Ithal Road]].

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], many of the crops in Abbor and the surrounding villages were destroyed in the chaos of that world-shattering event. A month after the Time of Troubles ended, however, things did not return to normal. Instead, the population of monsters in the region seemed to increase, and this led to a shortage of food in nearby Ithmong, which relied on Abbor and other nearby villages for food. The monsters made it impossible to prepare the fields for planting in the next spring, as it was too dangerous to do so. [[Manticore]]s had even attacked and killed a few of the villagers and carried off several [[goat]]s. Between Abbor and nearby [[Ruba]], [[ankheg]]s were appearing in the fields and terrorizing farmers.

These monsters were, in fact, summoned to the region by a series of [[Thayvian beacon]]s as part of a plot by the [[Knights of the Shield]] and [[Inselm Hhune]] to prevent [[Ernest Gallowglass]] from rising to power over all of Tethyr&mdash;a position that Hhune himself wanted&mdash;during the time of anarchy known as the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]].

The [[Company of Eight]] became involved and hired a group of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the area and determine the cause of all the monster attacks.
