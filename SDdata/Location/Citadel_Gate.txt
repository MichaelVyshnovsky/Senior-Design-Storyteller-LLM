The '''Citadel Gate''' was the city gate of [[Baldur's Gate]] that separated [[Watch Citadel]] and its [[Citadel Streets|surrounding district]] from the rest of the [[Upper City]].

This gate was only way in and out of the district, used by [[the Watch]] to launch mounted patrols from their fortress in the late 1400s [[DR]]. These [[horse]]s were the only ones allowed in the city, and their excursions were largely ceremonial in nature.
