''The Forgotten Realms Atlas'' also has the label seem to overlap with Malatra, of which the Kuong Kingdom is a part. This suggests Malatra and the Warring States might be the same, or that the Warring States are a part of Malatra.

By that time, [[Nu'sazto Ichi]], the son of a captured general of the Warring States, had been brought to the imperial court in [[Wai]], kept as an amusement despite his clumsy attempts to assassinate Emperor [[Wai Gada Sinzu]]. The emperor believed Nu'sazto to be a crude barbarian."
