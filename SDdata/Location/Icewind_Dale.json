            "Early History": "Millennia before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the great [[frost giant]] Jarl [[Kelvin Duarol]] came into the possession of the ''[[Crenshinibon]]''. This ancient and evil [[artifact]] crafted by seven powerful [[lich]]s allied with the [[demon lord]] [[Errtu]], and was first brought to [[Toril]] in the far-off continent of [[Zakhara]]. Kelvin attempted to use the power of the ''Crenshinibon'' to forge a new frost giant kingdom atop the ruins of ancient [[Ostoria]] but was ultimately unsuccessful. His schemes attracted the anger of the god [[Tempus]], who in turn slew Kelvin\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-2100}}, [[Illusk]]an refugees first migrated to Icewind Dale and settled. Their descendants came to found the original [[Reghedmen]] barbarian tribes. Over time, they were joined by [[Northlander]]s who ventured north along the [[Sword Coast]] in longships.\n\nCenturies before the [[Era of Upheaval]], Arakon the Arch-Mage [[Conquest of Arakon the Arch-Mage|attempted to conquer]] Icewind Dale with his army of mercenaries. Over the course of weeks, he butchered and enslaved the people of the [[Uthgardt]] and [[Reghedmen]] barbarian tribes. [[Jerrod]], a warrior-[[shaman]] of [[Tempos]]―the local name of Tempus―rallied the tribes that remained, and together they turned away the mercenary army. Desperate to to still achieve victory, Arakon conjured a ''[[portal]]'' and summoned a horde of [[demon]]s from the [[lower planes]]. In order to save his people, and all of Icewind Dale, Jerrod threw himself into the ''portal'', sacrificing his life and preventing the fiends from overwhelming the region.\n\nLess than a generation later, [[Kresselack]] the Black Wolf emerged as a great leader among the barbarian tribes of the dale. He slaughtered many in his own campaign of conquest, but managed to unite the tribes within a single kingdom for a brief time.\n\nThe collective settlements of the Ten Towns were founded some time during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]]. Bryn Shander was the first among the towns to attract adventurers, businesspeople, or other folks looking for a second start to their life.",
            "13{{th}} Century": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1269}}, [[Damien Morienus]], a former master of the North Tower of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] relocated to Icewind Dale. He was a powerful [[necromancer]] who was using the local barbarian tribes for his horrific experiments. Eventually, he summoned demons to exact revenge on his enemies. The monsters used their infernal magics to summon hellfire that melted all the snow away. The areas to the Northwest of Ten Towns and the shores of [[Maer Dualdon]] suffered the most by floods and permafrost's melting, killing a barbarian tribe, and the inhabitants of the [[Accursed Tower]] that sank into the mud. This disaster later became known as the [[Great Thaw]] by the locals. Most never learned about the true nature of it believing it to be a natural event. \n\n[[File:Cryshal Tirith.png|thumb|right|300px|''The Cryshal Tirith conjured by Belhifet over the village of Easthaven.'']]\nJust over a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the [[devil]] [[Belhifet]] himself attempted to conquer Icewind Dale. Belhifet had been imprisoned on Toril by the [[tanar'ri]] superiors for punishment regarding a blood feud that threatened to disrupt the infernal hierarchy. Belhifet was contact by the ''[[Crenshinibon]]'', a malevolent artifact lost to the ages of time. The ''Crenshinibon'' allowed Belhifet to awaken from his icy prison and raise an army to conquer the region. While the fiend managed to briefly freeze over the settlement of Easthaven, he was banished back to [[Avernus]] by the intrepid adventurers. \n\nLater that same year, barbarian lord [[Wylfdene]] claimed to be a reincarnation of the famed Uthgardt hero Jerrod. Backed by the claim, and secretly possessed by the vengeful spirit of a white dragon [[Icasaracht]], Wylfdene built an outpost on Bremen's Run and guided unite tribes against the Ten Towns who took rightfully barbarian lands. He helmed several battles against the warriors of the Ten Towns and dwarves of [[Clan Battlehammer]] until the same group of adventurers arrived to resolve the conflict peacefully. Diplomacy failed and Wylfdene was slain. Despite the fact that Icasaracht's possession was unknown to most and forgotten by the history books, the adventurers traveled to the spirit's lair and destroyed her.",

The [[cambion]]s [[Isair]] and [[Madae]] founded the [[Legion of the Chimera]], a horde of monstrous half-breed creatures that rallied at the [[Severed Hand]] fortress. The legion fought a number of battles with the militias of the Ten Towns, and were ultimately vanquished by a group of mercenary adventurers.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1351}}, [[Heafstaag]] and his group of barbarians fail to conquer the settlement of [[Termalaine]] in their massive sweep of the Ten-Towns. In this same year, the ''Crenshinibon'', a powerful magical item lost to the ages, was found by [[Akar Kessel]], an apprentice [[wizard]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] from [[Luskan]]. Over the next few years, Kessel amassed an army of [[goblinoid]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[giant]]s and allied himself with the [[demon lord]] Errtu.\n\nFive years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, they newly-named \"Tyrant of Icewind Dale\" attempted to conquer all of Icewind Dale. Kessel and his forces were thwarted by the [[Companions of the Hall]] adventurers, the dwarves of [[Clan Battlehammer]], and allied folks of the Ten Towns,  in a great conflict known as the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]]. The ''Crenshinibon'' was destroyed in the battle, and its malevolent 'demonic magic' afflicted the native ''chardalyn'' in Icewind Dale.\n\nSeveral powerful individuals attempted to seize power following the defeat of Akar Kessel's army. Notable among them were Jarl [[Utaar Kelvinsson]], a mad [[beholder]] called [[Hagedorn]], and even [[Levistus]] the Prince of [[Stygia]] in the Nine Hells.\n\nAfter the dwarven fortress of [[Mithral Hall]] was reclaimed that same year, several hundred dwarves relocated to the settlements of Icewind Dale.",

The substance had a corruptive influence on anyone that handled it or came within close proximity. Soon after, Akar Kessel returned as a [[lich]], and raised hordes of [[zombified]] dwarves and began assailing travelers and caravans that crossed the snowy landscape of the realm.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, Icewind Dale was cursed by the goddess [[Auril]]. She plunged the lands into ongoing darkness, preventing the sun from appearing within the sky each morning. Referred to by locals as the [[Everlasting Rime]], this supernatural phenomenon afflicted Icewind Dale for at least two years.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|5-6}} Plant life died, animals went into hiding, and food became scared during that time.
