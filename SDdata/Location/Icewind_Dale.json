        "mainbody": "Icewind Dale was an arctic tundra located in the Frozenfar region of the North, It earned its name from the harsh winds and icy storms that destroyed buildings and scoured the landscape.\nthumb|left|300px|The snowy wastes of the dale, some ways off from the Ten Towns.\nThe dale was a harsh, near-uninhabitable  land that regularly plunged below freezing temperatures. and the region received little sunlight, particularly during the severe winter months. It was home to only the most hardened of frontiersmen, pioneers, and barbarians. Beyond the sporadic dots of civilization dwelled terrifying beasts and deadly monsters of the North.\nMost folks traversed the dale by means of dogsled or by foot with the use of snowshoes. Yet some others preferred to ride atop axe beaks native to the region.\nIcewind Dale experienced freezing temperatures for much of the year. While kinder summer months ranged from 11 to 70 (–12 to 21), the temperature of the unforgiving winters dipped as low as -40 (-40). While snowfall was relentless, much of it blew east to the nearby Reghed Glacier.\nFierce blizzards ravaged the snowy wastelands of Icewind Dale and avalanches were regular occurrences within its mountainous regions.\nthumb|right|350px|A map of Icewind Dale marked with important cities and landmarks.\nThe dale was located south and east of the Trackless Sea, north of the Sword Coast and west of the icy Reghed Glacier.\nIt was primarily accessible by the Northern Means, the road that extended north from the coastal city of Luskan.\nIcewind Dale was home to animals like hares, arctic foxes, reindeer, and elk, along with beasts like crag cats, mammoths, polar bears, saber-toothed tigers, snowy owlbears, and monstrous yetis.\nOther dangerous creatures found throughout the region included elementals known as air weirds, undead spirits known as coldlight walkers, and perhaps most-terrifying, a number of white dragons,\nThere was scarce plant life to be found throughout the region, save for a solitary forest and the Great Oak around which a lone town was founded. and especially hardy lichen was among the notable types of flora that managed to endure the frigid elements of Icewind Dale.\nthumb|right|350px|A long trek across the ice for Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore.\nThe dale was famous for its three mineral-laden lakes Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters.\n* Maer Dualdon The largest and deepest of the three lakes was once the premier destination for all who dared the trek that far north.\n* Lac Dinneshere The waters of the lake appeared to change in hue depending on the weather that was just about to wash over the dale.\n* Redwaters The smallest lake earned its name from a bloody battle that took place on the land over which towns were built.\n* Redrun This stream flowed from Lac Dinneshere into the small Redwaters lake.\n* Shaengarne River While the waters of this river flowed into the Trackless Sea year-round, its top waters froze over during winter.\nthumb|right|300px|A view of Kelvins Cairn, Lonelywood, and Maer Dualdon.\n* Kelvins Cairn, a peak that offered fresh water to the surrounding lakes when \"spring\" bloomed every Midsummer.\n* Mount Shatterglass, the  peak that offered a spectacular view over the dale below.\n* Bremens Run\n* Dwarven Valley, a miles-long chasm and adjoining network of caves that extended out from Kelvins Cairn.\n* Fields of Slaughter, the ancient battlefield that spread across between the Severed Hand and the Spine of the World.\n* Icewind Pass\nThe capital of Icewind Dale, Bryn Shander, was also its largest settlement.\nthumb|right|150px|A trade caravan making its way from Luskan to the Ten Towns.\nPerhaps the greatest industry of Icewind Dale was the fishing and utilization of knucklehead trout. Many of the regions lakeside settlements relied entirely on the trout they fished and the goods they made from their ivory-like bones. Knucklehead scrimshaw was the art that few mastered, and skilled scrimshanders were held in high esteem.\nKnucklehead scrimshaw goods made their way across the Realms. Some carvings could be found as far away as Durpar, some  to the south in the Shining Lands. In those far-off lands they sold for as much as 6,000 gp.\nWhale oil was an important commodity in settlements across Icewind Dale. Because wood was so scarce, oil was the preferred means to warm hearth and home. As such, whaling throughout the Sea of Moving Ice was among the more profitable industries of the region.\nOne of the most unique natural riches that could be found in Icewind Dale was a mineral known as chardalyn. This naturally-occurring stone could absorb magical energy, which was subsequently released when the mineral was crushed or otherwise destroyed.\nThe history of Icewind Dale was one of malign influence and warring conflict. Over the centuries, the region was repeatedly conquered and re-conquered by despots and would-be monarchs, and continuously corrupted by evil powers from far off realms and other planes of existence.\nMillennia before the Era of Upheaval, the great frost giant Jarl Kelvin Duarol came into the possession of the Crenshinibon. This ancient and evil artifact crafted by seven powerful lichs allied with the demon lord Errtu, and was first brought to Toril in the far-off continent of Zakhara. Kelvin attempted to use the power of the Crenshinibon to forge a new frost giant kingdom atop the ruins of ancient Ostoria but was ultimately unsuccessful. His schemes attracted the anger of the god Tempus, who in turn slew Kelvin\nIn , Illuskan refugees first migrated to Icewind Dale and settled. Their descendants came to found the original Reghedmen barbarian tribes. Over time, they were joined by Northlanders who ventured north along the Sword Coast in longships.\nCenturies before the Era of Upheaval, Arakon the Arch-Mage attempted to conquer Icewind Dale with his army of mercenaries. Over the course of weeks, he butchered and enslaved the people of the Uthgardt and Reghedmen barbarian tribes. Jerrod, a warrior-shaman of Tempos―the local name of Tempus―rallied the tribes that remained, and together they turned away the mercenary army. Desperate to to still achieve victory, Arakon conjured a portal and summoned a horde of demons from the lower planes. In order to save his people, and all of Icewind Dale, Jerrod threw himself into the portal, sacrificing his life and preventing the fiends from overwhelming the region.\nLess than a generation later, Kresselack the Black Wolf emerged as a great leader among the barbarian tribes of the dale. He slaughtered many in his own campaign of conquest, but managed to unite the tribes within a single kingdom for a brief time.\nThe collective settlements of the Ten Towns were founded some time during the 11 century DR. Bryn Shander was the first among the towns to attract adventurers, businesspeople, or other folks looking for a second start to their life.\nCirca the , Damien Morienus, a former master of the North Tower of the Host Tower of the Arcane relocated to Icewind Dale. He was a powerful necromancer who was using the local barbarian tribes for his horrific experiments. Eventually, he summoned demons to exact revenge on his enemies. The monsters used their infernal magics to summon hellfire that melted all the snow away. The areas to the Northwest of Ten Towns and the shores of Maer Dualdon suffered the most by floods and permafrosts melting, killing a barbarian tribe, and the inhabitants of the Accursed Tower that sank into the mud. This disaster later became known as the Great Thaw by the locals. Most never learned about the true nature of it believing it to be a natural event. \nthumb|right|300px|The Cryshal Tirith conjured by Belhifet over the village of Easthaven.\nJust over a decade later, in the , the devil Belhifet himself attempted to conquer Icewind Dale. Belhifet had been imprisoned on Toril by the tanarri superiors for punishment regarding a blood feud that threatened to disrupt the infernal hierarchy. Belhifet was contact by the Crenshinibon, a malevolent artifact lost to the ages of time. The Crenshinibon allowed Belhifet to awaken from his icy prison and raise an army to conquer the region. While the fiend managed to briefly freeze over the settlement of Easthaven, he was banished back to Avernus by the intrepid adventurers. \nLater that same year, barbarian lord Wylfdene claimed to be a reincarnation of the famed Uthgardt hero Jerrod. Backed by the claim, and secretly possessed by the vengeful spirit of a white dragon Icasaracht, Wylfdene built an outpost on Bremens Run and guided unite tribes against the Ten Towns who took rightfully barbarian lands. He helmed several battles against the warriors of the Ten Towns and dwarves of Clan Battlehammer until the same group of adventurers arrived to resolve the conflict peacefully. Diplomacy failed and Wylfdene was slain. Despite the fact that Icasarachts possession was unknown to most and forgotten by the history books, the adventurers traveled to the spirits lair and destroyed her.\nYet another monstrous army was raised in Icewind Dale in the , by the children of the fiend Belhifet. The cambions Isair and Madae founded the Legion of the Chimera, a horde of monstrous half-breed creatures that rallied at the Severed Hand fortress. The legion fought a number of battles with the militias of the Ten Towns, and were ultimately vanquished by a group of mercenary adventurers.\nIn , Heafstaag and his group of barbarians fail to conquer the settlement of Termalaine in their massive sweep of the Ten-Towns. In this same year, the Crenshinibon, a powerful magical item lost to the ages, was found by Akar Kessel, an apprentice wizard of the Arcane Brotherhood from Luskan. Over the next few years, Kessel amassed an army of goblinoids, trolls, and giants and allied himself with the demon lord Errtu.\nFive years later, in the , they newly-named \"Tyrant of Icewind Dale\" attempted to conquer all of Icewind Dale. Kessel and his forces were thwarted by the Companions of the Hall adventurers, the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer, and allied folks of the Ten Towns,  in a great conflict known as the Battle of Icewind Dale. The Crenshinibon was destroyed in the battle, and its malevolent demonic magic afflicted the native chardalyn in Icewind Dale.\nSeveral powerful individuals attempted to seize power following the defeat of Akar Kessels army. Notable among them were Jarl Utaar Kelvinsson, a mad beholder called Hagedorn, and even Levistus the Prince of Stygia in the Nine Hells.\nAfter the dwarven fortress of Mithral Hall was reclaimed that same year, several hundred dwarves relocated to the settlements of Icewind Dale.\nthumb|left|300px|Sunblights chardalyn dragon raining destruction upon the people of the Ten Towns.\nA storm in  caused a wave on Lac Dinneshere to destroy the docks of Easthaven and several of its ships, as well as their crews.\nOn Eleint 3 in , corrupted chardalyn—referred to asblack ice―was discovered in Icewind Dale. The substance had a corruptive influence on anyone that handled it or came within close proximity. Soon after, Akar Kessel returned as a lich, and raised hordes of zombified dwarves and began assailing travelers and caravans that crossed the snowy landscape of the realm.\nIn the , Icewind Dale was cursed by the goddess Auril. She plunged the lands into ongoing darkness, preventing the sun from appearing within the sky each morning. Referred to by locals as the Everlasting Rime, this supernatural phenomenon afflicted Icewind Dale for at least two years. Plant life died, animals went into hiding, and food became scared during that time. Tensions rose within dales villages and towns.\nTaking advantage of the darkness that shrouded the realm, a duergar warlord by the name of Xardorok Sunblight raised his own army to conquer Icewind Dale. Like others before him, Xardorok was corrupted the malevolent influence of chardalyn. He managed to forge a giant chardalyn dragon,\nthumb|right|250px|The map of Icewind Dale circa 1347 DR.\nIcewind Dales only permanent settlements were known as the Ten Towns, a confederation of minor settlements that cooperated with each other. The Ten Towns comprised the hamlets nestled on Redwaters lake, Good Mead, and Dougans Hole the three settlements located on the shores of Lac Dinneshere, Easthaven, Caer-Konig, and Caer-Dineval the four that encircled Maer Dualdon, Lonelywood, Bremen, Termalaine, and the walled town of Targos, Shaengarne Ford was a small logging village, southwest from Targos, built on the shores of the Shaengarne River. The settlement of Slow Cedrics Gallop was a small frontier settlement on the Southern Pass of the Spine of the World, overrun and destroyed in 1170 DR.\nAway from Ten Towns, all the way on the northern reaches of the Spine of the World, laid the settlement of Kuldahar. The village was a small group of buildings clustered around the great oak tree, protected from the elements by the Heartstone Gem. Kuldahar had regular trade caravans braving the harsh wilderness to and from Ten Towns.\n* Karkolohk, the goblin fort-settlement nestled within the foothills of the Spine.\n* Revels End, an isolated prison situated far to the north of the dale on a cliff overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice.\n* Black Cabin, a solitary lodge that served as a refuge for many who traveled across the dale.\n* Damiens Tower, the cursed residence of Damien Morienus.\n* Dorns Deep, a dwarven fortress located on a lone peak in the Spine of the World.\n* Jarlmoot, the ancient meeting place of the regions frost giants.\n* Lost Spire of Netheril, a mage tower that was torn asunder from the enclave of Ythryn.\n* Eastway, the only paved road in Icewind Dale linked the hub of Bryn Shander with the communities of Lac Dinneshere.\n* Ten Trail, the wagon trail led north from the settlement of Hundelstone, through the North/South Pass, which allowed merchants and travelers to make their way to Bryn Shander.\nThe region was mainly populated by fishers, craftspeople, loggers, and merchants that tolerated the hostile climate, in the hope of trading in ivory, gems, and other forms of natural wealth.\nWhile most residents of the dale lived in the Ten Towns, the dwarves mined in isolated caves and caverns while the barbarian tribes roamed after their migratory prey.\n* Arveiaturace, the ancient white dragon that claimed part of Icewind Dale as her territory.\n* Hedrun Arnsfirth, the chosen of Auril the Frostmaiden.\n* Markham Southwell, the sheriff of Bryn Shander during circa the late 15 century DR.\n* Ravisin, a local frost druid that spent much of her efforts awakening local animals and plant life.\n* Vaelish Gant, a malevolent abjurer of the Arcane Brotherhood who was imprisoned within Revels End.\nMany bards from the lands to the south confidently told their audiences there was nothing north of the Spine of the World mountains, save for the Endless Ice Sea. They were of course grossly misinformed.\nRumors of various perils regularly circulated throughout the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. Notable among these were rumors that involved an underwater monster that laired within Maer Dualdon, packs of winter wolves that hunted townspeople, and fearsome beasts like the dreaded white moose.\nLocal legend told of the White Lady, a spirit that haunted the shore of Lac Dinneshere."
