Houndstown was a small farming village in Faer√ªn that was menaced by the Skulking Dragon clan of kobolds sometime before the late 14 century DR.
Some years before the , Houndstown and other nearby farming communities started being regularly raided by the Skulking Dragons under the leadership of Sholsarrath the Lame, a kobold warlock, who recently took over the clan. Soon after the plunder began, the Skulking Dragons became hated and feared among the locals. The clans infamy rose so much that a band of traveling adventurers decided to end the kobold menace.
The five adventurers rode out of the village of Houndstown and quickly were able to track the Skulking Dragon clan. The kobolds might have been a nightmare for the local peasantry, but they were naught but pests for weathered adventures, who slaughtered the clans best warriors en masse. The dim-witted warlock, however, was not slain by the adventurers but by Yargulbuzul, his patron, after agreeing to pay for rescue with his own head.
