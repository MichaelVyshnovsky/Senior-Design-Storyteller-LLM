        "mainbody": "yecho was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa. It primarily produced baskets (of poor quality).\nHyecho was a tiny, depressing village. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka, built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\nThe people of Hyecho were, as a rule, hateful individuals and un trusting of outsiders to the point of refusing to accept anyone not from the village through their gates. The village had a population of about 150 individuals after .\nHyecho was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima, north of Fochu, off a spur trail from the Hisano Road.\nVillages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya, typically a minor samurai. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed.\nThe xenophobic citizens of Hyecho refused to trade with anyone from outside their village.\nAbout 15 citizens of Hyecho served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears.\nUnlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Hyecho were not particularly religious.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
