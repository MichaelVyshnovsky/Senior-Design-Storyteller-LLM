        "Description": "The fortress was a remnant of ancient goblin architecture, and by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] had mostly fallen into ruin. The outer walls had largely collapsed, but some of the towers and the main keep remained intact. Most of the tribe lived in the keep's dungeons and in a series of tunnels and caverns beneath it.\n\nUnlike most goblin lairs it was not hidden at all, as the Neidlig were fully confident in their martial strength compared to any of their enemies.",
        "Geography": "The Citadel lay in the [[Goblin Marches]] just north of the [[High Moors]] and west of the [[Stonelands]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The Neidlig were ruled by King [[Srubaash]], and the goblins were joined by various [[hobgoblin]], [[orc]], and [[ogre]] allies."
