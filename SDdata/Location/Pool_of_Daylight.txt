The '''Pool of Daylight''' was a pool of liquid that glowed with [[radiant energy]] as bright as a [[sun]]. It was hidden away in a chamber in the depths of the [[Temple of Filth]] in [[Evernight]] on the [[Shadowfell]].

==Description==
It was said that an immensely powerful [[artifact]] lay within the Pool of Daylight which had the ability to annihilate [[undead]] creatures by the hundreds.

The light of the radiant pool was enough to cause crippling pain to any [[undead]] who entered it chamber. Touching the liquid would instantly destroy lesser undead, including weaker ghouls and [[vampire]]s.

==Defenses==
The Pool was protected by the ghouls of the Temple of Filth, and was locked behind [[curse]]d and trapped doors deep within that Temple. It was kept shrouded by [[ritual]]s of [[darkness]].

==History==
The truth of what lay in the Pool of Daylight was known only to the priests and the [[Tribunal (Evernight)|Tribunal]] of Evernight. They claimed that a powerful artifact was stored there to keep it out of the hands of Evernight's enemies, but also to hold it in reserve if they ever needed a doomsday weapon. As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the mere threat of this artifact was used to dissuade the [[Thayans]] from trying to conquer the city, although this was largely unnecessary because the Thayans were satisfied with their [[Thayan outpost (Evernight)|arrangements within the city]].
