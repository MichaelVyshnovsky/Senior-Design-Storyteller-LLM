The '''Mines of Selgol''' were found in [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. The mines were famed for the high quality [[salt]]. In Samarach, it was thought to be a great insult to give nobles salts of lesser quality than those from the Mines of Selgol.

{{quote|''Tyr's Beard! Although. perhaps that might draw a different crowd into the area, eager for action instead of a quiet tour of the salt mines. I'll make another note of it...''|[[Volothamp Geddarm]] on the firenewt raid}}

==Geography==
The mines were found within the southern arm of the [[Sanrach Mountains]] in eastern Samarach due east of [[Taruin]].

==Activities==
These mines were among the most productive salt mines on the entire Chultan Peninsula. Salt mined here was shipped north and west to the [[Lake of Steam]] and the lands around the [[Shining Sea]] for centuries.

==History==
The mines were first established toward the end of the [[Shoon Imperium]]. Deep miners broke through to the [[Firelands]] in the [[Underdark]] in the {{YearlinkName|572}}. This mistake ushered forth centuries of [[firenewt]] and [[salamander]] marauders overwhelming the mines.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the firenewt threat returned to the Mines of Selgol with a vengeance. A tribe of firenewt, along with their pet [[hell hound]]s, emerged from deep underground and poured into the mines. The raiders were led by the firenewt Overlord [[Flamespar]]. The creatures dragged some screaming miners underground while others barely escaped with their lives. The mine's foreman, [[Essien]], perchance, came across a group of mercenaries while drinking his sorrows away at [[The Broken Pick]] in [[Torich]]. It was unknown if the adventurers agreed to liberate the mines and if they managed to defeat the Overlord, returning the mines to their operational state.
