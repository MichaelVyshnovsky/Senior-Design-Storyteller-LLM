'''Tethkel''' was a series of deep mines, accompanied by a small town, within the northern [[Sunrise Mountains]] in the country of [[Rashemen]]. They were a great source of mineral wealth, rich with [[iron]] ore.

==Inhabitants==
The mines held a small community of [[Rashemi]] miners who were considered among the most undisciplined, wild people of their land. They boasted that their group consumed the greatest amount of ''[[jhuild]]'' within the entire nation.  

The miners exported their goods to the settlements of [[Urling]] and [[Immilmar]] where they were forged into tools, weapons and other goods. 

[[Kobold]]s were known to dig passageways into the mine shafts to conduct raids upon the miners and their operation. [[Goblin]] [[wolf]]-riders and [[winter wolves]] from the [[Endless Wastes]] regularly stalked the outskirts of the town looking for an easy meal.
