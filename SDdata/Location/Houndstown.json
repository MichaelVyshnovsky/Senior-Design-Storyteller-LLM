        "mainbody": "'''Houndstown''' was a small farming village in [[Faerûn]] that was menaced by the [[Skulking Dragon]] clan of [[kobold]]s sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Houndstown and other nearby farming communities started being regularly raided by the Skulking Dragons under the leadership of [[Sholsarrath the Lame]], a kobold [[warlock]], who recently took over the clan. Soon after the plunder began, the Skulking Dragons became hated and feared among the locals. The clan's infamy rose so much that a band of traveling [[adventurer]]s decided to end the kobold menace.\n\nThe five adventurers rode out of the village of Houndstown and quickly were able to track the Skulking Dragon clan. The kobolds might have been a nightmare for the local peasantry, but they were naught but pests for weathered adventures, who slaughtered the clan's best warriors en masse. The dim-witted warlock, however, was not slain by the adventurers but by [[Yargulbuzul]], his patron, after agreeing to pay for rescue with his own head."
