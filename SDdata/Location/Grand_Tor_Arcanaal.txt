The '''Grand Tor Arcanal''', also known as the '''Grand Tor''', was the capital city of the [[Arcanum of Olleth]], a [[magocratic]] [[morkoth]] nation in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Geography==
The Grand Tor was located around the Upper Depths of the Inner Sea, on the lowest level of the [[Lesser Hmur Plateau]]. According to estimates by [[Eadraani]], it was approximately {{SI|50|mile|long=yes}} from the nation of [[Turmish]].

==Description==
Like all settlements of Olleth, the central fixture for which the Grand Tor was named was an impressive [[wizard]]'s tower in which the ruler resided.

==Government==
The Grand Tor Arcanall was the seat of power for the Arcanum of Olleth and was where its ruler, the Grand Arcane, reigned from. The latest in this line of rulers, [[Szyzthus]], was never seen outside his tower.

==Inhabitants==
In addition to morkoth, various enslaved races could be found around the settlement. The bulk of these were largely [[merrow (ogre)|merrow]]s, followed by [[locathah]]s.

==History==
Sometime around {{YearlinkConvert|981|TS}}, the Arcanum of Olleth was founded along with its Nine Towers.

On [[Flamerule 10]], in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a delegation of morkoth from the Grand Tor Arcanaal met with [[Iakhovas]] to receive an offered exchange of slaves in return for the Arcanum of Olleth's aid. While their arrangement called for only thirty [[triton]] slaves, Iakhovas delivered unto them thirty-four as a gesture of good will.<ref>
