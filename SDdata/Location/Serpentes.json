        "History": "Many of the [[human]] cultures inhabiting the regions that would become known as Serpentes were enslaved and transformed into [[histachii]]. Sseth disappeared beneath the Peaks of Flame several centuries after the founding of Serpentes, leading to the kingdom's rapid decline by [[10 DR]]."
