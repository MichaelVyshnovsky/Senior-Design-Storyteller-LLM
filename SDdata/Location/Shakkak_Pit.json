        "Geography": "The Shakkak Pit was a chasm, approximately {{SI|300|foot|long=yes}} deep, in northern Nakvaligach.  It was surrounded by mountains and filled with [[fairy ice]].",
        "Flora & Fauna": "The valley was used by the [[white dragon]]s of the Great Glacier as a graveyard, who instinctively flew there when they knew they were coming to the end of their life. As a result, the chasm was filled with the skeletal remains of thousands of white dragons, as well as any treasure carried by them.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|1059}}, an evil [[anagakok]] with delusions of grandeur tried to [[Animate dead|animate]] the skeletons of the white dragons. He planned on using his army of reanimated white dragon skeletons to attacks the living white dragons within the Nakvaligach and steal their treasure hoards. Unfortunatly for him, the animated skeletons killed him instead. Legend held that some animated skeletons remained within the valley."
