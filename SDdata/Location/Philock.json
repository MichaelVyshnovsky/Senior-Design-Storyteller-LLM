        "mainbody": "Philock was an ancient Netherese city.\nPhilock was found in a large rift located in the center of a massive system of caverns, under the eastern part of the Wood of Sharp Teeth in the Western Heartlands.\nThe buildings of Philock were built through the floor of the canyon and stretched down to the lower reaches of the rift. As of , the former city was in ruins, buried under tons of rubble from the frequent cave-ins and landslides over the centuries. \nSome adventuring parties have attempted to remove reach the buildings of Philock, in an attempt to find ancient Netherese artifacts. Every attempt to excavate the ruins have failed, although a large drow expedition, and their small army of slave labor, had more success than most. However, much of their slaves contracted lungrot after breaching into a stairwell.\nIn , Netherese refugees found Philock."
