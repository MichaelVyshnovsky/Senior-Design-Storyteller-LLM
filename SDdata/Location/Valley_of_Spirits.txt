The '''Valley of Spirits''' was a valley considered to be a taboo among the inhabitants of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the jungles of [[Malatra]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/The Living Jungle|7}}

==Description==
The [[River of Laughing Idols]] ended as it reached the Valley of Spirits, according to the [[Nubari]]. Another river that flushed its waters into the Valley of Spirits was the [[Screaming River]]. It cascaded off the [[Howling Mountains]], flowed into [[Koro Lake]] and ended up crashing into the Valley of Spirits.

The valley remained poorly documented even among the local tribes as it was a dreaded and forbidden region of the jungles. Its edges were marked with taboo totems that warned anyone about the unknown dangers of the mysterious region. The Valley of Spirits itself was a canyon obscured by thick mists. The valley was surrounded by cascading waterfalls that filled the entire area with thick mists. Terrifying screams of unknown alien creatures permeated the air of the valley.

==History==
Once, [[lacerial]]s inhabited the Valley of Spirits after arriving on [[Toril]] from another world. However, in the [[Year of New Peoples]], 1997, an unknown catastrophe hit the valley, forcing lacerials to flee and settle elsewhere.{{Cite living jungle/Inhabitants of the Jungle|13}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Some brane or foolish Nubari youths entered the mysterious valley. Some managed to survive its horrors and return home; however, none of the survivors were willing to share their experiences nor wanted to return to the Valley of Spirits.
