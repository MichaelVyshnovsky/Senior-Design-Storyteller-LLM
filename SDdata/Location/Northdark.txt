The '''Northdark''' was an underground domain of the [[Underdark]] north and east of the city of [[Waterdeep]]. 

==Geography==
The area was home to some of the most renowned subterranean realms of [[Faerûn]] like the [[svirfneblin]] ruins of [[Blingdenstone]], the [[duergar]] deepkingdom of [[Gracklstugh]] and the [[drow]] cities of [[Menzoberranzan]] and [[Ched Nasad]]. Numerous crumbled ancient realms were also found in the Northdark, such as [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]], [[Delzoun]] and [[Netheril]], in the form of [[Skullport]]. The Northdark bordered on the [[Buried Realms]] in the east, meeting it underneath the ruins of [[Ascore]]. Deep within the [[Spine of the World]] many [[orc]] strongholds, [[troll]] caves, and [[giant]] delvings were buried.
