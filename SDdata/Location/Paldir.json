        "Description": "Its shores did not offer much protection from incoming storms. A large mountain dominated the landscape of the island. Gigantic stone reliefs were carved into the cliffs leading up the mountain. Some of these carvings reached a height of {{SI|1000|ft|long=yes}}. They appeared to depict a tale of ancient conquest. Glyphs were found with each of the carvings, though scholars and sages were unable to decipher them through normal or magical means.",
