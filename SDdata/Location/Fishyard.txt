The Fishyard was the bustling central marketplace of Yartar.
It was located immediately in front of the Waterbarons Hall, in the center of several notable shops, inns and other establishments.
The marketplace comprised a large collection of stalls, arranged in what seemed to be an unorganized maze.
Merchants and vendors sold a wide-variety of goods in the Fishyard. Appropriately enough, fresh fish and crustaceans caught in the Three Rivers were always available, even during the freezing winter months.
A number of folks sold baubles and curio from foreign lands including jewelry, potions and even spellcasting components, from as far away as Calimshan or Mulhorand.
