'''Mo'ki''', also written as '''mo'Ki''', was a settlement in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].<ref group="note">Text sources in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' render the name as "mo'Ki", while maps in the book and in ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'' render it as "Mo'ki". The latter name is used in this article for ease of writing and wiki coding.

==Geography==
Mo'ki lay on the eastern coast, facing the [[Straits of Koryo]].

==History==
Mo'ki was once afflicted by the [[ivory plague]] until the [[shukenja]] [[Pitalla]] used the ''[[leaping fish]]'' to cure it. 

Around [[1357 DR]], Mo'ki Bay was dominated by the pirate [[Crow Dz Pong]], who terrorized coastal settlements like Mo'ki.
