        "mainbody": "Mahatsureya was a fishing village in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.\nIt lay on the eastern coast of the kingdom,Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, Mahatsureya has not been labelled on any map of Malatra. This general location is assumed as the Kuong Kingdom has no other apparent coastline. Nearby was the Sanamatra Reef, which made for incredibly good fishing.\nThe fisher-folk had dealings with ningyo and other aquatic beings.\nThere was a temple to the Lords of Creation here, but the prejudiced old nun Ama thought its customs to be suspect and warned travelers not to trust the priests."
