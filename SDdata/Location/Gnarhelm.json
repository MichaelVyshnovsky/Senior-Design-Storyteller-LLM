        "mainbody": "'''Gnarhelm''' was a [[Northlander]] kingdom located in the [[Moonshae Isles]].",
        "Geography": "Gnarhelm was located on the large island of [[Alaron]], north of the [[Fairheight Mountains]]. Gnarhlem was a realm filled with tough terrain. Much of the land was rocky, with steep hills and exposed cliffs. Gnarhelm had more roads and overland travel routes than any other Northlander kingdom.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles}}",
        "Inhabitants": "{{main|Northlander}}\n\nThe human inhabitants of Gnarhelm were Northlanders. They were not as skilled as sailors as other Northlanders, due to the difficulty in sea travel around the kingdom. As a result, they were much more comfortable traveling, and fighting, on land.",
        "Weather": "The climate of Gnarhelm was quite harsh. The realm was often covered in clouds and rain was common. Vicious storms from the [[Trackless Sea]] were common.",
        "Economy": "Gnarhlem was one of the main trading ports of the Northlanders. Merchants from [[Waterdeep]] often docked here, trading [[gold]], oil and liquor for slaves and [[Ffolk]]-crafted weapons. Northlander [[longship]]s sailed from Gnarhelm to both [[Ruathym]] and Waterdeep. Gnarhelm traded with the Ffolk to the south, trading raw materials for alcohol and food.\n\nGnarhlem was a mineral-rich kingdom, and the only Northlander kingdom that had extensive mines. Rich veins of [[copper]], [[gold]], [[iron]] and [[silver]] existed within the realm. Due to the terrain and climate, Gnarhelm had little agricultural output, instead they relied on their mineral wealth to trade for food.",
        "Military": "Gnarhelm had a smaller navy than other Northlander kingdoms, with only a few dozen longships. The kingdom had more [[horse]]s than other Northlander realms and used cavalry as part of their large army. The military of Gnarhelm was capable of dealing with most threats to the realm."
