While it remained whole and intact, only the dome of its grand palace remained visible from the canopy of the Chultan jungle.\nHisari was protected powerful magical ward that repelled yuan-ti from entering within.\nThe city stood at the base of The Crown, the great volcano of the Sky Lizard Mountains,\nThe city was inhabited by yuan-ti, many of whom relocated to Omu at some point.\nSome time during the late 14 century, around the time of the Spellplague, Hisari was swallowed into the earth beneath Chult.\nAround half a century later, a brood of yuan-ti relocated from Hisari to the lost, Forbidden City of Omu, to freely worship their goddess, Dendar the Night Serpent.
