From what Majida says, it's still intact, just buried. Did you see the ruins when you were on top of the waterfall?|[[Zo]], leader of the Dwarves of the Domain.}}",
        "Description": "Hisari was a grand city, comprising numerous golden-domed structures made of white-washed bricks. Elevated roads and walkways allowed for travel and conveyance throughout its winding streets. Buildings in the city were decorated with elaborate mosaics, depicting the subjugation of various peoples at the hands of the sarrukh and other [[serpentfolk]].\n\nThe city was built above the jungle floor, but in its history was pulled into an underground cavern, and overgrown with vines and other vegetation. While it remained whole and intact, only the dome of its grand palace remained visible from the canopy of the Chultan jungle.\n\nHisari was protected powerful magical ''[[ward]]'' that ''[[antipathy/sympathy|repelled]]'' yuan-ti from entering within.",
        "Location": "The city stood at the base of [[The Crown]], the great volcano of the [[Sky Lizard Mountains]],",
        "Inhabitants": "* [[Shristisanti]], the ancient sarrukh who served as the eternal guardian of ''the Atrocity''.",
        "History": "Some time during the late 14{{th}} century, around the time of the [[Spellplague]], Hisari was swallowed into the earth beneath Chult.\n\nAround half a century later, a brood of yuan-ti relocated from Hisari to the lost, Forbidden City of [[Omu]], to freely worship their goddess, [[Dendar]] the Night Serpent. Packs of [[nifern]]s still roamed the city's streets even after the yuan-ti left.\n\nDecades later, in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a group of [[adventurer]]s led by [[Harp Levesque]] broke into the palace of Hisari, slew its guardian, and stole the [[artifact]] safeguarded within.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Palace of Hisari]], the resting place of the artifact known to the yuan-ti as ''[[the Atrocity]]''."
