        "mainbody": "Beldenshyn, nicknamed \"the Bell\" and derogatorily called \"Goatreek\" and \"the Goatstink\", was a gnome village in the Fields of the Dead, circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nBeldenshyn was located west of Trollclaw Ford on the south side of the Winding Water on the southernmost curve of that river.\nBeldenshyn was among the locations linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists.\nThis community manufactured and sold crossbows and bolts. The village had a tin mine run by  General Manager of the Jannath mines, Skalgarrad, until it was depleted in 1492 DR.\nThe village was surrounded by a stockade, and the residents were sure-shots with crossbows.\nthumb|right|272px|One of the four-legged denizens of Beldenshyn.\nThe residents of Beldenshyn raised long-haired goats that grazed around the village, both inside and outside the walls. Unfortunately, these hirsute ungulates had an odor that most humans found disgusting, thus giving the village the disparaging nicknames that were bandied about in places like Scornubel."
