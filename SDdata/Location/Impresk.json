        "Description": "Impresk was the barony responsible for ensuring that the monster population of the Snowflake Mountains remained low and defending the trade road to [[Riatavin]].\n\nThe barony was inhabited by many \"hill clans\" and contained several farming villages, a few logging and shepherding towns in the foothills, and a single mining town.",
        "Geography": "Impresk Barony was the northernmost of Erlkazar's five baronies. It bordered [[Carrelath]] and [[Shalanar]] to the south. [[Shilmista]], the Forest of Shadows, was its western border, and [[Impresk Lake]] was located at the southeast edge.",
        "Government": "The leader of Impresk, as of 1370 DR, was Baron [[Jivam Tammsel]], who, oddly enough, was a [[Half-dragon|half-]][[steel dragon]] [[ranger]]. He was selected by the hill clans to lead despite his draconic heritage. \n\nAs of 1479 DR, the Day Baron of Impresk was Tolarran, who was described as youthful and ambitious.",
