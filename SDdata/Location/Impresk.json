        "mainbody": "mpresk was a barony of the monarchy of Erlkazar, which encompassed the territory of the Snowflake Mountains.\nImpresk was the barony responsible for ensuring that the monster population of the Snowflake Mountains remained low and defending the trade road to Riatavin.\nThe barony was inhabited by many \"hill clans\" and contained several farming villages, a few logging and shepherding towns in the foothills, and a single mining town.\nImpresk Barony was the northernmost of Erlkazars five baronies. It bordered Carrelath and Shalanar to the south. Shilmista, the Forest of Shadows, was its western border, and Impresk Lake was located at the southeast edge.\nThe leader of Impresk, as of 1370 DR, was Baron Jivam Tammsel, who, oddly enough, was a half-steel dragon ranger.
