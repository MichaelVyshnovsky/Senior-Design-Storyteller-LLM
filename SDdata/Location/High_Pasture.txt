'''High Pasture''' was a set of ruins near the village of [[Volkumburgh]].

==Description==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] these ruins had fallen into such a state of disrepair that it was difficult to ascertain what it once was. It could have been either a barn or some workshop.

==Geography==
These ruins were located in the [[Volkumburgh Vale]], northeast of the village of the same name and the residents of its inhabitants [[Clemon]] and [[Wistkins]].

==History==
This area became a ruin in the mid-12{{th}} century DR, when the [[devil]]-possessed [[stone golem]] known as [[Awtawmatawn]] rampaged throughout Volkumburgh Vale.<ref group="note" name="Year">An exact date for these past events are never given in the ''[[The Shattered Statue]]'', but ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' dates [[Proster Obarskyr|King Proster]]'s reign as lasting from [[1122 DR]] – [[1164 DR]].

In [[1358 DR]],<ref group="note" name="PresentYear">'''The explanation for this date is divided into three points:'''<br />'''(1)''' Page 16 of ''The Shattered Statue'' (February, 1988) describes the destruction of [[Phlan]] by [[dragon]]s as having occurred "several years ago." Since the conflict "[[Dragon Run]]" did not exist until ''[[The Moonsea]]'', this has to be referring to the [[Flight of the Dragon]] ([[1356 DR]]), which was introduced in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]''.<br />'''(2)''' ''[[The Savage Frontier]]'' (August, 1988), is set in [[1358 DR]] and has [[Amelior Amanitas]] refer to its events in past tense.<br />'''(3)''' Page 18 of ''The Shattered Statue'' describes the [[Cult of the Dragon]] as having long had no presence in [[Volkumburgh Vale]], but ''[[TSR Jam 1999]]'' has the cult re-establishing themselves there in [[1359 DR]].<br />'''Conclusion:''' All together, this info suggests that ''The Shattered Statue'' takes place in 1358 DR. in the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]] some time prior to the [[Feast of the Moon]], the Volkumburgh shepherd [[Deker]] was clearing out these ruins in hopes of constructing a new barn. While doing so one of his [[sheep]] walked up to and bit a ''[[runestick]]'' that made it seemingly disappear. Later on a group of [[adventurer]]s seeking out the scattered remains of the Awtawmatawn on behalf of [[Amelior Amanitas]] came to enquire about this incident and found that the ''runestick'' acted as a two-way ''[[portal]]'' to another ''runestick'' near the ruins of the [[College of Rune Magics]].
