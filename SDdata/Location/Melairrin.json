        "mainbody": "'''Melairrin''' was an ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] citadel that sat in the heart of [[Mount Sar]] in the [[Sword Mountains]] north of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}",
        "Description": "The ancient dwarfhold was long abandoned, and consisted of both a citadel and adjoining caverns. It connected to the exterior of Mount Sar via western tunnels that led through the abode of the [[frost giant]] [[Harshnag]], a member of the [[Gray Hands]]. although reports differed as to whether this was a one- or two-way gateway.",
        "History": "The fortress was claimed by the [[orc]]s of [[Uruth Ukrypt]] shortly after the founding of their realm in the {{YearlinkName|927}}, and provided them a secure base from which to wage wars on the surrounding [[human]] and [[gnome]] settlements of the [[Sword Coast North]] and [[Dessarin Valley]]. It also served as the seat of the realm's political power where the ''[[Bloodbone Throne of Uruth]]'' was kept.{{Cite dragon/351/Volo's Guide: Lost Regalia of the North: The Toppled Thrones|73}}\n\nDuring the [[Rage of Dragons]] in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, the [[black dragon]] [[Shammagar]] attacked Melairrin and claimed it from the orcs as his lair. Wary of further thefts, Shammagar abandoned the citadel to seek more remote lairs in the middle of the [[Trackless Sea]] and to take revenge on Asilther.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Melairrin was home to a variety of monsters that had arrived from the caverns of the [[Underdark]] beneath it, as well as to bands of [[half-dragon]] orcs believed to be descended from Shammagar. The deepest depths of the fortress hosted the lair of [[Rorrina Stoneshaft]], a dwarven [[vampire]] who served [[Artor Morlin]] of Waterdeep."
