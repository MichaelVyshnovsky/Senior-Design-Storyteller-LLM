It connected to the exterior of Mount Sar via western tunnels that led through the abode of the frost giant Harshnag, a member of the Gray Hands. although reports differed as to whether this was a one- or two-way gateway.\nThe fortress was claimed by the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt shortly after the founding of their realm in the , and provided them a secure base from which to wage wars on the surrounding human and gnome settlements of the Sword Coast North and Dessarin Valley. It also served as the seat of the realms political power where the Bloodbone Throne of Uruth was kept.\nDuring the Rage of Dragons in the , the black dragon Shammagar attacked Melairrin and claimed it from the orcs as his lair. Wary of further thefts, Shammagar abandoned the citadel to seek more remote lairs in the middle of the Trackless Sea and to take revenge on Asilther.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Melairrin was home to a variety of monsters that had arrived from the caverns of the Underdark beneath it, as well as to bands of half-dragon orcs believed to be descended from Shammagar.
