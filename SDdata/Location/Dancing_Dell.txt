The Dancing Dell was a dell containing the Ladystone, a sacred stone touched by Eilistraee. The stone was very old, possibly dating back as far as the early settlements of Ardeep.
The dell was a smooth bowl-shaped valley filled with moss, ferns, and grasses,
The Ladystones power guarded the dell and could strike out at intruders at the will of the goddess or her priestesses.
Qilue Veladorn sometimes lead worship at the Ladystone.
It was said that Eilistraee had manifested in the dell more than once.
