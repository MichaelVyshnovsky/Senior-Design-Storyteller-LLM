        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, the Thistledown family were found gruesomely murdered in their house and barn. The culprit was believed to be the [[drow]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], owing to the presence of his [[scimitar]] at the scene. However, the true culprit was [[Ulgulu]] the [[barghest]]. Drizzt avenged the Thistledowns by slaying Ulgulu, but despite the belief of [[Dove Falconhand]] and her band that Drizzt was innocent, [[Roddy McGristle]] continued to pursue Drizzt and defame his name for years and across many borders.",
