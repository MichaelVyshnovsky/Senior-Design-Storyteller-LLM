        "Description": "River Tesh moved across downslope across many gorges of the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]] and formed the river's [[Tesh Valley]].\n\nArntethyl held a supply encampment of the [[Zhentarim]] that supported the Black Network's activities in the great dessert of [[Anauroch]].",
        "History": "The encampment also held Zhentish troops that could be used as reinforcements across the region. The valley held at least a thousand Zhentish [[warrior]]s and twenty [[wizard]]s ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. During that time, the troops were led by the mage named [[Ruatheene]], a [[Manshoon]]'s favored, and her massive and powerful [[beholder]] [[Araunglauth]]. The beholder called the valley of Arntethyl its home for seventy years prior."
