        "mainbody": "Baomal was the capital city of Hmurrath, a merfolk empire on the Hmur Plateau beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nBaomal fell to ruin after the fall of the Hmurrath empire in .Its erroneously stated on page 139 that Hmurrath somehow both fell in  and during the Fifth Ser么s War, both unrelated to the Hmurrath Civil Wars that were the Tenth Ser么s War. Because of this, the end date of the Tenth Ser么s War can be considered the more accurate one. Over the years various scavengers and engineers from farms or villages in the surrounding area would pick away at the citys coral and stone structures, seeking to repurpose the materials for their own settlements. By , very little of the once proud capital remained as a result of this practice."
