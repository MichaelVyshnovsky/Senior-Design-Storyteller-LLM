The '''Demon Pit''' was a seemingly bottomless chasm in the city of [[Evernight]] in the [[Shadowfell]]. It existed in the same location as the [[Neverwinter/Chasm|Chasm]] in Evernight's twin, [[Neverwinter]].

==Description==
The Demon Pit was slightly smaller than the Chasm on the [[Material Plane]]. It exuded powerful [[necromantic]] energies, even by the standards of the Shadowfell. The air was colder, lights were dimmer, and [[undead]] were drawn to the land around the Pit. This power left the living feeling fatigued while undead were empowered.

==History==
When the Chasm opened in Neverwinter during the [[Ruining]], this reflection of it appeared in Evernight. The city's [[ghoul]]s and [[vampire]]s could not explain the seemingly bottomless crack that had appeared in their city, and dubbed it the "Demon Pit" because they believed it led to the [[Abyss]], specifically the [[White Kingdom]] of [[Doresain]]. As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, no one had managed to descend into the Pit and return to confirm or deny this belief. Nevertheless, this did not stop Evernight's faithful of Doresain and [[Orcus]] from throwing living creatures into the Demon Pit as sacrifices.
