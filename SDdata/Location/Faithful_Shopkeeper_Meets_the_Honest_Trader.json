        "Description": "The statue was in the [[Lower City]], very nearby the pier of the [[Counting House]].",
        "History": "In [[1482 DR]], the hand of this statue, as well as others, was severed. [[Rilsa Rael]] had her thieves commit this act, whilst a group of patriar youths did the same to the [[Beloved Ranger]], a well-known statue. All but those of the [[Outer City]] were outraged, and the [[Flaming Fist]] conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up. [[Horgold Hadru]] took in the noble youths who had actually vandalised the Beloved Ranger, as he owed one of the patriar families."
