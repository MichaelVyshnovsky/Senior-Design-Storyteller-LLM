The Shannyth Forest was a woodland found on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
The Shannyth Forest was located in southwest Moray. It was bordered on the south by the Orcskull Mountains, on the east by the Shannyth River, and on the west by the Trackless Sea. One of two moonwells on Moray was found within the Shannyth Forest. The forest covered roughly .
The villagers from nearby Farview harvested timber from the forest to construct fine longships. Lycanthropes from the Black Blood Tribe were drawn to the forest with the hopes of polluting the moonwell with live sacrifices. However, the equally savage northlanders of Farview were often more than a match for the lycanthropes, leaving the forest littered with corpses from both sides.
