'''Mount Plutoq''' was the mountain that bore the name of the [[Maztican]] deity [[Plutoq]], the Master of Earth and Stone.

==Description==
The mountain separated two nations of Maztica, [[Kultaka]] to the west, and [[Pezelac]] to the southeast. Mount Plutoq's northern edge touched the waters of the [[Gulf of Kultaka]] and the larger body of water – the [[Gulf of Cordell]]. The northeastern slopes of the mountain was covered in the jungles that stretched from the Gulf of Cordell to the Pezelac town of [[Palenqi‎]], while its northeastern side was a swampland. Kultaka's biggest city, [[Kultaka City]], stood on the arable land west of Mount Plutoq. The mountain chain that ended with Mount Plutoq to the south, ran further north, ending in [[Mount Popol]] and [[Mount Zatal]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, several trade ships from [[Waterdeep]] were denied entrance to the harbors of [[Helmsport]]. The ships continued moving north, past Mount Plutoq, visible from afar, and eventually, landed on the northern shores of the Gulf of Kultak, founding the [[New Waterdeep]] colony.
