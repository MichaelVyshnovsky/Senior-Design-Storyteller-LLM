Mount Plutoq was the mountain that bore the name of the Maztican deity Plutoq, the Master of Earth and Stone.
The mountain separated two nations of Maztica, Kultaka to the west, and Pezelac to the southeast. Mount Plutoqs northern edge touched the waters of the Gulf of Kultaka and the larger body of water – the Gulf of Cordell. The northeastern slopes of the mountain was covered in the jungles that stretched from the Gulf of Cordell to the Pezelac town of Palenqi‎, while its northeastern side was a swampland. Kultakas biggest city, Kultaka City, stood on the arable land west of Mount Plutoq. The mountain chain that ended with Mount Plutoq to the south, ran further north, ending in Mount Popol and Mount Zatal.
In the , several trade ships from Waterdeep were denied entrance to the harbors of Helmsport. The ships continued moving north, past Mount Plutoq, visible from afar, and eventually, landed on the northern shores of the Gulf of Kultak, founding the New Waterdeep colony.
