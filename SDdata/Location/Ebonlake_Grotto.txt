Ebonlake Grotto was a myconid colony found in the Underdark, beneath the region of the Sword Coast.
The settlement featured large fungal growths that formed massive platforms and winding pathways. A large waterfall poured over the center of the grotto, filling a small pool at its base.
Timmask mushrooms were among the species that grew within and around the grotto.
The myconids of the grotto were led by Sovereign Spaw.
While the myconids of Ebonlake Grotto did not themselves trade or barter with travelers, they did allow some surface-dwellers and other humanoids into their domain. Notable among these were two scholars from the Society of Brilliance.
The myconids of this colony raised their slain foes as spore servants, zombie-like husks that were animated by fungus itself. Husks of various underdark creatures, including duergar and hook horrors roamed the paths of the grotto as silent sentinels, ready to slay their former allies.
Some time in the , duergar aligned with the cult of the Absolute raided the myconids of Ebonlake Grotto and slew many of their young. Sovereign Spaw and the myconids killed many of the invaders but their thirst for revenge was not satiated.
