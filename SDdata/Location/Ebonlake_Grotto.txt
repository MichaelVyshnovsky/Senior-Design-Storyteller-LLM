'''Ebonlake Grotto''' was a [[myconid]] colony found in the [[Underdark]], beneath the region of the [[Sword Coast]].

==Description==
The settlement featured large fungal growths that formed massive platforms and winding pathways. A large waterfall poured over the center of the grotto, filling a small pool at its base.

==Geography==
===Flora & Fauna===
[[Timmask]] mushrooms were among the species that grew within and around the grotto.

==Government==
The myconids of the grotto were led by Sovereign [[Spaw]].

==Trade==
While the myconids of Ebonlake Grotto did not themselves trade or barter with travelers, they did allow some surface-dwellers and other [[humanoid]]s into their domain. Notable among these were two scholars from the [[Society of Brilliance]].

==Defenses==
The myconids of this colony raised their slain foes as [[spore servant]]s, [[zombie]]-like husks that were animated by fungus itself. Husks of various underdark creatures, including [[duergar]] and [[hook horror]]s roamed the paths of the grotto as silent sentinels, ready to slay their former allies.

==History==
Some time in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, duergar aligned with the [[cult of the Absolute]] raided the myconids of Ebonlake Grotto and slew many of their young. Sovereign Spaw and the myconids killed many of the invaders but their thirst for revenge was not satiated.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Blurg]], a particularly erudite [[orog]] who spent his time studying all manner of flora and fauna in he Underdark.
* [[Omeluum]], Blurg's [[mind flayer]] comrade and fellow intellectual.
* [[Derryth Bonecloak]], a [[dwarf]] woman from [[Baldur's Gate]] who stayed at the grotto for a time while searching for her husband [[Baelen Bonecloak|Baelen]].
* [[Thulla]], a [[svirfneblin]] woman who was injured by the duergar that raided the grotto and remained stranded in the colony, nursing her injuries.
