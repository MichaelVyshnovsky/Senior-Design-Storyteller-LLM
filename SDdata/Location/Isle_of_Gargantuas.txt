The '''Isle of Gargantuas''' was one of the [[Outer Isles]] of [[Wa]] in [[Kara-Tur]] and home to gigantic monsters, called [[gargantua]]s.

==Description==
The island was often rent by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which devastated the landscape.

==History==
Around [[1347 DR|Wa Year 1765 (1347 DR)]], two [[krakentua]] had a titanic battle with more powerful spirits of the ocean. Badly wounded, they escaped to the Isle of Gargantuas to heal and recuperate. [[krakentua (Isle of Gargantuas)|One krakentua]] stayed to rule the island and its monsters by [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]],Using very similar wording, ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' page 180 and ''[[Test of the Samurai]]'' page 58 give the exact same event at around the same time for krakentua with designs on southern Wa, apparently implying it to be the same being. However, the former krakentua is male, while the latter is female, so here they are assumed to be separate beings. Taken together, it appears the two krakentua were companions before going separate ways.

Around [[1358 DR|Wa Year 1776 (1358 DR)]], the second krakentua would inflict a vision of a battle on the Isle of Gargantuas on adventurers who visited her at [[Shinkintin]].

==Inhabitants==
The [[insectoid gargantua|insectoid]] and [[reptilian gargantua]]s battled each other relentlessly. There were also [[humanoid gargantua]]s, who also got in on the action.

They were ruled over by a krakentua, who contented himself with watching their never-ending conflicts and developed a plan to recruit and train an army of gargantuas and attack southern Wa.

==Wildlife==
The rare and prized [[blue mandarin duck]] could be found on the Isle of Gargantuas, among other inconveniently hazardous locales.
