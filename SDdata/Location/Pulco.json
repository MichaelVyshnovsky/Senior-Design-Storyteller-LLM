        "mainbody": "Nexal\nPulco was the central city-state of the Huacli, the nation immediately west of the aggressive Nexala people.\nThe city-state of Pulco was built in a green valley between two mountain chains that stood parallel to eachother to the east and west of the settlement. The closest Huacli neighboring towns were Azcat to the southwest and Ixtal to the southeast.\nDuring the reign of Ipana III of Nexal, the bloodthirsty empire was not satisfied with feeding its vicious god of war Zaltec through Feathered Wars. After taking control of all city-states within the Valley of Nexal, Ipana III set his sight on neighboring settlements. After swallowing Cordotl and Palul, Nexala emissaries were sent to Pulco. The city-state was conquered through inducements, bribes, and threats, resulting in it willingly joining the Nexal empire. The rest of Huacli suffered for the next decade bloody raids of pillaging and eventual conquest.\nAs Nexal fell under the swords of the invading Golden Legion of Amn in the , and Bloody Zaltec was defeated by returned deity Qotal, the fate of Pulco remained unrecorded."
