        "Description": "The city-state of Pulco was built in a green valley between two mountain chains that stood parallel to eachother to the east and west of the settlement. The closest Huacli neighboring towns were [[Azcat]] to the southwest and [[Ixtal]] to the southeast.",
        "History": "During the reign of [[Ipana III]] of Nexal, the bloodthirsty empire was not satisfied with feeding its vicious god of war [[Zaltec]] through [[Feathered War]]s. After taking control of all city-states within the [[Valley of Nexal]], Ipana III set his sight on neighboring settlements. After swallowing [[Cordotl]] and [[Palul]], Nexala emissaries were sent to Pulco. The city-state was conquered through inducements, bribes, and threats, resulting in it willingly joining the Nexal empire. The rest of Huacli suffered for the next decade bloody raids of pillaging and eventual conquest.\n\nAs Nexal fell under the swords of the invading [[Golden Legion]] of [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, and Bloody Zaltec was defeated by returned deity [[Qotal]], the fate of Pulco remained unrecorded."
