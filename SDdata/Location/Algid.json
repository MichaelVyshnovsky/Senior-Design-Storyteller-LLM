        "Geography": "Algid was situated on the southern coast of the Hidden Lake, between the [[Southfill River]] and [[Tarn River]].",
        "History": "Algid was built by thirty workers in {{YearlinkConvert|1222|NY}}, and grew very slowly until {{YearlinkConvert|2356|NY}}, when it reached a peak population of one thousand inhabitants, firmly remaining a sleepy fishing village. During the [[Age of Discovery]], the talented [[arcanist]], Lady [[Polaris]], approached the townsfolk and offered them [[enclave]] status. However, the residents much preferred being part of [[Low Netheril]], and thus refused the arcanist's offer.\n\nDuring the [[Shadowed Age]], the inhabitants began to increase their usage of [[magic]]. Some of the residents became very skilled in [[the Art]], and even used [[spell]]s such as ''[[levitate|Yturn's levitation]]'' and ''[[Tolodine's gust of wind]]'' in order to create magical [[airship]]s to patrol Hidden Lake. In {{YearlinkConvert|3374|NY}}, Algid was destroyed by the [[phaerimm]], leaving barely any alive. Those who did survive were offered residency in nearby settlements."
