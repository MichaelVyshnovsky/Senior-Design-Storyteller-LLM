        "mainbody": "Brannoch was a small town located on the island of Snowdown within the Moonshae Isles.\nBrannoch was located in eastern Snowdown along the coast of the Sea of Swords. Brannoch was unique among Snowdowns settlments in that it was the only one not connected to Snowdown Ride. This was largely because the marsh of Maloren Sods separated the town from the rest of the island, making constructing a road to Brannoch nearly impossible."
