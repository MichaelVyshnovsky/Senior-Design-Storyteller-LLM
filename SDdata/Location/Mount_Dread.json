        "mainbody": "Mount Dread was an underground complex near Shadowdale. By the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it was a monster lair once used by the evil mage Azazabus.\nThe dungeon was near Shadowdale.\nPresumably, Mount Dread mustve been in a mountainous region.\nOf note, the most immediately accessible level contained a small underground tower-like structure, where a wall once held a ladder to a higher level that level had since collapsed, leaving the ladder a path to nowhere. One room in the same level was an old prison, and a room used by orcs.\nThe lower levels layout wasnt known, but it included an old library, a paper-walled room made by giant wasps, and a mine shaft.\nPart of the lower level connected to an old mineshaft, strongly implying the location was originally a mine.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Mount Dread was the lair of numerous monsters that attacked locals near Shadowdale, making local authorities call for adventurers the same heroes who braved the Tomb of Damara and Harrow Hill mightve been among them. Before that, Mount Dread had been the center of activities once for the evil mage Azazabus.\nAs they progressed into the dungeon, they mightve encountered a gnome, Tinker, who needed a special silver spring for a certain, secret project. They may also have come across a number of gnomes who were looking for a special glowing moss there, which they required for a catapult meant for their king. Another mage, Kordak, couldve come across them. Hed have tried to charm them or otherwise make them kill a brown bear that had taken up residence nearby, before trying to kill them.\nShould they have pushed into the lower level, they may have chanced upon a lammasu also took temporary shelter there to examine an old library, and a duergar called Axerock, whose treasure was stolen by drow.\n* Kordak\n* Axerock"
