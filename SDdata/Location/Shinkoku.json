        "Description": "Kozakura's primary island stretched {{SI|1400|mi|k|long=yes}} from one tip to the other, and featured a remarkable range of landscapes. Its width fluctuated from a broad {{SI|350|mi|k|long=yes}} at its widest point to a narrow {{SI|70|mi|k|long=yes}} at [[Miyama Province]].\n\nA prominent mountain range, known as the [[Dragon's Spine]], traversed the length of Shinkoku. Legends spoke of a mighty [[Li lung|earth dragon]] slumbering beneath the land of Kozakura.",
        "Inhabitants": "Shinkoku boasted the largest population in Kozakura, serving as the epicenter of political intrigue and the primary rice-producing island in the country. It stood as the heart of Kozakuran culture and civilization. Coastal regions were predominantly inhabited by fishermen, while the valleys along the coast were home to rice farmers.\n\nHowever, beyond the realms of human politics and loyalties, lurked nonhuman creatures within the untamed mountain wilderness of Shinkoku. Indifferent to human affairs, they pursued their own interests, encroaching upon human territories, and engaging in both hostile attacks and unexpected cooperation as they deem fit.",
        "Climate": "The northern region of Shinkoku experienced cold, snow-filled winters, adorned with pine forests. In contrast, the southern end endured humid summers, enveloped by dense [[bamboo]] rainforests."
