        "mainbody": "The '''High Walk''' was a dangerous foot trail though the [[Galena Mountains]] between [[Vaasa]] and [[Damara]]. It was one of the only paths through those mountains aside from [[Bloodstone Pass]] that warranted being named and remembered.",
        "Description": "Dominated by sheer cliff faces, boulder-filled canyons, and populated by deadly monsters, the High Walk was not to be traveled by the weak.\n\nThe tight confines of the pass meant travel by [[wagon]] was impossible. Those who braved the trail preferred [[mule]]s over [[horse]]s to navigate the dangerous rocky terrain.",
        "Geography": "The trail leading through the High Walk originated on the Vaasan side in [[Palischuk]]. From there it headed north and east though the Vaasan lowlands along the slopes of the Galenas until it reached the High Walk Pass, where it turned southwards. It threaded through the mountains until reaching [[Ironspur]] in the Damaran [[Soravia|Duchy of Soravia]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}",
        "History": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century, the High Walk was used primary by [[half-orcs]] from Palischuk who wished to trade with the [[dwarves]] of Ironspur. Approximately one-in-ten travelers along the High Walk never made it through the mountains alive.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century, the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] had sealed Bloodstone Pass, the primary route through the Galenas.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}. This forced traders to look for alternative means by which to cross the mountains, such as the High Walk.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}}"
