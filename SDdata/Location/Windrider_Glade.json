        "mainbody": "The '''Windrider Glade''' was a public park of [[Myth Drannor]] positioned on the raised platform in the center of the city with winding elevated walkways that connected it to neighboring areas. The park housed a number of shrines that were centered around an open-air <span>Temple of [[Shaundakul]]</span>.",
        "Geography": "Windrider Glade was built at the even distance between the [[Castle Cormanthor]], the [[House of Gems]], and the [[Speculum]]. The park was dedicated to the ideals of peace and diversity of religion, which was evident from the variety of shrines and temples surrounding it.\n\nThe [[Weeping War]] reigned destruction in the park due to its location. The ruins of the Windrider Glade were littered with toppled spires, destroyed buildings, and collapsed walkways.\n\nA winding walkway to the [[Speculum Grounds]] could be accessed from the Glade's south-east and a path to [[Glim-Gardens]] further east. A drawbridge located in the north-western part of the Glade led to [[Stillwater Ruins]]. An entrance to the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]' Halls of Light could be found among the ruins to the west from Shaundakul's temple, right under one of the ''spinning spires'' connected to the ''Orrery'' in Speculum Grounds.\n\nTwo more walkways ending in a drawbridge in the eastern part of the park led to Castle Cormanthor, with one of them being destroyed by 1369 DR.",
        "History": "Following the Weeping War, only one structure in the Glade remained relatively undamaged by the chaos and time, the Temple of Shaundakul. A long line of [[guardian naga]]s was partially responsible for the temple's structure's longevity.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]] the temple still stood in the Windrider Glade but the corrupting influence of the resurgent ''[[pool of radiance]]'' spread through the area, making it more dangerous than ever. The group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] aided the guardian nagas in cleansing the shrines from the ''pool's'' influence.",
        "Inhabitants": "In 1369 DR, [[Obelinde]] led her fellow guardian nagas that protected the Windrider Glade and the <span>Temple of Shaundakul</span>.\n\n[[Orc]]s and [[orogs]] that scavenged the ruins were present at the Windrider Glade preventing the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s expansion into the area.\n\nSome of [[Durren Strongshatter]]'s peaceful [[gargoyle]]s could be found hunting for [[gems]] in the Windrider Glade, along with their more aggressive gargoyle and [[argoyle|margoyle]] kin led by [[Tusk-Lord]]."
