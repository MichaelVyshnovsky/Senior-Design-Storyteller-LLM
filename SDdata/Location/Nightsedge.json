        "Geography": "The village sat along the northern bank of the [[Neverwinter River]] and at the western edge of the [[Neverwinter Wood]]. It neighbored the small town of [[Floodblest]] on the opposite bank of the river.",

        "History": "''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], Nightsedge was beset by frequent [[orc]] attacks. These orcs were not from the [[Trollmoors]] as were typically roamed this region, but came from somewhere else. Worried and overwhelmed, the Lord Mayor of Nightsedge appealed for aid to [[Nasher Alagondar|Lord Nasher]] of Neverwinter, who put out a call for [[adventurer]]s to go to Nightsedge and lend themselves to its defense."
