        "mainbody": "ightsedge was a small village located east of the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North.\nThe village sat along the northern bank of the Neverwinter River and at the western edge of the Neverwinter Wood. It neighbored the small town of Floodblest on the opposite bank of the river.\nIts place on the border of the Neverwinter Wood meant Nightsedge was often faced with danger.\nCirca 1357 DR, Nightsedge was beset by frequent orc attacks. These orcs were not from the Trollmoors as were typically roamed this region, but came from somewhere else. Worried and overwhelmed, the Lord Mayor of Nightsedge appealed for aid to Lord Nasher of Neverwinter, who put out a call for adventurers to go to Nightsedge and lend themselves to its defense."
