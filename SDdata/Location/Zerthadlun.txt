Zerthadlun, also known as ZerthAdLun, was a githzerai monastery and city in Limbo in the Great Wheel cosmology or in the Elemental Chaos in the World Axis cosmology.
The monastery taught the art of zerthin, or zerthi, in which monks were said to be able to peer into the future.
Over time, the monastery became the city of Zerthadlun, which was the largest of all githzerai cities.
