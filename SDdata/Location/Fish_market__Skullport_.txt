The '''Fish Market''' was a open-air market located in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]].

==Description==
This small section of the Lower Port was dedicated to the sale of various seafood, including [[fish]], [[mussel]]s, and [[shellfish]]. Some of the delicacies were imported from the Lands Above, packed in ice or preserved in magical cooling chests, while others were sourced locally from the [[River Sargauth]]. To attract potential buyers, some fish were artfully displayed on beds of ice, while others were kept alive in [[bucket]]s and containers filled with seawater or river water to ensure freshness at the point of sale. Despite these efforts, spoilage was common, and encounters with tainted seafood was a frequent and unfortunate souvenir for visitors to the market.

==Defenses==
The overpowering odor of fish, particularly from those being prepared and filleted, was often so strong that it attracted scavengers from the neighboring areas of [[Undermountain]]. To safeguard the market's stock, two to four mercenaries were stationed nearby, clad in [[studded leather]] armor and armed with [[spear]]s. These guards were tasked with driving away or eliminating the occasional [[scrag]] that was drawn to the scent of the market's wares.
