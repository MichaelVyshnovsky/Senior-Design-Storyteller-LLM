        "mainbody": "'''Parnast''' was a small village in the [[Savage Frontier]] region of [[the North]]. It had a long history of being controlled by less-than-reputable organizations, such as the [[Zhentarim]]",
        "Description": "{{Quote|The problem in [[Llorkh]] was that he got lost and asked the wrong person for help. Parnast's smaller. There's only one street, one stable, one tav–.|The [[mage]] [[Galimer|Galimer \"Longfingers\"]], before being interrupted.}}\n\nParnast comprised a central town square, around which were built several dozen simple structures, built within a wooden palisade.{{Cite adventurers league/Uninvited Guests|8}} The wary{{Cite adventurers league/The Black Road|16}} and hardworking Parnasters earned their living as farmers,\n\nAfter Zhentarim influence in Parnast waned, the area in town around the group's old chapterhouse came to be known as ''Old Parnast''. Parnasters moved some ways south outside the walled portion of town.{{Cite adventurers league/Uninvited Guests|8}}",
        "Geography": "Parnast stood on the [[Dawn Pass Trail]] in the foothills of the [[Greypeak Mountains]],{{Cite adventurers league/Uninvited Guests|6}} between the mountains themselves and [[Weathercote Wood]]. A small path led northward from the towns, north into the woods proper.\n\nAbout {{SI|5|mi|k}} from the village in the Greypeak Mountains, was a [[Hunting lodge (Greypeak Mountains)|hunting lodge]] owned by [[Marsten|Lord Marsten]].",
        "Trade": "While under Zhentarim control, one tenth of all goods that passed through town were taken by the local lord and redistributed to the Black Network. others passing through [[Anauroch]] stopped by Parnast on occasion, bringing exotic goods from the desert lands to the east.",
        "History": "Parnast was believed to have been founded no later than the last decades of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, the [[Zhentarim]] openly took control of Parnast and installed Lord [[Amarandaris]] as its ''de facto'' ruler. While the small village enjoyed some prosperity,\n\nIn the years leading up to the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Parnast was nearly overwhelmed with [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]] refugees that fled from their homes in the mines of [[Dekanter]].\n\nA regional agent of the [[Moonstars]] operated from within Parnast around the same time. They monitored the central [[Sword Coast]], from the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] and the [[High Moor]] to the [[Winding Water]] and the Greypeaks.>\n\nLord Amarandaris ruled Parnast for over 20 years before his death, an event that caused business coming through Parnast to wane and the village to fall into disrepair. After years of decline,{{Cite adventurers league/Treasure of the Broken Hoard|5}} The cult used the village as a stopover for their caravans that transported goods across the North, and kept their [[wyvern]] mounts in the local stables. \n\nSome time after the Skyreach Castle made its final departure, a band of adventurers drove the remaining cultists from Parnast.{{Cite adventurers league/Uninvited Guests|4}} The people of Parnast suffered raids led by the [[ettin]] named [[Gralm]],{{Cite adventurers league/Giant Diplomacy|6}} and the town itself was besieged by the [[hill giant]] [[Bad Fruul]] and his horde of [[orc]]s and other monstrous creatures.{{Cite adventurers league/Parnast Under Siege|20}}\n\nAround that same time, an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]] named [[SEER]] began taking actions to convince the beleaguered leader of Parnast to join the confederacy of towns and cities of the North.{{Cite adventurers league/Parnast Under Siege|9}}",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Golden Tankard]], the town's inn and tavern that drew its name from a finely-crafted ''[[tankard of plenty]]'' recovered by its owner, [[Raggnar Redtooth]].\n* [[Shrine of Axes]], a small shrine that featured a statue of [[Angharradh]],{{Cite adventurers league/The Black Road|4}} along with four [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian deities]], each of which represented one of the four seasons.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Azam]], a leader among the local carvaneers and a member of the [[Lords' Alliance]].\n* [[Chandra Stol]], the [[priest]]ess of [[Mielikki]] that emerged as a local leader in town.\n* [[Veradda Stoor]], a rather well-known treasure hunter."
