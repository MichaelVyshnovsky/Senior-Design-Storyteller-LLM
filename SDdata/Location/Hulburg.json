        "mainbody": "'''Hulburg''' was a small city on the northeastern shore of the [[Moonsea]] of [[north Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the city lay in ruins with few other than the [[Hulmaster]] family residing within the derelict city itself. [[Griffonwatch Keep]], the ancestral home of the Hulmasters, sat on a rocky outcrop on the eastern edge of the city.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the city only occupied a fraction of the area of historical Hulburg, and there were many vacant lots in the city. New construction was built on top of the foundations and basements of ruined buildings. In many cases, the old cellars remained intact and formed interconnected underground passages that could be used to travel underground through the city unnoticed. The inland parts of the city, outside of most new construction but inside the old walls, was a district known as [[Old Hulburg]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Climate": "Hulburg had winters cold enough to freeze over the harbor several months of the year."
        },
        "Religion": "The people of Hulburg were pragmatic and seemed to have little use for gods. There was a small sisterhood of [[Shar]] priestesses in the city and a temple of [[Cyric]] stood briefly during the reign of [[Maroth Marstel]] until it was destroyed by [[Geran Hulmaster]] and [[Sarth Khul Riizar]].",
        "Government": {
            "Law and Order": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a militia called the [[Shieldsworn]] kept order in the town, but that changed when [[Sergen Hulmaster]] became the Keeper of Duties for the harmach's council and began giving out trade concessions. The trading companies who came to town formed a merchant council and hired mercenaries to police the town in the form of the Council Watch, though they more often ignored those who worked for—or in the best interests of—the members of the council. Since then, the Shieldsworn were only allowed to deal with high crimes, such as murder.\n\nSlaving was outlawed for several generations, as was the opening of barrows on the lands within several miles of the town, owing to the fear of awakening the [[undead]] and incurring the wrath of [[Aesperus]], the King in Copper."
        },
        "History": "Hulburg was founded in the {{YearlinkName|940}} as a bulwark against [[orc]]s and [[giant]]s in Thar, consisting of a barracks, training grounds, and huge walls, but it became a town as soldiers' families began to arrive. the first lord of Hulburg to bear their name was [[Ivar Hulmaster]] in the {{YearlinkName|1050}}, who was installed by King Aesperus of [[Thentur]].\n\nHulburg was destroyed and rebuilt several times over the centuries. First, it was destroyed in a surprise attack by an army of giants in the {{YearlinkName|1110}}, and was rebuilt shortly thereafter, though it was regain its previous heights.\n\nDuring the [[Moonsea War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, Hulburg and [[Sulasspryn]] were both defeated by Mulmaster. Hulburg was ruined, but soon rebuilt once again. The population plummeted, with only a few still living in the area, and mostly in the outlying areas.\n\nHulburg remained in ruins for decades, and the fortunes of the Hulmaster family steadily declined. By the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the then-patriarch of the family and harmach of the city, [[Agryl Hulmaster]], began trying to foist his adult children onto travelers in hopes of marrying them off to anyone with money. Angar would go on to rebuilt the city having struck a deal with the [[lich]] Aesperus, who at the time dwelt in the [[Vault of the Dead (Hulburg)|Vault of the Dead]] beneath the city.\n\nThe city slowly repopulated, and as of the late 15{{th}} century DR, it had several thousand inhabitants. This was revealed to have been orchestrated as the first of several attempts by the [[Warlock Knights]] of Vaasa to seize control of the city in order to secure a trade route over the [[Galena Mountains]]. During this time, control of the city was briefly seized by [[Rhovann Disarnnyl]], but the Hulmasters regained control in the {{YearlinkName|1480}}."
