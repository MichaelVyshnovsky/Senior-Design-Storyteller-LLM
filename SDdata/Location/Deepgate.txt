'''Deepgate''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] town in the [[Mountains of the Alaoreum]] of [[Turmish]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|227}}, the dwarves of the Alaoreum battled a fierce [[red dragon]] known as [[Stormcrossing]]. Even though the dwarves won and King [[Showaxe]] of [[Ironfang Deep|Ironfang]] claimed the red dragon's treasure hoard, the price of the victory was high. Deepgate was set ablaze by the evil wyrm. The pitch-black smoke from the fires of destruction alerted [[human]]s from the [[Swordslake Creek]] of the previously unknown dwarven habitat deep in the Mountains of the Alaoreum.
