The Meirig Peatlands was a large swamp located on the island of Gwynneth within the Moonshae Isles.
The swamp was found in western Gwynneth along the coast of the Trackless Sea and Corwell Firth. Much of the swamps north and eastern border abutted the Shrouded Lands. The Meirig Peatlands was fed by several unnamed rivers flowing down from the Highlands to the east.
