Eastgate was the eastern gate into the city of Arabel in Cormyr,
The gate was flanked by two towers.
Outside Eastgate sat the Eastwatch Inn on the north side of the East Way. South of the road were the merchant yards for the Iron Throne. The citys open market was just within the gates, across the street from the Watchful Lynx inn.
