'''Cutlass Island''' was an island that sat in the mouth of the [[River Mirar]] in the city of [[Luskan]]. It was notable as the headquarters of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].

==Description==
Cutlass comprised two rocky hills&mdash;one on the northern side and the other on the southern side&mdash;connected by a pebble beach. The northern rise was the site of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] while the southern height was the site of the [[Sea Tower (Luskan)|Sea Tower]].

==Geography==
Cutlass Island was the largest of the five islands in Luskan (the others being [[Blood Island]], [[Closeguard Island]], [[Fang Island]], and [[Harbor Arm Island]]). It sat west of Closeguard, to which it was connected via the [[Sword Bridge]].

==Defenses==
Accessing the island on foot required first crossing the [[Dark Arch]] bridge from Luskan's [[Luskan/South Bank|South Bank]] onto Closeguard Island before then crossing Sword Bridge. Only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or of [[Ship Kurth]] were permitted onto Closeguard Island, and furthermore, the Dark Arch was protected via a [[ward]] which alerted the Brotherhood when it was crossed by anyone not affiliated with them while Sword Bridge contained a ward that allowed the Brotherhood to summon [[battle horror]]s for defense.

==History==
The Host Tower was raised on Cutlass island in the {{Yearlink|-354}}, and would eventually become the headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood ''circa'' {{Yearlink|1311}}. As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the island had its own docks.

| text = I sat upon a rooftop and looked out over Cutlass Island, at the ruins of the Host Tower of the Arcane. The locals say it is a cursed place, and I cannot help but agree. The restless dead walk that isle, sentinels to its lost power. In my younger days, I would have longed for the challenge and promise of treasure to be found in such a forgotten stronghold. I can see the magic swirling under shattered stone. It drifts among the bones of the once mighty wizards who ruled here.

In the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, when [[Deudermont]] led an effort to unseat the Arcane Brotherhood's grip on Luskan, [[Kurth|High Captain Kurth]] elected to support Deudermont, allowing his troops to cross Closeguard Island and attack Cutlass Island by land. Cutlass Island would end up being devastated by a giant explosion that all but destroyed the Host Tower. In the aftermath, Kurth became the de facto ruler of both Closeguard and Cutlass, however Cutlass Island came to be abandoned after this. In the decades following the [[Spellplague]] of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the island came to be infested with [[undead]]. While most folk stayed away, [[adventurer]]s were inevitably drawn to the island by tales of the bygone Arcane Brotherhood and promises of powerful [[magic]] still hidden there.

Following the [[Second Sundering]], it was once again home to the Arcane Brotherhood after the Host Tower was raised anew. At this time, the Arcane Brotherhood shared with northern hill with [[Ship Kurth]], who maintained stables on the island.

In the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, a horde of [[demon]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, and pirates managed to cross Closeguard Island and assail Cutlass Island as part of [[House Margaster]]'s invasion of Luskan. They were turned back largely by the spells of [[Gromph Baenre]].

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], the headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood.
* The [[Sea Tower (Luskan)|Sea Tower]], Luskan's oldest pirate stronghold. It came to be used to house lesser members of the Arcane Brotherhood during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
