        "History": "In the 14{{th}} Century [[DR]], the forces of [[Melvaunt]] and [[Zhentil Keep]] controlled lucrative mines that honeycombed the mountainsides north of the Ride.\n\nIn the 15{{th}} Century DR, the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] began efforts to infiltrate the local tribes in hopes of claiming the region, and its mineral wealth, for themselves.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Ride was inhabited by tribes of mounted barbarians,\nwho called themselves [[Eraka]], proud folk who treated outsiders as fair game. Although they were prone to constant internal struggling, they would quickly unite to face threats from the outside, like when the [[Zhentarim]] marched on [[Glister]] in [[1352 DR]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}\n\nThere were many independent tribes in the Ride. Known tribes included:\n\n*The [[Vaegould]], aggressive worshipers of the [[primordial]]s.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|60}}\n*The [[Varm]], a more peaceful tribe, practitioners of totem magic and worshipers of [[primal spirit]]s..",
