'''Utaqa''', located at the mouth of [[Al-Zulma River]], was the northernmost of [[Zakhara]]'s [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free Cities]]. Laying almost {{SI|200|mi|k}} from its nearest neighbor, [[Hafayah]], Utaqa's citizens felt on the edge of civilization, and took pride in their independence from authority.
