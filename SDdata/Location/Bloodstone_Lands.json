        "mainbody": "The '''Bloodstone Lands''' were a part of the [[Cold Lands]] in [[northeast Faerûn]] which primarily encompassed [[Damara]] and [[Vaasa]]. They received their name from [[bloodstone]], a precious gem mined throughout the region and which the nation of [[Damara]] used to establish itself as a major power in [[Faerûn]].",
        "Geography": "The Bloodstone Lands region was roughly triangular in shape and had an area of around 150,000 square miles (388,500 km<sup>2</sup>). It was nestled between the [[Great Glacier]] to the north, the nation of [[Impiltur]] to the south, [[Thar]] and the [[Moonsea]] to the west (with the [[Galena Mountains]] and [[Earthspur Mountains]] acting as a natural border), and [[Narfell]], the [[Great Dale]] and [[Thesk]] to the east.\n\nThe Bloodstone Lands were bisected by the [[Galena Mountains]], which made the [[Bloodstone Pass]] through them vitally important to the region.",
        "History": {
            "The Rise of the Witch-King": "The prosperity of the Bloodstone Lands was forever changed in one night when [[Zhengyi]], the Witch-King, erected [[Castle Perilous]] in the nation of [[Vaasa]] in [[1347 DR]].  The lich quickly took control of [[Vaasa]] and gathered to himself an army of [[goblin]]s, [[giant]]s and [[orc]]s, as well as formidable allies in the cult of [[Orcus]], and the guild of the [[Grandfather of Assassins]].  Occupied with troubles of their own, including an awakened evil in the [[Bloodstone Mines]] and an early winter which destroyed crops, caused starvation, and brought packs of dire wolves marauding across the countryside, [[Damara]] were unaware of [[Zhengyi| Zhengyi's]] quick ascension to power.\n\nThe very next year, the Witch-King's armies took [[Bloodstone Pass]], cutting off Damara from its main supply of [[Bloodstone]].  They proceeded into Damara with incredible speed, but the people of Damara and Vaasa fought bravely, unassisted by their neighbours, who dealing with internal affairs of their own, offered little in the form of substantial aid.  For ten years, the war raged, until it came to a head on the [[Ford of Goliad]] in [[1357 DR]], where neither army could gain the advantage.\n\nFooled by a traitorous lieutenant [[Felix]], who tricked then [[Virdin|King Virdin]] that his magical wand would enable safe passage across the river to gain the advantage on the Witch-King's armies, the Damarans marched into the waiting trap of [[Zhengyi]] and were swiftly defeated. [[Virdin]] himself was assassinated as he watched his army and nation fall, and it is widely believed that it was Felix who clutched the dagger.\n\nZhengyi would be defeated the following year by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his companions, who stormed Castle Perilous, broke the source of the Witch-King's power, and thus ended the threat of his undead army.",
            "The Kingdom of Bloodstone": "Gareth Dragonsbane was crowned King of Damara shortly after his victory over Zhengyi. He pursued this goal by pacifying the region, relying heavily on adventurers lured by large bounties for local monsters and stragglers of Zhengyi's armies, and by winning the hearts and minds of the Vaasan people, first by expanding economic opportunities in the [[Sunderland|south]] via the [[Vaasan Gate]] and later by liberating the [[Ostraland|north]] when [[Bregan D'aerthe]] seized the area around [[Palischuk]] in the late 1360s DR. At some point before the end of his reign, Vaasa was indeed absorbed into Damara as a barony, thus extending Gareth's rule over the entirety of the Bloodstone Lands. The capital was moved to [[Bloodstone Village]], which would be renamed as ''Bloodstone City'', and the realm was referred to as the Kingdom of Bloodstone, often shortened to simply Bloodstone.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}\n\nThe reign of Gareth Dragonsbane and his heirs was generally peaceful until the rise of the [[Warlock Knights]] in Vaasa. This militaristic cult appeared shortly after a \"[[Telos|falling star]]\" landed in Vaasa during the [[Spellplague]], and built its power by conscripting or killing [[Human]], [[Dwarf]], and evil [[Humanoid]] communities.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78,80}}{{BloodstoneCityRazing}} Soon after, they claimed complete control of Vaasa and seceded from the Kingdom of Bloodstone, leading to the unified kingdom's collapse back into Vaasa and Damara."
