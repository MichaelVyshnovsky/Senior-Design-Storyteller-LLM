'''Araundordoom''' was a rather typical [[Lich#Dooms|doom]] in the [[Underdark]] of [[Faer√ªn]] controlled by the once-[[human]] [[lich]] [[Araundor]].

==Description==
Like most lich dooms, Araundordoom was a labyrinthine network of twisted tunnels and cave rooms, with hiding places for magic items. 

==Defenses==
Araundor filled pools of water in his doom with [[poison]] and snare [[trap]]s to grab intruders' legs. He would hide underwater in such pools or in pools of mud through which they could also be trapped. Araundor avoided placing crushing traps, because liches were not immune to being physically smashed.

==History==
Araundor discovered the passageways and rooms that he claimed as his doom.
