The Central District was a district of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Central District was found in the North Quarter in the central portion of Huzuz just north of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne and the great mosques. It was a popular place for visitors to come because of the wide range of available services. Gambling occurred here as well, but most of the bets were fair.
Since it was located in the center of Huzuz, the Central District was surrounded by other districts including the Pilgrims District to the south, the Warehouse District to the north, the Craft District to the northeast, the Merchants District to the northwest, and the Peasants District to the west. The Central District was framed by the Merchants Avenue on the west and the Street of the Ajami on the east.
A good portion of Huzuzs active military was quartered within the Central District. Their close presence limited the frequency of major disturbances, though minor instances still occurred.
