'''Ankhwood''' (once part of the [[Winterwood]]) was a forest whose insect, animal and plant populations become mutated. There were once [[wild magic]] and [[dead magic]] areas orbiting one another in the forest, but by [[1374 DR]] this effect had subsided and the [[elf|elves]] living in the area were investigating the cause of the mutations.{{Cite web/More Lake of Steam and Dragon Coast}}
