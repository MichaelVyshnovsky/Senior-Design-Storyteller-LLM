        "mainbody": "'''Elah'zad''', meaning '''House of the Moon''' in [[Midani]], was an isolated oasis located in [[the Sword]] region of [[Anauroch]]. It was considered a sacred place of great power by the nomadic [[Bedine]] people that called the desert their home.\n{{Quote|Perhaps [[Eldath]] is free in [[Sembia]], but in Anauroch she is [[At'ar]]'s prisoner|''[[Ruha]], to her companion [[Lander]]''.}}",
        "Description": "Elah'zad was nestled within a valley surrounded by {{SIAdj|1000|ft|long=yes|adj=tall}} mounds of earth that were dotted with scores of small water springs. Water flowed down into a vividly blue lake, {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} in width, that gave life to striking and beautiful plant life. Because the lake of Elah'zad was considered sacred by the Bedine people, their [[camel]]s were forbidden from drinking from its waters.\n\nWithin the center of the beauteous lake was a small, grass-covered isle set in the shape of a half moon. It covered approximately {{SI|100|yd|long=yes}} of the lake's surface.\n\nA two-way ''[[portal]]'' linked Elah'zad with the [[Wyvernstones of Hullack|Ring of Wyvernstones]] in the [[Hullack Forest]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The shrubbery found in Elah'zad had distinct red-colored leaves with starkly contrasting blue stems. The trees shared the colors of several metals, including [[copper]] and [[silver]]."
        },
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Elah'zad was the meeting place of fifteen sheikhs of the sixteen surviving tribes of the Bedine, including the two leaders that had arranged their assembly, [[Sa'ar]] of the [[Bait Mahwa]] and [[Utaiba]] of the [[Raz'hadi]]. All the Bedine came together to decide what must be done to deal with the emerging threat posed by the [[Zhentarim]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to Bedine legend, the valley was once home to the moon goddess [[Elah]], before she was driven away by the goddess of the sun, [[At'ar the Merciless]]. At'ar then transformed Elah'zad into a prison for [[Eldath]], the Mother of Waters, as she was jealous of the beauty Eldath possessed.\n\nIt was one of the known locations where the [[Ritual of the Waxing]] could be performed using the ''[[Selûne's Eye|Eye of Selûne]]''.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Elah'zad (temple)|Elah'zad]], the alabaster temple dedicated to the moon goddess Elah."
