        "Trade": "Quaint little village, Ulver's Lance's main industry was cart-building and woodcarving.",
        "History": "The namesake of Ulver's Lance was a hero named [[Ulver]] who kept the [[Halondar]] safe from [[bugbear]]s, [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, and other monsters who raided merchant caravans in the nation's early years.\n\nIn the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], inhabitants of Ulver's Lance cared little of the old hero. Instead, they cared about an unknown thief plaguing the town. That individual visited sleeping villages and took just a few [[coin]]s each time. The locals thought the thief had some magical means of making folk fall asleep or even ways of moving through solid walls. ''Circa'' [[1360 DR]], a local woodsman claimed to have fallen into a cellar of a burned down house at Lance's edge. He discovered numerous boxes, chests, and urns filled with the town's stolen coins. The woodcutter bragged about the find at a tavern and spent looted coin generously. The next morning, his decapitated corpse was discovered in a secluded alley. Townsfolk tried to claim the said treasure but discovered the burnt-out house's cellars empty. The treasure's fate was unknown; however, coin thefts continued.",
        "Notable Locations": "Shrines to [[Silvanus]], the Forest Father, and to [[Tyr]], the Even-Handed, could be found in the town."
