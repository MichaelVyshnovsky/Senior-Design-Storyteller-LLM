Corrant was the Eleventh City of the Sword of ancient Jhaamdath, located in the region of central Faerûn later known as the Vilhon Reach.
The city of Corrant was approximately one kilometer across in its prime. It was a seemingly random collection of grand buildings. It retained its urban design as a ruin, albeit overgrown and swallowed by a marsh. At its center stood a great ruined temple to Auppenser, the only part of the ruins visible, still sticking up above ground as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The temple also functioned as a lounge or club as the inhabitants of Jhaamdath considered worship to be a "hobby diversion." The temples worship was not done through grand religious rites but rather through private meditations. Topiary-filled gardens were common in Corrant during the days of antiquity.
Corrant was established in the  as part of Jhaamdath, making it the Eleventh City of the Sword.
As of the late 14 century DR, several psionic items were appearing across the Dragon Reach—Nimblesteps. These short swords were said to have been recovered from the sunken ruins of Corrant.
The center of Corrants ruins, a temple accessible from above ground, was the habitat of a large naga community.
