Manywaters was a small independent town in the southern Border Kingdoms in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The town was located to the southwest of the Grand Duchy of Shantal. Manywaters was so close that the borders of the Grand Duchy lied a mere two hunded and forty paces from the towns walls.
Manywaters would just be a small, sleepy village if were not for the Riven Rock Pool and the Riven Healing House, a small temple dedicated to Ilmater.
