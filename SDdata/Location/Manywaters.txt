'''Manywaters''' was a small independent town in the southern [[Border Kingdoms]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The town was located to the southwest of the Grand Duchy of [[Shantal]]. Manywaters was so close that the borders of the Grand Duchy lied a mere two hunded and forty paces from the town's walls.

==Trade==
Manywaters would just be a small, sleepy village if were not for the [[Riven Rock Pool]] and the [[Riven Healing House]], a small temple dedicated to [[Ilmater]].
