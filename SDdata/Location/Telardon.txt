'''Telardon''' was a city in the ancient [[sun elf]] realm of [[Siluvanede]] (founded c. {{Yearlink|-8400}}). It was called the '''City of Emerald Spires'''.

==Geography==
Telardon was built amidst the great [[High Forest]], at a time when it was much larger in extent. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], its ruins were to be found in the western fringe of the [[Silverwood]], looking out over the [[Evermoors]].

==History==
During the [[Seven Citadels' War]] (c. {{Yearlink|-4500}} to c. {{Yearlink|-4300}}), the allied forces of [[Eaerlann]] and [[Sharrven]] toppled the emerald towers and demolished the city. However, the overeager Eaerlanni missed the subterranean facilities where corrupt sun elves had engaged in fiendish arts.

==Trade==
The [[wizard]]s of Telardon fashioned unusual [[magic item]]s, for which the city was well known not only in Siluvanede but in realms beyond.

==Description==
Once known for its high emerald-hued towers, no more than a few crumbling heaps of green stone remained of Telardon after its destruction.

But beneath the city were buried dozens of secret chambers and libraries, untouched by the war. Here, the a few corrupted sun elves of old had practiced fiendish [[magic]]s.

Hundreds of [[arcane]] magic items were also left behind and buried in the ground. With centuries of neglect, their powerful magic decayed and their energies mingled into a corrupting effect called "greenbinding". It had a horrifying effect on animals, [[fey]], [[humanoid]]s, and [[giant]]s that unwittingly wandered into the area, turning them into mighty [[plant creature|plant-like]] monsters known as [[greenbound creature]]s.

==Inhabitants==
Once home to sun elves, by [[1374 DR]] the ruins were the lair of dozens of greenbound [[troll]]s that had been transformed there.
