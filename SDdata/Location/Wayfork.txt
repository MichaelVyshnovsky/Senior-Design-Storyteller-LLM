Wayfork was a village located on the Sword Coast, just north of the Trollbark Forest and south of Dragonspear Castle along the Trade Way, where it splits into two roads – towards Baldurs Gate and towards Boareskyr Bridge.
Wayfork was a small agrarian community of farmlands, cottages, dirt roads, and stone wells. The main landmark of the village was the Wayfork Inn, catered to traveling caravaners.
In the late 14 century DR, the Wayfork Village was raided by the Red Fang marauder goblin gang, secretly allied with the Zhentarim. Hobgoblin Harnak the Butcher lead the assault and began slaughtering villages. He took a stand against a group of six adventurers inside the Wayfork Inn, where the scared townsfolk found shelter. Subsequently, the village was saved and Harnak – slain.
