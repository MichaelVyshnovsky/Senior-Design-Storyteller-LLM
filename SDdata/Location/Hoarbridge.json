        "mainbody": "oarbridge was a waymeet and end destination of the Cold Road.\nThe site lay in northern Narfell where the route from distant Nethentir ended on the frozen shores of the upper Icelace Lake. It lay some  north of NJast.\nHoarbridge owed its location and early importance to the dwarven kingdom of Dareth, as the metal wealth of the dwarves attracted many men.\nIn the , Dareth stopped trading in the waymeet of Hoarbridge, for reasons unknown to the Nar who simply recorded that the \"Stout Folk came no more.\" In reality, a flight of white dragons had claimed the upper caverns of the dwarven kingdom, and the dwarves themselves been driven deep below. In time, dwarf and dragon slew each other, thus opening up the way for hunters and woodsmen.\nThe Far Quey tribe lived north of Hoarbridge on the other side of the Icelace Lake, and the Hoarbridge waymeet was the nearest trading place that the tribe could reach."
