        "mainbody": "he House Fajirik Military Camp was a relatively permanent outpost of House Fajirik, located west of the Jamal Oasis in the High Desert of Zakhara.\nSoldiers stationed here were often bored, which many traders took advantage of by bringing goods and services for them to spend their money on. Captain Ramad bin Yusif al-Kahn kept men on watch constantly along the southern border of a barren weed field called a qaraa.  During peacetime, these soldiers had nothing to do except stare out into the vast emptiness of the desert and wait for any movement from the soldiers of House Ashurim, which was located on the other side of the qaraa.  This waiting game had lasted up to 200 years by 1367 DR.\nFunding for these soldiers was rumored to come from Tajar for House Fajirik, and Qudra for House Ashurim."
