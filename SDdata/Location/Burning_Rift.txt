The '''Burning Rift''' was an underground volcanic rift in [[Chult]].

==Geography==
The Burning Rift was located in the [[Firelands]] directly beneath the [[Peaks of Flame]].

==Description==
The Burning Rift had a number of ''[[portal]]s'' that linked it to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. The rift was also connected to the Peaks of Flame volcanoes above it through lava tubes.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]], the fire [[deity|god]] [[Kossuth]] appeared in the Burning Rift as the [[firenewt]] [[blackguard]] [[avatar]] [[Chassan]]. In this form, Kossuth led the firenewt [[Ak'ta]] tribe in war against the [[pterafolk]] of the [[Chultanegar]]. After departing the [[Prime Material Plane]], Kossuth rewarded Chassan by allowing him to become a [[death knight|deathflame]] and return to leadership of the Ak'ta tribe.

==Inhabitants==
[[Firenewt]]s and [[salamander]]s dwelt in the Burning Rift, having migrated there from the Elemental Plane of Fire.
