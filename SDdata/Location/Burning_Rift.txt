The Burning Rift was an underground volcanic rift in Chult.
The Burning Rift was located in the Firelands directly beneath the Peaks of Flame.
The Burning Rift had a number of portals that linked it to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The rift was also connected to the Peaks of Flame volcanoes above it through lava tubes.
During the Time of Troubles, the fire god Kossuth appeared in the Burning Rift as the firenewt blackguard avatar Chassan. In this form, Kossuth led the firenewt Akta tribe in war against the pterafolk of the Chultanegar. After departing the Prime Material Plane, Kossuth rewarded Chassan by allowing him to become a deathflame and return to leadership of the Akta tribe.
Firenewts and salamanders dwelt in the Burning Rift, having migrated there from the Elemental Plane of Fire.
