'''Sahaladar''' was the largest floating city on the world of [[Azallah]].

==Geography==
Sahaladar was built on a floating island that was located above the [[Water|watery]] depths of Azallah.

==History==
The inhabitants of Sahaladar peacefully shared their world with the water-breathing species known as the [[Kilm]].

At some point in time, the city was invaded by [[Morag]] and her army of [[Old One|Old Ones]]. These armies were successfully stopped by the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] confronting Morag in the [[Source Stone]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372]] [[DR]].
