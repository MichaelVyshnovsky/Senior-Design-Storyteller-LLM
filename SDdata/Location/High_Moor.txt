The '''High Moor''' was a large, monster-infested, open moorland in [[West Faerûn|western]] [[Faerûn]], bordered on the east by the [[Serpent Hills]] and on the west by the [[Misty Forest]].

==History==
It was created in about {{Yearlink|-10500}} when the fallen kingdom of [[Miyeritar]] was destroyed by the [[Vyshaantar Empire]]'s magics in the [[Dark Disaster]] during the [[Crown Wars]].<ref><ref>

==Locations==
The High Moor contained numerous ancient ruins and structures, but the most familiar included [[Dragonspear Castle]] on the western edge; [[Hammer Hall]], a log house and stables surrounded by a wooden palisade near the banks of [[Highstar Lake]]; and [[Orogoth]], a large ancestral hall near the Serpent Hills.{{Fact}}

[[Rhymanthiin]], the Hidden City of Hope, created by a large group of notable magic-users led by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]], [[Tsarra Chaadren]], and [[Ualair]], was located on the High Moor.{{Fact}}{{Cite web|url=http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=1072927&page=10|title=The one and only "Ask the Realms authors/designers thread" 4|accessmonthday=January 8th|accessyear=2009|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=October 14th, 2008}}

Forays into the High Moor were usually based out of the town of [[Secomber]], north of the region.
