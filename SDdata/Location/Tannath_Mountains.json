        "mainbody": "The Tannath Mountains were the southern part of the Dragonjaw Mountains, starting south of the River Umber. They were recognized as a territory belonging to Aglarond, and formed its border with Thay to the east.\nThe craggy range was made of rugged, tall mountains of fault block origin. Wide passes flanked them on both sides, the Tannath Gap on the west and the Shyvar Pass on the east.\nGriffons were known to dwell in the range. There were also birds and mountain goats. The slopes of the range were very bare.\nThe Tannath Mountains were considered part of Aglarond.\nSilver was mined out of the mountains at some point before .\nThe region served as a buffer between Aglarond and Thay, making for an obstacle which Thayan armies found almost impassable\nDuring Brindors reign, in 1369, he built the citadel Glarondar and the Watchwall with the aid of the local galeb duhr in .\nIn , Captain Arol of the Watchwall forces tried to cut a deal with local goblins in order to get them to provide advance warning of any threats heading their way.\nThere were rumors in  that goblins had settled in the silver mines.\nThe Watchwall led from the mountains towards Glarondar in the Yuirwood.\nThe zone was not inhabited by humanoids in , the peaks having never been settled and stone giants were known to dwell there. Galeb duhr populated the mountains since before ."
