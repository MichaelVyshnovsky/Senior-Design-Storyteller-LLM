The Abeiran Underdark was the equivalent of Torils Underdark on the world of Abeir. Other than the fact that it was inhabited by drow and mysterious monsters, nothing more was known about this region.
A portion of the Abeiran Underdark was transported to Toril alongside Laerakond during the Blue Breath of Change.
