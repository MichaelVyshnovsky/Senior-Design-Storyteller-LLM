The '''Abeiran Underdark''' was the equivalent of [[Toril]]'s [[Underdark]] on the world of [[Abeir]]. Other than the fact that it was inhabited by [[drow]] and mysterious monsters, nothing more was known about this region.{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|52}}

A portion of the Abeiran Underdark was transported to Toril alongside [[Laerakond]] during the [[Blue Breath of Change]].
