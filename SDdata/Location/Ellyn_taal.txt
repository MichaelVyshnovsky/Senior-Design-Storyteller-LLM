'''Ellyn'taal''' was a city located in the [[Northdark]].

==Description==
Ellyn'taal was an abandoned [[illithid]] city of the northern parts of the [[Underdark]].

==Trade==
Information about the ancient [[magocracy]] of [[Netheril]] could be found here, but only for a very steep price. In exchange for such knowledge, one would lose part of their sanity or their knowledge of an [[epic magic|epic]] [[spell]], which would be lost to them for eternity.

==History==
In [[-371 DR]], the [[Netherese]] arcanist, [[Ioulaum]], became a [[lich]] and established a base close to Ellyn'taal. In [[-339 DR]], he foresaw that the fall of the Netherese empire was nigh. Thus, he abandoned his enclave permanently and laired in the base he had previously established. Ioulaum took apprentices from both the Netherese refugees, and also the mindflayers of Ellyn'taal. These illithids were known as the [[Alhoon (organization)|Alhoon]] and became the very first [[illithilich]]es (which would later generally become known as alhoons).

Ioulaum took the minds of his illithid students and created an undead elder brain; he then merged his own mind with it. Almost all of Ioulaum's students perished in the production of the elder brain, but some of them escaped. The escapee mind flayers told the story of the creation of an undead elder brain to those of the Underdark. One of Ioulaum's human students, [[Tabra]], saw the production of the elder brain, and believed that the mind flayer students had destroyed her master. In response, she made her way to Ellyn'taal and cast ''[[Ioulaum's longevity]]'' on herself, destroying the city-dwelling illithids in the process.

Tabra was not the only one to have survived to the 2{{nd}} millennium [[DR]], as Ioulaum too would survive as the undead elder brain he had created. He would become known as the Oracle of Ellyn'taal.

==Rumors & Legends==
In [[329 DR]], it was rumored that Ioulaum was actually killed by a faction of alhoons; in response [[Tabra]] butchered the mind flayer inhabitants of the city.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Ioulaum]], an [[archmage]] who survived here as an undead elder brain
* [[X'ss'a]], a mind flayer who was once imprisoned by the ruler of [[Runlatha]]
