Mind flayers
Ellyntaal was a city located in the Northdark.
Ellyntaal was an abandoned illithid city of the northern parts of the Underdark.
Information about the ancient magocracy of Netheril could be found here, but only for a very steep price. In exchange for such knowledge, one would lose part of their sanity or their knowledge of an epic spell, which would be lost to them for eternity.
In -371 DR, the Netherese arcanist, Ioulaum, became a lich and established a base close to Ellyntaal. In -339 DR, he foresaw that the fall of the Netherese empire was nigh. Thus, he abandoned his enclave permanently and laired in the base he had previously established. Ioulaum took apprentices from both the Netherese refugees, and also the mindflayers of Ellyntaal. These illithids were known as the Alhoon and became the very first illithiliches (which would later generally become known as alhoons).
Ioulaum took the minds of his illithid students and created an undead elder brain he then merged his own mind with it. Almost all of Ioulaums students perished in the production of the elder brain, but some of them escaped. The escapee mind flayers told the story of the creation of an undead elder brain to those of the Underdark. One of Ioulaums human students, Tabra, saw the production of the elder brain, and believed that the mind flayer students had destroyed her master. In response, she made her way to Ellyntaal and cast Ioulaums longevity on herself, destroying the city-dwelling illithids in the process.
Tabra was not the only one to have survived to the 2 millennium DR, as Ioulaum too would survive as the undead elder brain he had created. He would become known as the Oracle of Ellyntaal.
In 329 DR, it was rumored that Ioulaum was actually killed by a faction of alhoons in response Tabra butchered the mind flayer inhabitants of the city.
