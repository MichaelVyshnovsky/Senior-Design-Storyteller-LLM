        "mainbody": "The Harbor District was a ward located within the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe Harbor District sat in south-central Zhentil Keep along the River Tesh where it met the Moonsea.\nThe Harbor District was accessible from the Foreign Quarter by way of the Tesh Bridge in the west and the Force Bridge in the east. Access to the Common Quarter was available through an unnamed gate where Canter Street gave way to Ship Street to the west, and another gate in the east where Tesh Street met Barge Street. Direct access to the Inner Quarter was not possible from the Harbor District.\nThe actual harbor here could easily dock up to 250 vessels. Use of the harbor for loading and unloading of cargo was allowed only for the Zhentarim, lords of the city, and others with close relations to the Black Network.\nZhentilar guardposts, barracks, and armories were situated throughout the entire quarter.\nMany large Zhentarim warehouses were located in the Harbor District. The Shield Faces North was a popular tavern within the district. Other locations of note included Oparils Tower and Terns Shipwright Service."
