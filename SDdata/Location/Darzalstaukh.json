        "Activities": "Though the duergar had yet to threaten Rashemen as of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the [[Rashemaar]] were nonetheless wary of the sinister gray dwarves. Given that [[drow]] were sometimes spotted in the [[Running Rocks]], the Rashemaar assumed the [[Underdark]] was contiguously connected beneath Rashemen, which would allow the duergar to strike wherever they wished. The [[hathran]]s hoped to broker some kind of trade deal with the duerger in order to obtain valuable [[iron]] ore and other metals."
