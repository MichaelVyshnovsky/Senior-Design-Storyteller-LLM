        "mainbody": "Jumlat, the City of Multitudes, (together with Gana) gave the group of the Pearl Cities of west Zakhara their name.\nJumlat was located in the southeastern part of the Pearl Cities along the coastline where the Golden Gulf and Crowded Sea joined. It lay on the banks of al-Fatir River.\nthumb|Jumlats pearl divers on the Golden Gulf.\nJumlats population in 1367 DR was 300,000, making it one of the largest cities throughout Zakhara. Outside harvest time, many inhabitants of this unprepossessing and crowded city turned to begging. Many citizens of Jumlat lived in poverty, indebted to the small percentage of wealthy merchants who controlled the pearl trade.\nJumlats most important source of income was the harvest and trade of pearls.\nJumlat supported a city guard of 10,000 soldiers. The city also employed 1,000 cavalrymen hired from the High Desert. Jumlats official navy numbered 30 ships, but another 10â€“30 ships of privateers and corsairs were hired to protect the pearl trade and harry rival Gana.\nA vicious sea monster was rumored to be the cause of missing ships from Jumlat. The Sultan offered a reward of 100,000 dinars to someone who either killed the beast."
