'''Sebakar''' was a nation of [[lycanthrope]]s, most notably [[werecrocodile]]s, located in the [[Adder Swamp]] of [[Chessenta]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Sebakar was a stratified nation ruled by a werecrocodile nobility who called themselves the "Children of Sebakar". The lower class comprised [[wererat]]s, who served as laborers and merchants.

The nation's name was derived from the [[Untheric]] name for [[Sebek]], the werecrocodiles' patron [[god]].

==Geography==
Sebakar claimed the entirety of the insect-infested Adder Swamp as their domain, and the entire wetland became synonymous with Sebakar. This meant that the nation stretched from the [[Bay of Chessenta]] in the east to [[Lake Akax]] in the west,

==Government==
The nation was ruled by the werecrocodile nobles. Their capital was well-hidden in ancient sunken ruins that dated to the time when Chessenta was under the rule of the [[Unther#History|Second Untheric Empire]].

==Trade==
Sebakar's only notable trade partner was [[Erebos]], with whom they did business via the small trading post of [[Thurik]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|75}} [[Salt]] was the most valuable commodity found within the werecrocodiles' domain, so much so that Chessentan merchants were willing to brave the Adder Swamp's dangers to acquire it.

==History==
Werecrocodiles had originally come to the Adder Swamp after being expelled from [[Mulhorand]] in the {{YearlinkName|1183}}. There they founded the [[City of the Werecrocodiles]] and immediately came into conflict with the local wererat population, who were seen as lesser beings deserving of being [[Slavery|enslaved]]. It was not until after the [[Spellplague]] of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, and the subsequent expansion of the Adder Swamp to dominate most of the western coast of the Bay of Chessenta, that the nation of Sebakar was founded and the wererats were subdued.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, the werecrocodile nation had moved its capital to an ancient ruin that had been flooded and forgotten about by the Chessentans centuries prior.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|74}} and was an important power in Chessenta by that time,{{Cite polyhedron/108/Forgotten Deities: Sebek|4}}

==Inhabitants==
The werecrocodiles of Sebakar were known to eat [[human]] flesh. Even if visitors survived an encounter with one of them, their bite had the potential to infect [[humanoids]] with [[lockjaw]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|75}}

Unsurprising given their self-styled moniker as "Children of Sebakar", the werecrocodiles worshiped Sebek/Sebakar, an [[archfey]] and minor deity of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]]. It was rumored that Sebek/Sebakar himself dwelt somewhere deep within the swamps of Sebakar, although there had been no sign of him for decades as of 1480 DR.
