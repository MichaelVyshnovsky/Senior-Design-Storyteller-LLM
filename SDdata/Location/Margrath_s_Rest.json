        "Description": "Decades after it stopped being used, the rocky coast was still home to several prominent wrecks inhabited by a profusion of [[eel]]s and [[clam]]s that found homes in the underwater hulks.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-06-02 - Margrath's Rest Marine Life}}",
        "History": "Before the reign of King [[Azoun IV]], the beach was used for the disposal of large, decrepit ships that couldn't be effectively handled at sea. The ships were ran aground onto the shore and stripped of any valuable or useful fittings, with the timbers left to rot. The beach eventually fell out of use, but during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] it was still home to many rotted hulks."
