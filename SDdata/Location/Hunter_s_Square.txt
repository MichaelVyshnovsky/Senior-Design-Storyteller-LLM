'''Hunter's Square''' was a courtyard in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]] where [[adventurer]]s and members of the [[Hunters' Guild of Chult]] congregated to plan their hunts and trade for lures and equipment.

==Geography==
The square was located south of the [[Red Bazaar|Bazaar]] and just inside Port Nyanzaru's main gate.The ''[[Neverwinter (game)|Neverwinter]]'' video game does not specify which of Port Nyanzaru's three gates is this "main gate". Elsewhere, the game also refers to this gate as the "south gate", and given that Hunter's Square is located south of [[Wakanga O'tamu]]'s villa, of the docks, and of the Bazaar, it is most reasonable to assume that it lies just inside either [[Ubtao's Jaws]] or the [[Tiryki Gate]]. However, the in-game map of the city does not correspond closely to the map provided in ''[[Tomb of Annihilation]]'', and thus it is not possible to identify a definitive canon location for Hunter's Square. 

==History==
During the events of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]],{{ToA-time}} the famed writer and traveler [[Volo]] visited Hunter's Square and became enamored with the hunters' tales of dangerous Chultan beasts, particularly the [[King of Spines]].
