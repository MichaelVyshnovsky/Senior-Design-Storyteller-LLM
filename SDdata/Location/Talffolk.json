Its borders were marked by the Sea of Swords to the east, the Swanmay River to the south and west, and by the southern edge of the Fairheight Range in the north. The Swanmay River served as the border between Talffolk and both Stirgewick and Stagford.\nThe capital of Caer Callidyrr sat within Talffolk, making it the most populous of Callidyrrs four counties. The eastern half of the ominous Dernall Forest was also found here. The High Kings Road connected Talffolk with Fairheight and Stirgewick, in addition to making travel between the small towns and villages easy."
