Huddagh was a settlement in Sembia that lay along the Way of the Manticore.
Huddagh was well known for its unique purple mineral water wells that seemingly never failed. The water was used by several local churches in creation of holy water. Among other trades, Huddagh was home of many renowned jewelers and potters.
Huddagh lay east of Daerlun and Skultan and west of Mulhessen along the Way of the Manticore. It was at the intersection of Dornsars Ride toward Kulta.
