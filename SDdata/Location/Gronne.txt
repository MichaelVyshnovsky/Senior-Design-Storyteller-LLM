'''Gronne''' was a village in the [[Alpuk]] region within the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
Gronne was located {{SI|30|mi|k|long=yes}} east of the [[Novularond]]. 

==Layout==
The village had a very organized layout. [[Snowhouse|Snowhouses]] were laid out in a neat circle around a cluster of [[quaggi]]. Most of the snowhouses had intricate rock gardens, filled with colorful stones the residents collected from the Novularond.

==Inhabitants==
The villagers had a well-earned reputation for their insight and wisdom. Residenta from nearby [[Iulutiun]] villages often sought the advice of the Gronne village council in resolving disputes or to seek their opinion on civic proposals. The Gronne village council freely gave such advice and while they did not seek payment for their services, they accepted gifts, especially colored stones to add to their rock gardens.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-598}}, a group of [[innugaakalikurit]] discovered a catapult in Novularond that belonged to [[frost giant]]s. They took it back to their village, and refused to return it to them. The frost giants destroyed an arctic dwarf village in response. The elders of Gronne intervened, who volunteered to negotiate the dispute to prevent a war. They found the arctic dwarves guilty of theft, and the thieves are turned over to the frost giants. The prisoners became slaves and their descendants remain enslaved to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Government==
Like most large Iulutiun villages, Gronne was overseen by a village council, or [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''iquemelum'']].
