        "mainbody": "The '''Valley of Nexal''' was a fertile valley located in central [[Maztica]]. It was the location of [[Nexal]], along with three other major city-states.",
        "Geography": {
            "[[Nexal]]": "The greatest city in the valley, it was located on an island in the middle of the lakes and was the heart of the Nexal Empire.",
            "[[Tezat]]": "One of the city-states, it was located on a lake shore in the northern part of the valley.",

            "Lake Qotal": "The smallest and shallowest of the four lakes in the Valley of Nexal.",

            "[[Mount Zatal]]": "A volcano located in the mountains overlooking the valley.<ref>"
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The Valley of Nexal was inhabited solely by humans of the [[Nexalan]] ethnic group. They spoke their own language, Nexalan, and they lived in mostly in the four great cities of the valley. Many Nexalans also lived in villages located throughout the valley.",
        "Society": "Each the Nexalan city-states was ruled a by Revered Counselor, and high-ranking priests and warriors had much influence as well. However, all obeyed- and payed tribute to- the Revered Counselor of Nexal.\n\nThe Nexalans had an incredibly war-like culture, and practiced human sacrifice more than other Maztican nations. They worshiped the [[Maztican pantheon]], honoring [[Zaltec]] above the others, and [[Tezca]] and [[Azul]] as well. They did not honor [[Qotal]] outside of a small cult. The Nexalans were the ones who came up with the Feathered Wars, which were staged battles meant to collect prisoners for sacrifice, held between the armies of the valley's city-states.",
        "History": "Originally, there were three city-states in the Nexal Valley, Tezat, Azatl, and Zokik, which fought each for the sheer joy of fighting. The three cities existed in a delicate balance of power, neither one gaining much advantage over the others. However, not long after the fall of [[Payit]], a small group of people from the north, descendants of a tribe of [[Dog People]], arrived in the valley. This small group claimed an island in the middle of the lakes as their home, and built a small, crude village upon. They also offered to fight, and thus have the protection of, Tezat, which was the most powerful city at the time.\n\nThis small tribe brought to the valley a new devotion to both fighting and the worship of Zaltec. They were fierce warriors, though few, and defeated many of their enemies. As they multiplied in numbers, Tezat came to rely on them more and more, until it seemed close to conquering the valley. However, the warriors upon which they relied betrayed them, allying with Azatl and Zokik to conquer Tezat, before using diplomacy to conquer the other two as well. The once-small tribe took a new name for themselves and their city: Nexal.\n\nFor centuries, Nexal ruled the valley, conquering [[Pezelac]], [[Kolan]], and [[Huacli]] (with the exception of Otomi). 299 years and 15 Revered Counselors after their rise to power, though, Nexal's power was broken when the god Qotal returned, and Zaltec rose to fight him. Mount Zatal erupted, the valley was devastated, and people fled south into the [[House of Tezca]] desert (later founding [[Tukan|a new city]]).<ref>"
