Kepetur was an an abandoned prayer tower found in Thay that held historical significance in the conflict between Mulhorand and the Red Wizards.
The tower was built in the form of a massive obelisk.
Kepetur was built in a region that was later incorporated into the tharch of Pyarados in eastern Thay.
During the rebellion of the Thayan people from the Mulhorandi, sometime during or before he 10 century DR, the Red Wizards destroyed many and conquered a few of Mulhorands unique prayer towers.
Priests of Anhur managed to hold off the Red Wizards at Kepetur for numerous tendays, but eventually fell when the demon lord Eltab appeared in the Realms to join the conflict. The Lord of the Hidden Layer opened a permanent gate to the Abyss at the site of the tower, allowing demons to claw their way into the structure. Fortunately for the people residents of Pyarados, the Red Wizards managed to magically seal the obelisk of Kepetur, and prevent the fiends from escaping beyond.
It was said that Kepetur housed many Mulhorandi relics within its walls, left abandoned when the demon lord threatened the lands.
