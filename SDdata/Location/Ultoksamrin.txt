'''Ultoksamrin''' was one of the subkingdoms of [[Deep Shanatar]]. After the [[dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom fell, it was taken over by non-[[dwarves]].

==Geography==
Ultoksamrin was situated beneath the eastern [[Marching Mountains]] in [[Calimshan]] and the [[Forest of Mir]]. The former subkingdom consisted of the ruling cavern, a 1000-ft-high (300 m) grotto, a mile beneath [[Mount Sarengard]], and of several tunnels.

==Structure==
After the fall of [[Old Shanatar]], the former subkingdom Ultoksamrin was emptied of dwarves. By [[1372 DR]], several non-dwarf races occupied territory of Ultoksamrin's tunnels. The different races fought over additional territory.

The ones who were most successful at it were the [[drow]]. These drow were followers of the deity [[Vhaeraun]] and were escapees from [[Guallidurth]], from where they fled religious persecution. They were situated in the [[Vault of Cloaked Midnight]], the cathedral city. The temple of the city covered about half of the ruling cavern and the drow lived in former clanholds of the dwarves for protection.
