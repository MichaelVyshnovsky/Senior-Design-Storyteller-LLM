        "mainbody": "'''Unther''' was one of the [[Old Empires]] in [[east Faerûn]]. The Untherans were brought to [[Toril]] from [[Earth]] by the [[Imaskar|Imaskar Empire]] looking for some manpower. After countless petitions, the [[gods]] of the [[Untheric pantheon]] were able to manifest into Toril by sending physical avatars. With the help of their deities, the former slaves freed themselves and settled the lands that later became Unther. Ironically, their rival in the millennia to come was another human tribe captured by the [[Imaskari]] and freed at the same time, which founded the empire of [[Mulhorand]].",
        "Government": "After the foundation of the First Untheric Empire, the god-kings of the Untheric pantheon ruled the land without opposition. After [[Enlil]] left the Realms in {{Yearlink|-734}}, In the chaotic period after Gilgeam's death, Mulhorand conquered most of Unther, and a group of [[spellcaster]]s known as [[Northern Wizards]] were able to maintain the north free of the presence of the occupation force. \n\nThen, the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] ravaged the land and Unther was transported to the world of [[Abeir]], where the people of Unther were enslaved by the Mulhorandi who were also transported to that world, and by the Abeiran [[genasi]]. During the final years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]], a second incarnation of Gilgeam appeared to lead them against their masters, before the [[Second Sundering]] returned Unther to the world of Toril, where Gilgeam was crowned as the supreme ruler of Unther reborn again.",
        "People and culture": {
            "Society": "Unther began as a benevolent nation, but after millennia of governing the land, Gilgeam became corrupted with power and in doing so, he also corrupted the nobility. Consequently, for most of its history, Unther was seen as the most miserable of the tyrannies in Faerûn. While the government espoused the power of law, the ruling class had no regard for human life and less for demihumans. Members of the lower social classes lived not to prosper but only to survive, and many inhabitants opposed Gilgeam's rule. \n\nAfter the death of Gilgeam, most of Unther territory became part of Mulhorand. In those lands, the culture and society were not different from the Mulhorandi ones. In the north, the few free cities of Unther looked with contempt for their traitorous brethren while trying to maintain alive their old customs.\n\nIn the post-Sundering years, the society of Unther was not so different from that of the years before Tiamat killed Gilgeam.",
            "Language": "{{Main|Untheric}}\n\nThe language of Unther was called [[Untheric]]. It belonged to the same language family that originated the [[Mulhorandi language]], but over the course of many centuries, Untheric evolved on its own until few similarities remained between the two languages.",
            "Military": "Soldiers of the Untheric Army were typicaly slaves or poor citizens, while the officers consisted of lower ranking nobles. A typical unit of Untheric Soldiers consisted of 60 soldiers, led by an officer. Untheric battle tactics and methods were considered to be old-fashioned by the standards of other Faerûnian nations, as the army of Unther was poorly trained and used mostly bronze weapons and armors. The Army consisted primarily of infantry, as well as a smaller amount of magic users and charioteers.",
            "Navy and seafaring": "Vessels from Unther were named after sea creatures or sea-related myths."

        "History": "Unther's origins were strongly tied to that of Mulhorand. After the Untheric pantheon helped to free the Mulans from their Imaskari masters, those led by Enlil settled in the lands west of the Alamber Sea, and the nation of Unther.\n\nThe Untherans warred against the [[Turami]] natives, driving them to the lands of Mulhorand, and after that, Unther became a highly magical society, prospering under the rule of its god-kings. Unther and Mulhorand clashed occasionally, but eventually realized that warfare was pointless, so all conflicts were carefully controlled by the god-kings while both nations agreed on a common border in the [[River of Swords]]. Unther expanded their territories to the north and west, warring with the dwarves of the [[Great Rift]], and gained a reputation for having fierce and ruthless warriors who were hated by those they conquered.\n\nThe age known as the \"First Untheric Empire\" ended when the wizard [[Thayd]] instilled a rebellion against the god-kings that eventually led to the [[Orcgate Wars]] and the [[Battle of the Gods]] that killed most of the Untheric pantheon.\n\nEnlil left Toril in −731 DR, making Gilgeam the supreme god-king of Unther, Unther, however, had declined greatly and piece by piece its far-flung colonies rebelled. Eventually, Chessenta succeeded in conquering Unther and ruled it as a vassal state for nearly a century. After the death of the Chessentan hero [[Tchazzar]], Unther was able to free itself and turned its focus inward.\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles|Godswar]], Gilgeam was slain by Tiamat. Mulhorand seized the opportunity in 1371 DR to launch an invasion, conquering most of the Untheran territories. The Northern Wizards ruled the few free regions in the north, trying to cling to their old customs and lifestyle,\n\nIn [[1385 DR]], most of Unther was engulfed by the Spellplague and transported to the world of Abeir. A fragment of the [[dragonborn]] nation of [[Tymanchebar]] was transplanted from Abeir to the lands formerly occupied by Unther. As of [[1479 DR]], these dragonborn had formed the realm of Tymanther, named in honor of their native realm and the realm that they believed they had destroyed.\n\nDuring their time in Abeir, the survivors among the Untherans and the occupying Mulhorandi armies in Unther became slaves of the [[Shyr]]an [[genasi]]. On the eve of a great battle against the Shyrans, however, they suddenly returned to Toril as part of the Second Sundering. Gilgeam took advantage of the new situation and quickly led them against the dragonborn of Tymanther, starting the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]]. \n\nThe Untherite army, bolstered by the demons, was able to reclaim most of their old northern territory and even put the dragonborn city of [[Djerad Kethendi]] under siege. But when they tried to conquer the territories south of the River Alamber and lay siege to [[Djerad Thymar]], the Tymantherans were able to retaliate thanks to the unlikely arrival of a [[devil]] army from [[Nine Hells|Malbolge]] sent to destroy Gilgeam's demon allies. Without the advantage of numbers and facing the unified force of the dragonborn and devils, and with the threat of the Second Sundering trying to return Tymanther to Abeir (a process that was stopped by Enlil), the Untherite armies were forced to retreat to Unthalass.\n\nAlthough he was defeated, Gilgeam didn't relent from his plan to retrieve all of the former lands of Unther. As of [[1489 DR]], Tymanther and Unther were waging a new war, although the Untherite army was unable to defeat the [[Nanna-Sin|dragon turtle]] that protected Djerad Kethendi."
