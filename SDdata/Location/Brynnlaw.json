        "History": "Brynnlaw was once an island town which survived off of [[fish]], as well as other produce. The [[Spellhold]] asylum was built nearby, and offered jobs to the denizens. The pirate lord, [[Desharik]], had lost a naval battle against another pirate king. He was forced to this island and his ships invaded the town.\n\nDesharik's pirates took the homes of the people, killed their mayor, and forced them onto the streets. To the town folks' dismay, they dumped their mayor's corpse into the sea. The evicted townspeople begged the asylum for shelter, but the wizard's locked the doors shut. From here on, Desharik took control of the island, forcing many natives into [[prostitution]], or to the grave.\n\nThe nearby asylum belonging to the [[Cowled Wizards]] was attacked by [[Jon Irenicus]] in [[1368 DR]]. [[Gorion's Ward]] and his companions traveled on [[the Galante]] to Brynnlaw, in order to try and save his fellow [[Bhaalspawn]], [[Imoen]].",
        "Notable Locations": "The island of Brynnlaw held a few places of interest. It had a fairly large dock, where a few large ships, and multiple smaller boats could dock. \n\nMany homes were dotted around the island, as well as a temple to [[Umberlee]] and a tavern, the [[Vulgar Monkey]]. Other notable locations were [[Lady Galvena's Festhall]] and the lair of the pirate king.",
        "Inhabitants": "The island was mainly occupied by sailors and [[courtesan (prostitute)|courtesans]], along with the Cowled Wizards. The pirates of Brynnlaw were often hostile, and would duel other inhabitants, or outright attack newcomers."
