        "mainbody": "Torglor was one of the eight subkingdoms of the dwarven realm of Shanatar.\nTorglor was located beneath the Snowflake Mountains, which formed the border of the surface realms of Amn and Tethyr. It was the deepest of the eight kingdoms, being found in the Middledark. Only a handful of passages connected Torglor with the surface. \nFormerly a kingdom of shield dwarves, by the 1300s DR, the ruins of Torglor were used as an encampment, called Gatchorof, of a large contingent of githyanki led by a powerful mage wielding a vorpal sword made from silver. These warriors from the Astral Plane, and their allies, established extensive fortifications. From these fortified caverns, the githyanki waged war against the mind flayers of Oryndoll. \nThe dwarves who lived in Torglor had fought with the mind flayers of Oryndoll so extensively that they developed unique knowledge and equipment in battling the illithids. Much of the equipment was so well-made that they remained functional after centuries.\nAs worshipers of Diirinka, the dwarves of Torglor were known for their inventions and their skill in rune magic."
