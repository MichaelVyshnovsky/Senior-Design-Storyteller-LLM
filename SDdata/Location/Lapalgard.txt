Lapalgard was a large town in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR. It was based around the ancient stronghold known as the Fortress of Lapalgard.
It stood in the south of the realm, at the end of roads from Ithmong and Lushpool via Dungar, and faced the Dun Hills and the Bandit Wastes.
Facing attacks from yuan-ti, in the aptly named Year of Fragile Beginnings, −690 DR, the Lapal tribes united in the nation of Lapaliiya. Over the next ten years, they constructed the Fortress of Lapalgard and declared it a symbol of their unity and common cause.
The Fortress of Lapalgard stood strong for centuries, but no wars came to it after the fall of the Shoon Imperium in . Instead, a town grew around it, enriched by caravans passing between Lapaliiya and Halruaa through the Talath Pass.
Lapalgard was led by the Knight-Commander of the Fortress.
The civic deity of Lapalgard was Tempus.
The town had a population of 3,701 in 1373 DR.
The soldiers of Lapalgard conducted patrols of the Bandit Wastes and the northeastern Mhair Jungles in equal measure.
