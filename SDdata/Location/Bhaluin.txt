'''Bhaluin''', or the '''Drowned City''', was a ruin located in the middle of [[Gbor Nor]] in [[Semphar]].

==Geography==
The ruins of Bhaluin sat upon an island within Gbor Nor located {{SI|10|mi|k}} from the coast. Many of the ancient buildings were found under the waterline, giving the city its nickname.

==Description==
The ruins of Bhaluin were well-preserved for the most part. Much of the streets were cluttered with rubble from collapsed walls. Seven large minarets were found at the center of the city, accompanied by a strange wailing sound that some believed was just the wind.

==History==
Bhaluin was rumored to have been built 4,000 years ago during the height of the [[Imaskar|Raurin Empire]].

==Inhabitants==
A secret cult of the dead lay hidden somewhere deep within Bhaluin. Both living and [[undead]] members comprised their ranks.
As of {{yearlink|1372}}, the city was being occupied by followers of [[Myrkul]], who was dead at the time. Led by [[Viandos Rippek]], they sought an artifact that could slay [[Kelemvor]].{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerun|64}}

==Rumors and Legends==
Bodies from adventurers who explored the city were often found floating in leather boats. A few survivors reported doing battle with strange creatures wearing tattered red robes.
