'''Drakkalor''' was one of the eight subkingdoms of the [[dwarven]] realm of [[Shanatar]].

==Geography==
The ruins of Drakkalor were located beneath the [[Kuldin Peaks]] which were located in the surface realm of [[Tethyr]].

==Inhabitants==
Rumours held that [[ghost]]s and [[haunt]]s roamed the tunnels of the ruined kingdom, but in fact it was inhabited by a confederation of [[skulk]]s. The skulks settled in the area long ago after escaping slavery from a [[drow]] city. Most avoided any visistors to the realm but some served a [[doppelganger]] who made a lair within the treasure vault of the ruined palace. The skulks learned how to use the ancient dwarven mechanisms and used them to prevent intruders into the realm.

==History==
Drakkalor was once a thriving kingdom. Unlike many other dwarven settlements, the economy of Drakkalor was based not on mining or mineral wealth but rather crafting items and trade. Over time, greed and covetousness consumed the inhabitants of the realm, especially the upper ruling class.
