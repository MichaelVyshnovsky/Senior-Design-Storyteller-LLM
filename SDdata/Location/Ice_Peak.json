        "Government": "The small settlements were spoken for by the First Captain of Aurilssbarg, the largest town in the area that was essentially a colony of [[Luskan]].",
        "Trade": "The bulk of the trade came from the harvesting of fish, [[whale]]s, and [[seal]]s. Animal products were mostly shipped to Luskan, but some inhabitants, particularly those of the smaller settlements, sold them elsewhere.",
        "Defenses": "Each village in the region had big fishing boats that could be used by its military of order a hundred people. Aurilssbarg itself had several longships it could put to use.",
        "History": "In the 1{{st}} century [[DR]], the mortal [[Uthgar]] (who would later become a [[demigod]]), gathered his first armada. He voyaged across the sea and ransacked Bjorn's Hold of the Ice Peak, taking with him boat loads of fish, furs, and other products.\n\nSeveral hundreds of years prior to the 14{{th}} century DR, the [[white dragon]], [[Freezefire]], had its last fight recorded, and lay dormant. However, in [[1358 DR]], [[mage]]s of [[Hellgate Keep]] had heard that the wyrm, now ancient, held a powerful [[magic]] [[gem]] in its claw. The [[Heroes of Ascore]] beat the mages in the chase, but Freezefire had returned to life. The heroes slew the beast, and its hoard was distributed to goodly folk of the [[North]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The isle was mainly populated by [[Northlander]]s and [[Ice Hunters]]. However, creatures such as [[goat]]s, [[seal]]s, [[whale]]s, fish, and [[yeti]]s were known to roam the Ice Peak. A couple of [[white dragon]]s were reported to have made residence in the high-up caves.",
