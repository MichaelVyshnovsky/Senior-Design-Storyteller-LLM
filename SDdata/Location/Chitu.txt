'''Chitu''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Chitu, once the bustling hub for miners of the [[Mountain of Iron]], has withered into a village in decline. The disintegration of the mining industry has led to a gradual exodus, leaving behind a landscape of hardship and neglect. Visitors were met with a scene of destitution, where the outer buildings stood abandoned, their structural integrity compromised by time and neglect. The heart of the village, though still inhabited, painted a bleak picture of poverty. Women and children, their appearances marred by the struggles of their lives, navigated a life of scarcity, while the men, once full of aspirations, now carry the weight of broken spirits, their livelihoods crushed by harsh realities.

==Government==
As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the village's [[jito]] was [[Fukuda Sueji]]. His governance was marked by self-indulgence and a disinterest in the welfare of his subjects. Unmoved by the plight of the villagers, his focus remained on personal gains and the comforts of his station.

==History==
The villagers' resignation has left them vulnerable to encroachment by undesirable elements. [[Bakemono]] and [[goblin rat]]s, emerging from the mines and the surrounding forests, have begun to brazenly inhabit the fringes of Chitu.
