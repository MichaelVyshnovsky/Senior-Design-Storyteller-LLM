        "mainbody": "'''Vournoth's Mire''' was an area in the [[Deep Wastes]] between [[Szith Morcane]] and [[Maerimydra]] that had been the lair for numerous creatures over the years.",
        "Geography": "Situated along the natural tunnels that connect the city of [[Maerimydra]] with the outpost of [[Szith Morcane]], it was 40 miles north from Maerimydra itself and 50 miles from the [[Wailing Cliff]]. The mire was distinguished by an underground river that formed a narrow gully through the cavern and, over the years, had formed two stagnant lakes within the caves. This river eventually fed into the enormous [[Lake of Shadows]] to the west.",
        "History": "Although many creatures had laired in the mire, the area earned its name from a [[lich]] called [[Vournoth]] who was perhaps its most notable inhabitant. In [[800 DR]], a [[drow]] champion from the city of Maerimydra eventually tracked down Vournoth and allowed for the establishment of a drow outpost of Szith Morcane in [[804 DR]].\n\nOver the next 100 years the drow used Vournoth's Mire as a well-patrolled campsite. However, the Maerimydra drow's hold on the surface area known as the [[Shadowdale|Land under Shadow]] was crippled in [[906 DR]] when they were driven from the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba|Twisted Tower]] by the [[wizard]] [[Ashaba]]. This caused traffic to Maerimydra to atrophy and eventually the site of Vournoth's mire was overrun by other creatures.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], Vournoth's Mire was home to an unusual pair, a [[beholder]] named [[Sekrr]] and an [[illithid]] [[sorcerer]] called [[Quthnorak]]. During the [[Silence of Lolth]], when the city of Maerimydra fell to the hordes of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]], refugees from the burning metropolis had to make their way through the mire and lost half a dozen of their number in the process.",
