Wild '''southwest [[Zakhara]]''' comprised a number of uncivilized islands in the western part of the [[Crowded Sea]]. Most of them were part of one of the two archipelagoes of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]] and the [[Djinni's Claws]].

==Geographic limits==
To the [[West Zakhara|north]], the tip of [[al-Suqut Mountains]] and [[al-Tarik Islands]] bordered southwest Zakhara within the [[Pearl Cities]] region. In the [[South Zakhara|east]], the [[Nada al-Hazan]] and [[Steaming Isles]] archipelagoes were its neighbors. To the south lay the [[Islands of the Utter South]] and beyond the endless waves of the [[Southern Ocean]], while to the west uncounted leagues of the [[Great Sea]] separated it from the lands south of [[Maztica]].<ref>

==Jazayir al-Sartan==
{{Main|Jazayir al-Sartan}}
The verdant Isles of the Crab formed a crab-shaped archipelago. They were settled by only a few [[Enlightenment|enlightened]] Zakharans, but home to monsters and savage tribes of [[halfling]]s, [[human]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[Ogre mage|ogre magi]], as well as the dreadful [[sartani]].<ref>

==The Djinni's Claws==
{{Main|Djinni's Claws}}
The jungle-covered island chain of the Djinni's Claws, roughly in the shape of a lower arm and hand, was a dangerous place for any outsider. While the northern islands of [[Yadd al-Djinni]] and larger [[Kaff]] were inhabited by pirates, monsters, and [[undead]], the southern isles of [[al-Zira]] were supposed to be the territory of the [[marid]]s, but [[dao]] and [[djinn]] also dwelt there.
