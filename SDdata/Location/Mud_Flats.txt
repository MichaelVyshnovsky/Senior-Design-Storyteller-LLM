The '''Mud Flats''' were a beach in northwest [[Waterdeep]], located north of [[Mount Waterdeep]] and bordering the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] just outside the western [[Trollwall]].{{Template:Cite book/Volo's Guide to Waterdeep|56}}

==Geography==
The mucky northwestern shore of Waterdeep was surrounded by the [[Waterdeep/Field Ward|Field Ward]] in the north and by [[Gull Leap]] and Mount Waterdeep in the south. It opened into the frigid waters of the [[Sea of Swords]].

An underground stream that led to the Mud Flats passed under the city and was connected to a series of chambers below the cellar of [[Cassalanter Villa]] in the Sea Ward.

==Defenses==
The beach could be accessed through Waterdeep's [[West Gate]]. The gate was patrolled by the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]], who took note of local inhabitants entering or exiting the city. However, new arrivals to Waterdeep were not allowed into the city via the West Gate and were instead redirected to other points of entry.

==History==
In the early history of Waterdeep, the Mud Flats were inhabited primarily by sailors. After rich families moved in to settle in the wards north of Mount Waterdeep, one of the few traces of the previous demographic that remained in the area was the [[Fiery Flagon]] tavern on [[Seawatch Street]]. By the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tavern remained a favorite of sailors throughout the [[Sword Coast]].

==Inhabitants==
The beach was frequented mostly by fishers, clam diggers, and occasional locals who enjoyed bathing in the cold waters of the Sea of Swords. Some fishers who used nets or traps also kept their boats on the Mud Flats, in order to avoid the docking fees imposed by the city in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]].
