The deep cliffs of the canyon enveloped the [[River Ashaba]] on the tail end of its course from the [[Feather Falls (waterfall)|Feather Falls]] waterfall in the west until it emptied into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the east.",
        "Notable locations": "The chasm of Scardale was so large that it contained a wealth of farmland, a number of small villages as well as all the larger cities of Scardale including:\n\n*[[Chandlerscross]]: Scardale's capital, post [[1370 DR]].\n\n*[[Scardale Town]]: The remnants of the dale's former capital, that served as a port city in the Sea of Fallen Stars.\n\n*[[Scarsdeep]]: A smaller town, nearby to Chandlerscross, that grew in size and population during the dale's occupation."
