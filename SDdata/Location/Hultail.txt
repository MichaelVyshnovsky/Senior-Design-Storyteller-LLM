'''Hultail''', in the distant past known as '''Rallyhorn''', was a small port village on the eastern side of the [[Wyvernwater]] in [[Cormyr]], where locals felt a kinship towards their northern neighbors from the [[Dalelands]].

==Description==
The settlement was a small collection of buildings that lacked its own Cormyr-appointed Lord. Its main notable feature was Hultail being the only true port on the Wyvernwater and standing guard of the trade "secret door" to Cormyr.
The town's oldest historic neighborhood remained named after the founding family – Rallyhorn, a small smattering of streets around [[Rallyhorn Foregate]] street that connected the castle gate with what used to be cattle meadows, eventually turned into the streets of Hultail. The early streets of the Rallyhorn neighborhood once were the location of the town's tanneries and workers' huts, but eventually moved east, up the Wyvernwater, to remain closed to the receding [[Hullack Forest]]. In the 15{{th}} century DR, the neighborhood was a humble place where one could find weavers, garment-makers, and dyers.

==Geography==
Hultail stood on the [[Hullack Trail]] that hugged the Wyvernwater's southern shores and the [[Thunder Way]], a wagon-trail, started at Hultail, moved through Cormyr, into the [[High Dale]], and down to [[Sembia]], ending in [[Saerb]].

==Government==
Lacking its own government, Hultail was lorded over by [[Wheloon]], [[Sarp Redbeard]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The only major noble house of Cormyr that had a holding in Hultail by the 14{{th}} century DR was the [[Wyvernspur (house)|Wyvernspur family]].

==Trade==
The village stood along a less-known trade route that connected Cormyr through the [[High Dale]], the [[Hooknose Crag]], and down the [[Thunder River]] to Hultail. This trade entrance was called the "secret door" and received significantly less attention than the tree routes through the [[Thunder Peaks]] and the [[Vast Swamp]]. The "secret door" was used by those seeking quiet entrance to Cormyr and by the traveling Dalesmen. Hultail received business through traveling merchants from the Dales as well as from the smuggling operations that used the "secret door."

Hultail's famous [[Trindar Shipyards]] was the largest producer of ships and vessels that traversed the Wyvernwater. Apart from shipbuilding, Hultail traded in fishing and running fish hatcheries. The [[Spawnhall]], by Hultail's, hid a secret that helped the town with the fishing industry – a closely guarded [[deepspawn]] that created volumes of fish that was sold locally and exported to [[Suzail]]. Excess fish was used as fertilizer and ground into [[fishmeal]] for [[Sembian]] farmers.

==Defenses==
Hultail was protected by a small group of militia.

==History==
Before Hultail was a hamlet, it was the [[Rallyhorn Castle]], home of an old noble [[Rallyhorn]] family of Cormyr, built by Lord [[Theldrin Rallyhorn]]. The town steadily grew around the castle that stood atop [[Rallyhorn Ho]]. Rallyhorn was renamed Hultail in the {{YearlinkName|98}}, following the rollout of the first naming laws of Cormyr, being the first settlement to do so.

At some point, many years before the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, an unnamed [[ettin]] was able to assemble a raiding party of [[goblin]]s and [[orc]]s to carry out several attacks on the towns of [[Thunderstone]] and Hultail. Another monster-related event involved a single [[ankheg]] killing forty-two [[cattle]] beasts on the farmlands outside of Hultail all within a month.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, three Crown mages of Cormyr were stationed in Hultail. The posting was considered to be remote and of no particular importance.

==Rumors & Legends==
*Locals believed that a faerie ring atop a certain hill in Hultail was the site of annual [[elf|elven]] frolicking while they rested at the heart of the hill the rest of the year. This belief was false and dated back to inhabited [[Myth Drannor]] when its elves gathered on the faerie ring in a meeting with members of other elven communities, arriving there via ''[[gate]]s''.
*Another legend talked about the ''[[Ring of Swords]]'', nite talking blades of black metal that rose out of the waters of the Wyvernwater to threaten enemies of Hultail. Some believed that they could only be summoned by a [[Talassan]] and could not be awoken until nine days passed since the ''Ring's'' appearance.

==Notable Locations==
*[[The Blue Dragon's Bones]], a dark and dingy tavern named after a [[blue dragon]]s demise on the very spot where it was built many years before the late 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[The Plate of Eels]], an eatery that specialized in freshwater [[eel]]s, [[roasted chicken]], [[crayfish]], [[clam]]s, and other lake fish, accompanied by quality strong [[beer]].
*[[Muranee's Old Treasures]], a used clothing and footwear store ran by [[Muranee Crownlinden]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
*[[Shrine to Waukeen (Hultail)|Shrine to Waukeen]], the shrine to the Merchant's Friend who did business with moneylenders and moneychangers.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190914002019/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_010203-09.htm| title = So Saith Ed Jan – Mar 2009| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}
*[[The Sixcandles Inn]], unrelated to similarly named inns in [[Ordulin]] and [[Suzail]]. It was an old and worn down establishment and the only inn in Hultail as of the late 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Spawnhall]], a domed structure where the town's hatcheries were located and guarded by at least 40 [[Purple Dragons]]. Entry was only authorized by the [[Court in Suzail]] or Lord Redbeard in Wheloon, and fishmeal on offer was sold for 60 [[gp]] per wagonload.
*[[Trindar Shipyards]], busy and famous shipwright docks, ran by [[Surdan]] the ship-master in there late 14{{th}} century DR.

==Notable Inhabitants==

*[[Avarelle Myntdown]], a seamstress who lived on the [[Easting Lane]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
*[[Fractus]], a retired [[War Wizard]] who established a tower shop in the eastern Hultail in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, leading many to believe he was a spy for the Dragon Throne.
*[[Sulimra]], a beautiful painter and medicine maker from [[Turmish]] who settled in Hultail in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
*[[Thaere Mrindormra]], an aging [[half-elven]] healer in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
