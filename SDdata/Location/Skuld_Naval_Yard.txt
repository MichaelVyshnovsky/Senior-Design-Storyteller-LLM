The Naval Yard was a walled section of the capital city of Skuld in Mulhorand during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The Naval Yard was situated in the southwest corner of Skuld. It was bordered on the west by the Alamber Sea and on the north by the River of Shadows. 
Aside from the docks, access to the Naval Yard was granted via a gate to the southeast, and to the north via the Bridge Gate. 
Vessels from Mulhorands decrepit navy used the Naval Yard exclusively.
