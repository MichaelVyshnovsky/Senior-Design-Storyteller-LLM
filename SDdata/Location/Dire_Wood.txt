The '''Dire Wood''', also known as the '''Enchanted Wood''',

{{Quote|It is not cold you are feeling, it is death. Death ancient and mad and mighty, death sorrowful and ashamed.|[[Melegaunt Tanthul]] on the Dire Wood.}}

==Description==
The Dire Wood was made of black, [[petrified]] trees that appeared to be dead, and began to reek of death and decay.

[[Wild magic]] permeated the woods, emanating from the [[Karsus Butte|arcane landmark]] within its center.

===Climate===
Strange weather patterns including "wizard weather" were reported throughout the Dire Wood. These phenomena included falling snow the color and smell of blood, rain as hot as boiling water, and hail that would explode when striking the earth.

==Geography==
The Dire Wood was situated in the eastern reaches of the High Forest, surrounding the source of the [[Heartblood River]].

The space it occupied within changed depending on the observer. Anyone walking the circumfrence of the woods outside its border would continue for approximatley {{SI|4|mi|k}},

===Geographical Features===
The outer border of the woods that designated its change of dimensions were marked by a ring of massive albino [[oak]] trees known as the ''Pale Ring''.

==History==
Cultists founded the city of [[Karse]] at this location after [[Karsus's Folly]] in {{YearlinkName|-339}}, but it fell into ruin shortly thereafter due to internal religious strife. 

Around a thousand years later in the {{YearlinkName|883}}, a wizard from [[Ascalhorn]] named [[Wulgreth (Ascalhorn)|Wulgreth]] came to the ruins to raise an undead army using [[epic magic]]. His spell was interrupted however by his henchman, [[Jhingleshod]] the Axeman. The release of the necromantic energy caused Wulgreth to become a [[lich]] and the nearby forest was transformed into the Dire Wood.

For centuries after its formation, the Dire Wood continued to expand at a rate of approximately {{SI|80|ft}} each year. This growth stopped during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, when magic across the Realms ceased functioning as expected.

Just prior to the [[Rage of Dragons]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[gold dragon]] [[Aerosclughpalar]] retired to the Dire Wood to prepare for the madness that would inevitibly consume him. When he succummbed to the [[King-Killer Star]]'s magical effects, he annihilated much of the petrified woods and the monstrosities that dwelled within.

==Rumors & Legends==
Legend said that the Dire Wood was so named for a horrific massacre of [[human]]s many years before the age of ancient [[Netheril]]. It was said this mass-killing led to the red soil that covered the forest floor. Yet others believe it was the actions of [[Karsus]] that imbued the wood with its eldritch evil.

Stories of the Dire Wood's peculiar nature spread as far away as [[Loudwater]].

It was speculated by some sages that the woods could be a point from which travel to an alternate [[Prime Material plane]] was possible.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Karse]], the ruins of a former [[Netheril|Netherese]] settlement.
* [[Karsus Butte]], the remains of the fallen body of Karsus, made gigantic by the divine energy he stole, which lay in the exact center of the woods.

==Inhabitants==
Due to its supernatural origins and nature, the Dire Wood was home to many [[aberration]]s, such as [[deepspawn]],

The evil and strange goings-on of the forest were closely monitored by the elves of [[Reitheillaethor]].

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Jhingleshod]], the Iron Axeman and [[undead]] hunter of the lich Wulgreth of Ascalhorn.
* [[Lossarwyn]], a lich and [[druid]] of the [[Twisted Rune]] that remained trapped in the woods, and was to blame by many for the woods' "wizard weather". 
* [[Tianna Skyflower]], "princess" of and leader of the [[Half-Elven Renegades|band of elves]] that descended from ancient [[Eaerlann]].
