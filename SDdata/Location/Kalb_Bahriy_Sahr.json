        "Geography": "These small islands were composed of coral and rock. No known charts existed for safely navigating them, making most sailors give them a wide berth.\n\nDangerous waves and powerful storms surrounding the reef regularly dashed ships against the islands if they got too close.",
        "Inhabitants": "As the name implied, the waters surrounding these islands were teeming with sharks of all sizes represented by many different species."
