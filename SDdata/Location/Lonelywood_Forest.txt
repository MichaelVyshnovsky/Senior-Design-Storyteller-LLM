The '''Lonelywood Forest''' was an isolated stretch of woodlands located in the [[Icewind Dale]] region of [[the North]].

==Geography==
The woods of Lonelywood were situated on the northeastern shore of [[Maer Dualdon]].

===Geographical Features===
A variety of woodland creatures typically found in [[the North]] made their home in the Lonelywood Forest, including [[hare]]s, [[fox]]es, [[bear]]s, and [[wolves]].

==Trade==
The Lonelywood forest provided a continual source of lumber for the people of the Ten Towns. It was considered the greatest economic asset that benefited the people of Lonelywood town.

The nomadic [[Reghedmen]] tribesmen used lumber from the Lonelywood forest in the construction of the modular, [[deer]]skin tents they set up when forming their camps.

==Defenses==
In addition to its abundant natural resources, the woods offered a natural barrier to the people of Lonelywood town. Raiding parties often missed the small hamlet entirely thanks to the forest's protection.

==Inhabitants==
At least two types of supernatural beings were known to have dwelled in the woods, which could not be any more different that one another. At least a small number of [[chwinga]]s and a single [[banshee]], the spectral remains of a particularly malevolent [[elven]] woman.

Clergy of Silvanus and locals believed that great white wolves, who appeared rarely in the Lonely Wood, were messengers of the Oakfather, who would carry the deity's vengeance out.
