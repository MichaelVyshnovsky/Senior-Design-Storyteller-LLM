The Lonelywood Forest was an isolated stretch of woodlands located in the Icewind Dale region of the North.
The woods of Lonelywood were situated on the northeastern shore of Maer Dualdon.
A variety of woodland creatures typically found in the North made their home in the Lonelywood Forest, including hares, foxes, bears, and wolves.
The Lonelywood forest provided a continual source of lumber for the people of the Ten Towns. It was considered the greatest economic asset that benefited the people of Lonelywood town.
The nomadic Reghedmen tribesmen used lumber from the Lonelywood forest in the construction of the modular, deerskin tents they set up when forming their camps.
In addition to its abundant natural resources, the woods offered a natural barrier to the people of Lonelywood town. Raiding parties often missed the small hamlet entirely thanks to the forests protection.
At least two types of supernatural beings were known to have dwelled in the woods, which could not be any more different that one another. At least a small number of chwingas and a single banshee, the spectral remains of a particularly malevolent elven woman.
Clergy of Silvanus and locals believed that great white wolves, who appeared rarely in the Lonely Wood, were messengers of the Oakfather, who would carry the deitys vengeance out.
