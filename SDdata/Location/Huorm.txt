'''Huorm''' was a city along the [[Golden Water]],{{cite book/Darkvision|81|8}} east of [[Sezilinta]]. It was the home of the [[chaka]]s [[Turamir]] and [[Salicur]].

==Description==
The city was close to [[Adama's Tooth]], a mountain {{SI|25|miles|k|long=yes}} west; its shadow caused early sundowns all year round. The [[Datharathi]] chaka based their mining operations on the monolith from there.

The city had a port{{cite book/Darkvision|189-190|20}} Sometimes, elves from [[Al Qahara]] traded the desert relics they uncovered in the city, looking for grain, cloth, or spices.{{cite book/Darkvision|207-208|22}} They were aware of ''haddrum'' contraband smuggled in and out of the city to oasis towns around the desert.{{cite book/Darkvision|184|}}

==History==
