        "Geography": "Situated at the mouth of the [[River Ssarren]] on the west end of the [[Golden Water]], Turelve was a major launching point for caravans heading north or west out of Durpar. Its close proximity to [[Veldorn]] made this a dangerous place to live.",
        "Description": "Turelve was home to 30,000 residents, making it one of the larger cities within the Shining Lands.",
        "Defenses": "In order to guard against threats from Veldorn, Turelve maintained a force of 2,000 horsemen—the largest standing force for any city in Durpar. In addition to the horsemen, many [[halfling]] slingers manned the city walls. Caravans taxes were used to pay for many of these soldiers in return for a guarded escort well beyond the city. Though many grumbled about the tax, most caravan masters saw the wisdom of paying it.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1048}}, Nawab [[Saed]] of the city's council was turned into an [[vampire]]. The [[undead]] councilor fled to the ruined city of [[Old Vaelen]], where he quickly amassed a following of subservient monsters."
