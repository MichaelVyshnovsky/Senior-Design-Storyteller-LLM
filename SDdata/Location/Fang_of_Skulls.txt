The '''Fang of Skulls''' was a giant spike of stone that jutted out from the center of the [[Dead Orc Pass]]. It was named for the hundreds of skulls, tusks, and other bones that decorated its length, all of which were gathered from foes and prey slain by the [[Tornskulls]] [[orc]] tribe.

==Description==
The [[menhir]] stood {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} tall. The skulls and bones attached were lashed to the peak's side by means of [[leather]] thongs. Intertwined with this mass of bone material was a crude ladder that allowed the orcs to ascend its height.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that a ''[[portal]]'' existed at the ''Fang's'' peak, though its destination was entirely unknown.
