        "mainbody": "'''Narubel''', which was also called the '''City of Seasnakes''', was a small city found in northwest [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].",
        "Geography": "Narubel was located in the far northwest corner of Thindol along the coast of the [[Shining Sea]] near the border of [[Chult]], making it the most remote of Thindol's settlements.",
        "Description": "The city was built into a series of sea caves that honeycombed the cliffs of a natural harbor.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Narubel was an independent city-state ruled by [[yuan-ti]] representatives of [[House Sauringar]]. Pirates who preyed on the Shining Sea used Narubel as a home port. Any combined efforts from [[Lapaliiya]], [[Tashalar]], and [[Calimshan]] to put an end to the pirates never came to fruition thanks to agents of the Sauringar spread across those regions whispering words into the right ears of their [[Rundeen]] allies. The pirates sent tribute from every cargo they seized to the [[pterafolk]] of the [[Chultengar]] as payment for services rendered long ago.",
        "History": "Narubel was initially founded by [[Tashluta]]n merchants in {{YearlinkName|29}}, who were eager to plunder the riches from the jungles of Chult. Caravans flowed from [[Thindar]] to Narubel in order to bypass sailing around the dangerous waters surrounding Chult. This came to an end in the {{YearlinkName|293}}, when House Sauringar assumed control of the city and their [[spirit naga]] allies from the Chultengar began attacking caravans. A long continuation of such attacks ended virtually all traffic to Narubel."
