        "mainbody": "Luskan, also known as the City of Sails, was a port city at the mouth of the River Mirar on the Sword Coast North. Luskan, despite the presence of the Ten Towns, was considered by many to be civilizations farthest reach.\nAlthough once a bustling city, in the days prior to the Spellplague, the city would suffer greatly at the hands of Arklem Greeth. The resulting disaster would allow the Spellplague to nearly annihilate the city, with it having only a fraction of its former populace.\nAs of 1370 DR, the city was split into northern and southern halves by the River Mirar, and these were connected by the bridges Dalaths Span, Harbor Cross, and the Upstream Span. Other than the Host Tower of the Arcane, the city was dominated by two- and three-story buildings.\nThe city and its five inhabited islands sat in the mouth of the River Mirar, on the Mirarmouth Bay. Three of these were inhabited Cutlass Island (upon which lay the Host Tower of the Arcane, and which was connected to both sides of the river by bridges), Closeguard Island (which housed Ship Kurth and was connected to the southern bank by a bridge), and Blood Island (which housed Luskans army garrison). The remaining uninhabited islands were Fang Island (named for its treacherous rocks) and Harbor Arm Island (which sheltered the citys harbor).\nthumb|Luskan at night.\nThe northern section was walled and was almost entirely made up of warehouses. The Mirabar District (also known as the Mirabar Shield) was a fortified compound operated by the merchants of Mirabar, and it contained the Throat, the citys heavily guarded main water tower, which was situated in a grazing area for sheep.), was situated on the northern bank, as was the North Gate, the portal between the northern and southern banks. \nThe docks on the northern bank were on the sea coast (western part of the city) and consisted of Whitesails Harbor, used exclusively for the Luskan navy, and the unprotected Open Shore, which was situated outside the city walls and was the only place foreign shipping could dock.\nthumb|300px|The dingy streets of the South Bank.\nAs of 1370 DR, the southern bank consisted of a heavily fortified inner section surrounded by caravan compounds. The southern bank also housed stables, the Captains and High Captains Court, the Market and the Prisoners Carnival, and the towns original harbor, Dragon Beach, a lawless place where even soldiers feared to tread\nSammereza Sulphontis said that traders in Luskan \"always wear furs, haughty expressions, and ready swords.\" Luskanite traders were always alert and well-armed. The people of Luskan always tended to be tense and paranoid—rightly so, because of the dangers of the tough city—and they were extremely prejudiced against non-humans. In fact, few non-humans were allowed past the city gates.\nAs of 1372 DR, the city was officially ruled by the five High Captains, all former pirate lords and each of which led a faction called a \"ship\" named after its respective captain Ship Taerl, Ship Baram, Ship Kurth, Ship Suljack and Ship Rethnor. The true power in the city resided with the Arcane Brotherhood.\nThe High Captains encouraged the harassment of the trading routes of small cities such as Mirabar, Neverwinter, and Ruathym, and made sure to avoid conflict with Waterdeep and Amn because they were too powerful.\nThe Arcane Brotherhood also encouraged local traders to treat travelers with disdain and suspicion, due to the possibility that they may be spies for their enemies, often sending low-level agents to follow strangers personally.\nLuskan was rumored to be allied with the Zhentarim but no evidence of this was ever presented.\nBy 1480 DR there was no true functioning government and gangs (including the Ships of the High Captains) carved out territories within the city.\nSome time after 1485 DR, the five High Captains who ruled the city started to conduct legal sea trade across the Sword Coast. They also protected the city and raided the island kingdoms to the west. Secretly, the High Captains were under the sway of Jarlaxle and the Bregan Daerthe.  \nAlthough Luskan and Ruathym were often enemies, they had an alliance known as the Captains Alliance.\nthumb|Luskan circa 400x400px\nLuskan was the gateway to the lands northward and as such was a perfect market for ore from the Spine of the World and scrimshaw from the Ten Towns in Icewind Dale.\nAs of 1370 DR, Luskan was the main shipyard for Mirabar. Trade with such places as Amn and Calimshan was carried out on the neutral ground offshore from Mintarn because it was not desirable to be associated with Luskan.\nAs of 1370 DR, the citys market only allowed stalls by permit. These were only given to Luskan companies, and those outsiders who were closely watched. The main offerings at the market were fresh goods, firewood and trinkets.\nAfter Bregan Daerthe took over the city, they began trading Netherese artifacts to Menzoberranzan.\nAs of 1370 DR, Luskan had an army of 300 spearmen and a navy of 19 dragonships. The dragonships were each armed with 70 archers. The North Gate was guarded by soldiers with spears and crossbows in the winter they wore fur caps.\nWhile not at war, Luskan ships of war carried out independent piracy against shipping destined for other ports, with the aim of increasing trade with Luskan. While this contravened Luskan law as of 1370 DR, the pirates were actually supplied and directed by the high captains themselves.\nBuilt on the ruins of the ancient and magical city of Illusk, Luskan was a port town frequented by pirates, thieves and other disreputable folk interested in money. Although life within its walls was dangerous, Luskan was a very lucrative city. Pirates brought in their goods to be sold to the black market, northern traders frequented the place as a rest stop on their way to the Ten Towns during the warmer months, ready to buy exotic scrimshaw ornaments, several taverns traded in ale and other spirits, the drugs and slave trades were rife (although obviously sublimated) and information brokers and prostitutes plied their trade during the night-time.\nThere was a period in Luskans history during which dwarves from Mirabar would paint Luskan sheep different colours in acts of defiance, but as of 1370 DR this practice had ended after savage reprisals from the Luskanites.\nLuskan had a history of waging war against lesser naval powers, It withdrew when faced with war against the Lords Alliance. Luskan has previously been defeated by Gundarlun, Lantan, Mintarn, Orlumbor and Tuern. The conflict against Lantan was disastrous enough that inhabitants of Luskan did not even acknowledge its happening. Inland, Luskan would attack Mirabar and the tribes of Uthgardt in order to keep them submissive.\nIn the autumn of 1376 DR Luskan was attacked by an army of mercenaries led by Lord Brambleberry of Waterdeep and aided by the famous Captain Deudermont. The attack destroyed the Hosttower and the grateful populace installed Deudermont as their governor. Although he tried to rebuild as many homes as possible before winter set in, supplies were scarce and most food came via Ship Rethnor in the form of a strange tangy meat and edible fungus. People were being murdered every day for this food and those who werent prepared to kill for it, starved. When supplies from Waterdeep were sent to aid Deudermonts new city the land caravans were attacked by bandits paid for by Ship Rethnor and the fleet of trading ships that was supposed to dock was attacked by Arklem Greeth, who had (unknown to all) survived the Hosttowers destruction. Barely any of the supplies arrived and then Kensidan had Suljack murdered, which sparked off a street war among the hungry masses and guards who had been bribed by Ships Rethnor and Kurth. At the same time Arklem Greeth attacked Sea Sprite. When Deudermonts corpse was found, it was all over. The survivors fled the city, leaving the four remaining captains to rule over the place, though Kensidan and Kurth would dominate Baram and Taerl. Luskan would become a free port, a place of trade where absolutely no questions would ever be asked.\nUnknown to most, much of the resources and intelligence that led to this outcome were provided by Bregan Daerthe who, once more led by Jarlaxle, wanted to share in the profits the free port would hopefully produce.\nIn the years after the Spellplague, Luskan fell into ruin. Over the next century, the rulership of the city changed from hand to claw to hand so many times that it would be nigh-impossible to document them in any kind of detail. The result was a mockery of a true city. Most buildings were ruined and murderers and demon-worshipers roamed the streets freely, plying their trade in broad daylight. Wretched tribes of goblins and kobolds skulked in the shadows and the fetid bog that was once the estuary of the River Mirar was infested with aquatic horrors. The place became a haven for escaped criminals who, while escaping punishment for their crimes would likely die on the end of a psychopaths blade or a monsters claw. Bregan Daerthe continued their semi-secret domination of the city and its trading markets, associating with Ship Kurth. Indeed, one of their agents, Beniago, in guise of a human, became High Captain Kurth.\nIn 1483 DR, the city and its bridges were in disrepair. The Red Dragon Trading Post was no longer in operation, but Balivers House of Horses still was, housing a pony for 3 silver coins per night.\nThe Host Tower of the Arcane was the site of real power in the city until shortly before the Spellplague. In 1372 DR, Arklem Greeth presided over around 130 mages. While delegating laws to the High Captains, the arcanists within partook in their studies and bouts of infighting. The tower itself resembled a tree with four \"limbs\" (spires) and exuded a magical aura that many residents found so uncomfortable that they purposely avoid looking at it.\nThe Cutlass was one of the busiest taverns in the city, a haven for the crews of the pirate ships that docked in the harbor as well as the escorts whom they spend their share of the booty on. The famed barbarian Wulfgar spent some time working here as a bouncer. It was located close to the lawless harbor, the Dragon Beach.\nThe Royal Arms was an expensive and luxurious inn that served only the finest foods and drinks, often favored by rich traders and dignitaries.\nThe Seven Sails Inn was an establishment on Setting Sun Street where one could actually get some sleep. However, it was also a place closely watched by the Arcane Brotherhood.\nThe Prisoners Carnival was Luskans \"court\" of justice, although truly it was just a public spectacle of torture and execution. It was located in the most public part of town the Market.\nRat Alley was narrow alley crowded by trash, such as crates, and lined on both sides by low storehouses. It was the perfect place for thieves in hiding.\nSome of the ruins of the city that Luskan was built atop of still existed until quite recently, namely on the western side of the South Bank not far from the Host Tower of the Arcane. Most folks stayed away from the ruins as wandering undead, restless spirits of Illusk, were known to prey on the drunks and adventurers who got too close to the hidden passageways to the old city. Crumbled walls and moss-grown statues remained. By 1474 DR, Bregan Daerthe had set up their secret headquarters in Illusk, with a path connecting Illusk with Closeguard Isle and Ship Kurth.\nOne-Eyed Jax was a post-Spellplague inn and tavern on the northern bank named for Jarlaxle of Bregan Daerthe. It was overtly owned and protected by Ship Kurth (which was in fact an arm of Bregan Daerthe). It was one of the most reliable inns for foreigners, although it was often populated with drow.\nIn the post-sundering era, the temple of Auril was a great complex adorned with soaring white spires. It had no roof, but was an open court filled with white stone pillars and arches. Its rituals seemed overtly cruel to those not of Aurils faith.\n*One of the most well known rituals were the wet parades. The parades involved the wearing of garments stuffed with ice. While wearing these garments, participants would race through the streets of Luskan to climb six white pillars, called the Kisses of Auril. They would climb the pillars to kiss the iron plates located at the top of each spire. During the winter, frostbite and physical injury are quite common during these climbs due to the ice stuffed clothes and slippery pillars. Those who complete this race are believed to have assuaged Aurils wrath, bringing an easy winter. The participants are given free food and drink all winter long by Luskans inhabitants.\n*Balivers House of Horses, a stablehouse.\n*Bloodrun, Piers, and Reavers Run, Aldevers Street, Half-Moon Street, streets in the city.\n*Calling Conch,  a tavern near the docks that served ale and chowder.\n*Clearlight, a run-down temple to Tymora and base of the Coin Spinners gang.\n*Cliffside Cranny, a hole in the city wall.\n*Drowned Rat, headquarters of the Dead Rats gang.\n*Guildhall of the Order of the Burning Dawn.n-Space (October 2015).
