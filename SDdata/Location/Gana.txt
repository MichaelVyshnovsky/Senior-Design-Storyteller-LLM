'''Gana''', the "'''City of Riches'''," (together with [[Jumlat]]) gave the group of the [[Pearl Cities]] of [[west Zakhara]] their name because [[pearl]] diving was one major source of wealth.

==Trade==
Another source of wealth was from the nearby wasteland to the west called the [[Realm of Bleeding Trees]] where [[frankincense]] and other aromatic [[resin|gums]] could be collected. Trade with these and other commodities gave Gana the well-earned title "City of Riches" as even its lower classes were better off than elsewhere.

==Inhabitants==
Many of Gana's citizens were involved in the pearl diving business which was fully active for five months out of the year.

==Activities==
Gana held the annual [[Festival of the Pearl]] after the close of each pearl diving season. This was followed by the Sultan's [[Great Task of the Pearl]] where bold [[adventurer]]s were challenged with scouring the land in search of wondrous items to present to the Sultan.

==Defenses==
Gana's city watch was comprised of 5,000 soldiers. The city also hired an additional 2,000 mercenaries to serve as infantry. Gana's navy numbered 30 ships in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}} Additionally, Gana's rookery, found east of the city in [[al-Yabki Mountains]], held five highly trained [[Zakharan roc]]s and riders.

Gana was suspected of hiring privateers to harass and hinder pearl diving ventures from rival Jumlat.

==Rumors & Legends==
A bold sea monster was blamed for a string of missing ships sent out to harvest pearls. The Sultan offered a reward of 50,000 [[dinar]]s for anyone brave enough to kill the creature or prove that it did not exist.
