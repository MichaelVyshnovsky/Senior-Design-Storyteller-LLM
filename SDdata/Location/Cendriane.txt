Cendriane was an old eladrin city that existed in both Faer没n and in the Feywild.
In the Feywild, Cendriane was located in the center of a dark forest. In Faer没n, Cendriane was located beside a mountain range, near an orc village.
Cendriane was the biggest and most beautiful city of the eladrin, made of crystal spires.
Cendriane was one of the oldest cities founded by the eladrin in the Feywild. The city was built to allow it to exist in both Faer没n and the Feywild simultaneously.
Cendriane was the site of one of the most vicious battles between the eladrin and the drow, a battle that ultimately destroyed the city.
The city was abandoned shortly thereafter, except for its ruler, the eladrin vampire lord Kannoth. Not long after, the part of the city existing in Faer没n fell to ruin as well.
Sometime after the Spellplague, the shiere knight eladrin Astriana recruited the half-orc druid Haggar to seal the Living Gate.
*Lord Kannoth, an eladrin vampire who ruled the city even after its fall.
*The Living Gate, a portal to the Far Realm located in the Feydark below Cendriane.
