'''Cendriane''' was an old [[eladrin]] city that existed in both [[Faer没n]] and in the [[Feywild]].{{Cite dragon/391/Watchers at the Living Gate|64-65}}

==Location==
In the Feywild, Cendriane was located in the center of a dark forest. In Faer没n, Cendriane was located beside a mountain range, near an [[orc]] village.

==Architecture==
Cendriane was the biggest and most beautiful city of the eladrin, made of crystal spires.

==History==
Cendriane was one of the oldest cities founded by the eladrin in the Feywild. The city was built to allow it to exist in both Faer没n and the Feywild simultaneously.

Cendriane was the site of one of the most vicious [[Crown Wars#Fourth Crown War|battles]] between the eladrin and the [[drow]], a battle that ultimately destroyed the city.{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|18}}

The city was abandoned shortly thereafter, except for its ruler, the eladrin [[vampire]] lord Kannoth. Not long after, the part of the city existing in Faer没n fell to ruin as well.

Sometime after the [[Spellplague]], the [[shiere knight]] eladrin [[Astriana]] recruited the [[half-orc]] [[druid]] [[Haggar]] to seal the [[Living Gate]].

==Notable inhabitants==
*Lord [[Kannoth]], an eladrin vampire who ruled the city even after its fall.

==Notable locations==
*The [[Living Gate]], a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Far Realm]] located in the [[Feydark]] below Cendriane.{{Cite dragon/391/Watchers at the Living Gate|68}}
