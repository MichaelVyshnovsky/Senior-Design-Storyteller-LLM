'''Battlerise''' was a hamlet in southeastern [[Cormyr]] on the [[Way of the Manticore]], situated west of the [[Darkflow River]] and south of the [[Vast Swamp]] close to [[Sembia]].

==Trade==
Besides a small population of [[turnip]] farmers, the [[Margar]] family owned a waystable that was fortified with its own palisade. There the family traded fresh [[horse]]s to travelers in exchange for their road-weary ones, or sold them outright. 

Various nobles attempted throughout the years to rebuild the castle on the hill in order to use it as a base for trade with neighboring [[Sembia]]. However, their efforts were defeated by the presence of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], who had already been using the vaults below the castle as a headquarters for their own sorcerous, clandestine operations. Unbeknownst to the Margars, the Cult also had an agent installed as one of the hired hands working for the family.<ref name=CotD-p115-116>

==History==
Battlerise was named for the nearby hill topped with the ruins of [[Battlegate Castle]], once the seat of the extinct [[Auantiver]] noble family. The hamlet itself was once a larger village, but its population was greatly reduced after it was attacked by monsters raiding out of the Vast Swamp such as [[lizardfolk]].
