It was shaped roughly like a half-circle and had three gates in its wall at west, north, and east. A large area known as [[the Market]] divided Northbank west and east, cutting from the wall to the Docks at the river. There were many shops around the Docks. The [[High Palace]] was located on the eastern side of Northbank, just inside the walls. Most places of worship and the houses of the nobles were also located on the eastern side.\n\nSouthbank was originally an area for caravan business and warehouses, but it expanded to become nearly as large as Northbank and was known for containing most of the schools that were part of the famous [[Conclave of Silverymoon]].\n\nThe city was said to contain [[Dwarf|dwarven]] tunnels beneath its streets.",

Although they were often found protecting the walls of Silverymoon many times they roamed the countryside around the city in a 50-mile radius with a member of the Spellguard.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], recruitment was overseen by [[Recruiting Master]] [[Mazillor Shatterstave]], who scrutinized each potential applicant for suitability among their ranks. Under Mazillor's watch the Knights in Silver rose to 704 members.",
            "Spellguard": "The Spellguard was established in [[1255 DR]] as a personal bodyguard for Alustriel herself but over the intervening years grew to city-wide force, spreading their duties between the [[High Palace]] and the rest of Silverymoon. By [[1372 DR]] the Spellguard numbered 32 members, 7 of which were Warders that oversaw the activities of the rest.",

        "History": "Silverymoon became a city in [[Uktar]] [[637 DR]], when a stone wall was built around it for the first time and the first ruler of Silverymoon, [[High Mage of Silverymoon|High Mage]] [[Ecamane Truesilver]], was elected. Prior to that it was mainly a village of wooden buildings named ''Silver Village''. It was built at a location considered sacred to the patron deity of rangers, [[Mielikki]], and the [[unicorn]] goddess [[Lurue]]. Since that time the settlers sought to work with nature rather than against it, a decision that is said to have compelled the aforementioned deities to bless the site.\n\nEcamane Truesilver was instrumental in setting the foundation to the city's enduring (and totally justified) fame of a center of lore and knowledge throughout the North (often called \"[[Myth Drannor]] of the North\", as it was an echo of the legendary capital of the Elven Court). Truesilver founded a library and subsequent rulers of the city pursued artistic endeavors and further consolidated Silverymoon as a place where art, culture, lore, and magic are highly valued before his death in [[712 DR]]. Ecamane was followed by his nephew, [[Aglanthol|Aglanthol the Red]] as the second High Mage of Silverymoon.  When Myth Drannor fell in [[714 DR]], some prominent scholars found shelter in the city, but they were followed by the demons that destroyed their home. The then reigning High Mage, Aglanthol, perished in the ensuing fight in [[719 DR]]. His successor, [[Ederan Nharimlur]], by contrast, reigned for many years in peace. It was in his reign that the city almost doubled in size.\n\nUpon Ederan's death in [[784 DR]], his daughter [[Amaara Nharimlur]] became the High Mage of Silverymoon. In [[815 DR]], [[Alustriel Silverhand|Elué Dualen]] arrived in the city and befriended Amaara and her sister [[Lynx]]. In [[821 DR]], Elué and Lynx established the [[Lady's College]], the first open school for mages in Silverymoon to take students, not apprentices, and as payment for tutelage required an equal amount of time of service in defense of the city. In [[843 DR]] Elué and other wizards created the Moonbridge, the city's most famous landmark along with the [[wards of Silverymoon]]. Eventually Elué became High Mage in [[857 DR]] after Amaara left for [[Evermeet]]. Elué left the post in [[876 DR]] with Lynx.\n\nThe succession of High Mages was disrupted in [[876 DR]], when the warlord [[Lashtor]], then commander of the city's army, took the city by force, destroying many important buildings and killing many wizards in the process. He could not remain in power for more than a year, however, as he was deposed by [[Tanalanthara Mytersaal]], a mage also known as Lady Wolf. Lady Wolf sacrificed herself in [[882 DR]] while fending off a horde of [[orc]]s.\n\nThe next High Mage was chosen by the people of Silverymoon to be [[Tanisell|Tanisell the Cloaked]], who during his reign strengthened the wards of the city and constructed the [[Vault of the Sages]]. In [[920 DR]] the [[Keeper of the Vault]] of Sages, [[Nunivytt Threskaal]], succeeded Tanisell. Threskaal reigned for over a hundred years in peace until his death during [[1050 DR]]. High Mage [[Orjalun]] was the next to take up the mantle of rulership and oversaw a reign that included the emergence of many famed mages such as [[Ahghairon]] and [[Bowgentle]]. However, another disaster befell Silverymoon in the year [[1150 DR]], a plague against which nearly half the city's inhabitants perished. In [[1230 DR]], Orjalun appointed the next High Mage as [[Sepur]]. After two years Sepur disappeared from the city, resulting in an elected mayor ruling for the next three years.\n\nThe first time that an enemy broke through the walls inside the city, though, was in [[1235 DR]], when the commander of the army, [[Khallos Shieldsunder]], forcibly gained control of the city while under siege by an orc horde. The orcs, as has been stated, managed to enter the city, but the combined forces of the elves and the Harpers led by [[Alustriel Silverhand]] and her sister [[Storm Silverhand]] successfully repelled the attack. \n\nAlustriel subsequently became the city's only ruler to have been unanimously chosen by the people, and the only one to have reigned for so long.\n\nAlustriel's reign officially ended in 1369 DR, when she stepped down, passing the city's supreme office to her trusted adviser Taern \"Thunderspell\" Hornblade. She assumed the title of High Lady of the Silver Marches in [[1371 DR]] (the year the confederation was born) and became the leading figure of authority in the new-found confederation.\n\nWhen the Spellplague struck Silverymoon, it broke the city's mythal. All hope was not lost, however, as this meant it protected the city from the brunt of the Plague's effects.\n\nSilverymoon was involved in the destructive [[War of the Silver Marches]] between [[1484 DR]] and [[1485 DR]], still under Taern's leadership as of 1485 DR.\n\nBy [[1489 DR]], High Mage Taern Hornblade had stepped down as ruler of the city and [[Methrammar Aerasumé]] took over as Lord of Silverymoon. Despite this, Taern still spoke for the city among the [[Lords' Alliance]].",
        "Relationships": {
            "14{{th}} Century": "Silverymoon was the leading city of the [[Luruar|Confederation of the Silver Marches]]. The confederation was new as of the early 1370s DR and some difficulties existed when cooperation was needed. It was a common belief, though, that the cities in the region would fall to the many enemies that surrounded them unless they managed to somehow unite and fight together.<ref>\n\nSilverymoon remained allied with other cities in the North, such as [[Waterdeep]] and [[Neverwinter]], but also had many enemies. The [[Arcane Brotherhood]], a small group of wizards and sorcerers who controlled port city of [[Luskan]] from the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in the 1370's, had the ultimate goal to rule [[the North]]. In fact, the Silver Marches and Silverymoon were considered by the leaders of the brotherhood as their main target in their quest for domination.\n\nEnemies also lurked in the depths of Toril, the [[Underdark]]. In 1358 DR, an army of [[drow]] elves from the city of [[Menzoberranzan]] laid siege to [[Mithral Hall]], a dwarven stronghold under the leadership of King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], and were driven back only with the combined efforts of Mithral Hall and Silverymoon.<ref>"

        "Politics in Silverymoon": "When Alustriel was still in power, the politics of the city flowed smoothly. Legal disputes were delegated over in the morning with spare time left for private appointments with those who request them. In the evening, she declared any new laws or decrees, met with foreign delegations and oversaw policy debates. If these debates went on for too long, she would ask that the arguments be submitted to her in written form and then these would be copied and distributed freely to the citizenry. The public would themselves argue about the matter and then their written opinions were collected the next day and, guided by her own experience, Alustriel would cobble together the final policy.",
