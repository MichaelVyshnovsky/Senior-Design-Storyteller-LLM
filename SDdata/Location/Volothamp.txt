'''Volothamp''' was a city in [[Calimshan]] built upon the side of a cliff overlooking the [[Shining Sea]]. It was famous for a series of statues, called the [[Eight Erehnirs]], from the [[Third Age of Calimshan|Third Age]].

==Geography==
Volothamp was situated between the cities of [[Almraiven]] and [[Manshaka]].

==Trade==
Volothamp was known to have many of the industries typical of coastal settlements, such as shipping, fishing, and shipbuilding. However, their boats were notorious for being low quality.

The city was famed in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] for their jewelers and [[gold]]smiths. The demand for their services led many [[mage]] consortiums to be established there.

==History==
Around [[1357 DR]], the city was known to be occasionally raided by creatures from the [[Spider Swamp]] that were under the command of [[spider]] [[demon]] that wanted to take control over the city. Some prestigious members of both the city's society and government were reluctant to confront this issue, as they had been ''[[charm]]ed'' by the demon.
