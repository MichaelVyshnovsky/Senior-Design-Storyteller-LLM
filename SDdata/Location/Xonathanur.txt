Xonathanur was an ancient kingdom of shield dwarves that once lay in the Underdark of northern Faerûn.
Xonathanurs holdings were far reaching. They included Mardaruk, a community in the Lowerdark that mined high-quality adamantine ores.
Xonathanur, like its contemporaries Oghrann and Gharraghaur, stood firm in the millennia before Dalereckoning. They were considered to be examples to the other, less civilized races of Faerûn in how to hold and wield power. They distrusted magic so, while they never rose to the heights of arcane power like Netheril and Imaskar, they never suffered the catastrophes they did either.
Ultimately, however, endless goblin wars led to Xonathanurs downfall. Those few shield dwarves who remained lived as Wanderers, rootless nomads of the dwarves. Many of ventured into the World Above and never returned.
In the late 14 century DR, a shield dwarven enclave in the Western Heartlands, inhabited by descendants of Xonathanur, found its mithral and silver mines running out. They desperately sought a replacement for their ailing mining industry to prevent their people moving away and again being scattered. A dwarf bard proposed they reclaim the Lost Mines of Mardaruk, their birthright. After much research and exploratory searching, they uncovered a non-yet-collapsed section and dispatched a mining expedition, by means of a limited-use two-way portal.
