Haelimbrars Watch was the name given to the well-patrolled western border of Impiltur at the pass where the Earthfast Mountains and Earthspur Mountains met.
The border lay just west of the city of Laviguer and the town of Vordric Dun, both of which also lay within the pass where the Earthfasts met the Earthspurs. The southern end of the border was anchored by Tower Ithfell.
The name was in reference to Haelimbrar, a member of the Lords of Imphras II, who was charged with patrolling the area in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. This border was the farthest point from Impilturs main cities to be included in the patrols of the Heralds of Imphras II.
