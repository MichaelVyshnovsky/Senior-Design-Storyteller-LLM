'''Haelimbrar's Watch''' was the name given to the well-patrolled western border of [[Impiltur]] at the pass where the [[Earthfast Mountains]] and [[Earthspur Mountains]] met.

==Geography==
The border lay just west of the city of [[Laviguer]] and the town of [[Vordric Dun]], both of which also lay within the pass where the Earthfasts met the Earthspurs. The southern end of the border was anchored by [[Tower Ithfell]].

==History==
The name was in reference to [[Haelimbrar]], a member of the [[Lords of Imphras II]], who was charged with patrolling the area in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. This border was the farthest point from Impiltur's main cities to be included in the patrols of the [[Heralds of Imphras II]].
