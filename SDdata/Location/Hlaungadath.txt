Hlaungadath was a ruined city lying in the desert of northwestern Anauroch. Hlaungadath was the remnants of a formerly great city of Netheril. The city landed near the High Ice and was eventually abandoned, but the ruins remained largely intact.
It was some 40 to 50 miles from either the Graypeak Mountains or Nether Mountains.
Hlaungadath was the destination of a hidden portal in the Dangling Tower in Ched Nasad.
Hlaungadaths architecture was clearly Netherese, with square column bases and pointed arched windows. The city was filled with ruined domes, colonnades, ramparts, and towers.
The ruins of the city were inhabited by lamias with their thralls manticores, asabi, and gargoyles.
* Ruins of the High Hall of Justice On the facade there was still text in Netherese meaning "In Truths Light No Lies Abide."
