The Palace Quarter was one of the four quarters of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Palace Quarter encompassed the Affluent District, Court District, and the East District, forming most of the central and southeast portions of the city. This quarter was the home of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in Huzuz, from the Grand Caliph and his court to lavish merchant families and the mysterious White Agate.
