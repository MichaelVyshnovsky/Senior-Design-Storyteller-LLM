        "mainbody": "Lith was a small island in the Pirate Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars. \nThe island of Lith sat between Hawks Isle in the west and Lurath in the east.\nThere were no natural harbors on the island.\nLith was never settled by the pirates of the isles. A brood of ravenous neogi dominated the island. Though Lith lacked umber hulks for the neogi to enslave, their powers appeared to work on the natural animals of the island which were used as the neogi desired.\nLith was directly involved in the poetic naming of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Hundreds of years ago sages witnessed stars falling from the sky above the Pirate Isles. Research teams were sent to investigate and discover the landing spot, but none returned. The falling star was actually a crashing neogi broodship that was badly damaged in a struggle with a Shou dragonship. The neogi crashed on Lith and quickly made the island a new lair."
