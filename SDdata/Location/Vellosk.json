        "mainbody": "'''Vellosk''' was a settlement of the [[Uthgardt]] [[Gray Wolf tribe]] located in [[Neverwinter Wood]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "Vellosk was situated on the eastern edge of Neverwinter Wood, along the [[Starmetal Hills]]. It lay due north of [[Berun's River]].",
        "Description": "Owing to the nomadic nature of the Gray Wolves, Vellosk was little more than a collection of simple tents and lean-tos, with very few permanent buildings.",
        "Government": "One Gray Wolf pack leader was always present in Vellosk. Since the pack leaders preferred staying out in the wild, this responsibility was seen as a burden, and was swapped between them on a monthly basis.",
        "History": "When the [[Netheril|Netherese]] flying city of [[Xinlenal]] fell into Neverwinter Wood in {{Yearlink|-339}}, a group of [[wizard]]s split off part of the city and landed it in a different area of the forest. Isolated from Xinlenal, the wizards formed their own enclave, naming it [[Xin'kar]].\n\nOver time, the Netherese were driven out of the area by the Gray Wolf tribe. The Uthgardt barbarians named their new settlement Vellosk.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Gray Wolf tribe issued a challenge to all [[adventurer]]s in the [[Sword Coast]] that had proven themselves in battle to test their mettle within the totem pit of Vellosk.",
        "Notable Locations": "[[File:Vellosk totem pit.jpg|thumb|''Ritual combat at the Totem Pit.'']]\n;[[Gray Wolf Den]]\nA massive rock carved to resemble a wolf's head. The Gray Wolves revered it as a place of great power.\n\n;Shadowkeeper's Hut\nOne of the settlement's few permanent structures. Around [[1479 DR]], it was occupied by [[Ormshas]], liasion between the Gray Wolf tribe and the [[Shadovar]].\n\n;Totem Pit\nA holy site where the Gray Wolves offered prayers and sacrifices to [[Uthgar]] and various primal spirits. Ceremonial combat was also conducted here, such as when leaders were challenged for position. On its eastern edge stood a totem pole decorated with skulls&mdash;both beast and humanoid&mdash;many of them carved with images of Uthgar. The totem pole was topped with a [[dire wolf]] skull.",
        "Inhabitants": "Vellosk was usually sparsely populated, due to the nomadic inclinations of the Gray Wolves. Most tribe members were either camped out in the woods or participating in hunts or raids."
