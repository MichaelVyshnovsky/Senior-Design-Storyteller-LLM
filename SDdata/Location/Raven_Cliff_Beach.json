        "mainbody": "Raven Cliff Beach was a stretch of coastland on the Sword Coast North that was long-associated with criminal groups such as dreadful pirates and murderous bandits.\nThe beach was located west of Neverwinter Wood, some ways of north of the city of Neverwinter.\nIt featured a network of rather spacious sea caves that were regularly used by smugglers and other lawbreakers.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the beach and surrounding coastland was ravaged by pirate raids led by Traven Blackdagger.\nSome time round the , the beach was again overrun with the activity of neer-do-wells associated with the Blackdaggers. The culprits then were the Blackdagger bandits led by the vicious Jareth Grim, who led the groups raids on behalf of the undead Traven Blackdagger, who had been risen as a skeletal pirate captain by the Red Wizard Kallos Tam.\nAlso around that time, Marion Hexbane set up operations within the sea caves set into beachs cliff face.\nThe bandits activities were thwarted by the combined efforts of the Harpers Seven Toes, Garl Gnarlclaw, and Xalliana, and their ally, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge.\nIn addition to these two landmarks, the cliffs overlooking the beach were dotted with a number of small lighthouses.\n* Broken Crown, a small establishment owned and run by Gorun Pricebreaker.\n* Cragmire Keep, the ruined keep of the noble Cragmire family was taken over by the Blackdagger Bandits.\n* Hidden Cove, a beachside cavern that opened up to an underground lake.\n* Old Lenn, a retired lighthouse keeper."
