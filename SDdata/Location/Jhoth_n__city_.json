Within the palace, which was guarded by the last Prince of Jhothûn, were three portals, one to each of the three seats of the satrapies of the empire&mdashKarffbadh, Choshein, and Gharreil. For a great multitude of centuries after the fall of the empire, the qorrash princes recruited guardians for the magical portals to protect the history and treasures remaining within the palace and hoping for the return of a royal descendant to restore the empire.\nThe palace was filled with great riches and artifacts of both history and magic&mdashmostly giant-sized ones that did not resize to fit smaller users."
