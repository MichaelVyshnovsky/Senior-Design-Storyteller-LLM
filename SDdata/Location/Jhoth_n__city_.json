        "Description": "Jhothûn was once an impressive city full of towers of crystal.",
        "Geography": "The city was located somewhere in the [[Endless Ice Sea]], built within a valley carved from the solid ice.",
        "Government": "The city was ruled by the emperor of Jhothûn with the assistance of the [[princes of Jhothûn]], who were each [[qorrashi]] advisers.",
        "History": "The city of Jhothûn flourished as the capital of its empire long before the first kingdoms of [[Elf|elves]].It is suspected that Jhothûn was itself a part of the empire of [[Ostoria]], but this is never directly stated.",
        "Inhabitants": "The city was once populated by the ancestors of the [[frost giant]]s, who, with the help of the qorrash, developed great magics, even shaping the weather to remain cold to their liking.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the only inhabitant of the once great city was the last remaining [[Prince of Jhothûn]].",
        "Notable Locations": "The royal palace of the Emperors was the only building to last into the fourteenth century [[DR]]. Within the palace, which was guarded by the last Prince of Jhothûn, were three [[portal]]s, one to each of the three seats of the [[wikipedia:en:Satrap|satrapies]] of the empire&mdash;[[Karffbadh]], [[Choshein]], and [[Gharreil]]. For a great multitude of centuries after the fall of the empire, the qorrash princes recruited guardians for the magical [[portal]]s to protect the history and treasures remaining within the palace and hoping for the return of a royal descendant to restore the empire.\n\nThe palace was filled with great riches and [[artifact]]s of both history and magic&mdash;mostly giant-sized ones that did not resize to fit smaller users."
