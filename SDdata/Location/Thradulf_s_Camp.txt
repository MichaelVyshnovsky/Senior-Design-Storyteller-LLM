'''Thradulf's Camp''' was located in the southwestern region of the [[Cold Wood]] and was ruled by the cruel [[Thradulf Longfang]], [[wikipedia:chieftain|chieftain]] of the [[Red Tiger Tribe]].

==History==
Thradulf became leader of the Red Tiger tribe in [[1368 DR]] succeeding [[Adalwulf Longfang]], a wise leader who ruled his tribe long and well. Before this time, the Red Tigers were a solitary tribe, but under Thradulf's rule, a darker side of the tribe was born.

==Inhabitants==
Thradulf's camp was the largest gathering of Red Tigers. His followers hunted and gathered in the Cold Wood region during the wintertime and moved north to the [[Druarwood]] in the summer season.
