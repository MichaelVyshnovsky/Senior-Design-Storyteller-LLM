Cormanthor, also known as the Old City, formerly as Ahkiilor or "place of duty", was the oldest ward in the city of Myth Drannor.
The ward was the seat of power for the Coronal of Cormanthyr, along with the arms-major and spell-major, commanders of the AkhVelahr and AkhFaer respectively.
Along with these military leads, the ward served as home to many of the citys high mages, as well as its noble families. Among the many noble elven families that kept an estate in the city were the houses Ammath, Dahast, Hawksong, Irithyl, Khaalvandar, Maerdrym, Mistrivvin, Moonglamer, Neirdre, Omberdawn, Raedrimn, Silverspear, Starym, and Ulondarr.
While there were no official regulations that excluded non-elves from the ward, many of the Old Citys residents took action to keep them away from the area. The noble elves took subtle actions to make those residents unwelcome, while the amrathors of the Coronal Guard enforced an unofficial curfew, by escorting non-elves from the ward in the hours after dusk.
The Old City was located on the northern side of the city, adjacent to the citys other wards.
It was bordered to the south and west by the Street of Evening Star, and the east by the Bridge of Heroes.
The ward included the stretch of Oacenths stream north of Tilvers dam.
