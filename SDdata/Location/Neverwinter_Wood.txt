The western region of the Neverwinter Wood was known as the Watchers Forest, so named for its sacredness amongst the Helmite priests of the region. It was tended to by his devout followers that lived in Helms Hold, and even held an entranceway into the subterranean Crypts of the Vigilant Eye.
The Neverwinter River ran through an area of the forests. Notable hills and mountains within included Beruns Hill and the Crags, within which lay the famous Mount Hotenow.
Abundant whitethistle shrubbery grew throughout the Neverwinter Wood. If consumed, the plant was known to give someone the runs. Shederran were a highly valuable species of trees found only within Neverwinter Wood. They were highly sought after for their use in crafting the highest quality bows and crossbows.

This forest was originally called Llewyrrwood by the elves of the region, and it came to be a colony for those fair folk of Illefarn. When Aryvandaar annexed both Illefarn and the Llewyrrwood in , many of the residents fled to Shantel Othreier. Some stayed for a century, living under the yoke of the Vyshantaar until the queen of the Llewyrr, Synnoria, led a large force of her people out of their lands and across the Trackless Sea to the Moonshae Isles, where they established the kingdom of Synnoria in her honor.
The Llewyrrwood was occupied once more when the realm of Illefarn was reformed. Circa , the last Coronal of Illefarn, Syglaeth Audark, decided to take his people to Evermeet.
Again, some chose to remain in the Llewyrrwood, and formed the realm of Iliyanbruen. The elven realm of Illiyanbruen persisted until 177 DR when the last of its moon elves traveled to Evermeet and Ardeep in Faer√ªn, or left for the Feywild to form the colony of New Sharandar.
As of 1374 DR, elves still lived in the wood, though they made up one of the largest cells of the Eldreth Veluuthra, with other smaller cells operating in the surrounding area.
After the Spellplague of 1385 DR, Neverwinter Wood experienced a mass migration of fey from the Feywild. Elves and eladrin were also drawn to the woods in large numbers and they attempted to re-found Iliyanbruen near the ruins of Old Sharandar. Though they had to defeat a force of dark fey to reclaim their ancestral home, they quickly went about establishing the military outpost of New Sharandar, around the Fey Crossing connected to the greater settlement of the same name in Feywild.
Following the rise of Forge Fitzwilliam as Lord of Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR, the wood elves of Neverwinter Wood questioned his legitimacy, and in retaliation he ordered clear cutting of the Wood and executions of elves and their allies among the Emerald Enclave.
It was said that Helm himself spent a single day in the western stretch of the forest during the Time of Troubles, meditating upon his guardianship of the Celestial Stairway.

The Neverwinter Wood had a circle of druids, the Ring of Swords, who worked to drive out hobgoblins, gnolls, and bugbears from the woods, as well as protect its ancient sites from treasure seekers.
