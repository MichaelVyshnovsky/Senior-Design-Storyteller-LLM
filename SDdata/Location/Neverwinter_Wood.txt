The western region of the Neverwinter Wood was known as the Watchers Forest, so named for its sacredness amongst the Helmite priests of the region. It was tended to by his devout followers that lived in Helms Hold, and even held an entranceway into the subterranean Crypts of the Vigilant Eye.
The Neverwinter River ran through an area of the forests. Notable hills and mountains within included Beruns Hill and the Crags, within which lay the famous Mount Hotenow.
