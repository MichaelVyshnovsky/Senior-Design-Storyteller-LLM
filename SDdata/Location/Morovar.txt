Morovar was a larger town found in the Barony of Morov in Damara.
Morovar sat on the eastern bank of the Goliad River in the southwest corner of Morov.
Once the capital of the barony, Morov was on the decline in the 1350s DR. This was a direct result of Dimian Ree moving his seat of power to Heliogabalus. Many of Morovars wealthy nobles abandoned the city to follow their lord, taking much of Morovars spirit with them.
Morovars lack of a firm ruler left them nearly helpless when faced with a conflict since the local militia was painfully slow to organize.
Many of Morovars citizens felt scorned by their lords departure and secretly dreamed of allying with Brandiar.
