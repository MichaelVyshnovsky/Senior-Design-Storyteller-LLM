        "mainbody": "The Caliphs Harbor was located in Huzuz, the City of Delights, along the banks of Al-Sarif River.\nThis harbor housed the personal barge of the Grand Caliph as well as the admirality of Huzuz.\nThe Grand Caliphs barge was maintained in a state of constant readiness, since none knew when he would wish to take a sporadic trip.\nExtensive repair facilities performed maintenance on at least five ships at any given time. At least a dozen launches provided access from the repair areas to the harbor.\nKeyfa al-Parid was the harbor master of the Caliphs Harbor in 1367 DR."
