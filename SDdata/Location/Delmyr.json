        "Geography": "This realm was confined to the woods and the eastern flank of the [[Glittering Spires]] mountain range.",
        "Government": "[[File:Dragon269-Ron Spencer-DelmyrDefense.png|thumb|right|270px|''Various monster skeletons mounted at the borders to warn off trespassers.'']]\nAs of 1370 DR, the king of Delmyr was [[Joroelner Gleddyn]]. There were six noble families, each represented by a baron, that constantly vied for the throne, but the tenor of their competition was non-violent, respectful, and good-natured. To the world outside their borders, they kept a low profile and a watchful eye. They just wanted to be left alone.\n\nThe six baronies were:\n* The [[Ambrutter family]]\n* The [[Belrowhin family]]\n* The [[Daerove family]]\n* The [[Mazron family]]\n* The [[Slaunadda family]]\n* The [[Velmairn family]]",
        "Trade": "The Delmyrans lived in harmony with nature in simple, underground dwellings, and only planted what they needed, using forest clearings for patches of [[melon]]s, shallow root caves for [[mushroom]]s, and the mountainous slopes for growing [[grape]]s, [[bean]]s, and [[marrow]]s. They traded food and [[wine]] to the [[gnomes]] that lived in the Glittering Spires and received [[wire]] and other products made of metal in return.",
        "Defenses": "The hin of Delmyr were quite skilled with the [[sling]] and [[crossbow]], able to pick off birds and deer that scavenged their crops. They were no stranger to bigger threats, as evidenced by the many monster skeletons that decorated the border to their land. Some of their trophies included [[behir]], a [[bulette]], [[peryton]]s, [[wyvern]]s, and even a [[dragon]]. They also had alliances or relations with a few [[human]] [[wizard]]s that lived a reclusive life in the remote region. There was also an entity that they named \"[[the Vigilant]]\" that could be called upon in times of dire need. Its nature and identity were a well-kept secret.\n{{Fq|float=right|text=Adventurers take note: \"the Vigilant\" is well-named, and powerful enough to best almost all adventuring bands of which I've ever taken the measure.|source=[[Elminster]], the Sage of Shadowdale}}",
        "History": "The [[Parradyne family]] held the throne of Delmyr for nearly a millennium before the bloodline faltered and the [[Gleddyn family]] succeeded them. Joroelner was the second Gleddyn to rule as King."
