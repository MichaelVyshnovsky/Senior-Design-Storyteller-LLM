        "mainbody": "'''Druindar's Rock''' was a rocky outcropping somewhere in [[Cormanthor]], and a favored zone for [[elves]] to spell-duel.",
        "Description": "The rocky formation rose over the treetops of [[Cormanthor]]. The formation was wooded on top, but it had a narrow projection that had no greenery on it.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|173, 184, 190|9}}",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|241}}, [[Delmuth Echorn]] lured [[Elminster Aumar]], recently knighted an [[armathor]], to Druindar's Rock for a spell-duel. [[Galan Goadulphyn]] and [[Athtar Nlossae]] rushed to the mountain during the duel, concerned that Galan's cache would be revealed or buried; a tree nearly fell upon them. Ultimately, fallout from the battle wound up slaying Athtar and causing Galan to fall while climbing.",
        "Reputation": "To the [[Srinshee]], that was the most likely place for a spellbattle or moot, if a Cormathan challenged another."
