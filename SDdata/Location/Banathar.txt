'''Banathar''', also called '''Banthar''', was a small mining village in [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|24}}{{Cite polyhedron/104/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Country Treasures|7}}

==Geography==
The humble village of Banathar was located on the southern border of Turmish, on the slopes of the [[Aphrunn Mountains]]. Banathar was connected to the city of [[Merrydell]] by a small trail and lay south of the [[Turmway]]. Historically, Banathar served as a waystop on the [[Lilit Pass]] trail.

==History==
Banathar began its life as a brigands' stronghold. But by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the stronghold was abandoned and the village took on a new identity as a sleepy mining and [[sheep]]-herding village.

Sometime ''circa'' [[1358 DR]], an [[adventurer]] descended into a local cellar and discovered a sack of precious [[rubies]].

==Notable Locations==
Despite Banathar's diminutive size, the town held a shrine to [[Silvanus]], like many of the smaller villages of the Vilhon Reach.

==Rumors & Legends==
There were many stories that claimed that the bandits who settled Banathar left behind countless buried treasures, there for adventurers' picking. Over the village's history, many [[coin]]-filled [[leather]] satchels had been discovered around the village, with the finding of the rubies being the most significant by [[1370 DR]].
