The Three Tors was a rock formation found near Aithelar in the kingdom of Callidyrr on Alaron in the Moonshae Isles.
The Three Tors were found just south of Aithelar along the southern edge of the Southflow Marsh. The rocky hills formed a small diagonal barrier extending inland from the coast of the Sea of Moonshae.
