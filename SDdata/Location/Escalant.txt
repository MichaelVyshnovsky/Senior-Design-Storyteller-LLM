'''Escalant''' was a coastal city situated on the mouth of the [[River Lapendrar]] located within the [[Lapendrar|tharch of same name]] in the [[East Faer√ªn|eastern]] nation of [[Thay]].{{Cite web/FRmap}} While it was previously independent and allied with other port city-states in the region, Escalant was intermittently under Thayan control during the 350 years leading up to the [[Spellplague]]. 

It served as one of the nation's most important sea ports, trailing the great metropolis of [[Bezantur]] in terms of influence. It was quite prosperous and its docks were regularly visited with ships from [[Chessenta]], [[Mulhorand]], [[Turmish]] and beyond.

==Description==
While Escalant was originally built within the confines of a strong wall, the sprawling city grew well outward and it was left in near ruins. The streets of the city were lined with warehouses, apartment buildings and shipping facilities that extended over a mile (1.6 km) inland from the docks.

==Government==
For years, Escalant maintained a loose association with [[Delthuntle]], [[Laothkund]], [[Lasdur]], [[Murbant]], [[Nethra]], [[Taskaunt]], [[Teth]], and [[Thasselen]], an alliance known as the [[Cities of the North Coast]]. The cities formed this union to ensure their mutual defense and improve trade.

While Escalant was under the control of Thay it was seldom interfered with by the ruling tharchion, [[Hezass Nymar]], provided the city's taxes were collected in a timely manner. 

===Defense===
Escalant was defended by a militia comprising troops hired as mercenaries. These forces were supplemented by human and [[gnoll]] legionnaires.

==History==
Escalant was first settled by colonists from the realm of [[Unther]] around the year [[400 DR]].

Sometime during its history, Escalant had at one point been completely burned to the ground.

While influence from Thay continued into the 14{{th}} century, the outbreak of the [[Great Inner Sea plague]] of [[1320 DR]] led to great social turmoil and Escalant stood defiant and maintained their independence. While they held strong for over a generation, the Red Wizards marched on the city once again in [[1357 DR]], allied with beings from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. The [[Salamander War]] was catastrophic to the cities of the coast. While Escalant survived the onslaught, they eventually surrendered to the [[Red Wizards]] and the extra-planar [[salamander]]s and the city once again fell under Thayan dominion.
