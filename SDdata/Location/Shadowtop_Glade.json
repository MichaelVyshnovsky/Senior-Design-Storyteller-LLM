        "Inhabitants": "A group of about fifty followers of Eilistraeen, [[drow]] and other [[elf|elves]], dwelt in the shrine.",
        "Activities": "The worshipers of Eilistraee of the Shadowtop Glade were creating a surface home there and had good relations with local humans, whom they aided when ill. \n\nEilistraeen priestesses and moon-worshiping [[lycanthropes]] from the nearby [[Howling Hill]] joined together in sacred hunts to Eilistraee and [[Selûne]] when the moon was full.",
