'''Hundelstone''' was a trade town of 1,200 [[gnome]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[human]]s located at the western edge of the [[Spine of the World]] along the [[Ten Trail]].

==Description==
The town's buildings were built low to the ground, with the majority of living space consisting of cellar rooms cut into the rock. In [[1366 DR]], there were five guesthouses that housed visitors and travelers stuck for the winter because of bad weather in the pass; these guesthouses specialized in dishes made from the plentiful [[hare|rock hares]] in the area, namely jugged hare, hare stew, curried skewered hare, and fried spiced hare.

Most of the dwarves and gnomes were miners, while most of the humans served as monster slayers (gaining a monthly salary of 100 [[gold piece]]s plus 25 gold pieces per monster head), guides and guards to the caravans, or hunters (namely of [[wolves]], raptors, [[crag cat]]s, and the ever-plentiful rock [[hare]]s).

==Relationships==
The neighboring dwarves of [[Ironmaster]] blindfolded non-dwarven intruders in their homeland and forced them through underground passages to Hundelstone, releasing them at night in rough, unfamiliar terrain.

==Trade==

Hundelstone lay along the major trade route, known as the Ten Trail, which connected [[Fireshear]] in the south to the [[Ten Towns]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. The neighboring dwarves of Ironmaster used underground routes and secret surface caves near Hundelstone for their trading. The town was also home to 100 smiths that produced all manner of iron wares.

==History==
Hundelstone was named for [[Hundel Hurler-of-Hammers]], a dwarven smith whose tomb was said to be located in a cave in the mountains guarded by two lightning-throwing [[warhammer]]s.
