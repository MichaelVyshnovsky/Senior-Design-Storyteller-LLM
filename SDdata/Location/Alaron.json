        "mainbody": "Alaron, also known as Westshae,\nThe southern part of Alaron was grassy low hills and dales, fertile land ideal for farming. The capital, and largest city on the island, was Caer Callidyrr. It was located on the northern edge of Dernall Forest. The island was roughly divided in half by the Fairheight Mountains.\nThe southern half of the island was home to the Ffolk, while the northern half of the island was home of the Northlander kingdom of Gnarhelm.\nDernall Forest teemed with goblins and evil fey. Druids loyal to King Derid waged war with the humanoids.\nThe Fairheight Mountains were home to the dwarven clans Rustfire and Rookoath, who were at war with the dark fey and a shadow dragon.\nLlewyrr and unicorns lived in the isolated wilderness of the island.\nAlaron was considered the most powerful island prior to the Spellplague. In the 14 century DR, the Isles were collectively ruled from the capital city of Caer Callidyrr by High King Tristan Kendrick and then his daughter, the High Queen Alicia Kendrick. By 1479 DR, the acting ruler of Alaron was a descendant of Alicia, Derid Kendrick. Alaron was House Kendricks last bastion of a once great empire among the Isles.\nWhile the capital was a port on the eastern side of Alaron, the castle from which the Kendrick family ruled was actually built by the first High King of Moonshae, Cymrych Hugh.\nThe island was once populated only by the Llewyrr. When humans first migrated to the Moonshaes, they settled on Alaron first before slowly spreading to the other islands. Over time, the humans settled over most of the island, with the Llewyrr pushed into the wilder parts of the island.\nKythyss \nThis small city of fishermen and woodcutters was a hotbed of intrigue. When the High King was unable to protect the residents they hired mercenaries. The mercenaries were in league with Amn and, as of 1479 DR, the Amnians had effective control over the city."
