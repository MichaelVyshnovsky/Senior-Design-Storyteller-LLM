Traitors Isle was an unoccupied island that formed one of the two islands of Prespur in the Sea of Fallen Stars.
The only site of interest was the Tower of Stars, created and used by Jorunhast, former Royal Wizard of Cormyr. The islands coastline was jagged and rocky, making travel there by boat extremely difficult and hazardous.
