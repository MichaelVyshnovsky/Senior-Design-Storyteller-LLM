'''Traitor's Isle''' was an unoccupied island that formed one of the two islands of [[Prespur]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

The only site of interest was the [[Tower of Stars]], created and used by [[Jorunhast]], former Royal Wizard of [[Cormyr]]. The island's coastline was jagged and rocky, making travel there by boat extremely difficult and hazardous.
