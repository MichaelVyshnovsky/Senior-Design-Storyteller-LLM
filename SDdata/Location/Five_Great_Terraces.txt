The Five Great Terraces was a large enclosure found in Manass in Khazari.
A graveled square surrounded the Five Great Terraces, which were stacked upon one another. Barracks for troops were positioned along three of the sides.
The governor of Manass used this area to review his troops as well as entertain elite guests and dignitaries. It was a crime to visit the Five Great Terraces unless specifically invited by the governor.
