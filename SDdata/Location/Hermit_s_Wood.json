        "mainbody": "ermits Wood was a large forest in southern Cormyr, lying southwest of Wheloon and east of the Wyvernflow.\nDuring the life of King Azoun II (1001â€“1056 DR), a hermit was the first person to dwell in the forest, giving it its name.\nBy 1372 DR the Hullack Forest, the Kings Forest, and Hermits Wood were almost all that remained of the southern reaches of Cormanthor in Cormyr, having been pushed back significantly during the prosperous reign of Azoun IV.\nLocal Cormyreans often foraged, hunted, and logged at the fringes of Hermits Wood in the 14th century DR. Game was plentiful here, and it had been heavily cut for timber.\nBar visiting humans, no sentient beings actually lived within the forest.\nThe village of Blustich lay at the edge of Hermits Wood, on the western bank of the Wyvernflow. The villagers hunted and foraged in the forest.\nThe settlement of Onguls Water lay in a wooded valley on the northwest side of the wood. Some of the braver folk hunted in Hermits Wood, and worked as guides to visitors, but knew much less about the forest than they let on.\nHickory trees grew in the forest. The nuts were gathered by the inhabitants of Blustich.\nHermit berries found growing around the wood could be used to ward off kelpies.\nA breed of toad found near Hermits Wood had the power to see invisible creatures.\nThe ghost of a gray-cloaked or gray-robed old man with a lantern that shone with an unnatural blue- or azure-colored light was said to haunt the wood, appearing at night under a full moon. However, it was hard to find anyone who claimed to have seen it with their own eyes, despite the regular human presence there. Many wondered at the ghosts origin, and whether it even existed or not. The most popular story was that the ghost was of the hermit, who supposedly met some dreadful and unnatural end there, and that the cause might yet lie somewhere in the wood. Some attributed the lack of habitation to this, claiming non-humans had the good sense or instinct not to live there. Again, no actual incidents were ever recorded. Skeptics said it was all fiction, or the sighting of will-o-the-wisps."
