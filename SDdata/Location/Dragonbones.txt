}}The '''Dragonbones''' was a seemingly bottomless gulf located in [[Fimbrul]], where all [[dragon]]s in [[Laerakond]] went to die.

==History==
It was believed that dying dragons went to Dragonbones and killed themselves by crashing against the gulf, mingling their bones with those of long-dead dragons. When dragons were found dead in other regions of Laerakond, people would often pick up one of its scales and go to Dragonbones to cast it down for good luck.

==History==
As of [[1479 DR]], no [[spellcaster]] had been able to use up the powerful [[arcane]] energies that suffused the Dragonbones.
