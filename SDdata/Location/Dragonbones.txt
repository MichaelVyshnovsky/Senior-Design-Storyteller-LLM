The Dragonbones was a seemingly bottomless gulf located in Fimbrul, where all dragons in Laerakond went to die.
It was believed that dying dragons went to Dragonbones and killed themselves by crashing against the gulf, mingling their bones with those of long-dead dragons. When dragons were found dead in other regions of Laerakond, people would often pick up one of its scales and go to Dragonbones to cast it down for good luck.
As of 1479 DR, no spellcaster had been able to use up the powerful arcane energies that suffused the Dragonbones.
