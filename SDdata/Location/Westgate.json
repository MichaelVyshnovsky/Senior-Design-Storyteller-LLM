        "mainbody": "Westgate was a seedy and squalid metropolis—with a history in piracy, powerful crime syndicates, and nameless vampiric crime-lords. Westgate thrived on black-market trade and corruption, and was perhaps one of the most sordid cities in all of Faerûn. The legacy of scoundrels and spies was found in every alley, and danger lurked for the unprepared in every corner. Despite this, it was the largest and most powerful city on the Dragon Coast.\nIt was an open city that welcomed all travelers and citizens alike as long as they abided by the local laws and, of course, had enough coin.\nIt was probably the oldest, richest and most corrupt port on the Sea of Fallen Stars. It received the nickname \"Gateway to the West\" from its role as the Inner Seas most prolific port city.\nWesthavians tolerated the worship of a wide variety of gods, including evil gods, and were proud of their openness. The citys corruption extended to religious matters also, with clerics of some temples secretly pocketing donations. Many temples were all too happy to sell spellcasting services or healing potions to adventurers, as a way to earn coin.\nA person from Westgate was known as a Westar or a Westhavian.\nOne local chapbook of note was a mean-spirited Ambriturs Whip. The publication was penned by anonymous contributors and focused on negative coverage of local establishments and events, as well as spreading gossip and rumors.\nThis area of the Dragon Coast was first settled by humans from the Vilhon Reach roughly 1,000 years before the Standing Stone was erected in Cormanthor. The largest settlment was the human town of Westgate, ruled cruelly by the great topaz dragon Kisonraathiisar.\nIn the , Saldrinar destroyed Kisonraathiisar and became Westgates first human king.\nIn the , the vampire Orlak and a small army of mercenaries captured the city in a single night. Orlak proclaimed himself the Night King and ruled until he is defeated by a group of Lathander-worshiping paladins in the .\nIn the , pirates from the Pirate Isles invaded Westgate and began the 200-year-long reign of the Pirate Kings.\nIn the  the Chondathan mercenary captain Mulsantir Illistine attacked Westgate and overthrew the pirate kings.\nIn the , Westgate faced unrest caused by a guild war between the infamous Night Masks and a new organization knows as the Ebon Claws. The two gangs erupted the streets of Westgate in violence at night so new visitors to the city were warned.\nAfter the Spellplague, the Sea of Fallen Stars began to drain into the Underdark. The lower water level caused the shoreline to recede and, for a time, the harbor of Westgate was left high and dry. The docks were rebuilt on the new shoreline and the new dock area was known as Tidetown.\nWith the rise of the Abolethic Sovereignty, Westgate came to be known as the only port on the Sea of Fallen Stars that had never come under attack from the aboleths. By the late 15 century DR, this had led to rumors of dark deals having been made to ensure the citys safety,  and indeed it did seem to enjoy some measure of special protection.\nDuring the Second Sundering the Great Rain caused the level of the Sea of Fallen Stars to rise, making flooding in Westgate commonplace. These tidal floods caused many structures to collapse, which in turn revealed the formerly hidden entrances to dungeons built in Tidetown.\nAround the , following the collapse of the Shadovar-controlled Sembians, the primary foe of Westgate was Cormyr.\n Pigeon pinch An ambush during which a courier is attacked by two groups of enemies one to distract the target and its allies, the other to steal whatever its carrying.\n* Bent Mermaid Inn\n* Big Ednas Tavern\n* The Black Boot\n* Black Eye (tavern and festhall)\n* Blais House Inn\n* Blue Banner (tavern and inn in the Shou Quarter)\n* The Empty Fish Tavern\n* The Gatereach Inn\n* Gentle Moon Inn\n* Jolly Warrior Inn\n* Leaning Man Inn\n* Lildas (festhall in The Shore ward)\n* The Old Beard Tavern\n* Purple Lady Festhall (owned by Ilira Nathalan)\n* Rising Raven Inn and Rooming House\n* The Rosebud Tavern\n* Rotten Root Tavern\n* The Spitting Cockatrice (inn)\n* The Westward Eye (inn)\n* Auroras Emporium curio shop\n* Gondeths Mageries magic shop\n* House of Silks fine textiles shop\n* Chalarathas Fragrances perfume shop and factory\n* Dawns Dress Shop\n* Imryth Tower (residence of Audara Imryth, potion shop, and Harper safehouse)\n* Myrkeer House merchant house of Shalush Myrkeer\n* The Blind Eye tack, harness, and trail goods shop major fence of stolen goods.\n* Morningstar Haven Temple of Lathander\n* Fortuneboon Hall Temple of Tymora\n* House of Ilmater Temple of Ilmater\n* Abbey of the Blinding Truth Temple of Tyr\n* A shrine to Sune\n* A shrine to Chauntea could be found in the Eastern part of the city\nthumb|right|175px|The arena in the Quivering Thumb.\n* House of the Sun Temple of Amaunator\n* House of the Wheel Temple of Gond\n* The Hidden House Temple of Leira (subterranean)\n* House of Steel Abandoned Temple of Garagos and subterranean lair of the vampire Kirenkirsalai.\n* Whitecap Hall Temple of Umberlee\n* House of Winds Temple of Talos\n* Painbliss Hall Temple of Loviatar\n* The Place of Waiting Death Temple of Talona (subterranean)\n* House of Spires and Shadows Temple of Mask also called The Shadowspires.
