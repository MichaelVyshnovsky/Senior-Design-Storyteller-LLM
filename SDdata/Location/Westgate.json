        "History": "{{main|History of Westgate}}\nThis area of the [[Dragon Coast]] was first settled by [[human]]s from the [[Vilhon Reach]] roughly 1,000 years before the [[Standing Stone]] was erected in [[Cormanthor]]. The largest settlment was the human town of Westgate, ruled cruelly by the great [[topaz dragon]] [[Kisonraathiisar]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-349}}, [[Saldrinar]] destroyed [[Kisonraathiisar]] and became Westgate's first [[human]] king.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-286}}, the vampire Orlak and a small army of mercenaries captured the city in a single night. Orlak proclaimed himself the Night King and ruled until he is defeated by a group of [[Lathander]]-worshiping paladins in the {{YearlinkName|-157}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|257}}, pirates from the [[Pirate Isles]] invaded Westgate and began the 200-year-long reign of the Pirate Kings.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|429}} the [[Chondathan]] mercenary captain [[Mulsantir Illistine I|Mulsantir Illistine]] attacked Westgate and overthrew the pirate kings.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Westgate faced unrest caused by a guild war between the infamous Night Masks and a new organization knows as the [[Ebon Claws]]. The two gangs erupted the streets of Westgate in violence at night so new visitors to the city were warned.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], the Sea of Fallen Stars began to drain into the [[Underdark]]. The lower water level caused the shoreline to recede and, for a time, the harbor of Westgate was left high and dry. The docks were rebuilt on the new shoreline and the new dock area was known as [[Tidetown]].\n\nWith the rise of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], Westgate came to be known as the only port on the Sea of Fallen Stars that had never come under attack from the [[aboleth]]s. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, this had led to rumors of dark deals having been made to ensure the city's safety,  and indeed it did seem to enjoy some measure of special protection.\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]] the [[great rain|Great Rain]] caused the level of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to rise, making flooding in Westgate commonplace. These tidal floods caused many structures to collapse, which in turn revealed the formerly hidden entrances to dungeons built in [[Tidetown]].{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|10}}",
