        "mainbody": "Al-Oyun, also called The Eyes, referred to a pair of islands found in the Genies Turban archipelago in the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR.\nAl-Oyun and Al-Anf were collectively referred to as the \"Beauty Marks\" by local corsairs. Ever distrustful of strangers, the corsairs would use the term as a form of password to test outsiders.\nBoth of these forested islands were similar in size, measuring  in length and about  in width. They were located very close to each other directly southeast of Chaos Bay and the much larger Island of Firethorns. Their position made them appear like \"eyes\" when viewing the larger scope of the Genies Turban archipelago."
