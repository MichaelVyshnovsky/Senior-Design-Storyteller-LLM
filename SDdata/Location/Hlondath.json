        "mainbody": "'''Hlondath''' was one of the three survivors of [[Netheril]] that later came to collectively be known as the [[Lost Kingdoms]].",
        "Description": "It was considered to be the least influential of the Lost Kingdoms, also known as the Three Realms, not possessing the great magical prowess of [[Asram]] or the wealth and power of [[Anauria]].",
        "Geography": "Hlondath was the northernmost of the Three Realms, located in the northern portion of what would later be known as [[the Sword]] region of the [[Anauroch]] desert. The independent town of [[Oum]] lay between the borders of Hlondath and [[Asram]].",
        "Trade": "Hlondath's wealth came in the form of animal husbandry and the lumber industry. The nation's craftspeople produced all manner of vital wooden goods including carts, high-quality furniture, and even [[paper]].",
        "Relations": "Along with Asram, Hlondath enjoyed a good relationship with the realm of [[Tarkhaldale]], as well as the [[dwarves]] of [[Oghrann]].",
        "History": "Along with Asram and Anauria, Hlondath was founded as a survivor state of [[Netheril]], following the magocracy's collapse in the {{Yearlink|-339}}. They were spared from [[Karsus's Folly]] by the newly-emerged goddess [[Mystra]]. The Hlundite people immediately began blaming their woes on others, especially the elves of [[Cormanthyr]] who they saw as allies of the aberrant and evil [[phaerimm]].\n\nSometime after the nations' formation, the [[archmage]] [[Raumark]] led a great relocation of some of his people in a fleet of [[skyship]]s to the opposite side of [[Faerûn]] in the [[Shining South]]. After setting down in a great basin in the mountains, these Hlundite emigrants went on to found the southern magocracy of [[Halruaa]].\n\nIn [[-255 DR]], Hlundite warriors destroyed the city of [[Monikar]] after it brutally slew Netherese refugees after offering them shelter.\n\nThe Hlundites took aggressive actions against the elves of Cormanthyr in the {{YearlinkName|199}},<ref group=\"note\">Page 117 of ''[[Netheril: Empire of Magic|Netheril: Empire of Magic — The Winds of Netheril]]'' states that this occurred in [[538 DR]], in direct conflict with several other sources. in an effort to steal a portion of the magical power they possessed. This initial hostility prevented the Cormanthan elves from wholly defending themselves from their [[drow]] enemies, and began the [[Crown against the Scepter Wars]]. Though the elves did not consider the conflict a true war, they emerged victorious after threatening the humans with complete annihilation in the {{YearlinkName|308}}, and were left even more fearful of ever-present expansion of the [[human]] race.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|329}}, Hlondath was abandoned when the growing Anauroch desert began to destroy its pastures and threated to completely overrun its land. The Hlundite population migrated mostly to the [[Moonsea]] or to the [[Dalelands]],<ref name=tGHotR-p70><ref group=\"note\">Page 14 of ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|FRCS 2nd edition - Running the Realms]]'' ''circa'' [[300 DR]] but that the exact date is unknown. This has been clarified in subsequent sourcebooks. though a great many of them made their way to the city of [[Yrlaancel]]. Their descendants came to be known as the human ethnic group of the [[Vaasan]]s, who came to settle much of that region of Faerûn.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some historians speculated that Hlondath and Anauria had suffered greatly from a [[dracorage]] at some point in their respective histories.\n\nWhile Cormanthan elves denied that the Hlundite people ever successfully stole any items of real value from their kingdom, reports from [[Zhentarim]] spies observing elven [[bladesinger]]s in the ruins of [[Mhaelos]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] contradicted these claims.\n\nMost recorded information about Hlondath originated from the [[dwarves]] of [[Tethyamar]], who were forced to flee their home beneath the [[Teshan Mountains]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Mhaelos]], Hlondath's capital.\n* [[Rulvadar]], a fortified city that offered protection to the people of the northern [[Moonsea]]."
