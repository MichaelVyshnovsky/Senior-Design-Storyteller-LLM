'''Graevelwood''' was an isolated [[Gnome|gnomish]] clanhold located underneath a rocky crag in the eastern reaches of the [[Arn Forest]] in the [[Silver Marches]].

==Government==
Clanlord [[Mavheran Haerlskeel]] believed a war with [[orc]]s was not something she wanted to get her clan involved with so she kept her community's location a secret. 

==Trade==
The settlement did little trading with [[Deadsnows]] and [[Citadel Adbar]], but always with as much secrecy as possible. The traders were always careful to cover up their tracks so their path could not be followed back to the clan.

==Inhabitants== 
Many of the folk living in Graevelwood were known for their skill in trapping.
