Graevelwood was an isolated gnomish clanhold located underneath a rocky crag in the eastern reaches of the Arn Forest in the Silver Marches.
Clanlord Mavheran Haerlskeel believed a war with orcs was not something she wanted to get her clan involved with so she kept her communitys location a secret. 
The settlement did little trading with Deadsnows and Citadel Adbar, but always with as much secrecy as possible. The traders were always careful to cover up their tracks so their path could not be followed back to the clan.
Many of the folk living in Graevelwood were known for their skill in trapping.
