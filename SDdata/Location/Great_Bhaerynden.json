It is described as being \"...east of the [[Shining Sea]] and south of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]\" and \"...fan out beneath the Shaar for many thousands of miles\". Furthermore, the very similar \"Deepwilds\" the given as a dwarven name for Great Bhaerynden in ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting]]'' p. 192 and ''[[Shining South (sourcebook)|Shining South]]'' p. 160. And both sources state that the Deepfall and Wyverncaves are located in Great Bhaerynden, whereas both were previously stated in ''Dwarves Deep'' as being part of the Deep Land. was a domain of the [[Underdark]] located in the south-central region of [[Faerûn]] beneath the vast plains of [[Shaar]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"name\" />",
        "History": "This region was the first homeland of the [[dwarves]], in a cavern known as [[Bhaerynden]]. However, it was later invaded and conquered by the [[drow]] when they first ventured into the Underdark in search of a realm of their own, scattering the dwarves and sending them into exile.\n\nLess than two millennia later, for reasons that remained unknown well into the [[Present Age]], and the domed ceilings of its enormous vaults came crashing down. Many scholars suggested the the drow had caused the collapse by weakening the cavern roofs through excessive tunneling and an over-reliance on magic to support the roof's weight. Many gold dwarves on the other hand believed the collapse was the work of their [[god]] [[Moradin]], crashing his mighty [[axe]] down to destroy Telantiwar.\n\n[[File:DeepRealms Map.png|thumb|400px|''A 14{{th}} century [[DR]] map of the eastern reaches of the Great Bhaerynden, with a red outline indicating the approximate borders of the Deep Realm.'']]\nThe drow nobles that survived this disaster gathered what people, [[slave]]s, and equipment they could before fleeing elsewhere in the Underdark to find a new place to call home.\n\nFollowing this there was a hectic scramble in the Underdark to lay claim to new territory. Before long dwarves returned to their ancestral homeland and established the [[Deep Realm]], staking their claim on both the Great Rift and much of the surrounding lesser caverns and tunnels. These dwarves would become the ancestors of Faerûn's gold dwarves.\n\nWhen the [[Spellplague]] struck [[Toril]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, great rifts opened up in the Underdark beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], which in turn caused the collapse of great swathes of land. One of the casualties of this disaster was the Great Rift, whose western half collapsed into the deeper reaches of Great Bhaerynden, creating a huge canyon that was later dubbed [[Underchasm]]. Much of the communities in Great Bhaerynden were devastated in the wake of this formation, with numerous outposts and settlements becoming displaced. Many of the remaining drow realms in particular fell to ruin, with some even managing to take control of [[Underhome]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Gold dwarves lived in the Great Rift and a lot of the adjoining caves. They regularly patrolled the vast caves that were outside of their control. Occasional ambitious gold dwarves would attempt to establish homesteads or mining outposts, but within a year or two dangerous creatures that lurked within the recesses of the Great Bhaerynden would always drive them back.\n\nDrow and [[half-drow]] held the cities of [[T'lindhet]] and Llurth Dreier. [[Halflings]] lived in [[Deepburrow]] in Great Bhaerynden. [[Earth genasi]], [[urdunnir]] dwarves, and many creatures of [[elemental earth]] made their home in [[Earth's End]]. They were later joined by more genasi, as well as [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaan]] ethnic [[human]]s, both fleeing from the destruction of [[Halruaa]] during the Spellplague. In the [[Lowerdark]] reaches of the Great Bhaerynden, it was home to [[aboleth]]s, [[cloaker]]s, [[deepspawn]], the mysterious [[slyth]],<ref> and horrid wildlife, such as [[giant spider]]s and [[giant slug|night slugs]].\n\nFollowing the Spellplague, drow clans displaced from Llurth Dreier wandered the Underchasm. These drow were referred to broadly as the \"wild drow\", a moniker born from their stubborn refusal to cooperate with each other enough to build any sort of major settlement.\n\nUnlike settlements in the [[Northdark]], the cities of this region interacted more closely with the cities above ground.<ref>",
