        "mainbody": "'''Quarrelshigh''' was a fortified [[gnome|gnomish]] village high in the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]] of eastern [[Amn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. Its population was about 500 gnomes in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Geography": "Quarrelshigh was located about five miles (eight kilometers) west of the [[Wailing Dwarf]] in the northern Troll Mountains of Amn. The settlement sat between three high peaks and was protected all around by a deep ravine.",
        "Trade": "The primary industry in the village was mining rich veins of [[mithral]] and [[diamond]] deposits.",
        "Defenses": "Quarrelshigh had extremely strong defenses that had never been breached. Every tunnel was set with a number of deadly traps including rockfalls and portcullises. Some tunnels were decoys filled with nothing but traps. These defenses were tested every summer by [[troll]]s and [[ogre]]s from deeper in the mountains. Only a resident of Quaarrelshigh could guide a visitor in or out of the village safely.",
        "History": "This mining village had been in existence since at least the [[870 DR|Year of the Hooded Tracker, 870 DR]], and probably long before. The mineral resources that supported Quarrelshigh had apparently never been found or exploited by the ancient [[dwarven]] kingdom of [[Shanatar]]."
