'''Forestfall Fen''' was an unremarkable woodland swamp located near [[Waterdeep]] until it began to rapidly expand under the influence of the [[black dragon]] [[Vorazidrar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The swampy expanse of churned muck was an ideal habitat for swamp-dwelling monsters, but made the terrain dangerous even for seasoned explorers. It was dense with dead and damaged trees covered in mounds of dark moss and with branches filled with decorations of bone and hair knots left by [[hag]]s. It was a place of dank smells and constant conflict.

Forestfall Fen was said to have a primal connection to other ancient woods across [[Faerûn]].

==Geography==
The Fen was surrounded by an ancient forest, and as it expanded outward, the newly-assimilated trees on the border were green and somewhat inviting despite showing signs of damage to their roots. Beyond them, however, the swamp quickly appeared to become uninviting and unlivable, belying the monsters that dwelt there. Navigating this area was easiest by following dreadful engraved and painted stone markers left by [[green hag]]s, although these became few and far between as the terrain became more unforgiving and densely tangled by dead trees. Deeper still was an area where the barrier between the [[Prime Material plane]] and the [[Feywild]] was severely weak, and a supernatural gloom had settled on the swamp that made it hard to focus and starved the trees of light. Some trees here flourished, however, by feeding on fresh blood.

At the very center of the Fen was the village of [[Throden]], and beyond that, the lair of Vorazidrar located in a cave amidst the deepest of the swamp waters.

===Flora & Fauna===
Forestfall Fenn was notable for its abundant dark mosses as well as its bloodthirsty flora, namely an unusual kind of [[vine blight]]s known as [[holdfast vine]]s, which appeared to have been spawned by the swamp itself as a defense mechanism.

The swamp was also home to all manner of monsters, including [[giant spider]]s&mdash;some of which had tough, almost wood-like carapaces that encompassed their bodies and legs&mdash;[[carrion crawler]]s, and [[cranium rat]]s. It was also home to many [[undead]], including [[wight]]s, [[zombie]]s, and foul-smelling [[ghast]]s that feasted on the bounty of decayed organic material in the area.

As the barrier with the Feywild weakened further in the late 15{{th}} century DR, parts of the swamp became overrun with [[meenlock]]s, who created a nightmarish atmosphere and warred with the local inhabitants.

==History==
Forestfall Fen was originally the home of a [[lizardfolk]] tribe and village called Throden and a group of [[troll]]s known as the [[Muckgrunter]]s. At some point prior to the 15{{th}} century DR, Vorazidrar arrived with her followers, the [[Queenstooth]] [[kobold]]s, and the lizardfolk began to pay tribute to the dragon as their "Queen". Vorazidrar's various subjects found themselves in an endless conflict with the Muckgrunters, whose natural ability to regenerate meant that they were nearly impossible to put down permanently.

As she aged and grew in power, Vorazidrar [[magic]] began to twist Forestfall Fen into a reflection of her might and ambition, and accordingly, it began to expand and become more violent. She then directed the green hags of the swamp, led by her subject [[Galagrave]] to aid in the expansion of the swamp. The hags directed the local ghasts to attack trees on the perimeter of the swamp, rending their roots and allowing the encroaching swamp to absorb them. The chaos resulting from this strategy caused the already weak barrier with the Feywild to open, leading to the appearance of countless mossy [[Fey crossroad|gateways]] through which meenlocks flocked. This [[fey]] invasion was immediately contested by the Queenstooth kobolds, but the increased bloodshed led to the awakening of many long-dormant holdfast vines, leading to even more violence and conflict.

Throughout this entire time, the nearby city of Waterdeep remained oblivious to the growing swamp and the dangers it contained. This was thanks to a plot to subvert and destroy the city by a [[pit fiend]] called [[Kurgaloth]], who had entered into an [[infernal contract]] with the aristocratic [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]] in which they worked to distract the city from nearby threats. However, once their betrayal was discovered by [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]], she recovered the personal journals of Lord [[Terrathy Lightfinger]] which suggested that the family had a special interest in Forestfall Fen. She sent a group of [[adventurer]]s to investigate, who quickly discovered that the swamp was much larger than was shown on any existing maps, suggesting it was growing magically. Knowing that the Fen was had a primal connection to other woods across the land, Laeral feared that whatever evil had taken root there might spread, thus she directed her adventurers to investigate. They fought their way through the deadly swamp, ultimately confronted Vorazidrar, and defeated her by trapping her inside her lair with a cave-in, thus breaking her hold over Throden and the Fen.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Throden]], a village that was home to both lizardfolk and kobolds as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Vorazidrar#Lair|Vorazidrar's lair]], a stone cavern jutting out of the swamp wherein Vorazidrar received her tribute.

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Green hag WoW.png|thumb|''A green hag with her zombie minions in the Fen.'']]Forestfall Fen's lizardfolk lived alongside the Queenstooth kobolds in the village of Throden. They fought constantly against the Muckgrunter trolls and other denizens of the swamp to keep their village safe. They served their "Queen", Vorazidrar, as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

The Fen was home to a number of green hags, whose cackles could be heard throughout the swamp. They also served the "Queen", and were known to offer sweet words and gifts to fool visitors into a false sense of security.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Cracklebranch]], an oversized giant spider.
* [[Galagrave]], a green hag who served Vorazidrar.
* [[Knucklespine]], leader of the Muckgrunter trolls in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Othokent]], leader of the Throden lizardfolk in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Smothertree]], a massive vine blight.
* [[Spittleburn]], a leader among the Queenstooth kobolds in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Vorazidrar]], a powerful black dragon and self-styled Queen of Forestfall Fen.
* [[Wrathburn (wight)|Wrathburn]], a wight who had once been an adventurer.
