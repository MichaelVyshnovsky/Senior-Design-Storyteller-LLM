Forestfall Fen was an unremarkable woodland swamp located near Waterdeep until it began to rapidly expand under the influence of the black dragon Vorazidrar in the late 15 century DR.
The swampy expanse of churned muck was an ideal habitat for swamp-dwelling monsters, but made the terrain dangerous even for seasoned explorers. It was dense with dead and damaged trees covered in mounds of dark moss and with branches filled with decorations of bone and hair knots left by hags. It was a place of dank smells and constant conflict.
Forestfall Fen was said to have a primal connection to other ancient woods across Faer√ªn.
The Fen was surrounded by an ancient forest, and as it expanded outward, the newly-assimilated trees on the border were green and somewhat inviting despite showing signs of damage to their roots. Beyond them, however, the swamp quickly appeared to become uninviting and unlivable, belying the monsters that dwelt there. Navigating this area was easiest by following dreadful engraved and painted stone markers left by green hags, although these became few and far between as the terrain became more unforgiving and densely tangled by dead trees. Deeper still was an area where the barrier between the Prime Material plane and the Feywild was severely weak, and a supernatural gloom had settled on the swamp that made it hard to focus and starved the trees of light. Some trees here flourished, however, by feeding on fresh blood.
At the very center of the Fen was the village of Throden, and beyond that, the lair of Vorazidrar located in a cave amidst the deepest of the swamp waters.
Forestfall Fenn was notable for its abundant dark mosses as well as its bloodthirsty flora, namely an unusual kind of vine blights known as holdfast vines, which appeared to have been spawned by the swamp itself as a defense mechanism.
The swamp was also home to all manner of monsters, including giant spiders&mdashsome of which had tough, almost wood-like carapaces that encompassed their bodies and legs&mdashcarrion crawlers, and cranium rats. It was also home to many undead, including wights, zombies, and foul-smelling ghasts that feasted on the bounty of decayed organic material in the area.
As the barrier with the Feywild weakened further in the late 15 century DR, parts of the swamp became overrun with meenlocks, who created a nightmarish atmosphere and warred with the local inhabitants.
Forestfall Fen was originally the home of a lizardfolk tribe and village called Throden and a group of trolls known as the Muckgrunters. At some point prior to the 15 century DR, Vorazidrar arrived with her followers, the Queenstooth kobolds, and the lizardfolk began to pay tribute to the dragon as their "Queen". Vorazidrars various subjects found themselves in an endless conflict with the Muckgrunters, whose natural ability to regenerate meant that they were nearly impossible to put down permanently.
As she aged and grew in power, Vorazidrar magic began to twist Forestfall Fen into a reflection of her might and ambition, and accordingly, it began to expand and become more violent. She then directed the green hags of the swamp, led by her subject Galagrave to aid in the expansion of the swamp. The hags directed the local ghasts to attack trees on the perimeter of the swamp, rending their roots and allowing the encroaching swamp to absorb them. The chaos resulting from this strategy caused the already weak barrier with the Feywild to open, leading to the appearance of countless mossy gateways through which meenlocks flocked. This fey invasion was immediately contested by the Queenstooth kobolds, but the increased bloodshed led to the awakening of many long-dormant holdfast vines, leading to even more violence and conflict.
Throughout this entire time, the nearby city of Waterdeep remained oblivious to the growing swamp and the dangers it contained. This was thanks to a plot to subvert and destroy the city by a pit fiend called Kurgaloth, who had entered into an infernal contract with the aristocratic Lightfinger family in which they worked to distract the city from nearby threats. However, once their betrayal was discovered by Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, she recovered the personal journals of Lord Terrathy Lightfinger which suggested that the family had a special interest in Forestfall Fen. She sent a group of adventurers to investigate, who quickly discovered that the swamp was much larger than was shown on any existing maps, suggesting it was growing magically. Knowing that the Fen was had a primal connection to other woods across the land, Laeral feared that whatever evil had taken root there might spread, thus she directed her adventurers to investigate. They fought their way through the deadly swamp, ultimately confronted Vorazidrar, and defeated her by trapping her inside her lair with a cave-in, thus breaking her hold over Throden and the Fen.
