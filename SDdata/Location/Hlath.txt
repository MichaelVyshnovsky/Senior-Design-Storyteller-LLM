'''Hlath''' was one of the largest and most powerful city-states in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Sometimes the city fell under the control of [[Chondath]].

==Description==
Hlath was an old walled city with streets of cobblestone that veered between mostly four and five-story buildings. The city walls rose {{SI|50'|'"|long=yes}} up. The wall sprouted buttresses and ramparts. All parts of the wall were in dire need of repairs by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] with visible pieces of missing rocks and [[mortar]]. Falling chunks of the wall at one point were considered a danger, but the warning signage was ordered to be removed by Lord [[Darvis Shennelm]] in attempts to hide the disrepair. The city entrances were protected by portcullis gates and drawbridges. Its harbours were six huge stone piers that extended from Hlath's northern wall, large enough to accommodate the biggest trade and military vessels of the Vilhon Reach.

Outside Hlath's walls were numerous long warehouses that stored the city's main export - lumber. These warehouses stood alongside the [[Highway of the Sunrise]].

==Geography==
Hlath was the northern-most city of Chondath. It boarded the waters of the Vilhon Reach and was connected to a highway that stretched out to [[Arrabar]]. It stood approximately {{SI|130|miles|long=yes}} away from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The city was the northern end point of the [[Emerald Way]], a major road that ran throught he entiry country of Chondath.

===Flora & Fauna===
Cattle and [[goat]]s were often enocuntered on Hlath's streets while the rooftops housed a sizable population of [[pigeon]]s.

==Government==
For a period of time around [[1358 DR]], the city was governed by a council of Three Lords of Hlath. During that time, the lords were: Lord [[Fior Botpur]], Lord [[Warkas]], and Lord [[Nybahn]]. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the rulership was held by a single governor who was under the control of the city of [[Arrabar]]. 

==Trade==
Hlath was a busy port city. Hlath had two industries. The first one was its humble fishing. The second one was the city's chief export - lumber,

The local fishers were famous for their extremely durable long fishing nets.

==Culture==
===Religion===
The [[church of Silvanus]] had a shrine to the [[Forest Father]] in the city, while the [[Church of Tyr]] had a major temple.

==Defenses==
The harbours of Hlath were well-protected by a [[harbor chain]] and [[catapult]]s. The city itself was protected by [[ballista]]s and heavy [[catapult]]s. The city also employed the Hlath Guards, infantry armed with [[short sword]]s and [[shield]]s. In times of war, Hlath hired mercenariy companies.

==History==
Hlath was founded in the {{YearlinkName|267}}, after [[Chondath]]an logging towns of [[Timindar]] and [[Orbech]] were destroyed in the [[Battle of Fallen Trees]]. Following the disaster, King [[Laviar Illistine]] was forced to focus his attention on the [[Nunwood]] and Hlath became a producer of lumber for the nation.

From [[900 DR]] through [[902 DR]], Hlath came into prominence after jumpstarting the Chondathan civil war, later named the [[Rotting War]]. In the {{YearlinkName|900}}, Hlath's governor at the time was [[Archmage]] [[Whinonas Ferentier]] who took control of his city. A similar change of power happened in Reth, prompting King [[Neveris Bikou]] of Chondath to send his army to Hlath. Both towns, Hlath and Reth, joined forces and sent their armies into a bloody battle against Chondathan's troops along the [[Emerald Corridor]] to the south of [[River Nun]]. By the {{YearlinkName|901}}, the war turned Hlath and Reth against each other, and Whinonas Ferentier used ancient [[Netherese]] sorcery against advancing armies of Hondath and Reth. In response, wizards of [[Arrabar]] and Reth retaliated with deadly Netherese magics themselves, scorching the battlegrounds with death and destruction. In the {{YearlinkName|902}}, troops from Reth clashed in combat with joined armies of Arrabar and Hlath in the [[Fiends of Nun]], in the foothills of the [[Akanapeaks]]. The rulers of Chondathan cities craved an easy win and ordered their wizards to summon deadly [[necromantic]] plagues. The resulting epidemic killed two-thirds of the Chondathan armies in minutes. The survivors took the plague home, spreading the deadly disease. The devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured Arrabar's loss of influence. All the cities of Chondath, apart from [[Iljak]] declared independence, making Hlath a self-governed city-state.

Hlath gained a naval port in the {{YearlinkName|992}}, sponsored by the nation of [[Turmish]] and its new visionary mercantile leader Lord [[Saros]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1292}}, the harbors of the [[Ravens Bluff]] suffered the first major pirate attack that left the trade vessel out of Hlath - the ''[[Glartaree]]'', destroyed by fires. Its cargo of [[stone]] bowl ended up deep in the mud at the bottom of the sea. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Hlath, along with several other cities, suffered from several raids by [[orc]]ish tribes of the [[Akanapeaks]].

The {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the city of Hlath came under attack by a barbarian army from [[Kara-Tur]]. Lord [[Fior Botpur]] planned the defenses, aided by a group of adventurers who helmed the gathered defenders against armies of [[Khan Kertep]]. Before the siege battle, Kertep sent his [[ninja]]s into Hlath to weaken the defenders by [[poison]]ing food and water and carry out soldier and civilian assassinations. It was later revealed that Khan Kertep was replaced by an [[arcanaloth]] named [[Yrkhetep]] who led his armies into [[Faer√ªn]].

In the [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], Hlath became involved in a conflict with the city of Iljak. Both considered the other the reason for the stagnation of trade. Hlath helmed several raids on its opponent, and the cities used their guard patrols to wage a small-scale war along the [[Old Road (Vilhon Reach)|Old Road]] and the Emerald Corridor. This conflict aided trade of Arrabar and [[Shamph]].

With the advent of the [[Spellplague]] of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the nation of Chondath was destroyed by the wild magics. The cities of Arrabar, Hlath, Iljak, Reth, and [[Shamph]] became twisted ruins of danger and lost riches. After the return of [[Mystra]] during the [[Second Sundering]], the spell-scarred land of was healed, and as of late-15{{th}} century DR, Arrabar and other cities of Chondath were returned to [[Toril]].{{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|5}}
