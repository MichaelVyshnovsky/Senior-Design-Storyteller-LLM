'''Norinoshima''' was an island located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Norinoshima, located in the [[Inland Sea]] to the north of [[Miyama Province]], was characterized by its undulating terrain, adorned with hills. The island also boasted a spacious and well-protected harbor, providing a safe haven for ships and boats.

==Inhabitants==
For generations, Norinoshima has been home to a community of fishermen and rice farmers who have established their livelihoods on the island.

==History==
In {{yearlinkConvert|1421|KY}}, [[Hojo Todahiro]] convened his fleet at Norinoshima, utilizing the island as a gathering point to regroup and reorganize his allied armies following a series of inconclusive land and sea skirmishes. However, before the combined forces could fully assemble for a decisive campaign, they were taken by surprise when [[Takenaka Sugawara]] led a fleet of ships and men against them. The ensuing battle on the island marked the end of the [[Hojo War]], resulting in the defeat of Hojo Todahiro's forces.

The remnants of Hojo Todahiro's fleet now rested at the bottom of Norinoshima harbor, creating a treasure trove for those daring enough to explore the sunken vessels. Among the sunken treasures lied enchanted armor, weapons, and various mysterious magical artifacts whose true nature remained unknown.
