Norinoshima was an island located in Kozakura.
Norinoshima, located in the Inland Sea to the north of Miyama Province, was characterized by its undulating terrain, adorned with hills. The island also boasted a spacious and well-protected harbor, providing a safe haven for ships and boats.
For generations, Norinoshima has been home to a community of fishermen and rice farmers who have established their livelihoods on the island.
In , Hojo Todahiro convened his fleet at Norinoshima, utilizing the island as a gathering point to regroup and reorganize his allied armies following a series of inconclusive land and sea skirmishes. However, before the combined forces could fully assemble for a decisive campaign, they were taken by surprise when Takenaka Sugawara led a fleet of ships and men against them. The ensuing battle on the island marked the end of the Hojo War, resulting in the defeat of Hojo Todahiros forces.
The remnants of Hojo Todahiros fleet now rested at the bottom of Norinoshima harbor, creating a treasure trove for those daring enough to explore the sunken vessels. Among the sunken treasures lied enchanted armor, weapons, and various mysterious magical artifacts whose true nature remained unknown.
