        "mainbody": "Phutan was a small kingdom in Kara-Tur, neighboring Tabot. Its capital city was Bhutan.The place is called only \"Phutan\" in Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms Volume I, but only \"Bhutan\" appears on all maps of the region. While this could be an error or variation in spelling, there is no actual contradiction the maps specifically label the city as \"Bhutan\", not the country.\nPhutan occupied a wedge of land between the Po Yul Dzayul Range to the north and the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains to the southwest. To the southeast was the border with Tabot, leaving it quite locked in.\nThe monks of Tabot, no friends to Phutan, saw it as lawless land that gave sanctuary to outlaws from Tabot, Tu Lung, and Shou Lung, and that its \"heathen king\" decreed lamas and holy men be killed on sight. There were constant conflicts between the Phutanese and the Tabotans at Hoshki Gompa and Buchan Do Gompa over the border.\nthumb|250px|The moon woman transforming white tigers into men.\nPhutan shared its early past with Tabot. Originally, the land was the domain of barbarian kings and tribal chiefs with their own noble class. They built cities in the lowlands and followed a heathen faith. In their founding myth, millennia previously, the moon descended to the earth one night in the form of a beautiful woman. As she wandered through the night, all the white tigers of the land gathered at her side and were entranced by her. She touched her hand to the foreheads of nineteen of them and they were transformed into human men of strength and intelligence. After the moon women returned to the sky, the new men performed heroic deeds and founded the various clans. One of these clans founded Phutan, the others the various kingdoms of Tabot.\nBut unlike Tabot, Phutan seems never to have been occupied by the exiled Shou monks and their monasteries between  and , nor to have fallen under the sway of the High Lord of Oceans in .The history of Phutan and its split from Tabot is unknown, but its lack of religious sites on the map, different faith, and conflicts suggest this account.\nIn , Buchan Do lamas reported a Phutanese army assembling at the border. Tabot went on a war footing, mustering soldiers in the area and ordering conscription in a few towns, hiring mercenaries, and accepting volunteers from among the temple guards."
