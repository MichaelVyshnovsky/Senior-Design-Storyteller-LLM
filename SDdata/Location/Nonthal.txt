'''Nonthal''' was a city, reputed for being the most peaceful and stable in the nation of [[Turmish]], in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
The citizens of Nonthal loved the city's stability and attempted to stay out of conflicts if possible. For that reason, the numerous adventurers that passed through were often met with cold shoulder and the overwhelming stench of the town's cattle industries.

The city itself was quite dull in appearance. Its streets were filled with market stalls and tradesmen.{{Cite polyhedron/106/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Endless Treasures in Turmish|6-8}}

The city had a functioning sewer system, that was fixed, expanded, and improved by [[Joster Barbellow]], of the [[Barbellow]] [[gnome]] family. The "Lord of the Sewers" was hired by Nonthal for the job sometime in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220201012239/https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/lord-sewers| title = LORD OF THE SEWERS | accessdate = 31-1-2022| date = 12/11/2013}}

==Geography==
[[File:Turmish map vilhon reach sourcebook.png|thumb|''A map of Turmish, showing the location of Nonthal along the [[Turmway]].''|265x265px]]
Nonthal stood just north from and connected to the [[Turmway]] and the town of [[Centaur Bridge]] via a well-traveled road that continued further north towards the towns of [[Sambryntyn]] and [[Moonhunt Down]] a bit further.{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|24}}

==Trade==
The city's main trade was cattle. Nonthal was surrounded by a strong aroma of [[manure]], slaughterhouses, and the chemical stench of its many tanneries. It served as a market town for smaller farming communities that were sprinkled around Nonthal.

==History==
The city was named after a [[wizard]], who moved there in the early-to-mid 13th-century [[DR]]. He built his cottage behind an inn and put up signs warning people to leave him alone, then promptly disappeared. His house was quickly ransacked of valuables, and the cottage's stone walls were broken apart to be used elsewhere.

At some point in the late 14{{th}} century DR, a powerful mage named [[Fern (person)|Fern]] walked Nonthal's Path, dispelling its ''portals'' with his clever spells. When he reached the destination – an old dung hole that held the final ''portal'' to the fabled wizard's lair, Fern attempted to dispel it. However, the magic traps were smarter than Fern, and they ''teleported'' him to Anauroch, across [[Faerûn]]. This attempt was witnessed and immortalized in writing by Adamar Session, [[bard]] of [[Starmantle]]. Eventually, Fern returned to Nonthal and could always be found in the Three Trees Inn, plotting further attempts.

==Notable Locations==
*''[[13 Gates of Magic]]'', a set of ''[[portal]]'' traps that guarded Nonthal's Hold, scattered every three steps along Nonthal's Path. Without uttering correct passwords for each, they spirited unwitting adventures to [[Yliyl]] of Anauroch, [[Whitehorn]] mountains of [[Thar]], [[Dlathilvaer]] of [[Evereska]], [[serpent]]-infested location in [[Chult]], [[Halruaa]], [[Underdark]], among others.
*[[Nonthal's Hold]], the hidden lair of the wizard Nonthal, protected by a series of magical ''[[teleport]]ing'' traps along Nonthl's Path. The hold itself was rumored to be hidden in [[Feywild]], and contained powerful [[enchanted]] items and [[spellbook]]s.
*[[Nonthal's Path]], the road that began in the center of the city and led towards the magically-hidden Nonthal's Hold, beyond a misused dung-pit.
*[[Three Trees Inn]], the center of most activities in the city and the main lodging available for ambitious gold-seekers. Individuals who were brave enough to walk Nonthal's Path were a major entertainment for the guests of the inn.

==Inhabitants==
Notably, Nonthal had a significant [[gnome|gnomish]] population, reviled only by the city of [[Xorhun]]. Many of them were ''[[illusionist]]s'' by trade and made a living entertaining and pranking travelers with sparkling lights and raucous sounds.
