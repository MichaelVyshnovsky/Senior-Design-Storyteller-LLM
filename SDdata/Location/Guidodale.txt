Maracrath was a village located in Impiltur in the Northeast Faer√ªn, off the coast of the Easting Reach
Guidodale was known as one of several overnight stops for caravans that traveled along the Merchants Run, part of the Heralds Road that stretched between Impiltur and the Cold Lands. Guidodale stood on a crossroad where the road from Timbertown to the northwest joined Merchants Run. The town itself was located between Maracrath to the southeast and Mulltown to the northwest.
Guidodale received protection from Ilmwatchs garrison contingents that traveled with merchant caravans between the Cold Lands and the Easting Reach.
