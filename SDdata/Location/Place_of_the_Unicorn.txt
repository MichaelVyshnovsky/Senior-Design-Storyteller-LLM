The Place of the Unicorn was a sacred grove where an avatar of Lurue was known to occasionally appear.
The grove was located in the Lost Hills, northeast of Leilon on the Sword Coast North. The grove would only appear at night.
The grove was formed by a stand of trees surrounding a bluegrass meadow. The leaves of the trees were brilliant blue in color.These trees may be blueleafs.
Anyone resting within the Place of the Unicorn was magically cured of all diseases, curses, poisons, and insanity. Unicorns visiting the grove were healed of any physical trauma. Anyone lacking faith, or wavering in their faith, would actually see Lurue, which often reshaped their life.
Sages and wizards along the Sword Coast believed that the Place of the Unicorn existed within another dimension and was only accessible via a moongate.
