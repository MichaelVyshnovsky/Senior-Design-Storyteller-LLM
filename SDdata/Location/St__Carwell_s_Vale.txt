'''St. Carwell's Vale''' was a tiny village hidden in the [[Hamlar Hills]] of [[Amn]].

==Geography==
The village was hidden in a grassy vale amid the western Hamlar Hills towards the coast, northwest from [[Mount Speartop]].

==Notable Locations==
A wood and stone sanctuary with a mineral water spring lay in the middle of the village, a shrine to [[Eldath]] overseen by [[Baniol the Peaceful]]. [[St. Carwell's Hospice]] was a small hospital operated by Baniol's friend [[Rhynda]], a priest of [[Ilmater]]. Between the two of them, the Vale was a refuge for any who sought it.
