        "Description": {
            "Gates": "Unique among the gate-towns, the gate found in Tradegate was actually a living creature, a [[bariaur]] who went by the name of Master Trader. He could be found wandering within the forests located near the gate-town. On occasion he ventured to [[Tir na Og]]. If one successfully completed the long, complicated trading process, Master Trader opened the gate to allow passage into Bytopia."
        },
        "Government": "Tradegate was ruled by a council of merchants called the Parliament. They met on a weekly basis and concerned themselves primarily with trading regulations. New members to the council were not elected, rather anyone who was not of an evil [[alignment]], and also had 500,000 [[gold piece]]s, were welcome to join the Parliament.",
        "Trade": "Tradegate was aptly named due to the fact it was a major center of commerce. The gate-town minted their own currency, a coin with a star on one side and an engraving of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian god]] [[Ilmater]] on the other. According to the locals, the coin represented the dual nature of Bytopia. Goods were bought and sold via barter or purchase with hard currency, credit was rare and never given to on who was not from the gate-town.",
        "Inhabitants": "The inhabitants of Tradegate were primarily [[gnome]]s and [[human]]s, and were an industrious lot with a strong work ethic. Begging and vagrancy were forbidden and punishable by a sentence to a workhouse.",
        "History": "At some point, a group of [[adventurer]]s from the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] came to the city of Sigil, having purchased a [[map]] from a sage in [[Shadowdale]]. When the group's [[fighter]] unfolded the map they began scanning it in search of the gate-town Glorium, only to quickly be corrected by his [[rogue]] ally that town headed to [[Gladsheim]] and they were looking for the gate-town to [[Bytopia]]. Watching the adventurers argue among themselves, a peddler emerged from the shadows with a variety of shaped ''[[mimir]]s'' floating about him. He offered a skull-shaped one to the group's fighter, who proceeded to ask it their query and was told what they sought was Tradegate. Impressed, the adventurers paid the peddler for the ''mimir'' and went off on their journey.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a planeswalking merchantile caravan in the Torilian city of [[Ravens Bluff]] was being sponsored by local Ravenian noble [[Lauren DeVillars]] and doing business with the gate-town of Glorium,<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} though they had aims to soon start trade missions with both the gate-towns of Tradegate and [[Torch (gate-town)|Torch]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|9}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored across the Outlands that one could purchase [[fiend|fiendish]] equipment and weapons salvaged from the various battlefields of the [[Blood Wars]] at certain stalls in the bazaar. Word was that anyone interested in such purchases had to wear boots with red stripes while within the bazaar. If seen, they were approached and a meeting was scheduled."
