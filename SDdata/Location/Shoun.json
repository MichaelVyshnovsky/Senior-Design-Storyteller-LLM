Shoun was the port nearest to Passion Island. It was the terminus from a road leading to Beluir, as well as the beginning of a trail leading to Ormpe in Estagund.\nMelino Richtoes was the mayor of Shoun in 1367 DR.\nShoun was founded by halflings in 116 DR. The settlement sported a host of bakeries, eventually giving rise to the phrase \"fat as a Shounite\" throughout Luiren. Additionally, famous dairies were supplied by goats, which were kept north of the city. It was even rumored that Luiren spring cheese originated here."
