'''Lokar Pass''' was a pass through the [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]] in central [[Tabot]]. A road linking [[Draya]] and [[Ji]] ran through it.{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}

==History==
When the forces of [[Shou Lung]] invaded Tabot in {{YearlinkConvert|894|SY}}, they seized the whole of northern Tabot, from Lokar Pass to [[Ko'Chung Gompa]]. With the fate of their nation hanging in the balance, artisans in [[Ji]] fashioned the five [[crystalline warriors]] and a group of great [[dang-ki]] and [[wu jen]] animated them and gave them magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of Lokar Pass. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands.<ref>
