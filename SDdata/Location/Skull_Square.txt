'''Skull Square''' was a plaza in the [[Skullport/Lower Trade Lanes|Lower Trade Lanes]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Skull Square functioned as the central arena for Skullport's version of justice, though this justice was often arbitrary and harsh by conventional standards. Here, individuals accused of minor infractions, disturbances, or petty theft were placed in stocks or crow's cages and subjected to public humiliation as onlookers hurled refuse, spoiled [[fish]], and other readily available objects at them. Those whose actions seriously disrupted the port's commercial order, or who had otherwise provoked the ire of the residents or the [[Skulls of Skullport]], faced a more formal trial process.

The Skulls, who presided over these trials, mimicked the legal proceedings seen in the courts of the surface lands, though with a darkly satirical twist. Witnesses were summoned to testify, and the gathered crowd served as both jury and, at times, executioner. These mock trials aimed less at justice than at reinforcing Skullport's strict social order.

Sentences varied in severity according to the offense. Minor offenders were typically confined to the crow's cages or stocks for a duration of hours or days. Those who'd incurred the Skulls' profound disfavor received harsher punishments, such as indefinite confinement within the [[Skullport/Dungeons|dungeons]] below the Trade Lanes, or consigned to a life of forced servitude.
