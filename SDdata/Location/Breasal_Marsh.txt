The '''Breasal Marsh''' was a marshland located on the isle of [[Moray]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The Breasal Marsh was located toward the center of the island. It covered approximately {{SI|200|sq mi|k}}, making it one of the prominent geographical features of Moray. The marsh was fed by the [[Shannyth River]] flowing in from the south, which also exited the marsh's northern edge at [[Lac Dynnegall]]. The village of [[Horst]] sat on the southeast edge of the Breasal Marsh.

==Inhabitants==
Tribes of [[lizardfolk]] lived within the marsh. Some of the tribes wished to reawaken [[Kazgaroth]], while others were more peaceful and followed [[Silvanus]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|9}}
