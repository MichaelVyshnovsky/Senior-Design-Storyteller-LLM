The Tentowers neighborhood of Ravens Bluff was a large portion of the citys Uptown District. It was easily the richest area of the Bluff, both with regard to its monetary wealth and what it had to offer visitors and locals alike. While all of those within the city were allowed to walk its streets, those who didnt look sufficiently affluent were often hurried along by the City Watch.
Tentowers was so named for the observations of an illiterate visitor walking through the neighborhoods streets. As he looked into the citys skyline, he counted the towers and minarets, and stopped at the largest number he knew, which was 8. Seeing that were rowers unaccounted for, and knowing that 10 was a larger number than 8, he dubbed it "Tentowers" and the name stuck.
