In the 14{{th}} century DR, there were at least two ferries. However, by the late 15{{th}} century DR, two bridges were constructed, making travel between the two parts of the city quicker.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century DR, the Dock District consisted of two areas, eastern and western Phlan, separated by a wall and two sets of gates: the [[Traitor's Gate]] on the northern end and the [[Parkside Gate]] on the southern end. The Parkside gate was named for the [[Valhegen Park]] that stood between the two gates, while the Traitor's Gate bore the name of disgraced First Councilman [[Porphyrys Cadorna]].

After the abandonment of [[Hillsafar]] following the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the {{YearlinkName|714}}, refugees poured into Phlan and it grew to be the largest settlement on the north shore of the Moonsea.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|902}}, the [[Zhentilar]] made the first of many attempts to conquer their eastern neighbor, claiming that citizens of Phlan had raided their territory (though this claim was likely erroneous) but didn't count on Phlan's ally [[Melvaunt]] disrupting their siege. A four-year war resulted in Phlan becoming a reluctant signatory to the [[Treaty of the Ride]] in [[906 DR]], which saw Zhentarim influence over the city increase dramatically.\n\nAlong with the other powers of the Moonsea, Phlan sent a contingent of soldiers to rebuild and occupy the [[Citadel of the Raven]] fortress within the western [[Dragonspine Mountains]] in the {{YearlinkName|1276}}.  \n\nThe {{yearlinkName|1303}}, saw the second destruction of Phlan, as [[ogres]] completely overran the city that was unprepared for such an assault. Phlan was rapidly rebuilt by the stubborn survivors, just in time for the city to enter into the [[Moonsea War]] with their neighboring city-states [[1306 DR|three years later]]. While the cities of [[Hulburg]] and [[Sulasspryn]] were conquered by [[Mulmaster]], Phlan joined into an alliance with Hillsfar, Melvaunt, Sembia, and even their former foes in Zhentil Keep to put down the Mulmastan forces.  \n\nJust as the war ended in the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, Phlan was invaded by a great host of [[dragon]]s and their armies from the lands of Thar known as the [[Dragon Run]]. As the Moonsea's other powers were recovering from the brief war that just flared up and ceased, Phlan received no help from neighboring city-states. For the third time in its history, and the second time in three years, Phlan was left to ruin – though this time, all of its citizens were slaughtered ''en masse''.",

When the dragon entered the pool, Tyranthraxus took possession of the dragon and commenced immediately to build an army of monsters for the subjugation of Faerûn.\n\nBy the year {{yearlinkName|1340}}, Tyranthraxus had near complete control of Phlan with the exception of the area of the city near the docks known as \"Civilized Phlan\". Using those few city blocks as their base of operations, a new City Council formed by children of the original merchants of Phlan and new speculators formed, and attempted to reclaim the city. [[Adventurer]]s flocked to Phlan to help clear these monsters out in return for the generous bounty offered by the new Council.\n\nUsing the services of a [[Heroes of Phlan|trio of adventurers]] to clear out the occupied areas of the city, Councilman [[Porphyrys Cadorna]] quickly rose to the position of First Councilman.  By this time, the adventurers had succeeded in retaking most of the city, though Tyranthraxus still remained under Valjevo Castle in control of the ''pool of radiance''. After learning of the existence of the Pool, Cardona became obsessed with it, wishing to use its it power to expand his own. When the possessed dragon was finally defeated by the adventurers, Cadorna attempted to seize control of the pool, only to be possessed himself by Tyranthraxus and forced to its waters, teleporting him the fallen councilman to the plane Tyranthraxus called home.",
            "Seizure by Bane": "The {{yearlinkName|1350}} saw a scheme by the god [[Bane]] to ''teleport'' Phlan and several other Moonsea cities from their locations to serve as soul farms to the Lord of Darkness in [[Banehold]]. The [[Thayan]] [[Red Wizard]] [[Marcus]] and the [[pit fiend]] [[Tanetal]] were charged with taking Phlan, but defied Bane's initial command of teleporting the city to Bane's realm. Instead, the two moved Phlan into a cavern underneath the Red Wizard's tower southeast of Zhentil Keep. They planned to feed souls of the residents of Phlan to the ''pool of darkness'' to increase their own powers before handing it over to Bane.\n\nMarshaling the defenses of the city was the wizard [[Shal Bal]] and the cleric of [[Tyr]] [[Tarl Desanea]], two of the three Heroes of Phlan that freed the city from Tyranthraxus a decade earlier. With the two heroes leading the defense, Marcus and Tanetal were unable to take control of the city, despite numerous full assaults and the fact that the city was trapped directly under Marcus' tower.\n\nMeanwhile, the third member of the legendary group, [[Ren o' the Blade]], went in search of the city after its disappearance. Aided by two [[druids]] under directions from [[Silvanus]], an [[undead]] [[paladin]] of Tyr named [[Miltiades]], and a wizard named [[Evaine]], Ren managed to find the tower and joining with Tarl and Shal, was able to defeat the Red Wizard and send the pit fiend back to the [[Nine Hells]]. The defeat of Marcus and Tanetal broke the spell holding the city under the tower and the city was returned to its former location on the Moonsea.\n\nAfter being annihilated three times in its history, and transported to another location in the Realms, Phlan was almost entirely destroyed yet again during the [[Rage of Dragons]] that devastated the Eastern Heartlands in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}. \n\nWhile the city lay in ruin for at least a year, At the same time however, the nearby powers of Zhentil Keep and Hillsfar vied for influence and control of its citizens, who were merely trying to reclaim their former lives. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Phlan was considered to be an exciting place that was well in the highs of its great reconstruction. The city proudly held onto an atmosphere of hope and drive for renewed wealth and success. Many people believed this collective feeling could be attributed to the rapidly-growing number of [[Tyr]]ran faithful in the city.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the dreaded ''pool of radiance'' reemerged underneath Valjevo Castle. A thief named [[Kestrel]] witnessed its corrupted magical waters consuming three criminals and reluctantly decided to inform [[Elminster Aumar]] of the returned danger. As the ''pool's'' power grew, it started seeping life out of residents of Phlan and started to spawn undead. Elminster assembled a team of adventurers, helmed by [[Athan]] and entrusted him with the ''[[Gauntlets of Moander]]'' to venture into the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] from whence the corruption of reemerged ''pool of radiance'' originated. As Athan's band fell in combat, the ''pools'' spread across other cities of the Moonsea, and the new makeshift heroes emerged. Kestrel, [[Corran D'Arcey]], [[Durwyn]], and [[Ghleanna Stormlake]] became known as the [[Veiled Ones]] and eventually succeeded in destroying the ''pool of radiance'' corrupted by the [[Cult of the Dragon]].",
            "Zhent Occupation": "By [[Tarsakh 3]] of {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Phlan had been fully conquered by the forces of Zhentil Keep. After [[1380 DR|five years]], the city government was dissolved to be replaced by the tyranny of Cvaal Daoran when he dissolved the Council of Ten and name himself the Lord Protector of Phlan.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|5}}\n\nDuring the [[Shadowbane War]] of [[1383 DR]] however, Cvaal forged an alliance with the [[dark fey]] of the Quivering Forest,{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|5}} and managed to slay a [[Princes of Shade|Shadovar prince]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|65}} thereby ensuring that his city did not meet the same fate as Zhentil Keep.{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|6}} The hearts of his subjects softened thanks to his valiant defense of the city and they accepted his rule with little complaint, allowing his dynasty to claim rights as monarchs. In turn, the rule of Cvaal's government and that of the local church of Bane also softened.\n\nThe next several decades saw the Netherese and the elves of [[Myth Drannor]] quietly trying to exert their influence over the city, but neither of them could claim any real successes.",

The city's guilds decided to concentrate on profiteering instead of cooperating with each other to stabilize the city. Construction efforts were left stagnating, people lost their jobs, and market prices rose dramatically. While the Knights of the Black Fist struggled to maintain a semblance of order, rival factions began forwarding their own interests. As the Welcomers became politically active, criminal deeds and acts of violence became commonplace, legitimate trade became illegal in nature, and the black market became the only reliable way to turn a profit in the city.>{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|7}} \n\nAs Phlan rapidly devolved into a crime-infested cesspool, other nefarious groups like the reborn [[Cult of the Dragon]] began operating throughout the city.
