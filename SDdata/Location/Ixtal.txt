'''Ixtal''' was the easternmost settlement of the [[Maztican]] nation of [[Huacli]], first to fall to the bloodthirsty [[Nexalan]] empire in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ixtal was a minor town with a population somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 [[human]]s. It was located at the southern end of the mountain chain that separated the [[Valley of Nexal]] from the arable valley where the city-state [[Pulco]] stood.

==History==
Ixtal's most notable historic event took place in the 12{{th}} century DR, during the reign of [[Ipana III]] as the [[Revered Counselor]] of [[Nexal]]. During the era of growth, Ipana sought to satisfy the Nexalan deity – Bloody [[Zaltec]]. The Revered Counselor led the empire's armies to subjugate settlements of [[Cordotl]] and [[Palul]] only to be turned around by the defenders of the Maztican nation of [[Kultaka]]. Disheartened by that loss, Revered Counselor Ipana turned his attention to his western neighbor – Huacli. The military campaign was ruinous to the Huacli peoples, and Ixtal fell to the Nexalan armies, becoming yet another subjugated city-state of the empire. For the remainder of the Nexalan empire's existence – into the 14{{th}} century DR, Ixtal paid regular tributes to Nexal – food, precious materials, and slaves.
