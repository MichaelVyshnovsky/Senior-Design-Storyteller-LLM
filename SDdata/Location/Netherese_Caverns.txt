The Netherese Caverns was a large network of caverns.
The Netherese Caverns were located in the Upperdark beneath the Wood of Sharp Teeth.
The caverns were named for the ruins of an ancient Netherese city, Philock, located in the center of the caverns. Tombs found through the caverns were a target for brave treasure hunters.
An unknown evil lurked the caverns, hunting those foolish enough to attempt to loot the ruins and tombs found within.
