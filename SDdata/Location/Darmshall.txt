'''Darmshall''' was a small city in the hostile lands of [[Vaasa]] in the [[Bloodstone Lands]].<ref name=PotWK.M">

==Description==
Darmshall was surrounded by farmland and ranches,

==Geography==
The city sat in the north of the [[Sunderland]], a region of southeastern Vaasa, in the foothills of the [[Galena Mountains]]. It lay at the eastern terminus of [[Dead Man's Walk]], the primary trade route across Vaasa. It was not far south from the [[Vaasan Gate]] of [[Bloodstone Pass]]. The land around the town was dedicated to farming and ranching.

==Defenses==
Darmshall was as much a fortress as it was a city. It was surrounded by capable stone walls lined with siege weaponry and five hundred grizzled soldiers. Beneath the city was a huge storage facility for food and supplies to enable the city to withstand long periods of isolation.

==History==
The city was founded by the [[Tenblades]] adventuring band during the early explorations of the Bloodstone Lands. The group's leader, [[Romas Thunderclap]], built the fortress to act as a bastion of order in Vaasa after two of his companions were murdered. His efforts were successful, as even during the conquests of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], Darmshall never fell, despite being besieged by many [[goblins]].

In the 1460s [[DR]], the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] conquered the city in a quick and bloody siege.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} By [[1480 DR]], the city's granaries served as a breadbasket for their troops stationed in Bloodstone Pass, and the Knights had begun mustering in the city in increasing numbers, preparing for war.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} The city's free population by this time was mostly [[humans]].

==Rumors & Legends==
At some point in the decade after the defeat of the Witch-King Zhengyi, a relic of his mysteriously appeared just north of Darmshall. It was a grand statue of a [[dragon]] that rapidly grew to enormous size, not unlike how [[Castle Perilous]] had appeared over the course of a single night. However, before the dragon could be investigated, it sank into a bog.

==Inhabitants==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the town was inhabited mostly by male settlers of the area drawn to the region following Zhengyi's defeat. The leader of the town, [[Gelgar Talonguard]], was known to send agents to the [[Dragon Reach]], [[Impiltur]], and [[Telflamm]] to try to recruit more females.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|58}} She was mainly concerned with keeping an eye on [[Castle Perilous]] to the north{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|55-56}}

During the reign of the Warlock Knights in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the town was occupied by the Knights' forces and otherwise was mostly populated by [[human]] serfs working as farmers or ranchers. It was notable for having a fairly small non-human population relative to other cities in Vaasa.
