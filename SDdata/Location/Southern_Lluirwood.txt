The Southern Lluirwood, or the Granuin Forest, was a forest in Luiren and Dambrath.
The Southern Lluirwood was located south of the Lluirwood and made up the eastern border of Luiren and the western border of Dambrath.
The Southern Lluirwood was mostly untamed, although the eastern border was patrolled by militia and halfling rangers and druids. A river ran from the center of the forest to the ocean.
The forest was inhabited by monsters, including beholders and yuan-ti.
