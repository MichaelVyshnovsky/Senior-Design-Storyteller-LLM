'''Tilver's Gap''' was a major pass through the [[Thunder Peaks]] that sat at an intersection of the [[Dalelands]], the [[Stonelands]], and [[Cormyr]]. It was home to the independent city of [[Tilverton]], which was annexed by Cormyr and ultimately destroyed by the forces of [[Thultanthar]].

==Geography==
Tilver's Gap cut a wide east-west passage through the northern Thunder Peaks, providing an ideal route through the mountain range. It met the Dalelands and [[Cormanthor]] forest to the east, bordering [[Mistledale]], [[Sessrendale]], and [[Semberholme]]. To the north, the Thunder Peaks met the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], with only the narrow climb of [[Shadow Gap]] allowing passage. Eastwards, the dry plains of the Gap turned to the desolate and inhospitable Stonelands and the foothills of the [[Storm Horns]], while to the south the foothills of the Thunder Peaks were interrupted by the upper [[Immerflow]] river as it ran its course into the heart of Cormyr.{{Cite interactive atlas|Sembia}}

==Trade==
The [[Moonsea Ride]] passed straight through Tilver's Gap, and the [[North Ride]] intersected it at the city of [[Tilverton]] at the western end of the pass. The Gap was critical to trade and travel between Cormyr, the Dalelands, and the [[Moonsea]], and regularly came under threat from foreign agents and barbaric raiders from the Stonelands and beyond. After 1356 DR, Cormyrean soldiers were deployed to patrol these routes, with squads of heavily-equipped mounted warriors supported by [[War Wizards]].

The plains, hills, and forests of the Gap were home to hunters, trappers, prospectors, and loggers, with ranching and [[horse]] breeding also popular. The annexation of Tilverton brought a number of Cormyrean frontiersmen and merchants who saw opportunities in the newly-secured lands.

==History==
In ancient times, the Gap was part of the sprawling woodlands of [[Cormanthor]], linking the western [[Forest Country]] to it through the Thunder Peaks. [[Netheril]] conquered the Gap and held it as its southern frontier, driving the native [[orc]] and [[goblin]] tribes south deeper into the Forest Country, and constructing the fortress of [[Blister]] in [[-1286 DR]]. The fortress overlooked the Gap from the edge of the mountains, and served as a regional base for defending the whole southern frontier and supporting colonial expeditions beyond. Despite the magical and military power of Netheril, the frontier collapsed over centuries and Blister was isolated while orcs and goblins effectively controlled the Gap and future [[Stonelands]]. Blister was finally destroyed in [[-312 DR]] by an army of [[kobold]]s, 27 years after the fall of Netheril.{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|23}}

After Netheril, the only settlement of note in Tilver's Gap was Tilverton, both of which were named after the [[archwizard]] [[Tilvara]] who made her home there. In [[1356 DR]], Cormyr deployed an army of [[Purple Dragons]] to the Gap in order to protect Tilverton from oncoming threats in the region, including marauding [[orc]]s, the [[Zhentarim]], and the conquests of [[Lashan Aumersair]]. In [[Kythorn]] of that year an army of thousands of orcs was destroyed while it besieged Tilverton, and the city shortly agreed to become a protectorate of the Dragon Throne. The [[Purple Dragons]] then used the Gap as a secure base to operate from, striking forth and fighting the Zhentarim in [[Daggerdale]] and adjoining lands.

Tilverton was destroyed during battle with the forces of [[Thultanthar]] in [[1372 DR]], creating the [[Black Crater]]. Despite the loss of the city, Cormyr kept the Gap as part of the realm, going on to fortify the area, reroute the Moonsea Ride, and support the settlement of New Tilverton.{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|15-19}}

The [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] resulted in the Black Crater becoming a [[plagueland]], the [[Tilverton Scar]]. Despite the increased dangers, Cormyr continued to hold onto the region.
