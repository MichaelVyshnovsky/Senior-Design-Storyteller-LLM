        "Geography": "Lorosfyr was a massive chasm located beneath the [[Tortured Land]]s, outside the [[Sharnwall]]. Lorosfyr ran for {{SI|90|mi|k|long=yes}} from east to west and had an average width of {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}}. Lorosfyr was very deep, at some points reaching up to {{SI|40|mi|k|long=yes}} in depth. The chasm was connected to the caves of the [[Buried Realms]].\n\nOn the western side of the chasm, a wide and well-made thoroughfare circled Lorosfyr. At intervals, massive staircases punctuated the road, leading down into the depths of the chasm. It was unknown who constructed both the road and the stairs."
