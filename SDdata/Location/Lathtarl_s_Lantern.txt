'''Lathtarl's Lantern''' (also seen as '''Latharl's Lantern'''The name is commonly written as 'Lathtarl' (with a 't'), but occasionally as 'Latharl' (without a 't'). This article adopts the former spelling as it is much more common.) was a small fishing village on the [[Sword Coast]] at the mouth of the [[Winding Water]]. It was close to [[Warlock's Crypt]].{{Cite dungeon/64/Grotto of the Queen|8}}

==History==
In the 11{{th}} century [[DR]],''Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast'', p. 49, states Lathtarl was active "some 300 years ago". ''Volo's Guide'' is set somewhere between [[1366 DR|1366]] and [[1367 DR]]. a pirate named [[Lathtarl]] crashed ashore here while fleeing the navy of [[Evermeet]]. With his ship destroyed, crew much reduced, and himself crippled, he improvised a plan to crash other unsuspecting vessels against the rocky shore. Word quickly spread among other pirates and slavers that this was a safe harbor—for them, at least.

The pirates eventually stopped crashing ships there after threats from merchants and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].

==Legends==
There were rumors of two dead kings who perished at the marsh at the mouth of the Winding Water: a rebel lord from [[Tethyr]] named King [[Tredarath]] and King [[Beverdaur]] of [[Cortryn]].

==Notable Locations==
;Temples:
* The [[Grotto of the Queen]], a temple to [[Umberlee]] located just north of the town.
;Taverns and Inns:
* The [[Wailing Wave]], a wild tavern/inn.
