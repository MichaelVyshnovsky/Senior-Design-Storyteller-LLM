        "mainbody": "nani was a city on the island of Saishu in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.\nInani stood on the northern tip of Saishu, facing the Yellow Sea.\nAround 1357 DR, a pride of sea lions harassed shipping around Inani. Dan Zor, the leader of Saishu, sought adventurers who would destroy the beasts.\nThe fishermen of Inani, along with those of Ansong, were claimed to be the best in the world, having done such things as eliminate the prides of sea lions in the Straits of Koryo and catch the enormous eel Ghartii Nung.It is not clear whether the fishermen responsible for these achievements came from Inani or Ansong, or both settlements."
