'''Griffonheight Keep''' was a keep and barracks in [[Velprintalar]], [[Aglarond]], situated on a hill.

As of [[1368 DR]], it housed 250 foot soldiers and 50 cavalry, under the command of Sir [[Tyman]]. By [[1374 DR]], the number of foot soldiers had increased to 400, and the cavalry had been replaced by aerial cavalry.

Although it was believed at the time that a [[Thay]]an threat had triggered the buildup of troops, [[Alassra Silverhand|the Simbul]] had detected a threat between the [[Society of the Verdant Arrow]] and the [[Sons of Hoar]] and wished to be prepared.
