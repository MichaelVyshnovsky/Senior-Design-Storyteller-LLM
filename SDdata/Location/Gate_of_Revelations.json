        "mainbody": "The Gate of Revelations was the real entrance into the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nMade from marble streaked with pink and red, the Gate of Revelations was even more beautiful than the Grand Gate of Delights. Skilled dao were used to manipulate the stone so that the color streaks showed a scene of the first Grand Caliph finding the scrolls of the Loregiver.\nA pair of towers flanked the gate. Each was domed with solid gold.\nA compliment of 50 mamluks was stationed at the gate at all times. In addition to these soldiers, mages and priests were also present. Suspicious-looking visitors were usually questioned with magic.\nStrong magical enchantments protected the gate against all forms of destructive magic, including powerful spells such as disintegrate and earthquake.\nA powerful dao would appear to defend the gate in times of crisis.\nEach of the towers housed crossbowmen who could easily rain bolts down upon any attackers. Additionally, the top floor of each tower was dedicated to a special apparatus that could drop large boulders from above.\nAziz min Hajama was the commander of the Gate of Revelations."
