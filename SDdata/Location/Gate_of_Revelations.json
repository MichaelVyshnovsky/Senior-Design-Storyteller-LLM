        "mainbody": "The '''Gate of Revelations''' was the real entrance into the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "Made from [[marble]] streaked with pink and red, the Gate of Revelations was even more beautiful than the [[Grand Gate of Delights]]. Skilled [[dao]] were used to manipulate the stone so that the color streaks showed a scene of the first [[Grand Caliph]] finding the scrolls of the [[Loregiver]].\n\nA pair of towers flanked the gate. Each was domed with solid [[gold]].",
        "Defenses": "A compliment of 50 [[mamluk]]s was stationed at the gate at all times. In addition to these soldiers, mages and priests were also present. Suspicious-looking visitors were usually questioned with magic.\n\nStrong magical enchantments protected the gate against all forms of destructive magic, including powerful spells such as ''[[disintegrate]]'' and ''[[earthquake]]''.\n\nA powerful dao would appear to defend the gate in times of crisis.\n\nEach of the towers housed crossbowmen who could easily rain bolts down upon any attackers. Additionally, the top floor of each tower was dedicated to a special apparatus that could drop large boulders from above.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Aziz min Hajama]] was the commander of the Gate of Revelations."
