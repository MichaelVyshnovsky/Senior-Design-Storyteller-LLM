The '''Deep Wastes''' formed a small domain part of the vast [[Underdark]] hidden away underneath the surface of the [[Dalelands]] and the [[Moonsea]]. 

==Geography==
Stretching from the [[Earthspur Mountains]] with few entrances from the surface, a large portion of the Deep Wastes remained unexplored by travelers of the more adventurous type.

==Geographical features==
===Abyss and rifts===
*[[Lorosfyr]]

==Inhabitants==
The region was sparsely populated due to the collapse of the [[drow]] city of [[Maerimydra]] which once held [[Shadowdale]] as a conquered surface land. Around [[1372 DR]], the abandoned drow city was in ruins.
