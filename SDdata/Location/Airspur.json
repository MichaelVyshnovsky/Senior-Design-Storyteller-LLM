        "mainbody": "'''Airspur''' was the capital of [[Akanûl]]. The city was located on two cliffs facing a narrow bay. Many buildings were located on [[earthmote]]s that floated over the bay and were connected to each other and the cliffs by bridges. Although there were some [[human]] residents in Airspur, the majority of inhabitants were [[genasi]] with airsouls and stormsouls the most common variety.",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Spellplague]], Airspur was a city-state allied variously with [[Chessenta]] or [[Chondath]]. When the Spellplague struck in [[1385 DR]] most of the genasi nation of [[Shyr]] was translocated from [[Abeir]] to [[Toril]]. The Spellplague opened the huge gorge that runs through the city and moved the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Most of the population died during the catastrophe.\n\nAround [[1429 DR]], Queen [[Cyndra]] led the survivors of [[Brassune]] to the Airspur, displacing its [[orc]] and [[half-orc]] inhabitants, and rebuilding the city into the new home of the displaced [[genasi]].\n\nAs of the [[1490 DR|1490s DR]] decade, the earth motes that made up Airspur still float, even after the [[Second Sundering]] caused others across Faerûn to fall.<ref>",
        "Government": "Airspur was ruled by a hereditary monarch who was advised by a council of genasi, known as the [[Four Stewards]]. As of [[1479 DR]], the kinggdom was ruled by Queen [[Arathane]]. All important government positions were occupied by genasi.",
        "Military": "Airspur and Akanûl were defended by the elite [[Sky Guard]], [[Ground Defense League]] and [[Wave Riders]] which formed the core of the military. Other troops were conscripted into the military when needed.",
        "Religion": "The genasi from Abeir were ruled by [[primordials]] and did not worship gods. They were slow to adopt the worship of [[Faerûn|Faerûn's]] gods and no temples existed in Airspur. The Steward of the Sea blocked construction of temples on the grounds that temples would take up space better used for other purposes.",
        "Organizations": {
            "Airsteppers Guild": "This guild of [[windsoul genasi]] acted as messengers within Airspur.",
            "Firestorm Cabal": "The Airspur chapter of the Cabal was filled with rogues and scofflaws who engaged in many questionable activities including raids of caravans and neighboring countries in the guise of protecting the border.  Queen Arathane tolerated the Cabal because they undertook secret missions on her behalf.  The Cabal clandestinely experimented with [[wild magic]] and conducted research into [[spellplague]] changed creatures.",
            "House Norjah": "A noble house most notable in that almost all its members were [[vampires]].{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|4298}}"
