        "mainbody": "loakerhaven was a cave located in Lowerdark.\nCloakerhaven was home to a settlement of at least two hundred cloakers. There were no structures, instead the cloakers lived in hollowed out areas within the stalactites and stalagmites found throughout the cavern. These hollowed out areas were smooth and round, and lacked any stairs.\nThe settlement was carved by captured enslaved humanoids. Once their tasks were complete, they were killed and eaten by the cloakers. The remains of the slave camp remained in the southern part of the cave, grown over by a species of phosphorescent fungus.\nAny humanoid who entered Cloakerhaven became prey. They were usually overwhelmed by attacks by a multitude of cloakers, who attacked in a frenzied state rare to the species.\nCloakerhaven was a large cave, up to  wide and  high. Long stalactites and stalagmites reached from the caverns floor and ceiling, with some connecting to form columns."
