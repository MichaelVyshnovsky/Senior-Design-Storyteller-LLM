The nation of '''Sossal''' ({{Pronounce|SAW|sall|refs=}}) was located in the [[Cold Lands]] of [[northeast Faerûn]].

==Geography== 
This chilly place was locked between [[Pelvuria]] and [[Yal Tengri]].

==Government==
From its founding in [[331 DR]] to [[1319 DR]] the nation of Sossal was ruled under a system of monarchy. Following the death of its then-leader at that latter date, the nation was ruled by a [[druid]] conclave known as the [[Circle of the Frozen Sun]].

==Trade==
Due to how remote it was, the land of Sossal had very little contact with the rest of [[Faerûn]] outside of trade. Sossal's only known trade city was [[Naupau]], a port on the shores of the [[Yal Tengri]]. The sailors of Sossal were rumored to know of a secret passage through the ice pack northwest from the Yal Tengri to the [[Trackless Sea]], and tales were told of strange ships matching their description sailing as far south as [[Calimshan]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[-2320 DR]], a clan of [[Rashemi]] migrated north and settled in the alpine valleys of the [[Armridge Mountains]]. Over time, their descendants would come to be known as the [[Sossrim]].

In the {{YearlinkName|331}}, the Sossrim living around the [[Great Glacier]] were united by [[Ylaethar|Ylaethar "The Bear"]], who proclaimed himself to be Ornath (king). He went on lead the Sossrim south from their ancestral lands and founded the nation of Sossal. 

At the height of the [[Raumathar]] Empire's power, they briefly ruled over land of Sossal.

In the {{YearlinkName|991}}, the land of Sossal was rocked by a series of earthquakes. These tremors opened fissures in the nearby Great Glacier and several powerful [[demon]]s that had been trapped below since the fall of [[Narfell]] were unleashed. Under the guidance of then-ruler [[Londraeth]], the kingdom managed to vanquish the rampaging horde.

In the {{YearlinkName|1319}}, the monarchy of Sossal collapsed when then-leader [[Thelessar]] was murdered by his twin sons [[Norlith]] and [[Baldraeth]]. Both were banished from Sossal for this transgression by the nation's spiritual leader, the Great Druid [[Ulthorkh]]. He and his druid conclave, the Circle of the Frozen Sun, would soon after take over the role of governing the nation.

In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[Dabron Sashenstar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] embarked on a voyage to Sossal. He would later return with a hauberk from the land, which would go on display within the Hall of Exploration in the [[House of the Moon]].<ref>

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Sossal remained an isolated nation, both in terms of location and diplomacy.

==Notable Locations==
;[[Naupau]]: a port trade city along the Great Ice Sea.
;[[Mount Sundabar]]: a mountain upon which the great [[Aerie of the Snow Eagles]] had been built in replacement of the mountaintop, that was sheared off during the [[Dareth]] [[Hoarfaern]] war.
;[[Heroes' Height]]: a lonesome mountain where the last remnants of [[Dareth]] and [[Hoarfaern]] both perished in climactic battle.
