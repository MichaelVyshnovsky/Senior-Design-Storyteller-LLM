'''Xunqaq''' was the capital city of the [[beholder]] realm of [[Xun'Qoroth]].

==Notable Locations==
A two-way ''[[portal]]'' leading to [[Ooltul]] was located somewhere in Xunqaq. This gateway was used nightly to ferry slaves bearing [[scroll]]s, [[gem]]s, minor artifacts of ancient [[Netheril]] and new beholder configurations. Once the [[Sharn Wall]] was compromised in the {{yearlinkName|1371}}, the ''portal'' functioned as an emergency escape for the [[phaerimm]]s that secretly ruled the realm.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Rilathdool]], [[elder orb]] puppet ruler of Xun'Qoroth.
