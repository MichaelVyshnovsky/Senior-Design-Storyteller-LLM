        "History": "''Circa'' [[1342 DR]], a young underpriest from the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]] named [[Kortolt Rushtyn]] found the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the most holy book of the [[church of Ilmater|faith]] of Ilmater. Kortolt took the ''Tome'' to Raven's Rack and used it to aid both believers and non-believers, and to preach about Ilmater. The people of Hlondeth came to see Kortolt as a gift from the gods, one who kept them safe and well when they were sick or injured. However, Kortolt was killed by bandits in winter of the [[1343 DR|Year of the Boot, 1343 DR]]."
