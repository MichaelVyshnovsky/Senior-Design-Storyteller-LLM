        "Description": {
            "Climate": "Both the summer and winter months were particularly harsh on the residents of the marshes. The land grew dry and even hardened over during the summer, and freezing temperatures in the winter caused the water to freeze over and become largely unnavigable."
        },
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The [[Tun River]] originated in the marsh, flowed south towards the [[Dragonmere]]. Both the river and the marsh would flood during heavy rains,",
            "Flora & Fauna": "A variety of wild animals could be found in the marshes, including: a variety of small mammals like [[weasel]]s, [[otter]]s, [[beaver]]s, and [[mountain lion]]s; [[bird]]s including [[duck]]s, [[egret]]s, and [[heron]]s; and massive [[centipede]]s."
        },
        "History": "The region was once home to an ancient civilization lost to time. The remnants of their astonishingly resilient structures were buried beneath the wetlands.\n\nIt originally consisted of a freshwater lake, known as Farsea Lake, that was surrounded by forest planted in rich, moist and deep soil. After the rotational shift of [[Toril]] in the {{YearlinkName|1038}},> the water level of Farsea Lake dropped, causing it's shores to become marshy. Insects bred uncontrolled among the remaining stagnant water, and as the weather became warmer and drier in the following decades, the entire lake became merely a wetland.\n\nThis wetland eventually joined with the [[Tun Marshes|Marsh of Tun]] some time after the [[Spellplague]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], to form the [[Farsea Swamp]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to 14{{th}} century [[bard]]s, the ancient realm that predated the marshes were the realms of two city-states that were each governed by a pair of lovers, whose romance turned sour. It was said that they each poisoned the land of the other, under the advice of an old crone, who was in fact the goddess [[Talona]].",
        "Notable Locations": "Known villages found in the marshes included Easthome, Coldhaven, Oakmere, Willowbank, Silverpool, and [[Greenroot]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Perhaps the most well-known of the marsh's inhabitants were the [[Marsh Drover]]s, an welcoming people whose ancestors hailed from ancient kingdom of [[Anauria]]. They dwelled in small villages and lived off the land, herding groups of domesticated [[catoblepas]].\n\nThe marsh was home to a particularly devious [[black dragon]] that was referred to as [[Forgrimmorithal]].\n\nA variety of monstrous and deadly creatures could be found in the Farsea Marshes, including [[troll]]s, [[bullywug]]s, [[giant frog]]s, [[lizardfolk]], and several types of [[hydra]]s. It was believed that no less than two [[gulguthydra]] made their lairs within the wetlands, as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Reports stated that they were followed by a number of [[gazer]]s, a form of [[beholderkin]]."
