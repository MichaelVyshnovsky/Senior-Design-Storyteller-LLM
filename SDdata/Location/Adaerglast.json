Its coastline was sometimes known as the '''Garden Coast''' because it was one of the most fertile areas of farmland in [[Faerûn]]. \"Adaernen\" was the word used to describe inhabitants of Adaerglast.",
        "History": "Some time ago (the exact year is not clear){{timescale}}, two [[mage]]s named [[Iraun]] and [[Srivven]] immigrated from [[Murghôm]] and built a castle in the city of [[Myrinjar]]. The castle became known as the Castle of Dark Dreams because the mages sent out magical dreams to the city's inhabitants that appeared to show them as the rightful rulers of Adaerglast. The mages adopted bodyguards and other servants to do their bidding and killed those who they deemed to be traitors. These traitors' lands were seized and their relatives sold into slavery.{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms/Adaerglast}}\n\nAn alliance of wizards and temples from the nearby town of [[Yallasch]] was supported by [[Halruaa]] and [[Waterdeep]] and stood guard against invasion by Iraun and Srivven. Various attempts were made to defeat the mages, but the [[Zhentarim]], [[Red Wizards]], and an emissary from Halruaa all failed. An unsuccessful attempt by the [[Calishite]]s was made using magic to try to turn the mages against one another.",
