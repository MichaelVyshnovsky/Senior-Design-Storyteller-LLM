        "mainbody": "The '''Witch Fen''' was one a malevolent swamp located in the [[Feywild]], formed from a river corrupted by [[Magra Curse-Eye]] and her coven of [[fomorian]] witches.",
        "Geography": "The fen could be found in the twisted region of the Feywild known as the [[dark fey enclave]].",
        "History": "When the fomorian witches proved to be a grave threat to the people of [[New Sharandar]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Iliyanbruen]] elves of the settlement took swift action. Their agent [[Triste]] orchestrated a plan to bypass the defenses of several witches by using [[adder's tongue]] leaves and their personal cauldrons, working alongside an [[adventurer]] from the city of [[Neverwinter]].\n\nThe [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] was able to sabotage the cauldrons of three witches and gathered enough alchemical reagents to gain access to Magra Curse-Eye herself. The hero defeated Magra and her minions in battle, finally toppling the fomorian coven that poisoned a large swathe of Feywild land.",
        "Inhabitants": "Beyond being the personal lair of Magra Curse-Eye, the fen was home to several other fomorian witches including [[Mab]], [[Nyx]], and [[Usha]]. It was overrun with their [[dark fey]] servitors, among which were scores of evil [[redcap]]s, hideous [[troll]]s, and [[cyclops]] brutes."
