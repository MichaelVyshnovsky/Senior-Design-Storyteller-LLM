'''Fij''' was a city in [[Tabot]].

==Geography==
It stood at the southern foot of the [[Kun-Yen Shan]] in northwestern Tabot, amidst the forests there, and south of the high mountain lake named [[Nad Ho Ting]]. A road ran west to [[Nad Ho]] and another ran south to [[Draya]].{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, a fire razed over half of the city and left countless people homeless. The lamas of [[M'tsin Gompa]] sent workers and emergency relief to Fij in an effort to rebuild before the cold winter month of Maki.<ref>
