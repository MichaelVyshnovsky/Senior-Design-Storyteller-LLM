Fij was a city in Tabot.
It stood at the southern foot of the Kun-Yen Shan in northwestern Tabot, amidst the forests there, and south of the high mountain lake named Nad Ho Ting. A road ran west to Nad Ho and another ran south to Draya.
In , a fire razed over half of the city and left countless people homeless. The lamas of Mtsin Gompa sent workers and emergency relief to Fij in an effort to rebuild before the cold winter month of Maki.
