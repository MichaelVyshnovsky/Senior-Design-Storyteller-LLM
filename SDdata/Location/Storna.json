        "Geography": "Storna was fairly large, but uninhabited at the time Molipher took it over. It was located about a day's sail southwest of the [[Dragonisle]], some distance off the coast of Telpir. It was dangerous to approach the island because the water was shallow and the only harbor had many rocks (and shipwrecks) as hazardous obstructions. The only structure on the island was the temporary house that Molipher built for a place to stay and meet with his partners.",
        "History": "Molipher was a former [[pirate]] who decided to change professions after getting on the bad side of some [[slavery|slavers]]. He acquired a [[deepspawn]] from the estate of one of his victims in [[Saerloon]] and decided to use it to produce creatures to feed other monsters. His three partners, [[Halartan Groune]], [[Orbel Mhaerouzan]], and [[Gorstal Hammers]],{{Cite dragon/282/The New Adventures of Volo: The Urge to Hunt|72}}",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the deepspawn, creatures known to have been advertised for a Dark Dragon Hunt included wild [[boar]], [[lion]]s, [[behir]], [[wyvern]]s, [[stinger]]s, [[manticore]]s, and a [[chimera]]."
