        "mainbody": "he House of Tezca was a large desert found in south of Nexal on the continent of Maztica. It was named after Tezca, the Maztican god of the sun and heat.\nThe House of Tezca was a bleak, barren land of sand and stone. In it could be found Sunstone and Tewahca, the City of the Gods. After Qotals return and the flight of many refugees from Nexal, Qotal caused a series of oases to spring up in a line down the middle of the desert, and a larger lake near the center of the desert itself, inside a fertile valley. It was by that lake that Nexalans built a new city, Tukan.\nThe House of Tezca was inhabited only by desert dwarves, who lived in small villages cut directly into canyon walls.\nSometime in the distant past, Tewahca was built, including the massive pyramid upon which Zaltec and Qotal fought their legendary battle.\nAt some point, during the reign of Chalco, the Nexalan Empire sent an army across the northern part of the House of Tezca to conquer Kolan. Later, in the year 1362 DR, Qotal caused a series of oases to spring up in a line along the middle of the desert, and a lake in a fertile valley in the center of the desert. Here the Nexala people established Tukan."
