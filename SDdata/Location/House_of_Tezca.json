        "mainbody": "The '''House of Tezca''' was a large desert found in south of [[Nexal]] on the continent of [[Maztica]]. It was named after [[Tezca]], the Maztican god of the sun and heat.",
        "Geography": "The House of Tezca was a bleak, barren land of sand and stone. In it could be found [[Sunstone (lake)|Sunstone]] and [[Tewahca]], the City of the Gods. After [[Qotal]]'s return and the flight of many refugees from Nexal, Qotal caused a series of oases to spring up in a line down the middle of the desert, and a larger lake near the center of the desert itself, inside a fertile valley. It was by that lake that Nexalans built a new city, [[Tukan]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The House of Tezca was inhabited only by [[Desert dwarf|desert dwarves]], who lived in small villages cut directly into canyon walls.",
        "History": "Sometime in the distant past, Tewahca was built, including the massive pyramid upon which [[Zaltec]] and Qotal fought their legendary battle.\n\nAt some point, during the reign of Chalco, the Nexalan Empire sent an army across the northern part of the House of Tezca to conquer [[Kolan]]. Later, in the year [[1362|1362 DR]], Qotal caused a series of oases to spring up in a line along the middle of the desert, and a lake in a fertile valley in the center of the desert. Here the Nexala people established Tukan."
