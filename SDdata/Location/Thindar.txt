'''Thindar''' was a large city and the capital of [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Geography==
Thindar was located in the center of Thindol along the northwestern shores of the [[Thingulph]].

==Description==
Thindar was an unwalled city that sprawled across a marsh that had been filled in. The grasslands surrounding the city shimmered in the sun, giving the illusion that the city was surrounded by water and prompted the nickname the '''City in the Waves'''.

==Inhabitants==
Most of the wealthy citizens who dominated Thindar were of [[Tashluta]]n heritage.

==Activities==
Thindar was the center of all trade within the [[Thindol Basin]] and was often the last port of call for any ships sailing west around the [[Horn of Chult]].

==History==
Much of [[Old Thindar]] was sunk beneath the waves as each storm passing over the city slowly eroded the port district. Aware of the issue, any new construction by the Thindolese occurred on Thindar's north side further from the Thingulph. Brave [[adventurer]]s often tried to search the submerged ruins for hidden treasure but few returned because of the presence of [[yuan-ti]].
