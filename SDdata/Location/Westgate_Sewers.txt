The '''sewers of Westgate''' were a sanitation system beneath the city of [[Westgate|the same name]].

==Structure==
A large portion of these sewers were regularly in a flooded state.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|169}}
===Functionality===
As Westgate was built around a natural harbor on the southern coast of the [[Inner Sea]], at the mouth of the [[River Thunn]], the city's sewers emptied into there. The sewers fouled the water of the harbor,{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|95}} making those who swam in it likely to catch a [[disease]].

===Sewer Ecology===
A variety of terrible aquatic monsters were said to lair within these sewers. The most notable of them was a great [[quelzarn]], which was known to occasionally snatch sailors from off the decks of ships moored in Westgate's harbor.<ref> This was such common knowledge among Westhavians, that bouncers of the [[Black Eye]] throwing combatants into the harbor was referred to as "feeding the quelzarn."<ref>

===Surface Connections===
* [[Castle Thalavar]] had a hidden trapdoor that led into the sewers, which was often utilized by [[Levia Shadewalker]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|90}}
* [[River Bridge]] had a sewer grate situated beneath it.<ref><ref>{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|160}}

==Groups of Interest==

;[[Ebon Claws]]: This criminal organization's hideout was situated within the sewers.<ref>
;[[Night Masks]]: This criminal organization operated numerous safehouses in the sewers.<ref>

==Rumors & Legends==
