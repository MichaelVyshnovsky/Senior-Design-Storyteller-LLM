The Dawn Titans Spire was a monolithic structure located in Eskorn, Laerakond.
The Dawn Titans Spire was a monolith of about  tall and the appearance of a slender, milk-white fang. It was made of a substance that looked like marble but was harder than iron.
In 1479 DR, Dramar Lornen was having dreams of the spire. These gradually caused her to be obsessed with them, concocting many plans of how she could gain access to it. 
Laerakondan scholars believed this place was the home of a dormant primordial who wasnt defeated by dragons during the War of Fang and Talon, but still chose to withdrawn from the world all the same.
