The '''Dawn Titan's Spire''' was a monolithic structure located in [[Eskorn]], [[Laerakond]].

==Description==
The Dawn Titan's Spire was a monolith of about {{SI|2|mi|long=yes}} tall and the appearance of a slender, milk-white fang. It was made of a substance that looked like [[marble]] but was harder than [[iron]].

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], [[Dramar Lornen]] was having dreams of the spire. These gradually caused her to be obsessed with them, concocting many plans of how she could gain access to it. 

==Background==
[[Laerakond]]an scholars believed this place was the home of a dormant [[primordial]] who wasn't defeated by [[dragon]]s during the [[War of Fang and Talon]], but still chose to withdrawn from the world all the same.
