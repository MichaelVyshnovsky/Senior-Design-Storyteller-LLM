Neachal Fountain was a large gyser located in the Endless Wastes.
Located along the Old Iron Road, Neachal Fountain served as the edge marker of a thermal basin that lay south of the road. Caravans avoided this area due to dangers such as hot springs, and mud pits, many of which were hidden by thin layers of dirt that looked like normal ground.
The nomads of the area considered the site holy for being a “nostril of the earth god.”
The waters from this area were used as an ingredient in potions that removed curses, due to the minerals found here.
