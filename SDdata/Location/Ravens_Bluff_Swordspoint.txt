The Swordspoint neighborhood of Ravens Bluff was a modest collection of residences, shops, and other noted landmarks of the citys Temple District. While it lacked the luxury and opulence of say Holyhouses or Altarside, it was a popular destination for Ravenians with many notable and fascinating sights.
This region of Ravens Bluff earned its name from the great number of duels that were once fought on its streets (though, as of 1370 DR, these had been banned within the city). The five-way intersection of roads on the northwestern corner of DeVillars Park was known as "Bloody Boots" for the bloody footprints of a victorious duelist that long stained the streets.
