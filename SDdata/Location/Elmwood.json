Near the Docks, three robust structures made by oak and brick were used as warehouses.\nGrange A wood and stone emporium run by Tayrom Onetry, where a trader could find nearly everything, except for armor and weapons.\nElmwood was founded in the , as a stopover for ships to and from the River Lis.

The place was neutral and the people kept to themselves, protected both by their isolation and the fact that there was little worth taking by force.\nThe residents of Elmwood told legends of a vicious dragon turtle, the size of their town, who dwelt in the depths of the lake."
