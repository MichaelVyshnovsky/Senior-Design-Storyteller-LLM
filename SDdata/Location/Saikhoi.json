Formerly known as Thakos, in ancient times it was the capital of the eastern Imaskar Empire and of the successor empire Anok-Imaskar.\nAfter the land of Khati was annexed by the Imaskari during the height of the Imaskar Empire ( to ), the city of Thakos rose as the capital of the eastern empire through the Middle Kingdoms period ( to ).\nThe Imaskar Empire fell in , but the eastern provinces Khati and Katakoro emerged relatively unscathed. Thus, in , Kujawa claimed the Dragon Throne in Thakos and declared himself Emperor, founding a new realm, Anok-Imaskar, with Khati at its heart. Kujawa died fighting a great tien lung dragon in . His death led to the empire fracturing into warring states, among them the new independent realm called Ra-Khati.\nIn the centuries to come, however, Thakos would fall into ruins. In , Tan Chin dug through the ruins of Thakos and discovered potent Imaskari artifacts, with which he seized the throne of ancient Shou Lung.\nIn time, the city would be rebuilt and become known as Saikhoi.\nNestled deep within the Katakoro Shan range, Saikhoi sat between the two sacred lakes of Norasil and Manasowar.\nSaikhoi was the home of the ruler of Ra-Khati, the Dalai Lama.\nAny outsider who saw the sacred city of Saikhoi was never permitted to leave."
