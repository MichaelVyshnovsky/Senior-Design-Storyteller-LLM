Shallain Freehold was a small family landholding in Shadowdale during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The place was a few tens of miles away from Freedale, and not that much further from the town of Shadowdale. It lay along a minor trail between Freedale itself and Dagger Falls.
Like other such freeholds, it was largely independent.
As of the mid-to-late 14 century, Shallain Freehold was one of many small landholdings named after the family inhabiting it.
The holding was named after its local family, presumably Shallain.
