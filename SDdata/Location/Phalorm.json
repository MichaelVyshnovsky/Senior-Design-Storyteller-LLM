It wrapped around the [[High Moor]], the eastern and southern edges of which was secured by a string of human-built fortifications.

            "The Old North": "The era of Phalorm's founding was marked by repeated setbacks and disasters for the people of the North. In the {{YearlinkName|302}}, the [[Illuskan]] city of [[Tavaray]] sank into the [[Lizard Marsh]] and was abandoned. In [[342 DR]] a horde of orcs from the [[High Moor]] destroyed the realm of [[Athalantar]], but was itself destroyed by a temporary alliance between the elves of [[Ardeep]] and the dwarves of [[Dardath]]. Shortly afterwards at the final [[Council of Illefarn]], the ancient elven realm of [[Illefarn]] was formally dissolved after centuries of decline and fragmentation, and the populations of [[Iliyanbruen]] and [[Rilithar]] largely retreated to [[Evermeet]]. As the last remaining elven realm of the region, Ardeep found itself especially isolated. Realising the changing state of the world, King [[Ruardh Lightshiver]] of Ardeep and King [[Torghatar]] of [[Dardath]] began working together in earnest to create a lasting partnership that would unite the civilized peoples of [[the North]] in mutual protection. Formed in the {{YearlinkName|342}}, they named this alliance Illefarn, to the exasperation of later scholars.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Tavaray and Athalantar in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], waves of [[Tethyrian]] human and halfling migrants from the [[Shoon Imperium]] largely subsumed the remaining Illuskan inhabitants of the region.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|6}} Further up the [[Delimbiyr River]], halflings and humans from the Vale were joined by refugees from [[Meiritin]] fleeing the depredations of [[Cortryn]], and founded [[Secomber]] in the {{YearlinkName|516}} atop the ruins of [[Hastarl]].",
