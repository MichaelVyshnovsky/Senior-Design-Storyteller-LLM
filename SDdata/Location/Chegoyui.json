        "mainbody": "Chegoyui was a city in the Plain of Horses of northwestern Kara-Tur or the northeastern Hordelands. It was the home of the Kashghun tribe.\nIt lay in the southwestern desert region of the Plain of Horses,\nAlthough Chegoyui was the largest settlement in the desert, it was actually more of an assemblage of small villages. Yurts fashioned from camel and sheep hides made up the majority of houses, while other buildings were of brick, and none of them reached more than one story in height. The headquarters of the ruling qaghan was one of these brick buildings, with only colorful flags on the roof to mark it. All these villages were ringed by one stone wall, less for defense and more to shield them against the desert winds.\nOx-drawn carts were used for travel within the city. These were fairly basic, being little more than a few planks over four wheels. Nevertheless, trains of thirty to forty of these were regularly led around Chegoyui by only a horse-rider.\nThe Kashghun were peaceful traders and from Chegoyui they controlled all trade routes between the Plain of Horses and Shou Lung.\n* Marash Rashi, an aged livestock trader\n* Razak Irdi, a horse thief"
