        "mainbody": "The '''Grand Gate of Delights''' was the main entrance for the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "This gate complex consisted of two gates and a pair of towers that stood 90 ft. (27 m) high. One of the gates was made from white [[marble]] and the other from fine [[alabaster]]. The first gate was decorated with gems and [[gold]] depicting a mage flying on a carpet. The second gate was inlaid with [[silver]] and white gems showing a [[djinni]] flying through the sky.",
        "Defenses": "As shown by the images adorning the artistic gates, the Grand Gate was protected by both magic and [[genie]]s in addition to soldiers.\n\nA [[wizard]] using a ''[[monocle of magic detection]]'' made note of any visitor radiating a magical aura. The visitor would not necessarily be stopped for carrying magical items, but they would be watched closely.\n\nA large gong was used in dire circumstances. If struck, hundreds of additional soldiers and dozens of mages would arrives within moments.",
        "Activities": "The gates were usually left open, allowing thousands of visitors into the Palace each day.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Sedji al-Sanje]] commanded the gate guards and [[Naib ibn-Sodar]] commanded the wizards assigned to the Grand Gate."
