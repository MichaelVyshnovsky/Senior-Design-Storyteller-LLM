Ceremorphs
Golems
The Ring Caverns together were the main district of Oryndoll. They were connected to the Thrall Caverns district. The district housed many of the illithids, ceremorphs, and golems that lived in the city.
The walls of these caverns were heavily engraved to give the appearance of exposed brain tissue. The outer walls of the district displayed religious doctrine mixed with directions in Qualith written on top of the engravings. The caverns were humid.
The general architectural layout of each cavern was a series of tubes.
At the core of each ring cavern was a sphere where most social activity between illithids occurred in shallow basins. The walls of the spheres were peppered with the private living quarters of many of the illithid denizens of the city on all levels, much of which was only accessible via levitation or other forms of magical or mundane flight.
Connected to the core of each ring cavern through tubes was an external tube in the shape of a ring that circled around it. This external tube also connected to the external tubes of the other ring caverns and had several carved alcoves used by Creeds and ulitharid leadership.
