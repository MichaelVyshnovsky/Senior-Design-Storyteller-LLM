Crimmor, also known as the City of Caravans or the Caravan Capital of Amn, was a fortified city and the focal point of practically all trades between the Sword Coast North and the Lands of Intrigue. The constant stream of travelers made it the most diverse Amnian city.
Built on the southern shore of the Alandor River, Crimmor was a city constantly bustling with life. A strong stink of ox dung filled the streets, courtesy of the unusual quantity of wagons roaming them. Caravaneers set camp outside of the city, filling the southern lands with tents and cattle.
thumb|300px|right|Crimmor and the surrounding region, circa 1479 DR
Alandor River Flowing from Lake Weng to the Sea of Swords. Trade goods were loaded on barges towed up and down the river by horses and mules.
Eshpurta Road Going eastwards, this was the most important east-west road in northern Amn. Along this road were warehouses, tanneries, paddocks and slaughterhouses. 
River Road Going west alongside the Alandor river, this road led to the capital city of Athkatla. Riding along this road, one would find estates of wealthy Amnians until half a day away from the city.
Trade Way Extending in both directions, this major trading route led to both Baldurs Gate to the north and Calimport to the south
Traveling towards the north was difficult, as the soft river bottom made it hard to build bridges. Travelers had to either pay a barge to get them on the other side, or take a long detour (usually towards the east).
On most days, a thin haze of dust hanged over the city, flung around by the beasts hoofs. On rare occasions a westbound wind cleaned the dust from the air, bringing with it the reeks of tanneries, paddocks and slaughterhouses.
Rain was a common occurrence in Crimmor, happening in short but severe downpours two to three times almost every morning. In addition mists caused by the river would cover the city every morning, until dispersed by the sun.
During the 14 Century DR, the lands east of the city were plagued with dust storms. A local druid circle, the Flamenar, tried to reduce this issue by planting new trees on the surrounding hills.
During winter the region was covered by so much ice and snow that traveling with draft animals was impossible. During this time caravans stopped running, and the rare short and tedious trips were accomplished using humanoid-pulled sledges.
Inside the city no space was dedicated to parks or gardens. On the limit of the Keepclear near the Orc Road, visitors could find the first trees a majority of duskwoods, as well as some felsuls. Those trees were a favorite playground of local children, and marked the beginning of the area where visiting caravans would set up their encampments. Lovers and paramours used to meet near those trees, but this tradition declined over time as caravan-riders enjoyed playing pranks on such couples.
Outside of the city gardens produced a variety of goods such as apples and pears. Some of those gardens were tended by the clergy of Chauntea.
Most domesticated animals inside Crimmor were draft animals &mdashmostly oxes and mules&mdash as well as riding-horses and coach-horses. The badges were issued by the Thaeldorn and served to prove that the animal belonged to a tax-paying citizen, as visitors were forbidden to bring their own beasts of burden inside the city.
Crimmans kept few pets, as cats and dogs were banned from the city&mdashexcept as caged cargoes. The locals hunted those pests using stones, poisons and drowning-traps whenever given a chance.
thumb|right|130px|Mayor Corlyn Braen
The city was ruled by the Thaeldorn, which was a name used to refer to both the building housing the Mayor, and the employees therein. Leading over them was the Alandor-Lord and Thaele of Crimmon, which people usually called the mayor.
Corlyn Braen was the mayor circa 1374 DR. He was known to be fair-minded and well-meaning, wanting the best for the city and its inhabitants.
Crimmor had several protectionist laws related to the handling of commercial goods. A whole economy was built around those laws, allowing jobs such as dockhands, wagonmakers and drovers to thrive.
* Only oxen and mules belonging to Crimmor citizens could enter the city.
* It was forbidden to build shore-docks outside the city walls, to prevent evading inspection and fees.
Multiple organizations worked together to keep the city and its inhabitants safe
* The Crimmor Guard employed 500 well-disciplined and well-armed combatants. They wore chainmail under their tabards and fought using slings, longswords and daggers. Numerous patrols watched over the streets of the city, and were typically strong of a dozen guards.
* Strong of 125 men and women, the Bargemen patrolled the Alandor River, the westbound River Road, and the docks. They wore tabards emblazoned with the citys symbol.
* The Shadow Thieves regulated criminal activities in the city, and enforced a strict no-theft policy.
* Although this was seldom necessary, the Crytrapper family could supplement the guard with 400 more troops from its estates around the city.
In addition, the authorities were known to hire mercenaries to increase the city defenses in case of necessity.
The Thaeldorn were known for their swift justice an offender would usually be brought before a magistrate on the same day they were apprehended, or before noon if they were caught at night. Holding cells were built on the ground-floor of every tower alongside the city wall, and were used to incarcerate troublemakers awaiting their judgement.  A more secure dungeon was built under the Thaeldorn, and was used for prisoners sentenced to long-term imprisonment.
thumb|left|150px|The wagon-on-barge, symbol of Crimmor.
Two different symbols were used to represent the city
* The simplest and most usual one was the wagon-on-barge. It was stamped on the badges signaling animals belonging to tax-payers, and was displayed on the city guards tabards.
* A more complex heraldry figured a thick horizontal blue line on a white background, on which three eight-spoked wagon wheels were centered&mdashthe central one overlapping the outer two. The blue bar represented the river, whereas the overlapping wheels represented caravan trade.
Being a corner of the trading routes between Amn and the Sword Coast North, Crimmor had a vibrant economy revolving around trade goods and the people moving them. The city housed five major guilds representing dockhands and drovers, as well as other trades supporting them.
Thanks to the ban forbidding visitors to bring draft animals inside the city, Crimman teams of drovers performed dozen of trips daily between the docks and the Drovers Gate, moving wagons from barges to caravans and vice versa. Individual drovers used mules to deliver smaller shipments (e.g. chests, crates, kegs) to addresses within the city walls. It was common for such drovers to cry carry in the caravan-yards to advertise their services.
The most iconic wagonmaker of the city, Zan Zoldaftel, was known far and wide to produce the best carts one could buy.
Crimmor counted many smithies, most of which were located in the southern Wheel Ward of the city. The city was also a major jewelry-making center, although jewelry produced there was seen as inferior to the one produced in other places.
Finally, the city produced and exported a quantity of agricultural goods, such as apples, barley, corn, hops, malt, oats, pears, mild and sweet peppers, winter wheat, beers and ales.
thumb|right|400px|Sign indicating that a sale was ongoing inside a shop.
It was said that in Crimmor anything could be bought, copied, repaired or altered.  The numerous shops of the city were cluttered, noisy and always busy. Merchants opened shops from mistclear to dusk, but could handle restocking and deliveries all night long.
While items sold in shops had price tags, no laws required merchants to sell anything at the indicated price.
Customers who broke items were expected to pay for the damage, and purchases were usually wrapped by merchants unless asked otherwise.
By decree of the Mayor, it was forbidden for customers to outbid each other for swifter service. The practice was still active in some shop, but done in secret.
thumb|left|400px|Inside a Crimman club.
Festhalls, called Clubs, were an important aspect of the Crimman culture. Many townsfolk would meet in those dining halls to eat their main meal of the day, gossip, socialize, and conduct sideline business. This was also the place where they would go in order to hire new employees such as shop staff, guards, or adventurers.
In addition, Crimmor contained a variety of taverns where people would meet to drink cider and ale. Compared to clubs, taverns were noisy places offering few things to eat. They usually only served small snacks such as pickled, smoked oysters and fried cheese breads.
Visitors looking to spend the night in the city had two options to choose from renting a room in one of the three inns of the city, or in one of its numerous boarding houses.
Inns were the pricier option, but offered full meals, larger houses, and various services such as laundry and bathing. Boarding houses were cheaper, but usually offered no more than basic amenities a clean bed and chamber pots, a water basin, and door guards.
A night in the Pearl, the most expensive inn of the city, cost between 10 and 12 gp. In comparison, a night in a boarding house cost between 6 sp and 1 gp depending of the season.
Due to the constant cacophony of wagons roaming around Crimmor some visitors would prefer sleeping with the beasts in the paddocks outside the city, which were still quieter despite the lowing and neighing.
Crimmans gave gaudy outfits less importance as a status symbol as other Amnians. They gave more importance to fine coaches, walking sticks, homes, luggage and tools.
thumb|right|400px|Sign indicating a Remembrance Feast.
The main worship in Crimmor was dedicated to Chauntea, Lliira, Milil and Sune. The town also housed a shrine dedicated to many deities.
Deceased in Crimmor were celebrated by day long remembrance feasts held in their homes. Wealthy people were inhumated in the crypts of Silent Hill south-west of the city, reachable by following the Orc road. The bodies of regular citizens were washed and shaved, then taken east of the city on dedicated wagons to be cremated by priests&mdashas for their hairs, they were sold for use in wigs and as stuffing.
While ladies of coin werent proposing their services in the streets, the trade was still alive in the city. Hostesses of some clubs offered more than drinks, prostitutes looked for business in the Tymoran Trails inn, and a couple brothels masquerading as boarding houses offered room visits from "house girls" for an extra fee.
thumb|left|400px|Revelers during the Wheelmoot festival.
Wheelmoot was the only festival specific to the city of Crimmor. Held during winter, it was four consecutive days and nights of drinking and public debauchery.
Dedicated wagons were used to collect wastes, from broken items or household waste to the content of chamber pots. Those wagons moved slowly through town throughout the day, and the drovers signaled their arrival in front of each building using double-note fluted pipes. Once the wagons were full enough, their content was dumped in pits located three hills away south of town, along the Orc Road.
Citizen were charged for this waste removal service, paying 1 cp for each bucket dumped in the wagons. For the purpose of this service, any container that could be carried by one person unaided was considered as a bucket.
Most of the city was built from stone, from the buildings to the cobbled streets.
The streets of the city had narrow but deep channels in their center, which were used to guide rainwater towards the Alandor river. They were often insufficient though, causing the streets to be permanently dirty and smelly from a melange of water and dung.
Buildings were tall and narrow, touching each other as to not waste any space. The first level of every building was a low-ceilinged cellar held together by massive stone supports, and had a characteristic "big step up" on its front threshold to keep water and dung at bay.
The stone supports were necessary because the city was built upon hardened river ooze and uneven bedrock, causing the buildings to slowly sink down and lean in one direction or another. Those supports were regularly replaced or reinforced to keep the buildings straight and structurally stable.
thumb|right|400px|Sign indicating that goods are currently being loaded or unloaded.
While buildings were made from gray stone, they were stained brown until about  high. Most buildings were four to six stories tall, and none were higher than the upthrusting spires of The Pearl. Building roofs were tilted and made of brown, green or blue tiles, and windows were usually very high and narrow, as wide as four mens palms across. Most houses used "window-poles" ending in hooks to slide up and down the vertically overlapping sliding glass panels that composed their windows.
Many building sported several small balconies, high enough to not be a nuisance to loaded wagons. The facades were decorated with carved "ardragons", mythical mock-dragons with impossibly thin and long bodies that curled around windows and other wall features. Signs were hung on building walls to give various indications, from advertising sales in shops to giving indications to wagon drovers.
Citizens knew better than drinking from the river, as its waters would cause people to feel sick for a while&mdashespecially visitors which werent used to it.
Instead, the city was supplied with drinkable water through a midair pipe connecting to an abundant spring on the nearby Crytrapper Hill. The pipe ended on a wall-tower, where a series of pipes running along the city walls distributed it across the city. Almost every buildings were connected to this flow, and water was accessible through spigots, pumps and cisterns.
In addition some merchants sold "clearwater" from the Weeping Princess Pool, a nearby rainwater pool. This expensive product was sold in ornate flagons, and bought by snobbish folks.
The city was surrounded on the north by the Alandor River, and in all other directions by impressive gray granite walls. and guard towers equipped with ballistae were located on regular intervals along the periphery.
The Thaeldorn maintained several granaries around the city, which stored food supplies to be used in case of siege, famine, plague, or severe winters.
 Foundation of the city, subordinated to the Shoon Imperium.
 Crimmor became part of the country of Amn, under the reign of King Esmel Torlath. 
 During the Ogre Wars, Prince Imnel Torlath and his armies fought on the Small Teeth to restore trade between Crimmor and Murann. The town of Imnescar would later be founded where that battle took place.
 Crimmor was affected by the Coast Plague, killing approximately 20% of the townsfolk (i.e. thousands of people)
 Circa  Alorgoth the Bringer of Doom recruited some of the first members of the Order of the Dark Moon amongst the talented young adults of Crimmor.
thumb|left|130px|The ghost of Esmaelae
In addition to being a major trade route, Crimmor was famous for being haunted. A ghost roamed the city streets, looking for a treasure and a long-lost lover. The ghost was said to be that of Esmaelae, a long-dead noblewoman  of Tethyr, and was known to possess the living to further her searches. Some crimmans let Esmaelae possess them willingly, hoping to find her lost treasure along the way. Her victims were easy to recognize, as her ghostly face was slightly superimposed over theirs. Crimmans were extremely tolerant towards the antics of possessed victims, and sometimes followed them as a form of entertainment.
Thayans were not welcomed in Crimmor, which didnt deter them from secretly trading items and potions infused with dark magic in the city. Circa 1370 DR several Red Wizards of Thay were found dead in the streets, their bodies left for citizens to see, with the words Thayans Stay Out carved in them. Those murders were wildly credited to the Shadow Thieves guild, and sparked numerous rumors amongst the citizens.
According to rumors, Lady Zharnn Ophal planned to assassinate the Mayor and every last members of the Thaeldorn to replace them with loyal courtiers and bureaucrats. Details were fuzzy, with some pretending that the Shadow Thieves backed that attempt, while others insisted that they opposed her. According to the wildest rumors the Dragon Lady unleashed an amphibious, flying eel capable of traveling through water pipes to do the job.
According to Volothamp Geddarm, who severely disliked Crimmor, snake soup was a local delicacy. He pretended that some dining houses were going so far as leaving intact snake heads in the broth to scare diners.
 A proper earner Was said of a very nice tool or implement. Such tools would impress Crimmans very much.
 Caught in crimson Was said of a thief caught red-handed.

Crimmor was divided into three city wards, demarcated by two major roads. The High Ride ran east-weast through the city and marked the southern end of the River Ward. The Wagonrun ran north-south and separated the Wheel Ward from the Purse Ward.
River Ward
 The most important feature of the River Ward were the docks, where barges would stop to load and unload merchandises. This ward was also the home of Zoldaftel Wagons, the most renowned wagon-making shop in the region.
It was also the home of the Tymoran Trails, a popular inn known for its noisy and festive atmosphere.

Five guilds controlled the major trades in Crimmor the Smiths, the Dockhands, the Leatherers, the Wagonmakers and the Wheelwrights. To reduce the risks of corruption, they had no guildmasters but elected small, short-term ruling councils instead.
The Smiths Guild
thumb|130px|Symbol of the Smiths.
The Smiths specialized in producing parts for wagons, chains, fastening, small hardware (e.g. screws, bolts, hinges), locks, and wires.
The Dockhands Guild
thumb|left|130px|Symbol of the Dockhands.

The Leatherers Guild
thumb|130px|Symbol of the Leatherers.

The Wagonmakers Guild
thumb|left|130px|Symbol of the Wagonmakers.
The Wagonmakers of Crimmor were said to be amongst the best in their trade. Although guilds were ruled by councils, the de facto leader of the Wagonmakers was Zan Zoldaftel. and numerous members of the guild were his apprentices once.
The Wheelwrights Guild
thumb|130px|Symbol of the Wheelwrights.
The wheelwrights made and repaired wheels and carriages. As per order of the Mayor, drovers where also part of this guild. This was the result of convincing by the three grand families, who feared that fees should steeply increase should drovers be allowed to form their own guild. The guild also looked over carpenters and woodcutters working in the nearby Cloud Peaks.
The Shadow Thieves Guild
thumb|left|130px|Symbol of the Shadow Thieves.
Usually highly secretive, the most powerful Amnian thieves guild was openly present in Crimmor, which it had declared a theft-free zone. The guild maintained this policy strictly, taking measures against visiting thieves and amateurs, and exposing thieves trying to sell ill-gotten gains inside the city walls. The protection offered by the Shadow Thieves extended outside city walls as well, including the warehouses to the east and the estates of the wealthy to the west.
It was said that the origin of this peculiar arrangement came from a debt high-ranking Shadow Thieves members owed to the Crytrapper family, who provided them alibis and protection when they were caught red-handed.  The guild was so close to the Crytrappers that some of the familys secret warehouses were used to store contraband or guild members.
The guild also ensured that no one would counterfeit the badges used on draft animals, by letting it known that every false badge would be worth one finger&mdashsevered from the user.
Three major noble families held influence over Crimmor. They were collectively referred to as the grand families by the townsfolk.
Crytrapper family

Krimmevol family
The Krimmevol family was the majority landholder in Crimmor, and owned almost half of the businesses related to caravans.  Mikaal Krimmevol, the family head, was the Mayors best friend and as such provided an important political power to his family. Mikaal was also secretly the Herald Sable, keeping an eye on trades and smuggling.
Ophal family
The Ophal family controlled most of the spice trade in town. Lady Zharnn Ophal was a political opponent to the mayor, which she tried to have replaced for years. The Ophal family was as feared as it was respected, with the Mayor being one of the only citizens that dared speak against Lady Ophal in public.
