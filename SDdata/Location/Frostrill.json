        "mainbody": "Frostrill was a small thorp located in the Druarwood, north of the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, in the Silver Marches.\nThe thorps inhabitants were exclusively arctic dwarves and were led by Unimak Giantskull around 1372 DR. The dwarves strenuously defended their hunting territory from numerous enemies. Arctic dwarves tamed a small number of dire wolverines, which were used for hunting. They kept themselves as much as possible away from the giants in the area and they had no scruples about attacking orcs with incredible violence. \n* Aniva Icefoot\n* Kolmak the Broken\n* Nunima Orc-eater\nCategoryThorps\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryArctic dwarven locations\nCategoryDwarven locations\nCategoryLocations in the Druarwood\nCategoryLocations in Luruar\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n5wehaaf5dzx2z2towq6lmhq0von99jf"
