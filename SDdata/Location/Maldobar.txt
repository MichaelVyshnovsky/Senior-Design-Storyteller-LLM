'''Maldobar''' was a small village north of [[Sundabar]]. 

==Geography==
Maldobar was located {{SI|50|mile|k|long=yes}} north up the [[Dead Orc River]] from [[Sundabar]]. A hundred miles to the north of Maldobar was the [[Coldwood]].

==Description==
Maldobar was a small village. On the western outskirts of the village, against the mountain slopes, were the home and barn of the [[Thistledown (family)|Thistledown]] family.

==Inhabitants==
The village inhabitants were [[human]] farmers. 

The only threats to the village were the [[goblin]]s and [[gnoll]]s in the area who occasionally came to raid. 

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, the Thistledown family were found gruesomely murdered in their house and barn. The culprit was believed to be the [[drow]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], owing to the presence of his [[scimitar]] at the scene. However, the true culprit was [[Ulgulu]] the [[barghest]]. Drizzt avenged the Thistledowns by slaying Ulgulu, but despite the belief of [[Dove Falconhand]] and her band that Drizzt was innocent, [[Roddy McGristle]] continued to pursue Drizzt and defame his name for years and across many borders.
