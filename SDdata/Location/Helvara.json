        "mainbody": "Helvara was a city found in the Lost Kingdom of Anauria.\nIt was situated on the southern bank of Lake Miir near the Desertsmouth Mountains.\nHelvara served as the kingdoms primary producer of agricultural goods and personal supplies. \nThe city was founded some time after the fall of Netheril in , as the enclave of Anauria expanded into a great kingdom of multiple cities.\nIn the , a horde of orcs and goblinoid forces led by the shaman Andegril the Wise caused the collapse of Anauria and all of the cities within.According to pages 116 of Netheril Empire of Magic The Winds of Netheril, this event occurred in 450 DR. This is direct conflict with a statement on page 12 of the same book that says the kingdom fell in 3970 Netheril Year, or 111 DR."
