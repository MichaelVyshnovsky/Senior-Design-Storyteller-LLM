        "History": "The city was founded some time after the fall of [[Netheril]] in {{Yearlink|-339}}, as the enclave of Anauria expanded into a great kingdom of multiple cities.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|111}}, a horde of [[orc]]s and [[goblinoid]] forces led by the shaman [[Andegril|Andegril the Wise]] caused the collapse of Anauria and all of the cities within.According to pages 116 of ''[[Netheril: Empire of Magic|Netheril Empire of Magic: The Winds of Netheril]]'', this event occurred in [[450 DR]]. This is direct conflict with a statement on page 12 of the same book that says the kingdom fell in [[111 DR|3970 Netheril Year]], or 111 DR."
