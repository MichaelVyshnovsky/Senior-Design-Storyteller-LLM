Fell Pass was a large rocky east-to-west vale in the Spine of the World where ghosts from an old battle roamed. 
The Dreadmont and Skyfire mountains lay to the north and south. The east of the pass was within sight of the River Surbrin. It was shrouded in fog in parts, and there was little grass. There were tunnels and caverns at various places in the pass, some of which were natural and others that were carved out by the dwarves.
The gnome illusionist Fitzmilliyun Sparkledrim built his Castle of Illusion in the Pass during the height of Ascalhorns power. A century after his death, orcs overran its defenders.
It was thought that the ghosts were those of the orcs and Delzoun dwarves slain in the Battle of Fell Pass. However, it was discovered by a scouting party led by Bruenor Battlehammer (much to his displeasure) that what actually lay beneath the pass was the ruins of Baffenburg.
