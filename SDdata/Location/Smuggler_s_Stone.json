        "History": "Smuggler's Stone was named for a large rock that sheltered the small harbor of the village. By the 1360s [[DR]], this harbor had been used by smugglers and [[pirate]]s for centuries.<ref name=VGC-p80>",
        "Geography": "The village was located midway between the [[Wyvernflow]] to the west and [[Mistwater River]] to the east.<ref name=VGC-pp80,92/> It lay on the [[Bluemist Trail]] that ran along the coast from [[Marsember]] in the west to [[Dawngleam]] in the east.<ref name=BC-p45/>",
        "Architecture": "The fishermen's huts were clustered around the steep sides of the stormy cove and were supported on stilts that made the dwellings creak during strong winds.<ref name=VGC-p80/>",
        "Government": "By [[1367 DR]], it was against [[Laws of Cormyr|Crown law]] to set up lights on the Stone because they were once used to help pirates and smugglers guide themselves into the harbor. [[War Wizards]] observed the area with the ''[[farscry]]'' [[spell]] and alerted the [[Purple Dragons]] if illegal activity was detected.<ref name=VGC-p80/>",
        "Rumors and Legends": "There were many tales of unclaimed treasure stashed by pirates around the area. Beneath the hills north of the village there was said to be an abandoned mine belonging to the [[gnome]]s.<ref name=VGC-p80/>"
