Shanatar or Deep Shanatar was one of the underground realms of the shield dwarves. It first came into being around  when Taark Shanat and his dwarves migrated west from Bhaerynden and defeated the inhabitants of the Rift of Dhalnadar in the Cloaker Wars to found Alatorin.
After the Spawn Wars, the subterranean part of Shanatar consisting of the eight sub-kingdoms became known as "Deep Shanatar" whilst the part above ground became known as "High Shanatar".
Shanatar was located beneath the lands of Amn, Tethyr, Calimshan and the Lake of Steam, collectively known as the Lands of Intrigue.>
The eight sons of Taark each formed their own kingdom in Shanatar, adopting one of the children of Moradin as a deity. Of the original eight kingdoms that composed it, the sole surviving one is the reclusive Iltkazar.
Whereas in Alatorin the dwarves of Shanatar primarily venerated Moradin and Berronar, the eight subkingdoms each venerated their own deity
* Barakuir the Iron Kingdom. (Laduguer)
** Holorarar the Gold Kingdom. â€” merged after its fall with Barakuir
* Drakkalor the City of Greed. (Abbathor)
* Iltkazar the Mithral Kingdom. (Clangeddin Silverbeard)
* Korolnor the Jewel Kingdom. (Diinkarazan)
* Sondarr The Seastar Kingdom. (Vergadain)
* Torglor the Silver Kingdom. (Diirinka)
* Ultoksamrin the Zardazil Kingdom. (Dumathoin)
* Xothaerin the Adamant Kingdom. (Sharindlar)

The alliance of the eight kingdoms of Shanatar and the successful repulsion of the Guallidurth drow marked the beginning of this age, although this alliance did not stop certain tensions between the kingdoms. The dwarves asked the gods to decide which of them should sit on the Wyrmskull Throne of Brightaxe Hall in Taark Shanats place and Dumathoin chose the king of Ultoksamrin. Dumathoin then became the patron of the shield dwarf race. This age ended with another invasion of the Guallidurth drow and the Third Spider War that lasted around thirty years.
