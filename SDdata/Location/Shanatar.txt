'''Shanatar''' or '''Deep Shanatar''' was one of the underground realms of the [[shield dwarves]]. It first came into being around {{Yearlink|-10800}} when [[Taark Shanat]] and his dwarves migrated west from [[Bhaerynden]] and defeated the inhabitants of the [[Rift of Dhalnadar]] in the [[Cloaker Wars]] to found [[Alatorin]].

After the [[Spawn Wars]], the subterranean part of Shanatar consisting of the eight sub-kingdoms became known as "Deep Shanatar" whilst the part above ground became known as "High Shanatar".

==Geography==
Shanatar was located beneath the lands of [[Amn]], [[Tethyr]], [[Calimshan]] and the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]], collectively known as the [[Lands of Intrigue]].>

==Sub-kingdoms==
The eight sons of Taark each formed their own kingdom in Shanatar, adopting one of the children of [[Moradin]] as a [[deity]]. Of the original eight kingdoms that composed it, the sole surviving one is the reclusive [[Iltkazar]].

Whereas in [[Alatorin]] the dwarves of Shanatar primarily venerated Moradin and [[Berronar]],{{fact}} the eight subkingdoms each venerated their own deity:
* '''[[Barakuir]]''': the Iron Kingdom. ([[Laduguer]])
** '''[[Holorarar]]''': the Gold Kingdom. â€” merged after its fall with Barakuir
* '''[[Drakkalor]]''': the City of Greed. ([[Abbathor]])
* '''[[Iltkazar]]''': the Mithral Kingdom. ([[Clangeddin Silverbeard]])
* '''[[Korolnor]]''': the Jewel Kingdom. ([[Diinkarazan]])
* '''[[Sondarr]]''': The Seastar Kingdom. ([[Vergadain]])
* '''[[Torglor]]''': the Silver Kingdom. ([[Diirinka]])
* '''[[Ultoksamrin]]''': the Zardazil Kingdom. ([[Dumathoin]])
* '''[[Xothaerin]]''': the Adamant Kingdom. ([[Sharindlar]])

==Ages==
<!-- Please do not alter the above heading. Other pages link to it. -->

The ages of Shanatar are periods in the history of the dwarven realm.

===First Great Age of Shanatar===
<!-- Please do not alter the above heading. Other pages link to it. -->

''Around {{Yearlink|-10800}} to {{Yearlink|-8137}}''

This age began when Taark Shanat and his dwarves founded Shanatar by winning the Cloaker Wars, and contained both the [[First Spider War|first]] and [[Second Spider War|second]] Spider Wars, ending at the conclusion of the Second Spider War when the [[drow]] of [[Guallidurth]] withdrew from Alatorin.{{fact}}

===Second Great Age of Shanatar===
<!-- Please do not alter the above heading. Other pages link to it. -->

''{{Yearlink|-8137}} to around {{Yearlink|-6150}}''

The alliance of the eight kingdoms of Shanatar and the successful repulsion of the Guallidurth drow marked the beginning of this age, although this alliance did not stop certain tensions between the kingdoms. The dwarves asked the gods to decide which of them should sit on the [[Wyrmskull Throne]] of [[Brightaxe Hall]] in Taark Shanat's place and [[Dumathoin]] chose the king of [[Ultoksamrin]]. Dumathoin then became the patron of the shield dwarf race. This age ended with another invasion of the Guallidurth drow and the [[Third Spider War]] that lasted around thirty years.{{fact}}

===Third Great Age of Shanatar===
<!-- Please do not alter the above heading. Other pages link to it. -->

''Around {{Yearlink|-6120}} to around {{Yearlink|-1800}}''

When this age was ushered in, the emperor sent dwarves to the surface to found new subkingdoms. This saw the creation of [[High Shanatar]] and later, its destruction at the hands of the [[humans]] of Calimshan around {{Yearlink|-2600}}. This age also saw the rise and fall of [[Oghrann]] and [[Haunghdannar]] and the rise of [[Delzoun]] and [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]]. It ended when all of Deep Shanatar with the exception of [[Iltkazar]] was destroyed by the invading [[duergar]] who had once been its inhabitants.{{fact}}
