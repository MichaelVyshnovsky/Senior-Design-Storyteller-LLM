'''Blackhold''' was a trademoot located in a cavern of the nation of [[Fimbrul]], on [[Laerakond]]. It was inhabited only by [[humanoid]]s.

==Background==
The population of Blackhold was not fixed, waning and waxing with the passage of travelers and adventurers exploring the [[Howling Mountains]]. Blackhold was rarely attacked by [[dragon]]s, [[giant]]s or other monsters, and thus was considered neutral territory.

==Economy==
Adventurers and travelers used Blackhold to get supplies, to rest during their travels, or to recruit new companions. The few permanent residents traded with them and with the dwarves of the nearby settlement of [[Forgefires]].

==Architecture==
Blackhold was made originally by [[dwarves]], inside of a cavern near the surface of the Howling Mountains. Its dwellings were chains of narrow-linked side chambers cut into the walls of the cavern. The main area was dominated by beast pens, rocks that served as a podium, and by a pool referred to as the Drinkwater Pool.

==Notable inhabitants==
* [[Iskh Lammarask]], a mother-like figure in Blackhold and owner of the only "inn", [[Iskh's Rest]].
* [[Bleys Orltusk]], owner of the [[Crossed Blades]] shop.
* [[The Cloaked]], the only known resident [[wizard]] of Blackhold.
