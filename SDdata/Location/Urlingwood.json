        "mainbody": "The '''Urlingwood''' was a wild, untamed forest in north [[Rashemen]] that was considered to be of great importance to the [[Wychlaran]], the order of witches that held great influence in the nation of the [[Unapproachable East|east]].\n\n{{Quote|Stay out of it. That is the exclusive domain of the witches, and outsiders aren't welcome. Most of them live in [[Urling]] city, but they go there to perform their ceremonies and rituals. The witches are not bad women, mind you...they help keep our land free. But they value their privacy and anonymity, and are quick to punish anyone who violates it.|''The guide [[Ygsvar]], to [[Sigurd]].''}}",
        "Description": "The Urlingwood was the meeting place of the [[Witches of Rashemen]]. Anyone not of their order, or members of the [[Vremyonni]], Patrols of Rashemaar warriors marched around the border to warn off those who were lost or ignorant to local customs.\n\nIt was the site where the [[hathran]]s came to hold meetings, craft their [[witchboat]]s, brew ''[[Jhuild]]'', and ordain the young [[ethran]]s within their order. The only non-Wychlaran allowed within the forest were young Rashemaar that were readied to join the order of the Vremyonni. \n\nWhile the witches of Rashemen always wear their masks in public places, they frequently went maskless while within the Urlingwood.",
        "Geography": "The forest was located northwest of the [[Sunrise Mountains]], just beyond the [[Running Rocks]] and south of the [[Endless Wastes]]. \n\nAside from the town of [[Urling]], the two nearest Rashemaar cities were [[Mulptan]] and [[Shevel]].",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the easternmost cell of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] operated within the Urlingwood. It composed those members of the organization that committed crimes not serious enough to warrant execution. The cell was tasked with ridding the wood of its resident witches.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Urling]], the nearby town that served as the home to many witches of the Wychlaran.",
        "Inhabitants": "The forest was also home to many [[fey]] creatures and [[spirit]]s such as [[telthor]]s, and in the colder months [[orglash]]es."
