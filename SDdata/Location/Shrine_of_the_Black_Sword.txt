The Shrine of the Black Sword was a small crystal pyramid located south of ThaolaÂ’s Wineshop in Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet.
As a symbol of remembrance of all slain elves, the pyramid was set in its own grounds and black marble columns lead up to it.
The grounds were maintained by a single elf who lived in a nearby cottage. 
On Fallrite each year, Queen Amlaruil Moonflower used to visit the shrine with a group of nobles to remember the dead.
