        "mainbody": "he Naktong Moors were a tract of moorland in the land of Koryo in Kara-Tur. They lay west of the settlement of Konang Pen.Like many sites in Koryo, the Naktong Moors share a name with a real-world counterpart Nakdong River, also written as \"Naktong\", in Korea.\nLocal folk from Konang Pen dug peat out of the moor to use as fuel.\nIt was said that magical beasts dwelled upon the moors, including unicorns and the notorious sdomo rhan, a giant beetle that could disguise itself as a beautiful woman. There were undead, too, such as zombies and peat mummies that had been preserved in the bogs.\nHuat Rhu, the famed general of Koguryo, once led his soldiers on an expedition into the Naktong Moors. They never returned. By the 14th century DR, it was rumored they still wandered the moors, now as peat mummies and zombies hunting for fresh blood."
