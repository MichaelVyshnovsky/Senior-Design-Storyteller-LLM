        "mainbody": "Blood Island was a small island that sat in the River Mirar in the city of Luskan. It was fortified to house the standing army responsible for defending the city. This fortress briefly came to be known as the Dragons Lair during the late 15 century DR.\nThe island was dominated by a guard tower, two barracks, and an armory. There was little else of interest on the island.\nThe interior of the fortress was decorated with tapestries depicting coastlines and ships as well as furniture of black oak. The windows in the officers quarters commanded an excellent view of the coast.\nBlood Island sat further upstream than the other islands in the River Mirars mouth (namely Closeguard Island, Cutlass Island, Fang Island, and Harbor Arm Island). It lay in the middle of Luskans Harbor Cross bridge it was connected to Luskans South Bank by the Short Span of the bridge and to the North Bank via the Long Span.\nThe barracks contained layers of fortifications, with three separate sets of staggered walls designed to trap attackers and many murder holes designed to then kill them.\nCatapults mounted on the roof of the islands guard tower were capable of bombarding enemy ships in either of Luskans harbors as well as those coming from upriver. They could also fire into the city itself.\nBlood Island was occupied by Luskans standing army through the 14 century DR.\nIn the , forces led by Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood. They seized Blood Island for their assault across the Harbor Cross, and the city guard remained hunkered within their garrison as they fretted over which side to join.\nWith the descent of Luskan into anarchy following the events of the Spellplague in the , Blood Island was abandoned the barracks fell into ruin and its windows were boarded up, and the island became cut off from the city as the Harbor Cross fell into disrepair (although the bridge was rebuilt and known as the \"Blood Bridge\" in the ).\nBy the late 15 century DR, the island had become the headquarters of a Shou crime syndicate known as the Dragonbloods, and the refurbished garrison came to be called the \"Dragons Lair\". The gangs leadership was killed by Kalen Dren, Myrin Darkdance, Rhett Hawkwinter, and Sithe during the outbreak of the Fury plague in the .\nBy , the guard tower and barracks once again housed Luskans soldiers. Access to the island was restricted to members of Luskans Ships or to those otherwise approved by the High Captains of Luskan.\n* Kasi, a high-ranking member of the Dragonbloods as of 1480 DR.\n* Umbra, known to the public as \"the Dragon\", the enigmatic leader of the Dragonbloods in the late 15 century DR."
