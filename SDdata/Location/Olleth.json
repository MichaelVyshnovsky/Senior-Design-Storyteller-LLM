        "mainbody": "Throughout the Age of Humanity, the Arcanum of Olleth was the major morkoth country in Serôs. Early into the Era of Upheaval and after the Spellplague, Olleth became ruled by kuo-toa. \nOlleth was founded in 911 DR.\nSometime late in the 14th century of Dale Reckoning the morkoth ambushed a kuo-toa delegation under a truce vouchsafed by Blibdoolpoolp. Half of the kuo-toa were eaten and the rest were kept as slaves.  However, several of the surviving kuo-toa were whips of Blibdoolpoolp and started a massive campaign of setbacks, uprisings and disasters.\nIn 1385 DR the Spellplague struck Olleth and a third of the morkoth mages dissolved in blue flashes. The remaining morkoth lost their grip on the spells they used to enslave others. The kuo-toa moved quickly to seize control of Olleth. Most of the morkoth were killed, though a few escaped and the kuo-toa kept most of the slaves. Afterwards kuo-toa migrated into Serôs for the first time.\nIn 1393 DR several kuo-toa left Olleth and founded the colony of Taunissik\nBy 1479 DR, the city of Olleth was under the total dominion of the Abolethic Sovereignty.\n*Grand Tor Arcanaal (capital city)\n*Tor Abjural (city)\n*Tor Arcal (city)\n*Tor Augural (city)\n*Tor Charmal (city)\n*Tor Evocal (city)\n*Tor Necral (city)\n*Tor Phantal (city)\n*Tor Thaumatal (city)\n*Tor Transmal (city)\n* Arcane Envoy Arxhadk emissary to the drow of Sshamath\n* Arcount Axar Xyrl a scheming morkoth\n* Grand Caster Duupox a morkoth servant of Axar\n* Major Qyzal Axars sworn morkoth military guard\n* Great Arcane Szyzthus\nCategoryCountries\nCategoryLocations in Serôs\nCategoryMagocracies\nCategoryTheocracies\nCategoryKuo-toa locations\nCategoryMorkoth locations\nCategoryLocations in the Sea of Fallen Stars\nCategoryLocations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\n6ybdwsd9nm5ernnfqnq131l1039w6vf"
