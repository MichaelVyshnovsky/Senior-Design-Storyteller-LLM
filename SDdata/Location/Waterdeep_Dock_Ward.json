        "mainbody": "he Dock Ward of Waterdeep was situated on the Great Harbor of Waterdeep. It contained the docks, shipbuilding yards, and warehouses for the sea trade. Compared to the rest of the city it was exceptionally dirty, smelly, and particularly dangerous. In the words of Elminster himself, the Dock Ward was a \"riotous, nigh-perpetual brawl that covers entire acres, interrupted only by small buildings, intermittent trade businesses, an errant dog or two, and a few brave watchguards, who manage to keep the chaos from spreading beyond the docks the whole lot wallowing in the stench of rotting fish.\"\nCirca 1368 DR, an enterprising halfling Joshuan Havabuck was involved in numerous schemes and business in the Dock Ward. His main profitable business was the lottery where the folk of Wateerdeep placed bets on the total daily tonnage that entered the harbor. The numbers were reported by the dockmaster and the winnings were distributed accordingly. One ticket was sold for a single gold lion and the take, on average, was ten thousand coins. Amazingly, in 1368 DR, not ten people, picked the correct number, not even thirty. Every single gambler guessed it correctly. This was due the goddess of luck - Tymoras power running amok in Faer√ªn. Joshuan Havabuck resorted to loaning ten million gold lions with steep interest from Mirt the Moneylender and pay the winnings out.\nAfter the Spellplague, the northern section of Waterdeep harbor became dilapidated with most of the harbor choked with sunken ship hulls. This section became known as Mistshore.\n* The Blackstar Inn High-priced (for the Dock Ward) Inn run by Asiyra Boldwinter.\n* The Bloody Fist Tavern with near-constant brawls, run by Uglukh Vorl.\n* The Blue Mermaid Clean tavern run by Mother Jalyth Hlommorath.\n* The Blushing Mermaid On Net Street a luxurious inn, taven & festhall run by Lady Alathene Moonstar.\n* Cookhouse Hall Favorite festhall of sailors.\n* The Copper Cup Off the Southyard inn, tavern, & festhall owned by its dancers.\n* The Friendly Flounder Small tavern run by Eaengul Skullcrown.\n*The Grog House a tavern frequented by locals, sailors and adventurers.\n*Heartflame A festhall on Snail Street owned by Nauloene Tharantra before it burned down on the Night of Pirates in late Uktar, 1367 DR, the Year of the Shield.\n*The Hanged Man Tavern for those of a literary bent, owned by Auldenuth Orbrymm.\n* The Hanging Lantern A festhall and escort service.\n* The Laughing Lass A brothel on Ship Street, run by Alanthra Ghellowsar.\n* The Mermaids Arms A rowdy tavern and festhall run by Calathia Frost and favored by the crew of the Sea Sprite located on Dock Street.\n* The Purple Palace A festhall and boudoir.\n* The Rearing Hippocampus An inn favored by caravan masters and run by Barl Shardrin.\n* The Ships Prow An inn at the intersection of Fish Street and Ship Street, run by Jhambrote Harkharedest.\n* Shipmasters Hall Private inn and dining club for ship captain, owners, first mates and their guests.\n*The Skewered Dragon A dilapidated tavern that faced an alley between Net Street and Fillet Lane with a ships anchor lodged in the roof.\n* The Sleeping Snake Rowdy tavern for dockhands and dancers, owner by Alard Belaerl\n* The Sleeping Wench Somewhat quiet tavern, owned by Peldan Thrael\n* The Splintered Stair Three-story inn run by Shalanna Duthmere .\n* The Thirsty Sailor A dive bar at the intersection of Fish and Ship Street, run by Kaeroven Yuluth.\n* The Thirsty Throat Run down tavern, run by Bulaedo Ledgileer.\n* Three Pearls Nightclub On Pearl Alley Run by Halidara Urinshoon Entertainment, food & drink.\n*Warm Beds A quiet inn run by Shalath Lythryn.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Shop Catalogue Counter Goods retail chain.\n* Felhaurs Fine Fish A fishmongery on Spices Street.\n* Gelfuril the Trader sells or trades just about anything\n* Helmstar Warehouse On Dock Street run by Chuldan Helmstar, a known fence.\n* The House of Pride perfume shop run by Arleeth and Ilitel Harmeth\n* Nestaurs Ropes\n* Old Xoblob Shop trinkets and curios.\n*Red Sails Warehouse economic storage in the form of \"coffin-sized lockboxes\" located near Cod Lane.\n* Serpent Books & Folios On Book Street Run by Jannaxil Serpentil Maps, charts, and books.\n*Shipwright large building located on Dock Street used for shipbuilding.
