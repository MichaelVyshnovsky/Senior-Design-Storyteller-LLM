Takabbar was a small town on the island of Jazirat al-Gawwar within the Nada al-Hazan archipelago.
It was rumored that the only way to get off of the island of Jazirat al-Gawwar was through the Tower of the Test, located in Takabbar.
The Takabbari were kind people. There were no enemies on their island so they never carried weapons. They were isolated from the outside world and had no idea of events taking place beyond their small island.
