Some speculated if a [[wizard]] experimenting with [[illusion]]s may have been the cause. Others speculated it was a wizard seeking to harm local businesses, drive down local property values, or simply spread fear&mdash;though all who put forward these theories admitted to having nothing to backup their claims.\n\nSome interpreted the apparitions as being a message &mdash; [[Sambral|Sambral the Soothsayer]] would claim the dead were warning Waterdhavians of impending battles from underground invaders, [[Sheireera|Sheireera of the Prophecies]] would claim that it was the dead crying out against immorality and lawlessness in Waterdeep, and [[priest]] [[Thalomaun]] of the [[Church of Lathander]] would make a proclamation on [[Virgin's Square]] that it was a sign from the dead for the living of the affected neighborhoods to do away with old businesses and make way for new ones.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Ghost Sightings}}",
