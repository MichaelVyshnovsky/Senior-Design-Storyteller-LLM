The Scar was the massive, eponymous gorge that spanned the width of Scardale within the southern Dalelands. The deep cliffs of the canyon enveloped the River Ashaba on the tail end of its course from the Feather Falls waterfall in the west until it emptied into the Sea of Fallen Stars in the east.
The chasm of Scardale was so large that it contained a wealth of farmland, a number of small villages as well as all the larger cities of Scardale including
*Chandlerscross Scardales capital, post 1370 DR.
*Scardale Town The remnants of the dales former capital, that served as a port city in the Sea of Fallen Stars.
*Scarsdeep A smaller town, nearby to Chandlerscross, that grew in size and population during the dales occupation.
