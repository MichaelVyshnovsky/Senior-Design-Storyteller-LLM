        "mainbody": "'''Chauntea's Citadel''' was a fortress on [[Harvestshield Mountain]] that stood in ruins as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], at which time it came to be occupied by [[Mrolgyet's Legion]]. The citadel was named for [[Chauntea]], the [[goddess]] of agriculture.",
        "Geography": "The Citadel was most safely accessible via a path on the south side of the mountain. It sat atop a tunnel connecting it to the [[Heartcoil Deeps]], a region of the [[Underdark]] beneath Harvestshield Mountain. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, it also contained a tunnel dug by the [[Snarlclaw]] [[troll]]s that connected the Citadel to the [[Frostsilver Mines]].",
        "Defenses": "The [[wizard]]s of the ancient Citadel created a number of [[golem]]s to defend the area, notably a single wizard created a force of [[flesh golem]]s known as \"[[Harvestshield Reapers]]\" to protect the farmlands from raiders, while other wizards created [[stone golem]]s known as \"[[Heartcoil Guardians]]\" to patrol the tunnels connecting the Citadel to the Underdark. These various golems were designed to only acknowledge their creators' commands, and those of them still active as of the late 15{{th}} century DR treated everyone as an enemy.\n\nWith the arrival of Mrolgyet's Legion in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the fortifications were greatly repaired and expanded in order to defend it from both attacking armies and raging [[dragon]]s.",
        "History": "Prior to the arrival of the [[red dragon]] [[Argathakul]] between the late 8{{th}} and early 15{{th}} century DR,<ref group=\"note\">''[[Warriors of Waterdeep]]'' is set in the late 15{{th}} century DR during [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s tenure as [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], and Laeral states that \"Few are still alive who remember how cruelly Argathakul despoiled Harvestshield Mountain, but I do.\" Laeral was born in {{Yearlink|765}}, giving the stated range from the late 8{{th}} to early 15{{th}} century DR. Laeral subsequently describes Argathakul as \"young for a dragon\", which might suggest a more recent date within this range. Chauntea's Citadel was dedicated to defending the fertile farmlands that sat at the base of Harvestshield Mountain. To that end, the wizards of the Citadel created [[construct]]s to defend both the farmers and the Citadel itself. During this time, the Citadel weathered an uprising by a legendary rebel known as [[Bellorath]], who fled to the Heartcoil Deeps after his defeat.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Citadel was claimed by the hobgoblin warlord [[Mrolgyet]] and his Legion, who set about fortifying it, subjugating or recruiting allies, and planning for an invasion against the [[Lords' Alliance]]. The Legion was defeated and scattered by the combined efforts of a Lords' Alliance army and a band of [[adventurer]]s in the service of the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Laeral Silverhand]].",
        "Inhabitants": "With the arrival of Mrolgyet's Legion in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Citadel was used to garrison a large force of [[goblinoid]]s and [[giant]]kin, as well as the occasional [[chimera]]."
