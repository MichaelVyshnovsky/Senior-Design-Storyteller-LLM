The shrine was primarily intact, but the wooden bell tower was in disrepair. The temple was located in the far left corner of the courtyard past the old wooden gates. In the center of the courtyard was the keep's old mess hall, which was an open airy building with tables. The charred stable and blacksmith shop were on the right with a rotting shed and barracks on the immediate left."

[[Shal Desanea|Shal Bal]] of [[Cormyr]], [[Tarl Desanea]], and [[Ren o' the Blade]] determined the primary presence at the keep was in fact the [[undead]] souls of many clerics of Tyr, tormented to remain at the keep to protect their temple and a valuable artifact, the [[Holy Scale]]. The heroes encountered [[giant frog]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[orc]]s during their search of the keep, but Tarl was drawn to the undead clerics and [[warrior]]s of Tyr. They needed help to ease their sorrows, and assist them in finding eternal rest.",
            "Monument of the Ancients": "Around [[1480 DR]], the keep was the headquarters of the merchant family [[House Sokol]]."
