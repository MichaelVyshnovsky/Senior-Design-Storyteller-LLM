Gnarhelm was a Northlander kingdom located in the Moonshae Isles.
Gnarhelm was located on the large island of Alaron, north of the Fairheight Mountains. Gnarhlem was a realm filled with tough terrain. Much of the land was rocky, with steep hills and exposed cliffs. Gnarhelm had more roads and overland travel routes than any other Northlander kingdom. 
The human inhabitants of Gnarhelm were Northlanders. They were not as skilled as sailors as other Northlanders, due to the difficulty in sea travel around the kingdom. As a result, they were much more comfortable traveling, and fighting, on land.
The climate of Gnarhelm was quite harsh. The realm was often covered in clouds and rain was common. Vicious storms from the Trackless Sea were common. 
Gnarhlem was one of the main trading ports of the Northlanders. Merchants from Waterdeep often docked here, trading gold, oil and liquor for slaves and Ffolk-crafted weapons. Northlander longships sailed from Gnarhelm to both Ruathym and Waterdeep. Gnarhelm traded with the Ffolk to the south, trading raw materials for alcohol and food.
Gnarhlem was a mineral-rich kingdom, and the only Northlander kingdom that had extensive mines. Rich veins of copper, gold, iron and silver existed within the realm. Due to the terrain and climate, Gnarhelm had little agricultural output, instead they relied on their mineral wealth to trade for food.
Gnarhelm had a smaller navy than other Northlander kingdoms, with only a few dozen longships. The kingdom had more horses than other Northlander realms and used cavalry as part of their large army. The military of Gnarhelm was capable of dealing with most threats to the realm.
