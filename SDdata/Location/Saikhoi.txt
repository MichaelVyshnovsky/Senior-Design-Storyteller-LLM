'''Saikhoi''' was the capital city of [[Ra-Khati]]. Formerly known as '''Thakos''', in ancient times it was the capital of the eastern [[Imaskar Empire]] and of the successor empire [[Anok-Imaskar]].

==History==
===Ancient History===
After the land of [[Khati]] was annexed by the [[Imaskari]] during the height of the [[Imaskar Empire]] ({{Yearlink|-7975}} to {{Yearlink|-6788}}), the city of Thakos rose as the capital of the eastern empire through the Middle Kingdoms period ({{Yearlink|-6422}} to {{Yearlink|-4370}}).

The Imaskar Empire fell in {{Yearlink|-2488}}, but the eastern provinces Khati and [[Katakoro]] emerged relatively unscathed. Thus, in {{Yearlink|-2487}}, [[Kujawa]] claimed the Dragon Throne in Thakos and declared himself Emperor, founding a new realm, [[Anok-Imaskar]], with Khati at its heart. Kujawa died fighting a great [[t'ien lung]] [[dragon]] in {{Yearlink|-1943}}. His death led to the empire fracturing into warring states, among them the new independent realm called Ra-Khati.

In the centuries to come, however, Thakos would fall into ruins. In {{Yearlink|-1377}}, [[Tan Chin]] dug through the ruins of Thakos and discovered potent Imaskari artifacts, with which he seized the throne of ancient [[Shou Lung]].

In time, the city would be rebuilt and become known as Saikhoi.

==Geography==
Nestled deep within the [[Katakoro Shan]] range, Saikhoi sat between the two sacred lakes of [[Norasil]] and [[Manasowar]].

==Inhabitants==
Saikhoi was the home of the ruler of Ra-Khati, the [[Tsenya Garbo|Dalai Lama]].

==Rumors and Legends==
Any outsider who saw the sacred city of Saikhoi was never permitted to leave.
