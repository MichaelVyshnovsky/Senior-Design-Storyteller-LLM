'''Makkitt Pass''' was a mountain pass located in the [[Keryjek Ridge]] of the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
Makkitt Pass was the only natural pass in the Keryjek Ridge, connecting [[Alpuk]] and [[Angalpuk]]. It was {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} in width and {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} long. It wound through the mountain chain and had smooth slopes of snow, which made travel easy. Travelers navigated the pass on foot or on sleds pulled by [[caribou]] or sled dogs. Makkitt Pass held some dangers. Avalanches were frequent and [[winter wolves]] hunted along the length of the pass.
