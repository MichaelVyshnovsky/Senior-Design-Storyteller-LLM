        "mainbody": "azayir al-Sartan, the Isles of the Crab, formed a crab-shaped archipelago in the eastern part of the Crowded Sea of Zakhara, south of Ajayib. Poorly explored and marginally settled by enlightened Zakharans, it was the home to a large number of monsters as well as savage tribes of halflings, humans, ogres and ogre magi. Even the waters were avoided due the strange crab-like monsters.\nFour major groups of islands were usually recognized within the archipelago the larger Jazirat al-Sadaf (the \"Island of the Shell\") and Jazirat al-Qraidis (\"Shrimp Island\"), the long chain called Jazayir al-Alfar (the \"Islands of the Claws\") extending north and south of Jaziat al-Sadaf, and the smaller Uyun al-Sartan (\"Eyes of the Crab\") in the center around the so-called Batihat al-Saji, the \"Lagoon of the Brave\"."
