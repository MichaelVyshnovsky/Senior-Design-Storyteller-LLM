Poorly explored and marginally settled by enlightened Zakharans, it was the home to a large number of monsters as well as savage tribes of [[halfling]]s, [[human]]s, [[ogre]]s and [[Ogre mage|ogre magi]]. Even the waters were avoided due the [[Sartani|strange crab-like monsters]].",
        "Geography": "Four major groups of islands were usually recognized within the archipelago: the larger [[Jazirat al-Sadaf]] (the \"Island of the Shell\") and [[Jazirat al-Qraidis]] (\"Shrimp Island\"), the long chain called [[Jazayir al-Alfar]] (the \"Islands of the Claws\") extending north and south of Jaziat al-Sadaf, and the smaller [[Uyun al-Sartan]] (\"Eyes of the Crab\") in the center around the so-called [[Batihat al-Saji]], the \"Lagoon of the Brave\".<ref>"
