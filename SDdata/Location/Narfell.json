        "mainbody": "Narfell, also referred to as old Narfell or the Empire of Narfell,  was a once-great, albeit brief-lasting human empire that arose thousands of years before the Era of Upheaval in the Cold Lands. These strong-willed survivors lived hard lives, but still occasionally imperiled by the lingering effects of their wicked pacts with the Lower Planes.\nThe name Narfell also referred to the country that remained after the empires fall, a realm that encompassed the vast plains between neighboring nations. \nAs of the last years of the Age of Humanity, Narfell was a savage and inhospitable realm that attracted few outside visitors. It was home to migrant tribes of horse-riding humans known as the Nars, as well as numerous long-abandoned ruins dating back to the fallen empire.\nDuring the peak of its influence and power, Narfell stretched from the Giantspire Mountains eastward to Lake Ashane,\nand even the Endless Wastes beyond, extending south and east into the Great Dale and the Unapproachable East.\nThe great Underdark domain of Earthroot lay in part beneath the lands of Narfell.\nNarfell was a dry, flat and infertile land, dotted with rocky outcroppings that supported little plant life beyond scrub grass.\n* Icelace Lake, the once-bountiful lake\n* Teardrops, a series of lakes that provided a bounty of fresh food to the Nar tribes.\n*Lake Ashane, an icy body of water, protected by various magical aquatic creatures and defining the southeastern border of Narfell.\n* Rawlinswood, the great forest of the northeast separated the plains of Narfell with the Great Dale to the south. \n* Giantspire Mountains, this massive yet sparsely-populated range separated Narfell from Damara to the west.\n* Harks Finger, a mountain formed from the ruined Netherese enclave of Jiksidur, that unceremoniously fell from the sky unto the plains of Narfell.\n* Mount Nar, the massive snow-capped peak that lay in the lands of Narfell could be seen from as far away as the crossroads village of NJast.\nIt was home to herds of reindeer, wild oxen, as well as an especially large breed of horse known as the Nars, that was quite popular among horse breeders in the region.\nTundra yeti were considered a distinct threat to the inhabitants of the lands grassy plains.\nThe empire of Narfell was ruled by Nentyarch Thargaun Crell, patriarch and founder of the Crell Dynasty. The reign of his descendants were succeeded by the Orgolath and Darakh dynasties, until the empires collapse.\nFollowing the fall of Narfell, the Nar people remained among the plains of the Cold Lands, forming tribes of nomadic horse-riders that spread across from the Rawlinswood to the southern stretches of the Great Glacier. They gathered in temporary tent settlements known as \"waymeets\" while following the migration patterns of deer and oxen.\nFew if any remnants of the ancient Narfell empire lived on in the Nar people, unlike the legacy of the Raumathar that remained with the Hathran of Rashemen.\nthumb|right|250px|The Nar demonbinders carried on the fiend-conjuring traditions of Old Narfell.\nImperialist Nar culture was wholly ingrained with the practice of conjuring and bargaining fiends, as evidenced by the summoning chambers that have been found in each uncovered Nar fortress. Using mere glyphs and wards as their protection, Nar conjurers frequently opened portals to numerous layers of both the Abyss and the Nine Hells.\nRune magic was commonly practiced among the imperialist Nar people, having learned some of its secrets from nearby giants. \nFollowing the collapse of the empire, some Nar demonbinders carried on the old dark ways of conjuring and binding demons from beyond the Prime Material plane.\nThe role of tribal shaman was held high within Nar society. These spiritual leaders solely drew upon blessings from their singular deity Tempus.\nTrade with outsiders was minimal among the tribes of Narfell, and they often exchanged goods with one another by means of barter. \nTraders occasionally passed through Narfell by means of the Long Road, through the Giant Gap pass in the Giantspire Mountains. They would often continue on to the Cold Road, passing by one of the countrys few crossroad villages on their way to neighboring nations, such as Rashemen.\nThe realm was defended by the different tribes coming together to repel foreign invaders\nDuring the time of the ancient Narfell Empire the nearby lakes and seas was patrolled and protected Narfell Armada.\nAs the nations history was long tied to that of neighboring Raumathar, it was only fitting that the two nations shared a common origin. Both realms were founded by mercenaries from the Old Kingdoms of Mulhorand and Unther, following the decline of their first respective empires, after they relocated north as bands of independent warriors. The collective fate of the Nar kingdoms were wrested from their control in the , when the malevolent Thargaun Crell, Nentyarch of Tharos, forged the artifact known as the Crown of Narfell. Granted immense power by the crown, Thargaun established his seat of power at Dun-Tharos and began his campaign of conquest. Within a quarter century all of the kingdoms fell under the emergent empire of Narfell, beholden to Thargaun and his demon lord patron Orcus, Lord of the Undead.\nJust as Narfell became a preeminent power in the Cold Lands in the centuries that followed, so to did the burgeoning power of Raumathar. By the , the two emergent nations had significantly risen in power and engaged escalating conflicts with one another. In the , Narfell and Raumathar entered into a struggle for control over the lands surrounding Lake Ashane. Undeterred from this conflict, Narfell led a failed invasion of Mulhorand and Unther just a few years later.\nHaving seen the first sign in the failure or decline in their power, the priest-kings of Narfell maintained their power through horrid blood-pacts with powerful demons,  gaining terrible and mighty sorcerous powers.\nIn the , Narfell and Raumathar entered into what would become their final war,Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition states -160 DR as the date where Narfell collapsed. ending with one final battle that saw the fall of two magnificent and terrifying civilization, along with the summoning of demon lords Kostchtchie and Eltab to the face of Toril. Ultimately it was the avatar of the deity Kossuth that incinerated each of the warring armies and each of the empires for which they fought.\nSome empires few survivors fled back to individual enclaves in Narfell, vowing to rebuild their mighty realm. In the century that followed, neighboring powers carved out Narfells outer territories for their own, such as the Suren barbarians from the east and Impiltur from the southwest. Other refugees sought refuge in the forests and entered into a pact with a great nature spirit, transforming themselves into the beings known as volodni.\nThe horrific actions taken by the conjurers of the ancient Narfell empire left a lasting strain between the ongoing relationship between mankind and elves that monitored events in the region. The elves could not forget the atrocities committed by the ancient Nars  or their corrupt magic Additionally, small remnants of the Abyss itself known as demoncysts remained buried beneath Narfell and the surrounding landscape for centuries, holding onto horrific beings and previously enthralled fiends. \nFiendish influence over the realm was made worse in the mid–9 century DR, when demons that remained in Rawlinswood following the Fiend Wars were driven away from the forest, inadvertently unleashing a horde upon the tribespeople of Narfell. \nIn the 300 years that followed, the Great Glacier receded from the Cold Lands, unearthing much of northern Narfell and offering more lands to be settled. The lands of Narfell experience waves of immigration from surrounding regions, and by the ,Page 34 of the 2 edition source The Bloodstone Lands states that the Great Glacier covered all of Narfell as of 300 years before 1359 DR. This appears to be retconned in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised), as this timeline is pushed back an additional 300 years. The FRCS 2e timeline is corroborated in the Great Glacier sourcebook and subsequent 3 edition material. During this time, fiends continued to run rampant over the countryside of Narfell, remnants of the former empires lust for power. \nStarting in the 11 century DR, the Knights of Imphras II of Impiltur devoted their service to the Triad by destroying the demons and devils that continued to blight their neighboring lands, including Narfell.\nThe dream of rebuilding the Narfell empire had long since faded by the 14 century DR. By then, Narfell was a frigid land of approximately 20 barbarian Nar tribes, nearly all of which had little or no knowledge of their ancestors sinister past, merely preoccupied as they were with simply surviving though the bitter winters that wracked their homeland. \nWhen the undead hordes of the Witch-King Zhengyi marched across neighboring lands in the 1350s DR, the tribes of the Narfell endured collective peril and prepared for war. They were spared the horrors of warfare however when the forces of Gareth Dragonsbane intercepted the Witch-Kings armies and wrought victory for the region during the Bloodstone Wars. \nDuring the mid–15 century DR, changing weather conditions led to increasingly harsh and more frigid climate for the Nar tribes. Some desperate members sought out the powers once-wielded by those in the Narfell empire, establishing permanent homes near ancient ruined fortresses and once-again engaging in the art of demonbinding.\n* Bildoobaris, or Trade Fair, the unofficial capital of post-imperial Narfell was a vast plain that turned into a bustling city consisting of over 30,000 Nars for one tenday every summer.\n* Jiyyd, a small village that attracted outlanders passing through Nar land.\n* NJast, another small village, one nestled at the intersection of the Long Road and the Cold Road.\n* Peltarch, the fishing town on the shore of Icelace Lake that predominantly comprised folks of Ulyoon tribe.\n*Nar-sek Quistrade, a neutral meeting ground and defensive location, on a northeastern spur of the Giantspire Mountains.\n*Nar-sek Qutel, another neutral meeting ground and refuge from the harsh winters on the western slopes of Harks Finger.\n* Fortress of the Half-Demon, an fortress built of ice-cold stone that appeared to originate from beyond Toril.\n* Fortress Narder, a ruined stronghold in the Forest of Lethyr used by Nar forces to launch assaults on Raumathar. \n* Immilmar, the capital city of Rashemar was built around a long-ruined fortress of Narfell.\n* Jastaath Castle, the site whereupon the priest-kings of Narfell first communed with the fiends of the Abyss.\n* Val Murthag, an ancient castle that once served as a spiritual center for the Narfell demon-worshipers. \n* Dun-Tharos, the once-great capital of the Narfell empire languished as ruins for centuries, drawing strange and powerful beings to dwell within. \n* Shandaular, a former capital of the Nar kingdom of Ashanath later came to be known as the City of Weeping Ghosts.\nNarfell was predominantly home to groups of humans, originally emigrants from Mulhorand and Thay to the south. Its people came to be known as the Nar (or Nars), an ethnic group of tribespeople that migrated across the lands. and Quencesta. \nSome of old Narfells ruined strongholds were home undead in the form ghosts, wraiths, and even dread wraiths.\n* Thalaman Harthgroth, leader of the Harthgroth tribe as of 1372 DR.\n* Kryonar, the white dracolich."
