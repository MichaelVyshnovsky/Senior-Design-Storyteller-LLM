Nevertheless, some of the survivors hoped to rebuild.\nThe gate to the Plane of Fire was not permanent, but remained opened until after the destruction of the cities of Lasdur, Taskaunt, Murbant, and Thasselen. It lay on the opposite side of the ruined village from the river, and appeared simply as a  steady flame sitting in the middle of a burnt patch of grass. It was protected by an honor guard of salamanders.\nThe people of First Falls subsisted on fishing and farming. They mostly worked in supporting local traveling tax collectors."
