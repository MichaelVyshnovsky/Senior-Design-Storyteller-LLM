        "Geography": "The village was located within the [[tharch]] of [[Lapendrar]]. It sat just atop the [[First Escarpment]] along the [[River Lapendrar]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the village was burned down by the [[salamander]]s and [[efreet]] summoned by the [[Zulkir]] of [[Conjuration]] when he opened a ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], beginning the ill-fated Salamander War. Nevertheless, some of the survivors hoped to rebuild.",
        "Notable Locations": "The ''gate'' to the Plane of Fire was not permanent, but remained opened until after the destruction of the cities of [[Lasdur]], [[Taskaunt]], [[Murbant]], and [[Thasselen]]. It lay on the opposite side of the ruined village from the river, and appeared simply as a {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes|adj=tall}} steady flame sitting in the middle of a burnt patch of grass. It was protected by an honor guard of salamanders.",
        "Inhabitants": "The people of First Falls subsisted on [[fish]]ing and farming. They mostly worked in supporting local traveling [[tax collector]]s."
