The Doomvault of Thay was a massive dungeon containing laboratories used by Szass Tam to fuel his ascension to godhood.
The Doomvault was located deep beneath Thaymount.
As an ancient dungeon located in the magical realm of Thay, the Doomvault was defended by numerous powerful Red Wizards, their golem servants, and a multitude of varied monsters, bound outsiders, and raised undead, as well as magical traps and natural hazards.
The Red Wizard Kazit Gul spent the vast majority of his lifespan studying the most famous and deadly dungeons in Faer√ªn. Towards the end of his life, he began constructing a vast labyrinth and successfully pursued lichdom in order to finish his work. The purpose of the dungeon was to lure adventurers inside where Kazit Gul could then devour their souls to empower his phylactery.
The Doomvault passed into legend as Thay became a less welcoming place to foreigners but Szass Tam rediscovered and repurposed it to his own ends.
When Tam learned of the Second Sundering, he had his agents capture several Chosen for experimentation. They were brought to Doomvault with an eye toward using their divine power to aid Tams goal of apotheosis.
