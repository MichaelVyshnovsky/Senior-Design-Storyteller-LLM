        "mainbody": "'''Gugedo''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. Its people made their living primarily on fishing.",
        "Description": "Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\n\nThe people of Gugedo were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. The hamlet had a population of about 325 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.",
        "Geography": "Gugedo was located on the southwestern tip of the island of [[Tsukishima]], on the west coast.",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]], and Gugedo was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed.",
        "Trade": "Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Gugedo had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The people were fishers, but there is no evidence that they traded in fish.\n\nThe cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 3 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 3 fen to sell.",
        "Defenses": "About 33 citizens of Gugedo served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.",
        "Religion": "Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Gugedo were strict followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]]. They were usually strongly opposed to anyone visiting their village who would not demonstrate devotion to the Path by making a donation to a shrine, reciting a prayer, or spitting on the symbol of [[Chauntea]], who was considered a heretical faith.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Shigeruchan]], a [[monk]] who was the religious leader of the settlement.",
        "History": "Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
