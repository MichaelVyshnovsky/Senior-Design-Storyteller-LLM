        "mainbody": "Gugedo was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa. Its people made their living primarily on fishing.\nMost of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka, built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\nThe people of Gugedo were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. The hamlet had a population of about 325 individuals after .\nGugedo was located on the southwestern tip of the island of Tsukishima, on the west coast.\nVillages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya, typically a minor samurai, and Gugedo was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed.\nLike the other tiny settlements of the region, Gugedo had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The people were fishers, but there is no evidence that they traded in fish.\nThe cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 3 fen. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 3 fen to sell.\nAbout 33 citizens of Gugedo served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears.\nLike most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Gugedo were strict followers of the Path of Enlightenment. They were usually strongly opposed to anyone visiting their village who would not demonstrate devotion to the Path by making a donation to a shrine, reciting a prayer, or spitting on the symbol of Chauntea, who was considered a heretical faith.\n* Shigeruchan, a monk who was the religious leader of the settlement.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
