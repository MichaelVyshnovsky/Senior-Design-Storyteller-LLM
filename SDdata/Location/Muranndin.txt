'''Muranndin''', also known formerly as '''Murannheim''' and the '''Sothillisian Empire''',  was a kingdom of [[ogre]]s and [[orc]]s in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] in [[West Faer没n|western Faer没n]].

==Geography==
The monster kingdom of Muranndin bordered [[Amn]] in the north via the [[Small Teeth|Small Teeth Mountains]], [[Tethyr|Tethyr's]] northern [[Wealdath]] forest in the east, and west with the [[Dragon's Head]] peninsula. This left the independent duchy of [[Velen]] isolated from the rest of [[Faer没n]]. 

==Government==
The monarch of this kingdom was called the "[[Great Mur]]" or "Murkul", which usually was the chieftain of the strongest tribe. The Great Mur was responsible for essentially keeping the other tribes and bandits together and prevent infighting between them.

==Trade==
The kingdom had few qualms about seizing the wealth and goods that passed through or near their territory, however they were known to form secret arrangements to leave the caravans of select wealthy merchants alone in exchange for payment in either [[currency|gold]] or weapons.

Slavery was the status quo since the foundation of the kingdom. The conquerors of the [[Murann]] city enslaved thousands of Amnians back in the 1370s and the descendants of those slaves served the ogres, orcs, and brigands of the area. A slave in Muranndin could fight his way out by showing martial skill or usefulness enough to impress either his owner or one of the chieftains.

==Inhabitants==
The chieftains maintained scattered strongholds and keeps across the kingdom that were vital to secure the borders, especially with Amn since Muranndin was established on a great portion of Amnian soil and the High Houses offered bounties on ogres, trolls, and giants.

==History==
The kingdom of Muranndin existed since the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, when a duo of [[ogre mage]]s, [[Sothillis]] and [[Cyrvisnea]], led an army of monstrous humanoids and worshipers of [[Cyric]] against southern Amn in a conflict that would come to be known as the [[Sothillisian War]]. The official establishment of the kingdom, however, was after the successful siege of the southwest Amnian city of Murann in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, that eventually became its capital. As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, it had become common knowledge that one of Amn's ruling [[Council of Six]] was present in the city when it was captured, and the Council had became increasingly concerned that this imprisoned councilor might have given away important information under duress.

During the early years, the kingdom was more commonly known as the "Sothillisian Empire" or as "Murannheim".

As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, Muranndin remained a constant threat to Amnian trade interests. In-fighting within the kingdom was common at this time, and the Great Mur wielded only nominal control over Muranndin's chieftains and bandit lords.
