'''Honeyhollow Fortress''' was a [[sprite]] encampment found in the [[Domains of Delight|domain]] of [[Thither]] in the [[Feywild]].{{Cite comic/Dungeons & Dragons Annual 2022}}

{{Quote|There shall be no negotiation, you furry fiend! Your attack upon the Honeyhollow shall be punished forthwith.|One of Honeyhollow's sprite defenders.}}

==Description==
The fortress appeared to comprise a single tree, within which the sprites made their home.

==History==
At some point, a giant [[harengon]] and [[human]] riding aboard an [[owlbear]]-driven carriage attacked Honeyhollow, by ramming their conveyance into the fortress at full force. The valiant sprites defended their home with treated [[arrow]]s, incapacitating the invaders and allowing them to be restrained for interrogation.

Upon dutiful questions, the sprites of Honeyhollow realized the interlopers were on a quest of great importance. The human woman was heartbroken over the loss of her brother, who had been captured by the malevolent [[hag]] [[Skabatha Nightshade|Granny Nightshade]]. The sprites of Honeyhollow made a bargain with their captives: they would be set free, so long as they vowed to secure certain rare [[material component]]s from the hag, when they broke into her lair. [[Paddington|Sir Paddington]] led the duo out of Honeyhollow and into the domain of Granny Nightshade.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Puddington|Sir Puddington]]
