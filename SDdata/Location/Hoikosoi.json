        "mainbody": "Hoikosoi was a farming village, one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa.\nHoikosoi was unique on the Peninsula for having very fertile soil, which was used to grow vegetables and raise cattle.\nMost of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka, built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\nThe people of Hoikosoi were especially suspicious of strangers and refused to allow any to enter their settlement. The hamlet had a population of only about 95 individuals after .\nHoikosoi was located in the south of the island of Tsukishima, on the east of the Fochu Peninsula near the Momoben Forest.\nVillages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya, typically a minor samurai.\nAbout ten citizens of Hoikosoi served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears.\nUnlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Hoikosoi were not particularly religious.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
