'''Aerhiot's Field''' was a farm somewhere in [[Faerûn]] during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
There was a sunken road between Aerhiot's Field and the neighboring [[Salopar's Field]]. The hedges outside both fields had overgrown into the ditch-level path to such a degree that they formed a gloomy tunnel-like space underneath their intertwined branches.

===Flora and Fauna===
[[Squirrel]]s and [[bird]]s darted along the path every time someone used it.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, while traversing the path between Aerhiot's Field and Salopar's Field, the farmer [[Nuglar]] fell prey to [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]], a mysterious, ethereal apparition, which slew him and his three [[oxen]], leaving nothing but dust behind.
