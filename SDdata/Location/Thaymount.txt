The '''Thaymount''' was a hundred-mile long chain of volcanic mountains at the heart of [[Thay]], located within the [[tharch]] [[Thaymount (tharch)|of the same name]] that encompassed the entire plateau of [[High Thay]] atop the [[Second Escarpment]]. Access to Thaymount, along with the corresponding tharch, was restricted to the [[Red Wizards]] who regularly traveled to and from the tharch, building new fortifications and attending clandestine meetings.

{{quote|''These cliffs, too, were liberally dotted with small fortresses and defensive troops, and the towering mass of Thaymount – grim and brooding, with occasional plumes of ash rising from its peaks – served only to increase the lurking sense of dread we all felt. "What in [[Oghma]]'s name could they be doing up there?" Phillip asked quietly as we rode together at the head of our caravan. I scratched my beard and tried to smile in spite of my fear. "That," I said, "is something I would rather not know."''|Excerpt from [[Heino]]'s report}}

==Description==
[[File:Thay 3e.png|thumb|''A map of Thaymount at the center of [[Thay]].''|425x425px]]
Some of the volcanoes of Thaymount were still active, as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Those peaks that were not smoldering, were shaped like fangs, darting up into ridges and walls of [[basalt]].

The rivers [[River Umber|Umber]], [[River Lapendrar|Lapendrar]], and [[River Eltar|Eltar]] all had their source in the soot-covered glaciers in atop the Thaymount. The mountains also housed [[Thayvian gold mines]] located south of the [[Citadel]], volcanic [[forge]]s, magical workshops, barracks of Thay's monstrous armies, and the private fortresses of many Red Wizards. Under the Citadel, deep underneath Thaymount, laid the [[Paths of the Doomed]] – a dangerous labyrinthine cave system and defense chambers for the Citadel's inner sanctums.

The Thaymount hid tunnels that connected it to the [[Underdark]].

===Flora & Fauna===
Areas high in the mountains, close to the volcanos, were inhabited by [[fire elemental]]s and wild [[wyvern]]s.

==Government==
The Thaymount, the tharch, and the Thayvian gold mines were overseen by tharchion [[Willeth Lionson]] in [[1362 DR]], who was murdered and was briefly impersonated by [[Asp (spirit naga)|Asp]], a [[naga]] ally of [[Zulkir]] [[Maligor]].The next tharchion to take the rulership was [[Spiros Dehkahks]] who came to opposed Tam and disappeared ''circa'' [[1367 DR]], only to be replaced by [[Pyras Autorian]], a young and easily manipulated Red Wizard.

==Trade==
Apart from gold, the tunnels underneath the Thaymount had occasional but rich deposits of [[crimson gold]] and [[kings' tears]], that were mostly untouched during Szass Tam's time as the de facto master of Thaymount. Much of the exported [[enchanted]] items from out of Thay were created in the laboratories and factories of the Thaymount.

==Defenses==
The Thaymount was well defended by Thay's military reserves stationed in the mountains, including countless [[gnoll]]s, [[darkenbeast]]s,<ref> Notably, Thaymount's [[Grummsh's Legion]] comprised of orcs and [[orog]]s was considered to be the best military unit in all of Thay in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

Magical defenses of the Thaymount included a magical ''dampening field'', erected in the mid 14{{th}} century DR. It stopped ''[[divination]]''s of all.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|204}}, the [[War of Claws]] came to an end with the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]]'s defeat and imprisonment within a ''[[demoncyst]]'' deep underneath the Thaymount mountains.

The imprisoned demon lord was released in the {{YearlinkName|1367}} by the Zulkir of [[Necromancy]] [[Szass Tam]] in attempts to steal the great fiend's fearsome powers using The [[Devouring Chambers]] under the Citadel. The attempt was a failure, thwarted was a group of heroes sent there by the [[Simbul]]. Instead of raging across the [[Prime Material plane]], Eltab hid within the ''demoncyst''.

On [[Kythorn 3]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, an opponent of Tam's – [[Naglatha]] the Black Flame, the chief of Thay's foreign activities, guided by prophetic dreams, blackmailed [[thief]] [[Thazienne Uskevren]] into retrieving magic scrolls from the Citadel's inner chambers. Unbeknownst to Naglatha, the dreams were subtle magical manipulations of Eltab, whom she inadvertently released. Now freed, Eltab possessed the body of [[Tharchion]] of Thaymount, Pyras Autorian and unleashed monstrous creatures of the ''demoncyst'' on the tharch. Eltab caused Thaymont's volcanoes to erupt, sowing chaos and destruction. The demon's old enemy Szass Tam and Thazi assembled Tam's armies of [[juju zombies]], darkenbeasts, and blooded ones and confronted the demon lord and his army of ''demoncyst-changed'' monsters. Thazienne barely survived her one-on-one battle with Eltab, winning after suffering deadly injuries and killing the demon's host with her [[crimson gold]] [[dagger]]. Despite Pyras Autorian's death by Thazienne's dagger, the Tharchion was brought back as Tam's puppet.

By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Thaymount was a heavily guarded territory, off-limits to anyone but the tharchions and zulkirs. Any caught trespassers were executed on sight.

In the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, Szass Tam established the Thaymount as his seat of power capital of Thay.

When the Spellplague began ravaging [[Toril]] from the {{YearlinkName|1385}} to the {{YearlinkName|1395}}, the [[Plateau of Thay]] was pushed thousands of feet up from underground, causing large-scale eruption of the Thaymount, which led to much destruction and melting glaciers.

==Notable Locations== 
*[[Academy of Shapers and Binders]], a Thayan mage school, was located on the Thaymount, near one of the active volcanos.
*[[Doomvault]], a massive dungeon containing laboratories used by Szass Tam to fuel his ascension to godhood in the 15{{th}} century DR.
*[[Phantasmal Fortress]], the labyrinthine keep of deceptions and illusions, the fortress of [[Hlarkus Baltreyo]], the Mad Zulkir of Illusion in the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==Inhabitants==
The tharch was home to zulkirs and the most powerful Red Wizards; access to the area was strictly controlled. Along with Zulkirs, the Thaymount was home to their armies of gnolls, many other creatures, and slaves.
