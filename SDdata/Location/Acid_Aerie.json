        "mainbody": "he Acid Aerie was gorge located several days walk west of Blingdenstone. \nThe Acid Aerie was several hundred-foot-wide and filled with foul-smelling acid, the result of a wizards experiment long ago. Several crisscrossing stone walkways of various widths allowed land-bound creatures to traverse the cavern and leave via the many tunnels that lined the walls, several of which lead into simple side-corridors or into the Wormwrithings. \nThe Aerie part of its name was gained from a flock of dire corbies that inhabited the area, which were killed by Drizzt DoUrden, Belwar Dissengulp, Clacker, and the spirit wraith of Zaknafein DoUrden."
