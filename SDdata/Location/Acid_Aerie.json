        "mainbody": "The '''Acid Aerie''' was gorge located several days walk west of [[Blingdenstone]].",
        "Description": "The Acid Aerie was several hundred-foot-wide and filled with foul-smelling acid, the result of a wizard's experiment long ago{{timescale}}. Several crisscrossing stone walkways of various widths allowed land-bound creatures to traverse the cavern and leave via the many tunnels that lined the walls, several of which lead into simple side-corridors or into the [[Wormwrithings]].",
        "History": "The 'Aerie' part of its name was gained from a flock of [[dire corbies]] that inhabited the area, which were killed by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], [[Belwar Dissengulp]], [[Clacker]], and the [[zin-carla|spirit wraith]] of [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]]."
