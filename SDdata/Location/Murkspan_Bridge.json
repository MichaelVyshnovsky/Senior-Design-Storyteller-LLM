        "mainbody": "he Murkspan Bridge was a bridge located in Skullport.\nThe Murkspan Bridge was an arched stone structure that connected Skull Island with the Lower Port, spanning the murky depths of Skull Pool at a height of approximately . The bridges construction represented a blend of natural and artificial elements. Massive stone blocks, quarried from the cavern walls, were used in conjunction with three pairs of naturally occurring stone columns that rose from the floor of Skull Pool to the cavern ceiling. These columns were carefully trimmed to support the roadbed and arches of the bridge, which was fully paved with flagstones.\nThe port side of the bridge was richly adorned with sculptures, bas-reliefs, and carvings depicting symbols of death, chains, skulls, and manacles, serving as a grim warning to travelers approaching the Skull Island prison and its associated slave pens. The bridge was a favored roost for large clouds of bats, which circled above in pursuit of pale gray and white moths.\nDuring high tide, the bridge was a popular spot for fishing, with orcs, humans, and dwarves casting lines into the water. Occasionally, large species such as blind gumpfish, sturgeon, and salmon were caught, though the fishermen were at times dragged into the depths by unseen predators. In response, those fishing here often carried light crossbows in addition to their tackle.\nThe bridge also served as a discreet location for trade and business away from the busy port. Notably, an illithid named Shaun Taunador frequently docked his barge near the port end of the bridge, selling potions, antidotes, and similar alchemical wares. His merchandise was well-regarded, comparable only to that offered by Vhondryl at The Deepfires. Taunador was always accompanied by a retinue of armed quaggoths and human enforcers, ensuring his safety while conducting business.\nAccess to Skull Island via the Murkspan Bridge was closely monitored. Upon arrival, travelers were questioned about their purpose, and those without legitimate reason to visit the island were turned away. A detachment of six to ten Skull Island guards were stationed at the islands end of the bridge at all times, vigilantly observing any suspicious activities. These guards did not leave their posts to handle disturbances in the Port unless explicitly ordered by a recognized leader of the Iron Ring. Historically, battles for control of the bridge have been brutal and short, with the bodies of the defeated cast into the cold waters below by the victors.\nUnbeknownst to most, the central  section of the Murkspan Bridge, which lacked significant undersupports, was designed with a hidden mechanism allowing it to collapse. This feature served as a defensive measure, either to thwart external assaults on Skull Island or to isolate the island in the event of an internal uprising, such as a slave revolt.\nWhile the islands guards were aware of the bridges collapsible section, they were not authorized to activate the mechanism on their own accord. The collapse could only be triggered upon receiving direct orders from a leader of the Iron Ring."
