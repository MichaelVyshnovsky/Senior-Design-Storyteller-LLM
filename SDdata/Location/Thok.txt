'''Thok''' was a village in [[Tabot]].{{Cite dungeon/8/The Flowers of Flame|49-51}}<ref group="note">Sources and maps variously call Thok a village, town, or city; "village" is adopted here to suit the description in "The Flowers of Flame".

==Geography==
It stood at the foot of the northern face of the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]], beside the southern forests of Tabot. Roads from here led northwest to [[Darka]] and east to [[Khampo]],{{Cite interactive atlas|?}} both roughly a day's ride away.

==Description==
It was a small village with a lone trading post and the manors of three minor nobles. These stood at the town center around a cobbled courtyard and a shallow well fed by a spring.

==Inhabitants==
It was inhabited mostly by [[goat]] herders.

==History==
When a band of [[adventurer]]s came through Thok in their quest to find the [[Valley of Wings]] and the [[Flowers of Flame]], no one there knew how to find themâ€”unsurprisingly, for they were thought to be a fairy-tale. Regardless, the people of Thok suggested they find a good guide. Six likely local guides were found at the trading post: [[Chang-chub]], [[Sakya]], [[Tshal]], [[Pagmotru]], [[Gedun]], and [[Karmapa]], of varying skill, approach, and reliability. Whoever they chose, in Thok they could trade their fine [[horse]]s for pack-carrying goats or [[donkey]]s for the journey into the mountains{{Cite dungeon/8/The Flowers of Flame|61}}

In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, in response to a [[Phutan]]ese army assembling at the border, Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in [[Bidnop So]], Darka, Thok, and Khampo. That same year, when [[yeti]] emerged from the Wu Pi Te Shar mountains and raided [[Nafeen Gompa]], the dzong-pon (sheriff) of Thok district organized a hunting expedition against them, distributing printed handbills around southwestern Tabot as far as Bidnop So Bridge. Among the first volunteers were 25 people from Eo'tzi Gompa, who quickly went to Nafeen.<ref name="KT77" >
