The '''Thayan enclave''' was a [[Red Wizard]] [[Thayan enclave|enclave]] in the second quarter of the city of [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]]. It was established in [[1365 DR]], following Senator [[Salatis]]'s seizure of power with Thayan support.

==Trade==
The enclave supplied [[magical item]]s and services to customers in Innarlith. Among these services included the raising of corpses as [[undead]] workers for use as laborers for the city-state's project to build a canal to connect the Lake of Steam to the [[Nagaflow]].<ref>

==History==
[[Marek Rymüt]] was a clandestine Red Wizard who had been operating as a secret Thayan agent in Innarlith since the 1340s DR. He posed as a wizard who sold magical items and services without any allegiance to the Red Wizards. In 1365 DR, he assisted Senator Salatis in overthrowing Ransar [[Osorkon]], the leader of the city-state, with an army of [[black firedrake]]s that he had bred. Following Salatis' seizure of power, Salatis agreed to Marek's demand for the creation of the Thayan enclave in Innarlith.

This enclave supplied magical items and services for customers. Marek had already gained a near-monopoly on the control of the magic trade in Innarlith even before the establishment of the enclave. After it was established, it was used to supply magical services and items to customers in the city-state.

Senator [[Willem Korvan]] was married to Senator [[Inthelph]]'s daughter [[Phyrea]] in a Cyricist ceremony within the Thayan enclave in [[1367 DR]]. He was later secretly murdered and raised as an undead servant by Marek in the enclave in [[1368 DR]]. <ref>

Phyrea later stole an enchanted flamberge that Marek had used to make Willem into an undead creature from the enclave in [[1374 DR]]. <ref>

Senator [[Pristoleph]] became the largest customer of the enclave before his coming to power as Ransar in [[1371 DR]]. However, he later turned against the Thayan presence in Innarlith, leading to him banishing Marek and his allies following their failed attempt to overthrow him in [[1374 DR]].<ref>
