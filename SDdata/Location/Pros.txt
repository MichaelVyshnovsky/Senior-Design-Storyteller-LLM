Settlement
Pros was a ruined settlement
Even before it fell into ruin, Pros was not the most beauteous locale. Its buildings were in great disrepair, and its "port" had only a few rickety docks that could not support larger vessels.
The town was located on the shores of the Castaway Coast on the southern side of the Dragonmere. It marked the termination of the Turnstone Road that linked it with the large city of Elversult.
During its time, Pros was governed by a local mayor and a town council.
Both Pros and the larger town of Ilipur were known as the "eyes and ears" of Elversult. Both towns functioned as a unloading point for goods that were moved overland to the crossroads city. Local dockworkers would load shipments aboard flat barges and punts, and direct them out to waiting ships. It was considered the perfect location from which to smuggle illicit goods or items that were preferably not known about by others.
The Cult of the Dragon established themselves in Elversult and Pros during the early 13 century DR, in the . They aligned themselves with the black dragon Hethcypressarvil, also known as Cypress, that later became a dracolich.
After Cypress was destroyed, in the , the fishers of Pros bringing in large catches of shark, that were then sold to members of the Dragon Cult for great sums of money.
When the Spellplague struck Faer√ªn in the , the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars receded, and many coastal settlements were left destitute and outright abandoned. Pros was one of those towns by the 15 century it was hardly worth mentioning except as a memory of the past.
The town had a number of small, unremarkable inns, none of which were particularly noteworthy.
Agents of many secretive and outright nefarious groups operated within Pros, including the Purple Masks, Night Masks, and Tide Flowers thieves guild the Men of the Basilisk slavers group the Astorians of Teziir the Cult of the Dragon and their main opposing organization, the Harpers.
