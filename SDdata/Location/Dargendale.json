        "Description": "Dargendale was an obscure settlement of common and superstitious folk. Surrounded by woods, the locals believed that the elusive [[White Stag of Dargendale]] was an omen of good luck.",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1372 DR]], a rich hunter [[Worlges]] the Black managed to capture the favorite local beast - the White Stag. The hunter killed and stuffed the animal, the act that angered the local peasantry. Eventually, this unrest inspired a traveling [[druid]] to reanimate the taxidermy stag, which exacted its revenge on the hunter, leaving him dead and skewered by the stuffed beast's antlers.\n\nEventually, the stuffed White Stag of Dargendale was moved away from the Dalelands and found home in [[Torleth's Treasures]] of [[Gillian's Hill]] in i372 DR."
