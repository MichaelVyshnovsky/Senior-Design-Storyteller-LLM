        "mainbody": "Dargendale was a small settlement in the Dalelands, surrounded by thick woods, protected from poachers by the local law.\nDargendale was an obscure settlement of common and superstitious folk. Surrounded by woods, the locals believed that the elusive White Stag of Dargendale was an omen of good luck.\nSometime before 1372 DR, a rich hunter Worlges the Black managed to capture the favorite local beast - the White Stag. The hunter killed and stuffed the animal, the act that angered the local peasantry. Eventually, this unrest inspired a traveling druid to reanimate the taxidermy stag, which exacted its revenge on the hunter, leaving him dead and skewered by the stuffed beasts antlers.\nEventually, the stuffed White Stag of Dargendale was moved away from the Dalelands and found home in Torleths Treasures of Gillians Hill in i372 DR."
