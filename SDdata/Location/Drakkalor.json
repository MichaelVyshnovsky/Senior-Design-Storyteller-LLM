        "mainbody": "rakkalor was one of the eight subkingdoms of the dwarven realm of Shanatar.\nThe ruins of Drakkalor were located beneath the Kuldin Peaks which were located in the surface realm of Tethyr.\nRumours held that ghosts and haunts roamed the tunnels of the ruined kingdom, but in fact it was inhabited by a confederation of skulks. The skulks settled in the area long ago after escaping slavery from a drow city. Most avoided any visistors to the realm but some served a doppelganger who made a lair within the treasure vault of the ruined palace. The skulks learned how to use the ancient dwarven mechanisms and used them to prevent intruders into the realm.\nDrakkalor was once a thriving kingdom. Unlike many other dwarven settlements, the economy of Drakkalor was based not on mining or mineral wealth but rather crafting items and trade. Over time, greed and covetousness consumed the inhabitants of the realm, especially the upper ruling class."
