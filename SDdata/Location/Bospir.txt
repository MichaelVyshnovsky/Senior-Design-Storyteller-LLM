'''Bospir''' was a small sheep market town found in [[Cormyr]]'s eastern frontier accessible by the [[East Way]].

==Description==
The small town was a dirty cluster of rustic cottages built around a trio of wells were found in the center of the village. The cottages were encircled by a number of [[cattle]] and [[sheep]] ranches. Despite Bospir having only one inn, the town had many rooming houses that offered lodgings, paid by the [[tenday]].

==Geography==
The town had only one road that led towards it – the [[East Way]], north of the village..{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}}

==Trade==
The economy of Bospir was entirely dependent on raising sheep. As such, the stink of sheep could be smelled everywhere in the village. Bospir offered little to its visitors, apart from cattle purchase, quality [[wool]] produced there, and fancy [[lamb]] meats.

==Culture==
Bospir was known to be a highly superstitious community. This was exacerbated in [[1370 DR]] under the dark influence of [[Nalavarauthatoryl]], when the villagers' fear of evil magics, blight, and curses, starting witch hunts, justified or not. One unfortunate traveler was burnt on a stake for simply wearing suspicious-looking black [[cloak]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Bospir had a spy placed there by Lord [[Vorik Aris]], a past supporter of revolutionary [[Gondegal]], the Lost King.

==Notable Locations==
* [[The Drover's Inn|Drover's Inn]], Bospir's only inn as of the late 14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Nightbleat Tavern]], a rowdy tavern that catered to the local shepherds.
