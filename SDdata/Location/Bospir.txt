Bospir was a small sheep market town found in Cormyrs eastern frontier accessible by the East Way.
The small town was a dirty cluster of rustic cottages built around a trio of wells were found in the center of the village. The cottages were encircled by a number of cattle and sheep ranches. Despite Bospir having only one inn, the town had many rooming houses that offered lodgings, paid by the tenday.
The town had only one road that led towards it – the East Way, north of the village..
The economy of Bospir was entirely dependent on raising sheep. As such, the stink of sheep could be smelled everywhere in the village. Bospir offered little to its visitors, apart from cattle purchase, quality wool produced there, and fancy lamb meats.

One unfortunate traveler was burnt on a stake for simply wearing suspicious-looking black cloak.
