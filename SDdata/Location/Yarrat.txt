Yarrat was a small dwarven village within the High Desert of Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Yarrat was located near the southern tip of the Genies Anvil. The dwarves dug pits into the sand that were shaded by ironwood trees. Each family had their own pit.
Yarrat was populated by hearty dwarves whose ability to survive and find water was legendary. It was rumored that they had over a hundred secret water caches scattered throughout the Genies Anvil. Other desert tribes would often hire the dwarves as guides in their travels.
The females practiced sahar, a special form of magic that used colored stones taken from the Genies Anvil.
