'''Yarrat''' was a small dwarven village within the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Yarrat was located near the southern tip of the [[Genies' Anvil]]. The dwarves dug pits into the sand that were shaded by ironwood trees. Each family had their own pit.

==Inhabitants==
Yarrat was populated by hearty [[dwarves]] whose ability to survive and find water was legendary. It was rumored that they had over a hundred secret water caches scattered throughout the Genies' Anvil. Other desert tribes would often hire the dwarves as guides in their travels.

The females practiced [[sahar]], a special form of [[magic]] that used colored stones taken from the Genies' Anvil.
