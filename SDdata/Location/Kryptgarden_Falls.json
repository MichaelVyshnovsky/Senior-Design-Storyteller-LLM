        "mainbody": "'''Kryptgarden Falls''' was an ancient [[Netherese]] outpost built in the [[Sword Mountains]] during its early period of expansion.",
        "Geography": "The outpost was located within the foothills of the northern Sword Mountains, in the woods of the [[Kryptgarden Forest]] northwest of [[Southkrypt]].",
        "History": "Kryptgarden Falls came about during [[Netheril]]'s Silver Age ({{yearlink|-2758}} to {{yearlink|-2208}}), when the [[Terraseer]] directed Netheril to explore its western frontier. Reported among the first promising sites in {{yearlinkConvert|1491|NY}}, alongside [[Old Owl Well]] and [[Spirecoast]], Kryptgarden Falls served as a caravan stop, watering station, and fortified watchpost amid Netheril's westward expansion. Secured with warriors and overseen by [[arcanist]]s, it was equipped with ''[[crystal ball]]s'' that were used to spy on the surrounding area, especially the nearby [[elves]] of [[Illefarn]]. The outpost was also fitted with a ''[[mythallar]]'' that powered [[quasimagical item]]s, but the requirement for expeditions to venture further and further afield caused the development of some of Netheril's first proper [[magical item]]s that could be used anywhere."
