'''The Well of Dragons''' was the name of the fortress operated by the [[Cult of the Dragon]], built within a dormant volcano that once served as an ancient [[dragon]] graveyard. While it originally served as the location where cultists would facilitate [[dragon]]s' transformations into [[dracolich]]es,

{{Quote|Severin's [[Cult of the Dragon]] is gathering an army with their new [[Thay]]an allies in a place called the Well of Dragons...they've been raiding towns up and down the Sword Coast, amassing a vast hoard of treasure, and taking prisoners...Severin is planning a ritual to summon the dragon goddess, Tiamat from the Nine Hells!<br />
[[Elminster]] himself is calling upon representatives from all over to meet him at the Well of Dragons. We could also use any support we can get...|[[Boward]], agent of the [[Harpers]].}}

==Description==
[[File:WoD map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A map of the Well of Dragons, ''circa'' the 1480s [[DR]].]]
The citadel was built at the bottom of the caldera of a once-active volcano. Its steep walls led down the deep crater, the floor of which was lined with the remains of hundreds upon hundreds of dragons.

The site was a legendary graveyard of dragons, shrouded in [[shadow magic]]. Historically it was the place many dragons would travel to to when they were ready to die a natural death. It was filled with much of the riches and treasure they had hoarded in their life.

Following the Cult's takeover of the site, it was no longer a site to which dragons went to die, but rather a place where they could negotiate their future immortality.

==Geography==
It was located the canyonlands north of the [[River Reaching]] and [[Sunset Mountains]], and some ways east of [[Skull Gorge]].

About a mile to the east was a small—and appropriately named—[[the Dire Dragon|Dire Dragon]] inn. This inn was all that remained of the village of [[Ladydove]], which itself destroyed by the ''actual'' Dire Dragon, [[Uthagrimnoshaarl]], guardian of the Well of Dragons.

==Structure==
[[File:Well of Dragons - Chamber of Ascendance.jpg|thumb|left|''Within the Chamber of Ascendance, a blue dragon has an audience with Cult members.'']]
Within the Well of Dragons was a large cavern referred to as the Chamber of Ascendance. This space was used by the original Cult of the Dragon to transform living dragons into [[dracolich|"Sacred Ones"]]. These dragons were set upon a large ritual platform as the transformation process began.

Decades later, the floor of the caldera was repurposed to house construction of [[Tiamat's Temple]].

==Activities==
Throughout the late 14{{th}} century, the Well of Dragons served as the sole location where the Cult of the Dragon attempted to transform dragons into dracoliches.

==Leadership==
Throughout much of its existence the Well of the Dragons was overseen by the dragon cult leader [[Vargo Kent]].

==Defenses==
To dissuade invaders, the landscape around the Well of Dragons was concealed with illusory terrain that originated from the inherent [[shadow magic]] that permeated its depths. This line of defense was weakened when moonlight was more prevalent.

The citadel itself was well defended as it often came under attack from treasure hunters and dragons angered by the cult's beliefs. Over the decades, these defenses were bolstered significantly. that included thousands of mercenaries, monstrous beasts, [[giant]]s, and even [[devil]]s from the [[Nine Hells]].

==History==
===Origins and Cult Takeover===
The origins surrounding the discovery of the dragon graveyard varied slightly between recounts. Some scholars stated it was uncovered by the Cult of the Dragon cell based in the [[Western Heartlands]], Regardless of which group arrived first, those cultists found the site was guarded by an [[undead]] [[shadow dragon]] known as [[Uthagrimnoshaarl]] the Dire Dragon.{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}} Initially, Uthagrimnoshaarl merely allowed the cultists to say their peace and flee his domain, before graciously allowing them to leave with their lives.

Eventually, the dragon cultists managed to somehow free Uthagrimnoshaarl from the magic that bound it to the dragon graveyard, led by the warlord Naergoth Bladelord. Over 250 laborers worked tirelessly for years, and the fortress at the Well of Dragons was finally completed in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.

It was that same year that Vargo Kent's apprentice [[Reveilaein Brant]] uncovered an ancient tablet of [[Kalzareinad]] that detailed the process of how even a [[half-dragon]] could undertake a process to become a dracolich.

===Rededication to Tiamat===
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Cult of the Dragons' plots had shifted. As the group came upon the leadership of [[Severin Silrajin]], they forewent their obsession over dracoliches and other undead dragons for veneration of the goddess [[Tiamat]]. As of the 1480s DR, they intended to summon Tiamat to [[Toril]] from the [[Nine Hells]].

To achieve this, the dragon cultists began to amass treasures of all sorts—including piles of [[gp|gold]], finely-crafted [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], [[gem]]s of all sorts, and valuable [[tome]]s—from across the [[Sword Coast]] and beyond, They amassed all their numbers at the Well in anticipation of her arrival, and even forged an alliance with the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].

[[File:Severin WoD.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Severin Silrajin]] standing before the chasm, ready to summon his goddess [[Tiamat]].]]
As the cultists neared their goal in the 1480s DR, they managed to sound the ''[[Draakhorn]]'', summoning [[chromatic dragon]]s far and wide to the Well of Dragons. With their massive hoard and draconic allies ''en route'', Severin and the cultists merely had to perform their ritual and sacrifice innocents they had captured to entice Tiamat to the [[Prime Material plane]]. 

Groups of across the [[Western Heartlands]] and [[Sword Coast]]—such as the [[Lords' Alliance]], the [[Harpers]], and even the [[Zhentarim]]—banded together to work against the cult's schemes. Heroes like [[Laeral Silverhand]], [[Connerad Brawnanvil]], King [[Melandrach]], [[Linu La'neral]], [[Fitzhugh Montgomery]],

Despite everyone's efforts, the Cult of the Dragon did manage to finally lure Tiamat from [[Tiamat's Lair|her lair]] in the Nine Hells and summoned her to [[Tiamat's temple|her temple]] within the Well of Dragons. The cult's efforts were thwarted however by a group of adventurers and their allies from the [[Council of Waterdeep]],{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|6}}{{Cite adventurers league/Treasure of the Broken Hoard|5}} with help from the treacherous Red Wizards.{{Cite adventurers league/Thimblerigging|12}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Tales about the Well of Dragons spread across taverns across the Realms. Most people believed them to be mere fanciful stories, with no source of truth to them.

A grand opera, entitled ''[[The Fall of Tiamat]]'', was written and performed following the Dragon Queen's defeat at the Well of Dragons. It was still being performed in [[Waterdeep]] as of [[1492 DR]].

==Inhabitants==
In addition to its own members, the Cult of the Dragon employed a variety of magical creatures to guard the Well of Dragons, including [[guard drake]]s, numerous [[flesh golem|flesh]] and [[stone golem]]s, and at least one [[air elemental]] used to continually sound the ''Draakhorn''.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Arleanda]], an especially academic Wearer of Purple and cleric of the god [[Velsharoon]].
* [[Arsekaslyx]], the "Guardian of the Well", a pseudonatural [[red dragon]] that offered much protection to the cultists at the Well for over a century.
* [[Uthagrimnoshaarl]], the great [[shadow dragon|shadow]] [[wyrm]] that transformed into a dracolich.
