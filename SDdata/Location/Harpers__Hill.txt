'''Harpers' Hill''' was a large, bare hill just east of the village of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]].

==Rumors and Legends==
Most shadowfolk avoided the hill.

==Inhabitants==
While no one lived on the hill itself, folk could often be found in the area. Harpers, such as [[Storm Silverhand]] used the hill for practice and meditation.
