Harpers Hill was a large, bare hill just east of the village of Shadowdale. 
Throughout history, the hill was used as a meeting place for Harpers and elves from the Elven Court. A number of revels were also held on the hill.
Most shadowfolk avoided the hill.
While no one lived on the hill itself, folk could often be found in the area. Harpers, such as Storm Silverhand used the hill for practice and meditation.
