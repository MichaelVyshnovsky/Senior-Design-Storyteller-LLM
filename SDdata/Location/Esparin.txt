Esparin was a kingdom in the Stonelands that was annexed into Cormyr in the 12th century DR after the wedding of Queen Enchara and Cormyrs crown prince, Palaghard.
The kingdom occupied most of the Stonelands, northwest of the early kingdom of Cormyr.
Palaghard was known as the conqueror of Esparin. However, Queen Enchara married Prince Palaghard in the Year of the Prancing Centaur, 1162 DR, and with their union the kingdom was annexed by Cormyr
