'''Graskynar''' ({{Pronounce|Graz|KIN|nar|refs=}}) was an isolationist realm of [[dwarves]] in [[northeast Faerûn]]. It was home to the [[Graskeld]] clan of dwarves.

==Relations==
The Graskyn dwarves were highly isolationist but not hostile to outsiders, being rather contented and self-sufficient. Young, restless dwarves were encouraged to "see the [[Realms]]" and spend their energy with wandering and adventure, which resulted in few returning.

==Geography==
The realm lay deep below the [[Giantspire Mountains]], near [[Narfell]]. It lay within a string of deep [[Underdark]] caverns that included pure, freshwater lakes.

==Trade==
As of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Graskyn farmed their freshwater lakes that they had carefully stocked with fish, harvesting them along with native scuttle-[[crab]]s and blind [[eel]]s. They carefully protected the lakes from natural predators and intelligent water-dwellers, ensuring the security of their food supply. They also mined and worked some [[iron]] that they traded with the nearby [[Nar]].
