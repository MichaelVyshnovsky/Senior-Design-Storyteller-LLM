Graskynar () was an isolationist realm of dwarves in northeast Faer√ªn. It was home to the Graskeld clan of dwarves.
The Graskyn dwarves were highly isolationist but not hostile to outsiders, being rather contented and self-sufficient. Young, restless dwarves were encouraged to "see the Realms" and spend their energy with wandering and adventure, which resulted in few returning.
The realm lay deep below the Giantspire Mountains, near Narfell. It lay within a string of deep Underdark caverns that included pure, freshwater lakes.
As of the 15 century DR, the Graskyn farmed their freshwater lakes that they had carefully stocked with fish, harvesting them along with native scuttle-crabs and blind eels. They carefully protected the lakes from natural predators and intelligent water-dwellers, ensuring the security of their food supply. They also mined and worked some iron that they traded with the nearby Nar.
