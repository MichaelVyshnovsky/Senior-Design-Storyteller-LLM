The '''Mages' Dutychamber''' was a room in [[Castle Obarskyr]].

==Interior==
The room had doors on two ends of the same passage, strongly implying either the passage curved or the doors were on the same wall. The room contained a wall ring to which [[chain]]s could be attached.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1479}}, during the aftermath of the massacre during the [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the [[War Wizard]] [[Surgol Velard]] had the intruder and mask dancer [[Amarune Whitewave]], whom he had incapacitated with a ''[[wand of sleep]]'', moved to the Mages' Dutychamber, where he planned to search her for weapons personally.

While he wondered how to undo her clothes, the Marchioness [[Immerdusk]], [[Storm Silverhand]], listened to the door, and decided, together with her companion [[Mirt]], to stop him; Mirt went to the far door and banged on it, distracting him. While he turned, the Silverhand sister ran into the room and knocked him out cold. She then rescued Amarune Whitewave.
