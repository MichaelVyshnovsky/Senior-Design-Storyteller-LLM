The Wild Yak Meadows formed a large portion of the Katakoro Plateau in the Hordelands.
The Wild Yak Meadows were surrounded by Nor Tso on the east, the Hungtse River to the south, the Muren Tso to the north, and the mountains of Katakoro Shan to the west.
This open section of the tundra stretched for several hundred miles in every direction.
