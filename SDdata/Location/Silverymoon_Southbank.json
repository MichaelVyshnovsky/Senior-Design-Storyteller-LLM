        "Description": "Southbank was the newer of the two main sections of the city, linked to the older [[Northbank]] by the famous magical [[Moonbridge]]. unified as the [[Conclave of Silverymoon]].",
        "History": "Construction of Southbank began in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]] on the shores of the river at the base of the Moonbridge, beginning with military buildings and followed by the first warehouses, inns, and homes in [[1106 DR]]. Southbank expanded from that point afterward. By [[1366 DR]], the new section had its own wall and gate, the New Gate, and the city's West Garrison barracks were near the gate.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], talks had been underway for several years of unifying the magical schools located in Southbank into a single university of magic,",
        "Notable Locations": "The [[Conclave of Silverymoon]] had its Southbank campus here, which included:\n* [[Arkhen's Invocatorium]],\n* The [[Lady's College]],\n* [[Utrumm's Magic Conservatory]], and\n* The [[Vault of the Sages]].\n\nIn addition, the following were places of interest:\n* [[Mielikki's Glade]], a sacred glade to the goddess, and\n* [[Sorlar's Smiling Satyr]], a tavern catering to females."
