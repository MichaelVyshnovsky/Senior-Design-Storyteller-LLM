Irath was a hamlet in the heartlands of Cormyr.
Irath lay south of Waymoot on the Way of the Dragon, beyond the eaves of the Kings Forest.
In 1335 DR, Artus Cimber and his father, the Shadowhawk, accidentally waylaid Prince Azoun IV a few miles north of Irath, ultimately saving him from groundling assassins.
