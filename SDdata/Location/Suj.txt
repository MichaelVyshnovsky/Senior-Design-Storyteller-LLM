Suj was an island in the Trackless Sea and a part of the country of Lantan.
Suj was the southern companion of the island of Lantan, with rocky pinnacles emerging from lush jungles. The Lantanna inhabitants made their aerial homes on these peaks.
Suj was ruled by the Ayrorch, the Council of Twelve based in Sambar, and was protected by the same "secret weapons" as Lantan itself. The dominant faith was that of Gond, led by High Artificer Danactar in Illul. 
Suj was the site of several settlements, and one port city, Anchoril.
