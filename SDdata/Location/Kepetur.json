        "Description": "The tower was built in the form of a massive obelisk.",
        "Geography": "Kepetur was built in a region that was later incorporated into the tharch of [[Pyarados (tharch)|Pyarados]] in eastern [[Thay]].",
        "History": "During the rebellion of the [[Thay]]an people from the [[Mulhorand]]i, sometime during or before he 10{{th}} century [[DR]], the Red Wizards destroyed many and conquered a few of Mulhorand's unique prayer towers.\n\nPriests of [[Anhur]] managed to hold off the Red Wizards at Kepetur for numerous [[tenday]]s, but eventually fell when the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]] appeared in the Realms to join the conflict. The Lord of the Hidden Layer opened a permanent ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Abyss]] at the site of the tower, allowing [[demon]]s to claw their way into the structure. Fortunately for the people residents of Pyarados, the Red Wizards managed to [[magic]]ally seal the obelisk of Kepetur, and prevent the fiends from escaping beyond.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was said that Kepetur housed many Mulhorandi [[relic]]s within its walls, left abandoned when the demon lord threatened the lands."
