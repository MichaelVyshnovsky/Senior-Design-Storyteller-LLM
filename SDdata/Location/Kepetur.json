The Lord of the Hidden Layer opened a permanent gate to the Abyss at the site of the tower, allowing demons to claw their way into the structure. Fortunately for the people residents of Pyarados, the Red Wizards managed to magically seal the obelisk of Kepetur, and prevent the fiends from escaping beyond.\nIt was said that Kepetur housed many Mulhorandi relics within its walls, left abandoned when the demon lord threatened the lands."
