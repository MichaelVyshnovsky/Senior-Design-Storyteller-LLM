        "mainbody": "enshi islands was an island chain located in Kozakura.\nThe Senshi Islands formed a series of diverse islands, ranging in size, extending from Mikedono into the Gulf of Mi. While some of these islands were bare, weathered rocks, continually struck by the ocean waves, the majority hosted vibrant clusters of lush greenery. Additionally, each island offered at least one or two sheltered inlets, providing secure havens for fishing boats to anchor and rest.\nThe islands in the chain were Heike, Ieyaku, Kamine, Mifura, Mishi, Ojo, Senshi, Shimo, Tojuki, Tsune and Uemi.\nThe waters surrounding the Senshi Islands teemed with a multitude of small fishing boats, tirelessly plying their trade. Renowned as one of the finest fishing grounds in Kozakura, the Senshi chain was particularly famed for its expansive oyster beds, from which precious pearls are harvested. Navigating the treacherous currents on the eastern side of the islands was avoided by the boats, while junks wisely steered clear of that perilous area.\nKamine and Tsune were rugged rocky formations devoid of natural water sources. In contrast, the remaining islands featured either natural springs or sufficient rocky catch basins that sustained the growth of plant life. Notably, the island of Senshi boasted dense vegetation, thriving in abundance. Along an eastward-facing shore, a shrine dedicated to one of the oldest sea gods in Kozakura proudly stood, embodying the islands deep connection to the realm of the sea.\nThe islanders predominantly engaged in fishing and pearl diving, with many sea spirit folk actively participating as skilled divers."
