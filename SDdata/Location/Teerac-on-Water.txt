'''Teerac-on-Water''' was a village of [[goblin]]s on a small lake between the [[Stonelands]] and [[Goblin Marches]].

==Description==
Teerac-on-Water consisted of a dense cluster of wooden buildings that spread out over the water, joined by numerous boats and barges. The goblins revered a powerful [[shaman]] who oversaw the construction of the wooden structures and boats.

[[Fish]] were harpooned from the lake, and fruits and vegetables were harvested from the shores of the lake, giving the goblins a far more varied diet than usual.

==Geography==
The village sat on a small island in the middle of a lake, which itself sat inside a crater located on the edge of the Stonelands and Goblin Marches.

==Defenses==
The village was extremely defensible despite being out in the open, as the Teerac's boats were the only way to traverse the water, and it was guarded by tamed [[giant frog]]s. Tunnels beneath the island led to the discovery of the [[Underdark]], as well as subterranean [[bugbear]]s who allied with the village.
