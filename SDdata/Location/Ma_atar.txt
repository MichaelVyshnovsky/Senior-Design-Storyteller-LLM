'''Ma'atar''' was an artificially created, [[Zhentarim]]-controlled oasis located in the [[Anauroch]] desert. 

==Description==
Ma'atar housed a number of stone structures that served as fortified barracks, beneath which were tunnels that stored an arsenal of supplies, weapons, and [[magic]]al armaments.

It was said to be a bountiful oasis that was rich with vegetation including nut-producing trees, and its underground tunnels harbored a small [[mushroom]] farm containing fine [[frill-collar mushroom|frill-collars]] that were used for Zhent [[alchemy]].

==Geography==
The isolated outpost was located on the western stretch of [[the Sword]], west of the [[Wall of Fallen Djinn]] mountains, possibly along the [[Black Road]].{{Speculation}}

==Defenses==
It was protected by a stone wall that was manned by [[Zhentilar]] soldiers.

==Inhabitants==
As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the settlement had a meager contingent of sixteen Zhentilar troops, served by three [[priests]] and led by a sole [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]].

The Zhentarim collected a large reserve of [[weapon]]s and skeletons in the garrison of Ma'atar, the latter of which were [[Animate dead|animated]] into a small horde of [[undead]] to serve under their command.
