        "mainbody": "The '''fish market''' of [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], was a marketplace where the city's residents shopped for daily meals.",
        "Location": "The marketplace was located in the city's [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] on the border with the [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]]. It sat between the feet of the Market Ward's two main hills: to the north of [[Yklwazi Hill]] and to the southwest of [[Mount Sibasa]].",
        "Services": "[[File:PN fishmonger MMO.PNG|thumb|''A Port Nyanzaru fishmonger.'']]\nThe market was the premier place to buy daily fresh catches of [[fish]] and [[seafood]] in Port Nyanzaru.\n\nThe selection was always better earlier in the day before it was picked over by customers, thus the highest quality (and most expensive) fish were sold in the mornings.",
        "History": "Fish and seafood were dietary staples in Port Nyanzaru, not only because fish was more appetizing than [[dinosaur]], but because fishing was generally safer than hunting in the Chultan jungles. Furthermore, fishing in the [[Bay of Chult]] was safer than venturing up the [[River Soshenstar|Soshenstar]] or [[River Tiryki|Tiryki]] rivers, so saltwater fish were more common at the market."
