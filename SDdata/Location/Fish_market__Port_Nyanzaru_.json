        "mainbody": "The fish market of Port Nyanzaru, Chult, was a marketplace where the citys residents shopped for daily meals. \nThe marketplace was located in the citys Market Ward on the border with the Harbor Ward. It sat between the feet of the Market Wards two main hills to the north of Yklwazi Hill and to the southwest of Mount Sibasa.\nthumb|A Port Nyanzaru fishmonger.\nThe market was the premier place to buy daily fresh catches of fish and seafood in Port Nyanzaru.\nThe selection was always better earlier in the day before it was picked over by customers, thus the highest quality (and most expensive) fish were sold in the mornings.\nFish and seafood were dietary staples in Port Nyanzaru, not only because fish was more appetizing than dinosaur, but because fishing was generally safer than hunting in the Chultan jungles. Furthermore, fishing in the Bay of Chult was safer than venturing up the Soshenstar or Tiryki rivers, so saltwater fish were more common at the market."
