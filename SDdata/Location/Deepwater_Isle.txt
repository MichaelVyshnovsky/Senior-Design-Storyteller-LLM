Deepwater Isle, occasionally known as Deepwatch Isle, was a fortified island in the Sea of Swords off the Sword Coast North.
This island was located east of Stormhaven Island and directly south of the city of Waterdeep, Deepwater Beacon, Umberlees Cache, and the undersea hamlet of TQuession.
Deepwater was the largest in a ring of islands that enclosed and protected Deepwater Harbor. Part of the heavily fortified Deepwater Wall ran along the islands ridge.
Underneath the island were flooded caverns.
Every year on Ches 30, the second day of the Fair Seas Festival, clerics from all the temples in Waterdeep and members of the citys sea-related guilds traveled to Deepwater Isle and spent the day on it fasting and praying.
The islands fortifications were manned by the City Navy of Waterdeep. The flooded caverns of the island were garrisoned by a rotating force of sixty willing merfolk, sent from southern waters ever since -458 DR. In the , an influx of mermaid refugees from Laakos Reef bolstered the garrisons ranks and transformed it into the village of Tharqualnaar.
