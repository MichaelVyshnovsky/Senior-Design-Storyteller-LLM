        "mainbody": "Songfarla was an ancient and hidden rock gnome realm located in the eastern spur of the Sunrise Mountains.\nSongfarla was located in the eastern Sunrise Mountains at the source of the most northwestern tributary of the River Murghol, which was approximately equidistant from the ruins of Delhumide and the Lake of Mists.\nTo maintain their hidden existence, the gnomes of Songfarla traded their goods quietly, utilizing merchants who claimed no affiliation with any realm. These merchants operated in Almorel, Murghyr, and Duirtanal for things that the gnomes could not make themselvesâ€”they were otherwise completely self-sufficient.\nSongfarlas greatest defense was its anonymity. Not even the Thayan Zulkir of Divination knew of its existence. Practically all passages into and around Songfarla were hidden by powerful illusion magic.\nA settlement in the Sunrise Mountains was founded by escaped slaves from Netheril. In , it became the kingdom of Songfarla when its population exploded with an influx of more refugees.\nThe kingdom was later caught up in the wars between Raumathar and Narfell, when conjured demons attacked in . Afterwards, the gnomes cloaked their realm in illusions to avoid future detection and attack.\nIn the , the population of Songfarla was dwindling until four svirfneblin clans migrated there, the Covarrkar, Fungusfoot, Glasszhorm, and Longstepper clans.\nGnomish tales tell of the purchase of Songfarlas lands for a massive piece of fools gold, though whom the lands were bought from and even if it was fools gold that was used (another common tale says gilded granite) could change with the teller.\nThe Gilded Nugget was a vast cavern within the mountains located in the thickest part of a massive gold vein that was somehow naturally studded with gemstones. The Nugget was a center of both government and worship (it was considered one of Garl Glittergolds greatest temples) as well as a community hub for other activities, including commerce and the arts."
