The '''Force Bridge''' connected the main quarters of [[Zhentil Keep]] with the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] on the southern shore of the [[River Tesh]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The bridge crossed the River Tesh where it merged with the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]], connecting the western sections of the [[Zhentil Keep/Harbor District|Harbor District]] and [[Zhentil Keep/Common Quarter|Common Quarter]] with the Foreign Quarter.

==Description==
Two main gates, the [[North Force Gate]] and [[South Force Gate]], sat at either end of the bridge. Each gate was flanked by a pair of guard towers manned by [[Zhentilar]] soldiers.

A large [[iron]] gate, which was protected from rust by [[magic]], was situated beneath the Force Bridge and dropped into the River Tesh to block ship traffic in both directions. The gate was open for eight hours per day, allowing the [[Zhents]] to control traffic.

==History==
[[File:ForceBridge.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''The Force Bridge under reconstruction.'']]
The Force Bridge was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, during the assault on the city by the forces of [[Cyric]] during the [[Fall of Zhentil Keep]]. The bridge was blown up by [[orc]] forces resentful of their treatment by the Zhentilar as they retreated into the Foreign Quarter.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Church of Gond|Gondsmen]] were contracted by Lord [[Orgauth]] to rebuild the section of the Force Bridge that controlled the iron gate, which would allow him to regain control of river traffic. The Gondsmen's efforts were stymied several months later by attacks from the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].
