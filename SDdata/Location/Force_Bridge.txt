The Force Bridge connected the main quarters of Zhentil Keep with the Foreign Quarter on the southern shore of the River Tesh during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The bridge crossed the River Tesh where it merged with the Moonsea, connecting the western sections of the Harbor District and Common Quarter with the Foreign Quarter.
Two main gates, the North Force Gate and South Force Gate, sat at either end of the bridge. Each gate was flanked by a pair of guard towers manned by Zhentilar soldiers.
A large iron gate, which was protected from rust by magic, was situated beneath the Force Bridge and dropped into the River Tesh to block ship traffic in both directions. The gate was open for eight hours per day, allowing the Zhents to control traffic.

The Force Bridge was destroyed in the , during the assault on the city by the forces of Cyric during the Fall of Zhentil Keep. The bridge was blown up by orc forces resentful of their treatment by the Zhentilar as they retreated into the Foreign Quarter.
In the , Gondsmen were contracted by Lord Orgauth to rebuild the section of the Force Bridge that controlled the iron gate, which would allow him to regain control of river traffic. The Gondsmens efforts were stymied several months later by attacks from the Knights of Myth Drannor.
