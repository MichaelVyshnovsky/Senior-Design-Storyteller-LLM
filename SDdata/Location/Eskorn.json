        "mainbody": "'''Eskorn''', also known as the '''Wild Dragon Realm''', was a [[human]] kingdom located in eastern [[Laerakond]].",
        "Background": "The realm was known as the Wild Dragon Realm not for its draconic past but for the [[Clan Wilddragon|Wilddragons]], one of its former ruling families. Eskorn was considered a backwater realm pretending to be a kingdom by the rest of the nations of Laerakond.",
        "Inhabitants": "Although the former [[dragon]] lords of Eskorn had slaves from many humanoid races, after Eskorn was freed members of the demihuman races went to other lands, and Eskorn became a land inhabited mostly by humans.",
        "Government": "The royal dynasty (as of [[1479 DR]]) barely enforced the laws of the region, moving from one settlement to the next and the law of the land moved with them. The capital of [[Stormhelm]] was a small city on the [[Dragon Sea (Abeir)|Dragon Sea]] rife with political intrigue and backstabbing.",
        "Geography": {
            "Locations": "* '''[[Argul]]''': The ruined castle that once served as the lair of a gigantic dragon named [[Argularragh]].\n* '''[[Belprin's Hold]]''': A small keep of forgotten human origin.\n* '''[[Dawn Titan's Spire]]''': The home of a mysterious [[primordial]] who was not defeated by dragons, but that retired from the world nonetheless.\n* '''[[Firetrees (Laerakond)|Firetrees]]''': An ancient fortress-prison once managed by the evil dragon [[Raurokhymdhar]].\n* '''[[Hargleth Forest]]''': A forest in eastern Eskorn, dotted with ancient ruins.\n* '''[[Ironhar]]''': The largest royal keep as of 1479 DR.\n* '''[[Mistshaws]]''': A royal keep known for its bards and artists, and for its lawlessness as well.\n* '''[[Nornglast]]''': The smallest royal keep as of 1479 DR, and the headquarters of the [[Eminence of Araunt]].\n* '''[[Oroth]]''': Also known as the Hollow Mountain, this large but low, collapsed volcanic peak was overgrown with thick forest.\n* '''[[Rondeval (town)|Rondeval]]''': A small trade-moot named for a legendary [[Rondeval|stage performer]].\n* '''[[Savanfast]]''': An ancient and ruined [[dwarven]] outpost.\n* '''Stormhelm''': The capital and only city of Eskorn."

        "History": "Originally an empire dominated by a dragon named [[Eskornamundyr]], Eskorn became a human kingdom after a successful rebellion led by the legendary warrior [[Aunglass Roaryl]], that happened several centuries before the [[Spellplague]]. This battle became known as the \"Deliverance\". The [[dragonborn]] who helped the rebels to win their freedom left Eskorn not long after to [[Dragonborn rebellion|help their kin]] in [[Skelkor]], and Eskorn became a human-dominated land.\n\nSince the Deliverance, five human dynasties ruled Eskorn, and four ended violently. Among the most famous of those dynasties was the Wilddragon dynasty. The ruling dynasty as of 1479 DR was the [[Clan Roaryl|Roaryl]] dynasty.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Eskornamundyr]], the former dragon emperor.\n* [[Aunglass Roaryl]], a legendary hero.\n* [[Ornan Roaryl]], king of Eskorn as of 1479 DR.\n* [[Amaunthur Sardron]], king Ornan's life-long rival.",
        "Notable organizations": "* The [[Eminence of Araunt]], an [[undead]] kingdom of sorts whose citizens across Laerakond and [[Faer√ªn]] were linked not by geography, but by a common ideal.\n* The [[Storm Rune]], a cabal of a dozen or so wealthy merchants and landlords who dominated Eskornar trade.",
        "Trivia": "The popular [[abeir]]an jam known as [[tharrum]] was originally from Eskorn."
