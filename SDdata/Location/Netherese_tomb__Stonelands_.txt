A Netherese tomb in the Stonelands was the site of conflict in the late 15 century DR.
The tomb was located in a dry, dusty region of the Stonelands. It was connected to an extensive cave network that went deep underground to the Underdark, linking to Daeronnaxs lair and a small drow outpost.
The area around the tomb was inhabited by harpies, lizardfolk, and scorpions. Deeper in the caves around the tomb lived sand mephits, bats, umber hulks, more lizardfolk, and the kobolds of Clan Daeronnax.
The tomb itself was home to the mummy Laeron, and a number of loyal tomb guardians, skeleton warriors, quells, and wheeps.
During the 1480s DR, the tomb was invaded by the adventurers Popkin Shortshanks, Jarull Cartcoster, Liantor Stoneborn, Helayna, Kirina Aelorothi, and Tristran of Daggerford. They smashed a few undead and then passed through the secret passage behind Laerons throne into the deeper caves, where they were ambushed and defeated by Clan Daeronnax kobolds. Popkin escaped and sought aid, sending a second team of adventurers to rescue her friends. By the time the reinforcements arrived, Laeron and more guardians had roused to defend the tomb, only to be smashed down again.
