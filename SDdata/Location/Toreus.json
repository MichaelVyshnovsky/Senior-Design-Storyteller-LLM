        "Trade": "This city was known for its assertive business strategies, and went as far as trading with marauding pirates and criminals. The other cities in the region disdained such tactics, as Toreus appeared to openly defy the laws of Chessenta; even a [[Red Wizard]] [[Thayan enclave|enclave]] was allowed to operate within.",
        "History": "Though Toreus started out as a lone garrison for [[Mordulkin]] soldiers, it grew into the third biggest city of the confederation of Chessenta in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The inhabitants of this settlement were somewhat diverse, as Toreus allowed in and even welcomed those from the most despised nations across [[Toril]]."
