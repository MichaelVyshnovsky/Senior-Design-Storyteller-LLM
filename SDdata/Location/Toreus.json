        "mainbody": "Garrison\nToreus was a garrison turned trading city in Chessenta.\nThis city was known for its assertive business strategies, and went as far as trading with marauding pirates and criminals. The other cities in the region disdained such tactics, as Toreus appeared to openly defy the laws of Chessenta even a Red Wizard enclave was allowed to operate within.\nThough Toreus started out as a lone garrison for Mordulkin soldiers, it grew into the third biggest city of the confederation of Chessenta in the 15 century DR.\nThe inhabitants of this settlement were somewhat diverse, as Toreus allowed in and even welcomed those from the most despised nations across Toril."
