        "mainbody": "Despite its name, the '''Temple District''' of [[Athkatla]] was home to many of the city's businesses and the manors of some of its wealthier citizens. While it was previously home to a number of churches and temples, they were mainly destroyed in fires that raged through the district in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nA number of the district's streets still had names that reflected its divine history, such as the [[Street of Seven Altars]] and [[Godsmoot]].\n\nThe district was the northernmost section of Athkatla, connected to a number of wards on the northern bank of the [[Alandor River]].",
        "Society": "Social status was extremely important to the residents of the temple district. They would often gossip to one-another about their neighbors' comings and goings, scrutinizing any changes in their wealth and status.",
        "Description": "The district was fairly plain and average in appearance, lacking the magnificent estates of say the [[Scepter District (Athkatla)|Scepter District]], the ostentatious designs found in the [[Gem District (Athkatla)|Gem District]], or famous landmarks such as [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the [[Center District (Athkatla)|Center District]]. \n\nMany of the buildings in the district were refurbished abbeys and holy houses, remnants from the time before the fires in northern Athkatla. Several homes and mansions possessed the stately columns and other architectural features that were more common among temples.",
        "History": "During the years when Athkatla was the hub of [[arcane]] power within the nation of [[Amn]], the temple district was home to grand temples of [[Azuth]] and [[Mystra]], houses of mages, and even a [[magic]]al academy.\n\nIn [[1266 DR]], a horde of [[tanar'ri]] [[demon]]s were released from another arcane school in eastern [[Amn]] called the [[School of Wonder]] and went on a rampage through the country of Amn. In response, King [[Dhanar Parhek]] outlawed [[arcane]] [[magic]] and [[wizard]]ry, declaring them an act against the monarchy. In [[1267 DR]], the temples to the arcane gods, the mages' houses, and the urban academy were set ablaze and the fire spread to other buildings in the portion of the city north of the [[Alandor River]]. The city fell to anarchy.\n\nIn the chaos, various wealthy and influential rival families struck out against one another, acting on old feuds and rivalries. Several houses attacked churches that were sponsored by rival Athkatlan families, causing even more temples to be destroyed. The death and destruction led to the royally-decreed exile of several families including three powerful noble houses, which in turn led to the eventual assassination of King Dhanar in [[1276 DR]] and the destruction of Amn's monarchy as a whole.\n\nThe district's name, along with those of its streets, were kept as a constant reminder that the deities of [[Faer√ªn]] should be revered over the daily affairs of mortals.",
