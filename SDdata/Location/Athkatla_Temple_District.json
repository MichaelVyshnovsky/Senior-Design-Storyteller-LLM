        "mainbody": "espite its name, the Temple District of Athkatla was home to many of the citys businesses and the manors of some of its wealthier citizens. While it was previously home to a number of churches and temples, they were mainly destroyed in fires that raged through the district in the late 13 century DR.\nA number of the districts streets still had names that reflected its divine history, such as the Street of Seven Altars and Godsmoot.\nThe district was the northernmost section of Athkatla, connected to a number of wards on the northern bank of the Alandor River.\nSocial status was extremely important to the residents of the temple district. They would often gossip to one-another about their neighbors comings and goings, scrutinizing any changes in their wealth and status.\nThe district was fairly plain and average in appearance, lacking the magnificent estates of say the Scepter District, the ostentatious designs found in the Gem District, or famous landmarks such as Waukeens Promenade in the Center District. \nMany of the buildings in the district were refurbished abbeys and holy houses, remnants from the time before the fires in northern Athkatla. Several homes and mansions possessed the stately columns and other architectural features that were more common among temples.\nDuring the years when Athkatla was the hub of arcane power within the nation of Amn, the temple district was home to grand temples of Azuth and Mystra, houses of mages, and even a magical academy.\nIn 1266 DR, a horde of tanarri demons were released from another arcane school in eastern Amn called the School of Wonder and went on a rampage through the country of Amn. In response, King Dhanar Parhek outlawed arcane magic and wizardry, declaring them an act against the monarchy. In 1267 DR, the temples to the arcane gods, the mages houses, and the urban academy were set ablaze and the fire spread to other buildings in the portion of the city north of the Alandor River. The city fell to anarchy.\nIn the chaos, various wealthy and influential rival families struck out against one another, acting on old feuds and rivalries. Several houses attacked churches that were sponsored by rival Athkatlan families, causing even more temples to be destroyed. The death and destruction led to the royally-decreed exile of several families including three powerful noble houses, which in turn led to the eventual assassination of King Dhanar in 1276 DR and the destruction of Amns monarchy as a whole.\nThe districts name, along with those of its streets, were kept as a constant reminder that the deities of Faer√ªn should be revered over the daily affairs of mortals.\n*Crown Aflame This grand theater was housed in an exquisite and stately building that was once a temple of Azuth.\n*Harfin Draether \n*High Hall of the Radiant Heart\n*Seven Songs Importing\n*Society of the Lost Ingot\n*House of Klarynda Bellasdreia\n*House of Isker Lhavanas\n*House of Marimmal Theer\n*House of Thammas Thoul\n*Pride of Athkatla \n*Silkstone Fashions\n*Temple Bell\n*Temple of Helm\n*Temple of Lathander\n*Temple of Talos"
