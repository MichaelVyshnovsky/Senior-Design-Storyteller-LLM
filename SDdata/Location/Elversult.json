        "mainbody": "'''Elversult''' ({{Pronounce|EL|ver|suhlt|refs=}}) was a rich community found in the [[Dragon Coast]] region of [[Faerûn]]. It was an important trading and mercantile center that facilitated both honest and illegitimate trade across the [[Eastern Heartlands]] and beyond.\n\nBeyond its reputation as a great trade city and hotspot of the latest trends, Elversult was known across nearly all of Faerûn as the birthplace of the renewed [[church of Amaunator]] and the god's second sun that shone bright in the skies above.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Elversult was founded at the confluence of a number of freshwater ponds that were set between rolling hills and forested ridges. A rocky tor known as [[Temple Hill]] in the center of Elversult overlooked the city environs, which lacking walls sprawled beyond the woodlands. The hill was named for the pair of holy houses that sat atop its apex, which were dedicated to the deities of [[Waukeen]] and [[Lathander]].\n\nThe combination of Elversult being a relatively new, as of the [[Era of Upheaval]], and having enjoyed strong leadership throughout its history, lead to the preservation of the wooded glades and knolls which were scattered through the city."

        "Government": {
            "Relationships": "Throughout its history, Elversult has had regular conflicts with the coastal city of [[Westgate]], often receiving aid from the noble kingdom of [[Cormyr]] to the northeast. Foreign nations from the [[Unapproachable East]] such as [[Impiltur]] and even [[Thay]] were known to have spies operating within the city's borders.\n\nInhabitants of [[Calimshan]] often called Elversians as ''Elversultians'', which was considered an insult.{{Cite polyhedron/74/The Everwinking Eye: Words To The Wise}}"
        },
        "Trade": "[[Image:Elversult.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Map of the area around Elversult in [[1372 DR]]]]\nFrom its central location at the crossroads between a number of important mercantile destinations, Elversult dominated overland trade in the region. In addition to its importance in legitimate trade in the region, the city was a haven for smugglers and others looking to move products that were not entirely legal in the Heartlands.\n\nAlthough not a port itself, the city kept its warehouses full of trade goods that went as far away as Cormyr and the Sword Coast. Plenty of caravan paddocks and stockyards could be found on the outskirts of the city.",
        "Society": "The bustling city was a melting pot for cultures from across half of [[Faerûn]], a place where travelers could readily get a read on the latest trends in trade, fads in fashion, or other current goings-on. \n\nWhile  Elversian leaders did their best to maintain the city's reputation as one of honest trade and one that was worthy of respect, its more nefarious citizens did all they could to make this task as difficult as possible.\n\nThe upper classes tended to live to the north, or the west  of Temple Hill, around the 'Ladytower's Lands' that surrounded the \"Ladytowers\", or [[Moonstorm House]]. The poorer areas and warehouses tended to be found in the southern and eastern parts of the city.",
        "Defenses": "Elversult boasted a strong military force of some 3,500 warriors known as [[the Maces]]. They acted as both a local law enforcement and the city guard that protected Elversians from exterior threats. They patrolled the city in five-man units, ready to rapidly call down reinforcements if a strong-enough threat presented itself.",
        "History": "The [[Cult of the Dragon]] established a cell within the city in the {{YearlinkName|1225}}, and allied themselves with the [[black dragon]] [[Hethcypressarvil]]. The cultists were known to run the city's black market of foreign [[spice]]s, along with illicit [[drug]]s and [[poison]]s.\n\nThe ''[[Book of Fangs and Talons]]'' appeared in Elversult in the {{YearlinkName|1298}}, when a group of [[Malar]]ites began using the city as a base for their operations in nearby lands.\n\nElversult suffered great destruction at the hands of the Dracolich Hethcypressarvil, in the {{YearlinkName|1364}}. The [[undead]] dragon was briefly defeated by the Maces with the aid of the Harper [[sorceress]] [[Ruha]], and its remains were submerged beneath the small lake near Temple Hill.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the Elversian embassy of the [[Shou Lung]] empire was suddenly destroyed. A [[scroll]] was later recovered from the rubble that bore the seal of the first emperor, [[Ra-Khati]].\n\n[[1374 DR|One year later]], during the month of [[Mirtul]], [[Sunlord]] [[Daelegoth Orndeir]] beseeched [[Amaunator]] for a ''[[miracle]]'' to cease the draughts that plagued much of the Realms. In the following days Elversult received tremendous amounts of rainfall and beauteous weather that followed. On the day of [[Midsummer]] he called for his fellow faithful to take witness to Amaunator's glory and ''[[Amaunator's eternal sun|summoned forth a second sun]]'' that ascended over the city and provided illumination to the city at all hours of the day.",
