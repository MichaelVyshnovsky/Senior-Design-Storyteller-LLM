}}The '''Sands of Itzcala''' was a massive desert in northern [[Maztica]].

==Geography==
The Sands of Itzcala covered most of northern Maztica. Directly south of it were the nations of [[Kultaka]], [[Huacli]], and the [[Valley of Nexal]]. It stretched from the eastern coast to the western coast, and northwest of it was the [[Pasocada Basin]].

;Olbi
: The ruined city of [[Olbi]] was older than even [[Tewahca]]. It was not as spectacular, but possessed secrets all its own. Olbi consisted of a series of clean, well-carved caverns with a variety of statues carved directly into the walls (representing the [[Maztican pantheon]]). The precision of the carvings showed evidence of metal tools or magical shaping, and treasures such as works of [[pluma]], [[hishna]], and [[gold]] could be found there.

==Inhabitants==
The Sands of Itzcala was a harsh land, inhabited only by the [[Dog People]], who lived a semi-nomadic existence in small tribes. They understood their land better than anyone else, and relied on it for protection against foreign enemies.
