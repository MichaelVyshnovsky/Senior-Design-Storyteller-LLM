        "mainbody": "Raskuldin () was a small realm of dwarves in the Shining Lands of southeast Faerûn. It was home to the Darraskh clan.\nThe realm lay beneath the Dustwall Mountains near Durpar.\nAs of the 15 century DR, Raskuldin performed a great many expeditions into the Underdark to hunt, slay, and capture various monsters. In particular, they used captured deepspawn to \"farm\" livestock, especially rothé that made excellent roasts.\nThe realm was founded by the famous clanless adventurer Raskuldra \"Axehair\"."
