It was built on a steep-sided ridge among tall oak trees. The dwellings were said to be constructed in the trees themselves among the hollows and branches.\nIn the Year of the Curse, 882 DR, Eaerlann fell as a result of the fall of Hellgate Keep to demons and this city was abandoned. However, followers of Mielikki, druids, took refuge in a fraction of the city and secured it against orcs and demons. Later, the settlement was known as Tall Trees and the inhabitants were the Druids of Tall Trees."
