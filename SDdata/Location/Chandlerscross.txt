'''Chandlerscross''' was a clean, fresh-looking town in [[Scardale]] located on the [[River Ashaba]] within the great canyon called the [[Scar]].  This town rose to prominence, and even served as its capital city, during the occupation of the dale by a coalition of foreign forces during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
While in [[1356 DR]] the town was barely noticeable, by the late 1360s it had become a bustling center of trade, having evaded the chaos and destruction that was rampant in [[Scardale Town]]. Following that settlement's devastation during the [[Shaking Plague]] in [[1370 DR]], Chandlerscross was designated as the capital of Scardale.

Throughout the 1400s [[DR]], [[Sembia]]n merchants consolidated the nation's power over Scardale through a series of underhanded deals and betrayals. These actions culminated with Sembia's mercenary army marching on Chandlerscross and slaughtering many dalesfolk in the {{YearlinkName|1421}}. After their bloody coup, the merchant nation re-established Scardale Town as the capital of the dale.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Forever|52}}

==Government==
During the town's tenure as the capital of Scardale, Chandlerscross served as home to both the [[Provisional Governor]], the inaugural incumbent of which was [[Khelvos Dermmen]], and the [[Scardale Council]].

The city watch was composed entirely of Scardalefolk, a point of pride for the dale after years of foreign occupation.
