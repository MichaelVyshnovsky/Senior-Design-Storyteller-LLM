        "mainbody": "'''Glaur''', known to its inhabitants as the '''Dominions of Nehu''', was an ancient fortress built by the [[primordial]] [[Nehushta]] during the [[Dawn War]].{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}} It was located in northern [[Gontal]], in the center of the [[Glaur Barrens]].{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|51}}",
        "Description": {
            "Brindol's Cut": "Named for the leader of the surviving [[genasi]] of Glaur, [[Brindol]], this miles-long fissure divided Glaur's ruins into two separate regions. The sheer canyon walls that composed the fissure opened onto many tunnels and corridors that were once buried basements of the fortress, most of them reaching way down to the Underdark. The southwestern portion of Brindol's Cut was the territory of the [[Dominion of the Burned]] faction.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|84}} The [[Birthing Furnace]], a powerful [[artifact]] crafted by Nehushta, was located somewhere in this area.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|79}}",
            "Glittering Wall": "The Glittering Wall was what remained of the original walls that surrounded Glaur. With the appearance of a many-faceted mirror several hundred feet high and nearly a mile thick, the Glittering Wall was one of the few features of Glaur that survived both the [[War of Fang and Talon]] and the Spellplague nearly intact. Some believed that inside its many chambers were located hidden primordial artifacts and a living remnant of Nehushta herself.",
            "Hob's Cut": "A smaller fissure that extended out of the fortress core to the southeast of the Glaur Barrens. Like the larger Brindol's Cut, the fissure provided access to several corridors and tunnels. Thousands of tiny firefly-like insects lived in one of those chambers, and usually swarmed at night on anything nearby to feed on it. Survivors of those attacks were sometimes infected by a strange pestilence known as [[glow fever]].",
            "Quicksilver Lake": "A lake made of a silvery substance. Though it wasn't poisonous, some quality of the water made sentient creatures fall into a deep depression they couldn't recover from, until finally they gave up on life. Some believed the lake was made up of the tears Nehushta wept when she was killed by the traitorous [[dragon]]s.",
            "Rusted Sands": "The Rusted Sands were a desert area made of rusted, blood-colored [[iron]]. Those who explored this area and were able to leave its borders believed the area had a sentient force that drew things to the center of the Rusted Sands and never released them again.",
            "Storm Spire": "This milk-white spire, nearly a thousand feet wide at its base, reached the sky but its absolute height remained forever obscured by a lightning-lit thundercloud that never dissipated. The Storm Spire was one of the few portions of the original fortress that survived the Spellplague. Composed of white opaque crystal capable of [[magic]]al self-repair, the spire drew a supernatural storm and channeled the electricity into the earth, radiating the area out and down for several miles. The Storm Spire was somehow related to the creation and the propagation of the [[anaxim]]s, and people called the surrounding area the \"Dominion of the Mindless\".{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|81}}",
            "Sapphire Vortex": "The Sapphire Vortex was a deadly plagueland dominated by a fiery blue vortex that spun ceaselessly in the sky. The territory under the vortex was known as the [[Dominion of Bone]]. The Spellplague was particularly strong in this area, and [[spellscar]]s produced by the vortex were more powerful than those earned in other plaguelands.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|83}}"
        },
        "History": "Before the separation of [[Abeir-Toril]], the fortress of Glaur was erected by Nehushta to serve as a central front during the Dawn War. After the primordials were defeated and [[Ao]] split Abeir-Toril into the twin worlds of Abeir and [[Toril]], Glaur was transported to the world of Abeir. Nehushta isolated herself in her fortress until the War of Fang and Talon, when she was killed by traitorous dragons. However, both dragons and [[humanoids]] avoided the abandoned fortress out of fear for thousands of years after the war.\n\nIn [[1385 DR]], under the pretense of opening new trade routes, Prince [[Nathur Hethkantan]] led an ill-fated expedition to the fortress in order to search for any remains or lost treasures of Nehushta, in hopes of being able to revive her or, if it proved impossible to revive a primordial, at least to have a holy object to properly revere her.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|82}} However, the Spellplague happened shortly after and when the blue fires reached the world of Abeir and made contact with Glaur, the fortress exploded in a cataclysm as potent as the [[Tearfall]], that rocked the continent of [[Laerakond]] and sent it to the world of Toril and created the Glaur Barrens.\n\nThe ruins of Glaur became a strange plagueland that was inhabited by the survivors of the cataclysm, including a plaguechanged prince Nathur, who became the ruler of the area below the Sapphire Vortex. In time, the land became known as the Dominions of Nehu by its inhabitants.\n\nIn [[1469 DR]], an invasion of anaxims destroyed a genasi community who lived in the ruins. A [[firesoul genasi]] named Brindol unified the few genasi who survived the anaxim invasion, and under his leadership they were able to conquer a small section of the ruins known as the Dominion of the Burned.\n\nAs of [[1479 DR]], only a few individuals in all Laerakond knew anything significant about the history or geography of Glaur. Among them was the notorious Gontese guide and explorer, [[Larrana Vestel]].",
        "Inhabitants": "As of 1479 DR, the ruins of Glaur were inhabited mostly by the anaxims. A community of a few firesoul genasi lived in the Dominion of the Burned, while Prince Nathur and his [[undead]] servants lived in the area known as the Dominion of Bone."
