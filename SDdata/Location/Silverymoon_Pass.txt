The Silverymoon Pass separated the two sections of the western end of the Nether Mountains.
The road from Silverymoon to Sundabar passed through the Silverymoon Pass.
The pass was a narrow and deep valley of jagged rocks and dark bramble bush. In the shadow of the highest peaks, heaps of snow laid all the year on the southern side. The road was often closed for threatening avalanches during the winter. Patrols from Silverymoon and Sundabar regularly walked across this road.
Khelb A village near the western end of the pass.
Hawks Nest The watchtower located near the top of the Silverymoon Pass.
