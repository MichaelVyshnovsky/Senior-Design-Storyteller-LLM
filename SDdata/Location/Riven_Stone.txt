The Riven Stone was a landmark in Faer√ªn.
The landmark was an immense pitch-black helm-like conical stone, cloven down the middle, through which the road went.
The Riven Stone was down a road from Anthathers Mill, in the midst of a forest.
In the , Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, sought out the Riven Stone as part of a quest commanded by the goddess Mystra. There, he met Dasumia, whom he was commanded by the goddess to serve.
Curiously, people around the stone remarked on how there was nothing there but a stone, though Elminster remarked someone would probably say it was haunted.
