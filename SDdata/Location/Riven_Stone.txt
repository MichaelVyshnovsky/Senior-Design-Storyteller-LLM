The '''Riven Stone''' was a landmark in [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
The landmark was an immense pitch-black helm-like conical stone, cloven down the middle, through which the road went.

==Geography==
The Riven Stone was down a road from [[Anthather's Mill]], in the midst of a forest.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, [[Elminster Aumar]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], sought out the Riven Stone as part of a quest commanded by the goddess [[Mystra]]. There, he met [[Dasumia]], whom he was commanded by the goddess to serve.

==Rumors & Legends==
Curiously, people around the stone remarked on how there was nothing there but a stone, though Elminster remarked someone would probably say it was haunted.
