Lundeth was a village made up of sun-fire clay huts in the desert of Anauroch.
This village scaled the steep sides of a rock [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacle_(geology) pinnacle] surrounded by the Salt Flats and had a deep water well. It was a days ride away from the southwestern edge of the Sword.
This village was once founded and inhabited by a Bedine tribe named the Goldor. 
From then on, Zhent caravans in Anauroch would often try to find their way to this village when they ran into trouble.
Eventually, after many years, once the Black Road was completed the Zhentarim abandoned this village.

Around the 1360s DR, the inhabitants of this village were made up of members of the Zhentarim and the undead remains of the Goldor tribe. The latter numbered around twenty minor magelings and underpriests.
After the construction of the Black Road was finished, the Zhentarim members stationed in Lundeth left. All that remained within the village were those undead remnants of the Goldor.
