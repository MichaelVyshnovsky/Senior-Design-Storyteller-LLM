        "mainbody": "Sharpstone Keep was a large fortress located somewhere near Waterdeep.\nThe fortress was opulent in its heyday. It was also massive, arguably too large for any one bandit group to control on its own. As of the late 15 century DR, bandit groups had carved out ruts for their carts into the stone floor, and homages to Gruumsh were etched into the walls. Following the arrival of giants, some corridors were widened to accommodate them.\nSharpstone Keep was constructed with wealth gained from operations at Frostsilver Mines.\nIn the late 15 century DR, bandits from the Burntbone Horde used the Keep as a camp from which to terrorize the roads between the Keep, the Frostsilver Mines, and Waterdeep. In response to a group of the Hordes goblin and kobold bandits attacking travelers on the road to Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand employed adventurers, who chased them back to Sharpstone Keep and slew their leader, an ogre known as Vargor the Fierce. However, this was not sufficient to end the attacks between the Keep and the Mines, and Laeral concluded that the Hordes aggression was likely associated with conflicts among the giants in the North. Sure enough, when her adventurers returned to Sharpstone Keep, they discovered that a fire giant named Harkald Firesworn had declared himself king of the place, and had brought ogres and orcs with him. After the adventurers slew him, the Burntbone Horde fled Sharpstone Keep to the Frostsilver Mines."
