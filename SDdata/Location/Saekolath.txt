Saekolath, or the Place of Shade, was the mysterious Lorendrow jungle city located within Chult.
This city was located in a dense forest that was unknown to outsiders. Its buildings were surrounded by tall trees and flowing rivers.
When the majority of drow followed Lolths ways and descended to the Underdark, a small group instead travelled southward. Here they established the city of Saekolath.
