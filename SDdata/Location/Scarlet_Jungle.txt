The Scarlet Jungle was a dense forest found in the Shining Lands of southeast Faer√ªn.
The Scarlet Jungle blanketed the southern edge of the Dustwall Mountains in eastern Durpar.
The dense jungle made passage through the Dustwall Mountains difficult, forcing traders and caravans to travel great distances around the mountains.
