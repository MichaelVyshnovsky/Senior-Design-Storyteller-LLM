        "mainbody": "Ausabbason was a sparsely-populated fishing hamlet on Cloak Bay, southwest of the Cloakwood, separated from the library fortress of Candlekeep by a perilous and rocky shore known as the Jaws.\nAusabbason stood on Cloak Bay and the smaller Borlyth Bays southeastern shore, sheltered by Cloakwoods edge, and south of the nameless rocky plateau that bordered the eastern side of Borlyth Bay. A wagon trail that curled southeast around the edge of Cloakwood connected Ausabbason to the Coast Way. By the 14 century DR, Ausabbason was a collection of mostly abandoned single-store cottages reinforced with timber wood and scavenged marine wrecks. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in Ausabbason.\nThe hamlets inhabitants survived by salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for crabs, silverfins, and laethe, a species of eel-like creatures.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Ausabbason, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14 century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster attacks."
