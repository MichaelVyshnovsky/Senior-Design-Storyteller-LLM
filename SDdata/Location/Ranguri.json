        "mainbody": "anguri was the capital city of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra by the midâ€“14 century DR. It was the seat of power of the Priest-Kings and the center of faith for the Lords of Creation, for which it was named the Temple City, and the biggest city in the southern jungles of Kara-Tur.\nRanguri sat on the Kunong River,Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, Ranguri and the Kunong River have not been labelled on any map of Malatra. However, based on descriptions, the Kunong is most likely the river from the central hill country and joining the Fenghsintzu River, indicating that Ranguri is somewhere along this.\nSome time in the early 8 century DR,This event is \"over 600 years\" before a setting date of 1357 DR, so some time before 757 DR. the Kuong deserted the capital at Parmahana and made an exodus through the jungle, founding a temporary capital at Beradandar, before moving on to the permanent capital at Ranguri.\nFrom Ranguri, the priest-kings turned their attention north, conquering fresh territories and making their first incursion into the southern jungles of Laothan, building their empire.\nCirca 1357 DR, Ranguri was the base of Priest-King Vishnan VII.\nRanguri took in trade from across the kingdom, with gems and metals from Denokanburi and weapons, armor, and custom metalwork such as winches and hoisting collars used in construction.\nRanguri was a city of stone, from its temples and palaces to its flagstoned streets lit by torches. It was also a city of water, with running water available in the palaces and public facilities and an extensive system of canals. These were used for travel around the city and to drain excessive water, as the city flooded heavily in the rainy season.\nThe core of the city was an interconnected complex of palaces and temples that was big enough to be a town in its own right. From here, the kingdoms bureaucracy and temples were managed in detail.\nThe Jarvatya, a formidable jinyan crime family, were based in Ranguri."
