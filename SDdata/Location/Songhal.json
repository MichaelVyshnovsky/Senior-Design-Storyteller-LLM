The enlightened town served as a center of learning for the kingdom, which contrasted with the surrounding farmsteads and agrarian holdings of the Impilturan thaedar.\nWhile it was well-known among the sages of Faer√ªn for some time, it became much more prominent during the late 14 century DR.\nIn the Year of the Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, the Silver Stag of the High Heralds, a loremaster by the name of Ilvarthaele Everstone, established her office in the Stormspire, located within the central district of Songhal. This was the first occasion such a post had been centered within a city located near the Sea of Fallen Stars since the founding of the High Heralds in the 10 century DR.\n*House of Many Tomes This holy house was perhaps the largest and most-renowned temple of Oghma found throughout the Realms."
