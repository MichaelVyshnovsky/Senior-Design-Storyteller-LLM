The '''Riftwood''' was an isolated forest located in the eastern region of the [[Shaar]], in the [[Shining South]].

==Geography==
The forest was located about 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) east of the [[Great Rift]]. The nearest settlement was [[Delzimmer]], located to the southwest.

===Geographical Features===
The trees of the forest formed in a neat circular forest in the eastern plains of the Shaar. They were bisected by the [[Rift River]].

Unlike the nearby tropical forests, the Riftwood featured fewer vines and less undergrowth.

==Notable Locations==
Within the forest was a well-protected logging community of [[gold dwarves]].

==Inhabitants==
In addition to the dwarves, the Riftwood was home to a variety of animals and beasts, including [[snake]]s, [[panther]]s, and [[giant beetle]]s.
