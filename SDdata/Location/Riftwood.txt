The Riftwood was an isolated forest located in the eastern region of the Shaar, in the Shining South.
The forest was located about 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) east of the Great Rift. The nearest settlement was Delzimmer, located to the southwest.
The trees of the forest formed in a neat circular forest in the eastern plains of the Shaar. They were bisected by the Rift River.
Unlike the nearby tropical forests, the Riftwood featured fewer vines and less undergrowth.
Within the forest was a well-protected logging community of gold dwarves.
In addition to the dwarves, the Riftwood was home to a variety of animals and beasts, including snakes, panthers, and giant beetles.
