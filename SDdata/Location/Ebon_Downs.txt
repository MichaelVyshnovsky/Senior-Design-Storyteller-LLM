The '''Ebon Downs''' were a burial ground deep within the [[Silverwisp Swamp]], just south of the southern [[High Road]].

==Geography==
===Flora & Fauna===
[[Deathjump spider]]s were known to lurk around this area.

==History==
Historically, the Ebon Downs served as a burial site for the inhabitants of the village of [[Grimhollow]].

Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[Netherese]] [[necromancer]] known as [[Idris]] made pacts with a number of [[wight]]s within the cemetery known as the [[Barrow Lords]] to form an army capable of striking against [[Thay]] and to lay siege to the [[Sword Coast]]. With the help of a powerful [[artifact]] called [[Deathknell]], he raised many [[undead]] from this site that went on to overwhelm Grimhollow, adding more to their ranks.

News of the rising undead eventually reached [[Lord Neverember]], who proceeded to dispatch a contingent of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] to counter the threat. That contingent flew the banner of [[Kelemvor]] and was led by a [[doomguide]] named [[Vesper Soulhearth]]. They fought bravely, but being ill-prepared the contingent ultimately fell at the hands of the Barrow Lords. Only Vesper managed to survive and flee to a nearby temple to Kelemvor for safety. Later Lord Neverember would task a group of [[adventurer]]s to travel down to the Ebon Downs in search of Vesper and her lost contingent.

When those adventurers arrived, they found that the Barrow Lords were assaulting the temple of Kelemvor with a horde of [[bone golem]]s and [[zombie]]s.
