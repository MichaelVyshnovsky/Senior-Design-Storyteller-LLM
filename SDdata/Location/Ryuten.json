        "Description": "Ryuten stood as the third among three islands situated in proximity to Kozakura, yet existing beyond its dominion. Positioned to the north of [[Tenmei]], it was easily visible from across the slender [[Suro Straits]] that graced Tenmei's northern tip. Ryuten emerged gracefully from the surrounding sea, boasting slender valleys, steep hills, and lofty, forested ridges. The interior was primarily enveloped by the temperate [[Obitake Forest]], contributing to the island's verdant allure. Serving as the central hub for trade and commerce, [[Shizumi]] held a pivotal role on the island.",
        "Inhabitants": "Vast expanses of uncharted territory sprawled across Ryuten, serving as the domain of enigmatic humanoids and supernatural creatures. These inhabitants prefered to dwell within the forested hills, while the [[human]] populace of Ryuten inhabited the coastal valleys. The interactions between the two groups was marked by hostile clashes, rendering extensive inland exploration a perilous endeavor.\n\nThe people of Ryuten were regarded as barbarians, leading a rugged tribal existence with limited cultural development. They engaged in trade with the [[korobokuru]] residing in northern Tenmei, exchanging valuable metals mined from those lands. The exceptional quality of their leatherwork commanded high regard and fetched a considerable price as a sought-after trade commodity."
