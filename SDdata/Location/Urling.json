Nythra served as a go-between for the hathrans and the other Rashemi of the community, and spoke to any of its outlander visitors.\nFor many years, travelers were allowed to stay overnight in Urling, and in those instances only for a day or two. Various sources differed as to whether or not intruders were actually punished by execution or if that was merely exaggeration.\n* The Green Chapel, the hamlets lone inn and only building open to outlanders.\nWhile Urling was the home to many hathrans of Rashemen it was not exclusive to their order as was the Urlingwood.
