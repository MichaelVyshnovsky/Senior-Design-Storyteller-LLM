        "Description": "At first glance Urling appeared to be nothing more than a primordial grove of [[evergreen]] and [[alder]] trees. In between the trees were rolling grassy mounds, within which were the traditional stone lodges that were associated with Rashemen.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The various herbs and fruits needed to make ''[[jhuild]]'', also known as Rashemi firewine, could be found and harvested in the area around Urling."

        "Government": "[[Yhelbruna|Lady Yhelbruna]] led the community of of Urling ''circa'' the early 1470s [[DR]], assisted by [[Nythra]] of the [[Seven Rivers]]. Nythra served as a go-between for the hathrans and the other Rashemi of the community, and spoke to any of its outlander visitors.",
        "Trade": "For many years, travelers were allowed to stay overnight in Urling, and in those instances only for a day or two. Various sources differed as to whether or not intruders were actually punished by execution or if that was merely exaggeration.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[The Green Chapel]], the hamlet's lone inn and only building open to outlanders.",
        "Inhabitants": "While Urling was the home to many [[hathran]]s of Rashemen it was not exclusive to their order as was the Urlingwood. Rashemaar commoners native to the country were allowed residence within, including the witches' spouses, family members, and servants."
