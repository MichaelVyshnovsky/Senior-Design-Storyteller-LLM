        "mainbody": "Gorthin was a hamlet in southeastern Cormyr, situated north of Kirinwood and south of Monksblade.\nGorthin was an isolated backwater, seldom visited and not located on any major roads. It occupied a desolate boggy region of brambles, stunted trees, rocky ridges, and mist. The bogs around Gorthin were the source of the Evenbrook, a branch of the Mistwater River that flowed south into the Lake of Dragons.\nThe people of Gorthin herded sheep and gathered berries from the bogs. They were defended by some local druids.\nThere were rumors of gems being found in the stony ridges around Gorthin, which was connected to another legend that Gorthin was the name of an ancient dwarven king whose tomb of riches lay beneath the hamlet. This contradicted the traditional story that Gorthins namesake founder had been a simple farmer. No one ever found the dwarf kings tomb, if it ever existed."
