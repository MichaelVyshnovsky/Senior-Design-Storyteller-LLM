        "Geography": "Gorthin was an isolated backwater, seldom visited and not located on any major roads. It occupied a desolate boggy region of brambles, stunted trees, rocky ridges, and mist. The bogs around Gorthin were the source of the [[Evenbrook]], a branch of the [[Mistwater River]] that flowed south into the [[Lake of Dragons]].<ref name=VGC-p78/><ref name=VGC-p92/>",
        "Inhabitants": "The people of Gorthin herded sheep and gathered berries from the bogs. They were defended by some local [[druid]]s.<ref name=VGC-p78/>",
        "Rumors and Legends": "There were rumors of [[gem]]s being found in the stony ridges around Gorthin, which was connected to another legend that Gorthin was the name of an ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] king whose tomb of riches lay beneath the hamlet. This contradicted the traditional story that Gorthin's namesake founder had been a simple farmer. No one ever found the dwarf king's tomb, if it ever existed.<ref name=VGC-p79>"
