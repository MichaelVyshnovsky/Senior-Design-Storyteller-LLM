'''Avang''' was a small community on the western edge of [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Geography==
The village was nestled at the base of the [[West Galena Mountains]] besides a tributary of the [[Beaumaris River]], and lay at the meeting of two trails comprising the east-west route between the [[Moonsea North]] and the [[Bloodstone Lands]]. The westward trail to the Moonsea led through a pass in the mountains called [[Garumn's Climb]], and then continued across the [[Barze|Plains of Barze]], through the [[Vercy Wood]], and ended in [[Ilinvur]]. The eastward trail connected Avang with the community of [[Moortown]] in the [[Bottomless Bogs]] of northeastern Vaasa, and to the [[Dead Man's Walk]] trail that traversed across the southern part of Vaasa.

==Trade==
The community served as a market for supplies and services for local small mines as well as the nearby [[Dwarf|dwarven]] community of [[Delhalls]]. It served as a way-point on the trails westward.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}

==History==
In the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1480}},{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|50}} the town became a place of refuge for peoples uprooted from Ilinvur and the [[Barze|Plains of Barze]] when [[elemental]]s from the [[Tortured Land]] unexpectedly swept onto their lands and attacked. Over the course of a few months, the influx of refugees led the local population to double.
