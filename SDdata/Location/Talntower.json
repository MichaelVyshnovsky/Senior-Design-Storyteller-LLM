        "mainbody": "The '''Talntower''' was an ancient [[dwarven]] waterworks that consisted of a spring-fed reservoir, channels, valves, and a collecting pool for drinking, watering animals, or bathing that was still in operation in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite dragon/297/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Talntower|87}}",
        "Geography": "The Talntower was located on the west side of [[Jundar's Pass]] where the trail approached the hills almost 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of [[Beliard]]. A promontory of stone formed a rugged cliff about 70 feet (21 meters) high near the road. On either side of the Talntower, lesser cliffs continued north and south for a quarter-mile (400 meters) or more, and the minor plateau of solid rock extended for at least the same distance westward.Based on the description \"on the west side of a back-country trail two days north of Beliard\" and the description of the geology given in the source, the most probable road is Jundar's Pass, as shown on the map.",
        "Features": {
            "The Rasping Spirit": "[[File:Talntower-offering.png|thumb|right|250px|''A small chest containing an offering to the Rasping Spirit. It sits in one of the carved seating areas on either side of the pool.'']]\nSince at least the [[1252 DR|Year of the Empty Goblet, 1252 DR]], the Talntower was the manifestation location of a spirit, [[ghost]], or [[deity|god]] with a raspy voice that pontificated cryptic answers, warnings, or predictions to anyone who left an offering on the floor of the cave or in one of the two pool-side seats (those that tossed their offering into the pool got silence). Petitioners could choose to ask questions and carry on short conversations with the oracle, or just listen to the whispered words and try to make sense of them. Most of the people who believed in the oracle kept its utterances to themselves, and often denied even visiting the Talntower, but from those that revealed what they heard came these examples:\n* \"The blade shall be taken up, a throne overthrown, and the son shall scorn the father.\"\n* \"The sword shall be found but the ring lost.\"\n* \"Kingdoms shall arise where only the bones of realms lie now, new crowns shall glitter, and red war shall rule many lands. Dwarves and [[elves]] shall have new realms of their own, but a great land shall fall.\"\n* \"The hand of the [[loremaster]] will find the hidden way when all other remedies fail.\"\n* \"Beware the [[Black Flame Zealots|black flame]]. It burns but consumes not, watches and sleeps not, and those who bear its mark are your foes forever.\"\n\nIn reality, the voice of the Rasping Spirit belonged to the elders of the [[Elhaembroe]] clan of [[gnomes]] who took turns spying on the visitors to the Talntower and giving cryptic answers and advice to those that left offerings. A spy chamber located low in the walls of the main cave afforded the person playing oracle various views of the cavern, and had small curving tunnels that carried and amplified whispers to echo about. Additionally, the noise from water falling into the pool helped obscure the source of the voice. The spy chamber was connected to the Elhaembroe's main complex of underground dwellings a quarter-mile (400 meters) to the west by a long and twisted passage that prevented accidental or purposeful flooding."

        "Defenses": "[[File:Talntower-entrance.png|thumb|right|216px|''An adventurer cautiously approaches the entrance to the main cave.'']]\nThe Talntower was an unguarded and uninhabited way-stop along Jundar's Pass, so visitors had to be cautious of lurking [[orc]] or [[goblin]] ambushes, or perhaps even more threatening predators. The facility was so useful at providing easy access to fresh water that it remained intact for centuries.",
        "History": "There was no definitive answer to the question of the origin of the name Talntower. Some said \"Taln\" was the proper name of the dwarf responsible for building it, or the dwarven clan or king who ordered it built, or a [[stone giant]] that was slain by the dwarves on the site. More fanciful stories claim that \"Taln\" was a gargantuan-sized creature that was turned to stone to form the cliffs in which the Talntower resided.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The Rasping Spirit was the subject of much speculation. Theories included that it was the voice of a deity (pick one), or the spirit of a [[wizard]] bound to the spot. Many (including a few [[Harpers]] and other supposedly wise folk) didn't care to question the origin of the voice, but were superstitious enough to believe it spoke the truth, if they could just unravel the meaning woven into the cryptic answers."
