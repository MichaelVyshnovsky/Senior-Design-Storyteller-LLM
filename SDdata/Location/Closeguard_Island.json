While [[Kurth|High Captain Kurth]] tentatively supported Deudermont, he had his men blockaded both the east and west bridges of Closeguard, which trapped the Brotherhood's [[wizard]]s on Cutlass Island but also forced Deudermont to attack the Host Tower by sea. Kurth was fearful of the chaos that would ensue if he committed to one side or the other, which would push the other High Captains to take sides as well, At the conclusion of the battle, when Greeth caused an explosion that destroyed the Host Tower, the blast was destructive enough to incinerate a number of homes on the western shore of Closeguard.\n\nFollowing the downfall of the Arcane Brotherhood, Ship Kurth fortified Closeguard Island as the city of Luskan descended into chaos.

While some of these invaders laid siege to Kurth Tower, others crossed the island to attack Cutlass Island.",
        "Description": "As headquarters of Ship Kurth, the main landmark on this rocky island was [[Kurth Tower]], \n\nBelowground, partially flooded tunnels infested with [[undead]] connected Closeguard Island to crypts beneath the [[Luskan/Ruins of Illusk|Ruins of Illusk]], and from there, to a network of sewers and tunnels throughout Luskan that led as far down as the [[Underdark]]. A hidden underwater cave below the western rim of Closeguard led directly into these underground tunnels.",
        "Geography": "Closeguard Island was one of five islands in Luskan (the others being [[Blood Island]], [[Cutlass Island]], [[Fang Island]], and [[Harbor Arm Island]]). Closeguard lay between Cutlass Island to the east and the Ruins of Illusk on Luskan's [[Luskan/South Bank|South Bank]] to the west. It was connected to Cutlass Island via the [[Sword Bridge]] and to the South Bank via the [[Dark Arch]] bridge. It sat just upstream of [[Dragon Beach]] and just downstream of Blood Island, although it was not connected to either of these.",
        "Defenses": "While the island was protected by guards as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, it was unguarded by the late 15{{th}} century DR, however anyone who was not a known member of Ship Kurth or the Arcane Brotherhood was quickly singled out regardless. The island was protected via a [[ward]] placed on the Dark Arch which alerted the Arcane Brotherhood if anyone not affiliated with them were to cross it. Sword Bridge, in turn, was defended by [[battle horror]]s.",
        "History": "During the mid&ndash;1360s DR, the [[Archmage Arcane]] [[Arklem Greeth]] personally strengthened the [[magic]]al defenses of the island, particularly those of the Dark Arch bridge and of Kurth Tower.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = The whole of the city is rallied against us.

Such prisoners were either kept under guard in the house or chained in the dungeons beneath it."
