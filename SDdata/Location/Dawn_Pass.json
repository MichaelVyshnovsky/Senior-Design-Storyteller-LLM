        "mainbody": "Dawn Pass, also known as Dawntreader Gap, was a pass through the Graypeak Mountains at the east end of the Savage Frontier. Through here, the Dawn Pass Trail linked the Black Road across the Anauroch to the town of Llorkh.\nAlthough the pass was steep and demanding in comparison to Bleached Bones Pass further south, it was easier to defend, so it was preferred by the Zhentarim.\nIn the midâ€“14th century DR, the pass was often traversed by Zhentarim caravans from the Black Road.\nBy 1358 DR, a garrison of thirty Lords Men from Llorkh stood guard at the pass. They remained there through to at least 1370 DR.\nIn addition, around 1369/1370 DR, a beholder from Dekanter was also hired to defend the pass, together with its gnoll minions. Although this beholder was wild and almost unmanageable, the Zhentarim paid it extremely well and the arrangement suited its current circumstances, so it honored the deal, for the time being."
