        "mainbody": "'''Dawn Pass''', also known as '''Dawntreader Gap''', was a pass through the [[Graypeak Mountains]] at the east end of the [[Savage Frontier]]. Through here, the [[Dawn Pass Trail]] linked the [[Black Road]] across the [[Anauroch]] to the town of [[Llorkh]].",
        "Geography": "Although the pass was steep and demanding in comparison to [[Bleached Bones Pass]] further south, it was easier to defend, so it was preferred by the Zhentarim.",
        "Trade": "In the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], the pass was often traversed by [[Zhentarim]] caravans from the Black Road.",
        "Defenses": "By [[1358 DR]], a garrison of thirty [[Lord's Men]] from Llorkh stood guard at the pass. They remained there through to at least [[1370 DR]].\n\nIn addition, around [[1369]]/[[1370 DR]], a [[beholder]] from [[Dekanter]] was also hired to defend the pass, together with its [[gnoll]] minions. Although this beholder was wild and almost unmanageable, the [[Zhentarim]] paid it extremely well and the arrangement suited its current circumstances, so it honored the deal, for the time being."
