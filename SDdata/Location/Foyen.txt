'''Foyen''' was a village in [[Tethyr]] that supplied the city of [[Ithmong]] (later [[Darromar]]) with food.

==Description==
Foyen was a small [[hamlet]] of about 80 to 100 persons living in 12 to 15 simple homes. The village was surrounded by farmland and pastures for keeping herds of [[cattle]].

==Geography==
Foyen was located in the county of [[Rivershire]], in the [[Crown Lands]] of Tethyr.<ref name=LoI1-T-map /> It sat in a grassy area with only minimal tree cover, east of the city of Ithmong about {{SI|5|miles|k|long=yes}} north of the [[River Ith]].

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], many of the crops in Foyen and the surrounding villages were destroyed in the chaos of that world-shattering event. A month after the Time of Troubles ended, however, things did not return to normal. Instead, the population of monsters in the region seemed to increase, and this led to a shortage of food in nearby Ithmong, which relied on Foyen and other nearby villages for food. In particular, a [[purple worm]] had eaten several cows pastured northeast of Foyen and churned up the ground. At least one villager had even spotted a [[bone devil]] near the village.

These monsters were, in fact, summoned to the region by a series of [[Thayvian beacon]]s as part of a plot by the [[Knights of the Shield]] and [[Inselm Hhune]] to prevent [[Ernest Gallowglass]] from rising to power over all of Tethyr&mdash;a position that Hhune himself wanted&mdash;during the time of anarchy known as the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]].

The [[Company of Eight]] became involved and hired a group of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the area and determine the cause of all the monster attacks.
