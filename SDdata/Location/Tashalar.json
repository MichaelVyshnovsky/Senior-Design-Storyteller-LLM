        "mainbody": "'''Tashalar''', also referred to as '''the Tashalar''', was a small, self-contained country located on a strip of coast along the southern [[Shining Sea]]. It lay just east of the [[Chult]] peninsula, and west of the magic realm of [[Halruaa]]. It was famous for beautiful weather, beautiful people, excellent crossbows, and the richest wine-producing region in the world.\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "The country was a lush and bountiful land of great natural wealth and goods that were considered exotic to many northern realms. It comprised a number of small city-states, scattered rural villages and vast jungle wilderness.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "",
            "Flora & Fauna": "The rare [[bloodflower]] could be found and harvested in the jungles of Tashalar to be used in the production of healing salves."
        },
        "Life and Society": {
            "Culture": "Hunting was a popular sport in Tashalar, as there were many deadly creatures to be found in the jungles.\n\nThe indigenous [[spices|spicy]] foods were quite popular, as were strong wines roasted [[pumpkin]] and [[loalurr]] seeds, and fruits such as [[date]]s and dried [[apricot]]s and the rather tart [[yhaumarind]].<ref> The distinct [[licorice]]-flavored drink of [[rollrum]] originated from locales in Tashalar."

            "Currency": "The cities and settlements of Tashalar utilized [[authokh]] and [[bebolt]]s, coins that were minted in the eastern realm of [[Chessenta]]. Calishite [[trade bar]]s were also a widely-accepted form of currency."
        },
        "Defenses": "Tashalar was defended by a navy commanded by the mercantile consortium known as the [[Rundeen]], operating out of the capital city of [[Tashluta]].",
        "History": "Along with other settlements on the coast of the Shining Sea, the cities of Tashalar were devastated by the [[Temples Plague]] that broke out in the {{YearlinkName|-676}}.\n\nSettlers from Calimshan arrived in Tashalar in the {{YearlinkName|-553}},<ref group=\"note\">The date of [[583 DR]] ascribed to this even on page 126 of ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]'' appears to be a mistake that was corrected in ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]''. but only remained in the region in power for a few centuries. The Tashalaran people barely survived the [[Empire plague]] that struck in the {{YearlinkName|-375}}, The [[lizardfolk]] and other scaly kind were then overthrown themselves in the early 1{{st}} century [[DR]] following a ten-year war. \n\nThe [[Confederation of Tashtan]] was formed in the {{YearlinkName|34}}, claiming much of the coastland along the Shining Sea as its own. It would endure for over a [[285 DR|quarter century]] before the [[Shoon Imperium]] launched the [[Tashalar Campaign]] of conquest over the region, supplanting local city leaders with loyal straps of Calimshan, and forcing the collective nation to disband into a number of smaller powers.\n\nDisease once again spread throughout the region in the {{YearlinkName|701}}. Many Tashalans were inflicted by [[lycanthropy]] via the [[Moon Plague]] that originated in the northern metropolis of [[Calimport]].\n\nDuring the 12{{th}} century DR, in the {{YearlinkName|1142}}, the [[Rage of Wizards]] erupted between the yuan-ti mages of the [[Coiled Cabal]] and a score of [[archmage]]s that lived throughout Tashalar and [[Lapaliiya]]. Terrible destruction was brought down upon many of their cities. While the controlling Rundeen endured the devastation, along with [[Harper]]-led assaults against their trade monopoly in other lands, they remained in control of Tashluta nd sought to expand their influence in the surrounding lands with help of their allies in the [[Knights of the Shield]] and secretly, the yuan-ti of House Se'Sehen.\n\nFollowing the cataclysmic event of the [[Spellplague]], and throughout much of the 15{{th}} century, a vast stretch of Tashalar remained submerged beneath the joining of the Great and Shining Seas.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, successive assassinations and blackmail attempts targeting Tashalar's nobility led many to believe that some power-hungry group such as the Rundeen or yuan-ti cabal were attempting to elevate a single ruler over the region.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Landmarks": "* [[Abbey of Tharynd]], an underground temple to [[Selûne]] that house the magical Moonshaft Pool.\n* [[Crypt of Anthilar]], the resting place of the infamous [[lich]] [[Anthilar]], rumored to house the ''[[spellskins of Mhairshaulk]]''.",
            "Settlements & Ruins": "* [[Procalith]], a ruined city that dated back to the Shoon Imperium, having been destroyed during the Rage of Wizards in the 12{{th}} century.\n* [[Tashluta]], the capital of Tashalar and the main point of arrival of nearly all outsiders to the realm."
