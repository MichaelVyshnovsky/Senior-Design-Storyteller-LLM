The '''Twin Songs''' was a district of the [[Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], located on the northern side of the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge. It was an expansive collection of minor temples, shrines and altars dedicated to nearly every [[deity]], particularly those that were considered dark and malevolent. In fact, it had monuments dedicated to more deities than most Baldurians were even aware existed.

==Description==
The district was wholly devoted to worship of the [[divine]]. As such, services of [[cleric]]s from nearly every faith were readily available.

Like the other districts that were located on the shores of the [[River Chionthar]], Twin Songs had a number of boatmen who could ferry them to other quays and docks within the city.

==Crime==
A gang associated with [[The Guild]] called "The Faithless", which was run by Kingpin [[Straightstick]], operated in this area. They also acted as smugglers, moving goods along the river or across [[Dusthawk Hill]] into the city, usually into [[Brampton]].<ref name=dia-p196">

==Notable Locations==
* [[Church of Last Hope]]: This sanctuary was not dedicated to any particular faith, but rather served those who suffered from hopelessness, emotional suffering, and fatal illnesses.
