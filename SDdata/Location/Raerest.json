        "mainbody": "'''Raerest''', or colloquially '''the Prow''', was the largest and the westernmost of the three islands located west of [[Thelve]] and the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]], inhabited by swamp [[lizardfolk]].",
        "Description": "Like all seven islands west of the library, Raerest consisted of mountainous and rocky outcroppings of fissured [[granite]] covered in temperate woodlands and shrubbery. Pools of collected rainwater in rock basins and freshwater springs could be found on the island. Additionally, Raerest had a notable freshwater swamp area. Raerest also served as a shield against sea winds and storms for the eastern islands and was nicknamed that as \"the Prow.\"\n\nRaerest was of almost equal size to Thelve with the exception of a {{SI|3|mile|k|long=yes}} long outcropping on the southeastern side of the island. The longest diagonal distance across the island was almost {{SI|17|mile|k|long=yes}} and excluding the outcropping – approximately {{SI|10|mile|k|long=yes}}.\n\nThe island's only area of good anchorages was on the eastern shores. Apart from that dozen sites, all other sides of the island were assaulted by powerful sea winds. A huge rock rose up above Raerest's center and curved at its western end. This mountain was known as [[the Shield]], and it was the most prominent of many similar but smaller jutting rocks. The Shield also hid rich deposits of copper that could be seen sparkling from the surface. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the rock bore signs of mining done in the past – several deep holes burrowed into it in various places.\n\nThere were three small freshwater lakes located parallel to the eastern border of the Shield, all fed by many springs. The lakes were connected together and ended in a large unnamed swamp. To the lakes' south, they drained into a calm bay – a natural harbor encircled by the fortress of [[Roaringcrest]], that was ruined by an unleashed ''[[wild magic]]'' field up by the [[lich]]es of the [[Twilight Three]], and claimed by time, elements, and plantlife.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The isle's rocks were permanently whitened by the abundant [[guano]] of its thousands-strong seabird population. The birds were netted and consumed by the [[lizardfolk]] tribes that inhabited Raerest's unnamed swamp. The lizardfolk used the same nets to catch [[fish]], and they farmed [[clam]]s in the waterways that drained the swamp.\n\nThe riots of Roaringcrest were known to house such deadly creatures as [[automaton]]s, [[crimson death]], and [[darktentacles]]."
        },
        "History": "The origin of the island's name was lost to the ages. However, sages believed that Raerest and its other six sibling islands were all named after sailors, pirates, and settlers who claimed these lands in the long-forgotten past. The ruined pirate stronghold was rumored to hold unlooted treasured as of the late 14{{th}} century DR if pirates and sailors were to be believed."
