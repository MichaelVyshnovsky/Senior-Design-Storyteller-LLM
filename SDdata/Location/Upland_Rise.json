        "Description": "The Upland Rise historically served as a natural park for the people of Neverwinter. Mists from the [[Neverwinter River]] would gather around the base of the hill during the night.",
        "History": "In the decades following the [[eruption of Mount Hotenow]], [[Dagult Neverember]] sent loggers and engineers to harvest the trees on the Upland Rise for lumber to rebuild the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Neverwinter docks]]. By the late 1470s DR, the hill had been completely deforested and stripped of its natural beauty, leaving it a wasteland dotted with stumps.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Dhafiyand]] set a trap for members of the [[Nashers]] by luring them to the Upland Rise at night. There, he attacked alongside [[ash zombie]]s and stole the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'' from them."
