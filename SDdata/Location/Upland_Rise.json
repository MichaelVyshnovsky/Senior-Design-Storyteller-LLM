        "mainbody": "The Upland Rise was a forested hill that marked the northeastern edge of the city of Neverwinter.\nThe Upland Rise historically served as a natural park for the people of Neverwinter. Mists from the Neverwinter River would gather around the base of the hill during the night.\nIn the decades following the eruption of Mount Hotenow, Dagult Neverember sent loggers and engineers to harvest the trees on the Upland Rise for lumber to rebuild the Neverwinter docks. By the late 1470s DR, the hill had been completely deforested and stripped of its natural beauty, leaving it a wasteland dotted with stumps.\nIn the , the Red Wizard Dhafiyand set a trap for members of the Nashers by luring them to the Upland Rise at night. There, he attacked alongside ash zombies and stole the Crown of Neverwinter from them."
