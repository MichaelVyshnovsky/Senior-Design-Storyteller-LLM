        "History": "Monksblade got its name from the fact that it was built on the foundations of four ruined monasteries: [[Mother Chauntea's House]], the [[Towers of War]], the [[Lady's House]], and the [[House of the Seas]], which all coexisted with each other at one point.\n\nUnfortunately, thieving [[mage]]s, bandits, [[lizardmen]] raiders from the [[Vast Swamp]], and Sembian infiltrators depopulated the buildings until they stood empty and eventually fell to ruin. Eventually, at the urging of the king, who needed an eastern watchpost but lacked the resources to create a fort, homesteaders resettled the site, creating the village.\n\nCoastal settlements drew business away over time but the village remained attractive owing to its picturesque location, with the boughs of huge trees shading overgrown gardens.",
