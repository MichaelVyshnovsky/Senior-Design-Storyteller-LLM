        "mainbody": "The area of '''north [[Zakhara]]''' was dominated by the conflicting world-views of the independent-minded [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] on the one hand and the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Qudra]] with their fierce loyalty towards the [[Grand Caliph]] and belief in order on the other.\n\nIt was framed by the shores of the [[Great Sea]] in the west and north, where it touched [[Faer√ªn]] at the border to [[Konigheim]],<ref><ref> and the [[Land of the Yak-Men]] in the east. The [[Furrowed Mountains]] separated north Zakhara to the south and east from the [[Haunted Lands]] in the [[Interior Zakhara|continent's interior]]. In the southwest, the region stretched to the [[Sea of Caravans]] to where the territory directly controlled by Qudra bordered the [[High Desert]].",
        "Geography": "It was mainly an arid region, broken by short rivers that supported the major cities.",
        "Utaqa": "{{Main|Utaqa}}\nThe City of Free Man, at the mouth of the river [[Al-Zulma River|al-Zulma]], was the northernmost major settlement of Zakhara. The inhabitants were an independent lot and took pride in their position as the last stronghold of civilization towards the barbaric northern lands.<ref>",
        "Hafayah": "{{Main|Hafayah}}\nThe City of Secrets, at the mouth of the river [[Al-Kufr River|al-Kufr]], was a place of dark-colored buildings, dark-dressed people, and dark political machinations. A bloody coup in [[1364 DR]]{{AQ-time}} left the city simmering with the activities of different factions.<ref>",
        "Qadib": "{{Main|Qadib}}\nThe City of Wands, at the mouth of [[Al-Haul River]], was the center of learning in the north, famous for its universities but even more so for the number of magic-users among its citizens.<ref>",
        "Muluk": "{{Main|Muluk}}\nThe City of Kings, at the mouth of [[Al-Zalim River]], was an important trading city. Its citizens were proud on their old traditions and long unbroken line of kings.<ref>",
        "Umara": "{{Main|Umara}}\nThe beautiful, blue-tiled City of Knights, at the mouth of the river [[Al-Yatir River|al-Yatir]], was taken over by [[Al-Badia|hill barbarians]] a little before [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}} The difficult accommodation of the new and old populations to one another deeply marked the city.<ref>",
        "Liham": "{{Main|Liham}}\nThe City of Soldiers, at the mouth of [[Al-Sari River]], was counted as the southernmost of the Free Cities, but was in fact under strong influence from nearby Qudra. Its strong military featured a large contingent of [[mamluk]]s.<ref>",
        "Qudra": "{{Main|Qudra}}\nThe City of Power, at the mouth of [[Al-Faddi River]], was the greatest metropolis in the north and featured the strongest fortifications in any city in [[Enlightenment|enlightened]] Zakhara. It was ruled by the mamluks in the name of the Grand Caliph, who worked to extend order and protection against barbarians, [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]], and rebels.<ref><ref>"
