        "Geography": "Along the coasts, long flat beaches were found. Most lacked [[sand]], and instead comprised pebbles and rocks. Tides were significant among the islands. At low tide, the beaches could be exposed as much as a quarter mile (400 meters) from the waterline. At high tide, the water line could rise up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. During storms, the beaches were battered by waves. The coastlines of the islands were dotted with bays and coves, where ships could find a safe harbor from the harsh northern seas.\n\nThe remaining coastlines were jagged rocks. Tall cliffs of [[granite]] towered over the water, some up to {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} in height. These cliffs were worn smooth from exposure to the wind, and in the winter were covered with sheer ice.\n\nFurther inland, stagnant saltwater marshes were usually found. These gray and desolate marches lacked trees and an odor of [[sulfur]] hung constantly in the air. Traveling in these marshes was hazardous, with about 10% of the terrain being [[quicksand]].\n\nFreshwater streams were common on the islands. Most were shallow, reaching a maximum depth of {{SI|3|ft|c|long=yes}}. Most streams were not safe for boats because of rapids. The islands were home to a handful of rivers, which were deeper and calmer, and safe for boats. Ferries and bridges allowed for safe crossing.\n\nMuch of the Moonshaes terrain was moorland. This rolling grassland was dotted with lakes, ponds, and swamps, but most of it was well-drained and dry. The terrain was safe and pleasant and was used as pasture for cattle and [[sheep]].\n\nMountains and highlands made up another sizable portion of the Moonshaes terrain. These rugged and twisted mountains were jagged and cracked from centuries of erosion. The steep mountains reached {{SI|8000|ft|long=yes}} in height. From autumn to early spring, heavy snow covered the highlands, only melting away completely by summer.",
        "Weather": "The climate of the Moonshaes was considered subarctic. The weather was severe, with long winters. During the winter, biting freezing wind roared across the moorlands, as the lack of cover caused the wind to sweep uninterrupted across the exposed terrain. The winter also brought storms to the islands. These storms originated in the [[Trackless Sea]], usually striking the islands from the northwest. Storm season began in late [[Eleint]] and ended in [[Ches]]. Huge swells reaching {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} in height made the sea unnavigable during storm season.\n{{Climate\n| title       = Climate for the Moonshae Isles\n| float       = center\n| climaterefs = \n| boxwidth    = 650px\n| maxtemp     = 110\n| mintemp     = -20\n| temp1       = 23\n| temp2       = 28\n| temp3       = 33\n| temp4       = 40\n| temp5       = 60\n| temp6       = 70\n| temp7       = 76\n| temp8       = 75\n| temp9       = 69\n| temp10      = 57\n| temp11      = 48\n| temp12      = 34\n| showzero      = yes\n| maxrain     = 30\n| rainwidth   = 40\n| rainscale   = 4\n| rain1       = 0.2\n| rain2       = 0.4\n| rain3       = 3.5\n| rain4       = 13.7\n| rain5       = 12.8\n| rain6       = 9.4\n| rain7       = 7.5\n| rain8       = 20.4\n| rain9       = 11.7\n| rain10      = 4.1\n| rain11      = 2.5\n| rain12      = 1.2\n| maxsnow     = 120\n| snowscale   = 1\n| snowwidth   = 40\n| snow1       = 67\n| snow2       = 53\n| snow3       = 39\n| snow4       = 12\n| snow5       = 0\n| snow6       = 0\n| snow7       = 0\n| snow8       = 0\n| snow9       = 0\n| snow10      = 13\n| snow11      = 47\n| snow12      = 92\n}}",
        "Flora & Fauna": "The islands were covered with thick deciduous forests of [[aspen]], [[birch]], [[hickory]], [[maple]], [[oak]], and [[yew]]. The thick undergrowth made travel difficult unless a game trail or path was found. The plant growth was thick enough at the height of summer to block the wind, holding in the hot and humid air. During the winter, the trees dropped their leaves and the undergrowth died, making travel much easier.\n\nThe islands were also home to forests of coniferous trees. Forests of [[pine]], [[cedar]], and [[spruce]] had little undergrowth and the forest ground was covered in a thick layer of needles. These forests were usually located in the higher parts of the Moonshaes. During the summer, cool wind swept through the trees, and in the winter the trees acted as a wind block.\n\nThe forests of the Moonshaes were home to many animals. In the deciduous forests, smaller animals such as [[hare]]s and [[foxes]] made their homes. During the summer the forests were filled with insects. The coniferous forests on the other hand were home to large animals such as [[bear]]s, [[deer]], and [[wolves]] with little to no insects.\n\nThe saltwater marshes, fens, and swamps were home to swarms of insects. They spawned in the stagnant pools and were generally unpleasant, biting and stinging anyone who traveled the marshes. Dangerous creatures were known to inhabit the dark waters. The freshwater lakes, rivers and streams were home to healthy populations of [[perch]], [[salmon]], and [[trout]].\n\nIn the highlands, [[marmot]]s, [[mice]], and [[foxes]] lived in the barren terrain. [[Eagle]]s, [[falcon]]s, and [[hawk]]s made nests in the cliffs. Some copses of coniferous trees were found here, but usually the only plant life was hardy [[lichen]] and [[mosses]]. In some areas, vibrant wildflowers appeared for a brief period during the summer.",
        "Economy": "Each kingdom of the Moonshaes, while somewhat self-sufficient, had some amount of trade with one another. Most goods traveled on ships from port to port. Nearly all trade occurred during the spring and summer; it was brought to halt by the fierce winters. The major external trading partners of the Moonshaes were [[Amn]], [[Calimshan]], [[Tethyr]], and [[Waterdeep]]. \n\n[[Caer Callidyrr]], with its sprawling and accessible port, was the main commerce and trading hub of the Moonshaes. Merchants from all over [[Toril]] could be encountered here. Exported goods bound for Waterdeep or Calimshan were shipped from the city, and imports from outside were brought in. \n\nWaterdhavian merchants sought to trade cloth, oil, or spice for high-quality [[steel]] crafted by the Ffolk. Calishite merchants brought [[horse]]s, parchment, [[silk]]s, and [[spices]] in their [[galleon]]s. The southern merchants sought fur, metals and [[weapon]]s. Timber from the islands was in high demand, as it was the only easily accessible location for the large trees required to build [[galleon]]s. Some Calishite merchants sailed the extra week to trade in the ports on Corwell or Moray.\n\nSome Waterdhavians stopped in the ports of the Northlanders. The Northmen traded slaves and Ffolk weapons for alcohol, cloth, [[gold]], and oil.\n\nTarnian shipbuilders from [[Mintarn]], an island that had exhausted its supply of timber, were a frequent sight in Caer Callidyrr. They arrived in the city, purchased enough raw materials to build another ship, then sailed back to Mintarn in both vessels.\n\nMoonshavian merchants brought ale and livestock from Corwell, and [[coral]] and [[iron]] ore from Moray, to Caer Callidyrr to be traded for high-quality weapons. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Moonshae had an established gold mining and minting. The Moonshae gold had a unique telltale tint ‚Äì rose, the shade found nowhere else in the Realms. Occasionally, the Moonshae gold was used to create enchanted jewelry that could be found as far as the mage nation of [[Halruaa]]. However, Moonshae gold was considered to be of lesser quality than gold jewelry of Halruaa.\n\n[[File:Alicia Kendrick2e.png|thumb|left|''Alicia Kendrick, High Queen of the Moonshae Isles.'']]",
        "Government": "As of {{Yearlink|1371}}, the majority of the Moonshae Isles were ruled by High Queen [[Alicia Kendrick]], who ruled from the capital city of [[Caer Callidyrr]] on [[Alaron]].\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], [[House Kendrick]] lost much of their control over the isles. In {{Yearlink|1479}}, much of the isle of [[Alaron]] was ruled by House Kendrick, although the King's forces did not control the entire island. The Isle of [[Snowdown]] was controlled by the [[vampire]] Lady [[Erliza Daressin]], who was loyal to [[Amn]]. The Isle of [[Gwynneth]] was controlled by the Kingdom of [[Sarifal]], which was ruled by High Lady [[Ordalf]]. A tribe of [[fomorian]]s crossed from the [[Feywild]] into [[Faer√ªn]] after the Spellplague and took control of the island of [[Oman]].

Her clerics were [[druid]]s and she was worshiped by the Ffolk.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Northlanders primarily worshiped the deities [[Auril]], [[Tempus]], and [[Umberlee]]. A few were also known to worship the god [[Valkur]]. The worship of these gods was often little more than cursory for the Northlanders and dependent upon whether or not they were residing in the god's sphere of influence. The Northlander faith expanded in the 15{{th}} century, introducing the deity [[Talos]] to their pantheon and giving Valkur much more prominence. The latter became viewed as the most important among the gods, embodying the qualities the Northlanders valued most in life.\n\nStarting around {{Yearlink|1256}}, clerics from various faiths began visiting the Isles, with the goal of converting the islanders to their faith and establishing churches. The reactions of the islanders were mixed, with the Northlanders killing the clerics while the Ffolk generally considered the clerics harmless and a source of entertainment. The foreign clerics successfully converted a handful of Ffolk, but the vast majority of the Ffolk remained faithful to their traditional religion.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1358}}, during the [[Time of Troubles]], [[Bhaal]] was banished from the Moonshaes.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1359}}, priests of the [[Church of Bane|Risen Cult of Bane]] led by the cleric [[Gauntather]] began establishing themselves on the Moonshae Isles.

The [[LeShay]] founded the kingdom of [[Sarifal]], constructing the city of [[Karador]] on an island in the center of the lake within [[Myrloch Vale]].\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|-9800}}, [[Llewyrr]] refugees began arriving on the islands and were welcomed by the LeShay. The refugees settled in the mountains and formed the kingdom of [[Synnoria]].\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|-6000}}, [[Grond Peaksmasher]] arrived in the Moonshaes, accompanied by a tribe of giants. They settled on [[Norland]] in the [[Jotunhammer Mountains]].\n\n''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-5000}}, conflict erupted between the dwarves and firbolgs of the Isles.

The children of the Earthmother united with the Llewyrr and dwarves to battle the Beast, while it brought fomorians from the [[Feywild]] to be its allies. The conflict dragged on for decades until the minions of Kazgaroth were driven to isolated corners of the Moonshaes. The fomorians conquered the firbolgs, forcing them into slavery.\n\n''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-500}}, most of the fey, including the fomorians, abandoned their domains in the Moonshaes and retreated back into the Feywild. The kingdom of Sarifal was abandoned and the city of Karador sank into the Myrloch.",
            "Early History": "In the {{YearlinkName|140}}, refugees fleeing from the persecution of the [[Shadowking]] crossed the [[Sea of Swords]] and settled in the Moonshaes on the island of [[Gwynneth]], beginning the race of the [[Ffolk]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|149}}, the human settlements of Gwynneth united to form the kingdom of [[Corwell]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|154}}, a peace treaty between the elven kingdom of [[Synnoria]] and the human kingdom of Corwell was signed.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|177}}, after a prolonged civil war, [[Callidyrr Hugh]] reunited the fractured kingdom of Corwell.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|201}}, [[Bhaal]] took control of Kazgaroth, sending it to destroy the Ffolk. Chieftain [[Cymrych Hugh]] defeated Kazgaroth and was crowned High King. Moonshae Reckoning (MR) marks this year as year one on the Moonshavian calendar.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|250}}, High King Cymrych Hugh died and was entombed within a barrow mound near [[Blackstone]]. He left no heir with a strong claim to the throne, and as a result the kingdoms of the Moonshaes splintered.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|256}}, [[Illuskan]] sailors from [[Tuern]] and [[Gundarlun]] arrived in the Moonshaes, finding the kingdoms at each other's throats. This began centuries of raids against the Ffolk by the Northmen.\n\n[[File:Gwylloch's judgment - Ryan Barger.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Prince [[Ketheryll]] brings [[Durnhal]] and [[Morgan]] of Corwell before High King Gwylloch of the Moonshae Isles for his judgment ([[295 DR]]).'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|289}}, High King [[Gwylloch]] constructed the [[Castle of Skulls]] from the skulls of his enemies.

Northmen captured in these raids were brought to the [[Circus Bizarre]], a gladiatorial arena, where they were killed.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|467}}, a large group of immigrants from [[Tethyr]] arrived on the islands and settled among the Ffolk. The newly arrived Tethyrians brought their religious beliefs with them, but most Ffolk maintained their faith in the Earthmother. Architects and engineers among the immigrants shared their knowledge with the Ffolk, allowing the Ffolk to construct improved defensive fortifications. As a result, raids from Northlanders dropped over the next few centuries.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|852}}, an [[Illuskan]] fleet of [[longship]]s invaded the Moonshaes.

In the {{YearlinkName|1345}},, [[Grunnarch|Grunnarch the Red]] brought his host of [[longship]]s to [[Thelgaar Ironhand]]'s [[Iron Keep]] on Oman's Isle to prepare an attack on the southern Moonshaes. In the first council of northern Kings and Captains, Thelgaar announced his intention of making long-lasting peace with the [[Ffolk]] and starting a prosperous trading relationship. But most of the warriors present disagreed and decided to go along with the plan to raid and pillage the cities of [[Caer Corwell]] and [[Caer Callidyrr]] and the rest of the Ffolk lands. That same night, Thelgar was slain by [[Kazgoroth]], who took the identity of the king and supported the attack on Caer Corwell.\n\n''En route'' to Caer Corwell, Kazgaroth, in Thelgar's shape, challenged and killed the Leviathan, one of the children of the goddess Earthmother. Around the town and fortress of Caer Corwell, the Northmen were halted by the combined forces of [[Tristan Kendrick|Prince Tristan Kendrick]] and his companions.",
                "Talos": "In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, [[Robyn Kendrick]] sensed the imminent return of the Earthmother to the Moonshaes. Angered by her return, the god Talos attempted to throw the islands into chaos by turning the Ffolk and Northlanders against each other again. To achieve this goal, Talos recruited an army of pirates, [[sahuagin]] from [[Kressilacc]] ,and even a [[dracolich]] named [[Gotha]]. Princess [[Deirdre Kendrick]] aided in the release of the [[avatar]] of [[Grond Peaksmasher]]. She was corrupted by Talos and was later killed by her sister Alicia Kendrick.\n\nAlicia Kendrick was crowned High Queen after High King Tristan Kendrick abdicated his claim to the throne to be with his wife, Queen Robyn. She had left the capital to live in [[Myrloch Vale]] in order to commune with the Earthmother.",
                "United Moonshae Isles": "The conflict between the Northlanders and the Ffolk waned with the hard work of High King Tristan Kendrick and later through his daughter, High Queen Alicia Kendrick. In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Northlander kings swore fealty to Alicia, creating the United Moonshae Isles. This marked the first time that Ffolk and Northlanders were truly united. The Northlander kings adopted the title of Jarl and continued to rule their kingdoms.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1479}}, relations between Northmen and Ffolk had transformed from direct confrontation into an awkward form of tolerance, as the two learned to share the islands. This was, in part, due to the problems both cultures had on their respective home islands.",
                "Eladrin domination of Gwynneth": "[[File:Rebirth of sarifal - Ryan Barger.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''The leShay High Lady Ordalf announces the rebirth of Sarifal.'']]\nBeginning in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the wardens of the druid groves in Myrloch Vale had started to vanish after receiving summons to enter the [[moonwell]]s. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Robyn and Tristan Kendrick entered the Great Moonwell in Myrloch Vale to investigate the vanishing druids. They ended up in the [[Feywild]]. By {{Yearlink|1370}}, fey had begun to arrive in the Moonshaes, traveling through the moonwells. They settled primarily in Myrloch Vale and [[Winterglen Forests]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, with violent encounters increasing between the Ffolk and fey, human settlements around Myrloch Vale were abandoned.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, the fey city of Karador rose again from the waters of the Myrloch on the island of Gwynneth. The [[leShay]] High Lady Ordalf proclaimed herself queen of the island, giving it the name of Sarifal. The human kingdom of [[Corwell]] and its capital [[Caer Corwell]] fell into ruins.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1479}}, the isle of Gwynneth had become deeply connected to the Feywild. In the northern forests of the island, Prince [[Araithe]], son of Ordalf, fought against dark fey who sought to take the land for themselves. Meanwhile, High King [[Derid Kendrick]] sought to establish an embassy, but couldn't find a way to secure Lady Ordalf's permission."
