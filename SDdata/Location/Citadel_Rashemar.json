        "mainbody": "'''Citadel Rashemar''' was a ruined keep in the [[Sunrise Mountains]] in east [[Rashemen]]. It began as a ring-shaped fortress until it was besieged by the [[Tuigan Horde]] and although the horde was conquered, the village was never rebuilt.\n\n{{Quote|The easterners destroyed it – the horse people that call themselves the [[Tuigan]]. They smashed the castle and slew everyone in it...We defeated them, but nothing can restore our fortress, or the lives of those who perished there. We have not returned, and have left the castle to the beasts and fell creatures.|''The guide [[Ygsvar]] to [[Sigurd]].''}}",
        "Description": "The citadel comprised a central keep that was encircled by a great stone wall, that was some {{SI|300|yd|k}} in diameter. The outer walls of the fortress were dotted with a number of tall towers that held strong [[ward]]s that protected them from long-range [[magic]]. The central keep was connected to the towers on the outer walls by means of underground passages.\n\nThe ruined stonework of the citadel was later rearranged by the monstrous creatures that made it their lair. Rubble was formed into crude structures that allowed for easier movement of the [[goblinoid]] war bands, though some were large enough for even an [[ogre]].",
        "Geography": "The fortress was situated amongst the northern slopes of Rashemen's [[High Country]].",
        "Government": "As of its final year standing as a fortress of Rashemen, the citadel was ruled by [[Yegar|Lord Yegar]].\n\nAfter its destruction, the ruins were claimed by the [[durthan]] [[Chaul]], a powerful [[annis]] hag and terrible foe of the [[Wychlaran]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the citadel was overrun by the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] when they invaded the nation of Rashemen. While the main invasion force continued deeper into the country, 5,000 attackers were left behind to lay siege to the citadel. The defending troops held out for three months into the [[1360 DR|following year]], but finally succumbed to the Tuigan besiegers. The horde slew everyone remaining within the fortress, and leveled every last structure.\n\nAfter the citadel's destruction, raiders from the [[High Country]] ransacked and looted villages in eastern Rashemen completely unimpeded.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "''Circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], local rumors circulated about fantastic treasures found within the depths of the citadel, along with the helpless [[spirit]]s that roamed its ruins without purpose.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Dendurg|Dendurg Two-Axe]], the [[ogre]] bodyguard of [[Chaul]].\n* [[Vorshk|Vorshk the Worm]], a powerful goblin spellcaster."
