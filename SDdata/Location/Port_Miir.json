        "mainbody": "Port Miir was a city located in southeastern Anauroch.\nThe city was a relatively lawless trading hub that served to connect Anauroch and the lands west to those lands east of the Desertsmouth Mountains.\nPort Miir was on the southeast shore of Lake Miir at the foot of the western Desertsmouth Mountains. It was located at the western end of Berothirs Trail.\nA loosely aligned cabal of wizards were nominally in charge of law and order in the city, but it was all they could do to curb the worst excesses of the thieves living there.\nBerothirs Trail stretched from Port Miir to Shadowdale, which was the main artery of trade in and out of the city. Port Miir was known for its moneylenders and the numerous caravans entering and leaving town."
