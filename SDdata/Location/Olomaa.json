The Zhents fortification at the oasis was rather bare-bones, consisting of a stone house, a small pasture, and a fountain for water. Their lone amenities came in the form of a handful of bathing pools. \nOlomaa was located in the northwestern stretch of the Sword, some ways southwest of the Dragons Back Peaks. \nThe oasis was rich a variety of flora, including frankincense trees and other varieties that produced fruit. \nOlomaa was encircled by trench that held a great number of enormous cacti that offered some natural protection from animals or outsiders. Hidden beneath the trench were a number of man-made traps involved blades that would spring out from beneath the sands when triggered. \nCirca the midâ€“14 century DR, the camp at Olomaa was home to only a few Zhentilar warriors, a single priest of Cyric, and most notably, the beholder Xualahuu."
