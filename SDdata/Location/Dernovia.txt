Dernovia was a village in Rashemen.
Dernovia was located not far from the shores of Lake Ashane. Other geographical features in the vicinity were Snowcat Mountain and White Rusalka Vale, a dead-magic zone on the shores of Lake Ashane to all but Rashemi witches. The Warrens were a network of caves and tunnels nearby.
Dernovia was a walled village surrounded by grain fields and cattle. Just outside the village walls was a house on a hill that housed Stanislor the butcher, who had cheated customers and was thus "exiled" from the village.
In 1361 DR, Dernovia had thirteen wychlaran, of which Zofia Othlor was the eldest. Other witches at the time included Anya, whose mother was Fraeni, who had been a friend of Sylune, the Witch of Shadowdale.
