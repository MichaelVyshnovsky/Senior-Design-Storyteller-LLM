'''Dernovia''' was a village in [[Rashemen]].

==Geography==
Dernovia was located not far from the shores of [[Lake Ashane]]. Other geographical features in the vicinity were [[Snowcat Mountain]] and [[White Rusalka Vale]], a [[dead-magic zone]] on the shores of Lake Ashane to all but Rashemi witches. The [[Warrens (Rashemen)|Warrens]] were a network of caves and tunnels nearby.

==Description==
Dernovia was a walled village surrounded by grain fields and cattle. Just outside the village walls was a house on a hill that housed [[Stanislor]] the butcher, who had cheated customers and was thus "exiled" from the village.

==History==
In [[1361 DR]], Dernovia had thirteen [[wychlaran]], of which [[Zofia]] Othlor was the eldest. Other witches at the time included [[Anya]], whose mother was [[Fraeni]], who had been a friend of [[Sylune]], the Witch of Shadowdale.

==Places of interest==
