        "mainbody": "The '''Green Glade''' was a clearing in the [[Ardeep Forest]] surrounded by exceptionally tall and massive [[elm]] trees ''circa'' the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]]. A climate of perpetual springtime was one of its unusual properties.{{Cite dragon/270/The New Adventures of Volo: The Ardeep|93-94}}",
        "Geography": "Located in the southeast quadrant of the forest, the Green Glade was difficult to find because any trail blazed in the vicinity reverted back to the typical thickets of [[fern]] overnight.",
        "Defenses": "This magical area was protected by a minor ''[[mythal]]'' that kept the glade under a ''[[hallow]]'' effect that provided ''[[protection from evil]]''.",
        "Properties": "The ''mythal'' also enhanced all [[:Category:Healing spells|healing spells]]. In particular, ''[[neutralize poison]]'' and ''[[cure disease]]'' were both completely effective in curing the disease form of [[lycanthropy]]; minor healing spells also cured ''[[feeblemind]]''; and deafness, blindness, and parasitic infections were all cured when the appropriate spell was cast.\n\n[[Elves]] felt an immediate and strong sense of peace and tranquility when they stepped into the Green Glade; non-elves could sense it too, but not to the same degree. Non-magical wooden items quickly started to sprout roots and leaves after entering the glen, including things like (non-magical) [[dagger]] handles, [[bow]]s, or wooden [[scroll]] cases. If used judiciously, this effect could repair wooden items that were cracked or possibly broken.",
        "History": "The Green Glade was created in the days of the [[Illefarn]] nation and remained intact over the centuries.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Those that were not aware of the Glade's history or the existence of ''mythals'' usually attributed the place to be sacred to one [[deity]] or another, and typically named the area after their chosen deity."
