These sleeping sarrukh were venerated as gods by the spirit nagas, who anxiously awaited the awaking.\nIn the , an adventuring band called the Talons of Timindar unexpectedly discovered Yornars Trail Companion, a moon-shaped spellbook sacred to Mielikki, within the ruins of Ilimar, after battling the nagas, lamia, and spiders. Oddly, they found it hovering in the air in the middle of a tower-top room that was scorched by flame, with broken windows and broken bodies all around, as if blasted by an explosion, possibly a fireball spell."
