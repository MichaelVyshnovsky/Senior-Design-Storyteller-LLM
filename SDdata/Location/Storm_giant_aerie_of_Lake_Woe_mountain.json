        "Description": {
            "Defenses": "To creatures unable to fly, there was only one safe path down into the aerie from the steep ledges at the peak of Mount Woe. A massive gatehouse towered over a path leading from this passage in the rock toward the palace, but it was never guarded.\n\nThe palace complex also included two watchtowers, which were so high that one could see over the clouds and down into the valley below."
        },
        "Culture": {
            "Government": "The tribe of the aerie was ruled by a [[paramount]], who was the most powerful giant in the local [[ordning (social structure)|''ordning'']]. Otherwise, the giants there paid little attention to matters of rank, in stark contrast to their other kin.\n\nBecause they believed so strongly in predestination, they did not make challenges to assume the role of paramount, and they thought that coveting such a position was a useless ambition. Instead, they relied on the appearance of sacred omens to determine when it was time for a paramount to step down and a new one to lead."
        },
        "History": "During the War of the Hart, [[Hartkiller]] came to this aerie\n\nAfter the end of the battle, the tribe of the aerie realized that they had betrayed Annam All-Father. The new paramount issued a decree that none of the giants of the aerie was permitted to set foot on the surface world again until Annam redeemed them for their great sin.\n\nIn [[1354 DR]], the reigning paramount stepped down when a dove landed on another giant's shoulder during the beginning of a large feast. This second giant became the next paramount.\n\nIn [[1364 DR]], a feast was held in honor of one of the storm giants named [[Ramos]], who was of second rank in the ''ordning'' at the time. During the festival, the sun shone for the first time in ten years, and this was seen as a sign that Ramos was to replace the current paramount&mdash;the one who had been \"chosen\" by the dove&mdash;as the new leader.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], [[Anastes]] had replaced Ramos as paramount. The [[titan]] [[Lanaxis]] summoned the tribe, and six of them heeded his call.",
        "Inhabitants": "By 1366 DR, only twelve storm giants and their servants occupied the aerie, unless they were being visited by cloud giants.\n\nThese giants included:\n* Ramos\n* Anastes\n* [[Nikol]]\n* [[Eusebius]]\n* [[Sebastion]]\n* [[Patma]]"
