Sarr was a tiny island in the Pirate Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
Sarr was found in the southern region of the Pirate Isles due south of Mirg Isle and Telfar.
A single ruined lighthouse sat on Sarrs eastern tip, crumbling and laying half-buried in the sand.
The island was exposed to harsh storms approaching the Pirate Isles from the south, causing most pirates to ignore it.
Unbeknownst to the pirates, a magical artifact called the Beacon of Light was buried within the ruins of the lighthouse.
