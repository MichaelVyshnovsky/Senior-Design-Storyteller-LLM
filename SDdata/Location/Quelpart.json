        "mainbody": "The '''Quelpart''' was an island and fortress lying between [[Kang Bay]] and the [[Sea of Kozakura]], off the coast of the [[Koryo Peninsula]]. It was important to the defense of [[Koryo]], particularly against [[Kozakura]], being the staging area of the kingdom's entire armada.<ref group=\"note\">Like many sites in Koryo, Quelpart shares a name with a real-world counterpart: [[Wikipedia:Jeju Island|Jeju]], an island and province of Korea that was given the Dutch name \"Quelpart\". In the Realms, Quelpart shares this origin with the island of [[Saishu]] and the settlement of [[Cheju]].\n\nThe fortress and armada depended on daily barges via the [[Tenasu Ferry]] from the nearby city of [[Tu Pe]] for supplies. The city could support Quelpart for up to two months if under siege."
