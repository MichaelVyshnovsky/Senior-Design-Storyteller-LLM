The Salt Jungle was a sprawling woodland region found in East Zakhara.
The Salt Jungle was roughly nestled between Al-Iltifat River to the west and Al-Zilla River to the east, with some overlap on either side. The jungle abutted the coast of both the Foreigners Sea and a small portion of the Crowded Sea. The jungle was protected from the harsh climate of the Haunted Lands by an unnamed mountain range that was split by Al-Iltifat.
The Salt Jungle was fairly large, covering several hundred square miles in every direction.
