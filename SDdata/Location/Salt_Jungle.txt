The '''Salt Jungle''' was a sprawling woodland region found in [[East Zakhara]].

==Geography==
The Salt Jungle was roughly nestled between [[Al-Iltifat River]] to the west and [[Al-Zilla River]] to the east, with some overlap on either side. The jungle abutted the coast of both the [[Foreigners' Sea]] and a small portion of the [[Crowded Sea]]. The jungle was protected from the harsh climate of the [[Haunted Lands]] by an unnamed mountain range that was split by Al-Iltifat.

==Description==
The Salt Jungle was fairly large, covering several hundred square miles in every direction.
