These strange trees were somehow connected to the thirteen red, pentagonal pyramids found at the center of the ruins of [[Ascore]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|title=Pyramids under Ascore|author=Jackson Starky|topicid=5851|postid=293561|whichpage=5|date=2010-04-16|accessdate=2017-05-18}}",
        "History": "Karse was founded by the [[Cult of Karsus]] shortly after [[Karsus's Folly]] in [[-298 DR]].  It was located in the High Forest at the base of a \"tall butte of red stone\" which was thought by the cultists to be the remains of [[Karsus]] himself.\n\nThe city of Karse was reduced to rubble by the Cult of Karsus itself just ten years after its founding due to internal strife sown by the [[lich]] [[Wulgreth (Netheril)|Wulgreth of Netheril]], as revenge against Karsus for transforming him into a lich. Wulgreth then moved into the remains of the city to ensure that it would not be rebuilt.\n\nAround one thousand years later, a wizard from [[Ascalhorn]] (who, ironically, was also named [[Wulgreth (Ascalhorn)|Wulgreth]]), fled to the ruins of Karse as demons destroyed Ascalhorn as well as the nearby kingdoms of [[Eaerlann]] and [[Ammarindar]]. He only brought along his man-at-arms, [[Jhingleshod]] the Iron Axeman. Once Jingleshod found out that Wulgreth intended to summon an army of [[undead]] from the ruins of Karse to battle the demons, he attacked Wulgreth. Unfortunately, Jingleshold's timing could not have been worse, as Wulgreth was in the midst of casting a powerful spell. The necromantic energy released by the spell not only transformed Wulgreth into a lich, but also infected the surrounding forest, which came to be known as the [[Dire Wood]]. Wulgreth of Ascalhorn's essence was contained in the item later known as the [[Karsestone]]."
