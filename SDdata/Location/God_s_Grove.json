        "History": "The God's Grove had a long history in Wheloon, older even than the [[Wyvern Ferry Route]].\n\nBy [[1358 DR]], its caretaker was [[Orlenstar Thirlthorn]], He held the position through [[1367 DR]] and 1369 DR. He was still caretaker by [[1374 DR]].",
        "Services": "In addition to the worship of Silvanus, the God's Grove had a variety of uses, and every Whelunian knew where it was. It was a popular spot for picnics and weddings, and children were always welcome to play there. People also took injured and sick animals to Orlenstar for his ministration. Orlenstar also kept a constant store of healing [[goodberry|goodberries]], as well as his homebrew [[spruce beer]].\n\nAlthough Orlenstar was officially caretaker of the shrine and grove, many Whelunians also pitched in to maintain and beautify the site, since it was so important to them.",
