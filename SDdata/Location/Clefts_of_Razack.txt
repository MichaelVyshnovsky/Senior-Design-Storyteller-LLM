The '''Clefts of Razack''', also known as '''Razack's Scar''', was a long gorge that wound through central [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} 

==Description==
The Clefts were made up of a main gorge that wound through the highlands of central Vaasa with many smaller canyons branching off of it. The icy waters of the [[Beaumaris River]] ran through the main gorge {{SI|500|feet}} below the top. 

The cliffs along the river provided ideal homes and delves for monsters such as [[goblinoids]] and [[minotaurs]]. 

==Geography==
The gorge traveled for over 60 miles (96.6 kilometers) from the [[Bottomless Bogs]] in northwestern Vaasa towards [[Nigel's Ford]] in eastern Vaasa, bisecting the realm's highlands into the arid [[Cinnabar Wastes]] in the north and the [[Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen]] in the south.

The upper part of the canyon also served as the path of [[Dead Man's Walk]], the primary trail through Vaasa, as it went from [[Moortown]] to [[Kond]] along the southern side of the river.<ref group="note">While the location of "Deadman Pass" is not specified in the short story ''[[Realms_of_Shadow#Darksword|Darksword]]'', it is implied to be on the eastern side of the Bottomless Bogs. The story describes [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] having entered the Bottomless Bogs via Deadman Pass on his way to the [[Anauroch]].

The only span across the canyon was a bridge that connected Dead Man's Walk to [[Telos (city)|Telos City]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Legend stated that [[Razack]] was an elder [[titan]] lord who cut the great canyon open with his mighty axe during the [[Dawn Age|Age of Giants]].
