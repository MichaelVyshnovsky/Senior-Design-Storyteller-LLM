The Clefts of Razack, also known as Razacks Scar, was a long gorge that wound through central Vaasa. 
The Clefts were made up of a main gorge that wound through the highlands of central Vaasa with many smaller canyons branching off of it. The icy waters of the Beaumaris River ran through the main gorge  below the top. 
The cliffs along the river provided ideal homes and delves for monsters such as goblinoids and minotaurs. 
The gorge traveled for over 60 miles (96.6 kilometers) from the Bottomless Bogs in northwestern Vaasa towards Nigels Ford in eastern Vaasa, bisecting the realms highlands into the arid Cinnabar Wastes in the north and the Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen in the south.
The upper part of the canyon also served as the path of Dead Mans Walk, the primary trail through Vaasa, as it went from Moortown to Kond along the southern side of the river.While the location of "Deadman Pass" is not specified in the short story Darksword, it is implied to be on the eastern side of the Bottomless Bogs. The story describes Melegaunt Tanthul having entered the Bottomless Bogs via Deadman Pass on his way to the Anauroch.
The only span across the canyon was a bridge that connected Dead Mans Walk to Telos City.
Legend stated that Razack was an elder titan lord who cut the great canyon open with his mighty axe during the Age of Giants.
