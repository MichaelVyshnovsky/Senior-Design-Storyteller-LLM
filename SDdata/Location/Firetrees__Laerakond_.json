        "Description": "The fortress was located in a scorched land of tumbled stones, amid a forest of burned tree trunks and fire-blackened rocks where no new plants could grow, hence its name. The fortress was enveloped in a powerful magic that warped the senses, abilities, and shapes of any living creatures, and mysterious eerie lights drifted about its ruins.",
        "Inhabitants": "Terrible monsters plagued the land and scholars also believed the place was cursed with a mysterious sentient [[spell]]. Unknown to most people, a few tribes of [[dragonborn]] also lived in the subterranean ruins of Firetrees since centuries before the [[Spellplague]].",
        "History": "The fortress was built by [[dwarves]] in the ancient past of the world of [[Abeir]], and originally was named Durlyndbold. When a sentient spell appeared and began to spread a plague that rotted flesh, the dwarves abandoned Durlyndbold and scattered across Abeir.\n\nThe fortress was later reclaimed by the [[gold dragon]] [[Raurokhymdhar]], who renamed it Raurokh and transformed it into a dragonborn prison and a laboratory to create more slaves. Among the dragonborn who lived in Raurokh was the legendary hero [[Shasphur]].\n\nAfter the death of Raurokhymdhar, only a few scattered tribes of dragonborn remained in \nRaurokh, and the fortress was abandoned and mostly forgotten. Eventually, the people of Eskorn began to call the place Firetrees.",
