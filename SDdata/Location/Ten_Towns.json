The communities of the Ten Towns attracted those people of Faer√ªn determined to find a life for themselves, and those desperate to leave their former lives behind.\nWhile life within each community exemplified diligence and partnership, relations between each of the communities demonstrated the fierce competitive spirit that was needed to survive in the North.\nThe Shaengarne river extended west from the Ten Towns, through the dales western tundras.\nThe Ten Towns were formed around the three lakes of Icewind Dale, Redwaters, Lac Dinneshere, and Maer Dualdon. \nSituated northwest of Redwaters, the smallest of the lakes, were fittingly enough the smallest villages, Dougans Hole and Good Mead. To the north was Lac Dinneshere, upon the shores of which sat the settlements of Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig. Some  west was the largest and deepest of the lakes, Maer Dualdon, around which were situated the towns of Lonelywood (along with its namesake forest), Bremen, Termalaine, and the walled city of Targos.\nBetween Lac Dinneshere and Maer Dualdon was the massive solitary peak of Kelvins Cairn. a deep chasm that housed a number of dwarf clans.\nSouthwest of the valley, nestled between all three lakes,\nOfficial decisions for the towns were made by a council consisting of one influential member from each town. These council members, called speakers, met in the council building in Bryn Shander, which was unanimously recognized as the capital of the Ten Towns, and of Icewind Dale itself, once a month during the summer season, and once every three in the winter.\n14 Century\nAround the time of the Battle of Icewind Dale, the council consisted of the following individuals\n* Dougans Hole - Freya Grynstead\n* Good Mead - Unknown\n* Easthaven - Glensather\n* Caer-Dineval - Jensin Brent\n* Caer-Konig - Schermont\n* Lonelywood - Muldoon\n* Bremen - Gil Haerngen\n* Termalaine - Agorwal\n* Targos - Kemp\n* Bryn Shander - Cassius\nIn the years leading up to the battle, other individuals served as spokesmen on the council, such as the halfling Regis, and Dorim Lugar, who was killed over a fish. under the leadership of King Revjak.\n15 Century\nAs of the , the council comprised the following individuals\n* Dougans Hole - Edgra Durmoot\n* Good Mead - Kendrick Rielsbarrow\n* Easthaven - Danneth Waylen\n* Caer-Dineval - Crannoc Siever\n* Caer-Konig - Alden Lowell\n* Lonelywood - Avandro Perth\n* Bremen - Dorbulgruf Shalescar\n* Termalaine - Shaelen Masthew\n* Targos - Giandro Holfast\n* Bryn Shander - Duvessa Shane\nThe fishing and sale of knucklehead trout, along with the scrimshaw made from its bones, was the industry that allowed the Ten Towns to remain in existence for as many years as they have. Each of the lakeside settlements maintained their own fleet of fishing ships.\nDespite some timbering industry in Lonelywood, the Ten Towns had to import much of the wood they used for construction and warmth.\nThe Ten Town began from single community, founded by the Dinev family of Cormyr, at the shore of Lac Dinneshere.\nthumb|250px|Marek (second from left) and an associate conversing at a market.\nThe Ten Towns attracted those who were brave and hard-working enough to set out for a harsh life they could call their own. Among these were prospectors, miners,, treasure-hunters, and other industrious, but sometimes less-reputable folks. Fugitives often came to the Ten Towns to flee their troubles, only to find a life of hard work ahead of them. Some petty criminals, and other agents serving malevolent forces, settled within the communities.\nDwarves stayed within their nearby holds and underground halls.\nMany of the folks from Caer-Konig and Bremen traced their ancestry to clans of the Reghedmen tribesmen that once dwelled within those settlements."
