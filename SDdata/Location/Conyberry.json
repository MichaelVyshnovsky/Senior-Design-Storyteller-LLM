        "mainbody": "onyberry was a small farming village on the eastern edge of Neverwinter Wood.\nConyberry consisted of around a dozen houses standing close to the eastern side of Neverwinter Wood, sheltering within the forest edge like many such villages in the area. The neighboring homesteads and farms extended east and south, separated by a small cart track leading to Triboar.\nPeople in Conyberry cut trees from the forest only when required. For food, they hunted in the forests fringes, such as snaring rabbits, and grew crops. They also sought trade with any travelers who came through the area. Mostly self-sufficient, they bought linens, clothes, dishes, and cooking wares from traveling peddlers.\nFor being a community of farmers, Conyberry was well organized for defending itself. The village and surrounding farms could muster about 140 fighters, who were very skilled with bows and slings.\nThe village was famous for the magical grove that was home to the elven banshee named Agatha.\nDespite trolls and bandits dwelling in the hills to the south, travelers found it faster to pass them and journey through Conyberry, in any season but winter. A harsh winter, also known in the region as \"wolf weather\", caused hungry wolves to enter the community and raid food stores and coops.\nConyberry was also home for several good-enough carpenters, Martin von Mensch the bladesmith, and two brewers who fermented disgusting beers.\nIn the , the Companions of the Hall, Drizzt DoUrden and Wulfgar the barbarian, entered the small community in order to procure Agathas mask from the Ghost of Neverwinter Woods lair. After being confronted by the townsfolk, who defended Agatha as their own, the heroes proceeded to take the mask from the banshees grove without harming her.\nDuring the Spellplague, parts of Conyberry were exchanged with parts of the equivalent region on Abeir, destroying most of the town and the surrounding lands. Survivors from Conyberry allowed the few Abeirans who survived the travel from their world to Toril to live with them, and for a time the new mixed community thrived.\nHowever, members of the Uthgardt Gray Wolf Tribe, out of fear of the Spellplague, saw the Abeirans as \"evil invaders\" and the folk of Conyberry as their \"supporters\", and a few decades after the Spellplague attacked the town as a retribution for the \"Abeiran invasion\", forcing the survivors of the attack to join their tribe.\nWhile the Gray Wolfs maintained their alliance with the Netherese, Conyberry was used by the Gray Wolfs as a place to store supplies and as a training grounds, but after the Netherese were destroyed, the barbarians abandoned the town and left it laying in ruins.\n* Agathas Grove\n* Berun Care\n* Conyberry Arms\n* Conyberry Hall\n* The Shrine of Savras\n* Temple of Waukeen, a small gilded temple dedicated to Waukeen, built in the early 1374 DR.\n* Wandering Woodsmans Tavern, a quaint inn and tavern that catered to locals and travelers alike circa 1374 DR."
