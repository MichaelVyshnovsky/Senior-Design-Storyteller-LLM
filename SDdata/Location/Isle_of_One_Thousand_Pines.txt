The '''Isle of One Thousand Pines''' was one of the [[Outer Isles]] of [[Wa]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. It was considered part of [[Jasuga Province]]. It was a densely forested place&mdash;hence, its name.

The island was the site of a prison colony for Wa, until the prisoners were relocated to [[Ibhei]], a larger island. The prison was abandoned and left to fall to ruins.

[[Kazuo Tokuri]] was the last prisoner to be held on the Isle. He was nephew to the former shogun, [[Matasuuri Shogoro]], and had been framed for planning a coup. He died there, and his spirit was said to still linger in the ruins of the prison by [[1357 DR]].
