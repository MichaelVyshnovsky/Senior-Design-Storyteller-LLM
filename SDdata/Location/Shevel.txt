'''Shevel''' was the greatest of [[Rashemen]]'s trading cities that lay on the great [[Golden Way]]. As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was the largest settlement in the entire country.

==Description==
Shevel was distinctly different from other [[Rashemaar]] settlements in that it did not have the typical stone dwellings built within burrowed hills. Rather it featured a number of wooden buildings that were protected by a large stone wall.

The various districts within the city each housed populations that largely hailed from from the same ethnic background, including [[Damaran]]s, [[Kara-tur]]ans, [[Mulhorandi]], and even one predominantly occupied by [[shield dwarves]].

==Geography==
It was located between the cities of [[Taporan]] and [[Thasunta]], south of the [[Urlingwood]]. 

==Trade==
Traders came to Shevel from a great number of nearby locales including [[Mulhorand]], [[Semphar]], and the [[Hordelands]].

Shevel was one of two cities in Rashemen, along with [[Mulptan]], where foreigners could establish a permanent residence.

==History==
Following the demise of [[Citadel Rashemar]], Shevel and local caravanners both faced increasing attacks from both bandits and other malevolent people in the region.
