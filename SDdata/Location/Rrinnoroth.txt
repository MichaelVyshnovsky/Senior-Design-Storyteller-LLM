'''Rrinnoroth''' was a settlement located within the [[dwarven]] realm of [[Shanatar]]. It was a ghost town by {{Yearlink|1372}}.

==Geography==
The ruins of Rrinnoroth were located beneath the [[Kuldin Peaks]] which were located in the surface realm of [[Tethyr]]. One of the only access points to the ruins of [[Drakkalor]] was down a tunnel which began in Rrinnoroth.

==Inhabitants==
The former dwarven settlement was now devoid of all life. It's sole occupant was the mighty [[red dragon]] [[Charvekkanathor]]. He used the ruins of Rrinnoroth as his lair and where he stored his treasure hoard. As a result, the ruins where heavily guarded with explosive traps and ''[[teleportation]]'' wards.

==Trivia==
Rrinnoroth, in the [[Dwarvish dictionary|Dwarven language]], meant "place over enemy land".
