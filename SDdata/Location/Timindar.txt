Timindar was a small frontier town in Chondath, built as a logging operation on the edge of Satyrwood.
Timindar never got an opportunity to grow as it was razed only seven years after being established. By the late 14 century DR, Timindar was nothing but a lonely ruin at the edge of the forest that stood along the Old Road, that stretched from Shamph to Elbulder and continued further south. Several stone structures still stood in the long-looted ruins, which saw very few visitors besides the most desperate of adventurers. Those who did visit the town told stories of ghosts wandering the ruins.
The towns of Timindar and Orbech were established in the  by decree of the ruling Illistine family. Timindar conducted greedy and ambitious logging in Chondalwood to the ire of Ariton Maliwick, the Grand Druid of Gulthmere. A stern warning was issued to Chondath but Timindars logging continued until the Battle of Fallen Trees of the . Timindar and Orbech were destroyed in the battle by the elves of Satyrwood while survivors fled to Shamph. The Battle of Fallen Trees was a retaliation and another warning to deter humans from encroaching on the elven homelands.
