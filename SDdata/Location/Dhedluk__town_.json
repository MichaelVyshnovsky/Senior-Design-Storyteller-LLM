        "mainbody": "hedluk () was a village in the Kings Forest of Cormyr. \nDhedluk was a beautiful village of about 100 rustic cottages interspersed with gardens, dappled by sunlight reaching down through the eaves of gigantic mossy trees. It was a popular place for nobles and Purple Dragons to retire to, which was why a small stone and timber hut could be sold for upwards of 16,000 golden lions.\nDhedluk lay in the heart of the Kings Forest, with the Rangers Way linking it to Waymoot in the southwest and Starwater Road leading north to Eveningstar and south to Immersea.\nThe expansion of cleared land was severely curtailed and regulated, so little logging took place. The local business was mostly made up of skilled woodcarvers and herbalists who took advantage of the woodlands and bogs around the village, with some minor farming and gardening in the available space. Three quail ranches and a boobrie farm were also in operation in the 1360s DR, with boobries wandering the area freely hunting snakes and vermin.\nBy the 14 century DR, the cutting of live wood without authorization was considered a severe crime, eventually being punished by hanging.\nThe village was protected by a wooden stockade and a local militia.\nDhedluk was orginally named after and ruled by the Dheolur noble family who lived there. The family was eventually disbanded after opposing the Crown one too many times. A local woodsman by the name of Dhedluk was made lord of the village in recognition of his loyalty, and the name changed to match his. Despite this, decades later it continued to be known as Dheolur by those from particularly isolated parts of the realm.\nIn 1369 DR, the events of Halasters Higharvestide resulted in a tribe of kobolds, led by Vhue, coming to reside in the thick forest about half a day east of Dhedluk. Their existence remained secret, as the few who stumbled across them were slain.\nBy 1479 DR, those who were caught cutting live wood were hanged on the defunct portal arch nearby.\n* The Blushing Maiden Inn, run by the Kings Lord Thiombar.\n* A two-way portal just outside the town, linked to the Royal Court in Suzail.\n* Thiombar, retired adventurer, lord of Dhedluk and innkeeper of the Blushing Maiden.\n* Ildul Stonegiant, Thiombars herald.\n* Dhedluk\n* Astergullph Daeryn, a sage.\n* The Huntsilver noble family maintained holdings in Dhedluk.\nThe following groups operated around Dhedluk in the 1360s DR\n* The Women of the Woods outlaws.\n* The High Hunt cult.\n* Orcs displaced from Arabel during the Goblin War."
