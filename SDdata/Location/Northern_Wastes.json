            "Hengeyokai": "[[Hengeyokai]] appeared all over Kara-Tur, but their society flourished in the wild lands of the Ama Basin. They often became defenders of the human tribes.",
            "Korobokuru": "Quite common in these lands were the [[korobokuru]], with villages scattered around all [[Ama Basin]]. Each village was independent but often on friendly terms with its neighbors. Usually, each village was ruled by a leader and two deputies, all elected by the tribal elders. These three leaders declared laws, made judgements, and punished the guilty. The three leaders were in turn controlled by the elders who represented the people. The death penalty was never applied in korobokoru society; punishments usually involved beating, exile, or psychological pain.\n\nMany human outsiders believed that the korobokuru were wild tribes who lived in savage lands. Many korobokuru women [[tattoo]]ed their hands and faces with blue [[ink]], which many outsiders found frightful, particular southerners.\n\nKorobokuru life was quite difficult, and they worked hard just to survive. They lived in small villages, and grew vegetables, hunted, and fished. When they had the time, they regaled each other with stories and songs around the campfire, and danced, play games, and drank beer. Most korobokuru were peaceful and did not come into conflict. Favorite weapon of the korobokuru living in the Northern Wastes were the [[axe]], [[club]], [[knife]], spring bow (a device similar to the [[Crossbow#Light crossbow|light crossbow]] used for deer hunting), and [[sword]]. They wore clothing made ​​of animal wool.",
            "Maraloi": "The [[Maraloi]] were a legendary race who once ruled the land around the ​​[[Ama Basin]]. This race was very strong and powerful, used bronze weapons and possessed powerful magic. In the Pazruk language, Maraloi meant \"ancient lords\". They were known to be special enemies of the [[oni]], [[ogre mage|ogre magi]], and lesser [[humanoids]] and they are quite successful in their dominance until [[iron]] became common in the Ama Basin. Nothing was known of what happened to this ancient race, but their ruins stood in the Koryaz Mountains.",
            "Spirit Folk": "In the rivers of the Northern Wastes were often found [[spirit folk]]. What they did and their aims, no one could say. However, these spirits were often worshiped by native tribes desiring a good catch or to avert a flood.\n\nThe most famous of the folk spirit was [[Lasishal Ama]], who lived within the [[Ama River]], the source of her vitality. She aided heroes and was a scourge of those who ruined the land.",
            "Foreigners": "These lands were a destination of many adventurers and explorers in Kara-Tur, and many exiles and fugitives also fled here, as it was an inhospitable land. Fur traders, merchants, and miners of the Koryaz Mountains made up the rest of the foreign visitors, as well as a few [[Kensai|kensai masters]] and [[wu jen]] hermits."

        "Shamanism": {
            "Korobokuru Shamanism": "[[Korobokuru]] society did not have priests at all, as all religious services were performed by heads of their households. However, some members of korobokuru society had magical powers like wu jen, although the korobokuru called them [[tusu]]. Tusu often fulfilled the role of shamans and were almost all women."
        },
        "Social Customs": "The tribes of the Northern Wastelands had a huge number of taboos and superstitions, varying by nation, tribe, clan, or person. For example, in the Wu-haltai believed that if fishermen were to catch an overly large fish, then it should be immediately thrown back, because it belonged to the Lord of the Sea or the Guardians of Rivers. People claimed that the person who broke a taboo would suffer bad luck.",
