        "mainbody": "'''Glantri''', also known as the '''Kingdom of Magic''', was a powerful [[magocratic]] nation on the world of [[Mystara]] that on more than one occasion had been visited by individuals from [[Faerûn]] and other worlds.\n\n{{Quote|A realm where only crazy old [[wizard]]s with no business ruling are considered nobility. That's Glantri. I can't believe they have lasted this long.|Joshuan Gallidox, a [[halfling]] [[adventurer]].<ref>}}",
        "Geography": "Monsters normally considered rare on Mystara were abundant throughout the nation due to countless magical [[summon]]ings over the years. Out of all these monsters, notably [[lycanthrope]]s and [[vampire]]s were accepted members of society throughout most of the nation.",
        "Government": "Glantri was a magocratic nation divided into 13 principalities, semi-independent realms that were each governed by a wizard-prince and their noble house. These wizard-princes each specialized in their own form of magic, which expressed their culture in unique and magical ways. They determined the laws in their respective domains, but ruled the nation together as a council, called the Council of Princes. They assembled at Glantri City to conduct the administration of the nation. All decisions of the Council of Princes were decided by a vote. Whenever a tie occurred, or less than six princes were available for a vote, a judiciary body known as the Parliament (or \"House of Lords\") was assembled to vote upon the decision.\n\nMystarans outside of Glantri considered its government to be rather devious, clandestine, and rife with treachery. However, its council of wizard princes were united by an aim to promote [[arcane magic]] and make it the leading power in the world of Mystara,<ref> leading most people to believe they had the most advanced and powerful wizards.\n\nPracticing arcane magic in Glantri required a license,<ref> whilst most [[divine magic]] was outlawed alongside organized religion. These bans, as well as the close monitoring of religious orders, were rooted in a fear that they posed a threat to the dominance of arcane power in the nation and its perceived importance. Laws eventually relaxed to allow for the clerical magics of ''[[create food or water]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[cure wounds]]'', and ''[[remove curse]]''. Others form of clerical magic and open religious practice, such as discussing the tenants of a known doctrine, were punishable with heavy fines. Repeat offenders would be punished with imprisonment or even death.\n\nThere were a few other offenses in the nation that were \"punishable by death\".<ref> For example, having [[lycanthropy]] was once such an offense, until the Council of Princes repealed the law in all but two principalities.",
        "Trade": "The primary exports of the nation's various principalities were agricultural and mineral products. Most towns focused on producing one specific form of commodity, be it food, metal, or crafted items.\n\nThe nation taxed its citizens four times per year, with the vast amount of wealth accumulated by the principalities going towards the Great School of Magic, particularly its many licensing fees and the taxes that were places upon [[magical item]]s and spellcastings. Failure to pay taxes was considered a crime like unto treason.",
        "Society": "The principalities of Glantri were primarily made up of [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[human]]s. Lycanthropes, vampires, and similar such [[shapechanger]]s were relatively accepted in most of Glantrian society, with the rising of a \"were-fad\" and a romantic reputation for vampirism. Many wizards considered [[undead]] servants both fashionable and useful. And more so than other parts of the Known World, Glantrians tolerated [[gnoll]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s and [[half-orc]]s, and [[troll]]s. The thirteenth principality, New Kolland, was populated almost exclusively by these [[humanoid]]s.\n\nGlanti overall had a higher population of wizards than neighboring lands. Whereas those lands would have one wizard per 5,000 people, an estimated 1 in 200 Glantrians were wizards. In the nation's capital, this ratio became 1 in 7.\n\nThese people were divided into two societal classes, the noble Upper Class and Lower Class. Neither one's race, nor [[alignment]], determined their status in society, but rather one's ability to wield arcane magic. The nobility was primarily made up of wizards, with the rest being relatives of wizards and a few aristocrats that had found ways to attain their status without ties magic. Additionally, [[priest]]s comprised a special, restricted social class.",
        "History": "On more than one occasion, instances of planar travel occurred between Glantri and [[Aebrynis]], another world in the [[multiverse]] that had interactions with [[Toril]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/111/A Kingdom for Every Player|16}}\n\nAt some point in history, some [[magical item]] was stolen from the [[planeswalker|planeswalking]] Faerûnian wizard [[Elminster]] and brought to Glantri. Elminster would visit the city briefly to steal this item back, resulting in a violent altercation.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/Mystara}}\n\nAt another point, a [[Oerth]]ian planeswalking wizard [[Mordenkainen]] visited Glantri, immersing himself in its Great School of Magic and visiting its Great Library. While there he studied the Nithian Empire, a lost Mystaran civilization,<ref> and traded a rare book of Faerûnian lore to the head librarian in exchange for a Mystaran tome. Mordenkainen would later gift this book to [[Candlekeep]]'s Keeper of Tomes, eliciting a gleeful response.\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, government officials in the Faerûnian city of [[Ravens Bluff]] called for mages from the city's [[Ministry of Art]] to verify the authenticity of [[mithril]] [[coin]]s that were said to have come from Glantri,In both the sourcebooks ''Karameikos: Kingdom of Adventure'' and ''Glantri: Kingdom of Magic'' the only coin denominations listed for the nation were the [[gold piece]] \"ducat\", [[silver piece]] \"sovereign\", [[copper piece]] \"penny\", and [[platinum piece]] \"crown\". The last of these was similarly known to carry an enchantment, an effect equivalent to a ''[[rod of absorption]]''. The coins came from a mammoth tax payment done by the [[House of Desires]] to Ravens Bluff. Their authenticity was confirmed, but the presence of some minor [[enchantment]]s placed on the coins was also discovered by [[Oracle (mage)|Oracle]], the recently reinstated Minister of Divination. This event was later reported on in the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' under the headline \"Record Taxes Paid by Merchant House\".{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|1}}{{LCRB}}",
        "Notable Locations": "* '''Aalban''', a principality made famous for its [[artificer]]s and machine makers.\n* '''Belcadiz''', a principality made famous for its weaponsmithing. It was inhabited primarily by [[elves]] and [[human]]s.\n* '''Bergdhoven''', a principality made famous for its [[perfume]].\n* '''Glantri City''', the nation's capital.\n* '''Great Library of Glantri''', the library of the Great School of Magic. It held thousands of books, but rivaling the collection of Faerûn's Candlekeep.\n* '''Great School of Magic''', the largest and most famous magical academy in all of the Known World.",
        "Reputation": "Out of all the nations on Mystara, Glantri was particularly notable among [[planewalker]]s for its magic, as well as for having a fair amount of [[portal]]s and other planar accesses.<ref>"
