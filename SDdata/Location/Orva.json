        "Locations": "Much of Orva was located in what would become the Vast Swamp, which expanded greatly during the disaster. The capital of the realm was sunk beneath the southern edge of the Swamp, while [[Orvaskyte Keep]] sat ruined in the heart of the Swamp.",
        "Culture": "Orva used the [[Thorass language]] and had its own dating system, with some documents making reference to the [[Marking the years|Mulhorandi Calendar]].\n\nThe patron deity of Orva was a human aspect of [[Labelas Enoreth]] called [[Chronos]].",
        "History": "Orva's extent covered part of what would become eastern Cormyr, and the Vast Swamp was much smaller and more natural environment. Its last king was a power-hungry tyrant with delusions of grandiosity, who commanded his [[mage]]s to devise a means of expanding Orva's borders and securing the realm. In their rush to please their king and avoid execution they opened a planar gate at Orvaskyte Keep to [[Minauros]], the [[Baator]]ian plane of greed and sinking swamps.\n\nA massive explosion killed most of the [[archmage]]s present, followed by a great wind that pulled the survivors and the newly-arrived [[priest]]s into Minauros. Then, a torrent of hellish slime and ooze burst from the portal, washing over the land and expanding the Vast Swamp massively. In the process, the realm of Orva was destroyed and replaced with a nightmarish mire filled with Hell-spawned diseases and monstrosities.\n\nAlthough the gateway closed, the barrier between planes remained thin ever after and allowed temporary portals to Minauros to open and deposit more foul creatures in the ruins of Orvaskyte Keep.\n\nBy the time of the foundation of Cormyr in [[26 DR]], Orva was long forgotten. The few scattered ruins that remained were inhabited by swamp-dwelling creatures, which were sometimes delved by daring [[adventurer]]s seeking ancient treasure."
