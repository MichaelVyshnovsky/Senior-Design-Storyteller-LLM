'''Bremen''' was the westernmost of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]. It attracted all manner of [[gold]] prospectors, travelers and treasure-hunters.

==Geography==
Bremen was located on the southwestern shore of [[Maer Dualdon]], where the [[Shaengarne]] River met the lake. Bremen's position made it susceptible to flooding, although Bremenites knew the signs and lives were rarely lost because of it.

==Defense==
Circa the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Bremen could rally a meager force of about 25 soldiers.

==History==
[[File:Bremen.jpg|thumb|250px|''A map of Bremen.'']]
Bremen was originally founded by a group of [[dwarven]] prospectors.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|27}}

The town was nearly destroyed just prior to the {{YearlinkName|1312}} in the invasion of the Icewind Dale by the [[Legion of the Chimera]].<ref name="IW2> 

In {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Bremen and [[Caer-Konig]] were given to the barbarians of Icewind Dale after the war with [[Akar Kessell]]. [[Revjak]], the king of the Tribe of the Elk, served as "speaker for the barbarians" in council until his leadership was successfully challenged by [[Berkthgar]] in 1364 DR, ending the period of cooperation between the Reghed tribes and Ten-Towns.

The spokesman of the town around the {{YearlinkName|1360}} was [[Gil Haerngen]], who, like other Bremenites, had a hobby of searching for gold and treasure on the floodplains along the banks of the river.

In 1483 DR, the adventurer [[Catti-brie]] set up a home base in Bremen while waiting for her appointed rendezvous with her friends.

During the years of the [[Everlasting Rime]], Bremen offered the sacrifice of warmth to [[Auril]]. Residents of the town forewent any fires one day each month.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|21}}

==Notable Locations==
===Shops===
* [[Ewin's Trinkets]] (formerly Earvin's Treasures), a small shop that sold magical trinkets uncovered by treasure-seekers.
*Nine Knuckles, a resale shop run by Davrick Fain.

===Inns & Taverns===
*[[Buried Treasures]], a welcoming inn that catered to the many treasure-seekers that passed through town.
*[[Five Tavern Center]], a cluster of five taverns arranged on a circular gravel square. The proximity of the taverns led to outdoor bar fights nearly every night.
**The Black-Bearded Brother, one of the taverns of Five-Tavern Center.
**Even Keel, one of the taverns of Five-Tavern Center.
**The Grumpy Moose, one of the taverns of Five-Tavern Center.
**The River's Mouth, one of the taverns of Five-Tavern Center.
**[[Stones]], one of the taverns of Five-Tavern Center, a rowdy bar where travelers could often be found fighting local Bremenites.
*[[Knuckleheader]], a tavern run by [[Darby Snide]] in as of the {{YearlinkName|1483}}. Catti-brie had an agreement in which she would perform minor magical tasks in exchange for food and board when needed.

===Landmarks===
*[[Shaengarne Street]], the street lining the harbor and separating the town from the floodplains along the banks of the river.
*Statue of [[RÃ¶lph Bremen]], presumably a founder of Bremen.
*Spokesman's house and town hall.
* Wet Rock, a rocky islet in the center of the Shaengarne River, atop which sat the shack of the reclusive [[Thurdenne]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Circa the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, rumors circulated in Bremen about a "lake monster" that appeared in Maer Dualdon, that regularly attacked local fishing boats. This monster was in fact a [[plesiosaurus]], that had peacefully dwelled within the lake's waters, but was recently ''[[awaken]]ed'' by a [[Aurilian]] [[druid]] called [[Ravisin]].
