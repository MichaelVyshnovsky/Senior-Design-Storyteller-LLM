The Giants Dance was a strange circle of standing stones in northern Amn.
The circle was made of nine stones, seven of which had fallen down. Three of those that fell were cracked apart with marks that implied something clawed and scraped its way out of each one despite the lack of cavities.
The Dance was located on the south side of the western Ridge, south of Orlsfall.
