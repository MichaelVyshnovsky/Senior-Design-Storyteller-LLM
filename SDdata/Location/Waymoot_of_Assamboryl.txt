The '''waymoot of Assamboryl''' was a landmark in [[Cormanthor]].

==Geography==
It was approximately two days' north of [[Druindar's Rock]] and one day south of [[Six Thorns]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, [[Galan Goadulphyn]] left for the waymoot of Assamboryl after being injured from stray spells from the mage duel between [[Delmuth Echorn]] and [[Elminster]] in Druindar's rock. He expected the trip to take two days.
