Lyn Armaal was the cloud palace of the cloud giant Countess Sansuri.
Richly appointed, the castle was built to a gigantic scale and filled with similarly sized furniture. The castle contained all the rooms and functions necessary to house Sansuri, her family, and her servants.
Though most of the castles inhabitants were cloud giants, a few ogre servants resided in the castle. Additionally, a number of aarakocra simulacra created by Sansuri guarded the castle. Countess Sansuri kept a number of griffons in an aviary within the castle.
