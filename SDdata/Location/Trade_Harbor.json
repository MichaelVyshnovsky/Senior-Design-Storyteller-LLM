        "mainbody": "he Trade Harbor was located in Huzuz, the City of Delights, along the banks of Al-Sarif River.\nThis large harbor had enough docks to support 40 galleys or dromonds with an additional 75 cogs. All of the docks were well-maintained to accommodate the constant influx of vessels.\nA constant bustle of activity permeated every available space of the Trade Harbor. This section of Huzuz acted like a small city, with many of the thousands of workers never even leaving the area during their lifetimes.\nEach incoming ship had their wares assessed by a tax collector to determine the tax to be paid. After paying the tax, the ship was assigned a dock where they could unload their merchandise. Since the Trade Harbor was crammed at times, marids were often used to pull ships to their docks.\nMany of the wealthy merchant families employed genies, ogres, and giants to facilitate the movement of trade goods.\nSeveral platoons of the Dauntless Mamluk Society were always present around the docks to maintain security and apprehend thieves for justice."
