'''Ithal Pass''' was a fortified town in the [[Iltkazar Highlands]] in [[Tethyr]], in the southern region of County [[Surkazar]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
Once a small crossroads town supported by local dairy farmers, the city swelled in size with the influx of soldiers from the duke of [[Suretmarch]]'s army. The garrison worked to fortify the town to repel the forces of the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]], who had invaded nearby [[Kzelter]].

==Locations==
* [[Vales' Rest]]: This neglected taproom was the oldest and only inn in town, offering a warm atmosphere to its clientele.
* [[Soldiers' Slake]]: A converted barn served the military soldiers and officers while the town's wall was being built.
