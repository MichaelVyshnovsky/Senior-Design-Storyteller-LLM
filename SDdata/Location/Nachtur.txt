'''Nachtur''' was a kingdom in the [[Feywild]].

==Description==
Nachtur was considered to be a very large and powerful [[goblin]] kingdom in the Feywild. It was essentially a great cavern-city underneath the hills of a dense forest. The kingdom teemed with goblins, from brigands to patrolling [[wolf]] riders, [[mage]]s to [[priest]]s, and archers.

Great [[Gark]], the undisputed leader of the "civilized" kingdom, wished to unite all [[fey]] [[goblinoid]]s in Nachtur. He was a powerful [[hobgoblin]] [[wizard]] who was known for easily dispatching his foes. Despite Nachtur's power under Gark's rule, it was not a major threat to the [[eladrin]] of the [[Court of Stars (Feywild)|Court of Stars]]. However, the growing kingdom had to be constantly kept in check by other races of the Feywild.

Adventurers were known to serve as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to Nachtur, or be captured as slaves. If they were made to be [[slave]]s, they would work on farms, raising cattle and looking after crops. The most unfortunate, especially captured fey and children, would be eaten.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], the [[Dernall Forest]] of [[Alaron]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] was invaded by inhabitants of Nachtur. The Goblin King of Nachtur, Great Gark, sent his [[evil]] [[fey]] to the forest, to expand his kingdom to [[Toril]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|4}}
