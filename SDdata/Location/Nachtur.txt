Nachtur was a kingdom in the Feywild.
Nachtur was considered to be a very large and powerful goblin kingdom in the Feywild. It was essentially a great cavern-city underneath the hills of a dense forest. The kingdom teemed with goblins, from brigands to patrolling wolf riders, mages to priests, and archers.
Great Gark, the undisputed leader of the "civilized" kingdom, wished to unite all fey goblinoids in Nachtur. He was a powerful hobgoblin wizard who was known for easily dispatching his foes. Despite Nachturs power under Garks rule, it was not a major threat to the eladrin of the Court of Stars. However, the growing kingdom had to be constantly kept in check by other races of the Feywild.
Adventurers were known to serve as mercenaries to Nachtur, or be captured as slaves. If they were made to be slaves, they would work on farms, raising cattle and looking after crops. The most unfortunate, especially captured fey and children, would be eaten.
In 1479 DR, the Dernall Forest of Alaron in the Moonshae Isles was invaded by inhabitants of Nachtur. The Goblin King of Nachtur, Great Gark, sent his evil fey to the forest, to expand his kingdom to Toril.
