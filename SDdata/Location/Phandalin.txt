Townmaster
Phandalin was a village in the Sword Coast North It was raided by orcs in 951 DR and subsequently abandoned. It was eventually resettled in the late 15 century as a frontier settlement of farmers and prospectors.
In the late 15 century DR, Phandalin was a modest and architecturally boring town of hard-working frontiersfolk built atop the ruins of the old Phandalin. The town quickly grew to about fifty well-maintained structures built of logs and flagstones with three deep wells providing water. The town was dominated by an apple orchard on the west side and a ruined manor atop a hill to the east. The townsfolk would congregate in a small town square and an adjacent town green.
Phandalin was located in the Lost Hills of the Sword Mountains south of Neverwinter Wood. It was northeast of Leilon where the road that ran from the High Road to Triboar faded into a trail. This was a region rich with both natural resources and adventuring opportunities.
The climate was temperate, with an average yearly rainfall of . Icespire Peak was visible from the town on clear days.
When Phandalin was reestablished in the late 15 century DR, at first it had no real functioning government, and the Phandalin Miners Exchange began acting as a center of records-keeping for local mining claims. The townsfolk also annually elected a "Townmaster" who served as a judge and mediator as well as kept town records. In 1491 DR, Harbin Wester was the perennial Townmaster.
After diminished faith in the abilities of a single Townmaster to address threats to the village during the early 1490s DR, the townsfolk instead elected a three-member Town Council, originally consisting of Harbin Wester, Sildar Hallwinter, and Trilena Stonehill. Trilena was eventually replaced by Halia Thornton, who subsequently disappeared. As of 1496 DR, the townsfolk moved to expand the council from three to five and additionally to elect a mayor.
Phandalin was adjacent to land which was good for farming and ranching, and was near enough to Neverwinter Wood to support a woodcutting and logging industry. Most of the wealth, however, was from mining in the nearby Sword Mountains for gold, platinum, ore, timber, skins, and cold iron.

Inns and Taverns
* Stonehill Inn A modest inn that was run by a short, friendly young human man named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen came from the east of Triboar, seeking opportunity in prospecting like many others. He soon found that he knew more about running an inn than mining, and so he established the inn.
* The Sleeping Giant A rundown, dirty, and dangerous watering hole. It was known for being frequented by a bandit group, the Redbrands. It was operated by a surly female dwarf named Grista.
* Danley and Sons Inn The only inn when the town was briefly resettled in the late 14 century DR.
Shops and Businesses
* Barthens Provisions The biggest trading post in Phandalin, which stayed open from sunup to sundown. It was run by a lean and balding, middle-aged man with a kindly manner, Elmar Barthen.
* Edermath Orchard An orchard field with the simple cottage of a silver-haired half-elf named Daran Edermath. Daran was a retired marshal in the lands of the Dragon Coast. When he retired, he returned to the Neverwinter region, which was his original home, to grow apples and make cider.
* Lionshield Coster A weapons and armor supplier owned by the Lionshield Coster. The master of this post was a sharp-tongued woman named Linene Graywind,
* Phandalin Miners Exchange A trading post where miners had their finds weighed and paid out. The townsmasters records were kept here, with responsibility of no local lord.
