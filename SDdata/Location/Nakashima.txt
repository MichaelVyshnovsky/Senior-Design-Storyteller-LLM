'''Nakashima''' was an island located in [[Kozakura]].

==Geography==
Nakashima was located roughly at the midpoint between [[Tenmei]] and [[Shinkoku]]. The island was infamous for the dangerous reefs that surrounded the coast.

==Inhabitants==
Nakashima was inhabited by fishermen who safely sailed the waters around the island in fishing boats with shallow drafts. They made a profitable living from fishing for [[abalone]], [[eel]] and shellfish. They also harvested [[pearl]]s from [[oyster]]s. [[Wako]] were occasionally seen in the shallow waters around the island.
