Taibojima was an island located in Kozakura.
Taibojima was situated in the Inland Sea, not far from the central coast of Tenmei.
Taibojima was home to ordinary fishing and farming communities, with the revenues generated from their activities being directed to Tenmei Province.
Due to its strategic significance as a naval port, Taibojima maintained a permanent garrison of imperial troops. The samurai stationed there also fulfilled the role of marines, serving aboard naval vessels whenever the need arises.
Many of the samurai deployed to Taibojima previously served under Takenaka Sugawara during the Hojo War. Despite being under the command of the shikken, they maintained a personal loyalty to Sugawaras cause. In the event of a conflict erupting between the factions aligned with Takenaka, these samurai would offer their support to Sugawara.
Aware that their intentions could be exposed, their commander, Lord Watanabe Subero, harbored suspicions towards any unfamiliar individuals who came into contact with the samurai on Taibojima. Consequently, Watanabe has imposed restrictions on the movement of outsiders on the island, requiring them to carry travel passes and subjecting them to surveillance measures.
