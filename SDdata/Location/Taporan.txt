Taporan was a small riverside settlment found in the nation of Rashemen.
The town comprised a series of stone buildings lined with cobblestone streets, an arrangement that was rather uncommon among towns and cities in Rashemen. It featured a broad stretch of waterfront docks that were always lined with pole-propelled vessels and other river boats.
The town was situated on the long road that extended south from the Huhrongs Road to the Golden Way, at the point where it crossed with the River Tir.
Taporan was well known for the rowdy fishers and rivermen that conducted their business along the River Tir. Passage on a vessel downriver to Ashane cost 1 gp, with an upriver return trip priced at 3 gp. 
The White Dragon and Goblin, and Wolf berserker lodges all maintained alehouses in Taporan. The Wolf lodge house was the largest of the three.
While the towns rivermen were quite industrious, they were considered brave and even a bit foolhardy among their fellow Rashemaar. They were fond of boisterous singing and excessive drink, though maintained themselves while on the waters.
There were a disproportionate number of berserkers living within Taporan, given its reputation as a fishing community.
