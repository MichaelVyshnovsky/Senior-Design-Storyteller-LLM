'''Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting''' was an island in the [[Sea of Swords]] off the coast of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Geography==
Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting was about 275 to 300 miles (440 to 485 kilometers) west-southwest of [[Candlekeep]]. It was north of the [[Nelanther Isles]], or was the northernmost island in that chain, the difference mainly depended on how the map was labeled.

==History==
This island played an important role in the history of a powerful [[Magic weapon|magic sword]] known as ''[[Taragarth]]'' "the Bloodbrand". [[Aeroth of Silverymoon|Aeroth]], the hero of the [[Trollwars#Second_Trollwar|Second Trollwar]] and wielder of ''Taragarth'', departed [[Silverymoon]] for the [[Moonshae Isles]] after the death of his liege lord [[Rayuth]] in the [[982 DR|Year of the Scythe, 982 DR]]. On the way, he stopped at Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting and hid the famous sword in an abandoned well so his six sons would not squabble over it. The Bloodbrand laid there for centuries until it was discovered by a band of [[illithids]] and carried off to their home base deep underground on the mainland.{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|24}}
