'''Marabaya''' was a port city in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]]. It stood on the eastern coast, on the shore of the Southern Ocean, and was the biggest seaport in Malatra in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}

==Trade==
Here, the mineral wealth of the Kuong Kingdom—[[gem]]s, [[gold]], and [[silver]]—as well as [[ivory]] and furs were loaded onto ships and traded to the wider world. In turn, Marabaya received cargoes of pottery, silk, sugar, and various other goods, and distributed these around the kingdom.

One could get in touch with the wako pirates who prowled the surrounding seas at a small shipyard in Marabaya's north.
