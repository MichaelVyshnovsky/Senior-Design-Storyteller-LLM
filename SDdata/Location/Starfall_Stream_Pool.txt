'''Starfall Stream Pool''' was a settlement at the head of [[The Perloush]],{{Cite polyhedron/101/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Turmish Customers and Festivals|23}} situated between and at the bottom of the [[Orsraun Mountains|Orsraun]] and [[Mountains of the Alaoreum|Alaoreum Mountains]] in [[Turmish]].

==Description==
Starfall Stream Pool was one of the most popular rendezvous spot for lovers who sought intimacy during the [[Feast of the Moon]], also called the [[Festival of Lovers]], a grand feast and celebration for the inhabitants of Turmish. The town became regularly patrolled after the [[Time of Troubles]] and the increased activities of the dreaded [[Cult of Malar]] whose members considered frolicking loves to be their prey.
