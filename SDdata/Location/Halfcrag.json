        "Description": "The village was crowded. It's buildings were tall and narrow, separated by cramped lanes. The village was so clustered together it appeared as one single massive structure from a distance.\n\nHalfcraggers were a cautious people. They hid their wealth and valuables within underground which were formally guarded  by [[undead]] guards to protect their underground vaults. This practice was ended by [[Kelemvor|Kelemvorite]] priests. The villagers now purchased [[helmed horror]]s to act as guards.",
        "Geography": "The village was located near the [[Dun Hills]]. It sat upon a mesa which rose above the surrounding countryside, earning the village it's name.",
        "Trade": "Halfcrag was the largest agricultural center of the Dales and as such they were home to large herds of cattle and [[sheep]]. It's exports included livestock and salted meat stored in [[barrel]]s. The village was known for a local food, a spicy, greasy [[sausage]] that fried well over a campfire.\n\nThe market, as well as camp grounds for caravans, were located at the base of the mesa which the village sat upon. Small pavilions provided visitors with a place to sleep overnight but Halfcrag lacked an inn.",
        "Defenses": "The village was defended by a local volunteer cavalry called the Crag Strikers. They defended the village from brigands and goblinkind. They also protected the village's livestock from [[leucrotta]], [[wolf|wolves]] and other predators from the Dun Hills. Their stables were located in the market area.\n\nThe village itself was surrounded by a wall. A tower, home to a [[ballista]], overlooked the market below. The market area itself was surrounded by ramparts made from earth."
