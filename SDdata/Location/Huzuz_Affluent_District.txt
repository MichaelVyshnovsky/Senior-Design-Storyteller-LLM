The '''Affluent District''' was a district of [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Nestled in the southeast corner of Huzuz against the city walls, the Affluent District was found in the [[Palace Quarter]] and was one of the smaller city districts. This district was bordered by the [[South District]] to the west, the [[Court District]] to the northwest, and the [[East District]] to the north and northeast. Two major roads ran parallel on either side of the Affluent District; the [[Avenue of Wealth]] on the east side and the [[Pilgrims' Route]] on the west side.

==Inhabitants==
As its name implied, most of the inhabitants of the Affluent District were wealthy, though not nearly as wealthy or ostentatious as the residents of the [[Court District]]. The Affluent District was mostly populated with rich merchants and adventurers who found good fortune on their travels.

Constant patrols by the [[Footmen]], and the general nature of its residents, ensured that the Affluent District was a quiet place to live in bustling Huzuz.
