The Craft District was a district of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Craft District was found in the North Quarter and covered a large portion of the northeast corner of Huzuz. This district was nestled between the Warehouse District along the Street of the Ajami to the west and the East District along the Ghosts Route to the south. The Street of the Learned exited Huzuz through the Craft District, leading many students to the ferries that transported them to Al-Bidir Sallah on the opposite bank of Al-Sarif River.
As the name implied, the Craft District was the home of many artisans and craftsmen, including some major families and guilds. Those with the coin to spend to satisfy their eclectic tastes often came to the Craft District to sate their curiosity and desires.
