The '''Craft District''' was a district of [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The Craft District was found in the [[North Quarter]] and covered a large portion of the northeast corner of Huzuz. This district was nestled between the [[Warehouse District of Huzuz|Warehouse District]] along the [[Street of the Ajami]] to the west and the [[East District]] along the [[Caravan Boulevard|Ghost's Route]] to the south. The [[Street of the Learned]] exited Huzuz through the Craft District, leading many students to the ferries that transported them to [[Al-Bidir Sallah]] on the opposite bank of [[Al-Sarif River]].

==Inhabitants==
As the name implied, the Craft District was the home of many artisans and craftsmen, including some major families and guilds. Those with the coin to spend to satisfy their eclectic tastes often came to the Craft District to sate their curiosity and desires.
