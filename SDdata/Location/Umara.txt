The beautiful coastal city of '''Umara''', or the "'''City of Knights'''," lay at the mouth of [[Al-Yatir River]], about a hundred and seventy miles northeast of [[Liham]]. Its appearance was marked by its distinctive blue tilework and textiles. In [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} the outwardly peaceful situation was still stabilizing after a bloody palace coup by barbarian troops enlisted for a campaign against [[Muluk]] by the old [[caliph]].
