        "Description": "New Leaf was built in the foothills of [[Mount Hotenow]], along the western bank of the Neverwinter River. A science waterfall was just northeast from the village, and a single sturdy bridge crossed the river immediately to the east from New Leaf. Up the cliff to the north stood a strange foreign temple ruin. And an abandoned mine taken over by the [[duergar]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]] could be found across the Neverwinter River past the bridge.",
        "Trade": "New Leaf's main industry was logging and woodwork, exporting zalantar. The Merchant's Friend – goddess [[Waukeen]] was the town's primary religion.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, New Leaf may have established trade relations with neighboring towns, including the city of [[Neverwinter]] via the merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]] and her [[Mercantile House]].",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[New Leaf Tavern]], an imaginatively-named spacious local tavern and an inn in the 14{{th}} century DR.\n*Temple of Waukeen, a small chapel dedicated to the Merchant's Friend, the only temple in the 14{{th}} century DR."
