Gotokok was an Iulutiun village known for its annual weapons trade fair.
Gotokok was in Alpuk, alongside the stream linking the Lugalpgotak Sea to Risuak Lake.
Every year, the tiny village of Gotokok hosted a sukkiruchit specifically for the trade of weapons. Arctic dwarves were known to travel from Novularond to this fair.
