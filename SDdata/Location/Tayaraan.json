        "Geography": "Tayaraan sat at the mouth of the [[Kadan River]] where it emptied into the western edge of [[Bahr al-Ajami]], making it quite an isolated settlement. The nearest major city was [[Rog'osto]] to the south. Though it was located roughly in the middle of the Ruined Kingdoms, Tayaraan was the easternmost occupied settlement as of 1367 DR. To the east stretched a vast expanse of dense jungle and ruins."
