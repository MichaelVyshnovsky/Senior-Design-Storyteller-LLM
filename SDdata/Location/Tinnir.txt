Tinnir was a secluded village found in the nation of Rashemen.
While most of the villages structures were whitewashed and typical of those found in the region, there were some buildings that resembled those found in west Faer√ªn.
Tinnir was hidden away in a small forested valley on the southeastern shore of Lake Tirulag, just beyond the site of the Golden Way.
Tinnir received some visitors from among the fisherman that made their catches in Lake Tirulag.
* Lakeside Inn, a charming inn run by a cleric of Bhalla named Vrulla the White.
