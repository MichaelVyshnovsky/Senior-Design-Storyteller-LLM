        "mainbody": "The '''Moonsea North''' was the name given to the region of the [[Moonsea]], along the northern coast of the [[Moonsea (lake)|sea after which it was named]], and the wild, untamed lands further north. During the early years of the [[Era of Upheaval]], it famously became associated with the [[Zhent]]s, partially coming under their control from their seat of power in [[Zhentil Keep]].",
        "Description": "Much of the Moonsea North was considered to be a uncivilized and uncharted wilderness, devoid of civilization but rife with natural resources ready for the seizing.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "[[File:MoonseaNorth Dungeon170 lowres.png|thumb|right|450px|The Moonsea North ''circa'' [[1480 DR]] (north oriented to the left)]]\nThe Moonsea North was marked by four massive mountain ranges, the [[Abbey Mountains]] in the north, the [[White Peaks]] the western arm of the [[Galena Mountains|Galenas]] across its center, and the [[Dragonspine Mountains]] towards the south. \n\nWhile there were many far-reaching rivers  and lakes that formed in the Moonsea North, a few were particularly notable and worth mentioning. The [[Shattersoul River]] formed from the Great Glacier, joining with the west-flowing [[River Pelauvir]]. [[Telstang Brook]] and [[Razack's Tears]] flowed down from the Galena and Dragonspine peaks respectively, forming [[Lake Longreach]] in between the two mountain ranges. \n\nWhile a portion [[Border Forest]] marked the western border of the region, and the [[Frozen Forest]] well beyond to the north, the smaller [[Quivering Forest]] and [[Vercy Wood]] were entirely contained within the seldom-encountered verdant areas of the Moonsea North. \n\nThe [[Twilight Marsh]] was situated on the northern shore of the Moonsea Lake, adjacent to the Quivering Forest."
        },
        "Government": "While there was no central government in the Moonsea North, the city-state of Zhentil Keep held great power and influence over a portion of the region, and [[Melvaunt]], that came under the influence of the returned empire of [[Netheril]] or restored city of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Trade": "The Moonsea North was known to be rich with veins of naturally-occurring metals, and was a source of wealth for the powers of Zhentil Keep. Caravans passing through the Moonsea North were often granted extra protection from the hazards they may face.\n\nDuring the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Zhent]] forces famously sought to link their mercantile interests in the region with their holdings on the [[Sword Coast North]], gaining dominance over two frontiers in with natural resources were plentiful.",
        "Society": "Fitting to its natural landscape that attracted many explorers and pioneers, numerous shrines to [[Shaundakul]] have been built by [[Church of Shaundakul|his church]] throughout its lands over the course of many centuries.",
        "History": "The history of the Moonsea North predated the recorded history of its [[human]] residents.\n\nFor a time ''circa'' the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]], the Moonsea North experienced years of peace it was watched over by the [[Three Peoples]] of [[elves]], [[dwarves]], and [[humans]].\n\nIn the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]] the explorer [[Tal Lancegrove]] famously made journeys into the Moonsea North and detailed his exploits in [[Lancegrove's Travels|diaries]] that were later published by his daughter [[Tarteera Lancegrove|Tarteera]].",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Settlements": "* [[Melvaunt]], a powerful mercantile city-state nestled on the northern coast of the Moonsea.\n* [[Phlan]], the smallest of the three coastal Realms of the Moonsea North.\n* [[Zhentil Keep]], an infamous city long-associated with the [[Zhentarim]] spanning the [[River Tesh]], that was brought to ruin twice in its history.",
