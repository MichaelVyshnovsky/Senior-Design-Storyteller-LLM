The '''Whispering Depths''' was a treacherous cave system found on the [[Sword Coast]]. It was home to a great many [[giant spider]]s, and a single arachnid that claimed to be their queen.

==Geography==
The caves were found immediately beneath the village of [[Moonhaven]]. They were in face accessible by well found in the village's center square.

The furthers reaches of the depths housed an especially deep chasm that led into the [[Underdark]] below.

===Geographical Features===
The Whispering Depths featured rocky ledges and pathways that extended over  the cavern floor. Some rock faces were jagged enough that they could be climbed upon to reach greater heights. Massive webs covered large swaths of the caves.

===Flora & Fauna===
The spiders of the Whispering Depths captured many [[humanoid]]s and bound them in body-sized web sacs.

==History==
At some point, a single individual came to take up residence within the Whispering Depths. They were a worshipper of [[Lolth]] and were utterly facsinated with arachnids and all types of spider-kind. After they came across the body of a [[drow]] [[arachnomancer]], they realized their single meaningful purpose in life: to transform into a spider themself.

==Rumors & Legends==
Hidden within the Whispering Depths was the large, dark [[amethyst]] that could be used to unlock ''[[The Necromancy of Thay]]''.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Phase spider matriarch]], a massive [[phase spider]] that held dominion over the other giant spiders of the depths.
