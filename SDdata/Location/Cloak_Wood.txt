Trees that grew within this forest included [[hangman tree]]s,

==History==
The mines of Cloak Wood flooded in the {{YearlinkName|1243}}, tragically killing many of the [[dwarves]] that dwelled within. They were later taken over by the mercantile consortium of the [[Iron Throne]] and continued mining operations until they were flooded again in the {{YearlinkName|1368}} by a group of adventurers led by [[Abdel Adrian]].

==Inhabitants==
''Circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]] the Cloak Wood served as the home to a circle of [[druid]]s led by [[Archdruid]] [[Seniyad]]. This group acted in direct opposition to the [[Shadow Druids]], a group that was led by [[Amarande]] and his devotees.

Around that same time, the forest was also home to the [[goblin]] army known as the [[Red Fang Marauders]].
