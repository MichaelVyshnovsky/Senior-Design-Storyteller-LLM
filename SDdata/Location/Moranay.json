        "mainbody": "'''Moranay''' was a small town located in [[Agmoth|Agmoth county]], within the [[Easting Coast]] of [[Impiltur]]. It served as an important way-stop for the local merchants as they transported ore down the hinterlands of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] south to the great coastal cities of the realm.{{Cite dungeon/137/Man Forever}}",
        "Description": "The town was located approximately 17 miles (27.4 m) north of where the [[Agmoth Road]] intersected with the stretch of [[Queen's Road]] that connected [[Lyrabar]] and [[Hlammach]].",
        "Government": "The town was overseen by [[Samulbrar Chaseris|Lord Samulbrar Chaseris]] a retired adventurer that chose to settle down and take on the responsibilities of rulership.",
        "History": "Some time during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], shortly after Lord Samulbrar returned from an expedition to [[Rashemen]], a group of [[Shar]]-worshiping [[Durthan]]s enticed a coven of [[hag]]s to infiltrate a ruined estate near the town and prey upon its citizens. The monstrous [[fey]] ''[[Dominate person|dominated]]'' the [[Royal Constabulary (Impiltur)|local constable]] [[Teda Hervyn]] and placed false memories in the minds of the townsfolk, by use of the [[spell]] ''[[modify memory]]''. These [[enchantment]]s led them to believe Lord Salumbrar had taxed the town into near-poverty and committed horrendous atrocities such as public torture. Due to Salumbrar's continued longevity, and the false memories they possessed, the townsfolk of Moranay began to believe he was a [[vampire]].\n\nThe [[Lords of Imphras II]] implored the [[Royal Heralds|Royal Herald]], [[Gabra Robardon]], to recruit traveling adventurers to investigate the goings on within Moranay.\n\nOn [[Marpenoth 30]], nearly 100 of Moranay's citizens gathered in the [[Riddle of the Chase]] to discuss the \"recent unpleasantness\" the town had been experiencing. The crowd gradually became more and more angry, whipped into a frenzy by the [[green hag]] [[Vasyl Yauheni]], who had ''[[veil]]ed'' herself as Teda Hervyn, and Lord Samulbrar's long-time butler [[Falder]]. Although a group of adventurers had came to the town and began to look into the deteriorating situation, it was unknown how the situation ultimately unfolded.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Ridde of the Chase]]: This pleasant and homey tavern was founded by its first proprietor [[Ida Merian Chase]].\n* [[Samulbrar Manor]]: The imposing manor house of lord Samulbrar stood on a small hill overlooking the town."
