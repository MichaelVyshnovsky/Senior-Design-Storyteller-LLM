'''Anauria''' was one of a small number of [[Netherese enclave|enclaves]] that survived the [[Karsus's Folly|fall]] of ancient [[Netheril]]. It grew into a great kingdom and the wealthiest of the [[Lost Kingdoms|Netherese survivor states]] before eventually being swallowed up by the growing [[Anauroch]] desert.

==Description==
Anauria was one of Netheril's famed flying cities. It was famous for the craftsmanship of its swords and for its magic, and after the fall of Netheril, it became the richest of the three surviving states, collectively known as the [[Lost Kingdoms]].

==Geography==
The cities of Anauria were located in the area of [[north Faerûn]] that was later known as [[the Sword]], the southern region of the great [[Anauroch]] desert. Using landmarks from the [[Era of Upheaval]], Anauria stretched from the [[Serpent Hills]] to the west, as far east as the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]],

==Government==
While Anauria was a [[human]]-ruled kingdom, its greatest ruler was King [[Thausimbel Thardresk|Thausimbel "The Wise"]] a great man of elven blood who ruled for over three and a half centuries.

==History==
After Karsus's Folly in {{Yearlink|-339}}, the goddess [[Mystra]] was able to slow the fall of Anauria so that it could settle safely on the earth. The city–along with [[Asram]] and [[Hlondath]]–then survived for hundreds of years before the desert finally encompassed it.

At some point during its history, [[wizard]]s of Anauria working alongside their fellows from [[Asram]] discovered the kingdom known as the [[Cloudlands]], high in the skies above the Stonelands of Faerûn. Anauria and Asram sought to conquer the realm, in order to escape the encroachment of the growing [[Great Sand Sea]], but wound up destroying it in the process.

According to most scholars the kingdom fell in the {{YearlinkName|111}}, when it was sacked by a horde of [[orc]]s. The exact timeline of this event is not entirely clear, as some state its destruction took place in [[200 DR]], while others state it lasted as long as [[450 DR]].{{Anauria}} 

After the kingdom collapsed, its scattered few survivors traveled east to the region of the [[Moonsea]] and later-day [[Cormyr]]. The [[Marsh Drover]]s of the [[Farsea Marshes]] were perhaps the most notable descendants of the Anaurian people.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some historians speculated that Anauria and [[Hlondath]] had suffered greatly from a [[dracorage]] at some point in their respective histories.

==Notable Locations==

* [[Hall of Rainbows]], a hall of records that comprised murals created by the wizards known as the [[Consortium of Three]].
* Tower Hlithal, the fortress that [[goblinoid]] and [[orc]] armies of [[Araugel]].
* Tower Ramanath, the realms's bulwark against dangers from the [[Hunters' Hills]].

;Settlements:
* [[Amazandar]], the City of Gems served as the kingdom's capital and dominated trade across the three kingdoms.
* [[Anauril]], the City of Swords was home to renowned smiths and metalworkers.
* [[Azumar]], a small city that was utilized to keep safe great arcane power.
* [[Helvara]], the great agricultural center of Anauria.

;Tombs

* [[Thardresk Crypt]], the familial crypt of House Thardresk that was said to hold the remains of King Thausimbel.
* [[Tomb of Diderius]], the resting place of the great Anaurian [[diviner]] [[Diderius]].

==Inhabitants==
The Lost Kingdom of Anauria was inhabited by humans, [[elves]], and [[half-elves]]. Those among the upper classes enjoyed such diversions as hunting, and the lower classes produced vast quantities of grain to export to the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

The noble houses of Anauria included [[House Maluradek]], [[House Nemrin]], the elven houses of [[House Nyntynel|Nyntynel]] and [[House Olyrnn|Olyrnn]],  and the royal family of [[House Thardresk]].
