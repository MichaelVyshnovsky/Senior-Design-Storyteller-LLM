        "mainbody": "Volothamp was a city in Calimshan built upon the side of a cliff overlooking the Shining Sea. It was famous for a series of statues, called the Eight Erehnirs, from the Third Age.\nVolothamp was situated between the cities of Almraiven and Manshaka.\nVolothamp was known to have many of the industries typical of coastal settlements, such as shipping, fishing, and shipbuilding. However, their boats were notorious for being low quality.\nThe city was famed in the Lands of Intrigue for their jewelers and goldsmiths. The demand for their services led many mage consortiums to be established there.\nAround 1357 DR, the city was known to be occasionally raided by creatures from the Spider Swamp that were under the command of spider demon that wanted to take control over the city. Some prestigious members of both the citys society and government were reluctant to confront this issue, as they had been charmed by the demon."
