'''Blood Island''' was a small island that sat in the [[River Mirar]] in the city of [[Luskan]]. It was fortified to house the standing army responsible for defending the city. This fortress briefly came to be known as the '''Dragon's Lair''' during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane||18}}

==Description==
The island was dominated by a guard tower, two barracks, and an armory. There was little else of interest on the island.

The interior of the fortress was decorated with tapestries depicting coastlines and [[ship]]s as well as furniture of black [[oak]]. The windows in the officers' quarters commanded an excellent view of the coast.

==Geography==
Blood Island sat further upstream than the other islands in the River Mirar's mouth (namely [[Closeguard Island]], [[Cutlass Island]], [[Fang Island]], and [[Harbor Arm Island]]). It lay in the middle of Luskan's [[Harbor Cross]] bridge: it was connected to Luskan's [[Luskan/South Bank|South Bank]] by the [[Short Span]] of the bridge and to the [[Luskan/North Bank|North Bank]] via the [[Long Span]].

==Defenses==
The barracks contained layers of fortifications, with three separate sets of staggered walls designed to trap attackers and many [[Wikipedia:murder hole|murder holes]] designed to then kill them.

[[Catapult]]s mounted on the roof of the island's guard tower were capable of bombarding enemy ships in either of Luskan's harbors as well as those coming from upriver. They could also fire into the city itself.

==History==
Blood Island was occupied by Luskan's standing army through the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, forces led by [[Deudermont]] and Lord [[Brambleberry]] attacked Luskan to drive out [[Arklem Greeth]] and the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. They seized Blood Island for their assault across the Harbor Cross, and the city guard remained hunkered within their garrison as they fretted over which side to join.

With the descent of Luskan into anarchy following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Blood Island was abandoned: the barracks fell into ruin and its windows were boarded up, and the island became cut off from the city as the Harbor Cross fell into disrepair (although the bridge was rebuilt and known as the "[[Blood Bridge]]" in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}).

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the island had become the headquarters of a [[Shou]] crime syndicate known as the [[Dragonbloods]], and the refurbished garrison came to be called the "Dragon's Lair".{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane||3}} The gang's leadership was killed by [[Kalen Dren]], [[Myrin Darkdance]], [[Rhetegast Hawkwinter|Rhett Hawkwinter]], and [[Sithe]] during the outbreak of the [[Fury|Fury plague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1480}}.

By {{Yearlink|1489}}, the guard tower and barracks once again housed Luskan's soldiers. Access to the island was restricted to members of Luskan's [[:Category:Ships of Luskan|Ships]] or to those otherwise approved by the [[High Captains of Luskan]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Kasi]], a high-ranking member of the Dragonbloods as of 1480 DR.
* [[Umbra]], known to the public as "the Dragon", the enigmatic leader of the Dragonbloods in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
