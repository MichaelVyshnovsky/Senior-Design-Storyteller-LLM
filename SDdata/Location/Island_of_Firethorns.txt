The '''Island of Firethorns''', also called the '''Isle of Fear''', was the largest and most prominent island of the [[Genie's Turban]] archiepelago found in the [[Corsair Domains]] of [[northwest Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The island measured {{SI|150|mi|k|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} in width at its widest point. The northern and southern land rises were separated by a thin neck in the middle of the island formed by [[Chaos Bay]] in the east and an unnamed bay in the west where the village of [[Safe Cove]] was found. The "capital" of the Corsair Domains, [[Hawa]], was sheltered by the dynamic reefs of Chaos Bay.

==Description==
Much of the Island of Firethorns was forested, but the island took its name from the dangerous [[firethorn]] plants that were abundant on the eastern coast of the island.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Hawa]]
* Safe Cove
