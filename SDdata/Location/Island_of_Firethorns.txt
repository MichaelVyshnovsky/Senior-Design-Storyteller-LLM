The Island of Firethorns, also called the Isle of Fear, was the largest and most prominent island of the Genies Turban archiepelago found in the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR.
The island measured  in length and  in width at its widest point. The northern and southern land rises were separated by a thin neck in the middle of the island formed by Chaos Bay in the east and an unnamed bay in the west where the village of Safe Cove was found. The "capital" of the Corsair Domains, Hawa, was sheltered by the dynamic reefs of Chaos Bay.
Much of the Island of Firethorns was forested, but the island took its name from the dangerous firethorn plants that were abundant on the eastern coast of the island.
