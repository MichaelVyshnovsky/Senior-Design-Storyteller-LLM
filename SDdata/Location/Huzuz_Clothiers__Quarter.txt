The Clothiers Quarter was one of the four quarters of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Clothiers Quarter encompassed the Clothiers District, Merchants District, and the seedy Northwest District, forming the west and northwest portion of the city. Thanks to the sprawling Grand Bazaar, and other smaller areas of trade, the Clothiers Quarter was the center of trade and business within Golden Huzuz where anything from coffee to slaves could be purchased.
