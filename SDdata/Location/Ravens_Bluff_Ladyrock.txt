'''Ladyrock''' was a small isle located in the mouth of the [[Fire River]], and was counted among the neighborhoods of the [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. It was a favorite stop of rowdy and unsavory sailors to carouse and cut loose between voyages, thanks in part to the wide open view it had of any approaching [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] patrols. To the more law-abiding Ravenians of the Bluff, Ladyrock island was a place they would often view, but seldom visit.

Access to the isle was available by a number of [[cp|copper]]-a-ride ferries. The conveyances however were little more than a dinghy, or pair that had been bound together for slightly more stability.

==Notable Locations==
;Businesses and Shops:
*[[Ustiligator Paper Mill]]: While it was a more mundane sight of the city, this [[paper]] mill produced white-woven paper that was highly valued among scribes and [[wizard]]s alike.

;Halls:
*[[Stars in Shadow]]: A discreet and isolated meeting house that provided a venue for Ravenians to conduct business they wished to keep out of view of others.

;Inns, Taverns and Restaurants:
*[[Painted Boat]]: This restaurant, which unsurprisingly specialized in seafood, was a favorite stop for the Ravenian City Watch.
*[[Red Sail Tavern]]: The isle's busiest establishments, as well as its sole tavern, only catered to sailors, shipping masters, dockworkers and others who had a stake in business at sea.

;Landmarks:
*[[Ladyrock Lighthouse]]: This grand, black stone tower offered the [[Regent of the Harbor]] a grand view of the ships entering and leaving the city's docks.
