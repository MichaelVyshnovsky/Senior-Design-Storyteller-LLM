The Groaning Cave was a secretive cave found in the elven city of Evereska.
Formed within one of Evereskas numerous hills, the entrance to the Groaning Cave was set upon a stone terrace and surrounded by a railing.
While its exact contents were only known to the Evereskan high mages, the cave was known to some to hold the citys extensive archives. It was also believed to safeguard myriad of priceless elven treasures.
The cave could be found in the northern end of Evereska, just beyond the Hall of the High Hunt.
Some said that the depths of the cave housed the mythal that enveloped and protected Evereska and the outskirts leading to the Vine Vale.
