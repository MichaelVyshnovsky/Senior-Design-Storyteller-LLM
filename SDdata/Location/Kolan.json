        "mainbody": "Kolan was a nation on the western coast of south Maztica.\nKolan was located on the western side of the House of Tezca, south of Huacli and Nexal. Their land, a series of fertile valleys, was surrounded by the harsh desert to the east and south, impenetrable mountains to the north, and the vast ocean to the west. And yet, their land had one of the finest climates in Maztica, with warm breezes and plenty of rain year-round. They had four largely self-sufficient city-states, called Cabez, Guatl, Kolatl, and Baya.\nKolan was inhabited by humans, who themselves were an offshoot of the Green Folk, but with traits of the Nexalan ethnic group mixed in. They spoke their own language, which was related to the Green Folk language.\nEach of Kolans four cities was ruled independently. However, all of Kolan was a subject state to Nexal, forced to pay that city tribute.\nThe Kolan people were a proud, self-sufficient people. They built their cities by and on cliff-sides, carving homes directly into the cliff-face, so that it was only accessible by ladder. They had plenty of food thanks to the climate and fertile land, but years of paying Nexal tribute meant they had little in the way of art or treasure.\nThe mixture of Maztican cultural traits meant that they worshiped the Maztican pantheon and practiced human sacrifice. They were not overly inclined to fighting, but could muster significant numbers of warriors who were well able to fight in the harsh terrain around Kolan.\nDuring the reign of the ninth Counselor of Nexal, Zomoc, Nexal sent an army across the desert to conquer Kolan. This conquest took a full twenty years, and Nexal gained little wealth.\nLater on, during the reign of Pakli, a failed expedition against Otomi and Kultaka sparked rebellions in Huacli, Pezelac, and Kolan.\nAfter the fall of Nexal, the Kolan quickly declared their independence, and began talks aimed at uniting the four city-states."
