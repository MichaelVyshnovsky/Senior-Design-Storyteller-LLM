'''Westgate''' was a seedy and squalid metropolis—with a history in piracy, powerful crime syndicates, and nameless vampiric crime-lords. Westgate thrived on black-market trade and corruption, and was perhaps one of the most sordid cities in all of [[Faerûn]]. The legacy of scoundrels and spies was found in every alley, and danger lurked for the unprepared in every corner.{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|4}} Despite this, it was the largest and most powerful city on the [[Dragon Coast]].

It was an open city that welcomed all travelers and citizens alike as long as they abided by the local laws and, of course, had enough coin.

It was probably the oldest, richest and most corrupt port on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It received the nickname "Gateway to the West" from its role as the Inner Sea's most prolific port city.

{{quote|''Ah, Westgate. They say that this is the city where anything goes and everything has a price, and that's pretty much the truth. It's the most powerful city on the Dragon Coast and the most ruthless. My advice is to watch your back at all times, or get someone to do it for you.''|The First Mate of the ''[[Sea Serpent]]''.}}

==Society==

===Religion===
Westhavians tolerated the worship of a wide variety of gods, including evil gods, and were proud of their openness.<ref name = "Dragon428-p8">{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|8}} The city's corruption extended to religious matters also, with clerics of some temples secretly pocketing donations.{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|8-9}} Many temples were all too happy to sell spellcasting services or healing potions to adventurers, as a way to earn coin.

===Demonym===
A person from Westgate was known as a Westar or a Westhavian.

===Culture===
One local [[chapbook]] of note was a mean-spirited ''[[Ambritur's Whip]]''. The publication was penned by anonymous contributors and focused on negative coverage of local establishments and events, as well as spreading gossip and rumors.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/11-16 - Chapbooks}}

==History==
{{main|History of Westgate}}
This area of the [[Dragon Coast]] was first settled by [[human]]s from the [[Vilhon Reach]] roughly 1,000 years before the [[Standing Stone]] was erected in [[Cormanthor]]. The largest settlment was the human town of Westgate, ruled cruelly by the great [[topaz dragon]] [[Kisonraathiisar]].

In the {{YearlinkName|-349}}, [[Saldrinar]] destroyed [[Kisonraathiisar]] and became Westgate's first [[human]] king.

In the {{YearlinkName|-286}}, the vampire Orlak and a small army of mercenaries captured the city in a single night. Orlak proclaimed himself the Night King and ruled until he is defeated by a group of [[Lathander]]-worshiping paladins in the {{YearlinkName|-157}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|257}}, pirates from the [[Pirate Isles]] invaded Westgate and began the 200-year-long reign of the Pirate Kings.

In the {{YearlinkName|429}} the [[Chondathan]] mercenary captain [[Mulsantir Illistine I|Mulsantir Illistine]] attacked Westgate and overthrew the pirate kings.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Westgate faced unrest caused by a guild war between the infamous Night Masks and a new organization knows as the [[Ebon Claws]]. The two gangs erupted the streets of Westgate in violence at night so new visitors to the city were warned.

After the [[Spellplague]], the Sea of Fallen Stars began to drain into the [[Underdark]]. The lower water level caused the shoreline to recede and, for a time, the harbor of Westgate was left high and dry. The docks were rebuilt on the new shoreline and the new dock area was known as [[Tidetown]].

With the rise of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], Westgate came to be known as the only port on the Sea of Fallen Stars that had never come under attack from the [[aboleth]]s. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, this had led to rumors of dark deals having been made to ensure the city's safety,  and indeed it did seem to enjoy some measure of special protection.

During the [[Second Sundering]] the [[great rain|Great Rain]] caused the level of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to rise, making flooding in Westgate commonplace. These tidal floods caused many structures to collapse, which in turn revealed the formerly hidden entrances to dungeons built in [[Tidetown]].{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|10}}

==Foreign Policy==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, following the collapse of the [[Shadovar]]-controlled Sembians, the primary foe of Westgate was Cormyr.

==Local expressions==
===Slang===
