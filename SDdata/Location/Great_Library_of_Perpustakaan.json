        "mainbody": "The '''Great Library of Perpustakaan''', or simply '''Perpustakaan''', was a library in [[Perpustakaan]] in the [[Kesasar Valley]] in the [[Shao Mountains]] of southern [[Kara-Tur]]. It was one of the most magnificent repositories of knowledge in all of Kara-Tur. Unfortunately, most of the people outside the Shao Mountains had forgotten the existence of it.",
        "History": "Perpustakaan was built in ancient times by the empire of [[Anok-Imaskar]]. After the fall of that civilization, the existence of the library was forgotten in the later empires of [[Shou Lung]].\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, however, an adventuring party may have rediscovered the library and told Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] and Imperial Wu Jen [[Kao Shan Ten]] about it.",
        "Description": "Perpustakaan was made of black [[granite]]. It was a huge building with a tall pagoda stretching into the sky.\n\nInside, the library was divided into many reference Sections, with one specific section for each of these topics: literature, [[astrology]], [[geography]], ancient [[history]], military history, [[philosophy]], biography, [[mathematics]], arcane lore, and one section for each member of the [[Nine Immortals]].\n\nThere also a conference room, a rotunda, rooms and cubicles for visiting scholars, a foyer, and residences for staff members.",
        "Population": "Perpustakaan had a limited librarian and clerical staff but a large militia that enforced the respect of the library's rules and maintained peace inside.",
        "Rules": "Perpustakaan was open twelve hours a day, from dawn to sunset. To use the library, one needed to register six months beforehand. It was possible, however, at the head librarian's discretion, to bend rules under special circumstances."
