        "mainbody": "he Great Library of Perpustakaan, or simply Perpustakaan, was a library in Perpustakaan in the Kesasar Valley in the Shao Mountains of southern Kara-Tur. It was one of the most magnificent repositories of knowledge in all of Kara-Tur. Unfortunately, most of the people outside the Shao Mountains had forgotten the existence of it.\nPerpustakaan was built in ancient times by the empire of Anok-Imaskar. After the fall of that civilization, the existence of the library was forgotten in the later empires of Shou Lung.\nCirca , however, an adventuring party may have rediscovered the library and told Emperor Kai Tsao Shou Chin and Imperial Wu Jen Kao Shan Ten about it.\nPerpustakaan was made of black granite. It was a huge building with a tall pagoda stretching into the sky.\nInside, the library was divided into many reference Sections, with one specific section for each of these topics literature, astrology, geography, ancient history, military history, philosophy, biography, mathematics, arcane lore, and one section for each member of the Nine Immortals.\nThere also a conference room, a rotunda, rooms and cubicles for visiting scholars, a foyer, and residences for staff members.\nPerpustakaan had a limited librarian and clerical staff but a large militia that enforced the respect of the librarys rules and maintained peace inside.\nPerpustakaan was open twelve hours a day, from dawn to sunset. To use the library, one needed to register six months beforehand. It was possible, however, at the head librarians discretion, to bend rules under special circumstances."
