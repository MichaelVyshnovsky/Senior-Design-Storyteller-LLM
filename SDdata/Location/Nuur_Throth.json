        "mainbody": "uur Throth was a cave located in Lowerdark.\nNuur Throth was a very unusual cave. In the upper parts of the cave, sheets of wizard fire constantly danced about. Throughout the cave were clusters of unusual stones which were the covers for deep wells. Around these clusters grew grooves of sussur trees.\nLocated in the center of the cavern was a large earth node made from a dense iron ore that was black in color. This earth node was linked to six other earth nodes scattered throughout northern Faer√ªn, from Icewind Dale to Kryptgarden Forest. Anyone casting the node door spell was able to travel along this network of linked earth nodes. \nNuur Throth was located beneath the Sword Mountains in the western Northdark."
