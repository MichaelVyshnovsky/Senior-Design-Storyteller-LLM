        "Description": "Nuur Throth was a very unusual cave. In the upper parts of the cave, sheets of [[wizard fire]] constantly danced about. Throughout the cave were clusters of unusual stones which were the covers for deep wells. Around these clusters grew grooves of [[sussur]] trees.\n\nLocated in the center of the cavern was a large [[earth node]] made from a dense [[iron]] ore that was black in color. This earth node was linked to six other earth nodes scattered throughout [[North Faerûn|northern Faerûn]], from [[Icewind Dale]] to [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. Anyone casting the ''[[node door]]'' spell was able to travel along this network of linked earth nodes.",
        "Geography": "Nuur Throth was located beneath the [[Sword Mountains]] in the western [[Northdark]]."
