'''Rivington''' was the southern-most district of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was the only region of the [[Outer City]] located on the southern shore of the [[River Chionthar]], on the far side of [[Wyrm's Crossing]]. The [[Trade Way]] led south from Rivington to the [[Lands of Intrigue]] and [[Calimshan]].

The [[Rivington Rats]] was a local guild that plagued the neighborhood during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Smugglers also frequented the district, running goods by river to [[Brampton]] by way of the river.
