        "Description": "Within Toro-dai-be, there were 68 buildings, including traditional [[Kozakuran dictionary#M|''minka'']] homes, [[Kozakuran dictionary#G|''godowns'']], a mill, and a temple dedicated to the [[Toro-dai]] school.\n\nToro-dai-be was known for its unique characteristics. It lay within the boundaries of a Toro-dai [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']] and was remarkable for the unwavering devotion of its inhabitants to the Toro-dai religious school. The villagers' commitment to their faith was so intense that they were willing to take extraordinary measures for its cause.",
        "Government": "As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the village was led by a powerful [[shukenja]] who served both as the community leader and the manager of the shoen.",
        "Defenses": "Distinct from most villages, Toro-dai-be boasted a simple yet effective stockade for protection, complemented by a network of irrigation ditches and moats. While the village lacked [[samurai]] or [[bushi]], it had a militia of 127 able-bodied men and boys. These individuals were armed with [[spear]]s and [[naginata]]s and defended the village in times of crisis, such as during wars or frequent bandit raids.\n\nAdditionally, the village received external support in challenging times. During periods of conflict or at harvest, the provincial temple of the Toro-dai school dispatched twenty [[sohei]] to assist the villagers. These sohei played a crucial role in safeguarding the villagers and ensuring the safe transport of their agricultural rent to the relevant authorities."
