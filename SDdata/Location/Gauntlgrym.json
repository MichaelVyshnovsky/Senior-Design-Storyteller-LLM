        "mainbody": "During this era when the city was lost to the dwarves, it was said that all descendants of Delzoun knew an ancient poem known as the ''[[Canticle of Gauntlgrym]]'' that helped to ensure the legend of Gauntlgrym in dwarven memory. This song would eventually become an anthem for the city after it was reclaimed in the late 15{{th}} century DR, commonly sung by dwarves as they made their way to the city.\n\n===Illithid Rule===\nThe illithids ruled over the city for over a millennium, keeping to the lower levels while leaving the trap-filled upper halls empty. They would later use the city as a base from which to attack the [[Kraken Society]], who had managed to injure their elder brain and managed to abduct and brainwash one of their own in the {{YearlinkName|1278}}. They would also find unexpected numbers when they accepted refugees from destroyed [[Phanlinksal]] in the {{YearlinkName|1339}}, who aided them in their main goal which seemed to be the creation of half-illithid hybrid creatures. \n\nThe [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] would be only the second surface group to uncover Gauntlygrym,{{Fact}} the first being the [[Company of the Gryphon]] in [[1357 DR]]. The Knights had found a previously undiscovered route through the Underdark from [[Shadowdale]].{{Fact}}\n\nA group of goblinoids called the [[Hargrath]] later took over the upper levels.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, the mind flayers of Gauntlgrym created the first [[illithiderro]], or madminds. The madminds, who could breed amongst themselves, did so quickly and outnumbered their creators in only a few years. They successfully rebelled against the illithids, slaughtering most of their former masters and enslaving the [[duergar]] before coming to infest the lower levels like vermin.\n\nFollowing the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] sensed the presence of Maegera and wanted to harness its powers for their own ends. In order to control Maegera, a branch of the Sovereignty created the dreaded [[Symphony of Madness]]. The first tests of the Symphony occurred a few years later, when the Sovereignty used the Symphony to corrupt the mind flayer's elder brain, something that in turn corrupted the mind flayers, turning them into [[plaguechanged]] puppets of the Sovereignty.\n\n===Waking of the Primordial===\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, the [[vampire]] [[Korvin Dor'crae]] followed the roots of the destroyed [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], which still had traces of remnant [[magic]]. Using his mist form, he easily passed through the deep caverns, and found that the roots were connected to the great forge of Gauntlgrym. He reported back to the [[Thayan]]s, who sent [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and some allies to the ancient kingdom. Dahlia sought out the Delzoun dwarf, [[Athrogate]], and his drow companion, [[Jarlaxle]]. The group, including Dor'crae, who helped them navigate the dangerous caverns, finally reached Gauntylgrym. The [[evil]] vampire knew that only a Delzoun dwarf could open the way into the great city, deactivate its traps, and disable the forge. After the great gates were swung open, the wards were safely passed, and the group came across the lever to disable to forge. Dor'crae mentally ''[[dominate person|dominated]]'' Athrogate, and he was forced to pull the lever, awakening the fire primordial, Maegera. The subsequent [[Ruining|volcanic eruption]] destroyed the nearby city of [[Neverwinter]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1462}}, [[Sylora Salm]] tried to destroy the now ruined settlement of Neverwinter but she was stopped by the combined efforts of Jarlaxle, Athrogate, [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. In an event later known as \"the Summons\", hundreds of dwarven [[ghost]]s emerged from Gauntlgrym and approached the descendants of Delzoun to beseech their help in repelling the invaders. The dwarves of [[Clan Battlehammer]] in [[Icewind Dale]], as well as those of [[Mirabar]], heeded the call and helped turn back Sylora Salm, [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], and the [[Ashmadai]], but not before Bruenor and his faithful shield dwarf, [[Thibbledorf Pwent]], were fatally injured.\n\n===Q'Xorlarrin===\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, a group of [[drow]] from [[House Xorlarrin]], led by [[Ravel Xorlarrin]], captured the forge area of the complex at the behest of [[Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin|Matron Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]], having been secretly prodded to do so by [[House Baenre]]. The purpose was to create a sister city to [[Menzoberranzan]] that was free of the direct control of House Baenre and that would provide many valuable forged goods. Additionally, the city had the potential to afford greater rights to drow males and [[drider]]s, as well as to improve access for [[Bregan D'aerthe]] to send trade goods from the surface back to the Underdark. A brief setback occurred shortly after the occupation began when [[Brack'thal Xorlarrin]], the house elderboy, succumbed to the whispers of Maegera and tried to release the primordial once more, coinciding with an attack from a contingent of [[Shadovar]] led by [[Herzgo Alegni]]. \n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, the drow had secured the area around the forge and some of the lower mining tunnels, where they forced slaves to work. That year, House Xorlarrin received official approval to leave Menzoberranzan for the new settlement, which was named [[Q'Xorlarrin]]. Not long before Matron Zeerith was set to arrive, drow troops (under the command of [[House Baenre]]) captured [[Artemis Entreri]] and his companions and tortured them or set them to work. The reborn [[Companions of the Hall]], who entered Gauntlgrym to free Thibbledorf Pwent from his vampiric curse, learned about Entreri's captivity and set out to rescue him. In the ensuing fight, the drow were forced to retreat temporarily and many of the settlement's rooms were destroyed. However, Zeerith and [[Matron Mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]] arrived and presumably moved to rebuild the city.\n\n===Reclamation===\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the city was reclaimed by an army of dwarves from [[Mithral Hall]] and [[Citadel Felbarr]] led by Bruenor Battlehammer, [[Connerad Brawnanvil]], and [[Emerus Warcrown]]. In the aftermath of the fighting, Connerad of Mithral Hall was posthumously given the honor of being the first king of Gauntlgrym, followed by Emerus of Citadel Felbarr who also succumbed to his wounds shortly after. This left Bruenor as the third king of Gauntlgrym. \n\nSome time after the reclamation, the dwarves lost control of Gauntlgrym once again. A [[beholder]] named [[Felbris]] took control of the city. It was later killed by four [[adventurer]]s.",
        "Geography": {
            "Location": "Its location was lost for centuries. The city was alleged to be north of the [[River Dessarin]], near the [[Valley of Khedrun]] in the [[Savage Frontier]]. It was actually farther southwest.",
            "Entry Points": "Bruenor Battlehammer rediscovered Gauntlgrym through a cave entrance in a stony ravine in the [[Crags]] outside of [[Neverwinter]]. This entrance appear to be the closest to the city's \"front doors.\"\n\nAnother entry point was a river of magma that originated within [[Mount Hotenow]], which, in [[1479 DR]], was connected to the Great Cavern (and therefore Gauntlgrym's main entrance) via winding tunnels.\n\nA number of tunnels in the [[Underdark]] beneath Gauntlgrym led upwards into the city; many of which bypassed the main entrance. Gauntlgrym connected with [[Deepearth]] and  [[Nuur Throth]] via the [[Underdark]]. Also starting beneath the city was a long and treacherous tunnel to the [[Great Worm Caverns]] and an even longer tunnel to [[Shadowdale]]."

        "History": {
            "Origins": "After the last [[Tearfall|conflict]] between [[god]]s and [[primordial]]s the primordial [[Maegera]], tired of fighting and uninterested in following its fellow primordials to the world of [[Abeir]], entered in a coma-like sleep beneath the Crags, forming the caves that would later be called Gauntlgrym.{{Cite dungeon/183/Exploring Gauntlgrym|50}}",
            "Rise and Fall": "Toward the end of the [[Age of Elves]] ({{Yearlink|-22900}} to {{Yearlink|-1100}}), [[Delzoun]] was established around {{Yearlink|-3900}} and dwarven miners first dug the tunnels and chambers that would eventually become known as Gauntlgrym. The dwarves found unusual veins of magical ore, but in their digging, they encountered the slumbering primordial. After that disastrous encounter, Delzoun sealed the tunnels and focused on expanding their empire.\n\nMillennia later, the primordial was rediscovered by the [[arcanist]] [[Maerin]] of [[Illusk]]. He convinced the dwarves of Delzoun to build a city around the mines of Gauntlgrym in order to harness the power of the primordial to create exceptional pieces of metalwork. Construction on the city began in the {{YearlinkName|-335}}, as a joint effort between the human wizards of Illusk and the dwarves of Delzoun. Maerin and the [[elven]] wizards of [[Iliyanbruen]] extended the reach of the \"roots\" of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in Illusk to carry the cooling waters of the sea to the primordial. The famed dwarf artisan [[Immar Fardelver]] was involved in the construction of the city itself.\n\nThe city was completed fourteen years later in the {{YearlinkName|-321}}, and became the home to dwarves from [[Clan Goldspire]], humans from Illusk, and [[Netherese]] refugees from [[Runlatha]] and [[Sundabar]].\n\nThe city fell during the [[Orc Marches]] of the {{YearlinkName|-111}}, but was resettled in the {{YearlinkName|141}}, this time as a vassal of Illusk, who again aided the dwarves in their efforts. Unfortunately, after an invasion in the {{YearlinkName|153}}, by [[lycanthrope]]s and [[illithid]]s a mere twelve years after its resettlement, the city was left to the mind flayers for the next millennium. Many refugees of Gauntlgrym, infected with [[lycanthropy]], fled to the [[Gray Wolf Tribe]], spreading their curse to the [[Uthgardt]]. \n\n{{fq\n| text = Silver halls and mithral doors<br/>Stone walls to seal the cavern<br/>grander sights than e'ere before<br/>In smithy, mine, and tavern<br/><br/>Toil hard in endless night<br/>In toast, oh, lift your flagon!<br/>Ye'll need the drink to keep you right<br/>At the forge that bakes the dragon.<br/><br/>Come Delzoun, come one and all<br/>Rush to grab yer kin<br/>And tell 'em that their home awaits<br/>In grandest Gauntlgrym!\n| source = The ''Canticle of Gauntlgrym''\n}}\nDuring this era when the city was lost to the dwarves, it was said that all descendants of Delzoun knew an ancient poem known as the ''[[Canticle of Gauntlgrym]]'' that helped to ensure the legend of Gauntlgrym in dwarven memory.

Some were raised and others were in shallow pits. A [[pulley]] system was used to transport buckets, containing water or ore, and this was accessed via raised stone catwalks. Tools made in the furnaces of the Great Forge were imbued with tiny amounts of primordial essence.\n\n;Iron Tabernacle\n:The Iron Tabernacle, situated at the heart of the city, was Gauntlgrym's temple, although it covered a huge area containing a number of cathedrals, and was adorned with sculptures and intricate knotwork. It also contained a switching station which acted as a central hub for the magical automated mine carts that were used to transport ore across the city, via an extensive series of mine cart rails. A large crypt lay at the lowest part of the Iron Tabernacle, with burials ranging from simple ones to large sarcophagi, buried with full details of lineage. The crypt was protected by [[ghost]]s who would attack those who were not respectful of the dead.\n\n;Mines\n:As of [[1480 DR]], duergar mining activity was underway in the depths of Gauntlgrym. At first utilising the dwarven mines of the city, which were of traditional dwarven design, there were also much more dangerous duergar mines which were, in places, almost vertical, with makeshift homes at the bottom of some pits, to improve efficiency. Some of the deepest pits reached the large underground magma lakes of Mount Hotenow.\n\n;Shrine of Sacrilege\n:As of [[1480 DR]], a duergar shrine to [[Asmodeus]] had been constructed in one of the deeper pits within the mines, by using materials taken from the Iron Tabernacle, such as icons of [[Moradin]].\n\n;The Causeway\n:Installed by King Bruenor, these tunnels contained rails on the ceiling and a magical effect that reversed gravity, allowing for carts to be rolled \"down\" to the surface.{{Cite digital book/Hero/Kindle||28}}",
