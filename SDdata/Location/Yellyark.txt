'''Yellyark''' was a village in [[Chult]] that was home to the [[Biting Ant]] tribe of [[Batiri]] [[goblins]]. It was built within a lattice of trees that were bent over and tied together with vines.

==Geography==
The settlement was located in the northern jungles of Chult, just north of the [[River Soshenstar]]. The trees upon which it was built were planted in the center of three enormous ant colony mounds.

==Government==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Yellyark was ruled by a Queen [[Grabstab]].

==Defenses==
The settlement was constructed in quite a unique manner; it was inside a grouping of bound trees, attached to a larger, stronger tree. This created a sort of "catapult" effect. If Yellyark was truly threatened, the bindings that held the bundle of down could be severed and the whole village could be launched a great distance away over the jungle canopy.

Yellyark employed more traditional measures of defense, such as tripwire alarms, camouflaged batiri sentries,

==Inhabitants==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, around forty goblins lived within the village.
