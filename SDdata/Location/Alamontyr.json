        "mainbody": "Alamontyr was a large fishing and agricultural town in the far northeast of the Border Kingdoms. It was the easternmost notable settlement within the Border Kingdoms, and was home to the largest community of craftspeople in the region.\nAlamontyr was the first major city encountered by caravans coming down from the Golden Road. \nAlamontyr lay on Zarcels Run, a river that flowed from the Duskwood in the south to the shores of the Lake of Steam in the north.\nAlamontyr was ruled by Shield Duke Bardran Thulmaer and his forty Griffon Knights, who policed the town and the surrounding areas fairly and with particular respect for local religious leaders. This made him well-loved not only with the people of Alamontyr but also the people of the Realm of the Smoking Star to the west. The Shield Duke was quite old but had not yet named a successor by 1374 DR, leading to much speculation and meddling.\nBecause of the relative safety and security of life in Alamontyr, it had become home to many different craftspeople, such as finesmiths, woodcarvers, potters, glaziers, jewelers, and tailors, who exported their wares widely. Attempts to bring corruption to Alamontyr had been made by Chessenta, Westgate, the Red Wizards, and Zhentil Keep.\nSeveral temples could be found in Alamontyr, including\n*The Valkurhouse, a temple dedicated to Valkur, considered the protector of those individuals sailing the Lake of Steam\n*The Moonsilver Door, a house repurposed as a temple to Sel√ªne\n*The Just Hall, a modest temple dedicated to Tyr\n*A shrine to the Red Knight, which was the patron deity of the Griffon Knights.\nAlamontyr defenses included a castle which had fallen into disrepair, and walls surrounding the city.\n* A Zhentarim agent tried to assassinate the Duke. Upon being caught, he was dismembered by the Griffon Knights and sent in several packages to the ruling lords of Zhentil Keep.\n* Disturbances made by digging into the Shieldmaidens for copper brought denizens of the Underdark such as ropers to Alamontyr. These creatures were found in cellars, crypts, and sewers. A rumor existed that they were being aided by an inhabitant of the town.\nThe badge of Alamontyr was a full-face silver shield held up by two white wings on a dun background. The shield displayed a rampant red griffon facing the dexter and its base (bottom tip) dripped three large, crimson teardrops of blood."
