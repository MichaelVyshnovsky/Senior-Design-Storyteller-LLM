The peaceful creatures engaged in trade with the humans of the Blade Kingdoms and were allied with them during the reign of Princess Krrrr-poka. Nixie political dignitaries were guests during the annual celebration of the Festival of Blades. Nixies of Krrrr-pokas kingdom aided fishing city-states of Zutria and Lomatra by driving schools of fish into fishing nets and guarding them against hungry pikes, common within the lake. Nixies received dried beef and squeeze bulbs filled with wine in exchange.\nthumb|A map of the Akanamere circa mid 14 century 350x350px\nThe Akanamere produced a rich catch of fish to the cities on its shores and the nixie population that dwelt in its waters. Eels, stone crabs, and druth were the most common catch. Fresh fish was often sun-dried for storage or trade, and crab was stored in salt-filled barrels. Dried fish was often used in stews and soups, shredded, and cooked in water. The Akanameres eels were known for their nutty flavor, while flatfish had a distinct smoky taste that resembled pig bacon. Among other fish that was fished from the lake and traded by nixies were blowfish, hogfish, and singing fish.\nApart from fish, the Akanamere served as the main source of freshwater for the western part of the nation of Chessenta.\nWhile the underwater inhabitants of the Akanamere traded with surface dwellers, the humanoids who inhabited the lakes shores used its waters for trade. The waters of the Akanamere held numerous trade sea routes between the local cities, as well as ships that traveled from afar via River Akax and the Bay of Chessenta.\nShortly before the opening of the Orcgate, in -1076 DR, a wizard Shan the Golden of the Great Rift, discovered an ancient tomb underneath the waters of the Akanamere.

The grand battle that concluded the Blade Wars took place at the gates of Lomatra. Nixies of Princess Krrrr-pokas kingdom joined the fray against an overwhelming force. Despite all odds, Lomatra defeated the invading armies and Ugo Svarézi – killed, further solidifying the relationship between the Blade Kingdoms and nixies of the Akanamere.\nCirca the , the eastern shores of the Akanamere became a field of battle between Cimbar and Akana. The conflict lasted for several months until the was moved south, further into Chessenta.\nThe late 14 century DR brought a number of raids by troglodyte tribes of Traaskl Thorog, led by Drukkul. Traaskl Thorog, or Middle Darklands of the Underdark located underneath Chessenta, was the origin of the strategic raids. Troglodyte of Chief Drukkul attacked lands between the Akanamere to the River Adder, never striking the same area more than once per year.\nIn the calamity of the Spellplague that ravaged Toril in the , the majority of the Akanamere was drained, turning the once-great lake into a shadow of its former self. The receding waters left the land to be reclaimed by wilderness. Its shores lost the nations that once stood there and were replaced with Akanûl, pulled by the calamity from the world of Abeir.\nWith Spellplagues end and the goddess of magic Mystras return that started in the , the lands of Vilhon Reach were returned to Toril and the Akanamere reclaimed its waters, returning to its former size.\nthumb|A map of 320x320px\n*Akanamere Tomb, an ancient burial pyramid located at the center of the lake, magically protected from water. Following the Spellplague, the long-hidden entrance was open to ambitious adventures.\nApart from a nixie kingdom, the waters of the Akanamere were inhabited by vodyanoi and lizardfolk tribes dotted the lakes shoers, as well as cities of the Blade Kingdoms and Chessenta. An occasional privateer ship can be seen sailing across the lake. Mudmen were reported seen in the Akanamere, brought to life by a magical flow of water that originated somewhere within the lake.\nThe northern shores often saw orcish raids on cattle and sheep herders however, they did not engage with human settlements. However, many peaceful members of the Flaming Spike tribe moved to Airspur and set to pursue mercantile careers."
