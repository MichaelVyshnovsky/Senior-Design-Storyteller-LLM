        "mainbody": "Sunderath was a rather unremarkable village, presumably found in or around the Savage Frontier region of Faer√ªn.While the location of Sunderath is never given, it was compared to the village of Parnast and was a stopping point of Ansoain, a mage that plied her craft in the region. It was notable however, in that it was not influenced by the Zhentarim,\n* Druhallen, a journeyman mage that famously led a quest to recover one of the fabled Nether Scrolls."
