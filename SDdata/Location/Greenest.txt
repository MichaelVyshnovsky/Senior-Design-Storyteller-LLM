Greenest was the only sizable town along the Uldoon Trail in the Greenfields area of the Western Heartlands.
The town was founded by the halfling Dharva Scatterheart, a rogue who saw herself as the queen of the Greenfields. She passed away without achieving such fame, but her town prospered and grew.Â In the year 1489 DR, Greenest was attacked by the blue dragon Lennithon and the Cult of the Dragon.
