        "mainbody": "Hetchit was a small, rancid-smelling village in the Veilstone Peaks region of the Sunset Mountains.\nHetchit was located roughly  west of the village of Melcher, connected by a trail. Another trail leading north from the village was flanked by some hills on the west side, and a wood on the east.\nHetchit was a small village where the residents allowed sewage to flow freely in streams along its streets. This foulness lent the place a distinctive rotten smell.\nLike most of the villages in the region, Hetchit was isolated from trade routes. The people subsisted off of what little they could make from their farms. Some residents supplemented their stores with fish taken from Doffs Lake. The villagers were not particularly good at bartering and were often willing to sell their limited wares at only half market value.\n*Garf and Terrett, two good-natured lads who enjoyed fishing, some time in the midâ€“14th century DR."
