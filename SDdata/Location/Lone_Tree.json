        "mainbody": "he Lone Tree was a hunters camp located at the roots of a single lone tree that was easy to spot from afar on the sprawling white of the Sea of Moving Ices snow.\nThe Lone Tree was around two days travel north away from Lonelywood of Icewind Dale and was located in the Sea of Moving Ice.\nThere were no paths or roads that led to the Love Tree making the traveling there very difficult, especially without snowshoes, as the way was covered in ice and snow throughout the year.\nThe Lone Tree was visible from miles around, once the travelers entered the open landscape of the area. The camp under the tree was surrounded by walls made out of blocks of ice that protected the camp from the blistering winds of the open valley. The camps grounds were sprouted with several 5-feet-high iron crossbar handles that protected the camps leaders. These storage units protected supplies like dung fuel, food preserves, and blankets. During the time the was used by Drizzt DoUrden, a makeshift mattress made out of moss could be found in the camp, moss being good insulation protecting the sleeper from the cold of frozen ground.\nIn 1369 DR, the camp was used by, then not famous, drow ranger hero Drizzt DoUrden. By his friends Regis request, he met with adventurers hired by Celerum at the Lone Tree camp. Aided them in fighting off a pack of wolf-like wild dogs, and guided them through the Sea of Moving Ice to a rendezvous with the ancient barbarian Kinnuki."
