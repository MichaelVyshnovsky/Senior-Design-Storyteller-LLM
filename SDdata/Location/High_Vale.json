        "History": "Much of the vale's landscape was destroyed and many of its trees incinerated by [[phaerimm]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, after the subterranean monstrosities were freed from the [[Sharn Wall]] deep underground.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The High Vale housed a number of ancient ''[[portal|elfgates]]'' that led to long-lost realms of the elven people. One of these magic passageways was known to be linked to the ruins of [[Sharrven]].{{Page needed}}"
