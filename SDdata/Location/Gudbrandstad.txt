'''Gudbrandstad''' was a small village located on the island of [[Norland]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The village was located along the windward side of the southern end of the [[North Jotunhammer Mountains]] near central Norland. As a coastal village on the [[Trackless Sea]], and without the protection from the mountains, Gudbrandstad experienced fierce storms.
