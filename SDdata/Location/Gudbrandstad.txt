Gudbrandstad was a small village located on the island of Norland within the Moonshae Isles.
The village was located along the windward side of the southern end of the North Jotunhammer Mountains near central Norland. As a coastal village on the Trackless Sea, and without the protection from the mountains, Gudbrandstad experienced fierce storms.
