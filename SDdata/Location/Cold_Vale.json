        "mainbody": "The '''Cold Vale''' was a wild and desolate region between the southern edge of the [[Cold Wood]] and the northern spur of the [[Rauvin Mountains]].",
        "Geography": "The Cold Vale was located between the Cold Wood (later the [[Glimmerwood]]) to the north and the Rauvin Mountains to the south. The northern mouth of [[Dead Orc Pass]] opened up into the vale. To the east, the vale opened up into [[Adbar Run]]. To the west, the vale ended against the [[Night Trees]] forest (later part of the [[Glimmerwood]] and the foothills around [[Citadel Felbarr]]. The [[River Rauvin]] passed through the vale from the Cold Wood before going underground north of the Dead Orc Pass into the [[Rauvinheart caverns]].",
        "Description": "The Cold Vale was a land of broken hills, steep ravines, swift cold streams, and mossy gorges.{{Cite web enhancement/More Marches|5}}",
        "History": "In the past, dwarf-paths crisscrossed the vale, leading from [[Citadel Felbarr]] to [[Citadel Adbar]]. By [[1372 DR]], these paths had fallen into disuse and were largely forgotten, even by the [[dwarf|dwarves]].\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], [[Bromm]], one of the twin kings of [[Citadel Adbar]], was beheaded in the Cold Vale by the [[orc]] warlord [[Hartusk]] in what became known as the [[Battle of the Cold Vale]]. Bromm and a unit of the [[Wilddwarf Brigade]] were attacked by orcs, giants, and the [[drow]] [[Tiago Baenre]] on the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]].\n[[Oretheo Spikes]] was the only survivor.\n\nIn 1484-[[1485 DR]], the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]] opened a tunnel entrance to their citadel that led to the Cold Vale.\n\nOn [[Hammer 30]], [[1485 DR]], the [[Battle of Midwinter]] took place in the Cold Vale, two miles from the pond where Harnoth had fallen. The battle occurred in a blinding snowstorm between 3,000 dwarves of Citadel Felbarr and 3,000 [[goblinkin]] (mostly orcs) and a score of [[giant]]s of [[Many-Arrows]]. The dwarves were victorious.",
        "Inhabitants": "The vale was well known for its [[troll]]s.",
        "Notable inhabitants": "*[[Grimlight]], a [[behir]] that kept a lair in a ravine at the center of the vale.\n*[[Shevael Wildwalker]], an [[air genasi]] follower of [[Talos]], \"haunted\" the Cold Vale with her crazed followers and threatened anyone who came their way."
