        "mainbody": "The '''Abbey of the Just Hammer''' was an abbey in [[Tasseldale]], in the [[Dalelands]], dedicated to [[Tyr]]. It was positioned close to the [[River Ashaba]]. The abbey's focus was upon the justice element of Tyr's portfolio and provided legal education for free. As of [[1372 DR]], the Abbey lacked numbers due to the [[drow]] threat in the north. On 22 Mirtul [[1373 DR]], the Abbey was attacked by the green dragon [[Sirvinhandra]], who was defeated by Lord High Justiciar High Avenger [[Deren Eriach]].{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|71}}"
