'''The Rising Moon''' was a temple of [[Selûne]] in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

By [[1367 DR]], the temple was led by High Priest [[Orlathon Lunemast]], who was still in charge by [[1370 DR]]. Beneath him were nine sub-priests of differing ranks.

The Rising Moon was the wealthiest of Tsurlagol's temples.
