        "Government": {
            "Law & Order": "Although the streets of the city were bustling with trade and crammed with crowds during the day, by night a strict curfew was enforced by the [[Illuminated]]. All shops were shut up and all citizens returned to their homes, else they faced arrest, the loss of a hand, or even death.\n\nSlaves were obligated to bear bracelets that displayed their servitude and who their master was at all times. It was common for visitors to the city to become slaves by defaulting on borrowed money. In addition, this servitude could be extended by additional offenses that could add days or even years to their thralldom."

        "Trade": "[[File:City_of_brass-5e.jpg|thumb|260px|''Two efreet in the City of Brass.'']]\nThe City of Brass was a shining beacon for trade and commerce throughout the planes, beckoning many planar travelers to its bazaars, souks, slave markets, and metalcrafters. Famed for its vendors of smoke, [[incense]], and [[tobacco]], the city was also noted for the [[azer]] smiths who worked ceaselessly for the efreet, crafting arms for the armies and the sultan. The city's harbor became a hub of activity when the City of Brass was set down near the surface to take on slaves and goods. This was done only by the Sultan's decree but could allow vast amounts of food and goods to flood into the city.\n\nBehind closed doors, the efreet of the City of Brass had trade links with the [[Baatezu]]. Numerous portals to the [[Nine Hells]] allowed frequent trade of slaves and information.",
        "Defenses": "Arguably the city's first notable defense was its uncanny ability to float above and away from most threats. However, the city was still susceptible to flying intruders crossing its walls. The guards did not take such attempts lightly.\n\nThe armed forces of the City of Brass dwarfed the largest armies of [[Faerûn]] and came in a bizarre array of legions. These legions and their numbers follow:\n*The [[Unquenchable]] – 3,000 elite and fanatical efreet guards.\n*[[Eternal Crimson]] – 100,000 common efreet soldiers.\n*[[Al-Asaf]] – 25,000 horse archers and lancers.\n*[[Angels of Death]] – 35,000 efreet archers.\n*[[Striders]] – 10,000 dragoons.\n*[[Black Eagles]] – 3,000 [[jann|janni]] soldiers.\n*[[Black Darts]] – 2,000 [[manscorpion]] slave-soldiers.\n*[[Bronze Phalanx]] – 1,200 azer siege engineers.\n*[[First Lancers]] – 1,000 noble efreet cavalry.\n*[[Order of the Fiery Heart]] – 500 [[griffon]]-mounted efreet nobles.\n*[[Watchfire Legions]] – 40,000 efreet irregulars.\n*[[Illuminated]] – 50,000 city guards.\n*[[Sultan's Own]] – 4,000 [[salamander]] skirmishers.\n*[[Branded]] – 150 efreet [[mamluk]]s.\n\nIn addition to these considerable forces, a colossal navy of 18,000 individuals crewed the Sultan's personal fleet.",
        "History": "Considered the \"oldest city in all creation\", the City of Brass has long been known as hub for planar travelers and trade. Prior to the [[Dawn War]], it was part of the vast empire of the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]].{{Cite dungeon/129/A Gathering of Winds|40}}\n\nOver the years the City of Brass was subjected to a number of attacks from outsiders. One notable occasion was when an [[archmage]] by the name of [[Tzunk]] attempted to conquer the City of Brass with the help of the potent artifact, the ''[[Codex of Infinite Planes]]''. Even with the powerful tome, he could not best the four million efreet that protected the city and was eventually defeated and bound before the Sultan.\n\nAt some point, the [[frost giant]] [[Kostchtchie]] led an attack on the City of Brass in a devastating raid. By traveling aboard the flying [[Ark of Kwalish]], he and his followers caused much chaos.\n\nSome time in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ship ''[[Moonwind]]'' sank {{SI|50|miles|k|long=yes}} off the coast of [[Ravens Bluff]] and a passenger's ''[[well of many worlds]]'' unfurled, opening a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire. In the roughly four days that followed, water from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] drained into the portal and poured out on to the streets of the City of Brass.{{Cite polyhedron/77/Downunder the Living City|9-10, 13}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Plots and rumors abounded in the City of Brass, and a large degree of that concerned the efreet, if only for their numbers. Reputedly, the Sultan's court trafficked with [[baatezu]] from time to time, though much of these secret dealings happened behind closed curtains and only added to the tyranny of efreet rule.",
