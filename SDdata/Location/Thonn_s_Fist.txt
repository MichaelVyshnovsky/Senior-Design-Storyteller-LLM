}}'''Thonn's Fist''' (also known as '''Vosos''') was the largest island in the [[Archipelago of Altumbel]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Geography==
The island's was a massive [[granite]] cliff, originally referred to in some primitive [[human]] tongue as "Raunshee", a name meaning "club-head". Beneath its surface, Thonn's Fist was tunneled out by its [[kobold]] inhabitants, possibly connecting to the [[Underdark]] on mainland. These tunnels were so extensive that many of them suffered collapses on the surface. At least one of these collapses left open to the sky a huge cavern, which had been used by the kobolds as a temple to [[Kurtulmak]] until rainwater filled the cavern, turning it into a shallow lake.{{Cite dragon/216/Elminster's Notebook: Kobold commotions|100}}
===Flora & Fauna===
The kobolds that made their home on Thonn's Fist grew [[fungi]] on both its surface and within their underground dirt chambers.

==History==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], as part of larger invasion of islands south of [[Altumbel]] a force of kobolds overran Thonn's Fist, driving out what few hermits or fisher-folk were living there. In the years that followed at least pirate raids were conducted against the island, both of which the kobolds managed to repulse.

==Notable Locations==
* Temple of Kurtulmak: After a surface collapse and rainwater left the cavern it was housed in to become a lake, the kobolds relocated this to the deeper reaches of their warrens.
