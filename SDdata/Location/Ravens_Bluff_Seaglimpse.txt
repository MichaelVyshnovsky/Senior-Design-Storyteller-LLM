District
Seaglimpse,While there exist no sources that directly state that Seaglimpse and the Warehouse District are one and the same, the descriptions and map given in Nightwatch in the Living City place it firmly in the same location.The first known instance of the name "Seaglimpse" in any Living City media was in the sourcebook The City of Ravens Bluff, which is firmly set after the Three Women War. was an out-of-the-way neighborhood of Ravens Bluffs Harbor District.

Seaglimpses docks took in a great number of ships that came in from the Dragon Reach. The area was frequently pounded with rain and wind from storms, forcing sailors to chain their vessels down to several wharves to avoid being driven to wreck on the shore. Seaglimpse offered little in the way to attract visitors and tourists, unless someone specifically sought the smell of dead fish and the spray of salt water.
To remain vigilant against smuggling and illegal shipping shopping operations, the City Watch maintained regular patrols along the docks. Before such a presence, it was not uncommon to see longshoremen repacking and relabeling cargo and even live slave-auctioning in wide open view.
The area long had a history for seedy behavior, but criminal activity was significantly dampened in the early 14 century DR, circa 1335 DR &ndash 1350 DR, by the actions of Rolf Sunriver over the course of his first fifteen years in the City Watch.Gateway to Ravens Bluff (p. 7) states that Charles OKane has been Mayor of Ravens Bluff for 14 years, which tracks with the later article "Pillars of Ravens Bluff" in Polyhedron #147. This would put the "current year" for the people and events in the sourcebook as approximately 1355 DR.
Around the , as the Grand Conjunction was nearing in the Domains of Dread the boundaries between that plane of existence and the Prime Material plane were weakening, allowing for portals to open sporadically between the two around the Vast.Inferno in the Living City makes some references to the events of Nightwatch in the Living City, referring to them as happened four years prior. As that module has been estimated to be set in 1355 DR, that would place the events of Inferno in 1359 DR. From one such portal came a pyre elemental that found itself trapped in an iron flask  called the Cult of Red Ruin. Over the next two weeks the cultists caused several fires in Ravens Bluff, In the Warehouse District the fires were of such severity that they threatened to destroy several square blocks of buildings. The Red Ravens managed to arrive on the scene and put out the fires, but by then some residential buildings had been destroyed.
