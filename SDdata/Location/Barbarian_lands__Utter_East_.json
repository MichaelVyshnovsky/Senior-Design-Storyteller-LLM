        "mainbody": "East of the kingdom of [[Ulgarth]], in the northern [[Utter East]] of the far [[southeast Faerûn]] lay '''barbarian-inhabited lands'''.<ref group=\"note\">The name and exact location and nature of this area are unknown, but several sources make allusions to the area and it is depicted as a space on maps. This article is pieced together from such references.",
        "Geography": "The land was a vast plain, uncharted by the neighboring civilizations. In the west, by the border with Ulgarth, lay [[Barbarians' Road]]. A river ran across the far eastern side, and the plains abutted the [[A-Ling Shan]], part of the great [[Yehimal]], in the east and the first range crossing the Utter East in the south.<ref>",
        "Inhabitants": "The land was inhabited by a [[horse]]-riding barbarian people.<ref group=\"note\">Nothing is known of these people, not even their name, bar one capitalized mention of \"the Horde\" in [[The Shining South (1993)|''The Shining South'' (1993)]]. In earlier chapters, the book refers to the [[Tuigan Horde]], so it is possible the [[Tuigan]] were intended here. If so, the mentions of the \"Utter East\" in the Ulgarth chapter may have been intended to refer to the [[Hordelands]] and [[Kara-Tur]], as many early sourcebooks used \"the Utter East\" to refer to these lands. However, other sources conclusively placed the [[Utter East]] in the far [[southeast Faerûn]], well away from the Hordelands and Kara-Tur. Furthermore, maps and the mountainous geography around the Utter East make a connection to the Hordelands impossible. Thus, these barbarians cannot be the Tuigan Horde without a more complex explanation or invention.\n\nInstead, the barbarians might possibly be remnants of the barbarian tribes of [[Ulgarth]]'s history, when it was ruled by warchiefs, before colonization and the rise of cities and the kingdom. Alternatively, the artwork on page 77 of ''The Shining South'' depicts a horse-riding barbarian somewhat reminiscent of a Viking, suggesting they are descended from the [[Northmen]] who settled the Utter East. In the game ''[[Blood & Magic]]'', set in the Utter East, [[Rathgar the Raider]] is described as \"scourge of north lands\", suggesting a possible connection to this area. However, artwork is not necessarily representative, as this piece has been reused in several books.",
        "Relations": "In the 14th century [[DR]]. the folk of Ulgarth knew the people of this land as \"the Horde\", as barbarians to the east who regularly gathered in great hosts to raid their settlements. The kingdom was vigilant, well-prepared, and even paranoid in defending itself. Nevertheless, the people of the city of [[Kaspar]] preferred to trade with them, though guardedly, and took the pick of their horses after a raid.",
        "History": "[[Maelin Rascalin]], once a notorious bandit turned a convict soldier, became one of the greatest generals of Ulgarth's history by repeating hurling back invading armies of Horde barbarians. After successfully defending against a 1000-strong host, he was granted the barony of [[Suormpar]]; his grandson was baron by [[1367 DR]]."
