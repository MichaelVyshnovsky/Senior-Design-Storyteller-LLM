        "mainbody": "The Djinnis Claws were a group of islands in the Crowded Sea south of Zakhara, located to the west of the Steaming Isles and to the south of Jazayir al-Sartan.\nLittle was known about these islands and no enlightened Zakharans settled there. These mountainous islands of dense jungle were dreaded as the home of pirates, genies, and monsters.\nFour different groups of islands were usually recognized within the archipelago Yadd al-Djinni (\"Hand of the Djinni\") with the larger island of Kaff (\"Palm\") next to it, al-Zira (\"the Arm\") and the many small islands of Kalb Bahriy Sahr (\"Shark Reef\")."
