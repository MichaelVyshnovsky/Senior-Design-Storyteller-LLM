Nada al-Hazan was an island chain in the Crowded Sea south of Zakhara. Among the wild archipelagos of the sea, it was the island chain best explored and most settled by enlightened Zakharans. The islands were mainly rocky outcrops of the sea with low vegetation.
From the northernmost group of islands, the Masud Jazayir or "Fortunate Isles", with the main port of Bandar al-Saadat, civilization became declined down the island chain. At the end lay Jazirat al-Gawwar ("Island of the Whirlpool"), which was inaccessible by ship as an unpredictable whirlpool could appear anywhere around the island to doom mariners, giving the whole island chain its second sobriquet, the Strait of Sorrow.
As an outpost of Zakharan civilization far away from its centers, many inhabitants were descended from less-than-reputable forebears, so the islands retained a frontier character where the Law of the Loregiver was interpreted very loosely.
The islands produced a number of different fruits and seeds as well as cotton. They also had ship-building capabilities.
