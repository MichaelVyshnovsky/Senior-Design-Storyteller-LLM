Easthaven was one of the larger settlements that made up the collective Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. While it was once a small shanty town, Easthaven had a long a storied history that developed as it grew into a more and more prosperous trading community.
Originally just a small hamlet, the building of the Eastway trade road connecting Easthaven with the Bryn Shander―the largest settlement of the Ten Towns―proved to be a boon to the village. Over time it became fastest-growing community in the region with a fishing fleet rivaling that of its greatest competitor, Caer-Dineval. 
It was considered among the most comfortable of the Ten Towns, with good amenities that were uncommon among the settlements of Icewind Dale. Its people were seen as fairly friendly in comparison to their neighbors.
A breakwater protected most of the piers that reached out into Lac Dinneshere.

Easthaven was among the easternmost of the Ten Towns, situated on the shore of Lac Dinneshere, a short ways away from the Redwaters lake.
Easthaven was situated several hours travel away from the other Ten Towns. Going overland on foot, the travel times to nearby settlements and landmarks were
* Bryn Shander ― 7.5 hours via the Eastway. 
* Caer-Dineval ― 9 hours across a snow-covered path. 
* Good Mead ― 4.5 hours travel.
* Xorvintroth Ruins ― approximately three days east across the snowy wastes.
Like the other Ten Towns, Easthaven was governed by an elected speaker, who was chosen by the towns local business leaders. Defense of the town was overseen by the captain of the Easthaven militia.
While the town was not truly lawless, the locals said that "anything goes in Easthaven." Pickpocketing was decidedly made legal throughout the towns history.

Easthavens docks supported one of the largest fleets of fishing ships in all of Icewind Dale, greater than those of Caer-Konig and Caer-Dineval. This was not always the case however. Various accords between the three settlements changed the dynamics of regional fishing industries, with each town taking its place as leader of the three.
Fishing for knucklehead trout was easily the most lucrative and popular of the regions fishing industriues.
Despite their rivalries, each of the three towns on the lake supported ferries that allowed for easier travel between the settlements.
Circa the late 15 century, Easthaven could readily assemble a militia approximately 150 to 200 warriors strong. During that time it was led by the well-respected militia captain, Imdra Arlaggath. 
Easthaven was originally founded by a group of thieves that fled the duchy of Cape Velen in Tethyr.

In the , Easthavens leader Hrothgar assembled an expedition to Kuldahar following the arrival of a messenger. However, the expedition was ambushed by frost giants in Kuldahar Pass and the only survivors to reach Kuldahar were a newly arrived group of adventurers.
Later that year, a powerful devil by the name of Belhifet―who had been masquerading as an Ilmatari priest―recovered an ancient evil artifact known as the Crenshinibon. The fiend used the malevolent crystal to conjure a massive crystal tower over Easthaven as he attempted to open the portal to the Nine Hells that lay hidden beneath the local Tempuran chapel. The adventurers from Hrothgars expedition managed to defeat Belhifet, but the crystal spire shattered as the fiend was cut down. While some of Easthaven was destroyed in the conflict, it was later rebuilt along with a new temple to Tempus the Foehammer.
Following the fiends defeat, the town of Easthaven created the powerful enchanted flail called the Defender of Easthaven. The weapon was meant to remain in the town as a symbol and a reminder of the time when Easthaven was almost destroyed.
It was said that in a time before the Era of Upheaval, cities south of the Spine got "white gold fever", and people came it droves to the Ten Towns to find their own fortune fishing Knucklehead trout. While other settlements of the Ten Towns grew larger and more prosperous, Easthavens growth remained stunted for some time.
It was not until around the mid–14 century DR that Easthaven saw great commercial success come their way. After the Eastway road was paved over, a great many traders, craftspeople, traveling warriors, and others set out for new lives in Icewind Dale, and often began their journeys in Easthaven. This prolific growth drew away prospectors and others from the neighboring Ten Towns, to the point where the council at Bryn Shander had to weigh in on the matter.
Easthaven was the site where the evil wizard Akar Kessell murdered his mentor Morkai the Red in the .
When the Battle of Icewind Dale broke out near Bryn Shander in the , Glensather waded into a group of orcs and managed to kill at least two of the invaders. But as Glensather made his way to the barbarian hero Wulfgar, a spear was driven into his back and the towns leader was killed.

On Marpenoth 3 in the , pirates aboard the Howling Fiend led by Derrick Gaffner launched a raid against Easthaven. They attempted to steal weaponry from Rurdens Armory. The attack was part of a greater plot by the returned lich Akar Kessell to throw the Ten Towns into chaos. 
Along with the other Ten Towns―and in fact all of Icewind Dale―Easthaven was plunged into eternal darkness in the , when the goddess Auril cursed the lands with the Everlasting Rime. The intense cold brought on by the supernatural climate shift forced closed the Easthaven ferry, and slowed growth of numerous businesses. Industry no longer prospered in Easthaven and its prosperous growth came to an end.
The dramatic change brought out the worst of people in the Ten Towns. In Easthaven and two other settlements, locals set up a ghastly lottery that forced an innocent person to be chosen as a living sacrifice, in the vain attempt to appease the Frostmaiden and end their hardships. Even worse perhaps, those that had the power often rigged the selections to their benefit or the detriment of others. 
During the , the closed down Easthaven Ferry was taken over by a band of duergar from the fortress of Sunblight in the Spine of the World Mountains. They used the abandoned locale to continue and extend their search for any deposits of chardalyn across the Ten Towns.
Some time later Easthaven was attacked by a small horde of awakened beasts led by an exceptionally intelligent winter wolf called Fortararavkott and her verbeeg servant Tolvmeter. The beasts were turned away by a band of adventurers, who rallied aide from some of the nearby Ten Towns.
