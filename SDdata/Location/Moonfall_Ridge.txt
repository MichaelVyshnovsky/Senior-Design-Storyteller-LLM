Moonfall Ridge was a clifface overlooking the town of Aithelar in the kingdom of Callidyrr on Alaron in the Moonshae Isles.
Moonfall Ridge was found directly north of Aithelar, beginning on the coast of the Sea of Moonshae and passing east until ending near the edge of the Dernall Forest. A trail passed through a small pass through the cliffs eastern side that led to a quarry.
