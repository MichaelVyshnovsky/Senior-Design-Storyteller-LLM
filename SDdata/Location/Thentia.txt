Waukeen
Thentia was a city located in the Moonsea North region of Faerûn. It was well known for its citizens impassioned sense of self-determination, its reputation as the free and open of the cities around the Moonsea lake, as well as its significant population of arcane spellcasters.
Thentia was considered to have an unrestrained albeit disorderly spirit, without the ever-present malice harbored by some cities of the Moonsea. Much of the city was considered to be a rough and crude place.
Unlike much of the Moonsea, particularly neighboring Melvaunt, the weather in Thentia was most often rather pleasant, resembling a crisp Spring day.
The city was located at the mouth of the River Thent, where it emptied into the Moonsea lake. The Sword Trail ran west from the city along the coast towards Melvaunt, and the Ruined Way went northeast towards Hulburg.
Elected by the citys nobility each year, Thentias head of state was its Watchlord - an inheritor who served as little more than a symbolic figurehead. They were largely responsible for overseeing trade contracts and maintaining commercial regulations within the city, known as the Trade Decrees. The Watchlord along also oversaw the city watch, and elected trial juries from among the citys residents.
The fate of Thentias citizens was truly in the hands of the Thentias noble families, each of which were offered support by the citys numerous independent mages.
Altogether Thentias government was considered quite enlightened and progressive by Moonsea standards.
Thievery was absolutely not tolerated in Thentia, and no thieving guilds were permitted to operate within its walls.
Similarly, anyone caught committing any sort of commercial malfeasance such as extortion, fraud or economic subversion were severe punishments. While the sentences were harsh, including fine, imprisonment, and even death the greater penalty was the damage done to a persons commercial reputation.
Thentia was a free-spirited place that welcomed those that did not fit in with Realms around the Sea of Fallen Stars. A relaxed atmosphere filled the citys streets and its citizens often had little cares beyond their own personal goals.
Nobles in Thentia were granted the titles of "Lord" or "Lady" along with scarce few benefits. They were permitted to fly their own coat-of-arms and keep a private force of no more than 40 men in house livery.
Citizens of Thentia enjoyed low taxes and affordable establishments in their city, allowing for free-flowing commerce and the continued fostering of the entrepreneurial spirit.
People looking to take up residence within the city had to pay a tax of anywhere from 3 to 5 gp for the season. Ships docking at the city were required to pay a 1 gp fee.
Due to its focus on free enterprise, Thentia conducted more trade outside its borders than other, larger Moonsea cities.
Thentia had one of the weakest militaries among the Moonsea powers. They were guarded by a cavalry of some sixty mounted soldiers known as the Riders of Thentia.
The city watch known as the Warders served as Thentias police force. 10 of whom were always stationed at the Watchlords Tower.
While Thentia boasted no navy, their ships were protected by citys resident spellcasters. In truth, Thentias archmages were impressive enough in their own right to discourage open aggression taken towards the city or their sea trade.
The city was founded at the start of the 9 century DR, in the .
In the , Thentia was among the settlements and city-states that lent their resources to the reconstruction of the ancient Citadel of the Raven in the northern slopes of the Dragonspine Mountains.
During the early 14 century, circa the , Thentia was captured and occupied by Maerhul, one of the lords of Zhentil Keep. The citys residents left their home for nearby Hillsfar then slowly reintegrated themselves into its walls as merchants and traders. In short order they threw the Zhentarims economic hold over the city in disarray, and Thentia was freed from its control.
Later on it was among the powers of the Moonsea that agreed to the treaty of unity put forth by the Coronal of Myth Drannor some time before the . The cities and nations allied themselves to stand against the returned empire of Netheril and its campaign of conquest against the Realms of north Faerûn. After the conflict came to end and Netherils plans were thwarted, Thentia and many of the Moonseas smaller cities strove to form their own identity in the Realms, lest they come under the heel of another over-zealous power.
Local legend spoke of an intelligent blade known as the Bright Sword that hovered throughout the city at times, cutting down members of the citys spellcasting community. It was said the sword craved the unique magical items that these individuals possessed.
