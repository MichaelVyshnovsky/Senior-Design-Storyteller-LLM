The '''Shining Plains''' was a portion of the [[Vilhon Reach]], named after the visual effect of sunlight hitting the plains. The plains themselves were not held by any cohesive force, instead being composed of human-filled city-states, wemic and centaur tribes, and a powerful druidic organization called the [[Emerald Enclave]].

{{quote|The Shining Plains are many things, lad, but a "kingdom" ain't one of them. If you can imagine grasslands as far as your eyes can see - with just a few cities scattered around for good measure - then you've got a pretty good idea of The Shining Plains. Aye, and they've got [[horse]]s too.|[[Miritol Kran]], Sage of [[Alagh√¥n]]}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, [[Great Fires (Shining Plains)|Great Fires]] raged through the Shining Plains. The cause was unknown, however, the [[Church of Talos]] took credit for the disaster. Later, followers of the Destroyer erected a shrine in the Planes in celebration of the calamity.

Following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the northwestern reaches of the Plains became the badlands known as [[Xian]].
