        "mainbody": "Thruldar, the most westerly outpost of Estagund, was found on the border of Luiren, on the edge of the Lluirwood. It was located along the trade route which ran from Estagund and Durpar west to Delzimmer in northern Luiren in the lands between the Lluirwood and the Toadsquat Mountains. Referred to as Traders Way, the great Trade Way, or the Great Traders Way., this was presumably a section of Traders Way, or a branch of it.This road is shown on older maps (The Forgotten Realms Atlas, page 11) and The Shining South (1993) as winding between the Toadsquat Mountains and the Lluirwood, but newer maps show no such road (FRCS 3rd-edition map and Shining South (sourcebook), page 143).\nAt some point this was a thriving town of around 9,000, around a third of which were hin and special facilities for smaller folk could be found in most inns. The prominent halfling Baker chaka did business here, dealing in exotic foodstuffs, and it was the home base of the Cochin chaka, which specialised in woodworking and over half the population either worked for or with. Their warehouses dominated the town along with sawmills and woodworking shops. Wood from the Lluirwood was shipped all over the Shining Lands and Luiren. The two largest temples were to Tymora and Silvanus.The estimated date for the information in The Shining South (1993) is 1367 DR, but maps use the ruin icon for this settlement, and according to later sources (Shining South (sourcebook) Thruldar was destroyed in 1264 DR.\nThruldar fell into ruin following its destruction by a druid named Voolad Espiral and his army of dark trees and other plant creatures. Most of the inhabitants were slain during the surprise attack and the town was razed. Several of the local ghostwise hin tribes banded together to slay the druid, but he would soon rise again as a ghost. The hin placed powerful spells upon Thruldars walls and sealed the spirit and his remaining minions inside. Thereafter they kept careful watch on the area to discourage adventures seeking the settlements abandoned wealth from disturbing the wards and possibly freeing Voolad. Although Voolad had been long since dead, his mad spirit remained trapped in the settlement and was released during the Spellplague."
