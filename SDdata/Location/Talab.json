        "Geography": "Talab lay on the source of [[Al-Muti River]] approximately {{SI|100|miles|k}} inland due east of the coast of the [[Golden Gulf]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Situated at the crossroads between the League of the Pantheon, the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] and the [[Haunted Lands]], visitors from very different cultures stopped here, while the inhabitants kept mainly to themselves. \n\nTalab was able to exist and thrive because of a series of ingenious underground conduits tapping a water supply within [[Al-Sayaj Mountains]]. This water supply was fiercely protected against any threats. \n\nThe caliph of Talab in 1367 DR was [[Kia al-Sadid]].",
        "Activities": "The so-called City of Questing was both home to a strong slave-trade and an important university specializing in [[Gods of the Pantheon|Pantheist religion]] and medicine.",
        "Trade": "Talab exported fine fabrics, slaves, and medicine.",
        "Defenses": "The [[Sword of the True Gods]] kept 3,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry stationed in Talab. Their primary concern was protecting trade and guarding the main pass leading into the Ruined Kingdoms. The city also maintained a watch of 1,000 guards and 100 clerical reserves. The [[mamluk]] units of the [[Parched Mamluk Society]], numbering 900 men, guarded the water supply."
