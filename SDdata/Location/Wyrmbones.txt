The '''Wyrmbones''' was a small mountain range in the [[Channath Vale]] of southern [[Shaar]] that got its name from one of the tribes of the Shaar who believed that the range were bones of a massive slumbering skeletal [[dragon]].

==Description==
[[File:Fryndul.png|thumb|''An earlier map showing the Wyrmbones.'']]
The Wyrmbones and its hilly southeastern extension known as the Cauldron stood to the east from the wild and unexplored [[Misty Vale (forest)|Misty Vale]] and to the west from the [[Shaareach Forest]]. The town of [[Kormul]] was in the close vicinity of the Wyrmbones.

==Notable Inhabitants==
The Wyrmbones were home to a population of [[rage drake]]s that preyed on Shiertalaran trade caravans that moved on land and along the [[Talar River]]. Roaming bands of marauding [[gnoll]] raiders had their homes in the Wyrmbones as well as in the nearby [[Dun Hills (Lapaliiya)|Dun Hills]].
