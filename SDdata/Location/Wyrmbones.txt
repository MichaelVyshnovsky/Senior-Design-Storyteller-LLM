The Wyrmbones was a small mountain range in the Channath Vale of southern Shaar that got its name from one of the tribes of the Shaar who believed that the range were bones of a massive slumbering skeletal dragon.

The Wyrmbones and its hilly southeastern extension known as the Cauldron stood to the east from the wild and unexplored Misty Vale and to the west from the Shaareach Forest. The town of Kormul was in the close vicinity of the Wyrmbones.
The Wyrmbones were home to a population of rage drakes that preyed on Shiertalaran trade caravans that moved on land and along the Talar River. Roaming bands of marauding gnoll raiders had their homes in the Wyrmbones as well as in the nearby Dun Hills.
