        "mainbody": "Gray Oaks was a small village of halfling farmers in the heartlands of Cormyr.\nGray Oaks was a prosperous village and bustling agricultural center until it was destroyed and turned into a blasted ruin populated by stubborn holdouts. After its ruination it was a quiet place of simple means, with about 20 buildings and no fortifications.\nGray Oaks was situated in the Northbank region, north of the Starwater River and south of the Kings Forest, several miles west of Hilp and Calantars Way.\nGray Oaks was formerly the largest market in Cormyr and the center of the halfling-dominated Northbank farmlands. After it was razed, Jesters Green became the main meeting place for farmers and caravans to meet, though several storage sheds were built for storing produce.\nGray Oaks had a reputation across Cormyr for having excellent wood craftsmen, and after it was razed it continued to be inhabited by stubborn halfling artisans. Several families of humans also made there home there, harvesting the mushrooms and mosses that grew on the rocks thereabouts. A particular kind of moss was found there that glowed, and it could be distilled into a useful substance used in making spell inks and glowing magical items.\nGray Oaks was once known as Black Oaks, the \"breadbasket of Northbank\" and the largest farmers market in Cormyr. It was mostly destroyed during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, and razed again later during some sort of magical battle involving War Wizards and an enemy force, the details of which were much exaggerated.\nAlthough the village continued to be inhabited in the 1360s DR, it was a shadow of its former self. It gradually recovered over time, reaching a population of 800 by 1479 DR\n* The nature of the battle that destroyed Gray Oaks for the second time was widely speculated about. War Wizards were a consistent feature, but different stories had them fighting against Zhentarim wizards, Cyricist priests, or the avatar of Cyric himself.\n* Gray Oaks had a legend regarding the nearby Tearflow stream, involving a Purple Dragon, a lady love, a crystal chalice, and a unicorn.\n* The Trailswatch inn, a base for hunters to go on guided hunts nearby.\n* Sabrast Windriver owned an estate at Gray Oaks, among his other assets."
