        "mainbody": "'''Gray Oaks''' was a small village of [[halfling]] farmers in the [[Cormyr/Heartlands|heartlands]] of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "Gray Oaks was a prosperous village and bustling agricultural center until it was destroyed and turned into a blasted ruin populated by stubborn holdouts. After its ruination it was a quiet place of simple means, with about 20 buildings and no fortifications.",
        "Geography": "Gray Oaks was situated in the [[Northbank (Cormyr)|Northbank]] region, north of the [[Starwater River]] and south of the [[King's Forest]], several miles west of [[Hilp]] and [[Calantar's Way]].",
        "Trade": "Gray Oaks was formerly the largest market in Cormyr and the center of the halfling-dominated [[Northbank (Cormyr)|Northbank]] farmlands. After it was razed, [[Jester's Green]] became the main meeting place for farmers and caravans to meet, though several storage sheds were built for storing produce.\n\nGray Oaks had a reputation across Cormyr for having excellent wood craftsmen, and after it was razed it continued to be inhabited by stubborn halfling artisans. Several families of [[human]]s also made there home there, harvesting the [[mushroom]]s and [[moss]]es that grew on the rocks thereabouts. A particular kind of moss was found there that glowed, and it could be distilled into a useful substance used in making spell [[ink]]s and glowing magical items.",
        "History": "Gray Oaks was once known as '''Black Oaks''', the \"breadbasket of Northbank\" and the largest farmer's market in Cormyr. It was mostly destroyed during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], and razed again later during some sort of magical battle involving [[War Wizards]] and an enemy force, the details of which were much exaggerated.\n\nAlthough the village continued to be inhabited in the 1360s [[DR]], it was a shadow of its former self. It gradually recovered over time, reaching a population of 800 by [[1479 DR]]",
        "Rumors & Legends": "* The nature of the battle that destroyed Gray Oaks for the second time was widely speculated about. War Wizards were a consistent feature, but different stories had them fighting against [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]]s, [[Cyricist]] [[priest]]s, or the [[avatar]] of [[Cyric]] himself.\n* Gray Oaks had a legend regarding the nearby [[Tearflow]] stream, involving a [[Purple Dragons|Purple Dragon]], a lady love, a crystal chalice, and a [[unicorn]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Trailswatch]] inn, a base for hunters to go on guided hunts nearby.\n* [[Sabrast Windriver]] owned an estate at Gray Oaks, among his other assets.{{Cite digital book/Elminster in Hell|?|14}}"
