'''Akanax''' was a harsh, warlike city in the [[Akanal]] region of [[Chessenta]] known for its talented smiths, its rigid military structure, and its intolerance of outsiders. It collected tithes and tributes from the Akanal region and conquered settlements such as [[Rodanar]] and [[Oslin]]

==Description==
Structures within Akanax typically lacked ornamentation, and the majority of its population lived in tents surrounding the city.

==Defenses==
By 1357 DR, Akanax had an army of 15,000 infantry units and 5,000 archers. It also controlled 10 warships.

==Government==
Criminal matters in Akanax were decided primarily by a military tribune, but the king also possessed the power to exile or execute any dissent to his rule.

==Relationships==
The people of Akanax viewed the inhabitants of [[Heptios (city)|Heptios]] as "fat philosophers". They had a more complex relationship with [[Cimbar]], admiring its fighting spirit while also seeming to disparage its arts and culture.

==Culture==
Akanaxian culture was notoriously harsh and militant. Citizens were raised by the state. Any male citizens incapable of fighting were executed, while female citizens lived lives of servitude. Male citizens of Akanax could not marry until they were 20 years old. Outsiders to the city were generally distrusted.

==History==
In [[1154 DR]], Akanax laid siege to the city of Cimbar alongside the forces of [[Soorenar]].

In [[1307 DR]] Akanax went to war with the city of [[Maerduuth]], which was eradicated in the aftermath of the conflict.

In [[1347 DR]], conflict with [[Soorenar]] laid waste to much of the city.

[[1358 DR]] brought brief glory to Akanax. At the beginning of the [[Time of Troubles]], the god [[Hoar]] appeared in Akanax, taking the form of King Hippartes as his avatar. He then proceeded to lead Akanax in a military campaign against Cimbar, [[Luthcheq]], and Soorenar. Eventually, Akanax emerged victorious from this conflict, uniting the other cities into an alliance before leading them against [[Unther]]. Ultimately, Hoar was defeated by the god [[Anhur]] and the Chessentans routed. Following the [[Godswar]] and the gods' return to the planes, this alliance crumbled.
