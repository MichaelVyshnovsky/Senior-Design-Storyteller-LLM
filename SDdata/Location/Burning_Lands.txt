The Burning Lands referred to a specific area in Zakhara where the northern reaches of the Haunted Lands bordered other major geographical features in the region.
This extremely arid region effectively separated the vast expanse of the Great Anvil in the south from the Weeping Desert, the Genies Garden, and the fortress of Krak al-Niraan by 1367 DR. The Furrowed Mountains enveloped the Burning Lands from the north and west.
