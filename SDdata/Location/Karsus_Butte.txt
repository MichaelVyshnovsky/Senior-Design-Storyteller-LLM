The Karsus Butte was the petrified remains of the Momentary God Karsus, the Netherese arcanist that achieved godhood for a single moment.
The mesa-like rock formation was made up of coarse, red sandstone
Wild magic radiated outward from the Butte, extending out to Karse and the surrounding Dire Wood.
It lay within the Dire Wood region of the eastern High Forest. The city of Karse was built at the "foot" of the fallen god.
Karsus Butte was the source of the Heartblood River, the foaming red-hued waterway that flowed westward through the forest.
The butte was formed immediately after Karsuss Folly in the , when Karsus was destroyed a moment after achieving apostheosis and his godly remains plummeted down to Toril.
On Hammer 1 in the , Galaeron Nihmedu used magic from a powerful artifact taken from within the Karsus Butte to summon the Return of the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar to Faer√ªn from the plane of Shadow. 
The single notable structure atop the Karsus Butte was the Shrine of the Undying Heart, a temple built atop the butte dedicated to the Momentary God.
Karsus Butte was considered a holy site by the cultists that worshiped him.
* Wulgreth, the lich and former archmage that made his lair within the Karsus Butte centuries after his fall.
