Settlement
Reithwin was a ruined and abandoned town located between Baldurs Gate and Elturel in the Shadow-cursed Lands.
Once a haven for worshippers of Selûne, the town along with the surrounding lands was consumed by the Shadow Curse unleashed by Ketheric Thorm, a former devoted Selûnite follower who eventually turned to the cult of the Absolute as leading general.
The town was located on the banks of the River Chionthar to the west of Elturel in the Shadow-cursed Lands. This town could be traveled to from a mountain pass known as the Risen Road or through the Underdark (via a temple of Selûne). A toll was required for passage through the town. The Grand Mausoleum was constructed to serve as the final resting place of the Thorm family.

Reithwin was founded by the followers of Selûne.
According to the Infernal Mason from the House of Hope, Reithwin and the Moonrise Towers used to be a happy home to his then master Ketheric Thorm until a tragedy happened and his wife Melodia passed away.
Circa the , Ketheric had turned to the goddess of Shar to cope with the loss of his daughter Isobel. Forming a Sharran army of Dark Justiciars from the Underdark, the town of Reithwin became a battlefield between Ketherics followers and opposing forces of Shar. As Ketheric was beginning to lose the war against the anti-Sharran forces he unleashed the Shadow Curse out of desperation, turning the whole town into a darkened wasteland.
In the year 1492 DR, a century after the Shadow Curse devoured the town, the curse was still lingering, and anyone daring to pass through would require carrying a moonlantern or being Sharran-blessed to survive.
If the shadow curse were to be lifted by the Absolute Adversaries, people from the Cionthar Valley and Baldurs Gate were ready to resettle the ruined town mere six months after the end of the Absolute crisis.
