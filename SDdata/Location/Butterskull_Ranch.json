        "mainbody": "Butterskull Ranch was a farm owned by Alfonse Kalazorn, the former sheriff of Triboar.\nButterskull ranch raised cattle, horses, pigs, and chickens coops, and grew vegetables, corn, and apples. The ranch was surrounded by wooden fences and a path led from the Triboar Trail to the two-story farmhouse where Alfonse and his ranch hands lived. The Butterskull Ranch got its name because Alfonse sold lumps of butter molded into the shapes of humanoid skulls. The butter was made from the milk of the cow Petunia.\nThe ranch lay  east of Conyberry along the Triboar Trail, nestled between two hills on the north side of the road.\nAlfonse Kalazorn built the farm as a cattle and horse ranch in the late 15 century DR. Later, he added the pig farm, chicken coops, vegetable gardens, corn fields, and an apple orchard. He began producing his skull-shaped butter mostly to see to towns and cities to the east, although he also did business with Barthens Provisions in the village of Phandalin to the west.\nA few years later, the ranch was attacked by a small band of orcs who had been driven from Icespire Hold by the white dragon Cryovain. The orcs freed the pigs and set the barn and the smithy on fire. A few other animals, including Petunia, also escaped. Alfonse and five of his ranch hands tried to defend the ranch but Alfonse was captured and the hands were killed. Only one ranch hand survived and fled on horseback to Phandalin to get help."
