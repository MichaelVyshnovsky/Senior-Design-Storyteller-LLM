Cape Talath was a rocky outcropping found near the border of Thindol and Tashalar on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
Cape Talath was located on the Shining Sea about halfway between the cities of Tashluta and Narubel. The cape was actually a small area of the larger Hazur Mountains that formed much of the border between Thindol and Tashalar.
The waters of Cape Talath were made treacherous by surging waters expelled from the vast subterranean waterway known as Labrands Folly which was connected to the cape.
