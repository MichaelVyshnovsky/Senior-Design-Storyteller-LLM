'''Cape Talath''' was a rocky outcropping found near the border of [[Thindol]] and [[Tashalar]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
Cape Talath was located on the [[Shining Sea]] about halfway between the cities of [[Tashluta]] and [[Narubel]]. The cape was actually a small area of the larger [[Hazur Mountains]] that formed much of the border between Thindol and Tashalar.

==Description==
The waters of Cape Talath were made treacherous by surging waters expelled from the vast subterranean waterway known as [[Labrand's Folly]] which was connected to the cape.
