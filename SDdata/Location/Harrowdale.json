        "mainbody": "{{otheruses4|the dale in the Dalelands|the town formerly named Harrowdale Town|New Velar}}\n'''Harrowdale''', formerly '''Velarsdale''' and '''Halvan's Dale''', was the oldest of the surviving dales within the [[Dalelands]]. before it was changed to [[New Velar]] in [[1428 DR]].",
        "Culture": "Inhabitants of Harrowdale were known as ''Harrans'', sometimes also ''Harrovans'' or ''Velarr'', and as of [[1368 DR]], were primarily farmers and foresters. [[Cormyr]]eans and [[Sembia]]ns would sometimes use the term ''Harrowdalesmen'', but this was frowned upon by its inhabitants.\n\nHarrans were generally tolerant to outsiders, including new goods and ideas, tight-lipped around strangers however, and often gave outsiders the impression they were dim-witted. Harrans would use the phrases ''\"up Green way\"'' or ''\"deep in the Green\"'' to refer to someone who was in the newly wooden part of the dale between [[Velarswood]] and [[Cormanthor]].\n\nDespite being invaded in the years prior to 1374 DR, by this time, the dale still mostly kept its \"oldblood\" farming families from its founding days, such as [[Brondas]], [[Dyzur]], [[Mumfyrd]] and [[Routhgaer]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Harrowdale}}",
        "Government": {
            "Law and defense": "The [[Grey Riders]],<ref group=\"note\">In [[Volo's Guide to the Dalelands]] they are referred to as ''Gray Riders'' were a group of mounted [[ranger]]s used to guard against bandits or monsters in the woods of the dale. In 1368 DR, the Riders had no authority to make arrests, but by 1374 DR, they had been granted the power of arrest, to keep prisoners in captivity, and transport them to Harrowdale Town for justice by the [[Seven Burghers|Council]].\n\nThe citizens of Harrowdale have always had the right to burn or bury the dead. This was in order to prevent the spread of disease, but has been used to cover up many murders.\n\nThe felling of trees from the edge of the forest of Cormanthor or the Velarswood was forbidden as of 1374 DR."
        },
        "History": "Harrowdale was originally known as ''Velarsdale'', after its founder [[Velar]]. Between [[1120 DR]] and the 1180s, the dale was often invaded by adventurers and mercenaries, often coming north from [[Sembia]], who would proclaim themselves ''\"Lord\"'' of the dale. During these years, it was held by: [[Thaundass Rahr]], [[Orimmon]], [[Feltaern Urnsarr]], [[Imbar Thaelwood]], [[Elzar Darth]], [[Harlstakh Kethtor]] and [[Elmaer Oraun]]. At some point before the 1180s DR, under the rule of Orimmon, the dale was renamed to ''Harrowdale'' and then, by Elmaer Oraun, back to ''Velarsdale''.\n\nIn the 1180s DR, [[Halvan the Dark]] seized the dale and renamed it ''Halvan's Dale''. After Halvan's fall the dale's name reverted back to ''Harrowdale''.\n\nIn [[1356 DR]], Lord [[Lashan Aumersair]] of [[Scardale]] invaded and conquered Harrowdale in the [[second inter-dale war]], but his forces were soon defeated. After the misfortunes of the neighboring [[Scardale]], which was in a relative state of chaos after the war it started,\n\nFollowing the actions of Sembia to annex or outright invade various dales in the early 15{{th}} century, Harrowdale struck an alliance with renewed Myth Drannor, restored the [[Standing Stone]] and renamed their capital city to ''New Velar'' in 1428 DR.",
        "Ecology": "The land of Harrowdale was well-suited to grow berries and vines. Although some wooden stump and rail fences existed there were an abundance of hedgerows, which were generally pruned well. Some Harrans kept small lots for the growth of trees, such as [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]]s, [[maple]]s and [[pine]]s. These acted as ideal sites for the cultivation of mushrooms, shade for livestock and a source lumber if the need arose. Orchards of apple, pear and [[grus-grus]] were common throughout the dale.",
        "Geographical features": "Harrowdale was formed from a river valley with rolling woodlands to the north. As of [[1372 DR]] the river had long disappeared and was thought to have been lost during [[Underdark]] mining. The marshy areas of Harrowdale had, in prior times, mostly been consumed by irrigation of agricultural lands in the dale, although many small creeks and ponds remained. \n\nThere were also traces of a previous society-old throughout the dale. Cut-off bridges, old mill stones and crumbling stone walls were scattered throughout the landscape.\n\n* [[Cold Field]]: A sparsely landmarked moor that was haunted by the spirits of warriors killed in battle.\n\n* [[Velarswood]]: This ancient forest was full of dangers that kept loggers to its outer fringes. Among the perils within were [[cloaker]]s, [[stirge]]s and [[drow]].",
        "Notable locations": {
            "Settlements": "Most cottages in Harrowdale were sealed with mud cement and then whitewashed, with a thatched roof, sometimes covered in a layer of earth. Due to the fear of disease following the second inter-dale war, paddocks and inns typically had a horsepond, through which all incoming animals had to be led before being allowed to stable overnight. Inns also typically had a bed of sand or mud that visitors had to scrub in, before a pond in which they must wash. Sometimes the clergy of local temples, who also had such baths for their members and guests, would cast purifying [[magic]] on these waters.\n\nMany farm plots in Harrowdale had a separate storage cellar, made from stone and lined with mud, used to store items that would be sold to merchants working Harrowdale routes. This practice, along with the law against felling trees, led to the area between the Velarswood and the edge of Cormanthor to contain smaller woodland plots, as of 1374 DR.\n\nThe settlements within Harrowdale included:\n* [[Dead Oak]] : A hamlet on the [[Harrow Ride]].\n\n* [[Lanfroe]] : Another small village on the Harrow Ride.\n\n* [[New Velar]] : As of 1368 DR, the capital, and one of only two ports along the Dragon Reach in the Dalelands.\n\n* [[Velarsburg]] : A market town in the north of Harrowdale, west of the Velarswood, and as of 1368 DR, the center of logging and carpentry trades.\n\n* [[Velartree]] : A hamlet marking the north western end of the [[Harrow Ride]] and the start of the Halfaxe Trail through the forest of Cormanthor.",
            "Temples": "* [[Temple of the Harvest Moon]]: The center of this impressively-built temple was a giant [[copper]] moon that was continuously illuminated with magic."
