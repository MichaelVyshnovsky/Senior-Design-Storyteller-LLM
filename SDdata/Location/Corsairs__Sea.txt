The Principality of the Corsairs Sea was the northwestern principality of Tethyr, the official domain of the heir to the throne, and the original homeland of the Tethyrian tribes.
Located north of the Starspire Mountains,
Though it covered a large portion of land, most of the Principality of the Corsairs Sea was forested and thus sparsely populated. The most notable city in the region was Velen.
On paper, the principality was ruled in 1370 DR by the heir to the throne of Tethyr, the Princess Sybille Rhindaun. However, as she was only a small child at that time, her authority passed to her regent and father, King Haedrak Rhindaun III.
The founding twelve clans of Tethyr originated in this region.
