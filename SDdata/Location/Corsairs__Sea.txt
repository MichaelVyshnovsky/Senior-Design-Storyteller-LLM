The '''Principality of the Corsairs' Sea''' was the northwestern [[wikipedia:en:Principality|principality]] of [[Tethyr]], the official domain of the heir to the throne, and the original homeland of the [[Tethyrian]] tribes.

==Geography==
Located north of the [[Starspire Mountains]],

Though it covered a large portion of land, most of the Principality of the Corsairs' Sea was forested and thus sparsely populated. The most notable city in the region was [[Velen]].

==Government==
On [[paper]], the principality was ruled in [[1370 DR]] by the heir to the throne of Tethyr, the Princess [[Sybille Rhindaun]]. However, as she was only a small child at that time, her authority passed to her regent and father, King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]].

==History==
The founding twelve clans of Tethyr originated in this region.
