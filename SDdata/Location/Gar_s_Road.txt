The Gars Road was a road somewhere in Faerûn during the mid–8 century DR.
The Gars Road stretched east and west from its intersection with the Larrauden in a vale it shared with Buckralams Starn, a small village. To the west of Buckralams Starn, the Gars Road touched the eastern ridges of Howling Ghost Wood, going over the top of Hurtle Tor, and leading to the Shrine of the Sheaf.
