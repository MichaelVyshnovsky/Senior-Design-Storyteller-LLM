The '''Gar's Road''' was a road somewhere in [[Faerûn]] during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The Gar's Road stretched east and west from its intersection with the [[Larrauden]] in a vale it shared with [[Buckralam's Starn]], a small village. To the west of Buckralam's Starn, the Gar's Road touched the eastern ridges of [[Howling Ghost Wood]], going over the top of [[Hurtle Tor]], and leading to the [[Shrine of the Sheaf]].
