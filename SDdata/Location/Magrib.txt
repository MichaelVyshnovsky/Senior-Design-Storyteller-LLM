'''Magrib''' was a small town found within [[interior Zakhara]] and the [[Cities of the Heart]].

==Geography==
Found along the western shore of the small strait separating [[Suq Bay]] from the [[Golden Gulf]], Magrib was the only place of note in an otherwise unsettled region of Zakhara. Magrib hugged the coast of the South Quarter of Suq Bay within a river valley fed by an unnamed river.
