A '''waymeet''' was the name given to temporary villages of tents that cropped up at large campgrounds found in [[Narfell]].

==Description==
Typically, any of the larger campsites along the worn roads of Narfell could be considered a waymeet. Given their transitory nature, the population of a waymeet was highly variable.

==History==
Some of the larger and more frequently used waymeets in [[1357 DR]] included [[Jiyyd]], [[Peltarch]], [[Nobis]], and [[Bezentil]].

==Notable Waymeets==
* [[Antlerbones]] along the [[Cold Road]] in northern Narfell.
* [[Bezentil]] along the [[Great Road]] in the [[Great Dale]].
* [[Hoarbridge]] at the end of the Cold Road on the shore of [[Icelace Lake]].
* [[Jiyyd]] along the [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]] where it met the road to Peltarch.
* [[Kront]] at the crossroads of the Cold Road and the Great Road.
* [[N'Jast]] at the crossroads of the Cold Road and Long Road.
* [[Nobis]] on the southern shore of Icelace Lake.
* [[Ormpur (Narfell)|Ormpur]] along the Long Road in central Narfell.
* [[Peltarch]] on the southern shore of Icelace Lake.
* [[Snowcap]] along the Cold Road north of N'Jast.
