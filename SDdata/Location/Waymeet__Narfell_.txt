A waymeet was the name given to temporary villages of tents that cropped up at large campgrounds found in Narfell.
Typically, any of the larger campsites along the worn roads of Narfell could be considered a waymeet. Given their transitory nature, the population of a waymeet was highly variable.
Some of the larger and more frequently used waymeets in 1357 DR included Jiyyd, Peltarch, Nobis, and Bezentil.
* Antlerbones along the Cold Road in northern Narfell.
* Bezentil along the Great Road in the Great Dale.
* Hoarbridge at the end of the Cold Road on the shore of Icelace Lake.
* Jiyyd along the Long Road where it met the road to Peltarch.

* NJast at the crossroads of the Cold Road and Long Road.
