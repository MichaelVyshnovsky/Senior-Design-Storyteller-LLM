The '''Wave District''' of [[Athkatla]] housed many of the city's maritime businesses, such as shipwrights, cartographers, and nautical traders. Interestingly enough, it was home to many [[:category:scribes|scribes]] and scholars. It was located in the northwest portion of the city, along the [[Sea of Swords]] and northern bank of the [[Alandor River]]. Alamander's Gate led northward out of the city.

==Notable locations==

*[[Moonhall]]: A temple of [[Sel√ªne]]
