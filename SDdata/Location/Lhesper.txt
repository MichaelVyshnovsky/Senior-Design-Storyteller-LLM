'''Lhesper''' was a ruined town on the shore of [[Lake Lhespen]] in the western region of the [[Shaar]].

==History==
Lhesper was founded in the {{YearlinkName|-373}}, by refugees from [[Lapaliiya]] who were fleeing plague. The city remained independent until th {{YearlinkName|297}}, when the army of Qysara [[Shoon V]] marched across the Shaar conquering everything in their path. The city would not regain its independence until the {{YearlinkName|437}}, and again in the {{YearlinkName|451}}.

The town was destroyed by a pack of rampaging [[gnoll]]s in 7th century [[DR]]. Around the [[year of Wild Magic]] [[Yuan-ti]] began to move into the area, searching for some mysterious buried object.

==Activities==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Lhesper was taken over by members from the [[Coiled Cabal]] who were searching for the [[Emeralds of Merrshaulk]].
