'''Belprin's Hold''' was an abandoned keep of [[human]] origin located in [[Eskorn]], [[Laerakond]].

==Inhabitants==
As of [[1479 DR]], Belprin's Hold was home to fearsome monsters that preyed upon the outlaws who sought the keep as a haven, or the treasure-seekers who went to Belprin's Hold in search of its fabled hoards.

==History==
Belprin's Hold was named after a legendary outlaw who led a small band of brigands and stole untold wealth from Eskonar citizens in ages past. Many criminals and treasure-seekers had inhabited the keep over the years, and tales of hidden treasures in Belprin's Hold were common in Eskorn.
