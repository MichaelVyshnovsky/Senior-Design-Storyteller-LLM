Belprins Hold was an abandoned keep of human origin located in Eskorn, Laerakond.
As of 1479 DR, Belprins Hold was home to fearsome monsters that preyed upon the outlaws who sought the keep as a haven, or the treasure-seekers who went to Belprins Hold in search of its fabled hoards.
Belprins Hold was named after a legendary outlaw who led a small band of brigands and stole untold wealth from Eskonar citizens in ages past. Many criminals and treasure-seekers had inhabited the keep over the years, and tales of hidden treasures in Belprins Hold were common in Eskorn.
