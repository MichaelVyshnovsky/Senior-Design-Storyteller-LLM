'''Eveningstar''' was a small unwalled farming town of about fifty buildings in [[Cormyr]].

{{quote|''If ye've seen Eveningstar, ye already know 'tis a place worth fighting for. I've known many of the good folk who tend its shops and farms down the years, And I've seen many a brave souls come in search of adventure...''|[[Elminster]]}}

==Geography==
[[File:Eveningstar 3e.png|thumb|right|250px|''Map of Eveningstar, ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]
It was located roughly {{SI|30|miles|long=yes}} west of [[Arabel]],

Eveningstar was a pastoral village surrounded by fields and orchards situated in an elbow of the Starwater River just north of the [[King's Forest]] (known by locals as the "Shadowood") in Cormyr. It stood at the intersection of the [[High Road]], which ran west to [[High Horn]] and east to Arabel, and the [[Starwater Road]] (known by locals as the "[[Suzail]] Road" or "Southrun"), which ran south to the village of [[Dhedluk]] in the King's Forest. Immediately to the north of Eveningstar was the [[Eveningstar Gorge]],<ref name=VGtC-p142> or the Starwater Gorge. The gorge, formed by the Starwater River as it flowed down from the [[Storm Horn Mountains]], provided relatively easy access to the [[Helmlands]] and the [[Storm Horns]] and was the only significant break in the [[limestone]] [[Stonecliff]] that ran from [[Tyrluk]] to the west to just short of Arabel.

The whole region around the village was known as the "Evening Lands" in bardic tales and sages' histories.

==Economy==
Eveningstar was an agricultural community producing primary products such as [[milk]], eggs, poultry, mutton, [[carrot]]s, beans, and parsnips, as well as value-added goods such as [[cheese]], parchment, wool, and [[wine]]; all of which were sold at a weekly farmers' market. Eveningstar was also a popular stopover for frequent overland caravans, who patronized the local farmers and businesses. The most important business in town was the Lonesome Tankard tavern and inn, famous in Cormyr as one of the best places to eat, drink, and stay the night.

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], Eveningstar, along with [[Espar]], [[Tyrluk]], and [[Waymoot]], was plagued by rogue dragons.

Like most of the settlements in this region, it suffered badly in the [[Goblin War]] of [[1370 DR]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Lonesome Tankard]]
* [[Golden Unicorn]]
* [[Hall of Heroes (Eveningstar)|Hall of Heroes]]
* [[Welcoming Hand]], an inn destroyed during the Goblin War and rebuilt quite quickly after.
* [[House of the Morning]], the large temple to [[Lathander]] that added to the Eveningstar's importance in the region.
