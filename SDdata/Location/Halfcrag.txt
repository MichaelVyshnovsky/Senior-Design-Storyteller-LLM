Halfcrag is a small village located in Tassledale.
The village was crowded. Its buildings were tall and narrow, separated by cramped lanes. The village was so clustered together it appeared as one single massive structure from a distance.
Halfcraggers were a cautious people. They hid their wealth and valuables within underground which were formally guarded  by undead guards to protect their underground vaults. This practice was ended by Kelemvorite priests. The villagers now purchased helmed horrors to act as guards.
The village was located near the Dun Hills. It sat upon a mesa which rose above the surrounding countryside, earning the village its name. 
Halfcrag was the largest agricultural center of the Dales and as such they were home to large herds of cattle and sheep. Its exports included livestock and salted meat stored in barrels. The village was known for a local food, a spicy, greasy sausage that fried well over a campfire.
The market, as well as camp grounds for caravans, were located at the base of the mesa which the village sat upon. Small pavilions provided visitors with a place to sleep overnight but Halfcrag lacked an inn.
The village was defended by a local volunteer cavalry called the Crag Strikers. They defended the village from brigands and goblinkind. They also protected the villages livestock from leucrotta, wolves and other predators from the Dun Hills. Their stables were located in the market area.
The village itself was surrounded by a wall. A tower, home to a ballista, overlooked the market below. The market area itself was surrounded by ramparts made from earth.
