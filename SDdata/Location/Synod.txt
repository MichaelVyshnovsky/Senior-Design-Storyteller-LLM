Synod was a Netherese floating citadel. It was an ecclesiastical enclave ruled by a pious archwizard. The city was home to some of Netherils finest cathedrals.  
Synod was widely believed to have been over the Sea of Fallen Stars when Netheril collapsed and the flying citadels fell from the skies, and thus lost to the depths.
However, storms over the sea had forced Synod to return early and the city was above what was later the Stonelands when Karsuss Folly erupted.
