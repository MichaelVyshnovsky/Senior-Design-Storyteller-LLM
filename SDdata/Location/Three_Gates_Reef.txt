The Three Gates Reef was a large tiger coral reef, bordering and forming part of the ecosystem of the underwater city of Myth Nantar. The citys Dukar Qos notably had some limited ability to manipulate the reef, but mainly used that power to prevent people from digging into certain parts of Myth Nantar.
This reef measured over a  tall and several miles wide. It encircled three sides of Myth Nantar and was named for acting as three arches through which three of the citys major roadways exited the city. Over the centuries various intricately detailed scenes of battles and myths were carved into it.
Following the construction of the Great Barrier, the city allowed the reef to go untended and become more natural. This lack of tending to the Three Gates Reef allowed it to grow out of control over the years, until it covered up much of the southern quarters of Myth Nantar,
