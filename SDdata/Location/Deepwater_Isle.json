        "Description": "Deepwater was the largest in a ring of islands that enclosed and protected [[Deepwater Harbor]]. Part of the heavily fortified [[Deepwater Wall]] ran along the island's ridge.\n\nUnderneath the island were flooded caverns.",
        "Culture": "Every year on [[Ches 30]], the second day of the [[Fair Seas Festival]], [[cleric]]s from all the temples in Waterdeep and members of the city's sea-related [[guilds of Waterdeep|guilds]] traveled to Deepwater Isle and spent the day on it fasting and praying.",
        "Inhabitants": "The island's fortifications were manned by the [[City Navy]] of Waterdeep. The flooded caverns of the island were garrisoned by a rotating force of sixty willing [[merfolk]], sent from southern waters ever since [[-458 DR]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, an influx of mermaid refugees from [[Laakos' Reef]] bolstered the garrison's ranks and transformed it into the village of [[Tharqualnaar]].",
        "Notable Locations": "[[File:Great Harbor.jpg|thumb|273px|''Circa'' [[1372 DR]] map of the western half of Deepwater Isle, with some of its notable locations labeled.]]\n* [[Boatscrape Cove]], a beach on the northern half of the island where ships were cleaned of [[barnacle]]s and other incrustations.\n* [[Deepwater Beach]], a popular site on the southern half of the island for [[mermaid]]s to flirt with members of the City Guard.\n* [[Inner Fort]], the main barracks and command center of the City Navy of Waterdeep on the eastern half of Deepwater Isle.\n* [[Outer Fort]], the other base of the City Navy, located on the western half of Deepwater Isle.\n* '''Tharqualnaar''', a merfolk village inside the undersea caverns of Deepwater Isle."
