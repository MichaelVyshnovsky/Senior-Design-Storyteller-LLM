The '''Grandlore Forest''' was the largest forest on the isle of [[Ilighôn]] off the coast of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
The sprawling Grandlore Forest encompassed the entirety of the island's western half. Two rivers sliced Ilighôn in halves separating the Grandlore from [[Mielikki's Garden]] and the [[Great Forest]] on the island's eastern half. The two rivers were the [[Elder River|Elder]] and the [[Calling River]], both flowing from the [[Elder Spires]] at the island's heart.

The forest's name was a dedication to the Grand Druid of Ilighôn, [[Antonius Mistwind]], also known as "loremaster."

==Notable Locations==
*[[Druidhome]], a quiet community of aging [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Enclave]].
*[[Springbrook Shallows]], a freshwater lake in the center of the Grandlore Forest.
*[[Springbrook]], the river that fed into Springbrook Shallows and started in the Elder Spires.
