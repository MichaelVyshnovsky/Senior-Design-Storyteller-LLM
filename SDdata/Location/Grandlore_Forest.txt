The Grandlore Forest was the largest forest on the isle of Ilighôn off the coast of the Vilhon Reach.
The sprawling Grandlore Forest encompassed the entirety of the islands western half. Two rivers sliced Ilighôn in halves separating the Grandlore from Mielikkis Garden and the Great Forest on the islands eastern half. The two rivers were the Elder and the Calling River, both flowing from the Elder Spires at the islands heart.
The forests name was a dedication to the Grand Druid of Ilighôn, Antonius Mistwind, also known as "loremaster."
