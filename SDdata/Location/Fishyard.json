        "Activities": "Merchants and vendors sold a wide-variety of goods in the Fishyard. Appropriately enough, fresh fish and crustaceans caught in the [[Three Rivers]] were always available, even during the freezing winter months.\n\nA number of folks sold baubles and curio from foreign lands; including jewelry, [[potion]]s and even [[Material component|spellcasting components]], from as far away as [[Calimshan]] or [[Mulhorand]]."
