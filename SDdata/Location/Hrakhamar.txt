Hrakhamar was a dwarven forge-complex built within a volcanic chasm in the land of Chult. While it was abandoned for some time, and attracted new residents, it remained a focal point for the local Chultan dwarves.
The complex was located in the Valley of Lost Honor, south of the Kobold Mountains, on the western side of Chult.
The southward tunnels of Hrakhamar continued 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) away to the Wyrmheart Mine, north of Shilku Bay.
Hrakhmar was used to smelt down and forge iron and adamantine taken from nearby mines.
While the dwarves of Chult originally built Hrakhamar, they were forced to leave their forge when eruptions from the nearby volcanoes became too severe.
Some time later a herd of Imix-worshiping firenewts took up residence and re-activated the forge. They captured and imprisoned what dwarves they found, to learn as much as they could about its workings.
Some local Chultan dwarves watched and bode their time until their numbers were strong enough to rescue their comrades and take back their former home.
