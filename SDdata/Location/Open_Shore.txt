The Open Shore was the northern part of Whitesails Harbor in Luskans North Bank. It was the only place in the city where foreign vessels were allowed to dock as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The Open Shore was so named because it sat outside of the protection of the breakwater and of Harbor Arm Island that protected Whitesails proper from the storms and waves of the Trackless Sea. It also lay outside of Luskans walls and thus outside of its protection, so brigand and even monster attacks were a constant risk.
Fishing boats (such as those operated by Ship Baram) made use of the Open Shore to dock, which attracted sea gulls.
* Dangerous Business, an unassuming ship always moored at the Open Shore but which contained portals to hubs for Dran Enterprises as of the late 15 century DR.
* Fishbone Tavern, a cramped tavern frequented by fishers and laborers.
* Peg and Hook, a shop specializing in prosthetics.
