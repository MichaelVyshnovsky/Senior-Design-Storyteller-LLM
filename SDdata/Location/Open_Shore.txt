The '''Open Shore''' was the northern part of [[Whitesails Harbor]] in [[Luskan]]'s [[Luskan/North Bank|North Bank]]. It was the only place in the city where foreign vessels were allowed to dock as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The Open Shore was so named because it sat outside of the protection of the breakwater and of [[Harbor Arm Island]] that protected Whitesails proper from the storms and waves of the [[Trackless Sea]]. It also lay outside of Luskan's walls and thus outside of its protection, so brigand and even monster attacks were a constant risk.

Fishing boats (such as those operated by [[Ship Baram]]) made use of the Open Shore to dock, which attracted [[sea gull]]s.

==Notable Locations==
* ''[[Dangerous Business]]'', an unassuming ship always moored at the Open Shore but which contained ''[[portal]]s'' to hubs for [[Dran Enterprises]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Fishbone Tavern]], a cramped tavern frequented by fishers and laborers.
* [[Peg and Hook]], a shop specializing in [[prosthetic]]s.
