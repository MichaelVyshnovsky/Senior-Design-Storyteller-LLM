This shrine to the Faer√ªnian deity Finder Wyvernspur was a statue in Ravens Bluff constructed sometime in the late 14 century DR.
This shrine was located in the small outdoor garden of the Tymoran temple complex Hall of Luck, in the Holyhouses neighborhood of the Temple District of Ravens Bluff.
An individual known as Joel the Rebel Bard was said to have constructed this statuary during a visit to the city of Ravens Bluff.
A local Ravenaar bard tended to this shrine, serving as its Shrine Keeper.
