        "mainbody": "Hillfort Keshla was one of the southern fortifications of Amn, part of a chain including Hillfort Ishla and Hillfort Torbold.\nThe forts structures were made of logs sealed with mud batting, and required constant maintenance. In addition to the lodgings for hundreds of troops, Keshla held an armory, blacksmith, stables, and a large garden that supplied food for the garrison.\nKeshla was the easternmost of the three Hillforts on the South Road in the eastern Tejarn Hills. It was the closest Amnian fortification to Riatavin, and the secret Dark Redoubt lay just south of the road halfway to Hillfort Torbold.\nthumb|250px|Keshla was one of three similar hillforts in the Tejarn Hills.\nHillfort Keshla had a more primitive and old-fashioned construction than the newer-built Cloud Peaks citadels. The fort crowned a hill and had an outer palisade and oft-flooded ditch ringing it, with the main structure made of  tall,  thick log walls reinforced with earthworks, as well as some towers and a central keep. During the tenure of Captain Arbas Rosznar, an underofficer devised a means of channelling oil into the ditch, allowing it to be set alight as another defense.\nThe Hillfort was garrisoned by the Council Army on behalf of Amns Council of Six. It was a little larger than its fellows and had a normal complement of 400 soldiers, 35 officers, and the commander. It had enough spare room to host 900 more within its walls in cramped security. Under the despotic yet effective command of Captain Rosznar, the quality of the troops improved from utterly hopeless to somewhat acceptable, though still far below that of nearby Torbold or the Citadels. Under the influence of Rosznar, the troops were generally miserable and spoiling for any outlet for their own frustrations.\nKeshla was built on the site of a long-lost pre-Shoon fortification, similar to the Nine Sentinels. Despite being an important border garrison, the Council refused to release the funds needed to make Keshla more habitable or defensible, and so the garrison were left endlessly maintaining a constantly degrading wood and log structure. This most remote of postings eventually became a punishment posting for troops and officers who were extraordinarily incompetent or politically inconvenient. This negative reputation was so strong that most soldiers refused to enter the fort if at all possible, lest they somehow become trapped there with the rest of the failures.\nIn the , Captain Arbas Rosznar was transferred from Citadel Rashturl to Keshla after accidentally killing a rich womans lover. Rather than being complacent, he used murder, extortion, and other dark acts to gain command of the fort and set about whipping it into shape. Driven by his frustration at the situation, he tyrannised the complement of incompetents into performing their duties properly, and as a result Hillfort Keshla became a perfectly-maintained and efficient fortress, though they hated him for his cruelty.\nCaptain Rosznar aimed to have General Labak Craumerdaun perform an inspection and see his hard work, but it took until 1370 DR to get a response. Craumerdaun agreed to one for Midsummer, and Rosznar drilled his garrison even harder."
