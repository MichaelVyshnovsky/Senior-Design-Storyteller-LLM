        "mainbody": "'''Fluvenilstra''' was an [[Underdark]] city known to few on the surface, an unexpected oasis in the otherwise inhospitable depths of the [[Lowerdark]].",
        "Description": "Fluvenilstra was a [[magic]]al but small city commonly considered the homeland of the [[slyth]] race. It was their largest known settlement, the only known place where more than a few dozen gathered at once.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Fluvenilstra benefitted from water that no longer reached the desert of the surface. It trickled down from cracks in the cave ceiling, collecting in a scummy moat around the edge of Fluvenilstra's circular cavern.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "Fluvenilstra was a jungle of plant life, hosting a motley of [[fungi]] and flowering [[lichen]]s in a wide spectrum of colors and shapes. Large patches of green, lumniescent fungi grew unevenly along the floors and ceilings, providing enough light to most of the city for [[low-light vision]] to be sufficient, while all manner of life grew along the walls, nourished by the water above.\n\nBesides the mundane plants, an assortment of magical plant-life could be found throughout the Garden City. Plants did not merely grow on the walls, Roaming the city and nearby caverns were various plant creatures, including Lowerdark variations of [[shambling mound]]s, [[assassin vine]]s and [[phantom fungi]]."
        },
        "Government": "The governing body of Fluvenilstra was the [[Circle of the Depths]], a [[druid circle]] dedicate to [[Silvanus]]. The Garden City was organized around the Circle, and every citizen acknowledged their authority. The primary authority figure and most powerful [[druid]] of Fluvenilstra was [[Flowrider Plyp Shurlush]], but all circle members were free to commandeer city guards and resources at their discretion, and any three members acting together were licensed to decide all issues of law and justice on the Circle's behalf.\n\nThe circle had a few dozen members, with many of the less powerful druids considered novices under the tutelage of the circle. Small thorps, individual slyth circles, and other distant outposts of their kind elsewhere in the Underdark frequently sent their students there to learn under their calm and watchful supervision. Though most of the druids were slyths, some of them were of other races.",
        "Trade": "On the surface, the druids of Fluvenilstra appeared isolationist, though in truth they maintained contact with and had access to many regions on the surface world and wider Underdark via a system of [[portal]]s. The [[Emerald Enclave]] for example was a frequent contact of theirs, with a handful of students leaving each year to study with the Chosen of Silvanus; other areas within their reach were [[Gulthandor]] and the [[Amtar Forest]]. Citizens of the Garden City sometimes used portals to traverse the surface or explore the Underdark, restoring damaged areas and spreading their nurturing ways and teachings on respect for nature, as was encouraged.\n\nThe economy of Fluvenilstra was greatly enhanced by the use of magic to grow produce. The starchy foodstuffs grown from soil imported from above were luxurious wonders to those in the Underdark, and the biannual selling of that harvest generated much income. As with legal matters, any three members of the Circles of the Depths acting in concert could rule on any matter of trade for the rest of the organization.",
        "Defenses": "The druids of Fluvenilstra preferred to pick their battles, but they did not shy away from conflict when necessary. Rather than its actual standing army however, the first and most impressive line of defense of the Garden City were its plant creatures, which would need to be bypassed simply to enter. While there were many ways into Fluvenilstra, most were sized in mind for slyth amorphous forms, with the primary exception of a larger main entrance at the northern end of its cavern allowing for larger solids.\n\nCovering the main entrance to Fluvenilstra was a {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} thick curtain composed of thousands of hanging [[ironvine]]s, plants with the durability of the titular [[metal]] when interwoven, which they always were. Any death or [[disintegrate|disintegration]] effect would only affect one of them, making them incredibly difficult to destroy. Even if one could remove the curtain however, its lower edges trailed away inside the cavern to form a bridge over the moat, so it would ultimately only make crossing the water harder. Furthermore, about twenty assassin vines and fifty [[shrieker]]s were laced into the outer layer, providing an audible alarm and active defense against outsiders, assuming trespassers could get past the [[roper]]-like plant monsters guarding it.\n\nThe bulk of Fluvenilstra's plant defenses were the various mobile plant monsters that relentlessly attacked all within the Garden City but its residents. led by a sovereign known as [[Meln]] but seemed to do practically nothing save for standing in compost at the city's center humming quietly. In reality, the myconids were the principal defenders of Fluvenilstra, for they controlled its plant creatures through means they refrained from disclosing. Even so, they were happy to use this mysterious power for the benefit of the community.\n\nAside from the plant and fungi creatures, Fluvenilstra was protected by a few hundred soldiers known as the [[Servants of the Flow]]. Sworn to serve as commanded by the Flowrider and the Circle of the Depths, this small army of about 300 was a fairly elite company of [[fighter]]s and [[ranger]]s. Skilled guardians, they made up the Garden City's standing army, and were capable of handling any threat able to elude the plants.",
        "Inhabitants": "Fluvenilstra had a population in the thousands, some of which were courageous souls who sought to serve among the Circle of the Depths, whilst others were tourists seeking to visit the underground jungle. The vast majority of the residency were slyths, with myconids making up the next greatest portion, though even that was an exceedingly small fraction compared to the slyth population.\n\nFollowing closely behind the myconids were [[grimlock]]s, then [[deep gnome]]s and lastly [[genasi]] in terms of numbers.",
        "Notable Locations": "Visitors who approached in peace were not permitted to enter the actual Garden City, instead being removed to a sequestered area just outside. They were asked to remain there for their own safety, as the plants would attack them anywhere else, and those they requested would be brought to them. The default guest liason (appointed for her ability to speak nine [[language]]s including [[Common]] and [[Undercommon]]) was the dragoman of the Flowrider's court, a [[bard]] by the name of [[Lirrup Biltendar]]. The area itself was a {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} diameter, hollowed out portion of cavern wall adorned with cusions, sweet-smelling flowers and vined curtains for those wishing to sleep with privacy and meals served at a community table in the center.\n\nThe Great Garden was located just outside the sequestered area. From here, a slyth druid named [[Durloo Glossop]] grew plants on a light schedule roughly equivalent to the day and night cycles of the surface through the use of ''[[daylight]]'' [[spell]]s.",
        "History": "In [[630 DR]], there existed a group of slyth druids discouraged by the wasteful and wantonly destructive habits of many Underdark denizens. The small group aspired to create a quiet place where they could both study the subtle balance of nature and instruct others on how to nurture it within the Underdark, and for this reason they founded Fluvenilstra. For the first two hundred years the city was essentially just a monastery, but over time the number of students grew with the Garden City's reputation for rare and flowering plants.\n\nCenturies later, in [[1370 DR]], the city was attacked, pillaged, and razed by a lost and starving horde of [[derro]], who later left to find their way back home. From this the rebuilding slyths learned the value of strong defenses, and so contacted a stand of myconids, bred plant creatures, and trained rangers, druids, and fungus [[expert]]s to create a force capable of repelling future invasions. Centuries later, the slyths prospered in their Garden City."
