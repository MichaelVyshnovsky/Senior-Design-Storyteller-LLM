The '''Hills of the Dead Kings''' was a hilly region in central [[Dambrath]]. The hills were connected to the [[Gnollwatch Mountains]]; these extended elevations helped bisect the central portion of the country.

By the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], the hills were renamed by Crinti priestesses of [[Loviatar]] who wished to eradicate all forms of the [[Arkaiun]] culture.

==Geographical Features==
Streams and grassy knolls crisscrossed the Hills of the Dead Kings. They were dotted with occasional patches of [[pine]]s and [[shadowtop]] trees with small streams leading to the knolls leading into the plains.

==Inhabitants==
Many [[halfling]]s, most of whom were [[Strongheart halfling|strongheart]]

==The Tombs==
The hills received their name from the tombs of seven of the kings of the Reinhar dynasty of [[Arkaiun]] kings. The exact locations were supposedly unknown, and the Arkaiun were proud of this fact, but in reality the [[Crinti]] looted all but two of the tombs. They never let this information come out for fear of a nationalist uprising of the people they referred to as ''Shebali''.

The tomb of [[Reinhar I]] was empty as the king had died in battle in [[Halruaa]]. In centuries past, [[Malar]] commanded the Arkaiun to build the tomb as a monument in his honor. It was guarded with two [[magic]]al constructs; a [[stone lion]] and [[iron tiger]].
