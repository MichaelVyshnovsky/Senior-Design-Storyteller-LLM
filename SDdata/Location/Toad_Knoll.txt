Toad Knoll was a hill in the Dalelands just north of the North Ride.
Toad Knoll was located less than  west of Shadowdales bridge that crossed over the River Ashaba.
The hill took its name from the bumper crop of frogs and toads that occurred in the spring months, living and breeding in the marshy ground at the base, caused by the upwelling of an intermittent natural spring..
