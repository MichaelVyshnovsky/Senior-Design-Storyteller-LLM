'''Toad Knoll''' was a hill in the [[Dalelands]] just north of the [[North Ride]].

==Geography==
Toad Knoll was located less than {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} west of [[Shadowdale]]'s bridge that crossed over the [[River Ashaba]].
===Flora & Fauna===
The hill took its name from the bumper crop of [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s that occurred in the spring months, living and breeding in the marshy ground at the base, caused by the upwelling of an intermittent natural spring..
