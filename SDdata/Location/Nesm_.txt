'''Nesmé''' ({{Pronounce|NEZ|may|refs=}}) was a small frontier city located in the [[Savage Frontier]] of [[northwest Faerûn]].{{Cite web/The City of Nesmé}}{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|19}}

==Geography==
Nesmé sat beside the [[River Subrin]]. The dangerous [[Lurkwood]] forest rested in the north. To the north and west were plains and hills inhabited by many [[Uthgardt]] barbarian tribes. The [[Evermoors]] lay to the southeast.

===Travel and Trade Routes===
[[File:Demon concept Stone path to Nesme.jpg|thumb|500x500px|''A road leading into Nesmé.'']]
* [[Silverymoon]] to Nesmé: {{SI|165|mile|k|long=yes}} by [[barge]]<ref>
* [[Zundbridge]] to Nesmé: 30 days by barge<ref>

==Population==
The city normally had a population of approximately 6,000 people, but this could rise by up to 50% during high trade season. However, following the raids by trolls, frost giants, and barbarians, the population plummeted by more than one-fifth, to under 2,000 people by the end of 1372 DR.

In late [[1484 DR]], after the city was taken by the forces of Many-Arrows, only 600 of the original population remained, all as prisoners.

==Defenses==
The [[Riders of Nesmé]] were an effective military force that defended Nesmé against its enemies. With peace rare, the Riders swiftly became experienced veterans.{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|17}}

Nesmé's leaders encouraged [[adventurer]]s to come and stay in their city and fight off the trolls and giants, provided they behaved themselves. Those who were not were escorted out by the Riders. As a result, Nesmé was a great base for adventurers looking for action.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Nesmé had the finest stone wall between [[Silverymoon]] and [[Mirabar]]. Arrow slits allowed it to be defended at any location and several catapults were kept ready behind it.

When [[Luruar]] began to face the burgeoning threat of Many-Arrows, Nesmé had to fend for itself against the giant raids that had not subsided since its fall. [[Tessarin Alaurun]] spent much of her treasury in [[1372 DR]] to retain the services of [[Sky Pony Tribe|Sky Pony]] [[Uthgardt]] mercenaries and the [[Khoroshen]] tribe of [[lizardfolk]] in order to supplement the Riders of Nesmé.

By [[1484 DR]], the wall had grown to be about the size of two [[ogre]]s stacked on top of each other. It was {{SI|15|feet|long=yes}} from the battlement to the ground.

==Economy==
Nesmé's economy was based mostly around trade, and focused on investing in defense of the city and its people.

Nesmé was known for its exceptional steel.{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|18}}

==Government==
The city was ruled by a [[First Speaker]] and dominated by its merchants.

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the First Speaker was [[Jygil Zelnathra]], who was also the local High Priestess of Waukeen. Under Jygil, Nesmé was a theocracy and its ruling council was mostly made up of [[Church of Waukeen|Waukeenar]] clergy.

The following year, during the [[Godswar]], Waukeen was apparently dead and Nesmé's temple dissolved. [[Tessarin Alaurun]], a staunch opponent of the theocracy, called for and then organized an election wherein the large population of adventurers living in the town at the time led the voting. They elected a council that was more focused on the town's defense than its wealth and Tessarin became First Speaker.

With money saved by the previous council and the accumulated wealth of the adventuring electorate, a wall was built and the Riders of Nesmé received more funding. Jygil was still on the council but in a much more minor role, frequently having to add her political clout to her old rival's in the face of adversity, which eventually led to a respectful political partnership and Tessarin taking on Jygil as her [[wizard]] apprentice.

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the First Speaker was still Tessarin Alaurun. With Waukeen's return in [[1370 DR]], Jygil Zelnartha was again High Priestess of the local church of Waukeen. Though both the merchants and the church focused heavily on Nesmé's welfare and both focused on wealth, they often stood in opposition. However, their disputes were kept to a minimum when Nesmé suffered from external threats.

''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], [[Eregund Walen]] commanded the Riders of Nesmé, followed by [[Galen Firth]].<ref>

==History==
===Early History===
In the {{YearlinkName|1269}}, a [[half-orc]] bandit named [[Thaurog]] built [[Thaurog's Keep]] on the site where Nesmé would later lie. Control later fell into the hands of his son, [[Throgh]]. However, in the [[1294 DR|Year of the Deep Moon, 1294 DR]], he was killed by [[human]] adventurers from [[Waterdeep]], who were then attacked by [[wyvern]]s. The wyverns made their lair in Thaurog's Keep.

===14{{th}} Century DR===
Later, in the {{YearlinkName|1307}}, [[Algraetha the Enchantress]] got rid of all the wyverns and rebuilt the settlement around the old keep, and it became known as Nesmé.

In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the town came under the first of several attacks from the [[Uthgardt]] [[Griffon Tribe]]. Rumors at the time claimed that Nesmé had surrendered to the barbarians and that Tessarin Alaraun led the city along with the tribe's leader, [[Kralgar Bonesnapper]], after forcing First Speaker Jygil Zelnathra into exile. In reality, after repelling the attacks, the weakened town council, suffering the loss of their goddess, had been ousted in an election, which ended with Zelnathra being demoted and Alaraun taking her place. That year, Nesmé contributed troops to the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]], aiding the [[dwarves]] of [[Mithral Hall]] against the [[drow]] of [[Menzoberranzan]].

Nesmé suffered a dramatic increase in attacks by orcs and trolls in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. The city hired adventurers to investigate the cause and, the [[1369 DR|following year]], a group learned that [[fog giant|fog]] and [[cloud giant]]s had settled in the Evermoors, driving the trolls out of the moors. The conflict reached a climax in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, as an army of trolls invaded and ruined Nesmé. They were forced out by an army of [[dwarf|dwarves]] from [[Mithral Hall]] and [[Mirabar]].

After this, however, the other cities of the [[Silver Marches]] redeployed their armies in the north to guard the border of the newly established [[Many-Arrows|Kingdom of Many-Arrows]], leaving Nesmé to look after itself. Still fighting off giant raids and fearing a resurgence of the trolls, First Speaker Tessarin Alaurun found the coin to pay the Riders of Nesmé and hire a small band of mercenary [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s.

With the expenditure of considerable time and resources, [[Alustriel]] and [[Silverymoon]] decided to have Nesmé rebuilt into a town of both larger and grander proportions. First, the remnants of the Riders and a large detachment of [[Knights in Silver]] drove the trolls deep into the [[Trollmoors]], making the surrounding roads the safest they'd been since 1358 DR. Then, refugees displaced from homes lost to the orcs were encouraged to go to Nesmé to aid in the reconstruction. This had the effect of increasing Nesmé's population to around twice that of what it was before the siege. These people spent the entire winter of [[1371 DR]] to [[1372 DR]] building new structures that greatly outshone the old ones in both durability and size and erecting a double wall that surrounded the place, especially fortified and manned on the border of the Evermoors. Contingents of Riders and Knights patrolled the streets regularly and the town was never been finer, a startling difference to those who knew the place either before or during the troll siege.<ref>

===15{{th}} Century DR===
In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, the city's First Speaker was [[Jolen Firth]]. Nesmé was one of the first cities to fall under siege by the orcs of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]] (spurred on by the [[drow]] [[matron mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]] through the restored [[House Do'Urden]]). The [[Companions of the Hall]], including [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Athrogate]], spent several weeks defending the city, but left in an attempt to aid other regions. Soon after their departure, the city was beset by orcs and the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]]. The city fell; the 600 survivors, including First Speaker Jolen Firth and Rider of Nesmé [[Giselle Malcomb]], were taken prisoner. The drow [[Tiago Baenre|Tiago]] and [[Saribel Xorlarrin|Saribel Baenre]] were declared "Duke and Duchess of Nesmé." Eventually, however, the drow were forced to abandon the city.

By the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the city had fallen to ruin, with monsters from the Evermoors thwarting efforts to rebuild it. Some time after the city's abandonment, the ruins were used as a meeting place between [[Zhentarim]] mercenaries and [[Gundahella]], a [[fire giant]] representing Duke [[Zalto]].
