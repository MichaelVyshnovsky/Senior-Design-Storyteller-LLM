        "mainbody": "Coramshan was a predecessor state of Calimshan.\nAfter the time known as First Era of Skyfire, which ended in Calim and Memnon bodies being bound in Calimemnon Crystal by elven High Mage Pharos, the area was still dangerous, as there were still many genies and efreeties that were not imprisoned along their leaders.\nBy  the last of the genies were driven out of the areas previously known as Calim Empire and Memnonnar (country) by humans and dwarves, and the human nation of Coramshan was founded by Coram the Warrior, combining the remains of the two fallen empires. Calimport was also built around this time.  Coramshan underwent many expansions and contractions over the next four-thousand years. Dynastic strife and various other ills ultimately cost Coramshan much of the territory, but it consistently maintained its power by trading goods between predominant powers to the north and south. Coramshan also saw the rise of the bakkals, priest-kings who worshiped the powers of evil, which greatly soured relations with Shanatar.\nAfter the rise of Jhaamdath around , Coramshan began a struggle with this burgeoning psionic empire over the Lake of Steam. This was settled in  when they signed a truce limiting Coramshans expansion in that area. Coramshan was also renamed Calimshan around this time when the realm joined with the nation of Mir. Disease was a problem in the early years of Calimshan and many blamed Jhaamdath for spreading it."
