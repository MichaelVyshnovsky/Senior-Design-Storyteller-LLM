The '''Aerilpar Mound''', also known as the '''Mound of the Sleepless''', was a mysterious mound in the center of the [[Aerilpar Forest]] in the [[Shining South]].

It was a location that radiated [[magic]]. The origins of its magical energy were unknown but no trees grew within the encircling walls and all the predatory animals of the forest kept away.
