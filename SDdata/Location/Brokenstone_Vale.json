        },
        "History": "Centuries prior to the [[Spellplague]], a [[werewolf]] lord forged a kingdom of [[lycanthrope]]s in this valley and waged a fierce, brutal war with the neighboring [[star elf|eladrin]] realms, this area of the Feywild was conceded to [[lycanthrope]]s and [[shapechanger]]s in an ancient pact with a parliament of [[archfey]] known as the [[Court of Stars (Feywild)|Court of Stars]]. Their pact ensured that no creature could set foot in this valley without the permission of the resident lycanthropes and entering without made their life forfeit. Conversely, their pact made it so that any lycanthrope that hunted beyond the valley would be hunted by an archfey known as the [[Maiden of the Moon]].\n\nAs the centuries passed many werebeast rulers would raise keeps or halls within castles or towers, which would go on to become ruins that littered the valley.\n\nOver time the lycanthropes of the valley felt chafed by their ancient pact and began to hunt far beyond the valley. And some in the Feywild would be inspired by the Maiden of the Moon to take up arms, hunting down such lycanthropes Some lycanthropes swore fealty to [[Bronnor]], the king of Harrowhame, plotting to one day ambush the Maiden of the Moon and put an end to her. While others had a loose alliance with the fomorian queen [[Connomae]].\n\nFollowing the Spellplague, some of the lycanthropes that had formed an alliance with Connomae made their way to the island of [[Moray]] on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] and became members of the [[Black Blood tribe]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|3,9}}",
        "Notable Locations": "* Along the river boundaries of this valley were tiny hamlets, clusters of ragged huts, where civilized lycanthropes lived and did trade with outside merchants. Bringing supplies and trading with them rare woods. These hamlets were overseen by a werewolf lord name [[Viktor Mazan]], who maintained the brutal peace necessary for them to exist. He did not allow travelers to remain long and tried to send them off as quickly as possible.\n* The mountainsides of this valley were riddled with decrepit mines that [[wererat]]s laired in.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Brokenstone Fight Sequence.jpg|thumb|273px|''An [[star elf|eladrin]] in Brokenstone commands a bewitched [[werewolf]] to protect her against another.'']]\nThis valley was primarily inhabited by lycanthropes. Some gathered within clans or tribes, Most of the lycanthropes in this valley rarely bothered to disguise their true nature. Some lived within the ruined structures built for werebeast lords of yore.\n\nOccasionally outsiders came to the valley to live as hermits. Non-lycanthropes lived high in its mountain, hunting in the woods by day and farming the lower mountain slopes. They would paint a silver stripe across their home to signal that they have [[silver]] and the protection of the Maiden of the Moon. Some would also display wolfsbane around their home as a deterrent.\n\nSome lycanthropes within the valley acted as assassins or spies of Harrowhame's king."
