It also harbored the ruins of the ancient empires of [[Nar]], [[Raumathar]], and [[Imaskar]] once built in and around the region of the Dust Desert. The most mysterious and greatest hidden realm in the Earthroot was the realm of [[Deep Imaskar]] itself. It lay below the [[Hordelands|Endless Wastes]] in the most eastern part of the Earthroot."
