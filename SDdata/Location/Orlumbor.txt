'''Orlumbor''' ({{Pronounce|or|LUM|bore|refs=}}) was a small rocky barren island city-state in the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Description==
Orlumbor's mainland-facing natural harbor was the main populated area of the island. It was built by being cut into the island's rocks in a similar fashion to the homes of its many shipwrights. The settlement's buildings were cave-like structures and complexes connected by a complex chain of tunnels and stair flights. The docks and harbors of Orlumbor seemingly were always filled with workers.

==Geography==
The settlement was located due west of the [[Trollbark Forest]] between [[Daggerford]] and [[Baldur's Gate]] and 300 miles south of the free city of Waterdeep, on the [[Sword Coast]]. Few people visited the city, in part because of its treacherous harbor.

Despite its size, the island nation was independent and influential, in part due to its skilled, in-demand shipwrights who specialized in salt-water vessels..

==Trade==
Orlumbor was an unassuming island inhabited by [[goat]]-herders, [[fish]]ers, and some of the most renowned and skilled shipwrights in all [[Faerûn]]. The island produced some of the best quality ocean-faring ships in all [[Northwest Faerûn]], found in many places across the region. Many oceanic vessels of the north originated on Orlumbor, and most had been repaired on the island at least once. These ships were known for their sturdy hulls, and construction timeframes varied by the ordered ship's size. Small merchant vessels took two months to complete, large trade ships – six months, and a fearsome warship took four months or more to construct.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

Orlumbor was closely allied with the city of Baldur's Gate, owing it much. It also retained its independence thanks to Waterdeep's patronage and protection.

==History==
Long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Orlumbor was a wooded island, but it had been all logged by the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. Throughout the years, Orlumbor engaged in conflicts with another island nation – [[Mintarn]], before the Tyrant took hold. Orlumbor survived these conflicts through Waterdeep's aid.

The {{YearlinkName|310}} was a tragic year. Orlumbor was home to a [[hin]] settlement called [[Marrduin]], and in 310 DR, a creature from the [[Lower planes]], a six-legged monstrosity named [[Gorathil]], decimated the halflings.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1282}}, the skies over Orlumbor exploded in fireworks of a magical battle between the [[black dragon]] named [[Starlaurynguldar]] and a [[Magister]] of [[Mystra]], [[Ohland Grethgar]]. The long and spectacular battle resulted in the mutual destruction of both parties.

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Orlumbor was besieged in a surprise naval attack by ships that flew the flags of Waterdeep. The island's leader at the time – [[Tulgar Wrighttson]], believed that the island fell to a treacherous betrayal by a trusted ally, but with the help of the [[Heroes of Ascore]], it was revealed that the Waterdhavian ships were, in reality, conniving pirates.

At one point, closer to the 14{{th}} century, Orlumbor had conflicts with Baldur's Gate and the nation of Amn, but by the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Baldur's Gate became a close ally to Orlumbor.
