        "mainbody": "odurt was a town in Vaasa that was primarily inhabited by goblins and their kin. It was known for also having an unusually large number of barghests in the populace.\nThe town was located on the western shore of the Bottomless Bogs, and was relatively inaccessible by conventional travel methods.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Modurt had avoided attention from the Warlock Knights in Telos City, who paid scant attention to the mostly unpopulated western territories."
