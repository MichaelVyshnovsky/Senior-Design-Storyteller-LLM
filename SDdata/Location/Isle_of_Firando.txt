The '''Isle of Firando''' was one of the [[Outer Isles]] in the [[Celestial Sea]] southwest of [[Wa]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. It was said to be inhabited by primitive [[human]] tribes.

It was a hilly island. Curiously, the weather over Firando was seemed to be set by the moods of its inhabitants. When they were happy, the winds were fresh and the sky was sunny. But if they were angry, the sky turned bleak and stormy.

By [[1355 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]], Firando was the site of a big temple to the fertility god [[Priapus]].

It was under the jurisdiction of one of Wa's provinces, the nearest to it on the mainland.
