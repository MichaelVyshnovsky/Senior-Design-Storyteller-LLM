The city was supported by [[Cormyr]] and a significant amount of trade from that country flowed through its port.  Urmlaspyr was blanketed by a layer of dark [[magical]] clouds conjured by a [[Netheril|Netherese]] arch [[mage]] that was impossible to dispel. It was known for having some of the best glassblowers in Faerun.",
        "Military": "[[Cormyr]] loaned the city a company of [[Purple Dragons|Purple Dragon knights]] to aid in its defense.",
        "History": "Urmlaspyr was formerly known as the city of temples.  When the shadovar outlawed the worship of any [[deity]] other than [[Shar]] the people of Urmlaspyr resisted and the city was nearly razed and many of the citizens enslaved.  The city threw out the shadovar after the [[Spellplague]] and was an independent city in [[1479 DR]]."
