        "Location": "The enclave moved about at the whims of Karsus, but in general he chose to spend his summers over the [[High Forest]] and winters over the [[Far Horns]] forest. The nearby [[Winding Water]] became known as the \"Karsus Overwash\" for a time, as the ground-borne locals considered Karsus and his city to be a perpetual annoyance and menace, and so named the river after the subject of their ire. Karsus himself remained ignorant of these opinions, as everyone aware was wise enough to not mention it.",
        "Government": "{{main|Laws of Karsus Enclave}}\nWhile Karsus was the ultimate authority in his enclave, he didn't care for day-to-day governance and divested much of the responsibility to those that were willing to put the work in. The [[arcanist]] [[Andoris Derathar]] was effectively in charge of the city's legal system, with his apprentices taking roles as mediators and judges as justice was dispensed. In especially serious cases such as murder and espionage, Andoris would personally intervene to arbitrate the matter. Generally, property damage and personal harm was met with fines or forced labor, while crimes targeting arcanists or the city itself were met with various harsh and unusual executions.",
        "History": "[[File:Enclave miniature.png|thumb|''A view of the enclave.'']]\nKarsus established his enclave in {{yearlinkConvert|3185|NY}}, when he was only 22 years old. It was formally named Radman at the request of his mother, in honor of his [[Radman|father]], though in time it became known as Eileanar, or simply called Karsus Enclave due to his fame and power. Knowing that his new enclave had little to distinguish it from the competition, Karsus decided that the best way to lure in residents and servants would be to create a wonderous city that they would be attracted to. He hired the finest engineers and architects from all over Netheril, and they created as fantastical and wondrous a city as could be managed. They combined their efforts with magical artifice, and over a decade of construction they built a city without compare.\n\nThe last of the Netherese-controlled ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' were stolen en route to the enclave in {{yearlinkConvert|3195|NY}}, forever denying their use by the arcanists.\n\nKarsus developed [[heavy magic]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3451|NY}}, and in his first great experiment he enchanted a 41 cubic foot blob of it with ''[[Volhm's drain]]''. The magically active mass began cycling all available magical energy both from and back into the city's ''[[mythallar]]'', leaving the entire enclave inert, including its means of flight. As the city began to plummet to the ground, Karsus threw together a ''[[levitation]]'' and ''[[Tolodine's gust of wind]]'' and used them to blow the magical mass off of the side of the enclave and into the distance. By sheer chance, the arcanist [[Wulgreth (Netheril)|Wulgreth]] was struck by the still-''draining'' heavy magic mass, which drained his life energies and transformed him into a [[lich]].\n\n[[File:Karsus.png|thumb|300px|''The enclave did not survive its master.'']]\nThe [[Terraseer]] made a brief and final appearance in {{yearlinkConvert|3514|NY}}, when he warned that [[Mystryl]] would soon face her greatest challenge. The end of Eileanar and Netheril as a whole came in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}, when [[Ioulaum]] disappeared without warning or explanation. As panic and unrest spread, Karsus finished his ''[[Karsus's avatar|avatar]]'' spell, hoping to use it to save Netheril and destroy the [[phaerimm]]s. He positioned the enclave near a plateau in the High Forest and cast his legendary spell, only to have it destroy him and all he loved. Karsus's enclave crashed nearby and was destroyed, with no survivors.\n\nThe city of [[Karse]] was built nearby in {{yearlinkConvert|3563|NY}} by the [[Cult of Karsus]], those drawn by the legend of Karsus and his [[karsestone|divine remains]]. The city fell to ruin in {{yearlinkConvert|3575|NY}} after a civil war was instigated by the vengeful lich Wulgreth, who sought simply to destroy all of Karsus's legacy.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Academia": "The enclave was home to a great many magical schools and other institutions, drawn together by the reputation of Karsus and his grand plans. Several academies existed that catered to the general population and taught basic [[cantra]]s, and sent on those with particular aptitudes to study at the specialized academies.\n\n* [[Academy of Mentalist Study]], a prestigious magic college of [[mentalist]] [[enchantment]] and [[divination]] magic.\n* [[Alchemical Seminary]], a school of [[variator]] studies, [[alchemy]] and [[transmutation]].\n* [[The Ancient Scrolls]], a group of historical scholars.\n* [[Diviner's University]], a prominent school.\n* [[Institute for Sorcerous Imagery]], a school of [[mentalist]] enchantment and [[illusion]] magics.\n* [[Inventor's Conservatory]], a college of [[inventive]] spells and studies.\n* [[Ioulaum Industries]], a center of research and development for ''mythallars''.\n* [[Library of Netheril]], a large and comprehensive library.\n* [[Mardon's Mountaineering]], a school that taught mountaineering skills.\n* [[Museum of Heavy Magic]], a unique museum that used [[heavy magic]] illusions.\n* [[Scribe's School]], a major school for arcanists.\n* [[Shadow Consortium]], a center of [[planes|planar]] studies.\n* [[University of Definitive Archwizardry]], a school of inventive, mentalist, and variator studies.\n* [[Variator's Intelligentsia]], a college that specialized in variation spellcasting and item creation.",
            "Government & Guilds": "[[File:Karsus Enclave Constabulary.png|thumb|280px|''The constables of the enclave.'']]\n* [[Constabulary Branch One]], [[Constabulary Branch Two|Two]], and [[Constabulary Branch Three|Three]], the enclave's law enforcement strongholds.\n* The [[Grocer Cartel]], a guild that controlled the trade of food.\n* [[Karsus Castle]], the fantastical palace of Karsus himself.\n* The [[League of Noted Singers and Performers]], a guild of performers and artists.\n* The [[Miners' League]], a guild of miners and metal processors.\n* The [[Mythallar Housing]], the fortified structure that held the enclave's two ''mythallars''.\n* The [[Netheril Mint]], one of three mints in all of Netheril.\n* The [[Hall of Judgment]], the court of justice.",
            "Services": "The wealthy patrons of the city attracted experts in many fields, who supplied their skills in astrology, engineering, art, music, linguistics, and other educated trades. More hands-on professions also found good work in the city, including trackers, scribes, teamsters, launderers, and messengers.\n\n* Visitors to the city could hire from a variety of reputable tour guides, including [[Arborius]], [[Blanc]], [[Cerelias]], [[Etranger]], [[Gellibrand]], [[Hommel]], [[Karyn]], [[Kerckherdere]], [[Ventimiglia]], and [[Wyntoun]].\n* [[Currency]] conversion was available from trustworthy moneychangers for a 6–15% fee, including [[Aspar]], [[Ceneus]], [[Diophant]], [[Ferdinand]], and [[Terenzio]].\n* Healers for hire included the [[priest]]s [[Aratus]], [[Chabrond]], [[Colonna]], [[Cratippus]], [[Gallupi]], [[Hufeland]], [[Kimiko]], and [[Vinckelbooms]].\n* Animal trainers who owned their own businesses included the skilled [[Bayard]], [[Devonshire]], [[Gaussen]], and [[Peterneefs]].\n* The [[Coddled Cuticle]], a hairdresser and manicure salon.\n* [[Enclave Architectural]], an architectural design and execution company.\n* [[Gallery Steamers]], a shipwright for [[flying vessel]]s.\n* [[Mythomian Warehouse]], a magically chilled warehouse home to the [[Neth Underground for Freedom Fighters]].\n* [[Transgate Industries]], a ''[[portal]]'' research and creation company.",
            "Shops": "Although many magical items were produced and sold in the enclave, they were surprisingly sparse in the open market and expensive to buy. Normal [[magical item]]s were about ten times as expensive as they would in later ages, while [[quasimagical item]]s were five times as expensive. The arcanists of Netheril tended to hoard and control the supply of magic, so even in the heavily magical realm it was hard to obtain those items.\n\nAll sorts of trades were drawn to the enclave due to its prestige and wealth, giving the city a wide array of masters for hire, in addition to those that supplied the common folk. Karsus was home to cobblers, [[glass]]blowers, [[paper]] makers, [[potter]]s, and smiths of all sorts who supported the economy. Like the magical trades, they were heavily competed for and so could demand higher prices than elsewhere.\n\n* Reputed herbalists who owned their own businesses included [[Alexejev]], [[Bartolommeo]], [[Berenice]], [[Giraldus]], [[Goudcheaux]], [[Parr]], and [[Shute]].\n* [[Benante's Butchery]], a fine butcher shop.\n* [[Chanragoupta's Exotic]], an importer of clothing and fabrics.\n* [[Dundaden's Armory]], the best armorer in Karsus.\n* [[Elemental Store]], a chemical supply shop.\n* [[House Implement Wholesalers]], a maker and seller of common quasimagical item items.\n* [[Karmandon's Finery]], a clothing and jewelry shop.\n* [[Laclos's Cremes and Candies]], a [[chocolate]] maker and seller.\n* [[Pomart's Fishery]], a wide-reaching fishery.\n* [[QM III]], a magical and quasimagical item seller.\n* [[Rualadeen Arms]], an exceptional weaponsmith.\n* [[Yousouf's Grocery]], a grocery shop."
