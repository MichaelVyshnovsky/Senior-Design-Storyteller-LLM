The '''Corsair Domains''' consisted of a number of small islands in the [[Great Sea]] [[Northwest Zakhara|off the northern coast]] of [[Zakhara]]. They were the holdouts of the [[pirate]]s in this region, and the different areas, villages, and hiding-places in the Corsair Domains were ruled by whichever brigand or former captain could grab power. The only real city here, [[Hawa]], was no exception.

Despite this anarchic bent, most inhabitants claimed overall loyalty to the [[Grand Caliph]] and the [[Law of the Loregiver]]. In contrast to most of [[Zakhara]], [[slavery]] was despised by the [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]], possibly in part because the [[mamluk]]s of [[Qudra]] were their greatest enemies.

Unlike the [[Nelanther]] in the [[Trackless Sea]] near [[Amn]]<ref> and the [[Pirate Isles]] of old in the [[Inner Sea]],<ref> piracy was not the main activity, though it was an important one. Much of the corsairs' plundering was directed toward the north, considered barbaric by Zakharans in general. Ship-building, smuggling, adventuring, and trade were other important ways of income.
