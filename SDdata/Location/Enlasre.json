        "mainbody": "Enlasre was a village in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.\nIt lay on the Kuong Kingdoms trade road from the south, which from here ran north to Javuhansa on the headwaters of the Kunong River.\nThe village was unremarkable and no more than a stopover for travelers. Enlasres mineral waters and hot springs were its main attraction.\nIt was said that a goddess created another set of springs somewhere in the jungles near Enlasre, which granted divine powers for a brief period. However, the site of the spring was long lost by the midâ€“14 century DR, and explorers hunted for them without success."
