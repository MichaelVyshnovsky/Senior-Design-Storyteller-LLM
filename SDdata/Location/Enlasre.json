        "Activities": "The village was unremarkable and no more than a stopover for travelers. Enlasre's mineral waters and hot springs were its main attraction.",
        "Legends": "It was said that a [[goddess]] created another set of springs somewhere in the jungles near Enlasre, which granted divine powers for a brief period. However, the site of the spring was long lost by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], and explorers hunted for them without success."
