        "mainbody": "Djerad Kethendi (the Fortress of Gems in Draconic) was a Tymantheran port city in the Alamber Sea. \nDjerad Kethendi was composed of three white pyramids constructed on the southern shore of the Alamber Seas estuary.\nThe dragonborn constructed Djerad Kethendi to the south of the ruins of Unthalass. \nAfter the Second Sundering, on Nightal 26 of 1486 DR,  Djerad Kethendi was one of the two tymantheran big settlements that remained on Toril, alongside Djerad Thymar. Soon after, the Untherite forces led by Gilgeam tried to conquer Djerad Kethendi in an attempt to recover the ruins of Unthalass, and laid siege to the city, starting the First Tymanther-Unther War. The siege was broken when Nanna-Sin was resurrected by Asmodeus, and taking the form of a dragon turtle destroyed the Untherite navy. As of 1489 DR, the dragon turtle was still protecting Djerad Kethendi against Untherite attacks."
