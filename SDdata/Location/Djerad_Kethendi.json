        "mainbody": "'''Djerad Kethendi''' (the ''Fortress of Gems'' in [[Draconic language|Draconic]]) was a [[Tymanther]]an port city in the [[Alamber Sea]].",
        "Description": "Djerad Kethendi was composed of three white pyramids constructed on the southern shore of the Alamber Sea's estuary.",
        "History": "The dragonborn constructed Djerad Kethendi to the south of the ruins of [[Unthalass]]. \n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], on [[Nightal 26]] of [[1486 DR]],  Djerad Kethendi was one of the two tymantheran big settlements that remained on [[Toril]], alongside [[Djerad Thymar]]. Soon after, the [[Unther|Untherite]] forces led by [[Gilgeam]] tried to conquer Djerad Kethendi in an attempt to recover the ruins of Unthalass, and laid siege to the city, starting the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]]. The siege was broken when [[Nanna-Sin]] was resurrected by [[Asmodeus]], and taking the form of a [[dragon turtle]] destroyed the Untherite navy. As of [[1489 DR]], the dragon turtle was still protecting Djerad Kethendi against Untherite attacks."
