        "mainbody": "Wheloon (), sometimes nicknamed the Jade Towers, was a town and later small city in the kingdom of Cormyr in interior Faerûn. It lay at the junction of the Wyvernflow River and the Way of the Manticore and at the end of the Hullack Trail in southeastern Cormyr.\nPeople and things from here were called \"Whelunian\".\nPredating Wheloon and the ferry was the Gods Grove, a shrine to Silvanus and duskwood grove to the east.\nOriginally a small thorp that lived off the trade of river crossings on the Wyvern Ferry Route, Wheloon slowly developed as trade along the Way of the Manticore increased and more ships starting using the Wyvernflow. It grew into a town based around the ferry. The Harvest Hall temple of Chauntea was built around this time.\nAlthough Wheloon sat at the crossing of two of Cormyrs most important travel routes, it usually played only a minor role in Cormyrean history prior to 1374 DR.\nIn the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR, King Galaghard IIIs army, the Glory of Cormyr, fought a battle against the Witch Lords and their undead forces at the fords of Wheloon, overrunning them but unable to achieve a final victory. They eventually drove them to the Vast Swamp and defeated them there. This was the last historical event significant to Cormyr to occur in Wheloon until 1374 DR.\nWheloon was one of a number of places captured by the Lost King Gondegal in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR. Like the others, his mercenary troops occupied and pillaged the town before being ousted by the Purple Dragons as Gondegals eight-day kingdom fell.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, in early Eleint of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, Cyric and some of his Zhentilar force visited Wheloon as they passed through Cormyr. Cyric left at least one of his agents there to interfere with Kelemvor Lyonsbane, Midnight, and Adon. Shortly after they arrived, Kelemvor was framed for the robbery and murder of a local merchant, with Cyrics agent testifying to Lord Redbeard that they had seen him leave the house with a bloody sword. When the Wheloon Watch tried to apprehend Kelemvor, the group fled on stolen horses, pursued by the Watch and the Purple Dragons, and made a successful getaway.\nDuring the Goblin War, the neighboring city of Arabel was evacuated in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. The refugees poured into Wheloon, rapidly increasing the population. They settled and built up the east bank, expanding Wheloon from a town to a small city in a few years.\nBy 1374 DR, an aging Lord Sarp Redbeard, once considered headstrong and almost independent of the crown, had proven his loyalty though a combination of trade deals and military actions. However, his main focus was still on the good of Wheloon.\nthumb|250px|right|The temple of Mystra was meant to be good for Wheloon...\nThe priestess Naedaenya Arthas met with Sarp Redbeard around Ches of 1374 DR to request the construction of a temple of Mystra in Wheloon. She persuaded him that it would open a market for magical items, spell components, and lore, and boost the citys economy. She also paid hefty bribes to Redbeard. He approved construction, and granted the priests tax breaks. He told Whelunians it would bring more people and trade and make Wheloon important. The temple was sited on the crumbling foundations of the ruined citadel that lay on the northern edge of town. Using magically assisted construction techniques, it took only months to build, and was nearly completed in Eleint that year. It was Cormyrs only temple to Mystra, but many Whelunians had little need to worship the goddess of magic, and it became only a local curiosity. Then, on Eleint 6, an itinerant cleric of Mystra, Tunaster Dranik, and a group of adventurers in the service of Mystra discovered the temple to be a front for Sharran cultists to kidnap magically gifted citizens and travelers in a plot to tear a rift in the Weave. Wheloons Purple Dragons investigated the matter and Constal Maximanus Tholl brought the adventurers to an audience with Redbeard, who requested they continue their investigations and follow the cultists into the Vast Swamp. Redbeard, Tholl, and the Purple Dragons remained in Wheloon to guard the city and the temple. After pursuing the cult, the adventurers foiled the plot and returned on Eleint 13, and helped open up trade agreements between Cormyr and the Sharptooth tribe of lizardfolk in the Vast Swamp.\nAfter the Spellplague in the , King Foril decreed that Wheloon be transformed into a prison city, sentencing all those inside to be prisoners for life, sealed in by physical and magical barriers. The decision was made following unprecedented activity by worshipers of Shar in the city, as well as evidence of their alliance with Netheril. Suspected worshipers of Shar, Shadovar sympathizers and spies, and any others who offended the crown were put over the wall and left to survive on their own.\nBy the , Wheloon was a dark prison city, no longer a trade hub, and the streets were controlled by gangs of thugs. Even so, a small group of nobles, courtiers, and priests of Chauntea and Lliira begun petitioning the Crown to open the city. They insisted the Purple Dragons couldnt prove all the imprisoned were faithful of Shar and believed that the children born since the city was sealed ought to be given the chance at a righteous life.\nWheloon was originally only lightly populated, beginning as a town of 1,500 people circa 1367 DR,The Cormyr sourcebook lists Wheloon with a population of 1,500 at an estimated date of 1367 DR, while Volos Guide to Cormyr gives a population of more than double that, at 3,700 at an estimated date of 1369 DR, only two years later. The reason for this rapid rise, still prior to the evacuation of Arabel, is not known. This figure is assumed to be more appropriate a year later, after the evacuation. Lord Redbeards poor records might also be to blame for this discrepancy.\nIt had a mixed population, consisting of 82% humans, 6% halflings, 4% dwarves, 4% gnomes, 2% half-elves, 1% elves, and 1% half-orcs.\nFollowing Wheloons transformation into a prison city after the Spellplague, Wheloons population fell to 3,000 by 1479 DR.\nThe Lord of Wheloon through the mid–14 century was Lord Sarp Redbeard, who ruled in the name of King Azoun IV.\nDue to Redbeards poor population records, the taxes paid to the crown fluctuated. He was generally negligent on taxation and tended to ignore the contribution of smugglers to the local economy.\nThe Heralds of Faerûn had an office here, titled \"Wheloon\". In the 1350s and 60s DR, this position was filled by Elaerue Estspirit, who also served as assistant, clerk, and record-keeper to Redbeard.\nThe Huntcrown noble house had holdings in Wheloon.\nA magistrate based here ruled on legal disputes, both in Wheloon and in other settlements in Redbeards domain, like Ghars.\nSprawling on both sides of a river, and with no town walls or natural barriers, Wheloon was difficult to defend.\nThe Wheloon Watch was a militia force of volunteers, all merchants and tradesmen by day. They were basic fighters, equipped with leather armor, maces, short swords, daggers, and crossbows. They were based out of the Wheloon Watch House.\nThe Purple Dragons enforced law and order in Wheloon. Their force in the city numbered approximately 150, and they were led by Constal Maximanus Tholl around 1374 DR.The Cormyr sourcebook states that Wheloon only has a militia, while it and the 1-, 2-, and 3-edition campaign settings state that Lord Redbeard keeps the Purple Dragons out of Whelunians lives, and perhaps the town itself. This does not account for the Purple Dragons mentioned in prior (Waterdeep) and later (Volos Guide to Cormyr and Cormyr The Tearing of the Weave) sources. Taken together, it is possible that the Waterdeep appearance was temporary, owing to the emergency of the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR or a visiting patrol, while the Purple Dragons were stationed there permanently after 1367 DR and before around 1369 DR.\nAs a prison city in the 15 century, Wheloon at last had a wall built around it, albeit to keep the people in.\nWheloon lay at the intersection of the two most valuable and heavily trafficked trade routes in eastern Cormyr the Way of the Manticore from Sembia and the Wyvernflow river between the Wyvernwater and the Sea of Fallen Stars. The town grew and prospered off the Wyvern Ferry that linked both sides of the river, as merchant caravans, barges, and ships increasingly passed through or offloaded their cargo here, and it served as a barge transshipment center. Through the late 1360s DR, Wheloon became a cheaper and less crowded alternative to the ports of Suzail and Marsember.\nIt was a busy and prosperous town, ever growing through the 1360s DR, with wealth and entrepreneurs, known as \"hothands\". Though there were no major merchants, the talented craftsfolk often allied to invest in new ventures. Cut-price transportation services were a favorite, though they had to hire guards to defend themselves from bandits hired by established costers trying to crush the upstart competition.\nThere was a big population of artisans and craftsfolk in Wheloon, who were famous for the quality of their work, thanks to their attention to detail and great patience at their craft. They included many boatmakers and sailmakers, and basketweavers and clay-potters, as well as as wagonwrights.\nLocal agriculture was established in the farming of apples, blueberries, grapes, melons, peaches, pumpkins, raspberries, and wheat. Wheloons port shipped out more bulk food and grain than anywhere else in Cormyr, and returned hefty profits. A local \"hothands\", Sarliman Eurdoe, imported the rosecork from Prespur for its valued properties. The rosecork trees went on to flourish by the southern tributaries of the Wyvernflow.\nFollowing the Spellplague and Wheloons transformation into a prison city, it naturally stopped being a trade hub.\nthumb|250px|left|Merchants meeting in the streets of Wheloon.\nWheloon was an industrious, busy, and prosperous place. Whelunians were often going about some business and traveling to one place or another within the town. Most were hardworking craftsfolk who, though not rich, earned enough money and had enough time on their hands to enjoy their lives. Whelunian craftsfolk had an eye for fine detail and great patience for a task, and these traits were exhibited in the finished goods. These craftsfolk were famous for the quality of their work, and their reputation spread to distant lands.\nUnfortunately, they were preyed upon by the many thieves of Wheloon. These thieves shared the craftsmens eye for detail, composure, and methodical nature. It took them longer to pick a lock than a typical thief, but they could do so more reliably.\nMost deceased Whelunians were buried in the Green, a field outside town. However, some buried their family members on their own property, in small, private cemeteries.\nFollowing Wheloons transformation into a prison city, it became a dumping ground for suspected Shar-worshipers, Shadovar spies and sympathizers, and others whod offended the Cormyrean rulers, as well as those already trapped inside. They were left to look after themselves, and life was hard and dangerous. For protection, people gathered into gangs. There were many of these gangs, all rivals, often ruthless, and they ruled the streets and dominated the town.\nThese Whelunians bitterly resented Cormyr for abandoning them, but also despised self-righteous do-gooders, and believed all people had darkness in them. They were loyal only to other members of their gang, or an adopted group, and uncaring of outsiders. They were often skilled in thievery and in resisting charm magic. A common mark of a Whelunian was their tattoos, both the prisoner tattoos made before they were put over the walls and the gang tattoos earned inside. These could be extensive and recorded their ordeals. They marked escapees, and had to be disguised elsewhere in Cormyr.\nEscaping was very difficult, so much so that \"to escape from Wheloon\" came to mean to accomplish a difficult task. However, it was not impossible. Those who escaped lived in fear of recapture, and usually tried to find a new home far outside Cormyr.\nWheloon in the mid–14 century was a mid-sized town with over two hundred significant buildings, to a small city. It straddled both sides of the Wyvernflow river, with the center of town historically on the western side, which was both the longest settled and the most prosperous. The eastern side grew later, especially when it was settled by refugees of Arabel. Without town walls or other natural barriers to contain it, the town sprawled outwards in all directions. The terrain beneath was hilly, so the meandering streets wound around them, or followed the whims of Whelunian builders, as there was no attempt at urban planning. The streets were cobbled and patched, and often muddy. Road-lamps provided light to Wheloons streets after dark.\nWealthy and fast-growing, Wheloon did not have many permanent buildings, and few stood out as especially grand or particularly rundown. Still, they were always growing, expanding, and improving. Most were built of stone, and some had upper stories of stucco and timber. Others were fashioned of wood or wattle.\nMany of Wheloons businesses and houses were roofed with bright green slate shingles. These came from the nations largest quarry situated not far to the north of the city, a monster-haunted pit near Masarks Grove. This native slate was dark green when first cut, but brightened on exposure to the sun. Travelers were often impressed by the vibrant green roofs, and the buildings were nicknamed \"the jade towers of Wheloon\" and the city itself the \"Jade Towers\". A few other buildings and warehouses had thatched roofs instead.\nWhelunians built their own houses and operated small businesses from them. Bedrooms and kitchens often doubled as workshops as a result. Still, they were proud of their homes, whatever they were made from or did in them, and often worked on improving them.\nWheloon was always seen to be a busy place, with people traveling back and forth on business, while drovers moving animals and merchant caravans often came through. It was noisy with the sounds of labor, of wagons and animals, of people talking and calling. Such things went on through the day and deep into the night.\nThe greatest landmark in Wheloon was the Wyvernflow River that divided it in two. The Wyvern Ferry Route operated ferries over the water, joined the two halves of the town together and linking both ends of the Way of the Manticore. With heavy traffic and many Whelunians owning boats, fares remained cheap at one copper piece, and ferries ran day and night. Two inns lay on opposite ends of the ferry route the Wyvern Watch Inn on the west bank and the Lantern Inn and Boathouse on the east.\nOn the west bank, the Way of the Manticore crossed Wheloon Way, with the Wheloon Watch House, the Purple Dragon barracks, Wheloon Jail, and the armory all standing on one corner of the intersection. North up Wheloon Way could be found Oldstone Hall, the lords manor, standing opposite the Wheloon Moothouse, which, unfortunately, lay near Haldoss Fine Butchery. Impil Street was the site of many warehouses owned by the Cormyrean Coins Coster.\nThe Green was a large field southwest of the town. The majority of deceased Whelunians were buried in the Green, but small herds of livestock, owned by a few city-folk, were also allowed to graze there. The Green was ringed by a communally owned wooden fence.\nRathools Pond lay within the town, on its northwestern side. For centuries, Whelunians used it as a burial site for war heroes and those slain in battle. The water turned orange-brown with rust from their armor and weapons. By the mid–13 century DR, Rathools Pond was the local swimming pool and fishing hole, but it was considered unsafe for drinking or fishing. However, the priests of Chauntea at the Harvest Hall actually opposed efforts to clean it up, fearing the dead would be disturbed and their spirits grow angry.\nthumb|250px|right|A welcome to the Silvery Sembian Snail.\nOfficial buildings\nOldstone Hall • Wheloon Jail • Wheloon Moothouse • Wheloon Watch House\nShops & Businesses\n23 Impil Street • Basults Books • The Blackbard • Cormyrean Coins Coster • Falconstar Wayshipping • The Fish House • Haerldouns Helms and Shields • Haldoss Fine Butchery • Hannos Herbs and Medicines • Rallogar Hardware • Redbeard Rental Storage and Shipping • Sendevers Stables • Slowtooth Weaponry • Wyvern Ferry Route • Wheloon Tack & Leather • Woumars Wheloon Mill\nInns\nImmerhand Inn • Lantern Inn and Boathouse • Wyvern Watch Inn\nTaverns\nScarlet Sheath • Silvery Sembian Snail • Sleeping Cat\nTemples & Shrines\nGods Grove • Harvest Hall • Temple of Mystra\nOther Locations\nThe Green • Rathools Pool\nRoads & Streets\nImpil Street • Way of the Manticore • Westbank March • Wheloon Way"
