        "mainbody": "'''Wheloon''' ({{Pronounce|way|LOON|refs=}}), sometimes nicknamed the '''Jade Towers''', was a town and later small city in the kingdom of [[Cormyr]] in [[interior Faerûn]]. It lay at the junction of the [[Wyvernflow River]] and the [[Way of the Manticore]] and at the end of the [[Hullack Trail]] in southeastern Cormyr.",
        "Language": "People and things from here were called \"Whelunian\".",
        "History": {
            "Early history": "Predating Wheloon and the ferry was the [[God's Grove]], a shrine to [[Silvanus]] and [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] grove to the east.\n\nOriginally a small [[thorp]] that lived off the trade of river crossings on the [[Wyvern Ferry Route]], Wheloon slowly developed as trade along the Way of the Manticore increased and more ships starting using the Wyvernflow. It grew into a town based around the ferry. The [[Harvest Hall]] temple of [[Chauntea]] was built around this time.\n\nAlthough Wheloon sat at the crossing of two of Cormyr's most important travel routes, it usually played only a minor role in Cormyrean history prior to [[1374 DR]].\n\nIn the [[900 DR|Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR]], King [[Galaghard III]]'s army, the [[Glory of Cormyr]], fought a battle against the [[Witch Lords]] and their [[undead]] forces at the fords of Wheloon, overrunning them but unable to achieve a final victory. They eventually drove them to the [[Vast Swamp]] and [[Battle with the Witch Lords|defeated them]] there. This was the last historical event significant to Cormyr to occur in Wheloon until 1374 DR.",
            "Modern History": "Wheloon was one of a number of places captured by the Lost King [[Gondegal]] in the [[1352 DR|Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR]]. Like the others, his mercenary troops occupied and pillaged the town before being ousted by the [[Purple Dragons]] as Gondegal's eight-day kingdom fell.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], in early [[Eleint]] of the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[Cyric]] and some of his [[Zhentilar]] force visited Wheloon as they passed through Cormyr. Cyric left at least one of his agents there to interfere with [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], [[Midnight]], and [[Adon]]. Shortly after they arrived, Kelemvor was framed for the robbery and murder of a local merchant, with Cyric's agent testifying to Lord Redbeard that they had seen him leave the house with a bloody sword. When the Wheloon Watch tried to apprehend Kelemvor, the group fled on stolen horses, pursued by the Watch and the Purple Dragons, and made a successful getaway.\n\nDuring the [[Goblin War]], the neighboring city of [[Arabel]] was evacuated in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. The refugees poured into Wheloon, rapidly increasing the population. They settled and built up the east bank, expanding Wheloon from a town to a small city in a few years.\n\nBy [[1374 DR]], an aging Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]], once considered headstrong and almost independent of the crown, had proven his loyalty though a combination of trade deals and military actions. However, his main focus was still on the good of Wheloon.\n\n[[File:Temple of Mystra.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The temple of Mystra was meant to be good for Wheloon...'']]\nThe priestess [[Naedaenya Arthas]] met with Sarp Redbeard around [[Ches]] of 1374 DR to request the construction of a [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|temple of Mystra]] in Wheloon. She persuaded him that it would open a market for [[magical item]]s, [[spell]] [[material component|components]], and lore, and boost the city's economy. She also paid hefty bribes to Redbeard. He approved construction, and granted the priests tax breaks. He told Whelunians it would bring more people and trade and make Wheloon important. The temple was sited on the crumbling foundations of the ruined citadel that lay on the northern edge of town. Using magically assisted construction techniques, it took only months to build, and was nearly completed in [[Eleint]] that year. It was Cormyr's only temple to Mystra, but many Whelunians had little need to worship the goddess of magic, and it became only a local curiosity. Then, on [[Eleint 6]], an itinerant cleric of Mystra, [[Tunaster Dranik]], and a group of [[adventurer]]s in the service of Mystra discovered the temple to be a front for [[Shar]]ran cultists to kidnap magically gifted citizens and travelers in a plot to tear a rift in the [[Weave]]. Wheloon's Purple Dragons investigated the matter and Constal Maximanus Tholl brought the adventurers to an audience with Redbeard, who requested they continue their investigations and follow the cultists into the Vast Swamp. Redbeard, Tholl, and the Purple Dragons remained in Wheloon to guard the city and the temple. After pursuing the cult, the adventurers foiled the plot and returned on [[Eleint 13]], and helped open up trade agreements between [[Cormyr]] and the [[Sharptooth]] tribe of [[lizardfolk]] in the Vast Swamp.",
            "Post-Spellplague": "After the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1473}},{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|62}} [[Foril Obarskyr I|King Foril]] decreed that Wheloon be transformed into a prison city, sentencing all those inside to be prisoners for life, sealed in by physical and magical barriers. The decision was made following unprecedented activity by worshipers of Shar in the city, as well as evidence of their alliance with [[Netheril]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|56}} Suspected worshipers of Shar, [[Shadovar]] sympathizers and spies, and any others who offended the crown were put over the wall and left to survive on their own.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Wheloon was a dark prison city, no longer a trade hub, and the streets were controlled by gangs of thugs. Even so, a small group of nobles, courtiers, and priests of [[Chauntea]] and [[Lliira]] begun petitioning the Crown to open the city. They insisted the Purple Dragons couldn't prove all the imprisoned were faithful of Shar and believed that the children born since the city was sealed ought to be given the chance at a righteous life."
        },
        "Demographics": "Wheloon was originally only lightly populated, beginning as a town of 1,500 people ''circa'' [[1367 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The [[Cormyr (sourcebook)|''Cormyr'' sourcebook]] lists Wheloon with a population of 1,500 at an estimated date of 1367 DR, while ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'' gives a population of more than double that, at 3,700 at an estimated date of 1369 DR, only two years later. The reason for this rapid rise, still prior to the evacuation of Arabel, is not known. This figure is assumed to be more appropriate a year later, after the evacuation. Lord Redbeard's poor records might also be to blame for this discrepancy.\n\nIt had a mixed population, consisting of 82% [[human]]s, 6% [[halfling]]s, 4% [[dwarves]], 4% [[gnome]]s, 2% [[half-elves]], 1% [[elves]], and 1% [[half-orc]]s.\n\nFollowing Wheloon's transformation into a prison city after the Spellplague, Wheloon's population fell to 3,000 by 1479 DR.",
        "Government & Politics": "The Lord of Wheloon through the mid–14{{th}} century was Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]], who ruled in the name of King [[Azoun IV]].\n\nDue to Redbeard's poor population records, the taxes paid to the crown fluctuated. He was generally negligent on taxation and tended to ignore the contribution of smugglers to the local economy.\n\nThe [[Heralds of Faerûn]] had an office here, titled \"Wheloon\". In the 1350s and 60s [[DR]], this position was filled by [[Elaerue Estspirit]], who also served as assistant, clerk, and record-keeper to Redbeard.\n\nThe [[Huntcrown]] noble house had holdings in Wheloon.\n\nA [[laws of Cormyr|magistrate]] based here ruled on legal disputes, both in Wheloon and in other settlements in Redbeard's domain, like [[Ghars]].",
        "Defenses": "Sprawling on both sides of a river, and with no town walls or natural barriers, Wheloon was difficult to defend.\n\nThe [[Wheloon Watch]] was a militia force of volunteers, all merchants and tradesmen by day. They were basic [[fighter]]s, equipped with [[leather armor]], [[mace]]s, [[short sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[crossbow]]s. They were based out of the [[Wheloon Watch House]].\n\nThe [[Purple Dragons]] enforced law and order in Wheloon. Their force in the city numbered approximately 150, and they were led by [[Constal]] [[Maximanus Tholl]] around 1374 DR.The ''Cormyr'' sourcebook states that Wheloon only has a militia, while it and the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set|1{{st}}-]], [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|2{{nd}}-]], and [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|3{{rd}}-edition]] campaign settings state that Lord Redbeard keeps the Purple Dragons out of Whelunians' lives, and perhaps the town itself. This does not account for the Purple Dragons mentioned in prior ([[Waterdeep (adventure)|''Waterdeep'']]) and later (''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'' and ''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'') sources. Taken together, it is possible that the ''Waterdeep'' appearance was temporary, owing to the emergency of the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR or a visiting patrol, while the Purple Dragons were stationed there permanently after 1367 DR and before around 1369 DR.\n\nAs a prison city in the 15{{th}} century, Wheloon at last had a wall built around it, albeit to keep the people in.",
        "Economy & Trade": "Wheloon lay at the intersection of the two most valuable and heavily trafficked trade routes in eastern Cormyr: the [[Way of the Manticore]] from [[Sembia]] and the [[Wyvernflow]] river between the [[Wyvernwater]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The town grew and prospered off the [[Wyvern Ferry]] that linked both sides of the river, as merchant caravans, barges, and ships increasingly passed through or offloaded their cargo here, and it served as a barge transshipment center. Through the late 1360s DR, Wheloon became a cheaper and less crowded alternative to the ports of [[Suzail]] and [[Marsember]].\n\nIt was a busy and prosperous town, ever growing through the 1360s DR, with wealth and entrepreneurs, known as \"hothands\". Though there were no major merchants, the talented craftsfolk often allied to invest in new ventures. Cut-price transportation services were a favorite, though they had to hire guards to defend themselves from bandits hired by established [[coster]]s trying to crush the upstart competition.\n\nThere was a big population of artisans and craftsfolk in Wheloon, who were famous for the quality of their work, thanks to their attention to detail and great patience at their craft. They included many boatmakers and sailmakers, and basketweavers and clay-potters, as well as as wagonwrights.\n\nLocal agriculture was established in the farming of [[apple]]s, [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, [[peach]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[wheat]]. Wheloon's port shipped out more bulk food and grain than anywhere else in Cormyr, and returned hefty profits. A local \"hothands\", [[Sarliman Eurdoe]], imported the [[rosecork]] from [[Prespur]] for its valued properties. The rosecork trees went on to flourish by the southern tributaries of the Wyvernflow.\n\nFollowing the Spellplague and Wheloon's transformation into a prison city, it naturally stopped being a trade hub.",
        "Culture & Society": {
            "Post-Spellplague": "Following Wheloon's transformation into a prison city, it became a dumping ground for suspected Shar-worshipers, Shadovar spies and sympathizers, and others who'd offended the Cormyrean rulers, as well as those already trapped inside. They were left to look after themselves, and life was hard and dangerous. For protection, people gathered into gangs. There were many of these gangs, all rivals, often ruthless, and they ruled the streets and dominated the town.\n\nThese Whelunians bitterly resented Cormyr for abandoning them, but also despised self-righteous do-gooders, and believed all people had darkness in them. They were loyal only to other members of their gang, or an adopted group, and uncaring of outsiders. They were often skilled in thievery and in resisting [[charm]] [[magic]]. A common mark of a Whelunian was their tattoos, both the prisoner tattoos made before they were put over the walls and the gang tattoos earned inside. These could be extensive and recorded their ordeals. They marked escapees, and had to be disguised elsewhere in Cormyr.\n\nEscaping was very difficult, so much so that \"to escape from Wheloon\" came to mean to accomplish a difficult task. However, it was not impossible. Those who escaped lived in fear of recapture, and usually tried to find a new home far outside Cormyr."
