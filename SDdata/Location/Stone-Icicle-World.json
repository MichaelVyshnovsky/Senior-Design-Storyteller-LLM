        "mainbody": "tone-Icicle-World was a network of caverns located under Miyama Province in Kozakura.\nStone-Icicle-World was an extensive network of caverns that stretched under Miyama Province and beyond. Its narrow, debris-filled entrance was concealed within the dense forests at the foothills of the mountains. Although the precise location of the entrance was unknown to the general populace, select hengeyokai and korobokuru were familiar with the path to the entrance of the caverns.\nIt was believed that these caverns extended for hundreds, possibly thousands, of miles below the surface, with magical pathways that led to other planes and dimensions. The caverns were reputed to be inhabited by a variety of creatures, though concrete accounts were rare, as few returned to share their experiences."
