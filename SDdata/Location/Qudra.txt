Qudra, or the City of Power, was a major power in the northern reaches of Zakhara.
Qudra was a model of duty and organization. It overlooked the Great Sea from the mouth of Al-Faddi River about  northwest of Hiyal. Qudra served as Zakharas bastion against the unenlightened lands outside its borders. The citys fortifications were increased over a long history of pirate raids and barbarian incursions. As of 1367 DR, Qudra had the strongest bulwarks in all of Zakhara, presenting a stern gray face to the north.
Qudra was ruled by Mamluks who were fiercely devoted to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz. It was considered one of the three great cities of Zakhara.  This city was noted for its well run and well-treated slave market, its mamluks, armor, and trade in northern goods.
