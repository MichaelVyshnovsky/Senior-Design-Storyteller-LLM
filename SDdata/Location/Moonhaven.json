It was raided by [[Dark Justiciars]] a number of times in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}.\n\nIn the early years of the formation of Elturgard, during the mid–15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Hellriders]] made multiple patrols around and near the village. This upset several of its residents, including [[Damon Briska]], a descendent of the town's founders.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the town was under control of a band of [[goblin]]s that operated under the orders of [[Fezzerk]], of the [[Cult of the Absolute]].",
