'''Malaxer''' was a large town in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
It stood on the [[Lapal Way]], between [[Sammaresh]] and [[Abreon]], and north of the [[Mhair Jungles]].

==Government & Religion==
The leader of the city was titled High Lapalyth, which was equivalent to a baron. ''Circa'' [[1373 DR]], this was the [[ranger]] [[Tormar o' the Axe]].

The civic deity of Malaxer was [[Silvanus]].

==Population==
The town had a population of 4,103 in 1373 DR, including a small number of [[wild dwarves]] who'd been forced to leave their homelands for various reasons.

==Activities==
Malaxer was home to hunters and woodcutters who braved the northern fringe of the Mhair Jungles, as well as expert guides who'd hire themselves out. In fact, the highest concentration of this profession in Lapaliiya was here. Malaxer was the starting point for the majority of expeditions into [[yuan-ti]] territory, but a good number of guides available were actually yuan-ti agents in disguise, looking out for adventurers who threatened the [[serpentfolk]] or might have things of interest to them.
