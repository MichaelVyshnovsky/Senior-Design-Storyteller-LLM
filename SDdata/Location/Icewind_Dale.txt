'''Icewind Dale''' was an arctic tundra located in the [[Frozenfar]] region of [[the North]], It earned its name from the harsh winds and icy storms that destroyed buildings and scoured the landscape.
{{Quote|If I could choose what life would be mine, it would be this life that I now have, at this time. I am at peace, and yet, the world around me swirls with turmoil...The reality of existence here in Icewind Dale is harsh indeed, an environment unforgiving, where one mistake will cost you your life.|[[Drizzt Do'Urden]].}}

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
[[File:Plains - Ten Towns.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The snowy wastes of the dale, some ways off from the Ten Towns.'']]
The dale was a harsh, near-uninhabitable  land that regularly plunged below freezing temperatures.{{Cite adventurers league/The Frozen North|3}} and the region received little sunlight, particularly during the severe winter months. It was home to only the most hardened of frontiersmen, pioneers, and [[barbarian]]s. Beyond the sporadic dots of civilization dwelled terrifying beasts and deadly monsters of the North.

Most folks traversed the dale by means of [[dogsled]] or by foot with the use of [[snowshoe]]s. Yet some others preferred to ride atop [[axe beak]]s native to the region.

===Climate===
Icewind Dale experienced freezing temperatures for much of the year. While kinder summer months ranged from 11{{degreesF}} to 70{{degreesF}} (–12{{degreesC}} to 21{{degreesC}}), the temperature of the unforgiving winters dipped as low as -40{{degreesF}} (-40{{degreesC}}). While snowfall was relentless, much of it blew east to the nearby Reghed Glacier.

Fierce blizzards ravaged the snowy wastelands of Icewind Dale and avalanches were regular occurrences within its mountainous regions.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|10-11}}

==Geography==
[[File:Icewind Dale RotF map.png|thumb|right|350px|''A map of Icewind Dale marked with important cities and landmarks.'']]
The dale was located south and east of the [[Trackless Sea]], north of the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]] and west of the icy [[Reghed Glacier]].

It was primarily accessible by the [[Northern Means]], the road that extended north from the coastal city of [[Luskan]].

===Flora & Fauna===
Icewind Dale was home to animals like [[hare]]s, [[arctic fox]]es, [[reindeer]], and [[elk]], along with beasts like [[crag cat]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[polar bear]]s, [[saber-toothed tiger]]s, [[snowy owlbear]]s, and monstrous [[yeti]]s.

Other dangerous creatures found throughout the region included elementals known as [[air weird]]s,{{Cite adventurers league/Divining Evil|23}} undead [[spirits]] known as [[coldlight walker]]s, and perhaps most-terrifying, a number of [[white dragon]]s,

There was scarce plant life to be found throughout the region, save for a [[Lonelywood Forest|solitary forest]]{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|17-20}} and the [[Great Oak]] around which a [[Kuldahar|lone town]] was founded.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 3|6-10}} and especially hardy [[lichen]] was among the notable types of flora that managed to endure the frigid elements of Icewind Dale.

==Geographical Features==
[[File:Honor Among Thieves Icewind Dale.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''A long trek across the ice for [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]].'']]
===Lakes===
The dale was famous for its three mineral-laden lakes: [[Maer Dualdon]], [[Lac Dinneshere]], and [[Redwaters]].
* [[Maer Dualdon]]: The largest and deepest of the three lakes was once the premier destination for all who dared the trek that far north.
* [[Lac Dinneshere]]: The waters of the lake appeared to change in hue depending on the weather that was just about to wash over the dale.
* [[Redwaters]]: The smallest lake earned its name from a bloody battle that took place on the land over which towns were built.

===Bodies of Water===
* [[Redrun]]: This stream flowed from Lac Dinneshere into the small Redwaters lake.
* [[Shaengarne River]]: While the waters of this river flowed into the Trackless Sea year-round, its top waters froze over during winter.

===Mountains===
[[File:IWD HoW WMap.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A view of Kelvin's Cairn, Lonelywood, and Maer Dualdon.'']]
* [[Kelvin's Cairn]], a peak that offered fresh water to the surrounding lakes when "spring" bloomed every [[Midsummer]].
* [[Mount Shatterglass]], the {{SIAdj|3000|ft|adj=tall}} peak that offered a spectacular view over the dale below.{{Cite adventurers league/Cold Benevolence|9}}

===Others===
* [[Bremen's Run]]
* [[Dwarven Valley]], a miles-long chasm and adjoining network of caves that extended out from Kelvin's Cairn.
* [[Fields of Slaughter]], the ancient battlefield that spread across between the [[Severed Hand]] and the Spine of the World.
* [[Icewind Pass]]

==Government==
The capital of Icewind Dale, [[Bryn Shander]], was also its largest settlement.

==Trade==

{{Quote|Ah little fishes, what trouble you bring.|[[Regis]].}}
Perhaps the greatest industry of Icewind Dale was the fishing and utilization of [[knucklehead trout]]. Many of the region's lakeside settlements relied entirely on the trout they fished and the goods they made from their [[ivory]]-like bones. Knucklehead scrimshaw was the art that few mastered, and skilled scrimshanders were held in high esteem.

Knucklehead scrimshaw goods made their way across the Realms. Some carvings could be found as far away as [[Durpar]], some {{SI|5000|mi|k}} to the south in the [[Shining Lands]]. In those far-off lands they sold for as much as 6,000 [[gp]].

[[Whale oil]] was an important commodity in settlements across Icewind Dale. Because wood was so scarce, oil was the preferred means to warm hearth and home. As such, whaling throughout the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] was among the more profitable industries of the region.

===Natural Wealth===
One of the most unique natural riches that could be found in Icewind Dale was a mineral known as ''[[chardalyn]]''. This naturally-occurring stone could absorb magical energy, which was subsequently released when the mineral was crushed or otherwise destroyed.<ref name="VoloN-p70" >

==History==
The history of Icewind Dale was one of malign influence and warring conflict. Over the centuries, the region was repeatedly conquered and re-conquered by despots and would-be monarchs, and continuously corrupted by evil powers from far off realms and other [[planes of existence]].

===Early History===
Millennia before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the great [[frost giant]] Jarl [[Kelvin Duarol]] came into the possession of the ''[[Crenshinibon]]''. This ancient and evil [[artifact]] crafted by seven powerful [[lich]]s allied with the [[demon lord]] [[Errtu]], and was first brought to [[Toril]] in the far-off continent of [[Zakhara]]. Kelvin attempted to use the power of the ''Crenshinibon'' to forge a new frost giant kingdom atop the ruins of ancient [[Ostoria]] but was ultimately unsuccessful. His schemes attracted the anger of the god [[Tempus]], who in turn slew Kelvin

In {{Yearlink|-2100}}, [[Illusk]]an refugees first migrated to Icewind Dale and settled. Their descendants came to found the original [[Reghedmen]] barbarian tribes. Over time, they were joined by [[Northlander]]s who ventured north along the [[Sword Coast]] in longships.

Centuries before the [[Era of Upheaval]], Arakon the Arch-Mage [[Conquest of Arakon the Arch-Mage|attempted to conquer]] Icewind Dale with his army of mercenaries. Over the course of weeks, he butchered and enslaved the people of the [[Uthgardt]] and [[Reghedmen]] barbarian tribes. [[Jerrod]], a warrior-[[shaman]] of [[Tempos]]―the local name of Tempus―rallied the tribes that remained, and together they turned away the mercenary army. Desperate to to still achieve victory, Arakon conjured a ''[[portal]]'' and summoned a horde of [[demon]]s from the [[lower planes]]. In order to save his people, and all of Icewind Dale, Jerrod threw himself into the ''portal'', sacrificing his life and preventing the fiends from overwhelming the region.

Less than a generation later, [[Kresselack]] the Black Wolf emerged as a great leader among the barbarian tribes of the dale. He slaughtered many in his own campaign of conquest, but managed to unite the tribes within a single kingdom for a brief time.

The collective settlements of the Ten Towns were founded some time during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]]. Bryn Shander was the first among the towns to attract adventurers, businesspeople, or other folks looking for a second start to their life.

===13{{th}} Century===
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1269}}, [[Damien Morienus]], a former master of the North Tower of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] relocated to Icewind Dale. He was a powerful [[necromancer]] who was using the local barbarian tribes for his horrific experiments. Eventually, he summoned demons to exact revenge on his enemies. The monsters used their infernal magics to summon hellfire that melted all the snow away. The areas to the Northwest of Ten Towns and the shores of [[Maer Dualdon]] suffered the most by floods and permafrost's melting, killing a barbarian tribe, and the inhabitants of the [[Accursed Tower]] that sank into the mud. This disaster later became known as the [[Great Thaw]] by the locals. Most never learned about the true nature of it believing it to be a natural event. 

[[File:Cryshal Tirith.png|thumb|right|300px|''The Cryshal Tirith conjured by Belhifet over the village of Easthaven.'']]
Just over a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the [[devil]] [[Belhifet]] himself attempted to conquer Icewind Dale. Belhifet had been imprisoned on Toril by the [[tanar'ri]] superiors for punishment regarding a blood feud that threatened to disrupt the infernal hierarchy. Belhifet was contact by the ''[[Crenshinibon]]'', a malevolent artifact lost to the ages of time. The ''Crenshinibon'' allowed Belhifet to awaken from his icy prison and raise an army to conquer the region. While the fiend managed to briefly freeze over the settlement of Easthaven, he was banished back to [[Avernus]] by the intrepid adventurers. 

Later that same year, barbarian lord [[Wylfdene]] claimed to be a reincarnation of the famed Uthgardt hero Jerrod. Backed by the claim, and secretly possessed by the vengeful spirit of a white dragon [[Icasaracht]], Wylfdene built an outpost on Bremen's Run and guided unite tribes against the Ten Towns who took rightfully barbarian lands. He helmed several battles against the warriors of the Ten Towns and dwarves of [[Clan Battlehammer]] until the same group of adventurers arrived to resolve the conflict peacefully. Diplomacy failed and Wylfdene was slain. Despite the fact that Icasaracht's possession was unknown to most and forgotten by the history books, the adventurers traveled to the spirit's lair and destroyed her.

===14{{th}} Century===
Yet another monstrous army was raised in Icewind Dale in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, by the children of the fiend Belhifet. The [[cambion]]s [[Isair]] and [[Madae]] founded the [[Legion of the Chimera]], a horde of monstrous half-breed creatures that rallied at the [[Severed Hand]] fortress. The legion fought a number of battles with the militias of the Ten Towns, and were ultimately vanquished by a group of mercenary adventurers.

In {{Yearlink|1351}}, [[Heafstaag]] and his group of barbarians fail to conquer the settlement of [[Termalaine]] in their massive sweep of the Ten-Towns. In this same year, the ''Crenshinibon'', a powerful magical item lost to the ages, was found by [[Akar Kessel]], an apprentice [[wizard]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] from [[Luskan]]. Over the next few years, Kessel amassed an army of [[goblinoid]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[giant]]s and allied himself with the [[demon lord]] Errtu.

Five years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, they newly-named "Tyrant of Icewind Dale" attempted to conquer all of Icewind Dale. Kessel and his forces were thwarted by the [[Companions of the Hall]] adventurers, the dwarves of [[Clan Battlehammer]], and allied folks of the Ten Towns,  in a great conflict known as the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]]. The ''Crenshinibon'' was destroyed in the battle, and its malevolent 'demonic magic' afflicted the native ''chardalyn'' in Icewind Dale.

Several powerful individuals attempted to seize power following the defeat of Akar Kessel's army. Notable among them were Jarl [[Utaar Kelvinsson]], a mad [[beholder]] called [[Hagedorn]], and even [[Levistus]] the Prince of [[Stygia]] in the Nine Hells.

After the dwarven fortress of [[Mithral Hall]] was reclaimed that same year, several hundred dwarves relocated to the settlements of Icewind Dale.

===15{{th}} Century===
[[File:Chardragon.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Sunblight's chardalyn dragon raining destruction upon the people of the Ten Towns.'']]
A storm in {{Yearlink|1473}} caused a wave on Lac Dinneshere to destroy the docks of Easthaven and several of its ships, as well as their crews.<ref>

On [[Eleint 3]] in {{Yearlink|1485}}, corrupted ''chardalyn''—referred to as''[[black ice]]''―was discovered in Icewind Dale. The substance had a corruptive influence on anyone that handled it or came within close proximity. Soon after, Akar Kessel returned as a [[lich]], and raised hordes of [[zombified]] dwarves and began assailing travelers and caravans that crossed the snowy landscape of the realm.

In the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, Icewind Dale was cursed by the goddess [[Auril]]. She plunged the lands into ongoing darkness, preventing the sun from appearing within the sky each morning. Referred to by locals as the [[Everlasting Rime]], this supernatural phenomenon afflicted Icewind Dale for at least two years.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|5-6}} Plant life died, animals went into hiding, and food became scared during that time. Tensions rose within dale's villages and towns.{{Cite comic/At the Spine of the World 1|11}}

Taking advantage of the darkness that shrouded the realm, a [[duergar]] warlord by the name of [[Xardorok Sunblight]] raised his own army to conquer Icewind Dale. Like others before him, Xardorok was corrupted the malevolent influence of ''chardalyn''. He managed to forge a giant [[chardalyn dragon]],

==Notable Locations==
[[File:Icewind Dale map.png|thumb|right|250px|''The map of Icewind Dale circa [[1347 DR]].'']]
===Settlements===
====Ten Towns====
Icewind Dale's only permanent settlements were known as the [[Ten Towns]], a confederation of minor settlements that cooperated with each other. The Ten Towns comprised the hamlets nestled on Redwaters lake, [[Good Mead]], and [[Dougan's Hole]]; the three settlements located on the shores of Lac Dinneshere, [[Easthaven]], [[Caer-Konig]], and [[Caer-Dineval]]; the four that encircled Maer Dualdon, [[Lonelywood]], [[Bremen]], [[Termalaine]], and the walled town of [[Targos]], [[Shaengarne Ford]] was a small logging village, southwest from Targos, built on the shores of the Shaengarne River. The settlement of [[Slow Cedric's Gallop]] was a small frontier settlement on the [[Southern Pass]] of the Spine of the World, overrun and destroyed in [[1170 DR]].

Away from Ten Towns, all the way on the northern reaches of the [[Spine of the World]], laid the settlement of [[Kuldahar]]. The village was a small group of buildings clustered around the great [[oak]] tree, protected from the elements by the [[Heartstone Gem]]. Kuldahar had regular trade caravans braving the harsh wilderness to and from Ten Towns.

====Other Settlements====
* [[Karkolohk]], the [[goblin]] fort-settlement nestled within the foothills of the Spine.
* [[Revel's End]], an isolated prison situated far to the north of the dale on a cliff overlooking the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|113}}{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|154}}

===Landmarks===
* [[Black Cabin]], a solitary lodge that served as a refuge for many who traveled across the dale.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|116}}
* [[Damien's Tower]], the cursed residence of [[Damien Morienus]].
* [[Dorn's Deep]], a dwarven fortress located on a lone peak in the Spine of the World.
* [[Jarlmoot]], the ancient meeting place of the region's frost giants.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|137}}
* [[Lost Spire of Netheril]], a mage tower that was torn asunder from the [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Ythryn]].{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|145}}

===Roads & Trails===
* [[Eastway]], the only paved road in Icewind Dale linked the hub of Bryn Shander with the communities of Lac Dinneshere.
* [[Ten Trail]], the wagon trail led north from the settlement of [[Hundelstone]], through the [[North/South Pass]], which allowed merchants and travelers to make their way to Bryn Shander.

==Inhabitants ==
The region was mainly populated by fishers, craftspeople, loggers, and merchants that tolerated the hostile climate, in the hope of trading in [[ivory]], [[gem]]s, and other forms of natural wealth.

While most residents of the dale lived in the Ten Towns, the dwarves mined in isolated caves and caverns while the barbarian tribes roamed after their migratory prey.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-03-03 - Rothé herds}}

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Arveiaturace]], the ancient white dragon that claimed part of Icewind Dale as her territory.
* [[Hedrun Arnsfirth]], the [[chosen]] of Auril the Frostmaiden.
* [[Markham Southwell]], the sheriff of Bryn Shander during ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Ravisin]], a local [[frost druid]] that spent much of her efforts ''[[awaken]]ing'' local animals and plant life.
* [[Vaelish Gant]], a malevolent [[abjurer]] of the Arcane Brotherhood who was imprisoned within Revel's End.

==Rumors and Legends==
Many bards from the lands to the south confidently told their audiences there was nothing north of the Spine of the World mountains, save for the Endless Ice Sea. They were of course grossly misinformed.

Rumors of various perils regularly circulated throughout the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. Notable among these were rumors that involved an underwater monster that laired within Maer Dualdon, packs of [[winter wolves]] that hunted townspeople, and fearsome beasts like the dreaded [[white moose]].

Local legend told of the [[White Lady (spirit)|White Lady]], a spirit that haunted the shore of Lac Dinneshere.
