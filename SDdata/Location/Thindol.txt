'''Thindol''' was a country on the southern coast of the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Geography==
Above ground, it was covered in long grasslands. Below ground, however, there were flooded tunnels.

The [[Hills of Sythrilia]] hid a network of narrow caves.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}

==People==
The land was inhabited by [[Tashalan]]s and [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]] of the [[Thinguth]] tribe. Although [[human]], some carried the blood of their yuan-ti conquerors. They were famed for their incredibly swift running ability. Others had exceptional endurance.

[[Gold dwarves]] dwelt in the hills and the mountains, while [[kuo-toa]] and [[yuan-ti]] (with a swimming snake appearance) lurked in the flooded tunnels. The latter two races were allied and at war with the dwarves.

==Society==
It was a mercantile nation defended by very capable militias and dedicated yuan-ti hunters. They fought with fine [[cutlass]]es and even [[blade boot]]s and wore [[studded leather]], while [[potion]]s of ''[[blur]]'' were common.

==Notable Thindolese==
* [[Sythrilia]], a famous heroine responsible for freeing her people from the rule of the yuan-ti, for whom the Hills of Sythrilia were named.
* The [[Sythrilian Sybil]], a noted psychic seer and expert on [[psionics]] named for the Hills of Sythrilia in which she dwelt.
