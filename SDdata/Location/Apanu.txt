Apanu was a stone-built fortress in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra, standing just south of the northern border with Tu Lung.
The fortress was built as a show of strength, but Tu Lung displayed little interest in marching over the border. Circa 1357 DR, it had a garrison of 1,000 soldiers, who conducted patrols of the surrounding jungle and provided escorts for the merchant caravans.
