The Fishstink was the poorest and most dangerous ward in Tarmalune, named for how it smelled. It was located to the east of the city.
The inhabitants of the Fishstink were the poor, outcasts, criminals, fugitives and the infirm or maimed, as well as escaped slaves of other cities in Laerakond, who arrived in the city without enough money to live in the other wards. Members of the monstrous races, such as orcs and minotaurs, also lived in the Fishstink.
The authorities of Tarmalune allowed the inhabitants of the Fishstink to hunt seagulls for food, as a way to reduce the criminal activity in this ward.
