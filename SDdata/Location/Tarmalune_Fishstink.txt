The '''Fishstink''' was the poorest and most dangerous ward in [[Tarmalune]], named for how it smelled.{{Cite dragon/376/Tarmalune and the Windrise Ports|46}} It was located to the east of the city.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|56}}

==Inhabitants==
The inhabitants of the Fishstink were the poor, outcasts, criminals, fugitives and the infirm or maimed, as well as escaped slaves of other cities in [[Laerakond]], who arrived in the city without enough money to live in the other wards. Members of the monstrous races, such as [[orc]]s and [[minotaur]]s, also lived in the Fishstink.

The authorities of Tarmalune allowed the inhabitants of the Fishstink to hunt seagulls for food, as a way to reduce the criminal activity in this ward.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|47}}
