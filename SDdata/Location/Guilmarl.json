        "Geography": "Guilmarl was the southernmost city in Dambrath located along the coast on the [[Great Sea]]. Violent storms assaulted the city for the entire three-month rainy season. Many of the wealthier citizens opted to winter in calmer cities.\n\nThe close presence of the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]] to the west made Guilmarl a hot and stuffy place to live.",
        "History": "Many pirate and merchant ships harbored in Guilmarl outside of the rainy season, using the city as a launching point for [[Zakhara]], [[Halruaa]], and beyond. The main factor keeping the city from fading away was its superb pearl beds, allowing at least half of the population to earn a living revolving around the pearl trade.\n\nSome time between [[1367]] and [[1372 DR]] the city was destroyed and overrun by many [[lizardfolk]] and a large [[fang dragon]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Fewer [[crinti]] lived here compared to other cities in Dambrath. Most despised the scent of the Great Swamp and chose to live elsewhere. After 1372 DR no crinti lived in the city."
