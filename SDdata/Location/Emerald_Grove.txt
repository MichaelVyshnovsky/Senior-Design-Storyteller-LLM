The '''Emerald Grove''', also named the '''Old Oak's Grove''', was a [[druid]] grove dedicated to [[Silvanus]] and was a group aligned with the [[Emerald Enclave]]. The Emerald Grove was located near the [[River Chionthar]] on the [[Western Heartlands]] and active during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was the home to a [[Druid circle|circle]] of [[druid]]s led by [[Archdruid]] [[Halsin]]. It experienced great turmoil during the early 1490s DR as it was beleaguered by [[goblin]] raids, housed a population of refugees, and was infiltrated by members of the [[Shadow Druids]].

==Geography==
The grove was situated just off the [[Risen Road]], between the cities of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Elturel]], some ways east of [[Moonrise Towers]]. It was north of the [[River Chionthar]].

==Description==
A naturally-occurring stone formation created the outer wall within which the Emerald Grove was constructed. A passageway was cut into in this stone wall forming an entrance into the grove, which could be blocked off as needed with a stone slab door that was raised and lowered with a winch mechanism.

The grove itself comprised three distinct areas, extending deep into the cliffside overlooking the Chionthar. A twisting network of tunnels and caves extended just beyond the outer stone wall known as the ''Hollow''; a circular stone reflecting pool set into the ground just outside the end of the caves was referred to as the ''Sacred Pool''; and a large underground caved, decorated with murals, stone sculptures and banners of the [[Emerald Enclave]] was the ''Emerald Grove'' proper.

===Hollow===
[[File:Hollows.png|thumb|right|300px|''The ''Hollow'', a makeshift home for the [[Elturel|Elturian]] [[tiefling]]s.'']]
The Hollow of the grove was hewn into the stony cliffs overlooking the river, with some passages that were formed naturally and others that were hewn into the rock. The ceiling of these caves were supported by large stone columns and held some openings to let in light from the day's sky. One passageway led into a deep chasm beneath the grove, while another led into the cliffside overlooking the Chionthar. The main passage out of the Hollows formed a circular walkway leading down to the grove's main shrine.

===Sacred Pool===
Just beyond the Hollow was an open-air shrine of Silvanus. Crumbling stone columns encircled a naturally-forming geyser that emptied into a reflecting pool that lay in the shrine's center, decorated with trees, vines, and plants that offered a look that could be defined as "controlled overgrowth". It was here that the druids of the Enclave performed their most powerful [[ritual]]s, using the sacred ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' as their [[focus]].

Wooden walkways led down to a small beach along the river's edge, and a wood-platform elevator granted access to the Hollow above.

===Emerald Grove===
The inner sanctum of the grove was a naturally-formed cave that had been reinforced with stone architecture. Its central chamber served as a gathering room and common area, with living quarters and a library off to its side. Set above an underground freshwater pool from which the geyser arose, the central chamber featured a series of murals that depicted the grove's history; these murals portrayed its founding, the forming of the alliance between the druids and the [[Harpers]], and their defeat of [[Shar]]rans at [[Moonrise Towers]].

[[File:Emerald_Grove_Library.png|thumb|right|300px|''...and its adjoining library.'']]
The library held many [[rune]]-etched stone slabs each roughly the size of a hand-held [[book]]. At the center of the library's shelves was a tall, stylized sculpture with the likeness of a lupine beast, around which stood four pedestals with a depression each for a specific rectangular [[runestone]]. Each runestone corresponded to a totem animal associated with one of the preeminent druids of the grove: the [[bear]], [[wolf]], [[stag]], and [[eagle]]. When the correct runestones were placed in each pedestal, a vibrant blue glow illuminated the stonework in the room and the bestial sculpture descended into the earth, revealing a circular staircase that led down to the enclave's hidden vault.

==Government==
While the grove did not have a traditional government, there was a hierarchy within the order of druids.

==Defenses==
It was set within a cave system, which itself was protected by natural fortifications and a great wooden portcullis.

==History==

Sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1391}}, the predecessor Archdruid and the grove's druids were allied with the [[Harpers]] forces commanded by [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] to thwart the [[Church of Shar|Sharran]] [[Ketheric Thorm]] and his [[Dark Justiciars]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]]. The [[Ketheric Thorm's war|war]] ended with the [[Shadow-cursed Lands|spread of shadows]] around the [[Moonrise Towers]] and the [[Thaniel|cursed]] death of many, including the predecessor Archdruid. [[Halsin]] took over as the next Archdruid and lead the survivors away. For many years to come, the Emerald Grove's druids and the Harpers worked to find a way to fight against the shadow curse and to heal its afflicted lands.

The Emerald Grove was infiltrated by members of the [[Shadow Druids]] during the early 1490s DR. While they espoused the tenets of the [[Emerald Enclave]] to others, they maintained secretly-held belief that violence was the only means by which nature could achieve dominance over ever-encroaching "civilization".

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of [[tiefling]] refugees exiled from the beleaguered city of [[Elturel]] were given permission by Archdruid Halsin to take up temporary residence in the Hollow. When Halsin left the grove for Moonrise Towers, to investigate a [[drow]] that was infected with an [[illithid]] tadpole, Kagha took charge over as leader of of the grove. She immediately took action to remove the tieflings from her home, believing them to be a drain on their resources at a time when [[goblinoid]] raiders were running rampant across the region.

Kagha ordered her fellow druids to begin the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'', a ritual that would obscure the location of the Emerald Grove from outsiders, protecting it from the dangers beyond.

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Druid of the Emerald Grove.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A druid of the Emerald Grove accessing the [[primal magic|powers of nature]].'']]
While the grove held connections with the Emerald Enclave, it was unknown exactly which druids of its circle were members of the expansive organization. The druids of the Emerald Grove were drawn from various races, including [[dwarves]], [[elves]], and [[gnome]]s.

Archdruid [[Halsin]] was served by numerous honest and well-meaning individuals, including the dutiful second [[Rath (druid)|Rath]], a trustworthy and dedicated advisor, and [[Nettie]], a well-meaning but sometimes-misguided apprentice healer. In addition to its [[humanoid]] residents, the grove was home to many animals that each exhibited quirky personality traits to [[speak with animals|those that could understand them]]. Among these were the [[bear]]s [[Ormn]] and [[Tuffet]], and the bluejay [[Topaz (bird)|Topaz]] among others. When Master Halsin went missing in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Kagha]] became the Acting Archdruid.

A potential Archdruid successor was [[Francesca of the High Forest]].
