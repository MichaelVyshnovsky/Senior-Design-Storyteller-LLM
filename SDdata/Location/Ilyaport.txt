Ilyaport was a port town and later fishing village in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn.
It stood on the shore of the Shining Sea, southwest of Ithmong in Ithmong Bay.
Ilyaport was founded sometime around 100 DR, based around a temple to Umberlee known as the Shell House, home to the Green Priests Umberlant order. The settlement flourished, becoming quite a grand town.
However, during the Rage of Wizards in the Year of the Swords Oath, 1142 DR, when rival wizards and yuan-ti engaged in wildly destructive spell-battles up and down the Tashtan Coast, the Shell House was destroyed. Many of the Green Priests died in the collapse, but before it did, the temple was struck by a huge scouring wave that carried away the Umberlant holy relic known as The Orglara. The Umberlants believed this to be "by Arm of the Goddess", that is, sent by the Sea Queen to steal that which she desired.
Without the temple, Ilyaports prosperity ebbed in the shadow of the city of Ithmong. It was just a simple fishing village by the mid–14 century DR.
The civic deity of Ilyaport was Umberlee, the Sea Queen. Even after the fall of her temple, the town was ruled by the highest-ranked Umberlant priest who dwelled there on a permanent basis. Circa 1373 DR, this was Dread Wavelord Dumai Arachneie.
In 1373 DR, Ilyaport was a small town home to 1,923 people.
This small town was most commonly visited by adventurers hoping to find the treasures whispered to still lie unrecovered in the ruins of the Shell House.
The pirates Captain Raurivyl Ornshield and first mate Dreak of the Scimitar of Fire may have had a safehouse hideout in Ilyaport around 1370 DR.
