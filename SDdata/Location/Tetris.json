        "mainbody": "'''Tetris''' was a southernmost island of little note in the [[Korinn Archipelago]] of [[Moonshae Isles]]. It was the furthest to the south among the isle cluster that surrounded [[Pandira]].",
        "Description": "Many considered Tetris to be a small island of little importance. It was rarely named on maps, owing to its size and relative barrenness. The island's main features were its green hills and rocky coastal cliffs.\n\nBy [[1361 DR]], Tetris housed one small village with a port. The village was nothing but a cluster of huts made of [[stone]] and [[thatch]] situated on a river shore. The [[Ffolk]] who dwelt there were friendly and simple people who lived off the sea. The [[human]] inhabitants of Tetris followed ancient seasonal traditions of festivals that celebrated the turning of the seasons, which were long-abandoned on the other islands of the Korinn Archipelago. The spring festival was led by the village's [[druid]] and centered around offering an annual tribute to the river spirits. The villagers and even the human pirates who lived on Tetris gifted the spirits beautiful jewelry, [[gold]]en armbands, torques, and broaches. The tribute was tossed into the river waters. As the tribute was finished, the celebration began in the evening. [[Mead]] flowed, and dancing lasted late into the night, illuminated by large bonfires. [[Reed flute]]s, [[drum]]s, and plaintive [[pipes]] were the common musical instruments used by the Ffolk.",
        "History": "One feature of note, however, was the fact that Tetris held a well-hidden secret base of the [[goblin]] buccaneers known as the [[Sithisila Fleet]] ''circa'' [[1328 DR]]. The goblin fleet acted as both mercenaries, often participating in other factions' naval battles, and as pirates, raiding the weak and vulnerable.\n\nIn 1361 DR, [[Liriel Baenre]] and her [[Rashemi]] companion [[Fyodor]], on board the ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'', briefly visited the Ffolk village and partook in its spring festival.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Hrolf]]: the captain of the [[Ruathym|Ruathen]] pirate ship ''Elfmaid'' ''circa'' 1361 [[DR]] as well as his mate who stayed ashore while Hrolf sailed."
