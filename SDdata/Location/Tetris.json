        "mainbody": "Tetris was a southernmost island of little note in the Korinn Archipelago of Moonshae Isles. It was the furthest to the south among the isle cluster that surrounded Pandira.\nMany considered Tetris to be a small island of little importance. It was rarely named on maps, owing to its size and relative barrenness. The islands main features were its green hills and rocky coastal cliffs.\nBy 1361 DR, Tetris housed one small village with a port. The village was nothing but a cluster of huts made of stone and thatch situated on a river shore. The Ffolk who dwelt there were friendly and simple people who lived off the sea. The human inhabitants of Tetris followed ancient seasonal traditions of festivals that celebrated the turning of the seasons, which were long-abandoned on the other islands of the Korinn Archipelago. The spring festival was led by the villages druid and centered around offering an annual tribute to the river spirits. The villagers and even the human pirates who lived on Tetris gifted the spirits beautiful jewelry, golden armbands, torques, and broaches. The tribute was tossed into the river waters. As the tribute was finished, the celebration began in the evening. Mead flowed, and dancing lasted late into the night, illuminated by large bonfires. Reed flutes, drums, and plaintive pipes were the common musical instruments used by the Ffolk.\nOne feature of note, however, was the fact that Tetris held a well-hidden secret base of the goblin buccaneers known as the Sithisila Fleet circa 1328 DR. The goblin fleet acted as both mercenaries, often participating in other factions naval battles, and as pirates, raiding the weak and vulnerable.\nIn 1361 DR, Liriel Baenre and her Rashemi companion Fyodor, on board the Elfmaid, briefly visited the Ffolk village and partook in its spring festival.\n*Hrolf the captain of the Ruathen pirate ship Elfmaid circa 1361 DR as well as his mate who stayed ashore while Hrolf sailed."
