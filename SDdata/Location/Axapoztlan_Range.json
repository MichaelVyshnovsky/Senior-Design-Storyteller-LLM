        "Description": "The Axapoztlan Range stood to the west from the arable Kultakan land and the savannah later claimed by the Borderlands, the territory of [[New Waterdeep]]. The range protected the coastal region from the hot Sands of Itzcala that occupied the majority of the lands beyond.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|987}}, the event known as [[Rockfire]] took place underneath the [[Trackless Sea]], seemingly severing the [[Underdark]] connection between the continents of Maztica and [[Faer√ªn]]. Following Rockfire, [[dwarves]] emerged in the Sands of Itzcala, eventually becoming known as [[desert dwarves]] of Maztica, and the [[drow]] emerged from the Underdark entrance on the Axapoztlan Range only to eventually become known as the [[Ancient Ones]]."
