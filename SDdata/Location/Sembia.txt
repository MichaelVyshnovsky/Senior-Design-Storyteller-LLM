Sembia was a young country of considerable wealth and prosperity governed by its merchants. It was located on the north-western coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars in central Faerûn, which put it in the path of many trade routes. Although they suffered over a century of subjugation at the hands of the returned Netherese Empire, with only the cities of Urmlaspyr and Daerlun maintaining their independence, they once again became wealthy, independent collection of city-states following the second collapse of the imperial magocracy in 1487 DR.
Sembians were not particularly war-like, preferring to pursue mercantile endeavors and work as mercenaries or adventurers. Their long tradition of commerce and trade unified Sembia during their entire existence, particularly while as a vassal-state of Netheril.
Sembia was fancifully referred to by some cartographers as "The Land Below the Dales," a term that was popular in that region. With the word "Below" being used to imply that the aesthetics, morals, and sensibilities of Sembites were beneath those of the inhabitants of the Dalelands. Another popular term for Sembia was the "Land of Merchants."
From the 10 to 14 centuries, Sembia was governed by the Overmaster, a leader who was elected by the nations merchants council. 
As of the 1359 DR, it was illegal for an individual to receive payment for the removal of a spells effects, if they were that spells caster.
During the latter half of the 14 century, the military of Sembia was supplemented by the personal army of Miklos Selkirk, known as the Silver Ravens.
Sembian vessels were all named after types of coin, like Bicentan Sail, Three Falcons Volant, or Yulthaari Hunter.
A person from Sembia was known as a "Sembite" or a "Semmite". Sembite was used more commonly in the areas north of Sembia and the Dragonreach, whereas Semmite was more common in southern locations. The term "Semmar" was used derisively outside of Sembia to describe ostentatiously wealthy Sembian merchants, but the term fell out of common usage by the 1370s DR.
The people of Sembia were natural traders, haughty and sometimes cutthroat, they thoroughly enjoyed any opportunity to make a deal for power and hold onto what they earn. They religiously observed contract law and always paid their debts, with full interest. As a nation they had a young, aggressive attitude when it came to foreign relations.
Corruption was rampant in Sembian society, so long as it did not interfere with the business at hand. Shady dealings were celebrated, and the nation exhibited a vague racism, turning away outlanders that "looked different" than the lighter-skinned families that had long-established businesses within the realm.
City life dominated the lifestyle of the Semmite people. Their culture was seen as superior to those of other cities from across the Realms.
They did not share the lavish lives of other mercantile nations, such as Amn in the Lands of Intrigue, but its abundant wealth attracted desperate people from across the Realms, usually in the form of secret cabals or villainous cults.
As of the mid-14 century DR, it was known that gnomes living in western Sembia brewed mint ale, which was available throughout the Realms. Sembian cities were among several locations in Faerûn where cooking competitions were commonplace. They usually occurred during feasts or festivals that coincided with local market days. Winners could expect prizes in some cases. Such competitions were used to promote produce vendors that received orders for whatever ingredients were used. Savory pies and sausages were always the most popular items ordered in bulk by eateries, festhalls, nobles estates, and fortresses. Those who won cooking competitions were considered highly desirable hires and were sough after by local and foreign noble houses, regents, fanciful eateries, and other wealthy individuals.
Those fishing in Sembian waters were required to pay the local authorities.
Sembia did not keep a national trade outfit, but sponsored a number of large trading costers such as the Firehands, Iron Throne, Six Coffers Market Priakos and the Seven Suns to move their goods overland to both their own port cities and farther destinations such as Waterdeep to the west or the Moonsea to the north.
The currency of Sembia was considered a common coinage in Faerûn as of the 15 century DR, owing to the far-reaching ambitions of its merchants.
Sembia was originally a colony of distant Chondath, formed around 380 DR with the cities of Chondathan and Chauncelgaunt, which eventually became known as Saerloon and Selgaunt, respectively. The colonies gained independence in 884 DR, following the Battle of the Singing Arrows. The nation Sembia was founded in 913 DR by Rauthauvyr “the Raven”, a human war-leader who gathered and commanded a standing army to police the roads of the fledgling human territory from the Tel-quessir of the Elven Court. He formed a government led by a merchants council, who elected an Overmaster that served 7-year terms.
A civil war was fought in the mid-1370s which weakened Sembia considerably. The Netherese took advantage of the situation and claimed the realm as a free protectorate. By the , the Netherese controlled all of Sembia, and within 20 years had fully consolidated it into their empire.
In the , cracks began to appear in the shroud of darkness that covered Sembia. This was due to the destruction of the Ordulin Maelstrom, which had covered Sembia in darkness since the end of the Twilight War. After the fall of Netheril, Sembia regained its independence and swiftly began building itself back up to the economic power it once was.
*Daerlun This free city state of 40,000 souls gained its independence from the Netherese in 1439 DR due to their long-standing and strong relationship with nearby Cormyr. Rather than become a part of the Forest Nation, the Daerlunians declared themselves a free state. One of its most notable features was a magical 500 (0.2 km) tall curtain wall erected by the Netherese.
*Ordulin Formerly the capital of Sembia, the centrally-located crossroads city of Ordulin was obliterated when a planar rift tore away part of the Shadowfell. The area where the city stood became a swirling black whirlpool of shadow material. A Shadovar citadel on an earthmote hung over the city during the reign of Netheril.
*Saerloon A port city of over 50,000, this city was considered to be the least politically stable of the Sembian cities. It was home to many thieves guilds and demonic cults.
*Selgaunt The large coastal capital, with a population of over 60,000, was governed by merchant lords called the Old Chauncel, comprising the old nobility.
*Urmlaspyr Suffered greatly under the Netherese, the city resisted the Netherese ban on non-Sharran faiths and was brutally punished for its recalcitrance. Conditions improved since the city threw off the Netherese yoke, freedom of religious practice and commercial prosperity returned to the city, largely in thanks to Cormyrs influence.
*Yhaunn Previously a wealthy and celebrated mining-city, Yhaunn was nearly annihilated by the Spellplague when the cliffs towering over the city broke away from the land and were transformed into floating earthmotes. The Netherese rebuilt the city, using the earthmotes to create the citys exclusive Air District in the sky.
*Yuthgalaunt A settlement on Tilbaryns Ride between Ordulin and Yhaunn.
