Citadel Rashturl was a Council Army fortress in the eastern Cloud Peaks of Amn paired with the nearby Citadel Amnur, the two mightiest fortresses in the realm.
Citadel Rashturl was deep in the Cloud Peaks east of Lake Weng, near the source of the Rashturiver. Citadel Amnur lay to the northwest, with the closest settlements being the town of Amnwater to the south and the villages on Lake Weng that included Edive, Ideepton, Shatar, and Minsor Vale. The abandoned mining town of Orlsfall lay to the east across the mountains.
The Citadel was accessed by a narrow mountain pass that included a  long drawbridge that crossed a chasm. The outer walls were functionally  high, with the first  comprised of carved and flattened mountainside. The top 50 feet were made of fitted stone and was 6- thick, topped with a 10-foot-wide walkway. About 700 soldiers and 20 officers were permanently assigned to the fortress, with additional space for another 1,500 troops if needed.
Citadel Rashturl was first built as a log fort in the  in response to a decade of monster incursions, and was upgraded to a stone fortress in 901 DR. The fortress was named after the famous general King Rashturl Torlath, who fought against the Horned Mage in 661 DR. It was periodically abandoned during long periods of peace but was regularly regarrisoned and upgraded as needed.
Citadels Rashturl and Amnur were rebuilt in modern, identical designs shortly before 1350 DR to head off the threat of baatezu and orc armies originating from Dragonspear Castle. Citadel Rashturl came to be held by Commander Reyni Delapond, a famous hero of the First Dragonspear War whose intelligence and charisma made him an extremely effective leader. Under his influence, Citadel Rashturls garrison became highly disciplined and well-trained, counted as the best soldiers in all of Amn. Despite the isolation and hardship of the posting, the Citadel was regarded as a "pearl" of a posting that any soldier would be happy to be assigned to, even higher than the famously popular garrison at Keczulla.
In 1370 DR, the growing number of bandits under Timok the Tusk at Orlsfall threatened to win the attention of Citadel Rashturls patrols.
