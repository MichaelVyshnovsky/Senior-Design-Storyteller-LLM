Many ships sank or were scuttled in the northern harbor and eventually Waterdeeps outcasts created a small community on the wrecked ship hulls. The harbor water was polluted and smelled horribly.\nIn , Mistshore was largely destroyed in a massive fire, with most ships burning down to the waterline and having to be towed out of the harbor to prevent other vessels from running afoul the wreckage. By , most buildings in the neighborhood were still burned and abandoned.\nMistshore was considered so dangerous that the City Watch refused to send patrols into the area.\nCrib\nThis collection of partially sunken ships was the hideout of the crime lord Arowell prior to his death at the hands of Cerest Elenithil. The ships were arranged in a circle with suspended platforms in the center. Arowell sponsored gladiatorial contests to amuse the inhabitants of Mistshore.\nDusk to Dawn\nThis tavern was nothing more than a tent that moved to different locations in Mistshore nightly.\nHearthfire\nThe wretched inhabitants of Mistshore created a permanent firepit on which to cook.\nWaltzing Ferryman\n Sea wraiths kept the inhabitants of Mistshore from approaching this old wreck. It was inhabited by an old spellscarred mage and his friend.\nThe treasure hunter Grinda Garloth lived in a small residence in Mistshore. She often used her apparatus of Kwalish to search for treasure in Deepwater Harbor."
