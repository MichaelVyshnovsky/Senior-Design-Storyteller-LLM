'''Ammarindar''' was an ancient [[dwarven]] kingdom of [[the North]], spanning the [[Greypeak Mountains]] and the region of the [[Northdark]] under the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] south of the [[High Forest]], that dated back to the [[Age of the Proud People]]. It was a smaller realm of the Stout Folk, the sister-nation to the larger Northkingdom of [[Delzoun]]. 

The symbol of Ammarindar was a three-horned crown topped by a trio of four-pointed stars.

==Trade==
Despite its smaller size and lesser influence, the realm was incredibly wealthy. The Ammarindar dwarves mined a sizable amount of the extremely-rare-occurring, natural veins of [[adamantine]] ore from beneath the Greypeaks. and crafted legendary suits of ''[[everbright]]'' [[armor]] from the near-indestructible alloy.

==Relations==
Although the ravaging [[orc]]s of [[the North]] would constantly harass dwarven civilizations, Ammarindar was relatively safe from their onslaughts.

==Notable Locations==
;Geography
* [[Blacktooth Rock]]: Blacktooth Rock was an intersection of tunnels in Ammarindar named for the large black stalactite that looked like a fang biting into the abundant intelligent fungus [[Araumycos]].
* [[Northpeak]]: Northwest of the [[High Gap]] was a series of tunneled-out mountains that served as the kingdom's most prosperous adamantine mines.

;Settlements:
Ammarindar cities were built within large hollowed areas located beneath the mountains and within the [[Underdark]]. These tremendously vast areas allowed for ample room for their gracefully carved spherical buildings, ornate archways, and roads. The overall design made it appear as if the dwarven cities extended right out of the stone walls.
* [[Ammarindar]]: This 15{{th}}-century Northdark city continued the legacy of the kingdom in name alone, as it was the lair of the [[Scoured Legion]] of [[tanarukk]] orcs.
* [[Citadel Yaunoroth]]: Constructed in [[1 DR]] as a southern bulwark against the growing orcish hordes, the ruins of this once-great city were haunted by dwarven [[ghost]]s and other non-corporeal [[undead]].
* [[Splendarrmornn]]: The royal capital of Ammarindar was a spectacular network of caverns, extending out from a central vault that housed the legendary [[Adamantine Palace]].
* [[Unspoken Hall]]: This secret lair was constructed by a cult of evil dwarves founded by [[Balik Blackhand]] who worshiped the [[demon lord]] [[Baphomet]]. They established several hidden ''[[portals]]'' connecting the hall with the [[Iltkazar|Mithral Kingdom]] and the [[Labyrinth]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Shadow Path}}
* [[Xothol]]: This was a college of the arcane, where dwarven mages could develop new [[spell]]s, particularly focused on defending the nation against the [[spellcaster]]s from Netheril.

==History==
The fabled kingdom of the dwarves was founded in {{Yearlink|-4100}},{{Cite web/The Shadow Path: The Unspoken Hall}} a couple of centuries before the farther-reaching Delzoun. While they were quite hostile with the [[drow]] of [[Ched Nasad]] since the founding of the City of Webs in {{Yearlink|-3843}}, the construction of the [[Lowroad]] in {{Yearlink|-3416}} allowed them to trade with the [[arcanist]]s of [[Netheril]].

In {{Yearlink|-2270}}, [[Connar IV|King Connar IV]] led the forces of Ammarindar into the High Forest to defend the [[elves]] from the [[demon]]ic hordes that had been unleashed by the [[fey'ri]] survivors of [[Siluvanede]]. During the battles, the king himself vanquished the [[red dragon|red wyrm]] [[Rithaerosurffel]].

Around {{Yearlink|-2200}} [[Baphomet]]-worshiping cultists of Ammarindar created the [[Labyrinth]], which was later abandoned and taken over by [[baphitaur]]s.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Shadow Path: Labyrinth}}

The year {{Yearlink|-897}} saw the defeat and death of the legendary hero-king [[Olaurin]] at the claws of the [[deep dragon]] [[Erthungaron]].

With growing concern about the increasingly hostile [[Netherese]] [[wizard]]s, [[Azkuldar III|King Azkuldar III]] established the arcane college of [[Xothol]] in {{Yearlink|-550}}. It would serve as an arcane workshop of sorts for the spellcasters of Ammarindar for almost 300 years.

In the same year as the founding of the [[Standing Stone]], in [[1 DR]], the Ammarindar dwarves completed construction on the city of [[Citadel Yaunoroth]], intended to defend their southern reaches from the increasingly aggressive orcs of the North. Although they stood strong, and sacrificed their lives against the ravages of the surface-dwelling orcs, the kingdom fell in [[882 DR]]. When the demons of [[Ascalhorn]] ravaged [[the North]] and set upon Yaunoroth, [[Helmma|Queen Helmma]] and her sister [[Olmma|Princess Olmma]] sacrificed themselves in defense of the dwarfhold, allowing many of their people to flee south to [[Oghrann]]. 

The kingdom was abandoned so quickly that a great wealth of gems, treasure, and the finest weapons and armor were left scattered through its cities and subterranean network of tunnels. This abundance of riches would bandits and human scavengers for years to come, especially from the town of [[Loudwater]]. The adventuring companies of the [[Black Band]], the [[Company of the Horse]] and the [[Company of the Scaled Tail]] all met their end in their search for the riches of the dwarven kingdom. 

The [[tanarukk]] [[Scoured Legion]], led by the [[cambion]] [[Kaanyr Vhok]] of [[Hellgate Keep]] stripped the capital of Splendarrmornn of all its riches in [[1220 DR]], arming themselves with the looted suits of adamantine armor,

Around the turn of the 15{{th}} century DR, an [[ogre]] discovered some of the kingdom's ruins beneath the [[Southwood]], and there established a lair where he came to rule over many local [[goblin]]s. After being slain by [[adventurer]]s a decade later, he became a legendary figure to the descendants of his goblin minions, who believed him to be a [[god]] and dubbed him the "[[Ogre King]]". He was entombed in his old lair, which came to be called the [[Barrow of the Ogre King]], and was venerated into the late 15{{th}} century DR.
