'''Llandrain''' was a small village located on the island of [[Snowdown]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
Llandrain sat between the southern shore of [[Mal Feargal]] and the coast of the [[Sea of Swords]], making it the northernmost settlement in Snowdown. The northern end of [[Snowdown Ride]] began here. The harbor here was dangerous because of hidden coral reefs and frequent raids from [[Northlander]]s.

==Inhabitants==
The village was home to many miners who pulled valuable metals from the nearby [[Andover Heights]]. [[Dwarven]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] hired by [[Amn]] ensured the resources were mined and protected efficiently.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|13}}

Llandrain was also home to the largest population of patriots still loyal to House [[Kendrick]] who despised their Amnian occupiers. The leader of this group was the blacksmith [[Miles Maddoch]].
