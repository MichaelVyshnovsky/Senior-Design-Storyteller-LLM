Llandrain was a small village located on the island of Snowdown within the Moonshae Isles.
Llandrain sat between the southern shore of Mal Feargal and the coast of the Sea of Swords, making it the northernmost settlement in Snowdown. The northern end of Snowdown Ride began here. The harbor here was dangerous because of hidden coral reefs and frequent raids from Northlanders.
The village was home to many miners who pulled valuable metals from the nearby Andover Heights. Dwarven mercenaries hired by Amn ensured the resources were mined and protected efficiently.
Llandrain was also home to the largest population of patriots still loyal to House Kendrick who despised their Amnian occupiers. The leader of this group was the blacksmith Miles Maddoch.
