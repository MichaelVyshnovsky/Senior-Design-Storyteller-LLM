Nimpeth was a city-state located on the southern shore of the Vilhon Reach. It was one of the Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach, which were the largest and most powerful city-states in the region.
Most of Nimpeths city walls and buildings were constructed by slave labor, including the citys seat of power – the Citadel of Carifar. The most impressive achievement of slave labor laid to the citys north, in the Broken Hills. The rugged hills were turned into sprawling agricultural wonder – the Woren Vineyards.
Well-defended slave-nation of Nimpeth.
Nimpeth was founded as a slaver nation in the . Nimpeth quickly became a target for Chondath, withstanding a series of attacks and proving its power against invaders. The hostilities soon ended, and the Illistine family that ruled Chondath became content on using Nimpeth as a source for slaves. Fueled by the profitable slave trade, Nimpeth quickly blossomed into a rich, decadent, and powerful resort city-state of the Vilhon Reach. Arrabar adopted Nimpeths slavery ways soon after as yet another center of power in the Reach.
The Citadel of Carifar, the stone-built governing palace, was built by the citys slaves circa the .
Migrant workers from Nimpeth, among other places, went to join in the construction of the canal that Innarlith was building between the Lake of Steam and the Nagaflow in the mid-1360s DR. This project was widely seen as bringing much lucrative trade to the Lake of Steam region because it would have connected the Sea of Fallen Stars to the oceans of Toril through the Lake of Steam. When Innarliths Ransar Salatis started to find excuses to cut funding for the project, Nimpeth paid for its own workers to continue their work on the site.
Circa the , Marsembian spice trade saw a significant decrease. The cities of Westgate and Nimpeth saw this as an opportunity and picked up slack, sending shipments of precious spice into Cormyr and the Sword Coast.
By the , Nimpeths slavers could be encountered deep in the land of Turmish, following slave shortages and damage done by a recent war. Around the same time, a strange never before seen disease started moving through the inhabitants of the Vilhon Reach. The affliction caused growths of green-white, lichen-like patches and the inability to concentrate nor memorize information. The disease cleared after 2-5 months. The cure was never discovered, however, alchemist Thoround of Nimpeth discovered that the blood and spittle of the diseases victims could be used as ink to scribe scrolls of the forget spell.
In the chaos of Spellplague, slavery collapsed in Nimpeth. By the late 15 century and past the Second Sundering, it never recovered.
