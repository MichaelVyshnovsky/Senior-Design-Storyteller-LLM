'''Darastriverthicha''' ("Dragon Mountain", in [[Draconic language|Draconic]]) was an ancient [[dragon]] kingdom during the [[Dawn Ages]] ({{Yearlink|-30000}} to {{Yearlink|-24000}}). It warred with the [[giant]] kingdoms of the day.<ref> It was ruled by [[Caesinsjach]], a mighty [[green dragon]]. 

Among its vassal states was [[Darastrixhurthi]], a nation of [[kobold]]s ruled by [[Kurtulmak]], located in what is now the [[Shoal of Thirst]].

==History==
During the first [[Rage of Dragons]], circa {{Yearlink|-25000}}, Caesinsjach and her fellow dragons destroyed Darastriverthicha and all its vassal states.
