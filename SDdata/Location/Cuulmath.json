Named after its founding archmage, it joined the other colony of Werapan and together they formed Deep Netheril. The enclaves proceeded to enslave the people of Ser么s, with the locathah being the primary victims, and were violently opposed by the sea elves of Aryselmalyr and other sentient species of the Inner Sea.\nAll three enclaves were destroyed in the Battle of the Three Seaflames in  when the allied High Mages of Ser么s and Dukars of Aryselmalyr, led by Coronal Essyl Merynth, attacked the Netherese oppressors. The battle to remove the crystal domes raged until it was abruptly ended by the High Mages spell that turned the crystal domes into a substance flammable in water. The resultant explosion was directed away from the forces of Ser么s and annihilated the Netherese forces, and carved out Selgaunt Bay."
