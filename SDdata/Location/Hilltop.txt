'''Hilltop''' was a tiny village nestled in the southern foothills of the [[Nether Mountains]] in the [[Silver Marches]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The trail to Hilltop branched off the [[trail between Everlund and Sundabar]], between [[Lhuvenhead]] and [[Jalanthar]], which were the nearest communities. To the east of Hilltop was the village of [[Blumberg]] and far to the west, down the [[River Rauvin]] was [[Everlund]]. It was described as a very inhospitable land due to its cold climate and potential hazards, such as roaming monsters around the area.

==Government==
The area was governed by the elected mayor, [[Veraunt Shuttlescomb]], around the early 1370s DR. Although falling within the boundary of [[Luruar]], it was not one of the signatories of the League of the Silver Marches, being too small.

==History==
The so-called [[Free Towns]] of Hilltop, [[Newfort]], [[Winter Edge]], and others were founded by ex-soldiers of [[Zhentil Keep]] who'd retired in disgust and wished a new life. However, being distrusted by neighboring towns for their origins, they made their own settlements such as these.<ref>

In a particularly cold [[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Hilltop was attacked by a large group of [[kobold]]s. Casualties were relatively light, with only a few militiamen and two civilians killed in exchange for dozens of kobold dead. Neighboring Blumberg was sacked by [[gnoll]]s on the same day as the Hilltop kobold attack. [[Drogan Droganson]], however, the one who could likely do the most to repair the damage to the village, was poisoned in the attack and incapacitated, leaving his eldest apprentice to try and solve everyone's problems. This apprentice would go on to do great things like destroying the [[Netheril|Netherese]] flying city of [[Undrentide]] and defeating the [[Valsharess]] and [[Mephistopheles]].

==Trivia==
Hilltop won second place in the "Communities in Bloom" competition, losing to Blumberg. It is unknown if there were any other entrants.

==Notable Locations==
The main point of interest was Drogan Droganson's adventuring school.

==Notable Inhabitants==
Whilst the town was not of notable size, Drogan's school accommodated many [[adventurer]] students in its time including [[Xanos Messarmos]], [[Mischa Waymeet]] and [[Dorna Trapspringer]], and the one known as [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]].

Merchants in the town included the tavernmaster [[Lodar]] and his chef [[Mara (chef)|Mara]], the blacksmith [[Fiona]], and herbalist [[Farghan]]. The local priest, [[Gilford]], also provided his services to the town.

[[Hol Halstrom]] lived in the village before his corpse was found and his death linked to a self-proclaimed prophet [[Piper]].
