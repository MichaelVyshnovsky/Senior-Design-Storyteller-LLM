The Vishaps Teeth was a landmark located in the High Desert of Zakhara.
It was surely a striking feature. Four immense pyramids of dark granite composed the structure.
Most believed the Vishaps Teeth to be a natural landmark, but there were those who thought they were actually the teeth of a sleeping wingless dragon or vishap.
