        "mainbody": "'''Besilmer''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] realm in the hills of the valley of the [[River Dessarin]]. Its sign was a wheel over a plow.\n\nThe realm extended from the [[Westwood]], through [[Ironford]], and as far east as the [[High Forest]], although in Besilmer's time, the High Forest extended further westward than in [[1368 DR]]. The northern edge of the realm was at the town of [[Hall of Four Ghosts|Caddarak]], which, in 1368 DR, was only survived by [[Darthurn]], and ran west along the hills south of [[Yartar]], to [[Kryptgarden Forest|Tsordvudd]].\n\nAlthough the realm did not survive as of 1368 DR, two of its buildings did: the [[Stone Bridge]] and the [[Halls of the Hunting Axe]].",
        "History": "Besilmer was founded in {{Yearlink|-4420}} by [[Torhild Flametongue]] and his dwarves. They founded the realm above ground, in the belief that while dwarves created mines underground, they would be beleaguered as a race. Besilmer's aim was therefore to form a stable farming community and to prosper in building, inventing and repairs.\n\nBesilmer was attacked each year by [[troll]]s from the [[Evermoors]], but the dwarves fought them off. Because the realm was unfortified, it became an attractive target for creatures such as [[giant]]s and [[wolf|wolves]].\n\nThe underground fortress city of [[Tyar-Besil]] was built around âˆ’4320 DR in response to the constant threat to the overground dwarves and their settlement.\n\nTorhild, the realm's founder, was killed in one-on-one combat with a [[hill giant]] at [[Stone Bridge]], and the realm was plundered by its enemies. The inhabitants fled south to join the [[Fallen Kingdom]], leading to the eventual abandonment of Tyar-Besil by {{Yearlink|-4160}}.\n\nThe [[Halls of the Hunting Axe]] were occupied by dwarves from [[Delzoun]] for around forty years, but in the end, the combination of cold winters, [[orc]]s and wolves proved to be too much for them.\n\nAs of [[1368 DR]], the only parts of Besilmer to remain were the Stone Bridge and the Halls of the Hunting Axe. Besilmer's sign could also be found, on some rocks at [[Ironford]], on the Stone Bridge, and in a few places in the [[Sumber Hills]]."
