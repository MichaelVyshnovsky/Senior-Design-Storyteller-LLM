        "mainbody": "Besilmer was a dwarven realm in the hills of the valley of the River Dessarin. Its sign was a wheel over a plow.\nThe realm extended from the Westwood, through Ironford, and as far east as the High Forest, although in Besilmers time, the High Forest extended further westward than in 1368 DR. The northern edge of the realm was at the town of Caddarak, which, in 1368 DR, was only survived by Darthurn, and ran west along the hills south of Yartar, to Tsordvudd.\nAlthough the realm did not survive as of 1368 DR, two of its buildings did the Stone Bridge and the Halls of the Hunting Axe.\nBesilmer was founded in  by Torhild Flametongue and his dwarves. They founded the realm above ground, in the belief that while dwarves created mines underground, they would be beleaguered as a race. Besilmers aim was therefore to form a stable farming community and to prosper in building, inventing and repairs.\nBesilmer was attacked each year by trolls from the Evermoors, but the dwarves fought them off. Because the realm was unfortified, it became an attractive target for creatures such as giants and wolves.\nThe underground fortress city of Tyar-Besil was built around âˆ’4320 DR in response to the constant threat to the overground dwarves and their settlement.\nTorhild, the realms founder, was killed in one-on-one combat with a hill giant at Stone Bridge, and the realm was plundered by its enemies. The inhabitants fled south to join the Fallen Kingdom, leading to the eventual abandonment of Tyar-Besil by .\nThe Halls of the Hunting Axe were occupied by dwarves from Delzoun for around forty years, but in the end, the combination of cold winters, orcs and wolves proved to be too much for them.\nAs of 1368 DR, the only parts of Besilmer to remain were the Stone Bridge and the Halls of the Hunting Axe. Besilmers sign could also be found, on some rocks at Ironford, on the Stone Bridge, and in a few places in the Sumber Hills."
