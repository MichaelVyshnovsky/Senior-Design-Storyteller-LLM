DrowHook horrors
Buiyrandyn () was a tiny drow settlement in the northern Underdark, beneath the northern Sword Mountains, north of Southkrypt and west of Wyvern Tor
Buiyrandyn was once famous for rejecting Lolth and the other evil drow deities. Besides that it was the birthplace of Qilu√© Veladorn, one of the Seven Sisters. A long time before the 15th century DR, mindflayers destroyed it and since then it was occupied by evil monsters, becoming the lair of a small clan of hook horrors.
