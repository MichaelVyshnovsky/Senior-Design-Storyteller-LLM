        "mainbody": "Dawnside was one of the wards of Tarmalune. It was located to the northwest of the city.\nThis ward was crowded with ostentatiously decorated mansions and ornate coaches, and any building not a mansion was likely to be a club of some sort. Buildings in Dawnside were constantly demolished and rebuilt into more fashionable shapes.\nDawnside was home to newly rich families and individuals, and was the most popular ward of Tarmalune among adventurers."
