        "mainbody": "Nyth was a small city in Thesk.\nIt was once controlled by the independent city-state of Telflamm, but it was a part of Thesk by 1372 DR.\nIt traded with its fellow cities of Thesk and with Telflamm.\nThe city took its name from a creature called a nyth that once haunted the western fringe of the Forest of Lethyr. A cabal of wizards defeated the nyth in a battle that ended with the deaths of all involved. As a result of this, wizards in Nyth were respected but considered to carry great misfortune."
