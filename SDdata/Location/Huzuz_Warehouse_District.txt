The Warehouse District of Huzuz was the center for the storage of goods for many merchants in 1367 DR.
Found within the North Quarter in the northern section of the city
The Warehouse District was bordered in the west by the Merchants District, in the east by the Craft District, and the south by the Central District.
Both the River Road and the Street of the Ajami passed through the Warehouse District.
Guards were present in most of the buildings within the Warehouse District, many of which also lived in separate buildings nearby.
The city watch and mamluks from the Diligent Mamluk Society patrolled the streets of the Warehouse District. Additionally, strange individuals from the Exterminators helped rid the warehouses of elemental vermin.
The Warehouse District bustled with laborers, sailors, and foreign ajamis, making it a rough place to live and work.
