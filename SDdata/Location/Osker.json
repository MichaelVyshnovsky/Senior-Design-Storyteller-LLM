        "mainbody": "'''Osker''' was a [[fish]]ing settlement in eastern [[Aglarond]] on the southern shores of the [[Sea of Dlurg]].",
        "Description": "As of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], Osker was a sleepy town of 700 inhabitants. It was a charming village of steep wooden roofs and aging homes built around a dark-wood clocktower.",
        "Geography": "Osker was built on the Sea of Dlurg and relied on the sea's bountiful [[fish]]. The town's closest neighbors to the west was [[Furthinghome]], and to the east â€“ [[Dlusk]].",
        "Culture": "Osker's [[human]] population wore bright-colored woven [[tunic]]s and [[trousers]], typical for eastern Aglarond. These clothes were commonly embroidered with floral peppers and designed in black thread. Most common jewelry included [[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[ring]]s, [[circlet]]s, [[earring]]s, and [[bracelet]]s.",
        "Notable Locations": "Osker's central clocktower was a creation of the eccentric [[dwarf]] named [[Snorri Rockhammer]] sometime in the early 14{{th}} century DR. The clock itself was a wondrous device of clockwork that rang every 15 minutes and daily, at midday, unleaded a parade of mechanical [[dragon]]s, beats, [[manticore]]s, [[chimera]]s, [[giant]]s, [[unicorn]]s, and [[pegasi]]."
