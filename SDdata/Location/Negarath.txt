Netherese enclave
Negarath was a Netherese enclave whose ruins were explored in 1375 DR by Fox-at-Twilight and a band of adventurers.
Described as a city of madness, the buildings of Negarath looked like they were built upside-down, because the mythallar reversed gravity and the city floated upside down. Doors and other portals were a variety of mismatched shapes, and the buildings were wavy and irregular. There was a massive temple to Mystryl, and another to Amaunator. Only the central arcanist tower was somewhat normal. It narrowed like a pyramid, then widened again where it curled to a hook.
Magical metal lifts throughout the city could be activated by black rods. There were floating beds of velvet, and furniture made of a variety of metals and glass.
There was a wizard enclave beneath the streets, and below that an extensive sewer system and crypt. The enclave included a summoning circle that was protected by helmed horrors. The crypt contained murals of Netherese battles against phaerimm. There were a number of protective wards and glyphs throughout.

Over time, the ruins of Negarath came to lie within a cavern system and its mythallar remained intact. A variety of creatures occupied the ruins, ruled over by ancient enemies of Netheril a sharn named Ruukthalmuramaxamin, and the priest of Demogorgon, Gestal.
After the demise of Gestal and Ruukthalmuramaxamin in the , the halfling Daltyrex Blacksoul, Mistress of the Depths of Madness and favored thrall of the Demon Prince, also known as Slip, claimed ownership of the ruin and the dungeon it contained.
