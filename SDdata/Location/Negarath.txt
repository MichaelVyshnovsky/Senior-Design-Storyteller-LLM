'''Negarath''' was a [[Netherese enclave]] whose ruins were explored in [[1375 DR]] by [[Fox-at-Twilight]] and a band of adventurers.{{Cite digital book/Depths of Madness|?}}

==Architecture==
Described as a city of madness, the buildings of Negarath looked like they were built upside-down, because the [[mythallar]] reversed gravity and the city floated upside down. Doors and other portals were a variety of mismatched shapes, and the buildings were wavy and irregular. There was a massive temple to [[Mystryl]], and another to [[Amaunator]]. Only the central arcanist tower was somewhat normal. It narrowed like a pyramid, then widened again where it curled to a hook.

Magical metal lifts throughout the city could be activated by black rods. There were floating beds of velvet, and furniture made of a variety of metals and glass.

There was a wizard enclave beneath the streets, and below that an extensive sewer system and crypt. The enclave included a summoning circle that was protected by [[Helmed horror|helmed horrors]]. The crypt contained murals of Netherese battles against [[phaerimm]]. There were a number of protective wards and glyphs throughout.

==Notable Locations==
*[[The Sun Temple]]
*[[Spires of the Lady]]
*[[Forge of the Seven Stars]]
*[[High Tower of Negarath|The High Tower]]
*[[The Hive]]
*[[Nocturnal Gardens]]
*[[Nega's Manse]]

==History==
Negarath was founded by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Nega]].

Negarath once captured an [[Mind flayer|illithid]], who wrote about its disgust at the situation in [[Qualith]] on the wall of its cell.

In {{YearlinkName|-339}}, after [[Karsus's Folly]], Nagarath crashed in the [[Plain of Standing Stones]].

Over time, the ruins of Negarath came to lie within a cavern system and its [[mythallar]] remained intact. A variety of creatures occupied the ruins, ruled over by ancient enemies of Netheril: a [[sharn]] named [[Ruukthalmuramaxamin]], and the priest of [[Demogorgon]], [[Gestal]].

After the demise of Gestal and Ruukthalmuramaxamin in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, the [[halfling]] [[Daltyrex Blacksoul]], Mistress of the Depths of Madness and favored thrall of the Demon Prince, also known as Slip, claimed ownership of the ruin and the [[dungeon]] it contained.

==Notable Inhabitants==
*[[Nega]], a Netherese arcanist and the founder of Negarath.
*[[Barze (person)|Barze]], a Netherese arcanist and later a sorcerer-king of his self-titled [[Barze|Kingdom of Barze]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|79}}
