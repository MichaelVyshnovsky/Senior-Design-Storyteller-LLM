'''Kanshu''' was an island located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Kanshu was one among three sizable neighboring islands that did not fall under the jurisdiction of Kozakura but still operated within its sphere of influence. It was found to the north-west of [[Tenmei]].

Kanshu was known for its absence of towering mountains, instead boasting lush forested hills, winding valleys, and a rugged central ridge adorned with wooded slopes. The majority of the island was blanketed by the [[Chijoshi Forest]], with minimal cultivation of farmland. The island's inhabitants derived their sustenance from the bounties of the forest and the ocean. The largest settlement on Kanshu was the town of [[Iewara]], serving as the bustling hub of trade between Kozakura, [[Wa]], and its own lands.

==History==
Throughout history, Kanshu had faced multiple attempts by invaders from foreign lands seeking to establish settlements. However, each time, the resilient people of Kanshu, accompanied by the [[bamboo spirit folk]] and the guardians of the Chijoshi Forest, [[shan sao]], successfully thwarted these intrusions. As a result, Kanshu remained an independent land adorned with dense forests, preserving its autonomy and natural beauty.
