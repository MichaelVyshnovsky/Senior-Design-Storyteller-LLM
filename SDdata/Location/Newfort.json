Trevis took it upon himself to serve as the towns first mayor while Gyreth served as its constable.\nIn the , Newfort and the settlements of Jalanthar and Quaevarr were all terrorized by the barlgura Scauuont, all within the span of a single week.\nBy the time of the War of the Silver Marches in the late 15 century DR, Newfort had become a way station welcoming any travelers to stay the night in safety.\n* Heros Reward, a cozy tavern that stayed in the town for over a century.\n* Narms Exchange, a trading post owned by the Half-orc Deliyra Narm.\n* Shrine of Tempus, the Tempuran shrine erected by the bull-headed, ex-Zhent priest Nargroth.\n* Stauvins Mill, a successful millhouse run by Stauvin Stonebrace, the landowner atop whose land Newfort was originally built.\nBecause Newforts founders both had a strong affiliation with the Zhent armies of the Moonsea, it attracted many people that fled the region following the rise to power of the Zhentarim.\n14 Century\n* Trevis Uhl, Newforts first mayor.\n* Stauvin Stonebrace, a man considered to be the richest in all of Newfort.\n15 Century\n* Delf Dereldar, half-elf tavern owner.\n* Jorok Narm, half-orc constable."
