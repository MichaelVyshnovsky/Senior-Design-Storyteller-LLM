'''Hegruth''' was an island revealed by the [[Spellplague]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Small, remote, and missing from all maps, it served as a hidden meeting spot for [[Thoster]]; a single tower stood on its soil.

==Description==
The island had a beach full of weeds and brine pools, with heaps of gray stone on the sand. There was a single black tower, encrusted with fungi, on the island. A hole at the base of the tower led to a spiral staircase; at the top of the tower, there was a room with a balcony. The room's ceiling was somewhat low.

==History==
The island was revealed by waterline changes after the [[Spellplague]]. Captain Thoster named it and its tower Hegruth, using it for meetings while it was still outside of any maps. It was the abode of the [[kuo-toa]] [[Nogah]] until her death on {{yearlink|1396}}.

==Inhabitants==
