'''Maunator''', also known as '''Sunrest''', was a flying [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] that existed during the [[Golden Age of Netheril]].

==History==
It was disintegrated in {{Yearlink|-1657}} in an accident caused by poorly planned spell research. The spell that led to the enclave's destruction was ''Sunrest sunshock'', a significantly more powerful version of the spell ''[[meteor swarm]]''. 

After its destruction, the abandoned mines of [[Dekanter]] became the premiere site of Netherese arcane research.
