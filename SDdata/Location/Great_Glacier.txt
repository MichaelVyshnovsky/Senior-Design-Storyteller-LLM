The '''Great Glacier''', also called '''Pelvuria''' was a large mass of frozen land in [[northeast Faerûn]].

==History==
The Glacier was created in {{Yearlink|-2550}} when the god [[Ulutiu]] laid himself to rest in his ice barge in the Cold Ocean,<ref group="note">The name of this lost ocean was translated from the writings of a Thayan scholar studying the ruins of [[Hotun-Shûl]]. a favorite inland sea of his. The barge sank soon after and the ''[[Necklace of Ulutiu]]'', an artifact that he wore, encased his body in ice when his divinity had departed to the [[Astral Plane]]. 

The Cold Ocean became completely frozen by the necklace's magic over the next seventy five years then, due to a lack of interference from the [[giant]] kingdom of [[Ostoria]], encroached upon the land as well.<ref> The glacier eventually destroyed the remains of Ostoria (the city of [[Gharreil]] was a testimony to its former existence){{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Frozen Wastes: The Great Glacier}} By the year {{YearlinkName|-2475}},  the Great Glacier had covered the [[Cold Lands]] of [[Vaasa]], [[Damara]], and [[Narfell]] with thick ice, driving out the inhabitants, but the expansion was held in check by the [[Elven High Magic|High Magic]] of the [[elves]] of [[Lethyr]] in {{YearlinkName|-2465}}.

Some rumors credited the extremely old [[gold dragon]] [[Protanther]] the creation of the Glacier, as one of his plans to get rid of the evil from Vaasa. Although there was no absolute proof of this, given Protanther's outstanding [[magic]]al abilities, such a feat was not impossible for him, giving credence to this rumor.

Three thousand years later, in the {{YearlinkName|632}}, the Ice Queen [[Iyraclea]] was granted the power to overcome the High Magic by [[Auril]] and the glacier began to grow larger once more.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1038}}, a slight shift in the rotation of [[Toril]] caused minor changes to weather around the world. In the Cold Lands, the Great Glacier began to melt and retreat, and the lands of Vaasa, Damara, and Narfell became free of ice for the first time in ages.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1227}}, one of the great explorers of Vaasan history, [[Palus Frohm]], set out on an exploration of the Great Glacier that lasted for 20 years. Upon his return, he wrote the definitive guide to arctic regions, 'Blood and Ice: Survival in the Great Glacier'. In the {{YearlinkName|1339}} a distant descendant of Paulus, [[Sharra Frohm]], set out to follow up her ancestors work with a book that would focus on the perilous [[Nakvaligach]] region, which was an area that Palus had been unable to explore fully in his time. Sharra began her solo mission by climbing onto the the Great Glacier approximately 100 miles northeast of the Frozen Forest.

With the death of Iyraclea in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the Glacier began to shrink more quickly. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Glacier had become bordered by vast, muddy bogs fed by streams of meltwater from the retreating ice sheet.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|8}} As it melted, it began to reveal [[chillborn zombie]]-infested ruins&mdash;such as the lost city of [[Vaalathrim]]&mdash;and passages to the monster-infested [[Auril's Teeth#Frostfell|Frostfell]]. The denizens of these places began to plague northern Vaasa and Damara.

==Inhabitants==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Pelvuria hosted several distinct societies in [[Alpuk]], [[Angalpuk]], [[Nakvaligach]], and [[Novularond]]. This included three of the four [[Ulutiun]] peoples: the [[Iulutiun]] people of Alpuk, the [[Angulutiun]] of Angalpuk, and the [[Nakulutiun]] people of Nakvaligach. In addition, [[white dragon]]s and [[frost giant]]s were known to live there.

== Important Locations==
=== Regions===

;[[Alpuk]]:Also called the Central Basin, Alpuk was the largest of the three regions of the Great Glacier. Mostly an open, vast tundra, it also included the Novularond mountains and the Lugalpgotak Sea and the Nakalpgotak Sea within its borders. The Uppuk River formed its northern border, the Tuutsaas Chain in the west, and the Lugsaas Chain in the south and east.
;[[Angalpuk]]:Another tundra basin, Angalpuk was smaller than Alpuk. It was east of Alpuk, separated from it by the Lugsaas Chain, and bordered in the south and east by the Angsaas Chain. Angalpuk was also home to several forests.
;[[Nakvaligach]]:Sometimes called the "Northern Barrens", Nakvaligach was covered in rocky, mounatinous terrain and icy crevasses. It was located north of Alpuk across the Uppuk River. Its western and eastern borders were Tuutsaas Chain and the Angsaas Chain, respectively.

===Mountains===

;The [[Tuutsaas Chain]]:One of the three great mountain chains that form the borders of the Great Glacier, the Tuutsaas Chain is the western border of both Alpuk and Nakvaligach. It meets the Lugsaas Chain in the southwest.
;The [[Lugsaas Chain]]:The longest and tallest of the three mountain chains, the Lugsaas Chain forms the southern border of Alpuk and the Great Glacier.
;The [[Angsaas Chain]]:The eastern border of both the Great Glacier, Angalpuk, and Nakvaligach, it overlooks the plains of [[Sossal]] to the east.
;The [[Novularond]]:A massive mountain range in the northeastern corner of the Alpuk basin, the center of the Glacier.<ref>
; The [[Surykyk Range]]:A small mountain range in south Alpuk.
;The [[Lugalpgotak Range]]:Another small mountain range in Alpuk, the Lugalpgotak Range was situated on the northern shore of the sea of the same name.

===Seas===

;The [[Lugalpgotak Sea]]:The largest body of water in Pelvuria, this inland sea was located in the middle of Alpuk.
;The [[Nakalpgotak Sea]]:The second-largest body of water on the Glacier, it was located in northeastern Alpuk between the Novularond mountains and Nakvaligach.
;The [[Lugotak Sea]]:An inland sea located in western Alpuk.
;The [[Igotak Sea]]:A triangular-shaped sea northeast of the Glacier of Ulutiu, in western Nakvuligach.
;The [[Ahtahqugotak Sea]]:The smallest inland sea in the Glacier, it was located in the [[Ibelgrak Valley]] in south Angalpuk. Notably, it was surrounded by forests.

===Other Locations===

;The [[Glacier of Ulutiu]]:A 1,000 foot high wall of ice covered in glowing runes created by Ulutiu. It was located just north of the Uppuk River in southwestern Nakvaligach.<ref>
;The [[Uppuk River]]:The longest river on the Glacier, it formed most of the boundary between Alpuk and Nakvaligach.
;[[Ibelgrak Valley]]:A forested valley in south Angalpuk, it was avoided by the Angulutiuns despite the abundant wildlife.
;Iyraclea's Castle:Formed from magical ice, it was occupied by [[Zaol]], an outcast [[Angel (astral)|angel]], after the Ice Queen's death.
;Vaalathrim:A lost city, freed from the Glacier by its retreat, full of [[undead]] that feed on the heat given off by the living.

=== Settlements===

*[[Jukum]]
*[[Lilinuk]]

===Portal to the Ruins of Gharreil===
A featureless sheet of ice deep inside a crevice in the Great Glacier marked the entrance to the ruined city of [[Gharreil]]. In shadow and darkness, the ice appeared black, but when directly illuminated by the sun overhead, it appeared bright blue and an inscription was revealed. This inscription was written in a large circle on the smooth ice wall, in characters of the ancient [[Giant language|giant]] tongue.

{{Quote|''The city of Gharreil, seat of the Satrap of the Great Glacier, loyal servant of the Emperor of [[Jhothûn]]. May the qorrash smile upon it and nurture its mighty works, and continue to favor all of Jhothûn. Let no thieves or heretics enter this gate, for both suffer death in this city.''}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Some believed that [[aasimon]] began construction on an [[empyreal citadel]] underneath the ice of the glacier in response to events triggered by the ruins at [[Hellgate Keep]].
