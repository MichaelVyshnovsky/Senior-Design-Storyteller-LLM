        "mainbody": "'''Dojyu''' was the imperial capital of [[Kozakura]]. It was where the Emperor and his court lived and met in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Dojyu was situated on a hill within the central [[Dai Plain]], overlooking the [[Dai River]]. The city, initially envisioned as an administrative hub during Empress Jumei's reign, has significantly expanded beyond its initial boundaries. The city was divided into the Inner CIty and Outer City.\n\nThe Inner City, forming the heart of Dojyu, was divided into four distinct wards, each flanking the Dai River and encased within city walls. These wards collectively represented the city's historical and political core.\n\n* First Ward: Dominated by the Imperial Palace and the Imperial Court buildings, this ward was characterized by its striking red-tiled roofs. It served as the residence for Emperor [[Gonijo]] and the Retired Emperor Gokammu.\n* Second Ward: This ward was the administrative nucleus of the city, housing government buildings and the residences of high officials and nobility.\n* Third Ward: Home to the [[samurai]] and other retainers of the court nobles, this ward was a blend of military and aristocratic presence.\n* Fourth Ward: Initially the commercial hub, it contained shops and businesses catering to the needs of the capital.\n\nAccess to the Inner City was exclusive to two main gateways: the Sunrise Gate facing east and the Sunset Gate facing west. These gates, notable for their size, stone construction, and elaborate decorations, was also the inspiration of the name of the [[Two Gates]] [[yakuza]] gang.\n\nSituated just downriver from the Sunrise Gate was a notable warehouse district. This area was characterized by its array of buildings, many of which show signs of disrepair and neglect. The warehouse district was particularly known for its nocturnal ambiance. After dark, it became a place of shadowy movements, where rough-clad figures were often seen discreetly moving through the area.\n\nSurrounding the Inner City's fortifications, the Outer City comprised of three wards. These areas accommodated the burgeoning demands of the capital, hosting additional services, shops, and residences for the common populace. Notable industries like warehouses, tanners, [[silk]] dyers, and [[sake]] brewers were predominantly located east of the city, along the Dai River.",
        "Government": "The shogunal government of Kozakura operates from its base in [[Gifu]], a location strategically chosen for its advantageous position. The selection of Gifu was influenced significantly by its tactical merits, offering a beneficial setting for the shogunate away from the complexities of the imperial court. Despite the shogunate's base in Gifu, many administrative functions of the government continued to operate out of Dojyu. The presence of the emperor and the availability of state facilities in Dojyu were deemed essential for conducting various governmental activities. This dual-location approach allowed for a balance between the strategic advantages of Gifu and the ceremonial and administrative necessities present in Dojyu.",
        "Society": "Dojyu was a spiritual hub, hosting the three major schools of the [[Way of Enlightenment]]. The city housed the primary temples of these schools:\n* [[Umoroji]]: The seat of the [[Toro-dai]] school, relocated to Dojyu from [[Fukama]] in [[486 DR]].\n* [[Kanchai Temple]]: Established in [[627 DR]] within the Inner City.\n* [[Konjo Temple]]: Founded in [[785 DR]], situated outside the Sunset Gate.\n\nThe city was also the base of the [[Iridescent Peacock Society]], a prominent group with its highest members residing in the Second Ward."
