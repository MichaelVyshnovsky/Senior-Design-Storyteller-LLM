The Westmarket was a large, egg-shaped, open marketplace in western Daerlun, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. It was located on the Street of the Dragon not far from the Sunset Gate out of the city. Saurovin Street also intersected the Westmarket at its southern point and headed southeast. The largest building facing the Westmarket was the popular Mighty Mace inn and tavern on the southeast side.
