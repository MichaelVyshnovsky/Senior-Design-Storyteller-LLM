        "mainbody": "The '''Pearl Cities''' were a group of wealthy [[Zakhara]]n seaports found in [[west Zakhara]].",
        "Geography": "The Cities of the Pearl hugged the coast of the [[Crowded Sea]] and the western shores of the [[Golden Gulf]] in the shadows of the [[High Desert]].",
        "Activities": "These cities–[[Ajayib]], [[Gana]], [[Jumlat]], [[Sikak]], and [[Tajar]]–focused on a lucrative trade mainly in luxury goods, with Jumlat's and Gana's production of [[pearl]]s providing the name for the whole group. Haggling and money-making were as important to the inhabitants as the [[Law of the Loregiver]]. While all Cities of the Pearl featured richly decorated manors of the wealthy, the poor inhabitants were an even more common sight in their streets.",
        "Inhabitants": "Successful merchants here amassed wealth beyond even that of the Caliphs of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] or elsewhere in the Land of Fate. The small population of wealthy merchants was vastly outnumbered by a population of exploited [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] living in poverty. Wealthy Zakharans in the Pearl Cities enjoyed flaunting their success, often holding lavish parties for insignificant reasons. As a whole the people here were said to rival [[genie]]s in their cunning.",
