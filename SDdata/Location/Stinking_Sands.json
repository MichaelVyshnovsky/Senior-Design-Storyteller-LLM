        "mainbody": "The Stinking Sands was a local name for a stretch of beach in the southeastern most corner of the Dock Ward in Waterdeep.\nThis beach was bordered by Dock Street and Deepwater Harbor. Along Dock Street the notable buildings that overlooked it included the Fellowship Warehouse, the Smokehouse, Telethar Leatherworks, a guard barracks, and the East Torch Tower.The map provided of the Dock Ward in City of Splendors Waterdeep notably mislabels the barracks as being on the nearby beach and gives the location where they are supposed to be the designation \"S57,\" which is not used for any building in its index.\nWhen the Laughing Lady sank near Waterdeep in 1372 DR, the caravel was dredged up onto this beach by barges belonging to Raulinvurs Ropehaul and by wizard members of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors."
