Along Dock Street the notable buildings that overlooked it included the [[Fellowship Warehouse]], the [[Smokehouse (Waterdeep)|Smokehouse]], [[Telethar Leatherworks]], a [[Guard Barracks/Dock Ward|guard barracks]], and the [[East Torch Tower]].<ref><ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"error\">The map provided of the Dock Ward in ''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'' notably mislabels the barracks as being on the nearby beach and gives the location where they are supposed to be the designation \"S57,\" which is not used for any building in its index.",
        "History": "When the ''[[Laughing Lady]]'' sank near Waterdeep in [[1372 DR]], the [[caravel]] was dredged up onto this beach by barges belonging to [[Raulinvur's Ropehaul]] and by [[wizard]] members of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]]."
