        "mainbody": "'''Malsheem''', also known as the '''Citadel of Hell''', was an infernal fortress-city found in [[Nessus]] the deepest layer of the [[Nine Hells]]. It was the home of [[Asmodeus]]― the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian god]] of indulgence and lord of the Nine Hells―along with his army of infernal guardians.\n\nAsmodeus' city was not accessible by ''[[teleport]]ation'' and could not be viewed by [[scrying]], unless the [[archdevil]] allowed as such.",
        "Description": {
            "Function": "The city of Malsheem served as a meeting place for the [[Dark Eight]], the generals that commanded the forces of the Hells in the [[Blood War]].\n\nMalsheem also served a second function as a repository for certain [[soul]]s that had Asmodeus deemed noteworthy enough to hide away from others."
        },
        "Geography": "The city-spire of Malsheem was situated within a seemingly bottomless crevasse that split open the center of Nessus,",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that Malsheem was to be the site of an infernal ritual known as [[the Bringing]]. During this rite, [[night hag]]s would provide millions of [[larva|soul larvae]] to the Dark Eight, which would subsequently be outright destroyed in one swoop. It was said this would grant the generals the ultimate power to destroy the [[tanar'ri]] once and for all.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Fortress Nessus]], the desolate yet breathtakingly beautiful palace from which Asmodeus held court.",
        "Inhabitants": "The city was home to the thousands of devils that composed Asmodeus' army. Notable among these infernal shock troops was the legion of 1,001 [[brazen devil]]s, armored guardians that sought no personal glory and only existed to serve the Lord of the Nine. \n\nIt was said that the iteration of Asmodeus encountered in Malsheem was merely his [[avatar]], and the true Lord of the Nine dwelled deeper within Nessus."
