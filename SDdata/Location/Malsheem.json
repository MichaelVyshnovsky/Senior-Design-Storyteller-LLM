        "mainbody": "alsheem, also known as the Citadel of Hell, was an infernal fortress-city found in Nessus the deepest layer of the Nine Hells. It was the home of Asmodeus― the Faerûnian god of indulgence and lord of the Nine Hells―along with his army of infernal guardians.\nAsmodeus city was not accessible by teleportation and could not be viewed by scrying, unless the archdevil allowed as such.\nThe citadel of Malsheem was beyond impressive in design and scope, a design that originated from Asmodeus himself. The fortress constructed from Baatorian green steel, \nThe city was constructed in the form of a colossal stalagmite, with a cross-shaped base that extended for miles along the depths of Nessus. A nearly infinite number of tunnels and passageways extended outward from Malsheem into the surrounding landscape, adjoining infernal garrisons and barracks for Asmodeus army of devils.\nAn oppressive aura of dread permeated the entirety of Malsheem. While it was large enough to house millions upon millions of devils, some areas of the city were entirely uninhabited. These desolate halls held no notable landmarks, and were eerily silent. Even when no sounds were readily apparent, the faint cries of imprisoned souls could be heard as if in whisper.\nThe city of Malsheem served as a meeting place for the Dark Eight, the generals that commanded the forces of the Hells in the Blood War.\nMalsheem also served a second function as a repository for certain souls that had Asmodeus deemed noteworthy enough to hide away from others.\nThe city-spire of Malsheem was situated within a seemingly bottomless crevasse that split open the center of Nessus,\nIt was rumored that Malsheem was to be the site of an infernal ritual known as the Bringing. During this rite, night hags would provide millions of soul larvae to the Dark Eight, which would subsequently be outright destroyed in one swoop. It was said this would grant the generals the ultimate power to destroy the tanarri once and for all.\n* Fortress Nessus, the desolate yet breathtakingly beautiful palace from which Asmodeus held court.\nThe city was home to the thousands of devils that composed Asmodeus army. Notable among these infernal shock troops was the legion of 1,001 brazen devils, armored guardians that sought no personal glory and only existed to serve the Lord of the Nine. \nIt was said that the iteration of Asmodeus encountered in Malsheem was merely his avatar, and the true Lord of the Nine dwelled deeper within Nessus."
