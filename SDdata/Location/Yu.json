        "mainbody": "u was a fishing community and one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa.\nYu was a very poor village, but its people were friendly. As a whole, the people of Yu were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.\nMost of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka, built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\nThe village had a population of about 275 individuals after .\nYu was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima, north of Fochu, off a spur trail from the Hisano Road.\nVillages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya, typically a minor samurai, and Yu was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed. The shoya of Yu after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was Fu Pukiyi, a simple-minded but pleasant fellow.\nThe cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 2 fen. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 2 yuan to sell.\nAbout 28 citizens of Yu served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears.\nUnlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Yu were not particularly religious.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
