        "mainbody": "'''Yu''' was a fishing community and one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].",
        "Description": "Yu was a very poor village, but its people were friendly. As a whole, the people of Yu were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.\n\nMost of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\n\nThe village had a population of about 275 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.",
        "Geography": "Yu was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of [[Tsukishima]], north of [[Fochu]], off a spur trail from the [[Hisano Road]].",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]], and Yu was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed. The ''shoya'' of Yu after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was [[Fu Pukiyi]], a simple-minded but pleasant fellow.",
        "Trade": "The cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 2 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 2 [[yuan]] to sell.",
        "Defenses": "About 28 citizens of Yu served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.",
        "Religion": "Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Yu were not particularly religious.",
        "History": "Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
