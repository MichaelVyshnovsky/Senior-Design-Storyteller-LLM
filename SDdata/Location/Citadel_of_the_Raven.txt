The Citadel of the Raven was a fortress of the Zhentarim that was situated within the Dragonspine Mountains in the western portion of the Moonsea region. The Citadel itself was the main feature of the stronghold, which rested in the center of 10 miles (16 km) of interconnected fortresses on the western end of the Dragonspines. It was a well-fortified and well-protected fortress.
The citadel supported a small community of refugees from Zhentil Keep around its outskirts. This was originally discouraged by the Zhentarim, though they later saw the benefits to controlling such a community.
The Citadel consisted of a 10-mile long string of forts and barracks carved into the side of the Dragonspine Mountains, connected by a series of tunnels, walkways and bridges. In 1367 DR, the following structures made up the whole of the Citadel from west to east
*Point Dusk The westernmost fortress could house 200 soldiers and was haunted by the ghost of Galauntar Hawkhelm.
*Barracks Fortified lodgings for soldiers were scattered along the chain between the forts, and could usually house 200 soldiers each.

Notable inhabitants of the Citadel included

The Citadel of the Raven was thought to date back to , the creation of unknown builders. It was inhabited by local bandits who were wiped out in the the mid-13 century DR by the northward expansion of the Moonsea settlements.
In 1276 DR, at the behest of Zhentil Keep, an alliance of Moonsea city-states was formed to rebuild and garrison the Citadel, with the goal of protecting against threats from the Ride and Thar. Included in this cooperative effort were Zhentil Keep, Yûlash, Melvaunt, Thentia, Hillsfar, Mulmaster, Voonlar, Phlan, and Sulasspryn. As Yûlash was heavily influenced by Zhentil Keep, this gave the Zhents effective control of the complex. The first commander of the Citadel was Galauntar Hawkhelm, a warrior from Hillsfar, and the safety and prosperity brought by the functioning of the citadel attracted adventurers and companies of interested dwarven stonemasons looking for work.
In 1355 DR the Zhentish garrison betrayed its allies of the Moonsea. During a planned orc attack, the non-Zhentish garrison was left stranded outside the fortress, allowing them to easily take complete control of the citadel. In addition to controlling the land around it and the passage of trade, the Citadel was also used for housing political prisoners.
In the Year of the Vindicated Warrior, 1383 DR, during the Shadowbane War the Shadovar moved against Zhentil Keep, and razed the Citadel of the Raven along with it.
In late 1487 DR a few Shadovar survived the fall of Thultanthar, among them the sisters Manarlume Tanthul and Lelavdra Tanthul, and the arcanist Gwelt. They founded the "Court of Three", a society dedicated to saving the surviving Netherese, hidden within one of the more intact towers in the Citadel.
