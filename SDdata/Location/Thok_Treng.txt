Thok Treng was a town in Laothan in Malatra.Maps mark the settlement as "Thak Treng" though this appears to contradict the presence of the Thok clan here.
It lay on Laothans northern coast, on the shore of the Eastern Sea.
This town was where the House of Thok was born—and it remained full of its supporters.
In the mid–14 century DR, Thok Treng enjoyed some small trade concessions, thanks to its connection to the reigning Thok clan, helping it prosper.
At that time, ninja in service to Prince Nuyen Phi of Sayan were assassinating certain persons who might prove problematic to his plans. They made the murders look like accidents, so the authorities were yet to grow suspicious.
