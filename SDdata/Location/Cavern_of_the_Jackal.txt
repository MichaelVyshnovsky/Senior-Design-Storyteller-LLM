The '''Cavern of the Jackal''' was a massive temple dedicated to [[Set]], the Defiler of the Dead within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Location==
The Cavern lay beneath the city of [[Sampranasz]] in western [[Mulhorand]].

==Description==
The natural cavern extended far below the [[Alamber Sea]]. Various tunnels within the cavern were believed to connect to [[Red Haven]] in [[Unther]]. Massive stone colossi with [[jackal]] heads were found at every entrance into the cavern, giving the location its name.

==Inhabitants==
Nearly 1,500 of Set's followers lived within the cave system and horded weapons, armor, and treasures.

==Defenses==
The stone colossi were actually large animated [[stone golem]]s that protected the temple from intrusion.
