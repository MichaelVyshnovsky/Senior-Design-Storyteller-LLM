Winterkeep was a ruin located on the southern tip of the Yal Tengri. East of Winterkeep were the Glittering Spires. 
On the surface, only rubble remained, but the extensive subterranean passageways and chambers remained mostly intact. The royal family and their servants retreated beneath the surface during winter storms as a result these halls were comfortably furnished.
To the Vil Adanrath, Winterkeep was known as "Iket Sotha".
Winterkeep was built as a noblemans estate, in the days of Raumathar. It later became a retreat for the royal family. After the fall of the empire, Winterkeep gradually fell to ruins.
