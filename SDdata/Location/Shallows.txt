Shallows was a settlement on the River Surbrin near the Spine of the World. Its leader was the wizard Withegroo SeianDoo, who had his own tower, a thirty  high stone cylindrical building, from which hung a pennant depicting a pair of hands surrounded by golden stars, on a red background. Its population was around one hundred, of which all the adults were capable of fighting with weapons. The houses were mainly of stone construction with supporting wood.
Shallows came to be when Withegroo built a tower for himself. Noting the relative safety of living beside it, and the trading opportunities it brought, people began to settle around the tower.
In 1370 DR a huge force of orcs and frost giants attacked Shallows during a visit by King Bruenor Battlehammer and the Companions of the Hall, who were able to aid in its defense. Though the orcs ultimately overran and destroyed the town, the Gutbuster Brigade - led by Thibbledorf Pwent and assisted by the dwarven brothers Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder - were able to rescue the Companions of the Hall.
