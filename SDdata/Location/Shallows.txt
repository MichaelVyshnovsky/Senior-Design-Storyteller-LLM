'''Shallows''' was a settlement on the [[River Surbrin]] near the [[Spine of the World]]. Its leader was the wizard [[Withegroo Seian'Doo]], who had his own tower, a thirty {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} high stone cylindrical building, from which hung a pennant depicting a pair of hands surrounded by golden stars, on a red background. Its population was around one hundred, of which all the adults were capable of fighting with weapons. The houses were mainly of stone construction with supporting wood.

==History==
Shallows came to be when Withegroo built a tower for himself. Noting the relative safety of living beside it, and the trading opportunities it brought, people began to settle around the tower.

===Orc attack===
{{main|Battle of Shallows}}
In [[1370 DR]] a huge force of [[orc]]s and [[frost giant]]s attacked Shallows during a visit by King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] and the [[Companions of the Hall]], who were able to aid in its defense. Though the orcs ultimately overran and destroyed the town, the [[Gutbuster Brigade]] - led by [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] and assisted by the dwarven brothers [[Ivan Bouldershoulder|Ivan]] and [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]] - were able to rescue the [[Companions of the Hall]].
