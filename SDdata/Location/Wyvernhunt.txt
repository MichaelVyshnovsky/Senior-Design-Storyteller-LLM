Wyvernhunt was a shepherding community in the western foothills of the Storm Horns mountains of Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Scattered across a high meadow slope were various boulders and tiny stone cottages, some of which no more than walled-up caves. There were some sixteen families in all and the shepherds roamed the landscape with their flock of goats.
There was a deep well, called the Deepwell, that held clean, fresh water. Around it was a market, called the Deepwell Market. Here was hung a bell for buyers at the market, called the Buyers Bell.
From their animals, the folk here produced raw wool and goats milk cheese. When merchants arrived in Wyvernhunt from the High Road and wished to buy, they rung the Buyers Bell and the villagers raced each other down to the market to sell their animals, wool, or cheese.
Nearby on the slopes lay Wyvernhunt Keep, an abandoned brigands stronghold, and several fields up the slope above the hamlet stood Spear Rock, a shrine to Tempus, which was clearly visible. Several copper mines lay further up in the hills once the area was plagued by wyvern aeries, hence the name, but they were rare by the 1360s DR, making the mines safer.
According to local legend, a werewyvern bandit named Black Shaernauba menaced travelers on the road. Supposedly shed murdered Purple Dragons who tried to establish an outpost and people who tried to build inns in the area, but Volothamp Geddarm thought this unlikely, as Cormyrs Purple Dragons and War Wizards wouldnt be deterred by one bandit, even if a werewyvern, if theyd been serious.
