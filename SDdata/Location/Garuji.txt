'''Garuji''' was a town and fortress in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]].

==Description==
The southernmost settlement of the kingdom in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], it stood guard over the [[Trade road (Kuong Kingdom)|trade road]] through the foothills of the [[Himasla Mountains]]. Its garrison patrolled the road and fought with the mountain [[tigbanua buso|buso]], while other strange creatures prowled the surrounding jungle. Perhaps understandably, Priest-King [[Vishnan VII]] struggled to persuade people to settle in the area.
