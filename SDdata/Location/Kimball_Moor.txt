'''Kimball Moor''' was a large moor located on the island of [[Gwynneth]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
Kimball Moor was a windswept coastal plain{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|64}} found along the eastern coast with the [[Trackless Sea]] and [[Corwell Firth]]. It bordered the western end of the [[Llyrath Forest]] to the south and the [[Mere Adammair]] to the southwest. Kimball Moor covered approximately {{SI|600|sq mi|k|long=yes}}.

===Flora and Fauna===
The moor was a heathland covered in [[dwarf-shrub]]s, but was further home to a diverse population of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Each autumn before the first snows, [[displacer beast]]s from the nearby woodlands were known to congregate on the moor for bloody hunts.

==History==
The moor got its name after {{Yearlink|1304}}, when Lord [[Kimball]] established [[Cantrev Graystone]].

==Notable Locations==
The town of [[Graystone]] was located in the southwest section of the moor.
