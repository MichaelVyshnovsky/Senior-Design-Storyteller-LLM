}}The '''Gate of Heaven''' was the central province and heart of the [[Yikarian Empire]] in the [[Land of the Yak-Men]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

==Geography==
The Gate of Heaven sat high atop the southern arm of the mighty [[World Pillar Mountains]] in northeast [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
This province was physically smaller compared to the other seven provinces of the Empire, but it's population was much larger because of the capital city of [[Nathong]]. It towered above the surrounding plateau of the [[Enlightened Ring]]. Despite the extreme altitude, the Gate of Heaven experienced bearable temperatures and a surprisingly long growth season for local flora. Most [[yikarian]]s believed this was in direct correlation to the power of the [[Faceless God]].

==Inhabitants==
The Gate of Heaven was the home of the [[Emperor of the Lotus Throne]] and his [[Lotus Court]], who all resided in the capital.

==Defenses==
The single mountain pass leading into the Gate of Heaven was guarded by 900 elite [[Faceless Guards]].

==Notable Locations==
* Nathong
* [[Temple of the Faceless God]]
