The Gate of Heaven was the central province and heart of the Yikarian Empire in the Land of the Yak-Men in 1367 DR.
The Gate of Heaven sat high atop the southern arm of the mighty World Pillar Mountains in northeast Zakhara.
This province was physically smaller compared to the other seven provinces of the Empire, but its population was much larger because of the capital city of Nathong. It towered above the surrounding plateau of the Enlightened Ring. Despite the extreme altitude, the Gate of Heaven experienced bearable temperatures and a surprisingly long growth season for local flora. Most yikarians believed this was in direct correlation to the power of the Faceless God.
The Gate of Heaven was the home of the Emperor of the Lotus Throne and his Lotus Court, who all resided in the capital.
The single mountain pass leading into the Gate of Heaven was guarded by 900 elite Faceless Guards.
