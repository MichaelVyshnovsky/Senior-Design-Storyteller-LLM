'''Battledale''' was one of the dales in the [[Dalelands]]. Despite its name earned long ago, it was one of the more peaceful vales in the 14th & 15th centuries [[DR]].  Even though Battledale was one of the largest dales, it was also one of the least populated.  

==Geography==
Battledale stretched from the [[Pool of Yeven]] in the west, to Essembra in the north, to [[Hap]] in the east, to the [[River Ashaba]] in the south.

==Society==
Despite the fact there have been many historical battles in the Dale's meadows and fields, not everyone who traveled there were warriors or soldiers. Over the centuries, Battledale has largely been a haven for travelers, adventurers and wandering fighters from throughout all of [[Faerûn]]. On the flip side, those who grew up in Battledale often took on these same vocations and often traveled out of the region and Dalelands as a whole.

Battledale had as diverse a population as any in the Realms, from migrating merchant families of [[Turmish]] to [[Tethyrian]] war refugees.

==Government==
Battledale possessed no formal laws, most disputes were handled between the disagreeing parties. More serious crimes, such as banditry, arson or murder were taken to the Lord of the dale, [[Ilmeth]] as of [[1372 DR]]. However he was under no official obligation to settle any domestic matters.

===Law & Order===
In the case of minor offenses, such as petty theft or vandalism, locals would detain a criminal offender and come to a consensus on what was to be done. This could entail replacing stolen items or reparations in the form of goods such as livestock.

===Defense===
Defense of Battledale was carried out through a combination of local militia composed of farmers and ranchers, hired adventurers found in taverns or traveling the roads and a group of Men-at-arms known as the [[Lord's Men (Battledale)|Lord's Men]]. This group, serving the Lord of Battledale, would respond to monster incursions, raiding parties, bandit attacks and were not capable of staving off much more than that.

==Economy==
Battledale was home to no permanent trading costers but experienced a large influx of traders from [[Kythorn]] to [[Uktar]] to purchase meat, grain, fruit, livestock, wool, cheese and ale. Many of the local farmers would sell their goods or barter them for chores they needed done. Otherwise these goods were sold from the [[Hitching Post]] in Essembra, along with a 10–30% markup.

==History==
The origins of Battledale stemmed from a region pieced together from older, non-united Dales. In [[1030 DR]], [[Aencar Burlisk|Aencar]] became the warlord of Battledale, took on the title of "''Mantled King''" and in [[1038 DR]], began a campaign to unite all of the Dales. Upon his death, the dream of a unified Dalelands went with him.

As of [[1372 DR]], the people of Battledale, especially those of Essembra, were dedicated to battling the [[Drow]] of Cormanthor. The most dangerous of these dark elves, were those who came from [[House Jaelre]].

On 7 [[Eleasis]] [[1373 DR]], the [[red dragon]] [[Thraxata]] started many fires in Battledale, causing a large amount of woodland to be destroyed.{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|71}}  

In 1422 DR Battledale came under attack from [[Sembia|Sembians]] allied with [[Netheril]] which forced evacuation of Essembra.

==Geographical Features==
Battledale featured a variety of locales from dense forests, to serene rolling hills and pastureland. The main pathway through the dale was [[Rauthauvyr's Road]], a highway than spanned from [[Hillsfar]] to [[Ordulin]].

* [[Haptooth Hill]]: This small [[granite]] hill featured a subterranean stronghold that has since been abandoned by the Drow, and a [[Dracando's tower|wizard's tower]] that was also unoccupied as of 1372 DR.

===Open lands===
*[[The Belt]]: This open, rolling farmland consisted of short-walled orchards, fenced farms and grazing lands dotted with small cottages, streams and ponds rich with fish life and shrines to the nature deities [[Chauntea]] and [[Silvanus]].

*Three Rivers Land: This fertile delta was the region where the [[Semberflow]] and [[Glaemril]] rivers joined the River Ashaba northwest of Pool of Yeven. They had a sparse [[humanoid]] population, due in large part to the number of [[magical beast]]s such as [[owlbear]]s and [[lycanthrope]]s.

===Forests===
*[[Yevenwood]]: The ancient forest, of many names, was rich in game and had few predators, magical or otherwise. It was noted for being abundant in the edible mushroom known as ''[[relshar]]''.

== Important locations ==
===Cities===
; [[Essembra]]: The large town of Essembra was the unofficial capital of Battledale, until [[1422 DR]], even though it was located 30 miles north of open land and Lord Ilmeth had little authority over the area. Inside the great walled courtyard were 50 or so buildings, including homes, shops, taverns, a government building and a [[House of Gond (Essembra)|temple]] of [[Gond]].

; [[Hap]]: A small village consisted of a dozen buildings, including several services, a small contingent of guards and a shrine to the deity [[Lathander]].

===Buildings===
; [[Abbey of the Sword]]: This temple, dedicated to the deity [[Tempus]], was built over the location where the god physically manifested on [[Toril]] during the [[Time of Troubles]].

; [[Aencar's Manor]]: While appearing as a splendid estate, this former home of a warlord located off of Rauthauvyr's Road was unmistakably haunted.

; '''[[Ghost Holds]]''': These ruined estates were typically overgrown and left to elements after abandonment by their previous owners. With the attention of most of the Battledalesmen focused on remaining vigilant against the Drow of [[Cormanthor]], bandits could often hole up in the remains for days unnoticed.

; [[House of Gond (Essembra)|House of Gond]]: This temple dedicated to [[Gond|the Wonderbringer]] was run by Lord High Smith and [[Artificer]] [[Gulmarin Reldacap]].

; [[Ilmeth's Manor]]: This moated keep was located within the [[Battle Court]], the walled portion on the eastern side of Eessembra. it served as the personal home of the Dale's lord.
