'''Ravensburg''' was the capital and largest city of the Duchy of [[Carmathan]] in the Kingdom of [[Damara]]. In its capacity as the ducal seat, it was sometimes called '''Ravensrock'''.

==Description==
The city served as a massive hub for the exporting of agricultural goods grown in the hugely productive fields of Carmathan. Long, squat warehouses in which the produce was stored were spread out for miles around the city center.

==Geography==
Ravensburg lay in the southeast of Carmathan along the [[Sidewinder River]] at the base of the [[Earthspur Mountains]], not far north of the [[Earthwood]] forest. It sat on the [[King's Road]], connecting it to the [[Arcatan]] capital city of [[Valls]] to the west and to the cities of [[Zarach]], [[Praka]], and ultimately the capital of Damara, [[Heliogabalus]], to the east and north. The road of [[Dormythyrr's Ride]] connected the city to the [[Brandiar]] capital city of [[Goliad]] to the north.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Government==
As the seat of the duke of Carmathan, the city was ruled directly by the [[Devlin (family)|Devlin family]] and their ducal court. Following the end of the [[Bloodstone Wars]] of [[1359 DR]], the ruling duke was the widely unpopular [[Theodorus Devlin|Helmont the 15th]].

==Trade==
In addition to serving as the primary trade hub for Carmathan's food exports, the city specialized in farming-adjacent businesses. Craftsfolk specializing in agricultural [[leather]] and [[metal]] goods comprised a bulk of the city's own trade, and each spring the city hosted a market for the famous [[Carmathan Red|Carmathan Horse-Ox]], a massive breed of [[horse]] perfect for pulling plows.

==History==
Ravensburg was the first settlement of what would become Damara. who arrived shortly after the [[Great Glacier]] began its retreat from the region in the {{YearlinkName|1038}}. It was the original home not only of the noble Devlin family, but also of [[Feldrin Bloodfeathers]], who would become the first King of Damara in the {{YearlinkName|1075}}.

Following the conquest of Damara by [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Ravensburg became inundated with propaganda spread by the new duke, Zhengyi's puppet [[Dashard Devlin]]. Even after Dashard's death in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] two years later, At the same time, questions had arisen about the legitimacy of the current duke, Dashard's self-proclaimed long-lost brother [[Theodorus Devlin]], and the city played host to [[monk]]s of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] investigating the duke's genealogy.
