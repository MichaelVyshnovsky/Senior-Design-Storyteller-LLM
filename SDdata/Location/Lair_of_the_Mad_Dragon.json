        "mainbody": "he Lair of the Mad Dragon was the name given to the network of caverns located beneath the Sanatorium of Helms Hold on the Sword Coast North. They served as the lair of the mad green dragon Chartilifax, protector of the Hex Locus and servant of the Prophet Rohini.\nThe walls and floors of the caves were unnatural in appearance, as if they were formed from stone that had been recently mined. Much of the dragons lair resembled a swamp, with streams of blood-colored saltwater than flowed up the rocky walls and warped plant life that was alien to underground terrain.\nThe cave walls were illuminated by luminescent rock formations,\nChartilifaxs lair was located beneath the Sanatorium of the Cathedral of Helm in Helms Hold.It could be accessed by the lower dungeons that lay beneath the cathedrals underground crypts.\nWarped trees grew within the Lair of the Mad Dragon, forming at angles that were not typically found among natural plant life. \nDuring the Siege of Helms Hold, just following the downfall of the Prophet Rohini in the , the Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge ventured into the catacombs beneath the Cathedral of Helm into the Lair of the Mad Dragon. They massacred the scattered Ashmadai cultists that lingered within, and put an end to Chartilifaxs madness and slew him as well.\nThe plaguechanged Chartilifax roamed his caverns in his humanoid form, taking on the appearance of a green elf. While he would cautiously observe anyone while under this guise, it was only a matter of time before he transformed into his true draconic form and demonstrate how his caverns were ideal hunting grounds for a green dragon.\nThere was at least one mimic that dwelled within a rocky alcove hidden behind a collapsible cavern wall."
