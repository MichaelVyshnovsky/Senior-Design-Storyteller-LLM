        "History": "In [[1482 DR]], the hand of this statue, as well as others, was removed. [[Rilsa Rael]] had experienced thieves take them, whilst youths of a handful of patriar families vandalized the [[Beloved Ranger]] statue. All but those of the [[Outer City]] were angered, and the [[Flaming Fist]] conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up. [[Horgold Hadru]] took in the noble youths who had actually vandalised the Beloved Ranger, as he owed one of the patriar families a favor."
