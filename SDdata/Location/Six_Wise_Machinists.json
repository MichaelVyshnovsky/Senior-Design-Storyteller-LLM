        "mainbody": "The Six Wise Machinists was a statue in the Temples District of Baldurs Gate.\nThe statue was in the Upper City, close to the High House of Wonders.\nIn 1482 DR, the hand of this statue, as well as others, was removed. Rilsa Rael had experienced thieves take them, whilst youths of a handful of patriar families vandalized the Beloved Ranger statue. All but those of the Outer City were angered, and the Flaming Fist conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up. Horgold Hadru took in the noble youths who had actually vandalised the Beloved Ranger, as he owed one of the patriar families a favor."
