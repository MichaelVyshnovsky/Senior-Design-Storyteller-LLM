'''Eaerlann''' was a powerful [[elf|elven]] kingdom in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] and a portion of the eastern [[High Forest]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].

==History==
It was founded by [[Sharrven]] nobles in {{Yearlink|-4700}} and lasted for around six thousand years. Together with Sharrven, it suppressed the spread of evil in [[Siluvanede]] and maintained the peace. Their land was bound by the eastern part of the High Forest from [[Turnstone Pass]] in the north to the [[Shining Falls]] in the south.

In {{Yearlink|-3830}}, Eaerlanni elves began to teach their [[magic]] to the humans of [[Netheril]], which birthed their obsession with arcane magic.

In the {{yearlinkName|882}}, the combination of the [[demon]]ic invasion that spilled forth from [[Ascalhorn]], the continued assault of the [[orc]] hordes, and the weakening of the kingdom by elves [[retreat]]ing to [[Evermeet]] resulted in the kingdom's collapse.

===Legacy===
After the collapse, some of the elves of Eaerlann joined with [[dwarves]] and [[humans]] to form the [[Fallen Kingdom]].

By the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], all that remained of the kingdom of Eaerlann was a crumbling old road and a ruined port.

The [[Caerilcarn|Council of the Wood, or Caerilcarn,]] was a group of wood elf elders and moon elf nobles who shared a common dream of raising a new Eaerlann, a dream that was slowly coming to fruition in 1370s DR. Through the group's efforts, the settlement of [[Tall Trees]] (the ancient site of the kingdom's capital) was built and the new settlements of [[Reitheillaethor]] and [[Nordahaeril]] were founded. The Caerilcarn also cooperated with the army of Evermeet during the [[fey'ri]] invasion lead by [[Sarya Dlardrageth]], successfully massing an army of wood elves at the [[Lost Peaks]] and breaking Sarya's pursuing orcish forces. The Caerilcarn was headed by [[Morgwais]], the Lady of the Wood, and was led by its spokesman [[Yrind Morninglight]].

==Description==
The Eaerlanni elves made their homes by hollowing out selected trees and connecting them with lavish yet conventional [[rope]] bridges and platforms, striving to live with their surroundings instead of atop them. Because of this, many of their settlements did not withstand the passage of time, though some traces remained. In each of Eaerlann's settlements was at least one tree-building dedicated to the [[Seldarine]].
