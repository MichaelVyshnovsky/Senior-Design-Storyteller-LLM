Azun was a small town found in Okoth.
The town was found along the western shore of Azulduth, the Lake of Salt, in southeast Faerûn.
Azun served as a waystop for caravans traveling between the Council Hills to Durpar and the Shining Lands. Plenty of merchants from Durpar also passed through the town on their way toward the lands along the coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Many of Azuns residents earned a living by fishing the Lake of Salt and mining the salt flats nearby.
