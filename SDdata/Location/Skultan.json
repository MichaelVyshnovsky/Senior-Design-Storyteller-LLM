        "mainbody": "kultan was a village near Daerlun in Sembia, circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nThis village was a short distance north of the Way of the Manticore, east of Daerlun.\nSkultan was among the gnome settlements linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists.\nSkultan was known as a place where illicitly acquired goods could be fenced, coins could be exchanged between Cormyrean and Sembian currencies, and equipment could be repaired. Wagons, horses, and other trade-related items were bought and sold here in rapid fashion with no questions asked.\nTwo locations for underhanded dealings, The Tumbling Goblets and The Winking Wemic, were gnome-run festhalls staffed with attractive human females.\nIt was rumored that the Purple Dragons of Cormyr looked the other way when it came to back-door transactions at the festhalls, accepting bribes in the form of discounted \"services\" from those establishments."
