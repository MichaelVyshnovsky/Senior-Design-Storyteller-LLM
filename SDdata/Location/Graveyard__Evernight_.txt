'''The Graveyard''' was a sprawling burial ground in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]].

==Description==
[[File:Ghoul - DAVE ALLSOP.png|thumb|''A ghoul prepares a grave for a "funeral".'']]
The vast Graveyard was littered with graves&mdash;ranging from simple earthen mounds to tombstones to mausoleums to deep pits filled with [[coffin]]s&mdash;and forbidding [[marble]] and [[granite]] statues of watchful [[angel]]s, [[devil]]s, and [[gargoyle]]s. The cries and howls of dangerous creatures echoed through the area.

While the Graveyard was sometimes used to bury one of Evernight's [[undead]] inhabitants if they were destroyed or slain, its main function was to host "[[Funeral (Evernight)|funerals]]" in which living victims were ritualistically buried alive to later be eaten.

==Geography==
It was located in the south of the city. It occupied the same place as did the [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath Graveyard]] in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Material Plane]].

==History==
As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and her [[Thayan]] forces were making use of the [[shadow crossing (Evernight)|shadow crossing]] in Neverdeath to infiltrate Neverwinter, and the [[Netheril#Returned_Netheril|Netherese]] forces who opposed her sought to disrupt this operation. Around the same time, a number of [[Shadar-kai (Netherese)|Netherese shadar-kai]] could be found patrolling the Graveyard.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Dolindar Tomb]], the resting place for the living [[Dolindar]] family that was once banished to Evernight.
* A gate leading into Evernight proper that was guarded by [[Arkwright|Gatekeeper Arkwright]].
