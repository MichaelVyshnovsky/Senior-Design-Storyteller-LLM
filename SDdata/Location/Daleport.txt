Daleport was a tiny village situated in the Barony of Polten on the border with the Barony of Morov where the Icelace River met Lake Mogador.
Daleport existed because its clever founders realized that caravans needed a safer way to cross between the two baronies. Before the founding of Daleport, all of the other roads within the area passed directly through dangerous bogs. Caravans often traveled out of their way to make the crossing in Daleport because of the safety and security it provided.
The inhabitants of Daleport spent most nights enjoying each others company in a massive tavern called the Barge House.
