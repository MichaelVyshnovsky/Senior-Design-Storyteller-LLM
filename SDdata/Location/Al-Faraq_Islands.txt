'''Al-Faraq Islands''' were a large archipelago found near the center of the [[Crowded Sea]] within [[interior Zakhara]].

==Geography==
The northern reach of the archipelago was found approximately {{SI|30|mi|k|long=yes}} off the coast of the [[Cities of the Pantheon]] and the town of [[Fanus]]. The islands stretched southeast from there into the Crowded Sea for another {{SI|180|mi|k|long=yes}}. A smaller arm of the archipelago also ran parallel to the southwest coast of the Cities of the Pantheon.

Seventeen individual islands were part of the archipelago. The [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] named some of these uninhabited islands as listed below:

* [[Sarir Island]]
* [[Mushir Island]]
* [[Latif Island]]
* [[Jasim Island]]
