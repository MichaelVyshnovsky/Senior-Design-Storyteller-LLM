        "mainbody": "The Trielta Hills laid to the north-east of Triel and north-west of Hardbuckler in the Western Heartlands\nThe Trielta Hills was an area of pastoral and idyllic rolling hills, spotted with rocky outcroppings, tiny farming settlements, shallow close-to-the-surface \"scratch mines,\" and an occasional fortified hold. The hills were crossed by a lesser-used northern winding branch of the Dusk Road.\nThe hills were among locations linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists.\nThey were home to many communities of rock gnomes as well as three communities of orcs by 1492 DR. When words of such veins spread, it attracted dozens of adventurers and fortune-seekers who were seen as a blight by the locals. Because of the small volume of these mining discoveries, no nation or trade consortium cared to claim the land or set up large-scale mining operations.\nDespite the idyllic nature, the Trielta Hills still had some danger. The rumors and news of precious metals attracted small-time crooks and thieves to the area, and of course, there were hungry monsters found in the hills.\nThere were no rumors of lost kingdoms, wizards towers, ruined holds or any such thing about the Trielta Hills, making them almost unique for their normality.\nSometime circa the , a collection of lizardfolk tribes called Kalran, based out of the Serpent Hills, attacked the rock gnome settlements in the Trielta Hills.  The surviving gnomes, fearing further invasion, fled their homes.\nDuring the Return of the Archwizards of the , the last three free of the deadly phaerimm came from the Trielta Hills, leading a force of hobgoblins and illithids towards Evereska.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the Trielta Hills were still peaceful with an occasional spout of trouble. One band of marauding lizardfolk was found in the area, who took a gnomish family hostage. But the crisis was averted by a local halfling sheriff and a band of local militia.\nIn the , the growing power of the Cult of the Absolute planned on co-opting the orcs of the Trielta Hills into their ranks. Agent Mhoss, True Soul 26, was set to the Ringfork Stronghold but was dismembered by the strongholds ruler â€“ Lord Heradd as the simple negotiation attempts were seen as a sign of weakness by orcs. The second recruitment attempt was sending Sir Yax of Scornubel, another True Soul, who was intimately familiar with the orcish culture. Sir Yax was accompanied by two orges and issued a challenge to Lord Heradd, using the death of True Soul 26 as an excuse. Yax was to defeat the orc ruler and force him to swear allegiance to the Absolute in return, the cult was planning on offering Heradd help in subjugating the other two orcish tribes in the Trielta Hills.\n*Renkilks Cranny, a cavern complex close to the southern edge of the Trielta Hills, once inhabited by ogres, but taken over by the Church of Shar in the late 14 century DR.\n*Ringfork Stronghold, the orcish stronghold led by Lord Heradd circa 1492 DR."
