{{Quote|We want to be stayin' clear o' them hills. Forces out o' Darkhold stomp all about there. The whole region's no more than rocky upland full o' hidden valleys and dense groves o' trees. Plenty o' places fer us to be ambushed.|[[Lorrick]] to his traveling companions.}}

==Geography==
The area was a region of rocky hills, hidden valleys and thick strands of trees. The Far Hills formed the eastern border of [[Sunset Vale]]. [[Darkhold]]'s control over the region is all but absolute.
