        "mainbody": "Svardborg was a frost giant fortress built atop an iceberg in the Sea of Moving Ice. After Ordning of the giants was destroyed, it came under the control of Jarl Storvald as he sought to increase the standing of his kin by bringing about the Age of Everlasting Ice on Toril. \nIt was a completely isolated settlement situated on top of an ice formation that closely resembled the hundreds that surrounded it.\nThe fortress comprised a number of old frost giant hunting lodges, arranged in a circle around a central peak of ice. \nOne of the recovered lodges served as a home for the Jarl, another as a barracks for the frost giants,  while the temple of Thrym housed a white dragon.\nWhile the fortress was protected by over a dozen frost giants there were no structural defenses. The giants believed its remote location precluded its discovery. \nDuring the age of Ostoria, Svardborg was an isolated frost giant hunting village. When the giant empire fell, the berg on which the settlement was built floated north into the Sea of Moving Ice. The settlement became covered in ice due to the freezing temperatures of the far north. \nSome time later, the mated pair of white dragons, Cryovain and Isendraug formed their lair and accompanying nest within Svardborgs temple.\nAfter the destruction of the Ordning by Annam All-Father, Jarl Storvald sailed to Svardborg aboard the Krigvind and reclaimed the home of his ancestors. He planned to use the settlement as a base from which he could recover the Ice that Never Melts.\nJust after the giants reclaimed the village, they found a clutch of eggs left by the pair. The giants blackmailed the dragons into servitude, and locked up Isendraug in Svardborg and bound Cryovain to the Krigvind.\n* Temple of Thrym The giants place of worship featured a massive ice-sculpture of the titan Thrym.  \nIn addition to its frost giants residents, Svardborg housed their giant owl and winter wolf pets, along with the northlanders, yetis and the white dragon they kept as slaves. \n* The frost giant Jarl Storvald\n* The mated white dragons Isendraug\n* The Zhentarim mage Nilraun Dhaerlost"
