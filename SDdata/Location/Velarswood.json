        "mainbody": "Velarswood (also known as Velarwood) was a forest near the center of Harrowdale in the Dalelands.\nThe north of the wood contained a temple to Eilistraee, which was guarded by a number of drow.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the wood was inhabited by bonebats, cloakers, stirges, and trolls, as well as more formidable creatures.\nMore than fifty Eilistraeeans lived and worshiped in Velarswood, both drow and other elves, in the Shadowtop Glade shrine. They often gathered in evensong in gratitude. They were creating a surface home there and generally had good relations with local humans, whom they aided when ill.\nThere was also a number of werewolves in the area. As a general rule, followers of Eilistraee befriended the moon-worshiping lycanthropes, and even celebrated sacred hunts in honor of Eilistraee and Sel√ªne alongside them. However, a specific group of Eilistraeeans in Velarswood was known to frequently hunt the lycanthropes, which they considered to be abominations and dangerous for the inhabitants of the area. In fact, those Eilistraeeans hung the lycanthrope heads on a trophy tree.\n* Uluyara, a drow priestess of Eilistraee\n* Feliane, an elven priestess of Eilistraee\n* Breen, a drow missionary for Eilistraee\n* Yarno, a young werewolf living with his grandfather (also a werewolf) circa 1373 DR."
