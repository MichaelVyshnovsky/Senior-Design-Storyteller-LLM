        "mainbody": "ielikkis Garden was the forest on the eastern side of Iligh√¥n, an island off the coast of the Vilhon Reach.\nMielikkis Garden was a thick oak forest on the islands eastern side. It was bordered by the Elder River to the west and Hierophant trail to the south. A large treant gathering, the \"village\" of Archentree, stood in Mielikkis Garden on the eastern shores of the Elder River. Sages debated whether it was treants who seeded the forest with its abundant oaks or if it were the oaks that attracted the treants. Another settlement in Mielikkis Garden was the islands port city, Sapra, nestled on the border with the Great Forest at the base of the Hierophant trail.\nSquirrels were among the forests inhabitants."
