        "mainbody": "'''Skyclave''' was a city contained predominantly within a huge, hollow tower approximately a mile (1.6 kilometers) in height. It was the capital of [[High Imaskar]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": {
            "Exterior": "Protruding from the vast and imposing tower were hundreds of windows, spires, balconies, verandas, staircases, and doorways. The lowest balconies were over {{SI|200|feet|long=yes}} above the ground.\n\nThe base of the tower was surrounded by farms, fisheries, and other industries that provided for the city.",
            "Interior": "The inside of the hollow tower was magically bigger than the outside. It was filled with galleries that seemed to go on endlessly and which contained shops, inns, theaters, libraries, and other interesting sites. Some levels of the tower were abandoned and inhabited only by magical lights and plant-like growths."
        },
        "Geography": "Scyclave was located on an inlet off the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the broken land of [[Mulhorand]], known as High Imaskar for much of the 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Government": "Skyclave was the seat of High Imaskar's ruler, Empress [[Ususi Manaallin]], as well as its [[Body of Artificers, Planners, and Apprehenders]].\n\nThe city's nonmagical and nonmilitary day-to-day needs and provisioning were overseen by a \"mayor\" known as Lord Planner [[Yanay]].\n\nScyclave also hosted a political faction known as the [[Collectors]], who were responsible for the acquisition of knowledge and resources from outside the city.",
        "Trade": "As of 1479 DR, Scyclave had few visitors and little trade with the outside world aside from the occasional ship arriving from the Sea of Fallen Stars to exchange goods.",
        "Defenses": "A military force called the [[Vengeance Riders]] stabled their [[redwing]]s in magnificent roosts on balconies near the top of the tower. A patrol of at least four mounted redwings would constantly circle the tower.",
        "History": "The tower was erected sometime following the devastation of the [[Spellplague]] of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, when the descendants of the ancient [[Imaskar]]i emerged to reclaim the shattered land of Mulhorand for their own.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a cell of [[devil]] worshipers led by a self-proclaimed \"child of [[Mephistopheles]]\" known as the [[Son of the Eighth]] was active somewhere within Skyclave despite efforts by the Empress to have them eliminated. However, all of her agents had either failed to find them or had failed to return alive.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Academy of Imaskar]], a school of [[mage|wizardry]].\n* [[Ayar's Table]], a tavern that served [[mushroom ale]] and other fare common in [[Deep Imaskar]].\n* [[Edge (tavern)|The Edge]], a tavern that occupied several balconies on the outside of Skyclave. The establishment was famed for its views.\n* [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]], a partly-restored magically mobile palace from which Empress Ususi ruled which had been relocated into Scyclave.",
        "Inhabitants": "In 1479 DR, Skyclave was inhabited by both nobles and commonfolk of High Imaskar. At this time, the city was home to more than half of the High Imaskar's total population, of whom half lived within the tower and the other half around its base. The inhabitants were predominantly [[human]]s descended from the [[Deep Imaskari]]."
