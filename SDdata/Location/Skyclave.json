        "mainbody": "kyclave was a city contained predominantly within a huge, hollow tower approximately a mile (1.6 kilometers) in height. It was the capital of High Imaskar in the 15 century DR.\nProtruding from the vast and imposing tower were hundreds of windows, spires, balconies, verandas, staircases, and doorways. The lowest balconies were over  above the ground.\nThe base of the tower was surrounded by farms, fisheries, and other industries that provided for the city. \nThe inside of the hollow tower was magically bigger than the outside. It was filled with galleries that seemed to go on endlessly and which contained shops, inns, theaters, libraries, and other interesting sites. Some levels of the tower were abandoned and inhabited only by magical lights and plant-like growths. \nScyclave was located on an inlet off the Sea of Fallen Stars in the broken land of Mulhorand, known as High Imaskar for much of the 15 century DR.\nSkyclave was the seat of High Imaskars ruler, Empress Ususi Manaallin, as well as its Body of Artificers, Planners, and Apprehenders.\nThe citys nonmagical and nonmilitary day-to-day needs and provisioning were overseen by a \"mayor\" known as Lord Planner Yanay.\nScyclave also hosted a political faction known as the Collectors, who were responsible for the acquisition of knowledge and resources from outside the city.\nAs of 1479 DR, Scyclave had few visitors and little trade with the outside world aside from the occasional ship arriving from the Sea of Fallen Stars to exchange goods.\nA military force called the Vengeance Riders stabled their redwings in magnificent roosts on balconies near the top of the tower. A patrol of at least four mounted redwings would constantly circle the tower.\nThe tower was erected sometime following the devastation of the Spellplague of the , when the descendants of the ancient Imaskari emerged to reclaim the shattered land of Mulhorand for their own.\nAs of the , a cell of devil worshipers led by a self-proclaimed \"child of Mephistopheles\" known as the Son of the Eighth was active somewhere within Skyclave despite efforts by the Empress to have them eliminated. However, all of her agents had either failed to find them or had failed to return alive.\n* Academy of Imaskar, a school of wizardry.\n* Ayars Table, a tavern that served mushroom ale and other fare common in Deep Imaskar.\n* The Edge, a tavern that occupied several balconies on the outside of Skyclave. The establishment was famed for its views.\n* Palace of the Purple Emperor, a partly-restored magically mobile palace from which Empress Ususi ruled which had been relocated into Scyclave.\nIn 1479 DR, Skyclave was inhabited by both nobles and commonfolk of High Imaskar. At this time, the city was home to more than half of the High Imaskars total population, of whom half lived within the tower and the other half around its base. The inhabitants were predominantly humans descended from the Deep Imaskari."
