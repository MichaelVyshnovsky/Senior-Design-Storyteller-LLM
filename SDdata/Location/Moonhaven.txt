Settlement
Moonhaven, also referred to as the blighted village, or Bogrot, was a small settlement in the Western Heartlands that had ties to a nearby Selûnite temple. It fell into ruin after being repeatedly assaulted by soldiers, and remained in ruin for well over a century.
Alongside the temple, Moonhaven was situated on the Risen Road, some ways east of Moonrise Towers near the border of Elturgard.
