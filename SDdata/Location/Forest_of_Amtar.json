        "mainbody": "The '''Forest of Amtar''' (known as the '''Forest of Amlar''' to some [[Dambrath|Dambraii]]{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|59-60}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 49: The Road to Khôltar, Part 2}}) was a large forest in [[south Faerûn]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Before the Spellplague, the [[Landrise]] cut into the northeastern part of the forest, but the cliffs ended before reaching the other side. The eastern part of the forest hid many stone ruins of past cities, built by [[human]]-sized inhabitants as well as [[giant]]-sized, that made for break-neck drops and break-ankle ditches covered by profuse undergrowth."
        },
        "Description": "This lush forest was extremely hot and humid, with temperatures typically above 90F (32C) even during the night,Although ''[[The Shining South (1993)]]'' states that the Forest of Amtar was primarily [[blueleaf]] trees, this was [[wikipedia:en:retcon|retconned]] to be [[suth]] trees in ''[[Shining South (sourcebook)|Shining South]]'', published in 2004. which intertwined with each other to form nearly impenetrable barriers in the densest parts of the forest. Interspersed among the suth were tall [[shadowtop]]s and slightly shorter [[pine]] trees, all towering over a thick underbrush made of ivy, climbing vines, and brambles like living, leafy spider webs clawing their way upward.\n\nThe canopy and clinging vines blocked most of the sunlight from reaching the ground, creating a green gloom in the understory. The floor of the forest was typically covered with dead leaves to a depth of at least a foot (thirty centimeters) that decomposed in the damp dark to form rich but smelly black soil.\n\nWhile many of the vines that clung to the canopy were innocuous, the Forest of Amtar was riddled with [[choke creeper]]s and had large populations of [[assassin vine]]s and [[roper]]s as well. The constant heat and humidity made it a perfect habitat for crawling and flying insects, including giant [[beetle]]s such as the [[giant rhinoceros beetle]]. Many species of [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s were at home in the Amtar, including giant varieties.\n\nMany jungle mammals could also be found within the forest: [[jaguar]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[tiger]]s prowled the underbrush; wild boar were fairly common; monkeys, [[gorilla]]s, and [[carnivorous ape]]s made their home generally in the northern half of the forest, but packs of [[dire ape]]s and [[girallon]]s could be found wandering the entire Amtar. Tropical birds were also well represented in the Amtar, including parrots and macaws.\n\nWildlife was so abundant in the Forest of Amtar that [[Elminster]], the Sage of Shadowdale, speculated that the forest contained active ''[[portal]]s'' that allowed creatures to wander in from other places and/or several [[deepspawn]] with a nearly endless food supply.",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[Trunadar]] (or \"star people\", as they called themselves) were a group of few hundred [[wild elves]], led by their [[shaman]] [[Ferla Treerunner]], that lived in the southern center of the forest. They were in occasional conflict with the [[dusk elf|dusk elves]] of Dambrath who sometimes hunted them for sport, and the [[Quinix]] tribe of [[gnoll]]s that inhabited the southwestern part of the forest around the [[Gate of Iron Fangs]].\n\nOn the northern and eastern edges of the forest, several groups of organized bandits preyed on travelers and caravans along the [[Trader's Way]]. In the mid-to-late 1360s DR, these included a group of outcast [[Arkaiun]]s, a band of [[orc]]s led by an [[ogre mage]] named [[Tandi Earsgone]], and an evil adventuring company known as [[Dracil's Raiders]]. By the early 1370s, the orc band and [[Dracil]]'s group had been eliminated or scattered and newer groups, such as the all-female [[Raunstrar]] and  magi-centric [[Maurvurr]] had moved in. A ragtag group of [[human]]s, [[half-orc]]s, and [[ogre]]s plagued the road between [[Channathgate]] and the Landrise. This group may have reformed under Tandi Earsgone because the leader was an ogre mage calling himself [[Tandith Tornears]].{{Speculation}}\n\nSome of the giant snakes in the Forest of Amtar (and elsewhere) were blessed by the god of serpents, [[Sseth]], and these cunning and intelligent beings were known as [[elder serpent]]s. In the [[1359 DR|Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]], the rival god [[Set]] attacked Sseth, bound him, and took over his portfolio and the worship of his elder serpents.{{Cite dragon/313/Faiths of Faerun: Elder Serpents of Set|85}}\n\nAt some point in time a group of [[choker]]s from the [[Underdark]] somehow made its way to the Amtar Forest and acclimatized to live in the heat and the gloom.\n\nAs of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], an [[Dragon aging|adult]] male [[mercury dragon]] named [[Trinculo]] made his home here.",
        "Notable Locations": "The small logging city of [[Elveswatch]] could be found along the southeastern rim of the forest on the [[River Ammath]]. Along the southwestern edge sat the [[Gate of Iron Fangs]] on the [[River Dambron]].",
        "History": "* Around {{Yearlink|-23200}}, the [[dark elf]] realm of [[Ilythiir]] had spread across the [[Shaar]] and the Forest of Amtar.\n* By {{Yearlink|-5800}}, the ancestors of the wild elves, the so-called [[green elves]], had settled here and other grand woodlands.\n* In the [[817 DR|Year of the Deadly Torch, 817 DR]], during the conquest of [[Dambrath]] by the drow of [[T'lindhet]], 1,500 drow troops retreated into the Amtar only to be slaughtered by the wild elves."
