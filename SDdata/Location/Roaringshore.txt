'''Roaringshore''' was a small, isolated village on the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The village nestled in a small deepwater cove on the coast, with the [[Winding Water]] river and [[Lathtarl's Lantern]] located north of the village and [[Baldur's Gate]] to the south.

==Government==
Roaringshore was known for being a lawless place, much like the neighboring village of [[Lathtarl's Lantern]] to the north.

==History==
The village was known as a pirate hold and was frequently raided by mercenaries hired by [[Amn]] and [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Rumors & Legends==
One agent of the [[Harpers]] claimed the local tavern, the Broken Goblet, was run by [[mind flayer]]s who used the establishment to gather information about illicit doings occurring around the [[Sword Coast]].

==Notable Locations==
The [[Swordarm]] was an inn that once was a rundown place typical of pirates to frequent until a [[wizard]], [[Aulyntar Cowlsar]] decided to renovate it using the life force of three of his apprentices—who could still be seen bound to the ceiling, their faces frozen in horror.

The [[Broken Goblet]], was a tavern frequented by pirates and lawless folk where folks commonly entered with weapons drawn.
