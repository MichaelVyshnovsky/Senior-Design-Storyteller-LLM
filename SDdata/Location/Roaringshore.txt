Roaringshore was a small, isolated village on the Sword Coast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The village nestled in a small deepwater cove on the coast, with the Winding Water river and Lathtarls Lantern located north of the village and Baldurs Gate to the south.
Roaringshore was known for being a lawless place, much like the neighboring village of Lathtarls Lantern to the north.
The village was known as a pirate hold and was frequently raided by mercenaries hired by Amn and Baldurs Gate.
One agent of the Harpers claimed the local tavern, the Broken Goblet, was run by mind flayers who used the establishment to gather information about illicit doings occurring around the Sword Coast.
The Swordarm was an inn that once was a rundown place typical of pirates to frequent until a wizard, Aulyntar Cowlsar decided to renovate it using the life force of three of his apprenticesâ€”who could still be seen bound to the ceiling, their faces frozen in horror.
The Broken Goblet, was a tavern frequented by pirates and lawless folk where folks commonly entered with weapons drawn.
