The '''West Cwm''' was a large high valley in the [[Shaeradim]], the hills surrounding [[Evereska]].{{cite book/Forsaken House|210|12}}

In the south, there was a large deep lake of very cold water,

It was the site of the [[Battle of the Cwm]] between the [[daemonfey]] army and the defending elves of Evereska and [[Evermeet]], on [[Ches 27]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
