Fallenfalcon was a tiny community of several families that existed around a camping pavilion in the wild realm of Owlhold in the Border Kingdoms.
Fallenfalcon could be reached by traveling north along the Bowshot from the lone Griffon Aflame inn. The entirety of the thorp consisted of four rustic cottages that were the homes of half-elven families. The main attraction for those traveling the untamed land was a large camping pavilion and a small spring, which was the source of clean drinkable water. The cottages were built around a pool connected to the spring.
The families of the two cottages closest to the pavilion eagerly greeted travelers, offering them bread, soup, or a bigger meal if ordered ahead of time.
The lands north of Fallenfalcon were flush with various herbs and berries, often gathered along the trails that ran through the wilderness.
*Jlonkin the Bowyer and his family inhabited one of the closest cottages to the road and pavilion in the late 14 century DR.
*Nressa the Weaver and her family lived in the other of the two cottages closest to the Bowshot road in the late 14 century DR.
