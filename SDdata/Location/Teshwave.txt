'''Teshwave''' was a small town in [[Teshendale]] in the [[Dalelands]].

{{quote|''Teshwave has approximately fifty native citizens left, and they are unable to leave because they have nowhere else to go. The fight has gone out of the people; they accept their lot like dumb sheep. If there is a resistance here, I could not find it. I'll wager you'll find Zhentish [[steel]] in your back before you find anyone here with fire in his belly.''|[[Bard]] [[Mendryll Belarod]] the [[Half-elven]]}}

==Description==
A ramshackle concoction of ruins, tents, and newly-built barracks and some surviving structured from pre-[[Zhentarim|Zhent]] town, as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The biggest building in the city was the [[Manor House]], noticeably well-maintained and clean, unlike the rest of the ruins. The town's garrison commander occupied the manor. Another area of interest was the [[Lair]], a big pile of collapsed structured nestled together and used as barracks for monstrous humanoid forces of the [[Zhentil Keep]].

==Geography==
[[File:Teshwave-ZhentilKeep-1367DR.png|thumb|''Teshwave and environs, circa [[1367 DR]].''|390x390px]]
The community was built along the [[River Tesh]] just south of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]]. The town was known for its scenic rapids and cascades of the River Tesh.

==Trade==
The town was the largest trading community in Teshendale and was controlled by the forces of Zhentil Keep.

==Government==
Before destruction, Teshwave was represented in the [[Dales Council]]. When there was a government, the town was ruled by the Elder with [[Jaoth Hulnhurn]] bring the last and presumed long-dead by [[1356 DR]]. As of the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Dales Council kept Teshwave representative's seat open in memory of Jaoth and as a shameful reminder of not lending aid to a fellow Dale.

After the Zhentarim takeover, the Black Networked entrusted the entire Dale to a [[beholder]]. [[Manxam]], The Tyrant of Teshendale, was that aberrant eye tyrant who could be found in the ruins of Teshwave and its environs. Apart from the beholder Zhent, the military leader of the outpost was a rotational position among the strongest individuals.

==Defense==
While Teshwave was protected by tribes of [[orc]]s, [[gnoll]]s, and [[ogre]]s, Zhentil Keep had a reserve of two to three thousand troops to defend the town.

==History==
Teshwave suffered greatly in the {{YearlinkName|1306}}. [[Dragon Run]] descended on the region and rained destruction on the cities of Teshwave, [[Phlan]], and [[Yulash]]. More strife was caused by [[orc]]ish slavers that started regularly raiding the Dale. Many of the town's inhabitants fled for the safety of neighboring Dales. Zhentil Keep did not seek to claim the land, instead, they aimed to completely ravage and destroy the Dale.

Another [[Rage of Dragons]] took place in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, but the dragons were driven out by the agents of Zhentil Keep. Later that year, Zhent-ally beholder Manxam took the ruined city as its base. Following the [[Time of Troubles]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, [[Fzoul Chembryl]] retreated to Teshwave for a time, after the demise of [[Bane]], the patron deity of the Black Network. Eventually, Fzoul returned to the Zhentil Keep as a devoted follower of Bane's son – [[Iyachtu Xvim]]. 

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}} the town was a glorified ruin with a single inn and a sizable force of Zhents stationed there. [[Tyran]] the Outlaw, a descendant of Teshwave, gained notoriety as a bandit and aggressive opponent of the Zhent occupation. He assembled guerrilla war parties of woodcutters and [[ranger]]s to strike against the Black Network and their monstrous humanoid agents. Keepers put a bounty of 500 [[gold]] pieces on the Outlaw's head. However, sages believed that even if Tyran were to succeed in driving the occupiers out, Teshendale was beyond salvage.

During the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the entirety of southern part of the Moonsea was consumed by panic. The strange new menace summoned [[fiend]]s to sow chaos and destruction, restricting trade, and within first few weeks of the menace – attacked Teshwave. The cult targeted the Black Network and Teshwave was a clear target. 

==Notable Inhabitants==
===Organizations===
*[[Church of Bane]], a number of members of the church operated the god's shrine in the city after the Black Network claimed Teshendale.
*[[Church of Cyric]], became the dominant religion in Teshwave after Bane's demise. [[Cyric]]'s inquisitors operated out of the town to expand the cult.
*[[Church of Iyachtu Xvim]], with Bane dead and Cyric losing power to insanity, Iyachtu Xvim's worshipers rook over the Black Network.

===Individuals===

*[[Ensebel Riotharr]], a Watcher of Bane stationed in the Zhent camp ''circa'' the [[Time of Troubles]].
*[[Guthbert Golthammer]], a huge ox-like man, one of the military commanders of the Zhent forces in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Hallorfan Teshdale]], adding proprietor of the Rapids and one of the surviving inhabitants of pre-Zhent Teshwave in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Tula Woodsbridge]], a secret [[Harpers]] agent operating in the guise of a serving girl at the Rapids in the late 14{{th}} century DR.

*[[Rapids]], one of the very few undamaged buildings in the city after Zhentarim takeover.
*[[Ruins of the Crested Wave]], a cheap inn with a sizable common room being its only lodgings.
*[[Teshendale Arms]], once a tavern, ruined by the Zhentil Keep. Even in its destroyed state, the inn's ruins were used as a meeting place by travelers and merchants lucky enough not to be targeted by the Black Network.

===Shops===
*[[Vergun's Caravan Shop]], a shop established by a corrupt merchant [[Vergun]] with an aid of copious bribes to Zhentil Keep occupants in the late 14{{th}} century DR.

===Temples & Shrines===
*[[Temple of Iyachtu Xvim (Teshwave)|Temple of Iyachtu Xvim]], rose in [[Flamerule]] [[1370 DR]] after the Zhentarim adopted the Baneson as their deity.
*[[Shrine to Bane (Teshwave)|Shrine to Bane]], offered its services to individuals aligned with Zhentil Keep, the evil god's church, and those who believe in malice, evil, and destruction.
