'''Phelajarama''', also known as the '''City of the Serpent''', was the capital of the [[Lost Kingdoms|Lost Kingdom]] of [[Asram]].<ref name=A.EoS-p134">

==Description==
The city was famous for a common theme in its artistry, carvings of [[snake]]s that were plastered with gold leaf.<ref name=A.EoS-p134" />

==Geography==
Phelajarama was located near the source of the waterway later called the [[River Tesh]]. After the ruined city was swallowed up by the sands of [[Anauroch]], it remained under the stretch of the desert called [[At'ar's Looking Glass]].

==History==
In [[Eleasias|Eleasius]] of the {{YearlinkName|-33}}, Asram was struck by a horrendous plague, an apparent result of the interloper goddess [[Kiputytto]] attacking the goddess [[Talona]] in the city of Phelajarama. Talona emerged victorious by bringing down her plague upon the city, forcing the inhabitants to offer their prayers, while Kiputytto struck back in a similar manner. Talona's plagues overcame the curative resources of the city, leaving the population dead within a month.
