}}'''Sakkors''' was an ancient [[Netheril|Netherese]] city built on an inverted mountain top. Because of [[Karsus's Folly]], it plunged into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Before the fall of [[Netheril]], one of the High Arcanists, [[Xolund]] "the Maker", infused the [[mythallar]] of his own city with a rudimentary sentience, which called itself the Source. Unlike other [[mythallar]]s, it could direct or withhold its magical power as instructed. Instead of powering all items in its proximity, it could focus all its power on a single item, on none, or on many. The development of a sentient mythallar had caused a stir among the arcanists of the empire, but the Fall had ended any attempts to duplicate Xolund's feat.<ref>

[[Erevis Cale]] first discovered the ruined city and its protector, the [[kraken]] [[Ssessimyth]]. The mythallar had melded to the head of the kraken, and in the battle that ensued between Erevis and the kraken, the mythallar called out for help in [[Loross]].<ref>

The [[Shadovar]] repaired the [[mythallar]], the power source keeping the city aloft. As of [[1479 DR]], Sakkors had a population of 15,000 and was commonly sighted over [[Sembia]].

By [[1484 DR]] the mythal was dying{{Cite digital book/The Godborn/Kindle|931}} and [[Magadon Kest]] made contact with the mythal at the request of [[Drasek Riven]]. Megadon steered the city toward the [[Ordulin Maelstrom]] in order to lend the mythal's power to Drasek in an attempt to prevent [[Shar]]'s void from growing. The residents of Sakkors evacuated prior to the mythal's complete collapse and the city crashed into the ruins of Ordulin, destroying the void.{{Cite digital book/The Godborn/Kindle|5567}}
