Zashuma was a small town in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14th century DR.
It sat beside the Lapal Way, in the shadow the city of Ithmong in the north.
Around 1373 DR, it was led by Clanlaird Burinn Rivenstone.
The civic deity of Zashuma was Garl Glittergold.
It was a farming town focused on growing olives and producing wine.
Unusually, Zashuma was mostly populated by rock gnomes, unlike the predominantly human communities of Lapaliiya.
