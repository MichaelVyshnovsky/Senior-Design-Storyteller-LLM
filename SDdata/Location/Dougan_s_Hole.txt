'''Dougan's Hole''' was the smallest of the [[Ten Towns]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. It comprised a meager grouping of buildings arranged around a pair of piers, one long and one short.

==Geography==
The town was located on the western shore of [[Redwaters]], southwest of [[Good Mead]]. Its northern edge was marked with a path of gravel.

==History==
The hamlet of Dougan's Hole was founded by [[Dougan Dubrace]], when he found a great spot to fish on the shore of Redwaters lake.

During the 1360s DR, the spokesman was [[Freya Grynstead]], the widow of the previous spokesman who had died while fishing out on the lake. Freya lived in a house in the middle of town connected to the fishhouse by a boardwalk.

Some one hundred years later, around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the speaker was the outspoken and gruff trapper [[Edgra Durmoot]].

==Notable Locations==
[[File:Dougan's-Hole.jpg|thumb|250px|''A map of Dougan's Hole.'']]
Perhaps the only noteworthy landmark of Dougan's Hole was the megalith structure known as the [[Twenty Stones of Thruun]]. These twenty [[granite]] slabs, arranged in an equilateral triangle that overlooked the town.
