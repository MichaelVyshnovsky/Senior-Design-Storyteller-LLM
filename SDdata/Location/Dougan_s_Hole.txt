Dougans Hole was the smallest of the Ten Towns in Icewind Dale. It comprised a meager grouping of buildings arranged around a pair of piers, one long and one short.
The town was located on the western shore of Redwaters, southwest of Good Mead. Its northern edge was marked with a path of gravel.
The hamlet of Dougans Hole was founded by Dougan Dubrace, when he found a great spot to fish on the shore of Redwaters lake.
During the 1360s DR, the spokesman was Freya Grynstead, the widow of the previous spokesman who had died while fishing out on the lake. Freya lived in a house in the middle of town connected to the fishhouse by a boardwalk.
Some one hundred years later, around the , the speaker was the outspoken and gruff trapper Edgra Durmoot.
