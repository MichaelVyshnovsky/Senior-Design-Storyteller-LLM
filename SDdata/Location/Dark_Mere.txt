Dark Mere was a swamp in the Spine of the World mountains in northwest Faer√ªn,  north of the small town of Blasingdell.
This swamp stood at the foot of the Stone Tooth, a peak of the southern Spine of the World range.
Kobolds from the Sourscale Warrens were known to leave slain creatures in its brackish waters to "pickle" them for a while before eating.
