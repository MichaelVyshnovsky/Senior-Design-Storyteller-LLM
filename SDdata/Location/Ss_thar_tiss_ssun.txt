'''Ss'thar'tiss'ssun''', or the '''City of Fountains''', was once a [[sarrukh]] realm and later the capital city of the ancient serpent empire known as [[Najara]].

==Geography==
Its breadth once extended at least as far as [[Serpent's Cowl]], on the western edge of the [[Forest of Wyrms]]; the villagers there avoid digging cellars for fear of falling into the buried ruins of the city. A network of tunnels still connected Ss'thar'tiss'ssun with [[Ss'zuraass'nee]] and to caverns beneath [[Mount Hlim]] at the southern edge of the [[Greypeak Mountains]].

==History==
The original City of Fountains was founded during the [[Days of Thunder]], around {{yearlink|-30000}}, by a powerful [[creator race]] called the sarrukh. It was built as a temple-city by the cult of [[Ssharstrune]], but was abandoned after their god's apparent death.

In a bygone age, the slithering [[ophidian]]s from the [[High Moor]] and [[Serpent Hills]] migrated to the Forest of Wyrms. 

In the [[-320 DR|Year of Netted Dreams, âˆ’320 DR]], [[yuan-ti]] members of [[House Hss'tafi]] were magically summoned from the northwestern shores of the [[Lapal Sea]] and transported here. They thrived as nobles of Najara, primarily acting as administrators, merchants, and religious leaders.

When the city fell to the [[Verraketh Talembar|Shadowking]] of [[Ebenfar]] in the {{YearlinkName|90}}, Najara fell with it. Terpenzi was slain, Serpentfolk who survived fled to the Serpent Hills, and wards were placed by agents of the Shadowking in order to keep all serpentfolk out. It would eventually be built over, albeit partly, by the villagers of [[Serpent's Cowl]].

Nevertheless, House Hss'tafi survived the fall of Najara and continued Terpenzi's legacy through his descendants, the [[dark naga]]. One of their works included converting the original temple to the Shrine of Cowled Serpents. This underground shrine contained the legendary ''Naja Fountain'', which was the home of Terpenzi after his conversion.

The serpentfolk succeeded in penetrating the wards to the old city in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}. Ss'thar'tiss'ssun was carefully re-explored by wizards of the [[Coiled Cabal]] from the neighboring city of [[Ss'kowlyn'raa]], the City of Spellskins.

Even centuries after its initial destruction, [[Ebarnaje]], a later King of Najara, sought to capture the city and reclaim it as a capitol.

==Inhabitants==
The ruins of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun were occupied from different kinds of [[undead]] and [[construct]] guardians left to their own devices, as well as successful species brought over by the different occupations of serpentfolk. [[Sword spider]]s and [[ti-khana]] (hybridized) [[dinosaur]]s made their nests here, and undead bone nagas guarded treasures from every era of the city.

==Notable Locations==
The ''Naja Fountain'' was said to improve the arcane magic of any who bathed in it, and its waters had healing properties. With Terpenzi's death, the shrine was left unattended.
