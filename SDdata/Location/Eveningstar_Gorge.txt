Eveningstar Gorge was located north of the town of Eveningstar, where the Starwater River broke through the Stonecliff. This allowed one of the only routes up to the dangerous Stonelands,
The base of the gorge was covered with scrub trees and thickets, some of which produced berries. Brave children from the town played there often.
Tressym, the famed winged cats, were thought to have originated in the Eveningstar region, and most of the population lived and hunted in the gorge, keeping rodent numbers low.
In the winter, wolves would migrate down from the Stonelands to the gorge to hunt, giving rise to the term "wolf winters" for particularly harsh winters in the region.
