        "Description": "The Heralds' Meet was a large, open commons area paved with flagstones, distinguished by ten ship masts that have been firmly embedded to a depth of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} to prevent tampering. Affixed to these wooden columns were a variety of scraps and full sheets of [[parchment]] and [[vellum]], displaying notices posted by those either seeking employment or looking to hire workers. The details of these postings were often deliberately vague, particularly from prospective employers.\n\nThe Heralds' Meet served as a hub where individuals could join the crew of a ship, hire sailors or mercenaries for bodyguard duties, or scout for general employment opportunities. Given that a significant number of Skullportâ€™s residents were illiterate, three or four professional scribes were regularly present, offering to read the notices aloud for a fee of one [[copper piece]] per page, or a dozen pages for one [[silver piece]].\n\nIndividuals seeking mundane or adventuring work were often approached here by representatives of potential employers. Preliminary interviews typically took place over drinks at the nearby [[Black Tankard]] tavern, where negotiations and discussions about the job in question were further explored.",
