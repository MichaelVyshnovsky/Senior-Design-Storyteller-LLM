The '''Central Trade Lanes''' of Skullport was the central level of the Trade Lanes.

==Description==
The Central Trade Lanes was a quieter, less chaotic atmosphere compared to the bustling [[Lower Trade Lanes]]. The district’s structures were a marvel of precarious construction, often built into the cavern walls or perched on the edges of massive stalactites and stone columns. Others were stacked atop lower buildings or suspended from overhead structures and the main cavern by [[rope]]s and [[chain]]s, creating a vertical labyrinth of shops and residences. Despite the haphazard appearance, the catwalks connecting these locations were in relatively good repair, and the transit routes are more stable and permanent than in other parts of Skullport. Residents typically lived in close proximity to their businesses, often occupying dwellings adjacent to or directly above their shops.

Security in the Central Trade Lanes was more robust than in other areas of Skullport. Many shop owners employed [[mercenaries]] and sellswords to protect their properties, resulting in a lower frequency of violent crimes. Nevertheless, incidents such as break-ins and muggings remained a persistent concern. The district’s lighting mirrored that of the Lower Trade Lanes, providing a dim and ambient glow, though deep shadows collected in the recesses behind stalactites and stone columns.
