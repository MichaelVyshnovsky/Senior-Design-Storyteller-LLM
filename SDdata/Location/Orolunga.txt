City
Orolunga was a ruined city of ancient Chult that partially survived the ravages of time. As of the late 15 century DR, all that remained was a single ziggurat that was connected through time to the guardian naga, Saja Nbaza.
The ziggurat of Orolunga stood over 60-feet (18.3 meters) tall and had four distinct layers. Its facade was lined with numerous staircases, by which travelers could access its interior. Its exterior was decorated with symbols of Ubtao and by the , was entirely covered by tropical vegetation.
Located in the topmost chamber was an empty, barren shrine.
The ziggurat was enchanted in such a manner that no individual could traverse its exterior without climbing the stairs at its front. This enchantment was extremely powerful and described as "mythic".
After the Death Curse was broken, the yuan-ti anathema Kressâ€™voon led a sect of yuan-ti in an assault on Orolunga and slew Saja Nbaza. The yuan-ti then employed a beholder to carve out a tunnel to a lesser tomb beneath Orolunga as part of a plot to free Dendar the Night Serpent.
The ruined city was home to a number of chwinga spirits.
Saja Nbaza lived in Orolunga hundreds of years before the Second Sundering. If a being entered the ziggurats shrine in the subsequent years, while carrying an orchid and the feather of a parrot, they could speak with Saja Nbaza as if they were alive during her time.
