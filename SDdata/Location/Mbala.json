        "mainbody": "Mbala was a town located atop a sheer plateau northwest of the Aldani Basin in Chult. \nUnlike most towns in Chult, Mbala was located far inland and was more than 50 miles (80 km) from either the Soshenstar or Tath rivers.\nA narrow (roughly 5 feet wide) path wound around the plateau for three miles in total, including several switchbacks, effectively prohibiting an army from marching upon the high plateau. Climbing the plateau itself was a difficult prospect too, requiring both skill and the proper equipment.\nMbala was once the seat of a small Chultan kingdom.\nAt an unknown point, a green hag posing as a witch doctor calling herself Nanny Pupu slaughtered and ate all of Mbalas citizens until she was the only sentient resident left.\nAfter the populations demise, Myrkul, the Lord of Bones, claimed Mbala as his territory and demanded an offering from any passing travelers."
