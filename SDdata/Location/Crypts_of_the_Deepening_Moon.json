        "mainbody": "The Crypts of the Deepening Moon were a series of vaults that held the remains of laranlors and laranlas (kings and queens) from the ancient moon elf realm of Ardeep.\nThe Crypts were located in the heart of Ardeep Forest, shown above, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. In the time of Ardeeps greatness, over one and a half millennia before this map, the forest extended from what became Neverwinter Wood in the north to the Trollbark Forest in the south, covering much of the northern Sword Coast. The Crypts were just northwest of the Green Glade, between two forks of the Ardeep River.\nWhen the realm of Ardeep dissolved in the Year of the Lamias Kiss, 615 DR, most of the remaining elves departed for Evermeet, and left behind baelnorns and green warders to guard their legacy. Three baelnorns and a whole host of green warders were set to guard the Crypts of the Deepening Moon against looters and defilers.\nStories and legends about the great wealth and powerful magic buried with the elvish royalty attracted expeditions funded by wealthy Waterdhavian noble families and independent, self-proclaimed adventuring bands. Few to none returned with their lives, let alone anything of value."
