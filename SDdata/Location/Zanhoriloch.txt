'''Zanhoriloch''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] city located on an island in [[Lake Thoroot]]. An [[aboleth]] colony in the lake was also known by this name. The dwarves often called their city '''Mhorilot''', meaning "dark surface."

==Geography==
The settlement and Lake Thoroot were located somewhere beneath [[Cormanthor]] and were connected to [[Battledale]] via a tunnel.

==Description==
The dwarves reworked the original drow architecture on the island to fit their own tastes.

The aboleth colony was located underwater.

==Inhabitants==
The dwarves fished and farmed kelp for food, and also had mining expeditions on the shore of the lake to obtain silver, gold, and iron. After several centuries avoiding surfacers, they began trading weapons and precious metals with the inhabitants of [[Battledale]] for grain, beef, and wood.

The aboleth colony was ruled ca. [[1373 DR]] by the matriarch [[Oothoon]]. The aboleths used their slime to mutate drow into underwater creatures (no ears, webbed hands and feet, fluked tail, no hair), possibly for use as slaves or food.

The level of interaction between the dwarves and the aboleth was unknown.

==History==
The city of Zanhoriloch located on an island as originally built by [[drow]] in [[722 DR]]. They attacked the dwarven city of [[Kanaglym]] through a portal located on the island. However, the dwarves pushed the drow back and a number of them followed them through the portal. They sacked the city and, finding themselves trapped, claimed it as their own.


In [[1372 DR]]/[[1373 DR]], a [[drow]] expedition led by [[Quenthel Baenre]] camped on the shores of Lake Thoroot near a waterfall while they sought for information about a downed [[ship of chaos]]. While scouting the lake, [[Valas Hune]] encountered a strange mutated drow who urged him to flee. Valas was subsequently captured by an aboleth named [[Jooran]], who used his slime to turn him into the same kind of mutated drow. Valas was able to escape back to his companions and [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] returned him to drow form via a [[polymorph]] spell. The leading members of the exhibition then spoke with [[Oothoon]], who (after some plotting) revealed that the ship of chaos was actually in the [[Lake of Shadows]].

==Notable inhabitants==
;[[Oothoon]] : [[Aboleth]] matriarch and ruler of the aboleth colony.
;[[Jooran]] : [[Aboleth]] who captured [[Valas Hune]] in [[1372 DR]]/[[1373 DR]]. He was subsequently consumed by Oothoon.
