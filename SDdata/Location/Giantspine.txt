'''Giantspine''', or '''Jotunspine''',{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|5}} was the largest island within the kingdom of [[Norheim]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|11}}

==Geography==
Giantspine was centrally located with regards to the islands making up Norheim. It sat between the [[Trackless Sea]] and the [[Sea of Moonshae]] on [[Northwind Strait]] in the northwest corner of the Moonshae Isles. The [[Giantspine Range]] dominated much of the island and shielded the eastern coast from the storms that rolled in off of the Trackless Sea.
