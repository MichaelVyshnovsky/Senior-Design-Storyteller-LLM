        "mainbody": "Muluk, located on the mouth of Al-Zalim River, was one of the Free Cities of Zakhara. Renowned as a trading city, Muluk specialized in many goods including regal purple dye. Its established unbroken line of rulers gave it the name \"City of Kings\". It was located between the cities of Umara to the south and Qadib to the north.\nMuluk was the base for the Respected Mamluk Society.\nMuluks armed forces consisted of 2,000 footmen, 5,000 militia, and 1,000 cavalry. Additionally, the mamluks of the Respected numbered 2,000 strong.\nMuluk was initially founded as the city of Inaash which translated to \"place of life-giving refreshment\" in Old Anwahran. Centuries later the city was renamed after the Caliph accepted the Law of the Loregiver."
