        "mainbody": "riffon Hill was a thorp in the East Reaches of northern Cormyr, on edge of the Stonelands.\nGriffon Hill was an unremarkable collection of fortified cottages and a repeatedly-burnt-down inn that sat atop a rocky hill. It was populated by hardy shepherds and several priests of Chauntea, who had become suspicious of visitors after being tricked by bandits repeatedly.\nThe hill upon which the settlement was found sat about halfway along the Stonebolt Trail, from Gnoll Pass to Shadow Gap. Roughly  to the west was a noted goblin burial ground. The ruins of Darkenshield lay far to the south along the Trail, while Halfhap and Tilverton sat along the parallel Moonsea Ride to the south and east, respectively.\nSomewhere below the hilltop was a good-sized aquifer that the residents used to draw drinking water.\nGriffon Hill raised sheep and traded the meat and wool of its flocks for whatever they could buy from the merchants who visited them. Those in need of healing also traveled to the site to visit the three priests of Chauntea who lived there, who supplemented the thorps income by selling holy water and other services. More expensive goods were imported from Arabel via trusted messengers hired by the priests.\nApart from lying at the top of a hill, the cottages of Griffon Hill were somewhat fortified against attack. During the mid–14 century DR, one of the priests living there gained the ability to summon earth elementals and control the weather.\nThe hill was named after the griffons that had lived there, though they were long gone by the 14 century. After it was settled, Griffon Hill became the target for frequent orc attacks, but the folk living there survived and rebuilt time after time.\nIt was said that when under dire threat, the residents of Griffon Hill retreated to a cavern within the hill itself for safety. Legend also had it that this cavern was deep enough to connect to the Underdark, and that they could flee there to escape pursuit.\nOne of the cottages built atop the hill was set aside for visiting travelers to sleep in — it was marked by faerie fire, had cots set up inside, and was stocked with firewood and water. However, it was also kept in a far less tidy state, with the door left open unless occupied."
