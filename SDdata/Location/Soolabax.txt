'''Soolabax''' was a walled town in [[Chessenta]] near the border with [[Threskel]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta}}

The town was overcrowded and there was no room inside the walls for new construction. The town's nominal ruler was Baron [[Hasos Thora]], though he was a vassal of [[Tchazzar]]. There was a temple to [[Amaunator]] in the town.

Soolabax was briefly besieged in [[1479 DR]] by [[Threskel]]an forces until the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] lifted the siege.
