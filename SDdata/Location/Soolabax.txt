Soolabax was a walled town in Chessenta near the border with Threskel.
The town was overcrowded and there was no room inside the walls for new construction. The towns nominal ruler was Baron Hasos Thora, though he was a vassal of Tchazzar. There was a temple to Amaunator in the town.
Soolabax was briefly besieged in 1479 DR by Threskelan forces until the Brotherhood of the Griffon lifted the siege.
