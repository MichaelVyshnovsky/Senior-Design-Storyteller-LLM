'''Vercy Wood''' was a forest found on the [[Moonsea North]] region of [[North Faerûn]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Geography==
The forest was located northwest of the [[West Galena Mountains]], just beyond the lands of [[Thar]].

===Geographical Features===
Flowing northwest from the Galenas, [[Telstang Brook]] passed west through the forest before emptying into [[Lake Longreach]].

The [[Ilinver Trail]] also passed through Vercy Wood, linking [[Ilinver]] with the settlement of [[Avang]] to the east.
