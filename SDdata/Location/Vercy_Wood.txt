Vercy Wood was a forest found on the Moonsea North region of North Faer√ªn.
The forest was located northwest of the West Galena Mountains, just beyond the lands of Thar.
Flowing northwest from the Galenas, Telstang Brook passed west through the forest before emptying into Lake Longreach.
The Ilinver Trail also passed through Vercy Wood, linking Ilinver with the settlement of Avang to the east.
