[[Moon elf]]s colonized this forested island long ago and, at some point after [[173 DR]], welcomed several Halruaan worshipers of [[Leira]] who, dissatisfied with the stranglehold that worshipers of [[Mystra]] and [[Azuth]] had gained over the [[Council of Elders (Halruaa)|Council of Elders]], departed Halruaa in skyships.<ref name=SS-173><ref name=RL-TRoN1>{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Realm of Nimbral, Part One: Legends, Mysteries, and History}} Intermarriage between [[elf|elves]] and humans became common, and their descendants lived in harmony on the island for many years. The elves who did not want to coexist so closely with humans eventually abandoned Nimbral. It wasn't too long before there were hardly any pure-blooded elves left on the island.<ref name=RL-TRoN1 /><ref name=CoV-85> \n\nIn [[605 DR]] the Nimbrese were asked to help destroy the [[yuan-ti]] of what was then Western [[Thindol]]. [[Lord Samar]] agreed to return with the Thindolese and battle the yuan-ti. A year after, in [[606 DR]], the western Thindolese, with the aid of Lord Samar and Nimbral, drove the yuan-ti from their [[Sanrach Basin]] home. Afterwards, the Nimbrese Lord veiled the surrounding mountain passes in powerful illusions, protecting the region from further infiltration of the serpentfolk. The land became known as [[Samarach]] and was considered a vassal state of Nimbral by the natives.<ref name=GHotR-92><ref name=SK-118>\n\nThe priesthood of Leira became more and more powerful as time went on and, whilst still a peaceful realm, Nimbral became the playground of the Leirans.{{fact}}\n\nWhen Leira, the state patron goddess, allegedly died during the [[Time of Troubles]], brief strife reigned as her priests were all slain or driven from the realm by indentured wizards who had been made to create magic items for the priesthood. This put an end to the constant and unnecessary \"Dreamweaving\" (altering another's perception of the world through methods that ranged from something as simple as lying to magically manipulating the dreams of people) that the priesthood practiced on the island's citizens. These wizards became the new [[Nimbral Lords]] and decided that religion was a self-limiting thing and banned organized priesthoods and state religions from the realm, individual priests and small shrines are still allowed though if they are found to offend the law, exile is added to the usual punishment for the offense.<ref name=RL-TRoN5>{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Realm of Nimbral, Part Five: Laws and Heralds}}<ref name=RL-TRoN6>{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Realm of Nimbral, Part Six: Of Heralds and of the Nimbrese Character}}\n\nNimbral first came to the common attention of mainlanders in the Year of the Shield ([[1367 DR]]) when the Knights of the Flying Hunt descended upon the [[Nelanther Isles]] and left many pirate ships ablaze off the coast of [[Tethyr]]. Before this event, they were only really known to pirates and [[Calimshan|Calishite]] slavers, mostly because their property had been destroyed by the same knights. A lot of mainlanders previously unaware of Nimbral were unsure what to feel about this event, on the one hand, they lauded the knights for destroying all of those pirate ships, on the other, they had no idea if the Nimbrese will restrict themselves to attacking pirates or begin raidng mainland cities. [[Halruaan Skyship]]s soon took to the air and headed towards Nimbral, but it is unknown what exactly their goal was, or if they succeeded. The skyships returned home and no more was said about it that wasn't pure speculation.<ref name=RL-TRoN1 />\n\nAt some point during the [[Spellplague]], the island of Nimbral vanished without a trace. Speculation abounded regarding its fate: some believed it had sunk beneath the waves, others posited that it had been concealed by powerful illusions, while yet another theory suggested it had been transported to a distant plane.<ref name=FRCG-p163>\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], not a single ship encountered the island in almost a century.<ref name=FRCG-p163 />\n\nAt some point in [[1483 DR]], after the [[Second Sundering]], ships claiming to be from Nimbral sailed into ports on the [[Sword Coast]] and in the [[Shining South]].<ref> The island's rulers maintained a secretive stance regarding the events surrounding Nimbral's disappearance and reappearance, leaving many unanswered questions about the island's history and the motives of its mysterious lords.<ref>",
