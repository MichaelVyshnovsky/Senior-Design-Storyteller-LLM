        "mainbody": "Ringlor Noroth, also known as the City of Soaring Shadows, was the largest settlement of cloakers in the Upperdark.\nIt was located in the Underdark beneath the Marching Mountains in Calimshan. The city was founded around an ancient and ruined bridge known as the Shadowspan, which connected the Lake of Radiant Mists to a mysterious lake located in the Shadowfell. The bridge was said to predate the dwarves of Old Shanatar, and had long since collapsed.\nThe city was ruled by a council of twelve cloaker lords known as the Shadoworb Conclave who took directions from a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell known as the \"Emissary\".\nThe cloakers of Rringlor Noroth ascribed to a rigid caste system.\nRinglor Noroth was founded when its twelve cloaker lords brought its population of cloakers together over ten thousand years prior the 14 century DR. If dwarven legends of its ancient history were to be believed, it had not changed at all in that time. However, sometime in the 12 century DR, the Shadoworb Conclave began a project to rebuild the Shadowspan in order to reconnect the lake on the Material Plane to its sister lake in the Shadowfell.\nCategorySmall cities\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryCloaker locations\nCategoryLocations in Old Shanatar\nCategoryLocations in the Upperdark\nCategoryLocations in the Underdark\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nk4lgm4n58txpe6xtngtam8sa1amszjq"
