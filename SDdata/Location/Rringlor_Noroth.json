        "Geography": "It was located in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Marching Mountains]] in [[Calimshan]]. The city was founded around an ancient and ruined bridge known as the [[Shadowspan]], which connected the [[Lake of Radiant Mists]] to a mysterious lake located in the [[Shadowfell]]. The bridge was said to predate the [[dwarves]] of [[Old Shanatar]], and had long since collapsed.",
        "Government": "The city was ruled by a council of twelve [[cloaker lords]] known as the [[Shadoworb Conclave]] who took directions from a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell known as the \"Emissary\".\n\nThe cloakers of Rringlor Noroth ascribed to a rigid caste system.",
        "History": "Ringlor Noroth was founded when its twelve cloaker lords brought its population of cloakers together over ten thousand years prior the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. If [[dwarf|dwarven]] legends of its ancient history were to be believed, it had not changed at all in that time. However, sometime in the 12{{th}} century DR, the Shadoworb Conclave began a project to rebuild the Shadowspan in order to reconnect the lake on the [[Material Plane]] to its sister lake in the Shadowfell.",
