        "Description": "The fortress of the [[Nentyarch]] in the [[Rawlinswood]] was a circle of immense trees, roughly over {{SI|0.5|miles|long=yes}} in diameter; these trunks were contiguous, touching and blending together at times, witho only the narrowest of paths existing between the trees, requiring a human-sized person to walk sideways through some of them. Those paths reached about twenty paces before reaching the inner side. After the [[Rotting Man]] captured the fortress in {{yearlink|1371}}, the trees became bare, petrified, and a faint greenish phosphorescence shone all over them, resembling an eldritch cliff from the inside.\n\nOn the inside, there had been fields of flowers and fruit trees, stone bridges, and paths between the gardens. Starting on {{yearlink|1371}}, the life had moldered to rot instead, leaving dry brooks full of nothing but worms and aggressive insects, the paths were full of mud, and the fruits had become blots of poisonous putrescence. There were great holes on the ground, reminiscent of a cemetery. From the inside, the tree ring forming The Close was carved with scores of openings, and held catwalks.\n\nDuring the Nentyarch's holding, there was a simple hardwood structure in the middle of the Court. In the Rotting Man's time, he had replaced it with a lone ash tree of towering size, more than {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}}, though still shorter than the petrified fairy ring. It was crowned with sickly green leaves forming an oval mass, with a twisted, blackened trunk holding a massive swollen cyst:{{cite book/Lady of Poison|276-281|29-30}} the [[Thieving Ash]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|288|30}} Ahead of the tree was a hardened, fetid mud throne, where the [[Rotting Man]] sat; before his throne was a rough stone altar, where he kept a magical flower with a petal for each of his [[Talontar blightlord]] living (or rather, animate) servants. The Rotting Man kept the arrangement hidden with a thick mist.",
        "Government": "The Close served as the seat of the [[Nentyarch]], the leader of the [[Circle of Leth]], in [[Dun-Tharos]]. When the Rotting Man took over, it served as his seat instead. After the Rotting Man retreated, Dun-Tharos was abandoned to [[demons]], including The Close.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|135}}",
        "Defenses": "The Close was defended by the forces of the [[Nentyarch]] until 1371, when it passed into the hands of the Rotting Man.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|118}} Neither had returned to defend it by {{yearlink|1497}}.",
        "History": "The fortress of magical trees was created by the [[Nentyarch]] atop the ruin of [[Dun-Tharos]] in {{yearlink|722}}.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|151}} Though he'd abandon the fortress in {{yearlink|1373}} after a battle with a servant of [[Lurue]],{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|154}} the Nentyarch had not returned by {{yearlink|1497}}.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|122}}",
