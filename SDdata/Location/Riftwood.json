The nearest settlement was Delzimmer, located to the southwest.\nThe trees of the forest formed in a neat circular forest in the eastern plains of the Shaar. They were bisected by the Rift River.\nUnlike the nearby tropical forests, the Riftwood featured fewer vines and less undergrowth.\nWithin the forest was a well-protected logging community of gold dwarves.\nIn addition to the dwarves, the Riftwood was home to a variety of animals and beasts, including snakes, panthers, and giant beetles."
