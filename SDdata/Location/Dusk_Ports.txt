The '''Dusk Ports''' were a collection of seemingly free trade cities on the western shores of the [[Dragon Sea (Abeir)|Dragon Sea]]. In reality, they were vassal states to the [[green dragon]] [[Orlarrakh]].

==Geography==
The Dusk Ports were located on the western shore of the Dragon Sea.
===Locations===
*'''[[Dusklan]]'''&mdash;A city of racial diversity that harbored escaped slaves, if only to use them as sacrifices to Orlarrakh.
* '''[[Lylorn]]'''&mdash;The dominant Dusk Port as of [[1479 DR]]. Lylorn boasted the most far-reaching trade network and the most aggressive sailors.
* '''[[Marrauk]]'''&mdash;A bleak and wind-scoured city in an equally desolate hillside, it featured a busy shipping trade and a fiercely defiant government.
* '''[[Mreyelundar]]'''&mdash;A city of lawlessness and home of the strange [[Order of the Dawn]]. It was the most actively anti-draconic of the five cities.
* '''[[Tarsith]]'''&mdash;A calm fishing community known for their exports of [[rock crab]]s and fine sailing equipment.

==Government==
Although in appearance each port was an independent and self-ruling state, rival to each other and never cooperating in anything, in reality all ports were under the thumb of Orlarrakh, the Green Duchess, who in turn was a vassal of the ruler of [[Melabrauth]].

==Background==
All cities of the Dusk Ports were rivals of those of the [[Windrise Ports]], not only because those cities were also trade ports, and therefore commercial rivals, but also because the Dusk Ports employed [[pirate]]s, a practice frowned upon in the Windrise Ports.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|56}}

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Dauna Lorastur]], the ruler of Marrauk in 1479 DR.
* [[Nandrel Gostur]], one of the richest persons in the Dusk Ports and a head member of the [[Shadowkiss]] in 1479 DR.
* [[Narnorn]], a legendary [[thief]] in Mreyelundar.
* [[Rhauron]], a notorious individual who lived in Tarsith in the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]].{{Cite dungeon/193/The Winking Eyes of Rhauron|69}}
* [[Rowan Babar]], the leader of the Order of the Dawn in 1479 DR.
* [[Zasheena Drethyl]], a head member of the Shadowkiss in 1479 DR.
