        "mainbody": "Bloodstone was the name for the barony (and later duchy) of Damara that lay within Bloodstone Pass, a narrow valley that crossed the Galena Mountains between Vaasa and Damara.\nThe barony of Bloodstone was ruled by the king of Vaasa and Damara, Gareth Dragonsbane. The last Baron of Bloodstone was Gareths father-in-law, Baron Tranth. Lordship passed to Gareth as a result of his magnificent leadership protecting Bloodstone Village from bandits, preventing evil priests from summoning Orcus to the material plane in the Bloodstone Mines, and defeating the Witch-King Zhengyi."
