The '''Wizards' Reach''' was the name given to the stretch of the [[Inner Sea]] lying between [[Chessenta]] and [[Aglarond]], and to the broad plain on the Aglarondan peninsula that stretched between the Inner Sea and the [[Yuirwood]].{{Cote book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|88-89}}

==Geography==
The coast was full of extensive tidal marshes and barrier islands.

==History==
The cities of the area were founded by [[Unther]]. Despite being adjacent, the Wizards' Reach was not a part of the nation of [[Aglarond]]. However, many fell under the control of [[Thay]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Following the [[Spellplague]] and the events of the [[War of the Zulkirs]], Aglarond claimed sovereignty over the Wizards' Reach.
