The Wizards Reach was the name given to the stretch of the Inner Sea lying between Chessenta and Aglarond, and to the broad plain on the Aglarondan peninsula that stretched between the Inner Sea and the Yuirwood.
The coast was full of extensive tidal marshes and barrier islands.
The cities of the area were founded by Unther. Despite being adjacent, the Wizards Reach was not a part of the nation of Aglarond. However, many fell under the control of Thay in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Following the Spellplague and the events of the War of the Zulkirs, Aglarond claimed sovereignty over the Wizards Reach.
