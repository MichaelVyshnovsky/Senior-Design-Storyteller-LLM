        "mainbody": "Vaasa () was an isolated and untamed land located in the Cold Lands of northeast Faerûn. It was the seat of power for the famed Zhengyi the Witch-King in the mid 14 century DR, and it was ruled by the Warlock Knights of Vaasa as of the late 15 century DR.\nVaasa was an empty and inhospitable land of rolling hills, frozen wastes, meager grasslands, and open tundra with sporadic farms and the occasional wandering monster. It was always cold, with icy and dry winds blowing off the Great Glacier to the north. The winters brought deep freezes, and in the summers, fog blanketed the land and frigid waters from melting ice turned much of the tundra into boggy mud that was better traversed with sleds than wagons.\nVaasa was the westernmost realm of the so-called Cold Lands. It was bordered to the north by the Great Glacier and surrounded to the south by the arc of the Galena and West Galena Mountains. Bloodstone Pass allowed access through the Galenas to Damara in the east, and these two nations were collectively known as the Bloodstone Lands. The West Galenas separated Vaasa from the lands of the Moonsea North to the west and from the Moonsea itself to the south.\nMost folk who settled in Vaasa did so in the Sunderland region in the southeast where they had access to both the gem- and metal-rich Galena Mountains as well as rare workable soil for raising crops and livestock. This region was dominated by the towns of Darmshall and Maur-Eturo.\nthumb|right|250px|An orc navigates the snowy tundra of Vaasa.Vaasa was a realm of tundra, taking the form of moorlands in the west, wasteland in the north, and plains in the south.\nEvery summer, the Great Glacier continued its retreat, inundating the tundra with icemelt and turning the land into mud&mdashdeep enough to reach a horses stomach and treacherous enough that it could trap and drown unwary travelers&mdashespecially in the western moors where the Bottomless Bogs formed. This morass of muddy swampland was seasonal during the 14 century DR, but over the decades it became a permanent feature of the landscape. What icemelt did not seep into the mud found its way into the Beaumaris River, which meandered from the Bogs through the central highlands at the bottom of a great gorge, known as the Clefts of Razack, before arriving in the eastern lowlands and exiting Vaasa through Bloodstone Pass. The river bisected the realm, with the arid badlands of the Cinnabar Wastes in the north and the shortgrass steppes of Haatar-Baen and the Sunderland in the south.\nBecause the Great Glacier kept melting, the northern border of Vaasa kept shifting northward. Between the 14 and 15 centuries DR, the Ice Run&mdashlabyrinthine ice formations in the Glacier’s edge&mdashhad melted away, thus adding the Lugsaas Chain Mountains to the landscape.\nLittle grew naturally in Vaasa save for the grasses of the southern steppes. There were no forests, and what few clumps of trees could be found were as often dead as alive. and Vaasan farmers cultivated a type of maize known as moon corn. However, the southwestern grasslands along the West Galena Mountains were locally known as the \"Bleak Steppes\" of Haatar-Baen because the soil was tainted and everything that grew in the area was inevitably poisonous.\nThe land was inhospitable to all but the most hardy creatures and monsters. elk, giant insects (including boring beetles, leeches, ticks, and wasps), moon dogs,, snakes (including glacier snakes, venomous black snakes, Near the mountains and the Glacier to the north, it was not uncommon to encounter white dragons, white puddings, winter wolves, and polar bears, not to mention remorhaz, so much so that hunting and killing a remorhaz was considered a right of passage among the White Worm barbarian tribe. The eastern and central badlands were home to chromatic dragons, bulettes, and other similarly foul creatures. In the south, leucrotta stalked the steppes cave trolls, and owlbears haunted the mountains. Vaasans were known to tame the local griffons as mounts. In the bogs to the west, trolls In the summer months, the droning and biting of mosquitoes and horseflies was constant.\nFor much of its existence, Vaasa was largely unclaimed and lawless outside of a few close-knit communities, and even when controlled by one kingdom or another, much of the land was devoid of civilization save for scattered frontier towns occasionally defended by a keep or abbey. \nThe realm was conquered and ruled for a decade in the mid 14 century DR by the tyrannical Zhengyi the Witch-King before returning to its frontier status through the rest of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nFrom the late 14 century DR through the mid–15 century DR, Vaasa was a barony of the Kingdom of Bloodstone, ruled by King Gareth Dragonsbane and his heirs.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Vaasa was a feudal society in which all power rested with the Warlock Knights. Anyone who was not a member of the Knights was considered a lowly serf or a slave. All landowning nobility were members of the Knights called Fellthanes, who exercised total control over their fiefdoms and the people living within them. These fellthanes in turn were vassals of more powerful Knights known as Vindicators.\nThe seat of the Warlock Knights power was Telos City, where the Ironfell Council deliberated on matters of state within the grand Citadel of the Iron Sky. As these councilors had to journey from their holdings across Vaasa, they held court infrequently and often for no more than a total of five days out of each month.\nVaasa was a land rich in mineral resources. The Galenas were full of iron, silver, and copper as well as gemstones, including emerald and ruby but especially bloodstone.\n14 Century\nthumb|left|320px|A map of Vaasa circa 1358 DR.As much of the land remained unclaimed, there were many prospectors who came to Vaasa seeking its natural treasures in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. Barter was also extremely common as the tools and supplies for survival could be far more valuable than gold to the average Vaasan. While some trade also occurred across the West Galenas to the Moonsea via Garumns Climb, more often than not this route was seldom used unless there were problems with the usual trade routes through Damara. \nVaasas major imports were weapons and food. and their workhorses came from both the Nars and Sosser breeds.\n15 Century\nthumb|right|320px|A map of Vaasa and the Moonsea North circa 1479 DR.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the Warlock Knights had transformed the Vaasan Gate into the \"Iron Divide,\" completely sealing the Pass and using the Gate solely as a military fortification. However, this was seen as too long and too dangerous to be sustainable, even after incorporating the Beaumaris River between Moortown and Kond as part of the imports route. To solve the need for a faster route to the Moonsea, the Knights opened Grambles Climb in the spring of 1480 DR for a direct link between southeastern Vaasa and Hulburg.\nDuring this time, farming and ranching flourished in Darmshall and Maur-Eturo. Meat and milk were produced from large herds of rothé and krotter.\nThe Warlock Knights minted their own currency in Telos City using alloys of traditional precious metals with ironfell. The copper-based coins were called nubs, the silver-based coins were called dirks, and the gold-based coins were called anvils. Platinum was not minted into coins but was instead exchanged in thin ingots worth 50 anvils.\nVaasan people had a bad reputation for ruthlessness, and while it was certainly true that their culture was largely informed by the harshness of their environment, it was tempered by the influence of Damaran culture from the east.\nAs with most nations in the so-called Demonlands, Vaasa used the Impilturan Calendar, although in particular they spoke a guttural Many Vaasans also spoke some Dwarvish, Orcish, Chondathan, or Uluik, and knowing Goblin, Giant, or even Abyssal was not unheard of.\nArcane magic was mistrusted but not unfamiliar to the people of Vaasa. With the rise of the Warlock Knights, however, the the practice of magic became strictly regulated as the Knights feared it could be used against them. Thus, any who wished to study magic had to first swear lifelong loyalty to the Knights as a nishaadhri (meaning \"bound one\").\nDuring the latter half of the 15 century, the frontier-like spirit of Vaasa would be overshadowed by the oppressive class system put in place by the Warlock Knights. Only high-ranking Knights were entitled to own land, and all others served them as lower-ranking Knights, serfs, or slaves. Lower-ranking Knights ranged from the equivalent of landless nobility to conscripted serfs, and even these lowliest of indentured infantry saw the benefits of membership with the Knights as compared to being a serf. Any who did not aspire to join the Knights instead aspired to avoid attracting their attention at all costs.\nAnyone not associated with the Knights was automatically considered a serf in the eyes of the law, and even the lowliest of Warlock Knights had the right to kill a serf on the spot. These serfs toiled on the Knights land, barely scraping by, and lived in much worse conditions than most common folk across Faerûn. The serfs themselves were further stratified by race. Nearly all of the Warlock Knights were human, and non-human serfs were considered lesser than human ones in their eyes. This predominantly included the dwarves, half-orcs, and orcs of Vaasa, as well as the \"scamps,\" a derogatory term for any of the more diminutive races, including goblins, kobolds, and halflings.\nFinally, the lowest rung on the ladder were the slaves. Most non-human inhabitants of Vaasa were enslaved, although there was nothing stopping the Knights from enslaving whomever they wished within their domain. Slave labor was the driving force behind the mining operations that generated most of Vaasas wealth and slaves were used as the bulk of the Warlock Knights armies.\nIn general, Vaasans cared little for the religion of their neighbors, which allowed many faiths to flourish in the 14 century DR, even less reputable ones. Auril, Bane, and Cyric had notable followings, and one of the legacies of Zhengyi the Witch-King was an enduring population of Orcus worshipers led by the Cult of the Goats Head. As for good or lawful deities, Tyr had a following as did Ilmater, who was particularly popular given that hardship and suffering were endemic to life in Vaasa. The Ilmatari faith was further encouraged by Gareth Dragonsbane and the Order of the Golden Cup. \nThanks to the large populations of orcs and half-orcs, worship of the orc pantheon was quite common, and likewise the longtime presence of the dwarves meant that the Morndinsamman were popular as well. Worship of the stone giant god Skoraeus Stonebones was unusually common among the goblinoids and giantkin of the Galenas, and Tempus was popular among the barbarians and nomads nearer to the Great Glacier.\nWith the rise of the Warlock Knights came a crackdown on religion, and worship of gods like Ilmater was banned among the serfs.\nVaasas strongest defensive asset was the land itself. Winters were harsh enough to destroy an army outright and summers brought on sucking mud that made marches arduous. Owing to the ever present dangers, most Vaasans in the 14 century DR had some training as fighters and were familiar with the use of splint mail and the heavy or light mace.\nDuring the reign of the Warlock Knights in the 15 century DR, Vaasa was defended by their fearsome standing armies bolstered by conscripted infantry, slave soldiers,\nIn the mythic past, the lands that would one day be Vaasa were part of the giant empire of Ostoria. The area was always known to be rich in gemstones, and the dwarves established mining settlements in the region, including the twin mines of Delhalls and Talagbar. It wasn’t until the , that the Glacier began steadily melting, starting a centuries-long retreat northward that freed Vaasa, Damara, and Narfell from the ice for the first time in millennia.\nAt this time, the edges of the Glacier were inhabited by tribes of nomadic humans, including the White Worm tribe, and as the ice melted they were followed by dwarven clans who settled the Galena Mountains. These waves of settlers swiftly pushed Vaasas native herds of mammoth further and further east until there were no more left.\nFor the first two centuries after the Glacier began retreating, Vaasa had little contact with or relevance to the rest of the Realms aside from serving as an inhospitable northern route for Damaran caravans to reach the Moonsea. Vaasa was often ignored by scholars and assumed by most to be an uncivilized frozen wasteland. Additionally, Vaasa was home to the great explorer Palus Frohm, who launched a 20 year expedition to the Great Glacier starting in the . Based on this experience, he wrote the definitive guide to arctic regions, Blood and Ice Survival in the Great Glacier.\nthumb|right|245px|Castle Perilous on the Vaasan tundra, circa 1359 DR.Evil began arising in Vaasa in the early-to-mid 14 century DR, and Vaasas reputation would be forever changed in the  when the lich Zhengyi the Witch-King appeared.The Forgotten Realms campaign sets for both the 1st edition (set 1357 DR) and 2nd edition (set 1368 DR) give Zhengyis appearance as happening \"20 years ago.\" The 3rd edition onward continued from the date established in the 2nd edition, and uses the year 1347 DR. He raised Castle Perilous over the course of a single night, immediately claimed sovereignty of his new \"Kingdom of Vaasa\", and began recruiting an army of mercenaries, bandits, evil Vaasans, giants, monstrous humanoids, magical beasts&mdashincluding many chromatic dragons&mdashas well as raising a host of undead towards his cause of conquest. Within a year, he had full control of the region and had invaded neighboring Damara in what would come to be known as the Vaasan War. During this time, the Kingdom of Vaasa became feared as one of the most powerful realms in Faerûn. Within the Kingdom, evil religious practices flourished, and the locals were soon outnumbered by foreign mercenaries in service to the reclusive and evil Zhengyi,\nZhengyi would be defeated two years later in the Bloodstone Wars of the , when Gareth Dragonsbane and a company of adventurers stormed Castle Perilous and severed Zhengyis link to Orcus, thus breaking the power of his undead armies. Despite his defeat and the destruction of Castle Perilous, Zhengyis legacy and fears of his possible return continued to pollute the area for over a century.\nWith the defeat of the Witch-King, Vaasa returned to a land of independent settlers, and a growing presence of worshipers of Tiamat at Castle Perilous. Gareth Dragonsbane, who had become King of Damara, made great efforts to fortify Bloodstone Pass against future incursions from Vaasa, including building the Vaasan Gate, offering huge bounties for evil humanoids and bandits from the region, the creation of which had been a goal of his since he united Damara. This began to bear fruit when Palischuk all but swore fealty to his kingdom outright circa the , when he defeated a rival claim to the area from Bregan Daerthe.\nThe most serious threat to Gareth Dragonsbanes growing power in Vaasa came in the , when Sammaster, leader of the Cult of the Dragon, unleashed the Rage of Dragons and began masquerading as a returned Zhengyi. This false Witch-King rallied an army of monstrous humanoids, giants, and raging dragons, and his horde seized the Vaasan and Damaran Gates in a single night on Mirtul 3, then invaded Damara. While this Witch-King was defeated fairly quickly, it took many months to rout the remains of his army and to reclaim the Vaasan Gate, Even after the Cult of the Dragons defeat, it maintained cells in Vaasa and their agents would remain active near Moortown for over a century.\nSoon after, Gareth Dragonsbane annexed the region into his kingdom as the Barony of Vaasa\nAt some point in the early 1370s DR, Gareth Dragonsbane appointed Rannek of Nesmé, Zhai of Cedarleaf, and Illius of Silverymoon as the first rulers of Vaasa.\nDuring the rule of the Dragonsbanes, Vaasa was a peaceful if still largely inhospitable land. It continued to draw immigrants, especially from Impiltur. The Great Glacier would continue its retreat northwards to beyond the Lugsaas Chain Mountains, freeing the ruins of the ancient giant kingdom of Kultaakarr from the ice.\nThis relatively peaceful time in Vaasa began to change after a shooting star landed in the tundra sometime after the Spellplague, which led to the formation of the Warlock Knights. The Knights were patient, but began subjugating small settlements of peasants while conscripting evil humanoids, ultimately marshalling an army of conscripts, slaves, and monsters by the . As the Kingdom of Bloodstone was distracted by political infighting, the Knights declared open rebellion in the .\nOver the next decade of war, the Warlock Knights would brutally conquer Vaasa, By this point, their conquests had driven thousands of Vaasan people and humanoids from their homes, and with Bloodstone Pass closed, these refugees gathered in tent cities or sought refuge in the Knights own capital of Telos.\nUnder the Warlock Knights, Vaasa was structured as a feudal system with all nobles and landowning lords belonging to the Knights. The majority of the human population became trapped in serfdom and much of the non-human population was forced into slavery or indentured servitude. \nIn the , a large earthquake struck Vaasa, causing the ruins of Castle Perilous to rejuvenate mysteriously into an imposing dark fortress. This heralded a fracturing in the Knights ruling Ironfell Council when one member, Mansard Kanaoth, began opposing the ruling Voice of Telos and secretly declared himself to be the new Witch-King.\nBy the , the Warlock Knights had turned an expansionist eye toward their neighbors, all of whom viewed the Knights as among the greatest threats in Faerûn. By the , tensions between Vaasa and neighboring Damara were nearing a boiling point.\nVaasa was a land with two distinct populations. The first were the more civilized folk, including Vaasan and Damaran humans in the Sunderland and southern cities, half-orcs and Sossrim humans in Palischuk to the north, and shield dwarves in the Galena mountains. These folk were largely farmers, trappers, and miners. The second population consisted of the nomadic tribes who inhabited the mountains and the wilds, mostly consisting of grey orcs, goblinoids, giants, and human barbarians. These tribal humanoids vastly outnumbered the civilized folk as much as 25-to-1 in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Some nomadic tribes were known to turn to cannibalism when food was scarce.\nVaasa was also home to smaller pockets of more isolated groups, such as arctic dwarves. The Underdark beneath Vaasa, particularly beneath the Galena mountains, was home to drow and duergar.\nThe humans who called themselves Vaasans were not a particularly honorable people, but they tended to honor their promises. They were persistent and sly hagglers with little sense of etiquette. Folk wore their hair and beards long, Marriages were referred to as \"life pledges.\"\nthumb|left|320px|A map of Vaasa circa 1368 DR.\nCities\n*Telos City, the capital of Vaasa and its largest city under the rule of the Warlock Knights.\n*Palischuk, a once-destroyed city rebuilt and occupied by half-orcs which had grown to be Vaasas wealthiest  and second largest city as a trade hub under the Warlock Knights.\n*Darmshall, a small fortress-village founded by the Tenblades adventuring company which grew to become Vaasas third largest city under the Warlock Knights.\nSettlements\n*Avang, a trade stopover on the western edge of Vaasa.\n*Fugue, a tent city of refugees trying to escape through Bloodstone Pass.\n*Hillsafar Hall, a heavily fortified Dwarven fortress that sat at the entrance to the mines of Clan Hillsafar.\n*Ishe, an outpost in Vaasas far north.\n*Kond, a town and trade outpost built into the cliffs above the Beaumaris River.\n*Maur-Eturo, a ranching town located at the intersection of the main trade routes through Vaasa.\n*Modurt, a town inhabited largely by goblins.\n*Moortown, a settlement in the Bottomless Bogs located on the Beaumaris River.\nPoints of interest\n*The Black Holes of Sunderland, a network of monster-infested caves in the southeast.\n*Castle Perilous, the ruined former home of Zhengyi the Witch-King which mysteriously rejuvenated in 1477 DR.\n*The Delhalls and Talagbar, twin Dwarven mines on opposite ends of Vaasa.\n* The Granite Tower, a secluded keep that served as the home of descendants of the Moor Eagle tribe.\n*The Vaasan Gate, a massive fortress at the entrance to Bloodstone Pass that was later called the Iron Divide.\n*Shrine of the Tear, a shrine built to house the Tear of Selûne following the Dawn Cataclysm.\nRoads, passes, and waterways\n* The Beaumaris River, the main waterway which bisected the realm.\n*Bloodstone Pass, the critical route through the Galena Mountains connecting Vaasa to Damara.\n*Dead Mans Walk, the primary east-west route across Vaasa.\n*Garumns Climb, a mountain pass which connected western Vaasa to the Moonsea North.\n*Grambles Climb, a mountain pass which connected southern Vaasa to Hulburg on the Moonsea.\n*The High Walk, a mountain pass which connected northeastern Vaasa to Soravia in Damara.\n*The Howling Kupuk, a mountain pass which connected northeastern Vaasa to Alpuk.\n*The Ice Run, a series tunnels in the Great Glacier.
