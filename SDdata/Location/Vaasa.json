        "mainbody": "Vaasa was a land with two distinct populations. The first were the more civilized folk, including [[Vaasan]] and [[Damaran]] [[humans]] in the [[Sunderland]] and southern cities, [[half-orcs]] and [[Sossrim]] humans in [[Palischuk]] to the north, and [[shield dwarves]] in the Galena mountains. These folk were largely farmers, trappers, and miners. The second population consisted of the nomadic tribes who inhabited the mountains and the wilds, mostly consisting of [[grey orcs]], [[goblinoids]], [[giants]], and human [[barbarians]]. These tribal humanoids vastly outnumbered the civilized folk as much as 25-to-1 in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Some nomadic tribes were known to turn to cannibalism when food was scarce.\n\nVaasa was also home to smaller pockets of more isolated groups, such as [[arctic dwarves]]. The [[Underdark]] beneath Vaasa, particularly beneath the Galena mountains, was home to [[drow]] and [[duergar]].\n\nThe humans who called themselves Vaasans were not a particularly honorable people, but they tended to honor their promises. They were persistent and sly hagglers with little sense of etiquette.{{Cite digital book/The Summoning}} Folk wore their hair and beards long,{{Cite digital book/The Sorcerer}} Marriages were referred to as \"life pledges.\"",
        "Description": "Vaasa was an empty and inhospitable land of rolling hills, frozen wastes, meager grasslands, and open tundra with sporadic farms and the occasional wandering monster. It was always cold, with icy and dry winds blowing off the [[Great Glacier]] to the north. The winters brought deep freezes, and in the summers, fog blanketed the land{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|59}} and frigid waters from melting ice turned much of the tundra into boggy mud that was better traversed with [[sledge|sleds]] than [[wagon]]s.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "[[File:Surefooted.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An orc navigates the snowy tundra of Vaasa.]]Vaasa was a realm of tundra, taking the form of moorlands in the west, wasteland in the north, and plains in the south.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}\n\nEvery summer, the Great Glacier continued its retreat, inundating the tundra with icemelt and turning the land into mud&mdash;deep enough to reach a horse's stomach and treacherous enough that it could trap and drown unwary travelers{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|58}}&mdash;especially in the western moors where the [[Bottomless Bogs]] formed. This morass of muddy swampland was seasonal during the 14{{th}} century DR, but over the decades it became a permanent feature of the landscape. What icemelt did not seep into the mud found its way into the [[Beaumaris River]], which meandered from the Bogs through the central highlands at the bottom of a great gorge, known as the [[Clefts of Razack]], before arriving in the eastern lowlands and exiting Vaasa through Bloodstone Pass. The river bisected the realm, with the arid badlands of the [[Cinnabar Wastes]] in the north and the shortgrass steppes of [[Haatar-Baen]] and the Sunderland in the south.\n\nBecause the Great Glacier kept melting, the northern border of Vaasa kept shifting northward. Between the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries DR, the [[Ice Run]]&mdash;labyrinthine ice formations in the Glacier’s edge&mdash;had melted away, thus adding the [[Lugsaas Chain]] Mountains to the landscape.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "Little grew naturally in Vaasa save for the grasses of the southern steppes. There were no forests, and what few clumps of trees could be found were as often dead as alive. and Vaasan farmers cultivated a type of [[maize]] known as [[moon corn]]. However, the southwestern grasslands along the West Galena Mountains were locally known as the \"Bleak Steppes\" of Haatar-Baen because the soil was tainted and everything that grew in the area was inevitably poisonous.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|57}}\n\nThe land was inhospitable to all but the most hardy creatures and monsters.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|60}} [[elk]], [[giant insect]]s (including [[boring beetle]]s, [[giant leech|leeches]], [[giant tick|ticks]], and [[giant wasp|wasps]]),{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|62}} [[moon dog]]s,, [[snake]]s (including [[glacier snake]]s, venomous black snakes, Near the mountains and the Glacier to the north, it was not uncommon to encounter [[white dragon]]s, [[white pudding]]s, [[winter wolves]], and [[polar bear|polar bears]], not to mention [[remorhaz]], so much so that hunting and killing a remorhaz was considered a right of passage among the [[White Worm]] [[barbarian]] tribe. The eastern and central badlands were home to [[chromatic dragons]], [[bulette|bulettes]], and other similarly foul creatures. In the south, [[leucrotta]] stalked the steppes [[cave troll]]s, and [[Owlbear|owlbears]] haunted the mountains. Vaasans were known to tame the local [[griffon]]s as mounts. In the bogs to the west, [[troll]]s In the summer months, the droning and biting of [[mosquito]]es and horseflies was constant."
        },
        "Government": {
            "The Warlock Knights": "As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Vaasa was a feudal society in which all power rested with the [[Warlock Knights]]. Anyone who was not a member of the Knights was considered a lowly serf or a slave.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|29,31}} All landowning nobility were members of the Knights called Fellthanes, who exercised total control over their fiefdoms and the people living within them. These fellthanes in turn were vassals of more powerful Knights known as Vindicators.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}}\n\nThe seat of the Warlock Knights' power was [[Telos City]], where the Ironfell Council deliberated on matters of state within the grand [[Citadel of the Iron Sky]]. As these councilors had to journey from their holdings across Vaasa, they held court infrequently and often for no more than a total of five days out of each month."
        },
        "Trade": "Vaasa was a land rich in mineral resources. The Galenas were full of [[iron]], [[silver]], and [[copper]] as well as [[Gem|gemstones]], including [[emerald]] and [[ruby]] but especially [[bloodstone]].\n\n;14{{th}} Century\n[[File:2e_BloodstoneLands_p8_Vaasa_map.png|thumb|left|320px|A map of Vaasa ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].]]As much of the land remained unclaimed, there were many prospectors who came to Vaasa seeking its natural treasures in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. Barter was also extremely common as the tools and supplies for survival could be far more valuable than [[gold]] to the average Vaasan. While some trade also occurred across the West Galenas to the Moonsea via [[Garumn's Climb]], more often than not this route was seldom used unless there were problems with the usual trade routes through Damara. \n\nVaasa's major imports were weapons and food. and their [[horse|workhorses]] came from both the [[Nars]] and [[Sosser]] breeds.\n\n;15{{th}} Century\n[[File:4e Vaasa map.PNG|thumb|right|320px|A map of Vaasa and the Moonsea North ''circa'' [[1479 DR]].]]\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Warlock Knights had transformed the Vaasan Gate into the \"Iron Divide,\" completely sealing the Pass and using the Gate solely as a military fortification.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|59}} However, this was seen as too long and too dangerous to be sustainable, even after incorporating the Beaumaris River between [[Moortown]] and [[Kond]] as part of the imports route.{{Cite digital book/Hero/Kindle||11}} To solve the need for a faster route to the Moonsea, the Knights opened [[Gramble's Climb]] in the spring of [[1480 DR]] for a direct link between southeastern Vaasa and [[Hulburg]].\n\nDuring this time, farming and ranching flourished in Darmshall and Maur-Eturo. Meat and [[milk]] were produced from large herds of [[rothé]] and [[krotter]].\n\nThe Warlock Knights minted their own [[currency]] in Telos City using alloys of traditional precious metals with [[ironfell|''ironfell'']]. The copper-based coins were called [[nub (coin)|nubs]], the silver-based coins were called [[dirk (coin)|dirks]], and the gold-based coins were called [[anvil (coin)|anvils]]. Platinum was not minted into coins but was instead exchanged in thin ingots worth 50 anvils.",
        "Culture": {
            "Feudal Hierarchy": "During the latter half of the 15{{th}} century, the frontier-like spirit of Vaasa would be overshadowed by the oppressive class system put in place by the Warlock Knights. Only high-ranking Knights were entitled to own land, and all others served them as lower-ranking Knights, serfs, or slaves. Lower-ranking Knights ranged from the equivalent of landless nobility to conscripted serfs, and even these lowliest of indentured infantry saw the benefits of membership with the Knights as compared to being a serf. Any who did not aspire to join the Knights instead aspired to avoid attracting their attention at all costs.\n\nAnyone not associated with the Knights was automatically considered a serf in the eyes of the law, and even the lowliest of Warlock Knights had the right to kill a serf on the spot. These serfs toiled on the Knights' land, barely scraping by, and lived in much worse conditions than most common folk across [[Faerûn]]. The serfs themselves were further stratified by race. Nearly all of the Warlock Knights were [[human]], and non-human serfs were considered lesser than human ones in their eyes. This predominantly included the [[dwarf|dwarves]], [[half-orcs]], and [[orcs]] of Vaasa, as well as the \"scamps,\" a derogatory term for any of the more diminutive races, including [[goblins]], [[kobolds]], and [[halflings]].\n\nFinally, the lowest rung on the ladder were the [[Slavery|slaves]]. Most non-human inhabitants of Vaasa were enslaved, although there was nothing stopping the Knights from enslaving whomever they wished within their domain. Slave labor was the driving force behind the mining operations that generated most of Vaasa's wealth and slaves were used as the bulk of the Warlock Knights' armies.",
            "Religion": "In general, Vaasans cared little for the religion of their neighbors, which allowed many faiths to flourish in the 14{{th}} century DR, even less reputable ones. [[Auril]], [[Bane]], and [[Cyric]] had notable followings, and one of the legacies of Zhengyi the Witch-King was an enduring population of [[Orcus]] worshipers led by the [[Cult of the Goat's Head]].{{Cite polyhedron/103/Forgotten Deities: Amaunator|7}} As for [[good]] or [[lawful]] deities, [[Tyr]] had a following as did [[Ilmater]], who was particularly popular given that hardship and suffering were endemic to life in Vaasa. The [[Church of Ilmater|Ilmatari faith]] was further encouraged by Gareth Dragonsbane and the [[Order of the Golden Cup]]. \n\nThanks to the large populations of orcs and half-orcs, worship of the [[orc pantheon]] was quite common, and likewise the longtime presence of the dwarves meant that the [[Morndinsamman]] were popular as well. Worship of the [[stone giant]] god [[Skoraeus Stonebones]] was unusually common among the goblinoids and giantkin of the Galenas, and [[Tempus]] was popular among the barbarians and nomads nearer to the Great Glacier.\n\nWith the rise of the Warlock Knights came a crackdown on religion, and worship of gods like Ilmater was banned among the serfs."
        },
        "Defenses": "Vaasa's strongest defensive asset was the land itself. Winters were harsh enough to destroy an army outright and summers brought on sucking mud that made marches arduous. Owing to the ever present dangers, most Vaasans in the 14{{th}} century DR had some training as [[fighters]] and were familiar with the use of [[splint mail]] and the [[heavy mace|heavy]] or [[light mace|light]] [[mace]].\n\nDuring the reign of the Warlock Knights in the 15{{th}} century DR, Vaasa was defended by their fearsome standing armies bolstered by conscripted infantry, slave soldiers,",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "In the mythic past, the lands that would one day be Vaasa were part of the [[giant]] empire of [[Ostoria]]. The area was always known to be rich in gemstones, and the [[dwarf|dwarves]] established mining settlements in the region, including the twin mines of [[Delhalls]] and [[Talagbar]]. It wasn’t until the {{YearlinkName|1038}}, that the Glacier began steadily melting, starting a centuries-long retreat northward that freed Vaasa, Damara, and [[Narfell]] from the ice for the first time in millennia.\n\nAt this time, the edges of the Glacier were inhabited by tribes of nomadic [[humans]], including the [[White Worm]] tribe, and as the ice melted they were followed by dwarven clans who settled the Galena Mountains. These waves of settlers swiftly pushed Vaasa's native herds of [[mammoth]] further and further east until there were no more left.\n\nFor the first two centuries after the Glacier began retreating, Vaasa had little contact with or relevance to the rest of the Realms aside from serving as an inhospitable northern route for Damaran caravans to reach the [[Moonsea]]. Vaasa was often ignored by scholars and assumed by most to be an uncivilized frozen wasteland. Additionally, Vaasa was home to the great explorer [[Palus Frohm]], who launched a 20 year expedition to the Great Glacier starting in the {{YearlinkName|1227}}. Based on this experience, he wrote the definitive guide to arctic regions, 'Blood and Ice: Survival in the Great Glacier'.",
            "The 14{{th}} Century DR": "[[File:CastlePerilous_ThroneOfBloodstone.png|thumb|right|245px|Castle Perilous on the Vaasan tundra, ''circa'' 1359 DR.]]Evil began arising in Vaasa in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century DR, and Vaasa's reputation would be forever changed in the {{YearlinkName|1347}} when the [[lich]] [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] appeared.The [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign sets for both the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set|1st edition]] (set [[1357 DR]]) and [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition|2nd edition]] (set [[1368 DR]]) give Zhengyi's appearance as happening \"20 years ago.\" The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|3rd edition]] onward continued from the date established in the 2nd edition, and uses the year [[1347 DR]]. He raised [[Castle Perilous]] over the course of a single night, immediately claimed sovereignty of his new \"Kingdom of Vaasa\", and began recruiting an army of mercenaries, bandits, evil Vaasans, giants, monstrous humanoids, magical beasts&mdash;including many chromatic dragons&mdash;as well as raising a host of undead towards his cause of conquest. Within a year, he had full control of the region and had invaded neighboring Damara in what would come to be known as the [[Vaasan War]]. During this time, the Kingdom of Vaasa became feared as one of the most powerful realms in Faerûn. Within the Kingdom, evil religious practices flourished, and the locals were soon outnumbered by foreign mercenaries in service to the reclusive and evil Zhengyi,\n\nZhengyi would be defeated two years later in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] of the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, when [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and a company of adventurers stormed Castle Perilous and severed Zhengyi's link to [[Orcus]], thus breaking the power of his undead armies. Despite his defeat and the destruction of Castle Perilous, Zhengyi's legacy and fears of his possible return continued to pollute the area for over a century.\n\nWith the defeat of the Witch-King, Vaasa returned to a land of independent settlers, and a growing presence of worshipers of Tiamat at Castle Perilous. Gareth Dragonsbane, who had become King of Damara, made great efforts to fortify Bloodstone Pass against future incursions from Vaasa, including building the [[Vaasan Gate]], offering huge bounties for evil humanoids and bandits from the region, the creation of which had been a goal of his since he united Damara. This began to bear fruit when Palischuk all but swore fealty to his kingdom outright ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, when he defeated a rival claim to the area from [[Bregan D'aerthe]].\n\nThe most serious threat to Gareth Dragonsbane's growing power in Vaasa came in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, when [[Sammaster]], leader of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], unleashed the [[Rage of Dragons]] and began masquerading as a returned Zhengyi. This false Witch-King rallied an army of monstrous humanoids, giants, and raging dragons, and his horde seized the Vaasan and [[Damaran Gate]]s in a single night on [[Mirtul 3]], then invaded Damara. While this Witch-King was defeated fairly quickly, it took many months to rout the remains of his army and to reclaim the Vaasan Gate, Even after the Cult of the Dragon's defeat, it maintained cells in Vaasa and their agents would remain active near Moortown for over a century.\n\nSoon after, Gareth Dragonsbane annexed the region into his kingdom as the Barony of Vaasa\n\nAt some point in the early 1370s DR, Gareth Dragonsbane appointed [[Rannek]] of [[Nesmé]], [[Zhai]] of [[Cedarleaf]], and [[Illius]] of [[Silverymoon]] as the first rulers of Vaasa.",
            "The 15{{th}} Century DR": "During the rule of the [[Dragonbane Dynasty|Dragonsbanes]], Vaasa was a peaceful if still largely inhospitable land. It continued to draw immigrants, especially from Impiltur. The Great Glacier would continue its retreat northwards to beyond the [[Lugsaas Chain|Lugsaas Chain Mountains]], freeing the ruins of the ancient [[giant]] kingdom of [[Kultaakarr]] from the ice.\n\nThis relatively peaceful time in Vaasa began to change after a [[Telos|shooting star]] landed in the tundra sometime after the [[Spellplague]], which led to the formation of the [[Warlock Knights]]. The Knights were patient, but began subjugating small settlements of peasants while conscripting evil humanoids, ultimately marshalling an army of conscripts, slaves, and monsters by the {{YearlinkName|1459}}. As the Kingdom of Bloodstone was distracted by political infighting, the Knights declared open rebellion in the {{YearlinkName|1460}}.\n\nOver the next decade of war, the Warlock Knights would brutally conquer Vaasa,{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}} By this point, their conquests had driven thousands of Vaasan people and humanoids from their homes, and with Bloodstone Pass closed, these refugees gathered in [[Fugue (settlement)|tent cities]] or sought refuge in the Knights' own capital of [[Telos (city)|Telos]].\n\nUnder the Warlock Knights, Vaasa was structured as a feudal system with all nobles and landowning lords belonging to the Knights. The majority of the human population became trapped in serfdom and much of the non-human population was forced into slavery or indentured servitude. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, a large earthquake struck Vaasa, causing the ruins of Castle Perilous to rejuvenate mysteriously into an imposing dark fortress. This heralded a fracturing in the Knights' ruling Ironfell Council when one member, [[Mansard Kanaoth]], began opposing the ruling Voice of Telos and secretly declared himself to be the new Witch-King.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Warlock Knights had turned an expansionist eye toward their neighbors, all of whom viewed the Knights as among the greatest threats in Faerûn. By the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, tensions between Vaasa and neighboring Damara were nearing a boiling point."
