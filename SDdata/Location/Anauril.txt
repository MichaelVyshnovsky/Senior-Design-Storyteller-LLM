'''Anauril''', also known as the '''City of Swords''' was the one of the cities of ancient [[Anauria]].

==Geography==
The city was located northeast of [[Amazandar]] the capital of Anauria, just due west of the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]].

==Trade==
Anauril was famous for the great quality [[steel]]s swords crafted by the finest smiths in all the [[Moonsea|lands]] north of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]]. They were often granted [[item enchantment|enchantments]] by the [[mage]]s of [[House Nyntynel]] and [[House Olyrnn]].

==History==
The city was founded some time after [[Netheril]]'s fall in {{Yearlink|-339}}, as the enclave of Anauria grew into a grand kingdom.

In the {{YearlinkName|111}}, [[goblinoid]] and [[orc]]ish forces led by the shaman [[Andegril|Andegril the Wise]], caused the collapse of the kingdom of Anauria and all of the cities within.<ref group="note">According to pages 116 of ''[[Netheril: Empire of Magic|Netheril Empire of Magic: The Winds of Netheril]]'', this event occurred in [[450 DR]]. This is direct conflict with a statement on page 12 of the same book that says the kingdom fell in [[111 DR|3970 Netheril Year]], or 111 DR. Nearly all of the orcs besieging the city were slain at the hands of Anauril's skilled warriors, their corpses splain by the city's famed blades.

==Inhabitants==
Centuries after the city's fall, it remained protected by the many [[sword wraith]]s that haunted its ruins.
