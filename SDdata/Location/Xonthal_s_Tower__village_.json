        "mainbody": "'''Xonthal's Tower''' was an isolated settlement found within the [[Savage Frontier]] of [[the North]]. The villagers that called it their home were cordial but wary folks that lived simple lives as herders, farmers, and fishers. They always offered stark warnings about the [[Xonthal's Tower|enigmatic black tower]] around which they formed their lives.",
        "Geography": "It was situated at base of [[Mount Hlim]] the southernmost peak the [[Greypeak Mountains]].",
        "Defenses": "The people of Xonthal's tower lived under the constant threat of [[orc]]s, dangerous [[serpentfolk]] that dwelled within the nearby [[Serpent Hills]] and [[Marsh of Chelimber]].",
        "History": "After the [[plumaweaver]] [[Xonthal]] achieved enough power to be considered an [[archmage]], he constructed his wizard's tower at the base of Mount Hlim and his apprentices and attendants began construction of their own dormitories and other buildings to suit their needs. \n\nSome time around the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, Xonthal banished all his servants and students from the growing down and holed himself up within his tower. Decades later, the village was offered \"protection\" by agents of the [[Zhentarim]]. In short order they made sure the local residents had indebted themselves to the Black Network by bringing more commerce into town and defending it from local threats. \n\nAs the years went on, settlers traveling through region migrated to the burgeoning village for shelter from the harsh life of the North. The population of Xonthal's tower grew by leaps and bounds, before leveling out at a few hundred people.\n\nAt some point during the 1480s [[DR]], villages of Xonthal's Tower began to hear unearthly sounds and witness mysterious lights outside their homes.{{ToD-time}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "During the late 15{{th}} century DR, rumors began to circulate that Xonthal had returned to his tower as a [[lich]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Andher's Mill]], the local [[wool]] mill.\n* [[Black Flagon (Xonthal's Tower)|Black Flagon]], a rather unremarkable inn and tavern much like others found in the region.\n* [[Droun Trading]], a general store and stables founded by the stylish and manipulative Zhentarim agent [[Hansibal Droun]].\n* [[Xonthal's Tower]], the mysterious and dangerous wizard tower of Xonthal that was protected by an insidious and deadly hedge maze."
