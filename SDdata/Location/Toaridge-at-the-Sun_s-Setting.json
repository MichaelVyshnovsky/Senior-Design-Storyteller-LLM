It was north of the Nelanther Isles, or was the northernmost island in that chain, the difference mainly depended on how the map was labeled.\nthumb|right|273px|Map showing Toarideg-at-the-Suns-Setting as part of the Nelanther.\nThis island played an important role in the history of a powerful magic sword known as Taragarth \"the Bloodbrand\". Aeroth, the hero of the Second Trollwar and wielder of Taragarth, departed Silverymoon for the Moonshae Isles after the death of his liege lord Rayuth in the Year of the Scythe, 982 DR. On the way, he stopped at Toaridge-at-the-Suns-Setting and hid the famous sword in an abandoned well so his six sons would not squabble over it. The Bloodbrand laid there for centuries until it was discovered by a band of illithids and carried off to their home base deep underground on the mainland."
