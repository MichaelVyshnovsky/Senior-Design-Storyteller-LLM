The Nobles Quarter, previously known as the Mansion District of Phlan, It was home to Phlans wealthiest and most influential citizens and noble families.
The homes found in the Nobles Quarter were grand structures that were given ample surrounding room.
As befitting its affluent residents, the district was far better kept that the rest of the city. Its cobblestone streets were kept clean from dirt and clutter for the citys distinguished nobles.
The Nobles Quarter remained a part of Phlans Old City, while being the only district that lay on the eastern bank of the Stojanow. It was the Nobles Quarter around which the region of East Phlan was built.
As part of the Old City the Nobles Quarter was granted great protection from Phlans massive city walls.
Following the Dragon Run that devastated Phlan in the , the Mansion District (as it was then called) was considered part of the ruined region known as Old Phlan. The district was plundered and stripped of much of its valuables and trappings of wealth. Bands of hobgoblins and Bane-worshiping orcs occupied the districts streets, spreading filth and threatening adventurers that sought to reclaim the richest area of Phlan.
Circa the late 1350s DR, it was said that the estates of the district held some of Phlans greatest caches of treasure.
* Lyceum of the Black Lord, Phlans resident temple of Bane.
* Kovel Mansion, the most luxurious and most renowned of Phlans noble estates.
* Agin Lamarck, an historian and book-merchant that maintained a shop in Podols Plaza.
* Fengor, a powerful illusionist that took up residence within Kovel Mansion during the citys occupation during the early 14 century DR.
* Marten Foss, a retired adventurer that had a strong admiration for the hero Ren o the Blade.
