        "mainbody": "Swords Pool was a village in the Vast, lying on the North Road between Dead Tree Hollow and Kings Reach.\nThe village lay in a wooded dell on the North Road. It served as a stopover for travelers, and was notable for its high-quality inn, the Inn of the Nine Swords, which stood on the western side of the road. Around 1370 DR, it was owned by the three Mellicot sisters Melicent, Meliors, and Melusine.\nBehind the inn lay Swords Pool itself, a deep and dark body of water. The Mellicots stocked the pool with trout and a type of fish they called \"manyfins\". They discouraged fishing, but some people did it anyway on dark nights.\nThe pool was the source of a local treasure tale that gave it, the village, and the inn their names. In the early history of the Vast, to protect and preserve them.\nIn the mid-1370s DR, several young blade magicians of the Vast re-founded the Nine Swords Company, and used the Inn of the Nine Swords.\nCategoryVillages\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryHuman locations\nCategoryLocations on the North Road\nCategoryLocations in the Vast\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\ni5f99h73yw4h1yocsjsb91yfd1m4c1w"
