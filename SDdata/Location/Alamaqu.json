        "mainbody": "'''Alamaqu''' was a tent city in the [[Plain of Horses]] of northwestern [[Kara-Tur]]. It was the home of the [[T'aghur]] tribe.",
        "Geography": "Situated in the central [[Chigidi Mountains]], the city lay in a valley surrounded by high peaks that formed a defensive barrier.",
        "Description": "Alamaqu was actually little more than a vast campsite containing thousands of tents, collectively as big and as populous as an average city elsewhere. These tents were the distinctive white ''ger'' favored by the T'aghurs, arrayed in long lines along paths wide enough [[ox]]- and [[horse]]-drawn carts. Each was erected over a shallow pit dug into the earth. In the winter, the T'aghurs packed up their tents and drove their [[sheep]] herds to greener fields, leaving Alamaqu nearly empty.",
        "Defenses": "As well as the mountains themselves, Alamaqu was protected by a stone wall some {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} high. While the T'aghurs were away in winter, a small garrison remained behind to watch over the campsite.\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, a force of 300 [[elephant]]s was also kept ready for war at Alamaqu. These were the result of the T'aghur triumvirate's decision to adopt elephants as a cavalry, but they proved to be too slow and too willful for Plainsmen warfare. Regardless, the triumvirate obstinately refused to abandon the idea.",
        "History": "Around {{YearlinkConvert|2592|SY}}, T'aghur rebels at Alamaqu were planning to depose the tribe's ruling triumvirate, when the traveling [[lama]] [[Torgoja P'a]] arrived and, in only days, persuaded the rebel leaders to give up their plan.<ref>"
