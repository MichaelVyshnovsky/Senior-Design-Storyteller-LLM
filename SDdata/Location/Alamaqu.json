        "mainbody": "Alamaqu was a tent city in the Plain of Horses of northwestern Kara-Tur. It was the home of the Taghur tribe.\nSituated in the central Chigidi Mountains, the city lay in a valley surrounded by high peaks that formed a defensive barrier.\nAlamaqu was actually little more than a vast campsite containing thousands of tents, collectively as big and as populous as an average city elsewhere. These tents were the distinctive white ger favored by the Taghurs, arrayed in long lines along paths wide enough ox- and horse-drawn carts. Each was erected over a shallow pit dug into the earth. In the winter, the Taghurs packed up their tents and drove their sheep herds to greener fields, leaving Alamaqu nearly empty.\nAs well as the mountains themselves, Alamaqu was protected by a stone wall some  high. While the Taghurs were away in winter, a small garrison remained behind to watch over the campsite.\nCirca , a force of 300 elephants was also kept ready for war at Alamaqu. These were the result of the Taghur triumvirates decision to adopt elephants as a cavalry, but they proved to be too slow and too willful for Plainsmen warfare. Regardless, the triumvirate obstinately refused to abandon the idea.\nAround , Taghur rebels at Alamaqu were planning to depose the tribes ruling triumvirate, when the traveling lama Torgoja Pa arrived and, in only days, persuaded the rebel leaders to give up their plan."
