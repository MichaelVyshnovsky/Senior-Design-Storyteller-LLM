        "mainbody": "'''Milvarune''' was a major port city in the nation of [[Thesk]] in the [[Northeast Faerûn]], on the [[Sea of Dlurg]] and nested among the [[Dragonjaw Mountains]].",
        "Description": "Even after the [[Tuigan]] war, Milvarune stood stoically above the waters of the Sea of Dlurg. The sea shores were clustered with tall stone buildings, and its harbors were decorated with multicolored sails and flags of ships from all across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The city's east gate was the location of a [[caravanserai]], perched against the western city wall,  that serviced traveling merchants.",
        "Geography": "Milvarune stood on the northern shores Sea of Dlurg, the body of water shaped like a large bay, protected from storms and rough weather of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The road between Milvarune and Thassalra was a narrow and steep route that cut across the shortest portion of the Dragonjaw Mountains. There existed several other paths across the mountains, but they were dangerous and not big enough to fit an ox cart.",
        "Government": "From the establishment of Milvarune and its existence as the capital of the kingdom of [[Milvarn]], the rulership of the city and the nation laid in the hands of the High Mage of Milvarune. This form of government lasted until the death of the last High Mage – [[Lurskas]] after the formation of Thesk.\n\nAs of the late 14{{th}} century DR, Milvarune practiced hereditary oligarchy, with the Merchant Prince leading the city, aided by the merchant council. The Merchant Prince of Milvarune represented their city in the larger [[Council of Thesk]] that controlled the nation. Despite being represented in the council, after the Tuigan war, Milvarune was a principality and technically not part of Thesk.\n\nThe [[Mindosel]] dynasty were the historic leaders of Milvarune. As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, the family has been in power for several hundreds of years. ''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the Merchant Prince of Milvarune was [[Auvur Mindosel]].",
        "Trade": "[[File:Milvarune caravan.png|thumb|''Caravans leaving Milvarune.'']]\nOne of the main industries in Milvarune was [[fish]]ing, and the city's main source of food was the bounty of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Sea of Dlurg was considered to be one of the most abundant fishing spots across the entirety of the Inner Sea. Some of the most common sea routes were [[Furthinghome]] of the neighboring Aglarond and the city of [[Telflamm]].\n\nBefore the Tuigan invasion, Milvarune was a busy and prosperous caravan origin and destination for numerous merchants moving between it and Telflamm, through which, Milvarune's caravans sold their goods in [[Rashemen]] and even [[Thay]]. Eight years past the invasion, caravans were routinely moving to and from Milvarune even though the travel was much more perilous than before, and the number of caravans was significantly cut down. As of the mid-14{{th}} century DR, the largest caravan leader in Milvarune was Lord [[Simgarde]], who employed a hundred experienced mercenaries, owned dozens of [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, and serviced by numerous clerks, drovers, and bankers.\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], Milvarune reestablished its connection with the western nation of [[Cormyr]], and an envoy was assigned to maintain the relationship. Other trade partners of Milvarune were communities of [[rock gnome]]s of the Dragonjaw Mountains who supplied the city with [[gemstone]]s and precious metals.\n\nSteep taxation and import duty were implemented in Milvarune as of the late 15{{th}} century DR. The taxes were aimed at financing repairs of aging streets, sewers, water pumps, and city walls. Most duties were applied to imported alcohol and could be as high as a [[silver]] per bottle, two silvers per keg, and four [[gold]]s per [[cask]], resulting in 20 percent taxation. To no surprise, this gave rise to smuggling in Milvarune.{{Cite dungeon/191/Eye on the Realms: Jalander's Dodge|1}}",
        "Culture": "Every spring, Milvarune celebrated the [[Dragon Day]], a festival known for its riddle competitions between visiting gnomes and [[copper dragon]]s of the Dragonjaw Mountains.",
        "Defenses": "The City Militia of Milvarune counted almost 200 able-bodied warriors, and the [[Prince's Guard]] consisted of almost 60 experienced warriors, [[fighter]]s, and [[paladin]]s.",
        "History": "Milvarune was founded by [[Aubayreer]], the first Mage-King in the {{YearlinkName|535}} as the capital of the small kingdom of Milvarn. Aubayreer's place on the throne was inherited by Mage-King [[Nytholops]] in the {{YearlinkName|642}}. Another change of power took place in the {{YearlinkName|719}} as the throne was claimed by High Mage [[Lurskas]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|752}}, a gang of daring thieves stole''[[Aubayreer's Workbook]]'' from Milvarune's royal libraries. By the {{YearlinkName|937}}, the [[Alliance of the Cities of the Golden Way]] formed the nation of Thesk with Milvarune becoming its capital, eventually dissolving the kingdom of Milvarn. High Mage [[Lurskas]] retained his title and throne until his death, sometime after 937 DR. High Mage [[Jholnareer]] – the next High Mage, took the throne in the {{YearlinkName|968}}. High Mage in title only, he ruled as an Oligarch of Thesk.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1237}}, Queen [[Thara Olósynne]] of [[Aglarond]] was wed to [[Elthar Mindosel]] of Milvarune, forging an alliance between Thesk and Aglarond that lasted well into and likely past the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n\nHigh Mage Jholnareer died in the {{YearlinkName|1249}}, marking it the official end of the kingdom of Milvarn. The rulership was passed onto the High Mage's second son [[Khalreer]], the first King of Milvarune and the second Oligarch of Thesk.\n\nThe {{YearlinkName|1360}} was ruinous to the nation of Thesk and the city of Milvarune. Its prosperity was majorly stifled by the ravaging barbarian horde from the east – the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] led by [[Yamun Khahan]]. The damage done by the invasion was still yet to be fully healed as of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. The once-prosperous caravan routes were left to be roamed by gangs of bandits, [[orc]]s, and other neer-do-wells. The strife also turned noble families and factions against each other, and the famous Theskian unity of the past was lost to petty squabbles and competitions for resources. Locals whispered about the source of the roaming bands of criminals being the doing of the dreaded [[Black Network]]. Despite that, Milvarune was the least damaged settlement in the whole of Thesk.\n\nIn 1368 DR, a menacing orcish tribe known as the [[Wolfheads]] attacked and raided caravans that moved between Milvarune and Thassalra and only caravans that spent extra coins on capable guards managed to reach their destinations.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Prince Auvur Mindosel set his sight on the throne of the neighboring nation of Aglarond. He believed that he deserved the throne because of his ancestor Elthar Mindosel wed Queen Olósynne a century prior.",
