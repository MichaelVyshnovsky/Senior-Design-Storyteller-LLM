        "mainbody": "'''Dambrath''' was a nation on the southern coast of [[Faerûn]]. It was notable as it was formerly ruled by a race of [[human]], [[half-drow]] collectively known as the [[Crinti]], who comprised the upper class. It was a predominantly isolationist nation, though they did allow some limited trade with outsiders.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Climate": "{{Climate/Shining South/Clear and coast}}\nDambrath was unbearably hot throughout the entire year, with relief only coming during the rainy season, which lasted from [[Uktar]] to [[Hammer]] or [[Alturiak]]. However the [[Gnollwatch Mountains]] would gather rain  for many months of the year and snow during the colder months, despite being a low-altitude mountain range.\n\nThe region south of the mountains had sweltering days combined with a cool, refreshing night (thanks to the cool air from the [[Great Sea]]. The [[Forest of Amtar]] was as dense and humid an area as the jungles of [[Chult]] to the far west of the continent. \n\nEven worse, in the regard of heat and humidity, was the noxious swamp of [[Rethild]] along the Dambrath's southwest coast. Decaying organic matter and residual magic in the earth caused toxic vapors to bubble out from the murky waters. These fumes stream together to form clouds of earth-toned, poisonous gases that waft through the swamp. They have been known to cause [[cackle fever]] and [[mindfire]].",
            "Geography": "Dambrath stretched more than 700 miles east to west, and 300 miles north to south. The nation was bordered roughly by Halruaa's [[East Wall]] mountains to west, the Forest of Amtar to north (though most of the populace lived south of the Gnollwatch Mountain and [[Hills of the Dead Kings]]), the Great Sea to the south, and Luiren and the [[Lluirwood]] to the East.",
            "Flora and Fauna": "The local wildlife and plant-life varied heavily as Dambrath had a number of distinct biomes. The great open plains north of the Gnollwatches were filled with tall grasses and sporadic sentient inhabitants. It was a rich breeding ground for horses, and some of the finest equestrian mounts in all of [[Faerûn]] came from ranches in this stretch of land.\n\nThe Gnollwatch mountain range was dotted with [[pine]] and [[shadowtop]] trees and, as the name suggests was home to a number of tribes of [[gnoll]]s. A more dangerous threat of a handful of [[hill giant]]s lived in these peaks, with the apex of the mountains serving as the home of [[storm giant]] family. The Hills of the Dead Kings, which extended off the eastern arm of the mountains, had sparse vegetation and few trees. Its eastern slopes however were home to a number of [[halfling]] villages, likely migrants from nearby Luiren.\n\nThe Forest of Amtar was a dense, somewhat tropical forest of [[suthwood]]s that extended for miles, with groves of shadowtop and pines interspaced. Underneath the canopy is a thick undergrowth of tangled vines and ivy that was rife with insects of all kinds. The native wild species include [[boar]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, reptiles including lizards and [[giant snake]]s as well as a number of primates like [[monkey]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[dire ape]]s and [[girallon]]s. Most notable were the tribes of [[wild elves]] known as the [[Trunadar]], living in the southern half of the woodlands.\n\nThe Great Swamp of Rethild was a dark sweltering bog of moss-covered [[cypress]] and [[blackwood]] trees, with magical plants like [[shambling mound]]s. Endless swarms of deadly insects would buzz through the fetid fog and along the swamp floor. [[Giant toad]]s, snakes and [[giant leech|leeches]] were among the creatures that populated the swamp, along with intelligent species like [[bullywug]]s, [[tasloi]], [[nagas]] and tribes of lizardfolk.\n\nThe [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]] was full of a wide variety of sea life including [[swordfish]], sea bass, snapper and the eponymous [[dolphin]]s who would dance in a coordinated routine every evening at dusk. Deep between the waters were a hidden city of [[Triton]].\n\n[[Criosphinx]]es were known to live in the frontier lands of Dambrath."

        "Notable Locations": "*[[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]]: An important body of water that was a wealth of resources that drove Dambrath's economy\n*[[Forest of Amtar]]: This near-tropical forest was home to many wild animals, bandits and the [[Trunadar]]\n*[[Gate of Iron Fangs]]: Ancient ruins in the Forest of Amtar that became the lair of the [[glabrezu]] [[Quinix]].\n*[[Gnollwatch Mountains]]: A squat mountain range, almost 300 miles in length, that was home to [[gnoll]]s, [[hill giant]]s and rich in [[silver]] and [[gem]]stones\n*[[Hills of the Dead Kings]]: This range of hills jutting off the east side of Gnollwatch mountains were home to many of the tombs of long-dead [[Arkaiun]] kings\n*[[Ilimar]]: A set of ruins treated as a holy site by the nearby Lizardfolk.\n*[[Great Swamp of Rethild|Rethild]]: The Great Swamp was a noxious, foul bog home to many [[lizardfolk]] as well as the [[black dragon]] [[Valraxaxath]]\n*[[Swagdar|The Swagdar]]: This wasteland was full of nomadic outlaws and bandits",
        "Civilization": {
            "Culture": "In the centuries of rule under [[Reinhar I]] and his descendants, Dambrath was a [[human]]-centric nation focused on conquest and war with neighboring countries. They were known for being expert riders, and had deep connection with the horses of the Dambrathan plains.\n\nDuring the reign of the Crinti, Dambrath was a segregated and isolated matriarchy, leading the surface nation on behalf of the Drow in the Underdark. The church  of Loviatar held an interesting alliance with the dark [[half-elves]].The Crinti consolidated power and authority in the central, more populated, urban areas of Dambrath. Military service was an honor to the nobility, and the army was used to quell [[shebali]] uprisings, enforce the nations isolationism and defend from foreign nations.",
            "Economy": "Dambrath was a country wealthy in a few, specific, unrelated goods; breeding horses, silver mined from its mountains and [[pearl]]s from the Bay of Dancing Dolphins. Minor exports from the nation included products made from the trees from the Amtar Forest, including arrow shafts, chairs, tables and other finished wooden goods. The area was also known for its fruit orchards and wealth of fish species from the bay.\n\nThe horses that had been captured, tamed and bred, from the great plains north of the Gnollwatches, were prized around [[Faerûn]] and in lands as far away as [[Zakhara]]. One of few ways the Arkaiun people could make a good living during the rule of the Crinti was by operating an independent horse ranch in the plains, far from the centralized cities of the half-elves' society. This lifestyle had been a part of the Arkaiun people for hundreds of years before their subjugation.\n\nThe land was also extremely rich in silver, found deep in the Gnollwatch mountains. The mine owners in that region formed several consortiums to maximize profits and utilization of the precious metal. Another prized mineral came in the form of stunning pearls. Many divers would submerge in the bay's waters for the wealth of easily-accessible oyster beds. This was also the only location for the rare [[Dambrathan pearl]], easily worth seven to ten times the value of the standard variety.\n\nThe Crinti maintained an isolationist policy with their kingdom, but ensured that trade was vigorous. The majority of the trade came in through sea, but caravans regularly came in from [[Delzimmer]] along the [[Trader's Way]]. These traders could travel no further into the country than [[Cathyr]], and as such the large port city of Maarlith only had visitors via the Great Sea. Non-drow [[elven]] traders, or any other profession for that matter, were completely banned from the country.",
            "Religion": "The faith of [[Loviatar]] was the official religion of Dambrath after the death of [[Reinhar IX]] by the hands of their Priestess. Since the takeover by the Crinti, every major city has erected a temple to the ''Maiden of Pain'', and her sadistic tenets found their way to most aspects of daily life. Despite it being the state religion of the Crinti, not everyone in Dambrath chose this deity for worship. Most full-blooded, surface drow worshiped [[Lolth]] with a few who prayed to [[Eilistraee]] while many of the isolated outcasts of the Swagdar prayed to the beastlord [[Malar]]. Due to these deities' relationship with Loviatar, the Crinti church tolerated their practices.",
            "Settlements": {
                "Cities": "*[[Ammathtar]]: A town on the edge of Luiren that handled business with halflings, until it was destroyed by an unknown threat.\n*[[Cathyr]]: The capital of Dambrath, this metropolis was the seat of power for the monarchy.\n*[[Hazuth]]: A large port town on [[Melanith Bay]] east of Cathyr, it was a port of entry for halflings.\n*[[Hethar]]: A military city dedicated to defending southern Dambrath.\n*[[Herath]]: A large, silver-mining city at the head of [[River Dambron]], and home to the region's dwarves.\n*[[Luenath]]: The second-largest city in Dambrath, and center of privateering and piracy.\n*[[Maarlith]]: The coastal, sister-city to Cathyr that handled the import of goods into Dambrath.\n*[[Prastuil]]: The oldest city in Dambrath, and a center for trade with other lands.\n*[[T'lindhet]]: Not truly a part of Dambrath, this small drow city in the [[Underdark]] allowed the Crinti nobility to rule the surface for them.",

        "History": "{{Main|History of Dambrath}}\nThe recorded history of Dambrath began with the [[Nar]], an ethnic group who fled the city of [[Shandaular]] via a portal in {{Yearlink|-946}}. The portal opened up into the [[Council Hills]] in the [[Eastern Shaar]], where they would live for over 1000 years, calling themselves the [[Arkaiun]] people. After this time they were pushed south by invading forces, eventually settling in  the coast north of the Bay of Dancing Dolphins. In the following centuries the Arkaiun were united by the Warrior-King [[Reinhar I]]; his kingdom of conquest would expand as as far as [[Luiren]] and Halruaa and last until 9th century [[DR]].\n\nThe reign of the Crinti began with the discovery of silver in the Gnollwatch mountains. Delving too greedily and too deep unearthed the city of T'lindhet, whose drow inhabitants thought they were being invaded. The drow invasion of the surface culminated in the [[Battle of Crimar]] in [[831 DR]], that saw the death of [[Reinhar IX]] and an alliance form between the dark elves and the church of [[Loviatar]]. Thus the reign of [[Queen Cathyr]] began, and a centuries of matriarchal regicide would follow for the next 400 years, with another century of peaceful succession after that.\n\nAfter centuries of Crinti rule, native human [[Dambrathan]]s rebelled against their half-drow masters and drove them from the land in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}.\n\nIn [[1489 DR]], Dambrath was a nation of nomadic human clans, primarily horse riders. The clans met two times a year at [[The Hill of Kings]] to add the stories of the clans history to totems on the hill. Many of these Dambrathens sought the curse, or gift in their eyes, of [[lycanthropy]]. This was acceptable because of the local gods they served. The Dambrathans worshiped [[Silvanus]], [[Selûne]], and [[Malar]] all patrons of were-creatures.\n\n===Timeline=== \n*[[211 DR]]: The [[Arkaiun]] tribes flee the [[Council Hills]] from invading forces from [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]] settle along the coast of the [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]].\n*[[314 DR]]: The city of [[Shantil]] is founded\n*[[545 DR]]: The nation of Dambrath is officially founded by [[Reinhar|King Reinhar I]] and begins 9 years of conquest of [[Luiren]], [[Estagund]], [[Var the Golden]] and [[Durpar]], subjugating their people \n*[[554 DR]]: Reinhar I is defeated by the [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaan]] [[wizard]] [[Mycontil]] in [[Sulaziir]]\n*[[802 DR]]: Miners in the Gnollwatch mountains make first contact with the drow city of [[T'lindhet]].\n*[[819 DR]]: Drow from T'lindhet overrun the city of Herath\n*[[831 DR]]: The drow invade and take control of Dambrath after the [[Battle of Crimar]], during which Reinhar IX is murdered by the Head Priestess of Loviatar\n*[[922 DR]]: Crinti raiders attack [[Ammathlauir]].
