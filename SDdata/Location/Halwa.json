        "Geography": "Halwa was located about {{SI|200|mi|k}} east of [[Wasat]] within the desert of the [[Haunted Lands]] along [[Al-Malih River]]. Its lonely inland position next to the usually dry bed of [[Wikipedia:Wadi|Wadi]] Malih gave Halwa the title of City of Solitude.",
        "History": "Despite its location, Halwa was an active trading city, serving as a meeting point between city-dwellers and [[Al-Badia|desert nomads]]. Livestock and durable goods were important commodities, as was care for caravans on their way to [[Hiyal]] and adventurers looking for riches in the desert. More sinister goods were sold in Halwa's underground slave market."
