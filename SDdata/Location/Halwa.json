        "mainbody": "alwa, the City of Solitude, was one of Zakharas \"Cities of the Heart\".\nHalwa was located about  east of Wasat within the desert of the Haunted Lands along Al-Malih River. Its lonely inland position next to the usually dry bed of Wadi Malih gave Halwa the title of City of Solitude.\nDespite its location, Halwa was an active trading city, serving as a meeting point between city-dwellers and desert nomads. Livestock and durable goods were important commodities, as was care for caravans on their way to Hiyal and adventurers looking for riches in the desert. More sinister goods were sold in Halwas underground slave market."
