        "mainbody": "odzin Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot. It was surrounded by a city of the same name. The monasterys symbol was a hawk.\nDodzin Gompa stood amongst the northern foothills of the lower Haraki Ridge in central Tabot, southeast of Chophon.Although Dodzin Gompa is not marked on any map, its location is estimated from its apparent proximity to the Haraki Ridge and Chophon and the estimated locations of other gompas.\nOver the holiest shrine in the monastery was a solid gold hawk with wings outstretched.\nAt the heart of the monastery compound were a number of fig trees.\nIt was founded some time between  and , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Dodzin.\nIn , a shepherd found the infant HDang Li in the wastelands just north of the Haraki Ridge and brought him to the lamas of Dodzin Gompa, where he would be raised and educated. The monks saw the child as pure, born enlightened, and fully at one with the Celestial Heavens, as well as highly intelligent and capable of magical powers. Before long, the holy boy was recognized by all the monasteries, which were reformed and united under the rule of the High Lord of Oceans.\nIt was considered important among the gompas, for it was where the first High Lord was raised. Pokarr Gompa sent delegations to four of its annual festivals, including Mo Kin, Abbot of Pokarr.\nThe surrounding city was home to 1,400 laymen, while the monastery itself housed 600 lamas.\nThe lamas harvested the figs and from these brewed a potent alcohol known as mujahroom.\nDodzin Gompa held at least four festivals a year. These included a performance of a play called the Whi-yeu Nohg to commemorate the first High Lord. Another was Penance Day on the eve, participants were temporarily released from all their vows and drank mujahroom and engaged in other indiscretionsâ€”penance came the morning after.\nDodzin Gompa was said to be haunted by a ghost. This scary spirit was believed to a harbinger of terrible times for the monasterys lamas.\nAmong the monasterys treasures was apparently a map to the legendary Valley of Wings in the Wu Pi Te Shar mountains.\nAccording to rumor, a magic pool located somewhere below the altars had the power to extend the lifespan of those who bathed in it. This was said to be why Dodzins abbots lived for over 130 years, even as old as 176.\n* Pag Hou Ling, dzong-pon (sheriff) of Chophon, a regular visitor and benefactor of Dodzin Gompa"
