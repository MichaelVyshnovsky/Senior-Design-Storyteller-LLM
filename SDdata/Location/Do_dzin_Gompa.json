        "mainbody": "'''Do'dzin Gompa''' was a [[monastery]] (a gompa in the [[Tabotan language]]) of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]]. It was surrounded by a city of the same name. The monastery's symbol was a [[hawk]].",
        "Geography": "Do'dzin Gompa stood amongst the northern foothills of the lower [[Haraki Ridge]] in central Tabot, southeast of [[Chophon]].<ref group=\"note\">Although Do'dzin Gompa is not marked on any map, its location is estimated from its apparent proximity to the Haraki Ridge and Chophon and the estimated locations of other gompas.",
        "Description": "Over the holiest shrine in the monastery was a solid [[gold]] hawk with wings outstretched.\n\nAt the heart of the monastery compound were a number of [[fig]] trees.",
        "History": "It was founded some time between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in [[Shou Lung]] and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Do'dzin.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|2311|SY}}, a shepherd found the infant [[H'Dang Li]] in the wastelands just north of the [[Haraki Ridge]] and brought him to the lamas of Do'dzin Gompa, where he would be raised and educated. The monks saw the child as pure, born enlightened, and fully at one with the [[Celestial Heavens]], as well as highly intelligent and capable of magical powers. Before long, the holy boy was recognized by all the monasteries, which were reformed and united under the rule of the High Lord of Oceans.",
        "Relationships": "It was considered important among the gompas, for it was where the first High Lord was raised. [[Pokarr Gompa]] sent delegations to four of its annual festivals, including [[Mo Kin]], Abbot of Pokarr.",
        "Inhabitants": "The surrounding city was home to 1,400 laymen, while the monastery itself housed 600 lamas.",
        "Activities": "The lamas harvested the figs and from these brewed a potent alcohol known as [[mujahroom]].\n\nDo'dzin Gompa held at least four festivals a year. These included a performance of a play called the ''[[Whi-yeu Nohg]]'' to commemorate the first High Lord. Another was [[Penance Day]]; on the eve, participants were temporarily released from all their vows and drank mujahroom and engaged in other indiscretionsâ€”penance came the morning after.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Do'dzin Gompa was said to be haunted by a [[ghost]]. This scary spirit was believed to a harbinger of terrible times for the monastery's lamas.\n\nAmong the monastery's treasures was apparently a map to the legendary [[Valley of Wings]] in the [[Wu Pi Te Shar]] mountains.\n\nAccording to rumor, a magic pool located somewhere below the altars had the power to extend the lifespan of those who bathed in it. This was said to be why Do'dzin's abbots lived for over 130 years, even as old as 176.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Pag Hou Ling]], dzong-pon (sheriff) of Chophon, a regular visitor and benefactor of Do'dzin Gompa"
