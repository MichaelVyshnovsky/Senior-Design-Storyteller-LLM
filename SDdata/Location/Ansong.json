        "mainbody": "nsong was a settlement in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.\nAnsong lay on the eastern coast, facing the Straits of Koryo.\nThe shipwrights of Ansong built the very best ships in the land. Some were created with magic that enabled them to float more easily and to sail more swiftly, such that seemed to fly over and above the waves when at full sail. They also built barges that never rocked in heavy seas. Thus, foreigners from Wa and as far as Shou Lung came to Ansong to purchase ships.\nThe fishermen of Ansong, along with those of Inani, were claimed to be the best in the world, having done such things as eliminate the prides of sea lions in the Straits of Koryo and catch the enormous eel Ghartii Nung.It is not clear whether the fishermen responsible for these achievements came from Inani or Ansong, or both settlements.\nAround 1357 DR, a massive sea monster assaulted Ansongs harbor, sinking many vessels and eating all the fishermen. Those who saw it and survived claimed it had a seal-like body with a lizards head, and that it used its long and sticky tongue to catch victims like a lasso. Authorities promised a great reward to any who slew the beast and turned in its head."
