        "mainbody": "The Mortik Swamp (also spelled Mortick Swamp) was the only swamp in the halfling realm of Luiren.\nThe Mortik Swamp was located in southern Luiren, just to the southeast of Chethel. It lay along Luirenstrand in the Great Sea. A road skirted the swamps land boundaries to connect Chethel to Krenadir.\nThe swamp was inhabited by monsters, namely merrow and scrags, which often raided nearby lands.\nIn 148 DR, merrow from Mortik Swamp attacked the halfling settlement of Chethel, destroying half of the city. In 1372 DR, an ogre shaman known as the Bog King led the merrow and used the scrags for his own purposes."
