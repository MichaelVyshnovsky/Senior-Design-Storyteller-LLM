'''Scornubel''' ({{Pronounce|SCOR|noo|bel|refs=}}), also known as the '''Caravan City''', was a major tradestop for caravans. It lay on the northern bank of the [[River Chionthar]], where the [[Trade Way]] reached the river.

==Population==
Its population was made up of many races and could increase by between six and eight times during the summer.

==Description==
[[Image:Scornubel.PNG|thumb|right|250px|''A map of Scornubel in 1358 DR.'']]
The river was populated by barges, narrowboats, and skiffs, which made their way west as far as [[Baldur's Gate]] southeast along the Chionthar to [[Berdusk]] and northeast along the [[River Reaching]] to [[Hill's Edge]].

==Demonym==
A person from Scornubel was known as a Scornubian or Scornubrian.

==History==
The southern part of Scornubel was once a rival city known as [[Zirta]], until it was conquered in the [[War of Lords]].{{Cite dragon/420/Eye on the Realms: Alana Nruneree, Unraveler of Secrets}}

In the years immediately after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], trade across [[Faer√ªn]] ground to a halt and Scornubel's fortunes plummeted. The city saved itself by allowing its annexation by [[Elturgard]].

==Government==
In the 14th century DR, the city was ruled by Lady [[Rhessajan Ambermantle]], three Lord High Advisors who were formerly merchants, and an additional council of merchants.

==Lifestyle==
Because there was so much trade passing through the city, many buildings and businesses changed hands rapidly, meaning that the city did not have many permanent landmarks. All year round, many inhabitants slept in their caravans or simply out in the open, using a bale of hay as bedding, rather than paying for a bed in more comfortable accommodation.

Traditional entertainment consisted of mock battles between humans and monsters, monsters trained to dance or perform, or monsters that participated in comedy or spellcasting. Occasionally these monsters could break free and turn on the audiences.

In the past, Scornubel was raided by [[bugbears]] and [[hobgoblins]]. These raids were more likely during the winter months. The city had problems with [[thieves]] and [[doppelganger]]s. Creatures like doppelgangers and [[lamia]]s were tolerated in the city because of their special powers, and the city was used as a meeting place for [[illithids]] and [[yuan-ti]], when the [[Underdark]] or [[Skullport]] were not suitable.
