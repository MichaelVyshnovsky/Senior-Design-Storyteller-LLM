Scornubel (), also known as the Caravan City, was a major tradestop for caravans. It lay on the northern bank of the River Chionthar, where the Trade Way reached the river.
Its population was made up of many races and could increase by between six and eight times during the summer.

The river was populated by barges, narrowboats, and skiffs, which made their way west as far as Baldurs Gate southeast along the Chionthar to Berdusk and northeast along the River Reaching to Hills Edge.
A person from Scornubel was known as a Scornubian or Scornubrian.
The southern part of Scornubel was once a rival city known as Zirta, until it was conquered in the War of Lords.
In the years immediately after the Spellplague of 1385 DR, trade across Faer√ªn ground to a halt and Scornubels fortunes plummeted. The city saved itself by allowing its annexation by Elturgard.
In the 14th century DR, the city was ruled by Lady Rhessajan Ambermantle, three Lord High Advisors who were formerly merchants, and an additional council of merchants.
Because there was so much trade passing through the city, many buildings and businesses changed hands rapidly, meaning that the city did not have many permanent landmarks. All year round, many inhabitants slept in their caravans or simply out in the open, using a bale of hay as bedding, rather than paying for a bed in more comfortable accommodation.
Traditional entertainment consisted of mock battles between humans and monsters, monsters trained to dance or perform, or monsters that participated in comedy or spellcasting. Occasionally these monsters could break free and turn on the audiences.
In the past, Scornubel was raided by bugbears and hobgoblins. These raids were more likely during the winter months. The city had problems with thieves and doppelgangers. Creatures like doppelgangers and lamias were tolerated in the city because of their special powers, and the city was used as a meeting place for illithids and yuan-ti, when the Underdark or Skullport were not suitable.
