'''Tegal's Mark''' was the most widely known tassel, located near [[Rauthauvyr's Road]], which served as the ''de facto'' capital of [[Tasseldale]]. 

==Description==
While Tegal's Mark was not particularly large, it was quite a vision. The picturesque town was set between two wooded hills, surrounded by a garden. There were three major landmarks that were visible from the [[Tasselway]] road entering the town. These were two large houses on the south-eastern hill and an [[elven]] [[Sharburg|watchtower]].

==History==
The town of Tegal's Mark was founded around [[1187 DR]] by the renowned swordsmith named [[Tegal]]. His forge, also named "Tegal's Mark" was the landmark around which the town grew. His apprentices took on the tradition of stamping their blades with his personal "mark", a tradition that continued well into the 14{{th}} century.
