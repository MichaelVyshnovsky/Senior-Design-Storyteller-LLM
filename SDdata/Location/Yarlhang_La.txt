'''Yarlhang La''', or the '''Trying Pass''',

Based upon maps of the region, Yarlhang La was the general location where the [[A-Ling Shan]] and [[Katakoro Shan]] mountain ranges converged.

==Geography==
Located on the northwestern side of the mountain range, Yarlhang La was the only pass through the steep rock surfaces. The [[Old Caravan Road]] wound through the pass on the way toward [[Kushk]].
