'''Eastway''' was one of the larger districts of [[Baldur's Gate]]. As the name suggested, it was located on the east side of the [[Lower City]], between [[Gray Harbor]] and the [[Basilisk Gate]]. It was bordered on the north by [[Heapside]] and to the south by [[Brampton]].

==Notable Locations==
;Businesses:
* [[Eastway Expeditions]]: This shop specialized in selling adventuring equipment to en route [[Chult]].
* [[Garmult's House of Mastery]]: Half-tavern and half academy, this establishment was the local hangout for the [[Bannerless Legion]] crew.

;Inns, Restaurants and Taverns:
* [[Blade and Stars]]: This was comfortable if somewhat ordinary, save for its rather unique, enchanted signboard.
* [[Elfsong Tavern]]: A somewhat famous landmark of the city, the Elfsong earned its name from the spectral vocalist that dwelled within.
* [[Jopalin's]]: Like other establishments of the Lower City, this formerly unpleasant establishment was later transformed into a trendy eatery.
* [[The Low Lantern]]: This three-story moored merchant's ship was renovated to serve as a combination [[festhall]], tavern and gambling den.

;Landmarks:
* [[Harbormaster's Office]]: This dockside building served as the seat of power for the [[Harbormaster]], one of the five officers that helped govern Baldur's Gate.
