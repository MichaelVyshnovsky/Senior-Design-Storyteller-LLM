'''Heroes' Garden''' was a public garden in the far north of the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]], one of the only public gardens in the city besides the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]].

==Description==
This was a large, lush park full of [[grass]] and trees, as well a number of ponds. Fine statuary was dotted around the park, portraying many important figures in Waterdeep's history. Two of these were large, [[marble]] figures of the [[Open Lord]]s [[Baeron]] and [[Lhestyn]] (in her Masked Lady guise).

==Location==
This garden was bounded by [[Heroes' Walk]] and [[Trollkill Street]].

==Activities==
Heroes Garden didn't receive a great deal of visitors to due to its location in Sea Wards far north, but it was still actively tended to by local citizenry and members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]], which included keeping the park free of debris.

[[Adventurer]]s often came to the park and regaled locals with tales of their exploits.

==History==
In the wake of the [[Tower of Yintros]]'s destruction, the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] purchased the land on which it stood. They went on to clear the tower's debris and have its plot of land transformed into what would become known as Heroes' Garden.

==Notable Locations==
* In the central stand of trees at the southern end of Heroes' Garden was a manhole entrance into the [[sewers of Waterdeep]],<ref> covered by a stone hut. Halfway down this shaft was a secret entrance leading to the [[Catacombs of Yintros]].
* A large stone urn in the northeast corner of this garden linked to a pool near the edge of the underground forest of [[Wyllowwood]]. The urn needed to be more than half full of water to function, and anyone being transported ran the risk of being affected by one of a number of magical conditions at random.

==Reputation==
The Heroes' Garden was among some of the more notable and recognizable areas of the Sea Ward, considered by locals to be a landmark. Over the years many adventurers would attempt to carve their names into the park's trees, an act that was prevented by both local citizens and members of the Watch. Notably, members of the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] managed to achieve this feat.
