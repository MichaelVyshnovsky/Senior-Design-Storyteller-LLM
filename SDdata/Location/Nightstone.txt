Nightstone was a fortified settlement located near the Ardeep Forest, in the hills between Waterdeep and Daggerford. It was connected to the High Road via a side trail.
Nightstone was located a few miles south of the Ardeep Forest.
Over the years, the villagers of Nightstone had bad relationships with the wood elves who inhabited the Ardeep Forest, owing to Lord Drezlin Nandars hunting. This eventually culminated in an attack on the village, wherein Lord Drezlin and half of the villagers died. His widow, Velrosa Nandar, negotiated peace with the wood elves and spent years maintaining that peace by the late 15 century DR.
Sometime after 1485 DR, the village was bombarded with large rocks by a cloud giant floating castle. Many of the inhabitants were crushed, but those who survived fled north into the nearby hills intending to hide in some caves. Unfortunately for the fleeing villagers, the caves were being claimed by a clan of goblins and a pair of ogres, who captured and ate them. Meanwhile, the cloud giants descended on Nightstone and removed the villages obelisk, believing it to be an artifact of the ancient giant civilization of Ostoria. After removing the obelisk, the cloud giants had no interest in the town or its inhabitants and so drifted off the way they came. The now-abandoned town was subsequently ransacked by the goblins and left to ruin. 
Its name derived from a mysterious obsidian obelisk in the center of the village that had strange glyphs carved into it and emanated a magic aura.
