'''Frostrill''' was a small thorp located in the [[Druarwood]], north of the [[Moonwood]] and the [[Cold Wood]], in the [[Silver Marches]].

==Inhabitants==
The thorp's inhabitants were exclusively [[arctic dwarf|arctic dwarves]] and were led by [[Unimak Giantskull]] around [[1372 DR]]. The dwarves strenuously defended their hunting territory from numerous enemies. Arctic dwarves tamed a small number of [[dire wolverine]]s, which were used for hunting. They kept themselves as much as possible away from the [[giant]]s in the area and they had no scruples about attacking [[orc]]s with incredible violence. 

===Notable inhabitants===
* [[Aniva Icefoot]]
* [[Kolmak|Kolmak the Broken]]
* [[Nunima Orc-eater]]
