'''Songhal''' was a town located in the foothills of the [[Earthspur Mountains]], within the [[Uplands]] of [[Impiltur]]. The enlightened town served as a center of learning for the kingdom, which contrasted with the surrounding farmsteads and agrarian holdings of the Impilturan thaedar.

While it was well-known among the [[sage]]s of [[Faer√ªn]] for some time, it became much more prominent during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

==History==
In the [[1373 DR|Year of the Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], the [[Silver Stag]] of the [[High Heralds]], a [[loremaster]] by the name of [[Ilvarthaele Everstone]], established her office in the [[Stormspire]], located within the central district of Songhal. This was the first occasion such a post had been centered within a city located near the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] since the founding of the High Heralds in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Notable Locations==
*[[House of Many Tomes]]: This holy house was perhaps the largest and most-renowned temple of [[Oghma]] found throughout the Realms.
