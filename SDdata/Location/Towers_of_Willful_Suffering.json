In the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], it was a quiet, contemplative place with a staff of 16 priests and a community of 48 followers, led by the Revered Mother of the House [[Heldatha Dhussta]]. The grounds and architecture were understated and plain, but its mere presence in Amn made it stand out more than opulence and grandeur ever could.",
