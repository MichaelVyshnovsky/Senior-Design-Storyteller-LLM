        "mainbody": "Selgaunt (), formerly known as Chancelgaunt, was a large merchant port on the Sea of Fallen Stars and the capital of the nation of Sembia following the destruction of Ordulin in the late 14 century DR.\nThe city earned its newer name following the death of the great Sembian merchant-king Selgar, who had been interred beneath an ornate sepulcher within the city.\nSelgaunts most notable feature was the design of its impressive buildings and intricately decorated homes. The city was teeming with grand castles, temples, brownstone tallhouses, marketplaces, emporia, and beautiful mansions. All were surrounded by parks, topiaries, statuary, decorative pools, and a wide variety of complex fountains. The citys crown jewel was the Palace of the Hulorn, with its numerous spires seen from afar. The Hunting Garden was the Hulorns private wildlife preserve enclosed by tall, well-guarded walls. It was only accessible to the Hulorn, the royal family, and guests of the Palace. Appropriately, the luxurious mansions of the citys old noble families, referred to as the Old Chauncel, were built in the district that surrounded Hulorns Palace. Many of the grand structures in Selgaunt were built using imported quarried Yhauntan stone.\nthumb|The 439x439px\nThe city had several chaotically scattered districts, some of which were quite unremarkable warehouse zones like the Warehouse District. It was located in the southeast, The Oxblood Quarter, a district two blocks away from Selgaunts western gate. The Mairen Street, or as locals called it - the \"Shop Street,\" was the hub of mercantile activity in Selgaunt. The street was packed with large two-storied shops, endless street vendors that sold everything from fresh produce to exotic silks, from sweet ices to sausage tarts.\nOne notable feature that greeted travelers entering Selgaunt through the northern Klaroun Gate was the spacious High Bridge over the Arkhen River. The bridge itself had homes, buildings, a tavern, and a fish market, all tightly built on both sides with Galgorgars Ride separating both rows of houses. Galgorgars Ride stretched from the gatehouse to the Rauthauvyrs Road that led to Ordulin.\nSelgaunt was built at the mouth of Arkhen River,\nThe waters of the so-called \"Selgaunt Bay\" were commonly visited by peaceful schools of dolphins but also held at least three major kuo-toa lairs. Sahuagin attacks often menaced the coastal stretch to the south of the city. Sharks were yet another aquatic danger of the \"Selgaunt Bay.\"  Among more mundane fish found by fishers of Selgaunt were raiks, huge and aggressive creatures, as well as equally big mottled sidi octopuses.\nSandy shores near Selgaunt were also home to a deadly and venomous species of an aquatic beach snake that hid in the tidal pools after tides receded. This creature was unique to the \"Selgaunt Bay.\"  The waters of the Arkhen River were home to aggressive water weirds.\nThe skylines and wizardly laboratories of Selgaunt were homes to rare magical creatures known as guardgoyles who served the citys many arcane spellcasters.\nDwarf maples grew along the Temple Avenue of Selgaunt, decorating the districts public sitting contemplation areas. In the fall, the dwarf trees were lit with beautiful red and yellow canopies. The trees harbored a large number of starlings who early decorated marble statues of manticores, chimerae, and owlbears with their droppings.\nLike in so many sewer systems across the land, sewers of Selgaunt were pocked with deep alcoves that served as shelter to rats, other vermin, and even strange aquatic vampires. The sewage flowed north-east, towards drainage in the Selgaunt Bay.\nSelgaunt was located in a temperate climate territory. The city saw snowfall in the winter as well as frequent regular or ice fogs. Due to windy weather, rainfall tended to be short and usually was limited to mornings and mid-afternoons. Daytime was often cloudy, with fogs swelling overnight, leaving frosted rooftops and tall spires by dawn.\nFor many years, until the late 14 century, Selgaunt was led by a hereditary merchant-prince known as the Hulorn. However, in the , other factions held the real power. These included the Knights of Selgaunt, who answered to the authorities in the capital city of Ordulin, and the influential and independent local noble merchant houses. The Council of Sembia, or the Consortium Princes, were joint political rulers of Saerloon, Selgaunt, and all of Sembia. The organization issued ambassadors to neighboring countries, such as Cormyr, who were authorized to negotiate trade and military assistance.\nThe power in the 14 century DR was in the hands of the Hulorn and the Old Chauncel, the old nobility of Selgaunt. In the 15 century DR, the position was renamed to the Chief Administrator of Sembia, the Lord High Governor, while the Netherese overlords held the true power until the Second Sundering.\nIn the 14 century, Hulorn did nothing to stop or even limit the drug and flesh trade in the streets of Selgaunt. Prostitution was a profitable business, and those who traded in vices were just as respected as merchants who dealt in exotic Chultan spices. This was a common point of view well illustrated by a popular saying \"Business is business.\" Piracy, on the other hand, was shunned by society, including anyone suspected of association. The laws were extremely strict and cruel to those who were convicted of piracy one month of excruciating labor in the city harbor, followed by amputation of the convicts hands. When the charges were severe, the breaking of limbs also followed the amputation. The wounds were not allowed to be healed by magic as \"the pain will be their teacher.\"\nA new fad emerged in 1367 DR. A sweet, milky alcoholic beverage known as Selgite ice wine, or simply \"ice wine,\" began being sold by Ghalivar Braceltar. The wine quickly gained popularity across Sembia and captured the tastes of people from across the Sea of Fallen Stars. Another local wine that was exported out of the city was Usk Fine Old, a fine Sembian libation.\nLocally-crafted musical instruments were one of the main exports of Selgaunt. Instruments such as violins, rebecs, harpsichords, psalteries and silver harps were sold across the Realms via Auroras Emporium. and black raisins from Selgaunt.\nEven though Selgaunt had a sewer system, a group of people, known as the \"nightcarters,\" held the lowest of the jobs one could get in the city, scraping dung off Selgaunts streets and selling it to local farmers for mere coppers.\nCut gemstones were a preferred major alternative currency among merchants and traders of Selgaunt. The main advantage of using gems as currency was the ease of transportation and guarding, compared to that of coin. Due to that, a sizable black market developed in Selgaunt that dealt in cutting, setting, and reselling stolen precious stones.\nthumb|Members of 358x358px\nPossibly the wealthiest city on all of Sembia, Selgaunt was an exciting metropolis that featured the high fashions, pageantry, and brashness that was so often found in the Eastern Heartlands. The Selgauntans viewed themselves as the epicenter of sophistication and saw their city as the heart of civilization in all the planes of existence.\nSelgaunt had a rich and active community of artists, dancers, and musicians. New performances of plays, highlighted by\nchoreographed dances and choral arrangements, were regularly put on within the city. Paintings, sculptures, and carved statues were readily available throughout the city, were highly prized, and often exported in trade with other cities.\nMusic was especially prevalent throughout the city, as most Selgauntans could artfully sing and whistle complex melodies. Live performances could often be found in taverns, inns, and the houses of noble families. Glaurs, zulkoons and thelarrs were popular instruments during the mid-14 century. Nobility of Selgaunt had constantly changing fashions. Events such as pastorales were popular summer activities. One year, pastorales consisted of noblewomen dressed in what they thought were commoners clothing. They played pretend to be simple rustics at lavish farms while listening to minstrels performing songs about the countryside and manual labor.\nTo keep track of time, Selgaunt employed a small army of hour-callers who loudly proclaimed hours on the city streets. Additionally, Milils Temple of Song had a huge bell that tolled hourly.\nSembia, Selgaunt especially, was a capital of fashion and luxury. Women of noble birth could be seen wearing sophisticated coiffures with dyed highlights of striking colors, assembled by the best hairdressers of the city. Even the simplest clothes in design were created using the finest cambric and sarcanet. Red lips dyed with fucus was a fashionable type of make-up.\nSelgauntans, especially the rich and noble, were quite fond of imported wines, such as Berduskan Dark and Arabellan Dry. Domesticated fowl was a part of local food culture, luxurious dishes such as nut-roasted goose were served at the nobles social events. Foods, fried in red pepper oil, were quite common. Fruit like sunmelon and grape were consumed as well. Grapes were dried into raisins, while sunmelon rind was a food found in taverns and served along with many other small bite-sized treats, such as ruth-balls. Among simpler foods, Selgauntans ate chicken stews, breads, and huge amounts of soft sharp goat cheese.\nSelgauntans cookery had one curious quirk. The term \"dice\" was used to describe a uniform shape and quantity of butter, while it was referred to kitchen knifework in other parts of the world. Dice meant a cube of butter of the same shape and size as the gaming dice. To accommodate this measurement system, most butter sold in Selgaunt was packaged in long fingers, pre-marked for ease of measuring and cutting.\nThe citizens of Selgaunt saw those from the Sword Coast in the west, northerners from the Dalelands and North Faerûn, and that southern-folk from the Dragon Coast down to the Lands of Intrigue as filthy, barbarous savages. They thought worse of the people of Calimshan, as they were pretentious on top of everything else. They saw the kingdom of Cormyr as adorable country bumpkins who, despite their \"royal\" family, lacked proper breeding and sophistication.\nThey even looked down on the other cities of Sembia as disadvantaged, depressing collectives Ordulin was unfortunately insignificant, full of small-time merchants who were too busy counting their meager coins, and Saerloon was a tired, apathetic city that was well past its prime.\nThe combined city guard/armed forces were known as Scepters. They were 9,000 strong during the mid-14 century and maintained a strong fleet of three dozen ships. Scepters were outfitted in black leather armor, green cloaks, and silver-hilted swords.\nthumb|Selgaunts position on a map of Sembia in the late-14 century 430x430px\nLong before Selgaunts lands were settled, the devastating destruction of three Netherese conclaves took place in -1660 DR. The explosions formed what would eventually be known as the \"Selgaunt Bay.\" \nThe cities of Chondathan (Saerloon) and Chancelgaunt (Selgaunt) were established circa 380s DR by traders and merchants of Chondath. The first major threat to Chondathan and Chancelgaunt came in the , when the defenses of both settlements were crumbling under constant assault by orc and goblin tribes. Without help, the cities were sure to be destroyed. Chondath sent almost half of its armed forces to fortify the cities and secure the fledgling countrys territories. The region was secured however, the raids and conflicts with the savage humanoids continued for the next 15 years.\nFollowing the disastrous Rotting War of the , cities of Chondathan and Chancelgaunt gained independence from Chondath. The same year, the Cult of the Dragon established a cell in Selgaunt.\nSometime before 1281 DR, a covert war erupted between the criminal underbellies of Selgaunt and Westgate. The conflict was sparked by a hin thief Deder Seven Fingers who was trying to recover his stolen treasure, The Salamanders Tongue. In the process, Deder and his Westgate allies culled a number of rogues of Selgaunt. In retaliation, Selgite crime lords hired Pieter the Feeble, a priest of Mask, who, in turn, succumbed to avarice, stole The Salamanders Tongue and manipulated both cities crime lords into all-out war.\nIn the , pirate leader Methlas was assassinated by his lieutenant Thevren, who sent his fleet of 40 ships to attack Saerloon and Selgaunt. The attacks were startling successes for the pirate fleet.\nIn the , the adventuring Company of the Black Buckler ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor at the behest of a ring of anonymous investors in Selgaunt. The Company was never seen after.\nIn Ches of the , Captains Strauph Omerehellins trade caravel from Selgaunt, the Ratclaw, disappeared while traveling to Hillsfar. The ship carried southern dates, nuts and olive oil. The reason for its disappearance was never uncovered. However, some blamed pirates, ice, or even more outlandish culprits. Selgaunt was rumored to prepare a search fleet headed for the Pirate Isles. In Eleasis of the same year, gemstone smuggled out of Cormyrean mies in the High Horn surfaced in several cities, including Selgaunt.\nA strange incident happened in the . A legendary artifact - the Mask of Mysteries, started appearing in Selgaunt 9 years prior, worn by a mysterious individual only known as the Masked Lady during evening noble balls and festivities. Even though the identity of the Lady was unknown, it was quite obvious that that Mask was in the hands of one of the noble families of Selgaunt. The incident occurred when a thief attempted to take Masked Ladys jewelry and the Mask. The moment the thief removed the artifact, the Ladys face discharged a wriggling cluster of tentacles similar to those of a mind flayer. The main difference being the Ladys tentacles were gray and ended in terrifying teethed maws. The aberrant creature ate the unfortunate thiefs face and hands, and after becoming a pin cushion for guards arrows, the Lady fled into the night along with the Mask of Mysteries.\nAt some point before 1367 DR, a rich and powerful wizard Osper Linthalam used his staff of power to incinerate a pirate ship in the docks of Selgaunt. The pirates were attempting to raid the merchants warehouse at the same time as he was inventorying his goods. The impressive display of wizardly powers was well remembered by the Selgites.\nIn the , a notorious thief Polly Thax infiltrated the Palace of the Hulorns exhibition hall in the guise of a cleaning girl. Andeth Ilchammer, the Hulorn of the time, caught Polly, but the thief used her feminine wiles to gain access to the Eyes of the Sea Queen, two priceless pearls the size of oranges. While the aging ruler was busy fondling her underskirts, Polly Thax used her trusty blackjack to knock Andeth Ilchammer out and get away with the treasures. The rogue reached her ship in Selgaunts harbor, and shortly after departing, one of the guards heavy vessels gave chase. Unbeknownst to most, Toril was under the unruly effects of the goddesses Tymora and Beshabas powers running wild. Sparked by Beshabas ill luck, a giant wave swelled in the Sea of Fallen Stars and crashed into Selgaunts harbor, tossing the pursuing vessel along with other ships into the streets of the city. The wall of water crushed many of the dockside buildings. Parts of the city harbors were washed away into the sea. Even bigger than the first one, the second tidal wave swallowed Polly Thaxs ship and crashed into the shores two miles south of Selgaunt. There were no survivors.\nThe  saw a concerning rise of Eyeless Mask abductions in cities of Saerloon and Selgaunt. The shadowy organization was raising funds to expand into Daerlun. One of the Eyeless Masks victims was a Blanchard Wyvernwalk who was murdered during a botched abduction attempt. Some of the noble families Selgaunt, who monetarily supported the Cult of the Dragons, demanded protection and retaliation from their clandestine allies. In Mirtul of the same year, the aquatic elf cities of SeluMaraar, and Naramyr established trade routes with Suzail of Cormyr and Selgaunt of Sembia. Later in 1370 DR, Thay was allowed to establish an enclave in Selgaunt.\nOn Kythorn 20 of the , Thamalon Uskevren II was elected Hulorn of Selgaunt. By Uktar 11 of the same year, unrest in Sembia brought wariness of looming civil war. Threatened by such prospect, Selgaunt entered an alliance and trade pacts with a lost Netherese enclave of Sakkors that emerged from the Sea of Fallen Stars earlier in the month, on Uktar 2. On Uktar 29, Saerloon used teleportation circles to transport its armies to the gates of Selgaunt, and on Uktar 30, the Battle of Selgaunt commenced. Even though Saerloon was allied with a green dragon Vendemniharan, Selgaunt emerged victorious with the aid of Princes of Shade — Rivalen and Brennus Tanthul. The armies of Saerloon were broken and captured.\nFor the century that followed, Thamalon Uskevren II remained the Hulorn. His position was officially renamed to the chief administrator of Sembia, the Lord High Governor, and his body transformed into a shade. The country was in an unstable state, plagued by demon cults and resistance cells that opposed the Princes of Shade. However, resistance was mostly squashed by the Netherese by ,\nIn the spring of the , a strange Sword of Spells started seemingly random daring and stabbing wizards in several cities across Faerûn. Selgaunt was swept by a series of Swords attacks that ended as swiftly as they started.\nIn the 15 century DR, a strange \"dungeon\" was discovered underneath Selgaunt. A mysterious and sprawling labyrinth that connected many cellars of the city, filled with treasures and suspiciously non-lethal traps. Their nature remained a mystery, while some speculated that these dungeons were created by illithids for some nefarious reason. A colorful merchant from the Abyss named Hurluu started visiting Sembian cities of Selgaunt and Saerloon through a set of well-hidden secret gates. This new competitor angered a cabal of local traders of Selgaunt who tried to have Hurluu eliminated. In response, the abyssal dealer poisoned wine casks that were en route to the homes of his mercantile enemies. This stunt killed many of his opponents as well as innocent bystanders in the city.\n*The tomb of Selgaunts namesake, the great Sembian merchant-king Selgar, was rumored to hold unspeakable treasures, buried alongside the famed leader. Even though the treasure remained a mystery, it was known for sure that the tomb was filled with deadly traps and guardians that killed several ambitious thieves over the citys history.\n*It was rumored that a malaugrym named Orglym murdered and consumed an important merchant Ostil of Selgaunt. The creature was said to have assumed the merchants identity.\n*In the 15 century DR, rumors placed the Fringe Grounds straight underneath the city of Selgaunt. The Netherese shadow caravans used the cavern. The magics were channeled through rune-carved elemental earth nodes, allowing the caravans to travel to the Shadowfell. Other rumors claimed the Fringe Grounds were hidden within the Ordulin Maelstrom or some valley in the Thunder Peaks.\n*A demongate, one of the so-called Abyssal Tradeways, was located within the walls of Selgaunt and Saerloon. These gates allowed trades from the Abyss to travel between the infinite layers and Toril.
