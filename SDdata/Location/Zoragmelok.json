        "mainbody": "'''Zoragmelok''' was the capital city of [[Hollow's Heart]] and the personal fortress and lair of the demon prince [[Fraz-Urb'luu]].<ref>",
        "Description": "Zoragmelok was a sprawling, roughly circular city of impossible architecture, full of corkscrew towers, looming domes, and colossal amphitheaters. At its center was a massive fortress that constantly changed according its owner's whim; this was Fraz-Urb'luu's personal palace that he shared only with his many consorts.\n\nThe walls of Zoragmelok were towering creations of [[adamantine]] covered in hooks and razors, upon which countless [[human]]s hung, kept barely alive by a small army of [[harpy]] clerics that applied food, water, and healing as needed to prolong their suffering. Occasionally, a victim would escape the wall and vanish into the nearby [[Scarwood]].",
        "Geography": "Zoragmelok was located on the 176{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], Hollow's Heart. It was situated by a river mouth, on the eastern shore of the [[Hollow Sea]].",
        "History": "Zoragmelok was one of the many places Fraz-Urb'luu created out of the layer when he returned from his centuries-long exile on the [[Material plane|Material]] world of [[Oerth]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Fraz-Urb'luu was the lord and sole ruler of Zoragmelok. Besides himself, the place was inhabited only by his dozens of [[Succubus|succubi]] consorts, who prowled the halls of his fortress, and tens of thousands of [[The Deceived|the deceived]].\n\nThe Deceived were human petitioners who had been sacrificed to Fraz-Urb'luu by his cult. Denied their rightful afterlives, each Deceived lived alone in a section of the city that was reshaped by illusion to be their ideal afterlife, populated by neighbors, friends, and family. Slowly, however, Fraz-Urb'luu would strip away these illusions, reveling in the despair caused by their realization of the truth, before the demon prince finally devoured them."
