The '''Misty Forest''' was located just west of the [[High Moor]], and south of the river [[Delimbiyr]].

==Description==
The Misty Forest was a fog-filled, rainy forest, west of the High Moor, that was also an [[elven]] kingdom.

==Geography==
===Geographical Features===
===Flora and Fauna===
The Misty Forest was full of [[pine]] trees and other types of evergreen trees. The northern part of the forest was dominated by [[spruce]] trees though.

[[Deer|Red deer]] were common in the forest, and rarely left the confines of the trees except in summer. [[Bear]]s, [[boar]]s, and wild [[cow]]s could also be encountered in the woods. [[Owlbear]]s lived there too.<ref>

==Society==
===Religion===
* Sites of power sacred to [[Eilistraee]] dating back to [[Miyeritar]] could be found within the forest.<ref name=DD-p16">
* A pool, sacred to [[Eldath]], led to her realm of [[True Grove]] before the [[Time of Troubles]]. [[Church of Eldath|Eldathyn]] still believed that it was possible to access said realm via that pool.<ref>
* Shrines to Eilistraee,<ref name=DD-p16" /> Eldath, [[Mielikki]], and [[Silvanus]] were scattered throughout the entire forest.<ref>
* A temple to [[Chauntea]], maintained by [[druid]]s, could also be found in the forest.

==Government==
As of [[1489 DR]], the Misty Forest was ruled over by King [[Melandrach]], known as the 'King of the Woods'. He had ruled the forest for at least 150 years by this point, and maintained that his realm was one that belonged exclusively to the elves.
===Foreign Relations===
In [[1363 DR]], in the wake of a devastating war with [[Baatezu]], the elves of the [[High Forest]] sent a charismatic advisor named [[Eamond Blackmantle]] to act as the Misty Forest's Speaker (a figurehead/arbitrator/ambassador). Eamond almost singlehandedly turned the Misty Forest around from a war-ravaged ruin to the biggest settlement of [[Wild elf|wild elves]] west of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars|Inner Sea]] by first organizing the rebuilding effort, then attracting elves to immigrate from other places and opening trade with outsiders.{{Cite dragon/222/Roaming the Realms: The Green Elves of Faer√ªn|43}}

==Trade==
The elves of the Misty Forest kept bees, and did a brisk trade in [[mead]] and [[honey wine]] with merchants who passed through [[The Way Inn]], trading for anything that they couldn't make themselves.

==Defenses==
In the late 14th century, the forest was protected not only by the elves, but also by a [[druid]] who had become so detached from civilization that she'd given up her name.

==History==
During the Crown Wars, the Misty Forest was part of the elven realm of Miyeritar.<ref>

The elves of the forest were involved in the [[Second Dragonspear War]], but by the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, had rebuilt all that they had lost in that war.

In [[1372 DR]], [[Kyleena Moonglow]]'s tribe of [[Chult|Chultan]] [[wild elves]] settled in the Misty Forest, after failed attempt to take over the [[Lonely Barrens]] and threatening the local farmers with famine.

During the [[Tyranny of Dragons]], King Melandrach was chosen to represent both his own realm and the elves of the [[High Forest]], at the Council of Waterdeep, where it was discovered that not only was his younger son, [[Neronvain]] - who was long thought dead - still alive, but that Neronvain was also the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s green Wyrmspeaker, terrorizing the Misty Forest's inhabitants.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Altand]]
* [[Eldath's Water]]
* [[Neronvain's Stronghold]]
* [[Spiders' Haunt]]

==Inhabitants==
[[Ranger]]s were known to patrol the area, and several [[druid]]s had groves in the forest. A small community of [[Wild elf|wild elves]] dwelt somewhere within the forest. [[Deer]] lived in the Misty Forest. 

[[Barbarian]]s from the High Moor used the Misty forest as a source of food and wood, and the [[orc]]s of the High Moor used it as a place to hide and strike travelers and caravans on the [[Trade Way]].
===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Alagarthas|Prince Alagarthas]]
* [[Chuth]]
* Eamond Blackmantle
* [[Galin|Warden Galin]]
* King Melandrach
