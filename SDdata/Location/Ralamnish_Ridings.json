        "mainbody": "The '''Ralamnish Ridings''' was a distant frontier region of [[Calimshan]] during its Third Age.",
        "Geography": "The Ridings broadly consisted of the northernmost territories of ancient Calimshan in the area that would later be known as [[Amn]], though the extents varied greatly with time.",
        "History": {
            "Empire of Calimshan": "The Third Age of Calimshan ({{Yearlink|-1900}} to {{Yearlink|-900}}) saw the conquest and settlement of the lands north of the imperial core, of which the lands of [[Tethyr]], [[Mir]], and [[Iltkazar]] became known as the [[Calishar Emirates]]. A long-running war with the [[elf|elves]] of the [[Forest of Tethir]] ({{Yearlink|-1530}} to {{Yearlink|-1300}}) continually sapped the strength of Calimshan, but expeditionary armies pushed beyond the Forest of Tethir regardless.\n\nThe initial effort to conquer the Ralamnish Ridings was overseen by the scout commander [[Ralamn]], who led the army and organized the construction of numerous outposts in the lands between the [[Tejarn Hills]], [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]], and [[Lake Esmel]].\n\nDespite efforts of the empire, elven and [[goblin]] raiders perpetually troubled the Ridings, and the extreme distance from Calimshan presented many difficulties. The [[beholder]] invasion from the [[Alimir Mountains]] around {{Yearlink|-1280}} caused a reduction of troops on northern frontier as resources were drawn away to deal with the critical threat they posed. Although the garrisons were weakened, Calimshan maintained overall control of the Ridings from that time onwards.",
            "Shoon Imperium": "During the [[Shoon Imperium]], a number of cities were founded in the adjacent [[Western Emirate of Amin]], including [[Athkatla]] ([[100 DR]]), [[Crimmor]] ([[163 DR]]), [[Murann]] ([[212 DR]]), and [[Trademeet]] ([[223 DR]]), providing the basis for later urban civilization. The imperial advisor [[Saref Adnan]] had a villa in the Ridings, and he lived out his last days there in madness after gaining the enmity of every faith and priest, and perished of a curable illness in [[111 DR]].\n\nBefore his brief rule as Qysar, [[Amahl Shoon VI]] commanded and fought alongside the army in the Ridings. During this time, the Mad Mage [[Ilhundyl]] rampaged about the region from [[224 DR]] till [[238 DR]], when he was killed by [[Elminster]] and [[Myrjala]].",
            "Legacy": "The name of the Ralamnish Ridings eventually faded from use, replaced by the realms of Meiritin, Tathtar, [[Minsorran]], [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]], [[Cortryn]], and eventually Amn. The surviving few fortifications became known as the [[Nine Sentinels]], while the lengthy road built to connect the disparate garrisons and allow the speedy march of armies from the south remained known as the [[South Road (Amn)|South Road]]."
