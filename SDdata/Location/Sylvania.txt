Sylvania was a gate-town in the Outlands that connected to the plane of Arborea.
Approximately  from the base of the Spire, the town was located in a forest of abnormally large flora. In this forest, the gate to Arborea moved around, always invisible. Often, travelers looking for a way out of Sylvanias surrounding foliage would pass through the gate unknowingly and into Arborea.
Sylvania was governed by a group known as the Seven Spiritors. The Seven were spirits known to possess bodies of mortals for years or decades at a time in order to take a physical form, with most hosts volunteering themselves for the position. They were each known by a title that reflected their natures Action, Knowledge, Pain, Passion, Reflection, Rest, and Thought.
* The Sensate Embassy, a pyramid of petrified wood that contained lodging and offices for members of the Society of Sensation, as well as a hall for combat and revelry.
* The Acropolis, a temple dedicated to the whole Olympian pantheon.
* The Elven Living Temple to Arvandor, which was carved into a massive living banyan tree.
* The Dipping Dragon, an inn and tavern made in the shape of a dragon. The upper floors were mounted on a pivot that moved up and down to make it appear that the dragon was drinking from a pond.
* Thunderhouse, a festhall. 
* Greyfalcons, an inn.
The population of Sylvania was split evenly between humans, elves, and bariaur.
