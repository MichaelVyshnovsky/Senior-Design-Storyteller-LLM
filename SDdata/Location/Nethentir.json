        "mainbody": "'''Nethentir''' was a city of [[Thay]] located within the tharch of [[Lapendrar]], just beneath the [[First Escarpment]] on the northern shore of [[Lake Umber]]. It was an important settlement that took in heavy caravan traffic and housed a large fortress and a number of legion outposts that guarded a series of switchback trails that led up to the [[Thayan Plateau]].\n\nNethentir was the sister-town of [[Nethjet]], though it never attained the same level of prosperity. Together they served as the starting point for a number of Thayan invasions into the lands of [[Thesk]] and [[Aglarond]].",
        "Description": "In addition, Nethentir had a great many businesses and inns that served the outlanders who entered Thay from the west.\n\nNethentir had a port that opened up into Lake Umber, and many sea captains of the city shipped their goods to Nethjet and back. While no major Thayan roads extended into the city, many merchants established their own overland trade routes,",
        "History": "Nethentir fell into ruin during the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, when the upheaval of the [[Thayan Plateau]] and eruption of the [[Thaymount]] caused the entire region to become broken and transformed into the [[Bonedark Hills]].\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Thayan forces began rebuilding and reinforcing Nethentir into a ringed fortress known as a [[Dread Ring]], and patrols of Thayan troops (including [[undead]] increased around the city."
