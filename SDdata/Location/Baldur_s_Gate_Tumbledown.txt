Tumbledown was a district located within the Outer City region of Baldurs Gate. It was located outside the south-eastern region of the Lower City, just beyond the Cliffgate. It was a dreary, foggy neighborhood that was believed to have been haunted. 
While Tumbledown was well-protected by winds thanks to the massive hill to the east, it was often nearly completely covered in mist and fog that rose up from the River Chionthar.
Long before the 15 century DR, the land that would encompass Tumbledown held a grand estate that belonged to the mercantile Szarr family. Unfortunately, every member of the Szarrs was murdered by a rival house, and their holdings were burnt to the ground.
Ghosts of the family were said to haunt Tumbledown for years following their death.
