'''Tumbledown''' was a district located within the [[Outer City]] region of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was located outside the south-eastern region of the [[Lower City]], just beyond the [[Cliffgate]]. It was a dreary, foggy neighborhood that was believed to have been haunted. 

==Description==
While Tumbledown was well-protected by winds thanks to the massive hill to the east, it was often nearly completely covered in mist and fog that rose up from the [[River Chionthar]].

==History==
Long before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the land that would encompass Tumbledown held a grand estate that belonged to the mercantile [[Szarr]] family. Unfortunately, every member of the Szarrs was murdered by a rival house, and their holdings were burnt to the ground.

[[Ghost]]s of the family were said to haunt Tumbledown for years following their death.

==Notable Locations==
;Landmarks:
* [[Balduran Looks Out to Sea]]: This statue depicted the famous explorer [[Balduran]], after whom the city was named.
* Szarr family crypts: The tombs of the Szarr family was all that remained of their holdings following their grisly murders.
