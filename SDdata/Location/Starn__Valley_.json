        "mainbody": "he Starn was a valley somewhere in Faerûn. It was rural land by the 8 century DR.\nThe valley was crossed by the Larrauden river, and the Gars Road entered it from the east. Opposite from the entrance lay a keep, the Shrine of the Sheaf. A town, Buckralams Starn, lay between them, and there were a number of farms surrounding.\nThe valley was briefly dominated by the Iron Fox in the mid–8 century DR.\nAt some point, the bard Talost visited the Starn Valley, and described Buckralams Starn, perhaps not very kindly. Around , a local band of adventurers, Tavers Talons, were slain in battle with a dragon.\nIn , the local town of Buckralams Starn came under the control of a bandit known as the Iron Fox, who took the Shrine of the Sheaf as his fortress, renaming it Fox Tower. He was later defeated and removed by Elminster Aumar, a wandering Chosen of Mystra, with the help of a local woman, Immeira.\n* Rarendon\n* Immeira\n* Taver\n* Adreim\n* Iron Fox\n* Gondeglus\n* Aawlynson\n* Tarthane\n* Rhen"
