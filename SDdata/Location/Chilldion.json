        "mainbody": "'''Chilldion''' was a tiny secluded valley kingdom, located away from other civilized lands, long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its only recorded history significance was the origin of ''[[Methild's harp]]s''.",
        "History": "The legend that told [[Methild]]'s story stated that he was a [[bard]] who lived in a tiny valley kingdom of Chilldion. One winter night, a coven of three [[hag]]s took over the valley after ensorcelling the royal family. The hags were planning on eating the family whilst they were immobilized by the foul ''[[Hold person|holding]]'' magics. After a long day of conquest, [[spell]]casting, and slaughtering of the innocent, the coven grew tired and ordered Methild, the court bard, to strum them a song. The bard was loyal to his king and brought along his [[enchanted]] [[harp]]. He played the instrument and focused its magics on the king first, dissolving the ''holding'' spell and allowing the king to sneak away. Methild continued to play and remove magic from everyone restrained by the hags, one by one. When every victim was freed, Methild could play no longer, and the coven realized the treachery. The bard did not escape and became the hags' supper instead of the king's family."
