'''Raven Rock''' was the [[ancestral mound]] of the [[Black Raven tribe|Black Raven]]  and [[Gray Wolf tribe|Gray Wolf]] tribes of [[Uthgardt]] people.

==Geography==
Raven Rock was located near the headwaters of [[Black Raven River]] in the [[Spine of the World]].

===Geographical Features===
The site was so named for the 100-foot-tall (30.5 meter) stone sculpture of a perched raven that stood atop the snow-covered plateaus that composed the tribe's burial mound. Just south of the stone was a [[wolf]]-shaped depression that surrounded an alter engraved with the [[Lunar calendar|phases of the moon]].

A number of stone [[menhir]]s dotted Raven Rock's plateaus.

==Rumors & Legends==
Along the burial cairns found within, the ancestral mound held the spoils of war that were amassed by Black Raven raiders. Two [[relic]]s were included among the wealth of riches, each of which was highly valued by their respective tribe. A [[giant]]-sized ''[[ring of hardened magma]]'' was buried near the stone raven, while an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[red dragon|red-dragon]]-femur was found near the Gray Wolf relic.

==Inhabitants==
Members of the Gray Wolf tribe were forbidden from the mound's highest plateau. They gathered near their altar to the south. The Black Ravens were rumored to have a consistent honor guard of no less than ten [[barbarian]]s and ten [[giant raven]]s guarding the Raven Rock at all times.<ref>{{Cite web/Organizations of the Silver Marches}}
