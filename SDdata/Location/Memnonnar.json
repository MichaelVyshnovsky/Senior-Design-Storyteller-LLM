        "Location": "The ruins of Memnonnar were half of what was once a great city. They lay on the northern side of the [[River Agis]] across from [[Calimshan|Calishite]] Memnon.",
        "Description": "When it was the capital city, Memnonnar appeared much like the [[City of Brass]], with buildings made from red brick and minarets and domes inlaid with brass. The bustling city was ruled by [[efreet]] and full of efreet, [[fire genasi]], and [[human]] citizens. Below the surface, slaves mined for precious [[gem]]s and metal.\n\nMillennia after the destruction of the city, the red bricks of the ruins still were hot to the touch. This was because the [[Great Brass Gate]], the original portal through which Memnon came to [[Toril]], still functioned deep below the surface as late as [[1374 DR]].<ref name=LEoF-p119 />\n\nThe subterranean contained luxurious palace chambers buried under smoking debris, which were filled with [[magic item]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], and [[gold]]. Near the seeping Great Brass Gate, the tunnels were so hot that they glowed, and the air was full of unbreathable smoke.",
        "Inhabitants": "The old mining tunnels below the ruins were inhabited by [[fire elemental]]s, [[mephit]]s, [[salamander]]s, and other creatures of fire. The Great Brass Gate itself was defended by a powerful and loyal [[genie]] named [[Ufbrann]].",
        "History": "Memnon founded his city of Memnonnar around the Great Brass Gate itself. After the city was razed by [[Coramshan]], [[dwarves]] from [[High Shanatar]] settled there for a time. The Calishites built the city of Memnon over the southern ruins but did not rebuild over the river. Periodically, however, they sent armed forces into the ruins to seek for treasure or to hunt down rogue fire elementals."
