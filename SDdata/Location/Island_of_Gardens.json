        "Geography": "The coast of this island was covered with lush foliage, giving the island its name. The island's elevation rose steadily along the eastern and southeastern faces, capping at a cliff 2,500 ft. (762 m) above sea level.\n\nTwin waterfalls located on the southern end of the island were visible at sea from up to 16 miles (25.8 km) away.\n\nThe [[River of Gold]] originated at the top of a steep cliff on the island.\n\nSeveral villages were located near the coast or along the eastern area of forested elevation called the Comb."
