            "Post-Serôs War": "Iakhovas's defeat and the end of the Twelfth Serôs War ultimately did not end Voalidru's occupation, as the remnants of his undead forces continued to linger within its walls.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|59}} As did the priests of Eadro, who spents months playing cat and mouse with the undead.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|68}} Their numbers gradually fell to the undead hordes until they were forced to make their last stand in the temple's central worship chamber under the guidance of high priest [[Jarecah]] and some [[stone golem]]s. In the end only a priest by the name of [[Narvolas]] remained.\n\nOver the next two years the ever determined people of Eaadral would attempt every few months to reclaim Voalidru, only to be turned back by the sheer number of undead. Bands of koalinths, rogue [[ixitxachitl]]s, and merfolk of Clan Kataar would also occasionally plunder the city during this time, whilst doing their best to avoid its undead hordes, eventually looting most of its buildings.\n\nOn [[Midwinter]] (Icesong 31), [[1370 DR]], made their last major attempt to reclaim their city,\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, multiple forces had their eyes set upon the city and rumors surrounding the city's fate began to circulate, alleging that something horrid had taken over the city. Some claiming it was a priesthood of ixitxachitl, while others claimed that it was a kraken. It would also be around this time that the priest Narvolas finally escaped Voalidru with the help of a mermaid named [[Lurelei]], who was hiding in a secret chamber of the temple, and the pair headed northeast for Myth Nantar.\n\nPrince Regent Mirol III, the acting ruler of Eeadral while his father [[Vhaemas]] lay in a coma, was concocting plans to militarily retake Voalidru. He saw this as a means of restoring his nation's lost pride{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|61}} [[Sharna]], ruler of Clan Kataar and its city of [[Thuridru]] following Vhaemas the Bastard's death,<ref> was in a state of waiting for the right opportunity to take Voalidru for her people out of a sense of vengeance.<ref> She maintained a vast network of spies, sympathizers, and officials that she had bribed in order to keep close tabs on Mirol III.\n\nThe ixitxachitl desired recompense against the merfolk for Mirol III's brother Vhaemas the Bastard, as he was partly responsible for the devastation Iakhovas unleashed upon the Xedran Reefs. But for similar reasons of vengeance, the Vitanar was far more focused on plotting against Thuridru. After learning of the existence of the ''Akriloth'' and recognizing its potential to eliminate the undead infestation, it allowed for a devitan by the name of [[Xulkur]] to lead an expedition to retrieve the horn, consisting of ixitxachitl and a small band of koalinths. While there they caught the mermaid Lurelei, who Narvolas left to her fate. Xulkur transformed her into an obedient [[velya]], using her knowledge to recover several lesser [[magic item]]s around the ruins and map the temple for a future assault.",
            "The Akriloth": "At some point during 1371 DR, a few weeks after Narvolas entered Myth Nantar, Mirol III was approached by a small [[fish]] with scintillating blue scales. It told him in a deep, resonant voice that Narvolas was in the city and held the secret to reclaiming Voalidru. Having believed him to have perished in the assault on Voalidru, Mirol III considered this a sign from Eadro and scoured Myth Nantar for the priest, eventually finding him tending to injured refugees in the [[Stadium of Tavynos]]. Narvolas told the Prince Regent of what happened at his temple and of his eventual escape. He spoke adamantly of the ''Akriloth'' being a solution to the undead infestation, that it was likely still within the temple, and advised him to search the city for [[adventurer]]s willing to retrieve it.\n\nFor two weeks Mirol III would as Narvolas advised,{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|60}} This information was quickly relayed to Sharna through her informants, who then issued a cover group in the city to ambush the adventurers.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|64}} and were scouring the temple's first two floors.\n\nThe adventurers made their way through the Temple of Eadro and its many dangers, until finally confronting and defeating Qol'in'taroq within the Grand Hall.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|75}} They then made their way back to Myth Nantar, possibly facing further attacks from Clan Kamaar or minions of Those Who Sleep Belong along the way, and bestowed the retrieved ''Akriloth'' upon Prince Regent Mirol III.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|77}} Mirol granted them honorary membership in Clan [[Homurr]] and was quick to announce his possession of the relic, hyping up the merfolk of Eadraal for a future attempt to take back Voalidru.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|84}}"
