        "mainbody": "Axe Rock was a projecting crag of rock that travelers on the Evermoor Way used as a landmark.\nAxe Rock was located on the north side of the Evermoor Way about two days travel southwest of Everlund.\nA spring emerged from high up in the formidable rock formation, but ancient dwarven stonework guided the drinkable water down smoothly carved troughs and channels to a pond beside the road. The spring was still providing water as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR."
