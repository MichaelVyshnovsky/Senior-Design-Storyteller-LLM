        "mainbody": "'''Holorarar''' was one of the eight subkingdoms of the [[dwarven]] realm of [[Shanatar]]. It was the final kingdom to be founded by the dwarves of Shanatar.",
        "Geography": "Holorarar was located beneath the [[Clovis Fields]], within the surface realm of [[Tethyr]]. It was located roughly in the middle of Deep Shanatar. Most of the realms inhabitants lived in a single massive cavern that was home to a large shallow lake.",
        "Inhabitants": "Within Holorarar, members of nearly every clan of Shanatar made their home, building their houses in a large ring on the cavern walls. Immigration, and the new ideas that came with it, were welcome in the kingdom. As a result, the population of Holorarar grew so rapidly that many dwarves later moved to High Shanatar. After it was abandoned by the [[shield dwarves]], the ruined kingdom was occupied by several tribes of [[hobgoblin]]s, who previously dwelt in the surrounding Underdark. They lived in a state of constant intercine warfare for centuries.",
        "Economy": "Holorarar was the breadbasket of Shanatar and was a wealthy trading hub. It was home to rich fields of golden [[kelp]] and lush growths of [[mushroom]]s.",
        "History": "Holorarar, like the rest of Shanatar, fell during the [[Kin Clashes]] in {{Yearlink|-1800}}. The invading [[duergar]] employed slash-and-burn tactics, devastating the lush farms and fields of the realm. As of {{Yearlink|1372}}, the fallen kingdom was now the home to a kingdom of the same name, inhabitated by numerous tribes of thousands of hobgoblins and other [[goblinoid]]s. After centuries of inter-tribal warfare, in {{Yearlink|-379}}, the hobgoblins finally united as a single nation under a king. It has since grown in population and military strenght. The tribes still feuded with each other but every once in a while united as a single force to conduct massive raids on the surface realms of [[Calimshan]] and Tethyr."
