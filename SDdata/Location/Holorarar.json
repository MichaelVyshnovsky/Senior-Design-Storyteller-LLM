        "mainbody": "Holorarar was one of the eight subkingdoms of the dwarven realm of Shanatar. It was the final kingdom to be founded by the dwarves of Shanatar.\nHolorarar was located beneath the Clovis Fields, within the surface realm of Tethyr. It was located roughly in the middle of Deep Shanatar. Most of the realms inhabitants lived in a single massive cavern that was home to a large shallow lake. \nWithin Holorarar, members of nearly every clan of Shanatar made their home, building their houses in a large ring on the cavern walls. Immigration, and the new ideas that came with it, were welcome in the kingdom. As a result, the population of Holorarar grew so rapidly that many dwarves later moved to High Shanatar. After it was abandoned by the shield dwarves, the ruined kingdom was occupied by several tribes of hobgoblins, who previously dwelt in the surrounding Underdark. They lived in a state of constant intercine warfare for centuries.\nHolorarar was the breadbasket of Shanatar and was a wealthy trading hub. It was home to rich fields of golden kelp and lush growths of mushrooms. \nHolorarar, like the rest of Shanatar, fell during the Kin Clashes in . The invading duergar employed slash-and-burn tactics, devastating the lush farms and fields of the realm. As of , the fallen kingdom was now the home to a kingdom of the same name, inhabitated by numerous tribes of thousands of hobgoblins and other goblinoids. After centuries of inter-tribal warfare, in , the hobgoblins finally united as a single nation under a king. It has since grown in population and military strenght. The tribes still feuded with each other but every once in a while united as a single force to conduct massive raids on the surface realms of Calimshan and Tethyr."
