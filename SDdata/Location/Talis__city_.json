        "Geography": "The city was located in the [[Reaching Woods]] near the [[River Reaching]],<ref> close enough to sound like thunder.",
        "Description": "The road paving stones were intact, except that plant life grew between the cobbles. Most of the buildings had fallen into piles of stones, with vines and trees growing over them. The Talfirc had built a bridge across the River Reaching. Unfortunately, the river had changed its course over the years until it no longer passed under the bridge.",
        "Defenses": "In the city, there was a stone pyramid, and atop of it was a golden orb.<ref> If one touched the orb, it would activate and a bolt of green lightning from the sky hit the orb, the stairs of the pyramid would shift into a ramp, and a pit opened at the base of the pyramid.<ref> The pit was a spherical chamber. The sphere rotated to close the pit so that anyone who fell through the pit couldn't get out.<ref> The orb was used to defend Talis from its enemies. It was activated by the touch of magic.<ref>",
        "History": "No one knew what happened to the Talfirc, they disappeared centuries before the 1300s [[DR]].<ref>\n\nIn [[1364 DR]], the reformed [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]] passed through the city after escaping [[shadevari]].<ref>",
