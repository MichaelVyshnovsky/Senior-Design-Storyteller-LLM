        "mainbody": "The Silverwood was a forest on the eastern borders of the Evermoors and to the west of the Nether Mountains.\nThe Silverwood was once part of the High Forest, but after centuries of logging, the woodcutters took most of the trees on both sides of the Evermoor Way, inflicting a deep wound to the heart of the forest. Bare hills covered with stumps and old fallenÂ trees flanked this plain. The Silverwood survived thanks to its dark and tangled thickets and to its steep and dangerous ground. Many creatures from the Evermoors, including trolls, roamed these woods looking for food."
