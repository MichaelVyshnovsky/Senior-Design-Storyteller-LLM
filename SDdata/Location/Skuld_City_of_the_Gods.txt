The City of the Gods was a sacred section of the capital city of Skuld in Mulhorand during the midâ€“14 century DR. Following the citys destruction during the Spellplague, the City of the Gods became a subject of legend in High Imaskar.
The City of the Gods was located in the northcentral section of the city. 
The entire district was walled, separating it from the rest of Skuld. The only entrance through the walls was through the Tower of Pronouncement located in the center of the southern wall. As its name implied, the City of the Gods housed the vast majority of temples devoted to the various gods of the Mulhorandi pantheon. Incarnations of these gods often lived here as well in elaborate towers.
