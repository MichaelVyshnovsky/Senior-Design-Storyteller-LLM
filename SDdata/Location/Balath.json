        "mainbody": "'''Balath''' was a small [[sahuagin]] colony that was founded sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, when the sahuagin leader [[T'Kalah|Black Claws]] sent a group of his followers out past the recently broken [[Sharksbane Wall]] to establish a foothold in the waters that had long since been closed off to them.<ref>",
        "Description": "Balath consisted of a ruined, abandoned guard tower that was long ago built by [[sea elves]].",
        "Geography": "This underwater settlement was located in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], on the [[Mountains of Volar]], which were roughly west and south of [[Aglarond]] and [[Altumbel]].<ref>",
        "Government": "Like all of sahuagin society in the Sea of Fallen Stars, the people of Balath were to be ruled over by a baron, though midway through 1370 DR they had not settled on who would be their leader. The men in the community were frequently battling for dominance to claim the title.\n\nThe sahuagin of Balath owed fealty to King Black Claws back in [[Kurrimal]], though they rarely returned to his settlement in the [[Alamber Sea]].",
        "History": "Over the course of its first year as a settlement, Balath fell under attack many times by the nearby tribes of [[koalinth]]s and [[merrow (ogre)|merrows]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The population of Balath numbered 35 males and 18 females. Three of these women were [[priest]]esses and frequently battled among each other to decide who would come out on top as the village's high priestess of [[Sekolah]]. The population's first batch of eggs were due to hatch by the end of 1370 DR."
