The men in the community were frequently battling for dominance to claim the title.\nThe sahuagin of Balath owed fealty to King Black Claws back in Kurrimal, though they rarely returned to his settlement in the Alamber Sea.\nOver the course of its first year as a settlement, Balath fell under attack many times by the nearby tribes of koalinths and merrows.\nThe population of Balath numbered 35 males and 18 females. Three of these women were priestesses and frequently battled among each other to decide who would come out on top as the villages high priestess of Sekolah. The populations first batch of eggs were due to hatch by the end of 1370 DR."
