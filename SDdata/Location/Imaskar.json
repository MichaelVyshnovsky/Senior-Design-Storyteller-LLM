        "mainbody": "The '''Imaskar Empire''' (also known as the '''Raurin''' Empire) was an ancient [[human]] nation that ruled lands in the east that came to comprise the nations of [[Mulhorand]], [[Thay]], and [[Unther]]. Its citizens were the [[Imaskari]]. Imaskari wizards, also known as Artificers, were overwhelmingly powerful and just as haughty. The Emperor of the Imaskari bore the title of Lord Artificer.",
        "History": {
            "Nemrut Period": "In the year {{Yearlink|-8350}} a splinter tribe of the ancient [[Durpari]] began to settle the then-fertile basin of the [[Raurin]] Plateau. This started the ''Nemrut'' period of the civilization, named after the civilization's first warlord.",
            "Early Dynastic Period": "The capital city of [[Inupras]] was founded in {{Yearlink|-7975}}. [[Bukhara Spires]] were constructed during this period; circles of bronze spires which held two-way portals, allowing for rapid transportation of whole legions across vast distances. Those portals allowed Imaskar to rapidly expand across East [[Faerûn]].\n\nIn {{yearlink|-7891}}, the Imaskari annexed and enslaved the [[kobold]] kingdom of [[Zexthandrim]] in the [[Mountains of Copper]], demanding tribute from the subjugated people in [[gold]] and [[gems]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|61}} The [[korobokuru]] [[dwarves]] of [[Shan Nala]] were also subjugated during this time.\n\nThe empire also subjugated the Taangan, ancestors of the [[Tuigan]] and other tribes, in {{yearlink|-7100}}, demanding semi-annual tribute from these nomads.{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|54}} Durpar, Ulgarth and Khati were also annexed at around that time. The Empire remained undefeated until {{yearlink|-6788}}, when its western outpost in [[Aerilpar Forest|Aerilpar]] was besieged by [[forest landwyrm|forest landwyrms]]. In {{yearlink|-6779}}, there was a peasant rebellion in Raudor, which was soon put down.",
            "Middle Kingdoms Period": "In {{Yearlink|-6422}}, rampaging [[krakentua]] razed the capital, Inupras. The anarchy that followed caused a split between the territories of Upper and Lower Imaskar, beginning the Middle Kingdoms period. Upper Imaskar's capital became Thakos, later [[Saikhoi]].\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-4370}} a suspicious plague known as the [[Silent Death]] decimated Lower Imaskari cities. Mysteriously, a blight destroyed their crops at about the same time. Fifteen to twenty out of each hundred Imaskari citizens perished to the plague even in the most lightly affected areas, and the survivors were then subject to a famine. Lower Imaskar only survived this period because their enemies failed to capitalize on their weakness. The Lower Imaskari turned against their priests in response to their inability to cure the plague, and most priests were slain or driven into exile. The Silent Death did spread north into the later Endless Wastes, but Upper Imaskar remained safe and untouched.\n\nFour years later, desperate to rebuild but with a devastated population, Lord Artificer [[Khotan]] commissioned two more Bukhara spires, which would form a portal to a world with no knowledge of [[the Art]]. Through those portals, the Imaskari brought hundreds of thousands of people from to be enslaved. The slaves prayed hard for salvation, but the prayers went unheard since the wizards had closed all portals and created a barrier cutting the slaves off from their gods.",
            "Late Period and Destruction": "Lord Artificer [[Omanond]] reunified Upper and Lower Imaskar in {{yearlink|-3920}}, once more placing the capital in Inupras, ending the ''Shartra'' and beginning the Late Period of the Imaskari empire. Under orders from Lord Artificer Omanond in [[-3891 DR]], Imaskari artificers created the [[Imaskarcana]] – seven items in which the empire's immense magical lore is recorded for all eternity. Also under his reign, in {{Yearlink|-3234}}, the Imaskari created the outpost known as [[Metos]] in [[Methwood]] as its westernmost outpost.<ref> At some point after this, the wizard [[Madryoch]] attempted to overthrow Omanond, only to be thwarted by the artificer Hilather, who banished him to the [[Demiplane of Imprisonment]].\n\nIn [[-2489 DR]], There they split into more divine forms, such as mortal forms of avatars, known as incarnations.  These descended into the fertile plain below amongst their long-lost people. The most talented they made into priests; the truly faithful were transformed into divine minions. Thus bolstered, the slaves soon rebelled throughout the Imaskar empire.\n\nMany of the greatest wizard-lords of the realm battled to the last. The situation was truly desperate for Imaskar; in [[Jorhat Citadel]], the artificer [[Mardava]] employed a spell that slew not only the slaves besieging it, but all of the defenders and herself as well. Facing imminent defeat, the [[Elder Evil]] [[Pandorym]] was summoned and imprisoned in the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]] while attempts were made to control it, so as to use it as a deterrent; they would not succeed in time to prevent the destruction of the Empire.\n\nThe Imaskar Empire was completely destroyed in {{Yearlink|-2488}}, when the emperor, [[Yuvaraj|Lord Yuvaraj]], fell in battle with [[Horus-Re|Horus]] in Inupras."
        },
        "Successors": "While the western Imaskari Empire was leveled by the Mulhorandi rebellion, the eastern holdings of the Empire endured. In {{yearlink|-2487}}, an artificer by the name of [[Kujawa]], bearing Dhonas' Shroud, one of the seven [[False Imaskarcana]], claimed the Dragon Throne at [[Saikhoi|Thakos]], founding thusly the Empire of [[Anok-Imaskar]] and declaring himself Emperor. Likewise, a smaller empire sprang up around the city of [[Solon]].\n\nThe most direct descendant of the Imaskari Empire was the city of [[Deep Imaskar]] in the Underdark, founded by [[Ilphemon|Lord Ilphemon]].\n\n[[Bakar]] was a survivor state of Imaskar in the valley of the [[River Athis]] which followed the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], though by around {{Yearlink|300}}{{Amun-Re-time}} the river had dried up and the kingdom collapsed.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|4}}\n\nMost of the languages of the Hordelands were [[Imaskari languages]], suggesting that the people of the Hordelands were descendants of the ancient empire.",
