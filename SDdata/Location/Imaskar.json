        "mainbody": "The Imaskar Empire (also known as the Raurin Empire) was an ancient human nation that ruled lands in the east that came to comprise the nations of Mulhorand, Thay, and Unther. Its citizens were the Imaskari. Imaskari wizards, also known as Artificers, were overwhelmingly powerful and just as haughty. The Emperor of the Imaskari bore the title of Lord Artificer.\nThe earliest of all known records describe the great empire of Imaskar. Ruled by powerful godless human wizards, this empire was centered in what is now the Raurin Desert. Its borders were vast by the end of its Early Dynastic Period, in -6422 DR, they reached from the Golden Water to the Great Ice Sea and from the Alamber Sea to the Katakoro Plateau.\nIn the year  a splinter tribe of the ancient Durpari began to settle the then-fertile basin of the Raurin Plateau. This started the Nemrut period of the civilization, named after the civilizations first warlord.\nThe capital city of Inupras was founded in . Bukhara Spires were constructed during this period circles of bronze spires which held two-way portals, allowing for rapid transportation of whole legions across vast distances. Those portals allowed Imaskar to rapidly expand across East Faerûn.\nIn , the Imaskari annexed and enslaved the kobold kingdom of Zexthandrim in the Mountains of Copper, demanding tribute from the subjugated people in gold and gems. The korobokuru dwarves of Shan Nala were also subjugated during this time.\nThe empire also subjugated the Taangan, ancestors of the Tuigan and other tribes, in , demanding semi-annual tribute from these nomads. Durpar, Ulgarth and Khati were also annexed at around that time. The Empire remained undefeated until , when its western outpost in Aerilpar was besieged by forest landwyrms. In , there was a peasant rebellion in Raudor, which was soon put down.\nIn , rampaging krakentua razed the capital, Inupras. The anarchy that followed caused a split between the territories of Upper and Lower Imaskar, beginning the Middle Kingdoms period. Upper Imaskars capital became Thakos, later Saikhoi.\nIn  a suspicious plague known as the Silent Death decimated Lower Imaskari cities. Mysteriously, a blight destroyed their crops at about the same time. Fifteen to twenty out of each hundred Imaskari citizens perished to the plague even in the most lightly affected areas, and the survivors were then subject to a famine. Lower Imaskar only survived this period because their enemies failed to capitalize on their weakness. The Lower Imaskari turned against their priests in response to their inability to cure the plague, and most priests were slain or driven into exile. The Silent Death did spread north into the later Endless Wastes, but Upper Imaskar remained safe and untouched.\nFour years later, desperate to rebuild but with a devastated population, Lord Artificer Khotan commissioned two more Bukhara spires, which would form a portal to a world with no knowledge of the Art. Through those portals, the Imaskari brought hundreds of thousands of people from to be enslaved. The slaves prayed hard for salvation, but the prayers went unheard since the wizards had closed all portals and created a barrier cutting the slaves off from their gods.\nLord Artificer Omanond reunified Upper and Lower Imaskar in , once more placing the capital in Inupras, ending the Shartra and beginning the Late Period of the Imaskari empire. Under orders from Lord Artificer Omanond in -3891 DR, Imaskari artificers created the Imaskarcana – seven items in which the empires immense magical lore is recorded for all eternity. Also under his reign, in , the Imaskari created the outpost known as Metos in Methwood as its westernmost outpost. At some point after this, the wizard Madryoch attempted to overthrow Omanond, only to be thwarted by the artificer Hilather, who banished him to the Demiplane of Imprisonment.\nIn -2489 DR, There they split into more divine forms, such as mortal forms of avatars, known as incarnations.  These descended into the fertile plain below amongst their long-lost people. The most talented they made into priests the truly faithful were transformed into divine minions. Thus bolstered, the slaves soon rebelled throughout the Imaskar empire.\nMany of the greatest wizard-lords of the realm battled to the last. The situation was truly desperate for Imaskar in Jorhat Citadel, the artificer Mardava employed a spell that slew not only the slaves besieging it, but all of the defenders and herself as well. Facing imminent defeat, the Elder Evil Pandorym was summoned and imprisoned in the Palace of the Purple Emperor while attempts were made to control it, so as to use it as a deterrent they would not succeed in time to prevent the destruction of the Empire.\nThe Imaskar Empire was completely destroyed in , when the emperor, Lord Yuvaraj, fell in battle with Horus in Inupras.\nWhile the western Imaskari Empire was leveled by the Mulhorandi rebellion, the eastern holdings of the Empire endured. In , an artificer by the name of Kujawa, bearing Dhonas Shroud, one of the seven False Imaskarcana, claimed the Dragon Throne at Thakos, founding thusly the Empire of Anok-Imaskar and declaring himself Emperor. Likewise, a smaller empire sprang up around the city of Solon.\nThe most direct descendant of the Imaskari Empire was the city of Deep Imaskar in the Underdark, founded by Lord Ilphemon.\nBakar was a survivor state of Imaskar in the valley of the River Athis which followed the Mulhorandi pantheon, though by around  the river had dried up and the kingdom collapsed.\nMost of the languages of the Hordelands were Imaskari languages, suggesting that the people of the Hordelands were descendants of the ancient empire.\nA number of Imaskari ruins dot Raurin and the Plains of Purple Dust.\n* Bhaluin\n* Fortress of Jorhat\n* Metos\n* Palace of the Purple Emperor\n* Raudor\n* Solon\n* Sonjars Tower\n* Adamas Tooth (Monolith)\n* Celestial Nadir\n* The Bear Gods Barrow\n* Sentinelspire"
