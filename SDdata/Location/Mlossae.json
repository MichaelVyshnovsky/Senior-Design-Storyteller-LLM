        "mainbody": "Mlossae was a realm of sea elves that claimed the area around the Shipgrave Isles off the coast of Halruaa in south Faer√ªn circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nThe Shipgrave Isles in the Great Sea were surrounded by Mlossae.\nIn 1370 DR, Mlossae was ruled by Deep King Baerdelcoam the Bluebearded who kept his kingdom on a war footing.\nThis prosperous nation had a large army of warriors equipped with armor made from giant sea shells. Plates (including the barbs) were harvested and hardened into armor and shields. The soldiers were known to occasionally ride giant squid or octopus that could lift a boulder out of the water and hurl it at a ship.\nThe Mlossam supposedly guarded several legendary human cities that sunk beneath the waves long ago, and mined them for powerful magic items that they carried into battle."
