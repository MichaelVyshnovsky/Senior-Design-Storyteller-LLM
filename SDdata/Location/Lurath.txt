Lurath was a small island in the Pirate Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
Lurath sat near the center of the Pirate Isles along the Windrace and the northern edge of the Bowl.
Lurath covered roughly  of area. This island stood apart from the other islands of the Pirate Isles in that it had very little lowlands. Most of Luraths coast was dominated by sheer cliff faces. The cliffs actually concealed a circular valley and tropical paradise at Luraths heart.
Though few outsiders ever saw them, Lurath was populated by primitive elvish creatures. They were quite friendly. Several types of dangerous dinosaur lived in the valley as well.
Access to the tropical valley in the center of the island was only possible through a series of caves. However, passing through the caves actually brought travelers back in time to a primitive age before humans. Anyone attempting to leave the valley by any means other than the caves found they were trapped in a primitive time period ruled by dragons.
