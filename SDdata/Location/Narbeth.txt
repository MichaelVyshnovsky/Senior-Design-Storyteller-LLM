'''Narbeth''' was a realm of [[gold elves]] that occupied the northeast edge of the [[Shalhoond]] in southern [[Taan]] ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].{{Cite dragon/267/The New Adventures of Volo: Onward!|83}}

==Geography==
Narbeth claimed the edge of the Shalhoond forest east of [[Khopet-Dag]] (aka the Spiderhaunt Peaks)See [[Forum:Northeast Faerun|this discussion]] for the consensus on locations being placed in [[east Faer√ªn]], the [[Hordelands]], and [[Kara-Tur]].

==Government==
This realm was a kingdom long ruled by [[House Raryndur]]. As of 1370 DR, the ruler was Great King [[Aumanas Raryndur]].

==Trade==
The elves of Narbeth had very little contact with the world outside their borders, except when protecting those borders.

==Society==
The Narbathans were not as haughty as most of their high elf kin. Although somewhat reclusive, they had a broader sense of humor and were content in their idyllic home. Their favorite pursuit was hunting on foot in the forest, often led by the Great King. They made (and enjoyed) a strong [[wine]] from berries found in the forest.

==History==
The throne of Narbeth was held by House Raryndur for millennia. As of 1372 DR, there were no other serious contenders for the throne since a conflict with [[House Oumryn]] resulted in the apparent elimination of the Oumryndar sometime in the distant past.

==Rumors & Legends==
Because of the speed at which they can move through the forest in pursuit of prey, some [[sage]]s claim the people of Narbeth can ''[[dimension door]]'' at will. The abundance of monsters in the Shalhoond, coupled with the Narbathan love of hunting, has led to rumors of [[deepspawn]] inhabiting the forest and the conjecture that the Narbathans put them there in order to have an endless supply of game.
