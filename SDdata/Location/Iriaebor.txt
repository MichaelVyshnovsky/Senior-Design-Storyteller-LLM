Iriaebor (), also known as the Overland City and the City of a Thousand Spires, was a large city in Sunset Vale in the Western Heartlands region of west Faerûn. While it retained its status as an independent city-state, it remained within the realm of influence of the 15 century nation of Elturgard.
While it was considered to be one of the most densely-populated and economically influential locales in western Faerûn, it was believed its true potential as a great power was stymied by the petty squabbles and in-fighting that plagued many of its residents.
Many of the narrow streets of Iriaebor were covered in shadows during all hours of the day due to the great many bridges and overhanging balconies that connected its many decrepit stone towers. The fact that these often-slanted spires were built too close to one another lent to a feeling of claustrophobia and confinement that pervaded the city. Because space was limited in Iriaebor, so many of the locals simply built upwards rather than outwards.

Iriaebor enjoyed a competitive rivalry with nearby Scornubel, and an even stronger one with its neighboring city of Berdusk, the latter of which which was nicknamed the Jewel of the Vale much to the chagrin of the Iraebans. Despite their competition with one another, the two cities remained allies with one another.
The keep that housed the Kelemvorite Knights of the Eternal Order was located a short distance away from Iriaebor, and the Old Talking Ox inn was situated about an hours ride north along the Dusk Road.

During the mid–14 century DR, the city of Iriaebor was a member in good standing of the Lords Alliance, the unified coalition of powers that combated the growing influence of the Zhentarim. It was then ruled by Bron, Lord  Most High, Keeper of the High Tower, Watchwarden of the Flowing Chionthar, with the support and guidance of a forty-person merchant council. While he appointed and dismissed the members of the council, his decisions were very much guided by their greater consensus. 
For a brief time in 1363 DR, the Zhentarim emerged victorious in their efforts against Iriaebor, managing to take control of the city and put in place their own puppet ruler, Lord Ravendas.
