}}'''Iriaebor''' ({{Pronounce|eer|ee|AY|bore|refs=}}), also known as the '''Overland City''' and the '''City of a Thousand Spires''', was a large city in [[Sunset Vale]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] region of [[west Faerûn]]. While it retained its status as an independent city-state, it remained within the realm of influence of the 15{{th}} century nation of [[Elturgard]].

While it was considered to be one of the most densely-populated and economically influential locales in [[West Faerûn|western Faerûn]], it was believed its true potential as a great power was stymied by the petty squabbles and in-fighting that plagued many of its residents.

{{Quote|Iriaebor is like [[Waterdeep]] gone mad when it comes to merchant manipulations, chicanery, and maneuvering.|[[Volothamp Geddarm]], from his [[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast (in-universe)|namesake guide to the Sword Coast]].}}

==Description==
Many of the narrow streets of Iriaebor were covered in shadows during all hours of the day due to the great many bridges and overhanging balconies that connected its many decrepit stone towers. The fact that these often-slanted spires were built too close to one another lent to a feeling of claustrophobia and confinement that pervaded the city. Because space was limited in Iriaebor, so many of the locals simply built upwards rather than outwards. 

==Geography==
[[File:Iriaebor.jpg|thumb|400px|''Iriaebor and surrounding area circa 1479 DR.'']]
The city stood on a sprawling ridge known locally as the [[Tor]], above the north fork of the river [[Chionthar]],

Iriaebor enjoyed a competitive rivalry with nearby [[Scornubel]], and an even stronger one with its neighboring city of [[Berdusk]], the latter of which which was nicknamed the ''Jewel of the Vale'' much to the chagrin of the Iraebans. Despite their competition with one another, the two cities remained allies with one another.

The keep that housed the [[Kelemvor]]ite [[Knights of the Eternal Order]] was located a short distance away from Iriaebor, and the [[Old Talking Ox]] inn was situated about an hour's ride north along the Dusk Road.

===Geographical Features===
The vast plains that surrounded Iriaebor were ideal for the many animal-breeders and mount-tamers that chose to ply their craft in and around the city.

==Demonym==
A person from Iriaebor was known as an Iriaeben or Iriaeban.

==Government==
During the mid–14{{th}} century DR, the city of Iriaebor was a member in good standing of the [[Lords' Alliance]], the unified coalition of powers that combated the growing influence of the [[Zhentarim]]. It was then ruled by [[Bron]], Lord  Most High, Keeper of the High Tower, Watchwarden of the Flowing Chionthar, with the support and guidance of a forty-person merchant council. While he appointed and dismissed the members of the council, his decisions were very much guided by their greater consensus. 

For a brief time in [[1363 DR]], the Zhentarim emerged victorious in their efforts against Iriaebor, managing to take control of the city and put in place their own puppet ruler, Lord [[Ravendas]].

At some time during or before the late 15{{th}} century DR, Iriaebor was considered to be a "strong and independent city", and despite favors being thrown at it, Iriaebor was resisting being annexed into the neighboring nation of [[Elturgard]].

==Trade==
Iriaebor carried the caravan trade on the Dusk Road over the rapids and rough water of the upper [[Chionthar]] river, and linked up with the [[Trader's Road]]. [[Elturel]], [[Baldur's Gate]], and even as far east as [[Arabel]] in the kingdom of [[Cormyr]].

Iriaeban [[horse]]-breeders had a reputation for the exceptional mounts that they produced.

==Culture==
One of the periodical [[chapbook]]s of note in Iriaebor was ''[[Malanxer's Tongue]]''. It published rants aimed at local corrupt politicians, merchants, and other individuals of note.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151030080255/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_101112-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Oct – Dec 2006| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Defense==
The [[Shield of Iriaebor]] was the name of the fighting force that protected the city. The well-armed military acted to both police the city and patrol the surrounding lands. ''Circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century they numbered about 8,000 strong — 2,000 of whom were local warriors and newly-trained recruits, with the remainder comprised of hired sell-swords.

==History==
One conflict that arose involving Iriaebor was a great army of [[orc]] and [[goblinoid]] forces that descended upon the city in the {{YearlinkName|1264}}. During the battle, it was reported that the fervent [[Helm]]ite servant [[Garshond]] received the legendary ''[[Helm of Helm]]'', and wore it until the city's invaders were turned away.

In autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, Lord Bron disappeared from within the city and the Zhentarim moved swiftly to supplant him with their own leader, Lord Ravendas.

Some [[1367|four years later]], the [[Spotted plague]] broke out throughout Iriaebor, killing a score of citizens before it was stopped by the combined clergies of the city's temples.

Just prior to the calamitous [[Second Sundering]], in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Iriaebor was hit by a memorable earthquake.

==Notable Locations==

The city was split into three sections: The Docks district was situated on the area south at the base of the tor, along the northern shore of the River Chionthar; the Old City, which housed many of the city's most important landmarks was built on the Tor itself; while the Lower City comprised the flatlands north of the Tor, set within the northern city walls.

==Inhabitants==
{{Quote|People deserve to live in freedom. I'm not going to let the Zhentarim take that away from the people who live in this city.|[[Mari Al'maren]], agent of the [[Harpers]].}}

Iriaebor had a long history of intrigue and conflict that emerged amongst the various mercantile groups, influential Iriaeban families and greater factions that took hold within its walls. the far-reaching [[Knights of the Shield]], the [[Six Coffers Market Priakos]], and the powerful [[Men of the Basilisk]].

A number of dastardly groups made their headquarters in Iriaebor, including the [[Black Band]], the [[Broken Dagger (organization)|Broken Dagger]], the [[Flamefingers]], as well as [[Night Skulls]] thieves' guild, and later the [[Purple Masks Guild]].> While the city received influence from the Zhentarim for some time, it was wholly taken over by the organization for a brief while in the 1360s DR.
