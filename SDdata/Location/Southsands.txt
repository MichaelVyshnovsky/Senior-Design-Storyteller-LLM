The '''Southsands''' was a beach on the [[Vilhon Reach]] just south of [[Hlondeth]].

==History==
Mock battles between representatives of [[Chondath]] and [[Turmish]] were held on the Southsands. This unique [[Shieldmeet]] contest, which was held every four years, dated back to [[300 DR]]. The winner would be granted certain trading privileges, initial resource claims, and a tithe of slaves.
