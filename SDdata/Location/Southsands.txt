The Southsands was a beach on the Vilhon Reach just south of Hlondeth.
Mock battles between representatives of Chondath and Turmish were held on the Southsands. This unique Shieldmeet contest, which was held every four years, dated back to 300 DR. The winner would be granted certain trading privileges, initial resource claims, and a tithe of slaves.
