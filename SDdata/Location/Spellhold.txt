'''Spellhold''' was a fortified institution located on the island of [[Brynnlaw]], one of the [[Nelanther Isles]], off the western coast of [[Amn]], under the command of the [[Cowled Wizards]] of [[Amn]].

==Description==
There was a portal to the [[Underdark]] in a secret room on the main floor of the building.

The building itself was connected to a magical dungeon, which was used in exceedingly rare cases to test inmates to see if they were sane enough to leave.

==Activities==
Known officially as '''The Residence for the Magically Deviant''', Spellhold served three primary purposes for the Cowled Wizards.

Firstly, and most famously, it was used as a prison to house the "deviants" they found in [[Athkatla]] who were caught practicing [[magic]] without an official license. This was the role it was best known for among the common people of Amn.

Secondly, Spellhold was an insane asylum that the Cowled Wizards maintained for spellcasters who had lost their mind because of various factors. Because individuals would typically maintain their spellcasting abilities despite their impaired reasoning, they were highly dangerous and too powerful for most mental institutions to look after. Spellhold officially attempted to cure these individuals where possible, and contain them when not.

Finally, Spellhold was used by the Cowled Wizards to hold and study individuals who displayed unusual magical talents or afflictions, ostensibly in hopes of curing them or at least learning from their plight.

Individuals held at the Residence for the Magically Deviant could qualify for multiple statuses. For example, the [[conjurer]] [[Aphril]] had magically imbued herself with the ability to perceive locations across the [[planes]] at will, but was unable to turn this ability offâ€”something that had afflicted her with crippling paranoid dementia.

Despite its ostensibly noble purposes, Spellhold was not above corruption, especially given that it was maintained in total seclusion by the Cowled Wizards, who answered to no authority beyond their own.

==History==
The cursed [[elf|elven]] [[mage]] [[Jon Irenicus]], as well as the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Imoen]], were sentenced to Spellhold for casting illegal arcane magic within the confines of [[Athkatla]]. While being imprisoned, Irenicus was too powerful to contain and killed all of the Cowled Wizards who resided there, taking over the facility to perform his own experiments. Irenicus's [[vampire]] sister, [[Bodhi]], used the lower-floor dungeons as a hunting ground to toy with those who made it there.

An earthquake off the coast of Amn damaged the prison in [[1377 DR]], allowing several of the inmates to escape, seeking revenge against Amn.

It was eventually abandoned and in the decades prior to [[1479 DR]] several adventuring parties attempted to loot Spellhold of its valuables but were never heard from again. It became known as an anathema to the otherwise ordered nation of Amn.
