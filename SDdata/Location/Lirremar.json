        "mainbody": "Lirremar, the Sixth City of the Sword, was one of the main cities of Jhaamdaths imperial core.\nThe Sixth City was a few days west of Golmuth and Gharrent on the southern foothills of the Orsraun Mountains. After the destruction of Jhaamdath, the ruins were built upon by the city of Hlondeth.\nLirremar was founded on Jhaamdaths western frontier in  as the realms sixth major city. Its foundation was publicly justified by the ongoing wars to the west between Coramshan and High Shanatar.\nJhaamdath entered into a short era of aggressive imperial conquest in , which resulted in the deforestation of the Chondalwood and the slaughter of the Nikerymath elves. The elves retaliated in the , by performing a High Magic ritual that caused a huge wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the heartlands of Jhaamdath. Though the new Vilhon Reach cut deep into the interior, the ruins of Lirremar remained above water and were eventually resettled as the port city of Hlondeth in 50 DR.\nThe nearby sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR, becoming the Vilhon Wilds. These momentous changes were rapidly reverted in 1486 DR when the low-lying ruins were submerged once more by the Great Rain and Second Sundering."
