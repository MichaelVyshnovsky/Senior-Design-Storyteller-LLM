Before turning north, the road bifurcated, and its southern branch, known as Southcliff Way, served the southern farms before connecting with the High Road south of the South Gate.\nUndercliff was famous for its various inns, which attracted many visitors and were exempt from the taxation that businesses in the city proper were subject to.
