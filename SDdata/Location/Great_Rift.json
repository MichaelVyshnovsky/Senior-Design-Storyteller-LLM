What remained of the Great Rift became known as [[East Rift]]. Underhome was destroyed in the cataclysm and the capital was moved to Eartheart.\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]] in [[1486 DR]]. the quest of the four chosen ([[Kleef Kenric]], [[Malik el Sami]], [[Joelle Emmeline]] and [[Arietta Seasilver]]) to deliver the [[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|''Eye of Gruumsh'']] to [[Grumbar]] for [[Luthic]] and to stop [[Shar]] restored the canyon to its former earthly land before the Spellplague.\n{{Climate/Shining South/Plains|the Great Rift}}"
