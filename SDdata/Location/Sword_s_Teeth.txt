The Swords Teeth was a large set of cliffs that stretched across the Sword Coast.
The almost vertical cliffs appeared to run from just above where the River Chionthar emptied into the Trackless Sea and continued up the Sword Coast.
Those who sailed across the Trackless Sea and the Sea of Swords told stories of gargantuan caverns within the faces of the cliffs. Some claimed that the caves led to places far underneath the ground, such as the Underdark, whilst others believed the legendary Balduran stashed much of his wealth within one of them.
