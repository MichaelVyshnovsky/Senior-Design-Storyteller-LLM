The '''Sword's Teeth''' was a large set of cliffs that stretched across the [[Sword Coast]].

==Description==
The almost vertical cliffs appeared to run from just above where the [[River Chionthar]] emptied into the [[Trackless Sea]] and continued up the Sword Coast.

==Rumors & Legends==
Those who sailed across the Trackless Sea and the [[Sea of Swords]] told stories of gargantuan caverns within the faces of the cliffs. Some claimed that the caves led to places far underneath the ground, such as the [[Underdark]], whilst others believed the legendary [[Balduran]] stashed much of his wealth within one of them.
