'''Yoetsu''' was a town located on the island of [[Kabudono]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
The port town of Yoetsu served as a harbor for the [[wako]], where Kozakuran vessels tended to harass them less due to the high concentration of wako [[junk]]s found there. Kozakuran merchants typically avoided Yoetsu, but smugglers and small traders were drawn to its diverse marketplaces, where they could acquire cut-rate goods. In this bustling port, almost anything could be obtained for a price, as most of the goods sold were the spoils of pirate raids.

==Inhabitants==
The ''[[Golden Lily]]'', a junk belonging to wako captain [[Pan Chu]], regularly docked in Yoetsu. Captain Pan Chu and other wako captains were often be found in the [[sake]] shops and establishments along the waterfront, making them accessible for contact and business dealings.
