Rauvincross was a village standing at the northern entrance of the Moon Pass through the Nether Mountains just south of Sundabar.
The community rested along the trail between Everlund and Sundabar which crossed the River Rauvin.
The village was home to many of the drivers and mule teams that worked the paths around the Moon Pass Gorge.
