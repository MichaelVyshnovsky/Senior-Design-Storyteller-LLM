TQuession was a sea elf hamlet in the Deepwater Harbor of Waterdeep.
The hamlet was founded in 1367 DR, after the sea elves were driven from their homes by the Army of Iakhovas. The newly settled sea elves petitioned to join Waterdeeps City Guard, though only some were allowed to join. The other sea elves continued to act as merchants, selling seafood and other undersea treasures.
The people of TQuession would later fight alongside Waterdeep in the Deepwater War, suffering significant losses in their population in the process.
