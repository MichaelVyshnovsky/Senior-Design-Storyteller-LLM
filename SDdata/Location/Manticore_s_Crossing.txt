The '''Manticore's Crossing''' was a crossing on the [[Way of the Manticore]] in [[Cormyr]].<ref group="note">It is actually unknown where and what Manticore's Crossing is, but the name strongly suggests a crossroad or river ford on the Way of the Manticore, so this is assumed here.

It was the site of a battle between the army of King [[Galaghard III]] and the [[undead]] forces of the [[Witch Lords]] in the {{YearlinkName|900}}. The Cormyreans were victorious, but the undead would rise again.
