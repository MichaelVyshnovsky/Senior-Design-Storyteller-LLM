        "mainbody": "he Fireshear Vale was a great crevasse that opened up the icy tundra of the Cold Run. It comprised a long fissure that opened up into a massive crater.\nThe landmark lent its name to the port town that formed at its western edge.\nThe sides of the vale were marred and blackened, as if they were scorched by flame. Within its depths were veins of copper and silver ore.\nThe exact origin of Fireshear Vale was unknown to most scholars. Some believed the large crater to be a caldera, formed by volcanic activities. Others believed the entire vale was the lasting effect of a star that fell from the skies."
