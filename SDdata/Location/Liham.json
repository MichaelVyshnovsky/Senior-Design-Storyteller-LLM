        "mainbody": "iham, located at the mouth of Al-Sari River, was the most southerly of Zakharas Free Cities circa 1367 DR.\nIt also lay nearest to powerful Qudra, which, together with the presence of several mamluk units, gave the larger city enormous influence on Lihams politics. The large military led to the title \"City of Soldiers\", but it was also called Liham the Red, because the citizens enjoyed wearing clothing in various shades of crimson."
