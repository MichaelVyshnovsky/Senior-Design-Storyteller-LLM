'''Karador''' was a small city located in the middle of the [[Myrloch]] on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]]. As of [[1479 DR]], the city was ruled by the [[fey]] queen High Lady [[Ordalf]] as the capital of [[Sarifal]], although her son Prince [[Araithe]] handled the day-to-day running of the government.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|}}

==Inhabitants==
Most residents of Karador were Llewyrr [[elves]], wood elves, [[gnomes]], or [[banshrae]] although a few [[human]]s lived in the city.  Visitors to the city were uncommon.

==Defenses==
The city was protected by a powerful [[mythal]] which could shift the city to and from the [[Feywild]]. The few [[leShay]] fey who lived in the city were powerful [[mage|arcanists]], more powerful than elven high mages.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Diamond Thimble]], an armor shop owned by the gnome [[Omik Twede]].
* [[House of Autumn]], one of the few inns in the city.

==History==
Karador was abandoned in {{Yearlink|-500}} when the fey retreated to the Feywild, causing the city to sink beneath the water of the Myrloch.<ref name=D362">{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

Around the time of the [[Spellplague]], High Lady Ordalf moved the city through a ''[[portal]]'' from the Feywild and it rose from the depths of Lake Myrloch. The fey forces soon routed the High King's troops and took control of the entire island of Gwynneth.
