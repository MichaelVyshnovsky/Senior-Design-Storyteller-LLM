        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The majority of the trees in the Forest of Shadows were [[elm]] and [[oak]] trees, though in the higher altitudes, on the slopes of the Snowflake mountains, one could find [[pine]] trees and dusktops.Because this seems to be the only reference to \"dusktops\" in any Forgotten Realms sourcebook, it is believed that this was a typo for either \"[[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]]\" or \"[[shadowtop]]\". See [[Talk:Shadowtop#AKA]] for a brief discussion on this issue."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "As of [[1370 DR]], only a single wild elven tribe remained in the forest, hidden in scattered encampments. King Elbereth had a standing order to kill anyone who felled tree or elf.",
        "Defenses": "The ancient trees were rumored to be imbued with magic and, if called, would provide aid in battle. This was proved by [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], who summoned them with the help of a tome written by [[Dellanil Quil'quien]] to fight an army of [[orc]]s led by [[Ragnor]] and [[Dorigen]] of [[Castle Trinity]].",
        "History": "The forest of Shilmista was once a part of the great elven forest kingdom of [[Keltormir]]. During the wars with [[giant]]s and [[dragon]]s, the forest became separated from the [[Forest of Tethir]] and was a part of the forest then known as the [[Wyrmwood]]. This was called the \"First Tethirift\".\n\nDuring the [[Shoon Imperium]], the elves of Shilmista were nearly driven to extinction by [[human]]s.\n\nFrom [[731 DR]] until [[757 DR]], the elves of Shilmista fought a war against the [[Ring of Eyes]], a group of [[beholder]]s and cultists from the [[Lake of Steam region]].\n\n[[Galladel]], Elbereth's father, once ruled the forest. Galladel was [[Dellanil Quil'quien]]'s great-grandson. In [[1361 DR]] the ancient forest was invaded by a huge army led by the [[ogrillon]] Ragnor. Ragnor killed Galladel, and Elbereth was proclaimed king. When Cadderly Bonaduce and Elbereth aroused the ancient trees of the forest, the elves were able to purge the forest of orcs, [[goblin]]s, and any other enemies.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], after the defection of [[Riatavin]] and [[Trailstone]] from Amn in [[1370 DR]], the elves of Shilmista made cautious establishment of communication with Tethyr, by means of High Scrivener Cadderly Bonaduce, and eventually, the forest became a part of that land.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "[[Bowgentle's Grove]]": "This calm glade in the south of the forest was the burial place of the [[wizard]] [[Bowgentle]], who was a friend of the elves of Shilmista.",
            "[[Daoine Dun]]": "\"The Hill of the Stars\", this place contained a large cavern complex and was used by the elves for defense and as a ceremonial ground.",
            "[[The Dells]]": "These plateaus in the north of the forest were used by the elves for defense.",
            "[[Deny Ridge]]": "This high ground in the center of the forest was another defensive lookout for the elves.",
            "[[Orgoth's Tower]]": "This abandoned tower was the home and death place of a powerful wizard named [[Orgoth|Orgoth the Tainted]], who was said to have been slain by three [[fiend]]s he summoned."
