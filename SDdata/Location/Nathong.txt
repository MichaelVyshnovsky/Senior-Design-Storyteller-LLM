}}'''Nathong''' was the mysterious capital city of the [[Yikarian Empire]] in northeast [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

==Geography==
Found high in the peaks of the daunting [[World Pillar Mountains]], Nathong was nestled safely near the central core of the [[Land of the Yak-Men]] within the [[Gate of Heaven]] province.

==Description==
As with other cities within the Empire, Nathong appeared to be a single gargantuan building spread atop a plateau high above the clouds. Some said it was large enough to be a mountain itself.

==Inhabitants==
The [[Emperor of the Lotus Throne]], along with his [[Lotus Court]], ruled the Empire from his capital.

In addition to a large number of slaves of various races, Nathong sported the highest concentrated population of [[yikarian]]s found anywhere on [[Toril]] at 7,000 inhabitants.

A corps of 900 elite [[Faceless Guard]]s guarded the only access point to the capital.

==Activities==
Nathong was the political and religious center of the Yikarian Empire. The will of the [[Faceless God]] was carried out here through his Lotus Emperor.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Tower of the Faceless God]]
