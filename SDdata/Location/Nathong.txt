Nathong was the mysterious capital city of the Yikarian Empire in northeast Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Found high in the peaks of the daunting World Pillar Mountains, Nathong was nestled safely near the central core of the Land of the Yak-Men within the Gate of Heaven province.
As with other cities within the Empire, Nathong appeared to be a single gargantuan building spread atop a plateau high above the clouds. Some said it was large enough to be a mountain itself.
The Emperor of the Lotus Throne, along with his Lotus Court, ruled the Empire from his capital.
In addition to a large number of slaves of various races, Nathong sported the highest concentrated population of yikarians found anywhere on Toril at 7,000 inhabitants.
A corps of 900 elite Faceless Guards guarded the only access point to the capital.
Nathong was the political and religious center of the Yikarian Empire. The will of the Faceless God was carried out here through his Lotus Emperor.
