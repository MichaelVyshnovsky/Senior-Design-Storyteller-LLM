'''Gambiton''' was a small village in southern [[Amn]].

==Description==
The tiny village was home to two businesses of note that faced each other across the intersection. The [[Gambitavern]] was its tavern, and the [[Gambitinn]] was the inn.

==Geography==
The village lay at the intersection of the [[Imnescourse Trail]] and the [[South Road (Amn)|South Road]], a few miles south of the [[King's Arch]] bridge across the [[River Esmel]] that led to [[Esmeltaran]]. To the east near [[Lake Esmel]] was the [[Five Silvers]], a ring of ancient [[standing stone]]s.

==History==
Gambiton gained its name from "Imnel's Gambit," as it was the site where Prince [[Imnel Torlath I]] divided his forces in two during the [[Ogre Wars]] in the {{YearlinkName|479}}. The nearby [[Vale of the Wailing Women]] was named for the lamentations as his soldiers marched away, and [[Imnescar]] was named for the eventual battle that he won after splitting his army.

The village was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, in the opening of the [[Sothillisian War]]. An army of [[Skullgnasher]] [[hill giant]]s and [[Spearbiter]] [[goblin]]s poured from the [[Small Teeth]] and quickly overran the nearby [[Hillfort Ishla]], and then razed Gambiton the following day on [[Eleasis 8]] on the way to Esmeltaran. The surviving population fled to the west and north.
