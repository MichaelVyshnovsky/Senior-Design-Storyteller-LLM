This lifeless island was used as a marker to show the northern end of Asavirâ€™s Channel. Its only notable feature is one of the Sea Towers was built on the cliff face of the north shore, 150 feet above the sea. Magical light emanates from the tower preventing ships from crashing into the islands or the Dragons Head Peninsula. 
No one willingly approaches the island as it is said that the Curse of Irphong will find those that do. Whenever a pirate puts down anchor here or even approaches the shoals around it, the ship is cursed to sink within a tenday.
