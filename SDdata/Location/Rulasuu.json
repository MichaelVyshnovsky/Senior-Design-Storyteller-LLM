        "mainbody": "Rulasuu was an island and naval base located off the coast of southwest Halruaa.\nThe island of Rulasuu served as one of two major bases for Halruaas navy. It housed normal sailing vessels as well as magical skyships.\nA formal city or town did not exist on the island, so the sailors often took their shore leave in the nearby city of Khaerbaal, making it quite rowdy at times."
