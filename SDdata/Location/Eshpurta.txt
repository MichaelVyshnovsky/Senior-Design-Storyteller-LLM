'''Eshpurta''', the "Shield City" of Amn, was a bustling military trade town in eastern [[Amn]].This sudden drop in population is unexplained and is likely a [[Wikipedia:Retroactive continuity|retcon]]. Given that Eshpurta was far from the Sothillisian War and apparently did not come under attack, even if the entire military sector left the city and never returned the population would still be at least twice this number. which downgraded the once-thriving metropolis to a large city.

==Geography==
Eshpurta was located at the confluence of [[Trifin Creek]] and the [[River Rimril]] where they merged to later join the [[Amstel River]], which eventually flowed into [[Lake Esmel]] in the heart of [[Amn]].{{Amstel sources}} Eshpurta was south of the [[Snakewood]], south and west of the [[Troll Mountains]], north of [[Trollford]], and far to the east of [[Keczulla]] along the [[Eshpurta Road]].

==Government==
This fortified city had a strong military tradition and was governed by a council of six, called the [[Shield Council of Eshpurta|Shield Council]], whose members were the leaders of the local merchant families and clans. The unelected "advisor" of the Shield Council was General [[Labak Craumerdaun]] who held the position mainly by force of personality. The fact he also had troops garrisoned in the city certainly didn't hurt his standing, and the council members usually listened to his advice and even curried his favor. were:
* Lord [[Marcos Craumerdaun]]
* Lord [[Mikaal Dannihyr]]
* Lady [[Jazzomyn Gheldieg]]
* Lord [[Tanis Keltronn]]
* Lord [[Jharvex Krimmevol]]
* Lord [[Bhaem Shumokh]]
* General [[Labak Craumerdaun]] (advisor)
* [[Heralds of Faerûn|Herald]] Swanmantle, [[Ard Roton]] (advisor)

==Trade==
Eshpurta was known as the "Shield City" because it had more troops stationed there than anywhere else in Amn. The business of the city largely revolved around the military with hundreds of blacksmiths, weaponsmiths, armorers, leatherworkers, stablekeepers, etc. which occupied the northern and western quadrants of the city. Large mining operations pulled iron and nickel out of the [[Troll Mountains]] to feed the smelters and ultimately produce the trappings of martial might. The eastern portion of the city was almost exclusively dedicated to the mining and related industries. The chief exports of Eshpurta were arms, armor, military equipment and training, mercenaries, and iron ore. Less lucrative but important for civic pride, the southern ward of the city was home to sculptors, artisans, and musicians.

==Defenses==
[[Image:EshpurtaCityLayout.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Eshpurta city layout]]
The city was naturally defended by creeks or rivers on three sides, as well as walls fortified with towers around the entire city proper. Three large gates connected the city to the major roads and the countryside. The southwest gate led to a crossing of the swiftly rushing Trifin creek and the Eshpurta Road that ran westward to [[Keczulla]]. Just up from this road was the [[Golden Fortress]], overlooking the confluence of the creek and the river. The gate in the south-southeast opened on a crossing of the River Rimril and connected to the [[South Road (Amn)|South Road]] to Trollford. The north gate led to the settled countryside and eventually the Snakewood.

===Troops===
Before the Sythillisian War, Eshpurta had a garrison of the [[Council of Six|Amnian Council]] Army 25,000 strong. This included 18,000 troops, 6,300 officers, and about 700 support personnel such as weapon and armor smiths, instructors, logistics managers, cooks, etc. In addition, the Golden Fortress housed some 3,000 trainees and the city was policed by the Shield Militia of 1,400&ndash;2,000 mounted officers, which was under the direction of the Shield Council.

==History==
In the [[491 DR|Year of Faltering Fires, 491 DR]], [[Kadar el Aktorral]], an ambitious [[Calishite]] noble, led a group of immigrants from [[Tethyr]] and Calimshan to the lands east of [[Lake Esmel]] and founded the Duchy of [[Cortryn]] in what was formerly the [[halfling]] realm of [[Meiritin]] and the [[Shoon]] territory of [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]]. Eshpurta was established as a fishing village and was the northernmost city in Cortyrn. The Duchy of Cortryn lasted until the [[731 DR|Year of Visions, 731 DR]] when a [[beholder]] cult called the [[Ring of Eyes]] wiped out the ruling house and captured Cortryn. The Ring was eventually defeated and in the [[760 DR|Year of Drifting Stars, 760 DR]], Amn conquered the Duchy and added it to its territory.

==Rumors and Legends==
* Eshpurta was one of the few cities that contained a ''gate'' to [[Swordsmere]], the secret subterranean lake surrounding [[Herald's Hall]].

* The [[Shadow Thieves]] were thought to control or operate some gambling establishments and festhalls, and run a payday loan business that appealed to some soldiers. All rogue activity was kept inconspicuous by necessity due to the heavy military presence in the city. If any misconduct was blatant enough to be noticed at the top of the chain of command, the General was not above turning the tables and having a siege weapon misfire and accidentally hit these shady businesses.
