        "Structure": "[[File:Menzoberranzan.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Map of Menzoberranzan (one square = 200 yards).'']]\nMenzoberranzan was located in a huge arrowhead-shaped cavern, some two miles wide and a thousand feet high. The drow called the cavern, [[Araurilcaurak]]. The city was mainly carved from calcite and it was filled with blue, green, and violet faerie fire. Buildings were often covered with the city's main motif: the spider, in honor of Lolth. An enchantment in the city cavern reduced echos from all the noise.\n\nThere were a fixed number of buildings in Menzoberrazan, meaning that the poorer areas were extremely crowded. Noble houses, once destroyed or abandoned, were not permitted to be reoccupied, meaning that there were a number of abandoned compounds both on the surface and roof of the city cavern.\n\n[[File:Gromph Baenre by francis001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Narbondel and [[Gromph Baenre]], the Archmage of Menzoberranzan]]\nThe city had around a hundred gates, all guarded. These gates led into the myriad tunnels surrounding the city (collectively called the ''[[Bauthwaf]]'').\n\nOne of the most distinct structures in the city was the pillar-clock called [[Narbondel]]. It was enchanted each morning by the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]] with a glow that slowly dissipated as the day wore on. Narbondel could be seen from throughout the entire city. When the pillar was completely dark, it was called ''Narbondel's Black Death'' (effectively midnight).",
        "History": {
            "Founding": "[[Menzoberra]] the Kinless, a powerful priestess of Lolth, founded the city that bears her name in {{Yearlink|-3917}}. By the wishes of Lady Lolth, she led seven drow families into the [[Northdark]] from the city of [[Golothaer]], one of the southerly drow holdings of [[Great Bhaerynden]]. Their goal was to escape from the constant warring between factions who venerated Lolth and those that worshiped [[Ghaunadaur]]. Lolth aided them on their journey directly via dream-sendings, but only when it seemed like all hope was lost. After battling several of the Underdark's natives, including a conflict with a clan of [[dwarves]] to whom they lost half their number, they slew a [[beholder]] in {{Yearlink|-3917}} that claimed a huge natural cave as its lair. The surviving drow took up residence in this cave, naming it after their leader.<ref>\n\nThe original seven drow families, having no immediate external enemy, fell to attacking and undermining one another——exactly what they had hoped to escape—to the greater glory of their evil goddess, who loved chaos. Only fifty years after the city's founding, in {{Yearlink|-3864}}, a great and terrible battle between the two most powerful Houses, [[House Nasadra]] and [[House Thaeyalla]], occurred. This battle led to the collapse of a cavern wall that destroyed four houses and killed Menzoberra. The perpetrators, House Nasadra, were attacked by [[House S'sril]] and House Baenre chose to side with them against Nasadra. House Nasadra were banished from the cave on the orders of Lolth, who ordered them to establish a second city in her name (which would come, a few decades later, to be called [[Ched Nasad]], and House Nasadra was still the First House there until the city's destruction) and for the two cities to maintain an amicable relationship. [[House Baenre]] then rose as the First House of Menzoberranzan.",
            "13th and 14th centuries DR": "In the 13th and 14th centuries DR, this pattern seemed to have accelerated. [[House Do'Urden]] ascended from the Tenth House to the Ninth House by destroying the Fourth House, [[House DeVir]] in [[1297 DR]]. However [[House Hun'ett]] took in the last DeVir survivor, an act which prompted a cold war between the two houses lasting decades. Finally in [[1327 DR]] House Hun'ett attacked House Do'Urden with the latter narrowly winning due to the much-needed aid of [[Jarlaxle]]'s mercenary band [[Bregan D'aerthe]].\n\n[[File:Zaknafein - Todd Lockwood.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Zaknafein Do'Urden as a zin-carla.'']]\nHouse Do'Urden lost the favor of Lolth due to the rebellion of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], for the last time, when Matron [[Malice Do'Urden]] failed to kill Drizzt with [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]] after transforming him into a [[zin-carla]]. This resulted in House Baenre utterly destroying House Do'Urden in the {{YearlinkName|1339}}.<ref>\n\nIn [[1359 DR]], during the [[Time of Troubles]], [[House Oblodra]], the Third House, aspired to become the First House of Menzoberranzan. Menzoberranzan was caught in a [[dead-magic zone]], so magic did not work there. House Oblodra, however, was gifted in the rare art of [[psionics]] and seized upon this opportunity to strike at the other Houses. The matron of House Oblodra nearly reached her goal, but an avatar of Lolth answered Matron Baenre's pleas for help and came to Menzoberranzan after the Time of Troubles had ended. Although she loved chaos, she did not wish to see a House that did not whisper prayer to her to rule the city. Foreseeing her temporary loss of power due to the Time of Troubles, Lolth had asked the demon [[Errtu]] to protect her worshipers, should she herself fail to do it. She opened a portal for Errtu and his host of demons to lay siege to House Oblodra.\n\nBy the time the Time of Troubles had passed, Lolth was restored to full power and single-handedly crushed House Oblodra, the remains of their stronghold being pushed into a deep chasm known as the [[Clawrift]], and Matron Oblodra's spirit went to Errtu for eternal torment. Thus the ranks of the ruling Houses changed once again. All this she said was done for her greatest high priestess (although it was really done for herself), the two thousand-year-old Matron [[Yvonnel Baenre]]. All Houses in the city witnessed this great miracle and knew that House Baenre was the most favored House of the goddess.\n\nIn celebration, the city marched upon [[Mithral Hall]] in [[1358 DR]], viciously attacking the dwarfhold in what would be known as the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]]. The drow lost the battle and the retreat was sounded after Matron Baenre herself was felled by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]]'s axe. In addition, many of the city's slaves had been used as fodder, leading to a dearth of agriculture. Upon the army's return, the city had been badly weakened and its leadership was in chaos.\n\nYvonnel's eldest daughter Triel took her mother's place as leader of the city but faced many hardships during her time in power. Despite an early victory against [[Blingdenstone]] in [[1371 DR]], the constant infighting between the noble houses resulted in a rapid depopulation of the drow citizens of the city. Lolth herself expressed her displeasure and imposed a forced [[Peace of Lolth]] in [[1361 DR]] among the city's populace until Menzoberranzan's numbers had been restored.",
            "Silence of Lolth": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, not long after the peace was lifted, the [[Silence of Lolth]] began when Lolth stopped answering her priestesses' calls and granting them spells. A number of disillusioned drow males, [[drider]]s, and slaves banded together under the rule of the [[alhoon|illithilich]] [[Syrzan]] in an attempt to weaken and take over the city. However, the plot was unraveled by [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] and [[Ryld Argith]], who had been investigating the missing males, but not before the slave revolt began on [[Marpenoth 20]] The masters of [[Sorcere]] were able to cast a ritual spell to summon lightning and rain that ended the revolt.\n\nAlmost immediately thereafter, a [[duergar]] army led by King [[Horgar Steelshadow]] of [[Gracklstugh]] and helped by [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] marched to attack the city. The most powerful houses mustered the [[Army of the Black Spider]] to meet the opposing army at the [[Pillars of Woe]], where the duergar were joined by the traitorous contingent of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] and the [[Scoured Legion]] of [[Kaanyr Vhok]]. The Army of the Black Spider was soundly defeated and forced to escape back to the city. Menzoberranzan was then besieged by the invading army on [[Uktar]] 15, [[1372 DR]]. The [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]] was costly but when the Silence of Lolth ended several months later, Menzoberranzan's defenders turned the tide of the battle and drew victory from defeat. The [[Scoured Legion]] left the city on [[Ches]] 30, [[1373 DR]].\n\n[[File:Quenthel Baenre - Insurrection.jpg|thumb|150px|''Quenthel Baenre before she became First Matron Mother.'']]\nMenzoberranzan returned to form quickly. [[Quenthel Baenre]] killed her older sister Triel, taking her place as leader of House Baenre.",
            "Demon Hordes": "From the year [[1485 DR]], [[Quenthel Baenre]], under the influence of her mother [[Yvonnel Baenre]]'s memories, brought demons into the city to distract the lesser houses from plotting against [[House Baenre]].<ref> In the chaos, drow battled demons to survive in the city streets, while the gates of each noble house closed their doors to the outside to protect themselves.<ref>\n\nFrom the year [[1486 DR]], Lolth manipulated the Menzoberranzan archmage Gromph Baenre into inadvertently summoning her rival [[Demogorgon]], the Prince of Demons, into the city. On its arrival, Demogorgon destroyed the ceiling of the archmage's chambers at Sorcere while others were left maddened in its path of devastation through the city. were channeled into a ''[[kinetic barrier]]'' created by an [[illithid]] hive mind onto [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. Drizzt leaped onto and struck Demogorgon's chest, releasing the immense collective power generated by the drow city that destroyed demon prince.<ref>",
            "Civil War": "An open civil war was triggered after [[Yvonnel Baenre II|Yvonnel II]] and Quenthel Baenre reversed the curse of abomination on eight hundred [[drider]]s<ref> who'd been gifted to [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]] by Lolth's handmaidens.<ref> For the drow, it was considered impossible and a blasphemy to cure the driders without the will of Lolth aiding the ritual.<ref> Quenthel Baenre invited the former driders to join House Baenre, which was also seen as a blasphemous act. She also declared the laws of Lolth a lie to the ruling council.\n\nThe war was fought between Houses loyal to Lolth and those who remained allied to House Baenre. The following is a breakdown of the factions involved during the war. [[The Blaspheme]] was an army of resurrected drow based in House Baenre. This led them to turn against the Eilistraeean reinforcements at their gate. The [[Menzoberranzan/Braeryn|Braeryn]] district was attacked by demons summoned by [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]] and was unable to join either side.<ref> [[Bregan D'aerthe]] arrived with rumors in Braeryn that they would side with House Baenre.<ref> [[Braelin Janquay]] of Bregan D'aerthe was accused of killing a [[House Hunzrin]] noble.<ref> They set up a base in the [[Oozing Myconid]]<ref> Co-leader [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]]'s body was destroyed in [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] on a rescue mission to save Braelin Janquay.<ref> [[House Fey-Branche]] was allied with House Baenre but were taken captive<ref> and destroyed<ref> by House Barrison Del'Armgo. [[Byrtyn Fey|Matron Byrtyn Fey]] was turned into a drider by Matron [[Mez'Barris Armgo]]. [[House Hunzrin]] was attacked and captured by House Baenre who later had guards at the compound.<ref> House Barrison Del'Armgo assaulted the compound in an attempt to free it from House Baenre.<ref> House Barrison Del'Armgo sided with House Melarn, but Mez'Barris Armgo was killed in a fight with Bregan D'aerthe by the possessed [[Malagdorl Armgo]].<ref> House Melarn's Matron [[Zhindia Melarn]] became the second avatar of Lolth during the war.<ref> She and her house were destroyed when Gromph Baenre returned to the city<ref> and detonated his staff, causing a large explosion<ref> that banished Lolth and her handmaidens for a hundred years.<ref> \n\nIn the wars aftermath, [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Sos'Umptu Baenre]] negotiated a truce where approximately 2000 heretical drow refugees<ref> were allowed to leave the city on the condition they could not return. Sos'Umptu also agreed to show mercy to the drow that remained. Sos'Umptu hinted that Bregan D'aerthe could return if they found any mutual benefits for her in the future. Sos'Umptu became the new ruling matron mother of the city.<ref>"
        },
        "Inhabitants": "In [[1370 DR]], there were approximately 20,000 drow in the city, with 1,000 of them considered nobles of the 60-70 noble houses. Slaves included [[bugbear]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[ogrillon]]s, [[orc]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[quaggoth]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[kobold]]s. According to [[Liriel Baenre]] in [[1361 DR]], human slaves were rare in Menzoberranzan, but not unheard of.\n\nIn [[1372]], the city had 32,000 inhabitants — approximately one-third [[drow]] and the rest humanoid slaves, namely [[orc]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[human]]s, and the occasional [[illithid]]. \n\n''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the city was back to 20,000 drow.\n\nAs many as 1,200 visitors might have been in the city at one time, including [[beholder]]s, [[deep dragon]]s, [[illithid]]s, [[naga]], and [[fiend]]s.",
        "Trade": "Independent traders and merchantile companies were an important part of drow society. They were run mostly by male drow, though a few merchants, such as [[Xalyth|\"Nal\" Xalyth]], contradicted this standard. The trade was a dangerous one, even more so for non-drow, and many died quickly due to \"accidents\" from Houses that disliked them or from rival traders. Some were sponsored by noble Houses, ensuring their survival in some cases.\n\nThe city exported poisons, mushrooms, [[riding lizard]]s, spell scrolls, [[wine]], and water (clean water could be hard to come by in the Underdark).\n\nThe city imported produce (surface and Underdark), shellfish, slaves, and textiles.\n\nThe neighboring drow city of [[Ched Nasad]] provided fully half of Menzoberranzan's goods.\n\nVarious currencies were accepted in Menzoberranzan. Coins came in many shapes, including round, square, triangular, ring and spider-shaped coins. The greatest dozen houses in Menzoberrzan minted the coins. For example, House Baenre minted their own coins with the Baenre emblem, which were accepted throughout the city.",
        "Government": "[[File:Driftdisc.JPG|thumb|left|250px|''Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre.'']]\nThe city had many different factions, or Houses, all of which vied for power. As it was a matriarchal society, however, only females truly held power. Officially, the city was under the rule of the Ruling Council of Eight, composed of the eight [[matron mother]]s of the first (and most powerful) eight houses.\n\nAlthough drow culture was matriarchal, a few male drow in the city held some political power, including [[Gromph Baenre]], the archmage of the city, and [[Jarlaxle]], leader of the mercenary band [[Bregan D'aerthe]], which was often utilized by House Baenre.",

        "Culture": {
            "Religion": "The worship of [[Lolth]] was prevalent, and the worship of any other deity was forbidden. However, there were a number of secret (mainly male) worshipers of [[Vhaeraun]].",
            "The Academy": "The [[Tier Breche|Academy]] of Menzoberranzan was located in [[Tier Breche]] and was composed of three schools: [[Arach-Tinilith]], the clerical school; [[Sorcere]], the wizards' school; and [[Melee-Magthere]], the warriors' school.",
            "Food and drink": "Local food was primarily produced in and around [[Lake Donigarten]]. The [[Isle of Rothe]] in the lake housed the city's [[rothe]] herds, managed by [[House Hunzrin]], which provided rothe [[cheese]] and meat to the city. The area in and around Donigarten also housed moss fields, giant mushrooms, fungus farms, fish, and orc and goblin slaves.\n\n''[[Pyrimo]]'', a type of aggressive fish similar to piranhas, was prized, despite being deadly if not prepared in the correct manner.\n\nCheap street food in Menzoberranzan included sausage and rolls, which could be bought from street vendors in the [[Braeryn]] slum, and pickled sausage. Finer foods included rothe steak, raw mushrooms with creamy dipping sauces, wine, and a salad of black, red, and white fungus.\n\nAlcoholic beverages found in Menzoberranzan included green ''[[ulaver]]'' wine and a type of sweet dessert wine. There was also [[lace fungus]] brandy and some drow favored [[duergar]] brandy.",
            "Entertainment": "Entertainment was perhaps not the most obvious word connected with Menzoberranzan, but the city nevertheless provided recreation and relaxation (as much as possible) to its (drow) inhabitants. Taverns were plentiful and brothels could be found if one looked hard enough. The Bazaar offered food, shopping, street performers, and even a game tent or two. \"Houses of delights,\" massage parlors, and public bath houses, all of which were usually manned by slaves, offered their services.\n\nWell-to-do drow, particularly nobles who were not busy plotting to overthrow their rivals or guarding against usurpers of their positions, were fond of wild parties and dances.\n\n[[Sava]] was a popular [[Chess (game)|chess]]-like game that represented war between noble houses. It was often played in taverns.\n\nAnother notable past time in Menzoberranzan was the plotting and carrying out of pranks.",
            "Customs": "Because the drow worshiped Lolth, the Spider Queen, killing spiders (even unintentionally) was punishable by death by the law of Lolth.\n\nBy law, parties had to end at start of new day (the ''Black Death of Narbondel'', or midnight). so dances, particularly the frenzied ''nedeira'', were usually performed sans clothing.\n\nDeath (usually by intrigue) was widespread in Menzoberranzan. The dead were usually placed in airtight stone crypts in the solid rock north of the city cavern so that they could later be reanimated as battle fodder. Only priestesses were cremated to prevent such a thing occurring to their corpses.\n\n\"Rock, knife, and parchment\" was game in Menzoberranzan after the manner of \"rock, paper, scissors.\""

            "Dark Dominion|The Dark Dominion": "All of the tunnels within an 8km (5 mile) radius of the city were known as the Dark Dominion; the nearest ones leading to the city were known as the ''Bauthwaf'' (meaning \"around cloak\") Drow patrols were a constant presence of the region. They searched for banned creatures, monsters and surface elves and challenged them once spotted. A few guard outposts could also be found in these tunnels. At least ten of the tunnels that started here led to the surface. One that led straight past [[Blingdenstone]] and into [[Mithral Hall]] and one that led to the [[High Forest]] were the two most commonly used. The Dark Dominion was full of dangerous magical radiation known as ''[[Faerzress]]''.",
            "Dead Dragon Gorge": "About six days' travel on foot from Menzoberranzan was a large ''[[faerzress]]''-free cavern. Most people who wanted to teleport to the city aimed for this cave and a few keyed two-way portals could be found here, along with a waterfall that provided free fresh water. Several noble houses had permanent [[scrying]] sensors here though they made pains to seem like they didn't care about the place.<ref>",
            "Zz'Pzora's Lair": "A cave with magical crystals only accessible via a river. Home to the deep dragon [[Zz'Pzora]] until her death in [[1361 DR]]. It was a ''[[Faerzress]]'' location."
