        "mainbody": "Reddansyr () was a small settlement found in the Dragon Coast region of central Faer√ªn. It had a well-earned reputation as an adventurers town because it was a good source of information for such people.\nThe town was located at the junction between the Grand Ride and the Traders Road, along the route that connected Westgate within the cities of Teziir and Starmantle.\nReddansyr served as a launching point for caravans heading south from the region.\nIn the early 14 century DR, hatchings of the black dragon Aglistralarraghautha destroyed much of the farmlands around Reddansyr.\n* Giants Folly, a successful and popular festhall that was built out of a boat that had been up-ended and repurposed as a tavern.\n* Temple of Oghma, a holy house run by Thyrius Jorman whose clergy resented the free flow of information available from the local festhall, as they preferred to gather and hoard useful information for themselves.\n* Ornlaugh Turghle, a doppelganger who posed as a merchant in the late 14 century DR."
