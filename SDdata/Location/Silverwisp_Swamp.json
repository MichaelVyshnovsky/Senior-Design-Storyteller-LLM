        "mainbody": "The '''Silverwisp swamp''' was a fetid patch of wetlands found in the [[Sword Coast North]] region of [[the North]].",
        "Description": "The Silverwisp swamp was densely forested with coniferous trees with interspaced bogs found within. Rough dirt trails wound through the wetlands, at times becoming submerged in its dark-colored waters.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The swamp housed numerous barrow mounds of the [[Uthgardt]] barbarians. Some of their most prolific and deadly warriors were interred within. \n\nWithin the vast swamp were two notable landmarks, the Maridain Mire and the Valley of the Ancients.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "In addition to the undead that ran rampant during the late 15{{th}} century, Silverwisp swamp was home to many large [[spider]]s, such as [[deathjump spider]]s.\n\n[[Selûne's Tear]] flowers were known to grow throughout the swamp."
        },
        "History": "At some point during the mid–to–late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[undead]] poured out from the graves and crypts of [[Ebon Downs]], and overwhelmed the [[Grimhollow|local village]]. In response, Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] of [[Neverwinter]] dispatched the [[Neverwinter Guard]] clergy members of the [[church of Kelemvor]] directed by [[Doomguide]] [[Vesper Soulhearth]] to keep them from completely overrunning the region. The undead were in fact being raised by an ancient [[Netherese]] [[necromancer]] named [[Idris]], armed with a powerful artifact known as the ''[[Deathknell]]''. Neverwinter's forces were no match for the [[arcanist]] and her undead, and were all but entirely destroyed.\n\nContact was made with Soulhearth and his surviving allies in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. Together with the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], Soulhearth and an [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer ally]] were able to put to rest the [[ghosts]] that remained tethered the ruined village, slew the [[wight]]s, [[zombie]]s, and other undead that infested the swamp, and defeated the undead Idris and his lieutenants.\n\nSome time later in the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} the restored [[Cult of the Dragon]] began excavations in locales throughout Silverwisp swamp. They sought the grave of the ancient [[barbarian]] warrior [[Belast Messandar]], in the hopes to gain more information about a ''[[portal]]'' that led to the isle of [[Tuern]]. Their efforts were thwarted by Acolyte [[Heiron]] and Preceptor [[Theraclast]] of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], and the same hero that helped slay Idris some years before.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Ebon Downs]], the vast burial grounds from which the swamps' undead scourge originated.\n* [[Grimhollow]], a small village that suffered a terrible fate.\n* [[Royal Rise]], the massive, unholy fortress of the [[lich]]-like wizardess Idris.\n* [[Temple of Kelemvor (Silverwisp Swamp)|Temple of Kelemvor]], a holy fortification founded by the God of the Dead's clergy in Neverwinter.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Galwyn Grist]], the ghost that once served as the mayor of Grimhollow.\n* [[Vartilingorix]], a black dragon ally of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], that was slain within the Valley of the Ancients."
