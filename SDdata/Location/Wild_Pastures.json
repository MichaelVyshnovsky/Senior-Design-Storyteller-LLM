            "Flora & Fauna": "The pastures were often filled with [[cow]]s, [[oxen]], mostly [[human]] shepherd and their loyal shepherd [[dog]]s. The wild lands were dangerous due to [[bear]]s, [[wolves]], [[worg]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, [[troll]]s of [[Trollbark Forest]], and an occasional [[roc]] attacking cattle. However, the most dire danger to travelers came in the form of [[cow chip]]s, spread around like [[mine]]s and traps in a nobleman's vault.\n\nSome unknown massive beast once died in the Wild Pastures, leaving behind only its giant skull that laid by the pasture's pond."

Desperate for help, the folk of Liam's Hold sent [[Hevesar Dimpet]] to ask the guard of [[Daggerford]] for help. Unable to find it, Hevesar asked an adventurer for aid, the hero who later would become known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. Following an investigation, the Hero witnessed strange giggling and a cow disappearing right in the middle of the daylight. Following tracks mysterious perpetrates left behind, the Hero descended into a cave, discovering a tribe of cowardly goblins who used a magical brew to turn cattle invisible and leading them to be slaughtered and consumed. The goblins served [[orc]]ish and [[tanarukk]]a hordes of [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]] who was assembling forces to attack Daggerford. The cow thievery was not approved by the tanarukka and their leaders as the goblin greed and stupidity led to the locals hiring adventurers to investigate and endangered the weapon supply for the demon army. The tanarukka were ordered to slaughter half the goblins as a lesson.",
