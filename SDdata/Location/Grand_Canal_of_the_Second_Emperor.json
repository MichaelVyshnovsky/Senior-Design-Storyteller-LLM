        "mainbody": "The Grand Canal of the Second Emperor was  a huge canal in Shou Lung that ran across the Shou provinces of Wang Kuo and Hungtse.\nIt resembled a long river. The Kaifeng highway ran parallel to it.\nShips went back and forth along the length of the canal.\nIn 1369 DR, the Cormyrean engineer Ivar Devorast visited this canal in Shou Lung. He had been tasked by the city-state of Innarlith to construct a smaller canal to connect the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow. Ran Ai Yu, a Shou merchant who frequented Faer√ªn had brought him there aboard her ship and believed that he would learn something from it before he headed back to Innarlith."
