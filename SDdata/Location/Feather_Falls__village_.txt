'''Feather Falls''' was the formerly largest settlement in [[Featherdale]], though by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] it was second to [[Blackfeather Bridge (village)|Blackfeather Bridge]]. It was located at the base of the [[Feather Falls (waterfall)|waterfall]] after which it was named. The village served as the primary dock for boats that navigated down the [[River Ashaba]].
