The Royal Docks of Port Nyanzaru in Chult were an enclosed section of the citys Harbor Ward that contained docks reserved for the exclusive use of the citys merchant princes or their honored guests.
The Royal Docks were only used by the merchant princes or those whom they wished to impress, generally meaning foreign dignitaries, ambassadors, or other powerful merchants.
The name "Royal Docks" was derived from a time when Chult had been ruled by literal kings and queens as opposed to Merchant Princes.
The Royal Docks were located at one end of the harbor, separated from the public docks by the drydocks and Warehouse District.While the map of Port Nyzanzaru provided with the Tomb of Annihilation adventure places the Royal Docks on the western end of the Harbor Ward, they are described in the text as being on the eastern end.
