'''Duar's Retiring Room''' was a room in [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|1479}}, during the aftermath of the massacre during the [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the [[undead]] [[Highknight]] [[Targrael]] borrowed an [[enchanted]] [[gemstone]] from Duar's Retiring Room, which she believed would be eventually spotted. This implied the room was patrolled with some regularity.
