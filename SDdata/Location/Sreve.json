        "History": "At some point prior to {{yearlink|797}}, [[Radellus]] came to Sreve to take [[Justal Iroon]]'s tower, and after a fierce battle, he prevailed. Radellus was later defeated by Kurtal, who froze some of the rubble falling from the tower in time to serve as a warning to the villagers.\n\nSreve was destroyed during [[Kurtal]]'s tenure as the [[Magister]], due to the number of duels with his challengers that took the fighting there. The town had been reduced to nothing by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
