        "mainbody": "Sreve was a village of shepherds and root-farmers in the 9 and 10 century DR. It was the native village of the Magister Kurtal.\nKurtal had a mill, a main street, and a ridge to the east where a mages tower, originally belonging to Justal Iroon, stood. The mill had a millpond.\nFish lived in the millpond. The villagers were mostly shepherders and root-farmers.\nAt some point prior to , Radellus came to Sreve to take Justal Iroons tower, and after a fierce battle, he prevailed. Radellus was later defeated by Kurtal, who froze some of the rubble falling from the tower in time to serve as a warning to the villagers.\nSreve was destroyed during Kurtals tenure as the Magister, due to the number of duels with his challengers that took the fighting there. The town had been reduced to nothing by the late 14 century DR.\nThe tower of Justal Iroon was close to Sreve, and so was Kurtals abode.\n*Kurtal\n*Radellus\n*Justal Iroon"
