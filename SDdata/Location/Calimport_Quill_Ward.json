        "mainbody": "'''Quill Ward''' was one of the seven central wards of the city of [[Calimport]], the center of much of the city's administrative activities, and a gathering place for sages, scholars, and scribes.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />",
        "Description": "Quill Ward had the largest concentration of libraries in Calimport. Most of these were not public but were private collections, but there were a few notable exceptions. Because of all the studious activity, it was one of the quietest areas of the city. Its inns and boarding homes were peaceful places to stay.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />\n[[File:Quill Ward location.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''A map of the city of [[Calimport]], with Quill Ward highlighted in red.'']]\nQuill Ward was located north of [[Calimport/Wizard Ward|Wizard Ward]],<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 /><ref name=Calimport-p29> and it also bordered [[Calimpor/Grand Ward|Grand Ward]] on the west, [[Calimport/Khanduq Ward|Khanduq Ward]] and [[Calimport/Hammer Ward|Hammer Ward]] on the north, and [[Calimport/Crypt Ward|Crypt Ward]] on the east. A tiny stretch of its Hikaya Drudach bordered [[Calimport/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] in the southwest.<ref name=Calimport-p29 />",
        "Government": "The ruler of the ward was [[Sultan]] [[Abbas el Quaahl|Abbas yn Akkabar el Quaahl]], who was also a [[vizar]] to [[Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]], having followed him to Calimport from [[Manshaka]] during the latter's rise to power. A ruthlessly evil man, many feared him as much as the syl-pasha.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />\n\nAbbas' son [[Malik el Quaahl|Malik]] ran most of the administrative operations of the ward. While he ran the ward honestly, he was an exceptionally gifted forger, and used his skills to frame his enemies.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />",
        "Defenses": "This district of the city had a special defense unique to it. It was surrounded by a powerful magical ward that granted several powerful effects. First, it was impossible for fire to grow larger here than that found in a typical fireplace. Second, the light from any candle shone twice as bright as a normal candle would. Third, it was impossible to catch a disease when within the ward, (though catching a disease outside the ward and entering it meant that one would still suffer the effects of the illness.) Lastly, [[paper]] and [[parchment]] never aged when within Quill Ward, meaning that the pages books and documents felt always supple and new. Only the first effect was commonly known.<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />",
        "History": "It was a [[wizard]]ess from [[El Namor]] family who protected Quill Ward. [[Nureh el Namor|Nureh yr Catahra el Namor]], known as the Emerald Enchantress, created the powerful defensive magic in the {{YearlinkName|693}} as a way of protecting her own private library, the [[Emerald Archives]].<ref name=Calimport-pp55-57 />",
