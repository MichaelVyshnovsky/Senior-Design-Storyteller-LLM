        "mainbody": "Cutlass Island was an island that sat in the mouth of the River Mirar in the city of Luskan. It was notable as the headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood.\nCutlass comprised two rocky hills&mdashone on the northern side and the other on the southern side&mdashconnected by a pebble beach. The northern rise was the site of the Host Tower of the Arcane while the southern height was the site of the Sea Tower.\nCutlass Island was the largest of the five islands in Luskan (the others being Blood Island, Closeguard Island, Fang Island, and Harbor Arm Island). It sat west of Closeguard, to which it was connected via the Sword Bridge.\nAccessing the island on foot required first crossing the Dark Arch bridge from Luskans South Bank onto Closeguard Island before then crossing Sword Bridge. Only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or of Ship Kurth were permitted onto Closeguard Island, and furthermore, the Dark Arch was protected via a ward which alerted the Brotherhood when it was crossed by anyone not affiliated with them while Sword Bridge contained a ward that allowed the Brotherhood to summon battle horrors for defense.\nThe Host Tower was raised on Cutlass island in the , and would eventually become the headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood circa . As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the island had its own docks.\nIn the , when Deudermont led an effort to unseat the Arcane Brotherhoods grip on Luskan, High Captain Kurth elected to support Deudermont, allowing his troops to cross Closeguard Island and attack Cutlass Island by land. Cutlass Island would end up being devastated by a giant explosion that all but destroyed the Host Tower. In the aftermath, Kurth became the de facto ruler of both Closeguard and Cutlass, however Cutlass Island came to be abandoned after this. In the decades following the Spellplague of the , the island came to be infested with undead. While most folk stayed away, adventurers were inevitably drawn to the island by tales of the bygone Arcane Brotherhood and promises of powerful magic still hidden there.\nFollowing the Second Sundering, it was once again home to the Arcane Brotherhood after the Host Tower was raised anew. At this time, the Arcane Brotherhood shared with northern hill with Ship Kurth, who maintained stables on the island.\nIn the , a horde of demons, gnolls, goblins, ogres, and pirates managed to cross Closeguard Island and assail Cutlass Island as part of House Margasters invasion of Luskan. They were turned back largely by the spells of Gromph Baenre.\n* The Host Tower of the Arcane, the headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood.\n* The Sea Tower, Luskans oldest pirate stronghold. It came to be used to house lesser members of the Arcane Brotherhood during the mid-to-late 14 century DR."
