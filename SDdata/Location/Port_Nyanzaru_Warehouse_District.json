        "mainbody": "The '''Warehouse District''' of [[Port Nyanzaru]] was a section of the city's [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]] where goods being shipped into or out of the city were stored.",
        "Description": "The district was characterized by its canals that separated the rows of warehouses. Full-size merchant ships could be towed through these canals by [[dinosaur]]s, allowing for the vessels to be brought straight to the sites where their cargo was to be loaded or unloaded. Because traffic jams were a notable concern with this arrangement, organizing this towing operation was one of the key responsibilities of Port Nyzanzaru's harbormaster.",
        "Geography": "The Warehouse District was located in central Port Nyanzaru, east of the drydocks and west of the public docks.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the harbormaster in charge of traffic management in the Warehouse District was [[Zindar]]."
