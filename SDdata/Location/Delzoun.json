        "mainbody": "elzoun, also known as the Northkingdom, was a great dwarven nation of the North during the Age of the Proud People, reigning over the north for almost 4,000 years, from  to .\nAt the height of their influence and strength, the kingdom extended from the Ice Mountains south to the River Rauvin and Nether Mountains.\nThe name survives as a middle name among modern day dwarves, one bearing much prestige.\nThe Dirge of Delzoun was an epic dwarven ballad that recounted tales of the kingdoms mightiest heroes and greatest treasures.\nLike their kin from Ammarindar to the south in the Greypeak Mountains, the dwarves of Delzoun were masterful smiths and stone masons.\nMuch of the Delzoun wealth was gained by trading with the Netherese humans, though they were also known trading allies of the elven realms of Illefarn and Eaerlann. They notably created the Fardrimm, a series of underground roads spanning the breadth of their empire and beyond into other areas of the North. The most famous of these underground roads was the Lowroad, which linked the Delzoun lands with Netheril. Dwarves of Delzoun would often trade gems, ironworks and weapons for gold and arcane secrets from the magocratic empire.\nLandmarks\n*Fardrimm\n*Lowroad\nSettlements\n*Ascore This bustling port city, found on the shores of the Narrow Sea, prospered during the years when Delzoun trafficked goods to and from ancient Netheril.\n*Citadel Adbar The heroically resolute fortress survived for centuries after the fall of Delzoun, and joined the nation of Luruar for some time, before closing their borders to outsiders in the late 15 century DR.\n*Citadel Felbarr The capital fortress of Delzoun endured the orc invasions that claimed the realms of the Northdark,\n*Citadel Sundbarr Built over the great volcanic chasm known as the everfire, this dwarfhold survived Delzouns collapse by virtue of the colossal defenses forged from the primeval flame. It would go on to serve as the embodiment of the unity shared between the dwarves and heart humans of the North. \n*Ghaurins Hold This millennia-old stone keep manor was the ancestral home of the Stoneheart clan, and served as a monument to their storied history.\nThe kingdom was founded by a dwarf of the same name.\nThe dwarves completed construction of Citadel Felbarr in .\nThe Illuskan Maerin commissioned a number of Delzoun artisans, including Immar Fardelver, to construct Gauntlgrym in .\nCitadel Sundbarr and Ascalhorn accepted human refugees from the recently fallen Netheril in . In the same year, the dwarves began to slowly abandon Ascore.\nIn the Year of Terrible Anger, -111 DR, the Delzoun fell prey to the same orc assaults that devastated other kingdoms of the North, though the kingdom endured for few more years. Finally, in , Delzoun fell to the phaerimms and other dangers. Surface settlements including Citadel Adbar, Citadel Felbarr, Mithral Hall, and Sundabar survived the fall but the underground settlements of the Northdark were not so fortunate."
