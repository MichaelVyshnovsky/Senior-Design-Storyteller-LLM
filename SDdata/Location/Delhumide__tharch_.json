        "mainbody": "'''Delhumide''' was a tharch of [[Thay]], located in the eastern part of the nation. It encompassed the eastern seas of [[Lake Thalembrar]], along with the lands east of the [[River Thay]] to the northeastern cliffs of the [[Second Escarpment]]. Up until the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was full of slave farms that were either exploited or well used by its various [[tharchion]]s throughout the years.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Delhumide]]: The former seat of power in Thay during the age of the [[Mulhorand]]i empire, the city of Delhumide became a ruin, whose ancient wealth and secrets attracted treasure seekers from within Thay and beyond.",
        "Geographical Features": "*[[Lake Thaylembrar]]\n*[[River Thay]]",
        "History": "During the first half of the 14{{th}} century, Tharchion [[Mikal Canos]] largely ignored rule over his lands, using slave revolts and political scheming as a cover for his expeditions into the ruins of the tharch's capital. When Canos went missing during one such excursion in [[1363 DR]], [[Invarri Metron]] ascended as Delhumide's tharchion and took over administration of the tharch's slave trade.\n\nIn preparation for his attempted political coup of Thay in the year [[1375 DR]], [[Zulkir]] [[Szass Tam]] had his [[Red Wizard]] [[necromancer]]s traffic in a great number of slaves through the tharch, and into an ancient temple of [[Horus-Re]] within its ruined capital. Within the temple was a ''[[portal]]'' that led to an [[undead]] manufactory run by the [[atropal]] known as [[Xingax]], who had been raising an army of [[zombie]]s, [[wraith]]s, and other abominations for the Thayan [[lich]]. Szass Tam maintained control over the tharch for the next decade, while the [[War of the Zulkirs]] ravaged the nation, until it was unified under his rule as regent in [[1385 DR]]."
