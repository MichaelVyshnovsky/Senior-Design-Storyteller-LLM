        "mainbody": "The Assikhath was a huge cavern-lair located under Thaymount.\nThe cavern was guarded by several powerful statues, some of which could cast protective magic while others animated to defend the place against intruders. Most of those statues had snake heads and represented stylized Sarrukhs.\nThe Assikhath was created by the Baetith as a place to hold the Athora.\nDue to the statues guarding the cave, most Thayan considered snake-headed statues as a symbol of power and success in magic. Consequently such statues were a common sight in Thayan homes and enclaves, and were thought to bring good luck."
