        "mainbody": "'''Maztapan Island''' was a large island that rose up from the water immediately east of the [[Gulf of Kultaka]] and later claimed as territory of the [[Borderlands]] and its capital, [[New Waterdeep]].",
        "Geography": "Maztapan Island was a dry island located at the southwestern end of the [[Gulf of Cordell]] in [[Maztica]]. The island was just off the coast of the Maztican nation of [[Kultaka]]. With the fall of [[Nexal]] and colonization, Maztapan was claimed by New Waterdeep, and it neighbored the territories of [[New Amn]].",
        "History": "[[File:New Amn 2e.png|thumb|''Territories of the Maztican colonies.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, in the days that preceded the [[Night of Wailing]], an [[Amn]]ian vessel called ''[[Helm's Choice]]'', under the command of Captain [[Quintara]], traveled past the strait between Maztapan and the mainland. The ship was ambushed by a curious [[giant squid]], who thought the boat to be a new and exciting edible prey that had wandered into its territory. The sea beast was scared off, but ''Helm's Choice'' sustained damage and was forced to land.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, twelve trade ships from [[Waterdeep]] were denied docking at the New Amnian colony of [[Helmsport]] because of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six's]] newly imposed restrictions on transoceanic trade. The ships sailed further west until they had their first landfall on the island of Maztapan. Soon after, the Waterdhavian ships crossed the Gulf of Kultaka and established the colony of the New Waterdeep, naming the claimed territory as the Borderlands. Eventually, Maztapan Island became a mooring site for New Waterdeep.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the first settlement of the New Waterdeep was attacked and razed to the ground by [[Kultaka]]n raiders. Survivors of the attack fled to [[Trythosford]] and eventually rebuilt New Waterdeep on Maztapan Island by [[Eleint 4]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}."
