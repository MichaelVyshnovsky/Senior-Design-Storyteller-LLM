Wyrmheart Mine was a highly productive dwarven mine in the Kobold Mountains, renowned in Chult for its vast collection of diamonds and emeralds.
The clan leader, Kyer Wyrmheart, was an old and hateful dwarf. He guarded the mine entrance with several kinds of ballistae, and kept pet dimetrodons who would feast upon any would-be raiders. He was presumably killed when the mine was taken by the red dragon Tzindelor.
