'''Wyrmheart Mine''' was a highly productive [[Dwarf|dwarven]] mine in the [[Kobold Mountains]], renowned in [[Chult]] for its vast collection of diamonds and emeralds.<ref name=TJoC-p27 />

The clan leader, [[Kyer Wyrmheart]], was an old and hateful dwarf. He guarded the mine entrance with several kinds of [[ballista]]e, and kept pet [[dimetrodon]]s who would feast upon any would-be raiders.<ref name=TJoC-p27 /> He was presumably killed when the mine was taken by the [[red dragon]] [[Tzindelor]].
