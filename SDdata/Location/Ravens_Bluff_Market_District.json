        "mainbody": "he Market District of Ravens Bluff was a small ward in the center of the city full of old warehouses and converted row-houses, which during the late 1300s DR, was inhabited by a motley group of vendors, merchants and performers. The market had an interesting reputation among Ravenians it was the district that never slept, a place where someone could procure all sorts of items and creatures found throughout Faer√ªn,\nA shopper could find all sorts of curios within the market, ranging from live beasts that could serve as a familiar to books of lurid tales published in nearby Sembia. The \"skilled\" people of the district offered their share of services as well. Anyone who so required could find a skilled forger to have a near-exact copy of a desired item, be it cherished family heirloom or near-priceless ceramic vase.\nThe markets of Ravens Bluff were a rundown collection of decaying brick structures, crammed together with vacant city homes that had been repurposed by vendors who came from a tented shanty town outside the city proper. It was the only location of the Bluff that had been vandalized by graffiti and litter the accumulation of thick stacks of assorted flyers, notices and playbills found stuck to doors or walls was not uncommon.\nThese unpleasant sights were somewhat overshadowed by the performers that would show off for gawking Ravenians. Jugglers, acrobats and palm-readers, who may or may-not have practiced actual divination, would gather crowds in at night while their associates hawked wares from the multitude of stalls.\nAt night, the district was nearly always alight from the glow of oil and candle lamps sitting in the glass-less windows of its dilapidated buildings.\nBusinesses\n*House of Cloevaerus By means of a number of Sembian contacts, the importer Cloevaerus was able to being a fair amount of clockwork curious and Gond-inspired machinations into Ravens Bluff.\n*Mad Dolphin House Nearly as large as a warehouse found in the docks, this large-item pawnshop had a small eatery where customers could relaxed while they gaze over wares that may catch their attention.\n*Nodder & Sons Safe Storage This stone building offered secure storage in the form enclosed lock-boxes that could be rented in the short, or long, term. \nLandmarks\n*Belltower This abandoned stone tower was believed to have once been the temple of an old Ravenaar cult.\n*Purtils tower The citys water tower was built with unique, aerial-conveyances in mind and could accommodate the landing of a griffon or even a Halruaan skyship .\nResidences\n*Beldrids house This building was home to a local shipping investor who was known to hire adventurers in the city to travel out and hunt down pirates."
