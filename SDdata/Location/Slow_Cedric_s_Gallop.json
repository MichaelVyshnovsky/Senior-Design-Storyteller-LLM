The town was discovered buried under the snow tides of the Spine of the World the following spring as the first of the brave travelers started moving along the Southern Pass. The only evidence of Slow Cedrics Gallops existence was its tall belltower, almost completely buried under the snow, apart from just its steeple. Inside, travelers found blood-stained floor, several dead frozen orc corpses, and the enchanted heavy flail called the Black Chimes."
