Its people made their living primarily as weavers.\nMost of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka, built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\nAs a whole, the people of Zuke were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula, but their shoya had no interested in interacting with visitors.\nThe hamlet had a population of about 350 individuals after .\nZuke was located inland on the eastern side of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima, near the northern tip of the Momoben Forest.\nVillages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya, typically a minor samurai, and Zuke was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed.\nLike the other tiny settlements of the region, Zuke had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The settlements major industry was weaving.\nThe cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 4 fen. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 4 yuan to sell.\nAbout 35 citizens of Zuke served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears.\nLike most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Zuke were followers of the Path of Enlightenment. Unlike the other settlements, however, they did not demand a test of faith from strangers and were more welcoming of those of other faiths.\n* Husijo, a pawn shop owner.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
