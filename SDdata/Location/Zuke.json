        "mainbody": "'''Zuke''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. Its people made their living primarily as weavers.",
        "Description": "Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\n\nAs a whole, the people of Zuke were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula, but their [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']] had no interested in interacting with visitors.\n\nThe hamlet had a population of about 350 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.",
        "Geography": "Zuke was located inland on the eastern side of the Fochu Peninsula of [[Tsukishima]], near the northern tip of the [[Momoben Forest]].",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a ''shoya'', typically a minor [[samurai]], and Zuke was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed.",
        "Trade": "Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Zuke had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The settlement's major industry was weaving.\n\nThe cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 4 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 4 [[yuan]] to sell.",
        "Defenses": "About 35 citizens of Zuke served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.",
        "Religion": "Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Zuke were followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]]. Unlike the other settlements, however, they did not demand a test of faith from strangers and were more welcoming of those of other faiths.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Husijo]], a pawn shop owner.",
        "History": "Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
