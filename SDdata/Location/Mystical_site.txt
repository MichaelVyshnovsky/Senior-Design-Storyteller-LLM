A '''mystical site''' was a type of magical location found in the [[Utter East]]. Sacred shrines were erected on them where [[basal golem]]s could be transformed into higher-level creatures.{{Cite document

==Foundation==
A mystical site was marked by a "foundation", a ground base whereon the shrine would be constructed. It was depicted as a pale-brown stone slab, with a central hexagonal area marked by an obelisk and four wings for the basal golems to stand on. There were only a handful of foundations to be found at specific locations in a given tract of land.

==Construction==
When four basal golems stood upon the foundation, they could be together transformed (permanently) into one type of shrine.

==Shrines==
The sacred shrines were dedicated to the gods [[Chauntea]], [[Lathander]], [[Mystra]], [[Myrkul]], or [[Tempus]]. In exchange for this reverence, other basal golems who visited the shrine could be transformed (via metapods) into a variety of creatures associated with each god.

Shrines were often either square, round, or round with four protruding entrances fitting the shape of the foundation, though their design varied greatly according to their god and land and culture they were built in. However, each bore the [[holy symbol]] of the god on them.

===Arbor Lodge===

The Arbor Lodge was described as a primal sanctum of the goddess of nature, Chauntea. As a mystical site, it conducted power from nature. It was used to transform basal golems into creatures of the wild, namely druids, rangers, griffins, and nymphs. It bore the rose of Chauntea's holy symbol inside a sun. In the kingdom of [[Doegan]], it took the form of a round building, while in [[Edenvale]] it was a wooden house surmounted with antlers, and in the constructed [[Hall of Wonder (Utter East)|Hall of Wonder]] it was a round stone building.

===Barracks===
The Barracks was a martial hall in the service of the god of war, Tempus. As a mystical site, it drew its power from conflict. It was used to transform basal golems into hardened warriors, rangers, and paladins. It bore the flaming sword and shield symbol of Tempus, or sometimes three parallel swords in opposing directions. In Doegan, it took the form of a round training yard.

===Crypt===
The Crypt was a grim tomb dedicated to the god of the dead, Myrkul. As a mystical site, it conducted power from the "nether world". It was used to transform basal golems into creatures of evil aspect, like zombies, ghouls, wraiths, and gargoyles. It bore the skull and arch unholy symbol of Myrkul. In Doegan, it took the form of a square stone crypt.

===Runestone===
The Runestone was an arcane monument that honored the goddess of magic, Mystra. As a mystical site, it conducted arcane power. Producing beings of strong magical essence, it was used to transform basal golems into wizards, gnomes, stone golems, and wyrms. It bore the holy symbol of Mystra, the image of mist descending from a ring of eight stars. In Doegan, this was a weird eldritch structure.

===Temple===
The Temple was itself a temple to the god of renewal and virtue, Lathander. As a mystical site, it conducted virtuous power and turned basal golem acolytes into clerics, paladins, and furies. It bore an image of a sunrise atop the wavy disc holy symbol of Lathander. In Doegan, it was a round temple with four entrances.

==Philosophy==
Whatever gods the sacred shrines were dedicated to, adherents of the [[Great Mage (Bloodforge)|Great Mage]] saw all the mystical sites as temples of battle. Their followers, the basal golems, erected them to honor the gods.
