The '''Vale of the Wailing Women''' was a valley in the [[Small Teeth]] mountains of southern [[Amn]].

==Geography==
The valley cut through the Small Teeth between the [[South Road (Amn)|South Road]] and the [[Tethir Road]]. To the northwest was [[Lost Xandar]] and [[Kossuth's Eyes]], and to the east was [[Hillfort Ishla]] and [[Arellaxerrontoal's lair]]. The southern end of the Vale held the [[Black Spires of the Maiden]], a great temple of [[Loviatar]].

==History==
The Vale was named for the women of Amn who watched their husbands march to war under Prince [[Imnel Torlath I]] during the [[Ogre Wars]]  in the {{YearlinkName|479}}.
