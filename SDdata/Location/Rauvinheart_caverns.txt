The '''Rauvinheart caverns''' were an immense system of caverns and tunnels underneath the [[Rauvin Mountains]] in [[Luruar]]. 

==Geography==
The Rauvinheart caverns were located underneath [[Dead Orc Pass]] and the mountains on either side of the pass.

==Description==
The caverns were heated by a geothermic source. The [[River Rauvin]] passed through the caverns and emerged at the southern mouth of Dead Orc Pass in a waterfall-filled area known as [[Rainbow Gorge]]. The caverns were home to creatures of the [[Underdark]] and fungi that served as food sources for the [[orc]]s that dwelt in the Rauvins.
