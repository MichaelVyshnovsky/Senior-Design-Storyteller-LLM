        "mainbody": "Ilthan was an island in the Pirate Isles in the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThere were several harbors on the island, mainly situated along the southern edge. There were no major settlements, as the storms that occurred during the winter were so severe they tended to destroy most buildings.\nThe most prominent feature of Ilthan was a city, built of stone and fallen into ruin, that stood in the center of the island,Pirates of the Fallen Stars places the city in \"the northern highlands\", but the later source, Sea of Fallen Stars, says it was in the center. forming its highest peak, and was built for creatures much larger than humans and cyclopskin.\nCyclopskin claimed the northern edge of Ilthan, herding sheep and goats, but lived on the southern shore inside of high cliff caverns. Some were known to keep minotaur lizards as both pets and guard animals.\nPirates tended to live in small communities on the southern edge of the island, departing to Dragonisle whenever the winter season came. They largely left the cyclopskin alone, considering the dearth of adequate harbors on Ilthans northern shore not worth the trouble.\nAccording to legend, whoever once lived in Ilthans ruined stone city had dominated the Sea of Fallen Stars, but were destroyed by vengeful gods.\nRumors said that the cyclopskin who inhabited the island were lorded over by a small band of ettins."
