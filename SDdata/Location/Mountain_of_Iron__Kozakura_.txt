The '''Mountain of Iron''' was a mountain located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
The Mountain of Iron was located in [[Miyama Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. It was once a significant source of low-quality [[iron]] ore. While mining efforts were generally unprofitable because of the scarcity of accessible ore, this particular area harbored substantial deposits close to the surface, resulting in extensive mining activities.

After the mines were abandoned, some of these shafts were extended deeper than the original miners ever reached. A mysterious, unknown force appeared to be gradually expanding these shafts, spreading like a vast net under the [[Kurisammyaku]] mountain range. Reports of sinister beings lurking in the vicinity of these old shafts surfaced. In response to these unsettling sightings, the shugo-daimyo ordered troops to construct a watchtower overlooking the Mountain of Iron, as a precautionary measure to monitor the area's activities closely.

==History==
Around {{yearlinkConvert|1280|KY}}, the ore veins gradually depleted, leading to the abandonment of the mines and the decline of the mining communities. By {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, all that remained were the decaying ruins of their homes and the collapsing mine shafts.
