The '''Qurth Forest''' was located along the southern coast of the [[Lake of Steam]] and just west of the city of [[Derlusk]].<ref>{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms/Introduction}}

Various towns and ruins bordered the forest with the [[Barony of the Great Oak]] on the southwest side. The [[River Scelptar]] flowed southwest from its source in the Qurth Forest into the [[Inner Sea]].

After the [[Spellplague]], the land was slowly turning into a desert, and the forest was a tiny remnant of its former self.<ref>

===Flora & Fauna===
The Qurth forest was home to various creatures, among which [[korred]],{{Cite polyhedron/116/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms: Blackbarn and Bloutar}} [[myconid]]s, [[owlbear]]s, [[ettercap]]s and [[giant slug]]s. Regular animals could be found as well, such as [[spider]]s, wild [[boar]]s, and a plentiful population of [[stag]]s.

==Notable Locations==
* Deep into the woods were two lost cities, one of which was believed to be [[Hawklyn]].
* An old, overgrown, abandoned keep was roamed by giant slugs. Some said it was [[Starth Keep]], home of a family family of gem-cutters.

==Rumors & Legends==
A rumor whispered among the [[Borderer]]s pretended that [[Bloutarran]]s trapped the trails and allowed some monsters such as [[deepspawn]]s to flourish, causing them to disgorge countless stags in the woods.
