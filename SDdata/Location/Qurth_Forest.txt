The Qurth Forest was located along the southern coast of the Lake of Steam and just west of the city of Derlusk.
Various towns and ruins bordered the forest with the Barony of the Great Oak on the southwest side. The River Scelptar flowed southwest from its source in the Qurth Forest into the Inner Sea.
After the Spellplague, the land was slowly turning into a desert, and the forest was a tiny remnant of its former self.
The Qurth forest was home to various creatures, among which korred, myconids, owlbears, ettercaps and giant slugs. Regular animals could be found as well, such as spiders, wild boars, and a plentiful population of stags.
* Deep into the woods were two lost cities, one of which was believed to be Hawklyn.
* An old, overgrown, abandoned keep was roamed by giant slugs. Some said it was Starth Keep, home of a family family of gem-cutters.
A rumor whispered among the Borderers pretended that Bloutarrans trapped the trails and allowed some monsters such as deepspawns to flourish, causing them to disgorge countless stags in the woods.
