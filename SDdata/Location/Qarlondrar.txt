'''Qarlondrar''' ({{Pronounce|KAR|lawn|drar|refs=}}) was a realm of [[dwarves]] in [[east Faerûn]]. It was home to the [[Qarshield]], [[Murrend]], and [[Tulsark]] clans.

==Geography==
The underground realm lay beneath the [[Godswatch Mountains]] near eastern [[Semphar]].

==Society==
The realm was made up of the Qarshield [[gold dwarves]], Murrend [[gray dwarves]], and Tulsark [[shield dwarves]] clans, who lived and worked together harmoniously. The Murrend dwarves had a particular disdain for the term "[[duergar]]" and did not identity themselves as such.

The folk of Qarlondrar enjoyed a famed and luxurious standard of living, thanks to trade, excellent metalworking products, and the ingenious labor-saving mechanical devices that they designed and built.

==Relations==
Qarlondrar had good relations with the surface, and considered themselves to be wisely partaking and adopting the best aspects of surface culture. [[Magic]]al items, [[wizard]]s, and [[adventurer]]s from the surface found use in Qarlondrar when necessary, including the efficient and swift repulsion of several [[illithid]] invasions and preparation for suspected hostilities by [[drow]].

==Trade==
Large deposits of [[iron]] were mined by the efficient techniques of Qarlondrar, then worked into excellent [[weapon]]s, [[armor]], tools, and [[mechanical]] devices for home use and export abroad. The mining led to the creation of new underground spaces that were then structurally reinforced and planted with [[fungus]] farms that fed the community.
