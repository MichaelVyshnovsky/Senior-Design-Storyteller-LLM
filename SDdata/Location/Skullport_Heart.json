        "mainbody": "he Heart was one of the four wards of the subterranean city of Skullport. It was located in the easternmost portion of Skullports main cavern. It was the highest-class area in Skullport and housed the bulk of Skullports population.\nThe Heart consisted of three levels Upper Heart, Central Heart, and Lower Heart. The Heart was home to most of Skullports permanent residents and held some businesses. The Heart had a less finished look compared to the rest of Skullport and was marked by stone columns and stalactites. Duergar, illithids, drow, and beholders preferred to live in the Heart for its resemblance to a natural cave, its shadowy recesses, and the darkness of its upper areas.\nBy 1492 DR, the Xanathar controlled Skullport and turned the city into a haven for its criminal organization. Under its rule, most local businesses were shut down, with the few remaining in business paying it protection money. Skullports only remaining inn, Guts and Garters, and restaurant, the Worms Gullet, were located in the Heart.\nLower Heart was paved with cobblestones and large slabs of stone. Most of the buildings were in better shape than the rest of Skullport.

Businesses rising from Lower Heart up to Central Heart catered to illithids and to a lesser extent beholders.\n*Rumblecleft Pass A fissure opened along the south wall of Lower Heart by a series of earthquakes. It connected to a system of narrow natural tunnels leading to the River Sargauth and other locations in Underdark.\n*Steamfall Pass A pass covered with a cloud of superheated ash and steam from Thaglars Foundry.
