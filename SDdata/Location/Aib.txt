'''Aib''' was a small town found within [[interior Zakhara]].

==Geography==
Aib sat along the western banks of the North Quarter of [[Suq Bay]]. It was nestled in the foothills of the eastern end of the [[Spine of the Dog]] due south of [[Hiyal]]. A pair of intermittent rivers provided Aib with a source of fresh water at different times of the year.
