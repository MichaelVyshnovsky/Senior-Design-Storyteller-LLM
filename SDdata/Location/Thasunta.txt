'''Thasunta''', also known as the '''City of Warriors''' or the '''City of Berserkers''', was a bustling settlement in [[Rashemen]] that served as the home to many of its famous [[Rashemaar berserkers]].

==Geography==
The city's position at the juncture between the two major roads passing through Rashemen made it an ideal location to mobilize military forces. It lay at the intersection of the [[Golden Way]] and the road that ran north to [[Mulptan]].

==Government==
Thasunta was not directly governed by the [[Iron Lord]] directly, but rather by the most venerated of Rashemen's berserker lodges, the [[Old Lodge]]. This select order took its members only from amongst the nation's wisest and most battle-hardened warriors.

==Trade==
During many months of the year Thasunta was not much more than a stopping place for farmers and merchants to sell their wares while traveling along [[Golden Way]].

==Defenses==
Despite its seemingly mundane nature, Thasunta actually housed over hundreds of berserkers that hailed from a dozen of the nation's major lodges. Throughout Rashemen's history, these berserkers defended their nation against invasion forces dispatched by the malevolent southern nation of [[Thay]].

==History==
The berserkers of Thasunta were vital to Rashemen's victory at the [[Battle of the Lake of Tears]] against the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}.

In the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, the forces of Thasunta underwent plans to invade the hills of the [[High Country (Rashemen)|High Country]] and drive out its population of [[monstrous humanoid]]s.

==Rumors & Legends==
Regardless of the typical dislike of cities by the Rashemaar, citizens of Thasunta were held in high-regard if for no other reason that they were all believed to be some manner of berserker warrior. While this was a mere exaggeration the residents of Thasunta did little to dissuade others of its belief.

==Notable Locations==
The city was home to the great ale-hall of the [[White Dragon lodge]], the largest one of its kind in all of Rashemen.
