Twilight Gate Farm was a turnip farm in Sembia.
Twilight Gate Farm was a ramshackle turnip farm. After seemingly being abandoned for a long time, the woods reclaimed the area, and a hunting lodge was erected. The farm also had a fishpond.
In the 14 century DR, Gormstadd purchased the allotment.
Aldamair Galashar was hired as a steward to oversee the area, though he used the lodge to stash stolen goods.
