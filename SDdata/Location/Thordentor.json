        "mainbody": "'''Thordentor''' was one of the largest islands by landmass in the [[Nelanther Isles]]. It was the southernmost major island in the chain and had many large bays suitable for landing ships. White sand beaches lined the entire coast. The inner island only grew low shrubs and bushes and there were virtually no trees growing on the large island.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The Nelanther pirates and most [[Tethyrian]]s superstitiously avoided this island. Each year, anywhere from 5&ndash;30 whales beached themselves and died on the eastern and southern shores of the island. Records of these beaching events went back as far as the end of the [[Shoon Empire]]. The island's beaches were often covered by the bleached bones of dead whales&mdash;for this reason, the dwarves of the region named the island \"Thordentor\", or \"hill of bones\".",
        "Notable Locations": "The only widely known inhabited settlement on the island was a Tethyrian outpost on the western bay. The outpost was built in the ruins of an old Shoon-era signal tower that overlooked the expanding naval dockyards. Approximately 50 Tethyrian naval guards were stationed here at any given time.\n\nA major stronghold of the [[Twisted Rune]] was present in the caverns below the island's surface. It was their magical experiments that caused the beaching of the whales each year. The Rune members would find uses for the dead creatures, animating some of the smaller whales as skeletal guardians to protect the undersea tunnel entrances."
