Castle Aris was the fortified estate of Lord Vorik Aris, a traitorous noble of Cormyr. It was located  north-west of Eagle Peak in the far western reaches of Cormyr, on the Tunlands plains beyond the Storm Horns.
It was linked to Wyvernwatch Castle via a permanent portal, which Lord Aris used to move treasure, troops, and himself around without the Crown noticing. The portal archway in Castle Aris had three red gems embedded in it, on the keystone and two pillar bases, with the removal of one deactivating the portal until it was replaced. Removing all three would violently destroy the portal and blast both ends of it with potentially lethal energy.
