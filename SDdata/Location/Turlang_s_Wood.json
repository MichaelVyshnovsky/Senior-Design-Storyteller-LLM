        "mainbody": "urlangs Wood, also known as the Woods of Turlang, was a thicket located amongst the northwestern grouping of trees in the High Forest. These woodlands were watched over by Turlang, and over 100 other treants.\nTurlangs Wood was part of the High Forest nearest to the Silver Marches.\nThe stretch of the woods along the eastern edge, about a quarter-mile (0.4 kilometers) in depth, were well kept and easily trod by wandering folk. Going further in, the forest became dense with wild overgrowth thickets of thorny bushes, brambles and oppressive vines.\nThe forest held a number of small pools that were typically dotted with lily pads.\nAfter destruction spread from Hellgate Keep, around the , the treants of the forest awoke, after nearly 100 years of slumber. Under the leadership of Turlang, the treants planted trees to replenish the losses the forest endured. They even sought to expand the treeline further west.\nThe woods were home to a wide variety of trees, both common and more rare. Some of those planted by Turlang were not native to the High Forest region at all. The forest was partially illuminated at night by species of glowing fungus.\nTurlangs Wood was home to the largest community of treants in all of Faer√ªn. While they were secretive, they often allowed rangers, druids and other forest allies within their forest home. Some of the other notable treants, beyond Turlang, included Quarreleaf, Arauven, Duthroan, Eldrath, Faelmeir, Houmril, and Raunthar.\nA powerful alaghi druid named Kurdin was known to be an ally of these woods."
