        "mainbody": "Minsor Vale was a fishing village on Lake Weng in Amn, built on the ruins of the former capital of Minsorran.\nMinsor Vale lay on the southwest shore of Lake Weng, near the south bank of the outflowing Alandor River. Sitting in the wide basin of Lake Weng in the shadow of the Cloud Peaks, it was part of the northern highlands of Amn at an altitude of . The closest major road was the Lake Way to the south atop a higher ridge that made up the southern rim of the basin, the nearest city was Crimmor, down the Alandor, while the closest small settlements were Ideepton, Edive, and Shatar, all on the shores of Lake Weng.\nMinsor Vale supported itself with fishing and the farming of root vegetables, with any surplus being sold on to travelers and nearby military sites such as Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl. The Alandor River was an ideal barge route that didnt freeze in winter, with light water traffic from Minsor Vale around Lake Weng and down to Crimmor and Athkatla.\nMinsor Vale was originally a Selûnite temple-town and the capital of the theocratic realm of Minsorran. Founded in 300 DR in the shadow of the Shoon Imperium, Minsorran was a gathering of the followers of Selûne, Shar, Lathander, and Mystra who lived in harmony and respected their collective pantheon.\nThe community suffered a schism in , when discontented Selûnites broke away and founded Myth Lharast hundreds of miles away in order to worship Selûne outside of Minsorrans pantheonic theocracy.\nThe cities of Minsorran were depopulated in 600 DR during a harsh midwinter blizzard when their people seemed to disappear without any apparent explanation. The culprit was actually the cunning white dragon Icehauptannarthanyx, who laired in Mount Speartop and successfully avoided being known of in the lands below. All four cities fell to ruin, with Minsor Vale eventually gaining a new population after several centuries, reaching a quarter of its former high. The new Minsor Vale was a much smaller settlement, and was surrounded by the ruins of the former capital.\nSelûnite pilgrims in the 14 century DR had a tendency to mistake Minsor Vale for long-lost Myth Lharast, ending their journeys there instead.\nThe main point of interest in Minsor Vale was the Maidens Baths, a public bath house with magical amenities and active shrine to Selûne. An abandoned seven-story temple to Selûne loomed over the center of the village."
