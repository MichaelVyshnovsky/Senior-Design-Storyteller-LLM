Fang Island was a small island that sat in the mouth of the River Mirar in the city of Luskan.
The island was uninhabited and craggy, and earned its name because its sharp rocks were known to tear apart any boat or barge that was swept downriver. It hosted a self-sustaining area of wild magic that would randomly discharge dangerous spells. Although rare, these magical bursts could illuminate a dark night in the city.
The island lay between Harbor Arm Island and the inhabited islands in the River Mirars mouth (Blood Island, Closeguard Island, and Cutlass Island).
The Arcane Brotherhood had plans to build on the barren Fang Island as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, and its wild magic zone was the result of a failed effort by them to create an extremely powerful ward there. They subsequently were unable to remove this phenomenon.
In the , the island was seized by Deudermont and Ship Kurth, and was used as part of a blockade of the river in their battle to drive Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood out of the city.
During the traumatic events of the Spellplague in the , the island was suffused with fire and light as it lifted into the air as an earthmote. It remained above the city for a century, occasionally spawning terrifying monsters or spilling acid rain.
Following the Second Sundering, it had returned to the river and was once again noted for its tendency to tear ships apart. It remained uninhabited.
