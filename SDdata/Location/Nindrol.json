        "mainbody": "'''Nindrol''' was an undersea kingdom of [[sea elves]] that occupied the waters around the island of [[Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting]] in the [[Sea of Swords]] ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].{{Cite dragon/267/The New Adventures of Volo: Onward!|83}}",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The kingdom contained forests, labyrinths, and warrens of [[coral]]. Some \"stacks\" rivaled the tallest towers and turrets of any castle on the mainland."
        },
        "Government": "Nindrol was ruled by a monarch. After King [[Elpaerae]] died, his wife, Queen [[Vaervenshalice]] held the throne as of 1370 DR. She and Elpaerae had six daughters, known collectively as the Princesses Paeraeroyal (in honor of their father).\n[[File:Nelanther-Toaridge.png|thumb|right|270px|''Map showing Toaridge as part of the Nelanthers'']]",
        "Life & Society": "The Nindrollen were relatively carefree and enjoyed teasing any merchant vessels or [[pirate]] ships that sailed over their territory. They were known to rescue shipwreck victims by dragging them to shore, along with any small boats, [[skiff]]s, or [[dinghy|dinghies]] that were capsized or sunk.\n\nThe Princesses Paeraeroyal had means to survive out of water for short periods of time and occasionally came on land when they grew bored with undersea life. The ballads ''[[She Walked Out on the Waves]]'' and ''[[My Lady of the Moonlight]]'' were testaments to their exploits posing as travelers on the coastal roads of the [[Western Heartlands]].\n\nAt some point before 1370 DR, a small group of Nindrollen families broke ties with Nindrol and formed their own realm of [[Ondroth]] in the caves along the undersea slopes of the [[Tethyr Peninsula]] (more commonly known as the Dragon's Head or Dragon's Neck Peninsula).",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Around 1370 DR, the notorious [[moon elf]] [[Elaith Craulnober]] of [[Waterdeep]] was rumored to be looking (that is, sending out his agents and lackeys) for one of the Princesses just south of the City of Splendors. It was believed that one of them caught his attention and then disappeared into the sea.\n\nAccording to the ballads, one of the Princesses Paeraeroyal went by or answered to the name [[Nanalethalee]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The aquatic elves of Nindrol typically had green skin and blue hair."
