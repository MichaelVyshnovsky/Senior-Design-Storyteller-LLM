        "Geography": "It stood in southern Tabot, north of the river and the forest and on the road between [[Darka]] and [[Han Chao]] and at the end of the road from [[Khampo]]. It lay south of the lake called [[Nam Tso]].{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}",
        "Relations": "The [[carp hengeyokai]] of Nam Tso were well regarded and protected by the people of Bidnop So, who knew them as the \"lake people\". The carps had rescued a few fishermen and a young girl, and sometimes visited the markets of Bidnop So to trade [[rice]] and [[opal]]s collected from the lake bed for things they couldn't manufacture.",
        "Notable Locations": "Bidnop So Bridge crossed the river, joining the roads to Khampo and Darka.",
        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, in response to a [[Phutan]]ese army assembling at the border, Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung (the military office) mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in Bidnop So, Darka, [[Thok]], and Khampo. Meanwhile, the dzong-pon (sheriff) of [[Thok]] called for a hunt on [[yeti]] after a raid on [[Nafeen Gompa]] and distributed [[Printing press|printed]] handbills as far as Bidnop So bridge calling for volunteers.<ref name=\"KT77\" >"
