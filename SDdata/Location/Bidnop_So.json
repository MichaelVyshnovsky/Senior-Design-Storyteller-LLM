        "mainbody": "Bidnop So was a city in Tabot.\nIt stood in southern Tabot, north of the river and the forest and on the road between Darka and Han Chao and at the end of the road from Khampo. It lay south of the lake called Nam Tso.\nThe carp hengeyokai of Nam Tso were well regarded and protected by the people of Bidnop So, who knew them as the \"lake people\". The carps had rescued a few fishermen and a young girl, and sometimes visited the markets of Bidnop So to trade rice and opals collected from the lake bed for things they couldnt manufacture.\nBidnop So Bridge crossed the river, joining the roads to Khampo and Darka.\nIn , in response to a Phutanese army assembling at the border, Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung (the military office) mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in Bidnop So, Darka, Thok, and Khampo. Meanwhile, the dzong-pon (sheriff) of Thok called for a hunt on yeti after a raid on Nafeen Gompa and distributed printed handbills as far as Bidnop So bridge calling for volunteers."
