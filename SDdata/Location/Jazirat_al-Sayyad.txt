'''Jazirat al-Sayyad''', or the '''Hunter''', was an elongated island located in the [[Nada al-Hazan]] achipelago within the [[Crowded Sea]].

==Geography==
Jazirat al-Sayyad had extremely rocky shores, marking it as dangerous sailing territory for mariners. Stormy swells and whirling waters threatened to shatter any approaching ship against the rocks.

==Inhabitants==
This island was the home of the magnificent Sayyad bloodline of [[horse]]s, making it a tempting destination for brave or greedy sailors. The herds were carefully watched over by [[herdsman genie]]s who were bound long ago by a powerful [[sha'ir]].

Buying a horse from the [[genie]]s often required an extraordinary payment and only buyers possessing admirable qualities were considered.
