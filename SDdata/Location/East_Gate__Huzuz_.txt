The East Gate was one of the entrances into Huzuz, the City of Delights in 1367 DR.
The East Gate was located on the eastern side of Huzuz at the juncture of the River Road and the South Road. The Caravan Boulevard, or Dihl al-Taif, exited Huzuz through this gate.
This gate was heavily used both by caravans bound for the Haunted Lands or those returning from them with goods.
