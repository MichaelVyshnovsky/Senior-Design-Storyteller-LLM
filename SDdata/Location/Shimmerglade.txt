The '''Shimmerglade''' was a rocky clearing located within a small copse of [[pine]] trees found on the banks of the [[Icehilt River]] in [[Impiltur]]. The rough basin within the forest marked the location of a famous battle between the Old Sage [[Elminster Aumar]] and a group of [[malaugrym]], and had since been [[magic]]ally warded by one of the former [[magister]]s of [[Mystra]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

==Description==
The Shimmerglade featured a wide, unnaturally formed crater, surrounded by a scattering of pine trees, many of which were stunted in their growth. The stony basin was the site of a large [[dead-magic zone]] that was surrounded by a series of wandering patches of [[wild magic]] energy, which appeared to shimmer and ripple through the air.

A few winters before the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], the "Reborn" [[Noum√©a Drathchuld]] placed an [[arcane]] warning over the site, comprising seven floating silver stars in the shape of a hook. When any intelligent creature appeared, it spoke in a firm but gentle tone:
{{Quote|"''Be wary of perils ahead and do not trust overly in the power of the Art"''}}
===Rumors===
Some [[sage]]s and experts of arcane lore believed the Shimmerglade held a cache of great magic stowed away by the malaugrym. It was rumored that the legendary ''[[artstave of Alithar]]'' of ancient [[Netheril]] was among the [[Item enchantment|magical]] items and [[artifact]]s stored within the hidden treasure trove. 

==History==
Many years before the [[Spellplague|second death of Mystra]], the shadowmaster [[Ultharos]] and a handful of their kin lured Elminster to the Shimmerglade in an attempt to murder him. The wise old mage defeated the malevolent shapeshifters in a grand display that forever altered the magical and natural landscape of the region.
