'''Mistshore''' was the name given to the dilapidated north shore of [[Waterdeep]]'s harbor in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
After the [[Spellplague]] of {{Yearlink|1385}}, Waterdeep went into a decline and maintenance of the harbor was neglected. Many ships sank or were scuttled in the northern harbor and eventually Waterdeep's outcasts created a small community on the wrecked ship hulls. The harbor water was polluted and smelled horribly.

In {{Yearlink|1491}}, Mistshore was largely destroyed in a massive fire, with most ships burning down to the waterline and having to be towed out of the harbor to prevent other vessels from running afoul the wreckage.<ref> By {{Yearlink|1492}}, most buildings in the neighborhood were still burned and abandoned.{{Waterdeep-time}}

==Description==
Mistshore was considered so dangerous that the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] refused to send patrols into the area.

==Notable Locations==
;Crib:
:This collection of partially sunken ships was the hideout of the crime lord [[Arowell]] prior to his death at the hands of [[Cerest Elenithil]]. The ships were arranged in a circle with suspended platforms in the center. Arowell sponsored [[gladiator]]ial contests to amuse the inhabitants of Mistshore.
;[[Dusk to Dawn]]
:This tavern was nothing more than a [[tent]] that moved to different locations in Mistshore nightly.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|15}}
;Hearthfire:
:The wretched inhabitants of Mistshore created a permanent firepit on which to cook.
;Waltzing Ferryman:
: Sea wraiths kept the inhabitants of Mistshore from approaching this old wreck. It was inhabited by an old [[spellscar]]red mage and his friend.

==Inhabitants==
The treasure hunter [[Grinda Garloth]] lived in a small residence in Mistshore. She often used her ''[[apparatus of Kwalish]]'' to search for treasure in [[Deepwater Harbor]].
