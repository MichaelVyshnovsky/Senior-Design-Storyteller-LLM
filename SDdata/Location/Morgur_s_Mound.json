        "mainbody": "orgurs Mound was the ancestor mound of the Thunderbeast tribe of the Uthgardt. It was located within the Crags, and was named for the brother of Uthgar.\nThe mound was roughly shaped like a creature known as a \"thunderbeast\" to the Uthgardt, described by some as a wingless dragon with a long neck. Prior to the late 15 century DR, the totem of the Thunderbeast tribe&mdasha skeleton of a long-dead thunderbeast&mdashsat atop the mound, In the late 15 century DR, this skeleton had disappeared, and was replaced by a row of massive bones protruding along the mounds back from the head to the tail.\nEnormous cairns encircled the mound out to a quarter mile , housing the bones of revered warriors of the Thunderbeast tribe.\nThroughout the Mounds history, superstitious members of the tribe often buried magic items within it, believing they would be watched over by the spirits of the dead.\nWhen the Thunderbeasts visited the mound for Runemeet in the late 15 century DR, they found that the mound had been dug up, and both the thunderbeast skeleton and the treasures within had been stolen.\nThe tribe stopped visiting the mound in the following years, which left it open to robbers and looters who claimed most of the hidden magical items buried there.\nMorgurs Mound was believed to be the burial site of Morgur, Uthgars mortal brother.\nRumors claimed that Thunderbeast shamans could animate the skeleton atop the mound whenever their tribe was in dire need of protection. Even after its disappearance, as many as four smaller dinosaur skeletons were said to lie in wait within the mound to defend its buried treasures."
