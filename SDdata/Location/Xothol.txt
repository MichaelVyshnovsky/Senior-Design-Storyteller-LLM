Xothol was a college of magic that served as an arcane workshop for the shield dwarf spellcasters of the kingdom of Ammarindar during the Age of the Proud People. It was established by King Azkuldar III as a means to protect the kingdom from the increasingly antagonistic Netherese Empire located on the surface of Faer√ªn to the east.
Within the college, Ammarindar wizards would research new spells and methods of spell preparation, with the particular focus of thwarting the Netherese arcanists.
Xothol was established in the year  at a time when the arcanists of Netheril began experimentation with the Shadow Weave. Once the Empire fell in , support for the arcane institution waned in the kingdom and it was finally shut down by King Tormalk in , and magically sealed until it was needed once again. The college remain unmolested during the fall of Ammarindar during the rampage of the demons from Ascalhorn in 882 DR, and well into the 14 century DR.
