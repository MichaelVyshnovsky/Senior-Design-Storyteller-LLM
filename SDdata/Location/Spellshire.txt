'''Spellshire''' was a minor county of [[Tethyr]] ruled by the famous [[wizard]] [[Gamalon Idogyr]].

==Geography==
County Spellshire was located north of the [[Sulduskoon River]]. It bordered the [[Forest of Tethir]] in the west, the country of [[Amn]] in the north, and County [[Valashar (county)|Valashar]] of the [[Golden Marches]] in the east. It was one of the [[Crown Lands]] and was composed primarily of small farming villages.

==Government==
The Court Sage of Tethyr, Count [[Gamalon Idogyr]], ruled over Spellshire in [[1370 DR]] from his home at [[Shildamere]].

==History==
Before the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]], the headship of Spellshire belonged to Gamalon's family, and this was restored to him after the civil war.

Spellshire suffered the same problems with an influx of monsters from the Forest of Tethir as did its southern neighbor, County [[Varyth]]. In addition, its northern border was under contention with Amn in 1370 DR, as the town of [[Trailstone]] had defected to join Tethyr.

==Notable Locations==
; Shildamere : The manor home of the count and countess.
; [[Seminary of St. Ostus]] : This school for general education also contained the largest [[wikipedia:en:Scriptorium|scriptorium]] outside of [[Candlekeep]] and [[Silverymoon]].
