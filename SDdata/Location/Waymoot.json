        "Description": "Waymoot was built on a five-mile man-made clearing in the King's Forest. The town was a mish-mash collection of buildings that sprung up around a wide stone-walled keep at the center of the clearing. The said keep – [[Lord Woodbrand's Keep]], was a small but tall structure that included a small prison attached to the outside as well as barracks and stables.\n\nWaymoot's coat of arms was an image of three simple upright triangles that symbolized [[pine]] [[tree]]s depicted standing side by side.",
        "Geography": "[[File:KingsForest.PNG|thumb|''A map showing Waymoot in the [[King's Forest]].''|435x435px]]\nThe biggest town in [[King's Forest]],",
        "Government": "The town's ruler held the title of the Lord. In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, the beloved [[Alatha Korduis]] was Dhag's Herald-in-training during the same time period.",
        "Trade": "Waymoot was a trade town that bred and trained [[horse]]s for private and army use, as well as built and repaired wagons. Due to its location and trade nature, the town had numerous inns.\n\nCommercial fishers and woodcutters in the towns of the King's Forest, including Waymoot, had to obtain a legal permit to operate.",
        "Defenses": "The town housed [[Purple Dragon]] troops that patrolled the roads, passing through every four hours, led by the High Constable of the King's Garrison who also recorded changed in Cormyr's adventuring charters.\n\nLord Woodbrand's Keep was defended by [[ballista]]e and [[catapult]]s placed atop its battlments.",
        "History": "Before Waymoot, the area was the site of a keep, long gone by the time the town began. Underneath it was a labyrinthine catacomb lair where a [[gold dragon]], in a [[human]] guise, once hid the hoard. Subsequently, the dragon was slain by a [[beholder]] that penetrated the lair from deeper underground caverns. Despite the fact that the catacombs had long collapsed by the 14{{th}} century, it was believed that the beholder still dwelt in the old dragon's lair underneath central Waymoot.\n\nWaymoot began its existence as a muddy [[troll]]-infested campground that grew in size as woodcutters created a clearing, eventually becoming a compound and, eventually, a trade center and horse farms around a fortified keep.\n\nFilfar \"Trollkiller\" Woodband in his youth, sometime in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century DR successfully defended Waymoot from an attacking horde of trolls virtually singlehandedly – the deed that gave him the \"Trollkiller\" moniker and later allowed him to be granted the title of the town's Lord.\n\nHistorically, Waymood was known for its rough edge and crime with a notorious [[thieves' guild]] along with other sinister organizations operating in Waymoot. However, by the mid-14{{th}} century DR, with the death of dark deity [[Bhaal]], the town's reputation was just that, a reputation of old, contrasted by the town's relative peace and calm.\n\nIn [[Flamerule]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[The Firemaster]], an infamous and mysterious [[wizard]] assembled mercenaries from [[Suzail]] and [[Westgate]] to try and plunder magic-filled ancient tombs north of Waymoot.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Waymoot, along with [[Espar]], [[Eveningstar]], and [[Tyrluk]], was plagued by rogue [[dragon]]s.",
