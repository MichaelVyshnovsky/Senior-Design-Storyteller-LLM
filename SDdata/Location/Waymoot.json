The town was a mish-mash collection of buildings that sprung up around a wide stone-walled keep at the center of the clearing. The said keep – Lord Woodbrands Keep, was a small but tall structure that included a small prison attached to the outside as well as barracks and stables.\nWaymoots coat of arms was an image of three simple upright triangles that symbolized pine trees depicted standing side by side.\nthumb|A map showing Waymoot in the 435x435px\nThe biggest town in Kings Forest,\nThe towns ruler held the title of the Lord.

Subsequently, the dragon was slain by a beholder that penetrated the lair from deeper underground caverns. Despite the fact that the catacombs had long collapsed by the 14 century, it was believed that the beholder still dwelt in the old dragons lair underneath central Waymoot.\nWaymoot began its existence as a muddy troll-infested campground that grew in size as woodcutters created a clearing, eventually becoming a compound and, eventually, a trade center and horse farms around a fortified keep.\nFilfar \"Trollkiller\" Woodband in his youth, sometime in the early-to-mid 14 century DR successfully defended Waymoot from an attacking horde of trolls virtually singlehandedly – the deed that gave him the \"Trollkiller\" moniker and later allowed him to be granted the title of the towns Lord.\nHistorically, Waymood was known for its rough edge and crime with a notorious thieves guild along with other sinister organizations operating in Waymoot.
