'''Sklorn''' was the easternmost of the three islands located west of [[Thelve]] and the the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]].

==Description==
Sklorn was a large rocky outcropping rising from the [[Sea of Swords]] – an island of fissured [[granite]] with temperate woods growing among the cracks. Sklorn had rock-basin pools of freshwater collected from melted snow and summer fogs as well as several freshwater springs. The island's center was a rocky elevation with freshwater streams cascading off it towards the island's harbors. Sklorn was {{SI|8|mile|k|long=yes}} diagonally in length with its southern shores being approximately {{SI|8|mile|k|long=yes}} long.

The southern shores had two anchorages on both sides of the island's main harbor, sometimes called [[Sklorn's Rest]]. The second harbor was located at the center of the western shores. Many shipwrecks littered the island's shoreline – the legacy of Sklorn being used by pirates and buccaneers.

==Geography==
Sklorn was located to the west of Thelve, with two sister islands to the northwest – the middle [[Unglur]] and the westernmost island of [[Raerest]]. Together Sklorn, Unglur, and Raerest were known as the [[Crab Reach]], or simply the Reach among the locals. The shortest distance between Sklorn's easternmost cape and Thelve was {{SI|10|mile|k|long=yes}} of the Sea of Swords, and {{SI|2|mile|k|long=yes}} separated it from Unglur.

===Flora & Fauna===
Sklorn was home to a significant population of seabirds – [[gray coaster]]s, that stained the island's southern shore rocks with white streaks of [[guano]] underneath their colony habitats. Several species of predatory sea creatures could also be found on the island. All three islands of the Crab Reach were abundant with [[crab]]. Among other occasional inhabitants were castaways and some roaming monsters.

==History==
Historically, Sklorn had long been used by pirates. The island's main harbor – Sklorn's Rest, was believed to had been named after a sailor. However, sages of Candlekeep theorized that [[Sklorn]] was not a sailor or a pirate but rather the name of a [[human]] or [[half-orcish]] caln that inhabited the island some centuries before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
