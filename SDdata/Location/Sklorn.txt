Sklorn was the easternmost of the three islands located west of Thelve and the the fortress library of Candlekeep.
Sklorn was a large rocky outcropping rising from the Sea of Swords – an island of fissured granite with temperate woods growing among the cracks. Sklorn had rock-basin pools of freshwater collected from melted snow and summer fogs as well as several freshwater springs. The islands center was a rocky elevation with freshwater streams cascading off it towards the islands harbors. Sklorn was  diagonally in length with its southern shores being approximately  long.
The southern shores had two anchorages on both sides of the islands main harbor, sometimes called Sklorns Rest. The second harbor was located at the center of the western shores. Many shipwrecks littered the islands shoreline – the legacy of Sklorn being used by pirates and buccaneers.
Sklorn was located to the west of Thelve, with two sister islands to the northwest – the middle Unglur and the westernmost island of Raerest. Together Sklorn, Unglur, and Raerest were known as the Crab Reach, or simply the Reach among the locals. The shortest distance between Sklorns easternmost cape and Thelve was  of the Sea of Swords, and  separated it from Unglur.
Sklorn was home to a significant population of seabirds – gray coasters, that stained the islands southern shore rocks with white streaks of guano underneath their colony habitats. Several species of predatory sea creatures could also be found on the island. All three islands of the Crab Reach were abundant with crab. Among other occasional inhabitants were castaways and some roaming monsters.
Historically, Sklorn had long been used by pirates. The islands main harbor – Sklorns Rest, was believed to had been named after a sailor. However, sages of Candlekeep theorized that Sklorn was not a sailor or a pirate but rather the name of a human or half-orcish caln that inhabited the island some centuries before the late 14 century DR.
