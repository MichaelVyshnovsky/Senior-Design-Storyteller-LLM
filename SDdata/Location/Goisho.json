        "mainbody": "Goisho was a town in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur. It lay at the edge of the foothills of the Vorkani Mountains, beside the Quang Muku Forest, on the Hoparatu River.\nFor many years, the Hui Wing, a massive magical brazier that revealed the future and was one of the most valued relics of Koryo, was the centerpiece of a shrine near Goisho. It was tended to by the Wing-ta order of monks. However, some ten generations before 1357 DR, Kozakuran forces stole the Hui Wing and carried it off to Karak, and they built it into their fortress there."
