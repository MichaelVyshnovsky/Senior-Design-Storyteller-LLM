        "mainbody": "'''Tagarath''' was a village in far eastern [[Tethyr]] ''circa'' the [[1480 DR|Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR]].",
        "Geography": "This village was located on the [[Tethir Road]] between [[Riatavin]] and the [[Vilhon Reach]] at the ford across the [[Shining Stream]].<ref group=\"note\">The [[gnome]] village of [[Elbencort]] was also located at this spot, ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. It is unknown if they coexisted at the same time or if Tagarath supplanted Elbencort. It is possible they were on opposite sides of the river.",
        "Government": "Tagarath was ruled by a crownar (the equivalent of a mayor) and a council of local merchants. As of 1480 DR, the crownar was [[Orth Haelen]] and the council had eight members. However, throughout the 1470s, Orth's daughter [[Alaya Haelen|Alaya]] had assumed control of the day-to-day responsibilities of the crownar because her father was aging and in poor health. Laws were enforced by the Riders, a small local police force, and the crownar employed a dozen or so \"watchers\" (spies) and agents. Being a very small town, the watchers were seven elderly and nosy women and the agents were Alaya's two younger sisters and her three suitors. There were also tax collectors that made their rounds holding the leashes of trained [[dog|war dogs]].",
        "Trade": "Tagarath was well situated on a major trade route and had the typical services for merchants and caravans passing through. Agents of the [[Zhentarim]] or other tyrannical merchant organizations were unwelcome in Tagarath and were surreptitiously killed by the crownar's agents when identified.",
        "Defenses": "The only official entity defending Tagarath was the Riders."
