'''Tabira's Spire''' was the location of a gate out of [[Avernus]].

==Description==
The spire still had the bones of an erinyes hanging from it.

==History==
The location had taken its name when an [[erinyes]] had been punished by impaling her on the spire, and she had later died begging for mercy. There was a [[portal]] leading out, for those who touched the right bone and said the right words. The area was shunned.
