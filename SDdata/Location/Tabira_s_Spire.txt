Tabiras Spire was the location of a gate out of Avernus.
The spire still had the bones of an erinyes hanging from it.
The location had taken its name when an erinyes had been punished by impaling her on the spire, and she had later died begging for mercy. There was a portal leading out, for those who touched the right bone and said the right words. The area was shunned.
