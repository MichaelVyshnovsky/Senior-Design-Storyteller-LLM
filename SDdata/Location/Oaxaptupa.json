        "mainbody": "Oaxaptupa was a settlement of tlincalli located in the former dwarven realm of Xothaerin.\nThe settlement was filled with crudely built building and piles of rubble. This was a result of the tlincalli demolishing many of the old dwarven buildings. The reason for this was twofold. Firstly, the dwarves built their home and shops in a way that was similar to their physical sature short and stout. The tall tlincalli were unable to fit within many of the buildings, so they either removed every other floor in taller buildings, removed a structures roof entirely or merely tore it down. They also removed all stairs as tlincalli did not require them. \nSecondly, tlincalli divinatory magic required perfect architectural geometric symmetry. Any structure found blocking their mystical grid system was promptly torn down. Rubble from the demolished strctures was either repurposed as building material or simply placed into piles around the settlement.\nOaxaptupa was not welcoming of outsiders. Any visitor was thoroughly scrutinized upon arrival and if they are deemed a threat in the slighest, they are taken prisoner.\nOaxaptupa was located about  beneath the Small Teeth, a small mountain range located in the surface realm of Amn.\nOaxaptupa was organized into thirty clans, ruled by the Diviner caste.\nOaxaptupa had a very informal defense system. Roughly half the clans were engaged as raiders or scouts. \nBeginning in , explorers, merchants and mercenaries from Amn began colonizing and exploring Maztica. The actions of these settlers were noticed by a nearby settlement of tlincalli, who interpreted the appearance of these newcomers as a divine signal to conquer their lands. In , the Diviner caste of this settlement began an extremely complicted and powerful mass ritual with the intention of teleporting as many tlincalli warriors as possible to the lands of the Faer√ªnians. In  the ritual was successfully completed and over a thousand tlincalli were teleported to caves and tunnels below Amn.\nQuickly discovering that these caves and tunnels were unsuitable for their needs, the tlincallis moved deeper into the Underdark, eventually discovering the ruined kingdom of Xothaerin. The inhabitants of Xothaerin, primarily azers, efreeti, fire elementals and salamanders, were quickly overwhelmed by the tlincallis and forced from the caverns and tunnels of Xothaerin. Hundreds were taken prisoners and were sacrificed to celebrate the tlincalli victory.\nWith the onset of the Spellplague in the , Oaxaptupa vanished, and none knew whether it had been completely destroyed or otherwise transported wholly to Abeir. In its place was a massive plaguecave in which the laws of nature were ever-shifting and the only inhabitants were bloodthirsty, colossal insects.It is implied that these insects were possibly plaguechanged tlincallis.\nthumb|center|500px|The remnants of Oaxaptupa circa the .\n* Plaza of Visions\n* Corantllil Workshop\n* Temple of Huoxopica"
