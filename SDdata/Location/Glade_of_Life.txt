The Glade of Life was a sacred place of worship for followers of Shiallia, Chauntea, Eldath, Lurue, and Mielikki.
The Glade of Life was located within the High Forest of northwest Faer√ªn near the aarakocra village of Khlecayre at the base of the Star Mounts.
Massive oak trees well over a thousand years old surrounded the glade. The Unicorn Run flowed through the glade, sprouting from the Fountain of Unicorns found near its center. A unique fey beauty encompassed the glade that was found nowhere else in the Realms.
Korreds and other magical creatures danced within the glade on a nightly basis. Avatars of the four goddesses of the glade had been known to join the korred from time to time.
Many of Shiallias clergy occupied the glade before leaving to wander the High Forest. Only an ancient korred known as the Dancer of Life remained at all times.
