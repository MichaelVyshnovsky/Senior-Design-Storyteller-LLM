        "mainbody": "Crimel was a small city in Luiren in the Shining South.\nCrimel was found along the edge of the Long Forest.\nOnly a thousand people lived in the city. Most of them were directly involved in the logging business given the close proximity to the Long Forest. Priests of Yondalla ensured that any timber harvest from the forest was done in an appropriate manner.\nSilvo Carver served as mayor of Crimel.\nA small force of 50 halfling warders protected Crimel. These Warders were particularly skilled in the ways of the forest."
