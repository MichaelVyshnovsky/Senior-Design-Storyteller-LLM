        "Geography": "Cape Velen encompassed the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]], which was also called the Velen Peninsula or the Tethyr Peninsula. Most of the settled land was on the coast; the interior of the peninsula was forested and connected to the [[Forest of Tethir]] to the east.\n\nThis duchy contained the counties of [[Firedrake (county)|Firedrake]], [[Fyraven]], and [[Greenshores]].",
        "Government": "Duke Llachior Blackthorn ruled the Cape from castle [[Tordraken]].\n\nAfter the successful succession from Tethyr, [[Duke Calchais]] rules over the small now independent duchy.",
        "History": "The founding clans of Tethyr originated in this part of the country.\n\nThe coast of Cape Velen was struck by an immense tidal wave on [[Midsummer]] Night in the {{YearlinkName|-133}}. The flooding killed a large percentage of the population of the peninsula, including all the members of [[Clan Tarseth]], and destroyed the city of [[Velen]].\n\nIn [[1424 DR]] they declared their independence from the Tethyr and became an autonomous duchy. Velen had become isolated from the rest of Tethyr due to the founding of [[Muranndin]] which cut off their land-based routes of travel to the larger kingdom. Initially this created tension with Tethyr, but over time relations between the two realms were re-established and they considered one another as allies.",
        "Rumors": "Cape Velen was said to have been infested with ghosts. The people living there, however, did not seem much bothered by this.\n\nBy 1369 DR, the [[Twisted Rune]] had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations."
