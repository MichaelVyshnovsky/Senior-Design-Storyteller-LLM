'''Aleaxtis''' ({{Pronounce|al|ee|AKS|tiss|refs=

==Geography==
This kingdom occupied the eastern leg of the [[Alamber Sea]], which made up a large portion of that sea,

The exact location of the kingdom was a mystery to the surface dwellers of the [[Old Empires]], though they mistakenly believed it to lay somewhere north of the Ship of the Gods. Others thought it resided somewhere within the top third of the Alamber Sea.<ref>

==History==
The kingdom of Aleaxtis was founded in the year {{YearlinkConvert|-740|TS}}, by the sahuagin [[T'Raam]]. His reign would go on for 297 years.

T'Raam would be succeeded by the sahuagin [[Vhloar]], whose reign would span 468 years. During his reign,<ref>

In {{YearlinkConvert|726|TS}}, the [[Ninth Serôs War]] comes to an ends, sending many of the merrow of [[Serôs]] fleeing past the [[Sharksbane Wall]] and into invading the territory of Aleaxtis. The then-king, [[Daqueev]], sends a massive raiding party over the Sharksbane Wall in retaliation and prolongs the Ninth Serôs War by another year.

During the reign of King [[Kromes]], the kingdom regularly sank the trading ships of [[Mulhorand]], [[Thay]], and [[Unther]]. As well as regularly engaged in raids on the Untheric cities of [[Messemprar]] and [[Mourktar]], attacking their coastal farms and fishing boats.<ref> At some point the [[Red Wizards]] began paying tribute to the sahuagin in an attempt to protect their vessels, establishing a nominal friendship between the two nations, but occasional sinkings continued. Both the cults of [[Cult of Tiamat|Tiamat]] and [[Cult of Set|Set]] also approached the sahuagin seeking an alliance, but Kromes refused them.

''Circa'' [[1270 DR]], the high [[priest]] of the [[Kossuthan]] temple [[Flaming Brazier (Bezantur)|Flaming Brazier]] attempted to douse the Alamber Sea with a ''[[decanter of endless lamp oil]]'' and then ignite it as an elaborate ritual to summon his deity's [[avatar]]. From this incident onward King Kromes and his subjects harbored bitter hatred for [[Bezantur]] and its Kossuthan clergy. This hatred was sometimes expressed by small parties of sahuagin committing nighttime raids on Bezantur's supplies and slaves.

''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], high priest [[Delahine Marinus]] of the [[Church of the Sacred Sea]] forged an alliance with Kromes to assault the Kossuthans of Bezantur. To this end, the [[Istishian]]s unleashed a rare cooperative variant of ''[[tsunami]]'' upon the city, then 500 of Aleaxtis's elite warriors stormed Bezantur in its wake to destroy whatever renamed of the Flaming Brazier.

==Relationships==
Throughout its existence the kingdom of Aleaxtis had hostile relations with the merrow tribes of the Alamber Sea, who occupied mountainous areas that proved far too difficult for the sahuagin to fully root them out from.

==Notable Locations==
* Nine towns and numerous villages were scattered throughout the kingdom, the former of which would go on to be renamed by its successor state.
* [[Vahaxtyl]], the capital city of Aleaxtis.
