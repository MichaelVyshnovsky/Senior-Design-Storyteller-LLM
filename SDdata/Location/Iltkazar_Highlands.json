        "Government": "The official ruler of the Principality of the Iltkazar Highlands was Prince [[Coram Rhindaun]]. As he was still an infant, the Monarch's Champion, [[Vander Stillhawk]], ruled in his stead.",
        "History": "Historically, this region of Tethyr was less civilized than the western areas of that country. Monsters were a problem in the area, and many armies marched through its lands in times past.\n\nIn the month of [[Ches]], in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard (1370 DR)]], the [[Amn]]ian settlements of [[Trailstone]] and [[Riatavin]] succeeded from Amn to join Tethyr. Since Riatavin was a bustling and rich metropolis, its inclusion in the Upper Highlands boosted the Iltkazar Highlands from the poorest to the richest territory of Tethyr."
