        "mainbody": "The Iltkazar Highlands were the eastern principality of the Kingdom of Tethyr.\nThe eastern Highlands sloped upwards to the chain of mountains that included the Snowflake, Omlarandin, and Alimir Mountains.\nThe Upper Highlands were designated as the Golden Marches the Lower Highlands made up the Duchy of Suretmarch.\nThe official ruler of the Principality of the Iltkazar Highlands was Prince Coram Rhindaun. As he was still an infant, the Monarchs Champion, Vander Stillhawk, ruled in his stead.\nHistorically, this region of Tethyr was less civilized than the western areas of that country. Monsters were a problem in the area, and many armies marched through its lands in times past.\nIn the month of Ches, in the Year of the Tankard (1370 DR), the Amnian settlements of Trailstone and Riatavin succeeded from Amn to join Tethyr. Since Riatavin was a bustling and rich metropolis, its inclusion in the Upper Highlands boosted the Iltkazar Highlands from the poorest to the richest territory of Tethyr."
