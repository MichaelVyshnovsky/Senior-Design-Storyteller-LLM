The '''Chamber of the Court''' was a part of the Coronal's palace in [[Myth Drannor|Cormanthor]].

==Description==
The floor was glassy-smooth. Tapestries hung somewhere on the room.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|339-340|19}} The roof was vaulted. At least one person in {{yearlink|261}} had brought a footstool.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|341-343|20}} At least one of the tapestries had a window behind it.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|367|Epilogue}}

Across from the doors was the [[Pool of Remembrance]], above which floated the [[Throne of the Coronal]].{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|357|20}}

==Defenses==
There were wards, that would, amongst other things, prevent a dragon from being summoned.

Courtiers usually remained at both sides of the room, while [[armathor]]s stood watch by the door.

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, the Chamber of the Court was visited by Lords [[Haladavar (Lord)|Haladavar]], [[Urddusk (Lord)|Urddusk]], and [[Malgath (Lord)|Malgath]], who after threatening violence, were informed of the plans to raise a [[Mythal]].

The chamber was the site of a coup attempt by [[Llombaerth Starym]] in {{yearlink|261}}, which was followed immediately by the raising of the ''[[Mythal]]''.
