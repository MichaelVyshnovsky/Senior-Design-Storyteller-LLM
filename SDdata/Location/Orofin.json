        "mainbody": "'''Orofin''', formerly known as '''Orolin''' the '''City of Magicians''', was an oasis-city in [[Anauroch]] that dated back to the ancient realm of [[Asram]].",
        "Description": "The great fortress of Orofin stood in the center of the city, out from which extended four long canals lined with [[acacia]] and other fruit-bearing [[Tree|trees]]. These waterways divided the city into four distinct quarters, connecting at a circular canal that marked the borders of the city. Each of the four quarters were connected by great [[granite]] bridges decorated with mosaics in the shape of diamonds.\n\nA system of pumps directed water from the canals out into the fields that encircled the city. By 1357&nbsp;DR the water of these canals was poisoned and quite harmful if drank.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The city sat within a wide, grass-covered vale that sat within a natural ridge formation."
        },
        "Trade": "During the golden years of Asram, [[mage]]s could be solicited for hire on nearly any street of the city. They would often offer protection for expeditions into the desert in search of valuable natural minerals like [[copper]], [[gold]], and [[zinc]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Orofin was the site of a great battle between the allied tribes of the Bedine and the formidable [[Zhentilar]] army of the [[Moonsea]]. The Bedine emerged victorious, stopping the campaign of conquest the Zhents had waged in order to gain strategic control over the Anauroch desert.\n\nSome time over the next decade or so, a band of [[Talontar blightlord]]s received a vision from the [[Talona|Mistress of Disease]], telling them that Orofin would be the site of the next great plague that would fall upon [[Faer√ªn]].\n\nSometime in the century after [[Thultanthar]] returned to [[Toril]], and the empire of [[Netheril]] was reformed, Orofin was rebuilt as a home to those Bedine that gave up the nomadic lifestyle of their forebears. These city-dwelling inhabitants of Anauroch began referring to themselves as the [[Netherese]] people.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Legend states that some great ancient cache of riches lay somewhere buried within the city, though nothing of note has ever been recovered.",
        "Notable Locations": "The fortress of Orofin was a grand tower surrounded by a spacious courtyard.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of 1370s [[DR]] Orofin was overrun by bands of roaming [[ghouls]]. These monstrosities were the risen [[Zhent]] soldiers that perished during their battle with the Bedine, brought back in [[undeath]] by the devotees of [[Talona]].\n\nFollowing its reconstruction some time before the late 1470s DR, the city was home to ethnic Bedine who referred to themselves as Netherese. Although they were quite rare, some [[krinth]]s and [[asabi]]s could be found living within the city."
