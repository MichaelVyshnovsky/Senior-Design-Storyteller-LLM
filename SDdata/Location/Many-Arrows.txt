The '''Kingdom of Many-Arrows''', sometimes called the '''Kingdom of Dark Arrows''', was an [[orc]] kingdom in the [[North]] founded by [[Obould Many-Arrows]].

By the time that the kingdom fell in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it had come to be known as the homeland of orcs who valued civilization, and who found as much pride in building their own realm as in tearing down others'. It was suggested that the Kingdom's success had done much to improve the reputation of orcs overall.

==Geography==
Much of Many-Arrows territory was confined to the icy and windswept mountains of the [[Spine of the World]] north of [[Mithral Hall]]. Crude signs warned visitors when they had entered the Kingdom's borders.

==Government==
Many-Arrows was a monarchy ruled by kings famous for being far more peaceful than a typical orc ruler.

In [[1479 DR]], Many-Arrows was ruled by King [[Obould XVII]] from his skull-adorned, horned throne in [[Dark Arrow Keep]].

==Possessions==
The fiercest warriors among the Many-Arrows orcs wore [[Belt of the Many Arrows|distinctive belts]] decorated with the traditional totems of the Many-Arrows tribe.

==History==
[[File:Many-Arrows onslaught.png|thumb|''The insignia of the Many-Arrow.''|280x280px]]
Prior to the founding of the Kingdom, the Many-Arrows tribe was known as the most notorious and most successful orc tribe in the North, boasting about 40,000 members as of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR. They operated out of the [[Citadel of Many Arrows]] until they were ousted in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, at which point they moved west to Dark Arrow Keep, which they claimed from its [[giant]] inhabitants.{{Cite dragon/429/History Check: Dark Arrow Keep}} Although their numbers were decimated, and were widely expected to raise a horde and launch an invasion of the whole [[Silver Marches]].

The Kingdom of Many-Arrows was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, 

The [[Obould]] dynasty reigned almost uninterrupted from the kingdom's founding into the late 15{{th}} century DR. Although there were some civil wars, one of which lasted a decade during which time the realm was divided, these interval conflicts had ended by the {{YearlinkName|1460}}.

The Many-Arrows orcs were in constant conflict with the [[Uthgardt]] of the region but were ostensibly at peace with their neighbors in [[Luruar]], and some trade did occur between the two realms. However, the relationship was rarely friendly and always tense even if open conflict was avoided save for the occasional raid. 

In the late 1470s DR, King [[Obould XVII]] sent a vanguard to scout the ruins of [[Neverwinter]], which had been destroyed by a [[cataclysm (Neverwinter)|cataclysm]] decades prior. However, the leader of this group, [[Vansi Bloodscar]], defied her orders and instead led her troops to occupy parts of the northern half of the city, using the remains of the [[Cloak Tower]] as a base. These orcs soon fell under the sway of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], and some of their leaders&mdash;including Bloodscar herself&mdash;accepted the Sovereignty's "blessings" in the form of [[spellscar]]s. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Bloodscar was effectively in open rebellion against Many-Arrows and was at war with the [[Neverwinter Guard]].

In the mid–1480s DR, renegade shamans of [[Gruumsh]] desired a return to the old orc ways and wished to attack their neighbors instead of continuing to foster peaceful relations with them.<ref>The peace and stability of Many-Arrows fell into disarray in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, when the [[drow]] [[Quenthel Baenre]] incited the orcs into war. The orc [[Hartusk]], a known detractor of Obould's peaceful methodology,

As the [[War of the Silver Marches]] raged, Bruenor and his dwarves were able to defeat the last of Chief Hartusk's forces and seized the Many-Arrows capital at Dark Arrow Keep. Thanks to the negotiation efforts of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], the dwarves came to understand the political situation that had seen the more peaceful Lorgru dethroned. As the surviving forces of Many-Arrows rallied behind Lorgru, the restored king expressed his desire to continue his father's legacy of peaceful integration with the people of the Silver Marches. However, Bruenor had lost faith in the ability for the orcs to coexist with the Silver Marches, and so banished Lorgru and his followers into the mountains and completely destroyed Dark Arrow Keep. By autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the Kingdom of Many-Arrows had been erased,
