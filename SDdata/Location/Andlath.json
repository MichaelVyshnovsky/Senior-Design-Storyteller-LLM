        "History": "Andlath's legacy was the [[Tethir Road]], built between the {{YearlinkName|230}} (the year KingKing [[Dalagar|Dalagar \"Longwalker\"]] took the throne) and the {{YearlinkName|239}}. The road stretched from [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]] to [[Ormath]] in the Shining Plains. Dalagar \"Longwalker\" attempted to unite [[South Faer√ªn]] through trade and expand Andlath's borders and influence. The tumultuous decade of building the road was filled with wars and strife caused by the project and attacks from [[elves]] and [[dwarves]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|232}}, Andlath lost control over its [[centaur]] slave population. Hearts of angry centaurs shattered the kingdom into a collection of scattered outposts and embattled besieged lands. King Dalagar personally helmed over forty battles in the course of a single year as the construction of the Tethir Road continued.\n\nIt was believed that Emperor [[Shoon IV]] of [[Calimshan]] was instrumental in the creation of the Tethir Road through magical means or political pressure."
