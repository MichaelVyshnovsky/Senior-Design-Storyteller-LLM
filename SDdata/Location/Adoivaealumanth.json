        "Geography": "This city was located beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], in an area known as the [[Easting Reach]], off the coast of [[Telflamm]].<ref>",
        "Description": "The various buildings within Adoivaealumanth were constructed of various types of [[coral]]. After the city was abandoned, with no one to tend to them the buildings grew into massive coral reefs, sealing up the doorways and windows they once had.",
        "Culture": "Having been founded for the purposes of religious devotion, neither trade nor any political activities were conducted in the holy city of Adoivaealumanth.",
        "Notable Buildings": "In addition to its grand temple to Deep Sashelas, the city held a great temple to [[Trishina]] and smaller temples to all other [[deities]] of the ocean that were commonly worshiped in [[Serôs]].",
        "History": "Adoivaealumanth was constructed in {{YearlinkName|-3645}} as a labor of religious devotion by lesser royals of Aryselmalyr. Over the centuries it went unscathed by the many wars that plagued Serôs, having been protected by the Law of Gods,\n\nHowever, sometime around the {{YearlinkName|718}}, during the [[Tenth Serôs War]], an unknown force was unleashed in the city that spread a virulent [[disease]] rendering gills raw and blistered. Over a period of what Serôsians referred to as \"two tides\" the whole populace of Adoivaealumanth fell to the illness. The city was then left abandoned for centuries, considered by Serôsians to be [[curse]]d.It is impossible to ascertain exactly how long \"two tides\" means in the context of the Serôsian world view. This is because, as stated on page 61 of ''Sea of Fallen Stars'', among the people of Serôs \"Very little strict attention is placed on the specific passage of time by hours and such. Time in the day-to-day sense is measured in broad, activity-specific terms...\"\n\nAt some point, two large ships, which were either sailing towards or from the port city of Telflamm, fell directly upon the ruined city. Its coral reefs would overtake these wrecks with time, incorporating the skeletons they left behind.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1279}}, members of the [[Church of Deep Sashelas]] made efforts to reclaim Adoivaealumanth and its grand temple to their god. Taking up residence within the temple, they split their time between exploring the city for any treasures it might still hold, cleaning it up, and tending to the faithful."
