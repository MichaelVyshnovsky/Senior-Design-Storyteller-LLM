Over the centuries it went unscathed by the many wars that plagued Serôs, having been protected by the Law of Gods,\nHowever, sometime around the , during the Tenth Serôs War, an unknown force was unleashed in the city that spread a virulent disease rendering gills raw and blistered. Over a period of what Serôsians referred to as \"two tides\" the whole populace of Adoivaealumanth fell to the illness. The city was then left abandoned for centuries, considered by Serôsians to be cursed.It is impossible to ascertain exactly how long \"two tides\" means in the context of the Serôsian world view. This is because, as stated on page 61 of Sea of Fallen Stars, among the people of Serôs \"Very little strict attention is placed on the specific passage of time by hours and such. Time in the day-to-day sense is measured in broad, activity-specific terms...\"\nAt some point, two large ships, which were either sailing towards or from the port city of Telflamm, fell directly upon the ruined city. Its coral reefs would overtake these wrecks with time, incorporating the skeletons they left behind.\nIn the , members of the Church of Deep Sashelas made efforts to reclaim Adoivaealumanth and its grand temple to their god.
