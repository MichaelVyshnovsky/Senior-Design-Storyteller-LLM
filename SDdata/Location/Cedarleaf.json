        "mainbody": "'''Cedarleaf''' was a [[wood elf]] settlement in the [[Rawlinswood]] of southeastern [[Damara]], located near the [[Gemspark Mine|Gemspark mine]]. It was the home village of [[Zhai]], the [[half-drow]] daughter of a [[drow]] female and a wood elf male.",
        "Description": "[[File:Demon Stone concept Cedarleaf at night.png|thumb|250px|''Cedarleaf at night, concept art.'']]\nThe village was a sprawling [[elf|elven]] tree settlement. It had many magical enchantments through out that utilize the trees and roots as bridges and gates. A large [[Cosmology|inter-planar]] [[portal]] was located within the village as well as several magical \"safe houses\" the elves used in time of crisis.",
        "History": "[[File:Demon Stone concept Cedarleaf warrior.jpg|thumb|250px|''A Cedarleaf warrior,<br>concept art by [[T. J. Phan]].'']]\nThe village was decimated when a [[githyanki]] general used the town's portal to begin bringing her army through. The general, [[Cireka]], was stopped by a trio of adventurers, [[Rhannek]], [[Illius]] and [[Zhai]]. Shortly thereafter, the [[slaad]] lord, [[Ygorl]], teleported in with his slaad army. The [[githyanki]] and [[slaad]] forces laid waste to the village and slaughtered many of its inhabitants. If not for the efforts of the aforementioned adventurers, the town and its inhabitants might have been completely destroyed.\n\nThe trio returned to Cedarleaf to find the elves rebuilding their home."
