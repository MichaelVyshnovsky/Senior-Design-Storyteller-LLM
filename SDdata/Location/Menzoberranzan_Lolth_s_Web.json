        "mainbody": "olths Web was a neighborhood of the district of West Wall in Menzoberranzan that was suspended from the ceiling and walls by calcified spider silk.\nLolths Web was located in West Wall next to the district of Narbondellyn. It consisted of hundreds of strands of calcified spider silk stretching from the ceiling to the ground in a dense latticework. Hollow, cocoon-like structures, both on top of and below the webs, provided living space. Narrow ladders connected the levels for those without the ability to levitate.\nLolths Web was constructed by survivors of the destruction of Ched Nasad, which fell in 1372 DR. Over the next hundred years, the survivors based Lolths Web on the structure of their home city, using magical techniques to weave the web.\n House Melarn\n Formed in 1383 DR, the houses compound was shaped like a nautilus.\nCategoryWards\nCategoryLocations in West Wall\nCategoryLocations in Menzoberranzan\nCategoryLocations in the Northdark\nCategoryLocations in the Upperdark\nCategoryLocations in the Underdark\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nr5ex0reje9b3jsjza9a2ke86o4qsqtq"
