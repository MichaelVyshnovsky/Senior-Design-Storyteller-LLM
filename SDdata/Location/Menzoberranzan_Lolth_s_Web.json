        "Description": "Lolth's Web was located in West Wall next to the district of [[Narbondellyn]]. It consisted of hundreds of strands of calcified spider silk stretching from the ceiling to the ground in a dense latticework. Hollow, cocoon-like structures, both on top of and below the webs, provided living space. Narrow ladders connected the levels for those without the ability to [[levitate]].",
        "History": "Lolth's Web was constructed by survivors of the destruction of [[Ched Nasad]], which fell in [[1372 DR]]. Over the next hundred years, the survivors based Lolth's Web on the structure of their home city, using magical techniques to weave the web.",
