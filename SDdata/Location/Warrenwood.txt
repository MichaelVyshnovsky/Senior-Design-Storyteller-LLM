'''Warrenwood''', previously known as '''Sleepy Wood''', was a small but densely overgrown forest found near the middle of [[Bloodstone Barony]].

The forest's name was derived from the [[Warren]] fortress found under the ground.

==Geography==
Warrenwood was located a few miles southeast of [[Bloodstone Village]] along the western banks of the [[Beaumaris River]].

==Inhabitants==
Warrenwood was the home of a large clan of [[centaur]]s in the region.

[[Emelyn]] ran a school for centaurs within the forest, but this was destroyed by the forces of [[Zhengyi]]. Emelyn vowed to rebuild the school with the help of his apprentice, [[Gabrielle]],

==History==
The forest served as a point of ambush during the [[Bloodstone Wars]] by the invading forces of [[Ostel]], [[Morov]] and [[Polten]]. Hidden within the thick forest, the invaders attacked the Bloodstone army but were crushed in a single night because of aid received from soldiers from the Warren and the native centaurs.
