        "mainbody": "The '''Hunting Gardens of the Hulorn''' was a private plot of land that belonged to [[Selgaunt]]'s hereditary merchant-prince that held the title of the [[Hulorn]].",
        "Description": "The private land was surrounded by high walls, preventing unwanted visitors and hunters from entering the area. The land had a thick-growing wildwood. Aptly named, the Gardens were used as the Hulorn's hunting ground and were stocked with various game and more exotic creatures, such as [[hippogriff]]s, [[griffon]]s, and [[sphinx|sphinxes]].",
        "Geography": "The expansive Hunting Gardens were located in the northeastern part of Selgaunt with the glorious [[Palace of the Hulorn]] towering above them. The grounds were off-limits to everyone but the Hulorn and their guests, though, on occasion, some enterprising individuals were able to crawl from the slop of the city's sewers to access the Hunting Gardens.",
        "History": "The Hunting Gardens were used for many social visits per the Hulorn's invitation. Sometime in the midâ€“14{{th}} century, [[Thamalon Uskevren]] a sell-respected patriarch of a Sembian noble house, was invited to a hunt. He brought his young daughter [[Thazienne Uskevren]] along, a trip she remembered fondly later in life. There, she saw her first-ever griffon, a young pup going through its first molt."
