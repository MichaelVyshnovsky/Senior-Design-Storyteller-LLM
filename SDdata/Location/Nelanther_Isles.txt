The '''Nelanther Isles''', also just called '''the Nelanther''', were a widely scattered chain of nearly one thousand islands west of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]] in the [[Trackless Sea]]. More than half the islands lacked potable water and were an unfit place to live. The hundreds of islands that could support life were fought over by ruthless pirates who tended to prey upon the shipping lines of [[Amn]], [[Tethyr]], [[Calimshan]], the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Geography==
The archipelago comprised hundreds of islands of various kinds, but only the biggest of them bore names and of these names only a handful were known to folk of mainland [[Faerûn]]. Maps drawn by mainlanders depicted these major islands and many of the smaller ones, but not the various currents and hazards like shoals and tiny exposed or submerged islets, such as would be encountered in the heart of the island group. Moreover, most of the islands were surrounded by perilous reefs. However, the local pirates knew them like the backs of their hands and knew all the hiding places and safe routes in the area, so the majority were never caught by the various of the [[Sea of Swords]].

The named islands were:
* [[Carcathen]]
* [[Hook Isle]]
* [[Ioma]]
* [[Irphong]]
* [[Skaug]]
* [[Nemessor]]
* [[Pelath's Isle|The Rookery]]
* [[Thordentor]]

The channel between the Nelanther Isles and the [[Tethyr Peninsula]] was known as '''Asavir's Channel''' (presumably named after the pirate [[Asavir]]). It was a well-traveled sea lane but treacherous because of the many pirates.

==History==
By [[1369 DR]], the [[Twisted Rune]] placed a magical gate on the islands to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.

==Demographics==
Aside from their shared acts of violence and larceny, the Nelanthers had surprisingly little in common with the [[Pirate Isles]] of the [[Dragon Coast]]. Most of the Nelanthers' pirates were nonhumans such as [[orcs]], [[lizardfolk]], [[ogres]] and [[minotaurs]]. These various races and factions waged war on each other as often as they did with outsiders.

==Life & Society==
The reavers of the Nelanther Isles were entirely honorless pirates that tortured their victims, leaving them to horrible deaths. The Nelanther youth were born into the society's violence and their only escape was death, typically while still young. Nearly all fit adults fought aboard ships, while weak and crippled children who somehow survived were left ashore to repair ships or salvage wrecks.

==Notable Locations==
Except for a couple of smaller settlements, the pirates of the Nelanther Isles lived in their ships or in huts that could be abandoned at a moment's notice.

===Ports===
;[[Skaug (port)|Skaug]]:

===Landmarks===
* The [[Sea Towers]]: Magically warded hard stone towers that were located on some of the islands and in the sea of the region.
