        "mainbody": "audor was an ancient Imaskari city in the Hordelands.\nBuilt during the Imaskari Empire, Raudor was a city nestled beneath a cliff of the Raurin Alta, in what was once a green vale. However, due to rock slides off the cliffs, and the expansion of the Plains of Purple Dust, the city became buried under sand and rock.\nWhile the buildings of Raudor were preserved by the sand, few visited the city due to the lack of treasure, and the citys ability to drive people insane. The few who did visit the city were mostly evil wizards, drawn by a desire to try to find the source of the citys evil, or the ancient evil artifacts that were said to be there, in attempts to increase their own power. On , there was a stench of death and decay filling the air for miles around the ruins.\nMost who visited the city died, many came back insane, and others still returned more crazy and powerful then they were before, serving as inspiration to others who sought power to come to the city.\nIn , there were few tales about the ruins, speaking of an overpowering evil presence that ruled the vermin around it. Deep Imaskari records suggested that the Fourth Imaskarcana had been there at the time of the citys fall. Over a hundred years later, in , that had become a rumor outside of Deep Imaskar.\nCategoryCities\nCategoryRuins\nCategoryLocations in the Raurin Alta\nCategoryLocations in the Plains of Purple Dust\nCategoryLocations in East Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nsj8dxdon4sw80gqnbfgyxdxsjdirmez"
