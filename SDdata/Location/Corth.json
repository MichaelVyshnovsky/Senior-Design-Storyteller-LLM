        "mainbody": "orth was a settlement in the area that would become Aglarond. It was founded by colonists from Chessenta in 756 DR. The fishing village lay in a cove with nearby beaches of white sand. As of 1368 DR, the population was around five hundred. During the winter, the weather is very windy with heavy seas, and not much fishing occurred.\nAt the centre of Corth Cove there was a craggy rock and the older fisherman of the village maintained that it was visited by merfolk, although others claim this is just a tale.\nAn inn called The Mermaids Purse was run by the ex-fisherman Droze, who offers small yet comfortable rooms and local fish.\nCategoryVillages\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryHuman locations\nCategoryLocations in Aglarond\nCategoryLocations in the Unapproachable East\nCategoryLocations in East Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\njhkfb8uo28pf85ug0rqcuzn1otdarob"
