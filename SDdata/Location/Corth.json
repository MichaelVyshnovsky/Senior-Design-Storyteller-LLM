It was founded by colonists from [[Chessenta]] in [[756 DR]].<ref> The fishing village lay in a cove with nearby beaches of white sand. As of [[1368 DR]], the population was around five hundred. During the winter, the weather is very windy with heavy seas, and not much fishing occurred.\n\nAt the centre of Corth Cove there was a craggy rock and the older fisherman of the village maintained that it was visited by [[merfolk]], although others claim this is just a tale.\n\nAn inn called '''[[The Mermaid's Purse]]''' was run by the ex-fisherman [[Droze]], who offers small yet comfortable rooms and local fish.\n\n{{Stub-geo}}",
