The '''Heartward''' was the central plaza of [[Helm's Hold]] as well as the city's open marketplace. It was infamous for being haunted by ghosts and apparitions that manifested themselves on nights when a waning moon was covered by clouds.<ref name=NCS-p167>

==Description==
Right in the center of this marketplace was a hangman's scaffold. When apparitions appeared on haunting nights, they went their business and occasionally performing a hanging.<ref name=NCS-p167 /> Numerous rows of vendor's stalls extended outwards from the gallows, encircling it towards the market's edge.

==Geography==
The Heartward was located in the middle of the city,<ref name=NCS-p167 /> its borders marked by a strong wall made of stone and wood.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Asmodeus]]-worshiping [[succubus]] [[Rohini]] bound a monstrosity known as [[Hexabaal]] to the gallows in the Heartward, but did not fully summon it to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Working with Councilwoman [[Alisara Callum]], the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] bought Hexabaal to Helm's Hold, allied itself with the creature against the [[Ashmadai]], and learned how to infiltrate the [[Sanatorium]] beneath the [[Cathedral of Helm]].

==Notable Locations==
The Heartward earned from the shrine of [[Sune]] that was built at the edge of the marketplace.<ref name=NCS-p167 /> Some time in the 1480's [[DR]], the shrine was converted into a proper temple called [[Heartward Hall]].
