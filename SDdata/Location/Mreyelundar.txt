'''Mreyelundar''' was a port city and a member of the confederation of the [[Dusk Ports]] in [[Laerakond]]. It was the most decadent of all the Dusk Ports.

==Description==
Mreyelundar was known for its wealth, decadence, lawlessness, and illicit practices. Gangs dominated the city and gained great wealth after having paid the [[green dragon]] [[Orlarrakh]] her due.

The free people of Mreyelundar loathed [[dragon]]s, having suffered first hand the depredations of the Green Duchess. In desperation, most of them turned to the cults of the [[Dawn Titans]] for succor. The [[Order of the Dawn]], founded some years before [[1479 DR]], gained enough influence to be considered a real force behind Mreyelundar's closed doors.

==Government==
Mreyelundar was ruled by a Gate Lord. In 1479 DR, the Gate Lord was [[Trusk Rantyne]]. However, he had no real power in the city, who was truly ruled by a mysterious thief known as [[Narnorn]].

==Economy==
The foremost goldsmiths and gemcutters in all of Laerakond lived and worked in Mreyelundar.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Trusk Rantyne]], the Gate Lord in 1479 DR.
* [[Narnorn]], a mysterious thief and the true power in the city.
* [[Rowan Babar]], the leader of the Order of the Dawn in 1479 DR.
