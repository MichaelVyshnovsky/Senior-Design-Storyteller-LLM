        "mainbody": "'''Mosstone''' was an enormous moss-covered rock found within [[Immil Vale]] in [[Rashemen]].\n\n{{quote|''Perhaps a marker, perhaps a fragment of dream left behind, this stone is a signpost. Beneath its shadow, we may find that our dreams are sharpened like a blade - and ring more true than steel.''|[[Gannayev-of-Dreams]]}}",
        "Description": "Mosstone was a massive rock carved with runes, flowing like water, and thick curtains of [[moss]]es. The runes were weathered by time and elements and their design evoked feelings of fleeting memories and flowing dreams.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, famed [[Kalach-Cha]] and their companions, including Gannayev-of-Dreams, ventured into Immil Vale in search of the fabled [[Wood Man]]. Gann felt the stone's connection to the Dreaming. He suggested the group rest in Mosstone's shade and ride the currents of dreams with Gann's help to grasp a piece of the [[Spirit-Eater]]'s history.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Anyone making camp in the shadow of Mosstone was visited with prophetic dreams while they slept. Some were even visited by the [[telthor]] [[Hulmarra Murnyetha]], and, if they reminded her of her long-dead husband, some men were spirited away by Hulmarra to return years later without having aged at all."
