        "mainbody": "The Broken Hills was a rough and rugged plot of land immediately beyond Nimpeths northeastern wall ending at the waters of the Vilhon Reach.\nThe rugged and unwelcoming rocks of the Broken Hills were turned into the agricultural wonder of the Vilhon â€“ Woren Vineyards. These sprawling vineyards were built through cruel slave labor by Woren, the Lord of Nimpeth. The vineyards overlooked the body of water of the Vilhon Reach and were walled off, securing the Lords property.\nThe Broken Hills were transformed into the vineyards through hard labor and astonishing feats of landscaping sometime before the  and before the visit from Adamar Session, Bard of Starmantle, during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Reach."
