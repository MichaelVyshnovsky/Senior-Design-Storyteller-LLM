        "mainbody": "The River District was one of the poorest and least reputable districts of Athkatla, encompassing the docks on the northern shore of the Alandor River west of the citys bridge. It was a crime-ridden and repellent section of the city, full of its poor and elderly, its destitute and criminals.\nThe streets of the district had a rank and foul odor.\nThe docks of the river district was among the locations where ships would recruit sailors for their voyages, and drop them off to take shore leave, which typically included drinking, fighting, and seeking companionship.\nAthkatlan barges would intercept ships that either couldnt, or refused to, dock at the river district and bring their cargo into the harbor. Others would haul garbage away from the docks and the city.\n* Copper Coronet A filthy dive bar full of smugglers and pirates."
