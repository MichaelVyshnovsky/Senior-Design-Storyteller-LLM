The '''Bay of Coxi''' was the bay at the end of the [[Zilhi River]]'s delta that entered the [[Trackless Sea]], or [[Taylola]], as it was known in [[Maztica]].

==Description==
The Bay of Coxi laid close to the southern end of the Maztican nation of [[Payit]], nestled between the [[Chuapli Forest]] to the north and [[Uzat Lagoon]] further to the south, on the border with the [[Far Payit]]. The Payitlan village of [[Coxi]] was built on the shored of a small lake at the end of Zilhi River's delta that eventually poured into the bay.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[H'Calos]] the Star Worm was awoken from its ancient slumber under the city of [[Ixtzul]] and rampaged through the region. Eventually, the gargantuan worm ravaged the town of Coxi, passing the Bay of Coxi. Subsequently, H'Calos was defeated by [[New Amn]]'s [[Golden Legion]] and Captain [[Alanza DaNosta]] led establishment of another New Amnian colony on the eastern side of the mouth of the Bay of Coxi.
