'''Jahaka Anchorage''' was a 15{{th}} century port settlement located in a secluded sea cave in the [[Jahaka Bay]] along the western shore of [[Chult]]. It served as the secret anchorage for a group of [[pirate]]s that raided ships in the waters surrounding [[Chult]].

==Description==
Beyond the pier, the anchorage house some living quarters, a makeshift prison, storage areas with a well-protected trove and a tavern called [[Bosco's Bilge]].

==Activities==
The pirates used Jahaka Anchorage to store their plunder and hold their captive slaves. Their respective captains formed a tenuous alliance with Commander [[Liara Portyr]] of [[Fort Beluarian]], granting a portion of their wealth along with safe passage for [[Baldurian]] ships in exchange for a blind eye to their operations.

==Government==
The settlement was led by the captain of whichever ship was docked in the port. Fittingly, only one ship dropped anchor at any given time.

==Defenses==
Any ship nearing the anchorage had to navigate through heavy mist and a perilous circle of underwater rocks. Beyond that, the anchorage was protected by a [[ballista]] mounted upon the lookout tower constructed atop [[Bosco's Bilge]].

The anchorage's treasure trove was protected by ten ''[[flying sword]]s''.

==Inhabitants==
The settlement was the safehouse for and temporary residence of a numbers of pirates, including those that served as crewmen aboard the ''[[Dragonfang (ship)|Dragonfang]]'', the ''[[Stirge (ship)|Stirge]]'' and the ''[[Emerald Eye]]''.

A number of [[reef shark]]s inhabited the waters surrounding the sea cave.
