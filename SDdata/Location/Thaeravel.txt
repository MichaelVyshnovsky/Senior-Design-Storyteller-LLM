'''Thaeravel''' was an ancient realm of [[sorcerer]]s in what would become [[Netheril]].

==Geography==
Thaeravel was north of the [[Windy Plains]], east of [[the Flats]] and south of the [[Shinantra Mountains]] and the [[Hidden Lake]]. After the plains turned to dust the area became known as the [[Quarter of Emptiness]] in [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Anauroch}}

==History==
The realm was founded around [[-4300 DR]] with its capital of [[Rasilith]]. It predated the foundation of [[Netheril]] by over three centuries, but the influence of [[elf|elven]] magical teachings, [[Arthindol]] the Terraseer, and the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' resulted in Netherese [[arcanists]] far outpacing the Thaeravelians, who grew complacent and decadent in time. Near the end of the Nether Age in [[-3392 DR]], it was conquered by the forces of Netheril and the sorcerers captured, their magical knowledge torn from their minds and leaving them gibbering wrecks. Some sorcerers managed to flee to uncertain fates, including [[Ondil]] of the [[Floating Tower]], which came to a rest near the future site of [[Secomber]].

As Anauroch expanded alongside the fall of Netheril, the area became an especially harsh and lifeless region of the Sword known as the Quarter of Emptiness. Rasilith became home to an underground colony of [[phaerimm]] who enslaved a tribe of [[laerti]]s.

Around the {{YearlinkName|233}}, the [[Brave Blades]] [[adventurer]]s delved into a sorcerer's [[spider]]-infested tomb there, finding clues that led them to the Floating Tower of the [[lich]] Ondil alongside [[Elminster|Elmara]].

The return of [[Thultanthar]] in [[1372 DR]] led to the extermination of phaerimm, and Rasilith was resettled with Bedine people who were acculturated to the Netherese.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was speculated that the sorcerers of Thaeravel who fled and survived Netheril's attack transformed themselves into the phaerimm in order to get revenge on their enemies.

As the realm of Thaeravel fell into legend, it was said to be the original homeland of Netheril, rather than an early victim of it.
