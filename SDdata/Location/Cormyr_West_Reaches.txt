The West Reaches of Cormyr was the stark frontier lands of the realm, encompassing the Storm Horns and Tunlands west of the kingdoms heartlands.
The west reaches were most famously defined by the Storm Horns, a range of towering mountains studded with beautiful vales, dour forts, and isolated villages. The passes were well-patrolled, but monsters and bandits were constant dangers to travelers, and the weather could turn deadly regardless of preparations. The High Road was the sole proper road through the region as it wound out of Cormyrs heartlands and into the Western Heartlands.
The reaches lay along the Storm Horns and extended into the lands beyond that Cormyr tenuously claimed. It reached as far as the Sunset Mountains in the west and the Goblin Marches in the north.
The Tunlands made up the far western frontier of the realm. It was a wide valley of rolling plains between the Storm Horns and the Sunset Mountains, containing the Tun River and the Marsh of Tun. It ostensibly lay within the borders of Cormyr for the purposes of dissuading other realms from claiming it, but was truly the domain of independent tribes such as the Tunlar as well as many monsters and bandits.
The Farsea Marshes lay at the north extent of the Tunlands near to the Goblin Marches and High Moors. It was inhabited by the Marsh Drovers.
The Veilstone Peaks were claimed by Cormyr, but lay at the faintest extent of its authority. Beyond the Tun River, the foothills of the Sunset Mountains were home to a collection of impoverished villages below the perilous Wolovers Keep, interspersed with copses of trees and placid ponds.
