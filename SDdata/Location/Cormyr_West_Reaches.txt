The '''West Reaches of Cormyr''' was the stark frontier lands of the realm, encompassing the [[Storm Horns]] and [[Tunlands]] west of the [[Heartlands of Cormyr|kingdom's heartlands]].

==Description==
The west reaches were most famously defined by the Storm Horns, a range of towering mountains studded with beautiful vales, dour forts, and isolated villages. The passes were well-patrolled, but monsters and bandits were constant dangers to travelers, and the weather could turn deadly regardless of preparations. The [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] was the sole proper road through the region as it wound out of Cormyr's heartlands and into the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Geography==
The reaches lay along the Storm Horns and extended into the lands beyond that Cormyr tenuously claimed. It reached as far as the [[Sunset Mountains]] in the west and the [[Goblin Marches]] in the north.

The [[Tunlands]] made up the far western frontier of the realm. It was a wide valley of rolling plains between the Storm Horns and the [[Sunset Mountains]], containing the [[Tun River]] and the [[Marsh of Tun]]. It ostensibly lay within the borders of Cormyr for the purposes of dissuading other realms from claiming it, but was truly the domain of independent tribes such as the [[Tunlar]] as well as many monsters and bandits.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Tunlands}}

The [[Farsea Marshes]] lay at the north extent of the Tunlands near to the [[Goblin Marches]] and [[High Moors]]. It was inhabited by the [[Marsh Drovers]].

The [[Veilstone Peaks]] were claimed by Cormyr, but lay at the faintest extent of its authority. Beyond the Tun River, the foothills of the Sunset Mountains were home to a collection of impoverished villages below the perilous [[Wolover's Keep]], interspersed with copses of trees and placid ponds.{{Cite interactive atlas|veilstone}}
