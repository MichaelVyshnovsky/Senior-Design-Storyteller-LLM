        "mainbody": "Beorunnas Well was a large settlement of the barbarians of the Black Lion Tribe.\nMembers of the tribe lived in modest houses around the deep pit that once contained the ancestral mound. At the bottom of the pit dwelt Underdark monsters that the barbarians feared.\nThe Black Lion tribe forsook their nomadic habits and settled in a small, roughly built town surrounded by a stockade, where they traded timber, furs, and smoked meat. The Red Tigers held a different opinion about living like the southern folk and often resolved their disputes in duels to the death. Traders and merchants were welcome, though the journey there was full of dangers.\n* Andar Heartwood\n* Patrevani Onehand\n* Hask Bloodaxe\n*Prudhosk Goldhand\n* Skelli Wildfoot\nThe town often traded with the dwarves of Citadel Felbarr, to whom they were connected by a trade route.\nLegend says that Beorunna, the father of Uthgar, defeated the demon Zukothoth at the ancestral mound, causing it to sink into the earth.\nIn 1372 DR, the Uthgardt tribes of Black Lion and Red Tiger both considered Beorunnas Well their ancestral mound."
