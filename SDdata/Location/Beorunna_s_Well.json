        "Description": "Members of the tribe lived in modest houses around the deep pit that once contained the ancestral mound. At the bottom of the pit dwelt [[Underdark]] monsters that the barbarians feared.\n\nThe Black Lion tribe forsook their nomadic habits and settled in a small, roughly built town surrounded by a stockade, where they traded timber, furs, and smoked meat. The [[Red Tiger Tribe|Red Tigers]] held a different opinion about living like the southern folk and often resolved their disputes in duels to the death. Traders and merchants were welcome, though the journey there was full of dangers.",

        "Relationships": "The town often traded with the [[dwarves]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]], to whom they were connected by a trade route.",
        "History": "Legend says that [[Gardolf Beorunna|Beorunna]], the father of [[Uthgar]], defeated the [[demon]] [[Zukothoth]] at the ancestral mound, causing it to sink into the earth.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], the [[Uthgardt]] tribes of Black Lion and Red Tiger both considered Beorunna's Well their ancestral mound."
