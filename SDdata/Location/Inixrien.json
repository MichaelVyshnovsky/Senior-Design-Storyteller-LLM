After its destruction, the ruins lay in the Selmal Basin in the Vilhon Reach.\nInixrien was founded in , as the tenth of the realms Cities of the Sword.\nBy , the empires long-running struggle with Unther led to the Untheric conquest of the Akanal region and Jhaamdath being invaded directly. Inixrien was attacked, and despite the defense by the heroic Hlath the city was taken, with much of eastern Jhaamdath taken by . This conquest was held until , when Jhaamdaths counter-conquest reclaimed much of what had been lost.\nIn the year of , Jhamdaath began a campaign of regional expansion that led to a brutal war with the elves of Nikerymath. In response, the  saw the elves use a High Magic ritual to destroy the heartlands of Jhaamdath with a great wave from the Inner Sea. The massive movement of water created the Vilhon Reach and sank Inixrien like the rest of the realm, and its psionic artifacts were buried in the sea floor where their emanations affected the nearby sealife.\nSunken Jhaamdath was later revealed by the dropping of sea levels after the Spellplague in 1385 DR, becoming the Vilhon Wilds. The lands and ruins were once again submerged in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering."
