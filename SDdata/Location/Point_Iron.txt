'''Point Iron''' was a small yet profitable [[iron]] mine located along the coast of the southern [[Moonsea]], north-east of [[Mulmaster]]. It was worked by [[dwarf|dwarves]] until around the 1260s [[DR]], but by [[1367 DR]] it had fallen under [[duergar]] control. Rumors persisted of a [[gold]] vein in the mine, but it was never found.
