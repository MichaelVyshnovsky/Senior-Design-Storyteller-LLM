__NOTOC__
The Ithal Bridge was a large and ancient bridge over the River Ith at the exact center of the city of Darromar&mdashformerly Ithmong&mdashon the Ithal Road (or Star Street). It was constructed by dwarves during the kingdom of Shanatar.
The bridge was four wagons wide and was the only safe means of crossing the River Ith for hundreds of miles.
When Ernest Gallowglass came to power, he established a heavy a heavy toll for crossing the bridge. In 1367 DR, after the deposition of Gallowglass, Zaranda Star tried to negotiate with the city council of Ithmong to remove the toll and thus encourage trade.
By 1370 DR, the toll for crossing the bridge was one donsar per cart or two donsar per wagon.
