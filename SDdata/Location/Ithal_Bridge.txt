The '''Ithal Bridge''' was a large and ancient bridge over the [[River Ith]] at the exact center of the city of [[Darromar]]&mdash;formerly Ithmong&mdash;on the [[Ithal Road]] (or Star Street). It was constructed by dwarves during the kingdom of [[Shanatar]].<ref name=LoI1:T-p85/>

The bridge was four wagons wide and was the only safe means of crossing the River Ith for hundreds of miles.<ref name=LoI1:T-p85/>

When [[Ernest Gallowglass]] came to power, he established a heavy a heavy toll for crossing the bridge. In [[1367 DR]], after the deposition of Gallowglass, [[Zaranda Star]] tried to negotiate with the city council of Ithmong to remove the toll and thus encourage trade.

By [[1370 DR]], the toll for crossing the bridge was one ''[[Currency#Copper|donsar]]'' per cart or two ''donsar'' per wagon.<ref name=LoI1:T-p85/>
