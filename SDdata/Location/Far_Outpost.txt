The Far Outpost was a large village and trading hub found on the very tip of the entrance to the Bay of Dancing Dolphins in Dambrath.
The garrison of the Far Outpost was charged with defending the Bay of Dancing Dolphins from any attackers. All ships entering the bay were boarded and searched, but traders and merchants were allowed to go on their way without harm. All confiscated goods or riches were sent to Luenath.
A fighting force of 500 cavalry and 20 warships were stationed at the Far Outpost. Each warship carried a potent spellcaster who was typically used to question the captains of ship entering the Bay.
