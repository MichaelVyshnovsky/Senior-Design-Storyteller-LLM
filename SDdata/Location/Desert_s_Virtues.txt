The Deserts Virtues was a group of islands in the Great Sea west of the Genies Turban.
The Deserts Virtues consisted of three small main islands the Camels Hump, the Chador and the Dune.  The Camels Hump and the Chador both had small villages scattered near their coves.  These were usually ruled by former corsair Captains. Rumors abounded that some corsairs kept secret stashes of gold and treasure hidden on these islands.
This island received its name from the lone elevation that formed a gradual peak resembling a camels hump.
Two elevations that looked like eyeholes in a moralists robe served as inspiration for naming this island.
Composed completely of sand, this island often served for marooning those who displeased the Captains.  Because of this it was also known as Solitude or the Isle of Exile.
