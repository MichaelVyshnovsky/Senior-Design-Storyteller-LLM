It laid atop a volcanic plug that dominated the surrounding lands. Durlag Trollkiller, aided by hired dwarves, was said to have hollowed out the mountain for the rock that made up his tower and used the space created to hide further treasure.\nThis local landmark was the isolated keep of Durlag Trollkiller, son of Bolhur the Clanless, a dwarven hero said to have amassed a large quantity of treasure and stored it here and in a few other locations. This treasure was protected by all manner of magical wards and mechanical traps, the latter of Durlags own devising. \nMany adventurers sought his treasure over the decades, with varying degrees of success. Around 1372 DR, rumors said a fiend had taken up residence within the remains of the tower and used the defenses created by Durlag to keep both itself and the treasure safe.\n*Durlag Trollkiller, a powerful dwarf and the proprietor of the tower.\n*Islanne, a dwarven adventurer and Durlags wife.\n*Kiel \"The Legion Killer\", Durlags elder son.\n*Fuernebol, Durlags younger son.\n*Bullrush, a hobgoblin archer who became petrified in the tower and was possibly later freed by Abdel Adrian.\n*Hack, an ogre who became petrified in the tower and was possibly later freed by Abdel Adrian.\n*Kirinhale, a succubus imprisoned by Durlag in his tower.\n*Meiala, a sirine adventurer who became petrified in the tower and was possibly later freed by Abdel Adrian.\n*Moorlock, a human warrior who became petrified in the tower and was possibly later freed by Abdel Adrian.\n*Tarnor, a dwarven fighter who became petrified in the tower and was possibly later freed by Abdel Adrian."
