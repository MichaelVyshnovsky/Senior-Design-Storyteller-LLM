        "mainbody": "The so-called '''Cities of the Ancients''' covered jungle-filled '''East [[Zakhara]]''', an area left vacant by the ruin of former empires. The influence of [[Huzuz]], [[Afyal]] and the [[Cities of the Pantheon|League of the Pantheon]] on the local rulers was strong, but so was that of their savage history.",
        "Geography": "For centuries past, this region of mighty river valleys, forests, and desert was home to the kingdoms of [[Nog]] and [[Kadar]]. All that remained from those ancient civilizations were crumbling ruins, tombs of forgotten rulers, and temples of lost gods. Their legacy was strong enough, however, that the whole region was also called the '''Ruined Kingdoms'''. In this vast, relatively unexplored, and very wild corner of mainland [[Zakhara]], three major cities were found, all in the southeastern quarter - [[Rog'osto]], [[Kadarasto]], and [[Dihliz]] (the only one not built on the ruins of old capitals).\n\nThe large islands of [[Sahu]] - influenced by Kadar and the ancient followers of [[Thasmudyan]] - and Afyal - each featuring a lost civilization of its own - were considered both part of the Ruined Kingdoms and [[Crowded Sea]] regions.<ref><ref>\n\nEast Zakhara is enclosed by the [[Haunted Lands]] in the North and West, the [[Foreigners' Sea]] in the North and East, the Crowded Sea, specifically the islands of [[Bariya]] and [[Harab]], in the South, and the [[Cities of the Pantheon]] in the West, where [[Al-Sayaj Mountains]] form a natural barrier.<ref>",
        "Inhabitants": "Most of the population in this region descended from the scattered tribes that dominated the jungles, though many foreigners also lived here. Natives of the region were tall and muscular, perhaps due to the [[Jungle giant|giant's]] blood mixed with their lineage, if the claims could be believed. Most natives were proud and xenophobic. They were often considered poor compared to the standards of the rest of [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]] Zakhara.",
