'''Sambral''' was one of the [[Windrise Ports]] of [[Laerakond]]. It was built on the [[Bay of Pearls]] and was the last port before leaving the continent to cross the [[Trackless Sea]] to [[Faerûn]].

Sambral was the closest of the Windrise Ports to [[Daggertooth Isle]].

==Description==
Sambral was known for its pearl industry, its perfumes, and its skilled blademasters, known locally as "bravos". The bravos were skilled duelists renowned for their florid speech and creative insults. A bravo led a group of like-minded individuals known as "troupes". The troupes doubled as a police force, but usually expended their time feuding with each other, attempting to gain prestige.

The Sambrese loved scents as a way to stave off the stench of spoiled seafood and to give homage to the power of [[air]]. Perfumes, potpourri, and incense were common features in homes and businesses. Sambrese also admired fashion and their styles changed frequently. Both men and women used cosmetics, elaborate hair styles, and dramatic clothing.

==Government==
Sambral was ruled by the Twelve Lords, an oligarchic council composed by the merchant houses of the city, such as [[House Mecatoris]]. The Twelve appointed the Grand Marshal, who was in charge of the defense of Sambral, and the Grand Admiral who was in charge of the navy.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|8}}

Many people suspected that most members of the Twelve were part of the [[Seekers of Scales]].

==Defenses==
Besides the bravo troupes, Sambral was protected by the [[Sentinels]].

==Economy==
Luxury items such as perfumes, ornate jewelry, and ostentatious clothing were the major local exports.

==Architecture==
Sambral was laid out in terraces called "rises" by its inhabitants, with streets paved with crushed oyster shells. The terraces were connected to each other by a series of stairs. Because of that, carts were of little use in Sambral, and the people instead used [[rope]]s or [[mule]]s to move goods across the city. The city's fortress, the [[Pearl Citadel]], was famous across the Windrise Ports for its soaring Nacre Tower.

===Layout===
; The [[Sambral/Bayside|Bayside]]: The Bayside was the second largest district of the city.
; The [[First Rise]]: The dwarven district.
; The [[Second Rise]]: The smallest district.
; The [[High Rise]]: The largest and most diverse district in Sambral.

==Culture==
===Religion===
Religion was uncommon in Sambral, like in the rest of the Windrise Ports, and the following of minor cults dedicated to the [[Dawn Titans]] or to [[dragon]]s, as well as general superstition, were more universal than worshiping the [[gods]], which were a novelty introduced in [[Laerakond]] since the [[Blue Breath of Change]].

However, thanks to their cosmopolitan nature and their trade with Faerûn, the cities of the Windrise Ports were more open to the concepts of religion and the gods than other places of Laerakond. The most popular gods in Sambral were [[Sune]], [[Tempus]], [[Umberlee]], and [[Valkur]], but other influential religions established in the Windrise Ports were the faiths of [[Bahamut]],  [[Tiamat]], [[Vergadain]], and [[Waukeen]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Building the Pyre|41}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|52}}

==Inhabitants==
Sambral's population was mostly made up by [[human]]s, with a significant population of [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]], [[dwarves]], [[dragonborn]], and [[tiefling]]s.{{Cite dragon/376/Tarmalune and the Windrise Ports|49}}
