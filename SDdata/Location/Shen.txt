'''Shen''' was a small [[orc]] village, home of the [[White Hand clan]], located in the [[Vilhon Reach]] part of the [[Winterwood]].

==Description==
The village of Shen consisted of approximately 250 orcs of the White Hand clan ''circa'' [[1370 DR]]. The settlement stood four miles north of the [[Wintercloak River]] and was locked in a conflict with [[vegepygmies]] that dwelled south of the river. The war raged in the forest in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]] and made it a dangerous travel destination.
