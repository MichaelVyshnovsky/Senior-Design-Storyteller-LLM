        "mainbody": "The Royal Gate was the entrance to the Grand Caliphs private apartments within the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThe Royal Gate was constructed of polished stone but, due to a powerful enchantment, could open like a curtain for approaching visitors.\nThe Grand Caliphs most valued guests used this gate when meeting with their leader. Contingents of the Honored and the Dutiful guarded the entrance. The mamluks were aided by a pair of mages who rode flying carpets and wielded wands."
