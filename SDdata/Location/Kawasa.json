        "mainbody": "Kawasa was a tiny farming community and one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa.\nThe people of Kawasa were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.\nThe village was surrounded by small rice fields. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka, built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops. Several of the minka were abandoned after raids on the village.\nThe little thorp had a population of only about 75 individuals after .\nKawasa was located on the coast of the Sea of Patience, where the Fochu Peninsula joined the mainland of Tsukishima. A trail led from the village west to Chiroi.\nLike the other tiny settlements of the region, Kawasa had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The people produced rice, but there is no evidence that they traded in it.\nThe people would allow travelers to spend the night in one of the abandoned minkas for free. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 yuan to sell.\nAbout 8 citizens of Kawasa served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears.\nUnlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Kawasa were not particularly religious.\nSetsu Iki, a powerful wu jen, did not live in the village itself but kept a small home in the middle of a peach grove in a shallow valley some  east of Kawasa.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Kawasa suffered especially severely from Za-Jikkus raids."
