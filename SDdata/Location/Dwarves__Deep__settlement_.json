        "mainbody": "'''Dwarves' Deep''', or simply '''\"the Deep\"''', was a subterranean [[dwarf|dwarven]] realm somewhere in the [[Underdark]] beneath [[Faer√ªn]], far distant from the [[Dalelands]]. It lay along the [[Long Road (Underdark)|Long Road]], a thousands-of-miles-long tunnel under the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].<ref group=\"note\">The exact location of Dwarves' Deep is unknown. Although it shares a name with the sourcebook ''[[Dwarves Deep]]'', it is not mentioned there. ''[[Volo's Guide to the Dalelands]]'', page 192, has the dwarves of Glen trade with Dwarves' Deep via the Long Road, but the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'', page 135, has them trade with the Great Rift, also via the Long Road. This change suggests Dwarves Deep is or is a part of the Great Rift, or else that trade had been extended from Dwarves' Deep to the Great Rift.\n\n''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], the dwarves of [[Glen]] in [[Mistledale]] traded their produce to Dwarves' Deep via the Long Road, as well as to the [[Great Rift]] and other dwarf settlements on the route.\n\nIt was once home to Forgemaster [[Inkstain]] and his kin, before he left for the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]]. He organized for a [[printing press]] to be shipped up from the Deep, which he used for a printing business he ran in the city by [[1362 DR]]."
