        "mainbody": "Dwarves Deep, or simply \"the Deep\", was a subterranean dwarven realm somewhere in the Underdark beneath Faer√ªn, far distant from the Dalelands. It lay along the Long Road, a thousands-of-miles-long tunnel under the Sea of Fallen Stars.The exact location of Dwarves Deep is unknown. Although it shares a name with the sourcebook Dwarves Deep, it is not mentioned there. Volos Guide to the Dalelands, page 192, has the dwarves of Glen trade with Dwarves Deep via the Long Road, but the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition, page 135, has them trade with the Great Rift, also via the Long Road. This change suggests Dwarves Deep is or is a part of the Great Rift, or else that trade had been extended from Dwarves Deep to the Great Rift.\nCirca 1370 DR, the dwarves of Glen in Mistledale traded their produce to Dwarves Deep via the Long Road, as well as to the Great Rift and other dwarf settlements on the route.\nIt was once home to Forgemaster Inkstain and his kin, before he left for the city of Procampur in the Vast. He organized for a printing press to be shipped up from the Deep, which he used for a printing business he ran in the city by 1362 DR."
