        "Geography": "Cimbar was a port city on the eastern side of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].",
        "Description": "Cimbar was known as a city of philosophy and art. Even its slaves were literate, and it required participation in the arts from its citizens. It had colleges for both sages and artists.\n\nThe streets of Cimbar were beautiful and clean. It was divided into two halves, Old Cimbar and New Cimbar. Old Cimbar contained the [[Palace of the Sceptanar]] and the [[University (Cimbar)|University]]. New Cimbar had the largest port in the region and many homes and shops, as well as theaters, a hippodrome, and an arena.\n\nBy 1359, the city contained both a Temple of [[Tempus]] and a small temple of the [[Red Knight]].{{Cite web|url = http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mb/20040915a|title = Master Tactician: Spells from the Church of the Red Knight|accessmonthday = June 20|accessyear = 2018|last = Reynolds|authorlink = Sean K. Reynolds|first = Sean K.}}",
        "Government": "Cimbar was ruled by a leader called a [[Sceptanar]], who was usually a [[wizard]]. The ruler had absolute authority but was advised by a senate, which was elected by land-owning males.",
        "Defenses": "Cimbar's navy was second in size only to the navy of [[Thay]] when compared to other fleets of the Inner Sea.\n\nThe armed forces of Cimbar numbered 15,000 persons total in [[1357 DR]]. Of these, 100 were mounted air cavalry, riding [[griffon]]s; 100 were artillery [[mage]]s; 1,300 were marines; 9,000 were infantry; and 2,500 were regular cavalry. In addition to the official soldiers, about six different mercenary companies were in the city as well.",
        "History": "Old Cimbar was founded as a port by the people of [[Unther]] 500 years before the founding of [[Cormyr]].\n\nIn [[902 DR]], when the [[red dragon]] [[Tchazzar]], in [[human]] disguise, united the city-states of Chessenta, he made Cimbar his capital.\n\nIn [[1154 DR]], Cimbar was put to siege by the city-states of [[Akanax]] and [[Soorenar]].\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], riots and panic broke out in the city. [[Nicos Nathos]] came out of retirement to help deal with these events but died from the exertion. He was named a War Hero of Chessenta for his actions.\n\nIn the late half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[shadow adept]] [[Aeron Morieth]] deposed the previous Sceptanar and ruled the city for several months. After this short time, he appointed a woman named [[Melisanda]] from [[Arrabar]] to succeed him.\n\nTchazzar returned in [[1373 DR]], now in the form of a dragon, and took control of the city once again.",
