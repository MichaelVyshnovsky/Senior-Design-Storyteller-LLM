Good Mead was one of the smaller of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
Two roads extended out from Good Mead, one that went southwest to Dougans Hole and another one northeast to Easthaven.
While Good Meads economy was originally based on the fishing of knucklehead trout from nearby Redwaters lake, by the mid-14 century DR they received little profit from
their catches. As a whole, the town focused on brewing their famous mead, that they sold in the merchant town of Bryn Shander.
For many years, Good Mead and Dougans Hole enjoyed a healthy rivalry with each other.
