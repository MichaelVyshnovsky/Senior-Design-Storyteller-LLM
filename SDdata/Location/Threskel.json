        "mainbody": "Threskel, also known as the Land of the Bone Wyrm, was an impoverished kingdom and one of the Old Empires of east Faer√ªn. It was famously ruled over by powerful and evil dragons, each of which engaged in their political struggles with one another, giving little if any regard to the people under their dominion.\nThe scattered cities of Threskel were dotted among arid lands that were too often poorly suited for farming. Its people lived hard lives that were not made better by the constant struggles that sprang up between their draconic overlords.\nThe climate of Threskel was made worse throughout the 15 century due to the billowing volcanic smoke that spewed forth from the great volcano in the realms northern lands.\nThreskel was situated along the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars, north of Chessenta and Unther,\nFor most of its history, Threskel was a sparsely populated land that comprised wind-buffeted valleys, low-set plains, and harsh stonelands. with the Long Beach across the shores eastern side, along the Sea of Fallen Stars and northern Alamber Sea. The peninsula of Watchers Cape lay in the northwest of Threskel, extending out into the sea.\nAfter the change of Threskels landscape, a small body of water called the Jade Pond formed south of the plateau.\nThreskels most famous landmark was Mount Thulbane, the realms highest peak and an active volcano that continuously filled the nations skies with smoke and ash after years of inactivity. The Fields of Pryollus lay at the base of the mountain, separating it from the Dragonback Mountains.\nThe Riders to the Sky was a range of hills and mountains that wrapped along the eastern side of Threskel. Its northern-most peak was Dragonback Mountain, the dormant volcano that housed the lair of the Great Bone Wyrm. The Barren River, that formed over the previous Jade River, flowed westward from Threskels plateau before emptying into the Bay of Chessenta,\nThe lands of Threskel gave way to scattered verdant vegetation.\nThroughout the late 14 and 15 centuries, dragons reigned over Threskel, most notable among them Alasklerbanbastos, the Great Bone Wyrm. He was served by the vampiric Jaxanaedegor, self-proclaimed Viceroy of Threskel.\nWhile the people of Threskel, especially those in the capital of Mourktar, considered themselves to be an independent nation, foreign beliefs held that it was a part of greater Chessenta.\nWhile there was no overall culture for entirety of Threskel. the people of its cities borrowed features and attitudes from their neighboring lands. For example, those from Mordulkin shared a similar attitude with those from Chessenta while people from Mourktar and the eastern region were more alike with the Untheric peoples.\nAs with the other lands of the Old Empires, the Turami people were considered something of lower-class citizens in Threskel.\nSome people in Threskel managed to make a living farming crops or more commonly by herding domesticated animals. They then sent their goods off for trade in the port cities of Mourktar and Mordulkin.\nSome years after the death of Tchazzar at the hands of Gilgeam during the Time of Troubles, the dracolich Alasklerbanbastos saw his opportunity to seize power within the region. In the , the Great Bone Wyrm claimed dominion over all of Threskel, and bequeathed each of its cities to his chromatic dragon followers as vassal-states.\nOver a decade later, the chosen of Tiamat Rauthstokh sought to claim Threskel in the name of the Dragon Queen. Despite this, Alasklerbanbastos control over the nation remained strong and defiant against usurpers. The greater threat to Threskel and its undead ruler came in the form of the restored Tchazzar, who returned to the realms as a mortal in the  during the Rage of Dragons. The great red wyrm laid his claim over Threskel and fought to restore his dominion over the region. Fortunately, the Great Bone Wyrms rule was bolstered in the , when it was supported by the church of Bane and the nation of Thay, their valuable trade partner across the sea.\nMount Thulbane erupted some time during the 15 century DR, covering the skies over Threskel in smoke and black ash.\nIn the , the resurrected Tchazzar rallied his army to defeat Alasklerbanbastos, subjugating Threskel as a vassal state of Chessenta. During that time the \"Threskel frontier\" as it was called became rampant with bandit activity and roaming bands of monstrous creatures.\nSettlements\n* Mordulkin, the wealthy magocratic metropolis governed by the spellcasters of House Jedea.\n* Mourktar, an influential trading port city situated along the northeastern coast.\n* Thamor, a small trading mercantile settlement found in the central plains of Threskel.\nThe coastal lands of Threskel were home to quite a few number of water genasi."
