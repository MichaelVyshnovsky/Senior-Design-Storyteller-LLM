The '''Caravan Quarter''' of [[Daggerford]] was the area in town that catered to merchants, traders, and other travelers that passed by during their journeys along the [[Trade Way]].

==Geography==
The quarter was located on the west side of town, north of the market. The closest entrance from outside the town's walls was the Caravan Gate.{{DagLoc}}

==Trade==
With the large number of traders that passed through and many guildhalls, the Caravan Quarter was the site for commerce in Daggerford.

==Notable Locations==
;Businesses:
* [[Decorated Man]]: The [[illusionist]] [[Ballick]] was the proprietor of this tailor's shop.
* [[Derf's Skin Art]]: While the artists within this shop primarily offered tattoos to their clientele, they also experimented in piercings and decorative scarring.
* [[Miller's Dry Goods]]: This shop was run by the incomparable [[Bess Miller]], who owned three successful mills in the surrounding lands.
* [[Oleg's Weaponforge]]: While he was quite skilled at his craft, the [[half-orc]] [[Oleg]] was often the subject of the town's scorn and ridicule.

{{Former}}
* [[Cromach's Smithy]]: While it was later relocated to the Money Quarter, the smithy was originally founded by [[Cromach]] within the Caravan Quarter.
* [[Oryv's Cloth Emporium]]: The cunning merchant [[Oryv]] offered a wide variety of fabrics, both locally and foreign-made.
* [[Yarth Stowage]]: This massive warehouse was considered to be among the most secure locations within which someone could store their goods.

;Halls:
* [[Fences' Syndicate]]: While it was loosely considered a true guild, this group of ne'er-do-wells facilitated Daggerford's black market.
* [[Leatherworkers' Conglomerate]]: All the leather workers from the area surrounding Daggerford could gather here alongside their fellow craftsmen.
* [[Physicians' Order]]: The guildhall of the town's apothecaries and healers functioned as a hospital of sorts.
* [[Scribes' Friendship]]: Daggerfordian scribes gathered within this building when they were not busy gathering works from [[Kryptgarden Scrolls]].
* [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]]: This organization regulated and guided the [[arcane]] [[spellcaster]]s that took up residence in town.
* [[Tailors' Federation]]: Although the tailor's guild was rather poor, its guildmaster was skilled enough to attract the business of the affluent and noble alike.
* [[Tanners' Council]]: Before a dedicated tannery was built outside of town, the tanners of Daggerford used their guildhall to ply their craft.
* [[Taverners' Confederation]]: All of the town's barkeeps, tavern servers, and owners were members of this guild.
* [[Thinkers' Fraternity]]: This organization was a collective of scholars and theorists that gathered together to share new ideas with one another.

;Inns and Taverns:
* [[Lady Luck Tavern]]: While it was formerly situated in the [[Money Quarter]], the tavern was relocated to much larger building that once housed the [[Daggerford Inn]].

{{Former}} 
* [[Daggerford Inn]]: This dirty inn offered little else beyond fairly restful accommodations.

;Places of Worship:
* [[Fairfortune Hall]]: Although it served Daggerford for many years, this [[Tymora]]n shrine never attracted enough followers to justify the creation of an actual temple building.

==Inhabitants==
While many of the folks staying in the Caravan Quarter were merely staying in town for a short time, it did house a significant portion of Daggerford's residents. Its always served as the home for [[halfling]]s and [[dwarves]], particularly those with no relation to the town's more affluent families.

;14{{th}} Century:
* [[Bohle]], the knowledgeable and stealthy [[half-elf]] [[thief]]
* [[Emser]], the enigmatic [[gnome]] of whom little was actually known
* [[Garrick (Daggerford)|Garrick]], a Tymoran priest that separated from the Daggerfordian branch
* [[Ines]], who was rather loud and bumbling for someone with an illicit background
* [[Quarenghi]], the leader of a cult devoted to the [[overgod]] [[Ao]]
* [[Youatt]], a local veterinary healer
