The Caravan Quarter of Daggerford was the area in town that catered to merchants, traders, and other travelers that passed by during their journeys along the Trade Way.
The quarter was located on the west side of town, north of the market. The closest entrance from outside the towns walls was the Caravan Gate.
With the large number of traders that passed through and many guildhalls, the Caravan Quarter was the site for commerce in Daggerford.
Businesses

* Millers Dry Goods This shop was run by the incomparable Bess Miller, who owned three successful mills in the surrounding lands.

Halls
* Fences Syndicate While it was loosely considered a true guild, this group of neer-do-wells facilitated Daggerfords black market.
* Leatherworkers Conglomerate All the leather workers from the area surrounding Daggerford could gather here alongside their fellow craftsmen.
* Physicians Order The guildhall of the towns apothecaries and healers functioned as a hospital of sorts.
* Scribes Friendship Daggerfordian scribes gathered within this building when they were not busy gathering works from Kryptgarden Scrolls.
* Sorcellers Encapsulate This organization regulated and guided the arcane spellcasters that took up residence in town.
* Tailors Federation Although the tailors guild was rather poor, its guildmaster was skilled enough to attract the business of the affluent and noble alike.
* Tanners Council Before a dedicated tannery was built outside of town, the tanners of Daggerford used their guildhall to ply their craft.
* Taverners Confederation All of the towns barkeeps, tavern servers, and owners were members of this guild.
* Thinkers Fraternity This organization was a collective of scholars and theorists that gathered together to share new ideas with one another.
Inns and Taverns
* Lady Luck Tavern While it was formerly situated in the Money Quarter, the tavern was relocated to much larger building that once housed the Daggerford Inn.
* Daggerford Inn This dirty inn offered little else beyond fairly restful accommodations.
Places of Worship
* Fairfortune Hall Although it served Daggerford for many years, this Tymoran shrine never attracted enough followers to justify the creation of an actual temple building.
While many of the folks staying in the Caravan Quarter were merely staying in town for a short time, it did house a significant portion of Daggerfords residents. Its always served as the home for halflings and dwarves, particularly those with no relation to the towns more affluent families.
