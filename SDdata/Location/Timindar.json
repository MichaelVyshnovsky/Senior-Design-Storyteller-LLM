        "mainbody": "'''Timindar''' was a small frontier town in [[Chondath]], built as a logging operation on the edge of [[Satyrwood]].",
        "Description": "Timindar never got an opportunity to grow as it was razed only seven years after being established. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Timindar was nothing but a lonely ruin at the edge of the forest that stood along the [[Old Road (Vilhon Reach)|Old Road]], that stretched from [[Shamph]] to [[Elbulder]] and continued further south. Several stone structures still stood in the long-looted ruins, which saw very few visitors besides the most desperate of [[adventurer]]s. Those who did visit the town told stories of [[ghost]]s wandering the ruins.",
        "History": "The towns of Timindar and [[Orbech]] were established in the {{YearlinkName|260}} by decree of the ruling [[Illistine]] family. Timindar conducted greedy and ambitious logging in Chondalwood to the ire of [[Ariton Maliwick]], the Grand Druid of [[Gulthmere]]. A stern warning was issued to Chondath but Timindar's logging continued until the [[Battle of Fallen Trees]] of the {{YearlinkName|267}}. Timindar and Orbech were destroyed in the battle by the [[elves]] of Satyrwood while survivors fled to Shamph. The Battle of Fallen Trees was a retaliation and another warning to deter humans from encroaching on the elven homelands."
