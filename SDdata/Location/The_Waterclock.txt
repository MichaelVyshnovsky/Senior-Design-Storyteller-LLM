'''The Waterclock''' was a landmark in the [[Skullport/Central Trade Lanes|Central Trade Lanes]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The Waterclock provided a precise means of tracking time within the perpetual gloom of the [[Underdark]]. Suspended from a massive stalactite in the main cavern, the Waterclock was positioned between the Central and [[Lower Trade Lanes]].

The clock not only kept track of highsun, midnight, dawn, and dusk but also displays the months, the three [[tenday]]s in each month, and the various holidays celebrated in the realm.

Maintaining the Waterclock's precise functionality required constant vigilance and upkeep. The moisture-rich air and the generally unfavorable conditions in Skullport necessitated frequent oiling, adjusting, and replacing of delicate parts and balances. Additionally, the springs were prone to stretching and wear, and the reservoirs had to be refilled on a regular basis. To ensure the clock's uninterrupted operation, [[priest]]s of [[Gond]] worked in rotating shifts.

==Defenses==
To safeguard the Waterclock, its creators incorporated numerous defensive mechanisms. Tampering with the Waterclock, whether physically or magically, had dire consequences. Intruders risked severed limbs, electrocution, or volleys of [[dart]]s from hidden mechanisms. In addition, hostile [[spell]]s directed at the clock had a chance of reflecting back upon the caster. The device was further protected due to its enhanced durability. It was also immune to ''[[disintegrate]]''. Any disturbance around the Waterclock was likely to draw the attention of the [[Skulls of Skullport]], further discouraging interference.

==History==
The Waterclock was designed and constructed by three [[Gondsmen]] in collaboration with the [[gnome]]s [[Tykkyl Burrwarden|Tykkyl]] and [[Tohkkal Burrwarden]]. The project was headed by Master [[Karl Gustavis Gearwizzen]], a [[human]] [[cleric]] of Gond and a seasoned engineer. The Waterclock was conceived in [[1369 DR]] in the aftermath of [[Halaster's Higharvestide]].
