In [[1264 DR]], thieves stole the ''[[Shield of Silvam]]'' and the ''[[Royal Masque Blades]]'' from the tombs.",
        "Description": "Centuries after the fighting, by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], bones still littered the field and cairns of the dead were everywhere. Now used for farming and ranching, plows occasionally turned up skeletons in rusting armor, weapons, and other detritus."
