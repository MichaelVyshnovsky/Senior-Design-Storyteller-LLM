'''Maraeda''' was a location somewhere near [[Moonshorn Tower]].In the novel, Tabarast says only "The Well of the Bonedance in Maraeda's run dry!" It is unclear if the apostrophe-s indicates a contraction of 'has' ("in Maraeda has run dry") or a possessive and if there is another word that is being neglected, such as "Maraeda's Pass". Given names like [[Maraedra]] and [[Maraeda Halfeather]] it may be a feminine given name. In the absence of more information, this article is written under Maraeda.

==Description==
There was a well at Maraeda, known as [[Gullet Well]], or the Well of the Bonedance.

==History==
The Gullet Well at Maraeda ran dry in the {{yearlinkName|761}}, which led to the death of many a [[horse]]. The sage [[Tabarast]] of [[Moonshorn Tower]] reported that this had been taken as a divine sign.
