        "mainbody": "arsith was a port city and a member of the confederation of the Dusk Ports in Laerakond. It was also one of the most important fishing cities in the region.\nTarsith was located in the Esmur Flats, in the shore of the River Esmur near the mouth where the river flowed to the Dragon Sea.\nTarsith was the most calm and peaceful city of the Dusk Ports. However, this situation wasnt always the same, and usually the population had to endure hard times when the green dragon Orlarrakh invited a fellow from Melabrauth to eat.\nAside from foodstuffs, Tarsith also boasted the finest ropes and sails in all Laerakond, although such products were not for sale.\nTarsith was ruled by a Tarsandar, a wizard who received his or her scepter from the Green Duchess herself.\nDue to its location in the River Esmur, Tarsith was known as the busiest fishing center of Laerakond. Most of the eels and clams were consumed locally, but the rock crabs and fish were Tarsiths major exports.\n* Rhauron, a notorious individual who lived in Tarsith in the 1480s DR."
