Onguls Water was a small community in a wooded valley just northwest of Hermits Wood.
Onguls Water was named for a small lake that was filled by a spring that rose there. The lake drained westward into Starwater River near a small forested island known as Hunters Isle.
The only significant industry in Onguls Water was a gristmill run by Durkin, a descendant of the namesake founder Ongul.
The people of Onguls Water primarily grew vegetables and raised ducks. Some of the braver ones hunted game in Hermits Wood, or hired themselves out as guides to visitors despite the fact that the "guides" actually knew very little about the forest itself.
