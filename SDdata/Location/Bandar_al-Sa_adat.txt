'''Bandar al-Sa'adat''' was a town located on the isle of [[Masud Jazayir]] in the [[Nada al-Hazan]] archipelago within the [[Crowded Sea]] south of mainland [[Zakhara]].

==Organization==
The town could field a militia of 100 soldiers who were adept at defending against pirate raids. Several wizards offered magical assistance to the militia in times of need.

==Activities ==
Sea trade was a major source of income for the town and also caused its population to fluctuate.

==Inhabitants==
This town was ruled by [[Mahmud Ben Aziz]]. His brother [[Karim Ben Aziz]] was captain of the marketplace guards. Much of Ben Aziz's family held other positions of note within the small town.

Masudi islanders had a love of words, opting to speak in colorful ways to alleviate boredom. Outsiders to the island often stuck out just because of the way they spoke.
