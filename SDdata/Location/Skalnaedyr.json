Merchants from here did business in Medinat Muskawoon in that citys heyday before around 300 DR.\nCirca 1359 DR, the poorer citizens of Phannaskul grew restless and from their number emerged a leader, Hatim the Righteous. He denounced the corruption and wickedness of Murghômi nobility and showed he was able to rouse a mob. The merchant houses of the city grew concerned and sought a way to resolve this issue.\nA plague among the metallic dragons of the Copper Mountains in the , caused many dragons to flee the region. One blue dragon, Skalnaedyr, stopped to rest and to eat in Phannaskul, now a small village. But to protect his people, the ataman of Phannaskul pledged fealty to the surprised dragon, who agreed to rule the village, becoming the first dragon prince of Murghôm. The ataman even changed the settlements name to honor the dragon. Skalnaedyrs new position encouraged the dragons who followed him to also seize control of other settlements in the area.\nThanks to Skalnaedyrs enlightened rule (for a dragon), the small village grew into a city over some seventy years.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, Tarman the Old was emir of Phannaskul, but he had little interest in administration and in his near-senility dwelled only on the glory days of his youth. Instead, the merchant guilds dominated the city and kept local officials content and out of their business through bribes and favours. These guilds were largely controlled by traders from Mulhorand and Semphar, which did not which to see Phannaskul achieve any kind of power.\nIn the 15 century DR, the city was ruled by the elder blue dragon Skalnaedyr. Unlike most other dragon princes of Murghôm at the time, he showed some respect to his human subjects and allowed them a degree of freedom. Skalnaedyr was rarely seen and his vizier Merwena spoke on his behalf and handled the day-to-day operations of the government circa 1479 DR.\nPhannaskuls position on the Rauthenflow meant it could potentially control all trade on the river, but the weakness of the Murghômi king Tharmakkas IV and the strength of foreign influence in the land prevented this from happening in the mid-1300s DR.\nIn the mid–1300s, Phannaskul was an unhappy place, with little laughter or joy nor even a blue sky to brighten the day.\nCirca 1479 DR, the Cult of the Dragon operated openly and actively in Skalnaedyr from the Dragon House. They did not preach the faiths more extreme doctrine, keeping a secret for the most zealous members of the cult, those with years of experience and dedication. They were linked to the Dragon Cult in the Tower of the Talon, which stood by the Plains of Purple Dust.\nPhannaskul of the mid-1300s DR was an ugly place of squat, boring buildings that huddled in the shadow of the emirs keep, which loomed larger on the river bank. The city was contained within a stone wall of slate-gray hue and grim, dour aspect, for which it was Phannaskul the Iron. The whole city lay beneath an ever-present shroud of thick smoke.\nAs the city had grown rapidly from a village, by 1479 DR it displayed many winding streets and a varied architecture. The more recent parts were those around Skalnaedyrs palace.\n* Emirs palace, which lay on the river bank\n* Skalnaedyrs palace\n* Dragon House headquarters of the Cult of the Dragon\n* Skalnaedyrs Tomb"
