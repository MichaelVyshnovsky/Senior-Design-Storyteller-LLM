        "Geography": "In lay on the north bank of the [[River Rauthenflow]] and at the end of a road from [[Delbyl]].<ref><ref>",
        "History": "It was known as an ancient and rich city. Merchants from here did business in [[Medinat Muskawoon]] in that city's heyday before around [[300 DR]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1359 DR]], the poorer citizens of Phannaskul grew restless and from their number emerged a leader, [[Hatim|Hatim the Righteous]]. He denounced the corruption and wickedness of Murghômi nobility and showed he was able to rouse a mob. The merchant houses of the city grew concerned and sought a way to resolve this issue.\n\nA [[disease|plague]] among the [[metallic dragon]]s of the [[Copper Mountains]] in the {{YearlinkName|1409}}, caused many [[dragon]]s to flee the region. One blue dragon, Skalnaedyr, stopped to rest and to eat in Phannaskul, now a small village. But to protect his people, the ataman of Phannaskul pledged fealty to the surprised dragon, who agreed to rule the village, becoming the first dragon prince of Murghôm. The ataman even changed the settlement's name to honor the dragon. Skalnaedyr's new position encouraged the dragons who followed him to also seize control of other settlements in the area.\n\nThanks to Skalnaedyr's enlightened rule (for a dragon), the small village grew into a city over some seventy years.",
        "Government": "In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Tarman|Tarman the Old]] was emir of Phannaskul, but he had little interest in administration and in his near-senility dwelled only on the glory days of his youth. Instead, the merchant guilds dominated the city and kept local officials content and out of their business through bribes and favours. These guilds were largely controlled by traders from [[Mulhorand]] and [[Semphar]], which did not which to see Phannaskul achieve any kind of power.\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century DR, the city was ruled by the elder [[blue dragon]] [[Skalnaedyr (dragon)|Skalnaedyr]]. Unlike most other dragon princes of Murghôm at the time, he showed some respect to his [[human]] subjects and allowed them a degree of freedom. Skalnaedyr was rarely seen and his vizier [[Merwena]] spoke on his behalf and handled the day-to-day operations of the government ''circa'' [[1479 DR]].",
        "Trade": "Phannaskul's position on the Rauthenflow meant it could potentially control all trade on the river, but the weakness of the Murghômi king [[Tharmakkas IV]] and the strength of foreign influence in the land prevented this from happening in the mid-1300s DR.",
        "Society": "In the mid–1300s, Phannaskul was an unhappy place, with little laughter or joy nor even a blue sky to brighten the day.\n\n''Circa'' 1479 DR, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] operated openly and actively in Skalnaedyr from the Dragon House. They did not preach the faith's more extreme doctrine, keeping a secret for the most zealous members of the cult, those with years of experience and dedication. They were linked to the Dragon Cult in the [[Tower of the Talon]], which stood by the [[Plains of Purple Dust]].",
