These included storms arriving without warning and lasting for days, goblins roaming the area in unusual numbers due to voices in their head drawing them to the area, and seemingly organized groups of giants moving through the pass.\nAround that year a band of adventurers lead by Hrothgar were ambushed  in the pass on their way to Kuldahar by a group of frost giants led by Kreg Frostbeard, under orders by the devil Belhifet to cause an avalanche. In conjunction with the magic of Crenshinibon, they managed to block off all access between Easthaven and Kuldahar.\n* Ghereg\n*Icewind Dale (game)\n*Icewind Dale II\n*\nCategoryValleys\nCategoryLocations in the Spine of the World\nCategoryLocations in Icewind Dale\nCategoryLocations in the Frozenfar\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\n7apfsndanqrkf0262fhqytd9jl2oh9s"
