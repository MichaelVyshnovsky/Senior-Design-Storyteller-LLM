'''Flask Circle''' was a small shopping district in the [[Anvil (neighborhood)|Anvil]] neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]], referred to by some as a "boutique district." It was originally a hidden cul-de-sac,{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|4}} but by late [[1370 DR]] it had opened up and gained direct ingresses from two streets.{{Cite interactive atlas}}<ref group="note" name="location">In the module ''Scavenger Hunt'' (1994) an exact location within the city is not given for Flask Circle and its shops. Out of the seven shops that were connected to Flask Circle, only Flora's Flower Shop and Healthier Living would reappear within ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'', wherein they were both detailed as being located in Anvil in the block of buildings formed by Black Visor Street and Blacktree Boulevard. Maps of Ravens Bluff published after ''Scavenger Hunt'' depict no such cul-de-sac behind this block of buildings. This could be explained as a cartographic error brought on by poor internal record keeping of Living City material, but alternatively, it could be explained as having been opened up following the buyout, demolition, and reconstruction of Flora's Flowers by the [[Ampner]] noble family.

==Description==
Paved in cobblestone, this cul-de-sacWhen the Flask Circle makes a reappearance in ''The Hands of Mohammad'' no such entry badge is discussed.

By 1370 DR, the cul-de-sac housing Flask Circle was opened up into a proper alleyway, with ingresses from Blacktree Boulevard South and Red Wyrm Ride.<ref group="note" name="location" />

==Notable Locations==
From counterclockwise, the shops that lined the Flask Circle were:
* Flora's Flower Shop was, as the name implied, a flower shop{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|3}} It was later bought out by the [[Ampner]]s, who demolished the building and in its place built a four-story apartment building that retained a flower shop on the ground floor.
* [[Healthier Living]], formerly the site of a laboratory that was run by the [[potion]] maker [[Wendell]], was an [[apothecary]] shop and clinic run by the [[cleric]] [[Maltornis|Sister Maltornis]].
* [[Material Assistance]], a shop that sold [[spell component]]s.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|6}}
* [[Modern Ointments]], a shop that sold a variety of aromatic [[oil]]s, [[candle]]s, [[incense]], and lotions.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|9}}
* [[Ollie's Discount Potions]], a store that specialized in the buying, selling, and bartering of a wide range of potions.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|5-6}}
* [[Practical Potions]], another store that specialized in selling potions. Its owner typically ran his prices alongside [[Ollie]] of Discount Potions to ensure that the two businesses minimized any arbitrage.{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|10}}
* [[Supreme Supplies]], a shop that sold all manner of [[alchemy]] supplies.
* Wendell's laboratory, a potion store that was shut down after its owner was kicked out of the market for having one too many accidents occur within.
* [[Winn's Ice House]], an icehouse business that later occupied the building that once housed Healthier Living.
