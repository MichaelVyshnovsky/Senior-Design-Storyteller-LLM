Thassalra was one of the cities of Thesk, a group of allied trade settlements on the western side of the great Golden Way.
Thassalra was built in the foothills of the Dragonjaw Mountains, along the road that stretched from the city of Telflamm, Culmaster, and ended in Milvarune. Thassalra was the first city stop along the road when traveling from Milvarune across the Dragonjaw Mountains.
