Fahhas, also called the City of Searching, was one of the major cities of the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara.
Fahhas was found in the northern half of the Pantheist League between Itiraf and Hilm along the banks of Al-Naqus River and the coast of the Golden Gulf.
The caliph of Fahhas in 1367 DR was Amel al-Yuhami. Though blessed with fertile grazing areas and fruit orchards around it, and rich clays for pottery in its river valley, the city was characterized by the brooding mood of its ruler and citizens. Their main motivation was said to be the search for spiritual betterment, so Fahhas was called "City of Searching".
Al-Naqus River provided Fahhas with rich clay to craft pottery and fine porcelain from. The porcelain was one of Fahhas prime exports.
The Sword of the True Gods maintained a force of 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Fahhas. Additionally, the city supported 2,000 guards, 150 clerics, and a trio of mamluk units from the Devoted Mamluk Society totaling 900 men.
Fahhas navy included five larger ships and ten smaller patrol vessels.
Given the caliphs dire mood since the death of his beloved vizier, Jamila al-Muhib, many natives of Fahhas feared for his health. Others wondered if the caliph should be replaced with a more reasonable leader.
