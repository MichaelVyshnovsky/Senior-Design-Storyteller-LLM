'''Caer-Konig''' ({{Pronounce|kair|_|KOH|nig|refs=}}) was one of the towns of [[Ten Towns]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
The town straddled the round harbor in a semicircle, with a line of buildings at the edge of the harbor, an uphill slope, and a circular round with buildings. 

==Geography==
Caer-Konig was located on the northern shore of [[Lac Dinneshere]], not far from [[Caer-Dineval]], behind the shadow of the imposing [[Kelvin's Cairn]].

The settlement was entirely isolated save for a trail to Caer-Dineval and a ferry that traversed the lake to [[Easthaven]].

==Defenses==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the town could muster a mere 27 militia members to its defense.

==History==
[[File:Caer-Konig 15th century DR.png|thumb|''Caer-Konig during the [[black ice]] crisis.''|380x380px]]
Caer-Konig originated as a mere camp, founded by a group of mountain-climbing travelers from the [[Moonsea]] region of [[north Faerûn|northern Faerûn]].

Sometime later, the castle of Caer-Konig was constructed, though it was destroyed shortly thereafter by a horde of [[orc]]s.

[[Dorim Lugar]] was the councilman of the town in 1351 DR until he was killed over a fish sometime before or during the {{YearlinkName|1356}}. and he held a particular grudge against Caer-Dineval.

After the war with [[Akar Kessell]] and the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]], Caer-Konig was given to the [[barbarian]]s. [[Revjak]], the king of the Tribe of the Elk, served as "speaker for the barbarians" in council until his leadership was successfully challenged by [[Berkthgar]] in 1364 DR, ending the period of cooperation between the Reghed tribes and Ten-Towns.

During the ''[[Everlasting Rime]]'', the folks of Caer-Konig made offerings of food to [[Auril]] the Frostmaiden. 

In the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the town suffered a number of thefts, perpetrated by [[duergar]]s led by [[Nildar Sunblight]].
