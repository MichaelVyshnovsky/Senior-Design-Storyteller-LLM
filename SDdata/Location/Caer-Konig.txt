Caer-Konig () was one of the towns of Ten Towns in Icewind Dale.
The town straddled the round harbor in a semicircle, with a line of buildings at the edge of the harbor, an uphill slope, and a circular round with buildings. 
Caer-Konig was located on the northern shore of Lac Dinneshere, not far from Caer-Dineval, behind the shadow of the imposing Kelvins Cairn.
The settlement was entirely isolated save for a trail to Caer-Dineval and a ferry that traversed the lake to Easthaven.
As of the late 15 century DR, the town could muster a mere 27 militia members to its defense.
