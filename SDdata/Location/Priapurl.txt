Priapurl () was a small town located on the Traders Road. 
As of 1372 DR, the ruler of Priapurl was Tar Hurara, who had descended from bandits but was often away from the town spending her time in the court of Cormyr.
In the , Priapurl became besieged by a one-orc army Slogg Ogrum. Slogg by his lonesome managed to almost bring the town to its knees if not for the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company, who eventually slew the threat. Disturbingly enough, no-one even uncovered the reason for the orcs attack. His impressive stash of powerful weapons was the only thing recovered from the siege, including the powerful crossbow â€“ Ogrums Siegebow.
