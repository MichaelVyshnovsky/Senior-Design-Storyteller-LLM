It would eventually have to contend with the encroaching Anauroch desert. \nIn the , pressures from the encroaching desert combined with large raids of goblins led by the orc shaman Andegril the Wise, caused the collapse of the kingdom of Anauria.According to pages 116 of Netheril Empire of Magic The Winds of Netheril, this event occurred in 450 DR. This is direct conflict with a statement on page 12 of the same book that says the kingdom fell in 3970 Netheril Year, or 111 DR. Its survivors melted away into the surrounding kingdoms, melded into nomadic tribes or perished in the harsh conditions.\nA crypt system beneath a temple of Jergal in the city was said to house the fabulous tomb of King Thausimbel the Wise and his daughter, Queen Shaddara the Fair..\nCirca the , over a thousand years after the fall of Anuaria, the gem mines beneath Amazandar were inhabited by the phaerimm of the Buried Realms."
