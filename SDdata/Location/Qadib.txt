The Free City of Qadib, also known as the City of Wands, was located along  Al-Haul River. Qadib housed more magic users than any other place in northern Zakhara, topped only by Huzuz and Rogosto in all the Land of Fate.
The city was also known for its universities, which earned it the second title "City of Sages", and the fabrication of Uther, a yellow-orange dye.
