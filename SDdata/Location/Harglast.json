Some of the deepest catacombs were connected to the Upperdark.\nHarglasts population was mostly made up by dragonborn and dwarves, with a minority of humans.\nReligion was uncommon in Harglast, like in the rest of the Windrise Ports, and the following of minor cults dedicated to the Dawn Titans or to dragons, as well as general superstition, were more universal than worshiping the gods, that were a novelty introduced in Laerakond since the Blue Breath of Change.\nHowever, thanks to their cosmopolitan nature and their trade with Faer√ªn, the cities of the Windrise Ports were more open to the concepts of religion and the gods than other places of Laerakond.
