        "mainbody": "'''Everlund''' (formerly '''Besander's Blockhouse''') was a city of merchant traders and caravan teams and was one of the greatest supporters of the league of the [[Silver Marches]].

        "Government": "For nearly five hundred years, (before [[1372 DR]]) Everlund was ruled by the [[Council of Elders]]. This group was composed of the people holding the most prominent positions in the city, although there was occasional debate over whether some civic figures were important enough to merit a seat on the council. The council was led by the First Elder, an office granted by vote of the others. The First Elder held this position until another member challenged it; sometimes this post was held for many years, other times a few days. [[Kayl Moorwalker]] was the First Elder as of [[1372 DR]].",
        "Culture": "One of the newspapers of note published in Everlund was ''[[Hawkblade's Evenhorn]]''. The periodical [[chapbook]] published witty humorous recounts of local events and news of Everlund's famous individuals.
