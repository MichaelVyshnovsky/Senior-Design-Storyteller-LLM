        "Geography": "Lluirwood made up the northern border of Luiren.. It sat on a ridge in the shadow of the [[Toadsquat Mountains]], making it more temperate to other forests in the [[Shining South]].",
        "Description": "The Lluirwood was a dense forest. Originally, it covered more of the land, but after the [[Hin Ghostwar]] ended in {{Yearlink|-65}}, the [[strongheart halfling]]s cleared parts of it to make room for permanent settlements.",
        "History": "The Lluirwood was the original homeland of all three subraces of [[halfling]]. Those three tribes ([[lightfoot halfling|lightfoots]], [[strongheart halfling|stronghearts]], and [[ghostwise halfling|ghostwise]]) lived nomadic lifestyles in the forest and shared its resources among themselves. Around {{Yearlink|-100}}, a ghostwise halfling [[cleric]] named [[Desva]] began leading the ghostwise in the worship of [[Malar]] and violence, causing the forest to become a savage place and beginning the [[Hin Ghostwar]]. The war ended in {{Yearlink|-65}} when Desva was slain and the ghostwise imposed exile on themselves to the [[Chondalwood]]. Subsequently, most of the lightfoots left the area in a diaspora across Faerûn and the stronghearts began clearing areas of the forest for permanent settlement.\n\nDuring the events of the [[Spellplague]], much of the forest was drowned beneath the newly created [[Gulf of Luiren]] save for the southwestern corner.",
        "Inhabitants": "The forest was inhabited by monsters, including those that came down from the Toadsquat Mountains, including [[tall mouther]]s and [[troll]]s. Some halfling [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, and [[rogue]]s called the forest home despite its dangers.\n\nA plethora of dangerous creatures including [[stirge]]s, [[spider]]s, [[snake]]s, large insects, and even bandits populated the eastern region of the forest. The western region of the forest was much safer thanks to the efforts of a priestess named [[Nola Treestump]]. She faced a constant struggle against the monsters and bandits who tested her boundaries whenever they could."
