The settlement and the island were surrounded in mystery and governed by Queen [[Elissa Tarixon]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The island's population was a community of [[amazon]]s and were predominately female. A small population of males, reportedly, were used as slaves. Males were considered to be valuable commodities. Tazixor's seclusion permitted no outsiders. No visitors nor diplomatic envoys were allowed to dock in the ports of Tazixor."
