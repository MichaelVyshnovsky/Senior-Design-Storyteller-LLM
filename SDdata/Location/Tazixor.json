The settlement and the island were surrounded in mystery and governed by Queen Elissa Tarixon in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The islands population was a community of amazons and were predominately female. A small population of males, reportedly, were used as slaves. Males were considered to be valuable commodities. Tazixors seclusion permitted no outsiders. No visitors nor diplomatic envoys were allowed to dock in the ports of Tazixor."
