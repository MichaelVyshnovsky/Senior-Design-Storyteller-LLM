        "mainbody": "Calims Bane\nCalimban Knoll, formerly called Calims Bane, was a stone circle marking where a battle was fought in the Calim Desert at the end of the Fourth Age of Calimshan.\nLocated near the northern border of the Calim Desert,  south of Memnon just off the Trade Way, Calimban Knoll was a circle of 21 menhirs  in diameter with a tiny, rocky mound in the center. The appearance of this site varied depending on conditions in the desert. At times, the hill was exposed at other times, sand covered the knoll, such that only the tops of the standing stones were visible. By 1370 DR, a third of the stones had toppled over.\nThe site memorialized where a small band of escaped slaves held off a full legion of Calishite soldiers in the Fourth Age of Calimshan.\nDespite the passage of centuries, some magic seemed to preserve the menhirs, and Memnons Crackle was unable to disturb the site.\nCategoryHills\nCategoryStanding stones\nCategoryLandmarks\nCategoryLocations in the Calim Desert\nCategoryLocations on the Trade Way\nCategoryLocations in Calimshan\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nr9rwab5afwy0v121ax4481h9338ogk8"
