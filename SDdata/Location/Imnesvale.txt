'''Imnesvale''' was a small village located in the [[Umar Hills]] region of [[Amn]]. It was located a bit ways northeast of [[Trademeet]].

==Government==
As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Imnesvale was overseen by a mayor known as [[Lloyd|Minister Lloyd]].

During the same time, the village was served by its [[ranger]]-protector [[Merella]], along with several other rangers and guardsmen.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Imnesvale suffered a number of major problems. Merella went missing and the village no longer benefited from her guardianship.

Also during that year, a number of Imnesvale's villagers were murdered. Some blamed the killings on a nearby pack of wolves, some said it was the [[Umar Witch]], while others thought it the work of the [[ogre]] [[Malduf]] and his companions that defected from the army of [[Sothillisian Empire]].

The town hired a group of adventurers from Trademeet, led by the stalwart [[Mazzy Fentan]], to investigate Merella's whereabouts and put an end to the killings.

==Notable Residents==
Imnesvale was home to one of the [[Cowled Wizards]] of Amn, [[Jermien]], who lived with his daughter [[Colette]].

An agent of the [[Twisted Rune]] named [[Darcin Cole]] took up residence in the town for some time. He posed as a merchant by the name of Fael.

The ranger [[Valygar Corthala]] had a cabin on the outskirts of town.

==Rumors & Legends==
Local legend spoke of a being known as the [[Umar Witch]]. It was said that every hundred years she would descend from the surrounding hills to capture children and other innocent townsfolk, and torture them until they died.
