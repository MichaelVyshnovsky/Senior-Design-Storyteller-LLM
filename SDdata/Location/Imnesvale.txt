As of the midâ€“14 century DR, Imnesvale was overseen by a mayor known as Minister Lloyd.
During the same time, the village was served by its ranger-protector Merella, along with several other rangers and guardsmen.
In the , Imnesvale suffered a number of major problems. Merella went missing and the village no longer benefited from her guardianship.
Also during that year, a number of Imnesvales villagers were murdered. Some blamed the killings on a nearby pack of wolves, some said it was the Umar Witch, while others thought it the work of the ogre Malduf and his companions that defected from the army of Sothillisian Empire.
The town hired a group of adventurers from Trademeet, led by the stalwart Mazzy Fentan, to investigate Merellas whereabouts and put an end to the killings.
Imnesvale was home to one of the Cowled Wizards of Amn, Jermien, who lived with his daughter Colette.
An agent of the Twisted Rune named Darcin Cole took up residence in the town for some time. He posed as a merchant by the name of Fael.
The ranger Valygar Corthala had a cabin on the outskirts of town.
