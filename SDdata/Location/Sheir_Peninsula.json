        "mainbody": "he Sheir Peninsula was a peninsula in Lapaliiya in southwest Faer√ªn. It marked the northeastern border of the realm.\nIt was a massive granite outcrop extending westward into the Shining Sea, bordered by cliffs that stood over 20 feet (6 meters) tall.\nAround 1373 DR, the peninsula was dotted with thorps home to local shepherds. Forced to pay exorbitant rents to the Overking of Lapaliiya to use the land, these folk were often poverty-stricken.\nThe cliff faces, meanwhile, were inhabited by harpies. These creatures preyed on ships at sea, and the shepherds went nowhere near the coast.\nOn the northern foot stood the city of Ormpur and on the southern foot stood Sheirtalar."
