        "Geography": "It was a massive [[granite]] outcrop extending westward into the [[Shining Sea]], bordered by cliffs that stood over 20 feet (6 meters) tall.",
        "Inhabitants": "Around [[1373 DR]], the peninsula was dotted with thorps home to local shepherds. Forced to pay exorbitant rents to the Overking of Lapaliiya to use the land, these folk were often poverty-stricken.\n\nThe cliff faces, meanwhile, were inhabited by [[harpies]]. These creatures preyed on ships at sea, and the shepherds went nowhere near the coast.\n\nOn the northern foot stood the city of [[Ormpur]] and on the southern foot stood [[Sheirtalar]]."
