The Camels Hump was a large island found in the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR. The island was part of an archipelago called the Deserts Virtues.
This island was named for its gradual elevation which rose to a peak that resembled a camels hump.
The Camels Hump was located approximately  due west of the Island of Firethorns. The island itself measured  in length and  in width. An elevated northeast to southwest swath of arid land split the forested coasts of the island. The town of Ravenwing sat on the islands western coast.
