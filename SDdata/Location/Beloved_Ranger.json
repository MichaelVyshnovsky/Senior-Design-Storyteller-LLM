        "mainbody": "The Beloved Ranger was a large statue located in Baldurs Gate that portrayed a larger-than-life depiction of the Rashemi ranger Minsc and his companion Boo. It was the the only structure allowed to permanently grace the ever-bustling marketplace of the Upper City, and was a particular favorite meeting spot that was rather cherished by the Baldurian populace.\nThe sculpture depicted the peculiar hero of the city with his distinct smile as he held his \"giant pygmy space hamster\" with care.\nEach morning before dawn, the Bailiff of the Wide and their subordinates gathered around the statue to discuss changes in market-stall locations and prepare for the activities of the day.\nThe Beloved Ranger was erected sometime around the  and commissioned by Orburt Lewel, a rather eccentric merchant. This honorific deed was taken as a sort of thanks, as apparently Minsc had saved Lewels life from some long-forgotten peril.\nIn 1482 DR, a group of teenagers vandalized the statue, breaking off its hands and Boo. The vandals were later apprehended and the statue was fixed.\nthumb|300px|An ambush by worshipers of the Dead Three near the restored statue.\nOne night, in the 1480s DR, the wild mage Delina was being chased through the Upper City by a pair of gargoyles. She stopped running in the Wide and stood her ground at the foot of the Beloved Ranger. When she cast a spell, the errant effects of the wild magic struck the statue and dispelled the petrification, bringing Minsc and Boo back to life.\nThe merchants of the Wide complained vehemently about the loss of some of the marketplaces charm, so by the  a new statue was commissioned and placed on the same pedestal where the originals once stood."
