        "mainbody": "Darrawn was the capital and only proper city of the nation of Fimbrul, on Laerakond. It was inhabited only by earth giants and their galeb duhr servants.\nThe giants of Darrawn spent their time hunting in the caverns and valleys of the Howling Mountains, while waging war against dragons, the oni and their orcs servants, and rebel groups of galeb duhrs.\nDarrawns structures were coaxed from natural rock instead of just built in, and the homes of Fimbran giants were wonderful caves full of rock draperies, silica falls, glowing crystalline stalactites, and other wonders made of stone.\nA typical abeiran giant drink, the gulluk, originated in Darrawn."
