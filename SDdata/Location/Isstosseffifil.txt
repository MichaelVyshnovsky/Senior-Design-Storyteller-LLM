'''Isstosseffifil''' was a [[sarrukh]] empire during the [[Days of Thunder]].

==Geography==
Isstosseffifil occupied the previously fertile lands of [[Anauroch]] from the eastern shores of the ancient [[Narrow Sea]] to the [[Plain of Standing Stones]], and reached from the [[Saiyaddar]] to the [[High Ice]].<ref>

==Notable Locations==
* [[Anarath]]: Long after it fell, this ancient city located near the High Ice was plundered and occupied by humans of [[Netheril]]. Later it became the lair of the blue dragon [[Iymrith]] 
* [[Bheulaea]]: The ruins of this ancient city were encased in the western reaches of the High Ice, only accessible by portal from the ruins of [[Ss'yin'tia'saminass]] in [[Serpentes]].
* Crypt of [[Hssthak]]: East of the [[Weathercote Wood]], the crypt of the sarrukh-lich Hssthak once contained two [[Nether Scrolls]].
* [[Hall of Mists]]: In the [[High Forest]], this stronghold of the [[Ba'etith]] became a site of great evil that was found later by elves who protected it with the [[Grandfather Tree]].
* [[Oreme]]: The capital of Isstosseffifil became home to sixty sarrukh liches, the last remnants of the kingdom.

==Society==
The leadership body, called the Sh'arrim, was made up of five to eight members of the most powerful clans. They elected an emperor, and formed a council with Sh'arrim from other sarrukh empires called the Kazim. They met in [[Okoth]], and the Kazim had authority to make laws over the entire race if they achieved a unanimous vote.

The sarrukh of Isstosseffifil kept slaves of other species, while each sarrukh lived in comfort like their leaders. They created the [[asabi]], [[Stingtail]]s, and other reptilian races able to dwell in the depths of the [[Underdark]].

The [[Ba'etith]], a scholarly society who studied and collected magic from across the realms, eventually creating the [[Nether Scrolls]], were founded in Isstosseffifil, and would outlast the empire.

The liches of Oreme, all that remained after the fall of the empire, created their own governing body, with one lich at a time taking the title of King Oreme and remaining active while the others slept.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-34500}}, Isstosseffifil rose to prominence on the eastern shore of the Narrow Sea. Throughout the Days of Thunder, they ruled much of the land that would one day become Anauroch.

In {{Yearlink|-33800}}, the Isstosseffifil empire's wizards rerouted the Narrow Sea in an effort to drown the [[phaerimm]] inhabiting [[Phaerlin]]. This resulted in a massive ecological change that devastated their empire.

Eventually, the survivors, including the [[Arthindol|Terraseer]], retreated into lichdom below Oreme, protected by their [[asabi]] servants.
