        "Description": "A roughly 150-ft-deep (45.7 m) set of caverns,{{cite web |url= http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frx/20020920|title= City of the Spider Queen Maps|accessdate= |accessmonthday= May 20|accessyear= 2015|author= Dennis Kauth|date= 2002-09-20|work= City of the Spider Queen|publisher= WotC }} the ceiling of the Naga Crawls was about 8 ft (2.4 m) in height at the entrance and only 4 ft (1.2 m) high further in. Cold streams of water wound their way through the Crawls, trickling into shallow pools at the deepest parts of the cavern. A single rusted [[iron]] ladder provided the only means of entrance from the tunnels of the Deep Wastes to the narrow caverns above, the stream pouring down the ladder in a cold waterfall.",
        "History": "At some point before [[1372 DR]], a trio of [[spirit naga]] made these caverns their home. They lured many creatures to their deaths here, earning the cavern its moniker. During the [[Silence of Lolth]], they managed to coax a [[stone giant]] deep into their lair, where they could feast on its trapped corpse.",
        "Inhabitants": "A trio of [[spirit naga]] laired here circa [[1372 DR]]."
