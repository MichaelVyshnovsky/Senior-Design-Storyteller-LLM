'''Dungrunglung''' was a settlement of [[grung]]s located in the jungles of [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Dungrunglung was surrounded by a tall maze of magical, twisted vines. The interior consisted of a large pond with narrow edges dotted with tents. In the center of the lake there was a giant shrine dedicated to the [[goddess]] [[Nangnang]].
