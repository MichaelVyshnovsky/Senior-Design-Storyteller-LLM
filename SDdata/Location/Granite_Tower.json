        "mainbody": "The Granite Tower, also called Granite Keep and Keep Bodvar, was a secluded fortress in Vaasa made of black granite. It was home to the descendants of Bodvar the Black and his Moor Eagle tribe.\nThe Granite Tower sat on the slopes of the Galena Mountains in southern Vaasa, overlooking the Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen.\nThe Tower provided safety from the dangers of Vaasa. In addition, it was defended by the Scions of the Granite Tower,\nThe people who would come to live in the Granite Tower were originally a clan of nomadic Vaasan barbarians called the Moor Eagles. They were capable and honorable warriors who traveled in wagons pulled by oxen.\nIn the mid 13 century DR, Bodvar became chieftain of the Moor Eagles, and devised a scheme to establish a fort at which his clan could offer travelers and caravans shelter during their trips across the Bottomless Bogs. However, this made the clan a target for local groups of monstrous marauders who preyed on those same caravans. Bodvars fort was destroyed and the Moor Eagles were pursued into the Bogs. They were nearly wiped out, losing all but twenty of their warriors, before they were saved by Melegaunt Tanthul, a Prince of Shade.\nThe Granite Tower itself was raised in a matter of months by Melegaunt Tanthul as part of a pact with Bodvar and his Moor Eagle clan made on Higharvestide in the . In exchange for the Tower and the twenty darkswords, Bodvar pledged that his clan would send their best warriors to assist Melegaunt when called upon. Thus, the Moor Eagles essentially became the first vassals of the Shade Enclave in Faer√ªn.\nIt was not until a century later in the , that Melegaunt would call upon the clan to uphold their end of what had come to be called the Oath of Bodvar. While Melegaunt would not survive the expedition, Vala returned home in 1372 DR accompanied by the elves Galaeron Nihmedu and Takari Moonsnow.\nAs of 1480 DR, the Granite Tower was still protected by Bodvars descendants wielding the darkswords, now calling themselves the Scions of the Granite Tower. While it was unclear how many of the darkswords were still in their possession, it was likely that those who wielded them were still bound to serve Netheril whether they knew it or not.\nAs descendants of the Moor Eagle clan of nomadic barbarians, the people of Granite Tower maintained elements of that warrior culture. They placed great value on honor and family and were known for their honesty, wisdom, and straightforwardness."
