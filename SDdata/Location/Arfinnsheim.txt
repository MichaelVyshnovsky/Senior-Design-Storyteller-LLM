Arfinnsheim was a small village located on the island of Norland within the Moonshae Isles.
The village was located along the windward side of the southern end of the North Jotunhammer Mountains near central Norland. Fierce storms rolling in off the Trackless Sea were common in Arfinnsheim given its lack of natural protection.
