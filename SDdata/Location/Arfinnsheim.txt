'''Arfinnsheim''' was a small village located on the island of [[Norland]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The village was located along the windward side of the southern end of the [[North Jotunhammer Mountains]] near central Norland. Fierce storms rolling in off the [[Trackless Sea]] were common in Arfinnsheim given its lack of natural protection.
