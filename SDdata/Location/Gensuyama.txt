'''Gensuyama''' was a volcano located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Gensuyama was located in [[Kagochi Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. It was the only active volcano in Kozakura, renowned for its perilous lava flows. The area between the volcano and the southern sea was uninhabited, featuring rugged [[basalt]] rock formations.

==Inhabitants==
Gensuyama was widely believed to be haunted by malevolent spirits, with hermits from nearby mountains asserting the presence of an entrance to the [[underworld]]. These hermits also claimed that spirits who have escaped the underworld occasionally wandered the vicinity. The region is known for encounters with [[kuei]], [[p'oh]], and [[con-tinh]].

==History==
In a violent eruption during Emperor Reijo's third year of reign, ships at sea faced the impact of far-flung [[pumice]] and volcanic debris.
