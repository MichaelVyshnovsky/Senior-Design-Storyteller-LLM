        "mainbody": "Brightaxe Hall was the seat of power of the ancient dwarven realm of Alatorin, as well as the empire of Shanatar.\nEssentially an open-ended cavern overlooking the Rift of Dhalnadar, the Wyrmskull Throne once stood here.\nNine statues, known as the None Scions of the Forge, were carved into the rift wall beneath the Hall. These depicted fully armored shield dwarves, and were believed to represent Taark Shanat and his eight sons.\nBrightaxe Hall lay at the southern end of the Dhalnadar Span&mdashthe only bridge across the Rift of Dhalnadar, which stretched across the Underdark from below the Marching Mountains to the Calim Desert.\nAround , Taark Shanats eight sons each went on to found their own, separate kingdoms.\nAlatorin was eventually conquered by the drow of Guallidurth in the First Spider War, which lasted from  to . The Eight Kingdoms of the dwarves were consumed by the internecine conflict known as the Spawn Wars, and so did not come to Alatorins aid. Once that conflict had been settled, the Eight Kingdoms banded together and reconquered Alatorin and Brightaxe Hall with it&mdashthis campaign was known as the Second Spider War, and lasted from  to . The eight kings formed the great realm of Deep Shanatar, with Brightaxe Hall once again serving as the seat of power.\nBut it was not to last. Come the Third Spider War, from  to , the drow of Guallidurth struck an alliance with the cloakers of Rringlor Noroth. The dwarves of Shanatar were driven away from Alatorin and Brightaxe Hall permanently, taking the Wyrmskull Throne with them. and the great dwarf-realm never recovered.\nAs of the , Brightaxe Hall had become a dragons lair once more, having been claimed by the deep wyrm Dheubpurcwenpyl.\nWhen Brightaxe Hall was reconquered following the Second Spider War, the eight victorious dwarven kings all claimed the right to sit on the Wyrmskull Throne and rule Shanatar. According to legend, the matter was settled when the visor on one of the statues, believed to represent the ancient king of Ultoksamrin, fell off. The dwarf-kings took this as a sign from Moradin, and the king of Ultoksamrin ascended to the throne.\nAround 1370 DR, it was rumored that the duergar Army of Steel was planning a crusade to reconquer Brightaxe Hall, the Wyrmskull Throne, and much of the eastern territories of ancient Shanatar.\n* Dheubpurcwenpyl, a deep dragon who made her lair in the Hall circa 1370 DR."
