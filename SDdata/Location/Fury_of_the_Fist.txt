Fury of the Fist was a statue in Seatower of Baldurs Gate.
The statue was in the Lower City, outside the Seatower of Balduran and prior to crossing the bridge.
In 1482 DR, the hand of this statue, as well as others, was stolen by agents of the Guild. The youths of the Ravenshade, Oberon, Durinbold families and potentially others carried out the same act to the Beloved Ranger. All but those of the Outer City were angered, and the Flaming Fist conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up. Horgold Hadru took in the noble youths who had vandalised the statue of Minsc and Boo, as he owed the Durinbold patriar family a favor.
