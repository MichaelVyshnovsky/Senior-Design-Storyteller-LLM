        "Description": "On the surface, only rubble remained, but the extensive subterranean passageways and chambers remained mostly intact. The royal family and their servants retreated beneath the surface during winter storms; as a result these halls were comfortably furnished.\n\nTo the [[Vil Adanrath]], Winterkeep was known as \"''Iket Sotha''\".",
        "History": "Winterkeep was built as a nobleman's estate, in the days of [[Raumathar]]. It later became a retreat for the royal family. After the fall of the empire, Winterkeep gradually fell to ruins.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], the [[gelugon]] [[Ultael]] enslaved several [[ice troll]] warbands and started to attempt to make a fiefdom for himself. He sent several warbands out to raid along the [[Golden Way]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|58}}"
