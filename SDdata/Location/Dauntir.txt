The Dauntir was a region of central, inland Amn.
The region was made up of the rolling, fertile hills above the floodplains of Zehoarastria. It was pleasant, rich countryside with many farms, estates, and villages.
The Dauntir was bounded roughly by the River Esmel to the north and east, the Small Teeth to the south, and the Trade Way to the west.
The major highway of the Trade Way ran along the western edge of the Dauntir as it bordered the flood-prone lowlands of Zehoarastria. The Imnescourse Trail also passed along the southern edge near the Small Teeth.
* Battlescarred Bard, an inn on the Trade Way.
* Harvest House, a temple of Chauntea.
* Imnescar, a town in the foothills of the Small Teeth.
* Esford, a village in the west.
* The Narthaen estate.
* Ombreir, the fortified country estate of the Araunvol family.
* Shepherdston, a village in the west.
