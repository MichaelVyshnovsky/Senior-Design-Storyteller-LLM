'''Taltempla''', or the '''City of Magic''', was a peaceful and harmonic city and the second-largest settlement on the [[elf|elven]] isle of [[Evermeet]] in the [[Trackless Sea]].

==Description==
Taltempla was a large elven city, wondrous sight for those beholding it for the first time. Its breathtaking appearance echoed ancient eras when the [[Fair Folk]] ruled [[Faerûn]]. The city was encircled by a clear crystal wall. All of its buildings were crafted with very few straight lines in order to appear like natural formations made of white and green [[marble]]. A big portion of Taltempla's buildings were [[conjuration|conjured]] deep from the island's earth. The city was filled with greens of the parks, marble shrines, and groves used by the elves to worship the [[Seldarine]] or for meditation. The city harbor was built on the bay, forming Taltempla's southeastern border.

==Geography==
[[File:Evermeet map wcc-2e.jpg|thumb|''A map of [[Evermeet]] showing Taltempla's location.''|304x304px]]
Taltempla stood on Evermeet's east coast, northeast of the town of [[Ruith]]. It was built on a natural bay in the Trackless Sea. It stood on the [[Wizard's Road]] that hugged Taltempla's southwestern walls.

==Government==
Taltempla had no government, and the locals did not need it. They were comfortable in leaving their harmonious lives, practicing sorcery, and worshiping the Seldarine. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the city's de-facto ruler was its most powerful spellcaster – the High Mage [[Gaelira]].

==History==
Two powerful elven [[enchanted]] [[swords]], ''[[Thael]] and ''[[Amasal]]'', were recovered from [[gnoll]] raiders who menaced the ancient [[Illefarn]]. They were placed under guard in the city of Taltempla by the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

===Notable Locations===
Taltempla had a collection of temples dedicated to the [[Seldarine]]: [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Sehanine Moonbow]], [[Angharradh]], [[Aerdrie Faenya]], [[Hanali Celanil]], and [[Solonor Thelandira]].

*[[Gaelira's Tower]], home to Taltempla's de-facto leader in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[The Golden Griffon]], a mage-favorite inn in the 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[The Green Paths]], a lush public park.
*[[Grove of the Four Winds]], a magnificent central park of Taltempla.
*[[The Hall of Trifold Harmony]], a soaring and magnificent temple of Angharradh.
*[[School of Magic (Taltempla)|School of Magic]], the city's college, located on the northwestern edge of town.
*[[Shrine of the Fallen Heroes]], a landmark – the memorial to slain elves.
*[[Tower of Flinar]], home of [[Flinar]] the Mage in the 14{{th}} century DR, roughly at the center of the city, west of Gaelira's Tower.
*[[Tower of the Sisters of the Sun]], the guildhall for the city's female mages.

==Notable Inhabitants==
The settlement's nickname – the City of Magic, came from the fact that a large portion of its residents were [[wizard]]s. Apart from the [[arcane]], the city held many [[priest]]s and locations holy to the elves of Evermeet.

*[[Ohmbryn Elaéyadar]], an elven [[sage]] who dedicated his life in studying the doings of [[human]]s. In the 14{{th}} century DR, Ohmbryn used his magics to mentally communicate with the famed hero [[Dove Falconhand]].
