'''Insight Park''' was a public park in [[Baldur's Gate]], that was [[magic]]ally created during the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In addition to the green lawns and natural thickets, Insight Park featured a single unidentifiable tree, known as the [[Drawing Tree]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1452}}, the [[shield dwarf]] [[druid]] [[Torimesh]] returned to Baldur's Gate after a many-decade career as an adventurer. He then bought a small plot of land that was being used as a junkyard. Torimesh used his druidic magic to create a lush, mini-forest to grow over the land, so that the poorer Baldurians could appreciate the beauty of nature.
