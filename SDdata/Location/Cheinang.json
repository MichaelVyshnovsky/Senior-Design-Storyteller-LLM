        "mainbody": "'''Cheinang''' was the capital city of [[Laothan]] in [[Malatra]].{{Cite interactive atlas|C2aNElc.FCW}}",
        "Geography": "Near the heart of the Laothan jungle, Cheinang lay at the confluence of the two tributaries that flowed into the [[Phu River]]. Upriver, the western tributary led to [[Kompoa]], while, downriver, the Phu led to [[Tran]] and the [[Eastern Sea]]. A trail also ran alongside the river between Cheinang and Phu.",
        "Description": "The largest city in Laothan, it sprawled around the three rivers and a small system of canals that provided further transport and control of flooding. However, people of the neighboring [[Kuong Kingdom]] like the prejudiced old nun [[Ama]] dismissed them the canals as being not as big or as good as those of [[Ranguri]]. Buildings were constructed of [[wood]] and [[bamboo]] with tiled roofs, rather than stone, even the temples, but many people lived in houseboats. There were water markets, while Thok Castle overlooked Cheinang from atop a local promontory.",
        "Government": "The city was the home of the [[Thok (clan)|Thok]], the ruling clan of Laothan. As of [[1357 DR]], it was ruled by the monarch [[Thok Lian]].",
        "Economy": "In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Cheinang received much trade from other points in Laothan. Via [[Kwang Tre]], these included [[pearl]]s from [[Buyan]] and exotic beasts from the neighboring land of [[Purang]], and via [[Kompoa]], furs and leatherwork from [[Bang Nu]]. Rare woods, perfumes, incenses, and natural oils from [[Nindamh]], further along the Phu River, were in high demand in Cheinang.",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], the army of the Kuong Kingdom planned a conquest of Laothan. Once they'd covertly mustered a sufficient force in Purang, the Kuong army planned to seize Kwang Tre, expecting an easy victory, then rush down the Phu River to surprise Cheinang and strike a decisive blow against the [[Seng]] people."
