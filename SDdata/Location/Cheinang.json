        "mainbody": "heinang was the capital city of Laothan in Malatra.\nNear the heart of the Laothan jungle, Cheinang lay at the confluence of the two tributaries that flowed into the Phu River. Upriver, the western tributary led to Kompoa, while, downriver, the Phu led to Tran and the Eastern Sea. A trail also ran alongside the river between Cheinang and Phu.\nThe largest city in Laothan, it sprawled around the three rivers and a small system of canals that provided further transport and control of flooding. However, people of the neighboring Kuong Kingdom like the prejudiced old nun Ama dismissed them the canals as being not as big or as good as those of Ranguri. Buildings were constructed of wood and bamboo with tiled roofs, rather than stone, even the temples, but many people lived in houseboats. There were water markets, while Thok Castle overlooked Cheinang from atop a local promontory.\nThe city was the home of the Thok, the ruling clan of Laothan. As of 1357 DR, it was ruled by the monarch Thok Lian.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, Cheinang received much trade from other points in Laothan. Via Kwang Tre, these included pearls from Buyan and exotic beasts from the neighboring land of Purang, and via Kompoa, furs and leatherwork from Bang Nu. Rare woods, perfumes, incenses, and natural oils from Nindamh, further along the Phu River, were in high demand in Cheinang.\nIn 1357 DR, the army of the Kuong Kingdom planned a conquest of Laothan. Once theyd covertly mustered a sufficient force in Purang, the Kuong army planned to seize Kwang Tre, expecting an easy victory, then rush down the Phu River to surprise Cheinang and strike a decisive blow against the Seng people."
