        "mainbody": "The '''Southkrypt Garden''', also known simply as '''Southkrypt''', was the ruins of a [[dwarf]]hold on the northern edge of [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. The former name was derived from the fact that its dwarven inhabitants had constructed a magnificent garden around it.",
        "Geography": "Southkrypt was located underneath the mountains the dwarves called [[Maruutdin]] and north of the Kryptgarden Forest.{{Cite dragon/236/Children of the Night|80}}",
        "Description": "Upon the entrance doors of Southkrypt were engraved the national symbol of [[Haunghdannar]]—a seven-pointed star, above a fish facing left, and floating above a mountain peak. On the surface it was surrounded by a wild, overgrown and tangled garden. Its interiors were described as being maze-like.",
        "History": "Southkrypt was once a part of the dwarven nation of Haungdannar and acted as a defense for their eastern borders. At one point before it was left in ruins, Southkrypt was known to be a [[silver]] mine.",
        "Inhabitants": "The entrance to the ruins was guarded by a tribe of [[hobgoblin]]s, who worked to ensure that any adventurers who came in would stay and provide sustenance for their lord [[Morg]].{{Cite dragon/236/Children of the Night|81-82}}\n\nSince at least [[1358 DR]], the upper level of the ruins were known to be inhabited by a variety of [[gibberling]]s and [[norker]]s. While the lower levels were known to be inhabited by [[storoper]]s, [[vilstrak]], [[vargouille]], and [[xaren]]. The lower levels were also home to Morg, a [[vampire|vampiric]] [[hill giant]] [[shaman]], as well as his company of three hill giant servitors.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Legends claimed that ancient [[Magic item|magical]] weapons of Haungdannar could be found within the depths of Southkrypt."
