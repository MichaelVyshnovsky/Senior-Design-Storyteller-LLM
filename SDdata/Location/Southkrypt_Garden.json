        "mainbody": "he Southkrypt Garden, also known simply as Southkrypt, was the ruins of a dwarfhold on the northern edge of Kryptgarden Forest. The former name was derived from the fact that its dwarven inhabitants had constructed a magnificent garden around it.\nSouthkrypt was located underneath the mountains the dwarves called Maruutdin and north of the Kryptgarden Forest.\nUpon the entrance doors of Southkrypt were engraved the national symbol of Haunghdannarâ€”a seven-pointed star, above a fish facing left, and floating above a mountain peak. On the surface it was surrounded by a wild, overgrown and tangled garden. Its interiors were described as being maze-like.\nSouthkrypt was once a part of the dwarven nation of Haungdannar and acted as a defense for their eastern borders. At one point before it was left in ruins, Southkrypt was known to be a silver mine.\nThe entrance to the ruins was guarded by a tribe of hobgoblins, who worked to ensure that any adventurers who came in would stay and provide sustenance for their lord Morg.\nSince at least 1358 DR, the upper level of the ruins were known to be inhabited by a variety of gibberlings and norkers. While the lower levels were known to be inhabited by storopers, vilstrak, vargouille, and xaren. The lower levels were also home to Morg, a vampiric hill giant shaman, as well as his company of three hill giant servitors.\nLegends claimed that ancient magical weapons of Haungdannar could be found within the depths of Southkrypt."
