Riz Malag was a destroyed settlement in the Underdark beneath Cormyr, somewhere near the drow city of Sschindylryn.
Long ago, Riz Malag was destroyed by forces from Sschindylryn, who attacked by opening a portal into the middle of the settlement. By the 15 century DR, Riz Malag was a crumbling ruin inhabited only by forces from Sschindylryn, with the old portal still active and offering a direct route into the drow city.
