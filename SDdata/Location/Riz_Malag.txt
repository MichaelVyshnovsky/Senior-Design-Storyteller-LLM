'''Riz Malag''' was a destroyed settlement in the [[Underdark]] beneath [[Cormyr]], somewhere near the [[drow]] city of [[Sschindylryn]].

==History==
Long ago, Riz Malag was destroyed by forces from Sschindylryn, who attacked by opening a ''[[portal]]'' into the middle of the settlement. By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Riz Malag was a crumbling ruin inhabited only by forces from Sschindylryn, with the old ''portal'' still active and offering a direct route into the drow city.{{DDO-time}}
