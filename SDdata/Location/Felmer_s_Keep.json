        "mainbody": "elmers Keep was a small island located within the Land of the Lions region of South Faer√ªn.\nThe island lay in the southwest section of the Lake of Steam northeast from the city of Yeshpek.\nFelmers Keep appeared to be a man-made fortress when viewed from the waters of the Lake of Steam or shoreline, but the \"keep\" was actually a series of naturally occurring sheer cliffaces from a dormant volcano. The volcanos caldera was a lush garden tended by priests of Chauntea.\nVarious seabird species nested within the high cliffs of the island. Verrick and giant lynxs lived on the island as well.\nFelmers Keep was named for an adventurer from ages past who fled to the island and perished there. Some believed his ghost still haunted the island. Others believed he was welcomed by the fauna living on the island and became a priest of Chauntea."
