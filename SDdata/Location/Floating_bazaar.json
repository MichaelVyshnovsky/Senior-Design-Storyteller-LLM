        "mainbody": "The floating bazaar was an interesting marketplace that could be found in Dihliz in the Cities of the Ancients in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe bazaar was situated in the southwest corner of the city. Whereas most bazaars were lined with streets leading to the various shops and stalls, the floating bazaar was crisscrossed with canals.\nSmall boats could be rented in order to access the many shops and stalls of the bazaar. Illicit activities were believed to occur within the dead-end canals. Commerce within the floating bazaar practically disappeared as the sun set since dangerous crocodiles from the Nogaro River often made incursions into the canals at night."
