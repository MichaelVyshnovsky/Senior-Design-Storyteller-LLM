'''Old Thindar''' was a portion of [[Thindar]] that had been swallowed by the sea.

==History==
Old Thindar composed the main portion of Thindar's port district. This section of this city would slowly erode with each storm that passed overhead, eventually leading to a complex of ruins that were completely submerged under the waters of the [[Thingulph]]. Daring [[adventurer]]s often tried to search the sunken ruins for hidden treasure but few returned because of the presence of dangerous [[yuan-ti]].
