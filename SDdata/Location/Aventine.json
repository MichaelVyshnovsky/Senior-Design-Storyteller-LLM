Though the drow and crinti did not suffer many casualties during the attack, the arkaiun, or shebali, were nearly wiped out.\n\nQueen [[Melanith]]'s consort, [[Sadalar]], was killed during the conflict. For their support, the drow awarded the crinti with prime drow males with whom to breed. Melanith selected a new consort from this bunch."
