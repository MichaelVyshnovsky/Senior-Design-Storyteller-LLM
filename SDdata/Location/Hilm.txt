Hilm, or the "City of Kindness," was the northernmost city in the Pantheist League within Zakhara.
The metropolis, located near Huzuz, was a caravan stop for missionaries traveling toward the Court of Enlightenment.
The plain and colorless avenues of Hilm were well patrolled and kept clean of vagabonds and ruffians.
The caliph of Hilm was Abir al-Farhan in 1367 DR. The citizens of Hilm were the most liberal out of all the Pantheist cities, perhaps because of the citys closer proximity to mighty Huzuz.
Hilm was renowned for the cleanliness and hospitality found within its hospices. Because of this many travelers making the holy pilgrimage to Huzuz often chose to pass through Hilm on foot. Any trouble to be found in Hilm was often brought from beyond the citys walls.
Entertainment in Hilm included an assortment of common legends and mystery plays which all bore moralist lessons. Bards recited the great poems sacred to the Pantheist League.
The Sword of the True Gods kept 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry stationed in Hilm. An additional 1,000 city guard kept the peace. The caliphs personal guard included three units of mamluks from the Exalted Mamluk Society numbering 900 men.
Hilm was believed to be the first city after Huzuz to receive the Law of the Loregiver. The gods worshiped in Hilm at the time were the first to become enlightened, thus setting the tone for Pantheist Enlightenment throughout the region.
