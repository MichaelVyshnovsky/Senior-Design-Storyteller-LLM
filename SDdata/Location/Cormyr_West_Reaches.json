        "mainbody": "The West Reaches of Cormyr was the stark frontier lands of the realm, encompassing the Storm Horns and Tunlands west of the kingdoms heartlands.\nThe west reaches were most famously defined by the Storm Horns, a range of towering mountains studded with beautiful vales, dour forts, and isolated villages. The passes were well-patrolled, but monsters and bandits were constant dangers to travelers, and the weather could turn deadly regardless of preparations. The High Road was the sole proper road through the region as it wound out of Cormyrs heartlands and into the Western Heartlands.\nThe reaches lay along the Storm Horns and extended into the lands beyond that Cormyr tenuously claimed. It reached as far as the Sunset Mountains in the west and the Goblin Marches in the north.\nThe Tunlands made up the far western frontier of the realm. It was a wide valley of rolling plains between the Storm Horns and the Sunset Mountains, containing the Tun River and the Marsh of Tun. It ostensibly lay within the borders of Cormyr for the purposes of dissuading other realms from claiming it, but was truly the domain of independent tribes such as the Tunlar as well as many monsters and bandits.\nThe Farsea Marshes lay at the north extent of the Tunlands near to the Goblin Marches and High Moors. It was inhabited by the Marsh Drovers.\nThe Veilstone Peaks were claimed by Cormyr, but lay at the faintest extent of its authority. Beyond the Tun River, the foothills of the Sunset Mountains were home to a collection of impoverished villages below the perilous Wolovers Keep, interspersed with copses of trees and placid ponds.\n* Lightning Peak\n* Mount Shalandragar and Eastmount, its eastern flank.\n* Old Blind Mage Mountain\n* Condor Pass\n* Dark Wind Pass, an ancient dwarven trail of Oghrann that dug through the peaks.\n* Worg Pass\n* Marshview Pass\n* Valley of Broken Sky\n* Aris Castle, the fortified home of the Aris family.\n* DaRonis Cave, home of the famed gnomish inventor Nadul DaRoni.\n* Eagle Peak, a fortified trade town that dealt with the locals of the Tunlands and Farsea Marshes.\n* Greatgaunt, a fortified town founded by the Greatgaunt family.\n* High Horn, the most famous and mighty castle in Cormyr that protected the western border.\n* Hornshield, a strong castle atop Mount Shalandragar.\n* Huthduth, a fortified Chauntean monastery.\n* Mage Keep, a fortification between the Storm Horns and Dragonmere.\n* Old Axe, a hamlet verging on ghost town that mined iron from the Old Axe mountain.\n* Skull Crag, a fortified village on Old Blind Mage Mountain.\n* Torrinville, a small village deep in the mountains accessed by Condor Pass.\n* Wyvernhunt, a shepherds hamlet in the shadow of Wyvernhunt Keep.\n* Windcrag House on the Tun Shore, estate of the Barelder family.\n* Chonis Temple, a ruined site.\n* The Crevasse of Lost Fortune, in the southern Storm Horns.\n* The Mine of Cursed Gold, a mine on the western edge of the mountains.\n* Mistinarperadnacles Lair, the home of the old red dragon.\n* Spear Rock, a shrine of Tempus near Wyvernhunt.\n* The Temple of Eternal Death, a site deep in the southern mountains.\n* Wyvernhunt Keep, a small abandoned bandits fort above Wyvernhunt."
