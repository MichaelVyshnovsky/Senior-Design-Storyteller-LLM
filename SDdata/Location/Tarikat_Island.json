A large unnamed mountain range dominated the interior structure of the island. The range's southwest region was split by a ''[[Midani dictionary|wadi]]'' that reached both the northwest and southeast shores. Rocky outcroppings formed the shore of Tarikat Island, with coral reefs and sand banks surrounding the vast majority of the coast. Natural bays sat at the island's north and south ends."
