The '''East Reaches of Cormyr''' were an expansive frontier east of the [[Cormyr/Heartlands|heartlands]], made up of the lightly-inhabited lands beyond the [[Wyvernwater]] that stretched from the border of [[Sembia]] to the edge of the [[Anauroch]] desert.

==Description==
The east reaches and [[West Reaches of Cormyr|west reaches]] were commonly regarded as the future of Cormyr, as part of a steady wave of settlement and taming of the wilds. The eastern lands ranged from the rolling [[Eastern Plains]] near the [[Coast of Cormyr|coast]], the dense and inhospitable [[Hullack Forest]], and the dry grasslands of [[Tilver's Gap]] and the [[Stonelands]]. It was scattered with villages, forts, and rural noble estates, and home to many monsters and bandits.

==Geography==
The east reaches broadly encompassed the lands north of the [[Way of the Manticore]], east and north of the Wyvernwater, and north of [[Arabel]] and the [[Stonecliff]]. At its furthest extent it included [[Thunder Gap]], Tilver's Gap, and the Stonelands, though this claim was only enforced by occasional [[Purple Dragons]] patrols.

===Bodies of Water===
* The [[Darkflow]] emerged from the [[Vast Swamp]], forming the border between Cormyr and [[Sembia]].
* The [[Immerflow]] poured from the [[Falls of Tumbling Stars]] in the northern [[Thunder Peaks]] and was joined by [[Turnwyrm Brook]] before flowing south into the [[Wyvernwater]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Sembia}}
* The [[Thunder River]] ran west from the southern Thunder Peaks into the Wyvernwater.
* The [[Sword River]] flowed from [[Arabel Springs]], eventually emptying into [[Wyvernwater]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Kings Forest}}
