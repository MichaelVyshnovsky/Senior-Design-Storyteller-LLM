The East Reaches of Cormyr were an expansive frontier east of the heartlands, made up of the lightly-inhabited lands beyond the Wyvernwater that stretched from the border of Sembia to the edge of the Anauroch desert.
The east reaches and west reaches were commonly regarded as the future of Cormyr, as part of a steady wave of settlement and taming of the wilds. The eastern lands ranged from the rolling Eastern Plains near the coast, the dense and inhospitable Hullack Forest, and the dry grasslands of Tilvers Gap and the Stonelands. It was scattered with villages, forts, and rural noble estates, and home to many monsters and bandits.
The east reaches broadly encompassed the lands north of the Way of the Manticore, east and north of the Wyvernwater, and north of Arabel and the Stonecliff. At its furthest extent it included Thunder Gap, Tilvers Gap, and the Stonelands, though this claim was only enforced by occasional Purple Dragons patrols.
