'''Luruar''', also commonly known as the '''Silver Marches''', was a confederation of cities in the north of [[Faerûn]], under the leadership of [[Alustriel Silverhand]], former ruler of Silverymoon. It consisted of [[Silverymoon]], [[Citadel Adbar]], [[Deadsnows]], [[Jalanthar]], [[Quaervarr]], [[Citadel Felbarr]], [[Everlund]], [[Mithral Hall]], and [[Sundabar]], and its goal was to protect [[the North]] against the growing horde of [[orc]]s in the mountains.{{Cite web/The Silver Marches Sneak Peak}}

==Geography==
It was bordered by the [[Anauroch]] desert to the east, the [[High Forest]] to the south, the [[Evermoors]] to the west and the [[Spine of the World]] mountain range to the north. Through [[Mithral Hall]], Luruar also shared a border with the kingdom of [[Many-Arrows]].

==Geographical features==
;Bodies of Water:
* [[Icespear River]]: This river wound around the northern stretch of the [[Rauvin Mountains]] before being crossed by the [[Fork Road]].
* [[River Rauvin]]: The great many boats, rafts and merchant-barges that passed along this river granted its moniker of the "Road Through the Marches".
* [[River Redrun]]: The Redrun flowed south from the Spine of the World and met with the mighty Rauvin just north of [[Sundabar]].
* [[River Surbrin]]: Running between the [[Frost Hills]] and the [[Moonwood]], this river continued west into the [[Dessarin Valley]].

;Forests:
* [[Arn Forest]]: The remote Arn Forest was home to a small community of [[rock gnome]]s.
* [[Glimmerwood]]: This vast woodland encompassed four, adjacent and once-distinct forests.
:* [[Cold Wood]]: This [[pine]], [[birch]] and [[spruce]] forest has remained unmarked by civilized settlers or foresters. While it was home to some of the [[Uthgardt]] tribes, [[orc]]s and [[ettin]]s have also been known to roam the woods.
:* [[Druarwood]]: The sparse trees of this forest served as refuge for many orcs and [[giant]]s that came down from the [[Spine of the World]].
:* [[Moonwood]]: This large forest north of Silverymoon was free of [[goblinoid]] races. This was due to the large population of [[lycanthrope]]s, many of whom are members of the [[People of the Black Blood]].
:* [[Night Trees]]: Nearly all of the intelligent races of the marches avoided the two diminutive forests and the mysterious temple-tower that lay within.
* [[Silverwood]]: Previous connected to the great [[High Forest]], these woods were since separated by the [[Everlund Pass]].
* [[Vordrorn Forest]]: Also known as the "Ghostwood", this unexplored forest was one of the most menacing locales in the area.

;Hills and Mountains:
* [[Ice Mountains]]: The harsh, freezing gales that blew down from these mountains whipped down across the surrounding valleys.
* [[Ice Spires]]: Located beyond these dual ranges was the realm of [[Hartsvale]], the home of men who were said to be descended from giants.
* [[Nether Mountains]]: There were many monsters that spread from these mountain ranges to the surrounding areas.
* [[Rauvin Mountains]]: The [[River Rauvin]] passes through the peaks in a steep-sided, mist-filled gorge of roaring white water. There was a perilous trail in the gorge that runs through the [[Dead Orc Pass]] to the north side of the Rauvin that contains a strong and aggressive orc tribe.
* [[Surbrin Hills]]:

;Regions:
* [[Moonlands]]: Located north of [[Rauvin|River Rauvin]] and east of [[River Surbrin]], this stretch of wilderness was claimed as part of the territories of at least three Uthgardt tribes.
*[[Old Delzoun]]: The area that was once home to a [[Delzoun|kingdom]] of dwarves comprised the eastern part of the [[Cold Run]], the [[Adbar Run]] further west, and the [[Sundabar Vale]] to the south.

;Valleys:
*[[Adbar Run]]: This wild and untamed area was home to orcish and [[goblinoid]]s.
* [[Cold Vale]]: The northern-most of the marches' valleys spread down from the Spine of the World
*[[Sundabar Vale]]: Encompassing its [[Sundabar|namesake city]] and its surrounding holds, this central valley was nestled between the Nether and Rauvin Mountains.
* [[Rauvin Vale]]: Considered by many to be the heart of the Silver Marches, this bountiful valley was dotted with thriving holdings, farmsteads and small villages.

==Government==
The League of Silver Marches began in [[1371 DR]] as a confederation of city-states, united to defend themselves from a common threat. or High Marshal, would be the seventh Peer; the eighth would be the Lord or Lady Protector, a representative of the protectorates, those such as [[Auvandell]], [[Rivermoot]], [[Jalanthar]], and [[Quaervarr]] who laid within the Silver Marches but without signatory privilege; and the ninth Peer would be a rotating individual, chosen for the position by the Speaker of the Silver Marches, known as a Member at Large.

These nine Peers would choose a High Lord or Lady from within their ranks to head the meetings of the League. The Speaker's responsibilities, beyond calling the League's meetings, included breaking vote ties, arranging each meeting's agenda, and acting as the ultimate judge within the Marches, though the last was subject to council review. 

As of [[1372 DR]], the League's first council consisted of [[High Mage of Silverymoon|High Mage]] [[Taern Hornblade]] of [[Silverymoon]], King [[Harbromm]] of [[Citadel Adbar]], King [[Emerus Warcrown]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]], First Elder [[Kayl Moorwalker]] of [[Everlund]], King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] of [[Mithral Hall]], and Lord [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]] of [[Sundabar]] as the six signatory Peers, and High Marshal [[Methrammar Aerasumé]] of the [[Argent Legion]], Lady Protector [[Alustriel Silverhand]] (who also acted as the first Speaker of the Silver Marches), and Member-at-Large [[Old Night]] as the three remaining Peers.

==Trade==
Due to its bounty of natural resources, and the open-trade mindset of its confederated cities and towns, the Silver Marches were rich with opportunities to find wealth and fortune. The lands were vast and fertile enough for farmlands to produce ample food and ranches to raise small herds of livestock. Its rivers, forests, and mountains supported the livelihoods of many fishermen, furriers, lumberers and miners. Merchants plied their goods between the various cities of the marches, by wagon or barge, and further out to destinations beyond. 

Various common and uncommon [[currencies]] were accepted in the cities of the Marches, though less so in the smaller towns. Silverymoon minted a coin unique to the region, called a ''[[Moon (coin)|moon]]'', that was accepted all throughout the region.

==Defenses==
Due to the many perils and hostile forces that made home in the North, the Silver Marches' first line of defense often came in the form of information. Many small groups of city-sponsored scouts, bands of [[ranger]]s, [[:Category:Adventuring companies|adventuring companies]], independent cells of [[Harpers]], and others scouted the stretches of Wilderness that often presented threats to the civilized lands. Many of the smaller towns maintained their own local patrols, comprised of militiamen and other volunteer defenders.

While each of the cities maintained their own armed forces, such as the [[Knights in Silver]] of Silverymoon and the [[Army of the Vale]] in [[Everlund]], 

==History==
[[File:Silver marches.png|thumb]]
The years [[1368 DR|1368]] through [[1370 DR]] were particularly turbulent for the city-states of [[the North]]. Troll attacks, orc hordes, an combined army of [[demon]]s and [[barbarian]]s as well as a particularly harsh winter spurred the leaders of those cities to convene a council. After many heated arguments were calmed by Alustriel's diplomatic skills, it was decided that the cities would band together and form a confederation under Alustriel's leadership. Alustriel declared, at the suggestion of [[Old Night]], that the nation would be known as ''"Luruar"'' in honor of the goddess [[Lurue]], sometime between the winter and midsummer of 1371 DR. She rejected the suggestions of "New Delzoun", in honor of the fallen dwarf kingdom, and "Alustryr", in honor of herself.<ref>

By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, after Alustriel's apparent demise, her eldest son, [[Methrammar Aerasumé]], was High Lord of Luruar. The League had lost the support of [[Citadel Adbar]], [[Citadel Felbarr]] and [[Mithral Hall]], whose leaders refused to spend effort and resources helping smaller settlements at the expense of their own. Though the three cities remained allies of Luruar, they no longer considered themselves members of the confederation, nor could they be relied upon to answer calls for help.

In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, the [[Darkening]] was cast over the region in preparation for the [[drow]] and [[orc]] invasion. The attacks involved sieges and attacks on [[Winters Edge]], Mithral Hall, [[Nesmé]], and Silverymoon, as well as subterfuge interfering with trade in [[Blingdenstone]]. The spell was finally overcome by a band of adventurers, during the battle of [[Eryndlyn]]. 

Ultimately however, thanks to disagreements following the war, the League of Silver Marches was disbanded in the {{YearlinkName|1488}}. The [[Silverymoon|Silvaeren]] were blamed for providing insufficient aid for [[Sundabar]], whose surface population had been completely wiped out. As a result, all of the [[dwarven]] states left the League of Silver Marches, and without their support, Luruar collapsed.
