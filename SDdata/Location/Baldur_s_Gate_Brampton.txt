Brampton was a district in south-eastern Baldurs Gate. It was located in the Lower City, on the eastern side of Gray Harbor, south of Eastway.
This region was noteworthy in that passage through it was required to reach the Outer City district of Tumbledown.
The docks of Brampton were lined with many warehouses owned by Baldurian shipping interests.
To avoid tolls and taxes during the 15 century DR, many smugglers used a route that began in the district of Rivington, south of the River Chionthar. They moved goods downstream along the river before docking at the quay in Brampton. There, illicit cargo was then combined into legitimate shipments and distributed throughout the city.
Sometime in the mid-1480s, the maniacal moon elf Deniak smuggled a half-dozen hobgoblins into the district and established the headquarters for his Tiamat-worshiping-splinter-cell of the Cult of the Dragon near the docks. 
Using a number of stolen ritual-books, along with the inherent arcane power of his wild mage sister Delina, Deniak transformed himself into a red dragon. The ritual caused a massive explosion in Brampton, that was visible from across the city in the Watch Citadel.
