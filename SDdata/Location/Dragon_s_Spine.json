        "mainbody": "The Dragons Spine was a mountain range located in Kozakura.\nThe Dragons Spine were located on the island of Shinkoku. They rang along the length of the island. It was named after the legendary earth dragon believed to slumber beneath the lands of Kozakura.\nDuring the Age of Gods, the Earth Dragon, pleased with Shinkokus beauty, chose to rest on the evolving land, giving rise to the imposing mountain chain known as the Dragons Spine that stretched across the entire island. From time to time, earthquakes that shook the region were attributed to the Earth Dragon stirring in its slumber."
