'''Clarkswell''' was a small farming town in northern [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
Clarkswell laid fifty miles north of [[Arabel]], in the foothills of the [[Storm Horn Mountains]],{{Cite polyhedron/132/Audition|21}} and sustained itself on farming. Clarkswell was a small town of only several businesses and little trade to speak of.{{Cite polyhedron/132/Audition|24}}

The [[Town Square]] laid at the village's center, on [[Market Way]]. A smithy, stables, and a general store surrounded the Town Square. The [[Cooked Goose Inn]] stood on the crossing of Market Way and [[Lynway]], just to the north, facing the Town Square. Further north, the next block was separated by [[Merdocks Street]]. This was where the leather goods store was found with the mage protector's tower across the street crossing. One block south from the Town Square stood the town's guardhouse and the mayor's manse.{{Cite polyhedron/132/Audition|26}}

==Government==
The town was governed by a mayor. Two other officials were the protector [[mage]] and the guard captain. [[Gladgo Haltok]], a retired [[adventurer]], was the kindly, well-liked lord-mayor in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. During the same time period, the title of the guard captain was held by [[Lyle Grobit]], an immensely strong but moody [[fighter]]. And lastly, [[Eloras]] was the town's introverted protector mage.

==Defenses==
Under guard captain Lyle Grobit's leadership, the town's guard company consisted of forty fighters and sixty trained civilian militiamen. Twenty of the guards were usually on patrol at the time.

==History==
Protector mage [[Eloras]] saved Clarkswell from monsters on three separate occasions before or in the mid-14{{th}} century DR. In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, a farmstead ten miles north of town was hit by a [[hill giant]] raid. Another event of note was a robbery of the lord-mayor's manse and the mage protector's tower by a group of [[adventurer]]s who pretended to be members of the nobility but, in truth, sought an acceptance into [[Brandon's Band of Thieves]] of Arabel.

==Notable Locations==
* Blacksmith's shop overlooking the Town Square, run by [[Mercer Strongson]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Cooked Goose Inn]], the only inn in town of note, managed by [[Markel Harkwhite]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR. The tavern served travelers, adventurers, merchants, and farmers and offered free lodgings and meals to visiting [[bard]]s. Markel's wife was the inn's cook and theorist two daughters, [[Sinali Harkwhite]] and [[Talli Harkwhite]], worked as servers.
* General store, owned by [[Mitzi Elder]], an eagle-eyed and pleasant woman, in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Leather Goods for All]], a leatherworker's workshop and store run by [[Jason Hetrick]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.
* Mayor's house, a large mansion, the biggest building in town.
* Stables on the Town Square, run by [[Norcal]], an avid smoker, in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.
* Wizard's tower, home of Eloras, the protector mage, consisted of only two rooms – a workroom on the first floor and the upper floor bedroom. His grandson's home stood across the street from the tower.{{Cite polyhedron/132/Audition|28}}

* [[Climm]], a jack of all trades and a Cooked Goose's regular patron in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.
