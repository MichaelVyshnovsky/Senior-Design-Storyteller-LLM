The '''Gritstone Moorland''' was a region of wetlands found on the eastern stretch of the [[Dragon Coast]] in the [[Eastern Heartlands]].{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}}

==Geography==
The region was formed at the confluence the [[Tun River]] and the [[Dragonmere]] lake, just south of the [[Storm Horns]] mountain range.

Passing through the Gritstone Moorland was the [[Overmoor Trail]], the path that connected the cities of [[Proskur]] and [[Elversult]].

==Notable Locations==
The only notable landmark in the moor was the [[Bloodtower]].
