The Inverted Tower was the center for the study of arcane magic in Szith Morcane. 
The stronghold was so named because of its unusual construction of rooms branching off from a tall, octagonal cavern. Without stairs connecting the various levels only those with capability to levitate or climb the smooth walls could navigate the Inverted Tower effectively.
Among the connecting rooms was a chamber for instructing students in the art of spellcraft and a room dedicated to the summoning of extraplanar creatures.
Boasting a complement of wizard fighters known as the Arcane Guard, the tower had additional protection in the form of a contingent guards and wards spell. This was keyed to activate whenever any creature entered the spire without speaking the password, "Bzadaara".
Despite the fall of House Morcane in 1372 DR and the decline of drow in the region after the Silence of Lolth, the Inverted Towers insular community remained largely unaffected by the turmoil.
