Mosstone was an enormous moss-covered rock found within Immil Vale in Rashemen.
Mosstone was a massive rock carved with runes, flowing like water, and thick curtains of mosses. The runes were weathered by time and elements and their design evoked feelings of fleeting memories and flowing dreams.
In the , famed Kalach-Cha and their companions, including Gannayev-of-Dreams, ventured into Immil Vale in search of the fabled Wood Man. Gann felt the stones connection to the Dreaming. He suggested the group rest in Mosstones shade and ride the currents of dreams with Ganns help to grasp a piece of the Spirit-Eaters history.
Anyone making camp in the shadow of Mosstone was visited with prophetic dreams while they slept. Some were even visited by the telthor Hulmarra Murnyetha, and, if they reminded her of her long-dead husband, some men were spirited away by Hulmarra to return years later without having aged at all.
