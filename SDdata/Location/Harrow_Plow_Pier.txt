}}'''Harrow Plow Pier''' was a small pier found on the south side of [[New Velar|Harrowdale]].

==Description==
Harrow Plow Pier was an extension of [[Cart Street]] from the town. As with most piers it was oriented perpendicular to the shore but was only large enough to dock several ships at a time.
