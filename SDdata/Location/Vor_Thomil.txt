Vor Thomil was a realm within the Feywild that was connected to Omans Isle in the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 century DR.
Vor Thomil was ruled by fomorians, the Queen of which was Connomae.
Excursions from Vor Thomil to Omans Isle were quite common as Queen Connomae wanted to capture a great number of slaves to use to assault the city of Shinaelestra in the Feywild.
