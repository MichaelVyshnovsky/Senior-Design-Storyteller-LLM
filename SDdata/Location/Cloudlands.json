        "mainbody": "he Cloudlands of Avaeraether were a fabled kingdom in the sky, said to have once existed above the Stonelands.\nAccording to Elminsters research, if the Cloudlands did in fact once exist then it would have been roughly 1,500 years prior to the midâ€“14 century DR.\nAvaeraether maintained trade links with the nearby realm of Tethyamar, buying metals from the dwarves.\nThe legends claimed that one day the mage rulers of the Netherese cities of Asram and Anauria discovered the Cloudlands and sought to conquer them, believing they could act as a safehaven from the ever-expanding Anauroch desert. Their efforts ultimately destroyed the kingdom and the enchantments of its clouds, causing its cities and fortresses to fall and become the many large rock formations that dot the plains of the Stonelands.\nOf those who believed in these legends, some thought that some of these enchanted castles in the sky still existed hidden in the clouds, inhabited by the sky-dwelling creatures seen in the Stonelands. Others claimed that lingering spells from this fabled war were the cause of the regions frequent terrible storms.\nLegends said that the Cloudlands were home to asperii, cloud giants, giant eagles, mist dragons, pegasi, silver dragons, storm giants, and sylphs. They were also said to be home to a race of winged, elf-like beings. All of these creatures were said to have lived in harmony and only descended to the surface when they needed to gather or trade food or other necessities. They generally avoided nearby human kingdoms, especially Asram.\nThe giants in particular were said to frequently take stone from the surface, using it to build the Cloudlands many cities and fortresses."
