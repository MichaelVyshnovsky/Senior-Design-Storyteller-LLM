        "mainbody": "he Sands of Itzcala was a massive desert in northern Maztica.\nThe Sands of Itzcala covered most of northern Maztica. Directly south of it were the nations of Kultaka, Huacli, and the Valley of Nexal. It stretched from the eastern coast to the western coast, and northwest of it was the Pasocada Basin.\nOlbi\n The ruined city of Olbi was older than even Tewahca. It was not as spectacular, but possessed secrets all its own. Olbi consisted of a series of clean, well-carved caverns with a variety of statues carved directly into the walls (representing the Maztican pantheon). The precision of the carvings showed evidence of metal tools or magical shaping, and treasures such as works of pluma, hishna, and gold could be found there.\nThe Sands of Itzcala was a harsh land, inhabited only by the Dog People, who lived a semi-nomadic existence in small tribes. They understood their land better than anyone else, and relied on it for protection against foreign enemies."
