        "mainbody": "ahabba, also called the City of Charity, was a major city found within the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nMahabba was founded along the banks of Al-Musammas River in the south-east of the Pantheist League at the edge of Al-Sayaj Mountains bordering the area of the Ruined Kingdoms.\nMahabba was the latest to join the Pantheist Cities, and though centuries passed, military forces kept occupying the city against the rebellions of the pre-Pantheon cult of the goddess Bala. Because of the resulting oppressive atmosphere, Mahabba recently was called the City of Silence more often than its former title, the City of Charity.\nMahabba was a closed society, especially compared to its closest Pantheist neighbor Hudid, occupied by its own military forces in an attempt to quickly quell any heretical Balanite uprisings. Armed checkpoints and patrols were a frequent site in the city. Caliph Mogan bin Ahmed was assassinated by Balanites in 1360 DR. The Balanite threat was so real that even the Grand Caliph in Huzuz urged Mahabbas caliph to end the heresy by either negotiations or the sword.\nMahabbas moniker of the \"City of Silence\" came about since music was rarely played after the uprisings began. After all, Balanties were believed to spread their evil lies through music. Bards were rarely welcomed in Mahabba. Even rawunin often reported to the local guard when entering the city to acquire armed bodyguards during their stay.\nMost of the citys residents were ashamed of their unenlightened past. Many natives were fearful by nature, both of strangers and even their own rulers.\nMahabbas caliph in 1367 DR was Mamum al-Sahnan.\nThe Sword of the True Gods kept 4,000 soldiers and 1,000 cavalry stationed in Mahabba. The city also maintained a watch of 2,000 guards and 50 clerical reserves. Mahabba did not have a formal navy as of 1367 DR. Before the rebellion Mahabba frequently sent long-ranging patrols beyond its walls."
