        "mainbody": "'''Cedarsproke''', sometimes referred to as '''Cedarspoke''', was a small, independent city in the middle of the [[Gulthmere Forest]] inhabited and ruled by [[druid]]s.",
        "Description": "Cedarsproke was considered a druid fortress that an invading force had never taken, and it was the only settlement in the Gulthmere Forest.",
        "Geography": "The [[Cedar River]] divided the city in two.",
        "Government": "Gulthmere Forest was ruled by a druidic circle of thirty-three members that met in Cedarsproke. The number of members never increased, and the membership rotated seasonally. The Grand Druid was the leader's official title and every word was the law. Any visitor who had unfavorable opinions of Eldath or Silvanus was recommended to keep them to themselves.",
        "Trade": "Merchants and traders occasionally used Cedar River to transport their goods into Cedarsproke; however, most unloaded their goods in the city of [[Starmantle]] to the west and traveled from there by land. The religious significance brought a high number of pilgrims to the druid stronghold every year, and many adventurers traveled to Cedarsproke in search of ancient lore and history. The volume of visitors gave rise to several businesses that catered to guests of Cedarsproke.",
        "History": "Cedarsproke was established ''circa'' [[200 DR]] by a druidic enclave dedicated to the worship of [[Silvanus]], the Forest Father.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|717}}, the neighboring kingdom of [[Turmish]] came to clash with the druid of Silvanus and the Emerald Enclave. [[The Windlass]], the [[wizard]]ly conclave that ruled Turmish at the time sent a part of their army to attack Cedarsproke. The troops never reached Cedarsproke as the agents of the Emerald Enclave decimated them as they moved through the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. This attack on the city led to the druids of Cedarsproke convinced the Church of Silvanus of distancing themselves from the Emerald Enclave to avoid future dangers. Following this, a powerful [[hierophant]] of the Enclave established a new base on the island of [[Iligh√¥n]].\n\nIn [[1196 DR]], the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]], ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', was delivered into the hands of the priest [[Klavaeron]] of Cedarsproke by the ranger [[Rhighaermon O'Antlers]] and his new wife [[Dathae]] of Essembra. The couple had traveled to the druid town while on their honeymoon.\n\nBy {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the druids of Cedarsproke were engaged in a \"pacifistic\" war against the cult of [[Malar]] that plagued the region. Even though the druids did not take aggressive moves against them, reserving to defensive actions, the Grand Druid offered a reward to adventurers willing to stand against the cult of the Bestlord.",
        "Notable Locations": "*The city was the home of [[Earthome College]], a famous school for druidic teaching as well as the repository of many tomes and documents about the history of the [[Vilhon Reach]] region.\n*[[The Hoe]] was a seedy tavern built on the lakeshore to cater to the town's visitors.\n*[[Silver Scythe (Cedarsproke)|Silver Scythe]] a posh inn near the temple of Silvanus.\n*[[The Grove]] was the major tempe of [[Eldath]] worshiping and was considered the headquarters of the [[Church of Eldath]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n*Worshiper of Silvanus had a major temple established within the city, neighboring the Silver Scythe inn.\n*Among minor religious locations within Cedarsproke was a shrine to [[Helm]], the Vigilant One.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Shiala Torthren]], one of the historians of the Earthome College.\n*[[Shinthala Deepcrest]], the Grand Cabal of the Emerald Enclave, was born in Cedarsproke in [[1320 DR]].\n*[[Shemratha Callingowl]], the leader of the Church of Eldath who resided in the city of Cedarsproke in the late 14{{th}} century DR."
