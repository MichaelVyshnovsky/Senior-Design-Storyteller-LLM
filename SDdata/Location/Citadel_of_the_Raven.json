The Citadel itself was the main feature of the stronghold, which rested in the center of 10 miles (16 km) of interconnected fortresses on the western end of the Dragonspines. It was a well-fortified and well-protected fortress.\n\nThe citadel supported a small community of refugees from [[Zhentil Keep]] around its outskirts. This was originally discouraged by the Zhentarim, though they later saw the benefits to controlling such a community.",
        "Structure": "The Citadel consisted of a 10-mile long string of forts and barracks carved into the side of the Dragonspine Mountains, connected by a series of tunnels, walkways and bridges. In [[1367 DR]], the following structures made up the whole of the Citadel from west to east:\n*Point Dusk: The westernmost fortress could house 200 soldiers and was haunted by the ghost of [[Galauntar Hawkhelm]].\n*Barracks: Fortified lodgings for soldiers were scattered along the chain between the forts, and could usually house 200 soldiers each.\n*Barracks\n*Raven Point: The oldest fort and most heavily decorated with ravens, it could hold 500 soldiers.\n*Breachward Point: A smaller fort that could hold 150 soldiers.\n*Barracks\n*Barracks\n*Mercenary Quarters: A smaller fortified lodging that was designated for the use of visiting mercenary companies, and could host 100 soldiers.\n*Central Keep: The central fortification controlled the mountain pass, processed caravans, housed the administration and trained recruits.\n**Manshoon's Annex: Well-appointed apartments and laboratories attached to the Keep were for Manshoon's use only.\n**Main Dungeon: The cells located underneath the Keep could hold up to 100 prisoners.\n**Burial Chambers: Huge caverns at the lowest level contained the fallen defenders of the Citadel.\n**Sealed Dwarves: A large chamber was sealed with 500 dwarves inside, now mummified.\n**The Unexplored: Ancient, unused chambers contained lost treasures and a passage to the Underdark.\n*Mercenary Quarters\n*Barracks\n*Mercenary Quarters\n*Bulwark Point: This fort bore high-quality dwarven stonework, and could hold 200 soldiers.\n*Barracks\n*Barracks\n*Point Dawn: The easternmost fort was dank, unpopular, and had a capacity of 500 soldiers.",
        "Inhabitants": "In 1367 DR, the Zhentarim garrison consisted of 2000 men-at-arms, 200 cavalry, 50 officers, and 300 support staff, with a total capacity to house more than 9000 if needed.\nNotable inhabitants of the Citadel included:\n*[[Galauntar Hawkhelm]]: The first commander of the Citadel, whose outraged ghost continued to haunt it.\n*[[Kandar Milinal]]: The master of the Citadel in 1367 DR, he was a tyrannical but effective leader.\n*[[Boruse Temlor]]: The [[Strifeleader]] of [[Cyric]] designated for the citadel.\n*[[Ampherd Holt]]: A battle-maddened war-priest of [[Tempus]] who was inexplicably popular with the troops.\n*[[Fesric]]: A charismatic young lieutenant who advocated revolting against weakened Zhentilar control.\n*[[Manshoon]]: The Lord of the Zhentarim would visit at times.\n*[[Sememmon]]: Manshoon would allow his subordinate access to the Citadel's resources.",
