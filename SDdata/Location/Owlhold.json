        "mainbody": "The realm was inhabited by simple Owlen folk who tried to live in harmony with the land and nature instead of trying to tame it. These [[human]]s were quiet, non-confrontational, and reserved, accustomed to their lives in a sparsely populated world. However, that did not mean Owlhold was safe for travelers. The territory was rich with bandit bands. When hostile individuals from the \"Wild Outside\" found a way into the homes of the Owlen folk, all they found were empty rooms, snuffed candles, and back doors wide open. Owlen took shelter in nearby woods and trees and were ready to shower near-do-wells at the first sign of ill intent.\n\nApart from humans, Owlhold was home to a significant number of [[elves]] and [[half-elves]]. Ancient [[undead]] also were known to gather around items and places of ancient magics in the land.\n\n===Notable Inhabitants===\n*[[Baeremyl Clathaderra]], a [[watchghost]] woman who owned nine powerful [[enchanted]] [[sword]]s from the lost city of [[Helbrester]].\n*[[Belomeier Tathchant]], a merchant of locks, lamps, and coffers from Jester's Hollow in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Erendin Speaker-for-Sabroar]], the chief [[cleric]] of Silvanus who lived in Sabroar's Hold in the late 14{{th}} century DR, assisted by clerics [[Snaruldar]] and [[Jessilleia]].\n*[[Imryn Roaringhorn]], a distantly related to [[Roaringhorn (Waterdeep)|Roaringhorns]] of [[Waterdeep]] master of Sabroar's Hold in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Jarvathra Ploorst]], the shopkeep of [[Talismans and Fortunes]] of Jester's Hollow in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Jestra Illowhand]], the proprietress of the Jester's Hollow who created a [[spell]] to capture sounds and music in small crystals, active in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Jlonkin]] the Bowyer, a half-elven family man from Fallenfalcon who lived in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Nressa]] the Weaver, a half-elf from Fallenfalcon who lived in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Ongolym Nlerreth]], a hermit [[archlich]] who commanded [[flying golem]]s, powerful exotic magics, and owned a small [[Netherese]] ''[[airship]]''.\n*[[Shassra Rurth]], also known as \"Darkeyes\", a server woman of the Wolf Belt in the late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Description": "Untamed lands, Owlhold was a spiderweb of veering paths that could easily leave even the most competent [[ranger]]s lost. The ever-present shade and dampness hid the region's main dangers: bogs and bandits. The region was dotted with small lone inns, single-home steadings, and sporadic waystables for travelers, equipped with freshwater pumps and small shack-sized taverns. The region possessed wild beauty seemingly unspoiled by civilization. Travelers familiar with Owlhold preferred to \"rough it and rush it\" across the wild territory.\n\nThe [[Longcrag Ride]] was a lively southern road with many pavilions open top travelers, but inns and taverns were ways off the road, hidden from the eyes of outsiders. Without a local guide, travelers were sure to miss most of the amenities along the Longcrag Ride.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "Owlhold was a wild territory of shaded thickets, rolling hills of hedges, woods, vines, and [[hanging moss]]. The realms was named after its large population of [[owl]]s who fed on vermin and small creatures that ran rampant as Owlen folk did not farm in the common sense of the word. While bogs were swarming with stinging insects and forests hid hungry wolves."
        },
        "Government": "Despite not having an official government, Owlhold supported the [[Faceless Master]]'s politics of keeping the city of Oeble independent. Together with the [[Barony of Great Oak]], Owlhold aided the Faceless Master against the Talduth Vale's attempts to annex Oeble ''circa'' the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite polyhedron/139/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|17}}",
        "Trade": "The Owlen lived via hunting and gathering. They collected a wide variety of local edible and medicinal berries, [[herb]]s, and [[moss]]es. One notable local product was a type of [[wine]] fermented from a special blend of local vegetation. It was popular for the throat-scorching flavor, and Owlen sold the libation or exchanged it for food to traveling merchants who dared to traverse the untamed realm. Experienced merchants did venture into the wilderness of Owlhold but always with a dozen of heavily armed hirelings.",
        "History": "Before Owlhold, the land belonged to a [[gnome]]ish kingdom of [[Oelerhode]], several thousands of years before the 14{{th}} century DR. With time, the gnome nation became arrogant and bloated, encroaching on the forests and caverns, above and below ground. The nation fell to a horde of ravaging [[orc]]s that left the kingdom a crumbling and blood-drenched ruin within a single [[tenday]]. Swiftly enough, the wilds reclaimed the ruins that crumbled under a slow onslaught of vines, elements, and decay. Some cellars and underground passages remained hidden, possibly filled with ancient treasures, but any sins of them on the surface were swallowed by nature.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century, Owlen became home to sporadic populations. Some retired adventurers, outlaws, and wizards searching for seclusion settled in the realm. Many of them settled in remnants of gnomish buildings, caverns, and spell-chambers.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1333}}, several caravans were sent into the land of Owlhold, but none of them made it back. Unfortunately, such events were quite common, some of them being nothing more than rumors, but at least two of such events definitely took place.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Fallenfalcon]], a pavilion and four cottages on the northern part of the Bowshot by a freshwater stream.{{Cite polyhedron/147/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|42-43}}\n*[[The Four Stags]] was a busy inn at the northern end of the Bowshot that served as the Owlen trading outpost.\n*[[The Griffon Aflame]] was a more secluded inn on the southern end of the Bowshot where the Owlen gathered, avoiding outsiders.\n*[[Hathlock's Rest]], an abandoned settlement north of the Trollhead Bridge with a single inn – [[Hathlock House]], open to travelers as of the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Jester's Hollow]], a habituated forest valley of the [[Laughing Lady Stream]] and its inn both shared the same name.\n*[[Sabroar's Hold]], a two-floor inn named after locally famous [[Sabroar]] of [[Silvanus]].\n*[[Trollhead Bridge]], a railless bride across a bog north of Fallenfalcon, a message-stone shaped like a [[troll]]'s head, and a sleeping pavilion available for travelers.\n*[[Wolf Belt]], a lone tavern-like establishment surrounded by wolf-infested woods further north of Hathlock's Rest, ran by [[Ueval Ringam]] and [[Ivver Ringam]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.",
