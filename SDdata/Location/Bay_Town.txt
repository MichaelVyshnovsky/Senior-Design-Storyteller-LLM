Bay Town was a small settlement found in Traders Bay in Impiltur.
Bay Town sat on the southeastern shore of Bluefang Water near the Uplands of Impiltur.
Although centrally located on a major waterway, Bay Town never gained any economic prominence, and was largely overshadowed by ports on the coast of the Easting Reach. Instead, Bay Town catered only to the dregs of society.
As of the mid-14 century DR, Bay Towns population was 1,750.
Bay Town was a haven for thieves, pirates and a slew of other unfavorable types. Among the major thieves guilds were the Silent Poniards and the Red Masks.
Aware that these seedy types of citizens would always carve their niche somewhere, the Lords of Imphras II preferred to at least have them all in one spot, especially one like Bay Town which happened to be rather insignificant.
Visitors to Bay Town had to be wary lest they end up shackled into slavery.
