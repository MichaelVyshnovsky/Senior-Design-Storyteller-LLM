        "mainbody": "Masulks Tomb was the burial place of Masulk the Magnificent located in the Far Forest in the Savage Frontier.\nThe tomb was hidden by trees, shrubs and climbing plants, so it was hard to locate.\nMasulk was a vizar stricken by a terrible and incurable disease. After he died, Masulks servants dug the tomb as ordered by the master himself, where his flying carpet came to rest. Masulk wanted to be buried with no coins, but with all the magic hed accumulated during his lifetime."
