Akota was a mysterious country somewhere beyond the western shores of Zakhara.
Akota exported gold, slaves, wood, and exotic goods to the Land of Fate through the city of Akota to the city of Tajar.
It had its own language called Akotan, which was also spoken in Zakharas western settlements that were conducting trade with exotic Akota.
