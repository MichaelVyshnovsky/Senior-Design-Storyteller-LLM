'''Edenvale Castle''' was a fortification in the kingdom of [[Edenvale]] in the [[Utter East]]. It was the seat of power of the rulers of Edenvale early in its history. It was also the name given to the lands to its southeast. It stood near [[Herne's Wood]] in the northern [[Sempadan Forest]].<ref group="note">Comparing the game map in ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' with standard maps of the region shows that the Edenvale Castle lies in the location described.

==Description==
[[File:Edenvale Castle.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to Edenvale Castle.]]
Edenvale Castle was a massive grand fortress built of white stone with golden cone-topped towers and high square crenellations on the battlements. The gates, gatehouses, and decks were made of wood. The whole castle stood atop a steep-sided island in a ravine through which water flowed. This which was crossed by a wooden bridge linking the southeast-facing main entrance and the road outside.
The lands to the southeast were largely idyllic green meadows with copses of bushes, flowers, and trees; patches of brambles; and small, blue ponds. A stream ran through the land, first tumbling over rocks before meandering northeast–southwest past the castle. A cobbled road ran around the area, with a bridge spanning the river.

==History==
The history of Edenvale Castle was often that of Edenvale itself. During the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]),<ref group="note">The events of ''Blood & Magic'' are only dated to "before the [[Time of Troubles]]" ([[1358 DR]]) in game. It is assumed these are a part of the Bloodforge Wars described in ''[[Faces of Deception]]'' and dated in ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]''. the lands southeast of Edenvale Castle were the site of [[bloodforge]] battles fought between Princess [[Roxanna of Edenvale|Roxanna]] and the suitors who sought to win her hand in marriage, in the conflict known as [[Matchmaker Mayhem]]. At one point, Roxanna might have bet the keys to the palace in a battle against [[Bryan the Bold]], or he might have assaulted the castle.

Edenvale Castle saw three more battles during the Bloodforge Wars. Afterward, it was in the grip of one [[Timmis Taern]]. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]], who sought to unify and pacify the Utter East through conquest, lured Timmis beyond the castle walls through trickery before striking in a bloodforge battle.

When a ruler of Edenvale passed away without an heir, the Legendary Campaign leader marched on Edenvale Castle to claim the throne. [[Madja Djiid]] contested this, and the two fought a bloodforge battle outside Edenvale Castle.

Following this, the Legendary Campaign leader was caught in a dragged-out conflict with [[Deliah Deguerre]]'s forces. The two armies raced to Edenvale Castle for reinforcement, but ended their rivalry before its walls.
