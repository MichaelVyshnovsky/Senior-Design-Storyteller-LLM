        "mainbody": "he Heart of Ubtao was an earthmote that hovered over the Aldani Basin in Chult. It was a sacred site for worshipers of Ubtao, the deity known as the Creator of Chult.\nThe earthmote earned its name from its shape that somewhat resembled a humanoid heart, with petrified tree roots that duplicated veins and arteries. Rainwater that filtered through deposits of iron became red in hue, resembling blood that dripped down to the jungle below.\nFaithful Chultans believed it was the actual heart of their patron deity.\nthumb|The Shrine of the Heart.\nSometime during the late 15 century DR, Valindra Shadowmantle and a group of Red Wizards settled in the Heart of Ubtao while they sought out the Chultan artifact known as the Soulmonger.\nWhile the hallow, petrified tree in the earthmote was naturally home to swarms of bats, the earthmote also housed a number of undead protectors, including a pair of zombified girallons."
