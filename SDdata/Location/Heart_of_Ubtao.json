        "mainbody": "The '''Heart of Ubtao''' was an [[earthmote]] that hovered over the [[Aldani Basin]] in [[Chult]]. It was a sacred site for worshipers of [[Ubtao]], the deity known as the Creator of Chult.",
        "Description": "The earthmote earned its name from its shape that somewhat resembled a [[humanoid]] heart, with petrified tree roots that duplicated veins and arteries. Rainwater that filtered through deposits of [[iron]] became red in hue, resembling blood that dripped down to the jungle below.\n\nFaithful [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]] believed it was the actual heart of their patron deity.",
        "History": "[[File:Shrine of the Heart.png|thumb|''The Shrine of the Heart.'']]\nSometime during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and a group of [[Red Wizard]]s settled in the Heart of Ubtao while they sought out the Chultan [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Soulmonger]]''.",
        "Inhabitants": "While the hallow, petrified tree in the earthmote was naturally home to swarms of [[bat]]s, the earthmote also housed a number of [[undead]] protectors, including a pair of [[zombified]] [[girallon]]s."
