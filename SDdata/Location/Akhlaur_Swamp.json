        "mainbody": "The Akhlaur Swamp, also called the Swamp of Ghalagar, was a wetland located west of Lake Halruaa and Halagard.\nThe swamp covered, as of 1373 DR, an oblong area roughly 4000 square miles (6437.3 sq km.). The Swamp of Akhlaur was filled with cypress trees, moss and assortment of fauna including crocodiles and dangerous piranha. Unnatural creatures such as undead were also present.\nLaraken also inhabited the swamp, making this a dangerous location for any spellcaster.\nThe swamp was named for the famed conjurer Akhlaur. It was believed he perished here when he was taken to the Elemental Plane of Water by a summoned laraken. The portal through which he disappeared remained open, allowing a constant flow of water to expand the swamp at a rate of an additional 100 ft. (30 m) per year. Akhlaurs Tower remained long after his passing.\nIn 1373 DR, the magehound Kiva managed to remove the portal from the swamp, successfully halting its advance.\nIn 1385 DR, the south of Halruaa was flooded because of the catastrophic Spellplague, connecting the swamp with the Great Sea."
