        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Nkonzi Maru.jpg|thumb|right|''Nkonzi of the Anaconda in Katashaka.'']]\nIt was the original home of several [[human]] tribes of the [[Chultan Peninsula]], including the [[Eshowe]], [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]], and [[Thinguth]].{{Cite dragon+/11/Lore You Should Know: Tabaxi vs. tabaxi}}\n\nThe [[Anaconda (organization)|Anaconda]] mercenary company originated in Katashaka. Led by [[Nkonzi Maru]], a [[ranger]], and [[Kwanza Maru]], a priest, they operated in the [[Heartlands]] of Faerûn in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nThe amazon marines that made up a large portion of the [[planes]]-sailing ''[[Ebony Queen]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew under [[Soot (captain)|Captain Soot]] were related to the Anaconda, and thus likely also hailed from Katashaka. These warrior women used similar tactics and weaponry.<ref group=\"note\">Although not specified, this connection suggests Captain Soot and ''Ebony Queen'' may originate in Katashaka too.\n\nThe mage [[Shalane]] hailed from Taerloon in Katashaka.

Ed would later introduce another southwestern continent, Arandron, which may be intended instead.",
        "Beliefs": "Around {{Yearlink|-3000}}, the ancient Tabaxi tribes of Katashaka worshiped a [[deity]] known as [[Olurobo]] and his children, called the ''nyama-nummo''. One ''nyama-nummo'' was [[Akongo]], a particularly perfidious entity dwelling in the southern highlands.The ''nyama-nummo'' are named after elements of the [[Wikipedia:Dogon religion|religion of the Dogon people of Mali]], with the concept of ''nyama'' (roughly, human nature) and the [[Wikipedia:Nommo|Nummo]] spirits or deities.\n\n[[File:Tarrasque.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''When the Sleeper awakes, hungry.'']]\nHowever, the greatest of the ''nyama-nummo'' was known as [[the Sleeper]]—the terrible [[tarrasque]]<ref group=\"note\">While the Sleeper is not defined in the text of the passage on page 30 of the ''The Grand History of the Realms'', the accompanying image shows a tarrasque, with the caption \"The Sleeper awakens\". However, the art in ''Grand History'' is all reused from prior sourcebooks and often inappropriate. Nevertheless, in the original fan-work ''A Grand History of the Realms'', an entity called \"Tarrasque\" who reigned over Katashaka is mentioned. Moreover, the name ''Tarasajok'' is suggestive of the tarrasque. Thus, it is assumed that a tarrasque, or something very like one, was indeed intended.—who dwelled in the Palace of the Alliz-Dren. She reigned over the lands of the Tabaxi and supposedly favored them over the other tribes. In turn, they chose one of their own at birth to be named ''Tarasajok'', meaning \"She Who Watches over the Sleeper\"—and who had the honor of being first to be eaten by her upon awakening on the next Night of Feasting.A Night of Feasting occurs at \"the millennium end\", suggesting they occur once every thousand years, but the sleep schedule of a tarrasque is generally noted to be unpredictable and more frequent.\n\nThere were also believed to be spirits.These spirits may be the same as the ''nyama-nummo''.\n\nThe Anaconda worshiped a [[snake]] god.",
        "History": {
            "Ancient History": "[[File:Merrouroboros.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A map of Merrouroboros, showing the part that would become Katashaka in the south-west.'']]\nDuring the ancient [[Days of Thunder]] ({{Yearlink|-30000}} to {{Yearlink|-35000}}), when the [[creator races]] reigned over [[Abeir-Toril]], the land that would become Katashaka was little touched by them. Instead, it was home to tribes of the first [[human]]s. At this time, the humans of Toril were still primitive, even ape-like, dwelling in caves and using simple tools.\n\nOver the millennia, Katashaka came to be home to nine distinct human tribes: the Tabaxi, the Eshowe, the Thinguth, and others.\n\nIn Tabaxi legend, one season, the Sleeper desired vengeance against an ancient enemy and summoned the greatest warriors of the nine tribes to follow her into battle in [[Mhairshaulk]] (c. {{Yearlink|-34800}} to c. {{Yearlink|-24000}}). Apparently defeated, the Sleeper returned in a rage, went on a rampage, and devoured four ''nyama-nummo'' on the Night of Feasting, before finally returning to sleep and recuperate in the Palace of Alliz-Dren. She would awaken twenty-three more times, and ever more angry and hungry.If this is every thousand years, then a span of 23,000 years is covered, and the battle occurred around {{Yearlink|-25800}}, which is within the time of Mhairshaulk when dominated by [[yuan-ti]].\n\nEventually, the continent of Katashaka was split from the former super-continent of [[Merrouroboros]] in the great cataclysm known as the [[First Sundering]], dated to around {{Yearlink|-17600}}. Faerûn and [[Maztica]] were separated in the same event.<ref> The Tabaxi of Katashaka called this the Great Rending.The date and meaning is ambiguous, but the \"Great Rending\" is believed to most likely refer to the break-up of the continents. An alternative is the splitting of the tribes departing for Chult later.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-3000}}, across the sea in Faerûn, the [[couatl]]s were dwindling in number and desired to halt the spread of the [[yuan-ti]] into the western end of the Chultan Peninsula. Searching for another people to take their place, the winged serpents eventually chose the humans of Katashaka, and went to them to preach of their god, [[Ubtao]]. The [[couatl]] [[Ecatzin]] came to the Tabaxi. Although initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of Akongo, some of the tribe gradually came to accept the couatl's words and to learn a little of its language, while a chosen few like [[Oyai]] even learned a forbidden [[magic]] called ''matumbe''. But they still dreaded the Sleeper's imminent awakening.\n\nFinally, on the next Night of Feasting at the end of a millennium, Ubtao blessed Oyai, naming her Negus Negusti and Bara, right before the Sleeper awoke with a roar and came to devour her. But she used the ''matumbe'' magic to halt, crush, and slay the Sleeper. That night, many liberated and joyous Tabaxi pledged themselves to Ubtao, as Ecatzin named them Ubtao's blessed children.<ref name=TGHotR-29-30/>\n\nSoon after, in {{Yearlink|-2809}}, peoples of the Tabaxi, Eshowe, Thinguth, and several others who'd accepted the faith of Ubtao went with the couatls in a great pilgrimage over the ocean in some 300 ''canoa'' (canoes). Landing on the Wild Coast, they journeyed into the Jungles of Chult and met their new god at the [[Peaks of Flame]]. They would go on to settle much of the peninsula, and having lived free of oppression, they inspired the neighboring [[Lapal]] tribes to revolt against the yuan-ti. Oyai's story of Katashaka would be recorded in the ''[[Teachings of Ubtao]]'', stored in the vaults of the Maze of Life in their new city, [[Mezro]].<ref name=TGHotR-29-30/>"
