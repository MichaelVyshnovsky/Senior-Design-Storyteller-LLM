            "Geographical Features": "The location's name was derived from its peculiar state of perpetual whiteout. This phenomenon was caused by the surrounding mountains trapping any wind moving over the valley from the west, which forced them into a swirling torrent that engulfed the entire region and churned its snow. These winds typically averaged {{SI|40|miles}} per hour and rarely dropped below {{SI|30|miles}}."
        },
        "History": "The [[Ice Spire ogre]]s were known to banish members of their tribe into the Eternal Blizzard, either for acts of betrayal or for violating their leaders' authority.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The Eternal Blizzard's unique phenomenon sparked many local myths and rumors over time. One legend claimed that a furious [[deity]] of snow lived within its center, while another told of a powerful [[tanar'ri]] being trapped within the gap\n\nOne rumor alleged that many of the Ice Spire ogres who were banished into the Eternal Blizzard had somehow survived. Supposedly, they had formed a sort of feral society that relied upon raiding [[human]] caravans and stealing from the various nearby [[giant]] steadings, but were very careful to cover their tracks."
