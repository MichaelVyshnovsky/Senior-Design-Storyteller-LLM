'''Koje''' was a small city in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It lay on the eastern side of [[Kang Bay]] in central Koryo.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}}<ref group="note">Like many sites in Koryo, this shares a name with a real-world counterpart: the city of [[Wikipedia:Geoje|Geoje]], which is also rendered as "Kŏje".

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Korax (shukenja)|a wandering shukenja]] placed a ''[[geas]]'' on the warrior [[Xax Chung]], commanding that he must look after and protect the people of the city of Koje until Jisziat's Tower was "cast to the ground". Xax could not be free until this came about. In the course of this duty, Xax saved Koje from a giant [[dragon turtle]], slew the [[tengu]] [[Kwi'asp]], and "tamed" the witch [[Zartalla]] before marrying her. He earned renown as the "hero of Koje".

Around 1357 DR, some twenty townsfolk were healed by a wandering [[shukenja]]. Although [[Korax (shukenja)|the healer did not give their name]], the people erected a monument in thanks regardless.

Finally, many years later, when Xax was an old man, Koje was assaulted by a [[dragon]], who tore down Jisziat's Tower. Xax battled the dragon, and died defending his adopted city. Revealed to be a [[Hare hengeyokai|hare]] [[hengeyokai]] at the end, he remained known as the hero of Koje.

==Locations==
A prominent local landmark was [[Jisziat's Tower]].

[[Merquam Pang]], one of the most prosperous merchants of Koryo, who lived in [[Xi Hulang]], owned a shop in Koje. It was heavily guarded by his hirelings.

==Notable Inhabitants==
The warrior Xax Chung was feted as the "hero of Koje" for his efforts in protecting the people of the city. He lived at a large cattle ranch about 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Koje with his family and servants.
