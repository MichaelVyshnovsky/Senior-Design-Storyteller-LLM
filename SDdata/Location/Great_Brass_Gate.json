        "mainbody": "he Great Brass Gate was the portal though which the noble efreeti Memnon entered the world of Toril to found his kingdom along the Sea of Swords.\nAfter the Great Pasha Memnon came with his followers through the portal, he established his capital city of Memnonnar around it. Thousands of years later, though the city had been razed, the portal still survived below the ruins.\nThe gate was a massive, 100-foot-diameter ring of solid brass suspended in the air. It acted as a permanent two-way portal between Memnonnar and the Elemental Plane of Fire.\nBy 1374 DR, unlike properly functioning portals, the Great Brass Gate leaked, and this resulted in fiery conditions around it. All of the caverns and tunnels in the ruins around it glowed from heat and the air was filled with smoke.\nThe Great Brass Gate was guarded at all times by a loyal efreeti named Ufbrann, who had sworn to defend the gate until his death. He only permitted creatures with fiery bloodlines to pass.\nCategoryLocations in Memnonnar\nCategoryLocations in Memnonnar (country)\nCategoryLocations in Calimmon\nCategoryLocations in Ankaram\nCategoryLocations in Ankramir\nCategoryLocations in Tethyr\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryPortals\n378h7x676coox1z15rqazq5ojdy3zce"
