        "mainbody": "Fireforges was a realm of industrious dwarves in east Faer√ªn, home to the Arforge, Hulhammer, and Tamstone clans.\nThe realm lay in the roots of Mount Thulbane, extending beneath parts of Threskel and Chessenta. The region was highly volcanic, with warm and humid caverns, magma rivers, and dangerous gas pockets.\nAs of the 15 century DR, the clans of Fireforges mined widely and aggressively, coming into conflict over mining claims with Khaelud to the south. The clans took advantage of the volcanism to power their smelting and forging, producing great amounts of metalwork that they exported."
