The area of '''southeast [[Zakhara]]''' was also the eastern portion of the [[Crowded Sea]]. It contained a number of small islands, but was dominated by the two large isles of [[Harab]] and [[Bariya]]. Both of them featured a number of mountain chains, while much of their lowlands were covered in jungle.

It was bordered by the archipelagos of [[Nada al-Hazan]] and the [[Steaming Isles]] in the west, the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms area]]—specifically the [[Grey Jungle]] on the mainland and the islands of [[Sahu]] and [[Afyal]]—in the north, and the [[Foreigners' Sea]] in the east. In the [[South Zakhara|south]], only the mysterious [[Islands of the Utter South]] lay beyond this area.

Though a remote region, southeast Zakhara was connected by sea trade routes to Afyal, [[Dihliz]], and the [[Cities of the Pantheon]]. It exported exotic goods like tropical wood, [[spices]], and feathers.<ref>
