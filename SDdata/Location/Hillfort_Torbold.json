        "mainbody": "Hillfort Torbold was one of the southern fortifications of Amn, part of a chain including Hillfort Ishla and Hillfort Keshla.\nThe forts structures were made of logs sealed with mud batting, and required constant maintenance. In addition to the lodgings for hundreds of troops, Keshla held an armory, a combined blacksmith-stables, a dedicated herbalist, a tailor, two general supply shops, and a large garden that supplied food for the garrison. The well-appointed fort also contained the inn Bruders Waystop, and a temple of Helm, the Hall of the Guardians.\nWith the influence of Major Tharundar Olehm, the forts garrison kept the fort in top condition. The hard-working soldiers kept it clean and well-maintained, and the forts towers were decorated with proud banners.\nTorbold was the middle of the three Hillforts, at the intersection of the South Road and Olehms Passage in the central Tejarn Hills. It was a common waystop between Amn and Tethyr, and the secret Dark Redoubt lay just south of the road halfway to Hillfort Keshla.\nthumb|250px|Torbold was one of three similar hillforts in the Tejarn Hills.\nLike the other Hillforts, Keshla had a more primitive and old-fashioned construction than the more modern Cloud Peaks citadels. The fort crowned a hill and had an outer palisade and oft-flooded ditch ringing it, with the main structure made of  tall,  thick log walls reinforced with earthworks, as well as some towers and a central keep.\nThe Hillfort was garrisoned by the Council Army on behalf of Amns Council of Six. It had a normal complement of 300 soldiers, 15 officers, and the commander. It had enough spare room to host 500 more within its walls. Under the leadership of Major Olehm, the soldiers became extremely well-trained and hardened by battle. Major Olehm ensured that his soldiers survived despite the odds, and so they developed a strong loyalty and devotion towards him, though this dismayed the Council of Six. The Council feared that Major Olehm was building a cult of personality and an army to rebel against Amn, and so limited his reinforcements to the bare minimum of new graduates from the Golden Fortress, rather than the larger force that his war with the Skullgnashers would warrant.\nTorbold was built on the foundations of a long-gone pre-Shoon structure, likely part of the same network as the Nine Sentinels. Despite being an important fort on the southern border, the Council refused to release the funds needed to make Torbold more habitable or defensible, and so the garrison had to deal with an earth and log structure that required constant maintenance.\nIn the , Major Tharundar Olehm won his assignment to the hillfort, as he sought to reform Amns defenses personally. At the time the fort had recently come under attack from the Skullgnasher hill giants led by the cunning Chief Fedduk, and the garrison had already fought off seven direct attacks in the first 18 months of battle. Major Olehm set about training the already-hardened troops into an elite force, and had them construct the Olehm Passage south to the Tethir Road in order to build up their strength and improve his ability to manoeuvre in the hills. Despite a lack of support from the Council, Ishla, or Keshla, the Army garrison skirmished and counter-raided the Skullgnashers, turning defeats into stalemates and stalemates into victories. They also scouted out the surrounding hills extensively, giving them a level of expertise with the terrain that matched that of the giants, as well as hunting down and destroying the various caves and lairs the giants had used in the area.\nBy 1370 DR, the garrison had almost entirely pushed the Skullgnashers out of the Tejarn Hills, and the giants were largely limited to their bases in the Small Teeth. That year, the city of Riatavin declared independence from Amn and won support from Tethyr, and the Council Army was mobilized to retake it with force. The army assembled under General Labak Craumerdaun in Hillfort Keshla to prepare for the attack on Riatavin, but at the same time the Sothillisian War was launched, with Hillfort Ishla, Gambiton, and Esmeltaran quickly overrun. Messengers from Keshla arrived on Eleasis 12 and summoned a third of the Torbold garrison to join them, but later the same day riders from Esmeltaran arrived and shared the news of the unfolding war. Major Olehm sent this news onwards to catch up with his own troops and those at Keshla, and prepared for the war to come. The report arrived at Keshla two days later, and half of the assembled troops marched with General Craumerdaun west to Torbold, arriving on Eleasis 18, and then on to Esmeltaran. Major Olehm was left in command of the region in order to gather up forces, and proceeded to work alongside the forces of the Citadel of the Banner, and also Logan Coprith of Trademeet. A scout reported on the threat to Murann on Eleasis 20, and Major Olehm set about calling up the forces at Keshla, though many of the officers there were frozen in place and did not respond. Their forces only started moving three days later when their own underofficers threatened a mutiny, and the combined forces finally reached Trademeet on Eleasis 26."
