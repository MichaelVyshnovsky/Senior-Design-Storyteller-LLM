The '''Bottomless Bogs''' were an extensive area of of cold swampland, foul mires, and smelly lakes in northwestern [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}} 

==Description==
The Bogs were a swampland that had been left behind as the [[Great Glacier]] retreated northwards. More dangerously, summer also brought on the "bottomless bogs" from which the region earned its name: insidious pits of sucking mud that could entrap the unwary.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}

Using an experienced guide while traversing the area was highly recommended.

==Geography==
The community of [[Moortown]] was located in the southern of the Bogs. There was also a small community called [[Modurt]] located on the western edge. [[Dead Man's Walk]], the main trade route through Vaasa, passed through the Bogs.

===Geographical Features===
The bowl-like area of the Bogs was bordered on the east by the [[Lugsaas Chain]] of mountains, and on the west by the [[West Galena Mountains]]. [[Mirror Lake]] and the open tundra below the Great Glacier marked the northern boundary, while the south and southeast abutted the highlands of central Vaasa.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} The western edge of the Bogs lying near the Galenas was sometimes called the '''Mountainshadow Bog'''.

There were several open bodies of water in the Bogs, such as [[Lake Throm]] and [[Moloth Caldera]], The [[Beaumaris River]] ran southeast from Mirror Lake through the western part of the Bogs until reaching the [[Clefts of Razack]].

===Flora & Fauna===
During the summer months, the Bogs were filled with the smell of rotting trees and vegetation,{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|59}} and the occasional sweet scent of the carnivorous [[giant sundew]] plant.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|57}}

The Bogs were home to [[boar]]s, [[swamp deer]], [[Giant leech]]es, [[giant rat|rodents of unusual size]], [[troll]]s, venomous [[snake]]s, and [[wolves]].{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|62}} The buzzing of [[mosquito]]es and flies was constant, along with that of [[giant wasp]]s and [[giant boring beetle]]s.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|61}}

==Inhabitants==
The only major [[Vaasan]] settlement within the swampland was [[Moortown]], although it frequently came under attack from the local monsters of the Bogs and had been abandoned and reclaimed several times.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} These monsters were the true inhabitants of the Bottomless Bogs, most notably the so-called [[kopru|bog people]]&mdash;who could swam through the mud&mdash;and the [[Ring-nose]] [[orc]] tribe, both of whom were known for laying ambushes for travelers along Dead Man's Walk.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|59}} Additionally, anyone traveling through the western Mountainshadow Bog had to beware of the so-called [[dragonkin|dragonmen]] who watched the Bogs from the mountains and would swoop down to attack caravans, thus leading the locals to dub this stretch of the Galenas  as the "Peaks of the Dragonmen."

==Notable Locations==
* [[Lake Throm]]
* [[Moloth Caldera]]/[[Hot Springs (Vaasa)|Hot Springs]]
* [[Moortown]]: The only settlement, which was often overrun and abandoned before being resettled.
* Abandoned [[wizard]] tower: This location was just a handful of mud-covered stones on the southwestern edge of the Bogs by the late 15{{th}} century DR, but it contained a functioning ''[[teleportation circle]]''.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|8}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Over the centuries, many explorers lost their lives looking for mythical hot springs deep within the Bogs. The waters of these springs were said to rejuvenate and enhance the body, or even to grant wishes.
