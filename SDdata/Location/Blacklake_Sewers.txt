The '''Blacklake Sewers''' were the sewer system beneath the [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]].

==Geography==
Most of the sewer system of Neverwinter was destroyed during the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]], as many buildings collapsed over their foundations, leaving a maze of precarious wreckage and treacherous tunnels. The Blacklake Sewers survived the Ruining mostly unscathed, however.

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], the [[Dead Rats]] cell of Neverwinter had taken control of most of the sewer system of the Blacklake District.

==Notable Inhabitants==
