        "mainbody": "Sudrav was a small mining town found in the farthest southern reaches of Arcata in Damara.\nSudrav was nestled with the Earthwood forest at the foot of the Earthspur Mountains.\nDisgusted by the politics of Damara, inhabitants despised Duke William and were not afraid to burn his effigies. Inhabitants of Sudrav considered themselves more politically aligned with Impiltur. They even went so far as to secretly ask Impiltur to annex their town. Though Imphras II refused the request, he did promise aid if needed."
