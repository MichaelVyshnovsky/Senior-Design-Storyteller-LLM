At least one person in  had brought a footstool. At least one of the tapestries had a window behind it.\nAcross from the doors was the Pool of Remembrance, above which floated the Throne of the Coronal.\nThere were wards, that would, amongst other things, prevent a dragon from being summoned.\nCourtiers usually remained at both sides of the room, while armathors stood watch by the door.\nIn , the Chamber of the Court was visited by Lords Haladavar, Urddusk, and Malgath, who after threatening violence, were informed of the plans to raise a Mythal.\nThe chamber was the site of a coup attempt by Llombaerth Starym in , which was followed immediately by the raising of the Mythal."
