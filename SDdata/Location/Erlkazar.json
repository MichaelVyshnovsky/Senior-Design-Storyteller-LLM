        "mainbody": "'''Erlkazar''' was a small kingdom located due east of [[Tethyr]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]].",
        "History": "The land was originally untamed wilderness. [[Karazir Tiiraklar]] of [[Tethyr]], the consort of Queen [[Vajra Korrunhel]], and his brother [[Ellessor Tiiraklar|Ellessor]] mustered an army and marched on this land. In the {{YearlinkName|309}}, Ellessor became the first duke of '''Elestam'''. When [[Shoonach]] fell, however, the lands reverted back to wilderness. King [[Strohm II]], after defeating [[Tathtar]]'s invading army, claimed Elestam as part of Tethyr in the {{YearlinkName|731}}.\n\nNothing much of note occurred in the duchy until the time of the persecutions of the [[elves]], which left Duke [[Valon Morkann]] torn. He supported the elves but was loyal to the crown. In the end, his loyalty won out and he kept the disputed trade routes open. Loyalty would play an important role during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] as well. During the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Ten Black Days of Eleint|Ten Black Days of Eleint]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, the political situation forced Morkann to accept the treacherous nobles in the realm who were allied to the tyrannical [[Nivedann Illehhune|Duke of Dusk]], even after four separate attempts on his life sponsored by them were foiled only by Morkann's friends in [[Elestam's Crusaders]]. Though his people were loyal to Morkann, they despised the other nobles, a fact Morkann hadn't grasped until they rose up in rebellion against them. All of these traitors fled the duchy rather than face arrest by the duke or murder at the hands of the peasants.\n\nOver [[1348 DR|the next year]], Morkann fortified the duchy's borders and built up his armed forces until his people petitioned him to declare himself king over the region. He accepted and officially seceded from Tethyr, choosing to rename the land Erlkazar and rule directly, rather than through barons and counts. Erlkazar survived the Interregnum unscathed, though they were plagued with [[vampire]]s and [[dragon]]s throughout. The realm survived through Elestam's Crusaders and the [[Emerald Brotherhood]], even though the Brotherhood disappeared in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}. The {{YearlinkName|1358}}, saw an attack from the [[goblin]] hordes of King [[Ertyk Uhl]] down from the [[High Peaks|High]] and Kuldin Peaks that lasted nearly the entire year. For over three months the goblins laid siege to the city of [[Duhlnarim]] until Elestam's Crusaders forged an alliance with the [[Shieldbreakers|Shieldbreaker ogres]]. The war turned and the goblins were cut down to a third of their number (according to reports, the horde had regained its strength by [[1367 DR]] but didn't attack Erlkazar like that again).\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, King Valon died, appointing his son [[Korox Morkann|Korox]], the leader of Elestam's Crusaders, to succeed him. Korox appointed the other four Crusaders as his barons, who ruled justly over Erlkazar for the rest of their reigns. Out of the way and well fortified, Erlkazar still maintained good trade arrangements with many other countries, though their trade routes became infested with bandits over the years.\n\n[[Saestra Karanok]] of [[Luthcheq]], who was driven from her home sometime after [[1373 DR]] when it was discovered that she was a vampire, traveled to Erlkazar and converted the massed bandits into her own personal army, who suddenly ceased their raids on the traders. She seduced the king at the time and turned him into a vampire after gaining the cooperation of the four barons with threats and manipulation. During the day, Erlkazar was a peaceful, sleepy land of farmers and hillfolk, much as it has been for decades, but at night, Saestra's bandit army emerged from the deep cavern she found beneath Ahlarkhem. They raided all of the countries that bordered Erlkazar, most often at midnight, provoking angry nobles to bring invading armies across the border, only for them to leave again when they found absolutely nothing but pastoral villages.\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], the vampires and bandits of Erlkazar still raided [[Amn]], [[Calimshan]], Tethyr, and [[Turmish]] and their lair, to those that knew about it, was called the [[Night Barony]].",
        "Life and Society": "''Circa'' 1479 DR, when under vampire rule, life in Erlkazar was slow and steady. The people treated each other informally and seemed to disregard most visitors until they had shown that they deserved respect. Communities outside the towns and cities were invariably small and pastoral, populated with tough folk. When night fell, everybody retreated to their homes, trying in vain to ignore everything outside their homes' walls.",
        "Geography": {
            "Baronies": "* [[Shalanar]]: [[Llorbauth]] was once the capital city of the realm. Its population of 28,000 [[Shalane]] was a fishing town renowned as having had the best shipwrights in the land.\n* [[Ahlarkhem]]: [[Duhlnarim]] was a major port city. Under the vampires, the people became paranoid and nervous. They looked no-one in the eye and were very wary of strangers.\n* [[Carrelath]]: [[Tibold]] was the baronial seat of Carrelath. It was a mining town in the western Kuldin Peaks, just south of the [[Swimstar Creek]] headwaters. From outside the place seemed small, but a third of the town extended underground into caverns that were once a [[dwarf|dwarven]] stronghold of [[High Shanatar]] built nearly 5000 years prior to 1374 DR. After the founding of Erlkazar more and more dwarves came to live there and they were the most outspoken about rejecting their vampire ruler.\n* [[Tanistan]]: [[Five Spears Hold]] was the baronial seat of Tanistan. It was a large mining settlement in the least populated (and mostly pastoral) barony.\n* [[Impresk]]: The northernmost barony, somewhat rebellious against the vampires. [[Carradoon]] was a small town that primarily subsisted on the fishing of the Impresk Lake."
