        "mainbody": "A range of unnamed cavernous hills that sporadically shifted between the Domains of Dread and the Prime Material world of Toril. They were home to a monstrous race of bat-like humanoids simply called the bat-people.It is not specified exactly where in the Domains of Dread that the hills originate. \nThis range of hills were rather low in size. On them stood a magical stone statue which nearly blocked the entrance to their caves, serving both as a warning to travelers against entering as well as enticement to enter them. It depicted a horrid woman with thin bony hands, a glaring twisted face, and outspread bat wings that extended from her back. One of the statues hands rested on the shoulders of a humanoid figure, which magically took the form of whomever was the last person to enter the caves. The humanoid figures stone stretched and flowed in a disturbing way whenever it changed, causing nausea in any who witnessed its transformation, but made no sound.\nTheir cave complex was said to run deep beneath the earth, There they kept a sacrificial altar and some large piles of treasure. Most of this treasure was composed purely of mundane wealth, though some magical items could be found mixed in.\nThe caves themselves had some sort of ambient effect in them that distorted magic. In some cases spells would fail to cast while inside of them and the caves would then fire off a random spell of similar power back at the caster. If a spell did manage to cast, its target could potentially be altered and its power either amplified or de-amplified. In some cases, they could amplify a spell to be so powerful that its casting caused the spellcaster and their allies to be teleported outside of the caves.\nThese hills always appeared in the Vast region of north Faer√ªn, though at a different spot each time. Whatever land and people were present in the spot the hills manifested upon would be temporarily displaced into the Domains of Dread.\nAt some point in the 12 century DR,The module states that \"The bat-people story is over 200 years old...\", indicating that it had to have occurred in the 12 century DR at the earliest. a pair of adventurers in the Vast by the names of Alkazar and Vreejin awoke one morning to find these hills had appeared next to them overnight and decided to venture into them. Soon after they were set upon by the bat-people and brought to a large cavern full of treasure where Vreejin nearly died of fright from them. The bat-people tied both adventurers to a bloody altar, intending to sacrifice them to their evil deity. Using a high-pitched whistling technique Alkazar paralyzed their captors, giving him the opportunity to break free and drag his companion to safety outside the caves. The two went on to spread their story around, leading many groups of adventurers to venture to where they had seen the hills, though when they got there the hills had vanished.Not all details of this story can be considered accurate, as Professor Wu Ling later admits that \"...he made up some of the story details[,] because audiences loves details.\" Though it is not specified exactly what details Wu Ling had embellished.\nLater in the 14 century DR, Professor Wu Ling recounted this story to a group of adventurers in Ravens Bluff as part of his Magic Lantern Show. He claimed to have been told it by the adventurers themselves and that the caves were very near the city, occasionally following a cart path that wound through the eastern farmlands, and eventually reached the caves at around 1130.\nThe next morning the adventurers received a letter from Tevlo Splath of Spath Investigations, inviting them to meet at The Muse at around 8 bells.\nSome speculated that the Dark Powers might be responsible for the shifting nature of the caves, possibly as some ploy to draw more unwary people into the Domains of Dread."
