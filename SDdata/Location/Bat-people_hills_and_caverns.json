        "mainbody": "A range of '''unnamed cavernous hills''' that sporadically shifted between the [[Domains of Dread]] and the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]]. They were home to a monstrous race of [[bat]]-like [[humanoid]]s simply called the [[bat-people]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|9}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"location\">It is not specified exactly where in the Domains of Dread that the hills originate.",
        "Description": "This range of hills were rather low in size.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|11}} On them stood a magical stone statue which nearly blocked the entrance to their caves, serving both as a warning to travelers against entering as well as enticement to enter them. It depicted a horrid woman with thin bony hands, a glaring twisted face, and outspread bat wings that extended from her back. One of the statue's hands rested on the shoulders of a humanoid figure, which magically took the form of whomever was the last person to enter the caves. The humanoid figure's stone stretched and flowed in a disturbing way whenever it changed, causing nausea in any who witnessed its transformation, but made no sound.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|12}}\n\nTheir cave complex was said to run deep beneath the earth,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|12}} There they kept a sacrificial altar and some large piles of treasure. Most of this treasure was composed purely of mundane wealth, though some [[magical item]]s could be found mixed in.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|13}}\n\nThe caves themselves had some sort of ambient effect in them that distorted [[magic]]. In some cases [[spell]]s would fail to cast while inside of them and the caves would then fire off a random spell of similar power back at the caster. If a spell did manage to cast, its target could potentially be altered and its power either amplified or de-amplified. In some cases, they could amplify a spell to be so powerful that its casting caused the [[spellcaster]] and their allies to be ''[[teleport]]ed'' outside of the caves.",
        "Geography": "These hills always appeared in [[the Vast]] region of [[north Faerûn]], though at a different spot each time. Whatever land and people were present in the spot the hills manifested upon would be temporarily displaced into the Domains of Dread.",
        "History": "At some point in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|10}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"dating\">The module states that \"The bat-people story is over 200 years old...\", indicating that it had to have occurred in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]] at the earliest. a pair of [[adventurer]]s in the Vast by the names of [[Alkazar]] and [[Vreejin]] awoke one morning to find these hills had appeared next to them overnight and decided to venture into them. Soon after they were set upon by the bat-people and brought to a large cavern full of treasure where Vreejin nearly died of fright from them. The bat-people tied both adventurers to a bloody altar, intending to sacrifice them to their [[evil]] [[deity]]. Using a high-pitched whistling technique Alkazar paralyzed their captors, giving him the opportunity to break free and drag his companion to safety outside the caves. The two went on to spread their story around, leading many groups of adventurers to venture to where they had seen the hills, though when they got there the hills had vanished.Not all details of this story can be considered accurate, as Professor Wu Ling later admits that \"...he made up some of the story details[,] because audiences loves details.\" Though it is not specified exactly what details Wu Ling had embellished.\n\nLater in the 14{{th}} century DR, Professor Wu Ling recounted this story to a group of adventurers in [[Ravens Bluff]] as part of his [[Wu Ling's Magic Lantern|Magic Lantern Show]]. He claimed to have been told it by the adventurers themselves and that the caves were very near the city,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|10-11}} occasionally following a cart path that wound through the eastern farmlands, and eventually reached the caves at around 11:30.\n\nThe next morning the adventurers received a letter from [[Tevlo Splath]] of [[Spath Investigations]], inviting them to meet at [[The Muse]]{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|30}} at around 8 [[Bell (time)|bells]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Goodly Apple|12-14}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some speculated that the [[Dark Powers]] might be responsible for the shifting nature of the caves, possibly as some ploy to draw more unwary people into the Domains of Dread."
