        "mainbody": "Thasunta, also known as the City of Warriors or the City of Berserkers, was a bustling settlement in Rashemen that served as the home to many of its famous Rashemaar berserkers.\nThe citys position at the juncture between the two major roads passing through Rashemen made it an ideal location to mobilize military forces. It lay at the intersection of the Golden Way and the road that ran north to Mulptan.\nThasunta was not directly governed by the Iron Lord directly, but rather by the most venerated of Rashemens berserker lodges, the Old Lodge. This select order took its members only from amongst the nations wisest and most battle-hardened warriors.\nDuring many months of the year Thasunta was not much more than a stopping place for farmers and merchants to sell their wares while traveling along Golden Way.\nDespite its seemingly mundane nature, Thasunta actually housed over hundreds of berserkers that hailed from a dozen of the nations major lodges. Throughout Rashemens history, these berserkers defended their nation against invasion forces dispatched by the malevolent southern nation of Thay.\nThe berserkers of Thasunta were vital to Rashemens victory at the Battle of the Lake of Tears against the Grand Army of the Tuigan in the .\nIn the , the forces of Thasunta underwent plans to invade the hills of the High Country and drive out its population of monstrous humanoids.\nRegardless of the typical dislike of cities by the Rashemaar, citizens of Thasunta were held in high-regard if for no other reason that they were all believed to be some manner of berserker warrior. While this was a mere exaggeration the residents of Thasunta did little to dissuade others of its belief.\nThe city was home to the great ale-hall of the White Dragon lodge, the largest one of its kind in all of Rashemen."
