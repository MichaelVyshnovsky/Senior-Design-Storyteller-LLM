        "Geography": "The Merchant Square was located in Neverwinter's [[Tower District]].",
        "History": "In the years prior to the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, the Merchant Square was a marketplace where merchants from all across the [[Sword Coast]] came to do business. The amount of [[money]] exchanged daily nearly rivaled the markets of [[Waterdeep]].\n\nAfter the volcanic eruption, the area was abandoned and came to be infested with [[elemental weevil]]s. The vast wealth of the merchants was swiftly pillaged by [[bandit]]s.\n\nAs of {{Yearlink|1479}}, the Merchant Square had come to be occupied by [[orc]]s from [[Many-Arrows]], who clashed for control of the Tower District with the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. At the same time, a cell of [[Nasher]] rebels took up residence in the sewers, led by the [[half-orc]] [[Karr Nevrim]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Merchant Guild Hall]], a once-extravagant building where merchant leaders would meet in the years prior to the cataclysm.\n* The Merchant Square sewers,  which were badly damaged and partly collapsed after the eruption, but served as a hideout for bandits and rebels into the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
