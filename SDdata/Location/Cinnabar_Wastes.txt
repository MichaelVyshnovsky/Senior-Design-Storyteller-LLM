The Cinnabar Wastes was a region of cold and arid badlands in northeast Vaasa. It was named for the reddish color of the local rock formations.
The Wastes were located in the Vaasan central highlands. They were north of Telos City and the Clefts of Razack, and south of Castle Perilous and the Lugsaas Chain mountains. The region was crossed by a trail called The Reach.
The region was characterized by badlands, steep-sloped striated rock formations carved by the advancing and retreating of the Great Glacier. The rock of the area was distinctly reddish in color, varying from bright blood-red to dark purplish. The whole area was littered with massive boulders and fields of broken rocks and gravel.
As a stretch of badlands, nothing of note grew in the area. 
This region of central Vaasa had a reputation for being home to nothing but foul monsters. It was home to bulettes and chromatic dragons as well as many of the other cold-weather creatures common across northern Vaasa, including winter wolves, glacier snakes, white puddings, moon dogs, and yeti.
As with most regions in Vaasa, goblinoids and giantkin made their homes in the area. A tribe of fog giant nomads hunted in the Wastes and had found a way to tame the local bulettes.
