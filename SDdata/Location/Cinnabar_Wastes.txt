The '''Cinnabar Wastes''' was a region of cold and arid badlands in northeast [[Vaasa]]. It was named for the reddish color of the local rock formations.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}

==Geography==
The Wastes were located in the Vaasan central highlands. They were north of [[Telos City]] and the [[Clefts of Razack]], and south of [[Castle Perilous]] and the [[Lugsaas Chain]] mountains. The region was crossed by a trail called [[Reach (trail)|The Reach]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

===Geographical Features===
The region was characterized by badlands, steep-sloped striated rock formations carved by the advancing and retreating of the [[Great Glacier]]. The rock of the area was distinctly reddish in color, varying from bright blood-red to dark purplish. The whole area was littered with massive boulders and fields of broken rocks and gravel.

===Flora & Fauna===
As a stretch of badlands, nothing of note grew in the area. 

This region of central Vaasa had a reputation for being home to nothing but foul monsters. It was home to [[bulette]]s and [[chromatic dragons]] as well as many of the other cold-weather creatures common across northern Vaasa, including [[winter wolf|winter wolves]], [[glacier snake]]s, [[white pudding]]s, [[moon dog]]s, and [[yeti]].

==Inhabitants==
As with most regions in Vaasa, [[goblinoids]] and [[giant|giantkin]] made their homes in the area. A tribe of [[fog giant]] nomads hunted in the Wastes and had found a way to tame the local bulettes.
