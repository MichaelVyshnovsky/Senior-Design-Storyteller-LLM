'''Inupras''' was the capital of the [[Imaskari Empire]] between {{Yearlink|-7975}} and {{Yearlink|-6422}},<ref name ="TGHotR-18" /> and again between {{Yearlink|-3920}} and {{Yearlink|-2488}}.

==Geography==
At the time of its construction, Inupras stood on a plain. However, after −2488 DR, the surrounding region had become the [[Raurin|Raurin Desert]].

==Defenses==
While the Imperial City was razed in −2488 DR, the Palace of the Purple Emperor survived the battles, most likely because of powerful wards.

Imaskari cities were often built of a purple stone from the Raurin mountains, which was naturally extremely resilient. The [[Imaskari artificer]]s were known for their use of portals and extradimensional spaces, which were a common means of transportation in their cities, as well as tactically exploited.

==History==
Inupras was established as the capital of the Imaskari Empire by Lord [[Umyatin]] when he ascended to the throne as Lord Artificer in −7975 DR, and it continued to be the capital until −6422 DR, when it was razed by rampaging [[krakentua]]s that emerged from the Temple of the Gaping Maw in the middle of the city; because of the location, public opinion blamed the Cult of [[Demogorgon]]. This event would precipitate the split into Upper and Lower Imaskar.<ref name ="TGHotR-18" />

It was refounded by Lord [[Omanond]] in −3920 DR during the reunification of Upper and Lower Imaskar, which prompted the Late period of the empire.

==Notable Locations==
