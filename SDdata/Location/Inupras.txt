Inupras was the capital of the Imaskari Empire between  and , and again between  and .
At the time of its construction, Inupras stood on a plain. However, after −2488 DR, the surrounding region had become the Raurin Desert.
While the Imperial City was razed in −2488 DR, the Palace of the Purple Emperor survived the battles, most likely because of powerful wards.
Imaskari cities were often built of a purple stone from the Raurin mountains, which was naturally extremely resilient. The Imaskari artificers were known for their use of portals and extradimensional spaces, which were a common means of transportation in their cities, as well as tactically exploited.
Inupras was established as the capital of the Imaskari Empire by Lord Umyatin when he ascended to the throne as Lord Artificer in −7975 DR, and it continued to be the capital until −6422 DR, when it was razed by rampaging krakentuas that emerged from the Temple of the Gaping Maw in the middle of the city because of the location, public opinion blamed the Cult of Demogorgon. This event would precipitate the split into Upper and Lower Imaskar.
It was refounded by Lord Omanond in −3920 DR during the reunification of Upper and Lower Imaskar, which prompted the Late period of the empire.
