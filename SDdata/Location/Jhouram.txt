Jhouram, also referred to as the Third City of the Sword was an important trading city of the ancient realm of Jhaamdath during the era known as the The Founding Time.
The city was built on a hill-covered area of Jhaamdath approximately  south of the Eyes of Silvanus.
Jhouram was famous for the great amount of trade it conducted with minor kingdoms scattered across the coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars.
When Jhaamdath fell, Jhourams hills served to protect much of the city from most of the force of the great tidal wave conjured forth by the elves of Nikerymath. The changed seascape of the regions caused those sections of the city spared from the initial destruction to eventually sink into the waters of the Vilhon Reach while remaining mostly intact.
The submerged ruins of Jhouram became overgrown with barnacles and underwater sea life. A sea hag witch-queen Marintagh and her two green hag subordinates came to rule over the sunken city and its resident tribe of kapoacinths. Through dedicated efforts, the hags and their minions recovered much of the lost riches and the psionically-charged magical items from the citys more secure locations.
