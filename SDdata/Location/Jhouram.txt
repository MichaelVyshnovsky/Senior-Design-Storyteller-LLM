'''Jhouram''', also referred to as the '''Third City of the Sword''' was an important trading city of the ancient realm of [[Jhaamdath]] during the era known as the [[The Founding Time]].

==Geography==
The city was built on a hill-covered area of Jhaamdath approximately {{SI|10|mi|k}} south of the [[Eyes of Silvanus]].

==Trade==
Jhouram was famous for the great amount of trade it conducted with minor kingdoms scattered across the coast of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==History==
When Jhaamdath fell, Jhouram's hills served to protect much of the city from most of the force of the great tidal wave conjured forth by the [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]]. The changed seascape of the regions caused those sections of the city spared from the initial destruction to eventually sink into the waters of the [[Vilhon Reach]] while remaining mostly intact.

The submerged ruins of Jhouram became overgrown with barnacles and underwater sea life. A [[sea hag]] witch-queen [[Marintagh]] and her two [[green hag]] subordinates came to rule over the sunken city and its resident tribe of [[kapoacinth]]s. Through dedicated efforts, the hags and their minions recovered much of the lost riches and the [[psionics|psionically]]-charged magical items from the city's more secure locations.
