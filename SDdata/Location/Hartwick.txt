'''Hartwick''' was a small town on the west bank of the [[Clear Whirl River]] in [[Hartsvale]].

==Description==
The town was populated by craftsmen, fishermen, and gatherers, as well as by rich traders and merchants, who lived in large manor houses.

==Geography==
The village was located just outside of [[Castle Hartwick]] on the mainland.

==Government==
The town seems to have been led by a group of "town fathers".

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Avner]] of Hartwick

==Notable Locations==
The only significant site within the town was an ancient mausoleum, older than even Castle Hartwick, by several decades. The mausoleum was dedicated to the hero [[Veltig]], a [[Blood Riders|Blood Rider]].

==Rumors & Legends==
In [[1366 DR]],{{Giantcraft date}} one of the seals to Veltig's mausoleum was discovered to have been broken from the inside, leading to many rumors. Some of the [[Twilight Omen]]s observed by the [[giant]]s in the region were thought by the town fathers to have been connected to the mausoleum.
