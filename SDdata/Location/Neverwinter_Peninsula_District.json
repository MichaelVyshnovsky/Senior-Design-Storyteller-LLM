        "mainbody": "The Peninsula District was one of the districts of Neverwinter in the 14 century DR. \nThe Peninsula District was named for the geographic peninsula that conformed most of the territory of this district. Most of this district was taken up by the prison of Neverwinter.\nDuring the citys struggle with the Wailing Death in 1372 DR, the district was in turmoil because of a prison break. However, the Hero of Neverwinter was able to deal with this problem.\nThe Peninsula District was badly damaged during the war against Luskan.\nWhen Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, most of the City Core was left untouched by the pyroclastic flow. When Dagult Neverember began his efforts to rebuild Neverwinter, in the late years of the 15 century DR, he fused the City Core, the Peninsula District and the Merchant Quarter into only one area. Eventually, the survivors of the cataclysm renamed this new area the Protectors Enclave.\n* * Neverwinters Prison"
