'''Kalathtyr''' was a small fishing village that stood at the mouth of the [[River Specie]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The village was a small collection of huts raised on stilts. Kalathtyr was permeated with the smell of dampness and [[mold]] and surrounded by mud, sea-chills, and seemingly ever-present swarms of nasty [[stingflies]] and [[bite-gnat]]s. The village's population was around twenty families as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Kalathtyr lacked any guest accommodations and had no [[inn]]s for travelers to spend a night in. The best they could hope for was a spot on the local tavern's floor. Its streets were decorated with hanging lantern lines, lit for signaling. Seabirds often sat upon these lines and became [[sling]] target practice targets for the Kalath kids.

==Trade==
The village's main industry was fishing, and the locals caught abundant [[silverfin]]s and [[burdolin]]s. The latter fish was a bottom-feeder flatfish, beloved for its flavorful stomach-warming flesh but having an extremely unappealing appearance reminiscent of a pile of rotting [[seaweed]]. Burdolins were a popular treat and started gaining popularity in [[Athkatla]] as of the late 1360s DR. When hauled to shore, silverfins were turned into [[saltfish]], pickled for export to be cooked into [[fishpaste]] by purchasers or smoked and made into [[smoked fish tart]]s.

The lands around Kalathtyr—the [[Zehoarast Floodplains]]—were treacherous, hiding areas of deadly mud. Kalath people knew their way around the most dangerous mud pits of the floodplains and navigated the mud and River Specie on [[skiff]]s. These flat-bottomed vessels were primarily used to haul trade goods to and from Kalathtyr.

Kalath folk consumed other creatures apart from fish. The village's abundant seabirds were shot down by sling-wielding children and were used in some of the most common dishes. In general, Kalath cuisine consisted of chopped and fried [[eel]]s, [[shovelbill]]s, [[mudfrog]]s, and [[seagull]]s.

==History==
Kalathtyr received an unfavorable mention in [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s published guide to [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]]. He recommended travelers avoid the squalid village, and he speculated that Kalathtyr's unremarkable nature was hiding a smuggling operation hiding in plain sight.

The [[Sothillisian War]] struck close in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, as on [[Mirtul 12]] Sothillisian raiders attacked a large farm near Kalathtyr, owned by House [[Gheldieg]] and controlled by House [[Tanislove]]. It was rumored that the attack was in retaliation against House Tanislove for their past actions.

==Notable Locations==
The village of Kalathtyr was known for the remnants of a huge ship stuck in the mud, surfacing every low tide. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, only ribs and a keel were left from the vessel, still ensnared in the carcass of a great [[water dragon]]—the cause of the ship's demise. The ship's name was thought to be lost to history, and the only sign of its origins were peculiar blue-hued [[electrum]] [[coin]]s from early [[Nimbral]] that regularly washed ashore around the wreck. Occasionally, old ensorcelled [[ring]]s and [[gauntlet]]s could be found washed ashore as well, but their magics were almost completely gone.
