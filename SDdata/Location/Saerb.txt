Saerb was a settlement in northern Sembia located where the Dawnpost, the Thunder Way, and the Belduuk Road met, near the border with Archendale. It was a small village where lived merchants that preferred a quiet life in the countryside instead of the chaos of the cities.
It was a key place during the Sembian Civil War.
