        "Appearance": "The enclave was walled with scuffed, mortared stone walls. Inside was a two story building and an attached three story tower with an observatory on top. Iron-reinforced oak gates lead inside. A large red tent is set up in the courtyard to sell items. There is an underground cellar only accessible by magic. {{Cite dragon/366/Rose Keep|46}}",
        "History": "Rose Keep was founded as a [[Thay]]an [[Thayan enclave|enclave]] early in the [[Era of Upheaval]]. It was the last enclave established before [[Szass Tam]]'s takeover of Thay. Originally overseen by four [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]], it teetered on the brink of failure, partly due to two of the Red Wizards leaving to pursue their own interests and [[Levant]] leaving to pledge himself to Szass Tam.  This left Dhenna to run Rose Keep by herself with a newborn daughter. \n\nShe ran it until her death in [[1449 DR]] when her daughter Tharna took over.{{Cite dragon/366/Rose Keep|42}} Tharna continued to run Rose Keep on her own but eventually sought partners in [[1474 DR]] allowing two to buy-in but keeping a majority share for herself.{{Cite dragon/366/Rose Keep|43}}",
        "Inhabitants": "*[[Dhenna Shavres]] worked there in [[1396 DR]].\n*[[Levant]] was one of the four original Red Wizards assigned to oversee Rose Keep.\n*[[Tharna Shavres]] became head of Rose Keep in [[1449 DR]] after her mother Dhenna passed away.\n*[[Vanargen the Astronomer]] was a partner of Tharna.\n*[[Dorim Cragwatcher]] was a partner of Tharna."
