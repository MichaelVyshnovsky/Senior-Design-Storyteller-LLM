Throughout the [[Age of Humanity]], the '''Arcanum of Olleth''' was the major [[morkoth]] country in [[Serôs]]. Early into the [[Era of Upheaval]] and after the [[Spellplague]], Olleth became ruled by [[kuo-toa]]. 

==History==
Olleth was founded in [[911 DR]].

Sometime late in the 14th century of Dale Reckoning the morkoth ambushed a kuo-toa delegation under a truce vouchsafed by [[Blibdoolpoolp]]. Half of the kuo-toa were eaten and the rest were kept as slaves.  However, several of the surviving kuo-toa were whips of Blibdoolpoolp and started a massive campaign of setbacks, uprisings and disasters.

In [[1385 DR]] the Spellplague struck Olleth and a third of the morkoth mages dissolved in blue flashes. The remaining morkoth lost their grip on the spells they used to enslave others. The kuo-toa moved quickly to seize control of Olleth. Most of the morkoth were killed, though a few escaped and the kuo-toa kept most of the slaves. Afterwards kuo-toa migrated into Serôs for the first time.

In [[1393 DR]] several kuo-toa left Olleth and founded the colony of [[Taunissik]]

By [[1479 DR]], the city of Olleth was under the total dominion of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]].
