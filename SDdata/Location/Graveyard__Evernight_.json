The cries and howls of dangerous creatures echoed through the area.\nWhile the Graveyard was sometimes used to bury one of Evernights undead inhabitants if they were destroyed or slain, its main function was to host \"funerals\" in which living victims were ritualistically buried alive to later be eaten.\nIt was located in the south of the city. It occupied the same place as did the Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter on the Material Plane.\nAs of , Valindra Shadowmantle and her Thayan forces were making use of the shadow crossing in Neverdeath to infiltrate Neverwinter, and the Netherese forces who opposed her sought to disrupt this operation. Around the same time, a number of Netherese shadar-kai could be found patrolling the Graveyard.\n* Dolindar Tomb, the resting place for the living Dolindar family that was once banished to Evernight.\n* A gate leading into Evernight proper that was guarded by Gatekeeper Arkwright."
