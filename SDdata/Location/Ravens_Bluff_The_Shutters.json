        "mainbody": "'''The Shutters''' was a neighborhood mostly comprised of private and secure warehouses in the [[Ravens Bluff/Crow's End|Crow's End]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]], located across the [[Fire River]] from [[Ravens Bluff/Shadystreets|Shadystreets]].\n{{quote|Under the hard stares of the many warehouse guards, most visitors tend to leave The Shutters as swiftly as possibleâ€“let's follow their fine example.|}}",
        "Description": "The Shutters was a relatively small neighborhood of about eleven uneven city blocks with a single bridge across the Fire River connecting it to Shadystreets. [[The Ravensbridge]] laid on the northeastern end of the neighborhood on [[Stonekeep Concourse]]. Two streets that ran from east to west formed the neighborhood's southerns border: [[Hammerstone Street]] to the east and [[Red Sails Way]] to the west. [[Karen Court]] ran parallel these two streets, while [[Mraedara's Street]], Stonekeep Concourse, [[Burning Shield Lane]], [[Landleen Lane]], [[Helhavryn's Walk]], [[Castles Way]], and [[Deepaxe Way]] connected them, crossed, and moved further south, beyond the neighborhood's border.\n\nThe neighborhood was sparsely populated with most inhabitants being mercenary garrisons who ensured the tightly-shuttered warehouses of the Shutters remained unburglarized. The neighborhood's shores were muddy, allowing the locals fish for river [[eel]]s as well as other edible sea creatures. Abundant [[seagull]]s were often knocked out with stones and sent straight to the locals' [[stewpot]]s. Most animals found here were just food, apart from [[raven]]s, who remained unharmed. These reasons were why The Shutters were mostly ignored by tourists and visitors.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Ambra's Small Boats Rental & Harbor Rescue/Retrieval]], a riverside shop, north of Deepaxe Way's end, run by [[Ambra]], a retired [[adventurer]] along with a crew of seven [[hin]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n* [[Delmer's Ferry]] on Deepaxe Way's offered a rowboat passage across the Fire River, run by [[Wamaer Delmer]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Fellowship of Exalted Adventurers]], a young boys' club formed in the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Witch of the Mists|3}}\n* [[Fish Tails]], a fried [[fishcake]] factory two doors west from The Last Jack.\n* [[Fruits & More]], a grocer located next-door to Muldryn's Chainworks on Karen Court. It specialized in [[sugar]]s, [[jam]]s, and [[compote]]s, as well as crude berry-infused [[cordial]]s.\n* [[The Last Jack]], a quiet inn with a safe taproom located on the riverside where Stonekeep Concourse and Mraedara's Street crossed.\n* [[Muldryn's Chainworks]], a [[chain]]-forging workshop at the very end of Karen Court, run by [[Anskaler Muldryn]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR."
