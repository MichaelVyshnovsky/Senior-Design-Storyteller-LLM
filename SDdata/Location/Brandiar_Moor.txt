The Brandiar Moor was a region of moorland in central Damara.
The Brandiar Moor straddled the borders of the Duchies of Arcata, Brandiar, and Carmathan. Its southern edge was located  east of the Arcatan capital of Valls.The location of Valls was moved much further south between the original map in H3 The Bloodstone Wars and the subsequent map created for The Bloodstone Lands. This would place the Brandiar Moors new location much further south than the intersection of the borders of the three duchies as described in the actual text of The Bloodstone Lands and as shown on the original map. As such, the new map is presumed to be in error. The alternative reading is that the Moor extends south all the way into central Carmathan.
The region was characterized by steep-sloped hills pocked by stone walls.
In the , the southern edge of the Brandiar Moor became the site of the Fight of Three Borders, a major battle in the Bloodstone Wars between the forces of Baron Gareth Dragonsbane of Bloodstone and the forces of Duke Helmont the 14th of Carmathan.
