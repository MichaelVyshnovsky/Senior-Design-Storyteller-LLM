Settlement
Sister of Rains was a canyon-oasis found in the desert of Anauroch in North Faer√ªn. The settlement was a refuge for those Bedine who were outcast from their tribes, such as witches, wizards and other spellcasters.
The oasis was located in the region of Anauroch known as the Sword, at the base of the eastern slopes of the Wall of the Fallen Djinn mountain range, west of the desolate expanse known as the Shoal of Thirst.

The only notable landmark within the Sister of Rains was a ruined tower, that was built long before the Era of Upheaval by a tribe of Bedine that did not survive to that era.
