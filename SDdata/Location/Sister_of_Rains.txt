'''Sister of Rains''' was a canyon-oasis found in the desert of [[Anauroch]] in [[North Faer√ªn]]. The settlement was a refuge for those [[Bedine]] who were outcast from their tribes, such as witches, [[wizard]]s and other spellcasters.

==Geography==
The oasis was located in the region of Anauroch known as [[the Sword]], at the base of the eastern slopes of the [[Wall of the Fallen Djinn]] mountain range, west of the desolate expanse known as the [[Shoal of Thirst]]. Due to this precarious location, the settlement of outcasts was well-isolated from the other settlements of the Bedine tribes.


===Geographical Features===
The Sister of Rains was nestled in a steep-walled canyon, accessible by a narrow gulch that was dotted with plant life. Freshwater springs poured out the canyon's walls on its southern side, forming the pools from which the oasis took its name.

===Flora & Fauna===
A natural grove arose from the Sister's pools of water, one that included scores of [[fig]] trees.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the Sister of Rains was still the home of magic-wielding outcasts who had been exiled or otherwise abandoned by the Bedine people. By the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the oasis was abandoned,

==Notable Locations==
The only notable landmark within the Sister of Rains was a ruined tower, that was built long before the [[Era of Upheaval]] by a tribe of Bedine that did not survive to that era.
