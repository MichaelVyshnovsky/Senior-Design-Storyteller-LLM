        "mainbody": "'''Mithral Hall''' (sometimes spelled '''Mithril Hall''')\n\nOriginally a [[mithral]] mine belonging to [[Clan Battlehammer]], this underground town became a safe haven for various [[dwarf]] families and even some persons of other races. Mithral Hall had a long history of tragedy and triumph, and was the making and breaking of countless individuals.",
        "Geography": {
            "Settlestone": "An ancient village south of Mithral Hall, [[Settlestone]] was one of the few dwarven settlements built entirely above ground. Originally known as ''Dwarvendarrow'', the settlement was built with huge slabs of rock laid against one another. These sturdy structures withstood the elements for years and even survived several centuries after the village was abandoned.\n\nUsed by the occupants of Mithral Hall as a public front and forward base, Settlestone was first resettled in [[1357 DR]] by [[Reghedmen|barbarians]] from [[Icewind Dale]] led by [[Berkthgar]], although the barbarians only stayed for a few years.{{fact}} Settlestone was also populated with around 200 dwarf guards that regulated traffic around Mithral Hall and kept the surrounding area free from monsters.",
            "Keeper's Dale": "Keeper's Dale was the name given to the rocky valley that surrounded the northwestern entrance to Mithral Hall. To navigate it was treacherous and arduous, due to the craggy outcrops and unstable edges.{{fact}}\n\nThe steps on Keeper's Dale that led to the entrance of the hall were carefully carved where two different types of rock met. This provided camouflage and meant the steps could only be seen from the correct angle, or by those in the know."
        },
        "Structure": {
            "Entrances": {
                "Main entrance (west)": "Sunken into Keeper's Dale, the main entrance to Mithral Hall was highlighted by a formation of ancient monoliths that pre-dated the settlement. The entry hall was a wide, high roofed room carved out of the mountains, lit by enchanted torches that never went out.",
                "Secondary entrance/exit (east)": "On the east side of [[Fourthpeak]] was a small, hidden door that came out overlooking the river [[Surbrin]]. Known as Surbrin Gate, this door was not marked from the outside and for this reason was rarely used as an entrance. It was instead used as an exit via [[Garumn's Gorge]].{{fact}}",
                "Underdark connections": "The lowest levels of the mine were gated off by heavy doors from the [[Underdark]]. These tunnels allowed the invasion by the drow of [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1358 DR]], but they also connecting the city to the deep gnomes of [[Blingdenstone]]."
            },
            "Notable Locations": {
                "The Maze": "After entering Mithral Hall from the western entrance in Keeper's Dale, one was faced with a short corridor and then a complex network of twisting tunnels and side rooms. This section on the upper level was known as the ''Maze''. It was a knotted web of tunnels filled with traps and dead ends. Its purpose was to slow down or stop any invaders. Invited guests were instructed to wait in the entry hall to be met by a guide, as attempting to navigate the maze without the requisite knowledge could be fatal.",
                "The Undercity": "In the center of the mountain lay the ''Undercity'', the main living quarters for the miners and permanent residents. What was already a large natural cave was carved out further by the town founders. The walls had ledges carved into them like a colosseum, with several small homes carved into each of the giant steps. In the middle of the chamber, at the lowest level, were the workshops and furnaces where the majority of the forging and labor took place. The glow of the forge lit and warmed the entire Undercity. Towering over the Undercity was a bridge allowing miners to navigate through the city rather than around it.",
                "Garumn's Gorge": "[[Garumn's Gorge]] was a massive natural cavern within the east side of the mountain. Although unconfirmed, it was almost undoubtedly named after the Sixth King of Mithral Hall, [[Garumn Battlehammer]]. The 330m (1000ft) deep cave could only be crossed via a small bridge. This bridge led to the east entrance, and could be used as a great defensive tool. The bridge was also blocked by a portcullis, which was operated from a room on the other side of Mithral Hall. Down one side of the gorge, there was a waterfall known as ''Bruenor Falls''. Bruenor Falls led to a small basin of water at the bottom of the gorge, which in turn trickled out through caves in the mountain into the [[River Surbrin]]. During [[Shimmergloom]]'s reign, the gorge was known as ''Shimmergloom's Run''. A cave at the bottom of the gorge lead to the deep mines east of the Undercity.",
                "Halls of Gathering": "On the upper levels,  on the east side of the complex, were the Halls of Gathering. These huge rooms were used as a meeting and greeting place for visitors and guests. Here the majority of Mithral Hall's occupants could meet (depending on the current population) and share pleasantries with any newcomers.",
                "Hall of Dumathoin": "Named after the patron of shield dwarves and Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, [[Dumathoin]], this room was used as storage for the vast wealth and treasures belonging to Mithral Hall and [[Clan Battlehammer]]. New visitors were shown this room on arrival after being seen through the ''Hall of Gathering''.",
                "Burial places": "The cairn of King Bruenor Battlehammer included a statue of King Bruenor in battle stance. [[Regis]] and [[Catti-brie]] were also buried in Mithral Hall."

        "History": {
            "Origin": "Although the exact date when Mithral Hall was founded is unknown, it was before [[0 DR]]. The Hall was founded by Gandalug Battlehammer. (It is however reported in ''[[Hall of Heroes]]'' that [[Bunko Battlehammer]] was the founder of Mithral Hall, however this has been contradicted in several other works so is considered an error.) The settlement was originally set up as a mine, due to the rich seams of mithral ore in the mountain. The business quickly grew into a thriving community. The location of Mithral Hall was kept extremely secret, so that other organizations wouldn't try invading. The dwarves used to sell their ore and weapons in Settlestone, using it as a public front for the mine. This way outsiders were not exposed to the secret location of the mine.{{fact}}",
            "Shimmergloom's Reign": "Towards the end of the 1100s DR, the deepest mines carved out by the dwarves of Mithral Hall broke into a shadowcavern. The cavern was said to be linked to the Plane of Shadows. An immensely powerful [[shadow dragon]] named [[Haerinvureem]] (known as ''Shimmergloom'') was subsequently released into the mines.{{fact}}\n\nThe dragon, who later became known as Shimmergloom, was aided by hordes of shadow creatures and a whole clan of [[duergar]]. The loyal dwarves stood and fought allowing the few not strong enough the opportunity to flee. Among those that escaped was a young Bruenor Battlehammer.{{fact}}\n\nThe dragon ravaged Mithral Hall slaying thousands of dwarves. [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] was one of the few dwarves that fought in the battle and survived, although he was presumed dead for quite some time.<ref> [[Bangor Battlehammer]] and his father [[Garumn Battlehammer]] died in the battle slaying hordes of Duergar. As they died their surrounding area was probably cursed as their bodies and possessions remained untouched centuries later.\n\nThe 300 or so dwarves that escaped fled to the nearby Settlestone where they waited for news, expecting their kin to emerge victorious and invite them back. The good news never came, and the few dwarves that ventured back into Mithral Hall looking for survivors did not return. What was a settlement of 10,000 was cut down to 300.",
            "Reclaiming Mithral Hall": "",
            "Battle of Keeper's Dale": "{{Main|Battle of Keeper's Dale}}\n\nIn the year [[1358 DR]] an army of [[drow]], [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s led by [[House Baenre]] attacked Mithral Hall, from [[Menzoberranzan]]. The defending dwarves soon received aid from [[svirfneblin]] from [[Blingdenstone]], local barbarians from [[Settlestone]] led by [[Berkthgar]] the Bold, reinforcements from [[Nesme]], led by [[Galen Firth]] and the [[Knights in Silver|Knights of Silver]] and the mysterious [[Harpell]]s of [[Longsaddle]]. At one point the wizard [[Alustriel]] even appeared to deter the attackers. After a few days of intense fighting, the evil drow and other races were eventually defeated and driven back to their shadowy homes.",
            "King Gandalug's Return": "During the Battle of Keeper's Dale, Bruenor and the other Companions of the Hall freed Gandalug Battlehammer from a powerful spell leaving the ancient dwarf a servant of Baenre. In [[1362 DR]], Bruenor abdicated his throne to Gandalug, the founder of Mithral Hall, making him the 1st and 9th King of Mithral Hall. The old dwarf died only a few years later, no doubt from old age, as the spell that had held him captive and postponed his aging had worn off. Bruenor, who had taken a few hundred of his dwarves back to Icewind Dale, returned to rule as Tenth King of Mithral Hall in [[1370 DR]].\n\n{{Fq|text=My dreams were red and black that night, and I cried and cried until no more tears would come.

The staggering army came from the [[Spine of the World]]. Over the next few years the fighting continued and various battles and skirmishes between the dwarves and orcs caused huge amounts of destruction and bloodshed on both sides. In [[1372 DR]] the wizard Alustriel stepped in again to defend Mithral Hall.",

        "Relationships": "Mithral Hall had a close relationship with the other dwarven realms in the [[Silver Marches]], including [[Citadel Adbar]] and [[Citadel Felbarr]]. When Mithral Hall was reclaimed by King Bruenor, 2,000 dwarves emigrated from Citadel Adbar with the blessing of King [[Harbromm]]. King [[Emerus Warcrown]] signed the [[Treaty of Garumn's Gorge]] alongside with King Bruenor.\n\n[[Mirabar]] and Mithral Hall had an antagonistic relationship, with Mirabar even sending emissaries to attempt to sabotage Mithral Hall's ore in [[1372 DR]]. In that same year, a number of dwarves from Mirabar, disgusted at their city's contempt for and hostility towards their fellow [[Delzoun]] dwarves defected to Mithral Hall.",
