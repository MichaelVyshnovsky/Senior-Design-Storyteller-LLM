        "Geography": "Archentree and the rest of Mielikki's Garden contained a huge number of [[oak]] trees. Some speculated that treants seeded the mighty trees, while other sages claimed that the abundance of oaks was what attracted treant to the area.\n\nArchentree was located on a curve of [[Elder River]] that flowed from the [[Elder Spires]] into the [[Inner Sea]]. The [[House of Silvanus]], the main temple of [[Silvanus]] in the region ran by the [[Emerald Enclave]] was located several miles to the south of Archentree.",
        "Inhabitants": "Treants that inhabited Mielikki's Garden were old creatures who peered to stay out of business of others. They were likely to ignore pleas for aid or requests to dispense their ancient wisdom by [[human]]s. Archentree's treants did not tolerate lit [[torch]]es often wielded by unwitting visitors and retaliated with swift and deadly efficiency.\n\nWhen left alone, Archentree's treants laughed, and danced with slowly swaying steps."
