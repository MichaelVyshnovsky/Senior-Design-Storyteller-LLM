        "mainbody": "Archentree was less of a settlement and more of an ancestral gathering place for treants of Mielikkis Garden on Iligh√¥n island off the coast of the Vilhon Reach.\nArchentree and the rest of Mielikkis Garden contained a huge number of oak trees. Some speculated that treants seeded the mighty trees, while other sages claimed that the abundance of oaks was what attracted treant to the area.\nArchentree was located on a curve of Elder River that flowed from the Elder Spires into the Inner Sea. The House of Silvanus, the main temple of Silvanus in the region ran by the Emerald Enclave was located several miles to the south of Archentree.\nTreants that inhabited Mielikkis Garden were old creatures who peered to stay out of business of others. They were likely to ignore pleas for aid or requests to dispense their ancient wisdom by humans. Archentrees treants did not tolerate lit torches often wielded by unwitting visitors and retaliated with swift and deadly efficiency.\nWhen left alone, Archentrees treants laughed, and danced with slowly swaying steps."
