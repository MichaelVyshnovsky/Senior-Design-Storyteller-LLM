        "mainbody": "The '''Three Free Cities of the Shining Plains''' was a loosely affiliated conglomeration of city-states of the [[Shining Plains]].",
        "Geography": "The Three Free Cities consisted of [[Assam]] on the southern shores of the [[Wet River]], [[Ormath]], directly to the south, and [[Lheshayl]], the westernmost of the three.",
        "History": "Historically, the Three Free Cities were more trade adversaries than allies. The {{YearlinkName|326}} brought a bloody conflict to the Shining Plains and the grazing pastures of the famed [[Plainsteed]]s. Ormath and Lheshayl turned disputes into an armed conflict. Two armies, totaling 25,000, spilled blood for over two weeks onto the land plot, which would later be known as the [[Field of Tears]]. Eventually, warriors of the [[wemic]] [[Ten-Paw]] tribe joined the fray, driving the human armies away. Following the conflict, the Three Free Cities and the Ten-Paw gathered on the [[Hill of Memories]] annually to commiserate the bloodshed and make sure such conflicts never occurred again."
