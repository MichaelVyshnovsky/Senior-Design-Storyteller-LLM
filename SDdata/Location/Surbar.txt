'''Surbar''' was a coastal city of [[Ulgarth]] in [[southeast Faerûn]].

==Geography==
Surbar was sheltered safely within the bay of the [[Golden Water]]. It stood on the coast, southwest of the [[Galuil Mountains]].<ref group="note">The source says "southeast of the Galuil Mountains", but this must be in error. On the maps, Surbar is depicted to the southwest of the nearby mountains. Sunrise in springtime made the Mountains of Gold a beautiful sight.

==Government==
Around [[1367 DR]], Surbar and its environs were governed by Baron [[Kasnchil]]. He was corrupt and greedy, yet the serfs thought he made the city prosper.

==Trade==
Surbar received most of the [[gold]] and [[iron]] mined from the mountains. Metalworking, [[weapon]]-smithing, shipping, and [[spices]] were Surbar's primary industries. Baron Kasnchil's policy of accepting all kinds of trade through Surbar made it a popular port and a prosperous city, but this knew no limits: even [[Dambrath]]an pirates could dock there to resupply and refit.

==Inhabitants==
Surbar was home to nearly 15,000 people, making it the second-largest city in Ulgarth. More than anywhere else in the kingdom, [[demihuman]]s were common here, thanks to the [[dwarf|dwarven]] mining trade from the mountains.
