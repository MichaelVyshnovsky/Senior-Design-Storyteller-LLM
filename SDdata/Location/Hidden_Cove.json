        "mainbody": "The Hidden Cove was a vast underground cavern found in the Sword Coast North region of Faer√ªn.\nWithin the cove was an underground lake, on which was built a rather rudimentary dock.\nIt was one of the primary hideaways of the Blackdagger Bandits, a group cutthroat marauders that harried travelers and other innocent folk along the beach, as well as those traveling along the High Road or near Cragmire Keep. The bandits stored much of their pilfered loot within the cave, before delivering it to their \"leader\" Jareth Grim.\nThe Hidden Cove could be accessed from a narrow tunnel within a rocky outcropping located on Raven Cliff Beach.\nIn the , the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge ventured into the Hidden Cove in order to recover the stolen chest of valuables that once belonged to the retired lighthouse keeper Old Lenn. The old man was particularly happy to have recovered his old love letters."
