'''Minsor Vale''' was a fishing village on [[Lake Weng]] in [[Amn]], built on the ruins of the former capital of [[Minsorran]].{{Cite web/More of Waterdeep and Lands of Intrigue}}

==Geography==
Minsor Vale lay on the southwest shore of Lake Weng, near the south bank of the outflowing [[Alandor River]]. Sitting in the wide basin of Lake Weng in the shadow of the [[Cloud Peaks]], it was part of the northern highlands of Amn at an altitude of {{SI|1500|ft|long=yes}}. The closest major road was the [[Lake Way]] to the south atop a higher ridge that made up the southern rim of the basin, the nearest city was [[Crimmor]], down the Alandor, while the closest small settlements were [[Ideepton]], [[Edive]], and [[Shatar]], all on the shores of Lake Weng.{{Cite interactive atlas|Amn}}

==Trade==
Minsor Vale supported itself with fishing and the farming of root vegetables, with any surplus being sold on to travelers and nearby military sites such as [[Citadel Amnur]] and [[Citadel Rashturl]]. The Alandor River was an ideal barge route that didn't freeze in winter, with light water traffic from Minsor Vale around Lake Weng and down to [[Crimmor]] and [[Athkatla]].

==History==
Minsor Vale was originally a [[Selûnite]] temple-town and the capital of the theocratic realm of Minsorran. Founded in [[300 DR]] in the shadow of the [[Shoon Imperium]], Minsorran was a gathering of the followers of Selûne, [[Shar]], [[Lathander]], and [[Mystra]] who lived in harmony and respected their collective pantheon.

The community suffered a schism in {{YearlinkName|390}}, when discontented Selûnites broke away and founded [[Myth Lharast]] hundreds of miles away in order to worship Selûne outside of Minsorran's pantheonic theocracy.

The cities of Minsorran were depopulated in [[600 DR]] during a harsh midwinter blizzard when their people seemed to disappear without any apparent explanation. The culprit was actually the cunning [[white dragon]] [[Icehauptannarthanyx]], who laired in [[Mount Speartop]] and successfully avoided being known of in the lands below. All four cities fell to ruin, with Minsor Vale eventually gaining a new population after several centuries, reaching a quarter of its former high. The new Minsor Vale was a much smaller settlement, and was surrounded by the ruins of the former capital.

Selûnite pilgrims in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] had a tendency to mistake Minsor Vale for long-lost Myth Lharast, ending their journeys there instead.

==Notable Locations==
The main point of interest in Minsor Vale was the [[Maiden's Baths]], a public bath house with magical amenities and active shrine to [[Selûne]]. An abandoned seven-story temple to Selûne loomed over the center of the village.
