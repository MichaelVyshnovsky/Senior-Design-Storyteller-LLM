Sloopdilmonpolop, the City of Pools, was a city of the kuo-toa in the middle Old Shanatar domain of the Underdark.
The City of Pools was located just shy of 8 miles (12.8 kilometers) beneath Firedrake Bay.
A cluster of eighteen moisture-laden caverns, crusted with salt made up the majority of the city, with a nineteenth cavern in the center of them all. This nineteenth cavern was nearly one thousand feet long and wide and home to the Sacred Pool of the Sea Mother, a square, subterranean lake. The River of Brine was a saltwater waterway that connected all of the caverns, the waters of which originated in sea caves along the Lagoon of the Trollspears in Tethyrs County Starspur.
In the late 14th century DR, Dagagoorg served both as Priest-King (Va-Poolgol) of Sloopdilmonpolop and high priest of the Sacred Pool of the Sea Mother. He was served by nine Priest-Dukes (Oorg-Poolgoopan), who acted as both his advisory council and governors of various aspects of Kuo-toan life. The three most powerful of these were Bahurlgagoop, who was responsible for the citys fisheries Viboolkugoorg was in charge of trade and Gibupgagool was the citys war leader. The other six Priest-Dukes governed agriculture, mining, pilgrims, sacred places, slavery, and childrearing.
Ruling over the king and his dukes though, was the kraken known as The Cephalopolop. He had quietly guided the Priest-Kings of the city for centuries, using them in his personal vendettas against the other krakens in the region.
The kuo-toa harvested crustaceans, fish and mollusks from the waters, collecting pearls and shells as byproducts and creating scrimshaw too. They also farmed kelp and salt. In addition to what they took from the sea, they also mined ores from the rock (though most veins were played out and the tunnels flooded to grow more kelp).
The city had a permanant armed force consisting of eight hundred kuo-toans. Over five thousand six hundred more militia could be mustered in times of need. A police force consisting of four hundred monitors (Blib-sanvu) dealt with internal issues, led by Commander Kurplarhagoon.
Circa , Sloopdilmonpolop was founded by Sloopdilmonpol, a great kuo-toa prophet, as a temple-city in the Underdark off the coast of Tethyr.
Eventually the temple grew into a theocratic city-state, with priest-king rulers.
After an increasing number of expansionist raids by the citys denizens, the dwarves of Sondarr and Xothaerin dispatched scouts who eventually discovered the City of Pools. This touched off a centuries-long war of mutual extinction, known as the Axe and Fin Wars. The city was never taken, but the long conflict ushered in a period of decline from which the city never recovered. The only benefit to this was the citys emergence as a mercantile hub. Compared to most Underdark cities, Sloopdilmonpolop was actually somewhat welcoming to merchants and travelers. Illithids were not welcome.
After the Spellplague, Blibdoolpoolps shamans lost contact with the goddess and many turned to the worship of Ghaunadaur. Additionally, the city was flooded by kuo-toan refugees fleeing the Abolethic Sovereignty.
The drow of Guallidurth claimed to be the true rulers of Sloopdilmonpolop, but this was merely an excuse that they gave for not attempting to conquer it.
