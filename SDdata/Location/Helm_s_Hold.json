        "mainbody": "elms Hold was a fortified city and cathedral dedicated to Helm found on the Sword Coast North.\nHelms Hold was located around  southeast of the city of Neverwinter, \nThe Hold was originally led by its founder, First Guardian Dumal Erard. His title was a position that could only be passed on to another by means of martial combat.\nEventually, a democratically elected City Council was chosen from among the citys populace. This council was composed of Speakers who often resorted to ostentatious and self-serving behavior and, at times, even intimidation against their fellow members in order to pass legislation. The Chief Speaker led this forum and had the final say on policy-making decisions. \nWhen the Ashmadai revealed themselves within the city in the 1470s DR, their leader known as The Prophet temporarily became the de facto ruler. She held control over the Hold until she showed her true colors and was forced to flee underground into the citys crypts.\nAs of the late 1480s DR, the Chief Speaker was Amarandine Wanderfoot.\nFor the first 40 or so years of the Holds existence, local priests and paladins of Helm patrolled the Watchers Forest and the perimeter of the Neverwinter Wood. \nA high wall was erected around the Hold when expanded to the size of a true city in the . \nOne hundred men and women served as Helms Hundred, a fighting force consisting of magic-users, warriors and even thieves. In the years leading up to 1370 DR, this troop would leave the Hold for Sundabar every Spring to battle the tanarri of Hellgate Keep.\nAfter Dagult Neverember became the Lord Protector of nearby Neverwinter circa the , he sent a detachment of Mintarn mercenaries led by Dunfield to Helms Hold. While their leader was an associate of the lord who fell out of his favor, the mercenaries still held enough power to impose martial law if so directed.\nIn the later years of the 15 century DR, the brutal Order of the Gilded Eye became the de facto police force of the city.\nHelms Hold was originally a farming community known as Helms Stead some time during or before the early 1350s DR. It was fortified into a fortified temple-city by a priest of Helm and former member of the Company of Crazed Venturers named Dumal Erard in the . In the subsequent years, other followers of Helm arrived, many of whom chose to remain amongst their fellow devotees. By 1353 DR, the Hold had grown to a fortified town of seven hundred who lived around the Helmite abbey.\nThe town lost prominence following the Time of Troubles, in the , when the people of Neverwinter proscribed the residents for the actions of their god during that year. \nThe cultists responsible for infecting Neverwinter with the Wailing Death in the , posed as Helmites while using Hold as their base of operations. They desecrated the abbey until the Hero of Neverwinter entered it by means of a portal, and arrested their leader Desther Indelayne.\nAfter recovering from its losses, Helms Hold gained a reputation for safety over the next several decades and began to grow quickly again. The abbey became a grand cathedral, and the town itself grew to become a small city. Despite this, only a few actual Helmites remained in the cathedral after their gods death in the .\nthumb|right|300px|Spellscarred patients of the Holds Sanatorium\nIn the years following the cataclysm of the Spellplague, Helmâ€™s Hold became renowned as a place of safety and healing that catered to all those in need. Eventually, Prince Clariburnus Tanthul of Thultanthar used the barbarous Uthgardt Gray Wolves of the Neverwinter Wood to take over Helms Hold but lost control of the city following the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the , allowing it to be reclaimed.\nHelms Hold became a prime site for refugees fleeing Neverwinters destruction, many infected with Spellplague energies. Though none of the residents held any preconceived notions against such people, many of the uninfected refugees brought theirs with them and persecuted any who showed signs of spellscars. Those who were persecuted against fought back, forming the Heirs of Azure to retaliate against their oppressors.\nWhen Dagult Neverember began reconstruction efforts in Neverwinter, he put a call out to all skilled carpenters and masons to travel to his city. This left a dreadful lack of such tradesmen in the Hold and caused many of its buildings to fall into disrepair. Because of the already high population of spellscarred within the Holds walls and the success that some of the priests had shown in suppressing symptoms, Lord Neverember also issued the Protectors Law, an edict that required all those showing symptoms be sent to the Hold for treatment.\nA leader of the Heirs of Azure named Rohini, known in the Hold as \"The Prophet,\" capitalized on this turn of events and earned the trust of the Helmites with a divination of the return of Helm.As demonstrated in the novel The Sentinel and pages 21-24 of the Sword Coast Adventurers Guide this \"divination\" was indeed false. Over time gained great influence in the area and corrupted many of the Helmite priests. She worked on behalf of the Abolethic Sovereignty to take claim over the citys unfortunate spellscarred to the Sovereignty to be used as servants and experiments.\nIn or around the , it was revealed that the Prophet Rohini was, in fact, a member of the Ashmadai who wanted the spellscarred for service to her god Asmodeus. Rohinis machinations were discovered, and the Helms Hold fell under siege. She summoned forth her fiendish allies to defend her domain against the Neverwinter Guard and their allies, who sought to take back the fortress of Helm. The Heroes of Neverwinter forayed into the streets of the city, infiltrated the Cathedral, and killed the evil succubus alongside her devil and aberrant allies. Helms Hold was finally declared cleansed of evil influence.\nSometime later, an adventuring member of the Order of the Gauntlet by the name of Javen Tarmikos began experiencing signs of the god Helms return. This event was followed shortly afterward by several others claiming the same visions. A veteran of the siege of the Hold, Javen started a splinter-group he named the Order of the Gilded Eye, which refused to follow the Order of the Gauntlets ethos of attacking without provocation and actively sought out to destroy all hidden evil. Resorting to brutal tactics, the Order came to gain control over Helms Hold.\nAs of the , followers of Helm received cryptic visions of aberrant creatures working below the Cathedral of Helm, despite its \"cleansing\" a decade prior. This implied that the threat of the Abolethic Sovereignty was far from over.\nAround the same time, the Black Earth mercenary company was revealed to be a cover for a cult of Evil Elemental Earth led by Marlos Urnrayle, and his plot to create an earth node below Helms Hold was thwarted by the Heros of Sleeping Dragon Bridge.\nRumors persisted that passages formed when Scar Alley was created led up and inside the Sanatorium. Nobody who ever explored that way was seen again but it didnt stop the brave and the desperate from trying.\nthumb|right|400px|The entrance to the Warrens from Scar Alley\nInns & Taverns\n* Hungry Flame, a run-down tavern that catered to the spellscarred residents of the city. \n* Venturers Rest, another battered inn that was once known as the Old Dirty Dwarf. \nLandmarks\n* Town Hall, the citys official council chambers that was once a former inn.\n* Heartward, the citys central marketplace. \nTemples\n* Heartward Hall, a temple of Sune that formed from a smalls shrine located on the edge of the marketplace.\n* Helms Cathedral, the grand Helmite cathedral around which the city formed. \n* Sanatorium, the underground asylum located immediately beneath Helms cathedral.\nUnderground\n* Crypts of the Vigilant Eye, the labyrinthine network of crypts that long predated the Hold itself.\n* The Warrens, an incomplete drainage system located underneath Scar Alley.\n* Dumal Erard, the founder and First Guardian of Helms Hold. \n* Dunfield, temporary Neverwintan overseer of the Hold.\n* Rohini, The Prophet of the Heirs of Azure.\n* Chartilifax, a green dragon ally of Rohini that took the form of a \"green elf\".\n* Amarandine Wanderfoot, Chief Speaker.\n* Alisara Callum, Speaker of the council.\n* Kharissa Anuvien, Speaker of the council.\n* Aldwin Graves, Speaker of the council.\n* Javen Tarmikos, leader of the Order of the Gilded Eye."
