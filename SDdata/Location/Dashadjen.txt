Dashadjen was an ancient city of the Calim Empire, which fell into ruins. The fortified military city was the major garrison for the armies of Calim before and during the First Era of Skyfire.
Dashadjen was located in what became the Calim Desert, west of the Trade Way. Because it was located in one of the primary regions where the spirits of Calim and Memnon clashed, the stones of the city were pulverized to sand and tiny fragments.
Dashadjen was founded sometime before . After serving as a fortress city for Calims armies in the Era of Skyfire, it was seized by the nation of Coramshan.
By 1374 DR, only a single structure from Dashadjen remained intact&mdashthe Altar of the Air. This shrine was built during the realm of Coramshan, and some unknown magic protected it over the millennia.
