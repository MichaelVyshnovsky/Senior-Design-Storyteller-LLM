        "mainbody": "Castle\nJastaath Castle was the name given to a massive ruined fortress that sat high on Mount Nar in Narfell.\nThe ruins were immense, and sat atop the western slopes of the mountain above a glacier. They were buried under a perpetual blanket of snow and ice.\nThe castle had been the seat of power for the ancient Nar kingdom of Jastaath. In ancient times, the magic of Jastaaths demonbinders had altered the weather on Mount Nar to make the castle warm and comfortable even in the winter, but after it was abandoned for unknown reasons, the castle fell into ruins that became buried beneath snow and ice.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, no explorers had successfully found the ruins owing to the harsh climate and the dracolich Kryonar, who laired nearby and was known to kill any visitors to the area.\nAt some point around or before the , the Red Wizard Branimern Rythil and her minions arrived at the ruins seeking the lost magical knowledge of Jastaaths ancient demonbinders. They destroyed Kryonar and erected a towering stronghold amidst the castle ruins, which was visible from as far away as Bildoobaris. From her stronghold, Branimern spent the next several decades researching and plotting to conquer the surrounding areas. All the while, the local Nars stayed away from the ruin out of fear that Kryonar might still be alive.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the castle ruins were home to Branimern Rythil and her demon and fey minions, including a fearsome fomorian known as Hughan."
