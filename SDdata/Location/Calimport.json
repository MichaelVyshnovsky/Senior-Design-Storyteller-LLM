The population of the city could swell to as much as double during the spring and summer months when trade was at its peak.

        "Geography": {
            "Architecture": "Because Calimport had such a long history, including at least twelve times the city had been almost completely destroyed by fire or other calamity, most of the older buildings of the city had been rebuilt or merged into newer ones. One could find ancient byways, rooms, or other structures integrated into others.",
            "Defenses": "Perhaps surprisingly, since the [[Seventh Age of Calimshan]], the city did not have a full wall around it. Even so, the city would have been very difficult to place under siege due to its massive size. Moreover, because of its walled [[sabban]]s and [[drudach]]s&mdash;as described below&mdash;it would be next to impossible to march an army deep into Calimport.",
            "Organization": ""
        },
        "Government": {
            "Armed Forces": "As in other Calishite cities, Calimport's domestic security forces were the [[amlakkar]], the city watch, whoseduties were to see to the peace and protection of the drudach to which they were assigned.<ref>\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], the city maintained 12,000 amlakkar and their officers, which was twice the usual amount one would find in other cities of Calimshan. This number, however, proved insufficient to deal with massive horde of people living in the city.\n\nThe syl-pasha's army included 7,500 soldiers stationed in the city, and the navy included 2,000 sailors and naval workers.\n\nRich nobles, including the syl-pasha, also employed large numbers of armed guards. Approximately, 15,000 such warriors were present in the city, in addition to the official troops."
        },
        "Trade": "One could find anything they wanted in Calimport, if they were willing to pay a high enough price. Calimport had more to offer in sales than even Waterdeep.\n\nThe black market was alive and well in Calimport. The amlakkar tended to turn a blind eye to it.\n\nThe city was a well-known [[Spelljammer|spelljamming]] port, the second-largest in [[Faerûn]] after [[Waterdeep]]. Similarly to Waterdeep, spelljamming vessels were required to land on the water several miles from the city and make their final approach by sea. The reason for this law was that items in trade that came from [[wildspace]] were greatly sought after by the local population and could fetch much higher prices than equivalent local goods. This rule was ruthlessly enforced by the merchants' guilds; trespassers would either be found dead the next day or simply disappear, their spelljammers auctioned to the highest bidder.\n\nSpelljamming merchants enjoyed the city's exports of [[magic item]]s, exotic spices, alchemical supplies, silk, [[gem]]s, and [[horse]]s, as well as the locally produced and extremely popular [[trika]], a sweet and strong [[wine]] made from [[palintrike]]. Calimport imported food products such as grains, fruits and vegetables, [[ale]], and [[wine]].",
        "History": {
            "The Calim Empire": "''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-7800}}, the noble [[djinn]]i lord, [[Calim]], and his human and halfling slaves arrived in Calimshan, in the area where Calimport would later be founded, and formed the [[Calim Empire]]. The slaves built Calimport and were the first inhabitants of the city, forming the culture of Lord Calim.\n\nApproximately ten years after its founding, Calimport was razed by a flight of dragons. The city was rebuilt with [[genie]] magic within a year.\n\nThe [[First Era of Skyfire]], began around {{Yearlink|-6500}}, as Calim warred against the [[efreet]]i Memnon. Their doom due to the intervention of the [[elf|elves]] ended the Calim Empire and Calim's reign in Calimport.",
            "Coramshan": "With Calim gone, the humans and the dwarves rebelled against the last of the djinn in Calimshan and by {{Yearlink|-6060}} ousted the last of the djinn from Calim's realm, forming the kingdom of [[Coramshan]]. While the dwarves founded [[High Shanatar]], the humans once again rebuilt Calimport.",
            "The First Age of Calimshan": "Sometime around {{Yearlink|-5000}}, Coramshan and the kingdom of [[Mir]] united to form the kingdom of Calimshan. The [[bakkal]]s of the [[First Age of Calimshan|First Age]] ruled from Calimport until the [[Sunset Plague]] in {{Yearlink|-3332}} nearly annihilated the population of the city. It remained empty for nearly a century after.",
            "The Second Age of Calimshan": "The [[Tavihr Dynasty|Tavihr]] bakkal dynasty of the [[Second Age of Calimshan|Second Age]] was assassinated in {{Yearlink|-2381}} in a fire that also destroyed the western half of Calimport. This destruction was combined with a series of guild wars. When the [[Erehnir Dynasty]] took power shortly thereafter, they rebuilt the city again. The Erehnirs were the ones who introduced much of Calimport's religious imagery and artistic style, with the building of great temples and monuments, which would remain present well into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
            "The Third Age of Calimshan": "Two-thirds of Calimport was destroyed again at the start of the [[Third Age of Calimshan]] when, in {{Yearlink|-1839}}, [[Ylveraasahlisar]] the Rose Dragon conquered Calimport and sat herself on the throne of Calimshan. She ruled for over a hundred years until the humans rebelled once again by slaying the dragon in {{Yearlink|-1726}}. The leader of the dragonslayers, [[Rafak el Cajaan]] became the new ruler of Calimport and Calimshan.\n\nCalimport, along with the [[Cajaan Dynasty]], fell again in {{Yearlink|-1428}}, this time to an army of [[beholders]] led by [[Qyraaptir]] the Bloodeye. Qyraaptir \"sat\" on the throne of Calimport for 26 years. At the end of his reign, fires were set to Calimport, in an attempt to drive him and the other beholders away. Calimport was the first Calishite city freed of the beholder tyranny.\n\nThe war with the beholders continued until {{Yearlink|-1080}}. By that time, Calimport was again the capital of all Calimshan, and a boost in trade saw the city to nearly double in size.\n\nThe Third Age did not end well for Calimport, however; a series of plagues wiped out half its population of slaves and 80% of its total population. While never proven, it was suspected that the plagues were created by rival kingdom [[Jhaamdath]].",
            "The Fourth Age of Calimshan": "During the [[Fourth Age of Calimshan]], [[drow]] slave raids in Calimshan were common, collectively being called the \"[[Night Wars]]\". In {{Yearlink|-691}}, drow raided Calimport and destroyed the Caleph's Palace and slew the members of the [[Vihad Dynasty]]. Several decades later, the Calishite army was ordered by the [[syl-pasha]] to set fire to Calimport, where they held control of a quarter of the city, in hopes of driving the drow out. Finally, in {{Yearlink|-620}}, the syl-pasha's trade negotiations with the drow succeeded, though it still took until {{Yearlink|-530}} for the Night Wars to cease entirely.\n\n{{Yearlink|-446}} saw another terrible tragedy to the city of Calimport, when a fire destroyed almost the entire Calishite armada stationed in the port and 70% of the city.\n\nYet a third major conflagration was attempted in this age, yet it failed. It was intentionally set in {{Yearlink|-375}} by Syl-Pasha [[Akkab el Evyrtaan]] in an attempt to control the [[Empire Plague]], which had slain a third of Calimport's population by that time. The syl-pasha abandoned the city, and priests of [[Talona]] attempted to seize control. Few remained in the city except for [[rogue]]s. The followers of [[Shar]] fought back, resulting in many violent deaths. When the plague ended in {{Yearlink|-370}}, Akkab returned. He brutally killed many of the remaining population, seeking to remove any plague-carriers or the worshipers of Talona and Shar whom he considered traitors. Those who survived fled into the undercity.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-339}}, the [[Fall of Netheril]] caused the destruction of two entire sabbans, when magic ceased temporarily. At least 7,000 people died from this destruction.\n\nDespite these disasters, by {{Yearlink|-227}}, Calimport had grown to its largest size ever, with a population over 75,000. For the next 800 years, it was the largest port city in all of Faerûn.",
            "The Fifth Age of Calimshan": "The [[Fifth Age of Calimshan|Fifth Age]] began in {{Yearlink|-200}} with the assassination of Syl-Pasha [[Kalil el Evyrtaan]] from thousands of viper bites. His successor, [[Asraf el Majizar]], notably made Calimport into a more organized city with trade and workers' guilds.\n\nAsraf's son, [[Malik el Majizar]], was a rare good ruler. His leadership nearly doubled the trade to Calimshan. Even so, he was assassinated in {{Yearlink|-188}}. This began the [[Throne Wars]]. During this time, the ruler of Calimport no longer controlled all Calimshan, for the next two years saw a total of 39 different rulers take and lose the throne in Calimport. The [[Throne Fires]], a series of seven separate burnings, were sparked during this time, and the flames consumed 43% of the population and nearly two-thirds of the city. At last, in {{Yearlink|-187}}, [[Tasyn el Tarshaj]] from [[Manshaka]] took the throne and began to bring stability to the city and the kingdom again.",
            "The Age of Shoon": "Only the first emperor of the [[Shoon Imperium]] ruled from Calimport, [[Akkabar Shoon the Elder|Akkabar el Shoon]], from {{Yearlink|-77}} to {{Yearlink|-2}}. His successor, [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|Qysar]] [[Amahl Shoon III]] moved the capital to [[Shoonach]], and Calimport became an almost-deserted city. The undercity, (nicknamed the \"[[Muzad]]\",) generated by dozens of fires and collapses, became more powerful than ever during this time.\n\nIn [[200 DR]], rogue factions set fire to Calimport, killing 60% of the population and destroying the temples of [[Bane]], [[Mystra]], and Talona.\n\nAnother great fire occurred near the end of the Imperium, when the current qysar, [[Shoon VII]] burned most of the Muzad and sewers in an attempt to root out all criminal activity from Calimport. This fire slaughtered nearly nine-tenths of all undercity dwellers. Calimport would take more than three decades to rebuild itself.",
            "The Seventh Age of Calimshan": "When [[Amahl Shoon VII]] was slain by King [[Strohm I]] of [[Tethyr]] in [[450 DR]], every city in Calimshan went into political upheaval. In Calimport, ultimately [[Fahd el Daosiin]] took the title of syl-pasha. Only seven years later, the new syl-pasha and his family were killed when the entire Pasha's Sabban was magically destroyed in an explosion that also set fire to the majority of western Calimport.\n\nBy [[533 DR]], slave-soldiers known as [[mameluks]] led a revolution against the rulers of Calimport and were victorious. They took control, abolished slavery, and changed the capitol of Calimshan to Manshaka.\n\nThe [[Port Fires]] of [[733 DR]] destroyed the docks of Calimport. This was a ploy by the [[Rundeen]] to enact control over trade in the region.\n\nIn [[864 DR]], deep below Calimport in a former drow temple, the [[Twisted Rune]] was founded by [[Rysellan the Dark]]. Within several decades, when some of the mameluks returned to Calimport in an attempt to reclaim power, the Twisted Rune manipulated events to place their agent, [[Bollus el Kahdan]] in power as syl-pasha. Through Bollus, the Rune planned the destruction by fire of much of the upper city, restoring a great deal of power to the Muzad.\n\nDuring this era, Calimport's massive sewer system was constructed.",
            "The Eighth Age of Calimshan": "During the [[Rage of Dragons]] in the {{yearlinkName|1018}}, Calimport and [[Keltar]] were attacked and obliterated by the [[dragon]] [[Sapphiraktar the Blue]].<ref>\n\nTwo centuries later, in the {{yearlinkName|1235}}, an army of [[orc]]s known as the [[Black Horde]] conquered Calimshan, as well as most of the western realms, before the combined forces of [[Waterdeep]], [[Silverymoon]], and [[Baldur's Gate]] drove off the horde.\n\nFour decades of trade wars were responsible for the disintegration of Calimshan as a unified kingdom, as Calimport, Memnon, and [[Almraiven]] became independent city-states. In Calimport, [[el Djenispool]] family took the syl-pasha's seat.",
            "The Ninth Age of Calimshan": "During the reign of the Djenispools, much of the power in Calimport was in the control of guilds, such as the one run by [[Pasha Pook]], and criminal organizations such as the [[Shadow Thieves]]. A great storm devastated Calimport in [[1345 DR]], which was a fake memory implanted into the survivors by the [[Night Parade]] to disguise their evil festival.",
            "The Tenth Age of Calimshan": "When the [[Time of Troubles]] came in [[1358 DR]], the underworld of Calimport was thrown into chaos, as the [[Bhaal Death]] eliminated many thieves and rogues. The [[Darkstalker Wars]] erupted at this time, and [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]] from Manshaka used this opportunity to begin his rise to power.\n\nDuring the Nightcleansing of [[1359 DR]], the [[Harpers]] led by [[Myrmeen Lhal]], Lord of [[Arabel]], unmasked the Night Parade infestation in Calimport and interrupted another Festival of Renewal. Nearly all of the Night Paraders were destroyed by the raging town populace.",
            "Second Era of Skyfire": "When Calim was freed from his imprisonment, so too was Lord Memnon. This led to the [[Second Era of Skyfire]], with Calim retaking Calimport, while Lord Memnon would take the self-titled Memnon. In Calimport, the [[windsoul genasi]] took over and made all other races&mdash;including humans&mdash;slaves, forcing them to participate in gladiatorial games. Led by [[Marod el Arhapan]], the windsoul genasi pledged themselves to the djinn. This led the djinn to view the genasi as children; the [[earthsoul genasi]] formed the low caste of the genasi hierarchy, and the [[firesoul genasi]] became outlaws for pledging themselves to Lord Memnon.",
            "Rise of the Genasi": "In [[1450 DR]], the Second Era of Skyfire came to a close with both Calim and Lord Memnon disappearing, but the djinn of Calimport wished to bring Calim back to Calimport in order to invade both Memnon and Almraiven. The djinni [[Shahrokh]] took over as the vizier to Pasha Marod el Araphan. Marod began looking for his son, [[Cephas]], in a plan hatched by Shahrokh to bring Calim back to the Prime Material Plane to start the Third Era of Skyfire. Cephas killed Marod, bringing an end to Shahrokh's plans. Shahrokh, however, began looking for a book that would free Calim. Sharokh's search for the book is currently ongoing, and it is unclear as of now if he has succeeded, failed or is still looking."
