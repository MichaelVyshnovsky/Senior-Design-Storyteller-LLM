Fraaszummdin, also known by the alias Steederhome, was a small kingdom of duergar found underground near the Firepeaks in the Hordelands in 1375 DR.
This kingdom was located roughly  underneath the Sunrise Mountains of northern Thay. The closest community to them of any note was the Trun’zoyl’zl district of Undrek’Thoz.
Exiles from Fraaszummdin often found sanctuary in the nearby dwarven kingdom of Siremun because of their expertise in breeding rothé.
