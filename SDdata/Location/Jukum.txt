'''Jukum''' was the second-largest [[Iulutiun]] settlement.

==Geography==
Jukum was located on southeastern shore of the [[Lugalpgotak Sea]],

==Layout==
Unlike most [[Ulutiun]] settlements, Jukum was laid out in an organized manner. It was divided into four districts. The north district contained a fresh-water pool and small canals brought water to the homes of the villagers. The east district was the location of the yearly [[Ulutiun dictionary#S|''sukkiruchit'']] market. The southern district was divided off for games and feasts, and the western district for the butchering of animals. The western district contained twelve separate [[ukujik]] for this purpose.

[[Snowhouse]]s were constructed in straight rows, and the entire village was surrounded in a circle by a dozen [[quaggi]] for communal meals.

==Government==
Like most large Iulutiun villages, Jukum was overseen by a village council, or [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''iquemelum'']].

==Culture==
The culture of Jukum was one that strongly encouraged excellence in the arts. The village was full of beautiful ice sculptures, children learned from an early age how to play music on bone flutes, and choirs sang epic, poetic tales at the end of feasts. Every month, the village even held a poetry festival, which was open to the citizens of other villages as well. The ''iquemelum'' would award prizes of mittens, meat, or other valuables to the winners.

Jukum was also one of the two locations where the annual ''sukkiruchit'' festival took place&mdash;the other location being [[Lilinuk]]. This trade fair attracted craftsmen and hunters from all over [[Alpuk]]. A typical ''sukkiruchit'' would gather over a thousand attendees.

==History==
Around [[1350 DR]], during an experiment in magic, one of the village's [[anagakok]]s, [[Dygah]], poisoned the water supply. For this crime he was exiled. Dygah afterwards vowed revenge.

==Inhabitants==
The villagers of Jukum were especially warm and welcoming, even for Iulutiuns.

Among the inhabitants were the following persons of note:
* Dygah, the anagakok who was exiled for poisoning the water supply,
* [[Joqui]], one of the [[Ulutiun dictionary#K|''kiam'']]
* [[Kallak]], Joqui's daughter, who was severely burned,
* [[Mafwik]], an anagakok interested in magical research.
