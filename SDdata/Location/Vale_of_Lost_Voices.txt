The Vale of Lost Voices was a sacred burial place for honored elf warriors located in Cormanthor. 
Rauthauvyrs Road passed though the middle of the Vale, and while travelers were not disturbed if they stuck to the road, any attempt to interfere with the tombs and mausoleums usually ended poorly for the adventurer. 
Created on the spot where Venom ambushed and killed those who had killed his mate, the Vale of Lost Voices was guarded as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR by baelnorns from the sylvan elf clan Audark. Over time, the place had been used by other elves to bury their honored dead. 
A guardian of the Vale was a grumpy, if not insane, old dwarf named Durkin. He lived in an abandoned elvish castle on a rocky tor in the Vale.
Cormanthors drow gave the Vale a wide berth.
The Eldreth Veluuthra considered the Vale to be a sacred place.
