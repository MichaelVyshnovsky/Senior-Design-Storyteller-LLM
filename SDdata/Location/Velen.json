        "mainbody": "'''Velen''' was a port city on the [[Tethyrian peninsula]] overlooking the [[Sea of Swords]]. The coastal city served as the capital of duchy of [[Cape Velen]], within the Kingdom of [[Tethyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and onward into the 15{{th}} century after the realm's independence was declared. It was famous for being exceptionally haunted, though this was hardly noticed by the city's citizens.\n\nDue to its location as one of the western-most coastal cities on the mainland of [[Faer√ªn]], Velen has been a stalwart defender against the pirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]]. It has embraced this role for centuries and has maintained a well-trained city guard and formidable naval forces.",
        "Description": {
            "Inhabitants": "The Velean were a hearty and resourceful people, who by and large, maintained a lighthearted disposition and always seemed to pick themselves up and dust themselves off when faced with adversity.\n\n[[Ghost]]s were a common sight within the city's walls, appearing for a brief moments before disappearing into darkness. The Velean citizens had come to largely ignore these sightings, and disregarded the spectral appearances.",
            "Relations": "Citizens of [[Zazesspur]] thought the citizens of Velen to be unsophisticated, \"ghost-crazed\" backwoods folk."
        },
        "History": "Prior to the 15{{th}} century, Velen was a city within the kingdom of [[Tethyr]]. However, in [[1424 DR]] they declared their independence from the Forest Nation and became an autonomous duchy. While this declaration created initial tension with Tethyr, over time relations between the two realms were re-established and they considered one another as allies.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Blackthorn's Brew]]: This luxurious inn offered the best beer and service in the Tethyrian peninsula\n*[[Dolphin's Leap]]: A temple to [[Valkur]] with a silver dolphin on top. The local priests were known to sell sea charts and healing services.\n*[[Morgan's Inn]]: A large but very comfortable inn run by the couple, [[Gordrith Snowcastle|Gordrith]] and [[Farlorea Snowcastle]]\n*[[Shipsgrave Tower]]: A temple to [[Umberlee]] with a sinister reputation. Rumours hold that Umberlee herself was able to summon lightning from the tower.\n*[[The Yardarm]]: A tavern, famous for its dish \"tonguelash\", which included sliced pears.\n*[[Home of the Stalwarts]]: a temple dedicated to [[Helm]]"
