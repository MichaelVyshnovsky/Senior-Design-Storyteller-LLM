        "mainbody": "'''Holy Hill Farm''' was a farm related to the faith of [[Ilmater]] the Crying God.\n\nIn the [[1266 DR|Year of the Leaping Frog, 1266 DR]], Holy Hill Farm was the site of a bloody battle between feuding factions of the [[church of Ilmater]]. The holy war had broken out around [[1265 DR]] when Archsufferer [[Bloirt Waelarn]] of the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]] had denounced his fellow Ilmatari priests of the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]] for refusing to relinquish the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the faith. On one side were the Mussum priests and the [[Companions of the Noble Heart]] paladin order, and on the other were Waelarn, his followers, the [[Holy Warriors of Suffering]], and the [[Knights of the Bleeding Shield]].",
