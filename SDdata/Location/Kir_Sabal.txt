'''Kir Sabal''' was a cliffside [[monastery]] in [[Chult]] that was home to a flock of [[aarakocra]] monks as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The monastery was located near the [[Nsi Wastes]], in the eastern jungles of Chult.

===Geographical Features===
Kir Sabal was nestled into the side of a massive plateau that overlooked the surrounding jungle canopy. It was only accessible on the ground by a series of sloping stone ramps and walkways.

==Defenses==
The aarakocra were forced to defend themselves from the [[gargoyle]]s of [[Omu]].

==Notable Locations==
The monastery featured a large wooden shrine that depicted the patron deity of Chult, [[Ubtao]], in the form of a [[Tabaxi]].

==Inhabitants==
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Kir Sabal was home to a dozen aarakocra nests housing 56 individuals, about a third of whom were juveniles. They lived their lives according to rigid tradition and strict behavioral rules. They hunted and fished along the [[River Olung]] and maintained gardens atop their safe plateau.

Notable inhabitants as of that time included:
* [[Asharra]], the elder who led the community.
* [[Mokababu]], who aspired to keep alive the legacy of [[Omu]].
* [[Nephyr]], who would patrol the skies of the jungle.

In addition to the aarakocra, Kir Sabal was home to two [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] children, [[Mwaxanaré|Princess Mwaxanaré]] and [[Na|Prince Na]]. These two traced their ancestry to Omuan royalty.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Kir Sabal was under a constant threat being targeted by a powerful spell-slinging [[pterafolk]] [[Nrakka]]. Intelligent and cruel creatures relentlessly attacked the monastery and its occupants. The aarakocra of Kir Sabal sought aid against the pterafolk among adventurers who arrived to Chult investigating the mysterious ''[[death curse]]''.
