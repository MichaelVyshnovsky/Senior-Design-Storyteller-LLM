        "mainbody": "'''Askalet''' was the easternmost of the three islands located south of [[Thelve]] and southwest from the the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]].",
        "Description": "Askalet was a rocky outcropping that rose above the [[Sea of Swords]]. The island of fissured [[granite]] with temperate woods growing among the cracks. Askalet had rock-basin pools of freshwater collected from melted snow and summer fogs as well as several freshwater springs. A small two-vessel harbor was located at the center of the island's southern shores. Not far from it stood a [[fish]]-filled freshwater pond at the center of a wooded alley – the source of a dozen freshwater springs that trickled down the slop, eventually emptying into the [[Sea of Swords]]. In winter, the spring and their miniature waterfalls froze into a delicate and beautiful ice wall. Beyond the wooded valley, Askalet was a collection of wooded cliffs and ridges.\n\nAskalet's eastern side was {{SI|3.5|mile|k|long=yes}} long, northern and western shores were {{SI|2|mile|k|long=yes}} long each.\n\nThe island was once inhabited, but by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it only held at least three ruins: an overgrown cottage with its roof collapsed located in the westernmost dell on Askalet. A ruined stone estate stood in the valley not far from the harbor, rumored to hide a pirate's trapped treasure. Ruins of a castle rose above the sea atop the island's easternmost cliffs. The castle was falsely believed to had been a pirate-baron's keep and, at one point – a [[mage]]'s tower. [[Elminster Aumar]] theorized that the said wizard, [[Askalath]] was the island's namesake.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "Askalet was home to a massive population of seabirds numbered in thousands. The island's rocks were stained with the birds' [[guano]]. Several species of predatory sea creatures could also be found on the island. [[Deer]] and an occasion [[owlbear]] called the wooded labyrinth of rocks and fissure-caverns their home."
        },
        "History": "Askalet was once used by pirates and smugglers who likely gave the island its name. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the island's ruins were used by many as a shelter through the years. Despite that, the island was far from thoroughly looted. [[Askalath's tower]] had a well-hidden cellar with a shaft that dropped down into the dangerous depths of the [[Underdark]]. Some believed that the wizard used the shaft as a well, magically retrieving water from the far underground. However, the shaft's true value was in the multitude of cellar complexes, with their entrances opening into the endless shaft's lower reaches."
