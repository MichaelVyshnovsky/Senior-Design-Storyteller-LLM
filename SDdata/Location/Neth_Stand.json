        "mainbody": "The '''Neth Stand''' was a dark, thick forest on the [[Lake of Steam]].{{Cite interactive atlas|B1cSElc}}",
        "Etymology": "Some people in the [[Border Kingdoms]] were of the belief that the forest was named because of the refugees from [[Netheril]] making a stand in the forest. Sages preferred to believe that the word \"stand\" merely referred to the thick concentration of tall dark trees here.",
        "Description": "It contained underground volcanic vents that emitted a sulfurous mist. The wood here was valuable, despite the need to treat it to get rid of the sulfur smell.{{Cite web/More Lake of Steam and Dragon Coast}}\n\nAs of [[1374 DR]], the forest was extremely dense and dark, containing phosphorescent [[fungus|fungi]], some of which could move and had intelligence. Among the [[thornbush]]es were carnivorous plants and the forest was inhabited by [[spider]]s. \n\nA range of crumbling rock faces ran north to south through the forest. They had no official name, and were peppered with caves and ledges. [[Wyvern]]s and [[peryton]]s densely inhabited this area, making it attractive as a food source for [[dragon]]s from the surrounding areas. Around this time, [[Thay]] launched many expeditions here in search of powerful magic, at the cost of many lives. Many [[Calimshan|Calishite]] hunters also lost their lives here over the years.",
        "Inhabitants": "The forest contained a tribe of semi-aquatic [[troll]]s and a group of [[wereshark]]s, who opposed one another.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed that the presence of so many hostile creatures here could be put down to [[deepspawn]] or priests of [[Malar]] at work, the presence of powerful spellcasters wanting to stay in isolation, or the presence of ''[[portal]]s'' from which the monsters were emerging."
