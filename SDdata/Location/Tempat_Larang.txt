'''Tempat Larang''' was a lost city of the [[Anok-Imaskar]] empire built in the 3{{rd}} millennium before [[Dale Reckoning]]. It stood in the [[Shao Mountains]] of southern [[Kara-Tur]].<ref group="note">''Ronin Challenge'' has [[Shou Lung]] settling the Shao Mountains and Tempat Larang, which is then destroyed in a volcanic eruption, but this is only "centuries" or "hundreds of years" before its setting date. However, ''The Grand History of the Realms'' later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time-frame. Thus, in-universe, the various mentions in ''Ronin Challenge'' appear to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of Anok-Imaskar and the [[First Kingdom]] of Shou Lung. This article selects references to the early empire in ''Ronin Challenge'' and assumes they apply to Anok-Imaskar where they suit the retconned history. However, this retcon shifts events from centuries earlier to millennia earlier.

==History==
Anok-Imaskar was a prosperous empire that quickly spread east, north, and south across Kara-Tur. Eventually, to better govern the new southern lands his nation had claimed, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-2300}}, Emperor [[Kujawa]] decided to found a second capital city, Tempat Larang.

The emperor ordered the great [[Larang Highway]] be built along existing frontier outposts into the Shao Mountains. Many great magical [[scroll]]s and [[artifact]]s were traded from Tempat Larang to the empire during his reign.

However, the southern empire was harassed by the [[Segara Sea Lords]], powerful and far-ranging pirates of the [[Segara Sea]]. When [[Sangkal Chunbi]], governor of Tempat Larang, issued warrants for their arrest, the pirate leader [[Chan Chiong]] tried to cut Tempat Larang off from the empire by seizing [[Sampar]], the empire's only southern harbor. However, the canny Chunbi defeated Chan Chiong through a ruse and rehired the pirates, transforming them into a southern fleet for the empire.

Unfortunately, the nearby volcano [[Mount Tengkorak|Mount Bakos]] erupted in {{Yearlink|-2113}},<ref group="note">''The Grand History of the Realms'' uses the name "Mount Bakos" but this name does not appear in any other source. However, ''Ronin Challenge'' tells that Tempat Larang was destroyed by the volcano "Mount Tengkorak", which is located near the ruins of Tempat Larang on the accompanying map. While it is likely that "Bakos" was the [[Roushoum]] name for the volcano, this cannot be corroborated. Nevertheless, for simplicity, this article assumes this is the case. covering Tempat Larang in ash and lava and in poisonous gases that slew the citizens. Thanks to its thick stone walls, the citadel survived intact, and the great [[wu jen]] of the city turned the army into stone to save them before they themselves died.

Over the following decades, the empire's southwestern lands were abandoned. According to later accounts, the emperor thought this disaster was an omen from the gods, and hence abandoned his plans for the south, even erasing them from official records. Thus only vague legends of Tempat Larang survived.
