Argentor was a village of earthsoul genasi located in southern Tethyr within the Mir Spires.
The villages dwellings were hollowed out from the spires by the genasi using their innate ability to shape rock.
In 1479 DR, Argentor was attacked by minotaurs sent by the ruler of Calimport to abduct his long lost son, Cephas, who was traveling with a circus giving a performance at the village.
