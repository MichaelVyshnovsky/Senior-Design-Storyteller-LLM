Mhiilamniir was a city of the elven realm of Eaerlann.
The city stood in the heart of the High Forest, less than two days journey away from the west end of the Old Road and three days journey east of the Lost Peaks.
During the height of the kingdom of Eaerlann, Mhiilamniir was formerly the seat of power for several of the priesthoods of the Seldarine in the North.
The settlement was destroyed in the demonic uprising from Hellgate Keep, and most of it was overgrown with moss and ivy. The female green dragon Chloracridara claimed the whole city and its environs as her domain. She had lived in the partially standing ruins of the temple to Corellon Larethian for six hundred years by 1370 DR. Her rabid paranoia and offsprings hunting made the surrounding area quite dangerous, too hazardous for elven pilgrims to visit any of the temples.
The city was home to a number of major temples. While the largest was the temple of Corellon, the very oldest was the Temple Beyond Time, dedicated to Labelas Enoreth. According to Labelasan religious texts, it had stood during the early history of Aryvandaar, circa .
A male half-elf half-dragon woodsman was known to claim that he could grant an audience with Chloracridara for a fee.
