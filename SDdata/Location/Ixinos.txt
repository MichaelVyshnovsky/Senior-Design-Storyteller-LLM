This island rested southeast of Ilighôn, south of Wavecrest, and northwest of Reth. It was also where the Vilhon Reach met the Sea of Fallen Stars.Todd Gamble, Dennis Kauth, and Robert Lazzaretti http//www.wizards.com/dnd/images/wd_maps/FRposterLarge_150.jpg 
As of 1370 DR, the island was populated by a matriarchal tribe, comprised almost entirely of women, and ruled by Queen Elissa Tarixon. The island nation refused all visitors, even diplomatic envoys, and would trade only with select ships captained by women. The few men who existed on the island were considered highly-valuable slaves.
Ixinos was also the home base of the all-women mercenary company known as the She-Wolves, who secured Ixinos from pirate incursions as well as sought out mercenary opportunities throughout the Vilhon Reach.
