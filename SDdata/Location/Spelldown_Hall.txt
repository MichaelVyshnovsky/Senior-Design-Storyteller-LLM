'''Spelldown Hall''' was a cavernous location. Duels before [[Mystra]] were held there for centuries.

==Description==
The ruined hall had some of its stone converted into glassy flows, with glowing energies embedded in it. There was some rubble, and stalactites of sorts on the ceiling. The hall also had doors.

==Activities==
Ritual duels between mages had been held in the location for centuries, and it showed extensive scarring for it. It was possible for duelists to claim [[Right of subsumption]] before [[Mystra]] and the [[Mages Arcane]] on such duels, which were one-on-one per the rules. The doors were sealed with blue fire when a duel was in progress.

==History==
At some point prior to {{yearlink|1372}}, the Hall was used in a battle where [[Elminster Aumar]] was challenged by a [[lich]], who, in violation of the rules, had brought allies: a [[death tyrant]] with some of its eyes replaced by jaws, a [[gargoyle]] with a black, flaming sword, a [[naga]], and a [[drow]] with two spellspun daggers. The lich attempted to claim right of subsumption anyway. Rather than meeting his spells with spells, Elminster struck them all down with silver fire called down directly from [[Mystra]], causing extensive damage to the other end of the hall.

==Inhabitants==
There were restless spirits, bound and helpless, in the hall.
