        "mainbody": "eladrin\nXorhun, also known as Corellons Cradle and Lifeblood Falls, was a special city in the Turmish area, on the edge of the Halondar Valley. This community of elves and gnomes hearkened back to the communities of the ancient elven civilization.\nXorhun served as the garden spot of the non-human population, especially elves, having an unusual effect on elves and gnomes, increasing their fertility rate. Children were born at a rate two to three times the norm for their race. One must live in the area for five years before the fertility effects began to show.\nXorhun served primarily as a stopping point along the Halondar, the road that connected Hlondeth to the south and Alagh√¥n to the north. It was populated primarily by craftsmen and merchants.\nThe city of Xorhun was established before 270 DR. It was believed the city was inhabited by eladrin, who migrated to the city of Myth Drannor.\nXorhun was the only open elven city in the Vilhon Reach. Predominantly elven, the city was home to a large community of gnomes, and a very small number of humans and half-elves. In the 15 century DR, a kobold tribe from the Orsraun Mountains found a new home in Xorhuns ghetto that became known as the Koboldtown."
