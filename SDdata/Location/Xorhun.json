Never be- fore have I seen so many elves gathered together in one place. The stories claim that living here increases the birth rate in some races. Having been there, I cant deny it.''|[[Adamar Session]], [[bard]] of [[Starmantle]]}}",
        "Description": "Xorhun served as the garden spot of the non-[[human]] population, especially [[elves]], having an unusual effect on elves and [[gnomes]], increasing their fertility rate. Children were born at a rate two to three times the norm for their race. One must live in the area for five years before the fertility effects began to show.",
        "Trade": "Xorhun served primarily as a stopping point along the [[Halondar]], the road that connected [[Hlondeth]] to the south and [[Alaghôn]] to the north. It was populated primarily by craftsmen and merchants.",
        "History": "The city of Xorhun was established before [[270 DR]]. It was believed the city was inhabited by [[eladrin]], who migrated to the city of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Xorhun was the only open elven city in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Predominantly elven, the city was home to a large community of gnomes, and a very small number of humans and [[half-elves]]. In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[kobold]] tribe from the [[Orsraun Mountains]] found a new home in Xorhun's ghetto that became known as the Koboldtown."
