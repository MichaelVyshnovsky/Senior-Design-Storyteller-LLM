        "History": "In early fall of [[1372 DR]], one of the inhabitants of Etabalon, a winged and horned [[humanoid]] [[wizard]] named [[Mogdor]] embarked on a quest of retrieving his stolen servant, the [[imp]] [[Sujit]]. Were he ever successful, Mogdor was ready to step through a ''[[gate]]'' back to the icy planes of Etabalon with his recaptured servant. That was not to be however. Instead of retrieving Sujit, Mogdor received a package that held an angry imprisoned [[demilich]], [[Extallimix]], who swiftly destroyed the planar wizard with a flurry of powerful magics."
