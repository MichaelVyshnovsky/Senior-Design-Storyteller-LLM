        "mainbody": "tabalon was an obscure planar realm outside of Toril.\nEtabalon was known to consist of arctic icy plains.\nIn early fall of 1372 DR, one of the inhabitants of Etabalon, a winged and horned humanoid wizard named Mogdor embarked on a quest of retrieving his stolen servant, the imp Sujit. Were he ever successful, Mogdor was ready to step through a gate back to the icy planes of Etabalon with his recaptured servant. That was not to be however. Instead of retrieving Sujit, Mogdor received a package that held an angry imprisoned demilich, Extallimix, who swiftly destroyed the planar wizard with a flurry of powerful magics."
