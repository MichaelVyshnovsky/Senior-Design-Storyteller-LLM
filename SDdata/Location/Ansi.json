        "mainbody": "nsi , meaning West Protecting Fortress, was a small town located in the northern regions of the Quoya Desert within the Hordelands around 1359 DR.\nThe small town of Ansi was little more than a fortified inn built near an oasis of bitter water.\nWhat little importance the town had came from the fact that it sat at the top of a narrow pass in the hills of the Quoya Desert, and only its close proximity to Shou Lung kept it from being totally unknown.\nThe town itself was mostly rundown buildings, surrounded by a wall of brick. The wells produced enough water for a few small melon farms, but farming in the area was difficult because of the constant winds blowing dust, which often accumulated along the walls, sometimes even spilling over.\nThe town offered few services, including a caravanserai, wool and hide dealers, a few melon farmers, and a pair of merchants who bought and sold goods with the nomads who came and went through the year. It also had a small temple to the Shou gods, serviced by a single priest.\nNo more than 100 people lived in this small settlement. Most, if not all, of them had Shou ancestry.\nLi Kao-teh, the owner of the caravanserai, was secretly an agent for the Shou Lung empire, reporting strangers and unusual events to the censors of the nearby province of Chukei."
