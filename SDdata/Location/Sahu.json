        "mainbody": "ahu was a large island in the Crowded Sea to the southwest of Afyal.\nLike in other places in the Ruined Kingdoms area of Zakhara, ancient ruins dotted the jungles and mountains, which were left here by two fallen empires the worshipers of Thasmudyan of old and, following it, the New Dynasty of the Necromancer Kings. Many dark secrets and dangers to would-be adventurers hid in land and buildings.\nSahu was also called the \"Isle of Serenity\", a name usually attributed to the calm lifestyle of its residents in the 1360s. The byword also had a much more ancient and sinister connotation, however \"Sahu\" itself was a word in the dead language of Kadari and can be loosely translated as \"Serene Eternity\", meaning nothing else but \"death\".\nTwo places of modern habitation, the villages of Misbahd and Jinutt, were located on the islands northern shore. The inner part of the island consisted of a wooded plateau with a mountain range called the Vishaps Spine along the center.\nAlong the shoreline of this island were ruined structures similar to the famed metal towers of Rogosto. But unlike the intact spires of that city, these were toppled and twisted heaps that littered the islands low shores in random clusters."
