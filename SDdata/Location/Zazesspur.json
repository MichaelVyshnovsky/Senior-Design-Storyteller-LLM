        "Description": "Architecturally and culturally, Zazesspur was an odd mixture of Tethyrian and [[Calimshan|Calishite]] influences, with others blended in. Most buildings were several stories tall and constructed of tight-fitting stone. They were decorated ornately around windows and doors and along the edges of the roofs.",
        "Geography": "The city was located on the [[Sword Coast]], south of the [[Starspire Peninsula]].\n\nThe coastal plains around Zazesspur were markedly more green than the lands further east and inland.  The city was bisected by the [[Sulduskoon River]] as it flowed into the sea.",
        "Layout": "[[File:Zazesspur map.png|thumb|right|300px|''A map of the city, showing its districts and gates.'']]\nThe river divided the city into a southern [[Zazesspur/Low City|Low City]] and a northern [[Zazesspur/High City|High City]]. The Low City was older, having been built over older ruins. The High City was larger and represented what most folks though of when hearing the word \"Zazesspur\".<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />\n\nThe High City was divided into six districts, which included:<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />\n* [[Zazesspur/High City/The Bindery|The Bindery]]\n* [[Zazesspur/High City/Wainwrights' District|Wainwrights' District]]\n* [[Zazesspur/High City/Garden District|Garden District]]\n* [[Zazesspur/High City/Market District|Market District]]\n* [[Zazesspur/High City/Carpets District|Carpets District]]\n* [[Zazesspur/High City/Ships' District|Ships' District]]\n\nThe Low City was not officially divided into districts; however, it still had two distinct regions or boroughs&mdash;the [[Zazesspur/Low City#The Fortress|The Fortress]] and [[Zazesspur/Low City#Karlaggar|Karlaggar]]. Karlaggar was a mercenaries' quarter. The Fortress was a sector full of smithies and warehouses.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />",
        "Defenses": "The walls of the city stood {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} high in some places. They had many gaps in them after the fall of the royal family during the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]]. \n\nSeven gates provided access into the city. Entering the High City were the [[Sea Gate (Zazesspur)|Sea Gate]] from the west, the [[Trade Gate]] from the north, the [[Dung Gate]] from northeast, and the [[South Gate (Zazesspur)|South Gate]] south. [[Karlag's Gate]] and the [[Hill Gate]] entered the Low City, while the remaining \"gate\" was the port entrance to the river. All gates were [[wikipedia:Barbican|barbican]] style with two [[wikipedia:Portcullis|portcullises]]. All gates were guarded by at least six guards, who could sound alarms to summon more. They were open only during daylight hours.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp69-72 />",
        "Government": "The city was ruled by a council of lords. and these had close connections with the [[Purple Hills Council]].\n\n[[Slavery]] had been illegal in Zazesspur for generations. Prostitution was legal.\n\nDuring the Interregnum, the city guard of Zazesspur bore [[crossbow]]s and [[bronze]] [[halberd]]s. They were uniformed in [[morion]]s and bronze [[cuirass]]es with puffy blue shirts and [[pantaloons]]. The city guard served the city council and were a separate entity from the city police.",

        "History": "In ancient past, the area now occupied by Zazesspur was above major regions of [[Old Shanatar]]. Specifically, the catacombs of Zazesspur were once the subterranean city of [[Ultoksurllur]], which served as the capital of the [[Sondarr|Seastar Kingdom of Sondarr]], one of the eight subkingdoms of [[Deep Shanatar]]. Clan Ghalmrin then dwelled in Ultoksurllur. The dwarves built a surface city there as well; the name is forgotten, but evidence of dwarven stonework still remained in some of Zazesspur's roads and ramparts.<ref name=LoI1-T-p21>\n\nThe city was first settled by [[Calishite]] [[human]]s as a fishing village. In {{Yearlink|-1570}}, it became a fortified city and the seat of the Calishite [[Emir]] of Tethyr,<ref name=EotSS-p17 /><ref name=LoI1-T-p23> whose palace was placed in the city's center.<ref name=LoI1-T-p23 /> At this point, the entire city was located south of the Sulduskoon River, in what would later be considered the Low City. The [[Forest of Tethir]] then bordered the river, and so the [[elves]] controlled the northern shore.<ref name=LoI1-T-p23 /> In {{Yearlink|-1320}}, slaves built the Trade Way from Zazesspur to [[Memnon]]. 20 years later, a road was begun heading east. 200 years later, in {{Yearlink|-1130}}, it finally reached what would later become [[Ithal Pass]] at the fortress of [[Akkabbel]].<ref name=LoI1-T-p23 />\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-387}}, Zazesspur was conquered by [[Tethyrian]] [[barbarian]]s<ref name=LoI1-T-p24> from the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]] and the [[Purple Hills]].<ref name=LoI1-T-p24 /> Calimshan maintained troops there for a time, but in the {{YearlinkName|-315}}, after a short siege, it was conquered and taken over by the Tethyrian tribes and renamed '''Fort Karlag''', after [[Karlag|their warlord]].<ref name=LoI1-T-p24 />\n\nBefore the start of the [[Shoon Imperium]], in the {{YearlinkName|-5}} King [[Amahl Shoon I]] restored the city's name to Zazesspur and constructed a new palace and court there, making Zazesspur the capital of the kingdom.<ref name=LoI1-T-p24 />\n\nAfter the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], the population of Zazesspur increased because of large numbers of refugees from the region around [[Castle Tethyr]]. The population and prestige of Zazesspur then began to decline with the establishment of [[Darromar]] as the new capital of the kingdom under Queen [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda]] and King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Haedrak]]. The citizens were not fond of their change in societal status in the country.",
