'''Manshaka''' was a city (a town by [[Calimshan|Calishite]] standards)<ref name=EotS-p56/><ref name=EotSS-p110/> in Calimshan, most well-known for its [[Arena of Blood|Blood Arenas]] and slavery. A home for gamblers and smugglers, such was its disrepute that more euphemistic aliases existed for this city than any other in Calimshan.<ref name=EotSS-p110/> It was the second-largest gambling center in all [[Faerûn]], next to [[Calimport]].<ref name=EotSS-p111/>

==Geography and Layout==
Manshaka was located on the coast south of Calimshan's central plain,<ref name=EotS-p56/> on a north–south stretch of shore of the [[Shining Sea]].<ref name=EotSS-p111/>

The city contained eight [[sabban]]s composed of a total of 36 [[drudach]]s. It was split into two halves by [[Drudach Street]], which led from the city's only gate to the coast.<ref name=EotSS-p111/><gallery>

</gallery>

===Appearance===
The [[wikipedia:Minaret|minarets]] of Manshaka were fully glazed and made from red bricks. Local legends claimed that these Red Minarets of Manshaka were once white but had been stained red by the blood of slaves who died there.<ref name=EotSS-p111/>

===Defenses===
The Red Minarets had archers stationed on them, who would often "shoot first and ask questions later" regarding any disturbances in the city below. The external city walls were encrusted with metal and stone shards, making attempts to climb into or out of the city a dangerous task and giving the walls a sparkling effect. The walls also contained a dedicated garrison of soldiers.<ref name=EotSS-p111/>

The [[Pasha's Palace (Manshaka)|Pasha's Palace]] occupied the entire northern drudach of the northeastern sabban. It was more heavily fortified than even the [[syl-pasha]]'s palace in [[Calimport]]&mdash;both structurally and magically.<ref name=EotSS-p111/>

==Government==
For over 50 years, the city was ruled by [[Pasha]] [[Abon Duum]], a ruthless despot<ref name=EotSS-p110/> and crime lord.{{Cite comic/The Last Betrayal|25}} This was the [[Ninth Age of Calimshan]], a time when Calimshan was a collection of city states more than a unified nation, and so Pasha Duum had ultimate control.<ref name=EotSS-pp34-35> When he vanished suddenly in [[1357 DR]],<ref name=EotSS-p110/> power nominally rested for a time in [[Alzhedo dictionary#V|Vizar]] [[Artouk Fanzir]], a businessman and moneylender, who headed a council of twelve prominent citizens, comprising eight other rich businessmen, two formidable [[magic-user]]s, and a sage. Decisions on important matters were made collectively by the council and Fanzir passed on the results.<ref name=EotS-p56/> This group mostly only looked out for their own interests and only occasionally for the city's. Their main focus was in maintaining the very profitable Arenas of Blood; they openly encouraged betting on the fights, as these were a primary source of tax revenue.

In less than a year, [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]], an advisor to a [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|sultan]] under Pasha Duum, had all of the twelve counselors assassinated and rose to power as Sultan of Manshaka.<ref name=EotSS-pp36-37>

During the [[Darkstalker Wars]] of the next year, Sultan Pesarkhal abandoned Manshaka for Calimport, to become ruler of the entire unified county of Calimshan and beginning its [[Tenth Age of Calimshan|Tenth Age]] as syl-pasha.<ref name=EotSS-pp36-37/> He intentionally left no one on the throne, so that he could control the city from Calimport by means of his agents.<ref name=EotSS-p110/>

===Law Enforcement===
In [[1370 DR]], the city maintained a defensive force of about 700 [[amlakkar]] and an additional 200 [[sadimmin]] tasked with guarding the two [[Arena of Blood|Arenas of Blood]].<ref name=EotSS-p111/> Owning to its position as a port city, it was a rough place. There was very little law in Manshaka,<ref name=EotSS-p110/> its legal codes were lax, and the guards were little better than slavers or robbers themselves.<ref name=EotSS-p111/> They were very open to bribery. Offending the wrong person might get someone executed on the spot or thrown into the Arenas as a slave.<ref name=EotSS-p110/>

==Trade==
[[File:Manshaka - pleasure house.jpg|thumb|left|A pleasure palace in Manshaka.]]
Manshaka was a market center for cattle and other kinds of livestock from the ranges of Calimshan, as many in the south found it easier to drive their stock there than to [[Keltar]]. While the town of Keltar was better known for its livestock business, in actuality, a greater ''variety'' of livestock passed through Manshaka's gates. In addition to common [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]], and [[cattle]], Manshaka also dealt in [[buffalo]], [[camel]]s, [[deer]], and even [[elephant]]s. These were shipped lived on cargo vessels to other cities along the coast.<ref name=EotS-p56/>

Manshaka was an especially busy port in 1357 DR, a common stopping point for sea traders traveling from [[Memnon]] to [[Suldolphor]] and [[Teshburl]]. Surprisingly, they stopped there, not for the livestock (though they did take on meat), but primarily because the city was known as a moneylending center. This in turn attracted merchants requiring capital for a venture, traders needing to make repairs, and adventurers looking for a backer for an expedition. Anyone could be found to fund anything in Manshaka, but rates naturally varied according to risk and trust in the borrower and their skills, ranging from a modest 10% or 15% a year to a massive 100% a month for the riskiest ventures.<ref name=EotS-p56/>

Most of the [[humanoid]] slaves (although not [[human]]s or [[demihuman]]s) coming into Manshaka to fight in the Blood Arenas were imported from the city of [[Almraiven]].<ref name=EotSS-p186>

==History==
===Early History===
This city, like many in Calimshan, was ancient, being founded in {{Yearlink|-5980}} as part of the empire of [[Coramshan]].<ref name=EotSS-p14/>

The population of the city was nearly annihilated in {{Yearlink|-943}} because of a mysterious and magical plague, known as the [[Cats' Plague]], which slew nine out of ten people.<ref name=EotSS-p41>

[[Drow]] invaded the city in the [[-697 DR|Year of the Triton's Horn, &minus;697 DR]] and maintained an influence there for decades.<ref name=Calimport-p16><ref name=GHotR-p41>

In the [[Fifth Age of Calimshan]], at the end of the [[Throne Wars]], [[Tasyn el Tarshaj]] from Manshaka rose to power over all of Calimshan.<ref name=EotSS-p42>

After the fall of the [[Shoon Imperium]] in [[450 DR]], Calimshan entered its [[Seventh Age of Calimshan|Seventh Age]]. Taking advantage of the time of unrest, the [[mameluks]], warrior slaves, rose to power, and from [[533 DR]] to [[1018 DR]], Manshaka was the new capital of Calimshan. The mameluks abolished slavery and ruled from their palace, the [[Hall of the Mameluks]].<ref name=EotSS-pp33,44>

===Modern History===
After a [[Rage of Dragons|rage of dragons]] ended mameluk rule, the individual cities of Calimshan, including Manshaka, were ruled as separate city states for centuries. In such a time, it was easy for rich and powerful men such as Pasha Abon Duum to wield control by managing information and a system of favors.<ref name=EotSS-pp34-35/> He would rule for over fifty years<ref name=EotSS-p110/> a ruthless tyrant<ref name=EotSS-p110/> and crime lord.

[[File:Vajra - gladiator.jpg|thumb|right|A champion gladiator in the Blood Arena.]]
In the late 1340s DR, the con artist [[Conner]] and his girl accomplice [[Vajra Valmeyjar|Vaji]] came to Manshaka. Finding lax and corruptible law enforcement, they felt safe to attempt grander and more profitable cons than they had in other parts of Calimshan. Unfortunately, Conner approached Abon Duum{{Cite comic/Cat & Mouse}} When Conner's scheme at last went awry, he was forced to sell Vaji as a slave to Duum.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka|25}}{{Cite comic/Shackles of the Past |19-20}}{{Cite dragon/246/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Selûne's Smile|71}} The young Vajra Valmeyjar soon became the most accomplished of Duum's stable of gladiators at the Arena of Blood However, after a decade, Vajra escaped from the Arena to freedom, being one of only two slaves to ever successfully do so.

For a brief time of less than a year after his disappearance, Vizar Fanzir and his council of twelve controlled Manshaka from the Hall of Mameluks, but in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], Sultan Ralan el Pesarkhal orchestrated their deaths. He drugged their wine, and when they were drunk, an argument started. During this time, he arranged for a brazier to "accidentally" be knocked over. The tapestries caught fire, and the Hall of the Mameluks went up in flames, killing all of the counselors. Sultan el Pesarkhal then took the throne. He had greater ambitions than Manshaka, and within a year, he had taken control of Calimport as well and with it all of Calimshan.<ref name=EotSS-pp36-37/>

The city saw great destruction in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]] when the [[Drudach Fires]] raged through much of the city, slaughtering nearly half of its population<ref name=EotSS-p110/> and burning many of its notable buildings to the ground.<ref name=EotSS-p112>

The largest gladiatorial event in Manshaka's history occurred in the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. Known as the [[Great Games]], the event saw the deaths of over 3,000 gladiators and 5,000 wild animals and monsters. It also saw the escape of a pack of [[Dire wolf|dire wolves]] into the crowds of onlookers, when an unidentified spellcaster used magic to dissolve a portion of the walls.<ref name=EotSS-p45>

==Rumors and Legends==
The disappearance of Abon Duum remained an issue of rumor for many years. Some claimed he was murdered by [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], an adventuress and former slave of his. Others believed that something happened when he sought to attain the power of the gods, such that his soul was lost in the [[plane]]s.<ref name=EotSS-p110/>

==Notable Locations==
[[File:Manshaka - Pasha's Palace.jpg|thumb|right|The Pasha's Palace at dusk.]]
; The Arenas of Blood : The source of Manshaka's fame, the [[Arenas of Blood]] were two identical structures located on opposite sides of the city, one on the north of Drudach Street and the other on the south side. As of 1370 DR, they held five shows a day each.<ref name=EotSS-p111/>
; Drudach Street : This road cut the city in half and ran from the gate to the port on the Shining Sea.<ref name=EotSS-p111/>
; The Hall of the Mameluks : This was the palace from which the mameluks ruled all of Calimshan during the Seventh Age.<ref name=EotSS-pp33,44/><ref name=EotSS-pp36-37/>
; The Pasha's Palace : This massive fortress was the size of a drudach and contained a vault of Ralan el Pesarkhal's treasure buried a mile below the surface. It was loaded with magical traps, and el Pesarkhal still had agents lurking there.<ref name=EotSS-p111/>
; The Red Minarets of Manshaka : These blood-colored minarets stood out for their red bricks and were symbolic of the state of oppression felt by the many slaves.<ref name=EotSS-p111/>

==Inhabitants==
Few mages lived in Manshaka relative to the rest of Calimshan; the majority who lived there frowned on the use of magic.<ref name=EotSS-p110/>

As elsewhere in Calimshan, many nobles in the city would retire to estates in the southern foothills of the [[Marching Mountains]] during the hot summer months, particularly in the vicinity of the headwaters of the [[River of Ice]].{{Cite dungeon/34/On Wings of Darkness|54}}

Crime in the city was largely under the control of [[el Kahmir]] family.<ref name=EotSS-p112/> Their headquarters was located in the city.<ref name=EotSS-p72>

In 1370 DR, notable persons who called Manshaka home included:<ref name=EotSS-p112/>
* Vizar [[Mohad el Fisar]], the "slave-lord" of Manshaka.
* [[Jhalarn]], one of only two escaped slaves of the Blood Arenas in the history of the city, (the other being Vajra Valmeyjar).
* Pasha [[Jhiavor|Jhiavor the Ripper]], the syl-pasha's main agent.
* [[Khamas el Kahmir|Khamas yn Nur el Kahmir]], leader of the Manshakan thieves guild.
* Pasha [[Ladan el Viscek]], puppet leader of slaving operations for Vizar el Fisar.
