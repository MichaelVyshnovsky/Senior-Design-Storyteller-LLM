'''Oyaviggaton''' (meaning "Island of Eternity" in [[Uluik]]) was a large iceberg that traveled the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] and was never in the same place twice. It was the home and lair of the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]].

==Geography==
The iceberg was characterized by several high peaks, well over 200 ft (61 m) tall. The middle of Oyaviggaton formed a plateau, where hundreds of native [[Ice Hunters]] lived.
