The '''Grey Forest''', also spelled the '''Gray Forest''' and also called the '''Tsurlar Forest''', was a [[forest]] located between [[the Vast]] and the nation of [[Impiltur]], lying south of the [[Earthfast Mountains]].

==History==
[[Moon elf|Moon elves]] once lived in the Gray Forest several centuries before the 14th century [[DR]]. However, when [[hobgoblin]]s and various other creatures began to encroach on their lands, the elves fought a losing war against them. They increasingly lost ground and some were driven out, but the rest were unwilling to give up their homes. The Gray Forest moon elves faced extinction. Thus, their last act was to transform themselves into grand gray-barked trees, so that they would never leave.

However, a population of [[wood elf|wood elves]] remained in the Grey Forest. In the [[1095 DR|Year of the Dawndance, 1095 DR]], they joined an alliance with the cities of Impiltur and the [[shield dwarf|dwarves]] of the Earthfast Mountains. Led by War-Captain [[Imphras Heltharn]], this alliance fought to repel the hobgoblin hordes of the [[Giantspire Mountains]].{{cite book/Dreams of the Red Wizards|6}}

By [[1372 DR]], a new leader had risen to organize the hobgoblins of the Gray Forest. Some claimed he was a [[werewolf]], others a [[vampire]], and he was said to command [[dire wolves]] that aided his tribe in battle. 

A [[Cult of the Dragon]] base was operating in the Grey Forest. On [[Tarsakh 1]], the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], Maestro [[Taegan Nightwind]], an [[avariel]], informed [[Impiltur]]'s [[Grand Council|Council of Lords]] and Regent-Queen [[Sambryl]] of the existence of this base and of a cell in the nearby city of [[Lyrabar]]. An Impilturan army marched into the Grey Forest after it, but on [[Tarsakh 12]] it was routed when its own [[dragon]] allies were affected by the [[Rage of Dragons]]. However, the army rallied and with the aid of [[Vorasaegha]], a [[spirit dragon]], they attacked and destroyed the Cult lair on [[Tarsakh 16]].

==Locations==
In amongst the ordinary trees of the Gray Forest could be found circles of the grand, gray-barked trees with dark leaves that the moon elves had turned themselves into.

[[Alithyn's Copse]] was a grove of [[weirwood]] trees of great age and grandeur.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|59}}

Small shrines dedicated to [[Eilistraee]] could be found in the Grey Forest.

==Inhabitants==
The Grey Forest once had two [[elf|elven]] populations. The moon elves were either driven out or transformed themselves into trees centuries ago, leaving the wood elves.

Hobgoblins also dwelled in the Gray Forest. In addition to their forest homes, they also kept lairs in the Earthfast Mountains.

A small [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] cell was active in the Gray Forest. They oscillated between assaulting the hobgoblins and alerting them to [[human]]s trespassing in hobgoblin territory.

The Cult of the Dragon had a hideout in the Grey Forest, which was destroyed by the Impilturan army in Tarskah, 1373 DR.

==Legends==
The [[sage]] [[Othla Multar]] theorized that [[drow]] occasionally emerged from a passage to the local [[Underdark]] in the neighboring [[Adhe Wood]] and crossed into the Tsurlar Forest. There they traded with [[pirate]] vessels that anchored in hidden coves.

Around [[1371 DR]], rumors of [[werewolves]] in the Gray Forest drew monster slayers and trophy hunters to Impiltur in search of exotic wolf pelts. However, one band couldn't find anyone to guide them, and so they idled in [[Hlammach]].

By [[1479 DR]], elderly folk living outside the forest told a tale that there was once a great war between the elves (or "[[eladrin]]") and [[goblinoid]]s of the Gray Forest, that wiped out both peoples. Only the circles of gray-barked trees remained to mark their presence. In this time, the Gray Forest was said to be haunted, and few people risked journeying inside it too long or too deeply. Those who did told stories of [[ghost]]s, strange creatures, and peculiar hills that mysteriously appeared and vanished again.
