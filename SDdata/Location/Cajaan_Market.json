        "Description": "By both day and night, the marketplace was full of bazaar carts and stands with merchants hawking their wares. The ''[[sabbalad]]'', [[Pasha]] [[Nur el Wariq]], charged high fees for use of the selling space.",
        "Location": "The market took up the majority of [[Cajaan Sabban]] in [[Grand Ward]] and covered three separate ''[[drudach]]s'': [[Dabun Drudach|Dabun]], [[Semalej Drudach|Samelej]], and [[Mit'adh Drudach|Mit'adh]].",
        "History": "The site was once the home of '''Cajaan Bazaar''', which included four shining white-marble ''[[khanduq]]s'' built during the [[Third Age of Calimshan]] when the [[Cajaan Dynasty]] ruled. The vast sums of [[gold]] stored in the ''khanduqs'' melted and poured down into the [[Muzad]] to be collected by the undercity's citizens of dubious reputation."
