        "mainbody": "tui was a village in the Angalpuk region within the Great Glacier.\nUtui was located in eastern Angalpuk. The village was surrounded by forests of pine trees and hilly countryside.\nThe village was spread out, with each family living within a separate minikitak at least  from each other.\nUtui had a communal herd of 1,500 caribou. The communal caribou herd was the only thing the families of Utui collaborated on, otherwise they did not associate with each other and fierce rivalries were common between two separate families. tupa was common, with the bride moving into the grooms minikitak, but the brides family mourned for several weeks as if they lost a loved one. \nWhile rivalries existed, violence between families was rare. The rivalries between families manifested as a competition of sorts, each family attempting to craft the finest item. As a result, the village created some of the finest trade good in the Great Glacier. Clothing, jakerek, rissik and weapons from Utui were highly sought after.\nMerchants visiting the village could get a lower price for goods by with flattery, complimenting the families craftsmanship. However, the other families in the village would become offended and ignore the visiting merchant for the duration of their stay."
