'''Felmer's Keep''' was a small island located within the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[South Faerûn]].<ref name=EotSS-p141"><ref name=EotSS.M">{{Cite interactive atlas|B1cSElc}}

==Location==
The island lay in the southwest section of the [[Lake of Steam]] northeast from the city of [[Yeshpek]].<ref name=EotSS-p141"/><ref name=EotSS.M"/>

==Description==
Felmer's Keep appeared to be a man-made fortress when viewed from the waters of the Lake of Steam or shoreline, but the "keep" was actually a series of naturally occurring sheer cliffaces from a dormant volcano. The volcano's caldera was a lush garden tended by [[priest]]s of [[Chauntea]].<ref name=EotSS-p141"/>

==Inhabitants==
Various seabird species nested within the high cliffs of the island. [[Verrick]] and [[giant lynx]]s lived on the island as well.<ref name=EotSS-p141"/>

==History==
Felmer's Keep was named for an [[adventurer]] from ages past who fled to the island and perished there. Some believed his ghost still haunted the island. Others believed he was welcomed by the fauna living on the island and became a priest of Chauntea.<ref name=EotSS-p141"/>
