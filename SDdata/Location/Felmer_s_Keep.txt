Felmers Keep was a small island located within the Land of the Lions region of South Faer√ªn.
The island lay in the southwest section of the Lake of Steam northeast from the city of Yeshpek.
Felmers Keep appeared to be a man-made fortress when viewed from the waters of the Lake of Steam or shoreline, but the "keep" was actually a series of naturally occurring sheer cliffaces from a dormant volcano. The volcanos caldera was a lush garden tended by priests of Chauntea.
Various seabird species nested within the high cliffs of the island. Verrick and giant lynxs lived on the island as well.
Felmers Keep was named for an adventurer from ages past who fled to the island and perished there. Some believed his ghost still haunted the island. Others believed he was welcomed by the fauna living on the island and became a priest of Chauntea.
