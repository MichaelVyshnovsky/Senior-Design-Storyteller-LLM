Nevertheless, Chult was also a land of great riches that never failed to draw [[adventurer]]s.\n\n{{Quote|The jungle never stops talking. It is an endless stream of buzzing, whistling, clicking, hoots and yelps, along with an array of earthy and pungent smells in a wash of verdant colors, all conveying information to those who can interpret the jumbled code...Arrayed in such mysterious splendor is the jungle of Chult, a place of secrets waiting to be discovered. There are expert guides who have studied it their entire lives, and they are still surprised by what it reveals to them.|[[Jessamine]], [[Merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] of [[Port Nyanzaru]]{{Cite dragon+/15/Fiction: Qawasha & Kupalué}}}}",
        "Life and Society": "The humans of Chult lived in tribal communities, consisting of a dozen or so families, which moved from one area to the next when the poor soil of the largely jungle covered peninsula becomes depleted. For hunting and defense they relied on non-metallic weapons like [[club]]s, [[bow]]s and [[shortspear]]s. Harder metals like [[iron]] and steel were unavailable to them, and the few brought in by outsiders were nowhere near enough to sufficiently arm any significant number of people.\n\nThe people revered the [[god]] [[Ubtao]] almost exclusively. The [[deity|divine]] powers of [[Faerûn]] had awarded Chult to Ubtao as his sole dominion in exchange for the deity's vigilance over the threat of [[Dendar the Night Serpent]], who lay imprisoned under the [[Peaks of Flame]].\n\n[[Magic]] was generally feared, and each tribal-family generally had only one wielder of [[arcane magic]], who performed hunting ceremonies and brewed potions to aid the hunters. Despite this restriction on [[arcane spellcaster]]s, the number of people with an aptitude for magic was the same as anywhere else in Faerûn. Subsequently, the Chultan attitude towards the arcane caused some arcanists to flee into the jungle to practice their art alone. Many also traveled to study in [[Mezro]].\n\nAside from humans, [[wild dwarf|wild dwarves]], [[goblin]]s, [[aldani]], [[pterafolk]], [[bullywug]]s, and [[lizardfolk]] also inhabited the land. Exotic creatures as [[chuul]]s, [[hydra]]s, [[naga]]s, [[troglodyte]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[wyvern]]s existed in smaller numbers. The dominant predators of the land were the dinosaurs, who were worshiped by many of the natives as aspects of Ubtao.\n\n\"[[Slime]]s\" were a present danger for travelers in Chult, namely [[zygoms]], [[green slime]]s and [[yellow mold]]s. The jungles were also home to other carnivorous vegetations, such as [[Chultan Throttler]].\n\nChult was the prime destination for people who liked to hunt or collect monster skulls. These safari hunters paid good [[coin]] for exotic creatures to claim as trophies without actually having to risk their own lives.\n\nChult was famous for its [[disease]]s, whether fatal and merely debilitating.), jungle mists (such as [[blue mist fever]]{{Cite web/Tomb of Annihilation Errata}}), and [[parasite]]s (such as [[brain fluke]]sor [[throat leech]]es).",
        "Geography": {
            "The Jungle": "[[File:Jungles-of-chult.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The jungles of Chult.'']]\nIt was said by many that the jungles of Chult were the most dangerous places in Faerûn. The plants were intelligent predators while the predators themselves were massive and armed with huge teeth and claws. Insects bit and stung travelers almost constantly, the heat and humidity were almost unbearable and the undergrowth contained a multitude of poisonous snakes. Worst, however, was the disease that ran rampant in the area. Most things in the jungle had some sort of illness or parasite and it was very easy to catch such illnesses off them. Even the water was tainted and had to be boiled if it was to be drunk. On top of all this, the intelligent creatures that eked out an existence in the dense foliage were perfectly happy and sometimes went out of their way, to track travelers in order to hunt them down and kill them. [[Yuan-ti]], [[batiri]], and other species that have learned to survive in this place needed food; adventurers would tend to suit that need nicely.\n\n[[File:Mike-daarken-lim-314016-the-jungle-of-chult.jpg|thumb|228x228px|''One of the many dangers of Chult was the [[undead]] that infested it.'']]\nYet those adventurers kept on coming in their droves to the Chultan jungles as rumors of endless veins of [[gold]], huge [[gem]]s and ruined empires stuffed to the brim with magic and riches kept surfacing in taverns across [[Faerûn]] and many were willing to brave the dangers of the jungle for a slice of that fabled wealth.\n\nThe Chultan jungles were home to a number of [[tree]]s which were valued for [[timber]] and other uses. [[rubber tree|rubber]],",
            "Peaks of Flame": "The [[Peaks of Flame]] were the abode of [[salamander]]s and other creatures of fire. The peaks were also said to sit over a pair of iron doors that led to the [[Fugue Plane]], the world of the dead. Legend had it that at the end of the world [[Dendar|Dendar the Night Serpent]] would tear down these doors and break through into the world.",
            "Rivers": "Chult was dominated by four major rivers: the [[River Soshenstar]] and [[River Tiryki]] emptying into the [[Bay of Chult]] in the north, the [[River Olung]] emptying into [[Kitcher's Inlet]] on the [[Shining Sea]] in the east, and the [[River Tath]] emptying into [[Jahaka Bay]] to the south. These rivers could flow so slowly that it was sometimes hard to discern the direction of the current, although they picked up speed wherever they thundered through narrow gorges. The river water was not generally safe to drink unless it was boiled or otherwise purified first, largely because of the risk of throat leeches. These rivers also were home to [[Chultan fan shrimp]], [[giant crab|giant]] and [[purple marsh crab]], [[irrinda]], [[kapenta]], [[likoto]], [[minjiriya]], [[mkunga]] [[eel]]s, [[Esmel perch]], [[giant puffer|giant]] and [[striped puffer]]fish, [[quipper]], [[red discus]], [[Soshenstar barb]],  [[tigershell nerite]], and [[giant tigerfish]].",
            "Valley of Lost Honor": "In the thickest parts of the jungle lay the [[Valley of Lost Honor]], once the last refuge of the [[Eshowe]] before they were destroyed. Legends said that all of their wealth was left behind in caves in the valley, while more sinister legends claimed the evil deity of ''Eshowdow'', actually [[Shar]] in disguise, resided there, recruiting followers and planning revenge.",
            "Wild Coast": "The jagged and treacherous coast of southwestern Chult created a hazard for ships, and merchants from northern Faerûn have learned to give it wide berth. Fearing not only the cliffs, sailors spoke of whirlpools, freak storms, aquatic monsters, flying [[dinosaur]]s and [[giant eagle]]s. A few brave (or foolish) sought fortune to explore the caves along the coast, hoping they would lead into rich mines under the jungle.\n\nThe southern Chultan coast extended east until the [[Snout of Omgar]], a mountainous island that marked the boundary between Chult and the coast of [[Samarach]]. The Snout was the domain of the [[tortle]] race."
        },
        "Important Sites": "[[File:Chultan jungle bg3.jpg|thumb|''Deep within the jungles of Chult.'']]\n* [[Fort Beluarian]]: A small outpost that belonged to the [[Flaming Fist]]s, a mercenary company based in [[Baldur's Gate]]. The troops would work with adventurers to promote the cause of good, and provide shelter to adventurers in dire need. In spite of this goodwill, the city had, over the [[Hundred Years of Chaos]], been burnt to the ground twice by local inhabitants of Chult only to be rebuilt by the Baldurians. The colony was also in competition with the much larger [[Port Nyanzaru]].\n\n* Mezro: Mezro was the largest civilized area in Chult and a holy city to the Chultan tribes. The city was generally peaceful and few people, except for outsider-adventurers, carried weapons. The city was protected by the undying baras of Ubtao and six [[paladin]]-like [[Chosen#Chosen of Ubtao|chosen]] who ruled the city. Until [[1363 DR]], the city was surrounded by a magical wall, preventing it from being seen and causing ''confusion'' in those who approached too closely, but after a victorious battle against the batiri goblins this protection was lowered. After this it was a safe haven for explorers battered by the harsh jungle until the Spellplague, at which point it collapsed into the earth.\n\n* [[Port Nyanzaru]]: A harbor port settled by [[Amn]]ians, Port Nyanzaru was also a mighty fortress, built to withstand pirate attacks and the threats of the jungle itself. Controlled by [[Amn]], Nyanzaru was a booming, densely populated community that brought in much wealth for its parent state.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], tourism business was established in Chult. The citizens of [[Baldur's Gate]] who visited the jungle region claimed that it was \"too humid and dangerous.\"",
        "Rumors and Legends": "One of the most terrifying local legends of Chult involved a mysterious beast called the [[Uluu Thalongh]]. This entity was able to possess trees and plants, making their branches into violent weapons. Moreover, it could mimic the voices of previous victims. No one was ever able to discover who or what the creature actually was.\n\nIn the upper canopy of the jungles, [[black dragon]]s were rumored to roost.\n\nWhen [[Jarlaxle]] visited [[Callidae]] in the far north of the world, the [[aevendrow]] [[Vessi]] thought Jarlaxle had come from Chult, thereby hinting at the existence of a surface drow city&mdash;belonging to the [[lorendrow]]{{Cite web/Legend of Drizzt}}&mdash;in the southern jungles."
