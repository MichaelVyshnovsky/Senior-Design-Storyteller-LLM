'''Jarlmoot''' was a landmark in [[Icewind Dale]], serving as the former seat of power for the [[frost giant]] [[jarl]]s in the region.

==Description==
The site comprised seven giant-sized stone thrones, arranged in a circle facing one another. There was one throne for each of the frost giant's jarls, one of which was claimed by Jarl of Jarls, [[Reggaryarva]].

Hidden beneath Reggaryarva's throne was an underground hallway that featured six [[brazier]]s inscribed with [[Jotun]] runes. By lighting each of the runes with its required ingredient, a person could gain access to a grand chest holding the ''[[horn of blasting|giant's treasure]]''.

The six Jotun runes were ''[[Death (rune)|dod]]'', ''[[Mountain (rune)|fjell]]'', ''[[War (rune)|krig]]'', ''[[Life (rune)|liv]]'', ''[[Wind (rune)|vind]]'', and ''[[wyrm (rune)|wyrm]]''.

A poem inscribed upon the wall offered clues on how to correctly lite each of the braziers.

==Geography==
Jarlmoot was located atop a hill, some ways west of the [[Shaengarne River]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the frost giant [[Gromin'gorn]] traveled to Jarlmoot in order to face the frost giant specters and claim its hidden treasure.

==Inhabitants==
On nights of a [[Selûne (moon)|full moon]], the [[ghost]]s of the jarls appeared at their thrones, sharing tales about the feats and exploits they accomplished in life.

That same year, the [[frost druid]] [[Yselm Bloodfang]] sought to lure a group of [[adventurer]]s to the ancient site, in the hopes of killing them in the name of [[Auril]].
