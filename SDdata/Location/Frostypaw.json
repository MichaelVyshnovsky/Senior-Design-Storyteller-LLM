        "mainbody": "'''Frostypaw''' was a [[Rengarth]] city during the time of ancient [[Netheril]].",
        "Geography": "The city was built on the coast of the western [[Narrow Sea]].",
        "Trade": "The Rengarth folk hunted the beasts of the tundra around Frostypaws and traded furs, clothes, and other products derived from them.",
        "History": "Founded in {{yearlinkConvert|315|NY}}, Frostypaw was the main port city of the Rengarth [[barbarian]]s. Situated far from other settlements on the cold plains, it could only be reached via ship, sled [[dog]], or magical transportation until Netherese magical alterations in the Silver Age ({{yearlink|-2758}} to {{yearlink|-2208}}) made the harsh weather more amenable.\n\nAs the Netherese took to the sky in their [[enclave]]s during the Golden Age ({{yearlink|-2207}} to {{yearlink|-1206}}), the Rengarth's distrust of magic led to them focusing more on trade with the [[dwarves]] of [[Ascore]], and reacted to the approach of flying cities with [[arrow]]s and [[javelin]]s. Despite the hostility, the Age of Discovery ({{yearlink|-1205}} to {{yearlink|-697}}) saw an influx of trade with Netheril when [[pearl]]s and other valuable goods were found in the water a few miles off shore. While the flying enclaves were still driven away, those Netherese who didn't flaunt their magic were allowed in.\n\nThe barbarians suffered a schism in {{yearlinkConvert|2477|NY}} when the local [[Angardt]]s befriended a Netherese [[arcanist]] and began learning arcane magic. While the Angardts were happy to learn magic that could be used against marauding [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s, their cousins could not countenance the idea and violently expelled the Angardts from their lands over the next seven years.\n\nTowards the end of Netheril, the [[phaerimm]]'s magical attacks led to the weather around Frostypaw returning to its naturally inhospitable state, and most of the Netherese left for warmer climes. Near the time of [[Karsus's Folly]], as the [[High Ice]] expanded south and the Narrow Sea dried up, the Rengarth abandoned Frostypaw completely as they migrated west into the [[Savage North]]."
