        "mainbody": "The Nunwood was a forest on the mouth of the Vilhon Reach.\nThe nearby cities of Reth and Hlath used the Nunwood  as their main source of lumber. In 1372 DR, Hlaths main export was Nunwood lumber.\nFor a while around 1370 DR, Reth stopped cutting down trees from the Nunwood because of a conflict with the Emerald Enclave. When the lumberjacks eventually returned to the Nunwood, they were confronted by creatures using hit-and-run tactics during the night.\nSnakes that spat a blinding venom were common in the Nunwood. As of 1357 DR a tribe of hybsils called the Autunuk were also known to live in the Nunwood."
