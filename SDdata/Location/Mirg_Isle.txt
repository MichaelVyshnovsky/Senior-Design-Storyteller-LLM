'''Mirg Isle'''<ref group="note">Page 50 of "Pirates of the Fallen Stars" refers to this location as Ming Isle, but this is believed to be a typo. was an island and a pirate stronghold in the [[Pirate Isles]]. It had two ports.

==History==
The island was originally under the control of [[Xenz]], a pirate allied with [[Zhentil Keep]], but [[Vurgrom|Vurgrom the Mighty]] seized power by defeating Xenz in combat. A whirlpool sank twenty-five of Vurgrom's ships and significantly lowered the power he exerted on the island. Vurgrom's alliance with [[Iakhovas]] caused his power to be diminished to the point where he lost control of the island. Some of Mirg Isle's inhabitants speculated that the true ruler was once again Xenz.
