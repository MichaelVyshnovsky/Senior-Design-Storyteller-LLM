Mirg IslePage 50 of "Pirates of the Fallen Stars" refers to this location as Ming Isle, but this is believed to be a typo. was an island and a pirate stronghold in the Pirate Isles. It had two ports.
The island was originally under the control of Xenz, a pirate allied with Zhentil Keep, but Vurgrom the Mighty seized power by defeating Xenz in combat. A whirlpool sank twenty-five of Vurgroms ships and significantly lowered the power he exerted on the island. Vurgroms alliance with Iakhovas caused his power to be diminished to the point where he lost control of the island. Some of Mirg Isles inhabitants speculated that the true ruler was once again Xenz.
