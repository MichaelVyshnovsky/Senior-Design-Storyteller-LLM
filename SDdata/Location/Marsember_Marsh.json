        "mainbody": "The Marsember Marsh was an area of marshland that stretched along the northern shore of the Dragonmere for several miles, occupying the mouth of the Starwater River. It was inhabited by lizardfolk, but when a war broke out, most were slain, and the area was taken over by will-o-wisps and other creatures. It eventually became the site of the city of Marsember in Cormyr."
