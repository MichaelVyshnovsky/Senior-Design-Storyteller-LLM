Ruhh Island was located on Suq Bay near Hayyir.
Given its position along the well-traveled Dihl al-Suq, Ruhh Island was a haven for pirates hoping to prey upon the richly-laden merchant vessels using the shipping lane.
Ruhh Island held secret pirate bases frequented by the Shark of Suq Bay and the Reaver.
