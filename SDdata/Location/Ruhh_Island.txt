'''Ruhh Island''' was located on [[Suq Bay]] near [[Hayyir]].

==Geography==
Given its position along the well-traveled [[Dihl al-Suq]], Ruhh Island was a haven for pirates hoping to prey upon the richly-laden merchant vessels using the shipping lane.

==Inhabitants==
Ruhh Island held secret pirate bases frequented by the [[Almari bint-Kafira|Shark of Suq Bay]] and the ''[[Reaver (ship)|Reaver]]''.
