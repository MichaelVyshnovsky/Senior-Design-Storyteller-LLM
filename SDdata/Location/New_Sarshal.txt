New Sarshal was a small fishing village in Theskin the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
New Sarshal was a coastal village that stood on the eastern shores of the Easting Reach, bordering the Forest of Lethyrs western edge, near where Lethyrstream emptied into the Inner Sea. North New Sarshal were the settlements of the Great Dale the city of Uthmere and the town of Lethgate, and to the south – the towns of Nyth and Ethdale. A minor road that connected the cities of Uthmere and Telflamm passed New Sarshal.
New Sarshals main industry was fishing, but the village was prosperous thanks to the Lethyrstream, or the "secret local source of wealth," named so for abundant and very pure gold in its waters. Manly villagers filtered water to gather gold flakes to be melted. In the late 15 century DR, Maerloth Hrimmon, once a worker of a Chessentan mint, bought river gold from the villages and smelted them into Prathandan coins using coin molds he brought from Luthcheq. A new careful industry was also born in the late 15 century – small-scale logging in the Forest of Lethyr. The wood was used to craft sturdy but quite mundane furniture by the Sandron family of New Sarshal.
