'''New Sarshal''' was a small [[fish]]ing village in [[Thesk]]in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].<ref name="atlas />

==Geography==
New Sarshal was a coastal village that stood on the eastern shores of the [[Easting Reach]], bordering the [[Forest of Lethyr]]'s western edge, near where [[Lethyrstream]] emptied into the [[Inner Sea]]. North New Sarshal were the settlements of the [[Great Dale]]: the city of [[Uthmere]] and the town of [[Lethgate]], and to the south – the towns of [[Nyth]] and [[Ethdale]]. A minor road that connected the cities of Uthmere and [[Telflamm]] passed New Sarshal.

==Trade==
New Sarshal's main industry was fishing, but the village was prosperous thanks to the Lethyrstream, or the "secret local source of wealth," named so for abundant and very pure [[gold]] in its waters. Manly villagers filtered water to gather gold flakes to be melted. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Maerloth Hrimmon]], once a worker of a [[Chessenta]]n mint, bought river gold from the villages and smelted them into [[Prathandan coin]]s using coin molds he brought from [[Luthcheq]]. A new careful industry was also born in the late 15{{th}} century – small-scale logging in the Forest of Lethyr. The wood was used to craft sturdy but quite mundane furniture by the [[Sandron]] family of New Sarshal.
