        "mainbody": "The Pirate Isles were a collection of rocky islands that dotted the Sea of Fallen Stars and were inhabited by pirates. There were fifteen named islands but around sixty in total. The islands that comprised Prespur were not included in the Pirate Isles, despite their proximity.\nThe general makeup of the islands was mountainous terrain with high rocky cliffs. This meant that there were not a lot of ports in the Pirate Isles.\nAs of 1479 DR, due to the continued shrinking of the Sea of Fallen Stars in the century after the Spellplague, most of the Pirate Isles had become a single large island named Pirate Isle.\nthumb|A hand-drawn map of the Pirate Isles.|380x380px\nDragonisle\n Dragonisle was the largest isle. The huge Earthspur was located here. The main harbor was the settlement of Immurks Hold.\nAlphar Isle\n Alphar was full of pirate holds, home to around 5,000 pirates. \nBulta\n All trees and animals were half their normal size on Bulta.\nFangrocks\n The Fangrocks were a cluster of natural reefs exposed only during low tide that covered a circle ten miles wide.\nHawks Isle\n Hawks Isle was a pleasant, fruit-filled island on which a plague had left its natives horribly deformed.\nIlthan\n Ilthan was another pirate hold, though the northern end of the island was full of cyclopskin shepherds.\nKelthann\n Kelthann was a common smugglers trading point.\nLith\n Lith had a dangerous reputation.

It was mostly ignored and the only structure here was a lighthouse. \nSumbar\n Sumbar was the location of the powerful and mysterious Sumbar Oracle.
