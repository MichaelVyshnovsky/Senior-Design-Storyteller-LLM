        "mainbody": "he Public Gardens of Huzuz, or the Fourth Court, was part of the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nA splendid variety of trees and flowers filled the gardens with color throughout the year.\nAmbassador Jiraad granted the gift of a wondrous fountain filled with golden water to the gardens. The fountain consisted of rotating floating crystal bowls. Special effects were created as water fell between the bowls. Soft music from the fountain paired well with the voices of the Singing Tree.\nThese beautiful gardens were open to the public save on occasions when the Grand Caliph wished to take a stroll. Enchanted pillars would politely ask visitors to leave. Ever since a nearly successful assassination attempt, a guard of jann inspected the gardens before allowing the Grand Caliph to enter.\nPriests of Selan tended the vegetation in the garden year-round.\nThe gardens were the home of the mystical Talking Bird and Singing Tree."
