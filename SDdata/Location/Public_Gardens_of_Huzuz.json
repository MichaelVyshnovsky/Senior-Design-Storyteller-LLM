        "Description": "A splendid variety of trees and flowers filled the gardens with color throughout the year.\n\nAmbassador [[Jiraad]] granted the gift of a wondrous fountain filled with [[golden water]] to the gardens. The fountain consisted of rotating floating crystal bowls. Special effects were created as water fell between the bowls. Soft music from the fountain paired well with the voices of the [[Singing Tree]].",
        "Activities": "These beautiful gardens were open to the public save on occasions when the [[Grand Caliph]] wished to take a stroll. Enchanted pillars would politely ask visitors to leave. Ever since a nearly successful assassination attempt, a guard of [[jann]] inspected the gardens before allowing the Grand Caliph to enter.",
        "Inhabitants": "Priests of [[Selan]] tended the vegetation in the garden year-round.\n\nThe gardens were the home of the mystical [[Talking Bird]] and Singing Tree."
