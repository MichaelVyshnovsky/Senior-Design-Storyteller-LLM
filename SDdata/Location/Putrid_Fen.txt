The Putrid Fen was one of the three swamps that composed the blighted landscape of the Feywild referred to as the dark fey enclave.
The Putrid Fen was located on the western stretch of the dark fey enclave, connected to the upper and lower banks of the once-beautiful river that ran through the region.
Along with the rest of the dark fey enclave, the landscape of the region was changed when Magra Curse-Eye took up residence nearby and set her coven of witches to work. The witches concoctions were distributed to the foul trolls of Malabogs army, who used them to foul the standing water that permeated the land.
The fomorian coven also introduced the noxious witchcap toadstools to the local ecosystem, further contributing to the wholly-earned "putrid" moniker of the fen.
The fen was home to the great number of troll soldiers that served the fomorian king Malabog.
