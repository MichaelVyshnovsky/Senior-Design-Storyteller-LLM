On rare occasions a westbound wind cleaned the dust from the air, bringing with it the reeks of [[tanner]]ies, paddocks and slaughterhouses.\n\nRain was a common occurrence in Crimmor, happening in short but severe downpours two to three times almost every morning. In addition mists caused by the river would cover the city every morning, until dispersed by the sun.\n\nDuring the 14{{th}} Century [[DR]], the lands east of the city were plagued with dust storms. A local [[druid circle]], the [[Flamenar]], tried to reduce this issue by planting new trees on the surrounding hills.\n\nDuring winter the region was covered by so much ice and snow that traveling with draft animals was impossible.

On the limit of the Keepclear near the [[Orc Road]], visitors could find the first trees: a majority of [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]]s, as well as some [[felsul]]s. Those trees were a favorite playground of local children, and marked the beginning of the area where visiting caravans would set up their encampments. Lovers and paramours used to meet near those trees, but this tradition declined over time as caravan-riders enjoyed playing pranks on such couples.\n\nOutside of the city gardens produced a variety of goods such as [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s.

The badges were issued by the Thaeldorn and served to prove that the animal belonged to a tax-paying citizen, as visitors were forbidden to bring their own beasts of burden inside the city.\n\nCrimmans kept few pets, as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s were banned from the city&mdash;except as caged cargoes. The locals hunted those pests using stones, [[poison]]s and drowning-traps whenever given a chance."

They wore [[chainmail]] under their [[tabard]]s and fought using [[sling]]s, [[longsword]]s and [[dagger]]s. Numerous patrols watched over the streets of the city, and were typically strong of a dozen guards.\n* Strong of 125 men and women, the '''Bargemen''' patrolled the [[Alandor River]], the westbound [[River Road (Amn)|River Road]], and the docks. They wore [[tabard]]s emblazoned with the city's symbol.\n* The '''[[Shadow Thieves]]''' regulated criminal activities in the city, and enforced a strict no-theft policy.\n* Although this was seldom necessary, the '''[[Crytrapper]] family''' could supplement the guard with 400 more troops from its estates around the city.\n\nIn addition, the authorities were known to hire [[mercenaries]] to increase the city defenses in case of necessity.",

Holding cells were built on the ground-floor of every tower alongside the city wall, and were used to incarcerate troublemakers awaiting their judgement.  A more secure dungeon was built under the Thaeldorn, and was used for prisoners sentenced to long-term imprisonment.\n\n[[File:Crimmor symbol.png|thumb|left|150px|''The [[wagon]]-on-barge, symbol of Crimmor.'']]",

It was stamped on the badges signaling animals belonging to tax-payers, and was displayed on the city guard's [[tabard]]s.\n* A more complex heraldry figured a thick horizontal blue line on a white background, on which three eight-spoked wagon wheels were centered&mdash;the central one overlapping the outer two. The blue bar represented the river, whereas the overlapping wheels represented caravan trade.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/Heraldry of Crimmor and Athkatla}}"

Merchants opened shops from ''mistclear'' to dusk, but could handle restocking and deliveries all night long.\n\nWhile items sold in shops had price tags, no laws required merchants to sell anything at the indicated price.\n\nCustomers who broke items were expected to pay for the damage, and purchases were usually wrapped by merchants unless asked otherwise.\n\nBy decree of the Mayor, it was forbidden for customers to outbid each other for swifter service. The practice was still active in some shop, but done in secret."

Many townsfolk would meet in those dining halls to eat their main meal of the day, gossip, socialize, and conduct sideline business. This was also the place where they would go in order to hire new employees such as shop staff, guards, or adventurers.\n\nIn addition, Crimmor contained a variety of taverns where people would meet to drink cider and ale. Compared to clubs, taverns were noisy places offering few things to eat. They usually only served small snacks such as pickled, smoked oysters and fried cheese breads.",
            "Inns and Boarding Houses": "Visitors looking to spend the night in the city had two options to choose from: renting a room in one of the three inns of the city, or in one of its numerous boarding houses.\n\nInns were the pricier option, but offered full meals, larger houses, and various services such as laundry and bathing. Boarding houses were cheaper, but usually offered no more than basic amenities: a clean bed and chamber pots, a water basin, and door guards.\n\nA night in [[The Pearl (inn)|the Pearl]], the most expensive inn of the city, cost between 10 and 12 [[gp]]. In comparison, a night in a boarding house cost between 6 [[sp]] and 1 [[gp]] depending of the season.\n\nDue to the constant cacophony of wagons roaming around Crimmor some visitors would prefer sleeping with the beasts in the paddocks outside the city, which were still quieter despite the lowing and neighing.",

The town also housed a shrine dedicated to many deities.\n\nDeceased in Crimmor were celebrated by day long remembrance feasts held in their homes. Wealthy people were inhumated in the crypts of [[Silent Hill]] south-west of the city, reachable by following the [[Orc road]]. The bodies of regular citizens were washed and shaved, then taken east of the city on dedicated wagons to be cremated by [[priest]]s&mdash;as for their hairs, they were sold for use in [[wig]]s and as stuffing.",
            "Prostitution": "While ladies of coin weren't proposing their services in the streets, the trade was still alive in the city. Hostesses of some clubs offered more than drinks, [[prostitute]]s looked for business in the [[Tymoran Trails]] inn, and a couple brothels masquerading as boarding houses offered room visits from \"house girls\" for an extra fee.\n\n[[File:Wheelmoot.png|thumb|left|400px|''Revelers during the Wheelmoot festival.'']]",
            "Festivals and Holidays": "[[Wheelmoot]] was the only festival specific to the city of Crimmor. Held during winter, it was four consecutive days and nights of drinking and public debauchery.",
            "Waste Management": "Dedicated wagons were used to collect wastes, from broken items or household waste to the content of chamber pots. Those wagons moved slowly through town throughout the day, and the drovers signaled their arrival in front of each building using double-note fluted pipes. Once the wagons were full enough, their content was dumped in pits located three hills away south of town, along the Orc Road.\n\nCitizen were charged for this waste removal service, paying 1 [[cp]] for each ''bucket'' dumped in the wagons. For the purpose of this service, any container that could be carried by one person unaided was considered as a ''bucket''."

            "Water Supply": "Citizens knew better than drinking from the river, as its waters would cause people to feel sick for a while&mdash;especially visitors which weren't used to it.\n\nInstead, the city was supplied with drinkable water through a midair pipe connecting to an abundant spring on the nearby [[Crytrapper Hill]]. The pipe ended on a wall-tower, where a series of pipes running along the city walls distributed it across the city. Almost every buildings were connected to this flow, and water was accessible through spigots, pumps and cisterns.\n\nIn addition some merchants sold ''\"clearwater\"'' from the [[Weeping Princess Pool]], a nearby rainwater pool. This expensive product was sold in ornate flagons, and bought by snobbish folks."

The ghost was said to be that of [[Esmaelae]], a long-dead noblewoman  of [[Tethyr]], and was known to possess the living to further her searches. Some crimmans let Esmaelae possess them willingly, hoping to find her lost treasure along the way. Her victims were easy to recognize, as her ghostly face was slightly superimposed over theirs. Crimmans were extremely tolerant towards the antics of possessed victims, and sometimes followed them as a form of entertainment.",
            "Thayan murders": "[[Thay]]ans were not welcomed in Crimmor, which didn't deter them from secretly trading items and [[potion]]s infused with dark magic in the city. ''Circa'' [[1370 DR]] several [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were found dead in the streets, their bodies left for citizens to see, with the words ''Thayans Stay Out'' carved in them. Those murders were wildly credited to the Shadow Thieves guild, and sparked numerous rumors amongst the citizens.",

        "Inhabitants": {
            "Guilds": "Five [[guild]]s controlled the major trades in Crimmor: the Smiths, the Dockhands, the Leatherers, the Wagonmakers and the Wheelwrights. To reduce the risks of corruption, they had no guildmasters but elected small, short-term ruling councils instead.\n\n;The Smiths Guild\n[[File:Crimmor smiths guild symbol.png|thumb|130px|''Symbol of the Smiths.'']]\n:The Smiths specialized in producing parts for [[wagon]]s, [[chain]]s, fastening, small hardware (e.g. [[screw]]s, [[bolt (fastener)|bolts]], [[hinge]]s), [[lock (item)|locks]], and [[wire]]s.\n\n;The Dockhands Guild\n[[File:Crimmor dockhands guild symbol.png|thumb|left|130px|''Symbol of the Dockhands.'']]\n:The Dockhands worked with barge and wagon crews, and controlled all loading and unloading on the docks..\n\n;The Leatherers Guild\n[[File:Crimmor leatherers guild symbol.png|thumb|130px|''Symbol of the Leatherers.'']]\n:Among the members of the Leatherers were very good harness-makers, [[saddle]]rs, and [[boots|bootmakers]]. Crimman boots were known to be extremely durable, yet stylish.\n\n;The Wagonmakers Guild\n[[File:Crimmor wagonmakers guild symbol.png|thumb|left|130px|''Symbol of the Wagonmakers.'']]\n:The Wagonmakers of Crimmor were said to be amongst the best in their trade. Although guilds were ruled by councils, the ''de facto'' leader of the Wagonmakers was [[Zan Zoldaftel]]. and numerous members of the guild were his apprentices once.\n\n;The Wheelwrights Guild\n[[File:Crimmor wheelwrights guild symbol.png|thumb|130px|''Symbol of the Wheelwrights.'']]\n:The wheelwrights made and repaired wheels and carriages. As per order of the Mayor, drovers where also part of this guild. This was the result of convincing by the ''three grand families'', who feared that fees should steeply increase should drovers be allowed to form their own guild. The guild also looked over carpenters and woodcutters working in the nearby [[Cloud Peaks]].\n\n;The [[Shadow Thieves]] Guild\n[[File:Shadow thieves symbol.png|thumb|left|130px|''Symbol of the Shadow Thieves.'']]\n:Usually highly secretive, the most powerful Amnian thieves' guild was openly present in Crimmor, which it had declared a theft-free zone. The guild maintained this policy strictly, taking measures against visiting thieves and amateurs, and exposing thieves trying to sell ill-gotten gains inside the city walls. The protection offered by the Shadow Thieves extended outside city walls as well, including the warehouses to the east and the estates of the wealthy to the west.\nIt was said that the origin of this peculiar arrangement came from a debt high-ranking Shadow Thieves members owed to the [[Crytrapper]] family, who provided them alibis and protection when they were caught red-handed.  The guild was so close to the Crytrappers that some of the family's secret warehouses were used to store contraband or guild members.\nThe guild also ensured that no one would counterfeit the badges used on draft animals, by letting it known that every false badge would be worth one finger&mdash;severed from the user.",
            "Nobility": "Three major noble families held influence over Crimmor. They were collectively referred to as the ''grand families'' by the townsfolk.\n\n;[[Crytrapper]] family\n:The head of the family, Lady [[Lamia Crytrapper]], was the cousin of Mayor [[Corlyn Braen]] and as such wielded powerful political influence. Her sister, [[Chynna Crytrapper]], was the local priestess of [[Lliira]]. By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Crytrapper]] family owned most of the taverns in town.\n\n;[[Krimmevol]] family\n:The Krimmevol family was the majority landholder in Crimmor, and owned almost half of the businesses related to caravans.  [[Mikaal Krimmevol]], the family head, was the Mayor's best friend and as such provided an important political power to his family. Mikaal was also secretly the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|Herald]] Sable, keeping an eye on trades and smuggling.\n\n;[[Ophal]] family\n:The Ophal family controlled most of the [[spice]] trade in town. Lady [[Zharnn Ophal]] was a political opponent to the mayor, which she tried to have replaced for years. The Ophal family was as feared as it was respected, with the Mayor being one of the only citizens that dared speak against Lady Ophal in public.\n[[File:Zarnn ophal.png|thumb|right|130px|''[[Zharnn Ophal]], the Dragon Lady'']]",
