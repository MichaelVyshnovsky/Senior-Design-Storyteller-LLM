'''Al-Raqsa''', also called the '''Dancer''', was a small island in the [[Great Sea]] off the coast of [[north Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
Al-Raqsa was located {{SI|150|mi|k|long=yes}} northwest from [[Liham]] and the coast of [[Zakhara]]. [[Al-Tir]] island was found {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}} of its southeast shore and [[Al-Qal'at]] {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} due south. The island itself was roughly {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}} long and {{SI|75|mi|k|long=yes}} wide.

A prominent landrise covered much of the interior of the Dancer. Much of the island was sand and rock, but the northern shoreline was forested.

==Activities==
Along with the other islands in this area, al-Raqsa was highly contested by both the [[Corsair Council|corsairs]] of the [[Corsair Domains]] and representatives of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] for its strategic location.
