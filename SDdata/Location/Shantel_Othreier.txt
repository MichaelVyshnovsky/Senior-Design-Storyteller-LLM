'''Shantel Othreier''' was a realm of [[Sun elf|gold]] and [[moon elves]] during the [[First Flowering]] (founded roughly {{Yearlink|-23600}}).<ref>Steven E. Schend and Kevin Melka (1998). Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves. (TSR, Inc), p. 21.<ref group="note">''[[Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves]]'' has the first settlements of Shantel (mispelled Shamel) Othreier established in {{Yearlink|-23600}} while ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' has the first settlements of Ardeep established in −23,600 DR. ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]'' has Ardeep founded by Shantel Othreier in −23,600 DR. Hence "founded roughly" is used.



==Geography==
Shantel Othreier covered the part of [[west Faerûn]] where the areas later known as the [[Greenfields]] lay.''The Grand History of the Realms'' has [[Ardeep]] founded in the area later known as Greenfields. However it is noted in ''Lost Empires of Faerûn'' that Ardeep was founded by and a vassal realm of Shantel Othreier and encompassed the forest that later became known as the [[Ardeep Forest]]. Therefore, it is more likely Ardeep lay further north, encompassing the area of Ardeep Forest and stretching south along the Sword Coast. Shantel Othreier then lay south of Ardeep and [[Miyeritar]] and north of [[Keltormir]] in the area of the Greenfields, though no source published later then ''Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves'' confirms this theory.

==History==
At the start of the [[Crown Wars]] ({{Yearlink|-12000}}), [[Aryvandaar]] began pressuring Shantel Othreier to accept Aryvandaar occupation following the invasion of [[Miyeritar]].

During the [[Second Crown War]], Shantel Othreier participated in the [[Sable Wars]] in {{Yearlink|-11450}}, aiding [[Eiellûr]] and [[Thearnytaar]] with [[Keltormir]]. Together, these nations attempted to invade [[Ilythiir]], aiming to reform or conquer the [[dark elves]] before they destroyed any more realms. Over half their forces were wiped out by the dark elves' corrupt magic.

When negotiations with Aryvandaar broke down in {{Yearlink|-10900}}, Aryvandaar launched an invasion, starting the [[Third Crown War]].

The Fourth Crown War resulted in much of Shantel Othreier being burned around {{Yearlink|-10110}} by the forces of the [[Ilythiir|Ilythiiri]], as they battled Aryvandaar. Shantel Othreier was destroyed by {{Yearlink|-10100}}.
