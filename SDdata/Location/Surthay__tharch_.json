        "Notable Locations": "*[[Surthay]]: Originally built as a fortress to guard against the forces of Rashemen, the city of Surthay was a stark expression of Thay's social classes. The [[Mulan]] nobles lived in isolated mansions in eastern part of Surthay, well removed from the filth, poverty and crime that was rampant throughout the fisherman's city.",
        "Geographical Features": "*[[Lake Mulsantir]]:\n*[[Surmarsh]]: A dark and fetid swamp, the Surmarsh was infested with all manner of creatures such as [[otyugh]]s, [[roper]]s, [[lizardfolk]] and even [[black dragon]]s. It was a favored region among Thayan trophy hunters.\n*[[River Thay]]: This vital waterway was heavy with traffic from the lakeside city of [[Eltabbar]]."
