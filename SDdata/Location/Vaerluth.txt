Vaerluth was the easternmost goblin realm in the Rauvin Mountains in Luruar.
Vaerluth was located in the caverns and foothills of the eastern Rauvin Mountains.
Vaerluth was ruled by a succession of kings named Vaerluth in 1372 DR, the realm was on its 36th King Vaerluth. Succession of each king came through the murder of his predecessor.
The goblins of Vaerluth were considered the poorest of the goblins in the Rauvin Mountains. They dwelt in huge-spider-infested caverns and foothills, which gave them immunity to the spider venom. The goblins boiled the spider webs to make soup.
