The '''Sacred Oak''' was an [[oak]] tree in [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of [[Evermeet]]. 

==Inhabitants==
At night, the tree was frequented by lovers who make their vows in secrecy. [[Wild elf|wild]] and [[wood elf|wood elves]] claimed that the Sacred Oak was the first tree on Evermeet.

==History==
The tree was believed to have originated in [[Arvandor]] and was looked upon with great respect by the [[elf|elves]] on Evermeet. Once per year each [[Agelong]], Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] visited the tree to assure the island's independence and freedom and to show her dedication to the elven gods.
