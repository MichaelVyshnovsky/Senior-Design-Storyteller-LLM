        "mainbody": "eiritin was a short-lived hin province in the Ralamnish Ridings of West Faer√ªn\nMeiritin was located in an area that later became eastern Amn, among the northern Tejarn Hills east of Lake Esmel. Meiritins eastern border was the kingdom of Valashar.\nMeiritin was an autonomous province in the Calishar Emirates led by a margrave.\nThe margravate was founded in the Year of the Raised Banner, 227 DR by hin emigrants from the Purple Hills region of Tethyr who had been forcibly expelled.\nThis occurred during the reign of Emperor Shoon IV, who encouraged the formation of the Calishar Emirates, which included Meiritin, because he foresaw that he would be able to exploit such small realms with little effort.\nOnly four years after its founding, the largest settlement of Meiritin was conquered by the Mad Mage Ihundyl, who then declared himself the ruler of the whole Emirates. Because of other unrest further south, the Shoon Empire was unable to immediately respond.\nIn 284 DR, a population of halflings numbering in the thousands migrated from Meiritin and Tethyr to Myth Drannor.\nFor much of Meiritins existence, it was threatened by beholders. A famous magical sword known as the Eyestalker was crafted for one of Meiritins lords, and for centuries, a succession of champions of Arvoreen wielded it against the powerful foes before the weapon was eventually lost. It became a part of the collection of the sapphire dragon Bleucorundum\nIn 491 DR, a powerful Calishite nobleman, Kadar el Aktorral, By 523 DR, Meiritin effectively ceased to exist.\nAt this time, some of the refugees from Meiritin joined with dwarves from Dardath, gnomes from Dolblunde, and elves from Ardeep Forest to form the Realm of the Three Crowns against the threat of orc hordes in the North.\nIn the late 14 century DR, halfling lorefinders often traveled to the ruins of Meiritin to explore their historic home.\nAround the same time period, taking advantage of the turmoil caused by the defection of Riatavin and Trailstone and the rise of the Sythillisian Empire, the Knights of the Shield were secretly involved in an attempt to reestablish Meiritin as a puppet margravate under the control of the Knights.\n Hyrzashyr  This river received its name during the time of this kingdom.\n Shimmalshyr  This was another halfling-named river flowing through Meiritin."
