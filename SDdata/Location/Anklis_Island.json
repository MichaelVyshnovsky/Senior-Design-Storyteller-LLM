        "mainbody": "Anklis Island was a small island in the Crowded Sea within west Zakhara.\nAnklis Island was the northernmost island of the archipelago of Al-Zulm Islands. The island was located just south of Durrar Island and the Pearl Banks. Much of the coast of Anklis Island was rocky, while scattered grasslands and deserts could be found in its interior. The entire island was surrounded by coral reefs and submerged rocks sat offshore of the southwest coast. A smaller unnamed island sat off the southeast shore. The island measured roughly  wide and  long. There were no settlements on Anklis Island as of 1367 DR."
