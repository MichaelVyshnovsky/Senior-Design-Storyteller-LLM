The Great Chain Bridge of Ra-Khati was the only known crossing of the Jumpa River.
Located in Ra-Khati, the bridge crossed the Jumpa River and the Jumpa River Gorge into the city of Kushk.
This bridge was made from iron chains, wood and hemp. The bridge would constantly sway with air churned from the pounding current of the Jumpa River.
