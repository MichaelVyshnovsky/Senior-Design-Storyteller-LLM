The '''Dark Dominion''' referred to the tunnels within a {{SI|5|mi|long=yes}} radius of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Activities==
[[Drow]] patrols were a constant presence in the region, searching for banned creatures, monsters and surface elves and challenging them once spotted. A few guard outposts could also be found in these tunnels. At least ten of the tunnels that started here lead to the surface, including one that lead straight past [[Blingdenstone]] and into [[Mithral Hall]] and another that lead to the [[High Forest]].
