        "Geography": "The site lay in central Narfell where the northern route from [[Peltarch]] met the Long Road. It lay just west of [[N'Jast]].",
        "Trade": "Jiyyd's position as a crossroads between the Long Road and Peltarch made it a major site of trade and barter between the [[Nars]] and foreigners. The occasional [[goblin]] tribe would also come to Jiyyd for trade.",
        "History": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Jiyyd was little more than an informal campsite at the junction of two wide roads, although it was one of the more commonly used campgrounds in Narfell owing to its location on the Long Road.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, it had grown into a permanent village of hide tends and stone huts. It was known as the first civilized stop along the Long Road road in Narfell for travelers from [[Damara]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Delyth Caravanserai]], the largest structure in the village as of the late 15{{th}} century DR."
