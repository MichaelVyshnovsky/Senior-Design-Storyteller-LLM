The Valley of Nanayok was a valley in the eastern end of the Koryaz Mountains of the Northern Wastes of Kara-Tur.
By 1357 DR, the valley was filled with ruins, though mostly no more than heaps of crumbling stones shrouded in vegetation. It was believed to have been a center of Maraloi culture and politics. It was whispered that places beneath the ground here still contained the secrets of the "Ancient Lords." By 1479 DR, the Ruins of Nanayok were one of the more notable mysteries of Kara-Tur.
Strict taboos existed among the Pazruki tribes about visiting the ruins or accepting items taken from them. Only a few intrepid Pazruki wu jen dared investigate the site those who returned did not speak of what they might have found.
