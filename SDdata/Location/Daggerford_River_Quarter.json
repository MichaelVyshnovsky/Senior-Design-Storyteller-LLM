        "mainbody": "The '''River Quarter''', also known as the '''Riverman's Quarter''', was one of the wards that made up the small riverside town of [[Daggerford]]. It was home to a number of long-standing businesses and guildhalls, as well as the personal residence to those residents that worked at the [[Delimbiyr River]] docks.",
        "Geography": "This quarter of Daggerford was located on the southern side of town, between the [[Drill Field]] and the town's stables.{{DagLoc}}\n\nOn the southeastern side of Riverman's Quarter was the River Gate. Just beyond the gate was ''Tyndal's Bridge'', which was named after the legendary [[Tyndal]] who originally built the town's [[Ducal Castle]]. Over the bridge and across the moat was the town's somewhat small port, which included a few docks and some waterfront structures.",
        "Trade": "Ships traveling upriver along the [[Delimbiyr River|Delimbiyr]] often stopped at Daggerford to unload their cargo. Dockworkers spent much of their time transferring these goods so they could be moved north or south along the [[High Road]].\n\nOther vessels merely passed through town, en route to the many small holds located along the banks of the river, or further down to the town of [[Secomber]].",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Businesses": "* [[Clean Chin|The Clean Chin]]: Quite the unique establishment, the Clean Chin operated as both a barber's shop and mortuary.\n* [[Daggerthrust Ales]]: Many Daggerfordians became very excited every time this brewery released one of their new beers or ales.\n* [[Dekoran Boatwright]]: This massive shipyard specialized in the construction of canoes, rafts, and smaller fishing ships.\n* [[Derval's Smithy]]: While [[Derval's Bright Blade]] was previously located in Daggerford's [[Money Quarter]], it was relocated to the River Quarter and later bequeathed to Derval's grandson, [[Ignal Ironeater]], after his passing.<ref name=GDC-p138\">\n\n{{Former}}\n* [[Flying Fish]]: This market was the best place to buy fresh seafood circa the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.",
            "Halls": "* Blacksmiths' Guildhouse: While the hall had an area within which apprentice blacksmiths could hone their craft, this hall was largely used as a tavern and meeting place to discuss guild issues.\n* [[Mariners' Alliance]]: Joining the Daggerford guild of sailors and boatmen was a good way to secure work aboard a ship.\n* [[Moneylenders' Coalition]]: Daggerford's money lenders were little more than than intimidating thugs with access to [[magic]]al means.\n* [[Pleaders' Consortium]]: The lawyers and professional advocates of Daggerford operated from within an extravagantly decorated guildhall.\n* [[Watermen's Circle]]: The organization of water-bearers and fire fighters was supported by local taxes.",
            "Inns and taverns": "* [[Black Stone Inn]]: It was believed that this low-cost boarding house fell under the influence of the [[Zhentarim]] for some time.\n* [[Otter's Run]]: This tavern was often the first site encountered by those entering town from the[[Trade Way]].\n* [[River Shining Tavern]]: The tavern was located in the Riverman's Quarter for some time, before being relocated to the site of the old [[Grand Playhouse]] in the [[Farmers' Quarter]].\n* [[Silver Flood Inn]]: This establishment was founded during the midâ€“15{{th}} century when [[silver]] was discovered in the nearby [[Sword Hills]].",
            "Landmarks": "* Jail and Constabulary: Daggerford's constable and their deputies maintained the peace, suppressed illicit activities and if necessary, locked up those that broke local laws.\n* River Gate: The southern-facing gate was large enough that shops could be brought from the town's shipyards down to the docks.\n* Town Guard Barracks: Like the local shrine of [[Tempus]], the town's barracks were constructed following the [[Second Dragonspear War]] to cater to the garrison of [[Waterdhavian]] [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|guardsmen]].",
            "Places of Worship": "* [[Table of the Sword]]: Originally founded by [[Baergon Bluesword]], this holy house served the faithful of Tempus for well over a hundred years."
