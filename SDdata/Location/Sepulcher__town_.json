        "mainbody": "'''Sepulcher''' was a city of [[Netheril]] and the site of the largest temple in that empire, the [[House of Mystery|Reign of Night]].",
        "Geography": "Sepulcher was located on the northern bank of the [[Narrow Sea]], The town was southeast of the [[dwarven]] port of [[Ascore]] and southwest of the town of [[Arctic Rim]]. The [[Cold Forest]] was to the north. Because it was so far north, it was dark and cold much of the year.",
        "Trade": "The town used to sail timber over the Narrow Sea to other Netherese settlements.",
        "History": "The town was founded in 1473 [[Netheril Year|NY]], It originally served as a logging community, to harvest trees from the Cold Forest. The cold weather and the distance from the forest prevented the town from ever thriving financially from timber production.\n\nDuring the [[Golden Age of Netheril]], specifically around between {{Yearlink|-1859}} and {{Yearlink|-1359}}, worshipers of the goddess [[Shar]] migrated slowly and secretly to the area around the town, finding the darkness of the northern latitudes more tolerable than elsewhere in the Empire. Moreover, the population of the area paid them little heed, since many of its people were outcasts from Netherese society.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-955}}, the neighboring city of Arctic Rim became a ruin, and many of that city's citizens migrated to Sepulcher, leading to its highest ever population.\n\nBy the first half of the [[Shadowed Age of Netheril]], [[orc]] tribes from the [[Dementia Mountains]] became a severe problem in the region. Beginning in {{Yearlink|-649}}, they began raiding the town. The constant need for defense against the orcs over the next centuries meant that the citizens did not have the resources to protect against the magically encroaching [[Anauroch]]. By {{Yearlink|-255}}, the area was useless for either logging or fishing, and the town was abandoned.",
        "Notable Locations": "Located in the town, the Reign of Night, was both the largest temple in the entire empire and the most important holy site for the [[Church of Shar]] at that time.",
        "Inhabitants": "Most of the original inhabitants of the town were workers who could not find employment elsewhere."
