        "mainbody": "'''Ust Natha''' was a [[drow]] city in the Underdark under northwestern [[Tethyr]], in [[Old Shanatar]]. It was maintained by the drow as a symbol, marking the location of a nearby temple on the surface where the first drow descended underground; its name means \"the first\".",
        "Geography": "Ust Natha was located in the Underdark under [[Old Shanatar]]. It neighboured many other settlements. Its temple and city were fought over regularly by the drow and surface [[elf|elves]] (including those from [[Suldanessellar]]), though the [[silver dragon]], [[Adalon]], guarded the area and tried to govern the hostilities, often with success. The entrance to her lair was located near Ust Natha, but the drow were incapable of entering it due to a wall of magical, impenetrable darkness blocking the passage. Other neighbours of Ust Natha included outposts of [[kuo-toa]], [[illithid]], and [[beholder]]s, all of whom were regarded as rivals by the drow; and a [[svirfneblin]] village that was independent but played a subservient role to the drow. At the other end of the same main cavern from which all of these settlements are accessed, there was also a hole leading upwards all the way into [[City of Caverns]], a [[sahuagin]] settlement. The drow had no dealings with the sahuagin, but some of their race did occupy a section of that city in the past.\n\nUst Natha was mostly built on platforms above the natural bottom of its cavern, many supported on stalagmites, with most on the same level but a few above the others. Buildings of note in the city included guilds for female and male [[fighter]]s, as well as for [[wizard]]s, and a grand temple of [[Lolth]] at its eastern end.",
