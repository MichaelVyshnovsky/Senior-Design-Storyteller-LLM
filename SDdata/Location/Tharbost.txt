'''Tharbost''' was a mountain in the [[Storm Horns]].

==Geography==
It was one of the highest peaks in the range, and it overlooked the [[Tunlands]].

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Tharbost's peak had been shattered by a battle between dragons, leaving behind a plateau with a jagged ridge along its western edge, which provided some protection against the strong winds prevalent in the mountain range.

In early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[the Simbul]] held brief parlay with a manifested [[Mystra]] after the meeting of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]].
