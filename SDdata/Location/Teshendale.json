        "History": "In [[1316 DR]] it was invaded by [[Zhent]] forces and [[orc]]s working for them. The people were slain, enslaved or driven away, and thousands of refugees sought refuge in the surrounding dales.\n\nThe valley was quarried and the [[granite]] used to build vast sections of the walls that protected Zhentil Keep.. They continued to strip the land of its resources for over 50 years.\n\nDuring the late mid 1300's DR, a bandit known as [[Tyran the Outlaw]] struck back against the Zhent forces. Though he had few forces to muster, his efforts had earned himself a 500 [[gp]] bounty."
