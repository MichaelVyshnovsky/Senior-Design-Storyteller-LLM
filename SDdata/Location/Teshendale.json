        "mainbody": "ituated along the valley of the River Tesh, Teshendale was a lost dale once occupied the rocky territory spanning from Zhentil Keep to the Desertsmouth Mountains, Teshen Valley or Teshen. The former dale became a desolate land covered in ruins in the early 14 century DR.\nThe Dales Council continued to keep an empty seat for Teshendale as a reminder of what happened when the Dales do not stick together.\nHome to a number of monstrous humanoid and goblinoid races, the former dale was almost completely overrun with goblins, orcs and ogres.\n*Mount Tesh This mysterious peak was home to a number of reported sightings of dancing lights.\nAlthough no longer part of the Dalelands, the cities of Teshwave and Snowmantle remained under control of Zhentil Keep until their destruction.\n*Teshwave Once the largest trading community in Teshendale, the city became a staging area for Zhent non-human troops and mercenaries.\n*Snowmantle Located along the edge of the Border Forest, this settlement became a Zhent logging camp..\nIn 1316 DR it was invaded by Zhent forces and orcs working for them. The people were slain, enslaved or driven away, and thousands of refugees sought refuge in the surrounding dales.\nThe valley was quarried and the granite used to build vast sections of the walls that protected Zhentil Keep.. They continued to strip the land of its resources for over 50 years.\nDuring the late mid 1300s DR, a bandit known as Tyran the Outlaw struck back against the Zhent forces. Though he had few forces to muster, his efforts had earned himself a 500 gp bounty."
