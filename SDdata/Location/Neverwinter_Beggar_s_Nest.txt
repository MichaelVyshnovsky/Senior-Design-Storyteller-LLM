The '''Beggar's Nest''' was one of the districts of [[Neverwinter]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The Beggar's Nest comprised the southeast quadrant of the city. It was named for the district's inhabitants, the poorest of Neverwinter. 

==History==
===Plague===
During the city's struggle with the [[Wailing Death]] in [[1372 DR]], the Beggar's Nest was the most afflicted, as the plague first appeared there. The district was soon overrun by [[undead]], as many of the inhabitants of the district died to the plague and a [[yuan-ti]] named [[Gulnan]] took advantage of the chaos to raise an army of undead. Eventually, the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] defeated the yuan-ti, disrupting her [[necromantic]] [[ritual|rituals]] and putting an end to the undead nightmare.

===Eruption===
When [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted in [[1451 DR]], bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the Beggar's Nest was completely destroyed by the earthquakes that followed the cataclysm. A huge, canyon-like [[chasm]] replaced most of the district.

==Notable landmarks==
* [[Neverwinter Academy]]
* The [[Shining Serpent Inn]]
