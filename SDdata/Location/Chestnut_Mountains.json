        "mainbody": "he Chestnut Mountains, also known as the Kurisammyaku, was a mountain range located in Kozakura.\nThe Chestnut Mountains were located in Miyama Province on the island of Shinkoku. The chain of wooded peaks and ridges cut through the middle of the Province. Within these hills, swift-flowing streams carved their path through narrow valleys. The majority of these valleys were densely packed with forests, forming a carpet that draped over the mountain slopes, while certain slopes had been cleared to make way for farming.\nIn a posthouse at the strategic entrance to the pass through the Chestnut Mountains, Osamu Muraoka led a company of thirty samurai and four hundred bushi."
