        "Geography": "Morovar sat on the eastern bank of the [[Goliad River]] in the southwest corner of Morov.",
        "Activities": "Once the capital of the barony, Morov was on the decline in the 1350s [[DR]]. This was a direct result of [[Dimian Ree]] moving his seat of power to [[Heliogabalus]]. Many of Morovar's wealthy nobles abandoned the city to follow their lord, taking much of Morovar's spirit with them.\n\nMorovar's lack of a firm ruler left them nearly helpless when faced with a conflict since the local militia was painfully slow to organize.",
        "Inhabitants": "Many of Morovar's citizens felt scorned by their lord's departure and secretly dreamed of allying with [[Brandiar]]."
