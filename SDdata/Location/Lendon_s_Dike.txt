Lendons Dike, also called Lendons Wall, was an earthen berm that spanned the width of the Winterspear Vale as of the early 15 century DR.
The Dike was an earthen wall meant to defend the Vale from invaders from the north. A ditch was dug along the northern side to make the fortification a greater barrier and a row of straight trees marked the top of the berm. The Vale Road passed through a gap in the Dike.
The Dike was located about  north of Hulburg along the Winterspear River. It spanned a mile and a half (2.4 kilometers) across the Winterspear Vale on the eastern side of the river. Open farmland marked both sides of the wall.
The Dike was raised in the early 15 century DR It was intended to provide a defensible location to repel orc raids in the Winterspear Vale, but fell out of use in the mid&ndash15 century DR when orc raids became less frequent.
When the Bloody Skull orcs and their allies marched on Hulburg from Thar in the , the Hulburgians made a last stand at the old dike. They worked tirelessly through the night of Tarsakh 11 to fortify the earthworks, felling trees and clearing brambles on the southern side to create barriers on the northern side.
