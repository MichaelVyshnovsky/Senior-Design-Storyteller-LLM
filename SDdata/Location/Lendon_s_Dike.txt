'''Lendon's Dike''', also called '''Lendon's Wall''', was an earthen berm that spanned the width of the [[Winterspear Vale]] as of the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The Dike was an earthen wall meant to defend the Vale from invaders from the north. A ditch was dug along the northern side to make the fortification a greater barrier and a row of straight trees marked the top of the berm. The [[Vale Road]] passed through a gap in the Dike.

==Geography==
The Dike was located about {{SI|3|miles|k|long=yes}} north of [[Hulburg]] along the [[Winterspear River]]. It spanned a mile and a half (2.4 kilometers) across the Winterspear Vale on the eastern side of the river.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} Open farmland marked both sides of the wall.

==History==
The Dike was raised in the early 15{{th}} century DR It was intended to provide a defensible location to repel [[orc]] raids in the Winterspear Vale, but fell out of use in the mid&ndash;15{{th}} century DR when orc raids became less frequent.

When the [[Blood Skull (tribe)|Bloody Skull]] orcs and their allies marched on Hulburg from [[Thar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Hulburgians made a last stand at the old dike. They worked tirelessly through the night of [[Tarsakh 11]] to fortify the earthworks, felling trees and clearing brambles on the southern side to create barriers on the northern side.
