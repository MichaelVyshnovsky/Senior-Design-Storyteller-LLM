        "mainbody": "erydren was one of the Six Holy Cities of the ixitxachitl nation in the Sea of Fallen Stars known as the Xedran Reefs.\nLike all of the chitl cities, Orilidren consisted of a huge warren of tunnels and subcaverns. This included a central entrance to the surface, with passages riddled in traps, and large cavern beneath that site with a great temple to Ilxendren around which the rest of the city grew outward from.\nThere stood an outbuilding near the temple for the Devitans personal slaves, at least four caverns on the outskirts of the city in which other slaves were kept, two military garrisons, and at least four public shrines on the city outskirts that were deciated to Ilxendren. \nBerydren stood to the south of ixitxachitl capital city Xedras and to the northwest of the merfolk city of Thuridru.\nAround the 14 century DR this city was led by Devitan Reakdar. Serving under him as leader of the citys military was Baalex, a vampiric ixitxachitl.\nDue to Berydren close proximity to the merfolk city of Thuridru, it more than any of the other Six Holy Cities acted as a military stronghold. Like the other Six Holy Cities, it had outlying minor temples to Ilxendren that doubled as outposts."
