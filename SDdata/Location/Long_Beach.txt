The '''Long Beach''' was a stretch of sandy coastland along northwestern [[Threskel]], where the land met the waters of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Description==
A number of small fisher communities sprang up across the beach throughout the years. Its waters rich with great populations of [[fish]].

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], few human settlements remained along the Long Beach. Fishing boats faced the risk of being swallowed up the [[Alasklerbanbastos|Great Bone Wyrm's]] [[dragon]] servitors as they gulped down great groups of aquatic animals in the sea.
