        "mainbody": "idoyama, also known as Two-Peaks Mountain, was a mountain located in Kozakura.\nNidoyama was located in western Maeshi Province on the island of Shinkoku. It was one of the few snow-covered peaks in Kozakura, boasting several small glaciers that graced its narrow cleft valleys.\nWhile Nidoyama seemed unremarkable at first glance, its significance lied in the enduring presence of korobokuru. Despite the majority of their kin having migrated to Tenmei ages ago, the korobokuru in this region steadfastly refused to emigrate and continued to call Nidoyama their home.\nAdditionally, the area surrounding Nidoyama was inhabited by numerous river spirit folk who held special ties to the run-off streams flowing from the glaciers."
