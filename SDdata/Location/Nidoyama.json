        "Description": "Nidoyama was located in western [[Maeshi Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. It was one of the few snow-covered peaks in Kozakura, boasting several small glaciers that graced its narrow cleft valleys.",
        "Inhabitants": "While Nidoyama seemed unremarkable at first glance, its significance lied in the enduring presence of [[korobokuru]]. Despite the majority of their kin having migrated to [[Tenmei]] ages ago, the korobokuru in this region steadfastly refused to emigrate and continued to call Nidoyama their home.\n\nAdditionally, the area surrounding Nidoyama was inhabited by numerous [[river spirit folk]] who held special ties to the run-off streams flowing from the glaciers."
