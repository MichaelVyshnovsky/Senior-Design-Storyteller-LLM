'''Starspur''' was the county of [[Tethyr]] encompassing the [[Starspire Peninsula]]. It was known for the city of [[Zazesspur]], the sometime capital of that kingdom.

==Description==
Unlike the lowlands of Tethyr, the county of Starspur was infested with a variety of monsters, because there were so many mountains, hills, cliffs, and sea caves for them to inhabit.

==Geography==
Starspur was part of the [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|Duchy]] of [[Kamlann]].

==Inhabitants==
The wild lands of Starspur were home to [[goblinoid]]s, [[cyclopskin]], [[urd]]s, and [[flind]]s. [[Peryton]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[fire drake]]s, and possibly [[dragon]]s also lived in the region.

==Government==
In [[1370 DR]], Starspur was ruled over by the Countess and Royal Admiral [[Corinna Dezlentyr]]. Her castle was named [[Battles' End]] and was situated atop high foothills.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Cloister of St. Ramedar]] : This [[Church of Ilmater|Ilmatari]] monastery served as Tethyr's primary prison and insane asylum.
; [[Fortress Faithful]] : This famous, cliff-side fortress was dedicated to the god [[Tyr]].
; Zazesspur : This was the largest and richest city of Tethyr and was sometimes its capital.
