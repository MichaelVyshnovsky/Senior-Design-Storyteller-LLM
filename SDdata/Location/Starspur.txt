Starspur was the county of Tethyr encompassing the Starspire Peninsula. It was known for the city of Zazesspur, the sometime capital of that kingdom.
Unlike the lowlands of Tethyr, the county of Starspur was infested with a variety of monsters, because there were so many mountains, hills, cliffs, and sea caves for them to inhabit.
Starspur was part of the Duchy of Kamlann.
The wild lands of Starspur were home to goblinoids, cyclopskin, urds, and flinds. Perytons, hippogriffs, fire drakes, and possibly dragons also lived in the region.
In 1370 DR, Starspur was ruled over by the Countess and Royal Admiral Corinna Dezlentyr. Her castle was named Battles End and was situated atop high foothills.
