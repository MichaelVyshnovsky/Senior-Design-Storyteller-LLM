It was located on the [[Street of the Dragon]] not far from the Sunset Gate out of the city. [[Saurovin Street]] also intersected the Westmarket at its southern point and headed southeast. The largest building facing the Westmarket was the popular [[Mighty Mace]] inn and tavern on the southeast side.{{Cite dragon/287/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Shadowdark House|70}}"
