Athkatla, also known as the City of Coin, was the oldest settlement and capital of the mercantile nation of Amn. It was one of the wealthiest countries in all of Faerûn, where nearly every aspect of life revolved around money and commerce.
The streets of Athkatla were well lit in the evenings, thanks to the massive, halfling-sized street oil lamps known as "storm-lanterns". They were kept aflame by patrols of six civil servants armed with double-hooked metal poles and vats of oil.
The City of Coin was abuzz with peddlers and hustlers, hard-haggling merchants who were as competitive as they were ruthless in their pursuit of coin. The city offered a stark contrast between those who held power, i.e. money, and those who did not. Organizations that ran the citys economy, such as the oppressive Cowled Wizards, the enigmatic  Shadow Thieves guild or obscenely wealthy mercantile houses could act with complete authority and near impunity. For the weak and the poor in the slums of the River District, life in the city was an overwhelming affair, where danger loomed at nearly every turn.
Decadence and overindulgence was a common pastime for the wealthier of Athkatlas citizens, especially those living in the Gem District. When someone ate and drank too much in a night of revelry, or after seafood that had expired, they would engage in "straking" or the forceful emptying of their stomach.

Athkatla was ruled by the Council of Five (formerly the Council of Six). Although council positions were once held anonymously, the council members ruled openly as of the late 15 century DR.
The five council positions were held by House Selemchant who sponsored the Cowled Wizards of Athkatla, House Dannihyr which belonged to the Shadow Thieves, House Alibakkar, House Ophal and House Nashivaar which was closely allied with the church of Cyric.
Just about anything was acceptable in Athkatla and actions that would be illegal or immoral in other lands were tolerated. The law permitted nearly anything including lewdness and slavery.
Minor laws could be broken, so long as the corresponding fine was paid, which often occurred before the offense. Thieves within the city operated under written contracts more than anywhere else in Faerûn.
The practice or use of arcane magic was explicitly illegal within the city of Athkatla, a ban which dated back to a royal decree by the young King Dhanar Parhek the late 13 century DR. Spellcasting by wizards or sorcerers were limited to a select few who were licensed by the High Houses of Amn, or their magical enforcement agency, the Cowled Wizards, who acted as little more than mercenaries and spies for House Selemchant.
The heraldry of the city was a circular shield containing a scarlet triangle on a field of rich purple. The triangle was equilateral with one angle pointing up, and it filled the shield so that all of its three points touched the edges. In the center was a white diamond, long axis horizontal. Around the edge of the shield, but just a little inward from the actual edge, were twelve golden discs distributed at an equal distance from each other, representing gold coins.
The symbolism behind this coat of arms was as follow
* The purple field represented opulence and refinement
* The red triangle represented textiles and luxury
* The diamond represented a massive wealth
* The gold coins represented the wealth flowing into Athkatla from everywhere else

City Gates
​​
The city had six outer gates, that, save for the Sparandar, required a toll of "any one coin" as a fee to pass through. Typically a fandar was given to the toll-taker but if any unrecognizable currency was used, they would demand a coin of silver or gold.
Clockwise from the north the gates were
* Alandamers Gate (B1) Led north out of the Wave District.
* Meirtyn Gate (F2) Opened eastward on the north bank of the Alandor River.
* Heroes Gate (F4) Also opened eastward, however on the southern bank from the Guards District.
* Sparandar Gate (E7) Led southbound out of the Grave District.
* Julkoon Gate (D6) Located a few blocks south from Waukeens Promenade in the Center District.
* Oloemandur Gate (B7)
The Sea-Gates (A4) allowed for ships to enter the citys harbor from the Sea of Swords and the Chain-Gate (F3) granted access down the Alandor River.
Bridge District
The narrow, winding streets south of Athkatlas bridge (E4) was home to the citys many poor laborers, who lived lives a mere step above those within the River District. It was full of small, shoddy shops selling illicit goods and businesses that served the great number of caravans that entered Athkatlas walls.
Mithrest (E5) was a notable inn located here.
Center District
Nestled in the center of the city on the southern bank of the Alandor River, the heart of Athkatlas mercantile class

* Waukeens Promenade (C6) One of the most&mdashif not the single-most&mdashrecognizable landmarks of the city,
Gem District
Home to the "new money" families within the city, who constantly competed with their contemporaries with ostentatious displays of the excesses of wealth. If the streets of Athkatla were paved with gold, they were surely found in the Gem district.
Notable locations

Grave District
Within the graveyard of the city, which was connected to the other districts via the Cold Dolor, were ornate monuments and mausoleums erected in reverence to the Amnian dead. Although it was heavily patrolled by city guards, the district was often used for discreet meetings and rendezvous at night.
Guards District
The quarter of Athkatla catered to the citys mercenaries and adventures. The adventuring lifestyle was looked down upon in the city, and were not often commonly found in other areas of the city.
Notable locations
* Den of the Seven Vales One of the citys cleaner festhalls
* Five Flagons A popular tavern during the mid-1300s
River District
Home to the slums of Athkatla, the river district was home to the citys poorest and most destitute citizens. The mean streets near the Alandor river stunk of trash, which was shipped out of the docks by means of barge.
Notable locations
* Copper Coronet A dangerous and seedy dive whose regulars included smugglers, pirates and other for-hire naer-do-wells
Scepter District
The most exclusive section of the city was home to the administrative office of the Council of Five and contained the sprawling estates of the most influential Amnian aristocracy such as the Chainstone and the Hardsharn families.
Notable locations

The city was founded around 100 DR by the Shoon Imperium along with Murann and Crimmor with mostly Calishite immigrants, in what was then known as "the emirate of Amin". The Empire fell and in 460 DR, Amn became an independent nation with the city of Esmeltaran as its capital city (despite Athkatla being the oldest and most established city).
Things got worse from 1238 DR forward as every three or four decades saw a trade war erupt that would last for two or three years at a stretch. The worst one came in 1333 DR when all trade in or out of Amn was stopped. A young merchant from Athkatla named Thayze Selemchant had just inherited a rich spice-importing business and the most affluent trading house in the city. He refused to allow this trade war to squash the wealth and power he would inevitably gain from his inheritance, so he personally went out and "persuaded" (using his intelligence, charisma, secret powers of magic and the third largest personal fortune in the country) five other Amnian merchant house leaders into forming a new government that wouldnt be so susceptible to these trade wars. The attempt succeeded and peace reigned once more (though only with a compact of mutual nonaggression with the Shadow Thieves). The new "Council of Six" was based in Athkatla and the city became Amns new capital and busiest trade port on the Sword Coast.
By the , the churches of Lathander and Talos grew enough to be locked in a series of constant conflicts for the dominance in the city. Many Athkatlans believed that the rivalry was soon to erupt in open war.
In the late 14 century DR as the last free port in Amn, Athkatla became the hub for nearly all the trade from Maztica although contact with Maztica ended when the entire continent was transported to Abeir during the Spellplague in 1385 DR.
