'''Athkatla''', also known as the '''City of Coin''', was the oldest settlement and capital of the mercantile nation of [[Amn]]. It was one of the wealthiest countries in all of [[Faerûn]], where nearly every aspect of life revolved around money and commerce.

==Description==
The streets of Athkatla were well lit in the evenings, thanks to the massive, [[halfling]]-sized street oil lamps known as "''storm-lanterns''". They were kept aflame by patrols of six civil servants armed with double-hooked metal poles and vats of oil.

==Society==
The ''City of Coin'' was abuzz with peddlers and hustlers, hard-haggling merchants who were as competitive as they were ruthless in their pursuit of coin. The city offered a stark contrast between those who held power, i.e. money, and those who did not. Organizations that ran the city's economy, such as the oppressive [[Cowled Wizards]], the enigmatic [[Shadow Thieves| Shadow Thieves guild]] or obscenely wealthy [[:Category:Amnian houses|mercantile houses]] could act with complete authority and near impunity. For the weak and the poor in the slums of the [[River District (Athkatla)|River District]], life in the city was an overwhelming affair, where danger loomed at nearly every turn.

Decadence and overindulgence was a common pastime for the wealthier of Athkatla's citizens, especially those living in the [[Gem District (Athkatla)|Gem District]]. When someone ate and drank too much in a night of revelry, or after seafood that had expired, they would engage in ''"straking"'' or the forceful emptying of their stomach.

==Government==
[[File:Athkatla merchants nobles.png|thumb|''Wealthy merchants of Athkatla conducting business.'']]
Athkatla was ruled by the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]] (formerly the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]]). Although council positions were once held anonymously, the council members ruled openly as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

The five council positions were held by: House [[Selemchant]] who sponsored the [[Cowled Wizards of Athkatla]], House [[Dannihyr]] which belonged to the [[Shadow Thieves]], House [[Alibakkar]], House [[Ophal]] and House [[Nashivaar]] which was closely allied with the [[Church of Cyric|church]] of [[Cyric]].

===Laws===
Just about anything was acceptable in Athkatla and actions that would be illegal or immoral in other lands were tolerated. The law permitted nearly anything including lewdness and [[slavery]].

Minor laws could be broken, so long as the corresponding fine was paid, which often occurred before the offense. Thieves within the city operated under written contracts more than anywhere else in Faerûn.

===Magic===
The practice or use of [[arcane]] magic was explicitly illegal within the city of Athkatla, a ban which dated back to a royal decree by the young King [[Dhanar Parhek]] the late 13{{th}} century DR. Spellcasting by [[wizard]]s or [[sorcerer]]s were limited to a select few who were licensed by the High Houses of Amn, or their [[magic]]al enforcement agency, the [[Cowled Wizards]], who acted as little more than mercenaries and spies for [[Selemchant|House Selemchant]].

===Heraldry===
The heraldry of the city was a circular shield containing a scarlet triangle on a field of rich purple. The triangle was equilateral with one angle pointing up, and it filled the shield so that all of its three points touched the edges. In the center was a white diamond, long axis horizontal. Around the edge of the shield, but just a little inward from the actual edge, were twelve golden discs distributed at an equal distance from each other, representing gold coins.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/Heraldry of Crimmor and Athkatla}}

The symbolism behind this coat of arms was as follow:
* The purple field represented opulence and refinement
* The red triangle represented textiles and luxury
* The diamond represented a massive wealth
* The gold coins represented the wealth flowing into Athkatla from everywhere else

==Notable Locations==
All of the following locations have a grid address so that they can be found in the accompanying map of Athkatla, ''circa'' 1370 DR.

;City Gates:
{{/Imagemap}}​​
The city had six outer gates, that, save for the Sparandar, required a toll of "any one coin" as a fee to pass through. Typically a ''[[fandar]]'' was given to the toll-taker but if any unrecognizable currency was used, they would demand a coin of [[silver]] or [[gold]].

Clockwise from the north the gates were:
* Alandamer's Gate (B1): Led north out of the [[Wave District (Athkatla)|Wave District]].
* Meirtyn Gate (F2): Opened eastward on the north bank of the Alandor River.
* Heroes' Gate (F4): Also opened eastward, however on the southern bank from the [[Guards District (Athkatla)|Guards District]].
* Sparandar Gate (E7): Led southbound out of the [[Grave District (Athkatla)|Grave District]].
* Julkoon Gate (D6): Located a few blocks south from [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the [[Center District (Athkatla)|Center District]].
* Oloemandur Gate (B7)

The Sea-Gates (A4) allowed for ships to enter the city's harbor from the [[Sea of Swords]] and the Chain-Gate (F3) granted access down the Alandor River.

;[[Bridge District]]:
The narrow, winding streets south of Athkatla's bridge (E4) was home to the city's many poor laborers, who lived lives a mere step above those within the [[River District (Athkatla)|River District]]. It was full of small, shoddy shops selling illicit goods and businesses that served the great number of caravans that entered Athkatla's walls.

[[Mithrest]] (E5) was a notable inn located here.

;[[Center District]]:
Nestled in the center of the city on the southern bank of the [[Alandor River]], the heart of Athkatla's mercantile class

Notable locations:
* [[Daranthur's Hall]]: This market, found in downtown Athkatla, was one of the first of the "shared-roof" markets that is became increasingly popular in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/407/Eye on the Realms: A Surprising Vintage|44,45}}
* [[Delosar's Inn]] (C6): This inn and tavern was frequented by city guards.
* [[Sea's Bounty Tavern]] (D5): An old inn, tavern, and festhall.
* [[Silverale Hall]] (D6): This inn, tavern, and festhall was one of the oldest in the whole city.
* [[Waukeen's Promenade]] (C6): One of the most&mdash;if not the single-most&mdash;recognizable landmarks of the city,

;[[Gem District]]:
Home to the "new money" families within the city, who constantly competed with their contemporaries with ostentatious displays of the excesses of wealth. If the streets of Athkatla were paved with gold, they were surely found in the Gem district.

Notable locations:
* [[Adamantine Mug]]: This surprisingly reasonable tavern served a club of sorts for the district's merchants, offering discreet and superb service
* [[Dancing Dolphins House]]: This "open mansion", owned by [[Albaerlus Gudelmar]], was often used to host Athkaltan "[[shieldring]]s", or gatherings of wealthy merchant families
* [[Diamond Dragon]]: The most expensive jewelry shop within the city of Athkatla
* [[Dome of the Rose]]: An elegantly designed monastery devoted to the deity [[Lathander]]
* Flamethrower Fountain: This common meeting place in the west section of the district was frequented by [[perfume]] peddlers
*[[Shadowgates House]]: A private club that catered exclusively to wealthy and noble-born Athkatlan women

;[[Grave District]]:
Within the graveyard of the city, which was connected to the other districts via the ''Cold Dolor'', were ornate monuments and mausoleums erected in reverence to the Amnian dead. Although it was heavily patrolled by city guards, the district was often used for discreet meetings and rendezvous at night.

;[[Athkatla/Guards District|Guards District]]:
The quarter of Athkatla catered to the city's mercenaries and adventures. The adventuring lifestyle was looked down upon in the city, and were not often commonly found in other areas of the city.

Notable locations:
* [[Den of the Seven Vales]]: One of the city's cleaner festhalls
* [[Five Flagons]]: A popular tavern during the mid-1300's

;[[Athkatla/River District|River District]]:
Home to the slums of Athkatla, the river district was home to the city's poorest and most destitute citizens. The mean streets near the Alandor river stunk of trash, which was shipped out of the docks by means of barge.

Notable locations:
* [[Copper Coronet]]: A dangerous and seedy dive whose regulars included smugglers, pirates and other for-hire naer-do-wells

;[[Scepter District]]:
The most exclusive section of the city was home to the administrative office of the Council of Five and contained the sprawling estates of the most influential Amnian aristocracy such as the [[Chainstone]] and the [[Hardsharn]] families.

Notable locations:
*[[Cloakspell tower]]
*[[Council House]]: The seat of power for the city's ruling [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]].

;[[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]]:
Previously the hub of [[arcane]] societies within the city, this quadrant has changed to encompass the business offices and homes of many wealthy merchants, as well as a number of holy sites and inns that catered to [[pilgrim]]s from across Faerûn.

Notable locations:
* [[Brundith Fine Furnishings]]: This shop specialized in replica furniture with discreet hiding places
* [[Crown Aflame]]: Also known as "the Red Fruit", this lavish theater located on [[Sarlannus Street]] was a previous temple to [[Azuth]]
* [[Harfin Draether]]: An expansive tavern that was renowned for its hearty and delicious fare of foods
* [[Klarynda Ballasdreia|House of "The Lady of Masks"]]: Lady Bellasdreia sold perfume and beauty masks from her home, a former temple of [[Tymora]]
* [[Pride of Athkatla]]: An enclosed market where traveling merchants could hire vendors within the city to sell their goods
* [[Society of the Lost Ingot|Hall of the Society of the Lost Ingot]]: This former temple of [[Ilmater]] later became the meeting hall for a group of wealthy Athkatlan-born merchants who banded together over the shared experience of losing a trade vessel at sea
* [[Seven Songs Importing]]: A business that specialized in exotic goods
* [[Silkstone Fashions]]: A tailor's shop that offered quite fashionable accessories
* [[Temple Bell]]: This shop specialized in the sale of religious texts, [[priest]]ly vestments, [[holy symbol]]s and other [[divine]] accessories

;[[Trades District]]:
Home to the great many independent merchants lived and operated out of Athkatla.

The [[Black Frog]] was the tavern of choice for local citizens

;[[Wave District]]:
A region of the city that housed a number of seafaring business such as cartographers, shipwrights and other nautical craftspeople. Due to its proximity to the [[Temple District (Athkatla)|Temple District]] it was home to a fair number of scribes and [[sage]]s.

Notable Locations:
* Great Griffin: This massive, seven-ton (6.5 Mg) bell was used to warn ships docking in the harbor during storms
* [[Moonhall]]: A well-recognized temple of [[Selûne]]

;Other Locations:
* [[Faded Ages]]
* [[Goldspires]]: An abbey dedicated to [[Waukeen]] and [[Lliira]]
* [[I Change]]
* [[Lowmarket]]
* [[Madroon's Curios]]
* [[Museum of Inquisition]]
* [[Odd Candy]]
* [[Tiny Deaths]]
* [[Arbalest's House]]: a [[monastery]] and the most significant [[temple]] to [[Milil]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

==History==
The city was founded around [[100 DR]] by the [[Shoon Imperium]] along with [[Murann]] and [[Crimmor]] with mostly [[Calimshan|Calishite]] immigrants, in what was then known as "the emirate of Amin". The Empire fell and in [[460 DR]], Amn became an independent nation with the city of [[Esmeltaran]] as its capital city (despite Athkatla being the oldest and most established city).

===Trade Wars===
Things got worse from [[1238 DR]] forward as every three or four decades saw a trade war erupt that would last for two or three years at a stretch. The worst one came in [[1333 DR]] when all trade in or out of Amn was stopped. A young merchant from Athkatla named [[Thayze Selemchant]] had just inherited a rich spice-importing business and the most affluent trading house in the city. He refused to allow this trade war to squash the wealth and power he would inevitably gain from his inheritance, so he personally went out and "persuaded" (using his intelligence, charisma, secret powers of magic and the third largest personal fortune in the country) five other Amnian merchant house leaders into forming a new government that wouldn't be so susceptible to these trade wars. The attempt succeeded and peace reigned once more (though only with a compact of mutual nonaggression with the [[Shadow Thieves]]). The new "Council of Six" was based in Athkatla and the city became Amn's new capital and busiest trade port on the [[Sword Coast]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the churches of [[Church of Lathander|Lathander]] and [[Church of Talos|Talos]] grew enough to be locked in a series of constant conflicts for the dominance in the city. Many Athkatlans believed that the rivalry was soon to erupt in open war.

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] as the last free port in Amn, Athkatla became the hub for nearly all the trade from [[Maztica]] although contact with Maztica ended when the entire continent was transported to [[Abeir]] during the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Tharlaskra]] of the Bells, a famed [[courtesan]] in 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and the inspiration for the popular ''[[She Rings Her Bells for Me]]'' ballad.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205715/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Apr – Jun 2006| accessdate = 28-10-2024| date = 28-10-2024}}
