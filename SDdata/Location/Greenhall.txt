'''Greenhall''' was an [[elf]] village within the enchanted [[Quivering Forest]] in the [[Moonsea]] region in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|18-20}}

The elves cautiously welcomed trade with members of the [[Emerald Enclave]], but rarely made themselves available for non-elves. They had a severe distrust of citizens of [[Phlan]], the dark [[fey]] of the forest, and the [[orc]] tribes from nearby [[Thar]].
