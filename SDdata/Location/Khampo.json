It was roughly a days ride from Thok.\nIn , Baron Phen Do of Khampo rebelled against the government of Tabot. In response, the worried Mag-chi Le-Khung (the military office) stationed three divisions in Khampo to contain the revolt. In , a tortoise-shell divination at UChan Gompa suggested burning rocks would fall on Khampo during Qwachein Goh celebrations they elected not to warn the city, as punishment for its rebellion. Despite this, that same year, in response to a Phutanese army assembling at the border, Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in Bidnop So, Darka, Thok, and Khampo. In short, it was not a good year for the people of Khampo.\n* Baron Phen Do, a rebellious aristocrat of Khampo"
