In response, the worried Mag-chi Le-Khung (the military office) stationed three divisions in Khampo to contain the revolt. In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, a tortoise-shell divination at [[U'Chan Gompa]] suggested burning rocks would fall on Khampo during Qwa'chein Goh celebrations; they elected not to warn the city, as punishment for its rebellion.<ref name=\"KT78\" > Despite this, that same year, in response to a [[Phutan]]ese army assembling at the border, Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in Bidnop So, [[Darka]], Thok, and Khampo. In short, it was not a good year for the people of Khampo.<ref name=\"KT77\" >",
