The '''Calishar Emirates''' was a vast expanse of land that made up the northern territories of the [[Calimshan Empire]].

==Geography==
The Emirates encompassed the various vassal realms and frontier regions of the Empire as it expanded north, including the [[Purple Marches]], [[Mir]], [[Tethyr]], [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]], [[Iltkazar]], [[Amin]], [[Meiritin]], [[Minsorran]], and the [[Ralamnish Ridings]], reaching as far north as the [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Greenfields]].

==History==
The Emirates came about from the wide-ranging conquests and settlement that the Calimshan Empire undertook in the Third Age ({{Yearlink|-1900}} to {{Yearlink|-900}}).

The vast region was ostensibly under Calimshan's control, but faced repeated internal uprisings and resistance from the many enemies that Calimshan had made over the centuries. Tethyrian human tribes and rebellious slaves, [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Shanatar]], [[elf|elves]] of [[Forest of Tethir|Tethir]], and [[drow]] raiders all picked away at the stability and control that Calimshan sought over its northern frontier.

In the {{YearlinkName|-375}}, a great plague struck the cities of Calimshan and caused a collapse of central authority. Although some generals and nobles maintained power, the Empire largely lost control of the Calishar Emirates. The native Tethyrians took to open and unified rebellion and managed to capture [[Zazesspur]] in {{Yearlink|-315}}, and the people and their lands were formally given independence in {{Yearlink|-288}}. After another attempt at reconquest between {{Yearlink|-230}} and {{Yearlink|-212}}, Tethyr was solidified as an independent and unified monarchy outside of Calishite control.

Tethyr effectively lost its independence after most of the royal family and many nobles were killed by rebels and pirates in the {{YearlinkName|-6}}, leading to the installation of [[Amahl Shoon I]] by Calimshan and the reclamation of much of the empire's lands via the [[Shoon Imperium]].

The Mad Mage [[Ilhundyl]] set about terrorizing the region in [[231 DR]], conquering the largest settlement in Meiritin and declaring himself the ruler of all the Emirates. His cruelty went largely unchecked due to internal unrest in the Imperium that delayed a response, and only ended in [[238 DR]] when he was slain by the aspiring [[wizard]] [[Elminster]] and his mistress [[Myrjala]].

The vassal kingdom of Valashar was founded in the Ralamnish Ridings in the {{YearlinkName|361}}{{Valashar dates}} by [[Ashar Tornamn]] of [[Tethyr]], who led a campaign of overly-ambitious expansionism that briefly extended the Emirates as far as the distant [[High Moor]]. This resulted in provoking a disastrous war with [[Cormyr]] in [[376 DR]] that led to his own execution, and the abandonment of Valashar until the later settlement of [[Cortryn]].

Around [[650 DR]], the city of [[Myth Drannor]] had a collection of rare and exotic plants in the [[Glim-Gardens]], including [[flame lily|flame lilies]] taken from the Calishar.
