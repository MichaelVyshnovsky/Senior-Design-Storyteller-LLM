The Allascar was a great valley in Turmish in the Vilhon Reach.
Lying in the southwestern reaches of Turmish, the Allascar cut westward into the great Orsraun Mountains.
On a side-trail a little way beyond the lip of the Allascar, on the steep slope down to the great Faraway forest, stood the isolated inn of The Five Lions.
