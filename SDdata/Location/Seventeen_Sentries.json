        "mainbody": "he Seventeen Sentries were a mysterious circle of standing stones in central Amn.\nThe Sentries were a circle of seventeen monolithic stones atop a small hill. The grass between them was always green, and travelers who slept within its bounds were never disturbed by wild animals and always received a refreshing nights sleep. Druids suggested that the stone circle was a holy site of Silvanus and other nature gods.\nThe Sentries lay on the south face of the Lake Way ridge, a days ride east from Purskul along the South Fork."
