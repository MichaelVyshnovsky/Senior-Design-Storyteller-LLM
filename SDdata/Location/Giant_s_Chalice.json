It was said to stretch from the southernmost tip of the Lake of Dragons, down to Asbravn, and then up to the Bridge of Fallen Men\nIn relation to the Lowerdark, it was located roughly north of Cairnheim.\nStone giants once dwelled above the Giants Chalice and some believed that dwarves from Shanatar dubbed the lake \"Giants Chalice\" because of this.\nIn 1357 DR, the lake would spend years fruitlessly trying to negotiate peace with their savage cousins, who often would feast upon them. Over time their population would greatly decline because of this.\nBy 1372 DR members of this race concluded that more active measures needed to be taken. They began honing their skills in combat and magic, while also appealing to their sea elf trading partners for aid in the conflict.\nCreatures in the Lowerdark were known to travel from miles away just to drink from this lake. Predatory creatures typically prowled around the lake for such prey.\nWithin its depths laid a glowing coral reef, whose light could be seen from above the water in some parts. These were tended to by blue ring octopuses, who some in 1372 DR estimated had been living there for over a millennium. They were known to carve this coral into intricate shapes and then trade them with sea elves traveling from the Sea of Fallen Stars through flooded passages. These sea elves often came from the kingdom of Naramyr and would resell them at the city of Myth Nantar."
