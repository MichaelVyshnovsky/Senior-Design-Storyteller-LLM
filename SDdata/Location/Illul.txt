'''Illul''' was a city on the island of [[Lantan]] in the [[Trackless Sea]].Text in the sourcebooks consistently refer to Illul as a city, though ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'' map marks all sites in Lantan as villages, presumably in error. It was the center of the faith of [[Gond]] the Wonderbringer in the Realms.

==Geography==
It stood on the southern shore of the island, facing the island of [[Suj]] over the channel called the [[Sambar Run]].

==Notable Locations==
The [[High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration]] in Illul was the center of the [[church of Gond]] in the Realms. It was a large walled monastery.

==Notable Inhabitants==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], the monastery was run by High Artificer [[Danactar]], Most Holy Servant of Gond. Danactar was the highest-ranking mortal [[cleric]] of the Lord of All Smiths.

The [[techsmith]]s of the church of Gond were based and trained in Illul at the High Holy Crafthouse.
