The Palace of the Simbul (or Simbuls Palace) was a palace in Velprintalar (now called Old Velprintalar) and the home of the Simbul, queen of Aglarond from 1320 DR to 1425 DR. The palace is constructed from green stone from Mulhorand and is situated on a hill that overlooked Velprintalar. It was protected by a host of magical measures. By 1479 DR, the palace was being used by the Simbarch Council. During the Simbuls reign, she was not present at the palace very often, but it was occupied by her servants, as well as the Foresters, coucillors and Yuir elves.
