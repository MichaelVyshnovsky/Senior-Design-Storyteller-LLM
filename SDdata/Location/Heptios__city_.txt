Heptios was a city-state in Chessenta in the 15 century DR. It stood on the Bay of Chessenta.
Previously a free city-state, Heptios was swept up in the unification of Chessenta in the decades after the Spellplague of 1385 DR. It was controlled by Luthcheq and the Karanok Dynasty by 1479 DR.
Following the Second Sundering in the 1480s DR, Heptios was once again an independent city-state.
It had a history of learning and commerce. By 1489 DR, it contained the largest library in Chessenta.
Heptios was disliked by the militant people of Akanax, who viewed its citizens as "fat philosophers".
