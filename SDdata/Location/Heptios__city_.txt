'''Heptios''' was a city-state in [[Chessenta]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It stood on the [[Bay of Chessenta]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|74}}

==History==
Previously a free city-state, Heptios was swept up in the unification of Chessenta in the decades after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]]. It was controlled by [[Luthcheq]] and the [[House Karanok|Karanok Dynasty]] by [[1479 DR]].

Following the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s [[DR]], Heptios was once again an independent city-state.

==Culture==
It had a history of learning and commerce. By [[1489 DR]], it contained the largest library in [[Chessenta]].

==Relations==
Heptios was disliked by the militant people of [[Akanax]], who viewed its citizens as "fat philosophers".
