        "mainbody": "Orthuls Notch was a sparsely-populated fishing hamlet on Cape Raeth to the southwest of the Cloakwood.\nOrthuls Notch was nestled in a small indent in Cape Raeths eastern side, facing Cloak Bay. By the 14 century DR, Orthuls Notch was a collection of single-store cottages reinforced with local wood and scavenged marine salvage. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in the Notch.\nThe few remaining inhabitants of Orthuls Notch survived through salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for crabs, silverfins, and laethe, a species of eel-like creatures.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Orthuls Notch, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14 century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster assaults."
