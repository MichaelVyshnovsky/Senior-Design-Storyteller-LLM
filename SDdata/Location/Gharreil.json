        "Government": "In its day, Gharreil was ruled by a satrap, who served the emperor of Jhothûn with the assistance of the [[princes of Jhothûn]], who were each qorrashi advisors.",
        "History": "Gharreil was one of the four major cities of the giant empire of [[Jhothûn]]<ref group=\"note\">It is suspected that Jhothûn was itself a part of the empire of [[Ostoria]], but this is never directly stated. and served as the capital of the eastern province of the [[Great Glacier]].\n\nGharreil fell because of conflicts between it and its sister provincial cities of [[Karffbadh]] and Choshein. [[White dragon]]s took advantage of the chaos and sped the downfall. The city decayed in stages. In the later phase, the populace erected a wall around the central core and left the outer city to fall to ruins.",
        "Rumors and legends": "It was suspected that the ruins might still hold ancient items of mystery or magic.",
        "Notable Locations": "The city of Gharreil contained a great amphitheater and a public pool. A promenade leading from the theater was composed of 24 columns, between pairs of columns on each side, twelve curtains of violet, heatless energy, six on each side, were permanently lit, as if by a ''[[continual flame]]'' spell. At the western end of this promenade was a portal to the capital city of [[Jhothûn (city)|Jhothûn]], which was still functioning perfectly even as late as [[1372 DR]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The city was once populated by giants, who were ancestors of the [[frost giant]]s. With the help of the qorrash, they developed great magics, even shaping the weather to remain cold to their liking.\n\nIn 1372 DR, a [[gelugon]], one of the [[Icy Claws]] of [[Iyraclea]], guarded the portal to Jhothûn found in the center of the city. His name was [[Tosvin]], and he was chosen by the last [[Prince of Jhothûn]]. Tosvin monitored the gateway to Gharreil's protective dome with a magical mirror he earlier found within the ruins."
