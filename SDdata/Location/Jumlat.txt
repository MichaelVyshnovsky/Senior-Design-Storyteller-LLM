'''Jumlat''', the '''City of Multitudes''', (together with [[Gana]]) gave the group of the [[Pearl Cities]] of [[west Zakhara]] their name.

==Geography==
Jumlat was located in the southeastern part of the Pearl Cities along the coastline where the [[Golden Gulf]] and [[Crowded Sea]] joined. It lay on the banks of [[al-Fatir River]].

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Jumlat's pearl divers.png|thumb|''Jumlat's [[pearl]] divers on the [[Golden Gulf]].'']]
Jumlat's population in [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} was 300,000, making it one of the largest cities throughout [[Zakhara]]. Outside harvest time, many inhabitants of this unprepossessing and crowded city turned to begging. Many citizens of Jumlat lived in poverty, indebted to the small percentage of wealthy merchants who controlled the pearl trade.

==Trade==
Jumlat's most important source of income was the harvest and trade of [[pearl]]s.

==Defenses==
Jumlat supported a city guard of 10,000 soldiers. The city also employed 1,000 cavalrymen hired from the [[High Desert]]. Jumlat's official navy numbered 30 ships, but another 10â€“30 ships of privateers and [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]] were hired to protect the pearl trade and harry rival Gana.

==Rumors & Legends==
A vicious sea monster was rumored to be the cause of missing ships from Jumlat. The Sultan offered a reward of 100,000 [[dinar]]s to someone who either killed the beast.
