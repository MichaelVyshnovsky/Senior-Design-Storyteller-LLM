Mirrindith the Last was the Twelfth City of the Sword of ancient Jhaamdath, located in the region of central Faerûn later known as the Vilhon Reach.
Mirrindith was established in the  as the final City of the Sword.
Jhaamdath entered into a short period of imperialistic expansion in the , which resulted in the deforestation of the Chondalwood and the slaughter of the Nikerymath elves. The elves responded in the , by casting a High Magic ritual that caused a huge wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the heartlands of Jhaamdath, from the Bay of Jhaamdath to distantly inland Tuoxent. The cities were drowned in the new Vilhon Reach, and Mirrindith became a sunken ruin imbued with stray psionic energy from its lost relics.
The sunken realm of Jhaamdath was suddenly revealed by lowered sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR, becoming the Vilhon Wilds. The situation was then returned to its previous state in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering.
