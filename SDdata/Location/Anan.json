        "Description": "Anan was the ruins of a former village. The soldiers of the shugo-daimyo were responsible for its complete destruction, burning it to the ground. Prior to this event, Anan was a small, peaceful farming village.",
        "History": "The catalyst for this devastation was an incident in {{yearlinkConvert|1425|KY}} involving the son of a local farmer. In a shocking turn of events, he committed a grave act by striking down and killing the [[jito]] of the [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']]. Following this act, he sought refuge in his parents' home. This decision was considered a severe transgression, particularly for a dutiful son. Compounding the situation, his parents, in a misguided act of protection, offered him shelter. This series of events ultimately led to the village's downfall, marking a tragic chapter in its history.\n\nWhen the officials of the shugo-daimyo arrived at the village, the farmer's parents falsely claimed ignorance of their son's whereabouts, a sentiment echoed by the rest of the village. However, upon searching the village, the authorities found the criminal.\n\nThe village faced severe repercussions for harboring and concealing the fugitive. In a drastic and brutal display of authority, the entire community was executed, and all the buildings were set ablaze. The lands previously tended by the villagers of Anan were reassigned to farmers from the nearby [[Kozakuran dictionary#M|''mura'']], and every official record pertaining to Anan was obliterated.\n\nThe desolate ruins of Anan now stood as a stark and grim reminder to all of the consequences of deviating from one's duty and the severe penalties for defying the authority of the shugo-daimyo. This tragic event served as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of loyalty and adherence to the law."
