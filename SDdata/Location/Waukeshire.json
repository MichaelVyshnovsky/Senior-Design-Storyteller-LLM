        "Description": "The trees of the Waukeshire stood straight and the undergrowth was kept trimmed, giving the forest a tidy appearance.\n\nThe tunnel complexes of the [[Warren]] were found beneath the forest, crossing under the [[Beaumaris River]] and connecting to the [[Warrenwood]].",
        "History": "During the occupation of Bloodstone Pass by allies of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] during the 1350s [[DR]], life continued much the same among the [[halfling]]s of Waukeshire, at least outwardly. in order to squirrel away their harvest and keep it safe from Zhengyi's bandits.",
        "Inhabitants": "The forest was home to most of the halfling population of [[Bloodstone Valley]]. Visitors and travelers were welcomed so long as they took care to avoid harming the foliage or littering, In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these halflings were governed by Mayor [[William (halfling)|William]] and their militia was led by the young [[Fredegast]]."
