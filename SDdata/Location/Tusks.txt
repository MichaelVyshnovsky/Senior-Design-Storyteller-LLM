'''The Tusks''' was the duo of islets that separated the [[Firedrake Bay]] and [[the Race]] in the [[Trackless Sea]], off the coast of [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
The two islands that collectively were called the Tusks were [[Iyritrastrul]] – the southern islet, and [[Borammur]] – the northern one. The so-called [[Gullet]] separated the two islands – perilous straight full of obtruding sea rocks. Bring one of the most dangerous areas of the [[Sword Coast]], and it was rarely navigated through unless the ship was guided by a knowledgeable masterful helmsman.

==Geography==
The Tusks were located to the south of the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]] and west of the Firedrake Bay, between the [[Starspire Peninsula|Starspire]] and [[Tethyr Peninsula]]s.

===Flora & Fauna===
The islands' main population were wild [[sheep]] that survived some ancient shipwrecks along the Gullet. However, there were rumors of a number of various shapeshifters inhabiting the Tusks.

The isle of Iyritrastrul had abundant [[shadowtop]]s, [[duskwood (tree)|duskwoods]], and [[blueleaf]] [[tree]]s.

==History==
The isle of Borammur once produced [[copper]] and held a small village that supported the mines. The entire settlement and the mines were overrun by mysterious "dark things of the depths" that slaughtered all the island's inhabitants. This took place many years before the late 14{{th}} century DR.

Various parties attempted to resettle Borammur and claim its rich copper deposits twice. But both lead to slaughter.
