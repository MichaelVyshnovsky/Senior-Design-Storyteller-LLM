'''Myshella''' was an ancient [[Netherese]] city that fell to attack during the last years of [[Netheril]]. It was buried and ruined by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], all that remained of Myshella was in a crevice underneath a hill in [[At'ar's Looking Glass]]. Most of the space was too full of sand to recover with any effectiveness.

==Defenses==
The defenses of the city were mostly magical. However, most of the walls were reinforced against all magic. Despite this precaution, a powerful ''lifedrain'' effect leaked out of the ruin, slowly killing anyone who wandered close to the crevasse even in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point, Myshella possessed a number of diviners. The [[phaerimm]] planned on sending a deadly weapon against Myshella to level the city; the diviners failed to foresee the phaerimm weapon was immune to all magic and bore a permanent ''[[lifedrain]]'' effect in its magic-immune heart. Thus, much of Myshella was ruined before one of its inhabitants, [[Garavan]], came up with the idea of building a nonmagical device, a ''[[Light Pump]]'', to fight back.

However, the ''Light Pump'' was still unused as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], in a room with a statue of [[Azuth]]. The Phaerimm weapon was neutralized by the sacrifice of six of the city's greatest mages. The section where the weapon was neutralized was a temple, later guarded by a [[greater mummy]] serving [[Ilmater]].

==Structures==
By the 14{{th}} century, not much remained beyond a temple, which held an archaic statue of [[Azuth]], despite the fact that his ascension post-dated the fall of Netheril. The temple still held some information, the corpse of a treasure-seeker, and some inexplicable curios, such as [[Earth|Rocky XXVI in laser-disc]] and four translations of the ''Necronomicon''. Those may have been a result of the city's forays into [[chronomancy]]. The ''lifedrain'' strengthened once inside the ruins, quickly draining the life out of anyone inside.

A few obstacles and traps, still functional, barred the way to an inner chamber with three doors forward. One of them led to a fiery trap, the other to an illusion of [[Dispater]] threatening death, and the last to a room with three tables set on it, all of them covered in a variety of [[yellow mold]] that resembled [[gold]]. A secret door required a special key to open the way to a guardian, a greater mummy and priest of Ilmater, who would fight only evil trespassers. The mummy would not explain the circumstances of the situation, but would allow people to pass to the final chamber.

In the final chamber, six of the mightiest mages of Myshella had sacrificed themselves in a ritual to stop a [[stone juggernaut]] which was the source of the lifedrain; the agents of Cormyr would also find the body of [[Sabkhat el Talab]] there. These mages were already impeding the ''lifedrain'' harshly; the slightest disturbance would render the area instantly uninhabitable, slaying everyone in the temple within minutes.

==Rumors & Legends==
Per a nearby serpent lord, Myshella dedicated itself to "cutting-edge magical research". The city was extant in the times of said serpent lord's grand-sire.{{Cite Polyhedron UK/1/Just Deserts|10-12,15}}
