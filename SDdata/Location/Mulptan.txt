'''Mulptan''' was the great trade city of [[Rashemen]]. It was one of the nation's more cosmopolitan locales and was considered the "Gateway" to the lands of [[northeast Faerûn|the north]].

==Description==
The vast, wind-battered city was encircled by a great stone wall, outside of which was its great trading field. The tents and and stalls found in mercantile marketplace were crowded with people of many different ethnicities and foreign nations.

==Geography==
Mulptan lay on the intersection of the [[Huhrong's Road]] and a long road that ran north-south through Rashemen. It was located {{SI|80|mi|k}} east of [[Immilmar]], about five days south of the [[Falls of Erech]], and three days east of the [[Ring of Blue Fire]], as traveled by horseback.

==Trade==
Mulptan's great trading fields drew foreign merchants and businesspeople from many nearby nations, including [[Damara]] and [[Impiltur]].

Many traders came to Mulptan from  the [[Long Road (Northeast Faerûn)|Long Road]], a route that crossed the [[Endless Wastes]] from the [[Cold Lands]] and connected to Huhrong's Road.

==History==
The infrastructure of Mulptan predated the city itself, dating back to the ancient conflicts between [[Narfell]] and [[Raumathar]].

==Notable Locations==
* Western Quarter, a region of Mulptan inhabited predominantly by folk from Damara or [[Thesk]]. Ironically it was located on the northeastern side of the city.
* Shou Quarter, the southern district of the city that presumably housed many [[Shou]] people.

==Inhabitants==
Mulptan was home to the [[Ydrass]] and [[Vrul]] Rashemaar clans, each of whom enjoyed an old and sometimes bloody rivalry with the other.
