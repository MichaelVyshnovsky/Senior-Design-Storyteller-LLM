'''Liontongue''' was a hamlet founded by [[Nerren Prentiyuel]] during his tenure as the [[Magister]], in {{yearlink|667}}. It was depopulated in {{yearlink|669}}.

==History==
[[Nerren Prentiyuel]] founded Liontongue because he hated traveling but still intended to discharge the duties of the [[Magister]]; it was a hamlet of his students when he first created it. It eventually became a village; however, after his death in {{yearlink|669}}, his students became emboldened by the spells they had learned and slew each other in spell duels; the survivors split between those who fled and those who were slain by brigands. Little but founding stones remained thirty years later, in {{yearlink|699}}.
