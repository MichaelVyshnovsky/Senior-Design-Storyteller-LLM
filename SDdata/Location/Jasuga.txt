'''Jasuka''' was the capital of the [[Jasuga Province|province of the same name]] in [[Wa]] and the second-largest city on the [[Fochu Peninsula]]. It was a city that most of the nation of Wa found unimportant and ignored. However, it was notable for the sport of wrestling.

==Description==
Jasuga was the largest city in its province, but the province itself was Wa's most desolate; the soil was very sandy, which made farming difficult, and it produced very few resources. The citizens of Jasuga survived by the trades of fishing and weaving.

Like many cities of Wa, Jasuga was not welcoming to strangers in its gates, and its people were highly religious.

==Geography==
Jasuga was located on the west coast of the island of [[Tsukishima]], in the northern portion of the Fochu Peninsula and at the end of the [[Hisano Road]] from [[Fochu]]. The city sat on the [[Nanaichi River]]. East of the city was the [[Jufosu Range]]. A [[Sukyo Trail|trail]] led north to the village of [[Sukyo]].

==Government==
The [[daimyo]] of the city in [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]] was [[Nobu Subari]]. He was not a very successful daimyo, but he was made a noble to fulfill a promise made to his mother by the [[shogun]]. He was an avid athletics fan who promoted the sport of wrestling in his city.

==Defenses==
Jasuga maintained a small militia composed primarily of [[bushi]]. The city itself was surrounded by a {{SIAdj|50|feet|adj=high}} stone wall with guards posted on the wall every {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}}. The guards on the walls were armed with [[chu-ko-nu]] and leaf-headed arrows and wore whistles around their necks with which to summon reinforcements. Guards on foot were armed with [[katana]]s.

==Trade==
The city had a suitable amount of trade with other cities of Wa, and just about anything found in other [[Kara-Tur]]an cities could also be found there, sold mainly from a central market, but these goods tended to cost about double what they would in other places.

To enter the city required the proving of one's faith and the purchase of a visitor's pass at a cost of 1 [[yuan]] per person.

==History==
Jasuga hosted an annual wrestling competition, but the citizens trained for the sport throughout the whole year.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Koi Temple]]
* [[Kowa Arena]]
* [[Rai Inn]]
* [[Sen Inn]]
* [[Sugi Inn]]

==Inhabitants==
* [[Hiroyasu Ohta]], a master craftsman of katana blades.
