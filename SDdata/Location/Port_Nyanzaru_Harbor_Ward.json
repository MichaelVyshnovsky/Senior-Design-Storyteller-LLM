        "mainbody": "The '''Harbor Ward''' of [[Port Nyanzaru]] housed the majority of city's docks, including those used by its [[Merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]]. It was a busy place where ships were loaded and unloaded, allowing for goods to flow in and out of the port.",
        "Location": "The Harbor Ward lay along the harbor on the northside of the city. The Ward sat between the [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]] to the west and the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] to the east.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|5}} A network of caves, said to contain an old temple to [[Umberlee]], lay beneath the streets of the ward.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|30}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Port Nyanzaru harbor.jpg|thumb|350px|''A view of the harbor.'']]\nThe harbor itself was built to be highly defensible against pirates, and featured a defensive chain that could be raised to block entrance or exit to the harbor. The harbor's [[Lighthouse (Port Nyanzaru)|lighthouse]] that could be used to send smoke signals which could be seen all across the [[Bay of Chult]].\n\nThe Dock Ward bustled with [[dinosaur]]s and dockhands ready to help load and unload ships, notably with the aid of dinosaur-powered [[crane]]s,While the map of Port Nyzanzaru provided with the ''[[Tomb of Annihilation]]'' adventure places the Royal Docks on the western end of the Harbor Ward, they are described in the text as being on the eastern end. Between the Royal Docks and the public docks was a drydock and the [[Port Nyanzaru/Warehouse District|Warehouse District]].\n\nDuring heavy rains, runoff from the ravine of [[Malar's Throat]] would stream into the city and empty into the harbor, often carrying with it [[basket]]s, dead animals, and sometimes an unlucky person.",

        "Inhabitants": "The docks were often filled with incoming visitors and treasure hunters seeking guides, as well as [[thieves]] and con artists looking to take advantage of them. On occasion, when brigands or mercenaries put into port, the docks could also become a dangerous place.{{Cite dragon+/16/Fiction: Qawasha & Kupalu√© Part Two}}\n\nThe Chultan [[druid]] and guide [[Qawasha]] would sometimes spend his Summer days at the docks, greeting visitors and providing a trustworthy welcome to Chult."
