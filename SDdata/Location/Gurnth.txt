'''Gurnth''' was a village located deep within the [[Gulthmere Forest]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] inhabited by [[human]]

==Description==
The village was home to a group of almost-feral Nobanion-cultists who spent their time "living the life of cats" and following the "survival of the fittest" creed. This community virtually used no curatives, healing ointments, nor medicinal [[herbs]], leaving their sick and old to die where they lay.

==Geography==
Located near the village was the [[Machran Spire]], a large [[granite]] outcropping that was revered by the faithful of Nobanion.

==Culture==
Inhabitants of Gurnth, like other Nobanionites, had two celebrations every year, three and a half months apart. In the first week of [[Ches]], they celebrated the [[Festival of the Pride]] during which Nobanionites partook in revelry and mating. The [[Newborn Celebration]] followed, taking place in the third week of [[Kythorn]]. The festival represented the rebirth of their deity and was timed with the gestation period of a [[lion]].

==Inhabitants==
The human Nobanion-cultists were associated with [[lammasu]] and [[greater lammasu]] who resided on the [[Machran Spire]] through most of the year. It was believed that many of the [[cleric]]s of Nobanion in Gurnth were [[werelion]]s.
