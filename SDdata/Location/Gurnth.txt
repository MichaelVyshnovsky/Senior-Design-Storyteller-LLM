Gurnth was a village located deep within the Gulthmere Forest in the Vilhon Reach inhabited by human
The village was home to a group of almost-feral Nobanion-cultists who spent their time "living the life of cats" and following the "survival of the fittest" creed. This community virtually used no curatives, healing ointments, nor medicinal herbs, leaving their sick and old to die where they lay.
Located near the village was the Machran Spire, a large granite outcropping that was revered by the faithful of Nobanion.
Inhabitants of Gurnth, like other Nobanionites, had two celebrations every year, three and a half months apart. In the first week of Ches, they celebrated the Festival of the Pride during which Nobanionites partook in revelry and mating. The Newborn Celebration followed, taking place in the third week of Kythorn. The festival represented the rebirth of their deity and was timed with the gestation period of a lion.
The human Nobanion-cultists were associated with lammasu and greater lammasu who resided on the Machran Spire through most of the year. It was believed that many of the clerics of Nobanion in Gurnth were werelions.
