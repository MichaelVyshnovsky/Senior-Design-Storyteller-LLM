        "mainbody": "'''Telflamm''' was usually considered to be the biggest and most important port city in [[Thesk]]; however, Telflamm was actually an independent city-state with subject-cities of [[Nyth]] and [[Culmaster]] under its control. Telflamm wielded so much power and influence over the country of Thesk that it might as well have been the capital.",
        "Description": "Telflamm was a walled city with skyline dotted with numerous temples and civic buildings, all constructed in a distinct [[onion]]-shape.\n\n[[Shemszarr Square]] was at the center of the city's commerce. Many of its merchants and trading company headquarters were located around the square, including the [[Thayan Enclave (Telflamm)|Thayan Enclave]]. Shemszarr Square stood just to the north from the [[Temple of Waukeen (Telflamm)|Temple of Waukeen]] and Castle Balindre, which was perched high on a cliff above the waters of [[Heskel Cove]]. The square was separated from the Castle by the Old Gate. To the east from Shemszarr Square stood [[House of the Master's Shadow (Telflamm)|the House of the Master's Shadow]], a temple of [[Mask]].\n\n[[Heskel River]] flowed into Heskel Cove. At least two bridges were strewn across it, towards the [[Merchants' Fortress]] on the river's saunter bank. Even further south from Heskel River stood the [[Temple of Shaundakul (Telflamm)|Temple of Shaundakul]].\n\nThe [[Shou Town (Telflamm)|Shou Town]] was Telflamm's poorer quarter, situated on the outskirts of the city's southern border, behind a wall.{{cite book/Stardeep|41|4}} The Shou Town was decidedly more eastern in nature. The architecture was distinctly [[Kara-Tur]]an, the businesses and the people were mostly [[Shou]]. The quarter was built by merchants, immigrants, and refugees from the eastern realms. Few major merchants could be found here, and most residents lacked wealth and luster but compensated for it in kindness. The only exception was the yakuza gang of the [[Nine Golden Swords]].",
        "Geography": "[[File:Telflamm.png|thumb|''The city of Telflamm on the shores of [[Easting Reach]].''|351x351px]]\nTelflamm stood on the eastern shores of the [[Easting Reach]] of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], to the north of the [[Aglarond peninsula]], Its most important feature was being on the terminus point for the prosperous [[Golden Way]] that ran further east.",
        "Government": {
            "Laws": "Telflamm collected tariffs from goods being moving along the Golden Way. However, Telflamm did not amass significant wealth from tithes and tariffs despite abundant trade. Lax laws and common pirating raids contributed to the lack of wealth, especially when compared to cities of the [[North Faerûn]].\n\nEven during the pirate reign, piracy was illegal in Telflamm and punishable by death. Smuggling charges led to hefty fines and confiscation. These laws were a mere technicality as many of the pirates were allowed to act as \"importers of rare goods\" by the city's Merchant Princes and the council."
        },
        "Trade": "Trade was the most important aspect of life in Telflamm. Its busy port was a bottleneck for all trade that moved to and from the east. and works of art passed through Telflamm to reach the rest of Faerûn. Telflamm acted as a duty-free seaport for neighboring Thesk's relationships with trade allies.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210803164924/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed 2006| accessdate = 5-3-2022| date = 2006}}\n\nTelflamm maintained friendly relationship with its neighboring [[Impiltur]]. Despite historic hostilities and trade rivalry, Telflamm and Thesk remained on good terms and jointly guarded the prosperous [[Golden Way]]. Telflamm also supported [[Aglarond]] and Thesk against the nation of [[Thay]].\n\nApart from trade, Telflamm's harbors were a major travel port for adventurers seeking fame and wealth in the Eastern Realms. Telflamm (or, to be more precise, Shadowmasters of Telflamm) made coin on outfitting thrill-seekers with treasure maps of [[Raumathar]] and [[Narfell]]. These maps varied in accuracy and often led to long-looted sites.",
        "Culture": "The cultural influences of Shou Lung were obvious in the city. One of the best [[tea]]s in all Thesk was Telflamm's West Lake Dragon Well, or Long Jing. Visitors to the city's Shou Town could experience a slice of Kara-Turan life. The area had eastern architecture and was home to many Kara-Turan and Shou eateries, inns, and taverns.\n\nAmong many languages spoken in Telflamm was a [[human]] dialect – [[Larach]], of the old [[Great Dale]], notable for its sonic resemblance to the Scottish Gaelic of the world known as [[Earth]]. By the 15{{th}} century, the dialect was largely forgotten, apart from a few phrases. Larach's influences could be attributed to [[gnome]] and [[halfling]] dialects of the [[Inner Sea]] east due to some similarities in sound.",
        "Defenses": "Telflamm commanded an army of mercenaries that were dispatched to patrol the city, its satellites, and the Golden Way. During the time of war, Telflamm kept its army within its territory and hired additional mercenaries to send to Thesk's aid. After the war, Telflamm had little heavy defenses, no [[siege engine]]s, nor harbor chains.\n\nThe city watch of Telflamm was outfitted with the uniform of long red overcoats, tied around the waist with shiny black [[sash]]es. The guards' heads were adorned with high black square hats tassled in silver. Their [[boot]]s were made of black [[leather]] and ended in [[silver]] toecaps. The weapons carried by the watch were curved [[broadsword]]s. The watch was stationed in [[Castle Balindre]], close to the city's rulers.",
        "History": "[[File:Thesk 4e.png|thumb|''A post-[[Spellplague]] map of Telflamm, [[Thesk]], and a part of the [[Golden Way]].''|351x351px]]\nTelflamm was settled in the {{YearlinkName|926}} by [[Windyn Balindre]], who moved his base of operations from [[Impiltur]] to this newly-built settlement and declared himself 'Merchant Prince', a hereditary title. House Balindr's own company, [[Royal Company of Shou Lung]], established most of the Golden Way. Situated at the start of that incredibly profitable trade way, Telflamm quickly became the biggest trading station in the region, with most trade concerning the products of Kara-Tur which was in wide demand across Faerûn.\n\nTelflamm was later established as a royal city-state in the {{YearlinkName|975}}, after annexing cities of [[Nyth]] and [[Culmaster]]. This birthed the nation of Telflamm.\n\nThe thieves' guild of Telflamm was established in the {{YearlinkName|927}}, later to become the infamous [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm]]. In the subsequent years, the guild's influence was so great to prevent the Hierarch of Telflamm from officially joining the nation of Thesk. The Hierarch was convinced by the guild that Telflamm was snubbed by the leaders of [[Phsalt]] and [[Milvarune]], electing to remain independent and kept its satellite cities of Culmaster and Nyth.\n\nAround the 900s DR, [[Graldor|Graldor \"One-Hand\"]], the leader of the adventuring [[Company of the Collar]], entered the city of Telflamm. He proceeded through the streets of the city, weeping and carrying the body of his lover, swordmaid [[Evlanna]]. The mourning adventurer entered the [[Tower of Tempus]] begging for Evlanna's ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]''. Graldor paid for the service with his unique blade – ''[[Galathos]]'' that was believed to have been lost for over two centuries. The story of the weeping adventurer and his lover became a well-known tale among inhabitants of Telflamm.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1177}}, Telflamm announced its independence after Princess [[Delile Balindre]] renounced loyalty to the one-time ally nation of [[Impiltur]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1294}}, Telflamm's throne belonged to Prince [[Thaum Balindre]], son of [[Kuskur Balindre]]. His main contribution to the history books was the assassination of his uncle–[[Lashilmbrar|Lashilmbrar “the Sly”]], son of [[Imphras II]].\n\nA grand temple heist, letter known as the [[Night of the Fontshuffle]], happened in the {{YearlinkName|1343}}. [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm|Shadowmasters]] were expanding their influence and demanded more protection money from the temples of Telflamm. Those who refused found collections of holy relics and divine magic items strewn across each other temples as a show of force and intimidation tactics. The Night of the Fontshuffle was enough to convince all temples of the city-state to pay.\n\nThe {{YearlinkName|1351}} welcomed the Red Wizards of Thay into the city-state. The enclave rapidly grew and became the biggest distribution center for Thayan magical goods across the northern Faerûn.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, a new High Priest of the Tower of Tempus, the High Priest and Champion Rampant of Tempus [[Taeron]], took office and promptly refused to pay the Shadowmasters' protection racket. In retaliation, Shadowmasters pulled a daring heist and claimed several magic items: two [[enchanted]] [[sword]]s, (including ''Galathos''), a ''[[helm of brilliance]]'', and the ''[[Red Book of War]]'', a priceless relic of the [[Tempuran]] faith. These items sparked internal struggle within the thieves' guild, which resulted in several members' deaths. Soon after, Tempuran clergy reclaimed the stolen magic items; however, the ''Red Book'' was lost, thought to have been taken somewhere far away from Telflamm. ''Galathos'' was believed to have been recovered as well, whoever, in truth, it was still being actively searched for as of the late-14{{th}} century DR.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1360}} Telflamm became an integral part of the war between the invading [[Tuigan Horde]] and the united armies of [[Faerûn]] under the command of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]. The free city of Telflamm initially served as a rendezvous point for Azoun's [[Cormyr]]ean ships and some of the Alliance armies. From there, King Azoun planned to move north and join with troops of King [[Torg mac Cei]] of [[Earthfast]] and temporary allies – [[Zhentil Keep]]. The harbors of Telflamm took on around two hundred ships of the Alliance and supplied them with [[horse]]s, livestock, mobile forges, and other general supplies. The invasion forced many unlikely and shaky alliances, including one between Telflamm and [[Tammar]]. Azoun Obarskyr's Alliance forced returned to the city-state of Telflamm after strengthening its ally numbers, of [[orc]]s, dwarves, and humans of various nations. By that time, refugees flooded the city as the Tuigan Horde approached Thesk, looming only 500 miles to the east. The influx of refugees brought out Telflamm's vice, corruption, thievery, and crime were on the rise, black markets exploited the need for food and cloth, and even started dealing in human lives. Makeshift coliseums and brothels sprung through Telflammm, leaving the city guard undermanned and prone to bribery and corruption. The Alliance army took Telflamm's government offices as a temporary headquarters. With armies of the Alliance assembled, King Azoun's forces moved east to face [[Yamun Khahan]]'s Tuigan Horde. The Crusades resulted in Tuigan defeat; however the war left Telflamm overflowing with refugees, and its security weakened for years that followed. The Tuigan invasion left Thesk a ruined and desolate land as their armies moved along the Golden Way.\n\nAnother fallout from the Tuigan war was the Pirates of the Fallen Stars, who seized on Telflamm's weakness. The pirates knew the city had no naval power and rolled in to create a safe haven for themselves. In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Telflamm meekly welcomed the pirates of the [[Sharkjaws]] flotilla under [[Evgruth the Red]]'s command and the significant wealth they brought along.\n\nThe Shadowmasters' ambitions' next target were the orc marauders who stayed behind after the Tuigan war. The guild offered a bounty on the heads of any orcs roaming Thesk. Soon, the security was bought back to the Golden Way. In a similar manner, Shadowmasters exerted pressure on the Merchant Prince and the council, displacing refugees away from Telflamm via a promise of land. The refugees were promised that any land they were to build a home on and live on for a year would become their property.\n\nOn [[Midwinter]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a strange ice storm raged along the eastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The foul weather has awoken many [[ghost]]s and [[sea zombie]]s of dead pirates who attacked the city-state of Telflamm. The [[Church of Tempus]] successfully drove the undead horde back into the sea.\n\nThe last Balindre Prince died some time during or after the ''[[Spellplague]]'', leaving the Merchants' Council in charge of the government, but the [[Shadowmasters]] remained the true power in the city.\n\nAt some point before the [[Second Sundering]], a notorious [[Turami]] pirate [[Anton Marivaldi]], pulled a daring plundering of priceless [[spice]] fleet from the city-state of Telflamm. Some called this act \"mad\".",
