Yeshpek was a large fortified city in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn.
Yeshpek was referred to by some as the City of Chains, due to its primary export. As for its proper name, a number of commentators and mapmakers in the lands north of Land of the Lions were known to misspell it on several occasions as Yeslipek. This was due to the citys name appearing blurry on a primary source map from the Fifth Age of Calimshan.
This city was situated to the northwest of Tulmon, along the Narrows Trail. From its place along the Lake of Steam, Yeshpek dominated the natural harbor of Bezrim Bay.
Yeshpek was a center of trade of fishing. of different sizes and strengths, as well as locks. It was also known for trading of crabs and clams. Beyond that, its populace crafted a variety of small everyday goods, such as belts, carry-coffers, jugs, and sharpening steels.
