        "mainbody": "Settlement\nSister of Rains was a canyon-oasis found in the desert of Anauroch in North Faer√ªn. The settlement was a refuge for those Bedine who were outcast from their tribes, such as witches, wizards and other spellcasters.\nThe oasis was located in the region of Anauroch known as the Sword, at the base of the eastern slopes of the Wall of the Fallen Djinn mountain range, west of the desolate expanse known as the Shoal of Thirst. Due to this precarious location, the settlement of outcasts was well-isolated from the other settlements of the Bedine tribes.\nThe Sister of Rains was nestled in a steep-walled canyon, accessible by a narrow gulch that was dotted with plant life. Freshwater springs poured out the canyons walls on its southern side, forming the pools from which the oasis took its name.\nA natural grove arose from the Sisters pools of water, one that included scores of fig trees.\nAs of the , the Sister of Rains was still the home of magic-wielding outcasts who had been exiled or otherwise abandoned by the Bedine people. By the , the oasis was abandoned,\nThe only notable landmark within the Sister of Rains was a ruined tower, that was built long before the Era of Upheaval by a tribe of Bedine that did not survive to that era."
