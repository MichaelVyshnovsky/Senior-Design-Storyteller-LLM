        "mainbody": "'''Three Swords''' was a fortified town on the upper side of the [[Landrise]] in the [[Eastern Shaar]], ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. It was destroyed as a result of the [[Spellplague]] in the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]].",
        "Geography": "Three Swords was located on the [[Trader's Way]] between [[Channathgate]] and [[Eartheart]] where the road scaled the [[Landrise]]. It was approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of Channathgate and 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Eartheart.",
        "Trade": "Three Swords did brisk business with [[Khôltar]] which was hungry for food and drink, especially the potent spirit [[amberfire]] that originated in Three Swords.",
        "Defenses": "The town was surrounded by walls and benefited from regular patrols of the Trader's Way and the Landrise by the [[Steel Shields]] from Eartheart.",
        "History": "Around this time, the road to Channathgate was the stalking ground of [[Tandith Tornears]] and his band of brigands. The stretch of the Trader's Way that grazed the [[Forest of Amtar]] was particularly susceptible to ambushes from the trees. Forces from Three Swords hunted for the bandits for many years but never caught them. The authorities of Three Swords asked the [[dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]] for assistance, reasoning that a substantial portion of their imports and exports traveled along that road."
