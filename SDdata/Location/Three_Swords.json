        "mainbody": "Three Swords was a fortified town on the upper side of the Landrise in the Eastern Shaar, circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR. It was destroyed as a result of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR.\nThree Swords was located on the Traders Way between Channathgate and Eartheart where the road scaled the Landrise. It was approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) east of Channathgate and 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Eartheart.\nThree Swords did brisk business with Kh√¥ltar which was hungry for food and drink, especially the potent spirit amberfire that originated in Three Swords.\nThe town was surrounded by walls and benefited from regular patrols of the Traders Way and the Landrise by the Steel Shields from Eartheart.\nAround this time, the road to Channathgate was the stalking ground of Tandith Tornears and his band of brigands. The stretch of the Traders Way that grazed the Forest of Amtar was particularly susceptible to ambushes from the trees. Forces from Three Swords hunted for the bandits for many years but never caught them. The authorities of Three Swords asked the dwarves of the Great Rift for assistance, reasoning that a substantial portion of their imports and exports traveled along that road."
