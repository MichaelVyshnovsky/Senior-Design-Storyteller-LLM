Beyond it lay the wilderness of al-Suqut Mountains.\nLocated along the western coast of the Crowded Sea along the banks of Al-Malja River, Ajayib was both the southernmost and westernmost of the major Pearl Cities.\nThe source of Ajayibs wealth was cultivated on the steep hills which rose above the city. Though famous for their splendid coffee, Ajayib also exported fruits, frankincense, and other aromatic gums. The productions of bright dyes was also a major portion of their trade dealings. \nAjayib was the youngest of the great Pearl Cities, having only established an enlightened mosque in 1357 DR.\nNatives of Ajayib were proud to live on the frontier. They were generally independent, strong-willed, and opinionated.\nHalima al-Wahsi was the Calipha of Ajayib in 1367 DR.\nThe city guard of Ajayib numbered 8,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry. The Calipha personally commanded an elite unit of farisan that numbered 300 soldiers. Ajayibs navy numbered six ships used to combat pirates and western raiders. \nIt was rumored that Ajayib was built upon the foundation of a much older city. The ancient settlement was supposedly carved into the cliffs shadowing Ajayib. A series of caves could be found in these cliffs, and though they were looted generations ago, many believed that Ajayibs savage ancestors still prowled the dark caverns."
