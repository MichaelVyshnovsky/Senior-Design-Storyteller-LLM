        "mainbody": "he Sunglade was a clearing wherein ancient standing stones still stood in the Yuirwood. The circle of standing stones in the Sunglade was the oldest circle in the Yuirwood.\nThis was a sunny, pleasant glade well within the Yuirwood, guarded by ancient willows and inhabited only by songbirds and butterflies. Within the center of the Sunglade was a large circle of stone menhirs with a second, smaller circle of ten menhirs in its center. Both sets of menhirs were covered in elaborate zoomorphic images and ancient Espruar runes. Both sets were magically warded against age, so they seemed almost new. Each menhir of the outer circle was dedicated to a different member of the Seldarine, while each of the inner ten was dedicated to a deity of the Yuir pantheon.\nThe Sunglade was located in the interior uplands of the Yuirwood.\nThe menhirs of the Sunglade were erected by the Yuir elves before they abandoned the place, but their enemies—trolls and drow—could not destroy the place, as those who tried died or disappeared.\nAs of 1368 DR, the explorer Talyssa Strongbow still felt a presence there of some sort, reportedly both distant, ancient, and hostile and around the same time some half-elven tribes of the Yuirwood had begun returning to the circle to worship the ancient gods honored there."
