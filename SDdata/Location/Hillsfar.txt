'''Hillsfar''' was a powerful city-state located on the southern coast of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]]. The city was heavily involved in trade in the region, acting as a hub for cities and settlements in the surrounding area. A person from Hillsfar was known as a Hillfarian.

==Government==
===Laws===
In the late 14th century [[DR]], the city of Hillsfar was ruled by the iron fist of the [[wizard]] [[Maalthiir]] and there were two standing "great laws":
* Great Law of Trade: Do not interfere with any legitimate trade;
* Great Law of Humanity: Only [[human]]s are allowed within Hillsfar.

By the late 15th century DR, the city was ruled by a senate of thirty-one wealthy merchants and guildmasters. However, since the senate could rarely agree on anything, actual rule of the city fell to the First Lord [[Torin Nomerthal]].

==Defense==
[[File:Red Plume of Hillsfar.jpg|thumb|right|A Red Plume of Hillsfar.]]

{{Main|Red Plumes}}
Although Hillsfar was a walled city, fortified with a steel gate, it was the military force of the [[Red Plumes]] who ensured the city's security from foreign forces in the 14th century DR. Although they technically operated autonomously, they were in fact another extension of Maalthiir's reach.

In the 15th century DR, the military was known as the Tower Guard and was supplemented by a powerful mages guild.

==Trade==
Although trade in the Moonsea was typically carried out through rivalries and competition, almost all the goods of the region passed through Hillsfar in the hands of middlemen and intermediary merchants. The city was once a port where stolen and illicit goods were traded (despite Hillsfar having a law that stated piracy was punishable by hanging), but this was no longer the case by [[1359 DR]].<ref> Hillsfar was a known exporter of velvet.<ref>

==History==
[[File:Hillsfar.jpg|thumb|''Mid-to-late 14{{th}} century Hillsfar.'']]
The settlement was founded in the {{YearlinkName|673}} by [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[human]]s on the western edge of [[Tailings Bay]]. It was originally named Hillsafar after a [[Clan Hillsafar|dwarven clan]], but within a few decades, the name was simplified to Hillsfar.<ref> The city was founded for three reasons: to trade with the [[dwarf|dwarven]] settlers who had emigrated out of [[Myth Drannor]] the previous year to the [[Scarp]] at Tailings Bay; to keep [[drow]] out of the region; and to maintain a watch over [[Tsornyl|Moander's Crypt]].<ref> The city was ruled over by council of men and half-elves, as well as representatives of the [[Elven Court]], giving the Elven Court a measure of control over Hillsfar.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, Hillsfar fought and defeated [[Mulmaster]] in the [[Moonsea War]] alongside [[Melvaunt]], [[Phlan]], [[Sembia]] and [[Zhentil Keep]].<ref>

In [[Calendar of Harptos|Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, during the [[Flight of dragons]] that afflicted the region, the largest dragon of the flight attacked Hillsfar and, although slain by the city's defenders, fell into Hillsfar's harbor, blocking it from approaching ships until the corpse could be destroyed.<ref><ref> A month later, in Flamerule, Hillsfar joined the military alliance of [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], [[Sembia]], and Zhentil Keep to oppose the forces of [[Lashan Aumersair]].<ref>

In [[1357 DR]] Maalthiir overthrew the city's ruling council using blackmail and fear of violence. He then declared himself the First Lord, a position with absolute military power, which he retained through the violent mercenary group known as the Red Plumes. Extending his own xenophobic tendencies, Maalthiir then banned all non-humans from the city.

In [[1360 DR]], Hillsfar was involved in the Cormyr-led military alliance to defeat the invading [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]],<ref> though they ended up only sending 600 men, mostly Red Plumes, to actually take part in the fighting.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' emerged in Hillsfar's harbor, starting to aggressively consume lives of the city's residents. The ''spawn pool'' originated from the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]] where it was corrupted and abused by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. [[Kya Mordrayn]]'s cult cell spread tentacles of her corrupted ''pool'', feeding it in cities across the [[Moonsea]], empowering it. Subsequently the Cult's plans were shattered and its leaders slain by the [[Veiled Ones]]. With the main ''pool of radiance'' gone, Hillsfar was saved.

The following summer, a secret alliance was exposed between Maalthiir and the Sembian government when Sembia was found to be propping up Hillsfar's independence from [[Zhentil Keep]].<ref>

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a new periodical publication called ''[[Beldrouk's Bright Banners]]'' appeared in Hillsfar, quickly becoming favorite for its blunt political commentaries that voiced off against the Red Plumes and Hillsfar's cruel leadership. The paper's anonymous contributors were announced wanted criminals by Hillsfar but even the publisher and printer remained unknown.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151030080255/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_101112-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Oct â€“ Dec 2006| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}
