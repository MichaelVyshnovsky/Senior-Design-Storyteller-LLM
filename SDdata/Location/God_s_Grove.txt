The Gods Grove was a shrine to Silvanus in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr.
The Gods Grove was a stand of duskwood trees that lay just north of the Way of the Manticore, and marked the eastern edge of Wheloon. A nearby cabin was Orlenstars home. It was a very picturesque location.
The Gods Grove had a long history in Wheloon, older even than the Wyvern Ferry Route.
By 1358 DR, its caretaker was Orlenstar Thirlthorn, He held the position through 1367 DR and 1369 DR. He was still caretaker by 1374 DR.
In addition to the worship of Silvanus, the Gods Grove had a variety of uses, and every Whelunian knew where it was. It was a popular spot for picnics and weddings, and children were always welcome to play there. People also took injured and sick animals to Orlenstar for his ministration. Orlenstar also kept a constant store of healing goodberries, as well as his homebrew spruce beer.
Although Orlenstar was officially caretaker of the shrine and grove, many Whelunians also pitched in to maintain and beautify the site, since it was so important to them.
