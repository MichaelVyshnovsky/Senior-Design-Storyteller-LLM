The '''God's Grove''' was a [[shrine]] to [[Silvanus]] in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
The God's Grove was a stand of [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] trees that lay just north of the [[Way of the Manticore]], and marked the eastern edge of Wheloon. A nearby cabin was Orlenstar's home. It was a very picturesque location.

==History==
The God's Grove had a long history in Wheloon, older even than the [[Wyvern Ferry Route]].

By [[1358 DR]], its caretaker was [[Orlenstar Thirlthorn]], He held the position through [[1367 DR]] and 1369 DR. He was still caretaker by [[1374 DR]].

==Services==
In addition to the worship of Silvanus, the God's Grove had a variety of uses, and every Whelunian knew where it was. It was a popular spot for picnics and weddings, and children were always welcome to play there. People also took injured and sick animals to Orlenstar for his ministration. Orlenstar also kept a constant store of healing [[goodberry|goodberries]], as well as his homebrew [[spruce beer]].

Although Orlenstar was officially caretaker of the shrine and grove, many Whelunians also pitched in to maintain and beautify the site, since it was so important to them.
