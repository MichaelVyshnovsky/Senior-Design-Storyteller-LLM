Szant was a port town of the kingdom of Gontal.
As of 1479 DR, the Docklord Maerigo Rustal administered the town on behalf of Queen Imreera Hethkantan.
Szant was one of the most important ports of Gontal, home to many fishing fleets. Most of the Twelvefold mercantile fleets were also docked in Szant.
Szant was the oldest settlement of Gontal, predating even the foundation of the kingdom as it existed before Laerakond was sent to Toril.
