'''Lhazantal''', known as the '''City of Smiths''', was a small town in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]].

==Geography==
It sat beside the [[Lapal Way]], close to one of Lapaliiya's few [[iron]] mines.

==Government & Religion==
Around [[1373 DR]], it was led by [[Lambrac Dinelstrand]], a master smith exiled from [[Lantan]].

The civic deity of Lhazantal was [[Gond|Gond, Lord of all Smiths]].

==Economy==
The majority of Lhazantal's businesses dealt with some aspect of metalworking. The citizens manufactured a variety of farming and other tools and hardware, decent mail [[armor]], and sturdy [[weapon]]s.

==Population==
In addition to the human population, Lhazantal had the second-highest population of [[gnome]]s in Lapaliiya, after [[Zashuma]].
