        "mainbody": "The '''Farsea Swamp''' was a massive stretch of wetlands located in the [[Eastern Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. While the swamp was a place of pestilence and disease, it harbored a mysterious past that drew in adventurer's and supported some semblance of society among its [[human]]oid inhabitants.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The swamp gave birth to the great [[Tun River]], that flowed south before emptying out into the [[Dragonmere]]. While most of the swamp's overflow passed through the south, it also flowed north into the Tunwash in the northwest, and the [[High Moors]] in the northeast.\n\nNestled in the southwest region of the swamp were the Fens of Tun."
        },
        "History": "Long before the formation of the swamp, the land it occupied was said to have been home to ancient civilization (unrelated to the ruined empire of [[Netheril]]).\n\nIt formed when the [[Farsea Marshes]] joined with the [[Tun Marshes|Marsh of Tun]] some time after the [[Era of Upheaval]].",
        "Notable Locations": "A number of named settlements could be found within the swamp, though not much was known about their size or demographics of their respective populations. Included among these were Wyrmhall, Swampgate, Nyka's Rest, Threetrees, and Swords Hollow.\n\nOnly one trail was known to have passed through the swamp, in its northern stretch, connecting the settlements of [[Aris (settlement)|Aris]] and [[Eagle Peak]].",
        "Inhabitants": "A so-called kingdom of bandits made their home in the southern region of the Farsea Swamp,"
