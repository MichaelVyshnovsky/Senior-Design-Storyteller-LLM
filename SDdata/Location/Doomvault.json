        "Geography": "The Doomvault was located deep beneath [[Thaymount]].",
        "Defenses": "As an ancient dungeon located in the magical realm of Thay, the Doomvault was defended by numerous powerful [[Red Wizards]], their [[golem]] servants, and a multitude of varied monsters, bound [[outsider]]s, and raised [[undead]], as well as magical traps and natural hazards.",
        "History": "The [[Red Wizard]] [[Kazit Gul]] spent the vast majority of his lifespan studying the most famous and deadly dungeons in [[Faer√ªn]]. Towards the end of his life, he began constructing a vast labyrinth and successfully pursued [[lich]]dom in order to finish his work. The purpose of the dungeon was to lure adventurers inside where Kazit Gul could then devour their souls to empower his phylactery.\n\nThe Doomvault passed into legend as Thay became a less welcoming place to foreigners but Szass Tam rediscovered and repurposed it to his own ends.\n\nWhen Tam learned of the [[Second Sundering]], he had his agents capture several [[Chosen]] for experimentation. They were brought to Doomvault with an eye toward using their divine power to aid Tam's goal of apotheosis.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Kazit Gul]]: The dungeon's original creator.\n* [[Tarul Var]]: A trusted [[lich]] servant of Szass Tam.\n* [[Syranna]]: The overseer of the Doomvault's gatehouse and a leader of the [[Thayan Resurrection]].\n* [[Issem]]: A [[vampire]], cursed to be bound to Doomvault and the will of the Red Wizards.\n* [[Pencheska]]: A [[succubus]] servant of Tarul Var.\n* [[Lahnis]]: A Red Wizard in charge of combat training.\n* [[Phaia]]: A devoted servant of Szass Tam.\n* [[Thaxalia]]: A [[beholder]], crippled by the Red Wizards and cursed to be unable to escape.\n* [[Sarkalla]]: An insane Red Wizard obsessed with granting intelligence to oozes.\n* The [[Ooze Master]]: An experiment to fuse an ooze with a human, resulting in a new type of lich.\n* [[Lumalia]]: An [[astral deva]] servant of [[Mystra]]."
