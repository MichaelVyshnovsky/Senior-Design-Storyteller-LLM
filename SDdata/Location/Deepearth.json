        "History": "Deepearth was originally settled by [[deep gnome]]s. In the surrounding caverns lived some clans of [[duergar]]. The duergar occasionally skirmished with the gnomes in order to gain food, cattle, and sometimes slaves, but with few successes. At last, a great deep gnome army devastated the duergar territories, stopping the raids.\n\nHowever, one night, a solitary duergar infiltrated Deepearth and inside an abandoned gnome mine discovered a pool of [[mercury]] (in truth, a ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Abyss]]). He touched the liquid and was quickly possessed by the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]]. With Orcus as their leader, the duergar managed to seize Deepearth.\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], however, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s party arrived in Deepearth and fought the duergar and the minions of Orcus.\n\nIn [[1359 DR]], the gnomes had regained control of the city and worked with the [[dwarves]] of the [[Orothiar Clan]] in order to exploit [[Bloodstone Mines]].",
