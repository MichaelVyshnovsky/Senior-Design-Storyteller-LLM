Evereska (, Elvish for "fortress home") was a secreted city within a fabled valley in the Western Heartlands, one of the last realms of the elves in the North. during the early years of the Era of Upheaval. It was the epitome of elven culture and beauty, and nearly no outsiders were considered welcome within.
Houses in Evereska were worked into the landscape, and it was possible to float large items in the city. Blueleaf trees covered the valley and were sculpted by magic. Weather conditions and diseases were regulated by the citys magical mythal, a semi-sentient magical creation that protected the city and residents, granting them a better quality of life in myriad ways.
Admittance into Evereska was only available by means of the Passing, a passageway that required a specific password or invitation from the Hill Elders to bypass peacefully. The city could only be accessed by a select few well-protected tunnels or by direct ascent up its steep cliff face.

The city of Evereska and its encompassing valley, along with the hills that encircled them, were considered to be found within the Backlands of the Western Heartlands. The entire region was well isolated from any nearby major settlements, surrounded by a difficult-to-traverse landscape, including the imposing Greycloak Hills that lay to the north, the mysterious Forgotten Forest to the west, and the unforgiving desert border formed by Anauroch to the east.
One of the few non-elf settlements near Evereska was the Halfway Inn and its adjoining village, located an hours travel away from the city on the edge of its realm of influence.
The city of Evereska was situated on a large stone pedestal, formed the marble cliffs known as the Three Sisters, that rose nearly  from the grassland below.
Throughout the city, number of smaller hills and mounds served as landmarks by which to navigate. Among these were Bellcrest Hill Cloudcrown Hill lay in the northwest of the city, Moondark Hill in the east, and known "ambushing spot" of the citys Hill Elders and Goldmorn Knoll rose just south of the heart of the city. 
Other natural markers in the city included the secluded Groaning Cave in the north,the sparkling Dawnsglory Pond in the south, and Starmeadow.
Beyond the city and the mesa atop which it sat were a grouping of flat farmlands known as the Meadow, the edge of which–designated the Meadow Wall–marked the border of the citys mythal. The wall was surrounded by the Vine Vale, a stretch of terraced vineyards and orchards obscured by mists that sheltered the Evereska from outsiders. Small clusters of structures and winding pathways could be found throughout the entirety of the valley.
The whole of the Evereska Vale was completely encircled by twelve hills collectively known as the Shaeradim, further elevating 
The streets of Evereska were alive with birds, cats and small woodland critters that wandered in from the surrounding forests.
Evereska was known as the home of elven culture on mainland Faerûn for a period following the first collapse and rebirth of Myth Drannor. It was a place of refined beauty and ancient elven power, home to The Peoples most powerful spellcasters and clergy of the Seldarine.
As of the late 14 century DR, the city of Evereska was home to some of the most notable noble elven families.
The elves of Evereska formed their own form of sign language, referred to as Evereskan finger talk. It was often used for silent communication between elven sentries, such as those of the Tomb Guard.
While it was known to once only be available to gnomish smiths, the secrets of the fabled arandur metal was known to some elven craftspeople of Evereska.
The spirited drink Evereskan clearwater could be found in taverns outside the city, as far away as Waterdeep.
Throughout its history, Evereska was home to elven dualists, practitioners of magic that focused on a single specific school of magic.
Some Evereskan elves spent their time in deep caverns working to create new spells.
The leadership of Evereska comprised a group of senior elves and eladrin known as the Hill Elders, and Gervas Imesfor.
The leaders of Evereska maintained contact with the Elven Imperial Fleet as of the 14 century DR.
The Evereska Charter passed in the , stated that anyone seen defiling tombs within the Greycloak Hills were subject to the judgment and punishment of the Evereskan elves.
The elves of Evereska were largely self-sufficient, but did trade with other cities of the Realms, sometimes as far away as the continent of Zakhara. Because the hills around Evereska contained little in the way of ores, metals were imported into the city in exchange for paintings, sculptures, crafted wooden items, and wine.
Prominent trade families included the moon elf houses of Alaenree, Coudoarluth, Presrae, and Straeth the gold elf Elond, Immeril, and Naelgrath families and the sylvan elf family of Shalandalan.
The warriors defending the city were so adept they would easily intercept any traveler coming within  of the Evereska Vale. They were equipped with enchanted armor that allowed them to fly.

The collective military of the city was properly referred to as the Army of Evereska, which comprised several different branches. The Long Watch as the exterior army beyond the protection of the citys valley, and the Swords of Evereska served the noble army, composed of the Noble Blades and Lordly Wands, Evereskas most skill warriors were drawn into the Cold Hand, an elite force commanded by High Lord Duirsar himself.
The Vale Guard served as Evereskas equivalent of a city guard, whose jurisdiction extended out to the greater valley, while the Tomb Guard acted as protectors of all elven crypts within the Greycloak Hills. Finally the Feather Cavalry served as aerial mounted sentries that watched over Evereskas skies.
Evereskas valley was believed to have first been populated by elves during the Founding Time, specifically in the  by several clans hailing from ancient Aryvandaar. They sought to create a secret refuge for their people, known only to the TelQuessir. 
A millennium later in , Evermeet began to experience significant overcrowding, which led in part to the founding of Sharrven in the borders of the High Forest. When the empire of Aryvandaar fell, the elves of Evereska allied themselves with those from Sharrven to help prevent the realm of Siluvanede from suffering the same fate. These efforts were made in vain however, and in , the feyri of Siluvanede brought about the collapse of Sharrven and the slaughter of its people. Many of the survivors turn to Evereska for shelter and survival.
The existence of Evereska remained secret until the , when its location was uncovered by human tribes living within the Greycloak Hills. They only managed to keep the citys secret safe for a mere few centuries.
In the , the first human ever was granted admittance into Evereska. He was a chosen of Mystra known as Aruns Son, an individual that nearly sacrificed his own life to save several Evereskans from one of the malevolent phaerimm.
Evereska received refugees from Askavar in the Wood of Sharp Teeth, after its fall during the late 6 century DR.
In Nightal of the , dual effects of weave magic and shadow magic created an opening in the Sharn Wall beneath the Greycloak Hills, and the maligned phaerimm were released from their subterranean prison. After enthralling scores of bugbear,s mind flayers, and beholders, the phaerimm began an assault on the outer valley of Evereska, devastating much of the lush landscape. Fortunately they were turned away by combined forces of the Evereskan elves and allies from Waterdeep led by Khelben Arunsun. In the following weeks the elven warriors were joined in battle by the arcanists of Thultanthar, and in Mirtul of the next year, the forces of the Lords Alliance led by Laeral and Storm Silverhand. Finally in Eleasis of the ,
that year, the phaerimm and their army were finally defeated and driven out of Evereska for good.
During the conflict, the aberrant monstrosities damaged the citys mythal causing further disruption to the vale. While the Evereskans were able to repel the attack using magic, the mythal had to be rebuilt. The citys High Mages were able to repair the nearly all of the protection on their own, but required assistance from Galaeron Nihmedu, a novice practitioner of shadow magic. This caused the restored mythal of Evereska to be the first ever formed from both the Weave and magic drawing from the Shadow Weave.  
In the aftermath of the fighting, a few phaerimm and elves who lost their wits in the battle wandered the Evereskan valley.
The survivors of the battle with the phaerimm were all younger elves, and they protected their existence violently if they encountered a threat. They regarded looters as deserving of death. Occasional clashes broke out between the surviving elves and phaerimm. Some elves traveled from other parts of Faerûn to join the remaining Evereskan elves, and some removed the remaining treasures of Evereska, moving them to safer locations. 
Following the conflict, the gardens of the valley became untended and overgrown and many of the bridges in the valley were broken. Elves designated helmed horrors and shield guardians to protect their houses. The damage to the mythal caused Evereska to be cloaked in mist or fine rain. Unpredictable magical effects arose seemingly out of nowhere.
Evereska faced another grave threat in the , when an army of feyri led by Sarya Dlardrageth marched upon the city. The city was saved by the efforts of Seiveril Miritar, a gold elf lord of Evermeet. In what would become known as Seiverils Crusade, the elf lord left his on the isle of elves and raised an volunteer army to save their fellow TelQuessir on the mainland.
Following the world-altering Spellplague that wracked Faerûn a decade later, in the , the barrier between Evereska and the Feywild became less distinct and clear. For some time it existed equally between both the Feywild and the Prime Material plane.
In a stark change of tradition, Evereska eventually opened up its borders and allowed outlanders to enter within.
During the emergence of the second Netherese empire, the elves of Evereska remained stalwart defenders against the empires westward expansion.
After the second fall of Myth Drannor in the , many refugees came to Evereska but some of them were unhappy with Evereskas reclusiveness.
As of the late 14 century DR, Evereska was only known to most humans by mere rumor or legend.
