        "mainbody": "he Nowhere Inn, as it was called by its inhabitants, was a campsite located on the Infinite Staircase that provided services and lodging for travelers along the planar pathway.\nThe \"inn\" was located on a particularly wide landing of the Stairway that connected to several flights of stairs going up and down. It was a small agglomeration of tents and other temporary structures. The smell of cooking and the campfires could be picked up from quite a distance away.\nSeveral of the campsites permanent and temporary residents traded goods with travelers and offered information about some of the nearby destinations. It was also possible to hire guides or to set up parties to travel together along sections of the Staircase.\nThe community of the Nowhere Inn was very close. Threats by visitors against a resident tended to end in violence.\nThe camp was always busy with travelers and bustling with activity, as several people gathered there for protection or companionship. Most permanent inhabitants of the campsite were merchants and misfits. Some notable inhabitants included\n* Allisa Misthaven, an elf who sold a wine called Starclear, a watered-down version of Evermead.\n* Ceylon, an ogre mage who offered his services as a guide through the Staircase. He was also very experienced with traveling through the Abyss.\n* Ching-Dau, a human artist who traded meat. He lived in a pink tent and wore clothes cut from the same fabric as his tent."
