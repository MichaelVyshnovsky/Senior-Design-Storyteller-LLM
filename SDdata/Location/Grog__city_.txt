Grog was a small, agricultural city-state in the ancient Netherese Empire.
The settlement sat in the fork of the Zweihaus River and Westview River, upriver of Fluvion and Heip Lake.
The city was founded as an agricultural town in , early in Netherese history. Little of import occurred there, with its main claim to notoriety being the creation of its local specialty beer, "grog." Though by all accounts a terrible drink, it remained inexplicably popular in Grog, then spread to became popular among Netherils sailors who used it as a rust remover and a vile rite of passage for their guild. The recipe eventually spread across Netheril, and the drink became common in all ports throughout the land.
Grog became the enemy of the militant Jannathan holy order, Jannaths Defenders, who they called "murderers who wantonly massacred entrepreneurs." The rangers operated from the Glorifier and developed a fearsome and brutal reputation, though not an entirely deserved one.
Grog continued its quiet pastoral existence until the farmlands around it began to turn to desert after , and by  it had been abandoned. The only residents were rumored to be the ghosts of those killed while under the influence of the vile grog drink.
By the late 14 century DR there existed a book detailing the citys history. This book notably alleged a connection between the city-state and the similarly named variety of alcoholic beverages, grog.
