'''Grog''' was a small, agricultural city-state in the ancient [[Netherese Empire]].

==Geography==
The settlement sat in the fork of the [[Zweihaus River]] and [[Westview River]], upriver of [[Fluvion]] and [[Heip Lake]].

==History==
The city was founded as an agricultural town in {{yearlinkConvert|753|NY}}, early in [[Netherese]] history. Little of import occurred there, with its main claim to notoriety being the creation of its local specialty [[beer]], "grog." Though by all accounts a terrible drink, it remained inexplicably popular in Grog, then spread to became popular among [[Netheril]]'s sailors who used it as a rust remover and a vile rite of passage for their [[guild]]. The recipe eventually spread across Netheril, and the drink became common in all ports throughout the land.

Grog became the enemy of the militant [[Jannath]]an holy order, [[Jannath's Defenders]], who they called "murderers who wantonly massacred entrepreneurs." The [[ranger]]s operated from [[the Glorifier]] and developed a fearsome and brutal reputation, though not an entirely deserved one.

Grog continued its quiet pastoral existence until the farmlands around it began to turn to desert after {{yearlinkConvert|3400|NY}}, and by {{yearlinkConvert|3503|NY}} it had been abandoned. The only residents were rumored to be the [[ghost]]s of those killed while under the influence of the vile grog drink.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] there existed a [[book]] detailing the city's history. This book notably alleged a connection between the city-state and the similarly named variety of alcoholic beverages, [[grog]].
