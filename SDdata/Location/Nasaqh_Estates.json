They lay between Mount Helimbrar and Mount Sar, east of the High Road out of Waterdeep along the Sword Coast North.\nBy 1372 DR, the Nasaqh Estates had been ruled by four generations of Nasaqhs.\nThe neighboring lands were held by the Agrivars.\nFollowing Ostuss death in 1352 DR, Nasaqh held the Agrivar lands in trust while Priam adventured in search of his fathers killer and otherwise fighting evil. Some six years later, Nasaqh likely hoped for Priam to return to the family seat someday. He was still holding the lands for Priam by 1372 DR.\nthumb|right|Ostuss Hold, held in trust on the Nasaqh Estates.\nThe Nasaqh Estates overlaid a valley between Mount Sar and Mount Helimbrar, primarily belonging to Mount Sar.
