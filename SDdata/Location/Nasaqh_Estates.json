        "History": "By [[1372 DR]], the Nasaqh Estates had been ruled by four generations of Nasaqhs.\n\nThe neighboring lands were held by the [[Agrivar]]s.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|1}}\n\nFollowing Ostus's death in 1352 DR, Nasaqh held the Agrivar lands in trust while Priam adventured in search of [[Imgig Zu|his father's killer]] and otherwise fighting evil. Some six years later, Nasaqh likely hoped for Priam to return to the family seat someday. He was still holding the lands for Priam by 1372 DR.",

The Nasaqhs ruled from a fort upon the estate.\n\nThe neighboring Agrivar estate, held in trust by Lord Nasaqh, was included within the Nasaqh Estates. They comprised old woodlands and over 100 acres of fertile fields. The Agrivar house, named Ostus's Hold, was a large stone manor built atop a rise.{{Cite dragon/247/Rogues Gallery: Crew of the Realms Master|80}}",
