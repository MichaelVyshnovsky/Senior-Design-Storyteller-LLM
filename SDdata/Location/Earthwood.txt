The '''Earthwood''' was a thick forest in the [[Earthspur Mountains]] within [[Damara]], which consisted mainly of [[birch]] and evergreen trees.

==Geography==
Despite the poor appearance of the stony, hilly soil, the fertility of the land was such that it allowed trees to grow quickly. The cause of this was dictated by legend as the work of a [[druid]] who was attempting to defy the advance of the [[Great Glacier]], which had reached this far south in the past.

==Inhabitants==
The forest was thinly inhabited, and some woodcutters chose to live here, although more people did arrive when [[Rawlinswood]] became less tolerant towards outsiders. The [[goblin]]s and other inhabitants of the Earthspur Mountains would not enter the forest.
