'''Ship Isle''', or the '''Island of Ships''' or the '''Isle of Ships''', was a small island located in the [[Golden Water]] of the [[Shining Lands]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Description==
As the name implied, Ship Isle was used primarily for the construction of sailing vessels. The [[Sholapur chaka]] set up dockyards along the coast of much of the island. These were used to construct the most prized vessels to sail the Golden Water.
