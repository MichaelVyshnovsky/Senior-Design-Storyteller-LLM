Highcliff Castle was a ruin in Highcliff on the Sword Coast. 
Located on a hill near Highcliff, Highcliff Castle was a strategic point.
The inhabitants all died, with only the undead remaining.
One of many sites where the King of Shadows army fought a battle, Highcliff Castle was a ruin by 1374 DR. However, at that time, a shadow priest came and began raising an undead army. Fortunately, he was stopped by the Kalach-Cha.
In the area around the castle at the time, the adventurers Alex and Andrew, as well as William (who ran away from his wife), were threatened by wolves. The Kalach-Cha could rescue them.
