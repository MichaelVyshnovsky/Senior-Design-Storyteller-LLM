        "mainbody": "The Gate of the Ghost was one of the entrances into Huzuz, the City of Delights.\nThe Gate of the Ghost was the most heavily used entrance to the city. Caravans departing for Halwa and hordes of pilgrims bound for Huzuz used this gate.\nMamluks were used for security and to help direct the vast flow of traffic passing through the gate. Each morning began with several caravans waiting in line for inspection. During peak afternoon hours, caravans often had to wait for hours before passing through the gate.\nThe name \"Gate of the Ghosts\" was derived from the large amount of traffic coming from the Haunted Lands. Superstitious Zakharans believed that ghosts and other spirits came with the travelers from the great desert."
