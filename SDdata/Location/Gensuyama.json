        "mainbody": "ensuyama was a volcano located in Kozakura.\nGensuyama was located in Kagochi Province on the island of Shinkoku. It was the only active volcano in Kozakura, renowned for its perilous lava flows. The area between the volcano and the southern sea was uninhabited, featuring rugged basalt rock formations.\nGensuyama was widely believed to be haunted by malevolent spirits, with hermits from nearby mountains asserting the presence of an entrance to the underworld. These hermits also claimed that spirits who have escaped the underworld occasionally wandered the vicinity. The region is known for encounters with kuei, poh, and con-tinh.\nIn a violent eruption during Emperor Reijos third year of reign, ships at sea faced the impact of far-flung pumice and volcanic debris."
