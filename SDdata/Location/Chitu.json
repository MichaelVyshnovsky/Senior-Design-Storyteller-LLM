        "mainbody": "hitu was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura.\nChitu, once the bustling hub for miners of the Mountain of Iron, has withered into a village in decline. The disintegration of the mining industry has led to a gradual exodus, leaving behind a landscape of hardship and neglect. Visitors were met with a scene of destitution, where the outer buildings stood abandoned, their structural integrity compromised by time and neglect. The heart of the village, though still inhabited, painted a bleak picture of poverty. Women and children, their appearances marred by the struggles of their lives, navigated a life of scarcity, while the men, once full of aspirations, now carry the weight of broken spirits, their livelihoods crushed by harsh realities.\nAs of , the villages jito was Fukuda Sueji. His governance was marked by self-indulgence and a disinterest in the welfare of his subjects. Unmoved by the plight of the villagers, his focus remained on personal gains and the comforts of his station.\nThe villagers resignation has left them vulnerable to encroachment by undesirable elements. Bakemono and goblin rats, emerging from the mines and the surrounding forests, have begun to brazenly inhabit the fringes of Chitu."
