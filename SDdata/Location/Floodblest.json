        "mainbody": "'''Floodblest''' was a small farming village located east of the city of [[Neverwinter]] along the southern bank of the [[Neverwinter River]].",
        "Description": "Those who traveled east from the city of Neverwinter, along the Neverwinter River, reached the small town of Floodblest. It stood relatively close to the edge of the [[Neverwinter Wood]] and neighbored the city of [[Nightsedge]] further east, on the opposite bank of the river.",
        "Trade": "Most trade in Floodblest came from its farming community. Apart from that, the town served as a layover and a rest stop for those who traveled from further east to the city of Neverwinter, or from Neverwinter to the neighboring town of Nightsedge.",
        "History": "In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the village of Floodblest became afflicted by a mysterious [[disease]]. The Lord-Mayor of Floodblest thought that the hard times were orchestrated by a vile villainous spellcaster hiding somewhere in the village. The first omen was the town's well going dry shortly before the disease became apparent. Lord-Mayor's hired adventurers managed to discover that the city's well led to a mysterious dungeon in its depths; however, those who tried to venture in were never seen again. The Lord-Mayor sent an aid request to [[Nasher Alagondar]] of Neverwinter, hoping the western neighbor could send a band of able-bodied adventurers to find the cause of the ill-luck.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Rankled Boar Inn]], a small, quaint and comfortable inn that catered to traveling adventurers and merchants.\n*[[Sinda's Trading Post]], the local general store that dealt in simple weapons, arms, and traveling supplies.\n*'''Temple of Chauntea''', a humble temple dedicated to the [[Goddess of Agriculture]], the town's primary deity."
