They would seek a way back to their home.\n\nHowever, it was said that they and their unicorn were all slain horribly by [[Tiamat]], long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nDespite the rumors of their untimely demise, they would later somehow find their way to the Realms (no relation) on the world of Toril one way{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}} or another.<ref>{{Cite comic/Saturday Morning Adventures 1}}",
        "Description": "The Realm was a savage place with only a few pockets of civilization spread across the land. The Dungeon Master described it as \"an exciting place of wonder and beauty—and grave danger\". It presumably included both dungeons and [[dragon]]s."
