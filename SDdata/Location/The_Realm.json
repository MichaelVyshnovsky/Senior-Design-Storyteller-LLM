        "mainbody": "The Realm was a land on a world somewhere that was not in any way, shape, or form related to the Realms of Toril.\nthumb|The mysterious Dungeon Master.\nA group of youngsters from Earth—Hank, Eric, Diana, Presto, Sheila, and Bobby—became stranded in the Realm, where they were met by an entity known as the Dungeon Master and a unicorn foal named Uni. They would seek a way back to their home.\nHowever, it was said that they and their unicorn were all slain horribly by Tiamat, long before the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDespite the rumors of their untimely demise, they would later somehow find their way to the Realms (no relation) on the world of Toril one way or another.\nThe Realm was a savage place with only a few pockets of civilization spread across the land. The Dungeon Master described it as \"an exciting place of wonder and beauty—and grave danger\". It presumably included both dungeons and dragons."
