'''Jazirat al-Sadaf''', also known as the '''Island of the Shell''', was an island in [[Jazayir al-Sartan]].

==Geography==
The island was surrounded on all sides by imposing cliffs made from volcanic rock, proving especially treacherous to approaching vessels.

==Inhabitants==
The Island of the Shell was the largest of the archipelago. Inhabitants from the other islands said it was only populated by monsters, cannibals, and other vile things. One savage tribe called this place home, the [[Gurum]].
