        "mainbody": "he Serpentsbridge was found northwest of the town of Shadowdale, set in between the Desertsmouth Mountains and Castle Daggerdale, in the midâ€“14th century DR. It provided a passage, 50 feet (15 meters) over the mighty Ashaba river along the Tethyamar Trail.\nAt first glance, the bridge appeared to be a normal, albeit weathered, stone bridge. Upon closer inspection one could see indents and ridges in the stone, which appeared to move as it if were a writhing mass of snakes. Despite its appearance, the bridge was perfectly safe to cross."
