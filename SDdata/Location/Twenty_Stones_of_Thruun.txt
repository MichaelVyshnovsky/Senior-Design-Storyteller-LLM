The '''Twenty Stones of Thruun''' was an arrangement of standing stones found in the isolated fishing village of [[Dougan's Hole]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
This landmark comprised a score of vertical [[granite]] [[menhir]]s, aligned in a triangle with three equal sides, with a single stone placed in the center.

==Rumors & Legends==
The folks of Dougan's Hole maintained that the stones were arranged before their town was founded.

While no one knew the exact meaning of the word ''[[Thruun]]'', some [[sage]]s have connected it to mighty creature that lived in Icewind Dale in ages past, while others believed it was the name of a long-forgotten [[deity]].

Around 1485 DR, the barbarian champion [[Isarr Kronenstrom]] summoned Thruun from the standing stones and sent it to attack Good Mead. The hairy creature was the size of a horse, with long arms and clawed hands. Its face resembled a wolf, but eyeless and with several sets of nostrils. The summoning process seemingly involves the severed hands of ten sacrificial victims (two hands each).{{Cite dungeon/220/King of the Wolves|36}}
