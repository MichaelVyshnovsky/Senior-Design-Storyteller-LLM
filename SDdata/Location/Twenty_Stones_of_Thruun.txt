century DR pamphlet advertising the Twenty Stones of Thruun.
The Twenty Stones of Thruun was an arrangement of standing stones found in the isolated fishing village of Dougans Hole in Icewind Dale.
This landmark comprised a score of vertical granite menhirs, aligned in a triangle with three equal sides, with a single stone placed in the center.
The folks of Dougans Hole maintained that the stones were arranged before their town was founded.
While no one knew the exact meaning of the word Thruun, some sages have connected it to mighty creature that lived in Icewind Dale in ages past, while others believed it was the name of a long-forgotten deity.
Around 1485 DR, the barbarian champion Isarr Kronenstrom summoned Thruun from the standing stones and sent it to attack Good Mead. The hairy creature was the size of a horse, with long arms and clawed hands. Its face resembled a wolf, but eyeless and with several sets of nostrils. The summoning process seemingly involves the severed hands of ten sacrificial victims (two hands each).
