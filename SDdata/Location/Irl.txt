'''Irl''' was a village that lay just west of the [[River Rith]], due north of [[The Realm of the Mount]]. The village's main claim to fame was in the form of jewlers and their [[gem]]s. Governmental rulings were made by the [[Eight-sided Stone]], a covert council whose members were the elders of the most powerful Irlian families.{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms|url=http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frbk/20061129|title=Irl|date=2006-11-29|accessdate=2008-04-25}}

Irl had an inn called [[The Bold Ki-rin]]. It was a large, three-story, half-timbered mansion with many chimneys. The inn's dining room was famous for roasts, [[wine]]s, and succulent sauces and its stables were second to none. The owner and keeper of the Rin was the jovial ex-adventurer [[Brelmere Baerith]].

Where the village main street curved around the front of The Bold Ki-rin, there was a row of six well-established jewelry shops. The jewelers of Irl were reputed to be among the richest and most powerful humans in all [[Faer√ªn]]. They were secretive and reclusive and their behind-the-scenes influence could move merchants of [[Sembia]], the [[Zulkir|Zulkirs of Thay]] and nobles of [[Waterdeep]] to do things they would rather not.
