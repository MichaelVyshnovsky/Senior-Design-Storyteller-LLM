        "mainbody": "'''Ioma''' was a small island in the [[Nelanther Isles]] to the west of [[Amn]].\n\nThe island had only one town, [[Ioma Town]], with a population of 800 in [[1479 DR]]. Most of the island was occupied by a mountain of the same name, which contained a large vein of [[Iomic crystal]] at its peak.\n\nBy the late 15th century DR, the island had become a competitor of [[Skaug]]'s, although its port was only half as large. The island was protected by a small cadre of [[Cowled Wizards]] from Amn."
