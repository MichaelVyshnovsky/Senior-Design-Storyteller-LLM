Stoneturn Well was a freshwater well located a short distance east of Ardeep Forest, due east of Waterdeep but across the River Dessarin. In the Year of the Loom, 344 DR, dwarves built a stronghold around the well that eventually became known as the House of Stone.
The waters of Stoneturn bubbled up naturally from deep underground. The well was connected to a vertical column of water known to the local denizens of the Underdark as Asmaeringlol ("Giantgout" in the Common tongue). This large subterranean lake was heated from beneath by volcanic activity and was filled with aquatic life.
The dwarves who built the fortress around Stoneturn Well also dug caverns for storing grain a safe distance away from the well shaft. However, in the years following the abandonment of the House of Stone, unlucky or unwise adventurers broke through the massive stone formations that separated the water from at least one of these granaries, resulting in a flooded chamber.
