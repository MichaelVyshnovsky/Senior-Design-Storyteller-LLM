'''Stoneturn Well''' was a freshwater well located a short distance east of [[Ardeep Forest]], due east of [[Waterdeep]] but across the [[River Dessarin]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|3}} In the [[344 DR|Year of the Loom, 344 DR]], [[dwarves]] built a stronghold around the well that eventually became known as the [[House of Stone]].

==Description==
The waters of Stoneturn bubbled up naturally from deep underground. The well was connected to a vertical column of water known to the local denizens of the [[Underdark]] as [[Asmaeringlol]] ("Giantgout" in the [[Common]] tongue). This large subterranean lake was heated from beneath by volcanic activity and was filled with aquatic life.

==History==
The dwarves who built the fortress around Stoneturn Well also dug caverns for storing grain a safe distance away from the well shaft. However, in the years following the abandonment of the House of Stone, unlucky or unwise [[adventurer]]s broke through the massive stone formations that separated the water from at least one of these granaries, resulting in a flooded chamber.
