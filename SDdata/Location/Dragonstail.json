        "mainbody": "The Dragonstail was a peninsula protruding from the Purple Hills in Tethyr in west Faerûn.\nThe Dragonstail was low in elevation and described as serpentine, snaking out into the Sea of Swords. The town of Carathryn stood on its coast at the seaward end.\nIn the Year of the Shattered Chains, 1123 DR, the Teeth of Talos storms lashed the southern Sword Coast. The storms completely sunk the Dragonstail peninsula, taking Carathryn with it. In later years, both the Dragonstail and Carathryn were a hazard to mariners along the coast, by ripping open the hulls of passing ships.\nCategoryCapes\nCategoryLocations in the Purple Hills\nCategoryLocations in Tethyr\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\na7ctjwg1j7fwo9jur5gp8k12ujuzwp5"
