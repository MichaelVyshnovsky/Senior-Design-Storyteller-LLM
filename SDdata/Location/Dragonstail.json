        "Geography": "The Dragonstail was low in elevation and described as serpentine, snaking out into the [[Sea of Swords]]. The town of [[Carathryn]] stood on its coast at the seaward end.",
        "History": "In the [[1123 DR|Year of the Shattered Chains, 1123 DR]], the Teeth of [[Talos]] storms lashed the southern [[Sword Coast]]. The storms completely sunk the Dragonstail peninsula, taking Carathryn with it. In later years, both the Dragonstail and Carathryn were a hazard to mariners along the coast, by ripping open the hulls of passing ships.",
