The Waukeshire was a small forest found in Bloodstone Barony. Situated within this forest was a halfling village of the same name.
The Waukeshire was located in Bloodstone Pass due east of Bloodstone Village and off to the northern side of the main road connecting the Vaasan and Damaran Gates.
The trees of the Waukeshire stood straight and the undergrowth was kept trimmed, giving the forest a tidy appearance.
The tunnel complexes of the Warren were found beneath the forest, crossing under the Beaumaris River and connecting to the Warrenwood.
During the occupation of Bloodstone Pass by allies of Zhengyi the Witch-King during the 1350s DR, life continued much the same among the halflings of Waukeshire, at least outwardly. in order to squirrel away their harvest and keep it safe from Zhengyis bandits.
The forest was home to most of the halfling population of Bloodstone Valley. Visitors and travelers were welcomed so long as they took care to avoid harming the foliage or littering, In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, these halflings were governed by Mayor William and their militia was led by the young Fredegast.
