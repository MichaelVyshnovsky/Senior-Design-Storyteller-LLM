Kork was a small village located on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
The village was located on the eastern coast of Moray along the Strait of the Leviathan.
The inhabitants of Kork were wiped out during a raid by the savage Black Blood Tribe. Following the attack, Kork was eventually repopulated by mercenaries and settlers from Amn. The Amnian settlers constructed a road leading to Morays interior to gain better access to the valuable peat and kryne found there.
