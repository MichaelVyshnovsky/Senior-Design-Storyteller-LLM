        "mainbody": "The Bridge District of Athkatla was one of the citys poorer quarters, situated on the southern reach of the Alandor River, just south of the bridge that spanned its waters.\nIt was home to a fair number of low-end businesses, tiny hole-in-the-wall shops selling second-hand or illegal wares. Many of these catered to the merchants and travelers who made their living along the caravan routes.\nThe district had narrow, winding streets lined with rowhouses of some of the poorer Athkatlan citizens. Among these were the citys laborers, street-side cart vendors, shop assistants and the like.\n*Bordryns Bucket The tavern of choice for the locals of the district\n*Delosars Inn\n*Mithrest Inn"
