        "mainbody": "Afyal, also called the Isle of the Elephant, was a large island kingdom at the eastern edge of Zakhara, north of Sahu.\nThe kingdoms capital, Medina al-Afyal, was also its only real city. The landscape of Afyal was mainly untamed jungles with wild creatures in abundance. Afyal was also the location of a fallen empire whose ruins were scattered across the islands jungles, often bearing inscriptions in the forgotten language Affa.\nIt had rich deposits of gemstones and precious metals, spices, and valuable hardwoods which grew in abundance. The presence of these raw materials combined with its advantageous position en route to Zakharas trading partners in the far east made Afyal one of the wealthiest areas of the continent. Fabulous jewelry was one of their prime exports."
