It lay on both sides of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] that ran through it. Over its long history, it was home to the [[orc]] nation of [[Vastar]] for which it was named; the ancient [[elf]] city of [[Ylraphon]], an outpost of [[Cormanthyr]]; the brief [[dwarf]] kingdom of [[Roldilar]], the Realm of Glimmering Swords; and a variety of [[human]] city-states—historic [[Procampur]] and [[Tsurlagol]], and the newcomers [[Calaunt]], [[Tantras]], and [[Ravens Bluff]], the Living City—some of which gathered into the nation of [[Vesperin]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n{{Quote|''Come one, come all, here to the Vast.

It was once home to [[orc]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and [[dwarf|dwarves]], and later settled by a variety of [[human]] immigrants.\n\nAs of [[1372 DR]], the Vast was home to 1,308,960 people: 78% human, 9% dwarf, 5% halfling, 3% elf, 2% gnome, 1% half-elf and 1% half-orc.\n\nThe human population was a blend of Damaran and Chondathan immigrants, predominantly Damaran. However, those Damarans who lived south of the Earthfast Mountains mostly resembled their Chondathan neighbors. They were of the same heritage as the [[Cormyr]]eans, [[Dalelands|Dalesman]], and [[Sembia]]ns, whom they considered kin.",
        "Etymology & Languages": "The true source of the name \"the Vast\" was lost to history, but most [[sage]]s thought it derived from \"[[Vastar]]\", the name of the ancient [[orc]] kingdom that once dominated the land.\n\nThe people of the Vast spoke the [[Easting language]], with both Procampan and Tantran dialects,{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26,28}} which was related to the [[Damaran language]].",
        "Governments": "There was no overall government or leader in the Vast, and no capital city. Instead, it was divided up by a number of city-states and feudal holdings. The cities were mostly governed by councils made up of landowners and wealthy merchants, or dominated by ex-[[adventurer]]s.\n\nEventually, however, the formerly independent city-states of Calaunt, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras united in the nation of [[Vesperin]], a young country by [[1479 DR]]. Its capital was at Tantras, and it was ruled by the [[Golden Lord]]s there, but gold was more influential than government. Vesperin remained neutral with regard to international politics, becoming a meeting place for agents of other powers and thick with intrigue. <ref group=\"note\">Only  Calaunt, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras are mentioned as being a part of Vesperin in ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'', with the status of the other cities (Procampur and Tsurlagol), towns, and settlements in the Vast unknown. Therefore, it is uncertain to what extent Vesperin overlaps the Vast.",
        "Business & Economy": "The peoples of the Vast produced and exported metals of [[copper]], [[iron]], nickel and [[silver]], farm produce like grain and livestock, and parchment and textiles.\n\nMany travelers declared that the finest inns in the Vast were not those in the cities or in the Vast itself, but on the roads linking to the Vast to the outside. The best was said to be [[The Wizard's Hand]] in [[Maskyr's Eye]], followed by [[The Worried Wyvern]] in [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] and [[The Elf in Armor]] in [[High Haspur]]. These were among the best in [[Faerûn]].\n\nBy 1479 DR, with the decline of Impiltur and Sembia, the nation of Vesperin in the Vast had become a center for trade in the region. However, it was also rife with corruption and crime.",
        "People": {
            "Adventurers": "[[File:VastWizard.jpg|thumb|left|A typical wizard of the Vast.]]\n[[Adventurer]]s were similarly welcome, for they brought [[gold]], [[magic]], and tales from their travels. The country folk, however, tended to be more reserved towards adventurers that trekked through their fields and risked causing trouble.\n\nSuch adventurers were often folk who were quick to act and a little pushy, and who often won through by pluck, determination, or dumb luck. A fair number came from wealthy merchant families. Adventurers tended to vary by their home city and trade, but in general shared some broad characteristics.\n\nIn keeping with the general Vast attitude, adventuring [[fighter|warriors]] of the Vast tended to be optimistic and enthusiastic, undeterred by tales of adventurers meeting sorry ends. They were daring, willing to stand up to any challenge. Many youngsters of the Vast were drawn to this kind of life. However, little distinguished them visually from adventuring warriors Faerûn-over. These warriors preferred reliable, practical, and oft-used armor and weaponry, with simple clothing and heavy cape or cloak, and a little [[jewelry]] and other decoration. Spiked [[banded mail]] was a common choice of armor.\n\n[[Wizard]]s of the Vast were described as grand, charismatic and even glamorous people. Whether in success or in disaster, they always planned ahead to gain or regain wealth and status. They preferred comfortable clothing that was both practical when adventuring and suitable for a visit to a palace. They did enjoy jewelry and similar accessories, but no more than was tasteful.\n\nThe Vast's rogues, thieves, and scoundrels, meanwhile, were eager and willing to do anything, and almost recklessly brave—an attitude that as often as not got them into danger as well as out. They were high-spirited and good-humored even in the face of doom, and were described as masters of graveyard humor. They often dressed in dandy clothing to stand out, with flowing capes, feathered caps, fancy frills, and a range of bright colors, though they eschewed apparel that was too encumbering or weakened their defenses.\n\nThe [[Sublime Way]] found one of its greatest homes in western Faerûn in the Vast, where the traditions of blade magic remained strong. The [[White Raven]] discipline was created in the Vast and the great [[Reshar]] learned it there. The discipline of the [[Devoted Spirit]] was called \"Ancestral Sword\" in the Vast, in respect to the great blade magicians of old. Many wandering warriors in the Vast practiced blade magic, with a few dedicated [[Master of Nine|Masters of Nine]]. Sword temples were found in the cities of Procampur, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras, each with [[crusader]] orders, such as the [[Trueblades]] and the [[Knights of the White Raven]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades|}}",
            "Customs & Culture": "For the dangers of the wilderness, the people of the Vast commonly went armed, especially outside the cities and in the rural areas. Such weapons were simple and practical, however, usually a [[knife]], [[sling]], or [[staff]]. As soon as a child was allowed away from their parents, they could have a sling or a knife in their belt.\n\nFor the country folk, hunting was a way of life and game was plentiful. Most hunts were carried out in the woodlands, on foot by a few archers or a handful of people equipped with [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[spear]]s; the former method, though it took more skill, left the prey in better shape. On hills and wooded mountainsides, hunts were conducted by large bands with better weapons, lest the hunters find themselves the prey of orcs, bandits, or monsters. In wildernesses plagued by monsters, this form of hunting was the norm.\n\nFavorite prey animals were [[boar]], [[deer]], and even [[bear]], and these were roasted and served in many inns. The Vast was famous for its roast stag, with succulent, high-quality meat of great size. A local tradition was to serve the roast stag on several large platters, including the entire rack of antlers on the first tray, accompanying the finest cuts and sweetmeats.\n\n[[File:BoneDance.jpg|thumb|The Bone Dance was an event for young and old.]]There were a few local festivals unique to the Vast, celebrated across the land but with more enthusiasm in the countryside communities than in the big cities. These were:\n* [[The Arming]] (4th [[Tarsakh]]): A celebration of local militias and battle readiness.\n* [[The Plowing]] (6th [[Mirtul]]): The traditional plowing time in farming communities.\n* [[Hornmoot]] (14th [[Kythorn]]): The first trading day of the year between dwarves and humans.\n* The [[Bone Dance (festival)|Bone Dance]] ([[Eleasis 9|9th]] [[Eleasis]]): A hunting festival and banquet dedicated to [[Malar]], god of the hunt.",
            "Religion": "The people of the Vast tolerated a wide number of faiths, and all of the most popular [[Faerûnian pantheon|human faiths]] were represented there. The most important were those of [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]] and [[Torm]], followed by [[Mystra]], [[Tempus]], [[Tymora]], [[Umberlee]], and [[Waukeen]]. Tymora, Tempus and Waukeen were known as the \"traveler's gods\" and they had [[shrine]]s across the land. Other gods also had shrines across the Vast, along with a few [[temple]]s, mainly in the big cities. Waukeen's temples declined following her disappearance in [[1358 DR]], but were expected to quickly recover when she returned in [[1370 DR]].\n\nDwarves of the Vast commonly followed [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]]. The fallen dwarven realm of [[Roldilar]] left behind a number of boulders along the [[North Road]], each carved with the symbol of Clangeddin. Many human warriors of the Vast honored both Tempus and Clangeddin before going into battle in the mountains.\n\nThe cities of the Vast, especially Ravens Bluff, were centers of worship for halfling followers of [[Brandobaris]]."

        "Adventures": "{{Quote|''Treasure? Aye, lots of it in the Vast, lad; why didn't ye ask earlier? Oh… I see; ye wanted to live a while, first.''|[[Buirin Thalshond]] of [[Tantras]], [[1357 DR]]}}\nThough some of its cities were extremely old and standing on the first settled lands in modern times, much of the Vast in the mid–14th century had only been taken from the native orcs within the last few generations and was just beginning to be settled and civilized. Thus in many places it remained wild, lawless, and unexplored, and so for professional adventurers it was a hotspot for adventure.\n\nThe land was once ruled by orcs and goblins, in the nation of [[Vastar]], but they were steadily pushed out of power by the dwarves and humans. By the mid–14th century, great numbers of them still inhabited the mountains, unexplored caves, and distant corners of the land. They were confined in such places, but not defeated. Orcs and dwarves still warred for control of the mountains. Although rare, orcish raiders in the lowlands were dangerous enough and common enough, especially in the winter months, to force human settlers to stick to the coasts. However, barring catastrophes, they were unlikely to dislodge human rule from the Vast. \n\nThere were several common lures for adventurers from all around the Realms, such as the intrigues and disputes between rival factions, or the number of dwarven ruins and their rumored treasure vaults. The Vast acquired a reputation as a place where some secrets were better off left undisturbed, where some things were best left buried in the mountains and deep caves.\n\n{{Quote|''Beware—there are beasts and secrets sleeping in those mountains that had best be awakened only by someone with a ready blade and fast spells, if they would live to boast of it…''|[[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]]}}",
        "History": {
            "Ancient history": "In ancient times, agents of the [[Elven Court]] of [[Cormanthor]] made contact with the dwarves of [[Sarphil]] in the lands later known as the Vast. Desiring to maintain control over the forests there, the Elven Court warred against the dwarves to stop them expanding to the surface. But after the elves saved the dwarves from being defeated by orcs, the two sides negotiated on the Vast's battlefields around {{Yearlink|-6400}}. They made a tenuous alliance, but it lasted 2000 years, and each prospered from trade of goods and information.\n\nSome time after {{Yearlink|-5005}}, [[Jhaamdath]] began expanding over the [[Inner Sea]] and settled colonies in the Vast, among other lands. These brought trade goods and prestige to the empire.\n\nElves from Cormanthor went beyond the [[River Lis]] to found [[Yrlaphon]] in the northern Vast in {{Yearlink|-1535}}. After drow raiders weakened its defenses in the winter of {{Yearlink|-722}}, Yrlaphon fell to orc hordes in the summer.\n\nThe ancient [[minotaur]] kingdom of [[Grong-Haap]] ({{Yearlink|-981}} to {{Yearlink|-350}}) once encroached upon the northern highlands of the Vast.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep}}",
            "Vastar and the Jhaamdathan colonization": "[[Image:ElvenbloodPass.jpg|thumb|left|Vastar's orcs descending upon the forces of Westgate.]]\nThe orc kingdom of [[Vastar]] rose ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-700}}. The history of Vastar was a turbulent one, with frequent coups, bloody civil wars, constant strife, and regular attacks and counter-attacks against their neighbors and other creatures who lived in their land. Every dozen years, a horde would form in the summer, steal or build ships, and sail south over the Inner Sea to raid. Their survivors rarely returned, instead spreading south. For their shipbuilding efforts, the orcs cut down the great forests of the land. When they ran out of timber, they went over the Dragon Reach and over the River Lis to take what they wanted from [[Cormanthor]], but were more often slaughtered by the elves. They made several such invasions by sea and land.\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Glaurath|Glaurath the Great]] of [[Westgate]] ({{Yearlink|-301}} – {{Yearlink|-291}}), thieves stole the royal treasury of Westgate and fled by ship to the Vast. They anchored at the spot where the city of Procampur would later lie, and went up into the Earthfast Mountains, pursued by Westgate's forces, until both sides were annihilated by a thousand local orcs in [[Elvenblood Pass|a mountain pass]].\n\nOn the southern side of the Inner Sea, the empire of Jhaamdath fell beneath a great wave in [[-255 DR|the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR]]. A wave of refugees—later known as the [[Chondathan]] people—crossed the Inner Sea to colonize the lands of [[Impiltur]], [[Thesk]] and the Vast south of the Earthfast Mountains, becoming among the first lands on the north coast to be settled by humans. After occupying these lands, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-200}}, their descendants migrated westward from Impiltur and the Vast to cross the Dragon Reach and settle [[Sembia]], [[Cormyr]] and the [[Dalelands]], in time giving rise to those realms.\n\nDwarves from [[Earthfast]] founded the underground town of Proeskampalar in [[-153 DR|the Year of the Starry Shroud, −153 DR]]. That same year, it was joined by descendants of the Jhaamdathan refugees, who also settled there. It later became known as [[Procampur]]. More founded the city of Chessagol, later known as [[Tsurlagol]], in [[-72 DR|the Year of Enchanted Hearts, −72 DR]].\n\nWhen [[human]]s first dominated the Vast, [[Sendrin]] was settled in the remote Vast, along with a temple to [[Savras]]. With Savras then commonly seen as a wise user of [[magic]] rather than just a diviner, Sendrin became a mecca for [[wizard]]s, despite its remoteness. However, when [[Azuth]] defeated Savras and supplanted him as god of magic before or after the [[Dawn Cataclysm]], Azuth's followers sacked and destroyed the Savran temple of Sendrin. The wizards stopped coming, and those who'd serviced them—scribes, component sellers, tailors, healers, escorts—gradually left. The community they'd made went mobile, becoming the travelling [[Magefair]]. <ref group=\"note\">The founding and decline of Sendrin is difficult to date. ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'' page 155 states \"When human rule had just come to the Vast\". This could be after the Jhaamdathans settled Procampur and Tsurlagol in the second and first centuries before Dalereckoning. However, this would be deep in orc territory in the kingdom of Vastar, and the ''The City of Ravens Bluff'' never refers to this earlier founding time. Instead, it focuses on human settlement from the 7th century DR onward. As for Sendrin's decline, according to ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' page 47, Azuth defeated Savras sometime during or shortly after the [[Dawn Cataclysm]], a difficult-to-date divine event. Finally, ''[[Secrets of the Magister]]'' places the first true Magefair in the 3rd century. This supports a much earlier date for Sendrin's rise and fall, between −153 DR (the settling of Procampur) and ''circa'' 253 DR (the date of the first Magefair). This agrees with estimates of the Dawn Cataclysm.\n\nIn [[331 DR|the Year of Cold Clashes, 331 DR]], the orcs of Vastar launched a surprise attack on [[Cormanthyr]], and occupied a portion of the lands east of the Old [[Elven Court]]. They solidified their forces in the area over the next few years. It wasn't until [[339 DR|the Year of the Vanished Foe, 339 DR]], that the occupying orcs were routed by combined elvish and [[human]] forces.\n\nIn the early 5th century DR, King [[Meldath I]] of Impiltur led a conquest of the Vast and other nearby lands, turning Proeskampalar and Chessagol into vassal city-states.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|59}} <ref group=\"note\">[[Dragon magazine 346|\"Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom\"]] names this warrior king Meldath the Magnificent. However, ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' lists only [[Meldath I]] \"the Mighty\" ([[411 DR]]–[[445 DR]]) and [[Meldath II]] ([[445 DR]]–[[448 DR]]). The name and details would suggest that this is in fact Meldath I. Both Proeskampalar/Procampur and Chessagol/Tsurlagol are later stated to be independent, but how they attained their freedom has not been detailed.\n\nIn [[512 DR|the Year of the Wyvernfall, 512 DR]], Vastar was on the rampage again, with orc hordes from here and other strongholds emerging and threatening Cormanthyr and many other lands with war. The orc chieftain [[Ulbror]] marched his horde through many small passes in the Earthspur Mountains and invaded [[Impiltur]]. The orcs slew King [[Sharaun Mirandor]], his three heirs and their army, killing off the [[Mirandor]] dynasty. Ulbror and the orcs were defeated later that year in the [[Battle of Bloody Reeds]].\n\n[[Ologh]] the Overking of Vastar was killed by the [[black dragon]] [[Iyrauroth]] in [[572 DR|the Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]], leaving his throne at the [[Hollow Mountain]] vacant. Vastar descended into civil war as orcish factions battled for control across the land.",
            "Roldilar, the Realm of Glimmering Swords": "The victorious dwarves claimed the surface lands for themselves and that same year they founded [[Roldilar]], the Realm of Glimmering Swords, under [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]], who ruled from Mount Grimmerfang. The Roldilarren dwarves set to work trading with other nations and developing their new land, by building stone towers and importing livestock. Their logging industry cleared forests for miles and they attempted large-scale agriculture.\n\n[[Image:Tuir and Maskyr.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maskyr One-Eye|Maskyr]] paid a high price for his [[Maskyr's Eye|vale]].]]Roldilarren dwarves ruled the Vast while the orcs and goblinoids were driven out and subdued, but others soon immigrated to the developing land. Ironically, in some parts, humans and elves lived in the mountains alongside orcs and worse neighbors, as the dwarves controlled the lowlands. There they built their tombs and strongholds.\n\nAmong these settlers, two [[Sembia]]n merchants explored the dwarven-held lands, seeking a trade-route from the dwarven mines down to the [[River Vesper]].\n\nRoldilar enjoyed only forty years of peace before its power waned. In that time, the orcs had replenished their numbers and recovered their strength. Above and below ground, vast hordes of orcs engulfed Roldilar in the [[649 DR|the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]].\n\nThe Roldilarren dwarves, however, were saved from total extinction by their human and [[elf|elven]] allies. This delayed the end of Roldilar.\n\nDwarven refugees of Roldilar retreated, many going to other lands. Roldilar was the last dwarven realm to claim the surface lands of the Vast or dominate there, as of [[1370 DR]].",
            "The Time of Glorious Fools": "The humans settlers, however, stayed to fight the orcs and hold onto the land they now called home. Many more, however, left overcrowding in the [[Vilhon Reach]] to cross the Inner Sea and settle the Vast south of the Fire River. Here, they made a foothold from which they could expand, growing populous with high immigration and birthrates. They quickly absorbed the former, settled inhabitants, the dwarves, gnomes, and halflings.\n\nThey advanced swiftly over the Vast, finding a war-torn land where orcs ruled, and [[troll]]s, [[leucrotta]], and other creatures had left the mountains and flourished by preying upon dead and dying dwarves and orcs. They fought them frequently, and steadily pushed them all out of the lowlands and into the hills and mountains once more. Many adventurers rose out of these conflicts, folk who sought impossible odds and made desperate assaults, and miraculously won as often as they were slaughtered. Thus local bards named this \"the Time of Glorious Fools\", a period that some said continued well on into the 14th century.\n\nThe most successful adventurers were those who won both gold and fame for their great deeds. Such adventuring bands set themselves up in keeps, with mounted warriors, minor battle-mages, and priests of [[Helm]] or [[Tempus]], and promised to protect local farmers from raids in exchange for a \"shield tax\", though they were often too late to help.\n\nAs they expanded, the human settlers cleared land for their farms, erected low fieldstone walls to divide their fields, and built good roads. These eventually linked Procampur and Tsurlagol on the Inner Sea to [[Mulmaster]] by the [[Moonsea]]. Farmers then enjoyed bountiful harvests for several years. The settlers went on to open up the more accessible mines, and grew more prosperous. Seeking agricultural produce, trading vessels came from [[Aglarond]], Impiltur, Sembia, and [[Westgate]], and they sold goods like quality cloth and [[iron]]work, locks, and [[weapon]]s. The harbors of the Vast, [[Calaunt]], Sarbreen, and [[Tantras]]—once landing spots for immigrants and rest stops for pirates—were developed as trade ports. This all cemented human habitation of the Vast.\n\nThus, there were two paths to lordship for the folk of the Vast. On the one hand were big farmers who'd earned their fortunes, bought up surrounding land and their fellows, and called themselves lords and ladies. On the other were retired adventurers who'd won wealth and power, built strongholds and gathered their own followers, and could call themselves what they liked. Some of the farmer lords were themselves retired adventurers, while others were deposed by adventurers looking to retire.\n\n[[Ravens Bluff]] was established as a city over the remains of Sarbreen, in [[1222 DR|the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR]].\n\nThe mid–13th century saw the Vast once again suffer rampaging hordes of orcs, goblins, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[bugbear]]s, supplemented by some human brigands and half-breed rogues. In [[1246 DR|the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR]],{{CotMD-time}} the orc warlord [[Fottergrim]] and the [[magelord]] [[Archlis]] led a mixed horde of them in an invasion and take-over of Tsurlagol. Procampur sent an army to besiege and liberate the city. Fottergrim and Archlis were slain, Procampur's armies were victorious, and Tsurlagol was liberated. Fottergrim's silver-plated skull was mounted on a pillar halfway between the two cities with a warning against threatening Procampur's allies.\n\nIn the mid-13th century (''i.e.'', over a century before the 1360s DR), a hobgoblin horde marched near Procampur. It was defeated with the aid of the mage [[Snilloc]], who earned some fame for his actions here.\n\nAlso sometime around the mid–13th century DR, the forests in the northern Vast began sinking into swampland, becoming the [[Flooded Forest]].\n\nIn [[1253 DR|the Year of Beckoning Death, 1253 DR]], plague struck the Vast, as well Cormyr and Sembia.\n\nThe terrifying [[red dragon]] [[Halarglautha|Halarglautha Firewings]] had rampaged across the lands of the Vast south of the [[River Vesper]], particularly along the [[Fire River]]. The flaming destruction she inflicted on dwarf, human, and orc settlements here apparently gave the Fire River its name. Her reign of terror ended when she was slain by a band of [[human]] adventurers in the late 13th century. <ref group=\"note\">The duration of Halarglautha's rampage is unknown, and the date of her fall is estimated based on the number of generations of  her slayers' descendants at the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]].\n\nBy [[1294 DR]], much of the Vast was again wilderness, lawless, and plagued by monsters. The [[Magister]] of the time, [[Inhil Lauthdryn|Inhil \"Hurler-of-Stars\" Lauthdryn]], went into the Vast wilderness to find, defeat, and bring to justice rogue [[archmages]] of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. Inhil's remains were later found, slain but apparently successful in his quest.",
            "Modern History": "In [[1317 DR|the Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR]], the [[Plague of Dragons]] quickly spread around the Inner Sea from the Vilhon Reach to Impiltur and Tsurlagol. The priests of Procampur feared that their city would be the next to suffer the diseases and the dragon that spread them."
