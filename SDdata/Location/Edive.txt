'''Edive''' was a small fishing village on [[Lake Weng]] in northern [[Amn]].

==Description==
Edive was one of the many small, unimportant, nondescript [[fish]]ing villages around the edge of Lake Weng. It had a population of fewer than 200 people, and its only notable feature was its mysterious glowing [[bell]] tower.

==Geography==
Edive was located on the northern shore of Lake Weng in the foothills of the [[Cloud Peaks]] at an altitude of {{SI|1500|ft|long=yes}}, between [[Ideepton]] and [[Shatar]], and opposite [[Minsor Vale]]. It lay close to the [[Amnurflow]] as it descended out of the mountains,{{Cite interactive atlas|Amn}}

==Trade==
Edive folk performed lake fishing and farmed root vegetables, and sold the surplus to travelers and nearby military sites such as Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl.
