Longsaddle was a sleepy little hamlet on the Long Road in the Savage Frontier of northwest Faer√ªn.
Situated east of the Crags and west of the Evermoors, Longsaddle sat on an isolated stretch of the Long Road.
The surrounding area was a vast expanse of grassland that catered to the towns ranchers.
The hamlets spokesperson on the council of the Lords Alliance was Dowell Harpell as of the late 15 century DR.

Longsaddle was founded in the , by Shardra Harpell, an escaped Calishite slave. 
In the , two separate sects of the Malarite faith wanted to set up churches by the waterfront of a magically created lake. The two churches immediately began fighting each other and the Harpells had to step in. Unfortunately, they couldnt get rid of them so instead they imposed a severe punishment on the more dangerous individuals transmuting them permanently into harmless rabbits.
By the , the forest around Longsaddle was inhabited by werewolf descendants of Bidderdoo Harpell. These werewolves were called "the Bidderdoos" and although the townsfolk feared them, they provided some measure of protection for the town.
From 1479 DR until the end of the , the reincarnated Catti-brie, under the name of Delly Curtie, dwelt at the Ivy Mansion in Longsaddle, learning magic from the Harpells.
The community was famous for the presence of peculiar wizards who were eccentric and often dangerous in their spell-casting manners. The Blue Sigil mercenary company was located in nearby Mogs Keep.
As of the , the hamlet consisted of around 1,000 or so people from the surrounding countryside. Among these were the Beliver, Cadrasz, Dostril, Emmert, Feldryn, Gosstal, Harpell, Irimari, Kromlor, Mammlar, Ostever, Sharnshield, Silverhand-Arunsun-Maerdrym, Stormrider, Suldivver, Zelorrgosz, and Del Goldwhite families.
