The '''Wandering Emporium''' was a traveling bazaar of merchants, creatives, and miscreants that wandered the infernal realm of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]]. The master of this marketplace was the [[rakshasa]] [[Mahadi]], a servant of the [[devil]]ish god [[Asmodeus]].

The emporium was a welcoming place in the otherwise perilous and horrifying plane of Avernus. It was considered neutral ground that offered respite from the hell's many conflicts, most predominantly the [[Blood War]].

==Description==
The emporium traveled across Avernus using nine massive [[infernal war machine]]s. When Mahadi chose, the monstrous vehicles came to a halt and formed a semi-circular perimeter. Within this makeshift barricade the market's vividly-colored [[tent]]s were thrown up and the emporium opened for business. 

It was illuminated by dangling lights, emanated exotic scents, and featured rhythmic music that drew in nearby denizens and travelers.

==Geography==
The emporium had no permanent location in Avernus, but wandered around under the direction of its master.

==Trade==
First and foremost, Mahadi used the emporium as a means to gather souls for his master Asmodeus. The rakshasa did this by presenting mortals with an infernal contract that had to be willingly signed. The contract granted them a boon, such as a powerful [[magic]]al item or the resurrection of a loved one, in exchange for their eternal soul. 

To fulfil this duty and complete his deals, Mahadi was allowed to openly travel between Avernus and the [[Prime Material plane]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Firesnake Forge]]: The [[salamander]]s that serviced the emporium's war machines also sold [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] to its patrons. 
* [[From Here to Avernus]]: [[Fhet'Ahla]] the [[amnizu]] offered currency exchange and messengers in exchange for soul coins, preferably those that contained the souls of [[celestial]] beings.
* [[Ichor's Aweigh!]]: Owing a significant financial debt to Mahadi, the [[human]] [[mage]] [[Elliach]] sold ichor here. He had been grotesquely transformed by exposure to the ichor he sold.
* [[Infernal Rapture]]: This restaurant and spa was run by Mahadi himself and existed as its own [[demiplane]] separate from Avernus.
* [[Z'neth's larva farm]]: Ripped away from the battlefields of [[Toril]], the warlord [[Z'neth]] was forced to run this piddling business pay back his debts.

==Inhabitants==
The emporium was occupied by the merchants who peddled their goods and services within, along with the devilish drivers who piloted its infernal war machines. Nearly all of them were indentured to Mahadi in some manner or another.
