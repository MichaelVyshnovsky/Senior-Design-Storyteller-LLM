        "Description": "The pit was a huge and greasy sinkhole that dominated the outskirts of the [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]] outside Port Nyanzaru's western walls. The smell was intense, and even a breezy day offered no relief from the stomach-churning stench.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|7}} \n\nThe pit was was over {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} deep and filled with a sea of festering trash, rotting flesh and bones, and rancid water. This vast amount of waste filled up to {{SI|90|feet|long=yes}} of the deep pit, and while this level could rise, it never overflowed thanks to an unknown number of [[otyugh]]s living and feasting deep beneath the surface of the trash. These monsters could be heard rusting through the garbage on quiet nights, but they rarely posed a threat to anyone who didn't enter the pit. Less docile were the [[undead]] that prowled the dump, including [[ghoul]]s and the occasional [[ghast]], [[wraith]], [[flameskull]], and [[spawn of Kyuss]]. Naturally, the dump was also home to countless vermin, including [[:Category:Insects|insects]], [[rat]]s, and [[raven]]s.\n\nA passage leading to catacombs beneath the Old City's ziggurats was located in the wall of the refuse pit beneath the surface of the trash.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the refuse pit had gained an unfortunate reputation as a place where corpses were dumped, providing a steady food supply for the undead.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|4-5}} \n\nFollowing the end of the [[death curse]], a [[wight]] [[necromancer]] named [[Jaru Tasca]] acquired a piece of the [[Cyst]], a powerful [[necromantic]] mass of flesh, and plotted to use it to transform Port Nyanzaru's residents into undead. Her minions would rise from the refuse pit to capture victims and return them to her secret base in the catacombs beneath the Old City.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|3}} The number of undead in the pit soon grew and began to threaten the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|3}}"
