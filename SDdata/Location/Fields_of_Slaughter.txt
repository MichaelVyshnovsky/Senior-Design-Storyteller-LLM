The '''Fields of Slaughter''' was a large plot of land running between the [[Spine of the World]] and the [[Severed Hand]].

==History==
The fields were named after a great battle that took place between [[Elf|elven]] and [[orc]]ish forces. The blood was said to have been so much that the fields were red for months. Long after, however, the fields were used extensively as a pathway for merchants, travelers, and adventurers.
