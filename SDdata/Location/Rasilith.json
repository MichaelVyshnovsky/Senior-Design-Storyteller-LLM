        "mainbody": "Rasilith was the capital city of the ancient realm of Thaeravel, a major city of Netheril, and later a settlement of the returned Shadovar.\nAfter its abandonment and the coming of Anauroch, Rasilith was partially buried by sand dunes but still stood intact. It had thick gray stone walls, standing structures, and a central fortress ringed with alabaster towers. The central courtyard of the fortress had a deep well that connected to a series of underground caverns and chambers with rivers of cool, pure water, linked to the Buried Realms of the Underdark. These were inhabited by the phaerimms and their laerti slaves.\nRasilith was north of the Windy Plains and Araugul the Goblinmount, and after the coming of Anauroch it lay in the Quarter of Emptiness in the Sword.\nRasilith was the capital of Thaeravel, a realm of sorcerers founded around -4300 DR. The later expansion of Netheril and their quest for arcane secrets led to them assaulting Thaeravel and Rasilith in -3392 DR, wiping out the sorcerers and conquering the city. Rasilith became an important southern garrison for Netheril, and arcanists flocked to it to examine and learn from the ancient runes left behind by the Thaeravelians. The studies of Rasilith faded in the Mythallar Era, and during the Shadowed Age it was abandoned and left to the phaerimms as Netheril collapsed.\nAfter the fall of Netheril the area became known as the Quarter of Emptiness, an especially desolate and uninhabitable region of the Sword, and became confused with Tower Hlithal, a much more recent ruin of Anauria. The deep tunnels and caverns beneath it became inhabited by up to thousands of laertis ruled by phaerimms, who sent their servants to kill any who risked discovering their lair.\nIn the early 1300s DR, a Bedine tribe located the ruins and deemed it a good location to settle, thanks to its intact walls and pure water supply. The first night that they camped there, laertis climbed up from their underground caverns and slaughtered almost the entire tribe, with only a few children escaping on camels.\nAfter the return of Thultanthar in 1372 DR and the following extermination of phaerimms and greening of Anauroch, Rasilith was once again inhabited, this time resettled with Bedine people. They became urbanized and were assimilated into Netherese culture."
