'''Claw Peak''' was a peak known by [[dragon]]s in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
[[Ammaratha Cyndusk]] kept four thousand-odd [[speaking gem]]s in the spire of a ruined keep atop Claw Peak; in {{yearlink|1373}}, when she needed a number of dragons to spare [[Vangerdahast]] after discovering he had been crafting a spell to bind them, she told them about her stash, and gave them leave to split it.
