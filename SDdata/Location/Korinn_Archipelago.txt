The Korinn Archipelago was a chain of islands in the Sea of Swords, situated in the northernmost region of the Moonshae Isles.
The Korinn Archipelago stood west of Delmarin Island, as well as east of both the island of Ruathym and the small archipelago known as the Whalebones. Beneath the water between those latter two locales, it laid close to the storm giant fortress of Maelstrom.
By and large, all the islands that made up the archipelago were hilly and mountainous, with only a few good fields suitable for farming. Although some of them were wooded with a hardy breed of pine, most of the isles were either barren moors, tundras, or simple bedrock.
A number of the small islands in this archipelago featured underwater caves, unknown to those on the surface. Within those caves stood temples long forgotten about.
Dragon turtles were known to prowl around the waters of Korinn. Many of its islands were inhabited by dragons, griffons, harpies, and wyverns. Domesticated animals on the islands included goats, pigs, and sheep.
Island of Viledel in particular was known to have a myriad of mundane sea birds, wild goats in its western hills, and rats. In addition, a variety of edible wild plants grew on the island that included onions.
Primary exports of the Korinn Archipelagos islands included fish, pork, mutton, leather, linen, wool, As well as a myriad of wild herbs and spices. The larger islands and greater port cities also had many craftsmen, who provided luxury goods and services.

The white dragon Arveiaturace was known to sometimes hunt in the archipelago.
*Barrets Quay, a smallish island on the eastern side of the archipelago that lacked any major port cities. It was noted for how reserved and tight-lipped its inhabitants were. The population was primarily made up of humans, with a few dwarves.
* Caftenor, the most southern of the islands, Caftenor had temperate weathers and was the most abundant in resources, in particular that of fish. It was surrounded by well-stocked fishing grounds. Alongside its humans inhabitants lived a sizeable population of halflings. They had a decent port of the same name, which was one the most frequent stopping off ports for ships bound between the nations south of Korinn and its western islands.
* Chawdik, an island on the eastern side of the archipelago that was fairly poor. It was most notable for its large gnome population that lived on its south coast, being one of the largest gnome populations in all of Korinn.
* Highport, the greenest and most heavily forested of Korinns islands, this mountainous landmass was fairly rich and had several powerful port cities. A large degree of the populations was made up of elves and high-elves.
* Jacaman, one of the smaller and apparently insignificant islands, it was one of the major producers of spice in the archipelagos. Pirates took great interest in the trade that occured there and the sea-routes leading to it.
* Pandira, one of the northernmost and second largest of Korinns islands. It was a notorious pirate haven in the days of Viledel the Sea King, but was seemingly abandoned a few years after his death. Around the early 14 century DR, a major port by the name of Westhaven was secretly established, on a bay guarded by natural breakers and free from dangerous shoals. It began life as an honest port, but over time its inhabitants decided to cater to all kinds of cutt-throats after suffering several pirate and Northmen raids. It was a neutral ground where aggression on anyone was not tolerated. This port was fairly successful and a thriving base for pirates of both the Korinn Archipelago and the Moonshae Isles, a place where black market goods and info were traded to the highest bidder. All nations of the Sword Coast and every civilized group in the Moonshaes kept some form of spy on the isle.
* Rabins Reef, a forested island that was a popular summer destination for wealthy families, especially those of Ventris.
* Tetris, the southernmost island of the archipelago and the isle furthest south from Pandira. It functioned as a secret base of operations for the Sithisila Fleet, a group of goblin pirates.
* Ventris, the largest of Korinns islands and the most wealthy, commanding a good deal of the archipelagos sea-trade. It was heavily mountainous, covered by thick forests of pines, and had several plains that had been cleared to support a number of prosperous farming communities. In addition to humans, the island had a large population of demihumans that included a sizable number of dwarves and halflings as well as some elves.
