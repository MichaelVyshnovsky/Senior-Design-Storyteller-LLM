In reality, the true influences were the merchants along Nagarrs docks and Janol I.\nNagarr was a simple farming-fishing village, but by 1370 DR with the rise of Janol I of Ankhapur, major reconstruction and increase in population as a trade transit point gradually expanded it to accommodate trade.\nThe most common stories were told in the inns and taverns of Nagarr all involved the monstrous and mysterious naga. The locals had no idea that separate species of good, evil and neutral naga all lived in the area (which Orswin failed to do with his attempts) and the consensus was the only good naga was a dead naga.\nAs of 1370 DR, 375 members of Ankhpurs Watch were permanently loaned to the Mayor of Nagarr.\nInns\nScaly Catfish • Nagas Water (1370 DR-)\nTaverns\nScaly Catfish\nTemples\nPalace of Justice, Duty, and Sufferance (The Triad Tyr, Torm, Ilmater) • House of Mysteries (Mystra) • Shrine to Dawn (Lathander)\nThe Red Masks was a fledgling organization headed by Rathan Silverknife who lost in a turf war in Innarlith and ran to hide in Nagarr in 1370 DR.\n*Alamandra Whitehair, a cleric of Mystra overseeing the House of Mysteries in 1370 DR, who advocated the appreciation of the wonders and beauty of magic and not just its convenience.\n*Cadrin Velaclaok, a cleric of Ilmater running the small Triadic temple Palace of Justice, Duty, and Sufferance in 1370 DR.\n*Cathel deFaux, an elderly cleric of Lathander presiding over the newly founded Shrine to Dawn in 1370 DR, who arrived from outside Nagarr.\n*Jordan Ariadne, a Half-sea elf of the passing sea elf Ariadne.
