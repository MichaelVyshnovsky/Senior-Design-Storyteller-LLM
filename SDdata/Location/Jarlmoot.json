        "mainbody": "arlmoot was a landmark in Icewind Dale, serving as the former seat of power for the frost giant jarls in the region.\nThe site comprised seven giant-sized stone thrones, arranged in a circle facing one another. There was one throne for each of the frost giants jarls, one of which was claimed by Jarl of Jarls, Reggaryarva.\nHidden beneath Reggaryarvas throne was an underground hallway that featured six braziers inscribed with Jotun runes. By lighting each of the runes with its required ingredient, a person could gain access to a grand chest holding the giants treasure.\nThe six Jotun runes were dod, fjell, krig, liv, vind, and wyrm.\nA poem inscribed upon the wall offered clues on how to correctly lite each of the braziers.\nJarlmoot was located atop a hill, some ways west of the Shaengarne River.\nIn the , the frost giant Gromingorn traveled to Jarlmoot in order to face the frost giant specters and claim its hidden treasure.\nOn nights of a full moon, the ghosts of the jarls appeared at their thrones, sharing tales about the feats and exploits they accomplished in life.\nThat same year, the frost druid Yselm Bloodfang sought to lure a group of adventurers to the ancient site, in the hopes of killing them in the name of Auril."
