Castle Al-Amo, also called the Fortress of Love and the Castle of St. Sollars, was the abode of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred on the plane of Mercuria in the Seven Heavens. St. Sollars called the castle "my spread out Mercuria way".
It was a gold castle, resembling a fortified mission.
In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR, an adventuring party comprising Sir Gareth Dragonsbane, Olwen Forest-Friend, Friar Dugald, Riordan Parnell, Celedon Kierney, and Emelyn the Gray was escorted by Terxyx, a tome archon, and a troop of sword archons, to Castle Al-Amo, where they met St. Sollars outside to discuss what to do with the Wand of Orcus.
