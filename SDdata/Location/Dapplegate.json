They held council in the Council Hall, a small keep located next to the Place of Arrows.\nDapplegate was home  to a wide variety of crafters. Its location made it a center for import/export businesses, importing trade goods from Calimshan and goods from across the Border Kingdoms were exported from the towns large port district.\nThe Place of Arrows was the large central marketplace of Dapplegate. It was surrounded by a ring of eight ponds, which were themselves surrounded by a waist-high wall and was used by the merchants as water holes for their draft animals.\nThe north bank of the River Scelptar, and the marshes between Dapplegate and the Shining Sea, were populated by Lizardfolk and Mudmaws. Therefore, there was a large demand for hired guards for merchant barges and caravans, and more than six mercenary companies bases were located in the town.\n* Tilbar Tarnalar, council member and owner of Tarnalars Tipple, originally from Sword Coast North.\n* Master Merchant Nurath Cheldin, council member and moneylender, originally from Calimshan.\n* Danchilaer the Mad Mage, a renegade mage from Halruaa who lived in Dapplegate for four hundred years. Rumoured to be either long-lived or undead.\nQuarlins Tomb, the resting place of the Halruaan wizard, was allegedly near to Dapplegate."
