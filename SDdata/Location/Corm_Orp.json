        "mainbody": "'''Corm Orp''' was a small town in the [[Western Heartlands]] on the [[Dusk Road]]. In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was dominated by [[halfling]]s and led by a [[human]] mayor. It was the fastest-growing settlement of halflings north of [[Luiren]].",
        "Trade": "The halflings of Corm Orp grew a variety of [[grape]]s, including a strain known as \"blue eyes,\" to produce sour [[wine]]s and grape-based [[dye]]s for export. They kept [[goat]] and [[sheep]] in the hills overlooking the settlement, whose hair and wool respectively were occasionally used to make [[blanket]]s for export.\n\nBeyond farm goods, the people of Corm Orp produced pottery from nearby, rich deposits of [[clay]].",
        "Relations": "Rumors told that the halflings of Corm Orp could only exist so close to Darkhold as a result of some deals with the [[Zhentarim]]. It was said that they received promises of protection for information on rival caravans, adventurers, and whatever else passed through the town's zone of control. But to state such rumors aloud was a good way to anger any halflings living there.{{Cite web/More of the Western Heartlands}}",
        "Defenses": "The militia of Corm Orp had thirty human members who wore chain with green felt strips on their right arms and left thighs. There were also thirty or forty halfling militia members who preferred not to identify themselves in public and attacked from in hiding or overlooked places.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Temples": "* The [[Ladyhouse]] was a temple to the halfling goddess [[Sheela Peryroyl]]."
