        "mainbody": "orm Orp was a small town in the Western Heartlands on the Dusk Road. In the midâ€“14 century DR, it was dominated by halflings and led by a human mayor. It was the fastest-growing settlement of halflings north of Luiren.\nThe halflings of Corm Orp grew a variety of grapes, including a strain known as \"blue eyes,\" to produce sour wines and grape-based dyes for export. They kept goat and sheep in the hills overlooking the settlement, whose hair and wool respectively were occasionally used to make blankets for export.\nBeyond farm goods, the people of Corm Orp produced pottery from nearby, rich deposits of clay.\nRumors told that the halflings of Corm Orp could only exist so close to Darkhold as a result of some deals with the Zhentarim. It was said that they received promises of protection for information on rival caravans, adventurers, and whatever else passed through the towns zone of control. But to state such rumors aloud was a good way to anger any halflings living there.\nThe militia of Corm Orp had thirty human members who wore chain with green felt strips on their right arms and left thighs. There were also thirty or forty halfling militia members who preferred not to identify themselves in public and attacked from in hiding or overlooked places.\nTemples\n* The Ladyhouse was a temple to the halfling goddess Sheela Peryroyl.\nInns and Taverns\n* The Hungry Halfling was a favorite tavern and inn."
