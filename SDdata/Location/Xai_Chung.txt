'''Xai Chung''' was a settlement in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Geography==
It lay on the western side of [[Kang Bay]] near the foot of the [[Vorkani Mountains]],

==Government==
Xai Chung was governed by [[Meo Yungdo]], who also advisor to King [[Wanang Sun]].Meo Yungdo is only stated to be an advisor, but as an important noble based in the city, and because some governors are top advisors to the king, it is assumed that Yungdo is also governor of Xai Chung.

==Description==
It was a rather sedate place, compared to [[Tu Pe]], at least. One road there was Lu Chan Street.

The ancestral mansion of the [[Meo]] family stood in Xai Chung.

The Nikanii bazaar was a market in Xai Chung. On display here in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]] was the skeleton of one of the birdmen of the Vorkani Mountains; a Koryoan adventurer discovered the bones in the nest of a giant spider he had slain.

==History==
The bodies of three members of Koryo's "night brotherhoods" were once found in Lu Chan Street ''circa'' [[1347 DR]], apparently having slain each other for dark secrets.

Around [[1350 DR]], the [[king of Silla]] ordered "nameless ones" of one of these brotherhoods to kidnap [[Meo Li]], the teenage daughter of [[Meo Yungdo]]. They swung down from the rooftops, used [[green sleeping dust|magic sleep powder]] on her, and whisked her away from her guards.It is not clear which of the siblings Meo Li and [[Meo Cha]] is speaking in the "Races and Classes" section on page 124 in the Koryo chapter of ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]''. As Meo Cha's kidnapping in [[Tu Pe]] is slightly different (as mentioned on the same page), it is assumed to be Meo Li. Thus details of her kidnapping and events on Lu Chan Street are assumed to be in Xai Chung, not Tu Pe or [[Pyong-do]].
