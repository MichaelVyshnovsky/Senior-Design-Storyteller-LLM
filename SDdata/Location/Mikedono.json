        "Description": "Mikedono was located to the southeast of islands of the [[Senshi]] island chain. It was situated to the northeast of [[Hinomoto]], and directly south of the largest island, [[Shinkoku]]. Mikedono was {{SIAdj|200|mile|k|long=yes|adj=long}} and was approximately {{SI|100|miles|k|long=yes}} wide.\n\nA low mountain range called the [[Sunrise Range]] ran from east to west through [[Kumachi Province]]. Dominating [[Akime Province]], the southward spur was known as the [[Shibuno Peaks]]. The southern region boasts the verdant [[Benduri Forest]], densely populated with [[bamboo]], while to the north, lush coastal [[rice]] paddies thrived. The [[Ikuji Woods]] was also found on Mikedono.",
        "History": "Mikedono was created as a result of a celestial duel between [[Deity|gods]]."
