Located nearby was the estate of Heartwing owned by Aluena Halacanter.
The village was named for a yuan-ti city of Ssthartissssun, and its temple that was once found on this location.
The village had a ferry crossing.
The village itself was warded against dragons to prevent them from digging up the destroyed temple.
The village was also protected by Netherese wards designed to keep out serpentfolk.
The human inhabitants of the village were killed when its Netherese wards failed shortly after the Spellplague of 1385 DR.
