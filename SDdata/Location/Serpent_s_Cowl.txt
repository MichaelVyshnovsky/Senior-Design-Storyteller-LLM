'''Serpent's Cowl''' was a small village upstream of [[Boareskyr Bridge]] on the east bank of the [[Winding Water]]. It was very close to the [[Forest of Wyrms]].

==Geography==
[[File:Serpent's Cowl.png|thumb|''A map showing Serpent's Cowl's location.'']]
Located nearby was the estate of [[Heartwing]] owned by [[Aluena Halacanter]].

==History==
The village was named for a [[yuan-ti]] city of [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]], and its temple that was once found on this location.

==Locations==
The village had a ferry crossing.

==Defenses==
The village itself was warded against dragons to prevent them from digging up the destroyed temple.

The village was also protected by [[Netherese]] wards designed to keep out [[serpentfolk]].

The human inhabitants of the village were killed when its [[Netherese]] wards failed shortly after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]].
