        "mainbody": "'''Adhe Wood''' was a forest located in [[the Vast]]{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part One|13}} infested with arachnid monsters.",
        "Geography": "It lay south of the [[Earthfast Mountains]], between the [[North Road]] and the [[Tsurlar Forest]], north-east of the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]].",
        "Description": "The forest was old, dense, and overgrown, and the trunks of its [[tree]]s stood very close together. Most of these were [[duskwood (tree)|duskwoods]] and [[shadowtop]]s, while [[felsul]]s and [[oak]]s were found on the southern edge. The tallest trees grew over 80 feet (24 meters) tall. As a result, the depths of Adhe Wood were kept in eternal darkness.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[File:AdheWood.jpg|thumb|left|''An adventurer standing atop an arachnid creature slain in Adhe Wood.'']]\nDeep in Adhe Wood were found large numbers of [[ettercap]]s and [[spider]]s. These spiders could be of any size or variety, and most possessed bizarre magical powers and mutations, such as hooked, slashing claws or stinging tails. They were exceedingly vicious and constantly hunted both each other and those who ventured into the forest.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The many mutant spiders were thought to be the result of some [[magic]]al force active in the heart of Adhe Wood, likely ancient and evil. One possibility was an [[artifact]] that mutated the wildlife, another was an insane [[mage]] experimenting on the spiders. The [[sage]] [[Alither]] believed it was a diseased or magically altered [[deepspawn]] named \"the [[Father of Spiders]]\". On the other hand, the sage [[Othla Multar]] thought [[drow]] were to blame, theorizing that they bred and released the spiders to guard their passage to the local [[Underdark]], from which they occasionally emerged and crossed into the Tsurlar Forest to trade with [[pirate]] vessels.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], no [[adventurer]] had successfully determined the true cause of the mutant spiders. Folk in the [[city]] of [[Tsurlagol]] warned of the many web-shrouded, bloodless corpses of adventurers lying throughout the forest.\n\nOther Tsurlagoli legends said that an old temple lay in Adhe Wood and could be just glimpsed from the [[North Road]]. It was said to be draped in spider-webs but decorated with statues of rearing [[snake]]s with huge [[emerald]]s for eyes. It was rumored to be full of [[gem]]s, but the Tsurlagoli legends disagreed on exactly which [[deity]] the temple honored. Oddly, though Sevenecho was much closer, its people maintained that they'd never heard anything about it. They wisely never went near Adhe Wood anyway."
