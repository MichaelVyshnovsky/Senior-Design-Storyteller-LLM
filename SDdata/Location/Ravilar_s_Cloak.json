        "mainbody": "avilars Cloak, also known as The Cloak, was a wild and rowdy mining town within the Vilhon Reach.\nThe settlement was located in the foothills of the Orsraun Mountains in Turmish.\nAs a hot-spot for treasure seekers, the town was rough and rowdy. The Cloak was protected by warriors from all the independent mining groups within the community.\nAround 1270 DR, a ranger known as Antonio Ravilar protected the small community of miners from a band of bugbears.\nOver the years, the town became known for its murders, such as in 1363 DR, when a merchant Alataz Thrindol from Telflamm turned up missing. In 1370 DR, a bag of emeralds worth 60,000 gp was found in a cesspool and a Calishite thief, Rastar of the Blades, took up residence in the merchants manor.\nRavilars Cloak was said to be haunted by the flying helm. The inhabitants blamed the magical helm for anything that went missing.\n* The Dog and Bone\n* The Griffon"
