        "History": "Around [[1270 DR]], a [[ranger]] known as [[Antonio Ravilar]] protected the small community of miners from a band of [[bugbear]]s.\n\nOver the years, the town became known for its murders, such as in [[1363 DR]], when a merchant [[Alataz Thrindol]] from [[Telflamm]] turned up missing. In [[1370 DR]], a bag of [[emerald]]s worth 60,000 [[gp]] was found in a cesspool and a [[Calishite]] [[thief]], [[Rastar|Rastar of the Blades]], took up residence in the merchant's manor.",
        "Legends": "Ravilar's Cloak was said to be haunted by ''[[the flying helm]]''. The inhabitants blamed the magical helm for anything that went missing.",
