It lay among the southern foothills of the [[Akashnu Mountains]].<ref group=\"note\">Like many places in the Kuong Kingdom, Suranatra and the Akashnu Mountains have not been marked on any map, so their location is unknown.",
        "History": "The ancient city of Suranatra was where the Kuong Kingdom first arose, founded by [[Vishnan I]] with it as his capital. From the outset, it was an aggressive and theocratic empire. Funded by the [[gems]] and precious metals of the Akashnu Mountains, the rich and puissant priest-kings of Suranatra expanded their dominion to the [[Kunong River]] and to the coast.\n\nHowever, as the Kuong Kingdom expanded, it was forced to relocate its capital to [[Parmahana]] for administrative purposes. The people demolished part of the city, ironically to prevent its temples and holy sites from being desecrated after they left.",
        "Description": "By the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the jungle had reclaimed the ruins of Suranatra, though not as much as its successor, Parmahana. Wanderers and criminals used these ruins as a place to hide."
