'''Saerloon''' ({{Pronounce|say|er|LOON|refs=}}), which was once called '''Chondathan'''

{{quote|''Ah, the intrigues of Saerloon! Such a magnificent city, so magnificently suited to my tastes... Ah, the sound of that name - exotic, dangerous, calling to me even now. Saerloon - the place where I made my fortune.''|Lord [[Sharven]] of [[Espar]]}}

==Description==
Saerloon has a busy port on the aptly named [[Saerloon Bay]], that bustled with activity late into the night. The city was built on every piece of land that touched the water, hungrily claiming it as too precious to be wasted. The northern end of Saerlunan harbor was the location of a [[Thay]]an compound. The locals did not like the structure, and it was even evident in the isolation of the compound as if building themselves shunned it.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Saerloon grew several miles outside the city walls. Travelers who entered the city passed numerous inns, taverns, stockyards, and stables long before reaching the old city gates. The busy neighborhoods outside the city walls carried a strong aroma of smoke, cooking meats, animal [[dung]], as well as the stench of smelters, tanneries, and [[paper]] presses. 

The city within the walls was referred to as Old Saerloon, and this was the part of the city renowned for its gothic architecture, high-pointed arches, blade-like buttresses, tall needle-spires, and rooftops adorned with gargoyles. Many visitors thought the sight of the Old Saerloon to be magnificent but sinister. The city was flush with grand stone-carved statues, fountains, and carved trees that replaced the natural vegetation.[[File:Saerloon.PNG|thumb|right|390x390px|''A map of Saerloon in [[1358 DR]].'']]Saerloon was a sprawling and fairly chaotically-structured city. According to visitors, two large open plaza markets were the main landmarks in the otherwise confusing and samey city streets. The larger plaza was the [[North Market]], just several blocks away from the city walls. The smaller [[Dolphin Market]] was to the south from the North Market and a short walk away from Saerloon's busy docks. The Dolphin Market was a noisy, cramped, and chaotic market filled with crooked [[fish]] stalls, while the North Market was punctuated by a high-pillared statue of [[Saer]], the city's namesake.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, a group of grand old mansions on the Northside of the city were abandoned by its inhabitants for bigger and grander homes. These twenty-seven derelict decaying mansions came to be known as the [[Dowagers]]. Many of these houses became havens for freeloaders and predatory landlords who took advantage of those with little [[coin]]. Some of them were turned into storehouses by ambitious merchants, while others gained different repulsion. [[Themtraver Hall]] was surrounded by whispers about dire hauntings,{{Cite dragon/428/Eye on the Realms: The Speaking Skull of Themtraver Hall|39}}

===Flora & Fauna===
Apart from its humanoid population, Saerloon had a healthy number of fat [[blusterbird]]s that left their marks on numerous stone trees and sculptures of the city.

===Climate===
Saerloon was located in a temperate climate territory. The city saw snowfall in the winter as well as frequent regular or ice fogs.

==Goverment==
Saerloon was nominally ruled by a merchant prince who ultimately served the merchant council. The said Council of Sembia, or the Consortium Princes, were joint political rulers of Saerloon, [[Selgaunt]], and all of Sembia. The organization issued ambassadors to neighboring countries, such as Cormyr, who were authorized to negotiate trade and military assistance.

==Trade==
Saerloon was a busy shipping hub. The city was notorious among merchants for its outrageous import taxes. Many of the grand structures in Saerloon were built using imported quarried [[Yhaunn|Yhauntan]] stone The city had a busy industrial production of various materials, such as [[leather]], paper, and metal smelts. 

Famously, [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold clothes that were sown in Saerloon using the finest [[Daerlun]]ian [[wool]] and [[linen]]. Aurora's also sold children's wooden string puppets and marionettes, popular across the Realms. All toys were created by Saerloon's [[Stringpullers' guild]]. Some of these puppets came in accidental likeness of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] (allegedly), likeness of wizard [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] (likewise allegedly), and the great [[bard]] deity [[Finder Wyvernspur]], commissioned by a [[Harper]] agent [[Olive Ruskettle]]. Another export item of note from Saerloon was Saerloonas dried [[raisin]]s, sold by Aurora's for a single [[gold]] [[coin]] per pound.

Among other food and drink, Saerloon was known for exporting several types of popular [[wine]]s: [[Saerloonian Special Vat]], a pale red wine; [[Saerloonian Glowfire]], a faintly glowing wine of gentle summery taste; [[Saerloonian Topaz]], a dry [[amber]]-colored nutty wine, among others.

In the late-15{{th}} century DR, kitchenmasters of Saerloon started purchasing plump [[thimdror]] [[oxen]] from a small farm in [[Cormyr]] that belonged to [[Nars Thormil]]. As if by magic, the farm always had bests ready for purchase. These thimdrors were served in establishments such as [[Nundrarl's Haven Inn]].

==Culture==
Saerloon prided itself in its high society, exquisite, exotic, and varied tastes, as well as being cultured and educated.

The city was a busy place with most inhabitants consumed by daily life and trades. Like in other Sembian cities, Saerloonian [[human]]s historically distrusted [[elves]] - the result of the tumultuous history of rivalry against the inhabitants of [[Cormanthor]] and the ancient city of [[Myth Drannor]]. Throughout the city's history, many citizens, fearfully hid their valuables through the attics, caches, rooftops, cellars, in fear of Saerloon being overrun by threats from the north or the south. Smarter Saerlunans hid valuables outside the city walls, while the stashes within the city were often discovered by adventurers, thieves, and explorers. Who doesn't like a surprise [[enchanted]] item or a precious-stone encrusted regalia?

[[Imbaerla Nardragon]] of Saerloon wrote a famous play ''[[Seven Swords Snarlclash]]'' in [[1312 DR]]. This play became one of the Famous Seven, the group of seven most popular and influential plays performed in the [[Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]].

==Religion==
Historically, before the dominion of [[Shar]], Saerloon worked to attract churches with little other presence in the region to grow its population and power. The city offered free land, tax breaks, and immunity to some of the laws. Saerloon allowed its churches to be fully governed by their holy laws and dogma rather than local laws. These exemptions allowed clerics to hide taxable trade goods, offer asylum to refugees, etc. These factors allowed the churches of [[Mystra]] and [[Azuth]] to bloom and prosper and attract a grand number of users of [[the Art]]. Noble families of Saerloon were sponsored by the city's elders in inviting powerful clerics of both deities of magic.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Defenses==
The guard of Saerloon reached approximately 7,000 [[Helms of Sembia]] who patrolled the city and surrounding areas, including roads, farms, and waterways. The guard used eleven major ships for patrolling. In [[1358 DR]], Lady [[Merelith]] led these guards, aided by Overcaptain [[Burinta Shammarcron]] and Overcaptain [[Maerlus Balaern]]. In addition to the city guard, Saerloon was home to many [[wizard]]s of significant skill, many of whom worked as traders and investors in the city of merchants.

==History==
Long before Saerloon was settled, the grand destruction of three [[Netherese]] conclaves took place in [[-1660 DR]]. The explosions formed that would eventually be known as [[Saerloon Bay]].

Saerloon inherited its distinctive architecture from the [[Chondathan]] colonists who established Saerloon as their foothold in the area in the 380s [[DR]].

Saerloon and Selgaunt came under attacks of [[goblin]] and [[orc]] raiders in the {{YearlinkName|400}}. The hordes continued regular attacks on Sembia until the {{YearlinkName|415}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|902}}, the [[Rotting War]] came to an end in Chondath and Saerloon (then known as Chondathan) gained independence. Soon after, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that was established in the city several years earlier, created its first [[dracolich]] under the leadership of [[Sammaster]].

In the {{YearlinkName|913}}, Another opposition to the city of Saerloon came from a small tribe of [[locathah]] that once dwelt in the waters close to the city. The aquatic humanoids were forced to leave Saerloon's waters due to heavy ship activity disturbing their fishing supplies. A short-lived conflict between humans and locathah resulted in the sabotage of several trade ships, but eventually, Saerloon won, and locathah left.

''Circa'' [[1157 DR]], the legendary artifact, the ''[[Blade of Lathander]]'', was stolen from the Temple of [[Lathander]] in Saerloon. The blade was created with a singular purpose to destroy [[Tyranthraxus]], the infamous possessing spirit and one of the [[Seven Lost Gods]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1294}}, pirate leader [[Methlas]] was assassinated by his lieutenant [[Thevren]], who and sent his fleet of 40 ships to attack Saerloon and Selgaunt. The attacks were startling successes for the pirate fleet.

The {{YearlinkName|1355}} saw [[Jassandra Alastrin]], a wealthy merchant's daughter and worshiper of Shar, announced to the city she was founding the Temple to the Dark Magic, a new cult dedicated to the Mistress of the Night. Jassandra made the announcement off a back of an [[iron golem]] carried by 80 of her acolytes through the streets of Saerloon. The cult situated themselves in repurposed [[Saragath Towers]] with Jassandra becoming the high priestess. All Saerloonians were invited to the consecration ritual.

By the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the Cult of the Dragon's Sembian-based cell leaders returned to Saerloon but operated in secrecy this time around.

With the advent of the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the Temple of [[Mystra]] was leveled by fires, and lightning, in a great storm was observed from miles away. [[Cadellin Firehands]], the Lady's Mage and the head of the temple avoided certain death as he was in [[Suzail]] at the time. During the same period of time, a [[sorceress]] agent of [[Zhentil Keep]] fulfilled a nefarious ploy of the Shadow Network by transforming several influential merchants into stone.

[[File:Saerloon-Onsible.png|thumb|right|270px|''Possible location of Onsible's estate in [[1358 DR]].'']]
In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, local [[wizard]] and recluse [[Onsible Draung]] was abducted and sold into [[slavery]]. When word of his disappearance got out, other wizards began looting his tower in the western part of the city. The competition got so fierce that a free-for-all spell-battle broke out that resulted in the deaths of wizards [[Ieirgyn Malaunt]] of [[Ordulin]], [[Gargreth Mraeyvyn]] of [[Hillsfar]], and at least twelve others. The compound's triangular walls were destroyed, no trees on the estate were left standing, and Onsible's tower was reduced to a smoldering crater. In later years, new houses were built on the site, and no traces of the former estate were visible.{{Cite dragon/282/The New Adventures of Volo: The Urge to Hunt|71}}

On the 8{{th}} of [[Uktar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}} a deadly fire erupted in [[Thauldynposts]], the mansion of spell-slinging merchant [[Gnessur Thauldyn]] of Saerloon. The renowned wizard [[Rilantaver]] was seen jumping out of the mansion's windows. Witnesses claimed that the wizard disappeared in a strange glow before he reached the ground while carrying a well-stuffed sack. The only thing left of Rilantaver was a glowing [[rod]] that the Helms of Sembia took as evidence. Thauldynposts burned to a crisp by morning, leaving nothing but exposed cellar, while Gnessur Thauldyn's remains were never found.

{{YearlinkName|1370}} saw a concerning rise of [[Eyeless Mask]] abductions in cities of Saerloon and [[Selgaunt]]. The shadowy organization was raising funds to expand into [[Daerlun]]. One of the Eyeless Mask's victims was a [[Blanchard Wyvernwalk]] who was murdered during a botched abduction attempt. Some of the noble families Saerloon who monetarily supported the Cult of the Dragons demanded protection and retaliation from their clandestine allies.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a lost Netherese enclave of [[Sakkors]] emerged from the Sea of Fallen Stars. Selgaunt allied itself with the returned Netherese in failed attempts to stop the being civil war within Sembia. On [[Uktar]] 29{{th}} of the same year Saerloon used ''[[teleportation circle]]s'' to transport its armies to the gates of Selgaunt and on Uktar 30{{th}}, the [[Battle of Selgaunt]] commenced. Even though Saerloon was allied with a [[green dragon]] [[Vendemniharan]], Selgaunt emerged victorious with the aid of Princes of Shade — [[Rivalen Tanthul|Rivalen]] and [[Brennus Tanthul]]. The armies of Saerloon were broken and captured.

In the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, [[Haelia Johannes]] was made the new Lord Governor of Saerloon. With the backing of her [[Netherese]] masters, she began bringing Saerloon under control by exterminating any worship of deities besides [[Shar]]. During the years of the Sakkors alliance, Saerloon was considered to be unstable due to the rampant activity of resistance cells that opposed the new rulers. Numerous unsavory guilds and [[demon]] cults only exacerbated the situation. However, resistance was mostly squashed by the Netherese by {{YearlinkName|1482}},

==Rumors & Legends==
*After the conflict over Onsible's estate, the place was said to be infected with [[wild magic]]. One of the combatants was reportedly transformed into a [[phantom]] [[fungus]] and was rumored to roam the sewers, cellars, and wooded groves around Saerloon.
*A ''[[demongate]]'', one of the so-called [[Abyssal Tradeways]] was located within the walls of Saerloon. These gates allowed trades from the [[Abyss]] to travel between the infinite layers and [[Toril]]. These traders were quite clandestine, and the exact location of the Saerlunan ''demongate'' was a well-kept secret.{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing|33}}
