Saerloon (), which was once called Chondathan
Saerloon has a busy port on the aptly named Saerloon Bay, that bustled with activity late into the night. The city was built on every piece of land that touched the water, hungrily claiming it as too precious to be wasted. The northern end of Saerlunan harbor was the location of a Thayan compound. The locals did not like the structure, and it was even evident in the isolation of the compound as if building themselves shunned it.
By the late 14 century DR, Saerloon grew several miles outside the city walls. Travelers who entered the city passed numerous inns, taverns, stockyards, and stables long before reaching the old city gates. The busy neighborhoods outside the city walls carried a strong aroma of smoke, cooking meats, animal dung, as well as the stench of smelters, tanneries, and paper presses. 
The city within the walls was referred to as Old Saerloon, and this was the part of the city renowned for its gothic architecture, high-pointed arches, blade-like buttresses, tall needle-spires, and rooftops adorned with gargoyles. Many visitors thought the sight of the Old Saerloon to be magnificent but sinister. The city was flush with grand stone-carved statues, fountains, and carved trees that replaced the natural vegetation.thumb|right|390x390px|A map of Saerloon in 1358 DR.Saerloon was a sprawling and fairly chaotically-structured city. According to visitors, two large open plaza markets were the main landmarks in the otherwise confusing and samey city streets. The larger plaza was the North Market, just several blocks away from the city walls. The smaller Dolphin Market was to the south from the North Market and a short walk away from Saerloons busy docks. The Dolphin Market was a noisy, cramped, and chaotic market filled with crooked fish stalls, while the North Market was punctuated by a high-pillared statue of Saer, the citys namesake.
By the late 15 century DR, a group of grand old mansions on the Northside of the city were abandoned by its inhabitants for bigger and grander homes. These twenty-seven derelict decaying mansions came to be known as the Dowagers. Many of these houses became havens for freeloaders and predatory landlords who took advantage of those with little coin. Some of them were turned into storehouses by ambitious merchants, while others gained different repulsion. Themtraver Hall was surrounded by whispers about dire hauntings,
Apart from its humanoid population, Saerloon had a healthy number of fat blusterbirds that left their marks on numerous stone trees and sculptures of the city.
Saerloon was located in a temperate climate territory. The city saw snowfall in the winter as well as frequent regular or ice fogs.
Saerloon was nominally ruled by a merchant prince who ultimately served the merchant council. The said Council of Sembia, or the Consortium Princes, were joint political rulers of Saerloon, Selgaunt, and all of Sembia. The organization issued ambassadors to neighboring countries, such as Cormyr, who were authorized to negotiate trade and military assistance.
Saerloon was a busy shipping hub. The city was notorious among merchants for its outrageous import taxes. Many of the grand structures in Saerloon were built using imported quarried Yhauntan stone The city had a busy industrial production of various materials, such as leather, paper, and metal smelts. 
Famously, Auroras Emporium sold clothes that were sown in Saerloon using the finest Daerlunian wool and linen. Auroras also sold childrens wooden string puppets and marionettes, popular across the Realms. All toys were created by Saerloons Stringpullers guild. Some of these puppets came in accidental likeness of King Azoun Obarskyr IV (allegedly), likeness of wizard Vangerdahast Aeiulvana (likewise allegedly), and the great bard deity Finder Wyvernspur, commissioned by a Harper agent Olive Ruskettle. Another export item of note from Saerloon was Saerloonas dried raisins, sold by Auroras for a single gold coin per pound.
Among other food and drink, Saerloon was known for exporting several types of popular wines Saerloonian Special Vat, a pale red wine Saerloonian Glowfire, a faintly glowing wine of gentle summery taste Saerloonian Topaz, a dry amber-colored nutty wine, among others.
In the late-15 century DR, kitchenmasters of Saerloon started purchasing plump thimdror oxen from a small farm in Cormyr that belonged to Nars Thormil. As if by magic, the farm always had bests ready for purchase. These thimdrors were served in establishments such as Nundrarls Haven Inn.
Saerloon prided itself in its high society, exquisite, exotic, and varied tastes, as well as being cultured and educated.
The city was a busy place with most inhabitants consumed by daily life and trades. Like in other Sembian cities, Saerloonian humans historically distrusted elves - the result of the tumultuous history of rivalry against the inhabitants of Cormanthor and the ancient city of Myth Drannor. Throughout the citys history, many citizens, fearfully hid their valuables through the attics, caches, rooftops, cellars, in fear of Saerloon being overrun by threats from the north or the south. Smarter Saerlunans hid valuables outside the city walls, while the stashes within the city were often discovered by adventurers, thieves, and explorers. Who doesnt like a surprise enchanted item or a precious-stone encrusted regalia?
Imbaerla Nardragon of Saerloon wrote a famous play Seven Swords Snarlclash in 1312 DR. This play became one of the Famous Seven, the group of seven most popular and influential plays performed in the Heartlands of Faerûn.
Historically, before the dominion of Shar, Saerloon worked to attract churches with little other presence in the region to grow its population and power. The city offered free land, tax breaks, and immunity to some of the laws. Saerloon allowed its churches to be fully governed by their holy laws and dogma rather than local laws. These exemptions allowed clerics to hide taxable trade goods, offer asylum to refugees, etc. These factors allowed the churches of Mystra and Azuth to bloom and prosper and attract a grand number of users of the Art. Noble families of Saerloon were sponsored by the citys elders in inviting powerful clerics of both deities of magic.
The guard of Saerloon reached approximately 7,000 Helms of Sembia who patrolled the city and surrounding areas, including roads, farms, and waterways. The guard used eleven major ships for patrolling. In 1358 DR, Lady Merelith led these guards, aided by Overcaptain Burinta Shammarcron and Overcaptain Maerlus Balaern. In addition to the city guard, Saerloon was home to many wizards of significant skill, many of whom worked as traders and investors in the city of merchants.
Long before Saerloon was settled, the grand destruction of three Netherese conclaves took place in -1660 DR. The explosions formed that would eventually be known as Saerloon Bay.
Saerloon inherited its distinctive architecture from the Chondathan colonists who established Saerloon as their foothold in the area in the 380s DR.
Saerloon and Selgaunt came under attacks of goblin and orc raiders in the . The hordes continued regular attacks on Sembia until the .
In the , the Rotting War came to an end in Chondath and Saerloon (then known as Chondathan) gained independence. Soon after, the Cult of the Dragon that was established in the city several years earlier, created its first dracolich under the leadership of Sammaster.
In the , Another opposition to the city of Saerloon came from a small tribe of locathah that once dwelt in the waters close to the city. The aquatic humanoids were forced to leave Saerloons waters due to heavy ship activity disturbing their fishing supplies. A short-lived conflict between humans and locathah resulted in the sabotage of several trade ships, but eventually, Saerloon won, and locathah left.
Circa 1157 DR, the legendary artifact, the Blade of Lathander, was stolen from the Temple of Lathander in Saerloon. The blade was created with a singular purpose to destroy Tyranthraxus, the infamous possessing spirit and one of the Seven Lost Gods.
In the , pirate leader Methlas was assassinated by his lieutenant Thevren, who and sent his fleet of 40 ships to attack Saerloon and Selgaunt. The attacks were startling successes for the pirate fleet.
The  saw Jassandra Alastrin, a wealthy merchants daughter and worshiper of Shar, announced to the city she was founding the Temple to the Dark Magic, a new cult dedicated to the Mistress of the Night. Jassandra made the announcement off a back of an iron golem carried by 80 of her acolytes through the streets of Saerloon. The cult situated themselves in repurposed Saragath Towers with Jassandra becoming the high priestess. All Saerloonians were invited to the consecration ritual.
By the , the Cult of the Dragons Sembian-based cell leaders returned to Saerloon but operated in secrecy this time around.
With the advent of the Time of Troubles in the , the Temple of Mystra was leveled by fires, and lightning, in a great storm was observed from miles away. Cadellin Firehands, the Ladys Mage and the head of the temple avoided certain death as he was in Suzail at the time. During the same period of time, a sorceress agent of Zhentil Keep fulfilled a nefarious ploy of the Shadow Network by transforming several influential merchants into stone.
thumb|right|270px|Possible location of Onsibles estate in 1358 DR.
In the , local wizard and recluse Onsible Draung was abducted and sold into slavery. When word of his disappearance got out, other wizards began looting his tower in the western part of the city. The competition got so fierce that a free-for-all spell-battle broke out that resulted in the deaths of wizards Ieirgyn Malaunt of Ordulin, Gargreth Mraeyvyn of Hillsfar, and at least twelve others. The compounds triangular walls were destroyed, no trees on the estate were left standing, and Onsibles tower was reduced to a smoldering crater. In later years, new houses were built on the site, and no traces of the former estate were visible.
On the 8 of Uktar in the  a deadly fire erupted in Thauldynposts, the mansion of spell-slinging merchant Gnessur Thauldyn of Saerloon. The renowned wizard Rilantaver was seen jumping out of the mansions windows. Witnesses claimed that the wizard disappeared in a strange glow before he reached the ground while carrying a well-stuffed sack. The only thing left of Rilantaver was a glowing rod that the Helms of Sembia took as evidence. Thauldynposts burned to a crisp by morning, leaving nothing but exposed cellar, while Gnessur Thauldyns remains were never found.
 saw a concerning rise of Eyeless Mask abductions in cities of Saerloon and Selgaunt. The shadowy organization was raising funds to expand into Daerlun. One of the Eyeless Masks victims was a Blanchard Wyvernwalk who was murdered during a botched abduction attempt. Some of the noble families Saerloon who monetarily supported the Cult of the Dragons demanded protection and retaliation from their clandestine allies.
In the , a lost Netherese enclave of Sakkors emerged from the Sea of Fallen Stars. Selgaunt allied itself with the returned Netherese in failed attempts to stop the being civil war within Sembia. On Uktar 29 of the same year Saerloon used teleportation circles to transport its armies to the gates of Selgaunt and on Uktar 30, the Battle of Selgaunt commenced. Even though Saerloon was allied with a green dragon Vendemniharan, Selgaunt emerged victorious with the aid of Princes of Shade — Rivalen and Brennus Tanthul. The armies of Saerloon were broken and captured.
In the , Haelia Johannes was made the new Lord Governor of Saerloon. With the backing of her Netherese masters, she began bringing Saerloon under control by exterminating any worship of deities besides Shar. During the years of the Sakkors alliance, Saerloon was considered to be unstable due to the rampant activity of resistance cells that opposed the new rulers. Numerous unsavory guilds and demon cults only exacerbated the situation. However, resistance was mostly squashed by the Netherese by ,
