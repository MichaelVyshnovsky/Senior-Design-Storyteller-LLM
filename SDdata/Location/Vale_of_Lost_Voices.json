        "History": "Created on the spot where [[Venom]] ambushed and killed those who had killed his mate, the Vale of Lost Voices was guarded as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by [[baelnorn]]s from the [[sylvan elf]] clan [[Audark]]. Over time, the place had been used by other elves to bury their honored dead. \n\nA guardian of the Vale was a grumpy, if not insane, old dwarf named [[Durkin]]. He lived in an abandoned elvish castle on a rocky tor in the Vale.\n\nCormanthor's [[drow]] gave the Vale a wide berth.\n\nThe [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] considered the Vale to be a sacred place."
