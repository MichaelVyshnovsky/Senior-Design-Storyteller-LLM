        "mainbody": "Thaeravel was an ancient realm of sorcerers in what would become Netheril.\nThaeravel was north of the Windy Plains, east of the Flats and south of the Shinantra Mountains and the Hidden Lake. After the plains turned to dust the area became known as the Quarter of Emptiness in the Sword of Anauroch.\nThe realm was founded around -4300 DR with its capital of Rasilith. It predated the foundation of Netheril by over three centuries, but the influence of elven magical teachings, Arthindol the Terraseer, and the Nether Scrolls resulted in Netherese arcanists far outpacing the Thaeravelians, who grew complacent and decadent in time. Near the end of the Nether Age in -3392 DR, it was conquered by the forces of Netheril and the sorcerers captured, their magical knowledge torn from their minds and leaving them gibbering wrecks. Some sorcerers managed to flee to uncertain fates, including Ondil of the Floating Tower, which came to a rest near the future site of Secomber.\nAs Anauroch expanded alongside the fall of Netheril, the area became an especially harsh and lifeless region of the Sword known as the Quarter of Emptiness. Rasilith became home to an underground colony of phaerimm who enslaved a tribe of laertis.\nAround the , the Brave Blades adventurers delved into a sorcerers spider-infested tomb there, finding clues that led them to the Floating Tower of the lich Ondil alongside Elmara.\nThe return of Thultanthar in 1372 DR led to the extermination of phaerimm, and Rasilith was resettled with Bedine people who were acculturated to the Netherese.\nIt was speculated that the sorcerers of Thaeravel who fled and survived Netherils attack transformed themselves into the phaerimm in order to get revenge on their enemies.\nAs the realm of Thaeravel fell into legend, it was said to be the original homeland of Netheril, rather than an early victim of it."
