It was the epitome of elven culture and beauty, and nearly no outsiders were considered welcome within.\n\n{{Quote|When I rest at the end of the day and retreat into reverie...I recall the Evereska I wandered as a youth, when I followed a haunting song or a wisp of light among the roiling fogs of the [[Greycloak Hills|Greycloaks]], picked sweet berries in the hollows of the hills, and swam in the cold streams that flowed out of their heights.|[[Aedyn Graymantle]], wilderness guide and [[ranger]] of Evereska.}}\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",

        "Trade": "The elves of Evereska were largely self-sufficient, but did trade with other cities of the Realms, sometimes as far away as the continent of [[Zakhara]]. Because the hills around Evereska contained little in the way of ores, metals were imported into the city in exchange for paintings, sculptures, crafted wooden items, and wine.\n\nProminent trade families included the moon elf houses of [[Alaenree]], [[Coudoarluth]], [[Presrae]], and [[Straeth]]; the [[gold elf]] [[Elond]], [[Immeril]], and [[Naelgrath]] families; and the [[sylvan elf]] family of [[Shalandalan]].{{Cite dragon/267/The New Adventures of Volo: Onward!|81}}",

The [[Long Watch]] as the exterior army beyond the protection of the city's valley, and the [[Swords of Evereska]] served the noble army, composed of the Noble Blades and Lordly Wands, Evereska's most skill warriors were drawn into the [[Cold Hand]], an elite force commanded by High Lord Duirsar himself.\n\nThe [[Vale Guard]] served as Evereska's equivalent of a city guard, whose jurisdiction extended out to the greater valley, while the [[Evereskan tomb guardian|Tomb Guard]] acted as protectors of all elven crypts within the Greycloak Hills. Finally the [[Feather Cavalry]] served as aerial mounted sentries that watched over Evereska's skies."

        "History": {
            "Early History": "Evereska's valley was believed to have first been populated by elves during the Founding Time, specifically in the {{Yearlink|-8600}} by several clans hailing from ancient [[Aryvandaar]]. They sought to create a secret refuge for their people, known only to the [[Tel'Quessir]]. \n\nA millennium later in {{Yearlink|-7600}}, Evermeet began to experience significant overcrowding, which led in part to the founding of [[Sharrven]] in the borders of the [[High Forest]]. When the empire of Aryvandaar fell, the elves of Evereska allied themselves with those from [[Sharrven]] to help prevent the realm of [[Siluvanede]] from suffering the same fate. These efforts were made in vain however, and in {{Yearlink|-2770}}, the [[fey'ri]] of [[Siluvanede]] brought about the collapse of Sharrven and the slaughter of its people. Many of the survivors turn to Evereska for shelter and survival.\n\nThe existence of Evereska remained secret until the {{YearlinkName|244}}, when its location was uncovered by [[human]] tribes living within the Greycloak Hills. They only managed to keep the city's secret safe for a mere few centuries.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|464}}, the first human ever was granted admittance into Evereska. He was a [[chosen]] of [[Mystra]] known as [[Khelben Arunsun|Arun's Son]], an individual that nearly sacrificed his own life to save several Evereskans from one of the malevolent [[phaerimm]].\n\nEvereska received refugees from [[Askavar]] in the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]], after its fall during the late 6{{th}} century [[DR]].",
            "14{{th}} Century": "In [[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, dual effects of [[the Weave|weave magic]] and [[shadow magic]] created an opening in the [[Sharn Wall]] beneath the Greycloak Hills, and the maligned phaerimm were released from their subterranean prison. After enthralling scores of [[bugbear]],s [[mind flayer]]s, and [[beholder]]s, the phaerimm began an assault on the outer valley of Evereska, devastating much of the lush landscape. Fortunately they were turned away by combined forces of the Evereskan elves and allies from [[Waterdeep]] led by [[Khelben Arunsun]]. In the following weeks the elven warriors were joined in battle by the [[arcanist]]s of [[Thultanthar]], and in [[Mirtul]] of [[1372 DR|the next year]], the forces of the [[Lords' Alliance]] led by [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral]] and [[Storm Silverhand]]. Finally in [[Eleasis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}},\nthat year, the phaerimm and their army were finally defeated and driven out of Evereska for good.\n\nDuring the conflict, the aberrant monstrosities damaged the city's ''mythal'' causing further disruption to the vale. While the Evereskans were able to repel the attack using magic, the ''mythal'' had to be rebuilt. The city's [[Elven high mage|High Mages]] were able to repair the nearly all of the protection on their own, but required assistance from [[Galaeron Nihmedu]], a novice practitioner of [[shadow magic]]. This caused the restored ''mythal'' of Evereska to be the first ever formed from both [[the Weave]] and magic drawing from the [[Shadow Weave]].  \n\nIn the aftermath of the fighting, a few phaerimm and elves who lost their wits in the battle wandered the Evereskan valley.",
            "Aftermath and Continued Conflicts": "The survivors of the battle with the phaerimm were all younger elves, and they protected their existence violently if they encountered a threat. They regarded looters as deserving of death. Occasional clashes broke out between the surviving elves and phaerimm. Some elves traveled from other parts of Faerûn to join the remaining Evereskan elves, and some removed the remaining treasures of Evereska, moving them to safer locations. \n\nFollowing the conflict, the gardens of the valley became untended and overgrown and many of the bridges in the valley were broken. Elves designated [[helmed horror]]s and [[shield guardian]]s to protect their houses. The damage to the ''mythal'' caused Evereska to be cloaked in mist or fine rain. Unpredictable magical effects arose seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nEvereska faced another grave threat in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, when an army of fey'ri led by [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] marched upon the city. The city was saved by the efforts of [[Seiveril Miritar]], a [[gold elf]] lord of [[Evermeet]]. In what would become known as [[Seiveril's Crusade]], the elf lord left his on the isle of elves and raised an volunteer army to save their fellow Tel'Quessir on the mainland.\n\nFollowing the world-altering [[Spellplague]] that wracked [[Faerûn]] a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, the barrier between Evereska and the [[Feywild]] became less distinct and clear. For some time it existed equally between both the Feywild and the [[Prime Material plane]].\n\nIn a stark change of tradition, Evereska eventually opened up its borders and allowed outlanders to enter within.",
            "15{{th}} Century": "During the emergence of the second [[Netheril#Empire of Shadows|Netherese empire]], the elves of Evereska remained stalwart defenders against the empire's westward expansion.\n\nAfter the second fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, many refugees came to Evereska but some of them were unhappy with Evereska's reclusiveness."
