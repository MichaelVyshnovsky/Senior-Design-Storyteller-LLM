'''Al-Qal'at''',<ref group="note">The map for [[Corsairs of the Great Sea]] shows an alternate spelling of "Qalat." also called the '''Fortress''', was a highly contested island in the [[Great Sea]] off the coast of [[northwest Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The island sat offshore roughly {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} from [[Qudra]] to the southeast and [[Liham]] to the east. The island itself measured {{SI|120|mi|k|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} wide. Much of the island was dry and barren, with three separate plateaus jutting from its center. The western side of the island was forested.

==Activities==
Many [[Corsair (kit)|corsair]] captains laid claim to the prized island because of its strategic location within easy striking distance of their hated enemy, the [[mamluk]]s of Qudra. However, the corsair's inability to work together cohesively prevented any permanent presence on the island.
