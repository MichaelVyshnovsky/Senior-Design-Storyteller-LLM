        "mainbody": "Medinat Muskatwoon was a small city in the kingdom of Bakar, around the lake Meat Halwa. It became a ghost city not long after the river dried\nThe limestone causeway narrowed closer to the city, but never became narrower than . It led into the northern city square there stood an obelisk,  tall and  at its base, with several inscriptions by Martek cryptically stating the way to recover the Star of Melos-Pelar. The causeway ran between the ruins of the Medinat Muskatwoon government building, and the Pashas palace. East of the causeway, in an otherwise clear area, only two buildings remained recognizable in any way the Temple of Horus and the Temple of Prometheus.\nWest from the causeway, counter-clockwise from the center, lay a ruined egyptian-style Temple of Osiris, a ruined Finnish temple of Untamo, the Baths of Drusus, and a ruined celtic temple of Dunatis. The Temple of Balder in the city still stood. Continuing counter-clockwise one could find a Roman-style sandstone hippodrome, and a greek-style black marble Collegium both were thoroughly ruined, but still stood somewhat recognizable. The Temple of Ra was next, followed by ruined baths almost due south from the center of the lake was another building full of baths, known as the Baths of Persepolis.\nOn the south-eastern quadrant were a Palaestra, three arabic brick caravanserai, another bath known as the Baths of Kordek, and finally a ruined greek temple of Tyche.\nThe City of Medinat Muskatwoon lay on the banks of the lake Meat Halwa, in the middle of five hills in the Raurin.\nThe natural limestone roadbed on the northwest of Medinat Muskatwoons hills made it a natural location for a city. Travelers from all over the world at the time brought their wares to Medinatin before carrying them through the rest of Bakar. Though it never grew past a square mile, Medinat Muskatwoon grew into a thriving cultural hub, becoming a metropolis on its own right. After the death of Amun-Re around the year  the river Athis stopped flowing and the Meat soon dried as well, the small streams that fed it becoming insufficient without the underground aquifers that the Athis fed. Without the river, trade across the desert also dried up, and thus travel became ever more expensive. Gradually this made it more and more difficult to relocate from the city, encouraging the gouging of the inhabitants, leaving at every turn only the poorest and most desperate.\nThe last caravan to arrive became overwhelmed by a violent mob of frenzied, desperate citizens, craving water so badly as to drink the blood of the camels. The remaining population died not long after. Medinat Muskatwoon became a ghost town, visited by adventurers looking for treasure and magical items they returned telling stories of ghosts that craved moisture, and other kinds of undead. This is how Medinat Muskatwoon came to the name of \"Cursed City of Stone\".\n50 years after the last inhabitants walked the city, the efreet Pasha Khalitharius took up residence there, organizing the undead of the city into his army, the Malatath. At some point after that, at least 1000 years before  (approximately the year ) the wizard Martek came to the city together with a small caravan to challenge and stop the efreet. The efreets army waged a slow, torturous war of attrition on the wizards caravan, slaying one of their guards every night, then their camels, then draining their water, until Martek finally confronted the efreet in single combat. He emerged victorious, but the flames burned the city, and in fact, the surrounding area, for 20 years after their fight.\nMartek decided to turn the ruins of the city into the hiding place for the Star of Melos-Pelar, creating with his magic a number of puzzles based on the temples of the gods in the city.\n*Temple of Ra\n*Temple of Balder\n*Temple of Horus\n*Temple of Prometheus\n*Baths of Drusus\n*Baths of Persepolis\n*Baths of Kordek\nOnly one of five vaulted roofs held aloft by simple columns remained now, covering a large circular pool. As of the time of Khalitarius release, the body of a dead adventurer lay close to the pool, holding a golden object in their hand. Three wraiths dwelt there.\nA collegiums facade still endured it was made of black marble. Only part of the back half of the building endured still, most of its domes gone. Near the base of an outside wall, some slate had been attached a unique spectre lectured there on the subject of the meter of poetry in an ancient language. Though dull, it could answer questions about the city, though it wouldnt answer more than one question per person, instead hurling invective at anyone who interrupted its lecture twice.\nThe palaestra was a square building  on a side made of grey-pink stone, covered in attractive frescoes of young men in various games and gymnastic activities. It had arched entrances on the north and south walls, and a peaked clay-tile roof, longer on the south end than on the north. Inside, it had a peristyle courtyard and a pool, now dry, which was inhabited by centipedes as of the mid-14 century DR. In its time it provided a colonnaded area for lounging, reading, and athletics. Three golden links were hidden there.\nApparitions of the city in its time and undead were almost the only creatures populating the zone, save for a smattering of centipedes in the Palaestra. The undead included ghosts of a mob, thieves, or fighters, wights, and wraiths."
