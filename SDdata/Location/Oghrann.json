It skirted Boareskyrs Forest, referred to by the dwarves as Wurgymvudd or \"Ugly-Wood\". The lands to the northwest, known at the time as the Helbryn, were also claimed by Oghrann as a hunting reserve, but settlement of those lands was forbidden since the time of King Thordbard..\nOghrann was founded in the wake of the fall of Shanatar, by the realms first and most legendary warrior-king, Thordbard Firebeard, in .\nOghrann lasted until shortly after Ammarindar was abandoned, continuing on until the year . Disease and attacks from monstrous humanoids, such as lizard men, bugbears and wemics, spelled the end of the realm and its 7,000-odd survivors fled to the Far Hills to the west."
