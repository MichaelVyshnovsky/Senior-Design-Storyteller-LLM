        "mainbody": "'''Peqqir''' was a city in the [[Plain of Horses]] of northeastern [[Kara-Tur]]. It was the home of the [[Guychiang]] tribe.",
        "Geography": "Peqqir stood in the [[Wikipedia:taiga|taiga]] of the northern Plain of Horses, near the foot of the [[Chigidi Mountains]] and with the [[Anai River]] flowing past. A road following the river linked it to [[Mount Or-Ghash]] in the west and the other cities of the Plain of Horses in the east. Peqqir was surrounded by green forests and rolling hills, and enjoyed some of the most fertile farmland in the region.",
        "Trade": "Expert farmers and employing advanced irrigation methods, the Guychiang grew [[grain]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[cotton]], and [[mulberry]] trees, the leaves of which were used in the production of [[silk]]. In addition, they mined [[iron]] and [[jade]] from the nearby Chigidi Mountains and craftsmen manufactured [[weapon]]s, quality jewelry, and [[leather]] products. All in all, Peqqir was perhaps the most industrious settlement in all the Plain of Horses as of {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.",
        "Defenses": "Defense of their city was paramount to the Guychiang. To enter Peqqir, a traveler must pass through a succession of ''sibege'', heavily fortified gates in the city wall. A squad of well-armed soldiers stood guard on each ''sibege''. A permit issued by city officials and payment of a gate tax were required just to pass through one ''sibege''.",
        "History": "After he first appeared in the Plain of Horses around {{YearlinkConvert|2592|SY}}, the nomad lama [[Torgoja P'a]] stopped in Peqqir, where he aided in the design of an irrigation project that would bring water to mulberry farms on mountain slopes. The grateful inhabitants offered to construct a temple in his honor, but P'a passed on it and continued on his way. He would become High Lama of Mount Or-Ghash around {{YearlinkConvert|2597|SY}}.<ref>"
