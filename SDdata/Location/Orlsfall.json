        "mainbody": "Orlsfall was a mining town turned ghost town in northern Amn.\nOrlsfall sat below the eastern Cloud Peaks on the north side of the Ridge, not far northwest of the Giants Dance. It was about two days travel northeast of Amnwater, and an equal distance northwest from Keczulla.\nThe town was named after a heroic miner who saved seven fellow miners before himself being killed in a cave-in. The town grew rapidly in a rush to exploit the mine, and was then abandoned when the mine ran dry. It remained uninhabited until just before 1370 DR, when opportunistic bandits led by Timok the Tusk moved in. Although not quite notorious enough to warrant an assault from nearby Citadel Rashturl, their raids on the nearby Greenfields and growing numbers meant that this was likely to change."
