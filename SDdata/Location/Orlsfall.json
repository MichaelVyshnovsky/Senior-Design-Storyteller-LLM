        "mainbody": "'''Orlsfall''' was a mining town turned ghost town in northern [[Amn]].",
        "Geography": "Orlsfall sat below the eastern [[Cloud Peaks]] on the north side of [[the Ridge]], not far northwest of the [[Giants' Dance]]. It was about two days travel northeast of [[Amnwater]], and an equal distance northwest from [[Keczulla]].",
        "History": "The town was named after a heroic miner who saved seven fellow miners before himself being killed in a cave-in. The town grew rapidly in a rush to exploit the mine, and was then abandoned when the mine ran dry. It remained uninhabited until just before [[1370 DR]], when opportunistic bandits led by [[Timok the Tusk]] moved in. Although not quite notorious enough to warrant an assault from nearby [[Citadel Rashturl]], their raids on the nearby [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Greenfields]] and growing numbers meant that this was likely to change."
