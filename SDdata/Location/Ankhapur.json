He became a [[lich]] and sought to inhabit the body of [[Janol Famisso]], a bastard son of his. In his attempt, Manferic killed his other heirs while controlling Janol's body in order to inherit the throne from himself. However, thanks to a cleric of [[Lathander]], [[Lissa]], and others, Manferic was destroyed by Janol and his allies.\n\nWith no other heirs left, Janol took the crown."
