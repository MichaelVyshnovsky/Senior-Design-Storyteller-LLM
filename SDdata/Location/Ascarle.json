        "Description": "The somewhat-ruined buildings and walkways were formed from crystal and red coral. The city was filled with air.",
        "History": "The lost city of Ascarle was swept into the ocean by melting glaciers.\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], it was rumored that a [[kraken]] truly ruled the city, but the nominal Regent of Ascarle was the [[illithid]] [[Vestress]]. Vestress was a rogue illithid who had taken the city from hands of a drow [[banshee]], whom she banished to [[Inthar]] on Ruathym via a portal. She desired to conquer Ruathym, but the banshee made that impossible, so she plotted to have the banshee destroyed by [[Liriel Baenre]]. Under the Kraken Society, she also allied with [[Rethnor]] of [[Luskan]] and [[Shakti Hunzrin]] as part of a plot to turn the [[Lords' Alliance]] and [[Waterdeep]] into war with Ruathym. However, all of these plans were discovered by Liriel, who led an assault on the city, deposed Vestress, and released the illithid's captives.",
