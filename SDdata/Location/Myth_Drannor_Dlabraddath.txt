Dlabraddath, meaning "the ending of Labrad", also known as the Alliance Ward or New Ward was most recently-developed ward in the city of Myth Drannor. It served as the home to the citys non-elven populations as well as their respective businesses.
This was the only ward of Myth Drannor that featured non-elven architecture. The curbs of its streets were carved granite rather than marble, a testament of their dwarven craftsmanship.
Dlabraddath was located on the eastern side of the city, beyond the Bridge of Heroes.
It was said that any women who stood in the district at noon, cupping seeds into her hands, would be visited by birds known as the Maidens Messengers. After eating the seeds, one of these birds would carry off a small item or written message to a recipient the woman chose.
