        "mainbody": "'''Mourktar''' was an independent city-state, that later became the capital of [[Threskel]], one of the [[Old Empires]] of [[east Faerûn]]. It was previously considered by many to be a part of the confederation of [[Chessenta]], though that belief was not shared by its native residents.",
        "Government": {
            "Law & Order": "As of the mid–14{{th}} century, the people of Mourktar still abided by the Chessentan [[Code of Enlil]].",
            "Relations": "Mourktar maintained an adversarial relationship with the sahuagin kingdom of [[Aleaxtis]]. They considered [[Mordulkin]] to be their rivals, especially when it came to trade and commerce."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Religion": "Worship of [[Assuran]], the Lord of the Three Thunders was very strong in Mourktar.\n\nMourktar was also home to a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell that dated back to the 11{{th}} century DR, whose members served the [[blue dragon|blue]] [[dracolich]] [[Alasklerbanbastos]], also known as the Great Bone Wyrm. While many of these cultists operated out of the Black Lord's Cloak temple of Bane, their true alignment lay with the [[church of Tiamat]] in Unther."
        },
        "Trade": "The city housed a grand port that greatly benefited the many farmers, herders, and miners of the region. Mourktar's close proximity to [[Bezantur]] in [[Thay]] and [[Sultim]] in [[Murghôm]] granted it an edge over [[Mordulkin]] in the west.",
        "Defenses": "As of the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Mourktar maintained an army of 500 soldiers, and mobilized four times as many conscripts from the city's populace.",
        "History": "Mourktar broke free from the rule of Unther in the {{yearlinkName|823}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, the [[red dragon]] [[Tchazzar]] ascended divinity after the [[Rage of Dragons]] devastated the Realms. In a frantic effort to garner more power for himself, Alasklerbanbastos sought out [[lichdom]] by means of the Dragon Cult in Mourktar.\n\nDuring the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, King [[Theris]] announced to his subjects that he would soon be dying. As he had no heir to whom he could bequeath his kingdom, Theris called for a [[King's Tournament|grand tournament]] of athletic prowess at the [[Fields of Pryollus]] at the base of [[Mount Thulbane]], While the soldier of Akanax [[Helyos]] came close to victory, no clear victor arose as the winner.\n\nIn truth the tournament was sabotaged by [[Kabbarath Telthaug]], that Imperceptor of Bane that installed himself as the Regent of Mourktar until the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, when rule of the city was forcible shared with three younger [[blue dragon]]s, by decree of Alasklerbanbastos, ruler of Threskel. Regent Kabbarath ignored the will of the dragon-king until Mourktar was devastated by the [[vampiric dragon]] [[Jaxanaedegor]] ands several \"lesser\" [[dracolich]]es. The leaders of Mourktar responded with continued offerings and oblations as acts of acquiescence.\n\nDuring the [[Untheric Crusade]] of the 1370s [[DR]], templars of Bane from [[Black Lord's Cloak|his temple]] in Mourktar came to the defense of Unther, the nation form which the city had previously declared its freedom. The Black Lord's soldiers marched into [[Messemprar]] and aided in the city's defense against the onslaught of [[Mulhorand]].\n\nAround that same time, sea trade from Mourktar was interrupted by domestic troubles in nearby Unther, pirate activity and even the monstrous [[sahuagin]] from the underground city of [[Vahaxtyl]].",
        "Notable Locations": ";Temples\n* [[Amphitheater of First Thunder]], a grand arena dedicated to Assuran.\n* [[Black Lord's Cloak]], the largest temple of Bane in all of [[Faerûn]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Mourktar was home to a great many mercenaries and merchants, all of whom regularly benefited when conflicts arose in the surrounding lands."
