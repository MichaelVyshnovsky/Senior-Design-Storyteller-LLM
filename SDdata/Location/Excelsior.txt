'''Excelsior''' was a [[gate-town]] leading to [[Mount Celestia]] from the [[Outlands]].

==Description==
Excelsior was one of the few gate-towns without a city wall. The bricks comprising both the buildings and roads of Excelsior were yellow, speckled with particles of enchanted [[silver]] and [[steel]], which emanated a glowing light. The buildings also radiated a natural warmth. This made the city famous in the Outlands.

Despite the lack of city walls, Excelsior was far from defenseless. Orbiting around the city were up to a dozen floating fortresses called picket keeps. Each keep housed a [[paladin]] lord and their retinue.

===Gates===
The Gate to Mount Celestia was located at the top of the highest tower of Excelsior. The interior of the tower was a twisting maze of staircases. Most ended at an observation deck, from where an individual had a clear view of the gate-towns of [[Fortitude]] and [[Tradegate]]. Only one staircase led to the Gate. Those who ascended to a certain height suddenly discovered themselves suspended in midair, {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} above the ocean, right at the foot of Mount Celestia.

==Government==
Excelsior was ruled by the High Chancellor. Occasionally, one of the paladin lords issued a challenge to become the new High Chancellor. A short but bloody battle between the paladin lord and their followers versus the High Chancellor's forces would determine the winner of the challenge.

==Inhabitants==
The residents of this gate-town were calm and pleasant. Its population, mostly paladins, was composed primarily of [[human]]s and a few [[archon]]s and [[deva]]s. Only visitors of good [[alignment]] were truly welcome. Any others were not explicitly asked to leave as long as no law was broken, but were regarded with suspicion at all times.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Miguala abd-al Ragarin]]: High Chancellor of Excelsior. She was an elderly paladin from [[Zakhara]].
