'''Carathryn''', known as '''Holy High Carathryn''' and the '''Lost Home''', was a town that once stood on the seaward coast of the [[Dragonstail]] peninsula of the [[Purple Hills]] of [[Tethyr]] in [[west Faerûn]]. Its people were dedicated to [[Ilmater]], the Crying God.

==History==
Carathryn was a flourishing town and dominated by the Ilmatari faith.

One morning in the [[848 DR|Year of the Vigilant Familiar, 848 DR]], the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'' appeared on the altar of Ilmater. The Ilmatari told the story that Ilmater himself had placed it there. High Priest [[Ilnger Obskoth]] proclaimed it as "the hand of holy Ilmater made manifest among us", and it swiftly became the most venerated sacred object in Carathryn.

In the [[1123 DR|Year of the Shattered Chains, 1123 DR]], the Teeth of [[Talos]] storms lashed the southern [[Sword Coast]]. The storms completely sunk the Dragonstail peninsula, taking Carathryn with it. In later years, both the Dragonstail and Carathryn were a hazard to mariners along the coast, by ripping open the hulls of passing ships.
