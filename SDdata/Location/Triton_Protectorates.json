        "mainbody": "The '''Triton Protectorates''' was an exonym used by [[Serôs]]ians to refer collectively to [[Ahlorsath]], [[Pumanath]], and [[Vuuvaxath]] &mdash; a trio of [[triton]] city-states that were settled around the [[Trench of Lopok]]. The tritons themselves had no collective term for the three kingdoms, instead choosing to refer to each separately.",
        "Geography": "The Protectorates were located beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], The kingdom of Ahlorsath rested directly on the trench's eastern cliff edge, with its central capital [[Ahlors]] resting on its southeastern edge, though outsiders speculated that further cities and outposts of the protectorate resided on ledges within the trench. Ahlors was situated at the lowest point, on the sea floor {{SI|1875}} below sea level, while the highest point of the Protectorates was {{SI|1250|ft}} below sea level and that peak was reached by a {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}} high tower.\n\nBeyond the Trench of Lopok, the undersea mountain [[Skullmount]] was part of the extant territory claimed by the Protectorates, being frequently used by triton military patrols as a garrison and outpost.<ref>",
        "Society": "The various races that inhabited Serôs viewed the Triton Protectorates as socially a collective unit. as Protectorates and at a smaller scale their settlements were all built along impressively straightened roads.\n\nEach of Protectorates were made up of a capitol city, ringed by eight core trade cities, which in turn were ringed by twelve farming towns. Finally, twenty-four outposts surrounded the towns, forming a defensive perimeter. All structures within the cities were constructed of either coral or stone and were built according to strict geometric layouts.\n\nForemost among the structures in each town or city were two central towers, one that acted a place of worship and another that acted as a military garrison. The former was always built on the southern side of a settlement, whilst the latter was always built on the northern side. Both were square in shape and had a wide road between them, measuring {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} wide in the cities, bifurcating settlements.\n\nLike in much of Serôs, time was measured in the Protectorates using the [[Timesong calendar]].<ref>",
        "Governments": "Just as the three kingdoms were viewed by outsiders as socially a collective unit, the various races of Serôs viewed the Protectorates politically as a cooperative,<ref group=\"note\" name=\"theocracy\">Page 59 of the ''Sea of Fallen Stars'' states that the tritons have a \"theocratic society\". However, on page 150 it is stated that even though the Pumanath Protectorate has closer ties to the Church of Persana than the others, the \"colony is not a theocracy\". This in turn implies that the other protectorates likewise do not have theocratic governments. feudal system of nobles with inherited titles, centered around the god [[Persana]]. The inner workings of their governments and the titles of their nobility were unknown to outsiders. What was known was that all settlements were overseen by the Persana [[priest]]hood, whilst the militaries were relied upon for protection. This relationship culminated in each city and town, as well as an {{SIrange|8|10|mile|long=yes}} perimeter around a settlement, being ruled jointly by one soldier and one priest that were the highest ranked around.\n\nThe Triton Protectorates cooperated only in a shared guardianship over the Trench of Lopok, against the evils that sought to escape it and those who would seek to delve its mysterious depths. with their guardianship being a sacred duty. This isolationism was partly by choice and partly as a consequence of tritons' societal mores.",
        "Defenses": "The inner workings of the militaries of the Triton Protectorates were unknown to outsiders, as the tritons would not readily share such information. What was known was that the militaries regularly patrolled their waters, ensuring the safety of the cities and towns. And the twenty-four military outposts that surrounded each Protectorate were garrisoned at all times.\n\nOf the three Protectorates, Ahlorsath was situated as the Guardian colony, primarily dedicated to the task of watching over and guarding the Trench of Lopok.\n\nThe [[magic item|magical]] [[two-bladed sword]] ''[[Kayas the Krakenscourge|Krakenscourge]]'', later known as ''Kayas the Krakenscourge'', was among the greatest weapons in the arsenal of the Triton Protectorates. When first created it was used to slaughter a great deal of the Trench of Lopok's denizens, until most resigned themselves from actively trying to escape. From then on the weapon was passed down over the centuries, being wielded by a succession of war leaders. After the [[Fifth Serôs War]] it was lost for sixth centuries, not resurfacing and returning to the rightful hands of the Protectorates until the end of the [[Seventh Serôs War]]. It was lost again in the {{YearlinkName|1271}}, when the [[blue dragon|blue]] [[great wyrm]] [[Iryklathagra]] plundered the Ahlorsah city of [[Otanyn]].\n\nOver the centuries, whenever the ''Krakenscourge'' became lost the Protectorates chose to keep its absence a secret from outsiders. This was because the weapon had long acted as a deterrent against the krakens that dwelt within the Trench of Lopok. If its absence became public knowledge, it would only be a matter of time before the krakens below began testing the defenses of the tritons.",
        "Relations": "Over the centuries, the Triton Protectorates were frequently be in frequent conflict with morkoths, with their rivalry with the neighboring kingdom [[Arcanum of Olleth]] being among the most constant of local conflicts. They worked to prevent them and [[kuo-toa]] from trying to enter the depths of the Trench of Lopok, as the two groups believed their ancient gods dwelt below.",
        "History": "The exact dates at which each of the Protectorates were founded by the tritons was unknown to other Serôsians. In place of these, the Rise of each Protectorate was denoted by the date in which they became widely known. The Rise of Ahlorsath occured in {{YearlinkConvert|-21|TS}}, the Rise of Vuvaaxath in {{YearlinkConvert|82|TS}}, and the Rise of Pumanath in {{YearlinkConvert|235|TS}}. and began life as military outposts. These initial outposts consisted of a central tower, surrounded by support buildings used for living space. Other times, nearby caverns were used as living quarters by the early settlers. Overtime these outposts grew into towns as the tritons secured the area surrounding them for further habitation. The kingdoms expanded outward from these initial towns, with the first additional outposts being constructed sequentially in sets of four, each arranged on a cardinal direction {{SI|16|mile|long=yes}} out from the central tower. And this grid-like pattern would be repeated as each kingdom continued to grow.\n\nLong before the existence of the Triton Protectorates became widely known to Serôsians, they broke their isolationism to engage in the Fifth Serôs War ([[-788 DR]]-[[-777 DR]]) and ally themselves with the [[shalarin]] kingdom of [[Es'krin]]. This was because [[Coronal]] [[Vaequiis II]] of the [[Aryselmalyr Empire]] had allied himself with sworn enemies of the tritons, a pair of krakens from the Trench of Lopok, [[Borapalys]] and [[Rylurkarth]]. During the conflict Borapalys was said to have been killed by a triton [[Dukar]] named [[Kayas]] using the legendary ''Krakenscourge'', some legends claiming that he had transformed himself into the weapon. The location of the Protectorates remained unknown after the conflict and the ''Krakenscourge'' became lost to the tritons, falling into the hands of the [[Orlson Dynasty]] of Aryselmalyr. The royal [[sea elves]] would lose track of the weapon themselves and it would not resurface until the Seventh Serôs War, in the hands of the [[storm giant]] [[adventurer]] [[Lorthar]].\n\nIn the final year of the Seventh Serôs War, {{YearlinkConvert|-36|TS}}, during one of its last battles Lorthar fell to a legion of elite morkoth fighters and they briefly took hold of the ''Krakenscourge''. Determined to retrieve the weapon and fight their ancient foes, the Triton Protectorates unexpectedly joined the fray, making their existence more widely known among Serôsians. The triton forces struck at the [[Theocracy of the Deep Ones]], sending its morkoths fleeing into the deeper depths of the Inner Sea, and finally reclaimed ownership of the ''Krakenscourge''. Following the conflict the tritons continued to be active for a time, helping to maintain balance between the shalarin and the morkoth of Serôs.\n\nIt was later around the Fourth Epoch of Serôs ([[750 DR]] to [[1369 DR]]) when the Triton Protectorates were considered to have truly come into their own, rising as a noted power in Serôs and upsetting the control the morkoths long held over the deep depths of the Inner Sea.<ref> In {{YearlinkConvert|1226|TS}}, a conflict with the Ollethan morkoths in the Pumanath town of [[Abydos]] leads to the death of [[Xynakt]], the founder of Olleth.<ref>\n\nWhen the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] raged in {{YearlinkConvert|1349|TS}}, the historically isolationist Protectorates were reluctant to get involved. This neutrality broke when nearly a third of the settlements of Pumanath were besieged by the morkoth of Olleth and their allies, including the cities of Abydos and [[Pumana]]. They plundered many of the Protectorate of Pumana's [[artifact]]s and [[magical item]]s, including ones that had been stolen from them. Abydos saw the worst of the fighting, with over half the priests of the temple tower of [[Numos]] dying.\n\nHaving been forced to face the enemy, the tritons realized the folly in their arrogance and neutrality. with more than two legions of Vuvaaxath called to action by the mourning songs of [[Naahal|Naahal the Great Whale]]. They fought against the Ollethan morkoths, took the fight to the Arcanum, and fought at the battles of [[Myth Nantar]] and [[Xadea]]. After the Twelfth Serôs War came to an end most of the legions returned to the Triton Protectorates, though a few remained behind in the city of Myth Nantar to aid in its rebuilding efforts.<ref>"
