Pyarados was a small but vital tharch, located in the eastern region of Thay, just west of the River Thazarim. Despite its size, it was important to the nation as it controlled access to the valuable minerals found within the eastward Sunrise Mountains. The lands east of the Thazarim held vast slave plantations and many estates of the nations Red Wizards.
