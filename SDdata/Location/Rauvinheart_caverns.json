        "mainbody": "The Rauvinheart caverns were an immense system of caverns and tunnels underneath the Rauvin Mountains in Luruar. \nThe Rauvinheart caverns were located underneath Dead Orc Pass and the mountains on either side of the pass.\nThe caverns were heated by a geothermic source. The River Rauvin passed through the caverns and emerged at the southern mouth of Dead Orc Pass in a waterfall-filled area known as Rainbow Gorge. The caverns were home to creatures of the Underdark and fungi that served as food sources for the orcs that dwelt in the Rauvins.\nCategoryCaves\nCategoryLocations in Dead Orc Pass\nCategoryLocations in the Rauvin Mountains\nCategoryLocations in the Upperdark\nCategoryLocations in the Underdark\nCategoryLocations in Old Delzoun\nCategoryLocations in Luruar\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nl4fjtk5sps074epoqjgzawpxbso6ron"
