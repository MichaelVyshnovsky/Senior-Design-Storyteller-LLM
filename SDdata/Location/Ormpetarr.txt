Ormpetarr was the capital city of Sespech in the Vilhon Reach. During the century that followed the Spellplague, Ormpetarr was known as the City of the Scar.
Ormpetarr was an ancient metropolis, protected from the outside dangers by a thick wall. Past the harbor stood the Warehouse Row district. The city was filled with ancient brass spires, famed for their ability to reflect the setting sun like flame. Its straight streets were tightly packed with buildings, homes, and businesses and lit with ordinary lanterns through the night. Helm was the primary deity of the city which was obvious by his symbol on the guards uniforms and wide city squares decorated with silver gauntlet-bearing statues.
As of 1396 DR many of the brass spires lay broken and strewn down the rocky side of a cliff. The city degraded and became notoriously lawless settlement.

The metropolis was built on the eastern shores of the Nagawater lake in the Golden Plains, along the Golden Road trade way.
In the 14 century DR, Ormpetarr was ruled by Baron Thuragar Foesmasher, supported by the citys merchants, who stood in dire opposition to the nation of Chondath.
In 1479 DR, there was no official government. but power was shared uneasily by the Order of Blue Flame, forces loyal to Tyrangal and the huge Monastery of Kelemvor.	
Between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, Ormpetarr was guided by a single unspoken law only types of a crime punishable by the unofficial rulers were crimes that interfered with pilgrims flow.
Ormpetarr was a banking center and handled all trade on the Golden Road and a busy caravan stop. It was surrounded by lush fertile fields growing grains for export. Other major exports included fish, and horses. Merchant vessels that sailed the Nagawater often carried import wine.
Between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, Ormpetarr existed thanks to pilgrims and travelers that passed through the region. Its streets were dotted with establishments that catered to pilgrims taverns, inns, and pawn shops were main businesses within the shrunken city bounds.
Prior to 1385 DR, Ormpetarr was home to the bulk of Sespechs military. The city guard were tasked with patrolling and assigned to stand sentry at Ormpetarrs many gates. Each member of the watch was outfitted with a polished breastplate, adorned with the holy symbol of Helm. Underneath, they wore a set of padded leather armor coats that hung low, ending around human guards knees. Their open-face helmets were topped with purple plumes. City watch carried their weapons openly – knobbed maces.
Between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, by 1479 DR, there were several militias in town. The Order of Blue Flame had a militia known as the Peacekeepers, and Tyrangal had soldiers known as the Copper Guard. The Monastery of Kelemvor maintained a fighting force of monks and clerics.
Ormpetarr was established long before the Rotting War, several years after the . Quickly, it established itself as an important caravan stop for southern countries bringing their goods to the north. Ormpetarr invested the lions share of its finances into establishing and maintaining the Golden Road, neglecting the defense budget. Due to the lack of defenses, the Mayor of Ormpetarr at the time began relying on Arrabar for defense. With years passing, Chondath rose to power and took over what would become the Barony of Sespech, which included Ormpetarr. For several centuries that followed, the Barony earned to leave Chondath after growing dissatisfied with the rule.
The late-14 century DR was tumultuous in Ormpetarr. An adventurer named Thuragar Foemaster rose to power in the , through a series of assassinations. He claimed the title of Baron for Ricjolo Tomrase, a political puppet of Arrabar. Now Baron Foemaster drove his predecessor from Ormpetarr back to Chondath. In retaliation, Arrabar sent an army to Arranford that stood roughly between the two cities. The Arrabarran "peace-keeping force" clashed with Baron Foemasters men in a short battle from which Ormpetarr emerged victorious. Shortly after, Arranford was transformed into Fort Arran and housed 1,000 soldiers guarding Ormpetarr against its bitter neighbor. Despite his bloody rise to power, Baron Thuragar Foemaster had support from the citizens of Sespech, who approved of his anti-Chondath views. The Baron vowed to bring law to Ormpetarr, securing it from bandit caravan raids and the citys thieves guild. The thieves staged bloody battles in the streets, attempting to rebel against the new Baron. The guildmaster at the time was Haskar Corintis whose disruptive tactics were sponsored by Chondath.

In the century that followed the calamity of the Spellplague, Vilhon Reach was devastated by wild magics, becoming known as the Vilhon Wilds. By the , much of the city was full of half-collapsed and abandoned buildings. When the border of the Plaguewrought Lands stabilized in the center of Ormpetarr, the city became a center for Scar Pilgrimages from whence travelers ventured into the rain Wilds in hopes of acquiring a spellscar. The pilgrimages were inspired by Madruen Morganoug who accidentally became spellscarred with skin aglow in blue fire. His skin absorbed the Spellplague flames, making it almost impervious to swords and daggers. According to the locals, the success rate for the pilgrims looking to get spellscarred was one out of every ten surviving individuals. Significant number of pilgrims perished in the Vilhon Wilds left behind orphans who roamed Ormpetarr in gangs that labored by day and pickpocketed or thieved by night.
