Vilhon Wilds, Chondath
Ormpetarr was the capital city of Sespech in the Vilhon Reach. During the century that followed the Spellplague, Ormpetarr was known as the City of the Scar.
Ormpetarr was an ancient metropolis, protected from the outside dangers by a thick wall. Past the harbor stood the Warehouse Row district. The city was filled with ancient brass spires, famed for their ability to reflect the setting sun like flame. Its straight streets were tightly packed with buildings, homes, and businesses and lit with ordinary lanterns through the night. Helm was the primary deity of the city which was obvious by his symbol on the guards uniforms and wide city squares decorated with silver gauntlet-bearing statues.
As of 1396 DR many of the brass spires lay broken and strewn down the rocky side of a cliff. The city degraded and became notoriously lawless settlement.

In the century that followed the calamity of the Spellplague, Vilhon Reach was devastated by wild magics, becoming known as the Vilhon Wilds. By the , much of the city was full of half-collapsed and abandoned buildings. When the border of the Plaguewrought Lands stabilized in the center of Ormpetarr, the city became a center for Scar Pilgrimages from whence travelers ventured into the rain Wilds in hopes of acquiring a spellscar. The pilgrimages were inspired by Madruen Morganoug who accidentally became spellscarred with skin aglow in blue fire. His skin absorbed the Spellplague flames, making it almost impervious to swords and daggers. According to the locals, the success rate for the pilgrims looking to get spellscarred was one out of every ten surviving individuals. Significant number of pilgrims perished in the Vilhon Wilds left behind orphans who roamed Ormpetarr in gangs that labored by day and pickpocketed or thieved by night.
