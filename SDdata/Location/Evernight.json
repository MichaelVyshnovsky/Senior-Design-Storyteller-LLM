        "mainbody": "'''Evernight''' was the dismal echo of [[Neverwinter]] located in the [[Shadowfell]]. It was a city of the [[undead]] and those that trafficked with them&mdash;unhinged [[necromancer]]s, [[slave]] traders, and followers of dark [[deities]].",
        "Description": "[[File:Evernight MMO loading screen.png|thumb|330px|''Streetlevel in Evernight.'']]\nThe whole city was in disrepair, as if the wood and stone that held the buildings together had the life leeched out of them, becoming rotten and crumbling. The lanes and alleys were paved with grave-dirt trodden and scuffed into a fine dust, while the few cobblestone streets were cratered with potholes. The atmosphere was damp and humid, with a chill wind under a perpetually ashen sky illuminated by feeble moonlight. Much of the city was relatively silent save for sporadic screams of pain and terror.\n\nCertain places throughout the city were bursting with [[necromantic]] power that made lights dimmer, the air colder and more still, attracted the undead, and drained mortals of their stamina. The ambient energies around the city also had the effect of blunting the undead citizens' appetites for flesh and blood, allowing them to carry on with daily unlife.\n\nEvernight was connected with Neverwinter on the [[Material Plane]] via [[Crevices of Dusk]]&mdash;sporadic ''[[portal]]s'' and \"dimensional gaps\"&mdash;that allowed for easy contact between the two [[planes]]. This provided ample opportunity for the undead to snatch living victims from Neverwinter, and in turn, led to many of Neverwinter's urban legends of hauntings and disappearances.",
        "Geography": "[[File:Evernight streets MMO.PNG|thumb|330px|''The gloomy streets of Evernight.'']]\nEvernight had a very similar layout to Neverwinter, with locations that were sometimes forlorn mockeries of their equivalents in that city. It was located on the coast at the mouth of a once fast-flowing and treacherous river that had been replaced by a lava flow following the events of the [[Ruining]]. The western end of the city was often shrouded in mist from the lava where it met the sea while the rest of the city was choked in an ash \"fog\" that came off the river.",
        "Government": {
            "Law and Order": "[[File:Ghoul - DAVE ALLSOP.png|thumb|''A ghoul prepares a grave for a \"funeral\".'']]\nThere were no formal laws in Evernight, although starting a fight or attempting to free slaves or captives was generally grounds to be swarmed and eaten as punishment. When a conflict or disagreement was brought to the tribunal to be resolved, its members proclaimed their verdicts by eating whichever party they found unworthy of their time. Because of this, few citizens petitioned the tribunal unless they had no other option. In some cases, disputes might be resolved without the tribunal's involvement, either by a sanctioned battle to the death in the basement of the House of Screams or by petitioning for intervention from the [[priest]]s of the [[Temple of Filth]], who generally demanded to be repaid for their judgments with services to the temple.\n\nEvernight was a dangerous place for visitors. or carried special tokens afforded to visiting merchants. That said, living people were not usually attacked on-sight because the undead assumed no one would be dumb enough to walk around Evernight without legitimate business, and any undead citizen could demand proof of a mortal's right to be in the city on even the flimsiest of pretenses. Living [[humanoid]]s who were captured within Evernight were rarely eaten right away, and were instead killed slowly by being buried alive in an elaborate \"[[Funeral (Evernight)|funeral]]\" service."
        },
        "Trade": "[[File:Corpse market - DAVE ALLSOP.jpg|thumb|''Delicacies for sale at the Corpse Market.'']]\nEvernight lay at the western end of the [[Shadowfell Road]] and was located at a crossroads in the Shadowfell, making the city a center of commerce in that plane. Evernight imported live meat: those who were lucky became slaves while those who were unlucky became meals. The city had several markets, but the center of commerce was the [[Corpse Market]], a place that almost seemed like any normal busy marketplace except that it sold body parts, blood, slaves, zombie servants, and all manner of unnatural goods. A district of workshops and storehouses was located nearby the Market, and was jealously guarded.\n\nTransactions in Evernight generally involved the exchange of [[gold pieces]], but occasionally favors or flesh might be exchanged instead.",
        "Defenses": "A hungry population of flesh-eaters and blood drinkers was enough of a threat to put off most living adversaries. For enemy undead or necromancers however, the priests of the Temple of Filth had a [[Pool of Daylight|secret doomsday weapon]] hidden away in case their own people were not enough to defend the city. This weapon was said to be a magical [[artifact]] that had the ability to project [[radiant energy]] equivalent to the light of [[Toril]]'s midday sun. Only strong undead creatures were capable of handling it without being instantly destroyed, but even they suffered crippling pain. Once wielded against enemy undead however, hundreds were sure to be destroyed all at once, even under the pall of the Shadowfell. The artifact itself was protected by a shrine in the Temple of Filth, hidden by [[ritual]] magic, behind trapped and cursed doors.",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], [[Bhaal]] and [[Myrkul]] had once been worshiped in Evernight. However, by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], only the very oldest of the city's undead still recalled a time when this was the case. None could recall a time before the appearance of [[Castle Nowhere]], and many assumed that it had simply always existed.\n\nThe [[shadovar]] had an ambassador to Evernight even before their [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return]] to [[Faerûn]] in {{Yearlink|1372}}. Evernight also maintained a diplomatic relationship with [[Thay]] after it became a nation of necromancers and began to take interest in the Shadowfell Road during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. In exchange for humanoid slaves and corpses, the Thayans purchased the right to set up an [[Thayan outpost (Evernight)|outpost]] in the city.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1451}}, when [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted on the Material Plane, so did its [[Mount Hotenow (Shadowfell)|Shadowfell mirror]]. On the Shadowfell though, rather than a pyroclastic flow like the one Neverwinter suffered, Evernight got a slow and perpetual stream of lava that was contained and channeled by the riverbed, evaporating the river water but otherwise not damaging the city save for a few piers.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1479}}, the [[Shadovar–Thay War|tension between the Netherse and Thayans]] was a source of concern for the ghouls of Evernight, and so they forbade these factions from open conflict within the city walls.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Businesses": "* [[Corpse Market]], a bustling marketplace where all manner of bodies&mdash;living, dead, or undead&mdash;could be purchased.\n* [[Deaders Market]], a small marketplace known for selling ghoulish [[alcohol]]ic drinks.\n* [[Lamantha's mortuary]], a taxidermist and mortuary located north of the river.\n* [[Sangora Sanguinaries]], a purveyor of warm blood at the Corpse Market.",
            "Geographic Features": "* [[Black Mound]], a hill in the southwest of the city atop which was an exclusive neighborhood of the same name.\n* [[Demon Pit]], a seemingly bottomless crack in the ground located in the southeast of the city.",
