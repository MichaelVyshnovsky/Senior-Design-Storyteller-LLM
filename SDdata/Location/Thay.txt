or Thayvian
Thay was a mysterious and terribly powerful magocratic nation in east Faerûn, that was long-governed by the Zulkirs of the Red Wizards. During the late 15 century DR, it was ruled by the necromancer lich Szass Tam, along with the Council of Zulkirs, who were supported by a near-endless chain of bureaucrats and local tharchions. The underpinning nature of Thay saw it engaged in an endless pursuit of arcane knowledge and power, a goal chased most ardently by the countrys elite such endeavours were fueled and expedited by rampant slavery, a practice woven into the tapestry of the countrys long, dark history.

For most of Thays history, the country operated under a strict social hierarchy. The Red Wizards were considered the upper echelon of Thayan society, a magocratic noble class that was followed by Mulan bureaucrats, priests, merchants, soldiers, and mixed Mulan-Rashemi artisans and craftspeople. Semi-skilled workers and common laborers were a mere step above the nations great many slaves, a subjugated workforce made up of members of nearly every race within the Realms.
In the years following Szass Tams seizure of power in 1385 DR, the Thayan people led hard, destitute lives. It was a land whose governing philosophy held that undeath was a preferred state of being for its people, full of boundless possibilities and immeasurable power. During most of the 15 century the living had no means to achieve prominence within Thay, as their mere existence was an affront to the beliefs of the High Regent.
To briefly escape the misery of life in the city, many Thayans sought more brutal forms of entertainment. Gladiatorial matches were common in larger cities like Eltabbar and Surthay, perhaps the only events that allowed commoners to succumb to their primal nature without fear of retribution from the upper class. The more ferocious and deadly combatants were celebrated by the throngs of spectators. The brutal gladiators from Thay were considered the finest and most savage in all the Realms.
The Mulani of Thay maintained their peoples tradition of shaving their heads and what little body hair they had. They were indoctrinated during their youth to revere the traditions of their people, obey the laws of Thay and honor those who served within the Red Wizards. Unlike the ethnic Mulani of Mulhorand, Thayans maintained a strong connection to the Art and were proud to send their children to apprenticeship under experienced Red Wizards.
The Rashemi commoners identified less with their cultural origins and saw themselves as citizens of Thay, first and foremost. They shaved their heads in imitation of the aristocratic Mulani, though their darker complexion gave away their ethnic background.
All Thayans believed that fortune was given to the strong-willed rather than those who demonstrated compassion and care. As a people they sought personal power, primal fulfillment and the procurement of wealth.
There were several prevalent music styles customary to the lands of Thay. Among them, powerful Red Wizards and zulkirs were outliers, preferring to listen to exotics pieces of music recorded elsewhere via specialty recording and playback spells. Such outsider music was played by magic and slave musicians, always privately during meditation, spell memorization, and relaxation.
Thays national music could be heard playing outside of the private chambers of the sorcerous ruling class. This common mans music was heavily influenced by slavery and heavily featured heavy drumbeats that set the musics tempo and rhythm, reminiscent of a march. This type of music was played on "walking drums" – a unique percussive instrument found in Thay. These massive drums were half the average height of a human man and were shaped like a spinning top toy. They were strapped to a drummers chest and hammered with special paddles. A single drum orchestra could count to over a dozen musicians. This music was joined by warhorns blasting martial-sounding fanfare. The trumpets joined in one at at a time, beginning with a single horn that began a wandering melodic line to the drum beat, then joined by a counter-melody from the second horn. These sonic duels alternated by brief harmonization of all the instruments, lastly ending in a fanfare-like resolution. This music was also played during military marches and during some long days of slave work.
More private lower-class Thayan music could be heard in homes, clubs, and taverns. Faster melodies to dance to, often by attractive slave servers, staff, or other hired entertainment. These ditties were just as drum-centric, giving the beat to female vocalizations and singing. These drum-songs also came in slower, down-tempo varieties. Other instruments used in this type of music included yartings, piping glaurs, and orthunns. These songs, called "thaeraeden," or " "life-laments," had lyrics of repeated musical phrases that sounded like melancholic questions or challenges. Traditionally, thaeraeden sang about love troubles, commerce, and reputation in the eyes of the powerful Thayan wizards, referred to as "greatspells."
There was little innovation and experimentation in Thayan music, and it remained virtually unchanged for centuries. They rarely incorporated new melodies or new instruments. Thayvian public tended to care little for new songs and preferred to hear old favorite tunes.
Thayans were considerably prejudiced towards non-human races, particularly dwarves and gnomes, who were regularly the subject of racial epithets and provocations to violence. Elves were also held in low regard, though typically avoided and shunned rather than provoked. Orcs and half-orcs were well-tolerated within the badlands, as they were commonly found as enforcers and soldiers within Thayan legions.
By the late 14 century DR, Thay established trade relations with the worshipers of Malphagor who ran one of the districts of Tradesport, a walled island city in the Underdark. Malphagors followers purchased slaves in Thay to be transformed into undead servants and sold along the shores of the Sea of Endless Darkness.

Beginning in the 10 century, Thay maintained a vast "population" of undead zombies, who were enthralled as laborers and porters, moving goods between ships docked in Thays numerous waterways. The number of undead grew exponentially during the decades under Szass Tams rule, following the nations civil war that ended in 1385 DR and, by 1479 DR, Thay had the greatest concentration of undead in all of Faerûn.
The hierarchy of worship in Thay was abundantly clear to everyone within its borders magic was revered first, religion was a distant second. Despite the common misconception, The Red Wizards did not worship fiends nor did they consider the Tanarri or Baatezu as gods. They saw demons as dangerous allies, servants or for the extremely arrogant, tools that could be manipulated to accomplish their goals. In fact, the Red Wizards simply did not have time that could be devoted to worship, and merely offered hollow words of worship to their patron deities, and only truly valued the power of the arcane.
Although the Mulan people continued the worship of their old gods after they were transported to Toril by ancient Imaskar via a series of portals, they did so in that lands of future-Thay with names that were different from their neighbors in Mulhorand and Unther. Anhur, the Mulhorandi god of war, was known as "Ramathant", and came to count the Red Wizards as among his greatest enemies. Similarly, Horus-Re was known as "Helcaliant", and Isis as "Isharia".
Many of the evil-aligned deities of the Faerûnian pantheon had devoted sects in Thay, including Beshaba, Loviatar, Malar, Shar, Umberlee, the demi-power Gargauth and even incorporated non-human powers such as Jubilex, the aspect of Ghaunadaur, Vaprak and even Lolth. The church of Cyric was extremely popular for a brief time following his ascension in the Time of Troubles, though it waned greatly as the god was driven mad after reading the Cyrinishad. however it exploded in popularity following the events of the Salamander War.
For centuries, Thay was ruled by a council of eight powerful mages known as zulkirs, each of whom specialized in a different school of magic. This Council of Zulkirs appointed the nations tharchions and tharchionesses, civil governors of the realm who ruled over the vast provinces of Thay, known as "tharchs". Each tharchion chose their own "autharch", who acted as mayors, military commanders and magistrates, to enact their will over their lands and take blame as a scapegoat, should the need arise. Their enclaves were led by "khazarks", who held approximately the same authority as the autharchs, albeit in strongholds located in foreign countries.
Each governing official was indebted to their superior, which created a sense of suspicion and fear among the nations bureaucrats. Various rival factions and competing interests arose as a result of this dynamic, and the nation was not able to unite under a single vision for many years. There was heavy turnover among the lesser bureaucrats, as each authority could assign blame in descending order of importance. While only the Red Wizards acted with real independence, their ranks were afflicted by similar scheming and in-fighting.
This lack of unification continued for many years, until Szass Tam seized power as the regent and supreme ruler of Thay, during the chaos of the Spellplague. Thereafter, the zulkirs served as his vassals and the tharchions and lesser magistrates fell in line.
* Red Wizards The Red Wizards served as a quasi-military organization within the hierarchy of Thay. They were independently-operating agents who answered only to their own superiors, a stature often denoted by the wizards own personal power and influence. They were protected by the "knights" of Thay, martial enforcers who would readily lay down their lives to save those of the Red Wizards.
*Council of Zulkirs Chosen from among the most powerful of the Red Wizards, this loosely-structured council was composed of eight magocratic rulers, each of which specialized in one of the schools of magic. a number of liches were appointed to the council, who served as Szass Tams vassals.
* Guild of Foreign Trade This administrative organization oversaw the purchase of magical items, from the private arcane workshops owned by Thays reigning zulkirs, and facilitated their export and sale via the nations enclaves. The guild was a driving force of Thays foreign economy.
*Guild of Portages Prior to the 11 century DR, this group was responsible for the conveyance of goods between the rivers of Thay. They were known for charging exorbitant rates for their portage, but were replaced by the undead slaves of Shevas Tam.
The ownership, sale and creation of slaves was legal within the borders of Thay.
While it was illegal for anyone from Thay to sell items of military value outside the nation, this law was often individually ignored, and loosely enforced nations famous enclaves found across the Realms. 
In addition to operating under the laws of their home nation, the Red Wizard compounds were regulated by the Three Laws of the Enclave. These laws provided diplomatic immunity to the Red Wizards serving within an enclave and were required to be agreed upon by foreign city officials. 
*The Law of Sovereignty stated that any enclave located outside of Thays borders was still considered Thayan soil, and was subject to Thays laws and regulations. 
*The Law of Trade dictated that they sell their goods for 10% less than the standard rate and could both sell and accept slaves as payment (however their sale was impractical due to local laws outside the enclave).
*The Law of Crafting regulated which goods the Red Wizards would, and would not, sell to the general public.

By 1385 DR the warring factions of Thay arrived at a stalemate. Szass Tam held the northern tharchs of Gauros, Lapendrar, Surthay, Delhumide and Thaymount, while the other zulkirs maintained a hold over Priador, Eltabbar, Tyraturos, Thazalhar, Pyarados, and the islands of Alaor. In Ches, Hezass Nymar, the tharchion of Lapendrar warned the council that Szass Tam was planning an assault on the Keep of Sorrows.
On Tarsakh 29, the legions of northern Thay marched upon the Keep of Sorrows. While the council attempted to pincer Tams forces against the keeps walls, the atropal Xingax created an artificial darkness over the battlefield, summoned undead horrors and turned the time of the battle in Tams favor. Just before the lich could claim victory, the goddess of magic, Mystra was killed, and the blue flames of the Spellplague ravaged Thay and all of Toril. Arcane magic ceased to function properly and pure chaos broke out on the battlefield. Tams legions took the keep and the council forces withdrew to the isolated town of Zolum.
As a result of the Spellplague, the Thayan plateau rose thousands of feet in height and altered its place on the face of Toril. Rivers took new courses across the lands and the volcanoes of Thaymount erupted in violent explosions. These geological events began to reshape the previously-controlled Thayan landscape. Some cities were destroyed while others were unrecognizable. The icy glaciers of High Thay began to melt, which sent boulders and debris tumbling down the Second Escarpment down to the greater plateau. Volcanic ash filled the sky and the magically-protected climate of Thay was no more.
After a few more skirmishes fought in confusion, Szass Tam made a pact with the dark god Bane. In exchange for insight into the changed function and form of arcane magic, along with powers to rule over Thay for the next 1000 years, he offered forth his soul, and promised that divine worship in his kingdom would be solely dedicated to the Black Lord.
Tams greatest victory came at Thralgard Keep on Eleint 15. The lichs legions rebuked the attack of the councils legions, aided by the dream vestige summoned forth by the powers lent by the god Bane. The council fled south and briefly regrouped in Bezantur, before sailing off for Escalant in the Wizards Reach to the west. Szass Tam was greeted in Bezantur to cheers and adulation. He summoned a magical storm to slow the fleet of the Red Wizards, and sent his own forces after them. As the council ships gained the upper hand in the sea battle, Szass Tam withdrew his forces and allowed the Council of Zulkirs to leave Thay.
On the eve of his coronation as High Regent, Szass Tam gained great magical insight in the form of an ancient tome that described the Ritual of the unmaking. He begun construction on several Dread Rings, great fortresses that served as markers for the arcane power that coursed through all of Thay that, upon completion of the ritual, could potentially erase all of existence as it was known throughout the Realms.
While the lands, waters and skies of Thay had been ravaged by war and magic during the end of the 14 century, the following decades saw a great transformation among the nations people. The living people of Thay were increasingly disregarded as the Red Wizards fully embraced a new existence as vampires, liches and other servitors of undeath. Seats within the reformed Zulkir Council were filled by the most powerful of these undead arcanists.
On Midwinter 1478 DR, Bareris Anskuld uncovered a book from the former house of Druxus Rhym that illuminated the grand scheme that Szass Tam had been working on over the past 90 years. After reuniting with the leader of the Brotherhood of the Griffon, Aoth Fezim, Bareris brought his discovery to the remaining zulkirs of old Thay that lived in exile within the Wizards Reach.
thumb|A map of Thay from the Crimson Gold.
Thay was divided into 11 tharchs, each ruled by a separate tharchion.
Alaor
This small but essential tharch, only encompassed the small, craggy island of the same name in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Despite its size, it housed Thays largest naval base and was vital to the nations navy.
 Delhumide
The tharch of Delhumide consisted of the lands immediately east and north of Lake Thaylambar atop the plateau. The regions namesake city, along with many other settlements, were largely destroyed in Thays war for independence from Mulhorand. 
 Eltabbar
One of the most important regions of Thay, this tharch was home to the magocratic nations capital of the same name. While it was previously unstable and rife with political uncertainty, by the late 14 century it had come under authoritative control. It was located on the northern half of the Thayan plateau, overlooked by the north-facing cliffs of Thaymount. 
*Eltabbar The former capital of Thay was a sprawling, densely-populated city over half of its inhabitants were slaves of the Thayan ruling-class.
Gauros
 This small region, located on the northeastern portion of the plateau east of the River Gauros, featured the mineral-rich Gorge of Gauros. It had been seen a great number of conflicts between the Thayans and Rashemi warriors.
Lapendrar
Extending beyond the Thayan plateau out to Escalant and the Sea of Fallen Stars, this region was bisected by the River Lapendrar. Following the Spellplague it was known as the "Contested Lands". 
* Amruthar While they maintained official independence from Thay, this free-city was governed by a puppet-ruler of Thay before it was destroyed and reformed by canals of molten lava during the Spellplague.
*Escalant The coastal city wavered between Untheric control, independence and Thayan control during the 14 century.
*Nethentir This "gateway city" guarded the path of entry into Thay that wound up the First Escarpment.
*Tilbrand While technically under the reign of Thay, Tilbrand was too far removed from the Thayan Plateau to be effectively governed, and its people maintained strong ties with Aglarond.
Priador
 This coastal area encompassed nearly all of Thays southern border, beyond the First Escarpment and was the most-recently established tharch in Thay.
* Bezantur While Eltabbar was the capital of Thay, the metropolis of Bezantur was considered the heart of the magocratic nation. It was a prosperous but foreboding port city where any vice or depravity could be indulged.
*Murbant The citizens of this coastal city lived of fishermen, smugglers and slave-masters of the vast, surrounding plantation-estates.
*Thasselen Largely destroyed during the Salamander War, Thasselen fell into disarray under the rule of Aznar Thrul in the decades that followed.
 Pyarados
Situated on the southeastern portion of Thay, west of the River Thazarim, this tharch was highly-valued for its access to the mineral-rich Sunrise Mountains east of the First Escarpment. 
*Pyarados The namesake city of the tharch was a lawless, frontier town of the east that served as a waypoint for those who sought to explore the Sunrise mountains and the eastern lands beyond its peaks.
Surthay
 Strong garrisons dotted this tharch, whose lands bordered the southern coast of Lake Mulsantir, in strong defiance to the northern lands of Rashemen. During the 14 century, Tharchion Homen Odesseiron would occasionally lead his considerable forces on raids into the lands of the Wychlaran.
*Surthay The northern-most Thayan city was a vital military stronghold for the nations continuous, contentions with the Rashemi to the north. 
Thaymount
Located directly in the center of Thay, this tharch had a rich history of military might, its forces serving as reserves for the outlying regions. The range of volcanic mountains, from which the region drew its name, loomed over the region and filled its skies with smoke and cinder.. 
*The Citadel This ancient, magical fortress was built before humans lived in Thay, and served as the seat of power for Regent Szass Tam during the 15 century. 
Thazalhar
This southeastern region of Thay housed the trade routes that linked Thay and the frontier of Mulhorand,
*Thazar Keep This stronghold was taken over by the undead forces of Szass Tam in 1375 DR.
*Thazrumaros 
Tyratauros
A vast province in the southern end of the plateau, Tyraturos had a number of vital trade routes running through its borders, including the Eastern Way and the High Road.
*Tyraturos This filthy, but vital trade city was located at the crossroads of Thays two main trade routes.
*Solzepar
Thays weather was magically manipulated by the Red Wizards. But in its natural state, snow was a common sight on the Thayan lands of high elevation, such as the Thaymount and the Sunset Mountains, while in the High Thay plateau, snow was rare. It received occasional hoar frosts and sleet storms. As a whole, Thays temperature extremes between daylight and night caused regular ground fogs that were more common than other forms of precipitation. When snow or rain did happen, they were brief, sometimes powerful downpours that moved across Thay speedily, with the moving storm front seen from afar.
Under Red Wizards control, Thay received steady nighttime rains to boost the nations agriculture and hinder roaming monstrous marauders, bandits, and rebels.
Notably, several species of fey creatures had been hunted to the brink of extinction in Thay due to the spell-fortifying properties of fairy dust.
Few invasions ever overcame the great mountains girding the Plateau of Thay, and the secretive and suspicious Red Wizards raised barriers just as formidable to discourage travelers from venturing into their lands. Despite its seclusion and rather paranoid inhabitants, Thay was a largely fertile region, full of farms and orchards that received ample water from a number of flowing rivers and a deep lake rich with aquatic life. 
During the Spellplague however, the plateau of Thay rose thousands of feet above Toril, melting its glaciers and causing great volcanic eruptions within Thaymount. Over the following century, it became a dark and foreboding land of lifeless badlands, windswept mountains and barren deserts. By the 15 century, the skies over Thay were plagued with ash and smoke that spewed skyward from the volcanic peaks of Thaymount.
Regions 
*Plateau of Thay This formerly lush and verdant oasis held most of Thays population. While it previously held grand slave plantations, cities and fortresses, it transformed into an expanse of arid badlands during the 15 century.
*First Escarpment Offering a nigh-surmountable natural barrier, this sheer cliffside elevated the plateau above the surrounding badlands. Its walls ranged anywhere from 50 (15.2 m) to over 200 (61 m) in height, but rose thousands of feet during the Spellplague.
* Second Escarpment Similar to the outer escarpment, this inner cliffside elevated the mountains of Thaymount above the surrounding region. Within its walls were a number of gold mines and hidden garrisons, granting the Red Wizards tight control over who traveled in and out of the volcanic peaks.
Mountains
* Thaymount These rugged, volcanic mountains were located at the center of Thay, atop the Second Escarpment atop its innermost plateau. A "dampening field" over the mountain range, established some time in the late 13 century, prevented magical scrying or divination spells from granting insight over the area to anyone who attempted to spy upon the tightly-controlled region of the Red Wizards domain.
*Sunrise Mountains Forming the eastern border of Thay, these mountains were rough, hard-traveled peaks that were rich with minerals, including copper.
Bodies of Water
*Alamber Sea The neutral waters south of Thay encompassed the primary trade routes between Thay, Mulhorand, Unther and Tymanther.
* Lake Thaylambar The deep waters of this vast icy lake were rich with sea life, including great schools of fish and even seldom-seen dragon turtles. It was located in central Thay and fed the rivers Thay and Thazarim.
Rivers
*River Gauros Flowing north from the Sunrise Mountains, past the ruins of Delhumide, this river was surrounded by barren lands that had little life or vegetation.
*River Lapendrar Thays second-longest river was an important trade route for the southern tharchs. It flowed from Thaymount, southwest past the escarpments before pouring into the Alamber Sea near the city of Escalant.
*River Thay Spanning the northeastern portion of the Thayan plateau, this vast river was vital to the nations economy, particularly the northern tharchs.
*River of the Dawn This river on the southern end of Thazalhar, marked the border between Thay and Mulhorand.
*River Umber Rather unimportant in comparison to the Realms other waterways, this river flowed east from Thaymount, granting the Thayans a means to convey goods and forces in their conflicts with nearby Aglarond. 
*River Sur This shorter river was rather narrow and fast at the First Escarpment but widened and slowed down before opening into Lake Mulsantir west of the Surmarsh. It formed Thays northern border with the nation of Thesk.
*River Thazarim Located on the eastern side of Thay, between Pyarados and the Sunrise Mountains, this southern-flowing river featured a number of magnificent waterfalls before pouring into the Alamber Sea.
Swamps
*Surmarsh This bleak and putrid swamp was was a select hunting ground for those Thayan nobles who sought to hunt down horrid creatures. Its feverish waters were plagued by tribes of lizardfolk, abhorrent ropers, otyughs and slithermorphs, the rare undead known as skuz and even black dragons.
*Burning Braziers A group of militant Kossuthan priests that maintained a chapterhouse in the Flaming Brazier in Eltabbar.
*Black Flame Zealots An order of Kossuthan assassins.
*Brothers and Sisters of the Pure Flame
*Order of the Salamander
*Thayan gladiator
