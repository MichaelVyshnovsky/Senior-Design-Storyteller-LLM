or Thayvian
Thay was a mysterious and terribly powerful magocratic nation in east Faerûn, that was long-governed by the Zulkirs of the Red Wizards. During the late 15 century DR, it was ruled by the necromancer lich Szass Tam, along with the Council of Zulkirs, who were supported by a near-endless chain of bureaucrats and local tharchions. The underpinning nature of Thay saw it engaged in an endless pursuit of arcane knowledge and power, a goal chased most ardently by the countrys elite such endeavours were fueled and expedited by rampant slavery, a practice woven into the tapestry of the countrys long, dark history.

For most of Thays history, the country operated under a strict social hierarchy. The Red Wizards were considered the upper echelon of Thayan society, a magocratic noble class that was followed by Mulan bureaucrats, priests, merchants, soldiers, and mixed Mulan-Rashemi artisans and craftspeople. Semi-skilled workers and common laborers were a mere step above the nations great many slaves, a subjugated workforce made up of members of nearly every race within the Realms.
In the years following Szass Tams seizure of power in 1385 DR, the Thayan people led hard, destitute lives. It was a land whose governing philosophy held that undeath was a preferred state of being for its people, full of boundless possibilities and immeasurable power. During most of the 15 century the living had no means to achieve prominence within Thay, as their mere existence was an affront to the beliefs of the High Regent.
To briefly escape the misery of life in the city, many Thayans sought more brutal forms of entertainment. Gladiatorial matches were common in larger cities like Eltabbar and Surthay, perhaps the only events that allowed commoners to succumb to their primal nature without fear of retribution from the upper class. The more ferocious and deadly combatants were celebrated by the throngs of spectators. The brutal gladiators from Thay were considered the finest and most savage in all the Realms.
The Mulani of Thay maintained their peoples tradition of shaving their heads and what little body hair they had. They were indoctrinated during their youth to revere the traditions of their people, obey the laws of Thay and honor those who served within the Red Wizards. Unlike the ethnic Mulani of Mulhorand, Thayans maintained a strong connection to the Art and were proud to send their children to apprenticeship under experienced Red Wizards.
The Rashemi commoners identified less with their cultural origins and saw themselves as citizens of Thay, first and foremost. They shaved their heads in imitation of the aristocratic Mulani, though their darker complexion gave away their ethnic background.
All Thayans believed that fortune was given to the strong-willed rather than those who demonstrated compassion and care. As a people they sought personal power, primal fulfillment and the procurement of wealth.
There were several prevalent music styles customary to the lands of Thay. Among them, powerful Red Wizards and zulkirs were outliers, preferring to listen to exotics pieces of music recorded elsewhere via specialty recording and playback spells. Such outsider music was played by magic and slave musicians, always privately during meditation, spell memorization, and relaxation.
Thays national music could be heard playing outside of the private chambers of the sorcerous ruling class. This common mans music was heavily influenced by slavery and heavily featured heavy drumbeats that set the musics tempo and rhythm, reminiscent of a march. This type of music was played on "walking drums" – a unique percussive instrument found in Thay. These massive drums were half the average height of a human man and were shaped like a spinning top toy. They were strapped to a drummers chest and hammered with special paddles. A single drum orchestra could count to over a dozen musicians. This music was joined by warhorns blasting martial-sounding fanfare. The trumpets joined in one at at a time, beginning with a single horn that began a wandering melodic line to the drum beat, then joined by a counter-melody from the second horn. These sonic duels alternated by brief harmonization of all the instruments, lastly ending in a fanfare-like resolution. This music was also played during military marches and during some long days of slave work.
More private lower-class Thayan music could be heard in homes, clubs, and taverns. Faster melodies to dance to, often by attractive slave servers, staff, or other hired entertainment. These ditties were just as drum-centric, giving the beat to female vocalizations and singing. These drum-songs also came in slower, down-tempo varieties. Other instruments used in this type of music included yartings, piping glaurs, and orthunns. These songs, called "thaeraeden," or " "life-laments," had lyrics of repeated musical phrases that sounded like melancholic questions or challenges. Traditionally, thaeraeden sang about love troubles, commerce, and reputation in the eyes of the powerful Thayan wizards, referred to as "greatspells."
There was little innovation and experimentation in Thayan music, and it remained virtually unchanged for centuries. They rarely incorporated new melodies or new instruments. Thayvian public tended to care little for new songs and preferred to hear old favorite tunes.
Thayans were considerably prejudiced towards non-human races, particularly dwarves and gnomes, who were regularly the subject of racial epithets and provocations to violence. Elves were also held in low regard, though typically avoided and shunned rather than provoked. Orcs and half-orcs were well-tolerated within the badlands, as they were commonly found as enforcers and soldiers within Thayan legions.
By the late 14 century DR, Thay established trade relations with the worshipers of Malphagor who ran one of the districts of Tradesport, a walled island city in the Underdark. Malphagors followers purchased slaves in Thay to be transformed into undead servants and sold along the shores of the Sea of Endless Darkness.

Beginning in the 10 century, Thay maintained a vast "population" of undead zombies, who were enthralled as laborers and porters, moving goods between ships docked in Thays numerous waterways. The number of undead grew exponentially during the decades under Szass Tams rule, following the nations civil war that ended in 1385 DR and, by 1479 DR, Thay had the greatest concentration of undead in all of Faerûn.
The hierarchy of worship in Thay was abundantly clear to everyone within its borders magic was revered first, religion was a distant second. Despite the common misconception, The Red Wizards did not worship fiends nor did they consider the Tanarri or Baatezu as gods. They saw demons as dangerous allies, servants or for the extremely arrogant, tools that could be manipulated to accomplish their goals. In fact, the Red Wizards simply did not have time that could be devoted to worship, and merely offered hollow words of worship to their patron deities, and only truly valued the power of the arcane.
Although the Mulan people continued the worship of their old gods after they were transported to Toril by ancient Imaskar via a series of portals, they did so in that lands of future-Thay with names that were different from their neighbors in Mulhorand and Unther. Anhur, the Mulhorandi god of war, was known as "Ramathant", and came to count the Red Wizards as among his greatest enemies. Similarly, Horus-Re was known as "Helcaliant", and Isis as "Isharia".
Many of the evil-aligned deities of the Faerûnian pantheon had devoted sects in Thay, including Beshaba, Loviatar, Malar, Shar, Umberlee, the demi-power Gargauth and even incorporated non-human powers such as Jubilex, the aspect of Ghaunadaur, Vaprak and even Lolth. The church of Cyric was extremely popular for a brief time following his ascension in the Time of Troubles, though it waned greatly as the god was driven mad after reading the Cyrinishad. however it exploded in popularity following the events of the Salamander War.
For centuries, Thay was ruled by a council of eight powerful mages known as zulkirs, each of whom specialized in a different school of magic. This Council of Zulkirs appointed the nations tharchions and tharchionesses, civil governors of the realm who ruled over the vast provinces of Thay, known as "tharchs". Each tharchion chose their own "autharch", who acted as mayors, military commanders and magistrates, to enact their will over their lands and take blame as a scapegoat, should the need arise. Their enclaves were led by "khazarks", who held approximately the same authority as the autharchs, albeit in strongholds located in foreign countries.
Each governing official was indebted to their superior, which created a sense of suspicion and fear among the nations bureaucrats. Various rival factions and competing interests arose as a result of this dynamic, and the nation was not able to unite under a single vision for many years. There was heavy turnover among the lesser bureaucrats, as each authority could assign blame in descending order of importance. While only the Red Wizards acted with real independence, their ranks were afflicted by similar scheming and in-fighting.
This lack of unification continued for many years, until Szass Tam seized power as the regent and supreme ruler of Thay, during the chaos of the Spellplague. Thereafter, the zulkirs served as his vassals and the tharchions and lesser magistrates fell in line.
* Red Wizards The Red Wizards served as a quasi-military organization within the hierarchy of Thay. They were independently-operating agents who answered only to their own superiors, a stature often denoted by the wizards own personal power and influence. They were protected by the "knights" of Thay, martial enforcers who would readily lay down their lives to save those of the Red Wizards.
*Council of Zulkirs Chosen from among the most powerful of the Red Wizards, this loosely-structured council was composed of eight magocratic rulers, each of which specialized in one of the schools of magic. a number of liches were appointed to the council, who served as Szass Tams vassals.
* Guild of Foreign Trade This administrative organization oversaw the purchase of magical items, from the private arcane workshops owned by Thays reigning zulkirs, and facilitated their export and sale via the nations enclaves. The guild was a driving force of Thays foreign economy.
*Guild of Portages Prior to the 11 century DR, this group was responsible for the conveyance of goods between the rivers of Thay. They were known for charging exorbitant rates for their portage, but were replaced by the undead slaves of Shevas Tam.
The ownership, sale and creation of slaves was legal within the borders of Thay.
While it was illegal for anyone from Thay to sell items of military value outside the nation, this law was often individually ignored, and loosely enforced nations famous enclaves found across the Realms. 
In addition to operating under the laws of their home nation, the Red Wizard compounds were regulated by the Three Laws of the Enclave. These laws provided diplomatic immunity to the Red Wizards serving within an enclave and were required to be agreed upon by foreign city officials. 
*The Law of Sovereignty stated that any enclave located outside of Thays borders was still considered Thayan soil, and was subject to Thays laws and regulations. 
*The Law of Trade dictated that they sell their goods for 10% less than the standard rate and could both sell and accept slaves as payment (however their sale was impractical due to local laws outside the enclave).
*The Law of Crafting regulated which goods the Red Wizards would, and would not, sell to the general public.

The nation was predominantly agrarian. The lush plantations of the Thayan plateau were rich with fields of wheat, oat, and barley and its orchards produced a variety of fruits, such as apples, citron, pears and figs. Enough food was harvested that the nation could feed those citizens it deemed worthy, with enough goods leftover that could be exported in trade.
Prior to the Spellplague, Thay exported a variety of goods to other nations, as they regularly had an excess of grain and other foodstuffs to feed their own people. Both Chessenta and Thesk were dependent on Thayan exports to feed their people. Other exports included uniquely crafted furniture, sculptures, household items and jewelry crafted by slave craftspeople. These fine goods were often made from gold, silver or platinum, all of which were readily available from Thays plentiful mines, as well as jade and lapis.
Thay was famous throughout the Realms for the trade of magical items, an industry sponsored by the Red Wizards, who sold their crafted goods in the major cities of Faerûn. In addition to acquiring wealth from the sale of arcane curios that were manufactured in Thay, these enclaves were used to gather intelligence, another valuable commodity, for the Red Wizards and Council of Zulkirs. Among the Faerûnian cities known to have enclaves were Athkatla, Baldurs Gate, Proskur, Ravens Bluff, Scardale and Waterdeep, among others.
Slavery was a common practice in Thay, a tradition that continued on from the ancient empire of Mulhorand. Somewhat ironically, the slaves themselves were the nations most important resource, Despite this, slaves were often treated terribly, even compared to other slave societies. Aside from the typical degradations, slaves in Thay were subject to magical experimentations, being fed to exotic monsters, or being sacrificed in dark rituals and ceremonies. During the mid-14 century DR something between two-thirds and eight-tenths of Thays living sentient population were slaves, making up half of the urban population and seven-eighths of the countryside.
The zulkirs and other prominent Red Wizards grew rich beyond imagination by means of this sinister trade. From within their strongholds and estates, they used this wealth to constantly scheme and plot for mercantile and military domination of neighboring nations.
The loose and arbitrary laws of Thay used enslavement as the default punishment for most crimes instead of imprisonment or banishment. Many slaves were of Rashemi origin, but Thays aggressive slave-trading practices meant that the majority were of other ethnicities. Agents from Thay traveled the world and legally bought criminals and life-sentenced slaves, while dedicated crews of brigands were hired to simply raid and kidnap whoever they could from the Inner Sea. Thay did not generally export slaves, and recently arrived slaves were never knowingly sold back if their friends and family made an offer. Instead, the rescuer was liable to be enslaved themselves. By the laws of Thay, any slave bought there was forever a slave, with no manumission possible. While escape and rescue was possible, any "free" slave would be treated as free property to be claimed, and the best that one could hope for was to please their master and be retired from labor.
Slaves were utterly forbidden from shaving or cutting their hair, whether on their head or body. While even poor free folk kept their hair short and the upper classes shaved entirely, slaves were forced to keep whatever hair they grew—and keep it clean and reasonably presentable, lest its state offend their betters. While it could be tied and piled up atop their heads for convenience while working, in any other situations their hair had to be kept down to avoid any possible confusion. With permission they could have it trimmed to merely mid-back length, and if a medical treatment required shaving their master would have to weigh whether or not the slave was worth the trouble. If the slave was shaved and saved, they would have to be kept in seclusion until their hair grew back, lest they be seen in public and mistaken for a free person.
Thays predilection for aggressive and highly destructive wars with its neighbors demanded that its agriculture was handled by slaves while the free lower classes were used up in battle. While other lands relied on independent farmers and small landholders, Thay had no yeoman farmer middle class at all. Instead of scattered small villages, most Thayan agriculture was performed on huge centralized slave farms and plantations, owned by the nobility and often guarded by unpleasant centaurs. These farms covered most of the arable land in Thay, with each region having a central town where everyone lived in between field work. These included fields of several kinds of wheat, fruit orchards, and cattle pastures, and this produce found its way to many realms that would otherwise never deal with Thay. Slaves from these farms were also deployed to perform repairs and maintenance on nearby roads, docks, and other pieces of infrastructure.
Thay earned great wealth from a number of vast, slave-harvested timber plantations. Due to their readily-available work force, Thay was able to ship out great amounts of lumber cut from pine, maple and regional Thayan blackwood trees.
Slaves were also tasked with mining, and being sent to the mines was considered among the worst possible fates for slaves. The Thayvian gold mines were no exception, and vast amounts of gold was brought up by the efforts of Thaymounts slaves.
The nation of Thay possessed what was likely the strongest military in east Faerûn ever seen by the 14 century DR. However they were rarely, if ever, led effectively in thanks to the competitive bickering that permeated the Thayan ruling class. Each zulkir and tharchion were empowered to raise their own legion, limited only to their own personal capital. Many Red Wizards supplemented their forces with magical beasts, such as Zulkir Maligor and the darkenbeasts he used to complement his legion of gnolls. Red Wizards would always fight alongside their legions in every military engagement, if only to preserve order among the mixed and often-chaotic armies.
During the 15 century, the armies of Thay were largely composed of ruthless undead, including skeletons, ghouls, boneclaws, wraiths and liches under the command of Regent Szass Tams necromancers. The Dread Legions were regiments of particularly cunning skeletal and zombified warriors who fought without fear of death or destruction. They supplemented these undead legions with many monstrous creatures including tieflings, ash giants and Abyssal myrmidons.
Infantry legions ranged in size anywhere from 800 to 2,000 soldiers and were composed of a wide range of forces, from armored knights, human slaves,[https//twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/748361030762266627] goblins, gnolls, and undead warriors. The Thayan army was notorious for their use of monstrous giant-kin such as trolls, ogres and hill giants. In fact, one of Thays finely-trained, deadliest regiments was Gruumshs Legion, a unit comprised entirely of orcs and orogs. Thayan breeding experiments led to the creation of neo-orogs, and both the black and red breeds were found within its borders in significant numbers.
The humanoid soldiers of Thay often wore armor of mirror-bright silver that gave off blinding reflections. Beneath the armor they wore white cloth slipcovers to prevent over-heating and betraying their location. Slaves were typically given sandal-boots, spears, headscarves, loincloths, and&mdashif they were lucky&mdasha baldric hung with waterskins.
The riders of Thay were an even more diverse group of nearly-unarmored lancers, mounted archers and heavy knights who rode a wide variety of mounts ranging from  giant cats, manticores, leucrotta, hippogriffs, giant beetles and very seldom, dragons. as was the infamous black unicorn cavalry, a regiment of all-female riders that were widely-feared throughout the Realms.
The nation of Thay kept a small, but highly-efficient navy based out of a naval base located on the island-tharch of Alaor. They were much more regimented than the infantry and cavalry, as they all fell under the authority of Alaors tharchion. As of the 14 century, the navy was composed of several hundred magically-aided ships led by the great and terrifying metallic vessel called the Red Scourge.
The Thayvian navy swept the coasts of the Alamber Sea for hidden pirate villages, and enslaved whatever pirates they could catch, in addition to sometimes enslaving random fishing villages. However, the navy did not use slaves as galley rowers, instead using paid specialized crew.
Thayan vessels were named using magic-related themes such as spells, schools of magic, or wizards, such as Alkammar, Black Tentacle, Enchanter, or Lightning Bolt.
The nation of Thay came about when a sect, calling itself the Red Wizards, inspired by the archmage Thayd, declared its freedom from the god-kings of Mulhorand. The sects center of strength was in the northern provinces where the natives did not have the inbred reverence for the god-kings. After razing the city of Delhumide they declared themselves the free nation of Thay in 922 DR, under the leadership of the Red Wizard Ythazz Buvaar. Since then, Mulhorand has defended itself, quite successfully, against two invasions from Thay.
The small upstart nation quickly prospered with their vast slave-driven economy. With a lust for greater power, a group of renegade Red Wizards attempted their first march on Rashemen in 934 DR, and faced a costly defeat in the Gorge of Gauros by the Witches of Rashemen. Despite the temporary economic setback, Thay grew rapidly and ranks of the greedy, imperialistic Red Wizards swelled too large for them to effectively govern their own people. After years of bickering during the 10 century DR, the Red Wizards decided upon their system of rule and formed the Council of Zulkirs. One master of each of the eight schools of magic had a seat on the council, who in turn collectively appointed the tharchions who ruled over their given tharch.
A few dissident Red Wizards disagreed with this system of rule and attempted to seize the nation for themselves during the 11 century. Their forces were put down by the Zulkirs in 1074 DR.
The armies of Thay marched on Aglarond and Rashemen many times and folk feared that the time would soon come when the zulkirs mobilized again. One such undertaking occurred in the year 1201 DR, when the newly-appointed zulkir of evocation, Narvonna Kren, formed a tenuous alliance with the established zulkir of illusion Nymor Thrul and infamous lich and zulkir of necromancy, Szass Tam, in an attempted invasion of Aglarond. The assault was ultimately unsuccessful and the Gray Sisters repelled the Thayan forces in the Yuirwood and Zulkir Thrul was blamed for the failure by Tam. The dark lich suffocated the master illusionist, which left a power vacuum within the Council of Zulkirs. Chaos ensued as a number of lesser wizards competed for the high seat of office and Szass Tam withdrew his forces to his private estate, disgusted with the behavior of his colleagues.
In 1357 DR, the tharchion of Lapendrar Hargrid Tenslayer joined forces with the zulkirs of evocation and conjuration in what was the then-most-ambitious plan of conquest ever undertaken in Thay. By means of powerful magic, the trio appealed to Fyzzar, Lord of the Salamanders, and Grand Sultan Marrake of the efreeti within the City of Brass, to aid Thay in a ruthless campaign against the independent coastal cities of the Alamber Sea and Sea of Fallen Stars. In return, the Red Wizards and tharchion promised then to maintain a permanent portal on Toril, that connected the Prime Material plane to the Elemental Plane of Fire. However, this agreement was struck without the approval or favor of Kossuth, the primordial Lord of Flame.
While the Thayans originally intended to simply banish the elemental forces once the zulkirs seized the lands they desired, the Red Wizards were only able to send the efreeti back to their other-planar domain and the voracious salamanders ran rampant across Priador. Having brought their nation to the brink of annihilation, the outmatched triumvirate reached out to the rest of the Council of Zulkirs and began fighting back against the elemental reptiles with the combined forces Thays standing army, monstrous humanoids such as gnolls and goblin-kin, and the vast undead forces of Szass Tam which had been reluctantly withdrawn from an offensive in Rashemen. The Salamander War, as it came to be known, lasted for over a year until Aznar Thrul made a grand appeal to Kossuth. The Lord of Flame sent his own elementals to Faerûn and drove the salamanders horde out from Thay. Worship of Kossuth grew exponentially in Thay and its political landscape was permanently changed for decades to come.
In 1375 DR, a rift had been growing within Council of Zulkirs and opposing factions were forming under the leadership of Aznar Thrul and the necromantic lich Szass Tam. In Mirtul of that year, Tam arranged a series of events that would divide the nation and place himself in a position to ascend as its savior. First, he assassinated his strongest ally, Druxus Rhym, which was blamed on his rival Thrul, and supplanted the transmuter as zulkir with the easily-controllable Samas Kul, aided by his confidant Dmitra Flass. Second, he orchestrated a Rashemi counter-attack on an unsanctioned invasion of Rashemen in the Gorge of Gauros, led by the tharchs Azhir Kren and Homen Odesseiron, proceeded to rescue their forces at precisely the right moment and rewrote the narrative in their favor, Lastly he manufactured the menace of an undead horde that threatened all of eastern Thay.
By Kythorn 5 of that year, Tam had Aznar Thrul killed by an undead abomination, in preparation for his appeal to the Council of Zulkirs. On Mirtul 11, Szass Tam appealed the council that he be named regent, for a temporary time, so that he may rid the nation of its threats and return Thay to prosperity. Unfortunately for the lich, Dmitra Flass had uncovered his scheme with the assistance of her spymaster, Malark Springhill, and approached the council about her misgivings beforehand. After entire council voted against Tams proposal, riots broke out in the capital of Eltabbar, clamoring for Szass Tams ascension as Thays supreme ruler. While the zulkir of necromancy soothed the anger of the Thayan people, he withdrew from the council, marshaled his undead army and attempted to take Thay by force.
The first battle occurred on on Mirtul 14, when the combined armies of the Council of Zulkirs assaulted the Keep of Thazar, Szass Tams fortress that had been supplied with undead from a manufactory hidden within the Sunrise Mountains. The council managed to win the battle,  destroying the nighthaunt Ysval who commanded Tams forces at the keep, and their Griffon Legion slowed the movement of the lichs remaining undead army in the following tenday. 
Szass tam appeared before a small conclave of Thayan officers on Mirtul 27 and ensured them their actions would result in a long, drawn-out war that would engulf their entire nation. In fact the two warring factions would battle throughout the next decade,
thumb|A map of Thay from the last months of the War of the Zulkirs.
By 1385 DR the warring factions of Thay arrived at a stalemate. Szass Tam held the northern tharchs of Gauros, Lapendrar, Surthay, Delhumide and Thaymount, while the other zulkirs maintained a hold over Priador, Eltabbar, Tyraturos, Thazalhar, Pyarados, and the islands of Alaor. In Ches, Hezass Nymar, the tharchion of Lapendrar warned the council that Szass Tam was planning an assault on the Keep of Sorrows.
On Tarsakh 29, the legions of northern Thay marched upon the Keep of Sorrows. While the council attempted to pincer Tams forces against the keeps walls, the atropal Xingax created an artificial darkness over the battlefield, summoned undead horrors and turned the time of the battle in Tams favor. Just before the lich could claim victory, the goddess of magic, Mystra was killed, and the blue flames of the Spellplague ravaged Thay and all of Toril. Arcane magic ceased to function properly and pure chaos broke out on the battlefield. Tams legions took the keep and the council forces withdrew to the isolated town of Zolum.
As a result of the Spellplague, the Thayan plateau rose thousands of feet in height and altered its place on the face of Toril. Rivers took new courses across the lands and the volcanoes of Thaymount erupted in violent explosions. These geological events began to reshape the previously-controlled Thayan landscape. Some cities were destroyed while others were unrecognizable. The icy glaciers of High Thay began to melt, which sent boulders and debris tumbling down the Second Escarpment down to the greater plateau. Volcanic ash filled the sky and the magically-protected climate of Thay was no more.
After a few more skirmishes fought in confusion, Szass Tam made a pact with the dark god Bane. In exchange for insight into the changed function and form of arcane magic, along with powers to rule over Thay for the next 1000 years, he offered forth his soul, and promised that divine worship in his kingdom would be solely dedicated to the Black Lord.
Tams greatest victory came at Thralgard Keep on Eleint 15. The lichs legions rebuked the attack of the councils legions, aided by the dream vestige summoned forth by the powers lent by the god Bane. The council fled south and briefly regrouped in Bezantur, before sailing off for Escalant in the Wizards Reach to the west. Szass Tam was greeted in Bezantur to cheers and adulation. He summoned a magical storm to slow the fleet of the Red Wizards, and sent his own forces after them. As the council ships gained the upper hand in the sea battle, Szass Tam withdrew his forces and allowed the Council of Zulkirs to leave Thay.
On the eve of his coronation as High Regent, Szass Tam gained great magical insight in the form of an ancient tome that described the Ritual of the unmaking. He begun construction on several Dread Rings, great fortresses that served as markers for the arcane power that coursed through all of Thay that, upon completion of the ritual, could potentially erase all of existence as it was known throughout the Realms.
While the lands, waters and skies of Thay had been ravaged by war and magic during the end of the 14 century, the following decades saw a great transformation among the nations people. The living people of Thay were increasingly disregarded as the Red Wizards fully embraced a new existence as vampires, liches and other servitors of undeath. Seats within the reformed Zulkir Council were filled by the most powerful of these undead arcanists.
On Midwinter 1478 DR, Bareris Anskuld uncovered a book from the former house of Druxus Rhym that illuminated the grand scheme that Szass Tam had been working on over the past 90 years. After reuniting with the leader of the Brotherhood of the Griffon, Aoth Fezim, Bareris brought his discovery to the remaining zulkirs of old Thay that lived in exile within the Wizards Reach.

Thay was divided into 11 tharchs, each ruled by a separate tharchion.
Alaor
This small but essential tharch, only encompassed the small, craggy island of the same name in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Despite its size, it housed Thays largest naval base and was vital to the nations navy.
 Delhumide
The tharch of Delhumide consisted of the lands immediately east and north of Lake Thaylambar atop the plateau. The regions namesake city, along with many other settlements, were largely destroyed in Thays war for independence from Mulhorand. 
 Eltabbar
One of the most important regions of Thay, this tharch was home to the magocratic nations capital of the same name. While it was previously unstable and rife with political uncertainty, by the late 14 century it had come under authoritative control. It was located on the northern half of the Thayan plateau, overlooked by the north-facing cliffs of Thaymount. 
*Eltabbar The former capital of Thay was a sprawling, densely-populated city over half of its inhabitants were slaves of the Thayan ruling-class.
Gauros
 This small region, located on the northeastern portion of the plateau east of the River Gauros, featured the mineral-rich Gorge of Gauros. It had been seen a great number of conflicts between the Thayans and Rashemi warriors.
Lapendrar
Extending beyond the Thayan plateau out to Escalant and the Sea of Fallen Stars, this region was bisected by the River Lapendrar. Following the Spellplague it was known as the "Contested Lands". 
* Amruthar While they maintained official independence from Thay, this free-city was governed by a puppet-ruler of Thay before it was destroyed and reformed by canals of molten lava during the Spellplague.
*Escalant The coastal city wavered between Untheric control, independence and Thayan control during the 14 century.
*Nethentir This "gateway city" guarded the path of entry into Thay that wound up the First Escarpment.
*Tilbrand While technically under the reign of Thay, Tilbrand was too far removed from the Thayan Plateau to be effectively governed, and its people maintained strong ties with Aglarond.
Priador
 This coastal area encompassed nearly all of Thays southern border, beyond the First Escarpment and was the most-recently established tharch in Thay.
* Bezantur While Eltabbar was the capital of Thay, the metropolis of Bezantur was considered the heart of the magocratic nation. It was a prosperous but foreboding port city where any vice or depravity could be indulged.
*Murbant The citizens of this coastal city lived of fishermen, smugglers and slave-masters of the vast, surrounding plantation-estates.
*Thasselen Largely destroyed during the Salamander War, Thasselen fell into disarray under the rule of Aznar Thrul in the decades that followed.
 Pyarados
Situated on the southeastern portion of Thay, west of the River Thazarim, this tharch was highly-valued for its access to the mineral-rich Sunrise Mountains east of the First Escarpment. 
*Pyarados The namesake city of the tharch was a lawless, frontier town of the east that served as a waypoint for those who sought to explore the Sunrise mountains and the eastern lands beyond its peaks.
Surthay
 Strong garrisons dotted this tharch, whose lands bordered the southern coast of Lake Mulsantir, in strong defiance to the northern lands of Rashemen. During the 14 century, Tharchion Homen Odesseiron would occasionally lead his considerable forces on raids into the lands of the Wychlaran.
*Surthay The northern-most Thayan city was a vital military stronghold for the nations continuous, contentions with the Rashemi to the north. 
Thaymount
Located directly in the center of Thay, this tharch had a rich history of military might, its forces serving as reserves for the outlying regions. The range of volcanic mountains, from which the region drew its name, loomed over the region and filled its skies with smoke and cinder.. 
*The Citadel This ancient, magical fortress was built before humans lived in Thay, and served as the seat of power for Regent Szass Tam during the 15 century. 
Thazalhar
This southeastern region of Thay housed the trade routes that linked Thay and the frontier of Mulhorand,
*Thazar Keep This stronghold was taken over by the undead forces of Szass Tam in 1375 DR.
*Thazrumaros 
Tyratauros
A vast province in the southern end of the plateau, Tyraturos had a number of vital trade routes running through its borders, including the Eastern Way and the High Road.
*Tyraturos This filthy, but vital trade city was located at the crossroads of Thays two main trade routes.
*Solzepar
Thays weather was magically manipulated by the Red Wizards. But in its natural state, snow was a common sight on the Thayan lands of high elevation, such as the Thaymount and the Sunset Mountains, while in the High Thay plateau, snow was rare. It received occasional hoar frosts and sleet storms. As a whole, Thays temperature extremes between daylight and night caused regular ground fogs that were more common than other forms of precipitation. When snow or rain did happen, they were brief, sometimes powerful downpours that moved across Thay speedily, with the moving storm front seen from afar.
Under Red Wizards control, Thay received steady nighttime rains to boost the nations agriculture and hinder roaming monstrous marauders, bandits, and rebels.
Notably, several species of fey creatures had been hunted to the brink of extinction in Thay due to the spell-fortifying properties of fairy dust.
Few invasions ever overcame the great mountains girding the Plateau of Thay, and the secretive and suspicious Red Wizards raised barriers just as formidable to discourage travelers from venturing into their lands. Despite its seclusion and rather paranoid inhabitants, Thay was a largely fertile region, full of farms and orchards that received ample water from a number of flowing rivers and a deep lake rich with aquatic life. 
During the Spellplague however, the plateau of Thay rose thousands of feet above Toril, melting its glaciers and causing great volcanic eruptions within Thaymount. Over the following century, it became a dark and foreboding land of lifeless badlands, windswept mountains and barren deserts. By the 15 century, the skies over Thay were plagued with ash and smoke that spewed skyward from the volcanic peaks of Thaymount.
Regions 
*Plateau of Thay This formerly lush and verdant oasis held most of Thays population. While it previously held grand slave plantations, cities and fortresses, it transformed into an expanse of arid badlands during the 15 century.
*First Escarpment Offering a nigh-surmountable natural barrier, this sheer cliffside elevated the plateau above the surrounding badlands. Its walls ranged anywhere from 50 (15.2 m) to over 200 (61 m) in height, but rose thousands of feet during the Spellplague.
* Second Escarpment Similar to the outer escarpment, this inner cliffside elevated the mountains of Thaymount above the surrounding region. Within its walls were a number of gold mines and hidden garrisons, granting the Red Wizards tight control over who traveled in and out of the volcanic peaks.
Mountains
* Thaymount These rugged, volcanic mountains were located at the center of Thay, atop the Second Escarpment atop its innermost plateau. A "dampening field" over the mountain range, established some time in the late 13 century, prevented magical scrying or divination spells from granting insight over the area to anyone who attempted to spy upon the tightly-controlled region of the Red Wizards domain.
*Sunrise Mountains Forming the eastern border of Thay, these mountains were rough, hard-traveled peaks that were rich with minerals, including copper.
Bodies of Water
*Alamber Sea The neutral waters south of Thay encompassed the primary trade routes between Thay, Mulhorand, Unther and Tymanther.
* Lake Thaylambar The deep waters of this vast icy lake were rich with sea life, including great schools of fish and even seldom-seen dragon turtles. It was located in central Thay and fed the rivers Thay and Thazarim.
Rivers
*River Gauros Flowing north from the Sunrise Mountains, past the ruins of Delhumide, this river was surrounded by barren lands that had little life or vegetation.
*River Lapendrar Thays second-longest river was an important trade route for the southern tharchs. It flowed from Thaymount, southwest past the escarpments before pouring into the Alamber Sea near the city of Escalant.
*River Thay Spanning the northeastern portion of the Thayan plateau, this vast river was vital to the nations economy, particularly the northern tharchs.
*River of the Dawn This river on the southern end of Thazalhar, marked the border between Thay and Mulhorand.
*River Umber Rather unimportant in comparison to the Realms other waterways, this river flowed east from Thaymount, granting the Thayans a means to convey goods and forces in their conflicts with nearby Aglarond. 
*River Sur This shorter river was rather narrow and fast at the First Escarpment but widened and slowed down before opening into Lake Mulsantir west of the Surmarsh. It formed Thays northern border with the nation of Thesk.
*River Thazarim Located on the eastern side of Thay, between Pyarados and the Sunrise Mountains, this southern-flowing river featured a number of magnificent waterfalls before pouring into the Alamber Sea.
Swamps
*Surmarsh This bleak and putrid swamp was was a select hunting ground for those Thayan nobles who sought to hunt down horrid creatures. Its feverish waters were plagued by tribes of lizardfolk, abhorrent ropers, otyughs and slithermorphs, the rare undead known as skuz and even black dragons.
*Burning Braziers A group of militant Kossuthan priests that maintained a chapterhouse in the Flaming Brazier in Eltabbar.
*Black Flame Zealots An order of Kossuthan assassins.
*Brothers and Sisters of the Pure Flame
*Order of the Salamander
*Thayan gladiator
