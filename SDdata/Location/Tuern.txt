'''Tuern''' ({{Pronounce|TOORN|refs=}}) was an island in the [[Frozenfar]] in the [[Trackless Sea]], far to the west of [[Faer√ªn]]. It was a rocky island of black beaches and fuming volcanoes, but was very fertile.

==Climate==
Although classed as a subarctic climate, Tuern was somewhat warmed by the coastal current.

==People & Culture==
Tuern was inhabited largely by [[Northmen]]. The people of the island were known as "Tuernish". Though they worshiped no gods (and often denied their existence), they held great reverence for the [[red dragon]]s that dwelt in the mountains. Their longships were big enough to house giants (and frequently did), and were decorated with figureheads depicting fierce warriors. A typical Tuernish crew consisted of over a hundred warriors. The Tuernish despised magic, and its usage was punishable by death. Clerics were treated with disdain, and even Northman shamans found little respect among the Tuernish. Other non-Northmen and non-humans only received respect if their skill in battle was obvious. 

The volcanic conditions also made Tuern an ideal home for both [[fire giant]]s and red dragons. Though the fire giants had their own enormous longships, they rarely raided further than [[Gundarlun]].

Tuern's largest settlement was [[Uttersea]], a town built into the side of a collapsed volcanic caldera; the caldera's walls shielded the town from all but the harshest weather. Heat from below the caldera warmed both the town and the bay, sometimes to the point of boiling. As a result, it was home to creatures such as [[giant octopus]]es that would otherwise not survive so far north.

==Economics==
Though conditions on Tuern were harsher than the other islands in the Frozenfar, the Tuernish were wealthier by far than other Northmen; the volcanic activity produced both enormous diamonds and pure [[adamantite]] ore.

==Government==
Tuern was ruled by five Northmen kings, who recognized the High King of Uttersea as their liege.

==Militia==
Each king commanded a small handful of longships, each crewed by 50 warriors and archers. 

==History==
Tuern was colonized by [[Northmen]] sailing from the coast of the mainland. 

[[Illuskan]]s from Gundarlun and Tuern later invaded the [[Moonshae Isles]]. In the {{YearlinkName|256}}, the [[Ffolk]] surrendered the northern isles to the invaders.<ref>

In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Tuern's dragon-worshiping inhabitants welcomed the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to the island. Adventurers seeking to thwart the Cult slew one of Tuern's three red dragon overlords, which led the remaining two to go on a rampage and set fire to much of the island.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 2}}{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 3}}

==Notable Locations==
Notable locations on the island included:
* [[Flame Fault]], a deep crevasse in the western mountains, home to the trio of red dragons that ruled the isle. 
* [[Lair of Lostmauth]], the personal domain of [[Lostmauth]], one of Tuern's three draconic rulers.
* [[Throne Rock]], fortress of High Artificer [[Fizmorayen Fitzmoran]], exiled cleric of Gond.
