            "Ancient history": "Torzac was, at first, a typical peasant village. However, a [[dark elf]] raid force soon had their eyes on it. From the edges of the wood, a hooded figure moved towards the village square. The drow made his way upon a small structure and held out a gleaming scepter, known as ''[[starfire]]''.\n\nIn [[Common]], the drow announced that from here on, he would be their new ruler. Many of the citizens scoffed or walked away, but a few curious locals were intrigued, with one asking to show himself. The drow pulled down his hood, revealing his true nature. The dark elf told the villagers that he would accept no resistance, but that didn't stop the [[mage]] of the village. With an angry shout, she let loose missiles of [[magic]]al energy at the would-be ruler of Torzac.\n\n{{fq\n|text=Dark warrior, you will never rule a living soul in my home village!\n|source=Unknown mage of Torzac\n}}\n\nThe drow knew what was coming.
