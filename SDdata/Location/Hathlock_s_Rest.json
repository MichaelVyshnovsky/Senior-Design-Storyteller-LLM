The Bowshot road ran north of the Trollhead Bridge and eventually rose up and away from the swamps and to the site of Hathlocks Rest. The settlements only amenity was the Hathlock House, a rustic inn that offered humble lodgings and plain food.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Hathlocks Rest was abandoned, and the only sign of life in the area that it had once been a settlement was the Hathlock House inn that catered to travelers across the Bowshot. Apart from guests, the inn served as home to seven hunters and furriers."
