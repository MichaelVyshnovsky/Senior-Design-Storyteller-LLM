Malduir was a city located in Dambrath.
Reinhar IX and his attempted expansion of Dambrath was repelled by drow forces during a brutal war that lasted three decades. Reinhars forces were eventually trapped at Malduir. A group of half-elven priestesses of Loviatar appeared to come to the aid of Reinhar, but betrayed him to the drow, resulting in the death of Reinhar and the defeat of the arkaiun.
