The Thornwood, or Thorn Wood, was a forest by the Lake of Steam.
This forest was situated north of the city of Ankhapur, south of the Cloven Mountains,
The River Mintar flowed through it from Erlkazar, to the Lake of Steam, and out to the Shining Sea.
Several species of dangerous flora grew within this forest, including the thornslinger for which it was named, choke creepers, retch plants, and a small number of yellow musk creepers. Several intelligent species of plant life also grew within the forest, including hangman trees, obliviaxes, strangle weeds, and the occasional shambling mound.
The Thornwood was once part of the elven nation of Thearnytaar, which fell to the dark elves at the end of the Second Crown War.
As of 1372 DR, it was inhabited by evil humanoids and at least one beholder.
By 1369 DR, the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the forest to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.
* Lair of Vaxall Said to be hidden in the deepest and most dangerous part of the wood, this beholder lair was thought to belong to Vaxall of the Dying Gaze.
* There was a legend that every ten years, in a particular grove in the forest, the Greens Sword would sprout and could be claimed by anyone using it to fight evil.
* Rumors of ancient repositories of elven magic and treasure from the time of Thearnytar never died down, though whether they were left by moon elves or dark elves was debated.
