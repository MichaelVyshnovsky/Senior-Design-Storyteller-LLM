The '''Thornwood''', or '''Thorn Wood''', was a forest by the [[Lake of Steam]].

==Geography==
This forest was situated north of the city of [[Ankhapur]], south of the [[Cloven Mountains]],

The [[River Mintar]] flowed through it from [[Erlkazar]], to the Lake of Steam, and out to the [[Shining Sea]].<ref>

===Flora & Fauna===
Several species of dangerous flora grew within this forest, including the [[thornslinger]] for which it was named, [[choke creeper]]s, [[retch plant]]s, and a small number of [[yellow musk creeper]]s. Several intelligent species of plant life also grew within the forest, including [[hangman tree]]s, [[obliviax]]es, [[strangle weed]]s, and the occasional [[shambling mound]].

==History==
The Thornwood was once part of the [[elven]] nation of [[Thearnytaar]], which fell to the [[dark elves]] at the end of the [[Crown Wars#Second Crown War|Second Crown War]].

As of [[1372 DR]], it was inhabited by evil [[humanoid]]s and at least one [[beholder]].

By [[1369 DR]], the [[Twisted Rune]] had placed a magical gate in the forest to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Lair of Vaxall]]: Said to be hidden in the deepest and most dangerous part of the wood, this [[beholder]] lair was thought to belong to [[Vaxall|Vaxall of the Dying Gaze]].

==Rumors and Legends==
* There was a legend that every ten years, in a particular grove in the forest, the [[Green's Sword]] would sprout and could be claimed by anyone using it to fight evil.
* Rumors of ancient repositories of elven magic and treasure from the time of Thearnytar never died down, though whether they were left by [[moon elves]] or [[dark elves]] was debated.
