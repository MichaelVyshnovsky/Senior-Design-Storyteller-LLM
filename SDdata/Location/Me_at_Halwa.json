        "Overview": "The Me'at Halwa was formed by the waters from five surrounding small hills. Much of the city of [[Medinat Muskawoon]] was built on them, and around the lake. The lake emptied into the river [[Athis]], to flow northwestward and eventually reach the sea.",
        "History": "The city of Medinat Muskawoon was built around the Me'at Halwa. After the Curse of Amun-Re took effect, the level of the underground waters, themselves fed by the River Athis, fell enough that the outflow from the surrounding hills was not enough to keep the water in place. Thus, the lake dried, even though it was not fed by the river Athis.\n\nAs of {{yearlink|1356}}, the Me'at Halwa was a part of the Skysea, created after the battle between Martek and Khalitharius.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|95}} The lake's dry bed, and part of its banks leading towards the Athis,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation/Map}} were covered in a layer of glass with an average thickness of {{SI|10|feet}}.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|97}}"
