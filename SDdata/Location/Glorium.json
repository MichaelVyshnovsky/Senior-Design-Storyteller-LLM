        "mainbody": "'''Glorium''' was a small [[gate-town]] leading to [[Ysgard]] from the [[Outlands]].\n\n{{Quote|''What is life, but struggle? What is struggle, but conflict? What is conflict, but battle? What is Glorium, but all of the above?''|Flatnose Grim}}",
        "Description": "This small gate-town consisted a number of longhouses, shipsheds, smokehouses, workshops,{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} The harbor was reached by descending a steep staircase and notably had a complex winch to raise and lower cargo from ships.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|9}}\n\nGlorium didn't bother with stockades or walls, feeling that nature provided them with sufficient defense; all they had was a wooden tower. The town was also lacking in any places to accommodate travelers, such as inns and taverns. Though Glorium's meeting hall, which everyone gathered to at the end of a day, served the role of a tavern.\n\nAt the edge of Glorium stood a small temple dedicated to the [[Norse pantheon]] but primarily to [[Odin]] and the [[Norns]]. The pantheon's other members were only acknowledged in an offhand way.\n\nLike all gate-towns, Glorium was strongly influenced by the nature of the plane to which it was linked, Ysgard. It exhibited enough distinctions to prevent it from being pulled into that Outer Plane, but its inhabitants recognized that they were increasingly picking up Ysgardian habits, though they were unconcerned about this fact.",
        "Geography": {
            "Gates": "There were two ''[[gate]]s'' near Glorium&mdash;uncommon for most gate-towns, which usually had one&mdash;with both exiting into the plane of Ysgard. The best known of the two was a [[watergate|big swirling maelstrom]], situated near the mouth of the fjord a {{SI|1|mile}} offshore, and was big enough for ships to sail through. Twice a day, the Watergate reversed itself, allowing people to come through from Ysgard.\n\nThe second ''gate'' near Glorium was at the end of the sole road leading out from the town. By following the trail one would come to a cavern, wherein resided one of the plane-spanning roots of [[Yggdrasil]]. However, there was a number of side passages within the cavern, running deep below the surface of the Outlands, some to quite unpleasant places, like the [[Caverns of Thought]] or [[Gzemnid's Realm]]."
        },
        "Defense": "Glorium had a milita of freemen known as the ''hird'', of which every resident was a member. They would quickly assemble upon the sounding of a war-horn, with one member remaining behind in the town's wooden tower to watch for incoming ships. The only time they were summoned in full was on the rare ocassions when they were being raided by the [[petitioner]]s of [[Gzemnid]] or [[Ilsensine]].",
        "Trade": "The people of Glorium made their living off of fishing, hunting, and some degree of farming. They also conducted trade with the petitioners of the Dwarven Mountain, though not to a great degree, because of the treacherous nature of the road leading out to it. Their main exports were [[herbs]], ore, and wood.",
        "History": "At some point, a group of [[adventurer]]s from the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] came to the city of [[Sigil]], having purchased a [[map]] from a sage in [[Shadowdale]]. When the group's [[fighter]] unfolded the map they began scanning it in search of Glorium, only to quickly be corrected by his [[rogue]] ally that they were actually looking for the gate-town to [[Bytopia]].\n\nLater when the [[Great Modron March#History|Rogue March]] passed through Glorium, the town's inhabitants left the [[modron]]s to pass by peacefully as they marched their way to the ''portal'' to Ysgard as they had reasoned that, since the modrons weren't interested in fighting back, there wasn't any glory in fighting them.<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a mercantile caravan from the Torilian city of [[Ravens Bluff]] that was sponsored by local Ravenian noble [[Lauren DeVillars]] traveled to Glorium by means of a [[color pool]]. Accompanying the caravan was a group of Ravenian [[adventurer]]s who were on a quest to find the legendary [[Well of Mimir]], having been instructed by the city's [[Ministry of Art]] to do so in order to learn how a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]'' could be destroyed.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2,5-6}}\n\nWhile there the adventurers were first greeted by a githyanki named [[Ilkaren Tysor]], who dressed in the local attire and was at the time busy earning a meal by raising a longhouse. He met them later at Glorium's meeting hall, where he revealed himself to be a member of the [[Bleak Cabal]]{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|13}}",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* Bkol Steelbane, an [[orc]] sailor who operated the enchanted [[sentient item|sentient]] [[longship]] ''[[Courier (ship)|Courier]]'' and offered voyage across the Watergate for a price of a hundred gold pieces.\n* Flatnose Grim, the chieftain of Glorium and a human [[ranger]]. He was a short, bear-chested warrior who was equally renowned for his capriciousness as his strength. He often took great sport in showing the latter off by wrestling guests, bending [[horseshoe]]s, and staging contests in which one threw {{SIAdj|50|lbs.|k|long=yes}} boulders.\n* The Freki twins, a pair of ship-builders known for making very refined [[longship]]s.\n* [[Hildegrid]], a woman known for her delightful homebrew alcohol.\n* Kostbera, the nagging wife of Flatnose Grim.\n* Thumur, a blacksmith who made relatively affordable weapons. Some claimed he enchanted his wares, but the smith himself denied this.\n* [[Tyrza Bonebreaker]], Cheiftain of Glorium in the late 15{{th}} century DR."
        },
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Glorium meeting hall|Meeting hall]], the closest thing the town had to a tavern.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to rumors, the deity Gzemnid sought to annex this town and its ''gates''. In relation to this rumor, some claimed that creatures in service to Gzemnid haunted the mountains, having reported seeing strange creatures within the cavern. Some had also reported seeing carved markings in the cavern that could be secret signs of Gzemnid's priests."
