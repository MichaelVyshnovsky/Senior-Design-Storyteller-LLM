'''Mirkazar''' was a protectorate of the Kingdom of [[Tethyr]] that contained most of the [[Forest of Mir]].

==Geography==
The '''Mir Protectorate''' was located in the [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|Duchy]] of [[Suretmarch]], south of counties [[Alonmarch]] and [[Surkazar]]. It was the only region of Tethyr where humans were in control of large forests&mdash;at least in name.

==Government==
The [[druid]] [[Yuldar Llistiin]] was lord protector and count of Mirkazar, both before and after the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum]]. He lived in [[Mistletoe Keep.]]

During the Interregnum, however, the Mir Protectorate was ruled by [[Thenas Haddarm]], former mayor of [[Kzelter]], who captured Mistletoe Keep (then called Yuldar's Keep), soon after the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]]. After Queen [[Zaranda Star|Zaranada]] came to power, he was beheaded, and control of Mirkazar was returned to Yuldar.

==History==
Since the time of [[Strohm II]], this region had historically been a military holding, for the greater defense of Tethyr. The soldiers there kept the monsters and dangers of the Forest and the [[Marching Mountains]] at bay. With the fall of Kzelter in 1370 DR, this put a strain on the number of troops able to keep watch on the woods.

==Notable Locations==
The two fortified towns of [[Ithal Pass]] and Kzelter were located here, on the northeastern side of the Forest of Mir.
