        "Description": "Despite its hot and humid climate, Verdant farms surrounded the Golden Water, the shoreline of which was given to the mansions of the luxury-loving ruling merchant elite of the kingdom.{{fact}}",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "[[File:Golden-Water-Vince-Locke.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The shimmering bay known as the Golden Water]]\nMountainous regions of Durpar were notable sources of the animate [[plangent crystal]]s used to make [[prosthetic]] limbs."

            "Culture": "[[File:Plangent.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A citizen of Durpar with a [[prosthetic]] arm form from [[plangent]].]]\nWhile public displays of wealth was a common tradition among the Durpari people, exhibiting riches that were not truly theirs was unacceptable, as was hiding away that which rightfully were.\n\nDurpari fashion, such as their [[coral]] jewelry and style of decorative [[fillet (clothing)|fillet]], could be found in civilized realms beyond the kingdom's borders. It was made available to people of the [[Heartlands]] by means of the [[Aurora's Emporium]] retail company and their [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue|expansive catalogue]].\n\nLiteracy and multilingualism was considered very important among the Durpari people. Most merchants of Durpar could converse in [[common]], [[Thorass]], [[Akalan]], [[Midani language|Midani]], [[Dwarvish]], [[Halfling language|halfling]] and several others.",
            "Cuisine": "A type of [[nut]]-based dessert known as [[taunth]] was popular in Durpar and was consumed in [[Ulgarth]], the [[Utter East]], and [[Murghôm]], where it was known under the same name but had minor recipe variations. Durpar used hard [[honeycomb]]s to make taunth treats.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210730214335/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1421224959465119745| title = TheEdVerse on Twitter| accessdate = 30-6-2022| date = 30-7-2021}}",
            "Religion": "The Adama taught that all deities of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] and beyond were all parts of the same singular entity. Oghma, the god of knowledge and inspiration became [[Curna]], and Selûne, the goddess of the moon became [[Lucha]].\n\nBecause of this dynamic, Durpar's citizens were taught not to hate foreign religions and it enjoyed the label as being one of the most tolerant lands in all the Realms."
        },
        "Government": "While the nation of Durpar remained a \"merchant kingdom\", terminology dating back to its old history, It was composed of the heads of the eleven wealthiest mercantile houses or [[chaka]]s. The [[Grand Nawab]] served as the head of this council, an individual that was included among the wealthiest people in all [[Faerûn]].\n\nWhile a chaka had to accumulate a great amount of wealth to earn a seat on the council, it was thought to be impossible without maintaining good and honest business practices, as laid out by the code of the Adama. The Nawab Council itself conducted their affairs with strict adherence to the Adama, and while they may have schemed and acted against their own rivals, service of the public good always took precedence over individual financial interests. \n\nIndividual communities each had their own eleven-seat council, upon which sat the heads of local, less-influential chakas.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century, rulership of Durpar was taken over by the powerful [[Datharathi]] chaka, which had emerged triumphant over the others after years of conflict.",
        "Trade": {
            "Currency": "Durpar minted its own variety of [[trade bar]], known as the [[Durpar Vellim]]."
        },
        "Defenses": "For much of its history, Durpar eschewed a regular standing army and opted to entrust their security to a number of privately-hired mercenary companies.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century, the remaining cities of Durpar were defended by the [[goblinoid]] army commanded by the dominant Datharathi chaka.",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "During the [[Age of the Proud Peoples]], approximately 6000 years before the [[1 DR|erection of the]] [[Standing Stone]], the lands of Durpar were considered a mere territory of the ancient [[Imaskar]]i empire. When the empire fell in the {{YearlinkName|-2488}}, the people of the Durpari subject-state fell to chaos and savagery, a state that would continue for millennia. Eventually, nearly all of the Durpari [[barbarian]]s were slaughtered by the invading [[Mulhorand]]i empire.\n\nFortunately the remaining Durpari, the lands across the Golden Coast were united as the singular Kingdom of Durpar in the {{YearlinkName|-623}}, under the leadership of Maharajah [[Udandwi]]. and opened up trade with Mulhorand to the north.\nAs the philosophical teachings of [[Satama]] became widespread across Durpar and the southern realm of [[Var]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|-256}},{{fact}} a collective shift took over the region, and it came to be known as the \"Lands of the One\".\n\nAs a sign of what would plague the region for many centuries to follow, growing hordes of monsters overwhelmed the coastal cities of Veldorn throughout the 2{{nd}} and 3{{rd}} centuries DR.",
            "Years of Prosperity": "When the heirless Maharajah [[Waileen V]] died in the {{YearlinkName|428}}, the nation's first high council was established to steward the kingdom until one could be named. After decades of conflict between numerous chakas vying for power and control, the High Council was officially named the governing body for the mercantile monarchy.\n\nThe nation was briefly invaded by [[Dambrath]] in the {{YearlinkName|553}}.\n\nIn what has been celebrated as one of the greatest feats of commerce in the nation's history, the exalted [[Jeradeem Seltarir]] successfully negotiated the acquisition of the royal throne of Estagund in the {{YearlinkName|1026}}, for a price of 24 [[gem]]s, approximating 1,000,000 [[gp]] in value.{{fact}} The celebrated union of the two nations led to new military victories against the monstrous occupying armies to the south, taking back the cities of [[Vaelantar]] and [[Assur]] from a collective of [[beholder]]s, and seizing [[Ormpé]] from the clutches of [[demon]]s in the first years of the 12{{th}} century. \n\nDespite these successes, Durpari forces remained unable to wrest control of much of Veldorn to the northwest, leaving closed the trade routes leading to Mulhorand. A second failed attempt was made in the late 13{{th}} century DR, but it too failed after a mere three–days trek into Veldorn. Following this defeat, the leaders of Durpar swore to never again force their armies to march upon the bestial creatures and horrific monstrosities of Veldorn, the country that came to be known as the Beastlands.",
            "Great Decline": "The 15{{th}} century saw a stark turn in the fortunes and fate of the Durpari kingdom. Some time following the [[Spellplague]], the monstrous of the Beastlands, as Veldorn had come to be known as, march south upon the Shining Lands. Many of Durpar's cities were ravaged by the assault, and lay in ruin as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.\n\nTo help stem the destruction and chaos, the influential Datharathi chaka banded together with several lesser merchant houses and allied themselves with the [[Iron Eye]] [[goblins]] from the Curna Mountains. When some of the Durpari chakas broke with their treaty, the [[Merchant Wars]] broke out throughout the nation, with the Datharathi emerging victorious. By that time, only the city of [[Vaelan]] remained as the only thriving city in Durpar, and the kingdom as a whole remained in a precarious state of existence."
        },
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Ruins": "* [[Old Vaelan]], all that remained of the former city to hold the name \"Vaelan\" was an underground dungeon complex that served as the lair of the [[vampire]] lord [[Saed]].",
            "Settlements": "* [[Assur]], a thriving seaside town{{fact}} that was leveled by [[giant]]s and rebuilt as a naval outpost.\n* [[Flyndagol]], the militarized city that stood on the border of the Raurin desert.\n* [[Heldapan]], the kingdom's capital city leading up to the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Lastarr]], formerly part of Estagund, this independent city was not considered part of the Durpari kingdom despite being within its borders.\n* [[Morvar]], a culturally diverse city that housed great populations of the nation's [[demihuman]] races.\n* [[Orpher]], the coastal settlement whose chaka originated as an adventuring company rather than Durpari family.\n* [[Vaelan]], Durpar's newest capital built on the western shore of the Golden Water remained the center of center of Durpari civilization during its darkest days.\n* [[Turelve]], the city that facilitated north-bound exports and served as a bulwark against the monsters of the Beastlands."

        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the large population of ethnic [[Durpari]], the nation was home to many [[halfling]]s, notable groups of city-dwelling [[half-elves]], along with [[gnome]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[Kenku]]."
