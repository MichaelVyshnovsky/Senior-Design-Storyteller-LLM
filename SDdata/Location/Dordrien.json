        "mainbody": "Dordrien was a ruined settlement in the western Dagger Hills in Daggerdale. It was founded by a Jhaamdathan noble whom the settlement was named after.\nAfter the destruction of Jhaamdath in the , Dordrien led the survivors of Jhaamdath north from the Twelve Cities of the Sword in the . In the area later known as Daggerdale, the Dordrien Lords raised a sizable keep on the western slope of the Dagger Hills, which guarded a large and prosperous town nearby. Flourishing for a century or so the realm was weakened by continual orc raids and the decline of its ruling family. Eventually most of its folk drifted back to the more populated lands around the Sea of Fallen Stars. By  the town was abandoned.\nFew traces remained by the 14 century DR to indicate any settlement existed prior to the Dalesfolk. However, the crumbling foundations of Dordrien Keep lay on a barren hilltop, and the crypts of the Dordrien family could be found  north of the ruins.\nThese crypts were built into the limestone caverns beneath the Dagger Hills, leading to three elaborate vaults carved from the rock. Two impressive stone mausoleums stood for many years outside. A handful of other mausoleums did not fare so well over many years homesteaders hauled off most of the fallen stones. The natural caverns here led to the drow outpost of Szith Morcane in the upperdark. Drow refugees from the destroyed city of Maerimydra, circa 1372 DR, had been using these crypts as a staging ground for raids on the surface. These raids were ended by adventurers enlisted by Randal Morn.\nThe crypts were home to numerous undead Jhaamdathan nobles, plus a nest of bebiliths summoned by the drow wizard Solom Nedrazak, Archmage of Szith Morcane."
