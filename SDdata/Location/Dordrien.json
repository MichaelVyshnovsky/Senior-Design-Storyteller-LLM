However, the crumbling foundations of Dordrien Keep lay on a barren hilltop, and the crypts of the Dordrien family could be found  north of the ruins.\nThese crypts were built into the limestone caverns beneath the Dagger Hills, leading to three elaborate vaults carved from the rock. Two impressive stone mausoleums stood for many years outside. A handful of other mausoleums did not fare so well over many years homesteaders hauled off most of the fallen stones. The natural caverns here led to the drow outpost of Szith Morcane in the upperdark.
