        "mainbody": "attlerise was a hamlet in southeastern Cormyr on the Way of the Manticore, situated west of the Darkflow River and south of the Vast Swamp close to Sembia.\nBesides a small population of turnip farmers, the Margar family owned a waystable that was fortified with its own palisade. There the family traded fresh horses to travelers in exchange for their road-weary ones, or sold them outright. \nVarious nobles attempted throughout the years to rebuild the castle on the hill in order to use it as a base for trade with neighboring Sembia. However, their efforts were defeated by the presence of the Cult of the Dragon, who had already been using the vaults below the castle as a headquarters for their own sorcerous, clandestine operations. Unbeknownst to the Margars, the Cult also had an agent installed as one of the hired hands working for the family.\nBattlerise was named for the nearby hill topped with the ruins of Battlegate Castle, once the seat of the extinct Auantiver noble family. The hamlet itself was once a larger village, but its population was greatly reduced after it was attacked by monsters raiding out of the Vast Swamp such as lizardfolk."
