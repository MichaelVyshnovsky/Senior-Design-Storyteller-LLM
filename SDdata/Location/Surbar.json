        "mainbody": "urbar was a coastal city of Ulgarth in southeast Faer√ªn.\nSurbar was sheltered safely within the bay of the Golden Water. It stood on the coast, southwest of the Galuil Mountains.The source says \"southeast of the Galuil Mountains\", but this must be in error. On the maps, Surbar is depicted to the southwest of the nearby mountains. Sunrise in springtime made the Mountains of Gold a beautiful sight.\nAround 1367 DR, Surbar and its environs were governed by Baron Kasnchil. He was corrupt and greedy, yet the serfs thought he made the city prosper.\nSurbar received most of the gold and iron mined from the mountains. Metalworking, weapon-smithing, shipping, and spices were Surbars primary industries. Baron Kasnchils policy of accepting all kinds of trade through Surbar made it a popular port and a prosperous city, but this knew no limits even Dambrathan pirates could dock there to resupply and refit.\nSurbar was home to nearly 15,000 people, making it the second-largest city in Ulgarth. More than anywhere else in the kingdom, demihumans were common here, thanks to the dwarven mining trade from the mountains."
