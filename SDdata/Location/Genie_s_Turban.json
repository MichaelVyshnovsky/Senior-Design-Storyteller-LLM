Blocked from view by the sea, the arid interior of this island was surrounded by lush, beautiful vegetation. This islands' villages were located near the coast or along the eastern area of forested elevation called the Comb."

        "Inhabitants": "The area of the Genie's Turban was entirely peopled with corsairs. Naturally suspicious, they would often test newcomers to see if they were confused by the use of the term for the Beauty Marks islets."
