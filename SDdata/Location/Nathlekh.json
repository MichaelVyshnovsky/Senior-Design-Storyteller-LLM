        "mainbody": "'''Nathlekh''', called the '''City of Cats''', was a city on the [[Dragon Coast]] and the capital of the [[Shou]] nation of [[Nathlan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "Located at the western edge of the [[Gulthmere Forest]] on the shores of the [[Lake of the Long Arm]], Nathlekh was built around a [[granite]] plug, atop which the [[Pride of Nobanion (building)|Pride of Nobanion]] stood, seemingly as an extension of the rock.",
        "History": "It was originally populated by feline [[lycanthrope]]s worshiping [[Nobanion]] and [[Sharess]]. It had a significant population of mundane [[cat]]s (including [[lion]]s) and its mysterious rulers were known as the Cat Lords. All of these factors certainly earned it its moniker.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1386}}, the [[Spellplague]] caused the ground underneath the Shou ward of the city to rise several hundred feet higher then the rest of the city. This destroyed much of the non-Shou parts of the city.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1394}}, the city outlawed refugees and [[fey]] from entering the city.\n\nSettled by more and more immigrants from [[Kara-Tur]] over the centuries, by [[1479 DR]], the city had become populated almost entirely by Shou and the small nation of Nathlan had grown up around it. The citizens of Nathlekh were suspicious of outsiders. They forbade anyone not of Shou descent (especially non-[[human]]s) from taking up residence in the city and restricted visitors to a single, special section of the city. By this time, the city had largely ceased to be called the \"City of Cats\".",
        "Law & Order": "Under the Cat Lords in the 1300s DR, a trio of [[lammasu]] judges passed judgement once a week on lawbreakers.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Foreign Quarter": "; The Bear Pit\n: A western-style warehouse that hid an underground gambling den and fighting arena where bets were placed on captured [[dog]]s and other animals. The [[White Petal tong]], who ran the establishment, occasionally had people who crossed them fight the animals. The building backed onto a confusing maze of alleyways.{{Cite organized play/LFR/White Flower Falling}}\n\n; Chiang Emporium\n: The main base of a Shou trading coster that operated along the [[Dragon Coast]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It was owned and operated by the [[Chiang Clan]], a powerful family that seemed to consist entirely of women.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Night of Fallen Petals}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Crafts}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Discomfort}}\n\n; Flying Tiger Inn\n: On the outside, this inn appeared to have been built in the western style but inside, it was decorated exclusively in Shou style. It was owned and operated by Master [[Woo]], a small bald man with a very long white mustache.\n\n; Four Winds tea house\n: A traditional Shou [[tea house]] owned by the influential [[Neng Clan]]. Propriety was important here and those who offended Shou social norms were asked to leave.\n\n; Ho Fan Dye Works\n: This old factory on East Street, located at the edge of the industrial area in the Foreign Quarter, was an old building that acted as the White Petal tong's headquarters. The tong's elderly Grandmaster [[Tsui Shoku]] lived here, well-protected by guards, traps and other defenses.\n\n; House of Flowers\n: The local temple of [[Kelemvor]]. Although not a Shou god, this temple was where the annual [[Night of Fallen Petals]] occurred in the city.\n\n; Ironhand's Forge\n: A high-quality smithy run by the [[shield dwarf]] [[Elmund Ironhand]], who opened his business in [[1469 DR]] and enjoyed the company of the Shou despite their haughtiness and pride.\n\n; Lo-Yun's butcher's shop\n: This otherwise average-looking and smelly butcher's shop stood atop a soundproofed dojo operated by the White Petal tong. Lo-Yun's pigs were quite accustomed to being fed human meat.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Falling Snow, White Petal}}\n\n; Mak Won Emporium\n: Next door to the Flying Tiger, this shop sold everything an alchemist could ever need. The owner was an elderly Shou man named [[Yu Mak Won]].\n\n; Mensyn's Wares\n: A cobbler's and leatherworking shop owned by the eccentric and incredibly rich [[halfling]] [[Jonster Yate]], one of the Seven Burghers of [[New Velar]].\n\n; Snow Blossom gambling house\n: A traditional Shou building laquered in red, green, and gold with a sleeping stone dragon reclining on the roof. This popular gambling den was operated by [[Tak Mei]] as a front for the White Petal tong but its games were rigged and run by expert cheats and con men. The criminals used debts accrued by the patrons to blackmail them.\n\n; Temple of Tymora\n: A beautiful building run by a priest named [[Markle]]. Brother Berak (originally from [[Westgate]]) and a Shou man known as Brother [[Mu]], helped Markle.\n\n; [[Yi Amahl]]'s shop\n: A prophet from [[Almraiven]] sold [[coffee]] and [[Calishite]] trinkets here with his apprentice [[Petec]]."
