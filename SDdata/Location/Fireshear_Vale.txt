The '''Fireshear Vale''' was a great crevasse that opened up the icy tundra of the [[Cold Run]]. It comprised a long fissure that opened up into a massive crater.

The landmark lent its name to the [[Fireshear|port town]] that formed at its western edge.

==Geographical Features==
The sides of the vale were marred and blackened, as if they were scorched by flame. Within its depths were veins of [[copper]] and [[silver]] ore.

==Rumors & Legends==
The exact origin of Fireshear Vale was unknown to most scholars. Some believed the large crater to be a caldera, formed by volcanic activities. Others believed the entire vale was the lasting effect of a star that fell from the skies.
