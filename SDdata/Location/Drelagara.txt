'''Drelagara''' was a small city on [[Evermeet]].

==Description==
It made up in symmetry and quiet beauty what it lacked in grandeur. The buildings were all made from white marble, magically raised from the depths of Evermeet, and the whole city was located in the center of an expanse of gently rolling meadows that measured more than sixty miles (97 kilometers) wide. This meadowland was surrounded on all sides by forests, and within a day's ride of the white-sand beaches of [[Siiluth]].
