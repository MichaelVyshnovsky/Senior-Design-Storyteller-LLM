The Farmeadows was a beautiful glade located on the elven homeland of Evermeet.
The Farmeadows was located in northwestern Evermeet west of the source of the River Ardulith and the Silver Hills. Much of the glade bordered the Trackless Sea.
Herds of mystical moon-horses lived within the Farmeadows.
