        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "At the forest edges, most of the trees were heavily bowed from the accumulated weight of the ice, but deeper within towards the heart of the wood, the trees stood too closely together to bend, and their uppermost boughs became welded together with ice. The forest had very few natural clearings, and no [[human]]-cut roads or trails.\n\nThe icy [[Alaphaer Run]] river ran northwards from the [[Abbey Mountains]] and into the forest, leading almost directly to the fabled [[Monument of the Ancients]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-14 - Frozen Forest and its Surroundings}}",
            "Flora & Fauna": "Ground fogs were ever-present below the low forest canopy; close to the ground there was an unnatural warmth radiating up from underground magma, which  supported the trees and wildlife. Abundant [[rabbit]]s, [[squirrel]]s, and grouse fed lynxes and [[owl]]s (including a few of the [[Giant owl|giant varieties]]) as well as foxes, voles, and other small animals. \n\nAlong the verges of the forest [[moose]], [[elk]], and [[rothé]] foraged, constantly moving to where they could find green shoots, and they used the lee of the forest for protection when the fierce storms of [[North Faerûn|northern Faerun]] hit. [[Caribou]] wintered in the forest, while deep within the forest there were dark [[fey]] who had no love for sentient intruders of any sort."
        },
        "History": "At various times over the ages, humans tried to settle within the forest, but persistent [[hobgoblin]] attacks decimated their settlements and numbers and forced survivors to flee to the south. They reported finding strange ruins and foundations in the forest from previous settlements, from which enchanted weapons and other treasures had been recovered. They also claimed that fell monsters roamed in the depths below these ruins.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The wizard [[Elminster]] has noted that unknown powers actively prevented [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s from living or mining directly under the forest.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Monument of the Ancients]], a ziggurat of alien construction that housed a [[Anchor of Chaos|powerful and ancient artifact]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48}}\n* [[Remorhaz Ride]], a trail used by local [[gnolls]] that ran through the far eastern part of the forest."
