        "mainbody": "The '''Cave of Brother Luiman''' was a holy site of the [[deity]] [[Eldath]] located within the foothills of the [[Snowflake Mountains]] in the kingdom of [[Erlkazar]]. For some time it was home to the hermetic [[monk]], [[Brother Luiman]].",
        "Description": {
            "Luiman's chamber": "The actual cave itself is merely a fissure within the rock of the mountain. The floor was cold and the chill from the water kept the air brisk. The austere chamber was a known location for visions of Eldath to appear. \n\nAny paladin, monk or [[cleric]] of a [[good]]-aligned deity who had undergone a fall-from-grace and chose to spend at least a [[tenday]] sleeping, resting and meditating within the chamber could receive a vision, and perhaps a quest, from the goddess Eldath. If this was the case, the individual successfull completed her tasks of atonement were completed and then returned to the cave for day of contemplation, they could receive the benefits of a spell of ''[[atonement]]''."
        },
        "History": "During the 12{{th}} century [[DR]] a young monk of the [[Order of the Yielding Way|Yielding Way]], by the name of Brother Luiman, sought out the caves beneath the Snowflakes to find penance after his pride and anger left several innocent dead within the [[Tethyr]]ian city of [[Saradush]]. While in quiet solitude, the monk received a vision of Eldath, which began him on a life-long quest to seek out those who had fallen from grace with their deities.\n\nFor years, the monk had brought the spiritually lost, from all the different faiths of [[Faer√ªn]], to his cave, set them upon a path to forgiveness and redemption, and waited for their return to a life of absolution."
