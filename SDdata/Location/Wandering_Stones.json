        "mainbody": "'''Wandering Stones''' was a small village located in southern [[Skelkor]], [[Laerakond]].",
        "Background": "The village was named after the remains of the [[primordial]] [[Arambar]], a group of massive stones that moved on their own accord every night, creating strange patterns that never took the same shape twice. Some believed the spirit of Arambar was the one who changed the position of the stones as a way to mark the time left for some great event to happen.\n\nBecause Wandering Stones was built upon the remains of Arambar, [[dragon]]s feared and shunned the village, making it a perfect home for escaped slaves and other people looking for a safe haven.\n\nThe presence of the spirit of Arambar also had an unexpected effect on the land: it attracted the spirits of the dead from different places and times, even from distant lands such as [[Faer√ªn]]. The spirits of the dead communed with Arambar, and those with enough self-awareness were able to learn old secrets and other kind of information from the old primordial or the other oblivious spirits who believed they still were alive.",
        "Government": "Wandering Stones was ruled by a Stonetalker, an individual who was able to \"speak\" with the stones, gaining great wisdom and insights from them. In truth, the Stonetalker spoke with the spirits of the dead, not with Arambar. As of [[1479 DR]], the Stonetalker was a [[dragonborn]] [[shaman]] named [[Olothon]].",
        "History": "After the sundering of [[Abeir-Toril]], the corpse of Arambar was left in the lands that eventually would become Skelkor, in the world of [[Abeir]]. Slaves who fled from their dragon masters founded the town of Wandering Stones in the rocks that composed the remains of the primordial.\n\nIn 1479 DR, the adventuress [[Jada Marlserpent]] went to Wandering Stones searching refuge and information about her past, as she was born in that village. Knowing that she was one of the fabled [[dragonheir]]s, the [[brown dragon]] [[Thovantareth]] followed her to the town, his hatred for the dragonheirs strong enough to surpass his fear of Arambar. When the dragon was attacking the village, the spirit of Arambar awoke from his millennia long slumber to save Jada and the other inhabitants of Wandering Stones, killing Thovantareth and returned to sleep again.",
        "Notable inhabitants": "* [[Olothon]], the Stonetalker as of 1479 DR.\n* [[Jada Marlserpent]], the last survivor of [[Clan Marlserpent]], and one of the few known dragonheirs.\n* [[Carnelian (spirit)|Carnelian]], an old spirit who was been self-aware for many decades, as of 1479 DR.\n* [[Arambar]], the slumbering spirit of a fallen primordial."
