When the dark elves became drow in , fiends escaped Narathmault and the drow fled to caverns beneath the Thayan Plateau.\nSun elf and moon elf refugees from Shantel Othreier arrived in  and established the realm of Lethyr, vowing to cleanse the Riildath of non-elves and the horrors of Narathmault.\nIn , the elves of Lethyr abandoned the northern portion of the Riildath and an arm of the Great Glacier began scouring the valley of the Great Dale, splitting the forest into the Rawlinswood and the Forest of Lethyr. Tharos, a chieftain of the Nars, discovered the ruins of Narathmault in . His son, Thargaum, established the kingdom of Tharos in , and as its first Nentyarch, built its capital, Dun-Tharos, at the site in .\n* Narathmault\n* Dun-Tharos\n* Dark elves\n* Drow\n* Fiends\n* Sun Elves\n* Moon Elves\n* Nars (humans)"
