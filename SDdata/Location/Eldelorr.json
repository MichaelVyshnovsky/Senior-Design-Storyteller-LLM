        "mainbody": "Eldelorr was a sparsely-populated and almost ruined fishing hamlet on Cape Raeth to the southwest of the Cloakwood.\nEldelorr stood on Cloak Bays north-westernmost top where the Cloakwood reached the waters of the bay. By the 14 century DR, Eldelorr was a collection of single-store cottages reinforced with timber wood and scavenged marine wrecks. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in Eldelorr.\nInhabitants of Eldelorr survived through salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for crabs, silverfins, and laethe, a species of eel-like creatures.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Eldelorr, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14 century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster attacks."
