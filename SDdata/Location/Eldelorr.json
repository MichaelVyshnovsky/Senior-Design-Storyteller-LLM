        "mainbody": "'''Eldelorr''' was a sparsely-populated and almost ruined [[fish]]ing hamlet on [[Cape Raeth]] to the southwest of the [[Cloakwood]].",
        "Description": "Eldelorr stood on [[Cloak Bay]]'s north-westernmost top where the [[Cloakwood]] reached the waters of the bay. By the 14{{th}} century DR, Eldelorr was a collection of single-store cottages reinforced with timber wood and scavenged marine wrecks. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in Eldelorr.\n\nInhabitants of Eldelorr survived through salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for [[crab]]s, [[silverfin]]s, and [[laethe]], a species of [[eel]]-like creatures.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Eldelorr, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14{{th}} century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster attacks."
