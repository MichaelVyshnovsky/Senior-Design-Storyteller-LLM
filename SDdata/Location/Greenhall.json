        "mainbody": "Greenhall was an elf village within the enchanted Quivering Forest in the Moonsea region in the late 15 century DR.\nThe elves cautiously welcomed trade with members of the Emerald Enclave, but rarely made themselves available for non-elves. They had a severe distrust of citizens of Phlan, the dark fey of the forest, and the orc tribes from nearby Thar."
