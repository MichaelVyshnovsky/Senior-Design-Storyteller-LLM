The Roots of the Earth was an unusual combination tavern and shrine to Grumbar, the Earthlord, in early 1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard. Owned, operated, and attended by retired miner Torgan Minerson, he became a convert of Grumbar after surviving entrapment by a cave-in and having visions during his traumatic experience. The Roots was located in the mining district on the east edge of town and catered to the rough and tumble miners with cheap food and drink.
