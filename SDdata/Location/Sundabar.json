        "mainbody": "'''Sundabar''', previously known as '''Citadel Sundbarr''', While it was originally a [[dwarven]] citadel, it evolved as its demographics, exports and overall culture changed. One thing remained however, Sundabar continued to serve as the rampart of [[the north]], keeping the realm's dangers beyond civilized lands.",
        "Description": {
            "Layout": "Sundabar was a fortress. surface was surrounded by two ringed walls, surrounded by ''Tarnar's Moat'', a water-filled trench that was rumored to be filled with man-eating [[eel]]s. Within its walls, Sundabar's massive stone buildings were encircled by cobblestone streets, with no flora to be found save for the sparse window-box garden of fragrant [[herb]]s.\n\nFour gates and bridges led into the city: ''Swordsgate'' in the north, ''Eastgate'' in the northeast, ''Turnstone Gate'' in the southeast and ''Rivergate'' in the west.\n\nBeneath Sundabar was a volcano rift known as the [[Everfire]].\n\nConnected to the surface by a steep passage, the [[Undercity (Sundabar)|Undercity]] was home to most of the dwarven population."

        "Government": {
            "Adventuring charters": "The government office of Sundabar maintained a standing list of jobs they needed to have completed and would hire adventuring companies to this end. The adventurers were granted a city charter, which granted them limited authority to complete their specified task. This charter was to be made available to any city official upon demand.\n\nPay for these jobs varied, depending on what was needed, the time of year and whether the task involved a significant threat to the city. Fewer adventurers and increasingly dangerous weather in the winter led to more gold for the hired swords. However, the charters came with a provision that 10% of the value of any loot or valuables gathered by adventurers during their contract, be contributed to Sundabar as a fee for being granted a contract."
        },
        "Economy": "The city was a trading hub for ore from [[Citadel Adbar]] and the dwarves of [[Fardrimm]].\n\nFurthermore, the city was well-stocked, with larders that could feed the city for months, and had a protected source of fresh well water from the subterranean [[Lake Anfarra]].",
        "Defense": "In addition to their structural defenses the city was protected by a number of groups and organizations:\n\n*[[Stone Shields]]: Sundabar's city watch; led by the [[Watchblade]], who often received magical assistance from the local [[cleric]]s of [[Helm]] or [[Tyr]].\n*[[Watchful]]: A network of spies also under command of the Watchblade.\n*[[Shieldsar]]: Sundabar's main defense were the ~2000-strong riders, infantry and archers who patrolled the Sundabar Vale in defense of their city.\n*[[Vigilant (Sundabar)|Vigilant]]: An elite group of dwarven warriors that constantly stood guard at the Everfire.\n\nUnder the reign of Helm Dwarf-Friend, taxes from the Sundabarans were used the proceeds to shore up Sundabar's defenses against orc attacks, which had become a regular occurrence during those years. The deep treasury of the city helped keep both adventuring companies, as well as hardened mercenaries on retainer. This latter group, who also just happened to be old friends of one [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]], were known as the [[Bloodaxe Mercenary Company]].\n\nSundabar could also count on allies from the region of the Underdark located under the lands between the North and the [[Anauroch|Anauroch desert]] known as the [[Fardrimm]].",
        "Geography": "Sundabar was located in [[Sundabar Vale]] on the eastern side of [[Silverymoon Pass]], with the [[Nether Mountains]] making up the southern border of the valley.\n\nThe [[Rauvin Mountains]] and [[Citadel Felbarr]] were upriver on the [[Redrun|River Redrun]], [[Rauvincross]] downriver, [[Baraskur]] to the east, and [[Auvandell]] in the western slopes of the Nether Mountains. Sundabar was directly connected to [[Citadel Adbar]] by the [[Dead Orc Pass]], but only the most daring (or foolish) of travelers took that route.\n\nSundabar was connected to [[Silverymoon]] via the [[Silverymoon Pass road|road]] that ran through Silverymoon Pass. The entire journey took between one and two tendays, with the distance making up nearly 150 miles.",

        "History": {
            "A City Reborn": "The next 500 years would be much more fortuitous for the citadel. As the new human inhabitants settled in and united with their dwarven brethren, the reconstruction of the stronghold led to the birth of a new city. As dwarven craftsmanship became perfectly interwoven with human mercantilism, the newly-named ''Sundabar'' flourished into the symbol of strength it would become in the North.\n\nIn the 13th century DR, the foundries and workshop closest to the Everfire rift were destroyed by a surge of fire and never repaired. Since then, the fires burned without any control by the dwarves.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1355}}, Helm Dwarf-Friend became the sixth Ruling Master of Sundabar after the previous Master died defending the city from orcs.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1364}}, [[Iriador Wintermist]] brings a hailstorm to Sundabar to avenge the loss of the barding colleges in Faerun.<ref>\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[fiend]]s from [[Hellgate Keep]] attacked Sundabar, burning much of the city before being forced out. Just four years later, in [[1373 DR]], [[Kaanyr Vhok]] attempted to take control of the city because of a rivalry he had with Helm Dwarf-Friend. He first used [[Aliisza]] to infiltrate Helm Dwarf-Friend's house, then allied with [[Zasian Menz]] and [[Bane|Banite]] priests. His plan ultimately failed.\n\nSundabar was one of the city-states to join together in the [[League of the Silver Marches]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, later renamed \"Luruar\", alongside Silverymoon, Citadel Adbar, [[Deadsnows]], [[Jalanthar]], [[Quaervarr]], Citadel Felbarr, [[Everlund]], and [[Mithral Hall]]. The goal of the alliance was to protect the North from the growing hordes of orcs in the mountains.<ref><ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, during the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Sundabar was conquered by a orc army commanded by the warlord [[Hartusk]] and renamed Hartusk Keep.{{cite book/Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|54}}             \n\n{{sectstub}}"
