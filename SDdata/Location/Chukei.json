        "mainbody": "'''Chukei Province''' was the northernmost province of the empire of [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]] by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In ancient times, it was '''Chu'ta Te''', first a province of [[Anok-Imaskar]] and later an independent realm in its own right, before becoming '''Chu'ta Te Province''' of early Shou Lung. It largely encompassed the '''Chukei Plateau'''.",
        "Geography": "By the 14{{th}} century, the Chukei Plateau was a vast plain scoured by winds and stricken with droughts. There was little water and sparse grasses. Nights were freezing cold.",
        "Etymology": "The early name \"Chu'ta Te\" could be translated to \"The Great\".",
        "History": {
            "Ancient History": "By around {{Yearlink|-2300}}, the land was a part of the empire of [[Anok-Imaskar]]. The empire collapsed in {{Yearlink|-1943}}, fracturing into a number of warring states, among them the new independent realm called Chu'ta Te.\n\nAccording to [[Shou]] legend, the empire of Shou Lung first began here, when it was known as Chu'ta Te Province. At this time, the land was a green and open plain, where [[barley]] and millet grew and the empire flourished. However, the destruction of the Imperial city of [[Kuo Meilan]] in inferno and drought changed all this. Those left alive migrated southward, leaving behind a dry wasteland."
        },
        "People": "The folk of Chukei stood as the tallest of the [[Shou]] peoples. They typically had high cheekbones and brown or reddish hair, in contrast with the typical black, such that the [[High Shou|Shou word]] for a redhead was \"chukien\".{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|63}} The Chukei people had a reputation for courageous bearing reflected in a cold anger, alongside a fairly wild temperament.\n\nThey were known to be talented horse-riders and swordfighters.{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|65}}\n\nThey spoke a dialect of the empire's [[Kao te Shou]] language, called Chukei Kao. It sounded blunt and harsh compared to the empire's other dialects.\n\nThe Chukei people produced [[Northern Cuisine]], which included a number of [[noodle]] dishes.",
        "Government": "For officials of the Shou Lung empire, Chukei Province was never one's first posting. Instead, it was the destination of those who'd failed or disgraced themselves, being essentially a punishment.",
        "Locations": "Chukei Province was home to [[Fukiow]], a large mining city; [[Kangste]], a major trade town; and [[Chaoyang]], which maintained a border garrison at the meeting of the [[Spice Road]] and the [[Kuangchiu Road]].\n\nThe great city of Kuo Meilan, abandoned and shunned, rested in the center of the Chukei Plateau, surrounded by a landscape devoid of life.",
        "Legends": "The Chukei Plateau was claimed to be haunted by [[ghost]]s from Kuo Meilan, screaming endlessly through the chill night."
