        "mainbody": "he Blackwash Fens was a boggy lowland area found along the coast of the Great Sea in the far northern reaches of Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nThe fens were located in the Suns Eye province of the Yikarian Empire on the banks of the River Ruin at the edge of Pearl Bay near the city of Lipo. The fens were created by the heavy rainfall the region experienced. The depth of the fens was determined by both the tides of the Great Sea and the current state of the River Ruin."
