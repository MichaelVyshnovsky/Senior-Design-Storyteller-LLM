            "The Spring Court": "The Spring Court was held in a wide sublevel, with thin shafts leading to the surface; beams of morning light fell into the grotto from there. A pool of crystal water lay at the center of the chamber; with a great throne of pale stone in the middle; the [[Nentyarch]] sat there during meetings. The walls of the chamber had subtle designs of vines, leaves, and such; they appeared to move. The high druids had seats around the pool.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|118-119|13}}",
            "Skymeadow": "Skymeadow was a garden high on the side of Yeshelmaar. It had a patio of reddish flagstones, surrounded by low benches, themselves surrounded by leafy fruit trees. Outside that circumference, there were flowering mints and more fruit trees. Beyond, there was a landscaped pool with a cool grotto carved into the stone of the fortress. Within the grotto itself, there was a bronze statue of Corellon Larethian.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|131-132|14}}"

A feat of elven engineering, it began as a stronghold carved into a tor overlooking a coldwater lake and grew upward, downward, and inward.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|109-110|12}}\n\nIn {{Yearlink|1371}}, the [[Nentyarch]], driven from [[Dun-Tharos]] by the [[Rotting Man]], took refuge in Yeshelmaar and established it as the seat-in-exile of the [[Circle of Leth]] and their [[Nentyar hunter]]s.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1479}}, Yeshelmaar was the only major outpost of civilization in the Great Dale, as trade activity along the [[Great Road]] had collapsed."
