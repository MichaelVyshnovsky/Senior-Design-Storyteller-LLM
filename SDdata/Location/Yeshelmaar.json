        "mainbody": "Yeshelmaar was a major settlement in the Forest of Lethyr and the center of civilization in the Great Dale. It was difficult to distinguish between the towns stonework and the surrounding hillsides volcanic stone. Plantings of trees and green ivy were featured throughout, while elevated walkways and stairways connected the towns spires.\n* Druids\n* Rangers\n* Wood elves\nYeshelmaar was carved into a rocky tor, with a pristine lake of cold water at the foot of the hill. As of , it was an elaborate construction, hard to tell where the natural stone ended and the construction began. Greenery was planted throughout the construction. The main gates were made of iron an stone, leading into a wide square-cut tunnel flagged with granite. Many small side tunnels opened into dark chambers, but the main passage was lit with lamps, with the light of day leaking in. Some of the rooms opened into rooftop gardens, but sheer plunges off the side of Yeshelmaar were common.\nThe flags of the Circle of Leth and the Nentyarch were flown on top of the fortress as of . Also, there was a phoenix nest atop the fortress.\nThe Spring Court was held in a wide sublevel, with thin shafts leading to the surface beams of morning light fell into the grotto from there. A pool of crystal water lay at the center of the chamber with a great throne of pale stone in the middle the Nentyarch sat there during meetings. The walls of the chamber had subtle designs of vines, leaves, and such they appeared to move. The high druids had seats around the pool.\nSkymeadow was a garden high on the side of Yeshelmaar. It had a patio of reddish flagstones, surrounded by low benches, themselves surrounded by leafy fruit trees. Outside that circumference, there were flowering mints and more fruit trees. Beyond, there was a landscaped pool with a cool grotto carved into the stone of the fortress. Within the grotto itself, there was a bronze statue of Corellon Larethian.\nThe elves of Lethyr established Yeshelmaar in response to raids by the Nars and retreated there when forced to abandon the northern Riildath in . A feat of elven engineering, it began as a stronghold carved into a tor overlooking a coldwater lake and grew upward, downward, and inward.\nIn , the Nentyarch, driven from Dun-Tharos by the Rotting Man, took refuge in Yeshelmaar and established it as the seat-in-exile of the Circle of Leth and their Nentyar hunters.\nBy , Yeshelmaar was the only major outpost of civilization in the Great Dale, as trade activity along the Great Road had collapsed."
