        "mainbody": "The '''Emerald Grove''', also named the '''Old Oak's Grove''', was a [[druid]] grove dedicated to [[Silvanus]] and was a group aligned with the [[Emerald Enclave]]. The Emerald Grove was located near the [[River Chionthar]] on the [[Western Heartlands]] and active during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was the home to a [[Druid circle|circle]] of [[druid]]s led by [[Archdruid]] [[Halsin]]. It experienced great turmoil during the early 1490s DR as it was beleaguered by [[goblin]] raids, housed a population of refugees, and was infiltrated by members of the [[Shadow Druids]].",
        "Geography": "The grove was situated just off the [[Risen Road]], between the cities of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Elturel]], some ways east of [[Moonrise Towers]]. It was north of the [[River Chionthar]].",
        "Description": {
            "Hollow": "[[File:Hollows.png|thumb|right|300px|''The ''Hollow'', a makeshift home for the [[Elturel|Elturian]] [[tiefling]]s.'']]\nThe Hollow of the grove was hewn into the stony cliffs overlooking the river, with some passages that were formed naturally and others that were hewn into the rock. The ceiling of these caves were supported by large stone columns and held some openings to let in light from the day's sky. One passageway led into a deep chasm beneath the grove, while another led into the cliffside overlooking the Chionthar. The main passage out of the Hollows formed a circular walkway leading down to the grove's main shrine.",
            "Sacred Pool": "Just beyond the Hollow was an open-air shrine of Silvanus. Crumbling stone columns encircled a naturally-forming geyser that emptied into a reflecting pool that lay in the shrine's center, decorated with trees, vines, and plants that offered a look that could be defined as \"controlled overgrowth\". It was here that the druids of the Enclave performed their most powerful [[ritual]]s, using the sacred ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' as their [[focus]].\n\nWooden walkways led down to a small beach along the river's edge, and a wood-platform elevator granted access to the Hollow above.\n\n[[File:Emerald Grove Int.png|thumb|left|300px|''The inner sanctum of the grove...'']]",
            "Emerald Grove": "The inner sanctum of the grove was a naturally-formed cave that had been reinforced with stone architecture. Its central chamber served as a gathering room and common area, with living quarters and a library off to its side. Set above an underground freshwater pool from which the geyser arose, the central chamber featured a series of murals that depicted the grove's history; these murals portrayed its founding, the forming of the alliance between the druids and the [[Harpers]], and their defeat of [[Shar]]rans at [[Moonrise Towers]].\n\n[[File:Emerald_Grove_Library.png|thumb|right|300px|''...and its adjoining library.'']]\nThe library held many [[rune]]-etched stone slabs each roughly the size of a hand-held [[book]]. At the center of the library's shelves was a tall, stylized sculpture with the likeness of a lupine beast, around which stood four pedestals with a depression each for a specific rectangular [[runestone]]. Each runestone corresponded to a totem animal associated with one of the preeminent druids of the grove: the [[bear]], [[wolf]], [[stag]], and [[eagle]]. When the correct runestones were placed in each pedestal, a vibrant blue glow illuminated the stonework in the room and the bestial sculpture descended into the earth, revealing a circular staircase that led down to the enclave's hidden vault."
        },
        "Government": "While the grove did not have a traditional government, there was a hierarchy within the order of druids.",
        "Defenses": "It was set within a cave system, which itself was protected by natural fortifications and a great wooden portcullis.",
        "History": {
            "Murals": "<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"190\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nBGIII Emerald Grove mural1.png|''By claw and tooth, from root to thorn,<br />The Old Oak's grove, to wildlings sworn.''\nBy Claw and Tooth.png|''The forest rose with claw and tooth,<br />To tear the darkness from its roots.''\nIn the Darkest Hour.png|''In darkest hour, a concord made,<br />Twixt harp and wild against the shade.''\nThe Towers Seized.png|''The towers seized, the battle done,<br />the moonrise broke the Darkest One''\n</gallery>"

        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Druid of the Emerald Grove.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A druid of the Emerald Grove accessing the [[primal magic|powers of nature]].'']]\nWhile the grove held connections with the Emerald Enclave, it was unknown exactly which druids of its circle were members of the expansive organization. The druids of the Emerald Grove were drawn from various races, including [[dwarves]], [[elves]], and [[gnome]]s.\n\nArchdruid [[Halsin]] was served by numerous honest and well-meaning individuals, including the dutiful second [[Rath (druid)|Rath]], a trustworthy and dedicated advisor, and [[Nettie]], a well-meaning but sometimes-misguided apprentice healer. In addition to its [[humanoid]] residents, the grove was home to many animals that each exhibited quirky personality traits to [[speak with animals|those that could understand them]]. Among these were the [[bear]]s [[Ormn]] and [[Tuffet]], and the bluejay [[Topaz (bird)|Topaz]] among others. When Master Halsin went missing in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Kagha]] became the Acting Archdruid.\n\nA potential Archdruid successor was [[Francesca of the High Forest]]."
