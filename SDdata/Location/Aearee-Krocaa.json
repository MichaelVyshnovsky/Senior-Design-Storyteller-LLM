The Aearee-Krocaa later experimented on domesticated [[landwyrm]]s to create the first winged [[wyrm]]s, or [[wyvern]]s as the aearee named them. They supported their forces with wyvern armies, rapidly expanding the Aearee-Krocaa empire.\n\nFinally, around {{Yearlink|-30000}}, [[dragon]]s all around Faerûn swarmed, forming the first [[Flight of Dragon]]s. They assaulted the aearee everywhere, in the skies, on the land, and even underground. Descending on Viakoo from the skies, they completed razed it. This marked the fall of the Aearee Empires, the rise of the [[Time of Dragons]], and the beginning of the [[Dawn Ages]]."
