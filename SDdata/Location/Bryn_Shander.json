It was the gateway to its fellow towns of the dale, as well as their lifeline to the rest of civilization to the south.\nThe city was the only one of the Ten Towns not located on the shores of either Maer Dualdon, Redwaters, or Lac Dinneshere. Instead, it was located on top of a hill south of Kelvins Cairn.\nThe Eastway connected the city to the town of Easthaven in the east.\nThe circular walled town itself was placed upon a hill, with snowy plains stretching in all directions.\nBryn Shander was considered the heart and mercantile hub of the Ten Towns. Folks from all around the surrounding settlements gathered in the Tenth Town to sell their goods, primarily consisting of scrimshaw made from the bones of knucklehead trout. \nMerchants from the lands south of the Wall brought in goods that could not be found in the Frozenfar, such as spices, fruits, wines and hardwood lumber, from as far away as the Heartlands.\nBecause of its defensive location, residents of cities east of Bryn Shander often took refuge within the city walls during wartime.\nThe towns security was overseen by its sheriff and their deputy. They maintained a small town guard of twenty militiamen and could rally a force of about 400 in dire times of need. Additionally, the sheriff was granted powers to hire on adventurers to complete any tasks that ensured the safety of Bryn Shanders people and secured its trade interests.\nBryn Shander was last of the Ten Towns to be founded. Only a single cabin stood in the towns location, used as a stopover by those traveling to other settlements of the dale. At some point, craftsmen began to sell scrimshaw outside the cabin, and other scrimshanders from other towns followed their lead.\nThe town expanded rapidly, and new buildings and trading posts were built in succession to accommodate all the new businesses. The traders brought with them their long-standing rivalries and feuds from their hometowns,\nIn the , the Ten Towns were attacked by the barbarians of Icewind Dale. With the aid of Drizzt DoUrden and Bruenor Battlehammer, the horde was defeated at the gates of Bryn Shander.\nSome years later, the town was besieged by the forces of Akar Kessell, until a reinforcement of dwarf troops led by Bruenor as well as a unified horde of barbarians under Wulfgar arrived. \nIn the fall of , the drow warrior Tiago Baenre defeated the returned demon Errtu on a plain outside Bryn Shander, endearing himself to the city. In commemoration of that event, a statue of him was erected on that spot, which consisted of a wide black circle. The statue depicted Tiago with a sword and shield. The plaque read \"On this spot did Master Tiago slay the demon. And the snows will cover it nevermore.\"\nIn the late 15 century, sometime after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, Bryn Shander was attacked by a group of frost giants led by Drufi. The giants attacked the city looking for Artus Cimber expecting to acquire the Ring of Winter. The attack was thwarted by the citys inhabitants with the help of adventurers.\nthumb|250px|A map of Bryn Shander circa .\nInns & taverns\n* Bloodrils Snug Haven\n* Faelfarils Inn, an old and drafty boarding house\n* Geldenstags Rest, the longstanding inn that lacked a bit in the way of luxury and convenience.\n* Hooked Knucklehead, the inn preferred by craftsmen and business people alike\n* Kelvins Comfort, a tavern that was popular among caravaneers\n* Northlook, the inn that catered to sellswords and adventurers\nLandmarks\n* The armory, located at the edge of the Market Square.\n* Council Hall, the meeting place of the Ten Towns spokesmen.\n* Market Square, a bustling marketplace located in the center of town and featuring knucklehead trout, scrimshaw, vegetables, reindeer meat, and handicrafts.\n* Town hall\nShops\n* Blackiron Blades, a small shop and smithy north of the town square that made the cheapest weapons in Ten Towns.\n* Rendarils Emporium, the largest trade house in the city, famous for its fine merchandise that included dwarven weapons from Kelvins Cairn and more.\nResidences\n* Speakers Palace, the private residence of Bryn Shanders speaker.\nTemples\n* House of the Triad, the citys temple dedicated to Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater.\n* Shrine of Amaunator, a small place of worship overseen by the devout follower Mithann.\nAll manner of folks who sought to find a life for themselves settled in Icewind Dale, from fishermen, fur-trappers and merchants, to mercenaries, criminals, and other less-reputable types."
