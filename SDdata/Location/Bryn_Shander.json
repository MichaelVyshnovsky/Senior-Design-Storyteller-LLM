        "What's Bryn Shander like, ye ask? It's sixy score humans, packed together like fish in a barrel an' smelling about as sweet. Its roads are paved with the muck o' the cart horses ye're constantly rubbing shoulders with, an' its alehouses are filled with scoundrels that no other city in Faer√ªn would have. An' after three weeks on [[Ten Trail]]. you'll swear there was no lovelier sight!\n|[[Beorne Steelstrike]]}}": "=Geography==",

        "Trade": "Bryn Shander was considered the heart and mercantile hub of the Ten Towns. Folks from all around the surrounding settlements gathered in the ''Tenth Town'' to sell their goods, primarily consisting of [[scrimshaw]] made from the bones of [[knucklehead trout]]. \n\nMerchants from the lands south of ''the Wall'' brought in goods that could not be found in the Frozenfar, such as spices, fruits, wines and hardwood lumber, from as far away as the [[Heartlands]].",
        "Defenses": "Because of its defensive location, residents of cities east of Bryn Shander often took refuge within the city walls during wartime.\n\nThe town's security was overseen by its sheriff and their deputy. They maintained a small town guard of twenty militiamen and could rally a force of about 400 in dire times of need. Additionally, the sheriff was granted powers to hire on [[adventurer]]s to complete any tasks that ensured the safety of Bryn Shander's people and secured its trade interests.",

            "14{{th}} Century": "In the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, the Ten Towns were attacked by the [[barbarian]]s of Icewind Dale. With the aid of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], the horde was defeated at the gates of Bryn Shander.\n\nSome years later, the town was besieged by the forces of [[Akar Kessell]], until a reinforcement of [[dwarf]] troops led by Bruenor as well as a unified horde of barbarians under Wulfgar arrived.",
            "15{{th}} Century": "In the fall of {{YearlinkName|1466}}, the [[drow]] warrior [[Tiago Baenre]] defeated the returned [[demon]] [[Errtu]] on a plain outside Bryn Shander, endearing himself to the city. In commemoration of that event, a statue of him was erected on that spot, which consisted of a wide black circle. The statue depicted Tiago with a sword and shield. The plaque read: \"On this spot did Master Tiago slay the demon. And the snows will cover it nevermore.\"\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century, sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] of [[1485 DR]], Bryn Shander was attacked by a group of [[frost giant]]s led by [[Drufi]]. The giants attacked the city looking for [[Artus Cimber]] expecting to acquire the ''[[Ring of Winter]]''. The attack was thwarted by the city's inhabitants with the help of adventurers."
