'''Thundertree''' was a small village in the plains east of [[Neverwinter]] on the edge of the [[Neverwinter Wood]]. It was destroyed by [[1451 DR]].

==Economy==
This small village supported itself by harvesting timber and shipping it downriver to Neverwinter and beyond. 

In the 1360s DR, a [[ranger]] by the name of [[Ansal Bloodshoulder]] served as unofficial leader of the settlement, cooperated with the woodcutters to ensure that felled trees were carefully chosen and that when one tree was cut, another would be planted in its place. Vines and diseased trees were removed and burned. This logging method was approved of, albeit begrudgingly, by the [[elves]] that lived in Neverwinter Wood.

==History==
Thundertree was once a community that prospered on the edges of the Neverwinter Woods. 

During the founding of the village, Thundertree was defended from monsters by the hero [[Palien]] of [[Neverwinter]], who would be honored with a statue in the town square.

The village was the hometown of young [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] who would later gain fame and infamy. At some point in her childhood, she managed to save Thundertree from a power-hungry [[wizard]] of [[Luskan]]m using her [[enchanted]] ''[[ring of the wood elves]]'' – a gift from [[Ansal Bloodshoulder]]. At some point later, the village came under attack by an [[orc]] raiding party, killing most of the inhabitants at the time, with Aribeth de Tylmarande surviving the massacre.

When traveling across [[the North]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Volothamp Geddarm]] did not get a chance to properly visit the village and so only briefly discussed it in his guidebook, [[Volo's Guide to the North (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to the North'']].

However, when [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted in the [[1451 DR|Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR]], it devastated the small town. During this time, Thundertree lay in overgrown ruins, with many of its stone houses lacking roofs and lying open to the elements, though some remained mostly intact. It was disturbingly quiet.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Ashmadai]] leader [[Favria]] set up camp in the ruins of Thundertree, living within a ruined inn's underground [[wine]] cellar. From there, she tracked activity in both Neverwinter and everywhere the [[Thayan]]s employed their cult.

By [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the zombies had crumbled to dust, but strange [[magic]] had turned the local flora into [[twig blight]]s.

==Notable Locations==
*Chapel of [[Waukeen]], a small shrine dedicated to the Merchant's Friend in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[The Hammer and Shield Inn]], an establishment frequented by loggers and barge captains in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]:
* [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]]
* [[Ansal Bloodshoulder]]

By 1491 DR, no one inhabited the ruins of Thundertree, but for two exceptions:
* [[Reidoth]] was a gaunt, white-bearded [[human]] [[druid]] who visited the ruins of Thundertree from time to time, keeping any from wandering into the dangers that lurked within the ruins.
* [[Venomfang]] was a young [[green dragon]] who had taken the ruins of Thundertree as his own lair as of approximately [[1490 DR]]. The [[Cult of the Dragon]] had followed the dragon and hoped to gain its alliance.
