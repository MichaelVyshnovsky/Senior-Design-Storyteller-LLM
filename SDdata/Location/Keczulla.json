The town stood on the the Eshpurta Road, to the east from Amnwater and west of Eshpurta.\nThe city was separated into four districts and eight wards. The Emerald District housed the Mithral & Platinum Wards Sapphire District held the Gold & Electrum Wards Jade District was home to the Silver & Bronze Wards and Agate District was where the Copper & Harbor Moon Districts could be found. The wards and districts status and prestige were determined by the price of their namesakes. The districts and wards were separated by stone arches with inserted keystones of gems and ingots above the districts carved names. The arcs were always guarded, and anyone defacing them or removing the keystones was executed with prejudice.\nKeczulla was known for the blistering sun heat that reached its peak in highsun, especially harshly felt during the markets.\nEven though Keczulla was a town of wealth, its streets had their share of poverty. Merchant families of the town generously financed orphanages for the citys parentless children as a way to show off their wealth and status. However, many of the kids stayed untamed by civilization, turning to feral existence.\nThe Keczulla was ruled by a Council of Elders, representatives of the richest and most influential families in the city. The managerial duties were handled by Tarkas Thallavv the Gemayor circa 1370 DR. He controlled the accounting, managed the citys needs, and was the public face of the government. However, the true leader was Lady Lhynvor Tanislove, who held the most power and respect in the city. She did support Tarkass management and recognized his skill.\nthumb|A map of Keczulla and the surrounding area.|420x420px\nKeczullas gem mines were at the center of the towns culture, religion, and trade. The towns production of a significant number of precious stones and gems led to the Elders commissioning a unit dedicated exclusively to protecting the towns livelihood&mdashKeczullas Gem Guard.\nApart from gem mining, Keczulla had electrum mines outside of the city, iron mines, salt mines, among many others.\nOther businesses flourished in Keczulla. The city was flush with inns, taverns, shots, craftsmen, wainwrights, and mercenaries.\nApart from the Gem Guard, the city had a garrison of 1000 able-bodied defenders, with 200 of them being trained cavaliers. Keczullas troopers were charged with keeping the Eshpurta Road safe on the stretch between Amnwater and halfway to the town of Eshpurta.\nThe Gem Guard was tasked with defending the citys mines and act as the guard within Keczullas walls. The Guard numbered around 500 members. The leader of the Guard was the Jewelieutenant and the squares were helmed by Captains.\nthumb|A gem merchant from Keczulla appraising a glittering specimen.|400x400px\nThe city was founded in 575 DR, as a minor mining town during the gold rush that swept Amn. The wealthy Keczull family were the driving force behind the settlement of the land.\nKeczulla had existed as a mining town until the mineral vein that fueled the community was exhausted in 755 DR. With the death of the mining industry, the town started shrinking, eventually becoming virtually deserted.\nKeczulla was resettled in 1242 DR who cleared the site off of trolls and other monstrous creatures. The town became a traveling and caravan stop for those who traversed the Eshpurta Road.\nThe rejuvenated mining city blossomed, swelling with a population that reached 42,000 soils by 1357 DR. The towns reputation was reinforced by regular \"dirt to diamonds\" stories that emerged from Keczulla every year to so.\nIn 1345 DR, Tessurch Quorl Vemmil of Amn attempted to wrestle power from the Meisarch, the leader of the Council of Six. Quorl instrumented a deadly consumption (an angry mob, tipped off by the Meisarchs agents).\nIn 1355 DR, a local Keczullan merchant Pulth Tanislove purchased a set of papers from heirs of a recently passed hermit who lived on the edges of town. The merchant discovered research on a long-lost gem mine and eventually found its location. By 1357 DR, he was the owner of a rich ruby mine and used his new wealth to buy land on the Ridge north of Keczulla, where he discovered even more rich gem veins. This mining company, the Tanislove Mines, was the largest and the most prosperous mining organization in Amn.\nCirca 1357 DR, a merchant from Keczulla, Andruth Pearlseeker, accidentally created a fad among Amnian nobles. Andruths shipment of eggs got delayed, allowing the half hatch into strange small blue flightless birds. The merchant quickly found demand for the animals among the upper echelons of Amnian society. Andruth made a fortune, selling every bird out of 23,000 for 150 danters each.\nIn 1366 DR, the Gem Road that connected Keczulla and Esmeltaran was completed with the funding from the Council of Six and Lord Pulth Tanislove.\nBy 1370 DR, Amnian families exiled from Tethyr for their kins crimes, settled in the cities of Esmeltaran, Keczulla, and Eshpurta.\nOne unnamed mining company, among many in Keczulla, was rumored to have discovered a vein of adamantine and secretly transported the metal to Athkatla.\n*Coinstacks the golden-spired temple of Tymora that was located in the Mithral Ward of Emerald District.
