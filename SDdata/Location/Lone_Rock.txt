'''Lone Rock''' was a small island of little note located where the [[Dragon Reach]] met the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the [[Vast]].

==Description==
Lone Rock was a wooded and mountainous island, known as a ship graveyard, surrounded by wrecks of endless naval vessels.{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|20}} The island itself was just half a mile long and a third of a mile across. One of its ends rose up above the Dragon Reach waters like a longhorn, carpeted with seabird nests.

===Flora & Fauna===
A bare rocky island had no inhabitants apart from an endless number of seabirds and any creatures that tried in seabird guano that splattered the entirety of the island. Lone Rock had no known monster prowling its shores.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230707122016/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_010203-07.htm| title = So Saith Ed Jan â€“ Mar 2007| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==History==
Lone Rock's name was given to the rocky outcropping by early navigators that used it to mark a dangerous area where any ship met its doom on the sea rocks, swept away by turbulence in the swells. Anchorage was nearly impossible, and the island historically was used as a form of punishment by the pirates of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Thieves and murderers were marooned on Lone Rock with no food or water to die slowly. In later years, Lone Rock was used by [[mage]]s who used ''[[teleportation]]'' magic to stop over and rest away from civilization and prying eyes. Some spellcasters ended up using Long Rock as a prison.

Sometime ''circa'' the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ship with [[Lionel Silverspeak]]'s family of [[Ravens Bluff]], ''[[Dragon's Claw]]'' was bound to sail around the Lone Rock but was struck with a storm. The winds tossed ''Dragon's Claw'' onto the Lone Rock's rocks. Lionel Silverspeak survived only because he missed the trip partying and carousing.

In the late 14{{th}} century DR, a strange sight was witnessed by a passing trade vessel from [[Tulbegh]] to [[Tsurlagol]]. A ship, completely made of glass (or some other translucent material), was stuck in the many rocks and wooden beams and planks surrounding the island. Its masts were broken, and hull broken. The crew was stated to had been [[elves]] or very thin and tall [[human]]s, adorned in strange ornate [[armor]]. The strange wreck got some renown and fast. The last people heard of it was when a pirate vessel called ''[[The Black Serpent]]'' sailed to the glass ship's location from [[The Windrace]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Some believed that Lone Rock had a rich vein of [[gem]]stones somewhere on the island; however, sages failed to agree upon what types of gems exactly.
