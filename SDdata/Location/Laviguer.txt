'''Laviguer''' was a mining town in the kingdom of [[Impiltur]] in [[northeast Faer没n]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|59, 62}}

==Geography==
It lay in the Uplands of northwestern Impiltur, at the foot of the [[Earthspur Mountains]], at the end of the [[Prince's Road]].

==Description==
Laviguer was a hub for the mining industry in the Earthspur Mountains, working in competition with the neighboring town of [[Vordric Dun]]. The mining trade here was very profitable for the kingdom. However, they were rough and rowdy places.

==People==
Laviguer was full of hard-working, hard-living, and hard-drinking men and women who worked the mines.

==Government==
War-Captain [[Haelimbrar]], one of the [[Lords of Imphras II]], was based in Laviguer. He was charged with securing the northern and western borders of the realm, but was often away on secret missions.

==Law & Order==
The [[Warswords of Impiltur]], and through them the Council of Lords, policed Laviguer heavily, with crackdowns on criminal activity and regularly placing it under "daggerbond", a martial law that forbade the open wearing of weapons within the town. They were flexible with the miners, though, owing to the riches they brought to the realm.

==Notable inhabitants==
Around [[1374 DR]], one "Sarshel of Laviguer" was in fact the young King [[Imbrar II]] living in deep cover to avoid assassins prior to his coronation, under the protection of the [[Order of the Bladewright]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionic Classes}}
