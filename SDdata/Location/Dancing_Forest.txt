The '''Dancing Forest''' was a small forest that grew along the [[Turmway]] and sheltered the town of [[Centaur Bridge]].

==Description==
The Dancing Forest was too small to appear on most maps. However, it was notable for surrounding the town of Centaur Bridge and its namesake bridge. The Dancing Forest's most notable feature was a thick white mist that seemingly never disappeared.
