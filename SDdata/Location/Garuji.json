        "mainbody": "aruji was a town and fortress in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.\nThe southernmost settlement of the kingdom in the midâ€“14 century DR, it stood guard over the trade road through the foothills of the Himasla Mountains. Its garrison patrolled the road and fought with the mountain buso, while other strange creatures prowled the surrounding jungle. Perhaps understandably, Priest-King Vishnan VII struggled to persuade people to settle in the area."
