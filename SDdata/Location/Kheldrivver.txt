'''Kheldrivver''' was small hamlet at the southeastern edge of the [[Troll Hills]].

==History==
Founded as monastic community worshiping [[Oghma]], the village was destroyed several times until abandoned around [[1166 DR]]. Later, several adventuring bands searched the site seeking riches but were either killed or driven off by the hordes of [[troll]]s which took over the ruins. Finally, the [[warrior]] [[Kheldrivver (person)|Kheldrivver]] organized a force to deal with the trolls. 

==Notable locations==
