Kheldrivver was small hamlet at the southeastern edge of the Troll Hills.
Founded as monastic community worshiping Oghma, the village was destroyed several times until abandoned around 1166 DR. Later, several adventuring bands searched the site seeking riches but were either killed or driven off by the hordes of trolls which took over the ruins. Finally, the warrior Kheldrivver organized a force to deal with the trolls.
