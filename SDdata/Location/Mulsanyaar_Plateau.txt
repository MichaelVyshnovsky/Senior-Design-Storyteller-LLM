The '''Mulsanyaar Plateau''' was stretch of rugged terrain found in southern [[Rashemen]].

==Geography==
The plateau sat in the shadow of the [[Sunrise Mountains]] to the east. The Mulsanyaar Plateau was separated from [[Thay]] by the [[Gorge of Gauros]] and was actually just a continuation of the northernmost branch of the [[Thayan Plateau]].

==Inhabitants==
Few [[Rashemaar]] lived within this region. The [[Iron Lord]] sent regular patrols of [[Rashemaar berserkers]] to keep the number of [[goblin]]s in check.
