The Mulsanyaar Plateau was stretch of rugged terrain found in southern Rashemen.
The plateau sat in the shadow of the Sunrise Mountains to the east. The Mulsanyaar Plateau was separated from Thay by the Gorge of Gauros and was actually just a continuation of the northernmost branch of the Thayan Plateau.
Few Rashemaar lived within this region. The Iron Lord sent regular patrols of Rashemaar berserkers to keep the number of goblins in check.
