'''Tran''' was a seaport town in [[Laothan]] in [[Malatra]].{{Cite interactive atlas|C2aNElc.FCW}}

==Geography==
It lay at the mouth of the [[Phu River]] on the coast of the [[Eastern Sea]]. A trail led westward through the jungle and along the river to Laothan's capital, [[Cheinang]].

==Description==
Tran was home to a "floating city", a great conglomerate of of boats that bore houses and businesses and were all interconnected. It was nearly self-sufficient and was the heart of life here.

==Economy==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Tran received trade passing along the Phu River, between the sea and Cheinang, though it was reported to be only middling compared to [[Marabaya]] in the [[Kuong Kingdom]].

Yet lawlessness was said to be rife in Tran: almost anything could be bought, any vice could be had, and killers could be hired cheaply. These included the [[Sung (ninja clan)|Sung]] clan of [[ninja]], who operated in the floating city.
