Tran was a seaport town in Laothan in Malatra.
It lay at the mouth of the Phu River on the coast of the Eastern Sea. A trail led westward through the jungle and along the river to Laothans capital, Cheinang.
Tran was home to a "floating city", a great conglomerate of of boats that bore houses and businesses and were all interconnected. It was nearly self-sufficient and was the heart of life here.
In the mid–14 century DR, Tran received trade passing along the Phu River, between the sea and Cheinang, though it was reported to be only middling compared to Marabaya in the Kuong Kingdom.
Yet lawlessness was said to be rife in Tran almost anything could be bought, any vice could be had, and killers could be hired cheaply. These included the Sung clan of ninja, who operated in the floating city.
