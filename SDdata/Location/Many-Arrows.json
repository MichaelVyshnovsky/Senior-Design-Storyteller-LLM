        "mainbody": "he Kingdom of Many-Arrows, sometimes called the Kingdom of Dark Arrows, was an orc kingdom in the North founded by Obould Many-Arrows.\nBy the time that the kingdom fell in the late 15 century DR, it had come to be known as the homeland of orcs who valued civilization, and who found as much pride in building their own realm as in tearing down others. It was suggested that the Kingdoms success had done much to improve the reputation of orcs overall.\nMuch of Many-Arrows territory was confined to the icy and windswept mountains of the Spine of the World north of Mithral Hall. Crude signs warned visitors when they had entered the Kingdoms borders.\nMany-Arrows was a monarchy ruled by kings famous for being far more peaceful than a typical orc ruler.\nIn 1479 DR, Many-Arrows was ruled by King Obould XVII from his skull-adorned, horned throne in Dark Arrow Keep.\nThe fiercest warriors among the Many-Arrows orcs wore distinctive belts decorated with the traditional totems of the Many-Arrows tribe.\nthumb|The insignia of the Many-Arrow.|280x280px\nPrior to the founding of the Kingdom, the Many-Arrows tribe was known as the most notorious and most successful orc tribe in the North, boasting about 40,000 members as of the mid&ndash14 century DR. They operated out of the Citadel of Many Arrows until they were ousted in the , at which point they moved west to Dark Arrow Keep, which they claimed from its giant inhabitants. Although their numbers were decimated, and were widely expected to raise a horde and launch an invasion of the whole Silver Marches.\nThe Kingdom of Many-Arrows was founded in the , \nThe Obould dynasty reigned almost uninterrupted from the kingdoms founding into the late 15 century DR. Although there were some civil wars, one of which lasted a decade during which time the realm was divided, these interval conflicts had ended by the .\nThe Many-Arrows orcs were in constant conflict with the Uthgardt of the region but were ostensibly at peace with their neighbors in Luruar, and some trade did occur between the two realms. However, the relationship was rarely friendly and always tense even if open conflict was avoided save for the occasional raid. \nIn the late 1470s DR, King Obould XVII sent a vanguard to scout the ruins of Neverwinter, which had been destroyed by a cataclysm decades prior. However, the leader of this group, Vansi Bloodscar, defied her orders and instead led her troops to occupy parts of the northern half of the city, using the remains of the Cloak Tower as a base. These orcs soon fell under the sway of the Abolethic Sovereignty, and some of their leaders&mdashincluding Bloodscar herself&mdashaccepted the Sovereigntys \"blessings\" in the form of spellscars. By the , Bloodscar was effectively in open rebellion against Many-Arrows and was at war with the Neverwinter Guard.\nIn the midâ€“1480s DR, renegade shamans of Gruumsh desired a return to the old orc ways and wished to attack their neighbors instead of continuing to foster peaceful relations with them.The peace and stability of Many-Arrows fell into disarray in the , when the drow Quenthel Baenre incited the orcs into war. The orc Hartusk, a known detractor of Oboulds peaceful methodology,\nAs the War of the Silver Marches raged, Bruenor and his dwarves were able to defeat the last of Chief Hartusks forces and seized the Many-Arrows capital at Dark Arrow Keep. Thanks to the negotiation efforts of Drizzt DoUrden, the dwarves came to understand the political situation that had seen the more peaceful Lorgru dethroned. As the surviving forces of Many-Arrows rallied behind Lorgru, the restored king expressed his desire to continue his fathers legacy of peaceful integration with the people of the Silver Marches. However, Bruenor had lost faith in the ability for the orcs to coexist with the Silver Marches, and so banished Lorgru and his followers into the mountains and completely destroyed Dark Arrow Keep. By autumn of the , the Kingdom of Many-Arrows had been erased,"
