Prior to the [[Spellplague]], the '''Forest of Mir''' was a dense forest that covered the southern highlands of [[Tethyr]] and continued south over the [[Marching Mountains]] and into [[Calimshan]].

==Names==
The Forest of Mir was named after the lost elven kingdom of [[Keltormir]] and the later human [[First Kingdom of Mir]].<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/><ref name=LoI1:T-p19><ref name=LoI1:T-p22> It had many other names. In ancient times, the [[Elf|elves]] called it '''Darthiir Wood''';<ref name=TGHotR-p16/><ref name=LoI1:T-p20> in later times, they named it the '''Sarenestar'''.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/><ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/> The gnomes who lived there called it the '''Timbemerald'''.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> To the humans of [[Tethyr]] the northern part of the forest within their country was referred to as the '''Great Highland Glade''',<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> while the [[Calimshan|Calishites]] called it '''Khalahmjiri''', which was [[Alzhedo]] for "place of deadly teeth", for all the monsters that lived there.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>

==Geography==
The Forest of Mir covered the [[Marching Mountains]] north of Calimshan and spread over the land between the mountains and the trade road from [[Darromar]] to [[Saradush]]. Near Saradush, the forest bent sharply southward until it reached the [[Spider Swamp]], forming an eastern border for Calimshan.<ref name=FRCS-map> A large portion of the forest in Tethyr was considered part of the [[Mir Protectorate]].<ref name=LoI1:T-p90>

There was plenty of water in the forest.<ref name=EotS-p59> Small streams ran intermittently throughout, emptying into the Spider Swamp.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/>

The forest had hilly, rough terrain, which made passage of large groups difficult.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/> Many trails passed through the forest, so getting lost was not as great a risk as being ambushed by monsters.<ref name=EotS-p59/> Except for a few logging roads, the majority of these trails were game trails that led to ponds or streams and changed rapidly. Some of the forest inhabitants made use of treetop trails as well.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>

==Ecology==
===Flora===
The forest consisted mostly of evergreen trees, growing in dense clusters,<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> as well as some other dry-weather plants.<ref name=EotS-p52> The trees within the forest were far taller then any others found in the region, and they produced pine cones of legendary size. The trees continued south over the slopes of the Marching Mountains until an elevation of over two miles.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> Because of the hot weather of the region, the trees had roots as deep as 50 feet below the ground to reach water.<ref name=EotS-p52/>

Beneath the trees, the forest bed was covered in a thick underbrush.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/>

===Fauna===
[[Fox]]es, [[weasel]]s, small rodents like [[mice]], black and gray furred [[squirrel]]s, and small [[songbird]]s made their homes in the forest. A wide assortment of [[owl]]s lived in the northeaster regions. The southern stretches of the woods were the locale of [[panther]]s and other wild cats. Many snakes lived in the southern parts as well, especially as one moved closer to the Spider Swamp, as did a large number of wild [[boar]]s.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/> More dangerous beasts, such as [[stirge]]s, [[choke creeper]]s, [[bloodthorn]]s, and [[giant spider]]s, could also be found there.<ref name=EotS-p49/>

===Climate===
The Forest of Mir was stifling hot most of the year. The pine trees did little to cool the forest from the heat of the sun.<ref name=EotS-p52/><ref name=EotS-p48>

==Inhabitants==
The Forest of Mir has always been known as a great hive of monster races, posing continual problems for both Tethyr and Calimshan. [[Goblin]]s were the most populous inhabitants, followed closely by [[ogre]]s and [[gnoll]]s.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> Historically, various kinds of [[giant]]s lived under the trees of Mir as well,<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> though most of these lived along the northern slopes of the Marching Mountains in the west of the forest.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/> [[Hydra]]s and [[green dragon|green]] and [[black dragon]]s were uncommonly found, along with many [[Fey|sylvan]] creatures such as [[dryad]]s or [[satyr]]s.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> Near the Spider Swamp, [[aranea]] claimed a small region of territory.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>

By [[1370 DR]], there was a growing population of [[drow]] in the forest. The first rumors of this occurred in [[1346 DR]]. The original reported numbers of a population of 80,000 drow<ref name=EotS-p59/> were larger than the truth, which was that three settlements existed with a combined population of around 6,500.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> These three settlements were [[Dallnothax]], [[Iskasshyoll]], and [[Holldaybim]]. All three were located along the foothills of the Marching Mountains. More than 70% of these drow are exiles from the Underdark and worship [[Vhaeraun]] instead of [[Lolth]].<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/><ref name=LoI1:T-p91>

Some human settlements rested at the very edges of the forest, but the villagers never ventured more than a mile or two into the forest.<ref name=EotS-p59/>

The forest was home to a settlement of [[wereboar]]s in the southeast.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/> Rumors also spoke of a magically hidden elven city within the forest where [[gnome]]s, elves, and escaped slaves live in peace.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>

==Notable Locations==
; [[Argentor]] : This foothill of the eastern Marching Mountains was the site of an ancient battle between the drow and King [[Strohm III]] of Tethyr.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/> After the [[Spellplague]], it became the home of a number of [[earthsoul genasi]].<ref name=SS>
; Dallnothax : One of the three drow settlements in the forest, located north of the Marching Mountains.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>
; [[Eyesvale]] : A small glen between [[Ithal Pass]] and the town of [[Kzelter]].<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>
; [[Garados]] : A forested hamlet northwest of [[Almraiven]].{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Monster Breeding for Fun and Profit}}
; Holldaybim : One of the three drow settlements in the forest, located east of the Marching Mountains.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>
; Iskasshyoll : One of the three drow settlements in the forest, located northeast of the Marching Mountains.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>
; [[Magis Tor]] : This five-towered structure in the northeast of the forest was once home to the [[Magis Mir]], a cabal of wizard adventurers from Tethyr.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>
; [[Myth Dyraalis]] : Known as the "Phantom City of Drollus", this legendary, hidden elven city might have existed in the forest.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>
; [[Myth Unnohyr]] : This former elven stronghold was demolished during the First Kingdom of Mir and became overgrown by the trees of the forest.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/>
; [[Skyship's Glade]] : This glade, located 50 miles west of Kzelter, was once a secret landing site for [[Halruaa]]n [[spelljammer]]s. It was later used by [[Mind flayer|illithid]] slavers.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/>
; [[Uller's Hill]] : A hill within Eyevale where the [[Battle of Eyesvale]] occurred during the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]].<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>
; The [[Vorpal Tower]] : A ruined tower strangely cleaved diagonally in two by some unknown force.
; Wereboar colony : A colony of wereboars led by [[Adhavox the Render]] was found near the Spider Swamp.<ref name=EotSS-pp81-83/>

==History==
===Formation===
Originally the forest was part of the massive [[Keltormir]], which covered the whole region of what later became Tethyr,<ref name=LoI1:T-p19/> but ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-8500}} it was sundered by dragon fires into a separate forest called Darthiir Wood.<ref name=TGHotR-p16/>

During the First Kingdom of Mir, the forest shrank to its current borders, from fires caused by war with the [[beholder]]s of the [[Lake of Steam region]] ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-1550}}.<ref name=LoI1:T-p22/><ref name=EotSS-p41>

===Post Spellplague===
The Spellplague changed the trees within the forest into huge stone spires. The region became known as the [[Spires of Mir]].<ref name=SS/>

==Rumors and Legends==
It was said that the drow of the forest maintained tunnels below the forest floor the connected to their vast network of such tunnels within the [[Underdark]].<ref name=EotS-p59/>

The majority of Calim's riches were said to be hidden in an extradimensional palace located in the forest and guarded by an [[Dragon aging|ancient]] [[crystal dragon]] named [[Klaruuotur]] and several [[djinn]].<ref name=LEoF-p124>

Two [[mythal]]s remained in the Forest of Myr. The first was located in Myth Unnohyr. Less than two dozen sages had ever heard of it, and only two knew of the treasures of Keltomir it still contained.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/> The second was Myth Dyraalis. While hidden to most, in truth, the site was still a thriving town of elves and gnomes and escaped slaves. The mythal was centered in the Mother Tree, and its magic cloaked the town from discovery.<ref name=LoI1:T-p91/>

Finally, legends told of a crystal-blue pool of eternal life, the [[Wellspring Endless]], said to be found deep within the forest. If a true tale, the pool remained lost.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp53-54/>
