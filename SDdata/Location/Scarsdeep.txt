'''Scarsdeep''' was a town in [[Scardale]] that rose to prominence during the occupation of the dale by a coalition of forces during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. While in [[1356 DR]] the town was barely noticeable, by [[1370 DR]] it had become a bustling center of trade.

==Government==
Although the seat of government was located in the town of [[Chandlerscross]] after 1370 DR, Scarsdeep contributed four members to the [[Scardale Council]].

==Notable locations==
;[[Scardale Provisioner]]: This high-quality general store moved from the capital city of [[Scardale Town]] to Scarsdeep shortly after the [[second inter-dale war]].
