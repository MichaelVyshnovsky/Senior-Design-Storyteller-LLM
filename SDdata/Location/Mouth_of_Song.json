        "mainbody": "The Mouth of Song was a small shrine to Eilistraee located in the south central portion of the Moonwood, approximately a days travel north of Quaervarr.\nThe shrine was located in a cave mouth beneath a treeless hill, atop which the dark elven worshipers and a few half-elven and elven faithful from Silverymoon danced in a great ring on moonlit nights.\nThe area was frequented by followers of Eilistraee, the goodly drow goddess. The good drow (mostly females) danced and sang under the moon, and performed other ceremonies atop the hill where a small shrine to Eilistraee stood."
