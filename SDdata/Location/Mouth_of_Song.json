        "Geography": "The shrine was located in a cave mouth beneath a treeless hill, atop which the [[drow|dark elven]] worshipers and a few [[half-elf|half-elven]] and [[elf|elven]] faithful from [[Silverymoon]] danced in a great ring on moonlit nights.",
        "Inhabitants": "The area was frequented by followers of Eilistraee, the goodly drow goddess. The good drow (mostly females) danced and sang under the moon, and performed other ceremonies atop the hill where a small shrine to Eilistraee stood."
