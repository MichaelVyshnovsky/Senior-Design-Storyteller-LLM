'''Velarswood''' (also known as '''Velarwood''') was a forest near the center of [[Harrowdale]] in the [[Dalelands]].

==Notable Locations==
The north of the wood contained a temple to [[Eilistraee]], which was guarded by a number of [[drow]].

==Inhabitants==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the wood was inhabited by [[bonebat]]s, [[cloaker]]s, [[stirge]]s, and [[troll]]s, as well as more formidable creatures.

More than fifty Eilistraeeans lived and worshiped in Velarswood, both drow and other [[elves]], in the [[Shadowtop Glade]] shrine. They often gathered in evensong in gratitude. They were creating a surface home there and generally had good relations with local humans, whom they aided when ill.

There was also a number of [[werewolf|werewolves]] in the area. As a general rule, followers of Eilistraee befriended the moon-worshiping lycanthropes, and even celebrated sacred hunts in honor of Eilistraee and [[Sel√ªne]] alongside them. However, a specific group of Eilistraeeans in Velarswood was known to frequently hunt the lycanthropes, which they considered to be abominations and dangerous for the inhabitants of the area. In fact, those Eilistraeeans hung the lycanthrope heads on a trophy tree.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Uluyara]], a drow priestess of Eilistraee
* [[Feliane]], an elven priestess of Eilistraee
* [[Breen]], a drow missionary for Eilistraee
* [[Yarno]], a young werewolf living with his grandfather (also a werewolf) circa [[1373 DR]].
