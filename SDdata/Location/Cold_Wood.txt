The '''Cold Wood''' was a forest on the edge of the [[Silver Marches]].

==Geography==
It was located between the [[Spine of the World]], [[Rauvin Mountains]], and [[Ice Mountains]]. A wild place, the Cold Wood was largely untouched by civilization; most woodcutters and homesteaders avoided it.
===Flora & Fauna===
The forest was full of [[pine]], [[birch]], and [[spruce]] trees.

Animals that could be found inhabiting the Cold Woods included [[branta]]s, [[dire bat]]s, [[dire bear]]s, [[dire wolves]] and mundane [[wolves]], [[dire wolverine]]s, [[elk]], [[night hunter]]s, [[red tiger]]s, and [[sinister]]s. More fantastical and [[magical beast|magical]] creatures included [[darkenbeast]]s, [[gray render]]s, [[gulguthydra]], [[ibrandlin]], [[peryton]]s, [[phase spider]]s, [[snowcloak]]s, [[tall mouther]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[vargouille]]s, and [[worg]]s.

The Cold Wood was also haunted by a number of [[undead]] that included [[crawling claw]]s, [[dread warrior]]s, packs of [[ghast]]s and [[ghoul]]s, [[shadow]]s, [[spectre]]s, [[wight]]s, and [[wraith]]s.

==History==
Prior to [[1366 DR]],{{Giantcraft date}} a group of [[giant-killer]]s known as the [[Blood Riders]] commonly operated out of this forest.

Around [[1372 DR]], a number of [[green abishai]]

In the years following [[1486 DR]], [[fire giant]]s began moving through the eastern woods from [[Ironslag]], using their fire and [[greatsword|greatswords]] to clear wide swaths of the forest for expedited overland travel.

==Inhabitants==
Sentient creatures that were known to roam the Cold Wood included [[ettin]]s, [[orc]]s,

Around 1372 DR the Cold Wood was inhabited by an adult and clutch of [[green dragon]]s, a juvenile [[red dragon]], a juvenile [[song dragon]], a young [[gold dragon]], a young adult [[white dragon]], and two [[dracolich]]es.

[[Uthgardt]] barbarians hunted in the area, but would not cut any living tree and kept fires to a minimum to protect the forest. The [[Red Tiger Tribe]] considered the southern part of the wood their territory. Several bands of outcasts from Uthgardt society were known to live around the area as well.
