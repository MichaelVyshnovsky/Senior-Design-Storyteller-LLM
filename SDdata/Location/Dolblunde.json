        "mainbody": "'''Dolblunde''' was a [[gnome|gnomish]] city located in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Sword Coast North]]. It was abandoned as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and had become the lair of [[Daurgothoth]], a mighty [[black dragon|black]] [[dracolich]] known as the \"Creeping Doom\".",
        "Geography": "[[File:Northdark.png|thumb|left|250px|''The location of Dolblunde within the Northdark domain.'']]\nDolblunde was located in the [[Upperdark|upper]] [[Northdark]] under the hills northeast of [[Waterdeep]]. While it was deep underground, it was not as deep as many other Underdark settlements, allowing it to maintain a connection with the surface.{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}} It could be accessed via the deepest depths of [[Undermountain]] and by the so-called \"Bandit Tunnels\" from [[Maiden's Tomb Tor]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}\n\nTo the northwest of the city was a chain of caverns being slowly but surely dug out by the dracolich Daurgothoth, with the eventual goal being to create a tunnel to the surface in the [[Sword Mountains]].\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves Underdark city.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A city that neighbors Dolblunde.'']]\nThe area known as the Hanging City of Dolblunde could be reached by a path through the Underdark that began at a deep hole in the ground—known to some as \"the orifice\"—in the [[Kryptgarden Forest]], east of the Sword Mountains.The Underdark city depicted in ''Honor Among Thieves'' is unidentified. Though it closely resembles [[Gracklstugh]], of which Themberchaud was the largest resident, that city is too far away and lacks a river. The closest city is Ch'Chitl, but it bears no similarity. However, the route was patrolled by such creatures as [[intellect devourer]]s, likely from Ch'Chitl.{{speculation}}",
        "Description": "The abandoned city was a labyrinth of passageways, both gnome-built and carved by natural forces like streams. These were wide enough for two gnomes to walk abreast and just barely tall enough for a [[half-orc]] to stand in. A large and humid cavern contained a pool of water alongside which the gnomes had built a marketplace complete with stone stalls and countertops.\n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the once-inhabited parts of the city were filled with cracked stone floors, broken pottery, rusted metal, shattered crates, and the bones and skulls of gnomes.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves publicity image 7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Thieves in the Hanging City.'']]\nAnother part of the city was the '''Hanging City of Dolblunde'''. Located within a jagged chasm through which flowed a river of lava, it comprised a series of stone platforms suspended over the lava itself by thick [[chain]]s. These were linked by bridges and had structures, obelisks, and over-sized statues of [[svirfneblin]] in supplication built upon them. Over time, some of these bridges had collapsed, either naturally or due to traps that triggered them to collapse, and some chains had broken, causing parts to tip and fall into the lava, marking this as a clearly an architectural flaw.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}The 'Hanging City of Dolblunde' introduced in ''Honor Among Thieves'' is clearly very different from the Dolblunde established in earlier sourcebooks. The relationship between the two Dolblundes is unknown. Given the lack of habitable structures and the statues of monastic appearance, this may be another part of the city intended for worship or other activities. Alternatively, it is an earlier city abandoned by the gnomes, a later failed attempt by gnomes to establish a new Dolblunde elsewhere, or all that remains of Dolblunde after an undocumented collapse into lava. The apparent proximity of this Dolblunde to the Sea of Swords strongly suggests this should be a different Dolblunde. Nevertheless, they are combined in this article for  completeness. The gnomes used a stone aqueduct to carry water through this part of the city.In ''Honor Among Thieves'', Xenk believes the bone pile was not there on his last visit, implying it is Themberchaud's, but it should be noted that Daurgothoth had his own pile of bones, while Themberchaud appears to be a new arrival.",
        "Defenses": "{{quote|It's quite simple. Starting from the edge, use odd-numbered blocks only, moving forward with each step, except for every fifth step, which must be a lateral move. After which you proceed, again stepping on odd-numbered blocks only. However, at the midpoint, we switch to even-numbered blocks, following the same pattern, except now we move laterally after the fourt step, until—|Xenk explaining the sequence}}\nThe bridges to the Hanging City were protected by ancient gnomish traps that, if not traversed by stepping on the blocks marked by [[Dethek]] runes in an intricate sequence, would simply collapse into the lava below, carrying the trespassers with them. They were in fact all too easily triggered, collapsing at the first foot upon them.",
        "History": {
            "Founding and Abandonment": "The city was founded in the {{YearlinkName|232}}, by several [[rock gnome|rock]] and [[deep gnome]] clans led by [[Olbrent Handstone]]. It became the seat of a gnomish realm known as the [[Duchy of Gloraela]].\n\nDuring the reign of Duke [[Ulbrent Handstone]], Dolblunde joined the kingdom of [[Phalorm]]&mdash;the \"Realm of Three Crowns\"&mdash;when it was formed in the {{YearlinkName|523}}, alongside the humans of [[Delimbiyran]], the [[elves]] of [[Ardeep]], the [[dwarves]] of [[Dardath]], and the [[halfling]]s of [[Meiritin]]. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|612}}, the forces of Phalorm warred with the [[orc]]s of the [[Everhorde]], leaving them weakened when two more orc hordes emerged in the {{YearlinkName|614}}. The second of these hordes sacked and pillaged Dolblunde before their allies could make it to their aid. Phalorm collapsed the [[615 DR|next year]] after their forces were destroyed by [[Iniarv]] in the catastrophe that created the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. Subsequently, in the {{YearlinkName|616}}, the gnomes of Dolblunde allied with the remnants of the human portion of Phalorm, who had formed a new [[Kingdom of Man]].\n\nWhile parts of the city were left abandoned after the orc attack, The remaining gnomes abandoned the city and [[the North]]lands for a safer home.",
            "Daurgothoth's Lair": "[[File:Daurgothoth - E. M. Gist.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Daurgothoth, the Creeping Doom, probably the greatest evil the world has ever seen.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1253}}, Dolblunde became the lair of the dracolich Daurgothoth. From there, he spied on the goings on in the region from [[Zundbridge]] to [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]], including monitoring the traffic on nearby trade routes (''i.e.'', the [[High Road]], the [[Long Road]], and the River Dessarin),{{Cite dragon/234/Wyrms of the North: Daurgothoth|35}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/By Dragons Ruled and Divided}} and occasionally took indirect interest in Waterdeep itself through proxies like [[wizard]]s or the [[Zhentarim]].\n\nDuring the [[Rage of Dragons]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Daurgothoth conspired against the leader of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], [[Sammaster]], and ultimately seized power over the Cult alongside fellow dracolich [[Aurgloroasa]] and the [[lich]] [[Algashon Nathaire]]. As a member of this \"triumvirate\", Daurgothoth became known as the \"First Reader\" of the Cult, and his lair at Dolblunde became the epicenter of their arcane study and the creation of new spells and [[magic items]] based on lore gathered by the Cultists from as far away as the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] in [[Damara]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Daurgothoth struck a deal with a group of [[Selvetarm]]-worshiping [[drow]] exiles led by [[Dhairn]]. In exchange for the secrets of creating [[chitine]]s and a promise of a share of plunder from the next 600 years of drow incursions into Undermountain, the dracolich allowed them to use a ruined marketplace within Dolblunde as a base of operations from which to launch attacks against [[Lolth]]- and [[Eilistraee]]-worshiping drow. Their plan to attack the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] was discovered by an agent of [[Qilué Veladorn]] named [[Jub]] before he was slain by Daurgothoth.\n\nDaurgothoth survived the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, by hiding outside of the [[Prime Material plane|Material Plane]]. He subsequently returned to Dolblunde, from where he worked to rebuild the Cult of the Dragon.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-05-26 - Daurgothoth}}",
            "In the Hanging City": "[[File:Zuphelithid in Dolblunde.png|thumb|left|250px|''Mind flayers dominating the deep gnomes in Dolblunde.'']]\nFollowing the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] ''circa'' [[1400 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The battle is undated but is \"a century ago\" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves'', which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. the paladin [[Xenk Yendar]] retrieved the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]'' and, to keep it safe, ultimately stored the ''helmet of disjunction'' in the [[Underdark]], within the ruins of the Hanging City of Dolblunde, believing it to be \"the last place anyone who values their life would go.\" In doing so, he aided a community of deep gnomes against a band of illithids, their intellect devourers, and the [[elder brain]] [[Zuphelithid]].\n\nA century later, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Xenk led a party comprising [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Doric]] to Dolblunde to retrieve the ''helmet of disjunction''. Entering via the Kryptgarden orifice, they passed the neighboring Underdark city and uninterested intellect devourers and arrived at the ruins of Dolblunde. After negotiating the trapped collapsing bridges, that is triggering and collapsing them before Xenk could finish explaining the intricately complicated technique needed to cross them, Simon used a ''[[hither-thither staff]]'' to create ''[[portal]]s'' with which to cross into the city. Finding and opening a gnomish mechanical box, Xenk retrieved the helm. But that was when a band of [[undead]] [[Thayan]] assassins led by [[Dralas]] showed up. They fought valiantly, with Xenk handily taking down the whole squad of assassins and impressing the others, who provided a little aid but mostly just watched. But the undead did not stay dead for long; their wounds regenerated and they gave chase.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves publicity image 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The thieves surprised as Themberchaud shows up.'']]\nThen they were all interrupted by the surprise appearance of the [[red dragon]] [[Themberchaud]], far from his home, who forced his bulk through a narrow cave opening. He took care of the undead assassins, by simply eating them, but then turned his attention to the others, chasing them around the ruins and its bridges and breathing fire. At one point, unable to fly up, he pushed a bridge down, causing Edgin to slide down toward his maw—stopped only when Xenk heroically leaped overhead and thrust his sword into Themberchaud's head. Recovering, Themberchaud chased them into a narrow cave, but could not get his head through. The damage caused seawater to leak in. In the end, though, the team forced Themberchaud to breathe gas and created an explosion that would open a water channel and free them. They emerged just offshore, in the [[Sea of Swords]].<ref group=\"note\">Although Themberchaud is implied to be a new resident of Dolblunde in ''Honor Among Thieves'', this is not confirmed and his need to force his way inside indicates he did not already have an entrance."

        "Inhabitants": "After Daurgothoth had taken up residence in the former gnome city, it was mostly populated by his undead servants, notably [[skeleton]]s, [[deathfang]]s, and [[bone lurker]]s (undead [[lurker]]s of the dracolich's own devising that disguised themselves as portcullises made of bone). His main tunnel was guarded by the skeletons of a [[mountain giant]] tribe overseen by a [[death tyrant]]. \n\nDoblunde was also home to a number of [[sword spider]]s."
