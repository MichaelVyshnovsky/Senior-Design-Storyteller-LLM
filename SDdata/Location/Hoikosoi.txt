'''Hoikosoi''' was a farming village, one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].

==Description==
Hoikosoi was unique on the Peninsula for having very fertile soil, which was used to grow vegetables and raise [[cattle]].

Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.

The people of Hoikosoi were especially suspicious of strangers and refused to allow any to enter their settlement. The hamlet had a population of only about 95 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.

==Geography==
Hoikosoi was located in the south of the island of [[Tsukishima]], on the east of the Fochu Peninsula near the [[Momoben Forest]].

==Government==
Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a ''shoya'', typically a minor [[samurai]].

==Defenses==
About ten citizens of Hoikosoi served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.

==Religion==
Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Hoikosoi were not particularly religious.

==History==
Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.
