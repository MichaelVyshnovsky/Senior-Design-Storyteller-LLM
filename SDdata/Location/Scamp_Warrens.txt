The '''Scamp Warrens''' was a neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of [[Telos City]], the capital of [[Vaasa]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} It was home to members of smaller races, who were oppressed, scorned, and derogatorily called "scamps" by the ruling [[Warlock Knights]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}}

==Description==
The Scamp Warrens were home primarily to [[halflings]], [[goblins]], and [[kobolds]]. It had a reputation for its criminal element as it was the main source of contraband goods in Telos and the Warlock Knights did not police the area.

==History==
Members of smaller races were usually [[slavery|enslaved]] by the Warlock Knights of Vaasa in the late 15{{th}} century DR, and even free halflings, goblins, and kobolds were seen as lesser than serfs of larger races,{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} This led to the members of these diminutive groups banding together on the eastern outskirts of Telos and making a home for themselves where they ruled the streets.

==Notable Locations==
The Scamp Warrens contained a black market where goods outlawed by the Warlock Knights could be found. Most notably, weapons and armor made of ''[[ironfell]]'' could be bought and sold here.
