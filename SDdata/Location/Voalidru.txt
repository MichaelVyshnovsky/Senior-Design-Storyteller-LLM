'''Voalidru''' ({{Pronounce|vo|AL|id|roo|refs={{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|58}} Before the war, it was considered to be one of the grandest of merfolk cities in recorded history. After the war, Voalidru was infamous and began being referred to as the '''City of the Damned'''.

==Geography==
[[File:VoalidruSerôsMap.png|thumb|273px|''A map showing Voalidru's location in relation to the cities of Myth Nantar and Thuridru.'']]
This city stood along the upper slopes of the [[Lesser Hmur Plateau]], northeast of [[Mount Teakal]],{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|62}} The area around the city, encompassing the whole of the Lower Hmur Plateau and the southern parts of Eadraal, composed a territory separate from the nation's duchies known as the [[Voalidru Protectorate]].

==Government==
This city was the seat of power for the kings of Eadraal. However, like the other seven cities of the nation, the governance of Voalidru was overseen by a duke.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Temple of Eadro (Voalidru)|Temple of Eadro]], a massive temple dedicated to the ocean god [[Eadro]] that originally began as a simple shrine. Unlike most buildings in the city, it was constructed of sedimentary stone from the ocean floor.

==History==
The construction of the city predated the founding of Eadraal, having been part of its predecessor, the empire of [[Hmurrath]]. [[Selana|Selana the Peacemaker]] established it as Eadraal's capital in {{YearlinkConvert|805|TS}}, during the waning years of Hmurrath's collapse from the [[Tenth Serôs War]]. In the fifteen years that followed, Voalidru was the full extent of Eadraal's territory, as nation didn't incorporate some of the territory of its predecessor until after the War's end in {{YearlinkConvert|820|TS}}.

In {{YearlinkConvert|1399|TS}} the Great Arcane [[Aodk]], ruler of the [[morkoth]] nation of [[Olleth]], ordered his forces to kidnap Eadraal's queen [[Wylla]] and the princesses [[Aeda]] and [[Diera]]. With their foul [[magic]] the morkoth transformed them into monstrous forms, then unleashed them upon Voalidru as mindless attackers. Their deaths were later avenged the same year, as Eadraal launched an assault upon Olleth and slayed Aodk.

In the year [[1369 DR]],

On [[Marpenoth 6]] (Sekolsong 26), Iakhovas used magic to surround the [[Whamite Isles]] without a monstrous form of [[kelpie]], allowing him to lure the islanders to a watery death and resurrection as [[drowned one]]s. With his numbers significantly expanded by this act, Iakhovas' army began their march towards Voalidru. In addition to drowned ones his forces included [[koalinth]]s, [[lacedon]]s, and the outcast merfolk of Clan [[Kataar]], led by [[Vhaemas the Bastard]], [[sahuagin]]s, [[shark]]s, and [[giant eel]]s. The people of Voalidru managed to learn of this threat before it got close, allowing them time to evacuate and take as much of their treasures as possible.

On [[Marpenoth 14]] (Sekolsong 34), the army was finally in close range of Voalidru, beginning what would be known as the [[Battle of Voalidru]].<ref> Overwhelmed by his forces, the people of Voalidru would be forced to abandon the city, In the city's Temple of Eadro a group of [[priest]]s managed to hold off against the forces of Iakhovas for some time, using an ancient horn called the ''[[Akriloth]]'' to ward off his undead.

Noticing his undead forces retreating from it,{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|63}}

In the absence of Iakhovas, a [[kraken]] by the name of [[Qol'in'taroq]] slipped into the Temple of Eadro. He had heard the ''Akriloth'' and was drawn to it, commanded by [[Those Who Sleep Below]] to take up residence in the temple and keep the city out of the hands of the merfolk. With the help of his morkoth ally [[Vlantir]], various undead they turned to their service, and a group of sahuagin lured to his command by [[Sekolah]] they fought against the invaders. This prolonged the survival of the priests, who never discovered the kraken's presence, though they occasionally caught sight of monsters fighting amongst each other. Eventually, Qol'in'taroq managed to secure the ''Akriloth'' for himself and had it moved to a secure vault on the temple's fourth floor alongside most of the temple's valuables.
===Post-Serôs War===
Iakhovas's defeat and the end of the Twelfth Serôs War ultimately did not end Voalidru's occupation, as the remnants of his undead forces continued to linger within its walls.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|59}} As did the priests of Eadro, who spents months playing cat and mouse with the undead.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|68}} Their numbers gradually fell to the undead hordes until they were forced to make their last stand in the temple's central worship chamber under the guidance of high priest [[Jarecah]] and some [[stone golem]]s. In the end only a priest by the name of [[Narvolas]] remained.

Over the next two years the ever determined people of Eaadral would attempt every few months to reclaim Voalidru, only to be turned back by the sheer number of undead. Bands of koalinths, rogue [[ixitxachitl]]s, and merfolk of Clan Kataar would also occasionally plunder the city during this time, whilst doing their best to avoid its undead hordes, eventually looting most of its buildings.

On [[Midwinter]] (Icesong 31), [[1370 DR]], made their last major attempt to reclaim their city,

By the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, multiple forces had their eyes set upon the city and rumors surrounding the city's fate began to circulate, alleging that something horrid had taken over the city. Some claiming it was a priesthood of ixitxachitl, while others claimed that it was a kraken. It would also be around this time that the priest Narvolas finally escaped Voalidru with the help of a mermaid named [[Lurelei]], who was hiding in a secret chamber of the temple, and the pair headed northeast for Myth Nantar.

Prince Regent Mirol III, the acting ruler of Eeadral while his father [[Vhaemas]] lay in a coma, was concocting plans to militarily retake Voalidru. He saw this as a means of restoring his nation's lost pride{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|61}} [[Sharna]], ruler of Clan Kataar and its city of [[Thuridru]] following Vhaemas the Bastard's death,<ref> was in a state of waiting for the right opportunity to take Voalidru for her people out of a sense of vengeance.<ref> She maintained a vast network of spies, sympathizers, and officials that she had bribed in order to keep close tabs on Mirol III.

The ixitxachitl desired recompense against the merfolk for Mirol III's brother Vhaemas the Bastard, as he was partly responsible for the devastation Iakhovas unleashed upon the Xedran Reefs. But for similar reasons of vengeance, the Vitanar was far more focused on plotting against Thuridru. After learning of the existence of the ''Akriloth'' and recognizing its potential to eliminate the undead infestation, it allowed for a devitan by the name of [[Xulkur]] to lead an expedition to retrieve the horn, consisting of ixitxachitl and a small band of koalinths. While there they caught the mermaid Lurelei, who Narvolas left to her fate. Xulkur transformed her into an obedient [[velya]], using her knowledge to recover several lesser [[magic item]]s around the ruins and map the temple for a future assault.

===The Akriloth===
At some point during 1371 DR, a few weeks after Narvolas entered Myth Nantar, Mirol III was approached by a small [[fish]] with scintillating blue scales. It told him in a deep, resonant voice that Narvolas was in the city and held the secret to reclaiming Voalidru. Having believed him to have perished in the assault on Voalidru, Mirol III considered this a sign from Eadro and scoured Myth Nantar for the priest, eventually finding him tending to injured refugees in the [[Stadium of Tavynos]]. Narvolas told the Prince Regent of what happened at his temple and of his eventual escape. He spoke adamantly of the ''Akriloth'' being a solution to the undead infestation, that it was likely still within the temple, and advised him to search the city for [[adventurer]]s willing to retrieve it.

For two weeks Mirol III would as Narvolas advised,{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|60}} This information was quickly relayed to Sharna through her informants, who then issued a cover group in the city to ambush the adventurers.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|64}} and were scouring the temple's first two floors.

The adventurers made their way through the Temple of Eadro and its many dangers, until finally confronting and defeating Qol'in'taroq within the Grand Hall.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|75}} They then made their way back to Myth Nantar, possibly facing further attacks from Clan Kamaar or minions of Those Who Sleep Belong along the way, and bestowed the retrieved ''Akriloth'' upon Prince Regent Mirol III.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|77}} Mirol granted them honorary membership in Clan [[Homurr]] and was quick to announce his possession of the relic, hyping up the merfolk of Eadraal for a future attempt to take back Voalidru.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|84}}

==Inhabitants==
Prior to the Twelfth Serôs War, the city's population was chiefly made up of merfolk.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|72}} [[dread]]s,{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|80}} [[shadow]]s,{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|65}} merfolk zombies, zombified giant eels, and zombified sharks.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|66}}

Besides undead, a number of other [[humanoid]]s,{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|81}} and a group of aquatic [[margoyle]]s and [[kapoacinth]]s.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|74}} The most powerful of these occupiers was the kraken Qol'in'taroq, who held sway over many of the creatures within the ruined city.<ref name="dung79-p59 /><ref name="dung79-p63 />
