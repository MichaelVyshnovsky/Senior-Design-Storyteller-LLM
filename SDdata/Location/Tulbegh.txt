'''Tulbegh''' was a small coastal village in [[Sembia]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]' northwestern shores.

==Description==
Tulbegh stood on the shores where the [[Dragon Coast]] met the Sea of Fallen Stars at the base of a peninsula that protruded from the mainland immediately south of the town. Along the peninsula's shores, south from Tulbegh stood a monkish retreat, a known travel destination.

Tulbegh's waters varied in temperature from temperate to cool, and it was known for temperamental weather being blown ashore from the sea. Tulbegh was often surrounded by dark rain clouds, receiving its heavy share of precipitation.

==Geography==
Tulbegh and its closest neighbor to the northwest, the town of [[Surd]], were connected via the [[Coastwatch]], that continued moving north along the coast, reaching the town of [[Yhaunn]]. Those who traveled to Tulbegh from [[Ordulin]], moved along [[Taela's Trail]] to Surd, and from there along the Coastwatch until they reached their destination. The shoreline between Tulbegh and Yhaunn was not known for being picturesque. Still, it supported numerous tiny fishing villages and lone fishermens' houses.

==Trade==
As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, glass bottleworks in Tulbegh remained a profitable business with the [[Ampner]] family of [[Ravens Bluff]] being among the industry's major investors. However, the town's main industry and the source of food was fishing in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Lastly, Tulbegh farmers were renowned across the  Realms for their [[osquip]] [[milk]] that was mixed with a certain type of [[seaweed]] mash to make baby food.

==History==
Occasionally, Tulbegh was menaced by roving monsters. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, a group of [[scrag]]s, sea [[troll]]s, began attacking the locations along the coastline, from [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]], eventually reaching every coastal city east of it, ending at Tulbegh. The attacks lasted for several months until joined forces of soldiers, sailors, and mages culled the scags, eventually removing the threat altogether.

Around the same time, a suspicious merchant arrived in the nearby city of Surd after making stops in Yhaunn and Tulbegh. The man came selling exquisite pieces of authentic [[sahuagin]] jewelry and art, including a [[dwarf]]-sized stature. The man claimed to be on a mission to share the "beauty of the sea" with the poorer coastal communities. He was selling his art for a stunningly low price. However, soon after he left Surd, its inhabitants discovered that an angry sahuagin tribe was searching for their stolen valuables. The identity of the shady merchant remained unknown, but the coastal cities of Surd and Tulbegh offered a reward for capturing the man whose appearance was likely a magical ''[[illusion]]'' created by an [[enchanted]] [[ring]]. Some believed that this stolen jewelry sale was an intentionally malicious act aimed at stressing the relationship between [[human]] and sahuagin communities of the Dragon Reach.

==Notable Inhabitants==
*[[Elduth Yarmmaster]], the Overmaster of the [[Council of Sembia]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Ornik the Wise]], a devotee of [[Tyr]], who judged between the cities of Yhaunn and Tulbegh in the years before the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Notable Organizations==
*[[Zhentarim]] was rumored to be operating in the town of Tulbegh in the late 14{{th}} century DR. The Black Network's goals there remain a secret. However, some speculated that the group was attempting to secure a Zhen trade route.
