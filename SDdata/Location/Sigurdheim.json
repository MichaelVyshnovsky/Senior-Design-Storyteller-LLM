        "mainbody": "Sigurdheim was a Northlander village on the island of Norland.\nSigurdheim was situated in the southern area of Norland, in an area surrounded by tall pine forests. The village rests on a small lake, three miles up a narrow river flowing down from the southern Jotenhammer Mountains.\nThere were twenty longhouses within this village.\nThe people that inhabited Sigurdheim were very warlike and suspicious of strangers, keeping the Northlander culture more intact than in other areas of the Moonshae Isles. Besides Northlanders, there were a few Ffolk that lived within the village. However, outside of hunting, the two ethnic groups lived apart from each other and the Ffolk liked raiding less than their Northlander neighbors."
