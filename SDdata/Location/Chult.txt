Chult was located at the westernmost end of the Chultan peninsula, in the southern part of the Trackless Sea, off the coast of Calimshan. but following the Second Sundering it was reunited with the mainland. Regardless, Chult had always been remote and isolated owing to its tall mountains and dense jungles full of savage beasts, massive dinosaurs, and debilitating disease. Nevertheless, Chult was also a land of great riches that never failed to draw adventurers.
The humans of Chult lived in tribal communities, consisting of a dozen or so families, which moved from one area to the next when the poor soil of the largely jungle covered peninsula becomes depleted. For hunting and defense they relied on non-metallic weapons like clubs, bows and shortspears. Harder metals like iron and steel were unavailable to them, and the few brought in by outsiders were nowhere near enough to sufficiently arm any significant number of people.
The people revered the god Ubtao almost exclusively. The divine powers of Faerûn had awarded Chult to Ubtao as his sole dominion in exchange for the deitys vigilance over the threat of Dendar the Night Serpent, who lay imprisoned under the Peaks of Flame.
Magic was generally feared, and each tribal-family generally had only one wielder of arcane magic, who performed hunting ceremonies and brewed potions to aid the hunters. Despite this restriction on arcane spellcasters, the number of people with an aptitude for magic was the same as anywhere else in Faerûn. Subsequently, the Chultan attitude towards the arcane caused some arcanists to flee into the jungle to practice their art alone. Many also traveled to study in Mezro.
Aside from humans, wild dwarves, goblins, aldani, pterafolk, bullywugs, and lizardfolk also inhabited the land. Exotic creatures as chuuls, hydras, nagas, troglodytes, trolls, and wyverns existed in smaller numbers. The dominant predators of the land were the dinosaurs, who were worshiped by many of the natives as aspects of Ubtao.
"Slimes" were a present danger for travelers in Chult, namely zygoms, green slimes and yellow molds. The jungles were also home to other carnivorous vegetations, such as Chultan Throttler.
Chult was the prime destination for people who liked to hunt or collect monster skulls. These safari hunters paid good coin for exotic creatures to claim as trophies without actually having to risk their own lives.
Chult was famous for its diseases, whether fatal and merely debilitating.), jungle mists (such as blue mist fever), and parasites (such as brain flukesor throat leeches).

It was said by many that the jungles of Chult were the most dangerous places in Faerûn. The plants were intelligent predators while the predators themselves were massive and armed with huge teeth and claws. Insects bit and stung travelers almost constantly, the heat and humidity were almost unbearable and the undergrowth contained a multitude of poisonous snakes. Worst, however, was the disease that ran rampant in the area. Most things in the jungle had some sort of illness or parasite and it was very easy to catch such illnesses off them. Even the water was tainted and had to be boiled if it was to be drunk. On top of all this, the intelligent creatures that eked out an existence in the dense foliage were perfectly happy and sometimes went out of their way, to track travelers in order to hunt them down and kill them. Yuan-ti, batiri, and other species that have learned to survive in this place needed food adventurers would tend to suit that need nicely.
thumb|228x228px|One of the many dangers of Chult was the undead that infested it.
Yet those adventurers kept on coming in their droves to the Chultan jungles as rumors of endless veins of gold, huge gems and ruined empires stuffed to the brim with magic and riches kept surfacing in taverns across Faerûn and many were willing to brave the dangers of the jungle for a slice of that fabled wealth.
The Chultan jungles were home to a number of trees which were valued for timber and other uses. rubber,
The Peaks of Flame were the abode of salamanders and other creatures of fire. The peaks were also said to sit over a pair of iron doors that led to the Fugue Plane, the world of the dead. Legend had it that at the end of the world Dendar the Night Serpent would tear down these doors and break through into the world.
Chult was dominated by four major rivers the River Soshenstar and River Tiryki emptying into the Bay of Chult in the north, the River Olung emptying into Kitchers Inlet on the Shining Sea in the east, and the River Tath emptying into Jahaka Bay to the south. These rivers could flow so slowly that it was sometimes hard to discern the direction of the current, although they picked up speed wherever they thundered through narrow gorges. The river water was not generally safe to drink unless it was boiled or otherwise purified first, largely because of the risk of throat leeches. These rivers also were home to Chultan fan shrimp, giant and purple marsh crab, irrinda, kapenta, likoto, minjiriya, mkunga eels, Esmel perch, giant and striped pufferfish, quipper, red discus, Soshenstar barb,  tigershell nerite, and giant tigerfish.
In the thickest parts of the jungle lay the Valley of Lost Honor, once the last refuge of the Eshowe before they were destroyed. Legends said that all of their wealth was left behind in caves in the valley, while more sinister legends claimed the evil deity of Eshowdow, actually Shar in disguise, resided there, recruiting followers and planning revenge.
The jagged and treacherous coast of southwestern Chult created a hazard for ships, and merchants from northern Faerûn have learned to give it wide berth. Fearing not only the cliffs, sailors spoke of whirlpools, freak storms, aquatic monsters, flying dinosaurs and giant eagles. A few brave (or foolish) sought fortune to explore the caves along the coast, hoping they would lead into rich mines under the jungle.
The southern Chultan coast extended east until the Snout of Omgar, a mountainous island that marked the boundary between Chult and the coast of Samarach. The Snout was the domain of the tortle race.

* Fort Beluarian A small outpost that belonged to the Flaming Fists, a mercenary company based in Baldurs Gate. The troops would work with adventurers to promote the cause of good, and provide shelter to adventurers in dire need. In spite of this goodwill, the city had, over the Hundred Years of Chaos, been burnt to the ground twice by local inhabitants of Chult only to be rebuilt by the Baldurians. The colony was also in competition with the much larger Port Nyanzaru.
* Mezro Mezro was the largest civilized area in Chult and a holy city to the Chultan tribes. The city was generally peaceful and few people, except for outsider-adventurers, carried weapons. The city was protected by the undying baras of Ubtao and six paladin-like chosen who ruled the city. Until 1363 DR, the city was surrounded by a magical wall, preventing it from being seen and causing confusion in those who approached too closely, but after a victorious battle against the batiri goblins this protection was lowered. After this it was a safe haven for explorers battered by the harsh jungle until the Spellplague, at which point it collapsed into the earth.
* Port Nyanzaru A harbor port settled by Amnians, Port Nyanzaru was also a mighty fortress, built to withstand pirate attacks and the threats of the jungle itself. Controlled by Amn, Nyanzaru was a booming, densely populated community that brought in much wealth for its parent state.
By the late 15 century DR, tourism business was established in Chult. The citizens of Baldurs Gate who visited the jungle region claimed that it was "too humid and dangerous."
One of the most terrifying local legends of Chult involved a mysterious beast called the Uluu Thalongh. This entity was able to possess trees and plants, making their branches into violent weapons. Moreover, it could mimic the voices of previous victims. No one was ever able to discover who or what the creature actually was.
In the upper canopy of the jungles, black dragons were rumored to roost.
When Jarlaxle visited Callidae in the far north of the world, the aevendrow Vessi thought Jarlaxle had come from Chult, thereby hinting at the existence of a surface drow city&mdashbelonging to the lorendrow&mdashin the southern jungles.
