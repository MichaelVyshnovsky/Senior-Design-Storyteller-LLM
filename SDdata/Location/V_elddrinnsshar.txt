Velddrinnsshar was a drow city located on a mile wide island in the centre of the Moondeep Sea. The citys name seems to be composed of two drow words that have been given translation (Veldrin and shar meaning concealment and mind respectively) and thus the name could mean Concealed Mind or some variation there upon. 
Like most drow cities, it was dominated by the clergy of Lolth, but even her divine magic couldnt protect her subjects from the Ascomoid Plague. The last inhabitant died in 1278 DR and nothing was heard of the place until ten years later when duergar looted whatever remained.
In 1337 DR a priestess of Kiaransalee named Larynda Telenna brought with her a group of acolytes who aided her in constructing the Acropolis of Thanatos in the ruins of the city. The black marble temple attracted a thousand more of the faithful and since then, it has been used as a base from which to launch attacks on the Cult of the Goats Head, a group dedicated to Orcus that inhabited Vaasa above them. Little do the drow know, but without them, Gareth Dragonsbane may not have been able to defeat Zhengyi as readily as he did.
In 1377 DR the Darksong knight Cavatinna Xarann led an expedition to the Acropolis of Thanatos in an effort to discover the cause for the augmentation of the Faerzress. Discovering that the massive amounts of voidstone the Crones of Thanatos were accumulating was the cause, the expedition managed to erase Kiaransalees name from everyones mind and the voidstone was neutralized.All the remaining undead that populated the island and still survived after Kiaransalees disappearance were destroyed by the forces of the Promenade of the Dark Maiden.
