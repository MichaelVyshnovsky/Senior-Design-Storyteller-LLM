        "Geography": "Like the rest of Malatra, the Malatran Plateau was covered mostly by jungle. In the north west and the north east however, there were large swathes of land that didn't have significant tree cover.",
        "History": "Some of the earliest people to inhabit the land that would become the Malatran Plateau were [[Bamboo spirit folk|bamboo]] and [[river spirit folk]],{{Cite web/RPGA Living Jungle/Jungle Tales 11}}\n\nThousands of years before the [[Time of Troubles]] and before [[Abeir-Toril]] had split,{{LJ}}<ref group=\"note\">No date for the Living Jungle setting is given in any of the official material. This article assumes that it takes place around the time of the second and third editions, based on the time period when the material was released. a faction of a [[humanoid]] race known as the [[Nubari (ancient)|ancient Nubari]] had come on [[spelljammer]]s in retreat from war in another [[crystal sphere]], seeking a new place to call home. Viewing the central jungle of Maltra as undesirable to the natives, they used their magic to raise the ground and create the vast Malatran Plateau. Unbeknownst to them, this caused the underground homes of nearby [[korobokuru]] to collapse, forcing them above ground.\n\n[[File:AncientNubariRuins.png|thumb|273px|''Overgrown ruins and magical domes of the ancient Nubari civilization.'']]\nVowing not to repeat the mistakes of their ancestors, they swore to create a society without war{{Cite web/RPGA Living Jungle/Jungle Tales 11}} Thus these groups lived in harmony as the ancient Nubari worked to create a new utopia free of strife. The ancient Nubari built a long chain of [[magic]]al domes around their territory, which generated a effect similar to the ''[[hallucinatory terrain]]'' [[spell]], but with [[permanency]] and on a massive scale. They also wove powerful and permanent variations of the ''[[antipathy]]'' spell into the domes. Altogether this ensured that the plateau, as well as the domes that made this effect, would go unnoticed by the people below.{{Cite polyhedron/102/The Living Jungle}}\n\nWhen [[garuda]] began decimiating the plateau's [[gorilla]] population, the ancient Nubari felt sorry for the creatures and decided to make them smarter. Giving them the capability of speech and the knowledge of making tools. When the garuda were eventually banished from the land, the ancients would go on to offer many saru jobs as laborers.\n\nEventually some disaster, whose exact details were unrecorded by history, struck the ancient Nubari and destroyed their civilization. Most of their buildings, culture, and knowledge was lost in this disaster.{{Cite polyhedron/129/Jungle Tales|17}} The surviving ancient Nubari would flee what was left of their homes, taking up life in the plateau's jungles and plains.\n\nYears following the destruction of the ancient Nubari's civilization, some native Malatrans discovered the plateau. During this period the carnivorous [[dinosaur]]s that inhabited the jungles surrounding the plateau were experiencing a severe decline in population. These natives &mdash; consisting of humans, [[katanga]]s, and korobokurus &mdash; somehow managed to ascend the vast plateau and overcome its magical barriers.{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|8}}\n\nThose humans would intermingle with the ancient Nubari and over the course of thousands of years they descended into the modern [[Nubari]].{{Cite polyhedron/129/More Living Jungle Races|35}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"scro\">Though [[scro]] were not specifically named in their entry, the description and background of oscray heavily mirrors them.

        "Notable Features": "* [[Fire Mountain]]: The southernmost peak of the plateaus central mountain range was an active volcano. Many legends had grown up around the mount and several tribes based their primitive religions on it.\n* [[Rayana Savanna]]: One of the two great plains of the plateau. An area of rolling grasslands and plentiful watering holes where [[elephant]]s, [[gazelle]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[zebra]]s could be found. Nubari plainsmen had tilled a few fields where the jungle met the grass and the [[aarakocra]] maintained all of their low-land villages in the middle of the savanna.\n* [[Valley of Spirits]]: Where the [[River of Laughing Idols]] fell from a high cliff was the beginning of this valley which widened out until it reached the [[Himsala Mountains]] at the south east edge of the Plateau. Constantly shrouded in mist from the waterfall, the Valley was mysterious and the greatest of Nubari taboo places. Alien screams filled the air and those few who returned from the valley always refused to speak of what they saw and never again ventured back.\n* [[Yaku Plains]]: Also known as the Plains of Ash, was the second great plain of the plateau. It was once a hilly savannah populated with Nubari, until one day a great fire blasted it into a wasteland covered in grey ash and husks of trees. When and how this fire occurred is unknown to the Nubari. Vegetation failed to grow here despite being surrounded on all sides by thick jungle and many cultures viewed this land as taboo. Aspiring witch doctors and [[shaman]]s among the Nubari were often brought here by their instructors to be told a vague lesson about the foolishness of man."
