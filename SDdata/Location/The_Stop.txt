The Stop was a farming village and renowned caravan stop between Hillsfar and Yûlash in the late 15 century DR.
The cosmopolitan village was surrounded by several farms.
Many refugees from Phlan flocked to the hamlet following the Mulmaster food shortages. Only a few of the Red Plumes guard of Hillsfar ventured close to The Stop, and thus it was a frequent location for brigands to ply their trade. In this region, it was the most common place adventurers were found, after Elventree.
