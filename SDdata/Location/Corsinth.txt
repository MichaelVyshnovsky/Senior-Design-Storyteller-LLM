The isle of Corsinth was an island in the Crowded Sea of Zakhara. Around 1367 DR, it was used by the great Sinbar as a place to train and test pupils on their way to become corsairs worthy of the title.
Aside from Sinbar and his corsairs-in-training, miniature earth and fire elementals could be found in the testing grounds.
The Corsairs Testing Grounds were the prominent feature of the island. This labyrinth contained many obstacles, dangerous traps and aggressive miniature elementals, as well as a teleporting field that followed any trainee. It transported those lacking in swiftness back to the entry point. The Testing Grounds were constructed by Sinbar, who only considered his pupils ready to leave the isle as true corsairs if they were able to reach the labyrinths end. There, a stationary teleport field allowed Sinbar to send the successful off the island.
In 1367 DR, the son of Al-Hazrad finished Sinbars training on Corsinth, completed the run through the Corsairs Testing Grounds, and was sent back to his home-town of Zaratan.
