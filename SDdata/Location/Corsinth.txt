The '''isle of Corsinth''' was an island in the [[Crowded Sea]] of [[Zakhara]]. Around [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} it was used by the great [[Sinbar]] as a place to train and test pupils on their way to become [[corsair (kit)|corsairs]] worthy of the title.

==Inhabitants==
Aside from Sinbar and his corsairs-in-training, [[Miniature earth elemental|miniature earth]] and [[Miniature fire elemental|fire elementals]] could be found in the testing grounds.

==Corsair's Testing Grounds==
The Corsair's Testing Grounds were the prominent feature of the island. This labyrinth contained many obstacles, dangerous traps and aggressive [[miniature elemental]]s, as well as a [[Teleport|teleporting field]] that followed any trainee. It transported those lacking in swiftness back to the entry point. The Testing Grounds were constructed by Sinbar, who only considered his pupils ready to leave the isle as true corsairs if they were able to reach the labyrinth's end. There, a stationary teleport field allowed Sinbar to send the successful off the island.

==History==
In 1367 DR,{{AQ-time}} the [[son of Al-Hazrad]] finished Sinbar's training on Corsinth, completed the run through the Corsair's Testing Grounds, and was sent back to his home-town of [[Zaratan (town)|Zaratan]].
