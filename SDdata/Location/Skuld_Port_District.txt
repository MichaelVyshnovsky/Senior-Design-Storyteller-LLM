The Port District was a walled section of the capital city of Skuld in Mulhorand during the mid–14 century DR.
The Port District was situated in the northwest corner of Skuld. It was bordered on the west by the Alamber Sea. 
Aside from the docks, access to the Port District was achieved by a single gate along the southern wall that connected to the Merchant District. 
The Port District handled all incoming and outgoing commerical vessels trading wares in Skuld.
