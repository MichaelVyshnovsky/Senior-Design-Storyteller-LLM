        "mainbody": "Dynloch Pass was a pass through the Synnorian Mountains in central Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles, connecting Myrloch Vale to the main body of Corwell. It exited the mountains on the south side near Freemans Down. It was close to, and might join into, Synnoria.\nIt lay very high in the mountains, and its approaches were winding and hidden, making it little-known to all but the local druids, dwarves, and Llewyrr elves.\nThe pass and the lands around were once tended by the druid Gwendolynn, but she was killed in the  by Trahern while he was laying a trail for the invading Northmen.\nThe pass was subsequently used by Grunnarch the Red, the Bloodriders, and accompanying Northmen and firbolg armies in an attempt to split Corwell in two and intercept refugees fleeing from eastern villages. It took them two days to traverse the pass."
