        "Geography": "This [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|duchy]] contained a large portion of the [[Forest of Mir]] in its southern portions. It was bordered by the [[Omlarandin Mountains]] in the east and the [[River Ith]] in the north. It neighbored County [[Monteshi]] of [[Ankaram]] to the west. The [[Ithal Road]] passed through the duchy.\n\nSuretmarch contained three counties: [[Alonmarch]], [[Surkazar]], and [[Mirkazar]].",
        "Government": "In [[1370 DR]], the [[Lord Just Chancellor]], Duke [[Tardeth Llanistaph]], former hero of the [[Company of Eight]], controlled Suretmarch officially from his ducal seat at [[Veaddakar]], but that manor was under reconstruction during that year, so the duke spent most of his time at [[Faerntarn]] or in [[Saradush]].",

            "[[Barakmordin]]": "This fortress-abbey dedicated to [[The Triad]] guarded the fork at the end of the Ithal Road.",
            "The Forest of Mir": "This dangerous forest was full of monsters and was the border between Calimshan and Tethyr.",
            "[[Ithal Pass]]": "This fortified town was the last point of defense against [[Teldorn Darkhope]] after that Dark Tyrant sacked the nearby city of [[Kzelter]] in 1370 DR.",
            "Kzelter": "This town was famous for falling to the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]] in 1370 DR."
