        "Description": {
            "Gates": "The Gate to Carceri was constructed of black razorvine. It was an arch with four pillars, with portals located within the center of each arch. The Gate led directly to [[Othrys]], the first layer of Carceri, and so it saw little use."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The residents of this gate-town, mostly [[human]], [[githzerai]], and creatures from the Lower Planes, were primarily exiles or refugees from elsewhere. Much of their time was spent plotting revenge against those who wronged them and attempting to form militias to enact their revenge, but only after conquering Curst itself, of course. This often resulted in large-scale conflicts within the gate-town. \n\nThe gate-town's wall was patrolled by the Wall Watch. Their primary goal was to make it as difficult as possible for an individual to leave Curst."
