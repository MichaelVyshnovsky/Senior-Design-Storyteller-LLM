The '''Thunder Cliffs''' formed a steep coast on the [[Sea of Swords]]. Locals named the Thunder Cliffs after the sound the sea made as it crashed into this high cliff.

==Geography==
The Cliffs were located on the [[Sword Coast North]] midway between the [[Mere of Dead Men]] and the city of [[Neverwinter]], just north of the [[Tower of Storms]].

==Description==
A group of [[manticore]]s lived on perches in the cliff face, as well as an [[invisible stalker]] summoned by the [[Cult of Talos]]. A huge [[giant crab]] lived underwater near the shore. At the base of the Thunder Cliffs was a cave system, the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]]. The caverns were only accessible by sea.

==History==
Pirates, smugglers and legitimate sailors used to gather in the Thunder Cliff Caves to weather out coastal storms.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Cult of [[Talos]] chose the Thunder Cliffs as a center of operations in the region. The anchorites of Talos led by [[Gadrille|Gadrille the Reef-Reaver]] utilized magic to create perilous reefs in the region, which would destroy passing ships. The cultists kidnapped the crews, either sacrificing them to Talos or selling them as slaves. The debris was dragged into the caves and anything of value was salvaged and sold. The cult of Talos used the wealth gained from this heinous endeavor to finance agents along the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[High Road]] who tried to build shrines that would ultimately give the cult control of the region.

''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Thunder Cliff Caves were attacked from sea by a group of [[adventurers]]. They defeated Gadrille and her Talos cultists, putting an end to her operation.
