The Tannath Mountains were the southern part of the Dragonjaw Mountains, starting south of the River Umber. They were recognized as a territory belonging to Aglarond, and formed its border with Thay to the east.
The craggy range was made of rugged, tall mountains of fault block origin. Wide passes flanked them on both sides, the Tannath Gap on the west and the Shyvar Pass on the east.
Griffons were known to dwell in the range. There were also birds and mountain goats. The slopes of the range were very bare.
The Tannath Mountains were considered part of Aglarond.
Silver was mined out of the mountains at some point before .
The region served as a buffer between Aglarond and Thay, making for an obstacle which Thayan armies found almost impassable
During Brindors reign, in 1369, he built the citadel Glarondar and the Watchwall with the aid of the local galeb duhr in .
In , Captain Arol of the Watchwall forces tried to cut a deal with local goblins in order to get them to provide advance warning of any threats heading their way.
There were rumors in  that goblins had settled in the silver mines.
The Watchwall led from the mountains towards Glarondar in the Yuirwood.
The zone was not inhabited by humanoids in , the peaks having never been settled and stone giants were known to dwell there. Galeb duhr populated the mountains since before .
