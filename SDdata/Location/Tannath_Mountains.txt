The '''Tannath Mountains''' were the southern part of the [[Dragonjaw Mountains]], starting south of the [[River Umber]]. They were recognized as a territory belonging to [[Aglarond]], and formed its border with [[Thay]] to the east.

==Geography==
The craggy range was made of rugged, tall mountains of fault block origin. Wide passes flanked them on both sides, the [[Tannath Gap]] on the west and the [[Shyvar Pass]] on the east.

===Flora & Fauna===
[[Griffon]]s were known to dwell in the range. There were also birds and [[mountain goat]]s. The slopes of the range were very bare.

==Government==
The Tannath Mountains were considered part of Aglarond.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|96}}

==Trade==
[[Silver]] was mined out of the mountains at some point before {{yearlink|1479}}.

==Defenses==
The region served as a buffer between Aglarond and Thay, making for an obstacle which Thayan armies found almost impassable{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|124}}

==History==
During [[Brindor]]'s reign, in [[1369]], he built the citadel Glarondar and the [[Watchwall]] with the aid of the local [[galeb duhr]]{{cite book/Spellbound/Campaign Guide|48}} in {{yearlink|1085}}.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|118}}

In {{yearlink|1479}}, Captain [[Arol]] of the Watchwall forces tried to cut a deal with local [[goblin]]s in order to get them to provide advance warning of any threats heading their way.

==Rumors & Legends==
There were rumors in {{yearlink|1479}} that goblins had settled in the silver mines.

==Notable Locations==
The Watchwall led from the mountains towards Glarondar in the [[Yuirwood]].{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|89}}
