Barakmordin, or the Shielding Mountains, was an abbey in Tethyr dedicated to the Triad Torm, Ilmater, and Tyr.
It was located at an intersection of the Ithal Road, right where it split to lead either to Ithal Pass or Saradush.
The abbey had three corner towers, each one with a temple dedicated to one of its three deities. The other buildings of the abbey, including the central keep, were devoted to the collective worship of the Triad.
Barakmordin was founded in the Year of Ten Atonements, 839 DR, during the reign of King Samyte of Tethyr. The original incarnation of the abbey was a shrine for Torm, with partial fortifications and a garrison. The abbey was partially destroyed in the Year of the Ogre, 909 DR by a goblin horde from the Omlarandin Mountains. When the abbey was reconstructed, the three distinctive corner towers were added. A shrine to Ilmater was added in the Year of the Spawning, 1070 DR, as thanks for the Tormish abbeys loyalty to the Lions Dynasty during a period of political turmoil. Further donations were made by King Alemander I, who funded the construction of outer walls and a large, central keep. A group of Tyrran paladins aided the abbey during a monster attack, proving their orders worth. In the Year of the Lean Purse, 1198 DR,Lands of Intrigue Tethyr (p. 90) erroneously claims that this event occurred in "the Year of Three Faces, 1198 DR". 1198 DR is the Year of the Lean Purse 1089 DR is the Year of Three Faces. It is unclear which year is intended. the abbey became dedicated to the Triad as a whole.
The Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin, an organization of holy warriors devoted to the Triad, were based out of Barakmordin.
