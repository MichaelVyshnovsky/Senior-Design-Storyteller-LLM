The Two-Form Glacier was a large glacier locked within the peaks of an unknown mountain range near the monastery of Fatula Chupa in what was once the Kingdom of Guge.
The glacier covered roughly  within the mountain range. Several small tributaries fed by glacial runoff flowed onto the plains from the north and northeastern portions of the glacier.
