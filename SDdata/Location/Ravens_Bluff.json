        "mainbody": "'''Ravens Bluff''', also known as the '''Living City''', was a port metropolis in the nation of [[Vesperin]], located at the mouth of the [[Fire River]] on the eastern shores of the [[Dragon Reach]], in the [[North Faerûn|northern]] region known as the [[Vast]]. Home to a great many adventurers and merchants, the citizens of Ravens Bluff came from all across [[Faerûn]] and represented nearly every race of the civilized lands. As diverse as its populace was, the interests of the collective city were focused between the mercantile nation of [[Sembia]] to the southwest and [[Mulmaster]] to the northwest. The power balance and political atmosphere of the Bluff was shaped by power groups such as the [[Zhentarim]], the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and the [[Westgate|Lords of Westgate]].\n\nDuring the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Ravens Bluff was a rapidly-growing, young city, rife with opportunities for adventure to be found, intrigue to be unraveled and riches to be earned. A beacon of civilization in an uncivilized land, it appealed to the local aristocracy just as much as it did to \"frontier folk\" looking for new opportunities in life. This reputation carried on into the 15{{th}} century, as Ravens Bluff eclipsed [[Calaunt]] both in size and attraction for those travelers passing through the northern lands.",
        "Society": {
            "Recreation": {
                "Game of Masks": "The Game of Masks was a continuous, ongoing treasure hunt that consisted of several intertwined story threads, linked together by both real-life and \"hosted\" events that sprang up throughout the city. The whole thing was sponsored by anonymous members of the local [[Church of Tempus|churches of Tempus]] and [[Church of Tymora|Tymora]]. \n\nIn the Game of Masks, players discovered clues at specific locations throughout the city, which were usually presented at the end of a puzzle or riddle. Such clues would lead them to predetermined events, such as revels thrown by the city's nobility, where they followed further leads through a series of challenges,  including mysteries-to-be-solved, mock battles and even \"crimes\" that were arranged to pop up in the city. When someone overcame a challenge, they collected oversized, decorated playing cards, called ''\"masks\"'', as proof of their cunning and accomplishment."
            },
            "Art and Culture": "As the city of Ravens Bluff was quite wealthy, its more affluent citizens often had enough leisure time to pursue creative outlets such as painting, smithing or sculpting. There were few artists within the city who were skilled enough to attract the patronage required to earn a living by their creations. While there were a number of nobles who regularly bought works of art, they were typically created on commission by their favorite artists. The public gallery of [[Ambrose Pislewaite]] was located at the [[Arts Haven]] building, within the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]], along with [[Brond Carlow|Brond Carlow's]] music store and the \"Poet's Corner\" of [[Bartleby Quilling]].\n\nThe city had several venues where Ravenians could enjoy public performances. The [[Ravens Bluff Playhouse|playhouse]], which was run by the [[Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists|Fellowship of Bards]], brought in performers from all across Faerûn. Thanks to their more affordable seats, the playhouse was extremely popular among the citizenry, even the less well off and poor. For the more cultured citizens, the [[Stone Opera House|opera house]] offered seasonal showings and abstract musical concerts, though they were significantly less popular. \n\nA vast personal library was the ultimate sign of stature and class in Ravens Bluff.",
            "Education": "The level of education varied greatly amongst the citizens of Ravens Bluff. Very few of the poorer Ravenians were literate, their children received nothing in the way of a real education, had few opportunities and were typically expected to learn the family trade or craft. On some rare occasions, families of little means could save their meager earnings together to see off one of their children to apprentice under a merchant or artisan. More commonly, children of the poor sought the risks of the adventuring life over toil, in order to improve their standing in the world.\n\nFamilies of means would begin children's education at the age of eight years, either at home under the tutelage of personal instructors, or at the family's local house of worship under the learned men and women of faith. This latter opportunity was afforded to well-off families by the efforts of the Ravenian [[Clerical Cirle]]. Subjects of study included reading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography of Faerûn and the fundamentals of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]. After the age of twelve, young men and women began their apprenticeships in a trade related to their family's business, or those of their close allies. If any Ravenian youth who demonstrated an aptitude for the [[arcane]] arts, the [[Wizards Guild (Ravens Bluff)|wizards guild]] took in apprentices from among the families who could afford the steep tuition.",
            "Magic": "It seemed to the casual observer that [[arcane]] [[magic]] took a prevalent role in the daily life of the people of Ravens Bluff,\n\nDuring the late 14{{th}} century DR, some folk born within the city's walls, began demonstrating the ability to release blasts of pure [[arcane]] energy during instances of extreme stress. This feat, which bathed them in a green-and-white, flame-like aura, came to be known as [[wildfire]] by the local guild [[wizard]]s. Some believed this phenomenon to be the effect of an ancient wild [[mythal]] surrounding a [[drow]] stronghold built under the mouth of the Fire River thousands of years before the dwarves of [[Sarbreen]] called the land home.",
            "Religion": {
                "Clerical Circle": "This spiritual council maintained a peaceful balance between the faiths of Raven Bluff's civic religion, comprised of representatives from each of its ten sponsored temples. They advocated for their collective faith, administered punishment to criminal clergy members (by means of the [[Ecclesiastical Court]]) and oversaw construction of temples found within the city, as well as those erected within a day's travel outside its walls. Circle assemblies were led by the [[Chief Prelate]], a posted elected from among the council's representatives. The appointment of individual council members was a decision left to each individual civic church."
            }
        },
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Population": "Ravens Bluff was populated in large part by travelers, wanderers, and vagabonds. In the year [[1350 DR]], the population was around 17,000 with about 3,000 of them being adventurers. The city exploded in growth over the next two decades. By [[1370 DR]], the year-round population of Ravenian citizens was around 30,000, with another 10,000 if all the foreign passers-by were taken into account. Almost 2,500 of them took up the adventuring life.",
            "Merchants": "{{Main|Merchant houses of Ravens Bluff}}\nThe success and rapid growth of wealth in Ravens Bluff during the mid-14{{th}} century DR was due in large part to the city's merchant class. Despite their longstanding contributions to the Ravenian economy, the merchant clans have had a murky history in the Bluff. Merchant collectives in years prior would emerge overnight, argue amongst themselves an with representatives of the city, and perpetuated volatile trading environments. These conflicts often led to tension with the entrenched power structures within the city, such as the guilds and civic employees, and even led to open violence in the streets.\n\nAs laws regarding mercantilism were entered into the city codex under Mayor O'Kane, the collectives evolved into government-sanctioned \"merchant houses\". With an oversight committee in the [[Merchants Council]], and accompanying representation on the authoritative Council of Lords, these trade groups began conducting themselves in a manner more befitting a well-recognized economic power of Ravens Bluff. As an organization of consequence, the united merchant houses earned the love and admiration of the Ravenian citizenry with generous donations of food, clothing and raw materials, particularly during the war of 1370 DR.\n\nWhile they may have continued old disagreements, especially those surrounding taxes and tariffs, they maintained lines of communication, a feat that was not always so easily accomplished.",
            "Nobility": {
                "Titles": "Knight/Ladyknight - addressed as ''\"Sir\"'' or ''\"Maer\"'' <br />\nCalagard/Calagarth - addressed as ''\"High Sir\"'' or ''\"High Maer\"'' <br />\nBaron/Baroness - addressed as ''\"Urgrave\"'' or ''\"Urgrava\"'' <br />\nExalted - addressed as ''\"Saer\"'' or ''\"Saeress\"'' <br />\nLord/Lady - addressed as the same"
            },
            "Lords": {
                "Life Lords": "These titles of lordship were bestowed upon those who performed a significant service to the city and were considered non-hereditary. However, Life Lords could \"improve\" their title with a significant payment to the city (upwards of 2,000,000 [[gp]]), following approval of the Council of Lords, Advisory Council, and Council of Merchants. \n\nIn [[1370 DR]], in the aftermath of the war, 15 adventurers were ennobled as Life Lords. These so-called \"Fort Lords\" were given the opportunity to purchase keeps and outposts that had been built as part of the war effort. They retained their titles and authority over their holds so long as they maintained the surrounding lands, kept their vassals safe, and paid their tax to the Ravenian government."
            }
        },
        "Economy": {
            "Trade": "All factors considered, Ravens Bluff owed a large part of its success and wealth to trade outside the city. Large trading groups, the 16 [[:Category:Merchant houses of Ravens Bluff|Merchant Houses]], managed the laborious task of managing goods in and out of the city, which long served as the basis for the Ravenian economy.\n\nThese houses grew from small consortiums, which were often dysfunctional and constantly argued amongst themselves. During the late 14{{th}} century, the houses formed the [[Merchants Council (Ravens Bluff)|Merchants Council]], a regulatory and advisory body that held significant power in the city's economy.",
            "Farming, fishing and hunting": "Outside the walls of Ravens Bluff were vast farmlands stretching out eastward. While they may not have been as well-off as Ravenians within the city's walls, they were well-enough taken care of to stay content, and produce enough low-cost food for their city-folk brethren. Although much of the farmlands were ravaged in the war of [[1370 DR]], a large influx of [[halfling]] settlers from the south prevented the collapse of local agriculture.",
            "Slavery": "While the keeping or sale of slaves was illegal within the city, some unscrupulous [[Sembia]]n merchants and pirates found ways to circumvent the law. They would sell exotic pets, such as albino [[peacock]]s and tailless [[sundcat]]s, to Ravenian lords or wealthy merchants, along with \"a keeper\" who was in fact a slave. This practice was forcefully put to a stop by Mayor O'Kane in the first years of his tenure, with strict enforcement of anti-slavery laws by the city's [[paladin]]s of [[Tyr]] and an official decree that anyone considered a slave would be granted indentured servitude in accordance with the house they served, and credited for the time they had already spent in bondage."
        },
        "Government": {
            "Lord Mayor": "Under the inaugural term of Mayor O'Kane, the office of Lord Mayor was defined in relation to the city's civic offices. The mayor of Ravens Bluff soon become the face of the city, as he was its most visible and active representative. As one of his first actions was to call a meeting of the Council of Lords, the position quickly became responsible for presenting policy options to the city legislators. Among the other duties of the mayor were daily declarations and decrees regarding city operations, the organization of its defenses and the establishment and promotion of its foreign policies with other nations. To limit their power, the Lord Mayor had no control over who kept a seat on the Lords' Council.\n\nThe Lord Mayor was supported by an appointed [[Deputy Mayor (Ravens Bluff)|Deputy Mayor]], who managed their superior's schedule, condensed and presented them with reports from throughout the city and, if it was needed, filled in as acting-mayor in their absence.",
            "[[Council of Lords (Ravens Bluff)|Council of Lords]]": "One of the oldest government bodies within the city of Ravens Bluff, the Council of Lords was responsible for legislation and policy-making. The Council was comprised of leaders from among the city's lordships families (who were guaranteed a seat), select other noble houses, as well as various civic officers including the [[Lord Chancellor (Ravens Bluff)|Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Magistrate (Ravens Bluff)|Lord Magistrate]], [[Lord Marshal (Ravens Bluff)|Lord Marshal]], the Lord Speaker of the [[Advisory Council]], and lastly the [[Chief Prelate]] and First Seat from the [[Ministry of Art]]. They were led by a Lord Speaker, who was elected from among their ranks.",
            "[[City Courts of Ravens Bluff|City Courts]]": "The judicial system of Ravens Bluff consisted of six district courts, each led by a local magistrate, as well as the High Court located in [[City Hall (Ravens Bluff)|City Hall]], which was presided over by the four High Magistrates and the highest authority, the [[Lord Magistrate]]. The lesser courts provided \"low justice\" for crimes committed within their respective districts, such as killing a transient or criminal. \"High justice\" was dealt to offenders who committed crimes that attracted attention from the city's more esteemed citizens, such as stealing from a noble or city official. Other high crimes included those that were particularly heinous or directed against the city of Ravens Bluff itself, such as piracy, rape, high murder or treason.\n\nThe High Court had the authority to pull cases away from the district courts, while the Lord Magistrate would only hear the most consequential cases.",
            "Other Councils": {
                "[[Advisory Council]]": ":This group of advisers were comprised of 20-30 retired officials, nobles, council members or government appointees, who regularly met to debate issues that arose in the city and offer their advice to the Council of Lords, Merchants Council or Lord Mayor. Although they held no official power, they were held in high regard and carried much prestige within the city. Their Lord Speaker, who was elected from among their numbers, held a seat on the Lords Council.",
                "Merchants Council": ":The Merchants Council was formed in direct response to the self-formed merchant collectives, groups of allied merchants that increased their collective economic sway within the city, by whose dealings devolved into shady back-room deals and even violent assaults in the city streets. Three particularly unscrupulous traders were ousted from Ravens Bluff after these eruptions, and the city recognized certain collectives as official \"merchant houses\", and decided upon a set of rules and regulations, by which the merchants would conduct themselves.\n\nThere were sixteen seats on the council, each of which was filled by specific members from each [[Merchant houses of Ravens Bluff|merchant house]] of the city.",
                "Ministry of Art": ":Similar to how the Clerical Circle handled all matters related to faith, religious groups and [[divine magic]] within Ravens Bluff, the Ministry would offer their recommendations and opinions to the Lord Mayor and Lords Council on everything [[arcane]] within and throughout the city. Though they were primarily a group that offered guidance and wisdom, they were known to take matters into their own hands when so required. There were 14 seats on the council, one for each of the eight [[schools of magic]], one for each of the four [[element]]s, one to represent practitioners of [[wild magic]] and a last post for generalist [[mage]]s, unaligned with a specific school or field of study."

                "Lord Marshal": ":Empowered with the full authority of the Ravenian armed forces, the Lord Marshal defended the city of Ravens Bluff from all threats, domestic and foreign. They were the highest authority of command for the city's army and navy, its specialty forces (such as the [[Nightwatch]]), and its knightly orders, when they so needed to be rallied. The Lord was supported by a [[Field Marshal (Ravens Bluff)|Field Marshal]], who led the military on the field of battle and the city's [[Chief Constable (Ravens Bluff)|Chief Constable]], who handled the daily operations of the City Watch.",
                "Lord Chancellor": ":This office was implemented in the mid&mdash;14{{th}} century DR, at the behest of Mayor O'Kane to stabilize the city's fluctuating economy. In addition to managing the economic departments of the city, the harbor, customs, treasury and guilds, they were responsible for handling foreign policy, under the Lord Mayor. \n\nUnder the Chancellery were several Regents, who ran the day-to-day operations of these departments.\n*[[Regent of City Works]]: This post lacked the glamour of other appointed offices within Ravens Bluff, though it was equally as important. They were in charge of the city's sanitation, water supply, building inspection, cemetery, the heraldry office (doubling as the city's \"Ravencoat\") as well as maintaining its municipal records (including births, indentured services, purchases, financial loans, tenancy contracts, mortgages and property deeds).\n*[[Regent of the Exchequer]]: Supported by a small army of clerks and tax collectors, this officer was charged with the daily economic function of Ravens Bluff. They oversaw the security of the treasury and city vaults, regulated and minted currency (including the amount of precious metals included therein), prevented and the stamped out counterfeiting efforts, issued licenses to bank and moneylenders and collected taxes from the Ravenian citizenry.\n*[[Regent of the Harbor]]: The Regent of the Harbor oversaw all dock operations which had been approved by the Council. These duties included operating the city's [[Ladyrock lighthouse|lighthouse]] on [[Ladyrock Neighborhood|Ladyrock Island]], inspecting, handling and potentially disposing of (hazardous) cargo from incoming vessels, patrolling the harbor and fighting off any attempts to engage in piracy or smuggling.\n* [[Regent of Guilds]]: One of the busiest, most difficult posts within Ravens Bluff, this civic officer acted as an intermediary between the government and the multitude of guilds located throughout the city."

            "Aftermath": "The years following the war were a time of healing and growth for the city. Lord Mayor O Kane had been captured for nine months and tortured to the brink of near madness and his deputy was found to be a traitor, convicted of treason and left to rot in the prison of Ill-Water. The heads of a number of powerful groups, like [[Rupert Hangman]] of the Clerical Circle had died in the conflict and the city was without strong central leadership.\n\nAs consternation surrounding the growing conflicts grew around the city, the first joint meeting of the Council of Lords and newly-created Merchants Council was held. Opposing factions formed around each group, denouncing the others' authority, and negotiations rapidly broke down. Council members were cajoled, bribed or otherwise enticed to remain in talks but only two major points were agreed upon at the meeting. First, a new election was needed to establish a single leader among the city's myriad of councils and interest groups. Second, Ravens Bluff was in desperate need of funds to rebuild the damage throughout the city and beyond.\n\nThe rather unconventional election was be determined, by the amount of gold each candidate could raise from various institutions throughout the city. The victor was decided; with significant support from the increasingly-influential merchant houses, Lady Mayor [[Amber Lynn Thoden]] became the next executive authority within Ravens Bluff. She made few changes within her first months in office.\n\nDuring the early days of [[1372 DR]], Lady Mayor Amber Lynne Thoden was revealed to be Myrkyssa Jelan in disguise by a group of adventurers. During the the resulting conflict between the adventurers and Myrkyssa Jelan, the disguised warlord disappeared. The former Lord Mayor, Charles Oliver O'Kane took up his former mantle once again to help bring order back to the chaotic city.\n\nSometime during the late 1300s or early to mid-1400s DR, the cities of Ravens Bluff, Calaunt and [[Tantras]] allied their interests and formed the commerce-driven nation of Vesperin. Following this alliance, the city continued to thrive, growing larger and even more influential than the new nation's capital.",
            "15{{th}} century": "As [[Sembia]] was taken over by [[Netheril]] during the 1400s DR, many of its merchants fled for the nation of Vesperin and found Ravens Bluff to be a perfect new home."
