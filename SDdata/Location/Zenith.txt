Zenith was a a small Netherese fishing village in ancient Netheril.
The village was built a narrow peninsula that protruded into the Narrow Sea.
Zenith was founded in  as one of Netherils earliest and most remote settlements, and had the potential to become a great port. It served as an early stop on the trade route with the Delzoun dwarves of Ascore, but it was built too early to take much advantage of the growing maritime traffic. Ultimately it was other ports such as Harborage and Northreach that handled the bulk of the Narrow Seas mercantile business. A mythallar was added in , which calmed the rough weather around the village somewhat but not enough to bring it any measure of prosperity.
A great army of orcs massed in western Netheril in , and began moving towards Seventon. Zenith and Conch were threatened as well, and the region was only saved by the intervention of Ioulaum and his enclave. Though it remained an important trade post for the Rengarth and Angardt tribes, to the rest of Netheril it simply passed out of history for lack of any significance. It was finally abandoned in , two years after Karsuss Folly.
