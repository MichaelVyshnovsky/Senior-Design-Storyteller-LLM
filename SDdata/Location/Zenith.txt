'''Zenith''' was a a small [[Netherese]] fishing village in ancient [[Netheril]].

==Geography==
The village was built a narrow peninsula that protruded into the [[Narrow Sea]].

==History==
Zenith was founded in {{yearlinkConvert|222|NY}} as one of Netheril's earliest and most remote settlements, and had the potential to become a great port. It served as an early stop on the trade route with the [[Delzoun]] [[dwarves]] of [[Ascore]], but it was built too early to take much advantage of the growing maritime traffic. Ultimately it was other ports such as [[Harborage]] and [[Northreach]] that handled the bulk of the Narrow Sea's mercantile business. A ''[[mythallar]]'' was added in {{yearlinkConvert|919|NY}}, which calmed the rough weather around the village somewhat but not enough to bring it any measure of prosperity.

A great army of [[orc]]s massed in western Netheril in {{yearlinkConvert|1048|NY}}, and began moving towards [[Seventon]]. Zenith and [[Conch (city)|Conch]] were threatened as well, and the region was only saved by the intervention of [[Ioulaum]] and his [[Xinlenal|enclave]]. Though it remained an important trade post for the [[Rengarth]] and [[Angardt]] tribes, to the rest of Netheril it simply passed out of history for lack of any significance. It was finally abandoned in {{yearlinkConvert|3522|NY}}, two years after [[Karsus's Folly]].
