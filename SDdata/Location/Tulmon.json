We have a ''lot'' of stones.|A famous Tulmonite warning towards [[wizard]]s, originating from the play ''[[The Red Rages of Ozoone Stormspells]]''.<ref name=EotSS-p166\">}}",
        "Geography": "This city-state stood on a long and low-lying rocky plateau known as the [[Shoulder of Lehreng]], dominating the shallow and muddy [[Bay of Balefires]].",
        "Description": "The buildings of Tulmon were almost entirely constructed of stone, Like many Calishite cities, Tulmon was divided into [[drudach]]s and [[sabban]]s, numbering 46 and 11 respectively.",
        "Government": "The city was first significantly ruled over by a cruel [[archmage]] named [[Calavarr]], who ruled his city through fear and his magical might. Following the end of his rule, the rulers of Tulmon went by the title of Sultan. who had used [[magic]] to extend his lifespan.\n\nThe judiciary body of Tulmon was known as the [[Manticore Court]]. Unlike proper Calishite cities, the division of drudachs and sabbans played little role in Tulmon governance.",
        "Defenses": {
            "Crime": "The city lacked any overt criminal organizations or [[thieves' guild]]s, as well as any prominent, colorful [[rogue]]s. Most criminal activity in the city was conducted behind closed doors by merchant cabals, directing open activities. By 1370 DR, forgery was seeing a rise in both skill and popularity in the city, to the point that some of the Brightest of Sudulphor would send agents out to Tulmon to take advantange of the services."
        },
        "Trade": "Around the 1350's DR, Tulmon's economy was largely based around agriculture, storing and selling the produce of the fertile Arnaden peninsula. A good deal of this produce was traded to the eastern cities of [[Calimshan]]. Some Calishite merchant ships would take the risk of sailing the [[Lake of Steam]] directly to Tulmon, rather than making a stop at the city of Suldolphor along the way, though most chose not to take the risk even if it meant produce of a higher quality and cheaper value.\n\nOvertime the Tulmon economy shifted to exporting sheepskin, [[dye]]d wool, and metalwork. Fruit, mutton, and the stone it quarried from camps in the nearby countryside shifted to being reserved for internal use. Its quarries produced a hard, yet durable, black stone, as well as occasionally veins of pure [[copper]], and most rarely clusters of [[gemstone]]s.\n\nThe city was also an industrious center of art, learning, [[book]] publication, and craftsmen, including carpenters, [[lamp]]makers, and windowmakers. The city was particularly well-known for the black stone of its quarries, its stamped and rolled bookbindings, book corners, surrounds (of [[lock]]s and handles affixed to furniture elsewhere), and flexible metal sheets that were made for use in the pages of books meant to last (such as [[spellbook]]s).\n\nEquipment stores in the city were quite robust, boasting some metalwork goods that were rare in other parts of the Realms. However, copies and forgeries were also more likely to be found in Tulmon than anywhere else in [[Faer√ªn]], even compared to some of the continent's largest cities.\n\nThe Manticore Court received a majority of its funds from the mercantile factors of Suldolphor, otherwise known as the Brightest. Its hired tradesmen were largely beholden to the whims of the Brightest, however, Suldolphor's leader [[Daeranatha Dorluu]] and her [[Flame Guard]] kept the varied ambitions and plans of her city's merchants in-check, thus ensuring that open struggles or mercantile warfare would not breakout in the streets of neighboring Tulmon.",
        "History": "Tulmon began as a humble settlement of fisherfolk and shepherd huts.\n\nOver the centuries, the city was on many occasions claimed by the nation of Calimshan as belonging to them or at risk of becoming of a satellite town of Sudolphor.\n\nOne of its first significant rulers, the cruel archmage Calavarr, was eventually overthrown by [[Anganather Tchallem]], who began the tradition of Tulmon's rulers being referred to as Sultans. Over the years that followed, Tulmon became engaged in a series of wars with rival cities that they ultimately lost, leading to the destruction of its western districts. Sometime around the 11{{th}} century DR, Anganather's great-grandson, Arkanuirr Tchallem, became the new sultan of Tulmon.\n\nAt some point, an ambitious [[Loviatan]] [[priestess]] tried to magically enslave the Sultan, and by extension the city, but he managed to overcome and slay her. On another occasion, an unscrupulous [[Calishite]] [[Pasha]] attempted to install a [[slave]]-breeding operation in the Sultan's Citadel with the intent of replacing Arkanuirr with a [[doppelganger]], but this potential usurper too was slain by the magical Sultan.\n\nSometime prior to the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, as part of experiments<ref group=\"note\" name=\"ritual-date\">An exact date for when these \"initiation rituals\" were occurring is not stated in ''Empires of the Shining Sea'' (p. 164), but since they are Myrkulyte rituals they were likely occurring before the Skullspire clergy converted to the [[Church of Cyric]]. and initiation rituals, the [[Myrkulyte]]s of Tulmon animated strange assemblages of [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s from various monsters, leaving them to wander off into subterannean tunnels and later emerge topside in the western ruins of the city. The presence of these undead would lead to the rebuilding of the city's western walls, excluding the area that came to be known as Crypt City.\n\nDuring his rise to power, Calimshan's [[Syl-pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]] negotiated with the governments of Tulmon, Suldolphor, and Yeshpek to arrange a solid alliance. In  exchange for political support of these cities and the issuing of token taxes, the syl-pasha agreed to leave them to their own devices. With this new deal in place, the three city-states would gradually surge in both political and mercantile power in the years following the [[Time of Troubles]].",

        "Inhabitants": "In [[1357 DR]], the population of Tulmon was numbered around 123,000. By [[1370 DR]], the population of the city-state had dropped to around 26,000 or 25,000, not counting the 3,400 Tulmonites that lived outside its walls at fruit farms, sheep ranches, and quarry camps. At the height of the summer trade season, the population in the city could rise as high as 44,600, though for most years it went no higher than around 37,000 to 38,000. The vast majority of the city's permanent residents, as well those who worked outside its walls in the countryside, were [[human]]s.\n\nTulmonites didn't value excessive revelry or eccentricity.<ref name=EotSS-p166\" /> and [[sorcerers]], viewing them as craftworkers whose work was overly expensive and far too dangerous to be of practical, everyday use. They also felt that these [[arcane]] spellcasters were all too often arrogant, above having to follow the law and trade rules. Whilst local mages were tolerated,<ref name=EotSS-p166\" /> foreign wizards and sorcerers were distrusted and unwelcomed.<ref name=EotSS-p166\" />\n\nThe citizenry of some of the larger and brasher settlements in the Arnaden region dismissed Tulmonites as dull-witted peasants.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "* Around 1370 DR, the Tulmonite quarries were rumored to be guarded by monsters, such as [[mimic]]s or even dopplegangers."
