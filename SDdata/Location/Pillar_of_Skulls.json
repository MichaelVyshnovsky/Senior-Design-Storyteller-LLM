        "mainbody": "The Pillar of Skulls was a landmark in the plane of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. It contained the skulls of victims of the Blood War, taken as trophies by the devils.\nThe Pillar towered over  into the sky of Avernus. It comprised a wide variety of skulls, ranging from the tiny to the size of a house. The majority, however, were of demons, the enemy of the devils.. \nThe majority of the skulls that comprised the Pillar were of those killed in the Blood War. However, in some cases the souls of those whose lies and betrayals led to deaths of other people were condemned to join the Pillar in the form of a sentient skull.\nIt stood by the ledge around the layer of Avernus, near a low point where access to the next layer down, Dis, was possible via an exceptionally tall spire in that city. Near the base of the Pillar of Skulls was a huge cave mouth, in which laired the dragon-goddess Tiamat, who guarded passage between the layers here."
