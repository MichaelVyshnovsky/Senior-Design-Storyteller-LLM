        "mainbody": "The '''Pillar of Skulls''' was a landmark in the [[plane]] of [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]]. It contained the skulls of victims of the [[Blood War]], taken as trophies by the [[devil]]s.",
        "Description": "The Pillar towered over {{SI|1|mi|k}} into the sky of Avernus. It comprised a wide variety of skulls, ranging from the tiny to the size of a house. The majority, however, were of [[demon]]s, the enemy of the devils.. \n\nThe majority of the skulls that comprised the Pillar were of those killed in the [[Blood War]]. However, in some cases the [[soul]]s of those whose lies and betrayals led to deaths of other people were condemned to join the Pillar in the form of a sentient skull.<ref>\n\nIt stood by the ledge around the layer of Avernus, near a low point where access to the next layer down, [[Dis]], was possible via an exceptionally tall spire in that city. Near the base of the Pillar of Skulls was a huge cave mouth, in which laired the dragon-goddess [[Tiamat]], who guarded passage between the layers here."
