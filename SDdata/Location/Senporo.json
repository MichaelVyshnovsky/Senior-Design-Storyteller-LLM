        "mainbody": "Senporo was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa. It was little more than a hiding place for outcasts and brigands.\nThe people of Senporo were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. The hamlet had a population of about 110 individuals after . These lived among a collection of a few small shacks. There was only a single inn in the village.\nSenporo was located at the northern end of the Fochu Peninsula, where it connected to the mainland of Tsukishima. It sat in the foothills of the Jufosu Mountains.\nVillages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya, typically a minor samurai, and Senporo was no different in this respect. The shoya of Senporo after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was Moti Kaihogh, who was also the settlements only innkeeper and bartender.\nLike the other tiny settlements of the region, Senporo had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. \nThe village had no production to speak of and had nothing to sell. A drink of corn sake at the inn cost 1 fen per glass or 3 yuan per jar. A night in the inn cost 2 or 3 fen, but it was risky to stay there, as patrons might find themselves robbed in the night.\nUnlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Senporo were not particularly religious.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
