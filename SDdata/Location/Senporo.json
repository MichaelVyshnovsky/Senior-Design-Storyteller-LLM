        "mainbody": "'''Senporo''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. It was little more than a hiding place for outcasts and brigands.",
        "Description": "The people of Senporo were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. The hamlet had a population of about 110 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}. These lived among a collection of a few small shacks. There was only a single inn in the village.",
        "Geography": "Senporo was located at the northern end of the Fochu Peninsula, where it connected to the mainland of [[Tsukishima]]. It sat in the foothills of the [[Jufosu Range|Jufosu Mountains]].",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]], and Senporo was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' of Senporo after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was [[Moti Kaihogh]], who was also the settlement's only innkeeper and bartender.",
        "Trade": "Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Senporo had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. \n\nThe village had no production to speak of and had nothing to sell. A drink of corn [[sake]] at the inn cost 1 [[fen]] per glass or 3 [[yuan]] per jar. A night in the inn cost 2 or 3 [[fen]], but it was risky to stay there, as patrons might find themselves robbed in the night.",
        "Religion": "Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Senporo were not particularly religious.",
        "History": "Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
