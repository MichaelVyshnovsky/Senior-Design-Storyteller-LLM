        "mainbody": "Zoundar was a settlement at the base of the Lhairghal Peaks and the Halar Hills, on the southern shores of River Halar.\nZoundars main industry was electrum mining. The abundance of the precious metal in the city spawned a saying, \"wouldnt miss it for all the electrum in Zoundar.\"\nInterestingly enough, Zoundar was connected to a small city of Nonthal in Turmish via the fifth of the one-way gates known as the 13 Gates of Magic. The portal transported unlucky individuals into a little-known mountain valley near Zoundar."
