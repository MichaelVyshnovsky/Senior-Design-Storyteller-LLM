        "Description": "Zoundar's main industry was [[electrum]] mining. The abundance of the precious metal in the city spawned a saying, \"wouldn't miss it for all the electrum in Zoundar.\"\n\nInterestingly enough, Zoundar was connected to a small city of [[Nonthal]] in [[Turmish]] via the fifth of the one-way ''[[gate]]s'' known as the ''[[13 Gates of Magic]]''. The ''portal'' transported unlucky individuals into a little-known mountain valley near Zoundar.{{Cite polyhedron/106/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Endless Treasures in Turmish|7}}"
