The '''Lake of Salt''', also known as '''Azulduth''', was a shallow body of water in the [[Beastlands]] that was fed by the [[River of Swords]]. It was surrounded by partially-looted [[Sauroid]] ruins, many of which extended deep under the earth and was primarily inhabited by [[Yuan-ti]].

==Description==
The ruined [[Nezram's tower|tower]] of the powerful [[wizard]] [[Nezram]] lay on the lake's far northeastern shore.

Deep beneath the lake was a large, complex system of pumps called the ''Pumps of Pyraddin'', believed to be named for a [[dwarven]] [[engineer]] responsible for their construction. These pumps continually drained the welling springs around the lake and filtered their water through lakes of [[charcoal]] and [[chalk]], as well as air jet bubble-rakes. Finally, it pumped the water down into the [[Deep Lands]] where it formed a river that eventually flowed up into the [[Aerilpar Forest]].

==Inhabitants==
The shallow waters of the lake was home to clans of [[sarrukh]], [[wereserpent]]s, and [[werecrocodile]]s.
