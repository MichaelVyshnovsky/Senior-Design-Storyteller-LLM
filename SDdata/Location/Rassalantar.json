        "mainbody": "Rassalantar was a hamlet and caravan stop on the Long Road, just north of Waterdeep in the Sword Coast North region. , \nThe small community consisted of six walled farms. They centered around a spring-fed pond which drained into a stream and emptied to the east into the Stump Bog, a sprawling, desolate marsh haunted by monsters. To the west of the farmhouses, a narrow patch of trees known as Keep Woods masked the ruins of Rassalantars Keep, and to the east of the pond was the Sleeping Dragon.\n* Stump Bog\n* Keep Woods\nSince Rassalantar was under Waterdeeps protection, sixty guards were stationed in the barracks just off the road behind the Sleeping Dragon inn. The fighters were outfitted in chain mail with shields and fought with spears, longswords, hammers, and daggers.  The Waterdhavian soldiers patrolled the Long Road from the gates of their city to a cavern a half-days ride north of Amphail. The guards were rotated back to duty in Castle Waterdeep once a month.\nLong ago, the warrior Rassalantar built Rassalantars Keep to the west of the present settlement. The ruined keep was used by traveling vagabonds, doppelgangers, and hungry monsters as a place of shelter. In 1370 DR, the hamlet of Rassalantar was under the protection of Waterdeep with guards patrolling as far north as half a day beyond Amphail.\n* Sleeping Dragon\n* Rassalantars Keep"
