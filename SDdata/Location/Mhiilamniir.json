        "Location": "The city stood in the heart of the [[High Forest]], less than two days' journey away from the west end of the [[Old Road (High Forest)|Old Road]] and three days' journey east of the [[Lost Peaks]].",
        "History": "During the height of the kingdom of Eaerlann, Mhiilamniir was formerly the seat of power for several of the priesthoods of the [[Seldarine]] in the [[North]].\n\nThe settlement was destroyed in the [[demon]]ic uprising from [[Hellgate Keep]], and most of it was overgrown with moss and ivy. The female [[green dragon]] [[Chloracridara]] claimed the whole city and its environs as her domain. She had lived in the partially standing ruins of the temple to [[Corellon Larethian]] for six hundred years by [[1370 DR]]. Her rabid paranoia and offspring's hunting made the surrounding area quite dangerous, too hazardous for elven pilgrims to visit any of the temples.",
        "Locations": "The city was home to a number of major temples. While the largest was the temple of Corellon, the very oldest was the [[Temple Beyond Time]], dedicated to [[Labelas Enoreth]]. According to Labelasan religious texts, it had stood during the early history of [[Aryvandaar]], ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-23600}}.",
        "Inhabitants": "A male [[half-elf]] [[half-dragon]] woodsman was known to claim that he could grant an audience with Chloracridara for a fee."
