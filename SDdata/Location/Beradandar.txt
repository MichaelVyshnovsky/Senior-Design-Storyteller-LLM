Beradandar was a city of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra and once its temporary capital.
It lay between the cities of Parmahana and Ranguri, far into the jungle.
After deserting their former capital at Parmahana some time in the early 8 century DR,This is "over 600 years" before a setting date of 1357 DR, so some time before 757 DR. the Kuong people made an exodus through the jungle. They made a temporary capital at Beradandar, before moving on to the permanent capital at Ranguri.
By the midâ€“14 century DR, Beradandar was almost abandoned, yet its two temple schools and three monasteries remained in operation. They flourished as centers of learning and pilgrimage despite their isolation.
