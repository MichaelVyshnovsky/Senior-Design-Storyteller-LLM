        "Description": "The village was hidden in a dale, unknown to almost all who did not live there and uncharted on any maps. Due to the size of the inhabitants, the buildings were at most {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall at the chimney top. The locals spent much of their time in relaxed gardening pursuits, with extensive fields and orchards surrounding their homes.",
        "Geography": "The village lay about {{SI|5|mile|k|long=yes}} from the [[Way of the Dragon]] where it exited the [[King's Forest]], not far from [[Minroe]] in the foothills of the [[Storm Horns]].",
        "Inhabitants": "A particularly extraordinary resident of Home was the gnome [[Ekhar Lorrent]], who was periodically compelled to abandon his humble abode and travel abroad and solve murder mysteries."
