        "mainbody": "Phanlinksal was a ruined illithid settlement located in the Underdark.\nPhanlinksal was located in the Upper Northdark beneath the Lurkwood, a few weeks march west of Menzoberranzan.\nThe settlement was located in a long, narrow cavern and built in the form of a castle centered around a stalagmite tower, which served as living quarters for prominent members of the community. Inside the tower, balconies lined the walls, overlooking the central elder brain, which was constantly attended to by nimble-fingered slaves. Other structures in the city included the Axial Plaza, a capture pit, thrall barracks, a gladiatorial arena, and birthing pools.\nJust outside the city was a roth√©-inhabited \"herd island\" surrounded by gorges with a narrow, magical bridge connecting it to the settlement.\nBefore its destruction, Phanlinksal was home to an elder brain and up to 120 illithids and three times that number of thralls.\nThe city was founded in the , by the elder brains ruling illithid society. They chose a defensible cavern close to the surface to allow for easy raiding of Uthgardt tribes in the Lurkwood. One of the elder brains was relocated to the site. Despite this, the settlement always remained small.\nIn the , illithids from Phanlinksal attempted to invade the drow city of Menzoberranzan from the Eastways. But the mind flayers were defeated and 80 of them were executed by a vampiric illithid (kept as a \"pet\" by House Oblodra) in a location later named the Cavern of the Severed Tentacles.\nThe illithids continued to be a nuisance to Menzoberranzan. In the , the ruling House Baenre grew tired of illithid raids and armed themselves to destroy Phanlinksal. The city was spared when Methil El-Viddenvelp, one of the more prominent mind flayers, agreed to serve Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre as her secret advisor in exchange for her sparing the city.\nIn the , the renegade drow Drizzt DoUrden and his companions Belwar Dissengulp and Clacker were captured and enthralled by illithids and taken to serve as slaves in Phanlinksal. In the confusion, many illithids were killed by their thralls or by the zin-carla inhabiting the body of Zaknafein DoUrden, which was seeking Drizzt. The few surviving illithids abandoned the city and fled to their kin in Gauntlgrym.\nThe abandoned settlement was then inhabited by a neothelid. The Sept IllGhact, which was founded by Methil El-Viddenvelp in the , began using the ruined city as their base. The septs intention was to create a new elder brain and rebuild the city, but their progress was slow, particularly after Methil was severely injured in the . The sept remained inactive for several decades until it was taken over by the ulitharid Galgast El-Venken.\nBy the time of the Spellplague in the , the sept was firmly entrenched in Phanlinksal and had tamed the neothelid to serve as a guardian. However, to the outside world, the settlement still appeared abandoned.\n* Methil El-Viddenvelp\n* Galgast El-Venken"
