The '''Desert of Al-Alisk''' was a region of the Raurin haunted by the remnants of two clans who fought to the death over a stolen bride. Martek secreted it away in order to serve as a trial for adventurers entering the [[Citadel of Martek]].

==Description==
The desert was almost featureless, with no visible stones, and no wind. Any who arrived from [[The Grand Hall of the Crystal Prism]] were brought before a {{SI|10|feet}} tall crystal monolith, which bore a written message.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation/Map}}

==Inhabitants==
Almost nothing was alive in the Desert of Al-Alisk: even the wind was dead. Restless spirits engaged in an extended skirmish in the sky every midnight until 3 AM.

==History==
On her wedding night, the daughter of the Sultan of Pazar, Sithal Al-Husn, was kidnapped by Habrauk Al-Nirin of the Al-Alisk clan, who trapped her spirit and body in a crystal box. This started a feud that would last for five generations, ending the bloodlines of Pazar, Al-Alisk, and Akhir. The battle would continue to be waged nightly across the sky, as the spirit of her intended husband led the hosts of the Lancers of Death towards the spectral forces of the Al-Alisk clan.
Weary from his preparations for resurrection, and seeking one more test to add to his citadel,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|108}} Martek caused the entire section of the desert to be transported into another subdimensional bubble.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}}

==Rumors & Legends==
In a broad swath of desert between the Crypt and the city, anyone spending the night was treated to a vision. Those who were evilly aligned were given a vision from Habrauk Al-Nirin urging them to stay away from his crypt, while those who were not were instead treated to a call from the Princess, who called on them to rescue her. On any night after the first, they would be treated to the sight of an endless swarm of spectral riders, {{SI|500|feet}} over the ground, riding towards the Crypt to do battle with Habrauk Al-Nirin's spectral minions.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|124}}
