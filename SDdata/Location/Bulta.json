        "mainbody": "ulta was a small mysterious island found in the Pirate Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars. \nBulta lay on the western rim of the Bowl along the Spoon strait.\nThough no permanent human settlements were found on the island, a wide assortment of half-sized animals called the minimals inhabited Bulta. These creatures piqued the curiosity of the pirates who sometimes explored portions of the island. Superstitious and wary of the islands bizarre animals, the pirates were careful not to disturb anything during their visits.\nTiny winged humanoids were rumored to have been spotted flitting about the island.\nBulta was believed to have once been much larger, and perhaps shrunken in size like the minimals with powerful magic."
