        "Geography": "Bulta lay on the western rim of [[the Bowl]] along [[the Spoon]] strait.",
        "Inhabitants": "Though no permanent [[human]] settlements were found on the island, a wide assortment of half-sized animals called the [[minimals]] inhabited Bulta. These creatures piqued the curiosity of the pirates who sometimes explored portions of the island. Superstitious and wary of the island's bizarre animals, the pirates were careful not to disturb anything during their visits.\n\nTiny winged [[humanoid]]s were rumored to have been spotted flitting about the island.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Bulta was believed to have once been much larger, and perhaps shrunken in size like the minimals with powerful magic."
