        "mainbody": "Amn\nRiatavin was a city in Amn and later Tethyr in west Faerûn.\nA group of merchants known as the Chosen Council governed the city in the 15th century DR.\nThe Heralds of Faerûn had an office here, entitled Thorn Tree.\nA popular local periodical chapbook called Dansarras Delights was inspired by a long-gone undead dancer and courtesan whose name and attitude was used to write skewering reviews of local businesses, performances, and opinion pieces about local public figures.\nThe College of the Eclipse, a society dedicated to psionics education and advancement, was based in Riatavin in the mid-1370s DR. The Company of Hunnar was a two-hundred strong mercenary company based in Riatavin around 1358 DR. This company specialized in siege warfare, but also employed standard military units.\nFormerly a city of Amn, Riatavin seceded to become part of Tethyr in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nOn the Feast of the Moon of 1370 DR, the Herald Thorn Tree disappeared hours before he was to perform the Bloodsong. This triggered a storm of controversy. First, there were rumors that the High Heralds had plans to expel Thorn Tree for corruption. Second, the rebel government of Riatavin had hoped to use the Bloodsong to assert their authority over the city amidst their secession from Amn to Tethyr. Third, some claimed that Thorn Tree had been working for, variously, Amn, Tethyr, the Knights of the Shield, or another faction of Riatavin. Thus, Thorn Trees disappearance was expected to be powerful political ammunition for all these factions, further disrupting the secession. In fact, Thorn Tree had actually been murdered by one the Eldreth Veluuthra, and his body hidden so well it might never be found.\nThe city lost population in the years after the Spellplague and, as of 1479 DR, parts of the city were abandoned.\nRiatavin had a significant criminal underworld and the Shadow Thieves were the dominant criminal organization. The city also suffered from bandit incursions from Erlkazar.\n*The Ring of Arms, a fighters school situated on Redmorn Lane.\n*House Tsornyl, survivors of the elven settlement Tsornyl destroyed by Moander, the god of rot, in .\n*Laughing Lynx Long-haul Caravan Company, a caravan company decimated by Balagos, the Flying Flame sometime before the late 14 century DR.\n*Avimmuck Wanderfoot, the Cloakmaster of Shadow Thieves Caravan Sect in the late 14 century DR.\n*Furbelow Trundlestump, a Harper agent and weaponshith of the Ring of Arms in the late 14 century DR.\n*Onyx the Invincible, a hero of the Reclamation War and the commander of Riatavins fortification in the late 14 century DR.\n*Osilant Lharnree, a horse merchants in the late 15 century DR."
