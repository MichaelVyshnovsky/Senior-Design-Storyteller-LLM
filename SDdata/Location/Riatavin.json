        "History": "Formerly a city of [[Amn]], Riatavin seceded to become part of [[Tethyr]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].\n\nOn the [[Feast of the Moon]] of 1370 DR, the Herald Thorn Tree disappeared hours before he was to perform the [[Bloodsong]]. This triggered a storm of controversy. First, there were rumors that the [[High Heralds]] had plans to expel Thorn Tree for corruption. Second, the rebel government of Riatavin had hoped to use the Bloodsong to assert their authority over the city amidst their secession from [[Amn]] to Tethyr. Third, some claimed that Thorn Tree had been working for, variously, Amn, Tethyr, the [[Knights of the Shield]], or another faction of Riatavin. Thus, Thorn Tree's disappearance was expected to be powerful political ammunition for all these factions, further disrupting the secession. In fact, Thorn Tree had actually been murdered by one the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], and his body hidden so well it might never be found.\n\nThe city lost population in the years after the [[Spellplague]] and, as of [[1479 DR]], parts of the city were abandoned.\n\nRiatavin had a significant criminal underworld and the [[Shadow Thieves]] were the dominant criminal organization. The city also suffered from bandit incursions from [[Erlkazar]].",
