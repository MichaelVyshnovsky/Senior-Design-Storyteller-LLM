        "mainbody": "The '''North Ward''' was the northeastern sector of [[Waterdeep]]. It was famous for being the quietest ward of the city, consisting mostly of residential areas.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The most prominent feature of the North Ward was the [[Cliffwatch]], a section of the Waterdeep plateau that was so steep and high that it provided a natural defense, so the area was marked by an interruption of the Trollwall between the [[Endcliff Tower]] and the [[Watchway Tower]] in the City of the Dead. A walkway traversed the entire Cliffwatch, along which some of the best inns and taverns of Waterdeep were located, taking advantage of the beautiful landscape to the east."
        },
        "History": "The North Ward was officially included as one of the official wards of Waterdeep in the {{YearlinkName|1276}}, together with the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]].\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], the noble [[Cassalanter]] family loaned two ten-million [[Golden lion (coin)|golden lions]] with a huge interest rate. The first loan was to [[Widow Silvermane]] who ran a [[lottery]] in the North Ward, and the second one went to the [[Field of Triumph]] Race Track in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]]. The astronomical loans were caused by goddess' [[Tymora]]s luck going out of control all over the Realms. Every single gambler picked the winning number and winning [[horse]]s, costing Widow Silvermane and the Field of Triumph disastrous losses.",
