'''Ariel-Than''' was an [[elven]] city in [[Chondalwood]], raised to the ground in [[144 DR]].

==History==
In the winter, early 144 DR, armies of the free-cities of [[Vilhon Reach]] invaded the forest of Chondalwood. The city of Ariel-Than was the closest to the edge and was burned to the ground by the invaders. With the dead toll exceeding two thousand, very few elves survived the assault and and retreated deeper into Chondalwood. Some said that the survivors settled in [[Rucien-Xan]], a legendary undiscovered elven city in the heart of Chondalwood.

The destruction of Ariel-Than was the event that created the nation of [[Chondath]].
