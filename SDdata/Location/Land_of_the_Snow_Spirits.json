        "mainbody": "The '''Land of the Snow Spirits''', also called the '''Land of the Snow Demons''', was a vast expanse of frozen tundra covering the northern edge of [[Kara-Tur]] and reaching down into the [[Hordelands]].",
        "Geography": "The Land of the Snow Spirits stretched for well over a thousand miles across the continent of Kara-Tur. It lay further north than even the [[Northern Wastes]] as it paralleled the [[Ulhai Shan]] range. It stretched from the fringes of the [[Eastern Sea]] all the way to [[Yal Tengri]] in the west. Much of the land was permafrost, while perhaps an even greater majority was composed of shifting mountainous blocks of ice.",
        "Description": "The frozen wastes of this region were one of the most inhospitable places on [[Toril]]. It began as a land of winding rivers and bogs just north of the [[Ama Basin]] but transformed quickly into flat frozen land. The seasons changed quickly in this land, with spring being almost non-existent and summer cut short by the long winter.",
        "History": "Following the [[Spellplague]], a group of [[hobgoblin]]s that had been living in this area were enslaved by [[oni]]s from the Ama Basin.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|4}}"
