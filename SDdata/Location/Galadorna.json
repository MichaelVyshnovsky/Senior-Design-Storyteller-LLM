        "histrefs": "Per the Google Books version of ''Temptation'', its realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster they're in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764. Given Feldrin's warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result.",
        "mainbody": "'''Galadorna''', also styled '''The Unicorn Kingdom''', was a kingdom in the [[Wizards' Reach]] until the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "Galadorna was in the [[Wizards' Reach]], centered around [[Nethrar]]; it did not extend all the way to [[Laothkund]].",
        "Government": "A king reigned in Galadorna. There were a number of barons under him; among those barons were [[Tholone]], [[Hothal]], [[Maethor]], [[Feldrin]], and [[Belundrar]].",
        "Trade": "Galadorna had mines of [[iron]] and [[silver]].",
        "Defenses": "Each baron of Galadorna had significant retinues and all of them contributed to the kingdom's defense.",
        "History": "During the reign of King [[Baerimgrim]], the self-styled Lord [[Tholone]], one of the barons, had been ignoring court decrees since approximately {{yearlink|755}}.\n\nOne bright summer day in the {{yearlinkName|764}}, about a year after the king was gravely injured by the [[green dragon]] [[Arlavaunta]], King Baeringrim held a meeting with his barons to determine the successor; they chose Tholone to be the next king. However, both men were slain by [[Nadrathen]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], who crowned himself king in their place. After his fellow Chosen, [[Elminster]], stopped him, the [[Banite]] sorceress [[Dasumia]] slew Nadrathen and took over as Queen of Galadorna.\n\nUnder her reign, Galadorna became rife with feuding mages and was chaotic yet wealthy.\n\nThe Unicorn Kingdom was ultimately destroyed by the Lords of Laothkund, within a [[tenday]] of the Queen's disappearance, very likely within the year."
