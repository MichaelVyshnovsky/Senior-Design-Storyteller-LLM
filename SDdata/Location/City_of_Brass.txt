Floating amid the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], the '''City of Brass''' was the epicenter of [[efreet]] culture and was the place from where the Sultan of the Efreet ruled.

==Geography==
[[File:CityofBrass-1e.jpg|thumb|273px|''A trio of efreet walk among the flames outside of the City of Brass.'']]
Hovering in the hottest areas of the Plane of Fire, the City of Brass sat in an enormous hemisphere of brass some {{SI|40|miles|long=yes}} across. A curtain of beaten brass surrounded the entire city, stretching for hundreds of miles and giving the city its name. However, since the brass hemisphere gave the city its ability to fly, (albeit slowly,) these impressive walls were typically unmanned. Despite this, the city itself had a hindering effect on those of [[good]] alignment, due partly to the nature of the efreet but also to the numerous connecting portals with the [[Nine Hells]].

Surrounding the city itself were large tracts, known as the [[Obsidian Fields]], used for the cultivation of the exotic crops that inhabited the plane of fire. Examples included [[qamah]], [[habbat]], [[verdobba]], [[umbelin]], [[tergamit]], and [[fireweed]]. There were also areas for slaves to mine [[tin]], [[copper]], and [[diamond]]s for their efreeti masters.

===Geographical features===

*[[Sable Forest]]
*[[Slope]]

==Government==
The City of Brass was governed by the undisputed Sultan of the Efreet, who ruled the city with a tyrannical hold over his subjects. On occasion, the Sultan would oversee important legal matters of [[noble efreeti|noble efreet]] but mostly focused on wider policies. Although the Sultan was the paramount authority in the City of Brass, he generally delegated the day-to-day affairs to his vizier. Around [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} the title of Grand Sultan was held by [[Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan]].

Most efreet pledged their fealty to the Grand Sultan, whether they resided in the city or not. Even those residing in settlements outside of the city considered it their capital.

For matters regarding the [[Prime Material Plane]], the Sultan delegated to his six [[Great Pashas]].

===Law & Order===
Although the streets of the city were bustling with trade and crammed with crowds during the day, by night a strict curfew was enforced by the [[Illuminated]]. All shops were shut up and all citizens returned to their homes, else they faced arrest, the loss of a hand, or even death.

Slaves were obligated to bear bracelets that displayed their servitude and who their master was at all times. It was common for visitors to the city to become slaves by defaulting on borrowed money. In addition, this servitude could be extended by additional offenses that could add days or even years to their thralldom.

==Trade==
[[File:City_of_brass-5e.jpg|thumb|260px|''Two efreet in the City of Brass.'']]
The City of Brass was a shining beacon for trade and commerce throughout the planes, beckoning many planar travelers to its bazaars, souks, slave markets, and metalcrafters. Famed for its vendors of smoke, [[incense]], and [[tobacco]], the city was also noted for the [[azer]] smiths who worked ceaselessly for the efreet, crafting arms for the armies and the sultan. The city's harbor became a hub of activity when the City of Brass was set down near the surface to take on slaves and goods. This was done only by the Sultan's decree but could allow vast amounts of food and goods to flood into the city.

Behind closed doors, the efreet of the City of Brass had trade links with the [[Baatezu]]. Numerous portals to the [[Nine Hells]] allowed frequent trade of slaves and information.

==Defenses==
Arguably the city's first notable defense was its uncanny ability to float above and away from most threats. However, the city was still susceptible to flying intruders crossing its walls. The guards did not take such attempts lightly.

The armed forces of the City of Brass dwarfed the largest armies of [[Faerûn]] and came in a bizarre array of legions. These legions and their numbers follow:
*The [[Unquenchable]] – 3,000 elite and fanatical efreet guards.
*[[Eternal Crimson]] – 100,000 common efreet soldiers.
*[[Al-Asaf]] – 25,000 horse archers and lancers.
*[[Angels of Death]] – 35,000 efreet archers.
*[[Striders]] – 10,000 dragoons.
*[[Black Eagles]] – 3,000 [[jann|janni]] soldiers.
*[[Black Darts]] – 2,000 [[manscorpion]] slave-soldiers.
*[[Bronze Phalanx]] – 1,200 azer siege engineers.
*[[First Lancers]] – 1,000 noble efreet cavalry.
*[[Order of the Fiery Heart]] – 500 [[griffon]]-mounted efreet nobles.
*[[Watchfire Legions]] – 40,000 efreet irregulars.
*[[Illuminated]] – 50,000 city guards.
*[[Sultan's Own]] – 4,000 [[salamander]] skirmishers.
*[[Branded]] – 150 efreet [[mamluk]]s.

In addition to these considerable forces, a colossal navy of 18,000 individuals crewed the Sultan's personal fleet.

==History==
Considered the "oldest city in all creation", the City of Brass has long been known as hub for planar travelers and trade. Prior to the [[Dawn War]], it was part of the vast empire of the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]].{{Cite dungeon/129/A Gathering of Winds|40}}

Over the years the City of Brass was subjected to a number of attacks from outsiders. One notable occasion was when an [[archmage]] by the name of [[Tzunk]] attempted to conquer the City of Brass with the help of the potent artifact, the ''[[Codex of Infinite Planes]]''. Even with the powerful tome, he could not best the four million efreet that protected the city and was eventually defeated and bound before the Sultan.

At some point, the [[frost giant]] [[Kostchtchie]] led an attack on the City of Brass in a devastating raid. By traveling aboard the flying [[Ark of Kwalish]], he and his followers caused much chaos.

Some time in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ship ''[[Moonwind]]'' sank {{SI|50|miles|k|long=yes}} off the coast of [[Ravens Bluff]] and a passenger's ''[[well of many worlds]]'' unfurled, opening a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire. In the roughly four days that followed, water from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] drained into the portal and poured out on to the streets of the City of Brass.{{Cite polyhedron/77/Downunder the Living City|9-10, 13}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Plots and rumors abounded in the City of Brass, and a large degree of that concerned the efreet, if only for their numbers. Reputedly, the Sultan's court trafficked with [[baatezu]] from time to time, though much of these secret dealings happened behind closed curtains and only added to the tyranny of efreet rule.

==Layout==
[[File:City of Brass.jpg|thumb|270px|right|''A map of the City of Brass.'']]
Throughout the city the common efreet and their slaves had their own houses. The houses of noble efreet, on the other hand, teemed with servants and easily doubled as small fortresses.

The City of Brass was illuminated primarily by the ambient light from the Sea of Fire and fiery canals that intercrossed the city and provided a dim red glow throughout. This was supplemented by intermittent pots of unquenchable elemental fire that hung along the streets.

Efreets traversed the Sea of Fire and the city's canals through use of barges and [[galley]]s that were made of magically enchanted brass.
