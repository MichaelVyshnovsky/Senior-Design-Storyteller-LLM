'''Tashluta''', also known as the '''City of Slithering Vines''', was the capital city of [[Tashalar]], an oligarchical nation on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].{{Template:Cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|124}} Known as one of the [[Lapal League|Cities of the Seabreeze]],{{Template:Cite book/Shining South|177}} Tashluta was fairly unique in that it was constructed within and atop a volcanic crater that opened up into the [[Shining Sea]].{{Template:Cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|126}}

==Description==
The city was divided into the a number of districts, including the wealthy districts of its mercantile families built atop the higher ridges of the [[Tashalar Basin]], and the districts built beneath them that housed the city's lower and middle class citizens.

==Culture==
Citizens of Tashluta were considered to be quite refined and had an enlightened outlook towards outlanders. The welcoming disposition of the majority of Tashlutans was complemented by their propensity for being multi-lingual. A common source of amusement for Tashlutans was to play lighthearted pranks upon the many people that visited their city, often involving some of their particularly spicy foods.

As a result of the circumstances around Tashalar's founding and its conflict with the [[yuan-ti]] many residents of the capital had a distinct phobia of snakes and serpents.{{Template:Cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|13}} Nearly every type reptile found in the city were killed on sight.

==Geography==
The capital was located situated in the center of the [[Tashtan Coast]] within the fertile stretch of land known as the [[Tashalar Basin]],{{Template:Cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|125}}

===Geographical Features===
Tashluta was built atop the ridge and inner slope of a volcanic caldera, called the Tashalar Basin, that was partially flooded by the waters of the [[Shining Sea]]. The volcanic crater formed a natural harbor for the city's fleet of ships.

The narrow isle of [[Stormwall]] extended out from the sea at the edge of the harbor, shielding the bay from storms coming landward from the sea.

==Government==
Since its founding, Tashluta has been ruled by an oligarchy.

==Trade==
Tashluta was the home of the expansive trade consortium known as the [[Rundeen]]. Having consolidated a monopoly on trade in the region, they controlled all nearly all trade that passed though the city,

A number of drinks considered "exotic" to the folks of the [[Sword Coast|western coast]] of [[Faer√ªn]] originated from Tashluta, including [[amberthroat]], [[Tashlutan dragonstongue|dragonstongue]], and [[Tashlutan rollrum|rollrum]].

Tashluta was one of the locations that accepted [[Calishite trade bar]]s as form of currency.

==Defenses==
The coastal city was well-defended by an armada of ships that were sponsored by the Rundeen.

==History==
Tashalar and its capital were first founded by laborers from [[Lapal]] and merchants from [[Calimshan]] in the {{YearlinkName|-553}}. 

After being invaded by the yuan-ti forces of [[Serpentes]] in the {{YearlinkName|-189}}, the nation of Tashalar fought a ten-year war against their [[Se'Shen]] serpentine overlords, a conflict that ended in the {{YearlinkName|20}}. After gaining their independence, in the {{YearlinkName|34}}, Tashluta's oligarchs banded together and formed the Confederation of Tashtan, a declaration that outlined the lands over which the free nation would have dominion.

In the {{YearlinkName|285}}, Tashluta and the other Tashalan cities came under control of the [[Shoon Imperium]] shortly after the empire completely destroyed the belligerent [[Lapaliiya]]n city of [[Untisczer]]. The occupation of the city lasted for over 150 years, until the Shoon viceroy of Tashluta and his wife were slain during the collapse of the empire. After the initial military campaign, many of the city's residents left their home for other lands such as the [[Sanrach Basin]] in [[Thindol]].

Despite their great victory against the yuan-ti centuries before,

* [[House of Night's Embrace]], the most distinguished temple of [[Talona]] in all the Realms.
