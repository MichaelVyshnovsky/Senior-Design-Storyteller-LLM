The Great Garden was a wonder found within the fortress of Krak al-Mazhar in the Great Anvil of the Haunted Lands in 1367 DR.
The garden was found deep underground beneath the fortress. It was filled with beautiful flora and a bubbling marble fountain, all of which were real. The pristine blue sky and bird and insect sounds filling the garden were all an elaborate illusion.
The garden measured roughly  in diameter, but cleverly designed illusions made it appear endless. The paths traversing the garden had a maze-like effect upon occupants. Only those who knew the secret command word were immune to this effect.
The "sky" over the garden mimicked the same cycles that occurred above the fortress. A constant gentle breeze caressed every area of the Great Garden.
Nar-Aidiya enjoyed relaxing in the garden when he was able to find time. A tasked slayer genie named Mujibur served as caretaker and guardian of the garden.
