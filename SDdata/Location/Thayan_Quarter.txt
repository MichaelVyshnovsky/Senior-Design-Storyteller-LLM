The Thayan Quarter was a Thayan enclave in the city of Procampur in the Vast, and the first in the Realms.
Samas Kul, Thays Master of the Guild of Foreign Trade, organized the concession of a Thayan Quarter in Procampur in the Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR. This became the very first of the Thayan enclaves.
It was well-established by 1372 DR.
The Thayan Quarter enclaves sole sponsor in Thay was Lallara Mediocros, the Zulkir of Abjuration. In return, she profited greatly in wealth and slaves.
The enclave itself was led by a khazark who was a former apprentice of Lallara, favored by her and one of her firmest supporters.
The enclave was home to over 50 Thayan occupants.
As at other enclaves, abjurers who passed information on to Lallara were rewarded.
