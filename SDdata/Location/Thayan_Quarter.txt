The '''Thayan Quarter''' was a [[Thayan enclave]] in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]], and the first in the Realms.

==History==
[[Samas Kul]], [[Thay]]'s Master of the [[Guild of Foreign Trade]], organized the concession of a Thayan Quarter in Procampur in [[1344 DR|the Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR]]. This became the very first of the Thayan enclaves.

It was well-established by [[1372 DR]].

==Leadership==
The Thayan Quarter enclave's sole sponsor in Thay was [[Lallara Mediocros]], the [[Zulkir]] of [[Abjuration]]. In return, she profited greatly in wealth and [[slave]]s.

The enclave itself was led by a [[khazark]] who was a former apprentice of Lallara, favored by her and one of her firmest supporters.

==Organization==
The enclave was home to over 50 [[Thayan]] occupants.

As at other enclaves, [[abjurer]]s who passed information on to Lallara were rewarded.
