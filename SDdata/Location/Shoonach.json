        "mainbody": "Shoonach was the former capital of the Shoon Imperium, located on the border of Calimshan and Tethyr, and claimed by both.\nWork on Shoonach started as a ploy by King Amahl I to re-garrison the Calishite troops sent to keep an eye on him by his grandfather Akkabar Shoon. Construction began on the site of Iltakar, the capital of the old kingdom of Mir. Surprisingly, Akkabar supported the construction and, when Amahl I was assassinated, construction continued with the stones and slave labor taken from Ithmong when that city was destroyed to prevent an uprising from angry Tethyrians.\nBy 1369 DR, the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.\n* The Shoon Palace, seat of the Shoon Imperium government during 1 century DR."
