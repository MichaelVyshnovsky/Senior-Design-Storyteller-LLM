'''Wizard Ward''' was one of the seven central wards of the city of [[Calimport]], the center of its magical activities.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

==Description==
This ward was full of minarets, most of them [[wizard]]'s towers. Many magical and colorful protective wards and [[Permanent image|permanent illusions]] surrounded nearly 400 villas in Wizard Ward, making this part of the city a strange one to see for many visitors. These magical wards were established by private wizards, each with its own special protections and conditions.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

This ward of the city contained more than 1,000 buildings, and at least a third of those buildings were the homes of sages or wizards. Because the typical wizard was introverted and studious, this was one of the least busy wards in Calimport to pass through. The more extroverted [[enchanter]]s and [[illusionist]]s did like to show off their arcane talents, but they were in the minority.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
[[File:Wizard Ward location.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''A map of the city of [[Calimport]], with Wizard Ward highlighted in red.'']]
Wizard Ward was bordered by [[Calimport/Quill Ward|Quill Ward]] in the north and by [[Calimport/Maker's Ward|Maker's Ward]] in the east. To the south, most of its border was with [[Calimport/Hook Ward|Hook Ward]], but it also bordered Affar and Bitait Drudachs of Ylar Sabban in [[Calimport/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]].<ref name=Calimport-p29>

==Government==
The ruler of the ward was Sultan [[Eli el Beza|Eli yn Adran el Beza]], who was also the [[Caleph Arcane]] of Calimport. He was notable for dressing in the manner of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], complete with bald head and tattoos.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 /> He was also the brother of [[Nur el Beza]] of [[Almraiven]].

Sultan Eli required membership in the [[Guild Arcane]] for anyone wishing to live in this ward.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

==Defenses==
The ''[[amlakkar]]'' of Wizard Ward included wizards in their membership, at least two for every ten ''amlakkar'' were found among the officers. They utilized [[Rod of absorption|''rods of absorption'']] and other defensive magical tools to neutralize criminal activity that was magical in nature. Indeed, the presence of such mages in the watch of this ward meant that chaos of the arcane variety was rare in this district than in most others in the city.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

==Sabbans==
Wizard Ward was divided into three ''[[sabban]]s'' with nine ''[[drudach]]''s.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

===Etarad Sabban===
Also known as "Novice Sabban" or "Apprentice Sabban", this was where the wizards of lesser power and prestige lived. It was the least magically active of the three ''sabbans'' in the ward, because mundane businesses were less likely to be damaged from a powerful mage duel here than in the other two ''sabbans''. These simple businesses offered services catering to wizards, such as cooking, cleaning, preparation of [[material component]], ''etc''.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

The mark for this ''sabban'' was a wand or slash with seven-pointed stars around the tip. It contained three ''drudachs'': Mindemn Drudach, Esaaf Drudach, and Tamuh Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

; Notable Locations
; The Sphere of Kaatos : This bizarre landmark was a silver sphere three stories in diameter that floated some {{SI|18|feet|long=yes}} off the ground. The sphere had no doors or windows and was constantly spinning rapidly. Inside, held to the inside surface by centrifugal force, was the home and laboratory of a wizard by the name of Kaatos, who was a collector of [[Imaskar]]i relics. Location: Esaaf Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
; The Loom Halls : This well-built, four-story building was the headquarters of the Vibrant Order of Dyers and Weavers. Location: Tamuh Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

; Notable Inhabitants
[[Pasha]] [[Daud el Vehmet]] controlled the spice trade<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 /> in Wizard Ward and lived in a fancy three-story home in Mindemn Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

===Najja Sabban===
"Najja" was the name of one of the most powerful wizard's of Calimport's past. This ''sabban'' was also known as the "Auret Sabban", after its most famous landmark. Here was where the most powerful spellcasters of Calimport resided and where the Guild Arcane was based.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

All buildings in this upper-caste neighborhood were ornate and elaborate affairs, and the shapes and facades—and sometimes even the locations—of the buildings changed with the will of their owners.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

The mark for this ''sabban'' was three wands or slashes, each with seven-pointed stars around the tip. It also contained three ''drudachs'': Odan Drudach, Ziana Drudach, and Mayya Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

; Notable Locations
; Eyesafar Hall : This four-story guildhall was the home base of the Fellowship of Surveyers, Mappers, and Chart-Makers. Location: Odan Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
; [[Auret|The Auret]] : This seven-story, golden minaret, with magic sigils constantly in motion over its surface, was a famous site for the whole city of Calimport. It was the home of the Guild Arcane for the whole calephate of [[Calimshan]]. It was also a library of arcane knowledge, but only members of the Guild Arcane could enter.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 /> Location: Ziana Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
; [[Suryvlashadah]] : This beautiful villa, containing three five-story buildings and a five-story minaret, was the home of Sultan and Caleph Arcane Eli el Beza. Location: Ziana Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
; [[Aquas and Azures]] : This was a notable gemcutter's shop and jewelry store, specializing in [[sapphire]]s and other blue [[gem]]s, that was very particular about whom it accepted as customers. The only entrance to the shop was atop a seven-story minaret. If you were prestigious enough to receive an invitation from Melroat, the owner, a blue [[flying carpet]] would ferry you to a balcony at the top of the tower. Location: Mayya Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

===Tarshaj Sabban===
Also known as "Magi Sabban", this was the ''sabban'' where wizards of intermediate power and experience congregated and where may sages and their services could be found. Dull compared to its neighbor ''sabban'' in the west, much like Etarad Sabban, in truth, a plethora of [[magical item]]s and even [[artifact]]s could be acquired here, if one knew where to look. An industry of magic item identification, creation, and sometimes destruction was in place here. Because of the amount of powerful items changing hands so frequently here, the ''sabban'' also maintained a larger number of ''amlakkar''.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

The mark for this ''sabban'' was ''two'' wands or slashes, each with seven-pointed stars around the tip. It too contained three ''drudachs'': Sha'ati Drudach, Fer'a Drudach, and Salleb Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />

; Notable Locations
; Tuuramil House : Not only a wizard's home, this dark, three-story rowhouse also served as a school for [[necromancy]]. Location: Sha'ati Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
; Caaledar : This collection of six five-story minarets was the home of a married couple of wizards, [[Oma the Fireveil]] and [[Nur "Jambiyarcane"]], both of whom were yearly advisors to the [[Qysaghanni]]. The six towers were connected by invisible, arched bridges from the second and third floors, and each tower was glazed white with a gold-plated dome. Location: Fer'a Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
; The Coiled Quelzarn Tower: This ornate, four-story minaret stood out among all the other wizard homes in this ''sabban''. Location: Salleb Drudach.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />
