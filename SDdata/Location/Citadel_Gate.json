        "mainbody": "he Citadel Gate was the city gate of Baldurs Gate that separated Watch Citadel and its surrounding district from the rest of the Upper City.\nThis gate was only way in and out of the district, used by the Watch to launch mounted patrols from their fortress in the late 1400s DR. These horses were the only ones allowed in the city, and their excursions were largely ceremonial in nature."
