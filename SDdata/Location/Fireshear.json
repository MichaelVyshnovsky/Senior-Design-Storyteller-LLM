        "mainbody": "'''Fireshear''' was a mining city in the [[Frozenfar]] in [[northwest Faerûn]], on the coast west of the [[Iceflow]] river at the southern terminus of the [[Ten Trail]].\n\nThe remote outpost was comprised of buildings dug out of the rock and made of stone. They resembled igloos, which allowed them to tolerate the bitter winds and heavy snows on the coast without collapse. Many of the homes had deep cellars for storage of food for the harsh and isolating winters.\n\nThe city sat above cliffs carved with ramps that allowed access to a shallow bay. However, from the late fall through early summer, the city's stone docks were unusable as the bay froze over, a time the locals referred to as ''lock-in''. The city was dependent on imports of food and most necessities.",
        "Geography": "The city's location was chosen because of the rich [[copper]] and [[silver]] veins in the area that were exposed by a violent event, sometimes thought to be a volcanic eruption but in fact was a cataclysmic [[meteor]] impact in the distant past.\n\nThe mines were located in a rift that ended in the remnants of the impact crater. The walls of the bowl crater were blackened by fire, giving rise the city's name.",
        "Government": "The large city was ruled by a triumvirate made up of the heads of the three founding merchant houses. As of the late 1480s DR, the members and the companies they represented were [[Tharkus Gromm]], [[shield dwarf]] leader of [[Hammaver]] House (based in [[Mirabar]]), [[Darva]], [[dragonborn]] leader of the [[Silver Triangle]] (based in [[Neverwinter]]), and [[Zalaron Daska]], a [[Tethyrian]] [[human]] leader of the [[Delvers of Brokenstone]] (based in [[Waterdeep]]). These merchants were responsible for the hiring of adventurers when patrols or information were needed. They served until they resigned or died. The triumvirate members were known to be accepting of bribes. \n\nThe city's emblem was a crossed [[blade]], [[pick]], and [[shovel]] underneath an orange flame, on an ice-blue field.",
        "Inhabitants": "The city's miners were hired from the [[Sword Coast]] populace, and shipped into the city along with other workers such as healers. Miners were paid 100 [[gold piece]]s per month as of [[1366 DR]].",
        "Defense": "Fireshear's miners made up the military, which numbered 10,000. Attacks from [[bear]]s, [[crag cat]]s, and [[orc]]s happened occasionally, and when the city kept [[sheep]] as an extra food source, this would attract [[wolf|wolves]].",

            "Restaurants": "* [[Leaping Leucrotta]] (near the docks)\n* [[Green Garden]] (near the northernmost corner of the walls)",
            "Taverns": "* [[Singing Manticore]]\n* [[Drunken Dwarf]]",
            "Streets and roads": "* Makepeace Street: A road in Fireshear where the Singing Manticore was located."
        },
        "History": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], a greatship full of [[frost giant]] raiders from [[Svardborg]] attacked the town."
