'''Patayang''' was a town in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]]. It stood by the western frontier, near the border with [[T'u Lung]] and the [[Warring States]], and was one of the kingdom's remotest settlements in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}

==Description==
Despite its isolation and not having a decent temple by Kuong standards, Patayang was a valuable supplier of [[gem]]stones to the kingdom. These it traded through [[Gapapurang]] to [[Ranguri]], the Kuong capital.

Seeking more riches, many adventurers explored the jungles surrounding Patayang. Most only fell prey to the [[carnivorous ape|carnivorous jungle apes]].
