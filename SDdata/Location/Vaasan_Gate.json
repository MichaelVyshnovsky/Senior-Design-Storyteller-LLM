        "mainbody": "The Vaasan Gate, later known as the Iron Divide, was a massive fortification in Vaasa that completely spanned the western end of Bloodstone Pass. It and the Damaran Gate (on the eastern end of the Pass) comprised the Bloodstone Gates, one of the most ambitious feats of military engineering in Faer√ªn.\nThe Vaasan Gate stretched a half mile (800 meters) from mountain-to-mountain to completely block Bloodstone Pass and span the Beaumaris River.\nWhile the primary purpose was clearly as a military fortification, the Gate was also intended as a trade hub, and contained many merchants quarters, taverns, and shops.\nBloodstone Pass ran through the Galena Mountains, connecting Vaasa on its northwestern end to Damara on its southeastern end. By spanning the Pass on the western end, any traveler or invader that wished to get from Vaasa to Damara would need to either besiege the Vaasan Gate or travel dozens of miles north to find an alternative route through the mountains.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Honorable General Dannaway Tranth was both the commander of the Damaran forces and the mayor of the civilian inhabitants at the Vaasan Gate.\nWhen the Vaasan Gate was first constructed in the 14 century DR, it served as a vital trade hub for the people of Vaasa. Agricultural and mineral goods could be sold to merchants at the Vaasan Gate, which drastically reduced the time and risk involved in transporting them all the way through Bloodstone Pass. This was seen as an essential part of the Gates role in the region as it helped to establish stronger relationships between Vaasa and the Kingdom of Damara, so efforts were made to ensure that the Vaasans and dwarves doing business there received fair market prices.\nThe Vaasan Gates high and thick walls with only a single gate made it a fearsome obstacle for any potential invaders, and functionally ended the threat of wandering monsters attacking Bloodstone Valley. The tops of the walls were littered with siege equipment, especially ballistae&mdashwhich could be used to defend against aerial attacks&mdashand catapults. It maintained a garrison of 500 soldiers, which was significantly smaller than the forces at the Damaran Gate.\nAfter the defeat of Zhengyi the Witch-King at the end of the Bloodstone Wars, there was a pressing need to fortify Bloodstone Pass against future incursions from the remnants of his armies. The project was massive and costly, but was completed within the 1360s DR thanks to being largely funded through wealth acquired by Gareth and his adventuring companions in the course of defeating the Witch-King.\nEven before the Gate was finished, it not only secured Damaras border, but provided a point of stability in Vaasa. which culminated in his annexation of Vaasa to create the Kingdom of Bloodstone.\nIn the , the lich Sammaster declared himself to be the returned Witch-King and raised an army of Vaasan monsters. Members of his Cult of the Dragon infiltrated the Vaasan Gate, and on the 2nd of Mirtul,  While the invaders were defeated by the 11th of Flamerule, \nIn the , the Warlock Knights of Vaasa seized control of Bloodstone Pass, penetrating the Vaasan Gate and razing Bloodstone City. They then garrisoned both the ruins of the city as well as the Vaasan Gate, which they referred to as \"the Iron Divide,\" and sealed the Pass. \nUnder the Warlock Knights, the Gates purpose became less about keeping invaders out and more about keeping their own subjects trapped inside Vaasa. Soon, a tent city of refugees had begun to form nearby made up of desperate Vaasans hoping that Damara would come save them. The Knights also transitioned the town of Darmshall to become a supply depot and mustering point for feeding and reinforcing the Iron Divide.\n*Fugue Plane, a name given to two tent cities that formed outside of the Gate. In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it was located on the Bloodstone side and housed the throngs of mercenaries and adventurers who had come to collect bounties in Vaasa. In the late 15 century DR, it was located on the Vaasa side and housed refugees fleeing the Warlock Knights wars.\n*Muddy Boots and Bloody Blades, a tavern inside the fortress that catered to adventurers and mercenaries.\n*Ironheads Tavern, another tavern inside the fortress. A leader-board outside was used to rank the Gates bounty hunters.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Vaasan Gate was populated mostly by soldiers from Bloodstone. It also hosted a number of merchants from Damara catering to the folk of Vaasa. In addition, dozens of adventurers and bounty hunters seeking their fortunes in Vaasa lodged there, leading to a population of tavernkeepers, innkeepers, and other service providers catering to those adventurers. \nThe best-known inhabitant during this time was likely Mariabronne the Rover, a ranger and guide who became one of the greatest heroes of the Vaasan frontier.\nOther notable inhabitants included\n* Athrogate, a dwarven mercenary.\n* Canthan Doolittle, a wizard mercenary.\n* Dannaway Tranth, the garrison commander and mayor of the fortress.\n* Ellery Dragonsbane, a warrior and distant cousin of Gareth Dragonsbane.\nAs of the , the Vaasan Gate was garrisoned by Warlock Knights and their conscripted soldiers."
