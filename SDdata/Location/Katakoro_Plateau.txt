The '''Katakoro Plateau''' was the only large plateau in the entire [[Hordelands]].

==Geography==
The roughly triangular Katakoro Plateau was enclosed by the [[Kun-Yen Shan]] range to the south, the [[A-Ling Shan]] range to the west, and the [[Yellow Serpent Border Cliffs]] to the east.

==History==
===Ancient History===
By {{Yearlink|-6422}}, the Katakoro Plateau stood at the eastern border of the [[Imaskar Empire]]. During the Middle Kingdoms period ({{Yearlink|-6422}} to {{Yearlink|-4370}}), '''Katakoro''' had become a province of the eastern Upper Kingdom of the empire, home to the cities of [[Ormui]], [[Hoazyu]], and [[Auyzolu]].

The Imaskar Empire fell in {{Yearlink|-2488}}, but the eastern provinces of Katakoro and [[Khati]] emerged relatively unscathed. Thus, in {{Yearlink|-2487}}, [[Kujawa]] claimed power in Khati and declared himself Emperor, founding a new realm, [[Anok-Imaskar]], covering Katakoro. His empire would collapse with his death in {{Yearlink|-1943}}, leaving Katakoro's fate unrecorded.{{Speculation}}

===Modern History===
In [[1360 DR]], Raja [[Ambuchar Devayam]] of [[Solon]] led his [[undead]] armies in a conquest of [[Ra-Khati]] and a number of settlements on the Katakoro Plateau.
