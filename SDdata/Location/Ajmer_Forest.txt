The Ajmer Forest was located in northeast Durpar in the Shining Lands in 1367 DR.
This tropical rainforest was stiflingly hot and humid.
The Ajmer Forest was home to the only sizable community of elves within Durpar. These elves were unique among their kind in that they followed the teachings of Adama. The elves monitored the loggers to make sure they collected their timber in a manner that would allow the forest to recover quickly.
The southern regions of the forest were home to monsters and many exotic animals. It was even rumored that a rakshasa noble had a headquarters there.
