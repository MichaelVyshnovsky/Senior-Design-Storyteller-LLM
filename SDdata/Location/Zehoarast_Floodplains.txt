Zehoarast was a floodplain in northwestern Amn.
The Zehoarast Floodplains encompassed the lowlands between the River Esmel and the Small Teeth west of the Trade Way. The greater region of Zehoarastria was named after these plains.
The floodplains were formed by the overflow from the River Specie and the Imnestream in the spring. Because of the constant flooding, no settlements were found here however, when the land was dry, local shepherds and prospectors searched the land for nuggets of gold and silver that came down from the Small Teeth to the south. The plains were covered with swampy terrain, and quicksand could be found there.
