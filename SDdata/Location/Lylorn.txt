Lylorn was a port city and the largest, wealthiest, and most dominant of the confederation of the Dusk Ports on Laerakond.
The Lylar were proud people reputed as the boldest of Abeiran sailors and for easily drawing their swords for insults, imagined or real. Lylar pirates were a staple of Abeiran folklore.
Lylorn prosperity was achieved by sacrificing a large number of its own citizens to appease the green dragon Orlarrakh.
The Lylar favored walled rooftop gardens and interior courtyards in their arch-windowed homes made of stone. They decorated their homes with tapestries, carpets, and expensive statuettes and other luxuries.
In 1479 DR, Lylar merchants arrived in Luskan in hopes to arrange permanent trade routes between Laerakond and Faer√ªn, and to outmaneuver their rivals from Tarmalune, who arrived in Neverwinter with similar goals.
