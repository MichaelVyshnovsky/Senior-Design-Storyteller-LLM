'''Lylorn''' was a port city and the largest, wealthiest, and most dominant of the confederation of the [[Dusk Ports]] on [[Laerakond]].

==Background==
The Lylar were proud people reputed as the boldest of [[Abeir]]an sailors and for easily drawing their swords for insults, imagined or real. Lylar [[pirate]]s were a staple of Abeiran folklore.

Lylorn prosperity was achieved by sacrificing a large number of its own citizens to appease the [[green dragon]] [[Orlarrakh]].

==Architecture==
The Lylar favored walled rooftop gardens and interior courtyards in their arch-windowed homes made of stone. They decorated their homes with tapestries, carpets, and expensive statuettes and other luxuries.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Lylar merchants arrived in [[Luskan]] in hopes to arrange permanent trade routes between Laerakond and [[Faer√ªn]], and to outmaneuver their [[Tarmalune Trade House|rivals]] from [[Tarmalune]], who arrived in [[Neverwinter]] with similar goals.


==Notable inhabitants==
* [[Nandrel Gostur]], a head member of the [[Shadowkiss]] and one of the richest persons in the Dusk Ports.
* [[Zasheena Drethyl]], another head member of the Shadowkiss.
