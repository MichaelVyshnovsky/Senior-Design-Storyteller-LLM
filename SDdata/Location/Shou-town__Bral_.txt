'''Shou-town''' was a district in the city of [[Bral]] on the [[Rock of Bral]]. It was populated largely by [[Shou]] [[human]]s from [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]] on [[Toril]].

==Description==
The borders of Shou-town were [[Dock Street (Bral)|Dock Street]] on the leading-edge side, [[Grand Street]] on the starboard side, [[Dragon Street]] on the port side, and [[Eel Street]] on the trailing-edge side. It had a small open district square in the center.

The district was noisy and active, with busy folk going about their trades, while the [[tattoo]]ed Yakuza kept an eye on any visitors.

==Inhabitants==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Shou-town had a population of several hundred Shou immigrants, mostly those fleeing suffering on Toril on board departing [[spelljammer]]s and working for their passage, and the community seemed to be expanding daily. They were a close-knit community. However, the Yakuza quickly took hold in Shou-town and fought vicious battles to expand their territory.

Unlike [[Shou Lung]], Shou-town did not have nobles or noble warriors; its people were almost exclusively artisans and craftsmen.

==Government==
In practice, the district was ruled by the [[thieves' guild]] known as [[Yakuza (Bral)|the Yakuza]], and their leader [[Ozamata Ku Murawa]]. The Yakuza engaged in extortion, racketeering, and gambling.

However, Lord [[Chan Fu Wi]], the official emissary to Bral from the Emperor of Shou Lung, was the only true noble Shou in Bral. While he believed that arguing with the Yakuza over leadership of the Shou people was beneath him, were he to give an order to the inhabitants of Shou-town, it would almost certainly be obeyed. Nevertheless, no Shou would betray the dominant Yakuza.

* The [[Shou Embassy (Bral)|Shou Embassy]]
* [[Yakuza House]]
