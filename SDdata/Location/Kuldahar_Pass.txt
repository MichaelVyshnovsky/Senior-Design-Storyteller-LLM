'''Kuldahar Pass''' was a vale between [[Easthaven]] and [[Kuldahar]] in the [[Spine of the World]].{{Quote|The area of Kuldahar Pass that brushes the Spine of the World touches three places — Easthaven, Kuldahar Valley and the town of Kuldahar itself. Stick to this route as you travel through the region — straying from the road will fast bring danger to you, whether from the winter’s snows or the beasts that lurk in them.|Hrothgar, 1281 DR<ref>http://www.beamdog.com/files/iwdee/iwdee_manual1.pdf}}

==Geography== 
On the outskirts of the pass was a small mill, which was often used as a base for marauding [[goblin]]s.

==History==
[[File:Frost giants kuldahar pass.png|thumb|''[[Frost giant]]s, causing avalanche over the Kuldahar Pass.''|245x245px]]
Around [[1281 DR]], a large number of unusual disturbances began to occur in the pass. These included storms arriving without warning and lasting for days, goblins roaming the area in unusual numbers due to voices in their head drawing them to the area, and seemingly organized groups of [[giant]]s moving through the pass.

Around that year a band of [[adventurer]]s lead by [[Hrothgar]] were ambushed  in the pass on their way to [[Kuldahar]] by a group of [[frost giant]]s led by [[Kreg Frostbeard]], under orders by the [[devil]] [[Belhifet]] to cause an avalanche. In conjunction with the magic of [[Crenshinibon]], they managed to block off all access between Easthaven and Kuldahar.
