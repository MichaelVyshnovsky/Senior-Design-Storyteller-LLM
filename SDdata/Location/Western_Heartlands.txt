The '''Western Heartlands''' (originally "Hartlands" for the abundance of [[deer]]{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|92}}) was a region located in the [[West Faerûn|western]] portion of [[Faerûn]]. It stretched from the [[Sword Coast]] region at water's edge of the [[Sea of Swords]] in the west, to the [[Storm Horns|Storm Horn Mountains]] in the east. The region extended north until the [[Lizard Marsh]] of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], including the [[High Moor]] to the northeast, and went as far south to the [[Lands of Intrigue]] of [[Amn]], [[Tethyr]] and [[Calimshan]].

==Description==
Between the "miles and miles of miles and miles" of rolling hills, grassy flatlands, impassable marshes and monster-filled forests

===Flora & Fauna===
The [[Giant's Plain]] was home to large herds of migratory animals that traveled from the Western Heartlands. These beasts included [[rothé]], [[deer]], and [[boar]]s, that, in turn, served as a food source for the [[Sword Coast]] [[dragon]]s, who considered it to be their "happy hunting ground."{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-01-02 - Migratory Herds}}

==History==
For centuries, the western heartlands had never been to home to a unified kingdom. The separate but amenable towns along the [[Trade Way]] and [[Uldoon Trail]] existing in relative peace and reservation from one another. This dynamic changed after the [[Torm]]ish [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of [[Elturel]] united the surrounding towns and villages into the ''Kingdom of Two Suns'', [[Elturgard]]. 

Over the next century the [[serpentfolk]] kingdom of [[Najara]], grew in influence and power, with the [[yuan-ti]] and [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Serpent Hills]] and [[Forest of Wyrms]] uniting under the rule of [[Jarant|King Jarant]] in the {{yearlinkName|1474}}.

==Geography==
===Backlands===
{{Main|Backlands}}
Aside from the [[Savage Frontier]] to the northwest, the Backlands were considered the largest swath of wild, untamed frontier land in the western realms of Faerûn. It was infested with [[goblinoid]] raiders, malevolent beasts from the nearby [[Marsh of Chelimber]] and horrors from beyond [[Toril]]. While dangers could be found among the old ruins of ancient [[Netheril]], the presence of a an unusual number of ''[[gate]]s'' was postulated by [[sage]]s as the cause of the region's exorbitant number of monstrous beasts.

;Geographic Features:
* [[Forgotten Forest]]: This small patch of woodlands was home to a herd of [[treant]]s that fiercely defended their home from most [[humanoid]]s saved for a select few [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s.
* [[Greycloak Hills]]: The training grounds of the [[Evereska]]n [[elves]] was believed by some to hide an ancient [[arcane]] power, Netherese in origin.
* [[Trielta Hills]]: These foothills were home to a number of [[gnome]] and [[halfling]] communities, who lived idyllic lives free from any real threats.

;Landmarks:
* [[Battle of Bones]]: This battlefield was the result of a great battle between a horde of [[goblin]]s and [[orc]]s from the [[Stonelands]] and an alliance of devout humans, elves and dwarves in [[1090 DR]].
* [[Fallen Giant Tomb]]: This monument was formed in dedication to a great [[mountain giant]] chieftain.
* [[Skull Gorge]]: While there were rumors of tremendous treasure hidden in the part of the river that flowed through the gorge, its walls
* [[Well of Dragons]]: Buried beneath an ancient volcano, the graveyard of dragons was considered a holy site among the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

;Settlements:
* [[Drawn Swords]]: Like the nearby [[Battle of Bones]],

* [[Xonthal's Tower (village)|Xonthal's Tower]]: The villagers of this tiny hamlet lived in the immediate area surrounding the [[Xonthal's Tower|tower]] of the well-known [[mage]], [[Xonthal]].

===Elturgard===
{{main|Elturgard}}
The nation of Elturgard was formed from a collection of devout followers of [[Torm]], along with other goodly deities, that held onto their shared vision of a holy land in the western Realms. It was considered one of the safest havens in the Heartlands, as well as an example of the true greatness that could be achieved by humankind.

;Geographic Features:
* [[Fields of the Dead]]: This expanse of verdant farmland earned its name from the great number of old battles fought on its soil, dating from before the 9{{th}} century DR. 
* [[Reaching Woods]]: A number of humanoid races, including elves, humans and even [[gnoll]]s maintained shrines to their respective deities within this large forest.

;Landmarks:
* [[Fort Morninglord]]: This since-abandoned fort once housed a contingent of Tormite [[paladin]]s, before they all mysteriously disappeared in [[1476 DR]].

;Settlements:
* [[Elturel]]: Resting on a hill under the warm illumination of [[the Companion]], the capital of Torm's kingdom was a beacon of vigilant safety that extended out to the surrounding towns, until it was pulled from the face of Toril down into the [[Nine Hells]].
* [[Scornubel]]: The ''City of Caravans'' was a haven for the rough-and-tumble outlanders, wayfarer and merchants of the Western Heartlands and beyond, much to the chagrin of the [[High Observer]] of Elturgard.
* [[Soubar]]: This stopover settlement located on the Trade Way was home to the [[Black Abbey]], a long-abandoned monastery of [[Bane]].
* [[Triel]]: Located on the Trade Way, this village acted as a grain repository for the farmers for the region.

===Najara===
{{Main|Najara}}
Despite its vast expanse, the ''Kingdom of Serpents'', comprised of [[naga]]s, [[yuan-ti]], [[lizardfolk]] and other [[scalykind]], existed merely as rumors and hushed warnings to the other denizens of the Western Heartlands. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, King Jarant sent yuan-ti ambassadors to neighboring kingdoms and city-states with a clear message that declared their sovereignty and dictated the terms of their diplomatic relations.

;Geographic Features:
* [[Forest of Wyrms]]: This dark and dense forest of great [[redwood]] and [[pine]] trees was home to a great number of monstrous serpents, yuan-ti and even [[green dragon]]s; it was believed one of these wyrms changed the inherent physiology of these serpentine creatures.

;Settlements:
* [[Ss'khanaja]]: Located mostly beneath the Winding Water, this subterranean city served as the capital of the Najaran kingdom, where King Jarant held court.

===Sword Coast===
{{Main|Sword Coast}}
The Sword Coast was a land of powerful city-states, that attracted people from diverse backgrounds, interspersed among stretches of perilous wilderness.

;Geographic Features:
* [[Cloak Wood]]: An ancient forest, home to vicious beasts and enigmatic [[fey]], that was rumored to contain several ''[[portal]]''s that linked to other regions of Faerûn.
* [[River Chionthar]]: This key river allowed for the transport of goods from Baldur's Gate to cities of Elturgard and the Sunset Vale.
* [[Delimbiyr]]: This forking river flowed from the [[High Moor]] to the [[Lizard Marsh]] and the Sea of Swords.

* [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]]: This smaller forest was rumored to be the hunting grounds for a number of dire beasts, [[hydra]]s and even dragons.

;Landmarks:
* [[Dragonspear Castle]]: In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, [[Priest]]s of [[Tempus]] established a shrine within the famous fortress to act as a bulwark against the hordes of fiends that continuously clawed their way out of the [[portal]] found within.
* [[Durlag's Tower]]: This dark keep, the former stronghold of [[Durlag Trollkiller]], has been taken over by dragons, [[illithid]]s and [[Will-o'-wisp]]s since the dwarven hero went mad.
* [[Moonrise Towers]]: A fortress that was once a base of the [[High Heralds]] and of [[House Thorm]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and later infamously became the seat of power for the [[Cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>
* [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]]: Founded in the 11{{th}} century DR, this magical academy was subsequently destroyed and deteriorated to a state of infested ruins.
* [[Warlock's Crypt]]: Comprised of a series of [[mage]] towers, the resting place of the ancient [[sorcerer]]-king of Netheril, [[Larloch]], was crawling with a legion of horrors, including liches, [[vampire]]s, [[wraith]]s and lesser [[undead]].

* [[Baldur's Gate]]: The largest city in all of Faerûn, ''The Gate'' was a prosperous city of commerce an opportunity, that offered near-endless possibilities to its citizens.
* [[Beregost]]: Located on the [[Coast Way]], this small town was protected by the nearby clergy of [[Lathander]].

[[Coast Way]] • [[Risen Road]] • [[Trade Way]]

===Sunset Vale===
The rolling knolls and vast stretches of wilderness of the [[Sunset Vale|Vale]] were accentuated by a pair of large cities settled on the [[River Chionthar]]. The area between them, full of prosperous and well-protected farms, served as the bread basket for the surrounding lands, shipping their goods as far away as Amn. Roaming bands of bandits, [[goblin]]s and [[wemic]]s kept the roads well-traveled and acted as a buffer against possible invasions from the nearby powers of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

;Geographic features
* [[Far Hills]]: Nearly mountains themselves, these rocky crags west of the Sunsets were kept clear of travelers by the ominous presence of [[Darkhold]].

* [[Sunset Mountains]]:

* [[Iriaebor]]: The ''City of a Thousand Spires'' was an independent city-state that housed a number of rival merchant houses whose decades-long bickering prevented its leadership from having a greater influence in the region.
