            "Flora & Fauna": "The coastline had a population of hungry [[seagull]]s and majestic [[osprey]]s that used updrafts to glide over the clifftops. An occasional [[wild boar]] or [[deer]] could be seen dashing through bushes of small delicate grey grapes with wide green leaves not found anywhere else on [[Faerûn]], used to create the famed [[Exeltis Ice Wine]]. The sea caves were home to dangerous [[ochre jellies]]."

The family became its decline after the scion of the Exeltis family murdered his father and, several years later, tossed his mother off the Blade Cliffs. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Castle Exeltis became besieged by Sir [[Griswald]] and his knights seeking to rescue his kidnapped lover.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Feldran Exeltis]], the murderous noble scion of the Exeltis family in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Nosfiraat]], a [[vampire]] trapped within the crashed ship, possibly slain in 1372 DR.\n*[[Wogbog]], a hungry hermit who lived in a tent not far from the sea ''circa'' 1372 DR.\n*[[Xianga]] and [[Beb-Shuur]], two dim-witted members of the so-called [[Order of Theorosophers]] ''circa'' 1372 DR."
