'''Phlan''', also known as the '''Jewel of the Moonsea''',{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|52}} was a large frontier town on the [[Moonsea]] region of [[north Faerûn]] with a long and storied history. This led to the Phlan being walled off into two sections for many years, comprising the vast ruined neighborhoods of [[Phlan/Old Phlan|Old Phlan]] and the resilient community of [[Phlan/Civilized Phlan|Civilized Phlan]], before becoming a whole and peaceful city once again. Phlan enjoyed military and economic prosperity for many years,{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|54}} before deteriorating into a criminal state afflicted by the machinations of a [[Cult of the Dragon|dangerous cult]].

In addition to being a monument to the stubbornness of the Moonsea people, the city was famous as the home of one of the fabled ''[[pools of radiance]]'', the source of power for a legendary [[Tyranthraxus|otherworldly spirit]].

==Description==
[[File:Phlan 1360s.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Phlan ''circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]]]
Phlan was founded atop ''[[Valjevo Isle]]'', a small isle within the delta formed by the mouth of the [[Stojanow]] river and grew around the isle's [[Valjevo Castle|namesake castle]].

''Circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Phlan was divided into two prominent areas, the walled off [[Phlan/Old City|Old City]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|60}} encompassing both Old Phlan and Civilized Phlan,{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|52}}{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|47}} The city was then divided into a number of separate wards, such as the poorer [[Phlan/Slum District|Slum District]], the seaside [[Phlan/Dock District|Dock District]], and the affluent [[Phlan/Nobles' Quarter|Nobles' Quarter]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|55}}{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|53}}

For many years the streets of Old Phlan were overrun by monstrous creatures creating a hellish landscape that was entirely inhospitable for the trapping of civilization.,{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

The entirety Phlan was a city built upon the ruins of its past, in the most literal meaning. Beneath Phlan was an aging [[sewer|sewer system]] with a spillway that opened up into the Stojanow River.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|19}}

Phlan ran several ferries across the river, connecting the Old City with the growing Nobles' Quarter. In the 14{{th}} century DR, there were at least two ferries. However, by the late 15{{th}} century DR, two bridges were constructed, making travel between the two parts of the city quicker.

In the 14{{th}} century DR, the Dock District consisted of two areas, eastern and western Phlan, separated by a wall and two sets of gates: the [[Traitor's Gate]] on the northern end and the [[Parkside Gate]] on the southern end. The Parkside gate was named for the [[Valhegen Park]] that stood between the two gates, while the Traitor's Gate bore the name of disgraced First Councilman [[Porphyrys Cadorna]]. The westernmost gate that led into the city was known as [[Kuto's Gate]].

==Geography==
Phlan was located at a point on the northern coast of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]], within the inlet of the [[Bay of Phlan]].{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|12}}{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} The stunning monument known as the [[King's Pyre]] was built into a cliff overlooking the sea, some {{SI|40|mi|k}} west of Phlan.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|11}}

Just north of the city were a cluster of farms nestled along either side of the Stojanow River and the [[Stojanow Trail]]. This trail continued north with the river along the western side of the Quivering Forest.

The trade way called [[Iron Route]] ran westward along the Moonsea to Zhentil Keep. The trade way going eastward towards Melvaunt were called [[Phlan Path]], connected to the northward trail called [[Toranth's March]] that continued along the eastern eaves of the Quivering Forest towards the Dragonspine Mountains and the Ride. 

===Flora & Fauna===
The sewers of Phlan were known to be infested with [[carrion crawler]]s.

==Government==
As of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], Phlan was governed by a ruling body known as the [[Council of Ten]], composed of judges that presided over the city's courts. An individual referred to as "Number One" served as the head of the council while also holding the officer of town mayor. The council had a high turnover rate, as no-confidence elections were held regularly for even the smallest of mishaps.

The oligarchy of Phlan ended in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, when [[Zhentarim]] Hatemaster [[Cvaal Daoran]] broke up the council and declared himself as Lord Protector of Phlan. Sovereignty of Phlan remained in the Daoran family lineage for decades, as Lord Cvaal was succeeded by his son [[Talaric Daoran|Talaric]] and later his grandson [[Anivar Daoran|Anivar]]. By the 15{{th}} century DR, the city-state had acquired the the vassalage of several communities north of the Dragonspines, namely [[Ilinvur]], [[Verdigris]], and [[Whitehorn]].

===Law & Order===
A [[thieves' guild]] called the [[Welcomers]] operated openly within the city throughout its history,{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|20}} the members of which cut off their left ear as a sign of loyalty. As most residents of the town were aware of the guild, the guild earned its name by preying on visitors to the city.

==Trade==
[[File:Stormy Bay.png|thumb|right|300px|''Map of the lands surrounding Phlan, along with notable trade routes (north oriented to the left).'']]
Phlan was known as a stopping point for caravans conducting overland trade across the trade routes and trails of the Moonsea North. 

As of the late 15{{th}} century Phlan enjoyed a century of steady rule and no disastrous events, allowing trade and commerce to flourish. The city received caravan shipments of valuable ore and gems from its mining communities to the north, protected by the barbarous warriors of the Ride.

===Travel Distances From Phlan===
* To [[Zhentil Keep]] - {{SI|70|mi|k}} along the the [[Iron Route]]{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|57}}
* To [[Castle Vathar]] - {{SI|65|mi|k}} along [[Toranth's March]]
* To [[Melvaunt]] - {{SI|55|mi|k}} along the [[Phlan Path]]

==Defense==
Phlan boasted great city walls that were considered by many to be its greatest defense against invaders, especially during the years when little military force could be mustered.

For many years leading up to the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Phlan's city guard comprised a militia force just over a hundred strong, though a local clan of [[dwarves]] led by [[Deryk Stoneshaper]] pledged 100 of his men as help to the city for some time.

During the Zhent occupation of the 1380s, the [[Knights of the Black Fist]] took over as Phlan's military force.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|29}} but eventually garnered a reputation for corruption.{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|12}} The [[Black Watch]] militia was the branch of the Black Fists that served as Phlan's city guard.

Despite having served as the fighting force of Phlan for a century's time, the Black Fist was faced with competing military interests that arose ''circa''[[1480 DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|5}} The [[Red Plumes]] of [[Hillsfar]] maintained a barracks in the city, and the [[Vilhon Mercenary Corps]] were reportedly formed specifically to to undermine the strength of the Black Fist.

==Society==
Like many settlements of the [[Moonsea North]], the people of Phlan possessed an streak of individualism and sort of chaotic freedom that allowed them to survive the harsh life associated with their homeland in the Realms.<ref name=FRCS3e-p159">

A large settlement that had many residents from different parts where the bulk are humans and dwarves, with a sizable population of halflings.

===Culture===
The city of Phlan was the origin of the game of [[Old Men's Bones]], which was played all over Faerûn.

===Religion===
During the mid-14{{th}}, a Banite cult that venerated [[Iyachtu Xvim]] as an aspect of the Dark Lord established theirs as the official religion of Phlan.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|80}} The worship of Bane returned to the city following the takeover by the Zhentarim, albeit a more moderate view of his dogma extolling discipline and deference to one's lords. Bane faith continued to be practiced, albeit discreetly, over the course of the next century.

The [[Most Solemn Order of the Silent Shroud]] was a group of worshipers of [[Kelemvor]] whom Cvaal Daoran gave the responsibility of the care of [[Valhingen Graveyard]].<ref>{{cite web/Phlan during the Tyranny of Dragons}} They continued as its caretakers over the course of the next century.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|7}}

As of the late 15{{th}} century, devotees of [[Shar]] were explicitly prohibited from worshiping within the city's borders, and they were actively persecuted.

==History==
===Founding===
Phlan was founded in the {{yearlinkName|367}}, as a trading outpost between the [[elves]] of [[Myth Drannor]] and the [[dwarves]] of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].

Phlan was leveled for the first time in the {{YearlinkName|400}}, during the [[First Turnabout]], a massive attack by the [[Dark Alliance]] of humanoids who swept down onto the Moonsea region to attack [[Northkeep]]. 

===Reconstruction & Repeated Destruction===
{{Quote|Next time the city is rebuilt, I think the natives should just knock the buildings right down again and save the next invaders the trouble.|[[Orgil]], captain of the ''[[Devawing]]''.}}
After three centuries of laying in ruin, [[Milsor|Milsor the Valjevo]] had the city rebuilt in the {{yearlinkName|712}}, and commissioned the construction of the magnificent [[Valjevo Castle]], that was completed [[730 DR|eighteen years later]]. After the abandonment of [[Hillsafar]] following the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the {{YearlinkName|714}}, refugees poured into Phlan and it grew to be the largest settlement on the north shore of the Moonsea.

In the {{yearlinkName|902}}, the [[Zhentilar]] made the first of many attempts to conquer their eastern neighbor, claiming that citizens of Phlan had raided their territory (though this claim was likely erroneous) but didn't count on Phlan's ally [[Melvaunt]] disrupting their siege. A four-year war resulted in Phlan becoming a reluctant signatory to the [[Treaty of the Ride]] in [[906 DR]], which saw Zhentarim influence over the city increase dramatically.

Along with the other powers of the Moonsea, Phlan sent a contingent of soldiers to rebuild and occupy the [[Citadel of the Raven]] fortress within the western [[Dragonspine Mountains]] in the {{YearlinkName|1276}}.  

The {{yearlinkName|1303}}, saw the second destruction of Phlan, as [[ogres]] completely overran the city that was unprepared for such an assault. Phlan was rapidly rebuilt by the stubborn survivors, just in time for the city to enter into the [[Moonsea War]] with their neighboring city-states [[1306 DR|three years later]]. While the cities of [[Hulburg]] and [[Sulasspryn]] were conquered by [[Mulmaster]], Phlan joined into an alliance with Hillsfar, Melvaunt, Sembia, and even their former foes in Zhentil Keep to put down the Mulmastan forces.  

Just as the war ended in the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, Phlan was invaded by a great host of [[dragon]]s and their armies from the lands of Thar known as the [[Dragon Run]]. As the Moonsea's other powers were recovering from the brief war that just flared up and ceased, Phlan received no help from neighboring city-states. For the third time in its history, and the second time in three years, Phlan was left to ruin – though this time, all of its citizens were slaughtered ''en masse''.

===Threat of Tyranthraxus===
[[File:Renotheblade PoR.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Ren o' the Blade]] and the spirit [[Tyranthraxus]] in the body of the [[bronze dragon]] [[Srossar]].]]
While it is not known how much of a hand the spirit of the [[yugoloth]]-like extraplanar entity [[Tyranthraxus]] had in the Dragon Run, around the same time, it managed to trick the ancient [[bronze dragon]] [[Srossar]] into bathing in the ''[[pool of radiance]]'', a portal to an unknown dark plane underneath the [[Valjevo Castle]]. When the dragon entered the pool, Tyranthraxus took possession of the dragon and commenced immediately to build an army of monsters for the subjugation of Faerûn.

By the year {{yearlinkName|1340}}, Tyranthraxus had near complete control of Phlan with the exception of the area of the city near the docks known as "Civilized Phlan". Using those few city blocks as their base of operations, a new City Council formed by children of the original merchants of Phlan and new speculators formed, and attempted to reclaim the city. [[Adventurer]]s flocked to Phlan to help clear these monsters out in return for the generous bounty offered by the new Council.

Using the services of a [[Heroes of Phlan|trio of adventurers]] to clear out the occupied areas of the city, Councilman [[Porphyrys Cadorna]] quickly rose to the position of First Councilman.  By this time, the adventurers had succeeded in retaking most of the city, though Tyranthraxus still remained under Valjevo Castle in control of the ''pool of radiance''. After learning of the existence of the Pool, Cardona became obsessed with it, wishing to use its it power to expand his own. When the possessed dragon was finally defeated by the adventurers, Cadorna attempted to seize control of the pool, only to be possessed himself by Tyranthraxus and forced to its waters, teleporting him the fallen councilman to the plane Tyranthraxus called home.

===Seizure by Bane===
The {{yearlinkName|1350}} saw a scheme by the god [[Bane]] to ''teleport'' Phlan and several other Moonsea cities from their locations to serve as soul farms to the Lord of Darkness in [[Banehold]]. The [[Thayan]] [[Red Wizard]] [[Marcus]] and the [[pit fiend]] [[Tanetal]] were charged with taking Phlan, but defied Bane's initial command of teleporting the city to Bane's realm. Instead, the two moved Phlan into a cavern underneath the Red Wizard's tower southeast of Zhentil Keep. They planned to feed souls of the residents of Phlan to the ''pool of darkness'' to increase their own powers before handing it over to Bane.

Marshaling the defenses of the city was the wizard [[Shal Bal]] and the cleric of [[Tyr]] [[Tarl Desanea]], two of the three Heroes of Phlan that freed the city from Tyranthraxus a decade earlier. With the two heroes leading the defense, Marcus and Tanetal were unable to take control of the city, despite numerous full assaults and the fact that the city was trapped directly under Marcus' tower.

Meanwhile, the third member of the legendary group, [[Ren o' the Blade]], went in search of the city after its disappearance. Aided by two [[druids]] under directions from [[Silvanus]], an [[undead]] [[paladin]] of Tyr named [[Miltiades]], and a wizard named [[Evaine]], Ren managed to find the tower and joining with Tarl and Shal, was able to defeat the Red Wizard and send the pit fiend back to the [[Nine Hells]]. The defeat of Marcus and Tanetal broke the spell holding the city under the tower and the city was returned to its former location on the Moonsea.

After being annihilated three times in its history, and transported to another location in the Realms, Phlan was almost entirely destroyed yet again during the [[Rage of Dragons]] that devastated the Eastern Heartlands in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}. 

While the city lay in ruin for at least a year, At the same time however, the nearby powers of Zhentil Keep and Hillsfar vied for influence and control of its citizens, who were merely trying to reclaim their former lives. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Phlan was considered to be an exciting place that was well in the highs of its great reconstruction. The city proudly held onto an atmosphere of hope and drive for renewed wealth and success. Many people believed this collective feeling could be attributed to the rapidly-growing number of [[Tyr]]ran faithful in the city.

In {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the dreaded ''pool of radiance'' reemerged underneath Valjevo Castle. A thief named [[Kestrel]] witnessed its corrupted magical waters consuming three criminals and reluctantly decided to inform [[Elminster Aumar]] of the returned danger. As the ''pool's'' power grew, it started seeping life out of residents of Phlan and started to spawn undead. Elminster assembled a team of adventurers, helmed by [[Athan]] and entrusted him with the ''[[Gauntlets of Moander]]'' to venture into the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] from whence the corruption of reemerged ''pool of radiance'' originated. As Athan's band fell in combat, the ''pools'' spread across other cities of the Moonsea, and the new makeshift heroes emerged. Kestrel, [[Corran D'Arcey]], [[Durwyn]], and [[Ghleanna Stormlake]] became known as the [[Veiled Ones]] and eventually succeeded in destroying the ''pool of radiance'' corrupted by the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

===Zhent Occupation===
By [[Tarsakh 3]] of {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Phlan had been fully conquered by the forces of Zhentil Keep. After [[1380 DR|five years]], the city government was dissolved to be replaced by the tyranny of Cvaal Daoran when he dissolved the Council of Ten and name himself the Lord Protector of Phlan.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|5}}

During the [[Shadowbane War]] of [[1383 DR]] however, Cvaal forged an alliance with the [[dark fey]] of the Quivering Forest,{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|5}} and managed to slay a [[Princes of Shade|Shadovar prince]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|65}} thereby ensuring that his city did not meet the same fate as Zhentil Keep.{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|6}} The hearts of his subjects softened thanks to his valiant defense of the city and they accepted his rule with little complaint, allowing his dynasty to claim rights as monarchs. In turn, the rule of Cvaal's government and that of the local church of Bane also softened.

The next several decades saw the Netherese and the elves of [[Myth Drannor]] quietly trying to exert their influence over the city, but neither of them could claim any real successes.

===Prosperity & Decline===
{{Quote|Does the Lord Regent fear this wild dog? Are his hired goons cowed by their own castoffs?|A citizen of Phlan yelling during the riots of the 1480's DR.}}

In the {{yearlinkName|1456}}, Cvaal's son [[Talaric Daoran]] decided to send loggers into the Quivering Forest,{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|21}} voiding his father's agreement with the fey; Talaric mysteriously disappeared that night, never to be seen again, and was succeeded by his son Anivar.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|81}}

A few decades later, in the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, raids by local [[barbarian]] tribes on the small settlements on the borders of [[the Ride]] sent waves of refugees to Phlan. Lord Anivar Daoran refused to offer shelter to any more of its displaced citizens and forced the city into a lockdown.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|50}} While the Lord Protector worked with a band of [[adventurer]]s to uncover the cause of the barbarian raids, they were sealed out of the city and forced to use their wits to save Phlan on their own accord.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|59}} Fortunately for the Lord Protector and the city's people, the heroes were successful and Phlan was spare destruction for a fifth time.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|64}}

Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1486}},{{ToD-time}} Anivar Daoran died in an apparent accident while overseeing renovations on Valjevo Castle; as Anivar had sired no heirs, [[Ector Brahms]], Knight Commander of the Banite [[Knights of the Black Fist]], was declared Lord Regent. As Ector's grasp on power was weak, he quickly established martial law to enforce his will—a deeply unpopular move.{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|6}} Riots broke out throughout Phlan,{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|7}} involving the looting and destruction of the [[Lyceum of the Black Lord]], and traders began to avoid business in the city.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|64}}

{{fq| text = I was loading a galley—the ''[[Gilded Trophy]]''—at the docks to transport what coin and important persons of our organization that I have been able to muster to safety in [[Mulmaster]] when the docks were taken by [[Knights of the Black Fist]]...They are dragging away dock workers and the crews of other vessels; I have no doubt that they will soon come for us next. | source = [[Dornal Whitebeard]], recounting the takeover by the [[Tears of Virulence]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|38}} | float = | width = | styles = }}
With so little trade, the formerly prosperous city began to decline. The city's guilds decided to concentrate on profiteering instead of cooperating with each other to stabilize the city. Construction efforts were left stagnating, people lost their jobs, and market prices rose dramatically. While the Knights of the Black Fist struggled to maintain a semblance of order, rival factions began forwarding their own interests. As the Welcomers became politically active, criminal deeds and acts of violence became commonplace, legitimate trade became illegal in nature, and the black market became the only reliable way to turn a profit in the city.>{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|7}} 

As Phlan rapidly devolved into a crime-infested cesspool, other nefarious groups like the reborn [[Cult of the Dragon]] began operating throughout the city. While some cultists sought a giant scale that was said to have been from the hide of [[Tiamat]] herself,{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5}} others wanted the power of the ''pool of radiance'' beneath Castle Valjevo for their own nefarious plot.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|6}} While Lord Regent Ector Brahms sought one final act to restore order in Phlan, the cult's [[green dragon]] patron [[Vorgansharax]] set his eyes on the city for himself,{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|5}} and laid claim as its tyrant with the aid of [[Tears of Virulence|loyalist Black Fist soldiers]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|10}}{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|18}} Unbeknownst to many, the dragon harbored the spirit of Tyranthraxus, the entity that plagued the city of Phlan a century earlier. 

After months of occupation, Knight Commander [[Jhessail Greycastle]] marshalled an alliance of forces from across the Moonsea North to take back the streets of Phlan and take back Valjevo Castle from the malevolent Tyranthraxus and its green dragon host.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|2}}

==Rumors & Legends==
For many years, local legends stated that a great treasure remain unclaimed within the depths of [[Sokol Keep]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, these rumors waned somewhat, though some people still believed.{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|5}}
