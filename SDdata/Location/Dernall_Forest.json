        "mainbody": "ernall Forest was a woodland on the isle of Alaron in the Moonshae Isles circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR.\nThis forest covered a large portion of central Alaron. The Swanmay River flowed through it from roughly northwest to southeast. It was also traversed north to south by High Kings Road. Its northern boundary was the foothills of the Fairheight Range. On the west side was the Drowned Forest and some coastal towns. The eastern border faded into the fields of Talffolk and the southern border was bound by the rolling hills of Stirgewick. Caer Callidyrr, the capital of the Moonshaes, stood on the northeast edge of the forest. The Dernall Forest touched the western border of the Central Plains.\nIn 1479 DR, the Dernall Forest was under siege by creatures sent through a rift from the Feywild by Great Gark, the Goblin King of Nachtur. The breach in planar integrity was deep in the heart of the forest and the troops of House Kendrick were hard pressed to repel the growing evil presence.\n* Bounty a village on the High Kings Road.\n* Caer Callidyrr the capital city.\n* Doncastle a city on the Swanmay River.\n* Hickorydale a village near the Drowned Forest.\n* Horsa a city on the High Kings Road.\n* Lehigh a village on the High Kings Road.\n* Ogden a city on the High Kings Road.\nBy the 1300s DR, the forest had become a dangerous place due to the presence of bandits and outlaws who struck fear even in the hearts of the High Kings soldiers. One of these brigand leaders, more honorable than many, was a man named ORoarke who had been outlawed by High King Carrathal for voicing his firm conviction that Carrathal was not a legitimate ruler of the Ffolk. \nAs of 1479 DR, creatures reported to be in the forest included fomorians, and worgs."
