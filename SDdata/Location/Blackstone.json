        "mainbody": "Blackstone was a small mining town located in the kingdom of Callidyrr on the island of Alaron within the Moonshae Isles.\nBlackstone was nestled on the far southwestern end of the Fairheight Range in northern Callidyrr overlooking the border with Gnarhelm. The town served as the start for the western branch of the High Kings Road.\nThe road leading to Blackstone from Caer Callidyrr was well-maintained and paved with white granite. Blackstone appeared to be more of a collection of provision shops, with housing added as an afterthought. Black smoke from the nearby mines permeated the valley where Blackstone was located."
