The '''Cold Run''' was a large stretch of frigid tundra that ran from the mouth of the [[Iceflow]] to [[Icewind Dale]].

==Geography==
The region, which spanned from the Iceflow up to Icewind Dale, was almost always deadly cold. However, in the peak of summer, the [[Trackless Sea]] often brought fairly warm winds.

==History==
Long ago, part of the Cold Run was struck by either a heavy meteor strike or the lava of a volcanic eruption. This formed a huge crater, which was filled with rich ore. Miners moved in to the area and established Fireshear.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Ironmaster]]
* [[Fireshear]]
* [[Auckney]]

==Inhabitants==
The native inhabitants of the region were the [[Ice Hunters]]. When the [[Northlander]]s 
arrived in the region, their expansion drove the natives even further up the Cold Run.

[[Tundra yeti]]s were known to roam around the Cold Run, as well as [[wolves]] and [[reindeer]].
