Though blessed with fertile grazing areas and fruit orchards around it, and rich clays for pottery in its river valley, the city was characterized by the brooding mood of its ruler and citizens. Their main motivation was said to be the search for spiritual betterment, so Fahhas was called \"City of Searching\".",
