'''Cormanthyr''' ({{Pronounce|kor|man|THEER|refs=<ref name=LEoF-127">}}) is one of many [[Tel'Quessir]] ([[elf|elven]] and [[eladrin]]) empires that have graced [[Faerûn]]. For much of recent history it has been in ruin, though recently it has risen again under a new [[Coronal]]. Its capital, [[Cormanthor_(city) | Cormanthor]], was the first of any city to have a [[mythal]] created by [[magic|wizardry]], whereas previously, all mythals were created by elven [[High Magic]].  After the mythal was raised the capital was referred to as [[Myth Drannor]].{{fact}}

==History==
{{main|History of Cormanthyr}}

The history of the elven realm of Cormanthyr spans more than five millennia and dates back to the ancient forest of [[Arcorar]] where fledgling elven realms born from the [[Crown Wars]] existed.{{fact}}

===Pre-History and Early History===
Cormanthyr was formed from four existing elven realms settled in the forest of [[Arcorar]], which would later become [[Cormanthor]]. The existing realms were [[Elven Court]], [[Semberholme]], [[Uvaeren]], and [[Jhyrennstar]]. Problems began arising for the realms, including a meteor that destroyed Uvaeren and a drow incursion into Elven Court, and the [[Coronal]] [[Oacenth]] of Jhyrennstar, as a prophet of [[Labelas Enoreth]], requested the creation of the [[Elfblade | Elfblades]] to determine a ruler who would unite the tribes to fight their foes together.  [[Kahvoerm Irithyl]] was the first to draw the [[Rulers' Blade]], and became to first Coronal of Cormanthyr in {{Yearlink|-4000}}.

The early millennia of Cormanthyr were relatively uneventful.  The title of Coronal was passed on through five more elves by {{Yearlink|-223}}, when [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] took the throne. During this time, most of their conflicts came with the drow, who built the [[Twisted Tower]] and effected raids upon the elves and surrounding lands. Also during this time, the humans and dwarves began to settle on the fringes of Cormanthor, which made the elves nervous but led to Eltargrim's most renowned changes.{{fact}}

===The Age of Alliance and the Decline===
Following his interpretation of Coronal Oacenth's wishes, Eltargrim decided to embrace the approach of other races rather than be in conflict with them.  In [[220 DR]], he opened the forests to any non-elf wizards and druids as well as non-human settlers. By [[261 DR]], he extended the [[Opening]] to the city of Myth Drannor despite rebellion and attacks on his life, and the city flourished for four hundred years.

However, in [[661 DR]], four centuries after the Opening, Eltargrim died, leaving a lone heir, [[Aravae Irithyl]], who was unready to take the throne. Three years later, she was murdered, and left no heir.

===The Fall of Myth Drannor and the Retreat===
In [[711 DR]], the [[Army of Darkness]], led by the [[Trio Nefarious]] (recently released from their prison above Myth Drannor) attacked Cormanthyr in what became known as the [[Weeping War]]. The elves fought bravely and slew all three of the [[Nycaloth | nycaloths]] who led the army, but ultimately Myth Drannor fell under fiendish control in [[714 DR]], and the realm fell into shambles.

For centuries to follow, the elves tried to contain the fiendish evil in Myth Drannor, having moved their power base to Elven Court.  The realm became scattered and divided, and ultimately in [[1344 DR]] the elves began the [[Retreat]], when more than 90% of their population abandoned Cormanthor's woods for other settlements in the west. The dream that was Cormanthyr was over.

===Modern Conflicts and the Revival===
The woods of Cormanthor became infested with [[drow]] after the retreat, who moved into the abandoned habitats of their kin. These drow attempted to seize the mythals and use the power for their own purposes.  However, their plans never came to fruition as Myth Drannor was invaded by [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] and her [[Daemonfey]], who attempted to take control of the region in [[1374 DR]]. In a complicated conflict involving the [[Zhentarim]], [[Sembia]] and [[Hillsfar]], the [[Dales]], as well as an [[Elven Crusade]] from [[Evermeet]] and their allies in [[Evereska]], the [[Cormanthor War]] was fought in the woods and surrounding [[Dales]]. Eventually, [[House Dlardrageth]] fell to the Crusade, which became the Army of Myth Drannor led by [[Ilsevele Miritar]].  The Army of Myth Drannor eventually defeated the [[Zhentarim]] and seized control of Cormanthyr for the first time in seven centuries. In [[1377 DR]], the Srinshee returned and granted the Rulers' Blade to Ilsevele, who drew it successfully and became the first Coronal of the [[Present Age]].

In [[1487 DR]], after years of war against Netheril, [[Thultanthar]] fell upon Myth Drannor, destroying both cities and thereby the second Cormanthyr. Ilsevele and her surviving subjects fled to [[Semberholme]].

==Notable Locations==
===Elven Court===
The [[Elven Court]] was once where elves sought advice and decided justice. It was the seat of power for its realm until it joined Cormanthyr during its founding but remained a place of council for the elves. After the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], it became the seat of power for the elves again.

===Myth Drannor===
The former capital, [[Myth Drannor]], was once considered the most beautiful and largest of any of the cities in [[Faerûn]]. Unfortunately, the city was reduced to ruins for centuries following the [[Weeping War]] and its subsequent infestation by fiends and monsters. The city was once protected by a magical ''[[mythal]]'' that shielded Myth Drannor from harm, though the ''mythal'' languished in disrepair. In the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, it was finally reclaimed by the elves under [[Ilsevele Miritar]], the future of this city was bright.<ref> but was devastated again in the {{yearlinkName|1487}}, when [[Thultanthar]] fell upon it.

===Semberholme===
[[Semberholme]] occupied the forests around [[Lake Sember]] atop a hilly region in southwestern Cormanthyr. During the height of Cormanthyr, it was a place of refuge for women, children, and the sick of the elven lands, as well as a haven with hidden limestone caverns where elves could hide in the event of war or disaster. It remained largely hidden and secret throughout most of its history.

===Tangled Trees===
The [[Tangled Trees]] was a hidden realm in Cormanthyr where the worship of [[Rillifane Rallathil]] was dominant. The place was largely xenophobic, and many non-elves had been attacked or killed in efforts to enter the place.
