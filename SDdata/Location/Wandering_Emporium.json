        "mainbody": "he Wandering Emporium was a traveling bazaar of merchants, creatives, and miscreants that wandered the infernal realm of Avernus in the Nine Hells. The master of this marketplace was the rakshasa Mahadi, a servant of the devilish god Asmodeus.\nThe emporium was a welcoming place in the otherwise perilous and horrifying plane of Avernus. It was considered neutral ground that offered respite from the hells many conflicts, most predominantly the Blood War.\nThe emporium traveled across Avernus using nine massive infernal war machines. When Mahadi chose, the monstrous vehicles came to a halt and formed a semi-circular perimeter. Within this makeshift barricade the markets vividly-colored tents were thrown up and the emporium opened for business. \nIt was illuminated by dangling lights, emanated exotic scents, and featured rhythmic music that drew in nearby denizens and travelers.\nThe emporium had no permanent location in Avernus, but wandered around under the direction of its master.\nFirst and foremost, Mahadi used the emporium as a means to gather souls for his master Asmodeus. The rakshasa did this by presenting mortals with an infernal contract that had to be willingly signed. The contract granted them a boon, such as a powerful magical item or the resurrection of a loved one, in exchange for their eternal soul. \nTo fulfil this duty and complete his deals, Mahadi was allowed to openly travel between Avernus and the Prime Material plane.\n* Firesnake Forge The salamanders that serviced the emporiums war machines also sold weapons and armor to its patrons. \n* From Here to Avernus FhetAhla the amnizu offered currency exchange and messengers in exchange for soul coins, preferably those that contained the souls of celestial beings.\n* Ichors Aweigh! Owing a significant financial debt to Mahadi, the human mage Elliach sold ichor here. He had been grotesquely transformed by exposure to the ichor he sold.\n* Infernal Rapture This restaurant and spa was run by Mahadi himself and existed as its own demiplane separate from Avernus.\n* Zneths larva farm Ripped away from the battlefields of Toril, the warlord Zneth was forced to run this piddling business pay back his debts.\nThe emporium was occupied by the merchants who peddled their goods and services within, along with the devilish drivers who piloted its infernal war machines. Nearly all of them were indentured to Mahadi in some manner or another."
