        "mainbody": "=First Floor===\nThe first floor was dimly lit, with few torches scattered around its caverns. Many creatures made Dragon's Eye their home. [[Troll]]s, [[lizardmen]], beetles, and several types of spiders resided here. A lizardman king commanded his subjects from his cavern, which was also where the captured villagers from [[Kuldahar]] were kept.\n\n===Second Floor===\nSimilar in its cavernous structure, the second floor contained the same creatures as the first floor, but was also home to some [[Talona|Talonite]] priests. A huge lair of [[bombardier beetle]]s could also be found here. A stone dais in a large well-lit cavern stood out, surrounded by clerics of Talona. Mother [[Egenia]], head priestess of [[Ilmater]], was to be sacrificed here.\n\n===Third Floor===\n[[Undead]], especially [[wights]], [[skeletons]], and [[zombies]], roamed the area of the third floor. It was littered with [[trap]]s and wards, and had a pungent stench of rotting flesh. A subterranean river divided the cavern in half, with bridges connecting the two regions. A priestess named [[Presio]] made her home here, where she summoned and commanded the restless undead.\n\n===Fourth Floor===\nThe fourth floor hosted a Temple of [[Eldath]], covered in several tapestries and rugs. The priests of this temple seemed to be non-hostile and allowed visitors to rest and be healed, if they so wished. However, it turned out that this was just a ruse. In fact, the priests were actually lizard men and [[yuan-ti]], in disguise. A high summoner and ritualist, deep within the temple, summoned several waves of such creatures. The high ritualist let slip that [[Yxunomei]], the evil [[marilith]] leader, had the [[Heartstone Gem]].\n\n===Final Floor===\nThe final floor was where Yxunomei resided, and kept the Heartstone Gem. The chambers here held a large array of traps, including poison dart traps. The floor contained a torture chamber, which led to a hidden room. A group of adventurers slew Yxunomei, and recovered the legendary gem.",
