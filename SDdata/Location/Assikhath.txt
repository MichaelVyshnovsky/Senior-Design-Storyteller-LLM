The '''Assikhath''' was a huge cavern-lair located under [[Thaymount]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-03-30 - Thayan snake sculptures}}

==Defenses==
The cavern was guarded by several powerful statues, some of which could cast protective magic while others animated to defend the place against intruders. Most of those statues had snake heads and represented stylized [[Sarrukh]]s.

==History==
The Assikhath was created by the [[Ba'etith]] as a place to hold the [[Athora]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Due to the statues guarding the cave, most [[Thayan]] considered snake-headed statues as a symbol of power and success in [[magic]]. Consequently such statues were a common sight in Thayan homes and [[Thayan enclave|enclave]]s, and were thought to bring good luck.
