The Assikhath was a huge cavern-lair located under Thaymount.
The cavern was guarded by several powerful statues, some of which could cast protective magic while others animated to defend the place against intruders. Most of those statues had snake heads and represented stylized Sarrukhs.
The Assikhath was created by the Baetith as a place to hold the Athora.
Due to the statues guarding the cave, most Thayan considered snake-headed statues as a symbol of power and success in magic. Consequently such statues were a common sight in Thayan homes and enclaves, and were thought to bring good luck.
