The Dwyvach Salt Flats was a plain located on the island of Gwynneth within the Moonshae Isles.
The salt flats were found in the far southwestern corner of Gwynneth. They were bordered on the west by the Trackless Sea, and on the east by the Mere Adammair and an open area of plains. The Dwyvach Salt Flats covered much of Gwynneths western coast south of Kimball Moor.
