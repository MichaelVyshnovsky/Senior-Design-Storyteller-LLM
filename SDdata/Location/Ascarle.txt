'''Ascarle''', the "Sunken City," was an underwater elven city located off the northern shores of [[Trisk]] in the [[Purple Rocks]].

==Description==
The somewhat-ruined buildings and walkways were formed from crystal and red coral. The city was filled with air.

==History==
The lost city of Ascarle was swept into the ocean by melting glaciers.

In [[1361 DR]], it was rumored that a [[kraken]] truly ruled the city, but the nominal Regent of Ascarle was the [[illithid]] [[Vestress]]. Vestress was a rogue illithid who had taken the city from hands of a drow [[banshee]], whom she banished to [[Inthar]] on Ruathym via a portal. She desired to conquer Ruathym, but the banshee made that impossible, so she plotted to have the banshee destroyed by [[Liriel Baenre]]. Under the Kraken Society, she also allied with [[Rethnor]] of [[Luskan]] and [[Shakti Hunzrin]] as part of a plot to turn the [[Lords' Alliance]] and [[Waterdeep]] into war with Ruathym. However, all of these plans were discovered by Liriel, who led an assault on the city, deposed Vestress, and released the illithid's captives.

==Inhabitants== 
Vestress had a standing army with a core of 100 [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] (sea ogres). A group of evil [[nereid]]s roamed the streets, and [[kapoacinth]]s  (marine gargoyles who loved torture) lived in lairs beneath the city.

<nowiki> </nowiki>The Kraken Society also held numerous prisoners there, including [[human]]s (namely [[Ygraine]]) from [[Ruathym]] and [[sea elves]]. These prisoners were released in [[1361 DR]] when Ascarle was assaulted by [[Liriel Baenre]].
