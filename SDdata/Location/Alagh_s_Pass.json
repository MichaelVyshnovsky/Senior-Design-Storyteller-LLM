        "mainbody": "'''Alagh's Pass''' was a naturally-occurring mountain pass that wound its way through an area of [[the Sword]] in the [[Anauroch]] desert.",
        "Description": "It was regularly intersected by chasms and canyons, that were split by additional crevices.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Alagh's pass featured a single lake that had long since been nearly entirely dried up. All that remained as of the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]] was a small muddy pool.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "A copse of [[acacia]] trees surrounded the pool in Alagh's Pass."
        },
        "History": "Alagh's Pass was named for the heroic [[Bedine]] tribesman [[Alagh]], a warrior that famously held the pass against a rival tribe to allow his fellows to flee to safety.\n\nWhen the [[Zhentarim]] fought their campaign against the Bedine during the 1360s DR, they wound up poisoning the pond at the pass."
