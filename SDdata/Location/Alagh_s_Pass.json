        "mainbody": "laghs Pass was a naturally-occurring mountain pass that wound its way through an area of the Sword in the Anauroch desert.\nIt was regularly intersected by chasms and canyons, that were split by additional crevices.\nThe pass was located between the a range of mountains in the Saiyaddar and the Hills of Scent.\nAlaghs pass featured a single lake that had long since been nearly entirely dried up. All that remained as of the midâˆ’14 century DR was a small muddy pool.\nA copse of acacia trees surrounded the pool in Alaghs Pass.\nAlaghs Pass was named for the heroic Bedine tribesman Alagh, a warrior that famously held the pass against a rival tribe to allow his fellows to flee to safety.\nWhen the Zhentarim fought their campaign against the Bedine during the 1360s DR, they wound up poisoning the pond at the pass."
