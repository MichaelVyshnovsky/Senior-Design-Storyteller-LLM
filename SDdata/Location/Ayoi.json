        "mainbody": "'''Ayoi''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. Its people made their living primarily on fishing.",
        "Description": "Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\n\nThe people of Ayoi were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula,  perhaps because its educated [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']] was so keen on talking with anyone with more intelligence than the simple peasants living there.\n\nThe village had a population of about 410 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.",
        "Geography": "Ayoi was located on the southwestern tip of the island of [[Tsukishima]], on the south coast near the [[Momoben Forest]].",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a ''shoya'', typically a minor [[samurai]], and Ayoi was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed. The ''shoya'' of Ayoi after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}} was [[Tamura Tenryu]].",
        "Trade": "Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Ayoi had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The people were fishers, but there is no evidence that they traded in fish.\n\nThe cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 3 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 [[yuan]] to sell.",
        "Defenses": "About 41 citizens of Ayoi served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.",
        "Religion": "Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Ayoi were followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]].",
        "History": "Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever."
