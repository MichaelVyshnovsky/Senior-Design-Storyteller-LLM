        "Description": "Most of Nimpeth's city walls and buildings were constructed by slave labor, including the city's seat of power – the [[Citadel of Carifar]]. The most impressive achievement of slave labor laid to the city's north, in the [[Broken Hills]]. The rugged hills were turned into sprawling agricultural wonder – the [[Woren Vineyards]].\n[[File:Elupar and lachom.png|thumb|''A 14{{th}} century [[DR]] map depicting Nimpeth.'']]",
        "Trade": "Nimpeth was renowned for its slave and mercenary trade. All cargo that moved along the [[Nagaflow]] stopped in the city Nimpeth before proceeding into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Another export good of note was [[wine]]. The lands around Nimpeth held numerous vineyards producing some of the best wine in [[Faerûn]].\n\nAnother big contributor to Nimpeth's economy was its proximity to the [[Golden Road]]. Many travelers and adventures stop at Nimpeth before heading towards the [[Shining Plains]], south along the Golden Road.\n\nNimpeth's slave trade was supported by many other cities of the Vilhon Reach. Numerous slave pens and slave auctions led to Nimpeth's early rapid growth. The slaves were sold in Nimpeth proper and transported north into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and further away from the slaver city. Nimpeth's slaves were used to work its many vineyards. Under the leadership of Lord [[Woren]], Nimpeth strived to remain a friendly neighbor to all the cities of Vilhon Reach. The Lord knew that there was no profit for Nimpeth in war.",
        "Culture": {
            "Cuisine": "[[Vilhon eel]]s were marinated in [[wine]]s, stuffed with [[herb]]ed eggs and cheese, and fried to create a local delicacy. ''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], it was common to find eels that contained valuables, such as [[ring]]s, [[gem]]s, and jewelry, although it was not clear why the eels were swallowing these or where they were coming from.\n\nNimpeth was known for its delicious [[Vilhon Cider]]."
        },
        "Defenses": "Nimpeth, just like other city-states of the Vilhon Reach, existed in a constant state of conflict, diplomatic or military. Petty squabbles could arise from territory disputes, betrayal, or something as simple as trade. Nimpeth was prepared to open conflict that always loomed on the horizon.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century DR, [[Duke Folkwain]] was in control of Nimpeth's defenses. The city employed mercenary companies that served as its guard and militia. Furthermore, Folkwain's personal mercenary company, the [[Company of the Crushed Grapes]], was reserved for special tasks and counted more than 250 footmen and 150 cavalry members. Nimpeth also commanded a small fleet of 20 ships that handled patrols and slave [[galleon]]s escort. The ''[[Wine & Song]]'' and its Admiral Taramont were in charge of protecting trade vessels in the late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "[[File:Nimpeth.png|thumb|''Well-defended slave-nation of Nimpeth.'']]\nNimpeth was founded as a slaver nation in the {{YearlinkName|285}}. Nimpeth quickly became a target for Chondath, withstanding a series of attacks and proving its power against invaders. The hostilities soon ended, and the [[Illistine]] family that ruled Chondath became content on using Nimpeth as a source for slaves. Fueled by the profitable slave trade, Nimpeth quickly blossomed into a rich, decadent, and powerful resort city-state of the Vilhon Reach. [[Arrabar]] adopted Nimpeth's slavery ways soon after as yet another center of power in the Reach.\n\nThe Citadel of Carifar, the stone-built governing palace, was built by the city's slaves ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|970}}.\n\nMigrant workers from Nimpeth, among other places, went to join in the construction of the canal that Innarlith was building between the [[Lake of Steam]] and the [[Nagaflow]] in the mid-1360s DR. This project was widely seen as bringing much lucrative trade to the Lake of Steam region because it would have connected the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the oceans of [[Toril]] through the Lake of Steam. When Innarlith's Ransar [[Salatis]] started to find excuses to cut funding for the project, Nimpeth paid for its own workers to continue their work on the site.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, [[Marsembian]] [[spice]] trade saw a significant decrease. The cities of [[Westgate]] and Nimpeth saw this as an opportunity and picked up slack, sending shipments of precious spice into [[Cormyr]] and the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Nimpeth's slavers could be encountered deep in the land of [[Turmish]], following slave shortages and damage done by a recent war. Around the same time, a strange never before seen [[disease]] started moving through the inhabitants of the Vilhon Reach. The affliction caused growths of green-white, lichen-like patches and the inability to concentrate nor memorize information. The disease cleared after 2-5 months. The cure was never discovered, however, alchemist [[Thoround]] of Nimpeth discovered that the blood and spittle of the disease's victims could be used as [[ink]] to scribe [[scroll]]s of the ''[[forget]]'' [[spell]].\n\nIn the chaos of [[Spellplague]], slavery collapsed in Nimpeth. By the late 15{{th}} century and past the [[Second Sundering]], it never recovered.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Citadel of Carifar]], the governing palace located at the center of Nimpeth.\n*[[Temple of Tempus (Nimpeth)|Temple of Tempus]], one of the major places of worship of the devotees of [[Tempus]] in the Vilhon Reach.\n*[[Woren Vineyards]], agricultural wonder that laid beyon the north-eastern wall of Nimpeth, on the shores of the Vilhon Reach.\n*Apart from major places of worship, Nimpeth had several minor shrines, including a '''Shrine to Tyr'''.",
