From 140 years ago to 100 years ago, the pirates reigned supreme...\" this chain of islands was conquered by Northlanders. Later in 1228 DR, a noble adventurer from this island named Viledel led a band of humans and demihumans across the sea to the Korinn Archipelago, seeking to colonize the lands and aspiring to one day create a strong maritime empire."
