        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] of the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the god [[Helm]] guarded the Stairway and prevented [[Waukeen]] and [[Lliira]] from using it to return to the [[Outlands]] from Shadowdale. Helm, obviously, was not tempted by Waukeen's bribes. Later that year, the Celestial Stairway appeared on Mount Waterdeep, seemingly in readiness for someone to pass between the planes and the realms, or because someone already had. [[Luna]], [[avatar]] of the goddess Selûne, was shocked to see the Stairway and made it visible to her friends [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Kyriani Agrivar]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Timoth Eyesbright]]. Luna thought it signified Lord [[Ao]] was planning something.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The connection between the Infinite Staircase and the Gates of the Moon was suspected to be a consequence of the presence of [[Shaundakul]] in the plane.",

        "Inhabitants": "[[Lillend]]i lived on and guarded the Celestial Stairway."
