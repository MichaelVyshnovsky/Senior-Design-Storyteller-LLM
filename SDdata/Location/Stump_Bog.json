And many wounded victims of such battles lost themselves in it, fell into its muddy ground, and drowned. Over time it became a popular and convenient site for killers, [[thieves]], and dishonest [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavians]] to dispose of bodies.\n\nIn [[1026 DR]], after having carried out massive raids on Waterdeep, the [[orc]] tribe [[Black Claw]] met their defeat here at the hands of [[Raurlor]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were many rumors of buried treasure in its murky waters, but fortune hunters needed to beware the many creatures that haunted the dark marsh.",
