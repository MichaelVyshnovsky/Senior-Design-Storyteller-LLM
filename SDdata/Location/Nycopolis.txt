}}'''Nycopolis''' was the infamous capital of the [[Necromancer Kings]] of [[Sahu]] in [[east Zakhara]], though in the early 1400s [[DR]]{{Ne-time}} it was nothing more than an empty husk.

==Geography==
Nycopolis stood near the center of Sahu along the shore of the [[Lake of the Winter Spirits]].

==Description==
Brave [[adventurer]]s exploring Nycopolis might be unsettled to find that both the city and the surrounding countryside were utterly devoid of life. Not even a single blade of grass could be found up to a mile from the city in all directions.

Nycopolis was constructed in the shape of a nonagon from the blackest volcanic rock on the island. A towering monolith could be found at each corner of the nonagon. Though destroyed centuries before, the curse of Nycopolis made it appear that the city had met its doom recently. Though devoid of life, the buildings of Nycopolis remained pristine.

==Activities==
Nycopolis sprung to life, or unlife, each night when a variety of [[undead]] roamed the city. These vengeful spirits continued the roles they'd served in life. The same Necromancer King who destroyed the city joined his undead brethren to hold court each evening.

==History==
The last Necromancer King to inhabit Nycopolis, perhaps in a fit of pure madness, opened a ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Negative Material Plane]] in the Lake of the Winter Spirits. By doing so he ensured that all life within and around the city would be sucked into the void.

==Defenses==
Anyone foolish enough to venture into the ruins at night would face a veritable horde of enraged undead.

==Rumors & Legends==
Vast treasure filled the Royal Palace of Nycopolis, though anyone foolish enough to take a single [[gold]] coin would discover the treasure was cursed with plague.
