'''Orpher''' was a thriving coastal settlement found in the nation of [[Durpar]], as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
It was situated on the northwestern stretch of the [[Golden Water]], where the [[River Sarren]] emptied into the bay.

==Government==
Unlike other Durpari cities, Orpher's ruling [[chaka]] was not led by a family of merchants, rather a wealthy adventuring company known as the [[Trollslayers]].
