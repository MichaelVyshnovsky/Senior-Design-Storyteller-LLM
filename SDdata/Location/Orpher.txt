Orpher was a thriving coastal settlement found in the nation of Durpar, as of the midâ€“14 century DR.
It was situated on the northwestern stretch of the Golden Water, where the River Sarren emptied into the bay.
Unlike other Durpari cities, Orphers ruling chaka was not led by a family of merchants, rather a wealthy adventuring company known as the Trollslayers.
