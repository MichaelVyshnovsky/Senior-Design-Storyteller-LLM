        "mainbody": "'''Hlundadim''' was a realm of [[goblin]]s and other [[humanoid]]s that dominated southern [[Netheril]] for centuries, founded and ruled by the mysterious [[Great Hlundadim]].",
        "Military": "The armies of Hlundadim were well-organized and deployed sophisticated tactics, allowing the realm to dominate huge areas and conquer many foes. They were supported by units of [[orc]] [[shaman]]s called [[ularim]], who wielded their magical power effectively and had similar effectiveness to the [[wizard]]s of the [[Netherese]] successor states and early [[Cormyr]]. The Great Hlundadim won great loyalty and devotion from creatures normally considered self-serving or cowardly, and these armies repeatedly found victory in his name, with only large professional armies backed by powerful wizards expected to defeat them.",
        "Geography": "Hlundadim grew from the fortress of [[Araugul]], built in the [[Windy Plains]] of southern Netheril. It became synonymous with the [[Goblin Marches]], and its influence reached as far as the [[Stonelands]], [[Storm Horns]], [[Border Forest]], and the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]].",
        "History": "[[File:Netheril goblin victory.png|thumb|300px|''Even the might of Netheril could be overcome by cunning goblins.'']]\nThe southern regions of Netheril were originally home to tribes of [[goblinoid]]s and other humanoids, many of which were driven farther south into the [[Forest Country]] and along the [[Inner Sea]]. The fortress of [[Blister]] was built in [[-1286 DR]] to guard this frontier and support expeditions further south, though poor strategy and tactics on the part of [[Netherese]] commanders and a focus on the [[Northwest Faerûn|western frontier]] allowed the enemy tribes to once again take control of much of the region over the following centuries.{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|23}} By [[-626 DR]] this area including the [[Windy Plains]] was once again dominated by goblin tribes.\n\nThe Great Hlundadim arrived in the {{YearlinkName|-393}}, late in the Shadowed Age of Netheril when the realm was in decline from the [[phaerimm]]s, and [[Anauroch]] had already started consuming the grasslands. This powerful magic-user gathered [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[kobold]]s, as well as some [[human]]s, forming the nation called Hlundadim and founding the capital fortress-city of [[Araugul]].\n\nWhen Netheril fell in [[-339 DR]] and the fortress of Blister was overrun by kobolds in [[-312 DR]], the thousand-year displacement of the goblins, orcs and other tribes ended and a great migration back to the lands north of the Storm Horns took place, settling around Hlundadim in the Windy Plains and the other regions associated with the [[Goblin Marches]] — the [[Stonelands]], [[Farsea Swamp]], and [[High Moors]].\n\nHlundadim waged war on its neighboring realms, especially the [[Lost Kingdoms]] of [[Anauria]] and [[Asram]]. These wars led to the creation of [[the Burn]], a former forest between Hlundadim and Anauria inhabited by goblins, and magically razed by order of [[Olzogath]] of Anauria. Anauria was protected by [[Tower Hlithal]] against the forces of the Goblin Marches, but it was finally overrun in [[111 DR]] by an army of Hlundadim orcs led by [[Andegril the Wise]], an orc [[shaman]]. Although Anauria was destroyed, they inflicted such losses that the orc host was also annihilated, reducing their population for centuries to come.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Lost Kingdoms, Hlundadim invaded [[Cormyr]] in the {{YearlinkName|198}}, burning [[Arabel]] and ranging south to the [[King's Forest]]. They were defeated near [[Suzail]] in [[200 DR]] by King [[Moriann Obarskyr]], though he lost both of his sons in battle with them.\n\nHlundadim was finally destroyed not by war, but by the expansion of [[Anauroch]]. The {{YearlinkName|268}} brought devastating dust storms and desertification to the [[Windy Plains]], sending the goblins into a panic and driving them south. Araugul was abandoned and the Great Hlundadim disappeared as mysteriously as he had appeared, with his former nation disintegrating into smaller bands that fought among each other. The surviving subjects inhabited the southern Goblin Marches, Stonelands, and High Moors in independent tribes, fighting each other and raiding Cormyr, the [[Dalelands]], and [[Tethyamar]], but unable to properly unify or rebuild what was lost.\n\nThe slowly rebuilding society of the Goblin Marches and the resettlement of Araugul was dealt a fatal blow by the warming period begun in {{YearlinkName|1038}}, turning the Windy Plains and much of the remaining Goblin Marches to desert and further drying out the lands to the south. Driven by food and water scarcity, the tribes of goblins, hobgoblins, orcs and kobolds united under the warlord [[Izac Uthor]] in [[1090 DR]] and embarked on a great migratory invasion of [[Northwest Faerûn|the North]]. This grand enterprise was cut short by the devastating [[Battle of Bones (battle)|Battle of Bones]] at [[Torgor's Triangle]], with the survivors hunted down and killed at [[Skull Gorge]]. These disasters ensured that the goal of a unified goblin nation remained well out of reach by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nThe cultural memory of Hlundadim remained among the tribes that descended from it, giving them an outsized aggressive demeanour and sense of grand destiny, with the name of the Great Hlundadim evoked as a legendary figure of victory. Old technical expertise, fortifications, and magical knowledge continued to be used by them, giving otherwise primitive tribes an advantage they otherwise would not have. Potentially hundreds of tribes and bands could claim origin from the armies of Hlundadim, including the [[Neidlig]], [[Fenlis]], [[Melial]], [[Teerac]], [[Merrowdrinkers]], [[Colchar]], and [[Bone Miners]], ranging from [[Tilver's Gap]] to Skull Gorge and beyond. The goblin nation was mostly a historical footnote for other realms, though it survived mention in Cormyr in the [[Rock of Hlundadim]] periapt, a decoration granted to distinguished [[Purple Dragons]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "* Around [[1367 DR]] it was rumoured that the goblins of the Marches were far closer to unifying than previously suspected, with the Neidlig believed responsible.\n* The nature of the Great Hlundadim was unknown, with speculations that he was an [[arcanist]] of [[Netheril]] or a planes-walking traveler."
