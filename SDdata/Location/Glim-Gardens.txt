'''Glim-Gardens''' was another beautiful park that held a grand mansion of the [[House Ammath]] in the glory days of [[Myth Drannor]]. Glim-Gardens laid immediately to the east from the [[Windrider Glade]], and the park's enchantment healed and rejuvenated visitors' bodies and souls.

==Geography==
Once grand mansion and its surrounding structures did not survive the [[Weeping War]] and by 1369 DR the area's nature and magic were twisted and harmful. The collapsed buildings that were located in the area were broken apart and taken away by many residents of the ruins over the centuries that followed.

The mansion's ruins were nothing but the structure's foundation, with its basement accessible not far from the fountain plaza. The basement led to the ancient family tomb that belonged to the House Ammath and had a passage to the Halls of Stone portion of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. Like other access points to the Myth Drannor's undercity, this one was sealed with a ''glyph (of song)'' and a ''word of power'' (''singing word'').

The magic that coursed through Glim-Gardens was twisted after Myth Drannor's fall and the section of the park with the strongest enchantment came to be known as the ''Thirsty Ground'' or ''the Garden of Blood''. The corrupted healing magic gave the ''Thirsty Ground'' an ability to talk to creatures passing by, offering them healing in exchange for their spilled blood. The ''Thirsty Ground'' called these services - rituals, namely: ''the Blood Lesson'' (in exchange for ''[[restoration]]''), ''the Blood Blessing'' (''[[remove curse]]''), and ''Fiona's Kiss of Life'' (''[[resurrection]]'').
The plaza in the middle of the gardens was centered on a beautiful fountain, connected to the complex water-system of Myth Drannor. When the water pumps were active, a water guardian spirit [[naiad]]Â named [[Plinshree]] was often seen around the fountain.

Massive stone doors of the decorated entrance to another ancient tomb were located in the north-east - the Cold Knight's Barrow (also known as the Tomb of Eternal Sleep). The tomb was the first structure in the area that became the Glim-Gardens that has been home to a powerful and extremely old [[wight]].

A pathway at the Glim-Gardens' southern border led to [[Sullymarsh]] and a stairway leading to a winding pathway led directly to the Windrider Glade. 

A patch of healing [[blueglow moss]] could be found near the ruined structure to the north of the gardens. Past the structure laid the path to the [[House of Gems]].

==History==
[[File:Cold Knight's Barrow.jpg|thumb|233x233px|''The entrance to the Cold Knight's Barrow.'']]
Sometime before the Weeping War ravaged the city, a powerful and ancient wight's presence inside a tomb in Glim-Gardens became known. The creature resided inside since before the city grew around the burial barrow. A [[paladin]] [[Eadred]] and his commander [[Hachaam Selorn]] ventured inside the tomb and destroyed the undead who placed a curse on Hachaam, trapping him in frozen stasis. When the War loomed over Myth Drannor, heroic Eadred decided to free Hachaam from the curse, taking his place in the stasis. 

At some point before [[1369 DR]], [[Jelde Asturien]], one of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] found his way into the ancient tomb of Glim-Gardens and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. The vault contained Jelde's ''[[blade of destruction]]'' and a set of ''[[arcane mail]]''.

In 1369 DR, Eadred was freed from his curse when one of the heroes from [[Phlan]] took the paladin's spot in the stasis in exchange for his aid against the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Inhabitants==
This twisted and wild area served as a home to vengeful [[undead]] ([[skeleton]]s, [[ghast]]s, and [[ghoul]]s) and numerous [[gargoyle]]s and [[margoyle]]s.

In the past, a powerful wight was locked inside an ancient tomb in the Gardens. And after the creature's defeat, a paladin Eadred was trapped by a curse inside since the days of the Weeping War.
