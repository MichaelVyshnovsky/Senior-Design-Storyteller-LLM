        "History": {
            "14{{th}} century": "[[File:Blacklake NWN2.png||thumb|right|400px|''Rebuilt Blacklake District following the Wailing Plague and the war with Luskan circa [[1374 DR]].'']]\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Blacklake District was the northern district of Neverwinter. \n\nDuring the city's struggle with the [[Wailing Death]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Blacklake District was barred to the public to stop the plague from entering. The few who were allowed access found the District's population in turmoil from food scarcity. Much of the conflict centered on the [[wizard]] [[Meldanen]], who had hoarded great amounts of food in his warehouse, and was known for his cruel magical experiments. The noble [[Formosa Laitannen]] loudly opposed Meldanen and his acts, and actively tried to hire [[Hero of Neverwinter|someone]] to kill the mage.\n\nWith the murders caused by the [[warlock]] [[Ammon Jerro]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the district was cut off once more pending investigation. After entering the district, the [[Kalach-Cha]] managed to find the [[wizard]] [[Aldanon]], who would later prove invaluable to the quest for the [[Silver Sword of Gith]].",
            "15{{th}} century": "When [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the northwestern district was left mostly untouched by the pyroclastic flow, although the Blacklake became a pit of debris, garbage, and ash from the eruption. In the rebuilt city, the Blacklake District lay in the northwestern part of Neverwinter, while the northeastern became the [[River District (Neverwinter)|River District]].\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], [[Dagult Neverember]]'s efforts to rebuild the Blacklake District had been fruitless because of obstruction by the [[Sons of Alagondar]] and their allies.\n\nThe [[Nashers]] moved in to take over the district and use it as their base of operations. The Nashers stole from the poor to finance their rebellion against Neverember, leading poor citizens to hire [[adventurer]]s to deal with them for the sake of stability. They openly defied Lord Neverember's dictates and attacked those who did not swear loyalty, driving off the rest. For those who refused to leave, they burned down their houses or else barricaded them inside. The Ashmadai were trying to infiltrate the gang. Meanwhile, the [[Neverwinter Guard]] made a ramshackle defense of certain areas and gates out. An [[Jerry|undercover Harper spy]] operated amongst the Blacklake gangs, communicating via coded messages stashed in secret places with handlers like [[Elminster]] and they sought to capture coded messages from the Dead Rats to decrypt.\n\nLater that year, to celebrate Neverwinter's successes, Lord Neverember declared the Protector's Jubilee. The event drew merchants from up and down the [[Sword Coast]] but some came through Blacklake District and needed escorting by adventurers."

        "Description": "The buildings remained largely intact in the wake of the various disasters that laid the city low. This was thanks to the nobles who'd previously inhabited the District, as they had built buildings and other structures using quality materials and sound architectural techniques, and protected them with [[magic]].\n\nHowever, most buildings were later repurposed into makeshift barracks to defend Neverwintan survivors against the dangers that plagued the city after its destruction, while others just fell into disrepair over time, or were vandalized by vagrants, making the district look significantly different from what it used to.\n\n[[File:NW Tatters.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''A view of the Tatters.'']]\n[[File:NW Blacklake Lakeside.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''A view of the Lakeside area and the Nashers' headquarters.'']]\nOn the southeast shore of Blacklake lay two particularly troubled areas, the Tatters and Riverside, which were linked by a short bridge. Both largely lay in ruins. Some \"notable\" locations in the Tatters were, or had been, Brimbleton Place, Chadwick Stoop, and Thatcher Road, but in ruins these were little different from anywhere else.\n\nThe Blacklake at the center was filled with ash and volcanic debris, filth, and trash dumped by the locals, as well as several destroyed ships. It came to resemble a vast midden more than a lake, overflowing with a dense black sludge. It even developed magical properties and gave rise to sludge-covered [[zombie]]s in the streets, suggesting it was more than mere pollution, and [[alchemist]]s like [[Hazel (individual)|Hazel]] studied the phenomenon. A [[drow]] self-proclaimed [[Chosen of Ghaunadaur]] later led an attack of sludge zombies on Blacklake District in 1479 DR, suggesting that he or his [[Ghaunadaur|god]] had transformed the sludge.\n\nEven though several well-detailed and annotated maps of the Blacklake District existed, their mass production was banned by Lord Nasher to protect the district and the city from any illicit and spy activity. Very few maps were in existence, with one of them found in [[Gillian's Hill]]'s curio store - [[Torleth's Treasures]] in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Blacklake District was inhabited by Neverwinter's nobles, before the destruction of the city in the Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR. Afterward, a few survivors and refugees that decided to remain in the city relocated themselves to the District.\n\nThese survivors were generally highly nationalist and proud of the [[Alagondar]] lineage, and violently resisted [[Dagult Neverember]]'s rule. The Nashers claimed the area for themselves, daring Neverember's soldiers and mercenaries to try to take it from them by force. The Nashers and [[Dead Rats]] gang largely prowled the Tatters, with the Dead Rats based in the sewers of Blacklake District.\n\nLikewise, the [[Ashmadai]] under [[Mordai Vell]] had gained a foothold in the Blacklake District, even infiltrating the ranks of both the nationalist refugees and Neverember's troops stationed in the district.\n\nIn addition, ''circa'' 1479 DR, someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the south with [[Iokharic]] writing (the language unrecognized) and a symbol. Locals believed the images were evil and worried of a devil-worshiping cult in the area. They were mistaken—it was a [[Cult of the Dragon|dragon-worshiping cult]].",
