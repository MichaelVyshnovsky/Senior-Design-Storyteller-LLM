The city was the site of the Circle of Vehlarr, a magic portal into the city of Myth Lharast, until the deity Selûne destroyed both cities in 720 DR, after being angered by the warfare between them.\nIt is rumoured that Vehlarr was not destroyed and still exists on another ageless plane. On nights of a full moon, the city is supposed to return to Abeir-Toril and it supposedly accessible through the Circle of Vehlarr.
