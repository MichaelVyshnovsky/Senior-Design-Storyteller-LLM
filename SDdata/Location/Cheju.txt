Cheju shares this origin with the island of Saishu itself and the island of [[Quelpart]].

==Geography==
Cheju stood at the end of a narrow bay that cut deep into the island.

==Leadership==
By [[1357 DR]], [[Dan Zor]], the former king and later governor of Saishu, was granted the honorary title of "Master of Cheju" by King [[Wanang Sun]].
