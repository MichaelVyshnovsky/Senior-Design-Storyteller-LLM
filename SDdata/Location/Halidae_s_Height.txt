'''Halidae's Height''' was a forest-covered hilltop south and a little west of the city of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[Cormanthor]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|760}}, Halidae's Height was warded against all types of [[fiend]]s by the god [[Azuth]], for "as long as Azuth's power endures". This ward may have collapsed with the destruction of Azuth in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}.{{Speculation}}
