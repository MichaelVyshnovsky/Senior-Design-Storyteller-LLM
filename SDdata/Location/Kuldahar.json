        "Description": "[[File:Kuldahar IWD2.png|thumb|''A bird's eye view of the early 14{{th}} century Kuldahar.''|450x450px]]\n[[Kuldahar Valley]] was a small mountain dale where the {{SI|300'|'\"|long=yes}}-tall [[Great Oak]] and the settlement of Kuldahar stood, roughly at the center of [[Kuldahar Pass]]. Unlike the surrounding areas, the area was warm and green, windswept, and frigid throughout the year. Most of the town's buildings and amenities were built into the great tree's massive roots and into the ground at the tree's base – they were the oldest structures in the valley, created by the druids sometime around [[1240 DR|1240]]-[[1250 DR]].\n\nAt the town center was the ''[[Heartstone Gem]]'' with the Archdruid's home directly to the north, flanked by a small stream. A shop was located on the stream, a forge on the tip of town, an inn on the east side, and a wizard's tower on the far west end. There was a second part of the town, the farming sector, which was composed of fields with a guard tower in the middle. The far west side of the fields was a landing spot for [[Oswald Fiddlebender|Oswald Fiddlebender's]] airship, along with a cliff on the north tip of the town. These buildings were surrounded by thick, healthy grass and wildflowers.",
        "Location": "[[File:Kuldahar Pass IWD2.png|thumb|''A settled area of [[Kuldahar Valley]] in [[Kuldahar Pass]].''|450x450px]]\nKuldahar was located to the southeast from [[Easthaven]], past the [[Ice Lakes]] on the other side of the Wall.<ref group=\"note\">Even though the original game's manual stated that Kuldahar is 60 miles southeast of [[Easthaven]], this was later changed in ''[[Icewind Dale II]]''. Kuldahar's location was pushed further east, judging by the in-game map and the adventure path: the party moves across the Spine of the World across the [[Fell Wood]], a new location introduced in lore. From there, the party moves east to the [[Cold Marshes]], located on the very northern end of the [[Ice Lakes]]. The journey continues northeast through the underground locations via the [[Black Raven Monastery]], emerging near Kuldahar, back on the northern side of the Spine.\n\nKuldahar was built in a tiny valley on the Spine of the World, along the second lesser-known route that connected Icewind Dale to the southern lands on the other side of the Wall. This position made Kuldahar somewhat notable in the region. This lesser-known route across the Spine of the World leading through Kuldahar to the [[Ten Towns]] laid through Kuldahar Pass – a mountain road that was nothing more than a collection of winding footpaths and steep ledges barely big enough to fit a beast of burden and unlikely to accommodate a large merchant's wagon. Kuldahar Pass's many dangers scared even the most daring merchants, and the ever-present threat of [[giant]]s left the route in scant use. The portion of that route that crossed the Spine of the World was simply referred to as the [[Southern Pass]]. A settlement of [[Slow Cedric's Gallop]] stood alongside that route in the mountains until [[1170 DR]] when it was wiped away by an [[orc]]ish horde.",
        "History": "[[File:Kuld.png|thumb|''The two-druid statue in the village of Kuldahar, depicting [[Tolben]] and [[Arundel]].''|450x450px]]\nAccording to the local legend, the gargantuan ancient oak was a holy gift of [[Silvanus]], the Oakfather, who planted its acorn into the Spine of the World thousands of years before the 13{{th}} century DR. The oak was imbued with Silvanus' magic and stood as a thriving testament to the raw power of nature. Unknown to most, the tree was planted near a yuan-ti outpost that hid a ''[[portal]]'' to [[Chult]], but over thousands of years, the outpost was ruined and the ancient ''portal'' – swallowed by the tree's roots.\n\nSubsequently, ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1220}}, a wandering Archdruid of Silvanus stumbled upon the massive Kuldahar oak and immediately realized that this was a place sacred to the Oakfather. The Great Oak and the shrine built by the Archdruid gathered a small following of [[druid]]s of Silvanus who cared for the holy site. In exchange, the tree kept the druid village warm and safe from the deadly cold of the Spine of the World. The oak became a center of the pilgrimage and gained renown as an oracle for the Oakfather faith. The town itself, beyond the worshipers and clergy of Silvanus, began only about thirty or forty years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, after Kuldahar Pass was first discovered and, with it, the sheltered valley was unveiled to the wider world. The town grew thanks to bewildering and wondrous tales of a massive magical oak that gave folk a miraculous boon of warms amidst some of the coldest environments of [[Northwest Faerûn]].\n\nThe new settling was met with resistance from the [[Archdruid]] of the time, who sought to protect the oak and believed that to do so, Kuldahar had to stay in seclusion. The valley was blocked from intruders via magically summoned walls of brambles and other ensorcelled nature barriers. Eventually, the druids could only stop the settlers from approaching the tree, but Kuldahar Valley was exposed to outsiders. That changed with the next Archdruid – [[Tolben]]. He made the tree accessible to those who settled in the valley, as he believed that the village's formation was the Oakfather's will and was inevitable. Under Archdruid Tolben's leadership, the druids forged a union with settlers and ensured Kuldahar's harmonious existence.\n\n[[File:Kuldahar map.jpg|thumb|''A bird's eye view of the 13{{th}} century Kuldahar, besieged by [[Auril]]s snow.''|450x450px]]\nThe next notable event in Kuldahar's history was the terrible war of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. During that period of time, storms cut Kuldahar off from the outside world, and the Great Oak's magical warmth began to wean. Those who settled in the Kuldahar Valley were forced out of their homes in fear of freezing to death and sought shelter close to the oak's trunk. The strife eventually came to an end when a destroyed caravan brought a band of adventuring caravan guards to Kuldahar. The heroes stood up to the encroaching cold and saved the great doomed oak. The cause of that year's strife was [[devil]] [[Belhifet]] who was aided by a band of [[frost giant]]s, led by [[Kreg Frostbeard]], who caused the avalanche, sealing Kuldahar Pass in the west, and [[Lysan]], a [[Chosen]] of [[Auril]], who lived within the village, plotting its demise to appease her deity. The person who brought the adventurers – [[Hrothgar]], perished with the rest of the caravan, but his body was buried in a glen within the valley. That burial area was named [[Hrothgar's Glen]] and became a cemetery of sorts for the people of Kuldahar. This conflict resulted in the Archdruid [[Arundel]]'s death, passing the Archdruid's mantle to the [[half-elf]] [[Iselore]].\n\nThe town of Kuldahar regained its blessed warmth and the people returned to working the valley. The population slowly grew, and so did infrastructure. By the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Archdruid Iselore had been guiding the community for twenty years and helped raise [[cambions]] [[Isair]] and [[Madae]], feeling kinship with the fellow \"half-breeds.\" But Kuldahar was threatened once again by outside forces. The [[Legion of the Chimera]] targeted settlements of the north and allied with the [[yuan-ti]], who were tasked with bringing down the Great Oak and the ''gem.'' The Legion was led by disgruntled campion twins who were raised in Kuldahar. When [[Madae]] and [[Cedra]], the Legion's lieutenant, led a squad of [[neo-orog]]s, yuan-ti, and [[harpies]] into Kuldahar, Isair bravely stood in the town's defense, shoulder to shoulder with a group of mercenaries from [[Targos]] who were the Legion's foil. Madae's yuan-ti hacked at the Great Oak's roots in the struggle, severing several, but the tree was saved. One of the severed roots hid an ancient ''portal'' that, once opened, would flood the valley with snake men from the distant land of Chult. One way or another, the yuan-ti were wiped out, and the settlement – was saved.",
