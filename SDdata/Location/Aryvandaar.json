            "First Flowering": "The first settlements of Aryvandaar were founded around {{Yearlink|-23900}} in the area later known as the [[High Forest]].\n\nControl of Aryvandaar was gained by the clan [[Vyshaan]] in {{Yearlink|-15300}}, under the leadership of [[Coronal]] [[Ivosaar Vyshaan]]. The [[Vyshaan|Vyshaanti]] of Aryvandaar claimed a family link to the ruling family of [[Miyeritar]]. They then attempted a peaceful annexation of [[Miyeritar]] which was resisted.",
            "First Crown War": "Aryvandaar began the [[First Crown War]] by invading [[Miyeritar]] in {{Yearlink|-12000}}. They also put pressure on [[Shantel Othreier]] to accept their rule or suffer the same. Miyeritar wasn't considered fully conquered until {{Yearlink|-11300}}.",
            "Third Crown War": "In {{Yearlink|-10900}} Aryvandaar, now the Vyshaantar Empire, ceased talks with Shantel Otheier and invaded, starting the [[Third Crown War]]. Around this time the Vyshaan lords gained a secret patron in [[Malkizid]], a fallen [[solar]]. The histories written by the victorious [[Vyshaan|Vyshaanti]] claim that Miyeritar was responsible. But in reality the high mages of Aryvandaar caused the killing storms.<ref name=\"LEoF-55>",
            "Aftermath": "In {{Yearlink|-3533}}, the [[Nether Scrolls]] were discovered by [[Finder (Netherese)|Finder]], a [[Netherese]] [[human]], within the area once controlled by Aryvandaar."
        },
        "Geography": "Aryvandaar encompassed the [[High Forest]], which in the days of the [[Crown Wars]] reached the [[River Dessarin]]."
