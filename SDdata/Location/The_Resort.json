        "mainbody": "'''The Resort''' was a [[spelljammer|spelljamming]] port in [[Rauthaven]]. It was famous among spacefarers for its luxurious facilities and abundant sources of rest and relaxation.",
        "Geography": "The beautiful spaceport was located on a beach lined with hundreds of docks on the northern shore of Rauthaven in southeast [[Nimbral]]. It was the only location where it was possible for a ship to dock on the island. Spelljammers approaching from the air elsewhere on the island were prevented from coming within less than {{SI|2|mi|k|long=yes}} of the ground. No other means of magical transportation was permitted to enter the island or any individual destination on it.",
        "Trade": "Trading of goods was not allowed at The Resort. Spelljammer crews were instead encouraged to consume the various forms of entertainment available at the city, which included bars, massage parlors, restaurants, and saunas, among others. If a crew patronized the local establishments, no docking fee was charged. However, if a crew had no plans to indulge in the city's amenities, a docking fee of 20 [[gp]] was charged.\n\nThe numerous bars and restaurants available throughout the city catered to a vast variety of tastes, including even specialized [[illithid]] and [[neogi]] cuisine.",
        "Defenses": "In order to keep the peaceful nature of the site, any form of violence was forbidden. Brawling was punishable by overnight imprisonment and a 1-gp fine.\n\nDespite being part of Nimbral and under its jurisdiction, law enforcement at The Resort treated spelljammer crews with more leniency than the locals. Travelers convicted of murder, which was considered a capital offense, were punished by being permanently expelled from the island. This punishment was enforced by customs agents in possession of ''[[spectacles of true seeing]]'' that could see through disguises and [[illusion]]s over a range of {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}."
