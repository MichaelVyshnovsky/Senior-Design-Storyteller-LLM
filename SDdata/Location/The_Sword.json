        "mainbody": "'''The Sword''' was one of the three major regions of [[Anauroch]]. The term \"the Sword\" was coined by sages because of the violent [[Bedine]] tribes known to live there.",
        "Description": {
            "Weather": "The weather in the Sword varied drastically with the time of day and time of year. In the summer, during the day, it was scorching hot, but at night, the temperatures could drop to freezing chills. A steady wind provided a constant droning sound during the day, and it slowed to a still breeze at night, if there was any movement of the wind at all. It was common for a summer to see no rain at all. The winters were as harsh and cold as elsewhere in [[North Faerûn|the North]]. Rain or snow were rare no matter what time of year, and when it did rain, it might rain in one spot but not in another location only a mile or so away. Such rains were short and violent, with torrential downpours and lightning that came and went, causing flash-floods.\n\nHeat shimmer and mirages were all too common on the Sands. Another risk of travel in the Sword was the violent sandstorms."
        },
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The area was covered in sand dunes, which was what had given the whole desert the name the \"Great Sand Sea.\" Four types of sand dunes could be found in the Sword: transverse \"waves\", longitudinal \"troughs\", [[wikipedia:en:Barchan|barchan]] dunes, and [[wikipedia:en:Star dune|star dunes]]. It had a few \"sand mountains\", or ''draa'', that were over one hundred feet (30 meters) high, but these were relatively rare. Dunes would often collapse in slides of sand with loud booms. Some parts of the Sword contained flat salt plains instead of dunes.\n\nThe mountains in the desert sometimes contained gold. Other desert rocks were a source of [[gypsum]]. The salt flats were harvested by the Bedine for salt. The Sword also contained rocky pinnacles and small ridges of piled, weathered rock. Water was sometimes found deep below these ridges.\n\nOases provided water and shade to desert inhabitants and were formed from springs deep in the ground that welled up to fill depressions in rock or sand. These attracted plants along the fringes of the source. Some oases had actually been created by magical means.\n\nOccasionally, springs from a mountain would form a stream through the desert. The water would carve a gulch before drying up. Similarly, dried up ponds fed by such springs would form \"dead waters\", or ''mamlahah'', flat-bottomed valleys of cracked clay.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "The Sword had much life within it, despite its harsh conditions, including many plants, insects, birds, and animals, which tended to burrow under the dunes. [[Snake]]s, lizards, birds of prey that hunted at night, and desert bats made homes in the rocky ridges.\n\nCamels were tended by the Bedine, being fed by hidden oasis pastures. As far as other predators, lions roamed the dunes, and many [[wyvern]]s also lived in the Sword.\n\nSwarms of moths were sometimes present in the Sword, and in the spring and fall, swarms of other insects were prevalent. Desert snails were a strange creature that left their shells during the dry summers to hibernate under the sands.\n\nThorny shrubs were often able to survive on rocky ridges, and their presence hinted at water sources below the surface in such places. In gulches formed by rare streams, [[ghaf|ghaf tree]]s and qassis bushes would form canopies and shade for animals, such as doves and quail. [[Acacia]] trees often grew around ''mamlahah''.\n\nTough varieties of [[grass]] grew in many places, as did cacti and short, twisted bushes and trees. Some plants and trees in the Sword produced valuable commodities, including [[coffee]], [[dragons' blood]], [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]], [[sesame]] oil and seeds, [[tanbark]], [[turmeric]], and indigo [[dye]].\n\nAfter the rare rains, the Sword turned into a place of plenty, as flowers bloomed and set seeds."

        "History": "In this location, in [[464 DR]], [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] came across his father, [[Arun Maerdrym]], who had been escorting some [[Evereska]]n [[elves]], (his then wife and children,) westwards. They were engaged in combat with the [[phaerimm]]. After both Khelben and Arun ran low on spells, and inside a protective sphere, Arun struck the ''[[Duskstaff of Sarael]]'' using his ''[[Lupinaxe]]'', destroying the phaerimm but killing them both and transforming the surrounding desert into a crater of glass.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were reports made by adventurers of several typically [[Krynn]]ish creatures—[[hatori]], [[horax]], [[skrit]]s, and [[tylor]]s—inhabiting the northern Sword. Because of this, a magic ''[[gate]]'' linking Toril to the world of Krynn was rumored to exist in the area.",
