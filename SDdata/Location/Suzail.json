        "mainbody": "Suzail () was the capital of Cormyr and the seat of power. It was named after Suzara Obarskyr, the mother of the first king. It was originally the farm of Ondeth Obarskyr, the father of the first king. Suzail was a large port city on the shores of lake Dragonmere. The capital had a direct link to Waterdeep via the Waterdeep portal.\nSuzail was the capital of Cormyr and the home of the ruling Obarskyr family. King Foril Obarskyr delegated much of the day-to-day tasks of running Cormyr to his Lord Magister Edwin Morahan who was responsible for keeping the peace, maintaining city services and collecting taxes. The Lord Magister was assisted by a herald who handled the paperwork necessary to run the city.\nThe landward side of Suzail was protected by an 80 ft. (24 Meter) wall. The city was further protected by the Citadel of the Purple Dragons as well as three gates which were essentially castles themselves.\nTwo thousand Purple Dragons were garrisoned in the city and over one hundred War Wizards resided within the walls. After the Spellplague, most of the Imperial Navy was relocated to Suzails harbor.\nthumb|right|300px|Merchants of the High Guilds of Suzail\nSuzail was one of two Cormyrean ports and a huge variety of trade goods flowed through the city. Suzail primarily exported copper bars and grain and imported luxury goods such as spices, silk, and citrus fruit. Trade was dominated by merchant families and trading companies such as the Seven Suns Trading Coster, Trueshield Trading Priakos and the Glanend and\nSkatterhawk families.\nThe city had a large number of trade guilds who took pride in their craftsmanship. The city was known for producing musical instruments, cloth, garments and swords, and armor. As of 1479 DR, the shipbuilding business, which had moved to Marsember, was beginning to make a comeback.\nAnimal pelts from the Thunder Peaks and the Storm Horns did very good business in Suzail as of 1368 DR.\nSuzail boasted two large temples, one of Tymora and one dedicated to Oghma. In addition to the temples, there were shrines dedicated to the exarch of joy Lliira, the beastlord Malar, the god of war Tempus and the exarch of bards Milil.\nSuzail began as a farmstead in 6 DR when Ondeth Obarskyr and his immediate family settled there. Others soon joined the new settlement and by 16 DR the population had grown to 350, having become a port a year earlier with the construction of the first dock.\nBetween 376 DR and 432 DR, Suzail was affected by a plague brought from the merchants of Marsember, and many people died, despite the efforts of the priests. Once the priests had almost exhausted their healing spells, they reserved them for their own use and were consequently slaughtered by the peoples of Suzail. Only priests of Talona survived, but they merely further spread the plague.\nAround 429 DR, Suzail was sold to Magrath the Minotaur, a pirate lord, for 500 sacks of gold, by Melineth Turcassan, father-in-law to King Duar Obarskyr, who was away fighting orcs at the time. The citys treasury was plundered and Magrath assumed its rule. Magrath was later defeated by King Duar and the city returned to normal.\nIn 1018 DR, much of Suzail was set ablaze by three red dragons. The docks and the lower wards were worst affected because of their wooden construction. The garrison of the city were able to defeat all three dragons, but Thauglor soon arrived, demolishing part of Castle Obarskyr and setting it on fire. In all, half of Suzail was destroyed in the attack and a third of its population was wiped out, in addition to extensive damage to the castle.\n* Castle Obarskyr, the castle of the King of Cormyr.\n* Citadel of the Purple Dragons, headquarters of the Purple Dragons where 2,000 knights were garrisoned.\n* The Lockup, an imposing building that resembled a giant stone square and served as Suzails prison.\n* The Promenade, a long, semi-circular street that divided the Royal Palace area from the rest of the city.\n* Bindles, a drinking club that was popular with merchants.\n* Black Rat, a murky tavern but renown for its hospitality.\n* Braundlaes Best, a tavern which sold live eels and silver dragon sauce.\n* The Dragons Jaws, a tavern that was later re-established as an inn.\n* Dragonriders Club, a favorite club of the citys nobles, known for its Mask dancers.\n* The Golden Goblin, A tavern known for its regular brawls.\n* The Hidden Lady\n* The Laughing Lass, a tavern that operated as a festhall on warm nights.\n* The Leaning Post, a quiet, quality inn owned by House Hawklin.\n* The Nightgate Inn, a damp and gloomy inn located outside the city walls.\n* The Osculatory, also known as the Kissing Club, this was a favorite established with the young nobles.\n* Roving Dragon, an inn that offered cider and fresh tarts to its patrons.\n* Shalibers Ship, this leaky cog permanently moored at Bollivers Wharf was repurposed as an inn.\n* The Six Candles \n* Society of Stalwart Adventurers, an exclusive club located in a grand old mansion.\n* The Wailing Wheel\n* Ring of Coins, a pawn shop that carried a variety of wares.\n* Tavernants Tellings, a print shop that printed broadsheets and notices.\n* Nalassos Scrollworks, a shop selling scrolls, scroll tubes, and other scroll-related products.\n* Wyvernspur House\n* House of Oghma, the temple dedicated to the Lord of Knowledge that served as a school and academy, training teachers, scholars, and scribes.\n* The Silent Room, the temple of Oghma that was formerly dedicated to Deneir. It was home of the Oghmanyte Church in Exile.\n* Towers of Good Fortune, the local temple of Tymora.\n* Two unnamed shrines to Lliira and Tyr.\nIn the early 1360s DR, there was a rumor in circulation that the Red Wizards of Thay wanted to open a public teleport gate between the cities of Suzail and Waterdeep, but the project was shut down by a merchants guild of one of the two cities."
