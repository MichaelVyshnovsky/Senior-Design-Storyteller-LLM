Jugicha was a city in the Plain of Horses of northwestern Kara-Tur. It was the home of the Tsu-tsu tribe and the second-largest city of the Plain of Horses after Li-Raz.
It lay at the western foot of the Chigidi Mountains, beside the Chukei Plains. Roads led northeast to Li-Raz and north to Haxkhun and eventually Peqqir.
Around , a band of rebels split from the Fankiang city of Li-Raz. They desired to found their own community, and so settled Jugicha. This triggered a realignment of the hsing (clans), of the Plain of Horses, ultimately giving rise to the Tsu-tsu tribe.
Circa , the qaghan (ruler) of the Tsu-tsu and Jugicha was Shajji Ghoiji. Ghoiji was corrupt and his government fell into chaos and finally rebellion. Ghoijis apa qaghan, his assistant and brother Shajji Hoijarek, stepped in, gathering capable advisors to his side and becoming qaghan in his place. Over the next two decades, Hoijarek worked to reestablish order in Jugicha and revive Tsu-tsu prosperity.
Hoijarek remained as qaghan of Jugicha and the Tsu-tsu around .
Jugicha held a number of temples staffed by lamas.
The Tsu-tsu people of Jugicha were considered to be superb herders, hunters, and producers of livestock. They were semi-nomadic, spending most of their year on the steppes, before returning to their villages or the city of Jugicha. Thus, each Tsu-tsu family had two homes tents in the summer and brick houses in the winter.
