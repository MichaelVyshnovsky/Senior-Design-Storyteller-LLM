Thommar was a location lying somewhere near Durpar, south of the Dustwall Mountains in southeast Faer√ªn. It lay south of Bralizzar, a town nestled in the Dustwall.
The mountains shielded Thommar from the Raurin desert.
The noted astrologer and mage Aman Al-Raqib of Bralizzar in the 14th century DR hailed from Thommar.
