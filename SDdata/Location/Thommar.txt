'''Thommar''' was a location lying somewhere near [[Durpar]], south of the [[Dustwall Mountains]] in [[southeast Faerûn]]. It lay south of [[Bralizzar]], a town nestled in the Dustwall.

The mountains shielded Thommar from the [[Raurin]] desert.

==Notable Inhabitants==
The noted [[astrology|astrologer]] and [[mage]] [[Aman Al-Raqib]] of Bralizzar in the 14th century [[DR]] hailed from Thommar.
