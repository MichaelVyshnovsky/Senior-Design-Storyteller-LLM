        "mainbody": "'''Skuld''' was located on the coast of the [[Alamber Sea]]. Prior to the [[Spellplague]], '''Skuld''' was the capital city of the nation of [[Mulhorand]]. The '''City of Eternity''', as it was also known, was claimed to be the oldest inhabited settlement in [[Faer√ªn]], and, before its destruction, was certainly the largest.  The Spellplague completely destroyed Skuld, burying its streets and buildings in rubble.",
        "History": "The city of Skuld was built in approximately {{Yearlink|-2100}}, and in that time no invading force succeeded in breaching its walls.",
        "Pre-Spellplague": {
            "Geography": {
                "City of the Gods": "Proclaimed by the citizens of Skuld to rival [[Waterdeep]] in beauty, the City of the Gods was home to many temples and houses of the manifestations of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].",
                "Naval Yard": "The naval yard housed the few ships that represented Mulhorand's almost non-existent seagoing military power.",
                "Merchant Yard": "The merchant yard served as the port district for merchants and tradesman traveling by way of the Alamber Sea.",
                "Warehouse District": "Having once boasted an exterior gate that was later sealed, the warehouse district served to house goods entering the city by sea.",
                "Merchant District": "The merchant district housed the majority of Skuld's shops and offered services to adventurers and traveling merchants.",
                "Palace District": "The palace district was home to many of the nobles in Mulhorand, including the Vizier, [[Rezim]].",
                "Crafts District": "The crafts district housed many of the tradesmen that resided in the city of Skuld.",
                "Central Ward": "The slums of the central ward were home to the majority of Skuld's citizens. In addition, slaves lived in this region of the city, matching the population of the citizenry in this district on a one to one basis."
            },
            "City Catacombs": "The temple of Osiris could be found between the merchant and warehouse districts. Built along the southern wall of the city, this temple served as the only official entrance to Skuld's catacombs. This subterranean network was known to be home to untold monsters, including notable populations of [[werecrocodile]]s and [[rakshasa]]s.",
            "Government": "Though officially governed by the vizier, the day to day activities of Skuld were actually administered by members of the church of [[Horus-Re]].",
            "Military": "The Captain of the city guard was traditionally selected by the clergy of the church of [[Anhur]], but recent{{timescale}} shifts in power allowed priests of Horus-Re to place a member of their clergy in this position. The guard itself was composed almost entirely of mercenaries from the nation of [[Chessenta]], though adventurers would occasionally be granted guard positions.",
            "Law": "Foreigners could not possess weapons or armor within Skuld, and the use of magic by these individuals was strictly prohibited.  Chessentan mercenaries employed in the city guard were also required to abide by these laws, though guard members were able to purchase special permits allowing them to bypass the restrictions. [[Elves]], [[halflings]], and [[gnomes]] were denied entrance into the city unless their presence was pre-approved by city or church officials.\n\nCapital punishment for severe crimes was common in Skuld, with public beheading being the favored form of execution. Another common form of retribution for crimes was banishment."

        "Notable Individuals": {
            "[[Ceianre]]": "Chief administrator of the city, Ceianre was a high-ranking priest of Horus-Re.",
