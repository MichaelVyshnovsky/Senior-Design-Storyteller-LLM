        "mainbody": "Yellyark was a village in Chult that was home to the Biting Ant tribe of Batiri goblins. It was built within a lattice of trees that were bent over and tied together with vines.\nThe settlement was located in the northern jungles of Chult, just north of the River Soshenstar. The trees upon which it was built were planted in the center of three enormous ant colony mounds.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Yellyark was ruled by a Queen Grabstab.\nThe settlement was constructed in quite a unique manner it was inside a grouping of bound trees, attached to a larger, stronger tree. This created a sort of \"catapult\" effect. If Yellyark was truly threatened, the bindings that held the bundle of down could be severed and the whole village could be launched a great distance away over the jungle canopy.\nYellyark employed more traditional measures of defense, such as tripwire alarms, camouflaged batiri sentries,\nAround the , around forty goblins lived within the village."
