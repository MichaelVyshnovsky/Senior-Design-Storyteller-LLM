        "Geography": "Samagard was located on the [[River Gur]] between the [[Sanrach Mountains]] and the coast of the [[Thingulph]].",
        "Activities": "The town of Samagard was constructed across the river from a large fortress that guarded the eastern end of [[Sormarl Pass]]. The town was the only location within Thindol where [[Samarach]]an merchants were permitted to trade. Agents of the [[yuan-ti]] had secretly infiltrated the local trade consortiums in order to gather information on Samagard's weaknesses. The yuan-ti also did what they could to heighten tension between Samarach and Thindol."
