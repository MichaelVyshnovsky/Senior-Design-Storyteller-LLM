The Flame Fault was a volcanic crevasse located on the island of Tuern on the Trackless Sea. It was famously the home to the trio of red dragons that ruled over the island of barbarians. 
The Flame Fault was deep, and fire and smoke constantly poured out from it. Owing to this active geothermal activity, prospectors were likely to find diamonds and adamantine ore in the Fault.
It was located in the western mountains of the island, and was one of many volcanically active sites on Tuern.
The Fault was famously home to a trio of red dragons who terrorized Tuern and several of the neighboring islands.  The various kingdoms on Tuern (and elsewhere within their range) would send them gifts of food, slaves, and treasure to placate them. 
The Fault was the only place where wild giant striders could be found. Given these creatures close relationship with firenewts, it was likely to find them there as well.
As of the late 15 century DR, the isles red dragons were effectively the rulers of Tuern and were even worshiped by the islands human inhabitants. Around that same time, a clan of fire giants was plotting to overthrow them.
At some point during the 1480s DR, a group of adventurers ventured into the Flame FaultWhile not explicitly stated as occurring at the Flame Fault, the location depicted in the Tyranny of Dragons comic is described as the "islands great volcano", the lair of one its three red dragon rulers. and slew one of the Tuerns three red dragon overlords, precipitating a rampage of the surviving two over the island.
