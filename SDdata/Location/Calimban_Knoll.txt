'''Calimban Knoll''', formerly called '''Calim's Bane''', was a stone circle marking where a battle was fought in the [[Calim Desert]] at the end of the [[Fourth Age of Calimshan]].<ref name=EotSS-pp78/>

==Geography==
Located near the northern border of the Calim Desert, {{SI|25|miles|long=yes}} south of [[Memnon]] just off the [[Trade Way]], Calimban Knoll was a circle of 21 [[menhir]]s {{SI|700|yards|long=yes}} in diameter with a tiny, rocky mound in the center. The appearance of this site varied depending on conditions in the desert. At times, the hill was exposed; at other times, sand covered the knoll, such that only the tops of the standing stones were visible. By [[1370 DR]], a third of the stones had toppled over.<ref name=EotSS-pp78/>

==History==
The site memorialized where a small band of escaped slaves held off a full legion of Calishite soldiers in the Fourth Age of Calimshan.<ref name=EotSS-pp78/>

==Rumors and Legends==
Despite the passage of centuries, some magic seemed to preserve the menhirs, and [[Memnon (efreeti)#Description|Memnon's Crackle]] was unable to disturb the site.<ref name=EotSS-pp78/>
