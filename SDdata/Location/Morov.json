        "mainbody": "'''Morov''' was one of the city provinces of [[Damara]], along with one of its smaller baronies, as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "Morov was found in the southern region of Damara,",
        "Government": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Morov was ruled over by the Damaran house of [[Banacath]].",
        "Economy": "{{Quote|Morov the same!|A popular saying in reference to Damara's rulership.}}\n\nMorov's bountiful natural resources led to it becoming one of the wealthiest, and thus more stable of Damara's provinces during chaotic years of power struggles and war.",
        "Defenses": "During the [[Bloodstone Wars]], Morov's fighting force was incorporated into the larger \"army of the minor baronies\", that boasted 1400 infantry soldiers, 600 mounted combatants, 260 [[archer]]s, a score of [[chariot]]s, and a trio of powerful [[wizard]]s.",
        "History": "When the Witch-King [[Zhengyi]] took over Damara, after the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the [[lich]] installed [[Dimian Ree]] as Morov's new baron to consolidate power, and designated the independent city of [[Heliogabalus]] as its capital. Baron Ree's inept leadership during the conflict led to many needless casualties, and the whole of its forces being kept within their borders. Over a thousand of Morov's soldiers deserted the army after their defeat by the forces of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] at [[Warrenswood]] and found new homes in [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] and [[Brandiar]] along the [[Galena Mountains]].\n\nThe remaining allied army of Morov, Ostel, and Polten fought together once again to retain their \"independence\" against the army of Bloodstone one last time, following conflicts in [[Arcata]] and [[Carmathan]]. Upon their defeat, each of the three minor duchies swore allegiance to Bloodstone and its ruler, Gareth Dragonsbane.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Heliogabalus]], the barony's capital was home to three-quarters of its populace."
