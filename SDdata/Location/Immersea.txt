Immersea was a medium-sized town in the Immer Stream Valley of Cormyr. It was the ancestral home of the Wyvernspur family.
As of the late 14 century DR, Immersea was a settlement of around 100 buildings and several manors The town was surrounded by a mosaic of green and gold farm fields. Cobblestone streets of the town were lit with lanterns hung atop tall poles at night.
Near the center of the town was a statue of a mounted King Azoun III fighting a group of bandits known as Azoun Triumphant, adjacent to the towns Market. The biggest and grandest point in interest was the Redstone Castle, the ancestral home of the Wyvernspur family.

Immersea stood on the Calantars Way and was most commonly used as a stop-over for travelers who ventured to and from Arabel and Hilp. Immer Stream began on the lush Spring Hill just west of the Redstoen Caste and cascade off the hill forming beautiful Selûnes Stairs.
Immersea was known for its storms. The reputation birthed a Cormyrean saying, "scowling like an Immersea storm." Mists are very common, and much of the land was covered in flowering vines.
Rulership of the town laid in the hands of the Lord of Immersea appointed by the Crown of Cormyr. Despite all that, Immersea remained one of the very few Cormyrean cities that only voices their dissatisfaction with the Crown. During Samtavans reign, the towns laws were quite lax, trade was unrestricted, and weapons were allowed to be carried in the open, unbound by peace-strings. Most garrison, guard, street-cleaners, and other maintenance was financed by Immersean nobility and merchant families, namely the Wyvernspurs, Cormaerils, Thunderswords, and others.
Before Samtavan Sudacar, the Lord of Immersea was Wohl Wyvernspur of the local noble House Wyvernspur until his death circa 1350 DR. As Wohls don was a child, the rulership was assigned to Lord Sudacar, who was graciously invited by the Wyvernspur to share the family home.
Apart from mostly human inhabitants, Immerse head a large population of various livestock beasts. For humanoids, Immersea offered numerous tiny inns, taverns, and stores, many of which catered to passers-by and single-night customers. Most shops in the settlement were tailored to the needs and wants of travelers and caravaners. Numerous weavers, net-makers, cordwainers, coopers, crate-makers, and hardware merchants could be found in Immersea.
Immersea farms raised cattle, sheep, and grew barley as well as corn. Apart from farming, Immersea produces fish, while the local group of fishers known as the "Mist Fishers" were a popular attraction. The "Mist Fishers" embarked on their fishing journey in the early mist-filled mornings across the Wyvernwater. At the end of the day, fishers returned to harbor bearing rich catch from their draglines and scoop-nets.  Sunsets and sunrises on the lake were especially spectacular and helped the "Mist Fishers" popularity. Freshwater eels, silverfin, trout, crabs, and greenbacks were among the most abundant catch. By the late 15 century DR, the fishing industry in Immersea began to suffer, possibly due to overfishing. This led to fishers down on their luck, turning to other profit methods. One family of note, the Ghelks, opened a successful crab hatchery in a warehouse building south of the docks.
By the late 15 century DR, the town expanded along both sides of the Mistfisher Bay, slightly to the west, as well as along the Calantars Way. The town opened numerous potteries, weaver shops, and printing houses.
Immersea maintained a humble garrison that included militia members only. Like everywhere in Cormyr, Immerse had Purple Dragons stationed in the town. However, they were never seen in uniform while on duty.
In the , just a month before the Time of Troubles stricken Faerûn, a band of adventurers from Immersea, the Company of the Lynx under the command of Knorrel Talbot recruited a young and talented wizard named Midnight. The heroes had recently slew a great wyrm on the lake of Wyvernwater after the creature swallowed a diplomatic envoy from Anauroch.
In the , Immersea, along with other cities on the Wyvernwater, Hultail, Thunderstone, and Wheloon, were captured by a would-be king and rebellion leader Gondegal, also known as the Lost King. However, his reign was ended abruptly, and Gondegal himself disappeared without a trace.
In late Ches of the , a halfling "bard" and Harper Olive Ruskettle became involved with the plot to steal the heirloom of House Wyvernspur – the titular Wyverns Spur.
By the late 15 century DR, Immersea continued to grow and prosper. The towns population passed 4,000 souls in winter and reached 4,800 in summer, thanks to nobility from Arabel and Suzail, who owned summer residences in Immersea or rented homes for a season overlooking beautiful Wyvernwater. House Wyvernspur remained the most powerful and prosperous noble hose in Immersea.
