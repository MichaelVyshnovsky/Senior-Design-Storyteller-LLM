        "History": "Sometime in the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] who followed [[Severin Silrajin]] sought the remains of [[Cruven Gantara]]. In their efforts to find him, they sought the remains of his close associate, [[Belast Messandar]], who they knew had been a wealthy merchant in life. Thus, they established their base within Merchant's Rest, from where they clashed with a rival sect of the Cult with the aid of the [[green dragon]] [[Charthraxis]]. The Harpers engaged in efforts to thwart the Cult led by an agent named [[Boward]]."
