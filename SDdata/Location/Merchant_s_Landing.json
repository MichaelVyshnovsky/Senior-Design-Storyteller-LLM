        "mainbody": "Merchants Landing was an area within the Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter where merchants were interred, particularly successful or wealthy ones. \nMerchants Landing was located behind Craftsmans Rest. \nSometime in the 1480s DR, members of the Cult of the Dragon who followed Severin Silrajin sought the remains of Cruven Gantara. In their efforts to find him, they sought the remains of his close associate, Belast Messandar, who they knew had been a wealthy merchant in life. Thus, they established their base within Merchants Rest, from where they clashed with a rival sect of the Cult with the aid of the green dragon Charthraxis. The Harpers engaged in efforts to thwart the Cult led by an agent named Boward."
