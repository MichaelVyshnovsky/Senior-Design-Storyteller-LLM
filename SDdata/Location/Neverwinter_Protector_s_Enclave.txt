The Protectors Enclave was one of the districts of Neverwinter, named after Dagult Neverember, the Lord Protector of the city.
Most of the original buildings of this district were left unscathed after the destruction of the city. As such, the Protectors Enclave was the only part of Neverwinter that looked like it did in its old days.
The citys market, where all commerce in Neverwinter took place, was located in the Protectors Enclave. Merchants from Waterdeep and other cities of the Sword Coast had to pay high taxes to sell their wares here.
Besides Lord Neverember and his underlings, the Protectors Enclave was inhabited by survivors of the cataclysm as well as immigrants who took up residence in the city after its recovery.
The Protectors Enclave was originally known as the Merchant Quarter of Neverwinter.Based on the locations of certain buildings in the game. This district in turn was part of other two different districts the City Core and the Peninsula District. Both were heavily damaged during the war against Luskan. The damaged parts were rebuilt as a different district.
When the Spellplague of 1385 DR struck Neverwinter, the lands surrounding the Moonstone Mask became an earthmote.
When Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the southwestern part of the city was left mostly untouched by the pyroclastic flow. It thus also became the primary target for Lord Neverember when he began his efforts to rebuild Neverwinter. He later fused the City Core, the Peninsula District and the Merchant Quarter into only one area. Soon after, survivors of the cataclysm, as well as new immigrants began to quickly repopulate the district.
As the seat of power of Neverember, the district was soon renamed the "Protectors Enclave" by the people.
