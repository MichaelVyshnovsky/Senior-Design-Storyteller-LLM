        "Description": "Samra was a relatively small fishing town. It had few defenses and no walls. The city had docks, but they were unaccommodating for bigger vessels, leaving Samra deprived of a huge part of the trade in the [[Vilhon Reach]].",
        "Geography": "Samra stood on the southern shore of the Vilhon Reach, in the immediate vicinity from [[Iljak]] to the west and [[Shamph]]to the south. Two trade routes could be found to the city's south â€“ the [[Old Road (Vilhon Reach)|Old Road]] and the [[Emerald Way]]. An underwater [[merfolk]] town was in the Vilhon, north of Samra, in the [[Echoing Canyon]] of [[Ovlos]].",
        "Government": "Samra is ruled by a mayor and a council of elected elders. ''Circa'' the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the title of the mayor belonged to [[Malil Entwine]], the owner of a local fishing company. Samra paid taxes to the capital of [[Arrabar]].\n\nThe city of Iljak showed mistrust and caution when dealing with its neighboring Samra, the attitude caused by a war of many centuries prior. by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Iljak outgrew Samra. Sages said that Samra was \"living on the good graces of Iljak.\" Samra and Shamph's relations were strained as well. Sapra's government's stance was that Shamph should maintain order in the region and build peace between feuding Chondathan cities.",
        "History": "Samra was founded in the {{YearlinkName|50}} on the southeastern shore of the Vilhon, the same year that gave birth to the cities of [[Mussum]] and Arrabar.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|139}}, Samra became one of the importers of [[Chondalwood]] lumber. By the {{YearlinkName|143}}, the cities that would later become [[Chondath]], under the leadership of [[Anthony Illistine]], attacked and destroyed the elven city of [[Ariel-than]] of Chondalwood. The massacre became known as the [[Battle of the Elven Tears]] and was retaliation for elves attempting to halt Chondathan lumbering operations. Six months after the Battle of the Elven Tears, Lord Anthony Illistine became the first Governor of Chondath and assembled the city-states of Arrabar, Mussum, Samra, and Shamph into the nation of Chondath."
