The city had docks, but they were unaccommodating for bigger vessels, leaving Samra deprived of a huge part of the trade in the Vilhon Reach.\nSamra stood on the southern shore of the Vilhon Reach, in the immediate vicinity from Iljak to the west and Shamphto the south. Two trade routes could be found to the citys south â€“ the Old Road and the Emerald Way. An underwater merfolk town was in the Vilhon, north of Samra, in the Echoing Canyon of Ovlos.\nSamra is ruled by a mayor and a council of elected elders. Circa the late-14 century DR, the title of the mayor belonged to Malil Entwine, the owner of a local fishing company. Samra paid taxes to the capital of Arrabar.\nThe city of Iljak showed mistrust and caution when dealing with its neighboring Samra, the attitude caused by a war of many centuries prior. by the 14 century DR, Iljak outgrew Samra. Sages said that Samra was \"living on the good graces of Iljak.\" Samra and Shamphs relations were strained as well. Sapras governments stance was that Shamph should maintain order in the region and build peace between feuding Chondathan cities.\nSamra was founded in the  on the southeastern shore of the Vilhon, the same year that gave birth to the cities of Mussum and Arrabar.\nBy the , Samra became one of the importers of Chondalwood lumber. By the , the cities that would later become Chondath, under the leadership of Anthony Illistine, attacked and destroyed the elven city of Ariel-than of Chondalwood. The massacre became known as the Battle of the Elven Tears and was retaliation for elves attempting to halt Chondathan lumbering operations. Six months after the Battle of the Elven Tears, Lord Anthony Illistine became the first Governor of Chondath and assembled the city-states of Arrabar, Mussum, Samra, and Shamph into the nation of Chondath."
