Norland was an island in the Moonshae Isles that was inhabited primarily by Northlanders.
At one time House Kendrick exerted nominal control over the island but as of 1479 DR the isle was ruled by the warrior maiden known as the Storm Maiden.
The largest settlement on the isle, Rogarsheim, was nominally ruled by Jarl Rault the Wise.
The population was a mix of Northlanders, Ffolk, and dwarves.
The South Jotunhammer Mountains was a mountain range home to many giants, mostly firbolgs.
