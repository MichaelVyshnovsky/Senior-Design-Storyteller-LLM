        "mainbody": "Tent City, also known as Tent Town, was a sprawling tent community outside of the North Gate of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR. It was considered by some to be an unofficial district of the city.\nThe communitys name derived from it being largely made up of canvas or brightly-dyed silk tents. It was also host to corrals, stalls, and a few permanent structures. Many of the tents had wooden plank walkways between them.\nThe Cross Road, the road connected Tantras and Mossbridges to Ravens Bluffs North Gate, cut right through the center of Tent City. A smaller, less impressive gate was situated on the road to mark the outer boundary of Tent City.\nTent City was host to a variety of different merchants, vendors, and ware hawkers.\nIn the spring of ,No firm date is present in any of the versions of At Last, Ravens Bluff. The ages of certain NPCs in Counterfeit Dreams, which is set a few weeks later, agree with sourcebooks such as Gateway to Ravens Bluff, the Living City (which is set in 1355 DR) and Inside Ravens Bluff, the Living City (which can also be surmised to be set in 1355 DR). For more information, see here. the notorious con artist illusionist Mortimer Mittlemer was running a scam outside Tent Citys gate with his wife Marilyn and associate Elmerth Willowit, impersonating a City Guardsmen and shaking down newcomers for 10 gold pieces in return for \"permits\" to enter Ravens Bluff, as well as smaller fees for keeping their weapons or horses.\nWhen The Three Women War ravaged the Vast countryside, those who had the money to do so moved into Ravens Bluff, hoping to wait out the conflict. Eventually bands of thieves moved into Tent City and began using it as a staging ground for their raids on Ravens Bluff.\nThe many vendors that once did business in Tent City were sent overflowing into both the Market District and the Torchtown neighborhood of the Uptown District, seizing vacant rooms in many of the citys abandoned buildings. The residents with money filled Ravens Bluffs one-story cottages, causing such overcrowding that they were eventually torn down in favor of constructing taller structures. Others found homes in the rundown buildings along the docks and the banks of Fire River. The more destitute of the displaced had little choice but to sleep in the citys alleys or upon its rooftops.\nMany felt that Tent City would never return, with the Three Womens War having demonstrated the superior safety of life behind Ravens Bluffs walls. Residents slowly trickled back in following its reconstruction,\n* The A.V.O.W. shelter, a permanent structure and animal shelter that was established after the Three Women War with the hope of finding homes for all the animals that lost their owners during the conflict.\n* The Dancing Bear inn.\n* Marigolds Menagerie, a permanent structure animal shelter and animal training center. It managed to remain standing followed the forced dismantling of Tent City, due in part to its use by a band of thieves.\nTent City was a tight-knit community whose population fluctuated with the seasons, usually peaking during the summer months. with many beggars working the crowds that passed through.\nResidents were suspicious of non-residents, though not hostile or rude. most of the time unwilling to offer up information freely.\n* Amy-Sue, a destitute child.\n* Madame Zorbano, a fortune teller, lived there in a tent of fine purple silk that was festooned with silvery moons and stars and topped with a yellow pennant.\n* Mather Sagra, a man that was skilled in providing people disguises.\n* Tent town was among the places that the roving street vendor Friar Cookpot frequented."
