'''Elembar''' was a large [[human]] kingdom in [[northwest Faer√ªn]] that existed from the 2{{nd}} to 6{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Geography==
Elembar lay across the lower [[Delimbiyr Vale]] between the [[Delimbiyr River]], [[Ardeep Forest]], and [[Forlorn Hills]], and reached into the [[Dessarin Valley]] almost as far as future [[Womford]]. The capital city, [[Delimbiyran (city)|Delimbiyran]], sat halfway between the Ardeep Forest and the later site of [[Daggerford]].{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|32,33,35,37}}

==History==
The kingdom of Elembar was founded in the {{YearlinkName|146}} by [[Illuskan]] settlers moving up the Vale from [[Tavaray]]. Other contemporary human realms in the [[Sword Coast North]] included [[Eigersstor]] founded in [[87 DR]], [[Steeping Falls]] founded in [[133 DR]], [[Uthtower]] also founded in 146 DR, [[Athalantar]] founded in {{Yearlink|183}}, and [[Yarlith]] founded in {{Yearlink|191}}. Over the following century these realms did well for themselves, as Elembar, Athalantar, Yarlith, and Uthtower settled the lands along the Dessarin Valley all the way to the [[Crags]] with fortified frontier holds, calling it the [[Mlembryn lands]].

Yet the Illuskan realms of the North suffered a period of reversals over the next few centuries that would only halt with [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s establishment of [[Stornanter]] in [[806 DR]] and the rebuilding of [[Illusk]] in [[812 DR]]. The largest city of the Vale, Tavaray, was abandoned in the {{YearlinkName|302}} when it suddenly sank into the [[Lizard Marsh]], and Athalantar was destroyed by [[orc]]s in [[342 DR]]. Steeping Falls was abandoned by its own people in {{YearlinkName|403}} as evil monstrosities and [[undead]] made [[Morlin Castle]] their home. As the realms waned and collapsed, [[Tethyrian]] humans and [[halfling]]s from the [[Shoon Imperium]], [[Tethyr]] and [[Amn]] migrated north, joining with or absorbing the local Illuskans.

Elembar itself fell in the {{YearlinkName|511}} at the hands of an orc horde that ravaged its northern and central regions. Though the invaders were destroyed at the [[House of Stone]] and the capital city Delimbiyran survived intact, the realm was shattered. [[Javilarhh Snowsword I]] reformed it as the kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]] and became its first king, leading it into a period of expansion and security as part of [[Phalorm]].

By the 14{{th}} century DR, the name "Elembar" was still used to refer to the northern regions of the realm between the Ardeep Forest and Forlorn Hills, roughly synonymous with the former [[Halangorn Forest]]. The [[Moon Tower of Elembar]] was destroyed by the invasion of 511 DR, but a ghostly remnant of it remained on the eastern edge of the Forlorn Hills, with it trapped inside the [[Border Ethereal]].
