        "mainbody": "'''Urml''' was a settlement of [[grippli]] at the far eastern end of the [[Wetwoods]] in the [[Shining Plains]].",
        "History": "Over a number of years, grippli gathered at this location and established the settlement of Urml. They tried to stay out of the affairs of [[humanoid]]s as much as they could.\n\nIn the [[1348 DR|Year of the Spur, 1348 DR]], an excavation outside Urml turned up a magically preserved ''[[rieldoxia]]'', a word crystal of the fallen empire of [[Jhaamdath]]. It apparently contained the thought images of [[Exarch]] [[Thelasand IV]] of Jhaamdath, made after the [[Procession of Justice]] in the [[-247 DR|Year of the Striking Lance, â€“247 DR]]. It mentioned his escape to the Wetwoods and captivity among grippli.",
        "Population": "Around [[1370 DR]], Urml was home to some 200 grippli, making it something of a city by grippli standards,<ref group=\"note\">In ''The Vilhon Reach'', Urml is said to be a town, a city, and a small village, even in one paragraph. As it is much larger than average grippli settlements, it may be that Urml is a village by human standards, but a city by grippli standards.",
        "Government": "Urml's leader around 1370 DR was the elderly tribe mother [[Oluusious]], aged nearly four hundred years old. She was afraid of humanoid expeditions into the Wetwoods, worrying that [[human]] expansion would mean their small village being added to human lands.",
        "Notable Locations": "A shrine to [[Silvanus]] was found in Urml."
