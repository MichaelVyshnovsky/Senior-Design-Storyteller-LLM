        "mainbody": "'''Llurth Dreier''' (also spelled '''Llurth Dreir'''), known as the '''Accursed City''' and the '''City of Ooze''', was a [[drow]] city in the [[Great Bhaerynden]] domain of the [[Underdark]].The name \"Llurth Dreier\" has had multiple spellings, with \"Dreir\" used in ''[[Underdark (sourcebook)|Underdark]]'' and ''[[Ascendancy of the Last]]'' and \"Drier\" used in ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' (assumed to be a spelling error), with the remaining sources using \"Dreier\", which is adopted for this article. After its destruction, it was called the '''Oozing Ruin'''.",
        "Geography": "It lay in a remote [[middledark]] region of the Underdark, located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) under the [[Shaar]] grasslands and a long way to the west or northwest of the [[Great Rift]], part of the Great Bhaerynden domain or the [[Deepwild]].The statement \"from the depths of Llurthogl\" in ''Underdark'' implies it is the lake. However, it is also used more generally to refer to the city or its caverns. ''[[Ascendancy of the Last]]'' confirms that it is indeed the lake.",
        "History": "Around {{Yearlink|-7600}}, the great cavern of [[Bhaerynden]] collapsed, leading to the downfall of the drow empire of [[Telantiwar]]. Refugee drow spread out in all directions, laying claim to lesser caverns and establishing new cities, among them Llurth Dreier.\n\nFrom {{Yearlink|-5112}} to {{Yearlink|-4835}}, Llurth Dreier was wracked by the [[Webfire Wars]], a conflict between the faithful of [[Lolth]] and those of [[Ghaunadaur]].\n\nIn centuries past, the drow of Llurth Dreier somehow offended their goddess [[Lolth]], and she withdrew her support from them. The city fell into strife, with House feuds out of control, and the drow turned to other gods of the [[Dark Seldarine]]. The faiths of [[Eilistraee]], [[Kiaransalee]], and [[Vhaeraun]] tried to fill the demand for divine help, but they couldn't compete with [[Ghaunadaur]]'s cult.\n\nEventually, a frightful [[avatar]] of Ghaunadaur emerged from the depths of Llurthogl. Many of the Houses elected to worship it and make sacrifices to it, desiring the power to obliterate their rivals, but this was largely futile.\n\nAfter Chansreena (princess) [[Alabhansree Alanasker]] of [[Ormpur]] went missing in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], there were reports she was held in the slave pits of Llurth Dreier. High Suikh (king) [[Helbareim Alanasker]] hired a number of adventuring companies to rescue her, but the reports were found to be completely false by [[1372 DR]].\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], the city was destroyed by the collapse of the roof of its cavern.",
        "Description": "Once a large and mighty city, by [[1372 DR]], Llurth Dreier occupied three huge caverns. These were home to nearly 60,000 drow, known as the Dreiryn, and over 100,000 slaves.[[Menzoberranzan (boxed set)|''Menzoberranzan: The City'']] page 3 and ''[[Demihuman Deities]]'' page 20 give the population as 400,000 dark elves/drow, but ''Underdark'' page 158 has only 60,000 drow, not including slaves. The discrepancy may be made up by the otherwise \"countless\" slime creatures, but the later figure is adopted here. It is unknown if any great changes occurred between 1369 DR and 1372 DR. It was perhaps the most populous drow city in [[Faer√ªn]].\n\nThe drow Houses stayed safe inside their black towers, and offered a piffling degree of protection to those who offered them tribute. Their slaves, dwelling in abject misery, were otherwise almost completely ignored, left to fend for themselves and eke out a living. The black towers held some wealth, but all outside was utterly squalid. There were vast farms of fungi.\n\nAfter its deserved destruction, all that remained were fields of rubble and stones, though holes and gaps permitted entry to the remnants of the drow buildings. [[Ooze]]s and [[aberration|aberrant creatures]] lurked in the darkest parts.",
        "Culture": "The Accursed City was a wretched hive of scum and villainy, a horrible cesspool of a city, without even the culture and arrogance of a typical drow settlement.\n\nIgnored by Lolth, the Dreiryn paid homage to other drow gods, such as [[Kiaransalee]], [[Vhaeraun]], and even [[Eilistraee]], but most followed Ghaunadaur, whose avatar lurked right there in the city. Each House had adopted one god or another, and quashed the worship of other gods.''Demihuman Deities'' suggests, by way of example, that rival drow faiths are completely absent and the clergy of Ghaunadaur rule completely. However, ''Underdark'' introduces various other faiths, active in the current time, seemingly contradicting or overriding the earlier situation. It was whispered that the ancient [[Ilythiir]]i order of Ghaunadaur [[crusader]]s called the [[Fanatics of the Overflowing Pit]] lingered on in some form in Llurth Dreier.",
        "Society": "The noble Houses of Llurth Dreier engaged in endless feuds, unrestrained by any sense of shame or style. They regularly raided the fields of rival Houses to steal food and kidnap people to serve as slaves or sacrifices to Ghaunadaur.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Houses weren't even the real power in Llurth Dreier. [[Aboleth]] [[psion]]s and [[cleric]]s of Ghaunadaur, some exceptionally powerful, were the real rulers of the city. They used their considerable [[psionic]] powers to enforce their will and keep the large population under tight control. They had done this for such a long time and with such intensity that it had had an unforeseen effect on the drow thralls, awakening latent psionic talents in them by the early 1370s DR and causing them to gain psionic powers themselves. It was possible that this growing power would result in some kind of resistance movement, perhaps even a revolt.\n\nWoefully weakened, Llurth Dreier was protected only by its remoteness; there was no rival close enough who'd care to crush it. In any case, it was practically worthless. Its only real defense was the lurking avatar of Ghaunadaur, which no force would dare face, if it would even move to defend its worshipers.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "By [[1479 DR]], it was warned that, after the city's fall, the avatar of Ghaunadaur still dwelt in the ruins, inside an open vault. It was said to be a gargantuan amorphous thing."
