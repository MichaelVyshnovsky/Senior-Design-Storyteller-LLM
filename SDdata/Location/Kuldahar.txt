Kuldahar was a settlement that sprung up around the gargantuan ancient oak tree, holy to the Church of Silvanus in the northern reaches of the Spine of the World mountains.

Kuldahar Valley was a small mountain dale where the -tall Great Oak and the settlement of Kuldahar stood, roughly at the center of Kuldahar Pass. Unlike the surrounding areas, the area was warm and green, windswept, and frigid throughout the year. Most of the towns buildings and amenities were built into the great trees massive roots and into the ground at the trees base – they were the oldest structures in the valley, created by the druids sometime around 1240-1250 DR.
At the town center was the Heartstone Gem with the Archdruids home directly to the north, flanked by a small stream. A shop was located on the stream, a forge on the tip of town, an inn on the east side, and a wizards tower on the far west end. There was a second part of the town, the farming sector, which was composed of fields with a guard tower in the middle. The far west side of the fields was a landing spot for Oswald Fiddlebenders airship, along with a cliff on the north tip of the town. These buildings were surrounded by thick, healthy grass and wildflowers.

According to the local legend, the gargantuan ancient oak was a holy gift of Silvanus, the Oakfather, who planted its acorn into the Spine of the World thousands of years before the 13 century DR. The oak was imbued with Silvanus magic and stood as a thriving testament to the raw power of nature. Unknown to most, the tree was planted near a yuan-ti outpost that hid a portal to Chult, but over thousands of years, the outpost was ruined and the ancient portal – swallowed by the trees roots.
Subsequently, circa the , a wandering Archdruid of Silvanus stumbled upon the massive Kuldahar oak and immediately realized that this was a place sacred to the Oakfather. The Great Oak and the shrine built by the Archdruid gathered a small following of druids of Silvanus who cared for the holy site. In exchange, the tree kept the druid village warm and safe from the deadly cold of the Spine of the World. The oak became a center of the pilgrimage and gained renown as an oracle for the Oakfather faith. The town itself, beyond the worshipers and clergy of Silvanus, began only about thirty or forty years before the , after Kuldahar Pass was first discovered and, with it, the sheltered valley was unveiled to the wider world. The town grew thanks to bewildering and wondrous tales of a massive magical oak that gave folk a miraculous boon of warms amidst some of the coldest environments of Northwest Faerûn.
The new settling was met with resistance from the Archdruid of the time, who sought to protect the oak and believed that to do so, Kuldahar had to stay in seclusion. The valley was blocked from intruders via magically summoned walls of brambles and other ensorcelled nature barriers. Eventually, the druids could only stop the settlers from approaching the tree, but Kuldahar Valley was exposed to outsiders. That changed with the next Archdruid – Tolben. He made the tree accessible to those who settled in the valley, as he believed that the villages formation was the Oakfathers will and was inevitable. Under Archdruid Tolbens leadership, the druids forged a union with settlers and ensured Kuldahars harmonious existence.
