Narbondellyn was a district of the drow city of Menzoberranzan. 
The district of Narbondellyn was located next to Narbondel, the citys enchanted clock pillar.
Narbondellyn was an elegant district with broad streets, fine homes, chic cafes and taverns, and expensive shops. It housed manors, theaters, an arena, and two of the ruling houses.  Multicolored faerie fire highlighted the stone carvings on mansions and illuminated shop signs. It was the home of the wealthy up-and-coming drow houses and no less than seven existing powerful noble houses. Several of the most luxurious and profitable of businesses were located in this neighborhood as well. The best gems and perfumes could be found here, as well as the citys moneylenders.
Drow were by far the most numerous folk in Narbondellyn. Richly dressed drow shopped and sampled the fares. City guards mounted on large lizards or giant slugs made frequent rounds. Goblins could be found as personal servants, dwarf slaves repaired fine metal items, and minotaurs acted as guards. Kobolds lurked in narrow alcoves and scurried out to clean the streets.
