'''Narbondellyn''' was a district of the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]]. 

==Geography==
The district of Narbondellyn was located next to [[Narbondel]], the city's enchanted clock pillar.

==Description==
Narbondellyn was an elegant district with broad streets, fine homes, chic cafes and taverns, and expensive shops. It housed manors, theaters, an arena, and two of the ruling houses.  Multicolored [[faerie fire]] highlighted the stone carvings on mansions and illuminated shop signs. It was the home of the wealthy up-and-coming drow houses and no less than seven existing powerful noble houses. Several of the most luxurious and profitable of businesses were located in this neighborhood as well. The best gems and perfumes could be found here, as well as the city's moneylenders.

==Inhabitants==
Drow were by far the most numerous folk in Narbondellyn. Richly dressed drow shopped and sampled the fares. City guards mounted on large lizards or giant slugs made frequent rounds. [[Goblin]]s could be found as personal servants, [[dwarf]] slaves repaired fine metal items, and [[minotaur]]s acted as guards. [[Kobold]]s lurked in narrow alcoves and scurried out to clean the streets.

==Locations==
; [[House Fey-Branche]] : One of the ruling houses.
; [[House Godeep]] : A minor house of Menzoberranzan.
; [[House Ousstyl]] : 52nd house in [[1372 DR]].
; [[House Srune'Lett]]: The house's compound was in this neighborhood.
; Smithy: An enslaved dwarf worked as a smith here in [[1361 DR]].
; Public bathhouse : The bathhouse had female gnome slaves, as well as goblin slaves.

==Notable inhabitants==
;[[Gromph Baenre]]: The archmage had a private stalactite manor here. It was a black mansion, carved from stalactites with walls covered in shifting symbols. Residents of the city avoided it.
;[[Liriel Baenre]]: The drow priestess had a miniature castle here.
