'''Red Haven''' was a small fishing village located in the coast of [[Unther]], in the road between the cities of [[Shussel]] and [[Unthalass]].

==Government==
As of [[1357 DR]], Dalath was ruled by Lord [[Karigulzu]].

==History==
Red Haven was once a bigger town, but in the decade of the [[1350 DR|1350s DR]] it suffered many attacks from [[sahuagin]] and pirates, reducing the settlement to a small village by [[1357 DR]].

Red Haven was destroyed alongside the rest of Unther during the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]].
