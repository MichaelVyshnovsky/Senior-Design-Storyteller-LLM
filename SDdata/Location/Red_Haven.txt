Red Haven was a small fishing village located in the coast of Unther, in the road between the cities of Shussel and Unthalass.
As of 1357 DR, Dalath was ruled by Lord Karigulzu.
Red Haven was once a bigger town, but in the decade of the 1350s DR it suffered many attacks from sahuagin and pirates, reducing the settlement to a small village by 1357 DR.
Red Haven was destroyed alongside the rest of Unther during the Spellplague of 1385 DR.
