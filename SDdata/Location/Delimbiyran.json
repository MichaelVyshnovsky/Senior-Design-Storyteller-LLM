        "mainbody": "The [[human]] kingdom of '''Delimbiyran''' was formed after the rest of [[Elembar]] was wiped out by a horde of [[orc]]s in the {{YearlinkName|511}}. It became the human part of the triumvirate when it joined to form [[Phalorm]], the Realm of Three Crowns, in the {{YearlinkName|615}}. Phalorm survived for less than a century. Indeed, their [[Elf|elven]] peers from [[Ardeep]] grew sick of war and eventually left Phalorm to travel to [[Evermeet]]. The severely depopulated [[Dwarf|dwarven]] allies also retreated from the area, effectively putting an end to the realm in the {{YearlinkName|615}}. The humans allowed any of the [[gnomes]] and [[halflings]] of Phalorm who wanted to stay in the alliance to do so as long as they swore fealty to king [[Javilarhh II]], who founded the Kingdom of Man, officially called Delimbiyran after its capital city. This new realm was to encompass all the land that belonged to Phalorm.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|6}}\n\nPhalorm had been constantly beset by the [[orc]]s of the surrounding areas and so Delimbiyran spent the next fifty five years building defensive castles and sending out constant raids into the [[Sword Mountains]] and southern [[High Moor]] where the orcs lived. This period became known as the \"Endless Battle\".\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|697}}, [[Shar]]ran clergy up and down the entire [[Sword Coast]] rioted after their high priestess foolishly killed the entire senior clergy of the church in the region in an effort to turn herself into a [[lich]]. The current king, King [[Davyd]], ordered his troops to clamp down on the violence which in turn, inspired a fanatic to martyr himself by assassinating him. Davyd died without an heir and the nobles began to squabble, which eventually turned into a civil war. The kingdom collapsed into petty kingdoms of proud nobles, such as [[Calandor]], [[Loravatha]], and [[Scathril]]. This marked the end of the Kingdom of Man.\n\nThe next year, the {{YearlinkName|698}}, orc raiders from the [[High Forest]] swept down and quickly overran the splinter kingdoms. That same year, the human's gnomish allies in [[Dolblunde]] abandoned their city after it was attacked by worshipers of [[Urdlen]]. The Duke of Calandor (secretly backed by [[the Covenant]]) united the remaining duchies to repel the orcs in the {{YearlinkName|702}}."
