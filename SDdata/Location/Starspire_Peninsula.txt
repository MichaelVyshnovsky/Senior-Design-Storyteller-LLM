The '''Starspire Peninsula''' was a rocky and sparsely-inhabited peninsula, part of the [[County Starspur]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
The majority of the Starspire Peninsula was covered in hard to traverse mountains, speckled with sea caves and cliffs, and inhabited by monsters.

==Geography==
[[File:Lands of intrigue - War in Tethyr.png|thumb|''The location of Starspire Peninsula on a map of [[Tethyr]].''| 350x350px]]
The Starspire Peninsula was imaginatively named after the mountain chain that was part of it â€“ the [[Starspire Mountains]]. The peninsula was framed by the [[Bay of Bormul]] to the south and the [[Firedrake Bay]] to the north. Further north, past the Firedrake Bay, was the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]] that laid parallel to the Starspire Peninsula. The town of [[Port Kir]] stood not far from the peninsula's northern edge, and the [[Trade Way]] ran perpendicular to the peninsula, separating it from the rest of Tethyr.

==Government==
The Starspire Peninsula was a virtually ungoverned region. It was controlled by the County Starspur and its Count or Countess. The Countess ''circa'' [[1370 DR]] was [[Corinna Dezlentyr]] who elected to leave the monstrous inhabitants of the Peninsula alone, but kept its edges well patrolled to protect the rest of her domain.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Port Kir sent out a message to attract adventuring bands with marine experience. Several fishing ships went missing in presumably safe waters to the west of the regular fishing areas. The town's government knew nothing about the disappearances, but they knew that pirates were not to blame as there had been no buccaneer attacks on fishing vessels in ages. The culprit was the [[Split Mast tribe]] of seafaring [[orc]]s that recently claimed a lair on the rocky shores of the Starspire Peninsula.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Battles' End]], an old [[Calishite]]castle that stood on a high hill, 25 miles to the west of Port Kir..
*[[Cloister of St. Ramedar]] was a prison and a sanitarium for the mentally ill, run by the [[Ramedaran Brotherhood]], a monastic order in the [[church of Ilmater]].
*[[Mount Adiir]], one of the highest peaks in the Starspires, the location of the Cloister of St. Ramedar.

==Inhabitants==
Most inhabitants of the Starspire Peninsula were dangerous and deadly creatures and humanoids, including [[firedrake]]s, [[peryton]]s, [[displacer beast]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[bugbear]]s, constantly warring [[cyclopskin]], [[flind]]s, and [[werewolves]]. A large population of [[svirfneblin]] made home underneath the Starspire Peninsula and its mountains. And to the east from the peninsula, [[Balagos]] and the [[dragon]]s of the [[Wyrmwell]] were a constant threat to the region. The waters around the Peninsula were far from calm, they were plagued by hostile tribes of [[sea elves]], [[sahuagin]], and [[sea troll]]s.
