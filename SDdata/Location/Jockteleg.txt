'''Jockteleg''' was a floating [[Netheril|Netherese]] enclave notable for its population of [[human]]s permanently [[polymorph]]ed into [[voadkyn]].

==Geography==
The enclave floated near the [[Abbey Mountains]] and the river known as [[the Alley]].

==History==
Jockteleg was founded by the archwizard [[Quantoul]] in {{Yearlink|-2019}}, as a center for the [[Fields of Mythal|variator]] arts. In {{Yearlink|-1932}}, Quantoul started experimenting with the enclave's ''[[mythallar]]'', hoping to modify it to allow Jockteleg's residents to ''[[polymorph self]]'' at will. However, Quantoul miscalculated, and instead cast a permanent mass ''[[polymorph other]]'' on his city, transforming all its inhabitants into voadkyn, himself included. Quantoul was horrified, and immediately set about reversing the changes, to no avail. Fortunately, a curious side effect of the ''mythallar'' allowed the polymorphed citizens to retain their knowledge and personalities, as long as they remained within the enclave. Leaving Jockteleg would deteriorate their minds, causing them to act like true voadkyn.

The next centuries, particularly between {{Yearlink|-1205}} and {{Yearlink|-697}}, were spent rebuilding Jockteleg to better accommodate its giant-sized population. Quantoul continued his research into the polymorph phenomenon, but was not able to find a way to reverse the effect.

Other Netherese settlements were not interested in associating with the pseudo-voadkyn of Jockteleg, and the enclave found itself increasingly isolated. Instead, Jockteleg became a place of interest to other [[giant]] cultures: the [[Deshwind clan]] of [[cloud giant]]s visited in {{Yearlink|-642}}, and a delegation of [[storm giant]]s visited in {{Yearlink|-509}}.

Jockteleg was destroyed Although the enclave's ''mythallar'' exploded, some of the city's inhabitants were curiously teleported away from the blast to seemingly random locations. It was rumored that Quantoul was one of these survivors.

==Notable inhabitants==
