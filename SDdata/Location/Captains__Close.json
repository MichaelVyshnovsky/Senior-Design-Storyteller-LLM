        "Description": "The walled park was home to [[deer]]. It was one of the nicer parts of the city.",
        "Geography": "The park was located between [[Aldever's Street]] to the west and [[Reavers' Run]] to the east. It was located just north of the Luskan slums.\n\nThe residences of two of the five [[High Captains of Luskan]] were located within Captains' Close: [[Taerl's Fortress]] in the northwest and [[Suljack's Lodge]] in the southeast. Aldever's Street separated the park from a third Captain's residence, [[Ten Oaks]], and from the [[Ruins of Illusk]].",
        "History": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], High Captains [[Taerl]] and [[Suljack]] both enjoyed hunting within the park, often using only [[knives]] and [[javelin]]s and accompanied by their female admirers."
