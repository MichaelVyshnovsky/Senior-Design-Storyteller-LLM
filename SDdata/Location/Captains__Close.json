        "mainbody": "Captains Close, sometimes written as Captains Close, was a park in Luskans South Bank.\nThe walled park was home to deer. It was one of the nicer parts of the city.\nThe park was located between Aldevers Street to the west and Reavers Run to the east. It was located just north of the Luskan slums.\nThe residences of two of the five High Captains of Luskan were located within Captains Close Taerls Fortress in the northwest and Suljacks Lodge in the southeast. Aldevers Street separated the park from a third Captains residence, Ten Oaks, and from the Ruins of Illusk.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, High Captains Taerl and Suljack both enjoyed hunting within the park, often using only knives and javelins and accompanied by their female admirers."
