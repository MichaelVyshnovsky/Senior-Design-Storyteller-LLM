        "mainbody": "ragon Barrow was the name given to the tomb of Lady Tanamere Alagondar of the Alagondar royal family of Neverwinter.\nFrom above, the whole barrow had the unique appearance of a dragon in flight. It was made up of a series of flat-topped,  high mounds forming the wings, tail, and body, with a row of  tall, sharp white boulders that comprised spines along the dragons back. The entrance was concealed beneath one of these boulders.\nThe interior of the barrow consisted of dark, cramped passages and burial chambers made of packed dirt. It reeked of damp and death. There were several traps, including a false tomb containing stone sarcophagi rigged to release acrid dust on would-be tomb robbers.\nThe barrow was located about  southeast of Neverwinter. It lay amidst grassy hills not far from Neverwinter Wood, about  east of the High Road.\nLady Tanamere died sometime in the late 14 century DR while fighting alongside two parties of adventurers against the green dragon Azdraka. In accordance with her dying wishes, her barrow was erected near the location of the fateful battle and served as a tomb for herself and her fallen comrades.\nWhen the white dragon Cryovain attacked the region a century later, Townmaster Harbin Wester of Phandalin recalled the tales of Lady Tanameres deeds, and sought to send someone to raid the barrow and try to retrieve her dragon slayer sword.\nIn addition to Lady Tanamere, her squire and her horse were also interred in the barrow, along with four adventurers who perished alongside her in the battle with Azdraka. Finally, the bones of the dragon itself also lay near Lady Tanameres sarcophagus.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the tomb had become haunted by will-o-wisps."
