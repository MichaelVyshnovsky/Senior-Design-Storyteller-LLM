        "mainbody": "'''Haunghdannar''' was a small realm of seafaring [[dwarves]] located on the [[Sword Coast]] during the [[Age of the Proud People]]. They remained vigilant against the beasts of [[west Faerûn]], but were eventually driven mad by the time they spent at sea. Their nation had rather undefined borders.\n\nThe emblem of Haunghdannar was a left-facing fish over a mountain, encircled by a seven-pointed star.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Barrhindlun]]: The port city was believed to have collapsed into the sea, and was believed to remain under the waters beneath the 14{{th}}-century settlement of [[Leilon]].\n*[[Sonnmorndin]]: An island fortress built on [[Ruathym|Arauwurbarak]].\n*[[Southkrypt]]: Located beneath the mountains they referred to as the [[Maruutdin]], this subterranean dwarfhold defended the dwarves' eastern border.",
        "History": "The nation was founded on the coast of the [[Sea of Swords]], in the year {{Yearlink|-4974}}, by a group of dwarves who were believed to have a much larger, more prosperous dwarf kingdom. They were believed to have been armed with a mighty arsenal of [[magic]] [[weapon]]s, granting them strong defense against the [[goblinoid]]s and [[leucrotta]]s in the area. Around 300 years later, they completed construction on the fortress of Sonnmorndin on Arauwurbarak island, north of the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n\nIn the year {{Yearlink|-3389}} they sent out a fleet of ships, very few of which returned. It was believed the sea had driven the dwarves mad and, degenerating, the realm dwindled over time until it was overrun by the [[orc]]s, [[troll]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[bugbear]]s of the coastlands.\n\nIt was believed the survivors of Haunghdannar eventually became the [[Madbeards|Madbeard]] [[berserker]]s that raided [[Northlander]] ships from their island home in the [[Uttersea]]."
