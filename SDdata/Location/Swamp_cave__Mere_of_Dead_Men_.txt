The swamp cave was one of the caves in the Mere of Dead Men.
The cave was located near West Harbor.
The cave itself was inhabited by lizardfolk, who stored goods from unlucky travelers they killed.
This was one of the caves that the Harbormen knew was dangerous. For this reason, the Harbormen warned everyone to travel the roads, since straying from them would cause travelers to end up in places like this.
