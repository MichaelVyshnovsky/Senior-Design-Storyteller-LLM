        "Defenses": "The [[arcanist]]s of Xin'kar forged a [[wraith eidolon]] to protect their research facility from the dangers of the Neverwinter Wood.",
        "History": "Following the calamity of [[Karsus's Folly]] in the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, the [[Netherese enclave|flying cities]] of Netheril came crashing to the ground. During Xinlenal's descent, a circle of arcanists used their magic to protect part of the city and bring it safely down to an area of the Neverwinter Wood. The survivors renamed their new sanctum Xin'kar, and renewed their arcane scholarship. They focused their studies on the profound [[primal magic]] that emanated from the woods.\n\nAfter some time, the scholars Xin'kar reopened communication with survivors from Xinlenal and went to their aid. Those left in Xin'kar were overrun by Uthgardt barbarians, who founded the settlement of [[Vellosk]] in the lands surrounding the enclave.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] delved into the ruins of Xin'kar in search of some unknown relics. Their efforts were thwarted by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], who fought in service of [[Kyrn Whitesky]] of the [[Forsworn]]."
