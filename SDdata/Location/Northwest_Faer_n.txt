'''Northwest Faerûn''', generally referred to as '''the North''' or even '''the Savage North''',

The inhabitants of areas further south, in [[West Faerûn]], described this area in condescension as "the Savage North," which was a reference to the [[Savage Frontier]] and a time when its inhabitants were less civilized.

==Geography==
The North, savage as it was, was difficult to truly delimit, especially when its boundaries so often shifted depending on the person studying them. Most, however, would agree that its northern end followed the [[Spine of the World]] and the frozen wastes past it, while reaching as far south as [[Daggerford]], its southern border drawn east from there to the [[Sea of Swords]] and west, through the [[Mines of Dekanter]], to the great [[Anauroch]] desert. The nearby folk of the [[Dalelands]] and [[Cormyr]] generally accepted this notion, simplifying it to say that the [[High Moor]] was the North's southermost edge.

The broadest definition for the North came from faraway [[Calimport]], whose merchants amalgamated anything beyond their neighboring [[Tethyr]] into a singular ''"Barbaric"'' North, but even those cities who called the region home rarely agreed. Though the Silvaeren people of Silverymoon considered their northern walls its southernmost border, for example, the Gem of the North was distinctly northern territory to the Waterdhavians of the City of Splendors, whom used their own walls as the North's south-western bounds. 

===Flora & Fauna===
The woodlands of the North were primarily made up of broad-leafed deciduous trees, such as [[birch]]es, [[elm]]s, [[maple]]s, and [[oak]]s. In the northernmost reaches of the region, these deciduous trees gave way to coniferous ones, such as [[larch]]es, ponderosa [[pine]]s, [[spruce]]s, [[tamarack]]s, and white pines.

Just as defining the North proved difficult, attempts to divide it into smaller and more distinct regions were, in themselves, often inconsistent. The well-traveled and all-too-famous Volothamp, in the aforementioned guide, himself split it into a set of five: The [[Dessarin Valley]], along the matching [[River Dessarin]]; the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]] upwards of Waterdeep; the [[Frozenfar]]; and the rest, the Interior, making up the area surrounding Silverymoon and fellow [[Sundabar]]. Given the purposes of his work, Volo chose to exclude the [[High Forest]] from his categorization, though acknowledged that its size alone made it a worthy candidate.

====The Frozenfar====
{{Main|Frozenfar}}
This region encompassed the lands north of the [[Spine of the World]] mountains, including the coastal region of the [[Cold Run]], [[Icewind Dale]] and its [[Ten Towns]], the island of the [[Ice Peak]] and the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. While it was sparsely populated, it was the home of hale frontiersman, desperate runaways and the fierce [[Reghedmen|Reghed]] [[barbarian]]s.

:[[Spine of the World]]: While these wide-reaching mountains comprised a significant part of the Frozenfar, they extended far east beyond its borders, to the [[Ice Spires]] in the Silver Marches.

====High Forest====
{{Main|High Forest}}
This vast, densely-forested region was located just a bit ways west of the [[Anauroch]] desert.

====Savage Frontier====
{{Main|Savage Frontier}}
The great untamed lands that attracted outdoorsmen and pioneers alike encompassed the [[Fallen Lands]] in the east; the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], that stretched along the eastern and southern borders of the High Forest; and the [[Dessarin Valley]], that rest along its western trees. It included the great [[River Dessarin]], and the great many frontier settlements that popped up in the fertile lands that surrounded.

====Silver Marches====
[[File:Silverymoon Plains AFR.jpg|thumb|240px|''A band of adventurers braving the plains of the North.'']]
{{Main|Silver Marches}}
This confederation, formally known as [[Luruar]], was formed from a defensive alliance of [[human]]s, elves, and [[dwarves]] in the mountainous area to the north of the High Forest. At its center was the city of [[Silverymoon]], a place of learning and magic. It politically included the cities of [[Sundabar]], [[Everlund]], [[Mithral Hall]], [[Citadel Adbar]], and geographically sat atop the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] and the [[Fardrimm]] region of the [[Underdark]].

====Sword Coast North====
{{Main|Sword Coast North}}
The wild coast north of Waterdeep contained the cities of [[Luskan]] and Neverwinter, as well as the dangerous [[Mere of Dead Men]], the [[Sword Mountains]], and the enchanted [[Neverwinter Woods]]. The [[High Road]] ran along the length of the coast from Luskan to far south of Waterdeep.<ref>[[Ed Greenwood]] (1993). ''[[Volo's Guide to the North]]''. ([[TSR, Inc]]), p. 144. ISBN [[Special:BookSources/1-5607-6678-6|1-5607-6678-6]]. This barely tamed-region was protected by a partnership of the northern cities and towns known as the [[Lords' Alliance]].

====Utter North====
{{Main|Uttermost North}}
While this vast expanse continued well beyond northwest Faerûn, the icy wastes north of the Spine of the World comprised the western section of the [[Endless Ice Sea]], the unexplored [[Reghed Glacier]], and the [[Valley of Khedrun]], along with a few scattered landmarks.
