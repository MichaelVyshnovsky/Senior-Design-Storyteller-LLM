'''End's Rest''' was a college for [[healer]]s located in the city of [[Heliogabalus]] in [[Damara]] around [[1374 DR]].

The college was managed by a group of worshipers of [[Ilmater]]. These healers tended to the city's defenders, including [[paladin]]s and recruits, as well as the sick and injured of the community and pregnant women.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Scouts and Healers}}
