Qudra served as Zakhara's bastion against the [[Zakharan pantheon|unenlightened]] lands outside its borders. The city's fortifications were increased over a long history of pirate raids and barbarian incursions. As of [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}}, Qudra had the strongest bulwarks in all of Zakhara, presenting a stern gray face to the north.",
        "History": "Qudra was ruled by [[Mamluk]]s who were fiercely devoted to the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]]. It was considered one of the three great cities of [[Zakhara]].<ref>  This city was noted for its well run and well-treated slave market, its mamluks, armor, and trade in northern goods."
