        "mainbody": "The City of Glass was a metropolis in the Elemental Plane of Water. It was famed for its trade.\nThe city was located in an area where portals to other planes were common and relatively stable. The name came from the great dome of \"unbreakable\" glass that kept the water of the plane out. However, inside the sphere, the city was half full of water so those that needed water could live and trade inside the city. There were many openings in the sphere, allowing passage in and out of the city.\nThe city was roughly split in half between pockets of air and the normal water of the Elemental Plane of Water. This divide was about halfway through the city and in places even divided houses in half. The locals agreed that \"down\" meant towards the side of the city in the water. The base of the city was made out of eternal ice. The air of the city was an air bubble trapped in between the glass dome and the ice sheet under the dome.\nThe City of Glass was ruled by a governing council of 15. They were elected from the peoples of the city every five years. The ruling council could have no more than one member of any race, which meant that normally one of each of the major races in the city was elected to the council. However, those who get elected were most often members of major merchant families, because of the massive bribes being paid by the merchants to get elected and the gangs of each district using intimidation so that certain candidates won.\nAfter many years of rule by the shah Tamuz Alrahad, a marid noble, the city had grown and the other races started to far outnumber and even outperform the marids, and at times became discontent with how the city was run and the tribute they had to pay. One day, the storyteller Jalal Dragonblood, a half-dragon elf descended from a gold dragon, entered the shahs palace and provided a night of entertainment with this tales. In the end, the shah asked him what payment he could give the man. Jalal instead asked him to accept a wager that he could get the sun to shine on the dome in seven days, with the reward for winning being that the city would be turned over to the merchants and if he lost he would instead serve the shah forever. The shah accepted this bet and Jalal departed. Finally, on the seventh day, Jalal returned, riding on a dragon and through a portal to the Plane of Radiance above the city, bathing the city in awe-inspiring light and winning the bet. Thus humbled, Tamuz turned over rule of the city.\nThe \"unbreakable\" glass of the city had in fact been broken. The authorities quickly sealed the hole and put the visitors, whose reckless spellcasting made the hole, to death.\nThe Ale District was inhabited by dwarves, though many gnomes also lived there. It was famed for its brewing and gemcraft.\nThe most prominent family of the district was the Silverpick family. The Hatchets were a local gang of young dwarves that could not make the cut for the guard they protected the interests of the Silverpick family and helped ensure that the elections would always go their way. Silverpick Tower was the main home and fortress of the family and it was a masterpiece of dwarven defensive engineering.\nRutgers Outfitters was a shop in the district that sold dwarven gear. They specialized in things that would help adventures travel the planes.  Element-Ale was one of the oldest brewhouses in the city and was famous for both being a place where merchants could buy ale wholesale and where locals and travelers could gather at the bar.\nAlcazar was a district ruled over by the marids and their jann servants. The shah who once ruled the city was still the leader of the marids, though there were only around 20 remaining. The district was mostly inhabited by the jann who served the marids. The Shahs Palace could be seen anywhere in the city.\nThe Berg was the edge of the city where the merfolk lived and stayed while they were in the city. The merfolk of this area were the underclass of the city. They took stuff out of the city for disposal, herded sea creatures outside the city and brought them in to sell the goods they produced from them, cleaned the dome of algae from the outside.\nThere was a shrine of Eadro, the god of the merfolk in the area.\nThe Central District was where most humans lived in the city. This district specialized in catering to air-breathing travelers, namely transporting them and having places for them to stay at.\n* Coral District sea elves\n* The Deeps kuo-toa\n* Teelake nixies\n* Jewelers District halflings\n* Drakes End half-dragons and humans  \n* Reverie cloud giants, nereids, and sirines\n* Sharktooth sahuagin\n* Wormtown ormyrr"
