The '''United Moonshae Isles''' was a kingdom of the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the [[Sea of Swords]] found in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

==History==
It was established by High Queen [[Alicia Kendrick]] of the [[Ffolk]] in the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], after the [[Northmen]] kings of the Sea of Moonshae, at the encouragement of King [[Olafsson]], swore fealty to her. During a glorious ceremony, High Queen Alicia signed a proclamation that established the United Moonshae Isles. This act united the two peoples under a single banner for the first time in their fractious history.

The United Moonshae Isles remained in effort by [[1479 DR]], when it was ruled by High King [[Derid Kendrick]].

==Government==
The United Moonshae Isles were ruled over by the High Kings and Queens of the [[Kendrick]] dynasty.

Retaining their traditional lands and power, the former Northmen kings were retitled as Jarls.

==Symbol==
The coat of arms of the United Moonshae Isles was the same as that of the reigning [[Kendrick]] family: a [[bear]]'s head. It was displayed on banners and shields where the high king or high queen reigned.
