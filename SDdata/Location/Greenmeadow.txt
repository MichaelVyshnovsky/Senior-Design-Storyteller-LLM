Greenmeadow was a grassy meadow north of Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet.
The meadow was separated from the city by the River Ardulith. Its primary function was to provide a place for the elves to keep their horses while in the city.
There were typically around a hundred moon horses in the Greenmeadow and they were allowed to freely roam rather than being restricted to a stable.
