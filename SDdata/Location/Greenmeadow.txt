'''Greenmeadow''' was a grassy meadow north of [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of [[Evermeet]].

==Geography==
The meadow was separated from the city by the [[River Ardulith]]. Its primary function was to provide a place for the [[elf|elves]] to keep their [[horse]]s while in the city.

==Inhabitants==
There were typically around a hundred [[moon horse]]s in the Greenmeadow and they were allowed to freely roam rather than being restricted to a stable.
