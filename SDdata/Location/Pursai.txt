'''Pursai''' was a town in [[Laothan]] in [[Malatra]].{{Cite interactive atlas|C2aNElc.FCW}}

==Geography==
It stood amidst the jungles of northern Laothan, halfway along a trail linking [[Sayan]] and [[Nalamh]].

==Economy==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Pursai grew rich on the [[spice]] trade, particularly [[cocoa]], [[pepper]], [[saffron]], and [[vanilla]]. Spices were harvested in the surrounding lands.

==Legends==
A killer stalked Pursai. Local spice harvesters were attacked at random and brutally murdered, but the killer disappeared before he could apprehended. Dubbed "the Old Man of Pursai", he was thought to be a mad hermit or even a [[ghost]]. Although a reward was set, no one had yet been able to capture him as of around [[1357 DR]].
