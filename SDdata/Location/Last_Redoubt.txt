The '''Last Redoubt''' was a war camp established during the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.

==Description==
It was used as a staging point by the [[Neverwinter Guard]] and their allied forces to launch their ground assaults against the fortress-city of [[Helm's Hold]], while it was held by the Prophet [[Rohini]] and the [[Ashmadai]].

==Geography==
The camp was located just west of [[Helm's Hold]], separated from the city by the the Blasted Battlefield that was largely overrun by [[devil]]s and Ashmadai cultists.

==Government==
While there was no city officials in the camp to speak of, the guard's forces were led by Captain [[Dunfield]] of the Neverwinter Guard, who was supported by Brother [[Theodosian]] of the local [[Helmite]] clergy.

==Trade==
Several merchants set up stalls within the camp, including [[Thoroar|Thoroar the Mediogre]].

==Defenses==
The camp was sparsely defended save for wooden palisades and tall lookout towers manned by archers.

==History==
It was the Last Redoubt that Captain Dunfield fell back to after his first failed assault to take back Helm's Hold. After regrouping he worked with the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to reconnect pockets of resistance found across the battlefield and throughout the city, and unite them in striking out against the devils of the [[Nine Hells]] and reclaiming the city of [[Helm]].
