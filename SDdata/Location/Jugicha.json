        "mainbody": "'''Jugicha''' was a city in the [[Plain of Horses]] of northwestern [[Kara-Tur]]. It was the home of the [[Tsu-tsu]] tribe and the second-largest city of the Plain of Horses after [[Li-Raz]].",
        "Geography": "It lay at the western foot of the [[Chigidi Mountains]], beside the [[Chukei Plains]]. Roads led northeast to [[Li-Raz]] and north to [[Haxkhun]] and eventually [[Peqqir]].",
        "History": "Around {{YearlinkConvert|2100|SY}}, a band of rebels split from the [[Fankiang]] city of Li-Raz. They desired to found their own community, and so settled Jugicha. This triggered a realignment of the ''hsing'' (clans), of the Plain of Horses, ultimately giving rise to the Tsu-tsu tribe.\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2587|SY}}, the ''qaghan'' (ruler) of the Tsu-tsu and Jugicha was [[Shajji Ghoiji]]. Ghoiji was corrupt and his government fell into chaos and finally rebellion. Ghoiji's ''apa qaghan'', his assistant and brother [[Shajji Hoijarek]], stepped in, gathering capable advisors to his side and becoming ''qaghan'' in his place. Over the next two decades, Hoijarek worked to reestablish order in Jugicha and revive Tsu-tsu prosperity.\n\nHoijarek remained as ''qaghan'' of Jugicha and the Tsu-tsu around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.",
        "Description": "Jugicha held a number of temples staffed by [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]]s.",
        "People": "The Tsu-tsu people of Jugicha were considered to be superb herders, hunters, and producers of livestock. They were semi-nomadic, spending most of their year on the steppes, before returning to their villages or the city of Jugicha. Thus, each Tsu-tsu family had two homes: tents in the summer and brick houses in the winter."
