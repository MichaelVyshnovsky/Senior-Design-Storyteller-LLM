Telflamm was usually considered to be the biggest and most important port city in Thesk however, Telflamm was actually an independent city-state with subject-cities of Nyth and Culmaster under its control. Telflamm wielded so much power and influence over the country of Thesk that it might as well have been the capital.
Telflamm was a walled city with skyline dotted with numerous temples and civic buildings, all constructed in a distinct onion-shape.
Shemszarr Square was at the center of the citys commerce. Many of its merchants and trading company headquarters were located around the square, including the Thayan Enclave. Shemszarr Square stood just to the north from the Temple of Waukeen and Castle Balindre, which was perched high on a cliff above the waters of Heskel Cove. The square was separated from the Castle by the Old Gate. To the east from Shemszarr Square stood the House of the Masters Shadow, a temple of Mask.
Heskel River flowed into Heskel Cove. At least two bridges were strewn across it, towards the Merchants Fortress on the rivers saunter bank. Even further south from Heskel River stood the Temple of Shaundakul.
The Shou Town was Telflamms poorer quarter, situated on the outskirts of the citys southern border, behind a wall. The Shou Town was decidedly more eastern in nature. The architecture was distinctly Kara-Turan, the businesses and the people were mostly Shou. The quarter was built by merchants, immigrants, and refugees from the eastern realms. Few major merchants could be found here, and most residents lacked wealth and luster but compensated for it in kindness. The only exception was the yakuza gang of the Nine Golden Swords.

Telflamm was settled in the  by Windyn Balindre, who moved his base of operations from Impiltur to this newly-built settlement and declared himself Merchant Prince, a hereditary title. House Balindrs own company, Royal Company of Shou Lung, established most of the Golden Way. Situated at the start of that incredibly profitable trade way, Telflamm quickly became the biggest trading station in the region, with most trade concerning the products of Kara-Tur which was in wide demand across Faerûn.
Telflamm was later established as a royal city-state in the , after annexing cities of Nyth and Culmaster. This birthed the nation of Telflamm.
The thieves guild of Telflamm was established in the , later to become the infamous Shadowmasters of Telflamm. In the subsequent years, the guilds influence was so great to prevent the Hierarch of Telflamm from officially joining the nation of Thesk. The Hierarch was convinced by the guild that Telflamm was snubbed by the leaders of Phsalt and Milvarune, electing to remain independent and kept its satellite cities of Culmaster and Nyth.
Around the 900s DR, Graldor "One-Hand", the leader of the adventuring Company of the Collar, entered the city of Telflamm. He proceeded through the streets of the city, weeping and carrying the body of his lover, swordmaid Evlanna. The mourning adventurer entered the Tower of Tempus begging for Evlannas resurrection. Graldor paid for the service with his unique blade – Galathos that was believed to have been lost for over two centuries. The story of the weeping adventurer and his lover became a well-known tale among inhabitants of Telflamm.
In the , Telflamm announced its independence after Princess Delile Balindre renounced loyalty to the one-time ally nation of Impiltur.
In the , Telflamms throne belonged to Prince Thaum Balindre, son of Kuskur Balindre. His main contribution to the history books was the assassination of his uncle–Lashilmbrar “the Sly”, son of Imphras II.
A grand temple heist, letter known as the Night of the Fontshuffle, happened in the . Shadowmasters were expanding their influence and demanded more protection money from the temples of Telflamm. Those who refused found collections of holy relics and divine magic items strewn across each other temples as a show of force and intimidation tactics. The Night of the Fontshuffle was enough to convince all temples of the city-state to pay.
The  welcomed the Red Wizards of Thay into the city-state. The enclave rapidly grew and became the biggest distribution center for Thayan magical goods across the northern Faerûn.
In the , a new High Priest of the Tower of Tempus, the High Priest and Champion Rampant of Tempus Taeron, took office and promptly refused to pay the Shadowmasters protection racket. In retaliation, Shadowmasters pulled a daring heist and claimed several magic items two enchanted swords, (including Galathos), a helm of brilliance, and the Red Book of War, a priceless relic of the Tempuran faith. These items sparked internal struggle within the thieves guild, which resulted in several members deaths. Soon after, Tempuran clergy reclaimed the stolen magic items however, the Red Book was lost, thought to have been taken somewhere far away from Telflamm. Galathos was believed to have been recovered as well, whoever, in truth, it was still being actively searched for as of the late-14 century DR.
In the  Telflamm became an integral part of the war between the invading Tuigan Horde and the united armies of Faerûn under the command of King Azoun Obarskyr IV. The free city of Telflamm initially served as a rendezvous point for Azouns Cormyrean ships and some of the Alliance armies. From there, King Azoun planned to move north and join with troops of King Torg mac Cei of Earthfast and temporary allies – Zhentil Keep. The harbors of Telflamm took on around two hundred ships of the Alliance and supplied them with horses, livestock, mobile forges, and other general supplies. The invasion forced many unlikely and shaky alliances, including one between Telflamm and Tammar. Azoun Obarskyrs Alliance forced returned to the city-state of Telflamm after strengthening its ally numbers, of orcs, dwarves, and humans of various nations. By that time, refugees flooded the city as the Tuigan Horde approached Thesk, looming only 500 miles to the east. The influx of refugees brought out Telflamms vice, corruption, thievery, and crime were on the rise, black markets exploited the need for food and cloth, and even started dealing in human lives. Makeshift coliseums and brothels sprung through Telflammm, leaving the city guard undermanned and prone to bribery and corruption. The Alliance army took Telflamms government offices as a temporary headquarters. With armies of the Alliance assembled, King Azouns forces moved east to face Yamun Khahans Tuigan Horde. The Crusades resulted in Tuigan defeat however the war left Telflamm overflowing with refugees, and its security weakened for years that followed. The Tuigan invasion left Thesk a ruined and desolate land as their armies moved along the Golden Way.
Another fallout from the Tuigan war was the Pirates of the Fallen Stars, who seized on Telflamms weakness. The pirates knew the city had no naval power and rolled in to create a safe haven for themselves. In the , Telflamm meekly welcomed the pirates of the Sharkjaws flotilla under Evgruth the Reds command and the significant wealth they brought along.
The Shadowmasters ambitions next target were the orc marauders who stayed behind after the Tuigan war. The guild offered a bounty on the heads of any orcs roaming Thesk. Soon, the security was bought back to the Golden Way. In a similar manner, Shadowmasters exerted pressure on the Merchant Prince and the council, displacing refugees away from Telflamm via a promise of land. The refugees were promised that any land they were to build a home on and live on for a year would become their property.
On Midwinter of the , a strange ice storm raged along the eastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The foul weather has awoken many ghosts and sea zombies of dead pirates who attacked the city-state of Telflamm. The Church of Tempus successfully drove the undead horde back into the sea.
The last Balindre Prince died some time during or after the Spellplague, leaving the Merchants Council in charge of the government, but the Shadowmasters remained the true power in the city.
