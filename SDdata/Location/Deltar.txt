'''Deltar''' was a large town found in southern [[Thindol]] on the mouth of the [[Thingulph]].

==Geography==
Deltar was situated on a small peninsula along the Thingulph's western rim near its halfway point.

==Description==
A large number of submerged islets were found directly offshore from Deltar. An equally large number of wrecked ships were also found in the waters.

==Inhabitants==
Delta was home to fisherfolk, clammers, and deep sea divers. Some of Deltar's more nefarious citizens waved lanterns at approaching ships during thunderstorms with the hopes of luring them into foundering on the islets. Though the holds of the many wrecked ships contained loot and treasure, a variety of dangerous sea creatures who laired in the waters often claimed any [[rogue]] brash enough to brave the waters in pursuit of such "easy" pickings.
