        "Description": "Tenmei, the second largest island in Kozakura, was positioned to the north of [[Shinkoku]], forming the northern limit of the [[Inland Sea]]. While the central mountainous region of Tenmei did not reach the same towering heights as those in Shinkoku, its peaks were characterized by steeper inclines and dense forest cover. The northeastern portion, near [[Tanegawa]], was marked by the [[Gosuki Range]], while the southwestern section is recognized as the [[Teeth of Kanfu]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The densely forested Gosuki Range in Tenmei was home to the largest population of [[korobokuru]] in Kozakura. The [[human]] inhabitants of Tenmei, recognizing the challenging nature of mining metals in the inhospitable high mountains, willingly yielded this occupation to the korobokuru residing there.\n\nInstead, humans in Tenmei sustained themselves through rice farming and fishing in the Inland Sea. Additionally, they engaged in trade, particularly in [[ceramic]]s crafted from the distinctive [[clay]]s discovered near the city of [[Yoshida]]. Yoshida served as the capital of [[Tenmei Province]] and was the seat of power for the shugo-daimyo [[Suzuki Motosune]].\n\nTo the north, the town of [[Tanegawa]] was inhabited by both humans and korobokuru. The port of Tanegawa facilitates the trade of [[tin]] and [[copper]], as well as clandestine activities involving the smuggling of luxury goods from the island of [[Eburishima]].\n\n[[Oni]] lived in the mountains and the [[Kanfu Forest]].\n\nThis island housed the [[Red Fog]] cult, a dissident sect of the [[Konjo]] school. The Red Fog cult lived around [[Daidake]], a volcanic region."
