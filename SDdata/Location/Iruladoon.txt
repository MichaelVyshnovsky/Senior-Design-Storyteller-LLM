'''Iruladoon''' was a quasi-extraplanar forest that was located on the eastern bank of [[Lac Dinneshere]] in [[Icewind Dale]].<ref> It was created by [[Mielikki]] specifically for her apparent [[Chosen]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], in order to house and instruct his friends, the [[Companions of the Hall]], prior to their reincarnations. 

[[Catti-brie]] and [[Regis]] were the first to arrive here after their deaths in [[1385 DR]]. ) but the other three were reborn on [[Toril]] in the year [[1463 DR]]. 

In [[1466 DR]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his companions at the time ([[Dahlia Sin'felle]], [[Artemis Entreri]], [[Ambergris (person)|Ambergris]], [[Afafrenfere]], and [[Effron]]) presumably spent a night here that turned out to last eighteen years in the outside world.
