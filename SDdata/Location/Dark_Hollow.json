        "Geography": "It lay on the crossroads of the [[Hlintar Ride]] and [[Feldar's Trail]], between [[Bambryn]], [[Fallentree]], [[Dragon Falls]], and [[Highbank Forest]], in the [[Fire River]] uplands.",
        "Description": "Dark Hollow was a small village named for the valley it sat in, which was shaded by many trees.",
        "Inhabitants": "It had a reputation as a strange and hazardous place, where [[faerie dragon]]s played, intruders were the victims of practical jokes by [[brownie]]s and other forest folk, and common [[animal]]s were the [[familiar]]s of crazed [[wizard]]s. These wizards were said by other folk to make their homes in rundown cabins in the forest, and to be conducting dangerous experiments with new [[spell]]s that would let them one day take over the world.\n\nThere were many hedge wizards in Dark Hollow, of all kinds and practices. With [[magic]] being an expensive practice, most of their wealth was tied up in [[magic item]]s and supplies. They kept their valuables cleverly hidden, well-guarded, and trapped. A few built [[wand]]s into their desk to fire at those in front of them. Some had their small familiars carry these items piece by piece to otherwise-inaccessible locations. On occasion, taking advantage of Dark Hollow's fearsome reputation, thieves buried their loot in the village, only to have a familiar find it and their wizard claim it and spend it.\n\nBut for all their magic, these hedge-wizards were often broke, and lived day-to-day on [[potion]] sales just to have basic food to eat. \"Magic [[merchant]]s\" of [[Ravens Bluff]] and [[Hlintar]] did good trade buying their potions and selling them [[spell component]]s and pieces of broken magic items and [[artifact]]s in exchange. Thieves and bandits preyed on the trade, so guarding them was also a steady job.",
        "Leadership": "Dark Hollow was ruled by Lord [[Malaph Serpentshield]], one of the wealthiest petty lords in the area."
