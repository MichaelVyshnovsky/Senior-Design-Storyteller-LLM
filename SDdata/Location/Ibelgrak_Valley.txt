'''Ibelgrak Valley ''' was a valley in the [[Angalpuk]] region within the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
The Ibelgrak Valley was a shallow valley located in the south-east of the Angalpuk region. It was bordered by two mountain ranges, the [[Angsaas Chain]] to the east and the [[Lugsaas Chain]] to the south. In the center of the valley was the [[Ahtahqugotak Sea]]. 

==Flora & Fauna==
Due to a very thin permafrost, the Ibelgrak Valley was the most fertile location on the Great Glacier. It was home to forests of evergreen and [[willow]]. Its meadows were filled with [[timothy (plant)|timothy]] and [[chickweed]], and were ideal grazing grounds for [[caribou]]. The valley was home to a number of animal species, including [[polar hare]]s, [[silver foxes]] and [[musk oxen]].

==Inhabitants==
A small [[Angulutiun]] tribe lived within the valley with a herd of caribou of abut two hundred head. They were nomadic yet never left the confines of the valley. They were the descendants of infected Angulutiun who fled into the valley with their infected caribou. They had large warts on their faces and hands, and their caribou had the same warts on the back and leg. The virus was dormant but the inhabitants and caribou of the valley were killed on sight if they wandered outside the valley.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|460}}, a deadly plague was brought to Angalpuk by treasure hunters from [[Sossal]]. The disease decimated the Angulutiuns and caribou populations. Some of the infected fled into the valley, were their descendants currently live.

==Notable Locations==
