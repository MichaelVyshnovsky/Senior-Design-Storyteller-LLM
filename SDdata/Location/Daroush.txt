}}'''Daroush''' was a small mining village located in the [[Aphrunn Mountains]].

==Geography==
Daroush lay at the eastern end of [[Lilit Pass]] in the Aphrunn Mountains.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p42">

==Trade==
Daroush traded ores from its mines. [[Gold]] was one of the main metals mined in Daroush.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p42"/> Nearby towns like [[Aelor]] relied heavily on Daroush's gold trade. Once the mine dried up, the inhabitants of Aelor migrated to [[Amah]].<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p42"/>

==Defenses==
Unsurprisingly, considering its size, Daroush had few defenses.<ref group="note">The village was captured without raising a sword in 145 DR, and in 1370 DR, the miners sought adventurers for protection. This suggests that the village had little or (more likely) no militia.

==History==
Daroush was established in [[50 DR]]<ref name ="tGHotR-p94"> as a dwarven mining colony. At some point, after the mines ran dry, the dwarves abandoned Daroush and returned to [[Alaoreum]].<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p42"/>

In [[145 DR]], a small segment of [[Dempster Turmish]]'s army accidentally marched into [[Lilit Pass]] and ended up in Daroush. The troops captured the village without raising a sword.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p5">

By [[1370 DR]] the mining village was almost completely empty. Some humans still mined for gold, but the best ore had been extracted by the dwarven founders of the mine.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p42"/>

==Rumors and Legends==
As of 1370 DR, there were reports of dark dwarves (likely [[duergar]]) roaming the mine shafts. This lead to the miners seeking adventurers to protect them and investigate the sightings.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p42"/>
