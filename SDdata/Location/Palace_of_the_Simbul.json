        "mainbody": "The '''Palace of the Simbul''' (or '''Simbul's Palace''') was a palace in [[Veltalar|Velprintalar]] (now called Old Velprintalar) and the home of [[the Simbul]], queen of [[Aglarond]] from [[1320 DR]] to [[1425 DR]]. The palace is constructed from green stone from [[Mulhorand]] and is situated on a hill that overlooked Velprintalar. It was protected by a host of magical measures. By [[1479 DR]], the palace was being used by the [[Simbarch of Aglarond|Simbarch Council]]. During the Simbul's reign, she was not present at the palace very often, but it was occupied by her servants, as well as the [[Foresters]], [[Royal Council of Aglarond|coucillors]] and [[Yuir]] elves.",
