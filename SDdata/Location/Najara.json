        "mainbody": "Najara, a large kingdom in the Western Heartlands, was inhabited by a wide variety of nagas, yuan-ti, and lizardfolk.\nIt comprised parts of the High Moor, the Forest of Wyrms, and the Marsh of Chelimber, with the Serpent Hills lying in the center.\nNot operating as a typical state, its status as a kingdom is a disputed subject.\nCirca 1474 DR, Jarant killed the previous King of Snakes Ebarnaje, triggering a civil war and increasing yuan-ti and lizardfolk activity in the area. This made Najara more relevant to Elturgard and Evereska.\nDue to more nations gaining knowledge of Najara, it became a subject of interest for its many ancient ruins, including some from the Netherese empire and the kingdom of Boareskyr.\nThe main deity of this land was Sseth, but with some yuan-ti becoming increasingly disappointed in him, they turned to the forbidden, worshiping Zehir.\n* Forest of Wyrms\n* Serpent Hills\n* Crypt of the Six\n* Heartwing Estate\n* Serpents Cowl\n* Sskhanaja\n* Ssthartissssun (Former capital)\n* Sszuraassnee\n* Ssessethenaa\n* Thardresk Crypt"
