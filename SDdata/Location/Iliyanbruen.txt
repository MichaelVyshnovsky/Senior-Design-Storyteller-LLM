'''Iliyanbruen''' was an [[elf|elven]] survivor-state of [[Illefarn]] that encompassed most of [[Neverwinter Wood]].

==History==
Iliyanbruen was founded around {{Yearlink|-1100}}, after the dissolution of Illefarn. During this time, the elven kingdom was known for its seemingly unending wars with the various incarnations of [[Illusk]]. After the [[Karsus's Folly|destruction]] of [[Netheril]] in {{Yearlink|-339}}, the elves of Iliyanbruen decided to protect the location of fallen [[Xinlenal]] and maintained it a secret, deeming that the [[wild magic]] of the malfunctioning [[mythallar]]s of the [[Netherese enclave]] could destroy [[Neverwinter Wood]] if misused.

A few years later, the elves of Iliyanbruen helped Netherese survivors and the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]] with the building of [[Gauntlgrym]]. Elven [[wizard]]s helped [[Maerin]] of Illusk to extend the reach of the "roots" of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in Illusk to carry the cooling waters of the sea to the sealed [[primordial]] [[Maegera|Maegera the Inferno]].

In {{Yearlink|-111}}, Iliyanbruen helped the settlements of the North against the [[Orc Marches]].<ref name=tGHotR-p57/> The combined effort of Iliyanbruen, [[Rilithar]], [[Siluvanede]], and [[Eaerlann]] halted the tide, but not before both Illusk and Gauntlgrym were lost.<ref name=tGHotR-p57/> Delzoun was greatly weakened, collapsing almost two centuries after.

In {{Yearlink|-12}}, Iliyanbruen went to war against the [[orc]]-dominated Illusk, and led by Lord [[Halueth Never]], the elves defeated the Illuskans with a decisive victory in {{Yearlink|-10}}. In {{Yearlink|-4}}, the leaders of Iliyanbruen made peace with the [[human]] survivors of Illusk, setting a border between their kingdoms at the [[River Mirar]].<ref name=tGHotR-p59> 

Eventually, Iliyanbruen had to face the orcs of the [[Severed Hand]] and Argrock (later [[Luskan]]).<ref name=tGHotR-p66/> Many of its [[high elf]] inhabitants traveled to [[Evermeet]] or south to [[Ardeep]], leaving only scattered [[wood elf]] settlements and the abandoned capital of [[Sharandar]] behind.<ref name=tGHotR-p66/> 

Not all high elves went to Everment or to Ardeep, however. Although it was no easy task because of the interference of the dark [[fey]], a few high elves used a powerful [[ritual]] to transport parts of Sharandar to the [[Feywild]]. There they rebuilt Iliyanbruen, where it thrived for the next thousand years.

With the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], when the Feywild was realigned with Toril once again, the [[Noble eladrin|eladrin]] of the Feywild's Iliyanbruen returned to Toril to see what had happened to their ancestral lands. Enraged at the desecration of their fallen lands by the [[Shadovar]],
