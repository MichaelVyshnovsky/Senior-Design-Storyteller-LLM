'''Helligheim''' (meaning "'''Holy Home'''" in the [[giant language]]) was an ancient [[fire giant]]-ruled kingdom in [[Faerûn]], during the [[Time of Giants]] of the [[Dawn Age]] ({{Yearlink|-30000}} to {{Yearlink|-24000}}).

==Geography==
The southern borders of this kingdom stretched along the [[Dragon Sea]].{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep|49-50}}

==History==
In the year {{Yearlink|27900}}, the fire giants of this kingdom established twelve mighty fortresses along the shore of the Dragon Sea.

A century later, it would be one of the kingdoms that fought in the [[Thousand Year War]] against the ancient [[dragon]] kingdoms. Over the course of this war, Helligheim was gradually made isolated from the rest of [[Ostoria]] and terribly weakened. One by one the dragons overran and shattered their fortresses along the Dragon Sea's coast. By the time the [[King-Killer Star]] appeared in the sky, only [[Ironfang Keep|one remote keep]] in the [[Giantspike Mountains]] remained.

It was one of the few fragment kingdoms that survived past Ostoria's fall, but within a millennia it eventually fell. By some accounts, only surviving for another century or two. The jotunbrud gradually retreated further into the frozen north, their most powerful [[runecaster]]s sealing the last remaining keep.
