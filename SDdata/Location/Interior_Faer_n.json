        "mainbody": "The lands of '''interior Faerûn''' consisted of the nations, city-states and realms located along the irregular western coastline of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and the [[Shining Plains]] further south. In the north the [[Dragonmere]] arm of the sea extended far to the west, ending close to the [[Western Heartlands]]. The lands of the [[Vilhon Reach]] formed around a second arm of the sea that led to the southwest.",
        "Regions": {
            "Eastern Heartlands": "{{main|Eastern Heartlands}}\nThis region comprised civilized lands on the western and northern coasts of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and those surrounding the [[Dragonmere]]. It was home to many powerful [[human]] nations, along with power groups that held great influence over the Realms.\n* [[Cormyr]]: This was a prosperous, civilized realm that lay at the western end of the Sea of Fallen Stars, to the south of the [[Anauroch|Anauroch desert]] and the [[Dalelands]]. Cormyr was a unified monarchy with its capital at the port city of [[Suzail]]. Other notable cities in Cormyr included [[Marsember]] and [[Arabel]]. The prosperous core of the nation was warded by the [[Storm Horns]] to the west and the [[Thunder Peaks|Thunder Peak Mountains]] to the east.\n* [[Dragon Coast]]: This stretch of land was a lawless region of independent city-states, such as [[Westgate]] and [[Teziir]], [[pirate]]s enclaves, [[thieves]] dens, and secret societies. The forest realm of [[Gulthandor]] lay along the southern shore of the Dragonmere in its [[Gulthmere Forest|namesake forest]], north of the [[Shou]] state of [[Nathlan]] and the [[Shining Plains]].\n* [[Sembia]]: On the northwest shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars was this prosperous and ambitious nation of merchants and traders, that served as a vassal state of the returned [[Netheril]]. Much of the country was open farmland with no mountains and few woodlands, bisected by the prominent [[River Arkhen]]. Prominent cities included the capital of [[Selgaunt]], a title transferred from [[Ordulin]] when it was consumed in a [[Ordulin Maelstrom|planar rift]], the fortified city of [[Daerlun]], and the unstable port of [[Saerloon]].",
            "Pirate Isles": "{{Main|Pirate Isles}}\nThis rocky archipelago was located in the middle of the widest stretch of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], between Sembia to the west and [[Aglarond]] to the east. The largest of these islands, named [[Dragonisle]], had natural harbors that were home to fleets of pirates. When the waters of the sea receded during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the isles were formed and renamed to the singular [[Pirate Isle]].",
            "Shining Plains": "{{Main|Shining Plains}}\nThis expansive region of grasslands, south of the Dragon Coast, was home to intelligent, four-legged creatures including [[centaur]]s and [[wemic]]s. These flatlands were largely reshaped by the Spellplague, but returned to normal by the end of the 15{{th}} century.<ref name=\"SCAG-map>",
            "Vilhon Reach": "{{Main|Vilhon Reach}}\nNamed after the body of water that extended from the Sea of Fallen Stars, this stretch of coastland held the independent barony of [[Sespech]], the mercantile country of [[Turmish]], the once-glorious assembling of city-states known as [[Chondath]], before their destruction during the [[Spellplague]], and the serpentine realm of [[Hlondeth]].\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century, this region came to be known as the ''[[Vilhon Wilds]]''. It was rough-traveled, frontier land that grew over the destruction caused by the Spellplague.\n\n*[[Chondath]]: This belligerent nation comprised allied city-states including [[Arrabar]], [[Reth]], [[Hlath]], and [[Iljak]]. Their people were generally manipulative, inscrutable and distrusting of magic. After being largely transplanted to the world of [[Abeir]] in [[1386 DR]], the remnants of Chondath were largely ravaged during the [[Wailing Years]].{{Cite web/Dragon Features Archive|url=http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=10705|title=Spellplague: The Wailing Years|author=[[Brian R. James]]|date=2008-02-27|accessdate=2008-04-14}}\n*[[Hlondeth]]: South of the [[Orsraun Mountains]], this coastal city-state had long been ruled by the [[Yuan-ti]] of the [[Extaminos]] family.\n*[[Sespech]]: This militaristic barony became a minor naval power after gaining independence from Chondath. Its capital was the metropolis of [[Ormpetarr]], which greatly waned in population following the Spellplague.\n*[[Turmish]]: Prosperous and friendly for most of its history, the merchant nation became rather suspicious and xenophobic during the 15{{th}} century. The largest city and capital of this land was the port of [[Alaghôn]]."
