The '''Chabala Mere''' was a body of water in [[Sildëyuir]] on top of which sat the Causeway of [[Stardeep]]. It was fed by the [[Chabala River]].{{cite book/Stardeep|140-141|12}} The water was nearly freezing,{{cite book/Stardeep|145|12}} and the local [[star elves]] weren't sure it had a bottom.{{cite book/Stardeep|157|14}} When the land-bridge was closed by the magical defenses in Stardeep, the Chabala Mere became covered in mist.{{cite book/Stardeep|163|15}}{{cite book/Stardeep|180|16}}
