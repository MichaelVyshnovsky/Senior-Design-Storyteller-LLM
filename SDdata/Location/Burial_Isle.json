        "mainbody": "The '''Burial Isle''' was a small island in the waters of [[Maer Dualdon]] of [[Icewind Dale]], used as a sacred burial ground for the most heroic and honorable of heroes of the [[Reghedmen]] tribes.\n\n{{quote|''It's the island out in Maer Dualdon where all of the savages bury their dead war heroes. The locals avoid it as though Myrkul himself charged the toll for admission.''|[[Rawleigh Gallaway]]}}",
        "Description": "The Burial Isle was located roughly in the middle of Maer Dualdon near the town of [[Lonelywood]], but far enough to be only reachable by boat. The isle was a bleak and mostly barren place, hard to survive on. One would likely die of hunger or cold, if exiled to the Burial Isle, like some of the Reghedmen who disgraced themselves were. The waters of the lake were warm for the climate but still deadly  to swim across and there were no boats on the island.",
