        "mainbody": "Nangalore, once known as Ka-Nanji, was a lush garden located half a mile from the River Olung in Chult. It was built on the request of Queen Zalkoré of Omu. As of the late 15 century DR, the gardens lay in ruins and make the perfect lair for the queen-turned-medusa.\nThe gardens of Nangalore were filled with lush creepers and jungle plants, and stone statues in various states of ruin stood around the vast complex. Three main domed areas lay in the father parts of the garden, some having collapsed and fallen deeper into the jungles of Chult.\nSome carvings and statues were defaced when Zalkoré unleashed her anger at the different sculptures throughout the complex, leaving behind many different messages inscribed or scrawled in Old Omuan to go with them.\nThe whole garden of Nangalore was built from stones and was situated close enough to the River Olung that the entrance of the gardens was flooded by the rivers water, allowing for easier access by canoe.\nAmong the ruins, many jungle plants grew along with some hallucinogenic flora as well as myriad types of poisonous plants and animals. Some dangerous plants found within the garden included yellow musk creepers, mantraps, tri-flower fronds, and other hallucinogenic plants.\nMany poisonous types of animals took refuge in Nangalore including poisonous snakes, giant spiders, and even flying monkeys. It was said that a band of three chwingas lived in one of the domes somewhere in the eastern part of the garden. Zalkoré used eblises as spies and messengers, some of which also populated the vast garden.\nKa-Nanji, meaning the \"Hanging Garden of Dreams\", was constructed under the rule of Queen Zalkoré by her closest commander and consort, Thiru-taya. Once Zalkoré became corrupted and turned into a medusa by bargaining with erinyes, the army made the queen abdicate the throne. Zalkoré was then exiled by her highest generals, believed to include Thiru-taya, and all of his statues were defaced by Zalkoré in her rage.\nKa-Nanji came to be called Nangalore, meaning the \"Garden of Lost Dreams\", after Zalkoré was brought the ashes of Thiru-taya. After the sad turning of events, Zalkoré started cultivating hallucinogenic plants in Nangalore, for only their drugging effects could bring back the face of Thiru-taya.\nThe Omuan queen Zalkoré, dwelt within the gardens walls, and after her transformation into a medusa the gardens became her permanent lair.\nSomewhere within the ruins of Nangalore, a mage had perished in an assassin vine attack, and had in his possession a folding boat."
