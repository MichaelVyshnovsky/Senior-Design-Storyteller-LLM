        "History": "After the nearly successful conquest of Evermeet by [[Kymil Nimesin]] was thwarted, [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Queen Amlaruil]] gave the ''[[Tree of Souls]]'' to Lamruil and, at her urging, agreed to take the tree and establish an elven haven on the mainland. He indicated he would establish this location far into the northern reaches and departed both with elves formerly of Evermeet and displaced elves lured from other realms and his betrothed, [[Maura Silverhand]]. During the same {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Auseriel had been constructed.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Auseriel was [[Rage of Dragons|attacked]] by a group of [[white dragon]]s led by [[Harashnalthyn]] on [[Mirtul 2]]. At the insistence of Maura, Lamruil fled to Evermeet with the ''Tree of Souls''. Maura stayed to provide a rearguard and ensured the unhindered escape of the ''Tree of Souls''. Two days later on [[Mirtul 3]], Lamruil returned with a force of knights to find the city abandoned. His force found no trace of the rearguard aside from the corpses of several white wyrms. There was no sign of his wife; Lamruil vowed to rebuild and continue his search for Princess Maura Silverhand.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1380}}, Auseriel had been rebuilt and Lamruil left the city with [[Araevin Teshurr]] to search for Maura.<ref>{{cite web\n| url            = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1302398165455450118\n| title          = Twitter post\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n}}"
