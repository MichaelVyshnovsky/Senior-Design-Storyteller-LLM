        "mainbody": "Fortitude was a large gate-town leading to Arcadia from the Outlands. \nFortitude had neat roads and wide boulevards and was filled with fountains, luscious parks, groves and orchards. Only about half the town included actual buildings. Most of the buildings were several stories high, with the lower level made from stone and the upper levels of wood and mud topped by thatched roofs. The gate-town was home to several inns.\nThe gate-town was surrounded by a large wall in the shape of a perfect oval, hence the gate-towns nickname \"The Egg\". At one end of the town was the gate to Arcadia, and the other end was a stadium called the Confessional. The wall was dotted with several small entrances into the town.\nSitting atop a circular pyramid made from seven tiers, the Gate to Arcadia appeared as a large green flame. One merely had to step into the flame to travel to the plane.\nThis arena was constructed within a great pit in the ground. The craftsmanship of the stonework was superb, allowing for even the quietest of sounds to echo loudly throughout the arena. The primary purpose of the arena was as a location for individuals to announce the repentance of sins and accept punishment. A crowd gathered several times a week to hear the admittance of faults from confessors. It was a popular event since it was the crowd itself that determined punishment. Punishment varied and depended on the mood of the crowd. If a confessor refused punishment, they were jailed for their own protection. Despite this, many individuals volunteered freely to confess their misdeeds and sins.\nFortitude was ruled by a council of seven called the Secret Conclave. The entire Conclave was replaced by new members each time the Great Modron March visited the gate-town. During this even, the residents elected seven new members who were citizens of Fortitude. The winners of the election were kept secret."
