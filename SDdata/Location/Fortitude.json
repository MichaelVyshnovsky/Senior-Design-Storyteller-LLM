            "The Confessional": "This arena was constructed within a great pit in the ground. The craftsmanship of the stonework was superb, allowing for even the quietest of sounds to echo loudly throughout the arena. The primary purpose of the arena was as a location for individuals to announce the repentance of sins and accept punishment. A crowd gathered several times a week to hear the admittance of faults from confessors. It was a popular event since it was the crowd itself that determined punishment. Punishment varied and depended on the mood of the crowd. If a confessor refused punishment, they were jailed for their own protection. Despite this, many individuals volunteered freely to confess their misdeeds and sins."

        "Government": "Fortitude was ruled by a council of seven called the Secret Conclave. The entire Conclave was replaced by new members each time the [[Great Modron March]] visited the gate-town. During this even, the residents elected seven new members who were citizens of Fortitude. The winners of the election were kept secret."
