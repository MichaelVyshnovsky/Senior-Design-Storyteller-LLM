        "mainbody": "he Rotburg Slum was a poverty-stricken neighborhood located in the city of Almorel on the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands.\nThe Slum was not part of Almorel proper, sitting just outside of the citys protective walls to the west. A small unnamed tributary of the Lake of Mists further isolated the Rotburg Slum from the Golden Bridle caravanserai and other structures found outside Almorels western walls."
