Guilmarl was a series of ruins, formerly a large city, located in southern Dambrath.
Guilmarl was the southernmost city in Dambrath located along the coast on the Great Sea. Violent storms assaulted the city for the entire three-month rainy season. Many of the wealthier citizens opted to winter in calmer cities.
The close presence of the Great Swamp of Rethild to the west made Guilmarl a hot and stuffy place to live.
Many pirate and merchant ships harbored in Guilmarl outside of the rainy season, using the city as a launching point for Zakhara, Halruaa, and beyond. The main factor keeping the city from fading away was its superb pearl beds, allowing at least half of the population to earn a living revolving around the pearl trade.
Some time between 1367 and 1372 DR the city was destroyed and overrun by many lizardfolk and a large fang dragon.
Fewer crinti lived here compared to other cities in Dambrath. Most despised the scent of the Great Swamp and chose to live elsewhere. After 1372 DR no crinti lived in the city.
