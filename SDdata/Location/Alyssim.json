        "Society": "The people of Alyssim frowned upon [[half-elves]] and punished any elves who procreated with other species. Females were looked down upon in Alyssim society. The villagers worshiped [[Rillifane Rallathil]], and recognizing other deities was also frowned upon.",
        "Inhabitants": "Alyssim's most notable former inhabitant was [[Lyra Sunrose]], a half-elf who was shunned in the village and later became friends with [[Elminster]].",
        "History": "As of [[1367 DR]], the village no longer existed and its former site was overrun with [[stinkweed]]s, although the exact date and cause of its demise were not known.",
