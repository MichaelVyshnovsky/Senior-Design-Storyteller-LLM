'''Bloodstone Village''', later called '''Bloodstone City'''{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}} and sometimes called '''Bloodstone Gate''', was a settlement in [[Bloodstone Pass]], the only real accessible link between the lands of [[Vaasa]] and [[Damara]]. It was within the [[Barony of Bloodstone]] and later became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Bloodstone]] encompassing Damara and Vaasa. The city was razed in [[1469 DR]].

==Geography==
The village of Bloodstone lay on the shores of [[Lake Midai]], where it joined with the [[Beaumaris River]], which ran into the [[Galena Mountains]].

==History==
[[File:Bloodstone Village Map.jpg|thumb|326x326px]]
Before [[1347 DR]], Bloodstone Pass was an important trade route, which brought prosperity to Bloodstone Village as the second largest settlement in the Pass. However, when a [[dragon turtle]] was slain in the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] to the south that had been terrorized shipping routes, trade by sea was opened to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and the land route through Bloodstone Pass was less frequented.

In [[1347 DR]], Bloodstone Village was ravaged by the harsh [[Wolf Winter]], during which their crops died and starving [[dire wolves]] killed 70 of the village's inhabitants. Beginning the next year, the Bloodstone Pass became cut off from the rest of the Kingdom of Damara due to the [[Vaasan War|war with Vaasa]] to the north, and the baron of the time, Baron [[Tranth]], had little power over the dominion. Many settlements within the area were reduced to anarachy. In this anarchy came the [[Citadel of Assassins]] and their hold on the village. Bloodstone Village was forced to pay an annual tribute (two tendays after the annual harvest) in food, money, and slaves.

In [[1359 DR]], it became the home of the King of Damara, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], Beginning at this time, Baron Tranth began encouraging the King to annex Vaasa to create a unified kingdom of Damara and Vaasa called ''Bloodstone''. Before the end of his reign, Gareth Dragonsbane followed through on this idea. The capital of this kingdom was later moved from [[Heliogabalus]] to Bloodstone Village, which by this time had grown to be a large city known as Bloodstone Gate and later Bloodstone City.

In [[1460 DR]], the [[Warlock Knights]] of Vaasa rebelled against the Kingdom of Bloodstone,{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} and in [[1469 DR]], they burned Bloodstone City to the ground.{{BloodstoneCityRazing}} As of [[1480 DR]], the ruins were still garrisoned by the Warlock Knights.
