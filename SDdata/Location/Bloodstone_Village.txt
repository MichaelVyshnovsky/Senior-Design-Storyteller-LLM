Bloodstone Village, later called Bloodstone City and sometimes called Bloodstone Gate, was a settlement in Bloodstone Pass, the only real accessible link between the lands of Vaasa and Damara. It was within the Barony of Bloodstone and later became the capital of the Kingdom of Bloodstone encompassing Damara and Vaasa. The city was razed in 1469 DR.
The village of Bloodstone lay on the shores of Lake Midai, where it joined with the Beaumaris River, which ran into the Galena Mountains.

Before 1347 DR, Bloodstone Pass was an important trade route, which brought prosperity to Bloodstone Village as the second largest settlement in the Pass. However, when a dragon turtle was slain in the Moonsea to the south that had been terrorized shipping routes, trade by sea was opened to the Sea of Fallen Stars and the land route through Bloodstone Pass was less frequented.
In 1347 DR, Bloodstone Village was ravaged by the harsh Wolf Winter, during which their crops died and starving dire wolves killed 70 of the villages inhabitants. Beginning the next year, the Bloodstone Pass became cut off from the rest of the Kingdom of Damara due to the war with Vaasa to the north, and the baron of the time, Baron Tranth, had little power over the dominion. Many settlements within the area were reduced to anarachy. In this anarchy came the Citadel of Assassins and their hold on the village. Bloodstone Village was forced to pay an annual tribute (two tendays after the annual harvest) in food, money, and slaves.
In 1359 DR, it became the home of the King of Damara, Gareth Dragonsbane, Beginning at this time, Baron Tranth began encouraging the King to annex Vaasa to create a unified kingdom of Damara and Vaasa called Bloodstone. Before the end of his reign, Gareth Dragonsbane followed through on this idea. The capital of this kingdom was later moved from Heliogabalus to Bloodstone Village, which by this time had grown to be a large city known as Bloodstone Gate and later Bloodstone City.
In 1460 DR, the Warlock Knights of Vaasa rebelled against the Kingdom of Bloodstone, and in 1469 DR, they burned Bloodstone City to the ground. As of 1480 DR, the ruins were still garrisoned by the Warlock Knights.
