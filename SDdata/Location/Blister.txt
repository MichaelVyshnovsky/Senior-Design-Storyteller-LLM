'''Blister''' was a [[Netherese]] military outpost established in {{Yearlink|-1286}} in the mountains of southeast [[Netheril]].

==Defenses==
The outpost was so well defended that it survived beyond the fall of the Empire.

==Rumors and Legends==
There was a ''[[portal]]'' from the [[Temple of Tyche (Monksblade)|Temple of]] [[Tyche]] in what would later be known as the village of [[Monksblade]], [[Cormyr]].{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|23}}

==History==
Though not its official name (a name which, in [[Loross]], roughly translated as "All-Seeing Master of Lightning"), the soldiers stationed there colloquially referred to the outpost as "Blister", owing to the difficult life they led.

In {{Yearlink|-442}}, [[phaerimm]] attacked Blister. They destroyed many of the underground supply rooms and several connecting tunnels beneath the outpost. Blister's garrison came close to starvation, and the commanding [[archwizard]]s fled after personal issues begin turning into [[spell]]-battles.
