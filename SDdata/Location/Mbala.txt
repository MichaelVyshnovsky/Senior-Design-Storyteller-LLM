'''Mbala''' was a town located atop a sheer plateau northwest of the [[Aldani Basin]] in [[Chult]]. 

==Geography==
Unlike most towns in Chult, Mbala was located far inland and was more than 50 miles (80 km) from either the [[River Soshenstar|Soshenstar]] or [[River Tath|Tath]] rivers.

==Defences==
A narrow (roughly 5 feet wide) path wound around the plateau for three miles in total, including several switchbacks, effectively prohibiting an army from marching upon the high plateau. Climbing the plateau itself was a difficult prospect too, requiring both skill and the proper equipment.

==Government==
Mbala was once the seat of a small Chultan kingdom.

==History==
At an unknown point, a [[green hag]] posing as a witch doctor calling herself [[Nanny Pu'pu]] slaughtered and ate all of Mbala's citizens until she was the only sentient resident left.<ref>

After the population's demise, [[Myrkul]], the Lord of Bones, claimed Mbala as his territory and demanded an offering from any passing travelers.
