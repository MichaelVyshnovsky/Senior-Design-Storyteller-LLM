        "Geography": "Zelpir sat on the southwest shore of the [[Golden Water]] near [[Pyratar]]. Its location as the closest port to [[Heldapan]] made it the prime choice for those wishing to ship their wares north.",
        "Activites": "Known for its production of fine jewelry and mechanical devices, some believed Zelpir's products rivaled those of the [[Lantan]]nan [[Gond]]smen. Water clocks, mechanical toys, and [[field glass]]es were just a few of the wonders that could be purchased here.\n\nZelpir transported grain via ship or caravan north to [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Though it only possessed a population of 8,000 inhabitants, Zelpir was growing quickly. However, the merchants were cautious about who they allowed to start a business within their city. All new businesses needed to be licensed and approved by the city council."
