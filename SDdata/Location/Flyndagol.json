        "mainbody": "'''Flyndagol''' was an isolated city in [[Durpar]] in the [[Shining Lands]] in [[1367 DR]].",
        "Geography": "Located in the far northwest corner of Durpar, Flyndagol sat on the west bank of the [[River Xon]]. Its close proximity to [[Raurin]] and the [[A-Ling Shan]] mountains made it a dangerous place to live.\n\nTemperatures in and around Flyndagol were uncomfortably hot compared to the other cities of Durpar.",
        "Activites": "Trade between Flyndagol and the [[elf|elves]] of the [[Ajmer Forest]] was common. Flyndagol was also the first line of defense against any attack from [[Ulgarth]] or [[orc]]s from the [[Dustwall Mountains|Mountains of War]].\n\nBecause of the intense daytime heat, most businesses in Flyndagol opened after noon and stayed opened well into the night. Most of the streets and shops were lit via ''[[continual light]]'' spells to eliminate any added heat from conventional light sources.",
        "Inhabitants": "Flyndagol maintained a standing force of 1,000 soldiers. Because of the amicable trade relations, the elves of the Ajmer provided skilled archers for military support as well."
