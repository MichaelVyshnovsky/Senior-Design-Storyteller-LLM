The Western Emirate of Amin was a territory of the Shoon Imperium that preceded the foundation of the independent kingdom of Amn.
The Emirate encompassed the urbanized cities along the coast between the Forest of Tethir and the Cloud Peaks, including the major cities of Athkatla, Murann, and Crimmor.
Amin came about with the settlement of the coast by the Shoon Imperium and the construction of the cities there, becoming part of the greater Calishar Emirates. The three largest cities built were Athkatla in 100 DR, Crimmor in 163 DR, and Murann in 212 DR, with the smaller Trademeet in 223 DR.
Following the internal collapse of the Shoon Imperium in 450 DR, the Amin-born general Esmel Torlath took control of the Emirate and declared himself the first king of Amn in 460 DR. He took the city-states of Athkatla, Murann and Crimmor and formed them into his realm, then began a program of eastern expansion and settlement.
