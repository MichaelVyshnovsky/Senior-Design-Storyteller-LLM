        "Geography": "All of the islands within this group were low, rolling rock formations. Streams and natural springs fed their fertile vales. Many small settlements dotted the coast of Masud Jazayir.",
        "Inhabitants": "Many of the islands' inhabitants were descendants of outlaws, rebels, and other malcontents. They still followed the Law of the Loregiver, but abided by looser interpretations.",
        "Trade": "Inhabitants of Masud Jazayir produced almonds, [[sesame]] seeds, [[date]]s, sugar cane, [[grape]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[citron]]s, figs, and cotton. Livestock was also kept in the form of [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[cattle]]."
