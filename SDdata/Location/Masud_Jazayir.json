        "mainbody": "Masud Jazayir, or the Fortunate Isles, was a group of islands located along the northern tip of the Nada al-Hazan archipelago in the Crowded Sea. This group of islands represented the farthest outpost of Zakharans into the Crowded Sea.\nAll of the islands within this group were low, rolling rock formations. Streams and natural springs fed their fertile vales. Many small settlements dotted the coast of Masud Jazayir.\nMany of the islands inhabitants were descendants of outlaws, rebels, and other malcontents. They still followed the Law of the Loregiver, but abided by looser interpretations.\nInhabitants of Masud Jazayir produced almonds, sesame seeds, dates, sugar cane, grapes, pomegranates, citrons, figs, and cotton. Livestock was also kept in the form of goats, sheep, and cattle."
