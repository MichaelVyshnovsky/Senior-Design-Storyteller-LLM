        "Description": "The Pit of the Ghuls was a deep valley surrounded by ring of [[granite]] cliffs. Many of the cliffs had their own passages that tunneled deep into the ground, providing an easy way for adventurers to get hopelessly lost. A constant stench of decay permeated the cliffs and pit, carried by the constant winds ripping across the desert.\n\nSalt water could be found here in the form of the [[Lake of the Ghuls]], located in the northern section of the pit.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rumor said that giant statues carved of [[gold]], [[silver]], [[turquoise]], [[onyx]], [[emerald]], [[amber]], and [[ruby]] could be found somewhere within the pit, but dangerous creatures proved more than a challenge for treasure seekers. The arm of a turquoise statue was successfully recovered and came to rest in [[Ajayib]]."
