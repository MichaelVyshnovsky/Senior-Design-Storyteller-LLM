Alyssim was a tiny elven village located about fifty miles to the east of Essemore on the banks of the Elvenflow. 
The people of Alyssim frowned upon half-elves and punished any elves who procreated with other species. Females were looked down upon in Alyssim society. The villagers worshiped Rillifane Rallathil, and recognizing other deities was also frowned upon.
Alyssims most notable former inhabitant was Lyra Sunrose, a half-elf who was shunned in the village and later became friends with Elminster.
As of 1367 DR, the village no longer existed and its former site was overrun with stinkweeds, although the exact date and cause of its demise were not known.
