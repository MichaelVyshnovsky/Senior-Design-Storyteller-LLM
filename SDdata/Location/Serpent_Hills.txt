The Serpent Hills were a vast area of rocky hills, east of the High Moor in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn.
The peaks of the western Serpent Hills broaden out and eventually level out to become the High Moor.
Beneath the red-clay hills was a system called the Serpent Tunnels, partially consisting of tombs from around the time of Netherils fall. Even deeper beneath the hills, in a region of the Underdark, was the grimlock city of Reeshov.
* Dungeon of Swords, a well-protected crypt that was rumored to be associated with the noble House Thardresk of ancient Anauria.
* Sstckal, a yuan-ti settlement formed in the ruined tomb of a once-powerful diviner named Diderius.
As the name says, the hills were full of innumerable snakes. Many types of dragons lived in the hills, such as copper, red and silver dragons. Bands of yuan-ti were also known to live in the area. By 1372 DR, the highest population belonged to ophidians.
