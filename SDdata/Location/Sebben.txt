'''Sebben''' was a small town in the [[Shaar]].

==Description==
The location was pleasantly pastoral, yet kept regular contact with the outside world.

===Geographical Features===
The city was built around a pond filled by a spring.

==Trade==
The town was the hub for [[sheep]] and [[goat]] ranches around the area. A local business bred and traded horses.

==History==
The town was founded by [[Otrur Sebben]], who first put the road through the [[Rath Gap]] in the [[Rathgaunt Hills]], connecting it to [[Shaarmid]]. The city was razed in the {{yearlinkName|438}} by the forces of [[Amahl Shoon VII]] during the [[Seven Burnings]] campaign.

Up to {{yearlink|1490}}, a road linking Sebben with the road between [[Kormul]] and [[Rethmar]] through [[Reth Gap]] remained unpaved.
