        "mainbody": "A mystical site was a type of magical location found in the Utter East. Sacred shrines were erected on them where basal golems could be transformed into higher-level creatures.\nA mystical site was marked by a \"foundation\", a ground base whereon the shrine would be constructed. It was depicted as a pale-brown stone slab, with a central hexagonal area marked by an obelisk and four wings for the basal golems to stand on. There were only a handful of foundations to be found at specific locations in a given tract of land.\nWhen four basal golems stood upon the foundation, they could be together transformed (permanently) into one type of shrine.\nThe sacred shrines were dedicated to the gods Chauntea, Lathander, Mystra, Myrkul, or Tempus. In exchange for this reverence, other basal golems who visited the shrine could be transformed (via metapods) into a variety of creatures associated with each god.\nShrines were often either square, round, or round with four protruding entrances fitting the shape of the foundation, though their design varied greatly according to their god and land and culture they were built in. However, each bore the holy symbol of the god on them.\nthumb|250px|right|An Arbor Lodge outside Edenvale Castle (top left).\nthumb|250px|right|And another in the Hall of Wonder (top right).\nThe Arbor Lodge was described as a primal sanctum of the goddess of nature, Chauntea. As a mystical site, it conducted power from nature. It was used to transform basal golems into creatures of the wild, namely druids, rangers, griffins, and nymphs. It bore the rose of Chaunteas holy symbol inside a sun. In the kingdom of Doegan, it took the form of a round building, while in Edenvale it was a wooden house surmounted with antlers, and in the constructed Hall of Wonder it was a round stone building.\nThe Barracks was a martial hall in the service of the god of war, Tempus. As a mystical site, it drew its power from conflict. It was used to transform basal golems into hardened warriors, rangers, and paladins. It bore the flaming sword and shield symbol of Tempus, or sometimes three parallel swords in opposing directions. In Doegan, it took the form of a round training yard.\nThe Crypt was a grim tomb dedicated to the god of the dead, Myrkul. As a mystical site, it conducted power from the \"nether world\". It was used to transform basal golems into creatures of evil aspect, like zombies, ghouls, wraiths, and gargoyles. It bore the skull and arch unholy symbol of Myrkul. In Doegan, it took the form of a square stone crypt.\nThe Runestone was an arcane monument that honored the goddess of magic, Mystra. As a mystical site, it conducted arcane power. Producing beings of strong magical essence, it was used to transform basal golems into wizards, gnomes, stone golems, and wyrms. It bore the holy symbol of Mystra, the image of mist descending from a ring of eight stars. In Doegan, this was a weird eldritch structure.\nThe Temple was itself a temple to the god of renewal and virtue, Lathander. As a mystical site, it conducted virtuous power and turned basal golem acolytes into clerics, paladins, and furies. It bore an image of a sunrise atop the wavy disc holy symbol of Lathander. In Doegan, it was a round temple with four entrances.\nWhatever gods the sacred shrines were dedicated to, adherents of the Great Mage saw all the mystical sites as temples of battle. Their followers, the basal golems, erected them to honor the gods."
