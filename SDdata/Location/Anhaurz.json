        "mainbody": "Anhaurz was a city located in Lapendrar, a region of Thay, at one point, a molten ruin, and, once again, rebuilt as a fortress city in the 15 century DR.\nAnhaurz was built on the southern shores of the River Lapendrar, and had a strategically important bridge across it. The town was guarding a passage across the First Escarpment.\nThe autharch of the city was Ramas Ankhalab. After it was rebuilt after the Spellpague, So-Kehur was assigned the restoration and stewardship of the fortress by Szass Tam.\nIn 1385 DR, during the Spellplague, the city was hit by azure fire, melting the city and killing its every inhabitant. By the , Anhaurz was rebuilt as a fortress city by So-Kehur, who earned for war and designed the city with that aspiration in mind. Under his rulership, the city was prided for its impressive garrison capable of withstanding any attack."
