        "Geography": "The city was located within [[the Flats]] in the distant southwest of Netheril, and was the only permanent settlement there.",
        "Religion": "Kismet was a holy site for the Angardt, where important ceremonies of the tribes were conducted, such as marriages, newborn babies were blessed, and tribal leaders were established. In the days around [[Midsummer]], almost all the Angardt of the Flats moved to the city temporarily.",
        "Trade": "Kismet became a center of [[horse]]-raising and training, with the beasts sold onward to the warriors, explorers, and [[adventurer]]s of Netheril. The horse-trading of Kismet was so important that even the haughty [[arcanist]]s of Netheril gave them a measure of respect.",
        "History": "The city came to be when the Angardt people separated from the [[Rengarth]] and had to make the Flats their new home in {{yearlinkConvert|2612|NY}}. The [[barbarian]]s immediately came into conflict with the [[thieves]] of [[Thiefsward]], finding them despicably cowardly, and after a brief war they entered a period of peace with only a few skirmishes between them.\n\nThe city lasted as an Angardt stronghold until well after [[Karsus's Folly]], when the [[Anauroch]]'s advance caused it to be abandoned by {{yearlinkConvert|3650|NY}}."
