Fearing [[Xorvintroth#Technology|their creations]] would be used for ill, city leaders began to pursue a utopian existence free of war, only to expose their city to horrors from beyond reality. Following the [[Spellplague|cataclysmic events]] that rebound Abeir and its sister planet, Xorvintroth was relocated on Toril for over a hundred years of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].\n\nThe dragonborn city was named after [[xorvintaal]], the ongoing and ever-present contests of will and power between the [[dragon]]s and dragonborn of [[Abeir]].{{Cite adventurers league/Into Darkness|2}} Ironically it was the paranoia regarding this barbarous conflict that led to Xorvintroth's downfall.\n\n{{Quote|To deny the radiance of the stars is to walk forever in darkness.|An inscription written in [[Draconic language|draconic]], found within a shrine in Xorvintroth.}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}",

            "Culture": "Xorvintroth was considered something of an enlightened utopia. It was the city where the brightest Abeiran scholars could advance their understanding of the known world and the [[multiverse]] beyond.",
            "Technology": "Xorvintrothian [[artificer]]s developed many fantastic inventions that were nearly unconceivable by Torillian standards. They created devices to harness ''[[raw magic]]'',{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|2-6}} a source of infinite arcane power that could be extracted from the [[Far Realm]]. This power was unaffected by the constraints of [[the Weave]] The power taken from the Far Realm was channeled through conduits throughout the city and subsequently stored in ''[[Far Realm battery|self-contained devices]]''. These 'arcane storage batteries' were used to power the fantastic machinery and magnificent devices dreamt up by the Abeiran dragonborn [[artificer]]s.\n\nTheir technological advancements in artificery utilized both [[arcane magic]] and [[psionics]] to create many marvelous and hazardous devices.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|11-18}} Among their greatest creations were a ''[[teleportation ray]]'',{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|7-10}} a ''[[Gauntlet of One|gauntlet that channeled the energies of the natural world]]'', ''[[Memory Pillars|stone pillars that could record and reproduce images of the past]]'', ''[[clockwork dragon|clockwork beasts]]'' and ''[[metallic peacekeeper|metallic guardians]]'' that echoed the powers of the noble [[metallic dragon]]s, and [[Far Realm battery|crystalline]] containers that were capable of harnessing various forms of energy, such as pure lightning and fire,{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|37}}\n\nThe most wise and learned of Xorvintroth's inventors utilized psionic abilities to shift the consciousnesses to the [[Astral Plane]]. Unshackled by the constrains of time and mortality, they could conceive of how to best improve the life of Xorvintroth's citizens. It was from within the Astral Plane that they gained the inspiration on ''how'' to harness harness the powers they had extracted from the remote Far Realm.",

This energy caused mild visual and auditory hallucinations to some that traveled within.{{Cite adventurers league/Burying the Past|5-7}} Anyone walking throughout its streets may have encountered phantasmal darkness that passed over them, heard faint and indiscernible clicking sounds, or witnessed the twinkling of malicious stars across the ceiling. In the most severe cases, this alien energy could inspire delusions and paranoia in their minds. \n\nThe cumulative weight of these effects could be wholly exhaustive for anyone not resilient or immune to them.{{Cite adventurers league/Into Darkness|6-9}}",

        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "A massive crevasse formed near the ruins of Xorvintroth, within which formed a 'spectral echo' of the engulfed city. While a thin layer of ice formed above the chasm, it could be broken through with enough pressure or weight.\n\nXorvintroth was accessible by means of long ice cave that opened out the side of a mountain,{{Cite adventurers league/Volatile Thoughts|13-16}} or by the series subterranean tunnels dug out by a group of [[neogi|aberrant arachnoids]] from within [[Realmspace]].{{Cite adventurers league/The City That Should Not Be|16-19}}"
        },
        "Government": "For the centuries Xorvintroth remained on Abeir, the city was governed by sect of elder dragonborn [[artificer]]s known as the [[Inquest]].{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|2-3}} The Inquest itself was led in turn by the city's four wisest elders. These elders attained a form of immortality when―after their bodies decayed―their [[brain in a jar|living brains]] were enshrined at a sanctum near the city's [[Xorvintroth#Notable Locations|Chamber of Stars]], and 'spectral echoes' of consciousnesses were free to float infinite within the Astral Plane.",
        "Defenses": "The city of Xorvintroth was protected by a series of [[ward]]s that prevented ''[[teleport]]ation'' within or out of its borders.\n\nDragonborn artificers also built into the city a safeguard that would trigger in case the city ever faced true catastrophe. When triggered by a disaster of significant magnitude, Xorvintroth was encased in a massive dome of viridian, glass-like stone.{{Cite adventurers league/The City That Should Not Be|11-15}} This barrier had to subsequently be punctured before the city could once again be accessible from the outside.",

As the Great Mothers and Fathers wile away the eons playing their [[Xorvintaal|Great Game]], our city proves to be the most valuable playing piece. Ne'er shall it be used. Ne'er shall it be lost.|An inscription set at the base of a statue in the [[Xorvintroth#Notable Locations|Chamber of Stars]].}}\n\nXorvintroth was constructed millennium before the [[Era of Upheaval]] on Toril. This amazing feat required the labor of hundreds of dragonborn masons and laborers. The city rapidly became a destination for scholarly pursuits and arcane research, and enormous, grand [[telescope]]s were constructed upon its highest towers.\n\nThe Inquest's elders began to fear that their grand inventions would be used by [[Abeir]]an dragons for their eternal contest of battle known as ''xorvintaal''. While in the Astral Plane, the elders contacted by a [[Emissary of the Nine Eyes|mysterious entity]], and granted vision of a new green world on which they could settle. Inquest then began construction of a vast, '[[Vast Gate|extraplanar bridge]]' that would allow their people to flee the never-ending wars of Abeir and find a new home planet in the stars beyond.\n\nThrough their research, the Inquest broke through the barriers of reality itself and opened ''[[portal]]s'' into the alien reality of the Far Realm. Once within, they were granted them access to a source of infinite arcane power:{{Cite adventurers league/To Walk the Cold Dark|2}} ''raw magic''.\n\nThe Inquest went too far however and the dark forces of the Far Realm poured through the ''portals''. The first being appeared innocuous enough however. He was [[Father Llymic|elderly old man]] that offered the dragonborn scholars additional information about the world they sought. His contributions to the Xorvintrothian led to the completion of the 'extraplanar bridge' and the old man from beyond was celebrated throughout the city. A statue of him was built amidst the Xorvintroth's grand towers and places of learning. The moment the gate to the new world was activated however, Xorvintroth was doomed. Tentacled monstrosities, [[star spawn|figures composed of worm]]s, and other horrors poured through the portal and rapidly overran the city. Many of Xorvintroth's citizens attempted to flee the catastrophe, but their efforts were purposefully halted by the Inquest.",
            "Torillian History": "Xorvintroth lay dormant on Abeir until the [[Spellplague]] rejoined the planet with its sister-world Toril in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. The city was expelled from Abeir and transposed to Toril the depths beneath the Spine of the World mountains in coldest reaches of [[the North]]. The ''planar anomaly'' previously opened by the Inquest was transported to the rock beneath the mountains as well.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of [[neogi]] aboard a ''[[Neogi deathspider|deathspider]]'' touched down in the mountains near where Xorvintroth was buried,{{Cite adventurers league/The Fallen Star|2}} and abducted a group of [[goliath]] hunters as slaves. The neogi and their captured goliaths wandered into an area in Xorvintroth and were horrifically dismembered, and their remains strewn across the city's floor."
