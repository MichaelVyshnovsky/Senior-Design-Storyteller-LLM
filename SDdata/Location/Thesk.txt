The nation of '''Thesk''' was an oligarchy of around 850,000 people, inhabited by [[human]]s, [[gnome]]s, and [[orc]]s. The majority of its inhabitants were either merchants or farmers. The [[Golden Way]], the main trade route to [[Kara-Tur]], ran through Thesk, exposing it to a wide variety of cultures and making its people more tolerant than most Faerûnians.

==History==
===Early History===
In eons past, the lands of Thesk were once part of the empire of [[Narfell]], but little survived the Great Conflagration that destroyed that empire in the {{YearlinkName|-150}}.

Thesk remained largely empty until [[Windyn Balindre]] pioneered the [[Golden Way]] trade route to [[Kara-Tur]] in the {{YearlinkName|917}}, and immigrants from [[Impiltur]] began to settle the land. Balindre and these settlers founded the city of [[Telflamm]] in {{YearlinkName|926}}. The country of Thesk was founded by the Alliance of the Cities of the Golden Way in the {{YearlinkName|937}}.

Princess Delile Balindre declared [[Telflamm]] (and thus all of Thesk) independent from [[Impiltur]] in the {{YearlinkName|1177}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|1086}}, [[Thay]] invaded and captured the two southernmost cities of Thesk, [[Nethjet]] and [[Nethentir]]. Twenty-five years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1110}}, Thay again invaded, marching on the city of [[Phent]], but this time the combined forces of Impiltur and Thesk defeated the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. Relations between the two nations eventually cooled and, in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, one of the first [[Thayan enclave]]s was established in [[Telflamm]].

===Modern History===
In [[1360 DR]], the [[Tuigan]] Horde, led by Horselord [[Yamun Khahan]] invaded [[Faerûn]] from the [[Hordelands]] in the east. To meet the threat, the people of the western heartlands, lead by King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]] raised a great alliance made of troops from [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], [[Hillsfar]], [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Dwarves]] from the [[Earthfast Mountains]], and others. [[Sembia]] provided funds to hire mercenaries, and [[Zhentil Keep]] contributed 1000 [[Orcs]]. The armies of the west totaled 28,000 against 100,000 [[Tuigan]]s. Despite the odds, the alliance defeated the invading horde on the [[Golden Way]] near [[Phsant]]. The eastern half of Thesk was in ruins, but with the [[Tuigan]] threat neutralized, trade with [[Kara-Tur]] could resume, and with it, the flow of money into the land. The [[Orcs]] decided to settle in the country, becoming "civilized", and the people of Thesk grew to accept them.

Seeing opportunity in a weakened Thesk, the [[Sharkjaw]] pirates descend on [[Telflamm]] in [[1364 DR]] and make it their home port until the [[Shadowmasters]] managed to drive them out, leaving them unchallenged to expand their influence in the still recovering city.

In the early fifteenth century, [[Tai Shing]], a [[Shou]] hero, successfully drove the criminal gangs out of [[Phsant]] to become the First Council Lord of Phsant and then to be elected the first [[Wikipedia:Suzerain|Suzerain]] of Thesk. His death in [[1453 DR]] has left Thesk a patchwork of nobles, merchants, and gangs.

==Navy and seafaring==
Theskian vessels were named after the goods they carry, like "Spicesail" or "Timberhold".

==Politics==
Thesk was very wealthy and the wealthiest inhabitant of each settlement became the mayor. A council of mayors existed to govern the nation. Most outsiders thought of the city of [[Telflamm]] as the capital of Thesk, but in reality, the council that governed Thesk did not recognize any city as the capital.

==Geography==
Thesk was located between the Plateau of [[Thay]] and the [[Forest of Lethyr]] and was largely uninhabited.

===Ashanath===
{{Main|Ashanath}}
Ashanath was an uninhabited area of Thesk. Despite its fertile lands, its lack of settlement was attributable to the seasonal tornadoes from which it suffers.

===Settlements===
[[Telflamm]] was a large independent city-state and the largest settlement in Thesk. Its approximately 23,500 inhabitants apparently were under the rule of a "merchant prince", though behind the scenes it was the [[Shadowmasters]], a thieves guild, who ran the city.

Other settlements of note include [[Phsant]], the site where the [[Tuigan Horde]] was defeated and subsequently many members of the [[orc]] army settled, [[Milvarune]], [[Phent]], [[Tammar]], and [[Nyth]].

===Mountains===
The [[Dragonjaw Mountains]] formed a natural border between Thesk in the north and [[Aglarond]] in the south. The [[Thesk Mountains]] occupied an area in central Thesk.{{Cite web/FRmap}}
