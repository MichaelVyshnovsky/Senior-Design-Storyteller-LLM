Access to Thaymount, along with the corresponding tharch, was restricted to the Red Wizards who regularly traveled to and from the tharch, building new fortifications and attending clandestine meetings.\nthumb|A map of Thaymount at the center of 425x425px\nSome of the volcanoes of Thaymount were still active, as of the late 14 century DR, Those peaks that were not smoldering, were shaped like fangs, darting up into ridges and walls of basalt.\nThe rivers Umber, Lapendrar, and Eltar all had their source in the soot-covered glaciers in atop the Thaymount. The mountains also housed Thayvian gold mines located south of the Citadel, volcanic forges, magical workshops, barracks of Thays monstrous armies, and the private fortresses of many Red Wizards. Under the Citadel, deep underneath Thaymount, laid the Paths of the Doomed – a dangerous labyrinthine cave system and defense chambers for the Citadels inner sanctums.\nThe Thaymount hid tunnels that connected it to the Underdark.\nAreas high in the mountains, close to the volcanos, were inhabited by fire elementals and wild wyverns.\nThe Thaymount, the tharch, and the Thayvian gold mines were overseen by tharchion Willeth Lionson in 1362 DR, who was murdered and was briefly impersonated by Asp, a naga ally of Zulkir Maligor.The next tharchion to take the rulership was Spiros Dehkahks who came to opposed Tam and disappeared circa 1367 DR, only to be replaced by Pyras Autorian, a young and easily manipulated Red Wizard.\nApart from gold, the tunnels underneath the Thaymount had occasional but rich deposits of crimson gold and kings tears, that were mostly untouched during Szass Tams time as the de facto master of Thaymount. Much of the exported enchanted items from out of Thay were created in the laboratories and factories of the Thaymount.\nThe Thaymount was well defended by Thays military reserves stationed in the mountains, including countless gnolls, darkenbeasts, Notably, Thaymounts Grummshs Legion comprised of orcs and orogs was considered to be the best military unit in all of Thay in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nMagical defenses of the Thaymount included a magical dampening field, erected in the mid 14 century DR. It stopped divinations of all.\nIn the , the War of Claws came to an end with the demon lord Eltabs defeat and imprisonment within a demoncyst deep underneath the Thaymount mountains.\nThe imprisoned demon lord was released in the  by the Zulkir of Necromancy Szass Tam in attempts to steal the great fiends fearsome powers using The Devouring Chambers under the Citadel. The attempt was a failure, thwarted was a group of heroes sent there by the Simbul. Instead of raging across the Prime Material plane, Eltab hid within the demoncyst.\nOn Kythorn 3 of the , an opponent of Tams – Naglatha the Black Flame, the chief of Thays foreign activities, guided by prophetic dreams, blackmailed thief Thazienne Uskevren into retrieving magic scrolls from the Citadels inner chambers. Unbeknownst to Naglatha, the dreams were subtle magical manipulations of Eltab, whom she inadvertently released. Now freed, Eltab possessed the body of Tharchion of Thaymount, Pyras Autorian and unleashed monstrous creatures of the demoncyst on the tharch. Eltab caused Thaymonts volcanoes to erupt, sowing chaos and destruction. The demons old enemy Szass Tam and Thazi assembled Tams armies of juju zombies, darkenbeasts, and blooded ones and confronted the demon lord and his army of demoncyst-changed monsters. Thazienne barely survived her one-on-one battle with Eltab, winning after suffering deadly injuries and killing the demons host with her crimson gold dagger. Despite Pyras Autorians death by Thaziennes dagger, the Tharchion was brought back as Tams puppet.\nBy the , Thaymount was a heavily guarded territory, off-limits to anyone but the tharchions and zulkirs. Any caught trespassers were executed on sight.\nIn the , Szass Tam established the Thaymount as his seat of power capital of Thay.\nWhen the Spellplague began ravaging Toril from the  to the , the Plateau of Thay was pushed thousands of feet up from underground, causing large-scale eruption of the Thaymount, which led to much destruction and melting glaciers.\n*Academy of Shapers and Binders, a Thayan mage school, was located on the Thaymount, near one of the active volcanos.\n*Doomvault, a massive dungeon containing laboratories used by Szass Tam to fuel his ascension to godhood in the 15 century DR.\n*Phantasmal Fortress, the labyrinthine keep of deceptions and illusions, the fortress of Hlarkus Baltreyo, the Mad Zulkir of Illusion in the late 15 century DR.\nThe tharch was home to zulkirs and the most powerful Red Wizards access to the area was strictly controlled. Along with Zulkirs, the Thaymount was home to their armies of gnolls, many other creatures, and slaves."
