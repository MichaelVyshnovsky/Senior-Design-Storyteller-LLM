}}'''Szith Morcane''' was an outpost of the [[drow]] city of [[Maerimydra]].

==Geography==
Built into the side of a yawning chasm in the [[Upperdark]] of the [[Deep Wastes]], Szith Morcane was connected not by streets and caverns but by a vast spider's web that covers the wall. Spun by an enormous [[spider]] which laired in the chasm, the drow were careful to only travel on the 'safe' non-sticky strands as they are all too aware that those who get caught in the webbing were prey for the beast.

==History==
Established beneath the [[Dordrien]] Crypts in [[804 DR]], Szith Morcane served as a supply station for the dark elves living in [[Shadowdale]], it also functioned as a staging area for raids into [[Daggerdale]]. When the drow were driven out of Shadowdale in [[906 DR]] by [[Ashaba]], the inhabitants of Szith Morcane lost interest in the surface world and sealed themselves away from it.

In [[1372 DR]], during the [[Silence of Lolth]], the last of the [[Lolth]] worshipers from destroyed Maerimydra fled to Szith Morcane but were tracked down and killed by cultists of [[Kiaransalee]]. Led by [[Dorina T'sarran|Dorina]] and [[Zedarr T'sarran]], these cultists then reoccupied the outpost with their troops and reopened the connections to the surface. Under the yoke of their new leaders the drow of Szith Morcane began raids anew on Daggerdale, causing [[Randal Morn]] to hire a party of adventurers to stop these raids.

After the defeat of the cult of [[Kiaransalee]], [[Solom Ned'razak]] took over control of the outpost and permanently seale the Dordrien crypts entrance with a magical barrier.

Over the subsequent years, Szith Morcane's population gradually swelled with drow who had fled Maerimydra. However this ended in [[1485 DR]] when [[fire giant]]s, under the command of [[Hledh Hellspawn]], marched on the former outpost and took control of it. This resulted in many of the caverns being collapsed and Solom Ned'razak was held captive. Hledh returned to Maerimydra with fresh slaves for the [[Coliseum (Maerimydra)|Coliseum]] and left Captain [[Fydor]] in charge of the settlement.

==Government==
Szith Morcane was ruled primarily by [[House Morcane]]'s [[matron mother]]. Prior to the Silence of Lolth, it was also home to six influential merchant houses.

==Trade==
Although in Szith Morcane's past it was a minor hub of trade in the area, even attracting drow from as far away as [[Menzoberranzan]], after the retreat of Maerimydra's influence on the surface in [[906 DR]] it fell into decline. By [[1372 DR]], the settlement had become a quiet military outpost, attracting only a few traders from nearby in the [[Underdark]].

==Defences==
Despite the presence of a decent-sized garrison and its sizable [[wizard]] school, Szith Morcanes unique construction was perhaps its most significant defense. Located on the side of a chasm, the only navigable way around the outpost was along a network of webbing. Any who stray from the few "safe" and non-sticky strands of web fall prey to a [[fiendish]] monstrous spider which allowed a dedicated web team to stick to the "safe strands" and patrol the cavern quite effectively. In addition, both the [[Inverted Tower]] and [[House Morcane]] were protected by powerful magical wards.

==Notable locations==
Along with slave caverns, a bazaar area, and well-defended barracks, Szith Morcane boasted other locations of interest.
;[[Inverted Tower]]
: A tower so named for its odd construction of rooms branching off from a single central spire and the small, insular community of wizards who occupied it.
;[[Fane of Lolth]]
: Primary temple to the Spider Queen before its inhabitants were killed by the worshipers of [[Kiaransalee]], which was located in House Morcane. Former High Priestess, [[Alisannara Morcane]], used to lead her priestesses in worship here. Following Hledh Hellspawn's conquest of the outpost, it was converted into a shrine to the patron god of fire giants, [[Surtur]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|23}}
