        "mainbody": "'''Alphar''', also known as '''Alphar Port''', was the largest settlement on [[Alphar Isle]] in the [[Pirate Isles]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]",
        "Geography": "Alphar was located on the western coast near the middle of the island.",
        "Description": "It had the largest harbor on Alphar Isle, being able to hold 30 ships, and was a flourishing town almost 5,000 people ''circa'' [[1359 DR]].",
        "Government": "Unlike the other settlements scattered though the Pirate Isles, Alphar had its own government separate from the influence of any pirate captains. This government was headed by [[Selshin Toshant]] in the 1350s DR. Although a retired pirate himself, he worked to \"clean up\" the harbor, tried to ban wanted pirates, and attempted to initiate legal trade with the northern nations of [[Sembia]], [[Procampur]], and [[Impiltur]]. However, they were not enamored of establishing such bonds with a port that had close ties to pirates and, at home, the folk of Alphar held tight to their pirate traditions and opposed Selshin's efforts. There was a risk that if he pushed too far, he would be removed from power before long.",
        "Law & Order": "Though it was frequented by pirates, Only privateers were barred.",
        "Defenses": "Alphar maintained a standing militia to defend the town. Its harbor had several breakrocks and a harbor chain was deployed during years past, but the chain had fallen into a state of disrepair and was lost as of 1359 DR. Otherwise, it did not have much in the way of defenses, leaving it vulnerable to direct attack.\n\nThe residents of Alphar took a strong stand against minor incursions such as raids, with the raiders' ships wrecked on the breakrocks, but outright attacks from sovereign nations were not met head on. Instead, the residents typically abandoned the town to its fate and disappeared into the wilderness in order to return and rebuild later.",
        "History": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Jezgar Skentzin]], a [[lycanthropic]] [[seawolf]] pirate; he and his crew sometimes visited during the day, but left before nightfall."
