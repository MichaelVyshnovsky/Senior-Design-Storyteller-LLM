'''Hollinth''', the '''Eighth City of the Sword''', was one of the cities in the imperial heartlands of [[Jhaamdath]].

==Geography==
The city of Hollinth was far west of the capital [[Naarkolyth]], closest to its twin of [[Tuoxent]] near the [[Deepwing Mountains]].

==History==
Hollinth was founded in the {{Yearlink|-5250}}, as the eighth of the realm's core cities. It was paired with the construction of its twin city Tuoxent that same year.

The year {{Yearlink|-276}} saw Jhamdaath embark on a campaign of conquest and expansion, logging the [[Chondalwood]] and warring on the [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]]. The elves responded in the {{YearlinkName|-255}}, by casting a great [[High Magic]] ritual that caused a huge wave from the [[Inner Sea]] to crash all the way from the [[Bay of Jhaamdath]] up to the Deepwing Mountains. The cities were drowned in the new [[Vilhon Reach]], and Hollinth sank and was lost, with [[psionic]] energy from its lost relics affecting the local environment.

The sunken cities of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. The situation was then returned to its previous state in [[1486 DR]] by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]] that covered them in seawater once more.
