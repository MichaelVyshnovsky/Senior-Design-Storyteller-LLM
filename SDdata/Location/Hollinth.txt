Hollinth, the Eighth City of the Sword, was one of the cities in the imperial heartlands of Jhaamdath.
The city of Hollinth was far west of the capital Naarkolyth, closest to its twin of Tuoxent near the Deepwing Mountains.
Hollinth was founded in the , as the eighth of the realms core cities. It was paired with the construction of its twin city Tuoxent that same year.
The year  saw Jhamdaath embark on a campaign of conquest and expansion, logging the Chondalwood and warring on the elves of Nikerymath. The elves responded in the , by casting a great High Magic ritual that caused a huge wave from the Inner Sea to crash all the way from the Bay of Jhaamdath up to the Deepwing Mountains. The cities were drowned in the new Vilhon Reach, and Hollinth sank and was lost, with psionic energy from its lost relics affecting the local environment.
The sunken cities of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR, becoming the Vilhon Wilds. The situation was then returned to its previous state in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering that covered them in seawater once more.
