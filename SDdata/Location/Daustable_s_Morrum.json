        "mainbody": "Daustables Morrum was a small valley just off the Traders Way in southeast Faer√ªn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. It was bordered on its eastern edge by three large standing stones and was the third such landmark north of Delzimmer on the Traders Way after Harboots Tooth and the Knife.\nThe Morrum was a favored camping ground for travelers because there was a small spring that flowed out of the center of the valley and crossed the Way in a shallow stream over muddy bedrock that was easily fordable at a depth barely above a horses hoof. The rocks on the valley floor were mostly covered with lichens and wiry grasses that were edible if boiled. The lichen had a citrus taste reminiscent of the orauth of Var the Golden and the grass had a flavor similar to bittermur grass, a reddish plant found in the highlands of Halruaa.These plants had flavors, respectively, like the lemons and endive of Earth.\nThe three standing stones were stoutly round and tall, like giant ale tankards. They stood at the east end of the hollow in an arc and could be climbed with ease. They were known collectively as the Authraukh, and each monolith also had a name. The smallest one was to the south and named Ilthkrist the middle-sized one was to the north and named Raulvo and the central one was the largest, named Nimburr. Raulvo had two small, single-room caves that could be used as hiding places or tight shelters if one didnt mind the bone-strewn floors. One was accessible from the east face of Raulvo and the other chamber was entered from the top. All three monuments were home to many birds, depending on the season.\nThe legend of the Authraukh stated that Nimburr, Raulvo, and Ilthkrist were the names of three humans that were turned to stone by a stone giant mage back at the dawn of human civilization. More recently, it was said that in the 11th century (Dalereckoning) trade with the races of the Underdark took place via a magically concealed door in Nimburr that led to many underground passages. There were also common and persistent rumors that the three standing stones held various hidden treasures, but after centuries of being scoured by treasure hunters, it was very unlikely the Authraukh contained anything of value."
