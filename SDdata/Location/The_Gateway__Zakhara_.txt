The '''Gateway''' was the name given to the delta formed by the [[Nogaro River]] in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region of [[east Zakhara]].

==Geography==
Sediment collected from the Ruined Kingdoms as the mighty Nogaro River wound for hundreds of miles through the grasslands and jungles was deposited where the river emptied into the [[Crowded Sea]] and [[Foreigners' Sea]] approximately {{SI|60|mi|k}} south of [[Dihliz]]. The sediment combined with sand from the sea to create a large sand bank measuring {{SI|15|mi|k}} wide by {{SI|60|mi|k}} long.
