'''Findar''' was a [[human]] settlement in [[The Fang]], containing the descendants of refugees from the conflict between the humans and the [[half-elf|half-elves]] of the [[Yuirwood]]. It was situated on the coast on the west side of The Fang, beneath the cliffs, and the sandy ground made it difficult to grow crops. Findar's occupants made their living from the sea instead. They were hostile towards any non-humans.
