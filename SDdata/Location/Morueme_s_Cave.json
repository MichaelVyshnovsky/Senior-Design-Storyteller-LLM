        "Geography": "The cave was located on the edge of the [[Anauroch|Anauroch Desert]] on the mountain known as [[Dragondoom]].",
        "Description": "Nearly five [[dragon]]s occupied the caves. Each dragon protected his own treasure sided by their faithful [[hobgoblin]] servants. The Caves had many [[trap]]s, carefully placed to deal with [[human]]s. Most were rockfalls, in which rocks were linked together with [[chain]]s. Moreover, the caves had some sharp bends where the Moruemes took advantage of cover.",
        "History": "The caves have been the home for the clan for at least a thousand years. For many years, the Moruemes were ruled by [[Kizilpazar]], the ancient blue patriarch of the clan. In [[1371 DR]], his ambitious sons, [[Nahaunglaroth]] and [[Roraurim]], betrayed and destroyed him."
