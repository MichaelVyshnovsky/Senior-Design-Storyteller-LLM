The Dokuba Swamp was a dangerous mire, formed at the northernmost and of the little-explored Hebika River atop the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur.
From atop of the Fire Mountain volcano, River Hebika, or the Serpent River, ran down into the Living Jungle. The rived moved to the very northern edge of the Plateau, where it formed the Dokuba Swamp. From the bog, the waters of Hebika plummeted down from the Plateau to the Malatra region.
By the late 14 century DR, Dokuba Swamp was vastly avoided by the humanoids of the Malatran Plateau. Despite historic hostilities, the swamps lizards have not been part of a conflict with the tribes for several decades. However, old folk of the Nubari and shu told stories of savage lizardfolk raids on the villages, oh so common in their youth.
In the Year of New Peoples on the Malatran calendar in the late 14 century DR, a group of heroes from the Tribe of the Wise Ones was sent to the Dokuba Swamp to investigate the tribal chieftains prophetic dreams. The adventurers met with evil yuan-ti and traded with a sentient elder giant cobra, and eventually came to blows with pteramen, who made a home in the swamp. The cause of the disturbance was Somari – an exiled witch doctor of the Wise Ones.
A year after the Year of Tigers Return on the Malatran calendar in the late 14 century DR, a trio of dimwitted adventuring youths was sent to the Dokuba Swamp. The revered witch doctor Bengoukee sent Budd the korobokuru, Crash the saru, and Rowr the tiger katanga to investigate recent disturbances of the swamp. The trio thought the strife was caused by angered spirits however, it was a rogue yuan-ti who was subsequently defeated.
The Dokuba Swamp was infamous for its dangers and mysteries. It was home to ferocious lizardfolk what warred with the Nubari, korobokuru, and shu tribes of Malatra for generations.
Despite the reputation, not all lizardfolk of the Dokuba Swamp despised other races of the Living Jungle. Saurdurak was one of such individuals – a proud warrior from the Dokuba Swamp who hunted alongside representatives of various species and tribes of Malatra circa the Year of Tigers Return on the Malatran calendar.
Another sentient species found in the swamp was a tribe of pteramen in whose village a vile shaman Somari once plotted the demise of his old tribe of the Wise Ones.
Some seventy years before the Year of Tigers Return, the cannibal Nubari tribe of Kukalatu was going through Reformation. Those of the tribe who refused to abandon evil cannibalistic ways departed for the Dokuba Swamp. Thew were known as Kukaputuri Nubu. In the 14 century DR, the cannibals were ruled by Alisuba Bika, the name translated as "Dark Heart, Big Teeth," who allied Kukaputuri Nubu with the lizard fork.
