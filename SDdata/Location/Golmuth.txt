'''Golmuth''', the '''Fifth City of the Sword''', was one of the core cities in ancient [[Jhaamdath]].

==Geography==
Golmuth was a few days west of the First City, [[Naarkolyth]], just north of [[Gharrent]] and south of the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. After its destruction, it lay in the [[Selmal Basin]] beneath the waters of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
Golmuth was founded in {{Yearlink|-5425}} as the fifth of Jhaamdath's cities, preceded the same year by nearby Gharrent.

In the {{YearlinkName|-276}}, Jhaamdath began aggressively deforesting the [[Chondalwood]] and slaying the [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]]. The elven response in the {{YearlinkName|-255}} was a [[High Magic]] ritual that caused a great wave from the [[Inner Sea]] to wash over the Cities of the Sword and destroy the aggressors. Golmuth remained a sunken ruin hidden beneath the water, with its many lost [[psionic]] artifacts slowly affecting the nearby environment.

The sunken ruins of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by the lower sea levels that followed the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. They were then returned to obscurity by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]] in [[1486 DR]].
