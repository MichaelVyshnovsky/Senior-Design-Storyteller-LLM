The '''sewers of Waterdeep''' were a sanitation system of tunnels beneath the city that connected to most locations throughout [[Waterdeep]], including its dungeons.<ref name ="WatN-p26">

{{Quote|It’s a trip neither pretty nor pleasant, but delve the sewers if you truly want to learn what goes on in Waterdeep.|''[[Down the Drain: A Life in the Guild of Cellarers and Plumbers]]'', [[1356 DR]]}}

==Structure==
The depth of these sewers varied across Waterdeep, One reason for this was [[Mount Waterdeep]] and the plateau the northern portion of the city was built upon. Another was that the varied sizes and areas in which the sewer network was constructed at were both deliberate design decisions, made in order to optimally account for the ocean tides.

The tunnels of this sewer system did not match up with the routes of the city's streets above them by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. This was partially due to the ever changing layout of Waterdeep, but also because the sewer's layout was dictated in part by where Mount Waterdeep's springs rose and flowed down to the sea.

The [[Waterdeep/Field Ward|Field Ward]],<ref> the harbor islands, and the heart of Mount Waterdeep were the only areas in the city that the sewers did not run beneath.
===Functionality===
Refuse, as well as air, were brought down into the sewers by numerous feeder pipes scattered throughout the city. These pipes measured less than {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in diameter.{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|9}}

The sewer network operated on a system of tidal flushing,{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-01-01 - Waterdhavians and Chamberpots}} and were flushed out by those same tides.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-10-05 - Sewers of Waterdeep}} The sewer also received water from its upper levels by means of street runoff of rain and the frequent coastal fog, These places were purposely difficult to access, as the sewer network's designers sought to hamper the movements of less desirable visitors from the sea and to prevent the sewers from being used by criminals as an underground highway.<ref name ="WatN-p12">

Due to the great size of Waterdeep, there were concerns that the tidal flushing system could lead to the city's harbor becoming a cesspool. To ensure this didn't occur, [[Ahghairon]] and other [[mage]]s bound [[spell]]s into the city's wards and bound some [[elemental]]s. In conjunction with the deliberate design decisions made for the sewer's size and layout, these assisted the flows of water in carrying away sewage.

Some of the more powerful spells that Ahghairon bound into the sewers involved ''[[mass teleport]]ing'' waste straight to the [[Rat Hills]]. These spells continued to be renewed over the years by members of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-24 - Sewers of Waterdeep II}}

Some areas of the sewers featured doors that would close upon water entering from certain passages, which ensured that flooding did not occur. Other areas had pressure plates that would close doors once water stopped flowing over them, thus preventing backwash.{{Cite document/Eye of the Beholder/Clue Book|28}}

===Interior===
[[File:Traversing Waterdeep's Sewers.png|thumb|150px|''With no lighting available in the sewers, [[Tertius Wands]] and [[Onyx the Invincible]] have to resort to holding a [[lantern]] as they follow their [[arrow of direction]].'']]
====Construction====
The ceilings, floors, and walls all throughout the sewer system were made of masonry, There was little to no lighting within the sewers and a terrible stench pervaded the entire network.

Gratings in the sewers were all made of [[iron]] and were quite thick. Some were permanently set into the stone walls, while others could swing open on pivots. By the 14{{th}} century DR, many of these grates were suffering from rust.<ref name ="WatN-p27" />

One of the two oldest parts of the sewers was a large semicircular channel, which ran around the inland side of the spur of Mount Waterdeep that jutted out into the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]]. Waste from the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] and [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] drained through this channel. The other oldest structure was two trunk sewers, which drained waste from the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] and [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]]. Both structures emptied out into Deepwater Harbor.

====Passages====
The passages of this sewer network had no names, thus directions tended to be given in terms of entry points and paces. Those who worked in the sewers were known to navigate passages by laying down boards as temporary bridges or by vaulting across ledges with {{SI|16|ft|long=yes}} catchpoles. The latter of which were carried in order to reach below the water and clear debris from gratings.<ref name ="WatN-p27" />

[[File:WaterdeepSewerWalkways.png|thumb|273px|''Tertius and Onyx have a moment of rest on a passage ledge, having defeated a [[giant crocodile]].'']]
Passages were denoted as being either one of two types based on their size, primary and secondary.<ref name ="WatN-p27"> '''Primary passages''' were easily navigable.<ref name ="WatN-p12" /> They measured {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} across and had parallel, {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} wide, walkway ledges that lacked rails.<ref name ="WatN-p27" /> '''Secondary passages''' were smaller, requiring [[human]]-sized creatures to crawl or swim their way through.<ref name ="WatN-p12" /> They measured {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} and had a single {{SI|3|ft}} wide ledge on one of their sides, usually the more easterly or southerly side.<ref name ="WatN-p27" />

Primary passages were far more common in the northern parts of the city's sewers, while secondary passages were prevalent in the areas beneath the Dock Ward.

Besides these two types there were many older, smaller passages that had over time been put out of service and walled up by the 14{{th}} century DR.<ref name ="WatN-p26" />

====Portals====
Some areas of the sewers featured stone portals, a network built by an old [[dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom to quickly move about. These required special [[item enchantment|enchanted]] stone items to activate, which took a variety of forms. These included [[dagger]]s, [[gemstone]]s, [[holy symbol]]s, medallions, necklaces, [[orb]]s, [[ring]]s, and scepters.{{Cite document/Eye of the Beholder/Clue Book|69}}

Some areas featured ''[[teleport]]ation'' pads that were constructed by the sewer network's designers. These would ''teleport'' people to the surface, acting as an emergency exit for sewer workers in the case of flooding or other hazards. When broken, they would only teleport people elsewhere within the sewers.{{Cite document/Eye of the Beholder/Clue Book|29}}
====Interior Connections====
The sewer network notably featured connections to the dungeon complex under [[Castle Waterdeep]],<ref name ="WatN-p26" /> Many such links were kept operable and secret by the many guilds and shady organizations that operated in the city.

Connections with Undermountain in particular featured heavily in the city's tavern lore. 

;[[Dungeon Level]]: This first level of Undermountain had a tight winding crawl space, the Grim Passage, that ended at a secret door high above the headless relic known as Grim Statue. This was entered by means of a hidden door in the sewer passage beneath Slide Alley. This sewer passage paralleled the docks north of [[Sail Street]], branched near [[Mirt's Mansion]], and linked up to a junction room (SF48). The Grim Passage itself wound and twisted through the [[rat]]-infested remnants of old, filled-in and forgotten cellars and disused privy chutes, until curving into a dead end where the hidden door above the statue laid. The drop down to the Grim Statue was roughly {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}.
;[[Fireplace Level]]: This complex of rooms within the Dungeon of the Crypt was connected to the midden of the [[Grinning Lion]] and a junction room in the sewers beneath it (SF31) by means of a secret staircase.
;[[Lost Level]]: This sixth level of Undermountain was connected to the sewers by means of a ''[[portal]]'' that was visible only on the night of a full [[Selûne (moon)|moon]] in the month of [[Flamerule]].

===Sewer Ecology===
[[File:WaterdeepSewerGrate.png|thumb|273px|''A creature reaches up through a street's sewergrate.'']]
There were a great deal of creatures that inhabited this sewer network, far more than could logically be expected to find enough food to survive. Many of these creatures entered the sewers by means of the Dungeon of the Crypt and Undermountain.<ref name ="WatN-p26" /> There were also a wide variety of [[fungi]] and [[ooze]]s that lived in the sewers, with there being a small chance of an ooze crawling its way up the privy pipes of the sewers.

[[Adventurer]]s,{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Oozes and Privys}} Such groups sometimes hired Cellarers to guide them through the sewers at the cost of 20 [[gold piece]]s a day, but such guides never carried weapons and would stick to only traveling the primary passages.

Explorers of the sewers risked exposure to [[sewer plague]]s. The waters were generally tainted with [[blinding sickness]] and any open wounds ran the risk of being contaminated with [[filth fever]].

===Surface Shafts & Junction Rooms===
Some areas connected between primary passages, known as '''junction rooms''', were square in shape. They measured {{SI|10|ft}} by {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}, were {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} tall, and had a sitting ledge near their ceiling.

Entrances into the sewer network were known as '''surface shafts'''. They measured {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, were typically spherical in shape, and had iron rungs set in the walls for use as [[ladder]]s. They were capped by covers made either wholly of metal or of metal-banded wood. These covers were known as "manholes" or "person access covers."<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Wellhouses of Waterdeep}}

;[[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]: Up until the late-14{{th}} century DR, it was the duty of the City Watch to police the sewers. After this authority switched over to the City Guard, watchmen rarely ever entered the sewers. Only doing so if pursuing a suspect or when they discovered sewer tunnels that connected with cellars. All Watch captains possessed keys to the sewer access points of their assigned ward.<ref>

;[[Savants of the Dark Tide]]: This aboleth-led criminal organization had its base of operations within this sewer network and mainly operated within it.
;[[Unseen]]: This secret society operated out of both the sewers and [[Rat Hills]] for decades, but following the [[Rat Hills Conflagration]] they began having their main meetings within secret rooms in the sewers. Their leader, [[Hlaavin]], also kept many safe houses within the sewers.<ref>
;[[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]: This guild had safehouses scattered throughout the sewers, hidden by secret doors.<ref> Tunnels were often marked with the symbol of the guild in yellow [[chalk]], helping to guide members to the safehouses.

==History==
These sewers were built over the course of many generations, dating as far back as [[1162 DR]]. As far back as this date, there existed three levels to the sewer system.

During the days of Ahghairon, a number of [[Underdark]] creatures tried to invade the sewers and Waterdeep proper by means of a ''portal'' within Undermountain, which he put an end to by means of the ''[[gatewarp]]'' spell.

At some point a group of [[dwarves]] established a kingdom beneath the sewers, which eventually fell into ruin and became a mere legend on the surface. Their ruins were later discovered by the archeaologist [[Wently Kelso]].{{Cite document/Eye of the Beholder/Clue Book|30}}

In [[1208 DR]], in the month of [[Kythorn]], some unauthorized construction was discovered on the second level of the sewers.

After securing a stronghold in [[1262 DR]] (that would later be renamed the Citadel of the Bloody Handy), the [[Shadow Thieves]] constructed for it two links to the sewers of Waterdeep.

In [[1280 DR]], in the month of [[Mirtul]], some trapped sewer gas was cleared from an area on the third sewer level. [[1281 DR|A year later]], on the month of Kythorn, a cistern area was added to the second level of the sewers. And in [[1292 DR]], on the month of [[Tarsakh]], flood control gates on the second level were repaired and additional ones were installed.

In [[1298 DR]], the Shadow Thieves were driven out of the city and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] had the citadel's two passages to the sewers garrisoned by the City Guard. From then on they were occasionally employed by high-ranking occupants of Castle Waterdeep when a discreet exit was desired.

Some time in the late 1350's DR, on [[Mirtul 15]],<ref>{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|10}} twelve [[tanystropheus]] eggs ordered by [[Phalantar's Philtres & Components]] hatched and escaped into the sewers via a garbage chute. That night a crew of Cellarers were attacked by the young [[dinosaur]]s while laying a large, heavy length of pipe. One member was killed, while two others were badly mauled. Frustrated by this, the guild offered a reward of 200 gold pieces for their capture (dead or alive), while [[Phalantar Orivan]] himself offered 500 gp for live specimens and 100 gp for dead ones.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|8-9}} By [[Uktar 30|the end of Uktar]], it was assumed that any tanystropheuses not recovered were dead from the winter weather.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|15}}

Around this decade, false and terribly inaccurate maps of the sewers were being sold by people trying to pass themselves off as Cellarers.

In [[1355 DR]], in the months of [[Ches]] and Tarsakh, flood control blocks were proposed for some areas of the upper sewer level.

In [[1357 DR]], a man from [[Luskan]] by the name of [[Neruudan]] set about making a smuggling ring in Waterdeep. To that end, he hired an evil mage to clear out the upper sewers. The mage put a giant crocodile in the sewers, with his [[quasit]] [[familiar]] riding upon its back and directing the beast, killing members of the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild until they began to refuse to do work. However, Neruudan was unaware of the sewers' use as a highway by locals and their wide selection of dangerous fauna, which eventually lead to the downfall of his plans.

In [[1358 DR]], during the [[Time of Troubles]], the mortal [[avatar]] of [[Myrkul]] opened a ''portal'' between [[Hades]] and the [[Prime Material plane]]. Hoards of [[undead]] came rushing out through the sewers and up into the Dock Ward.<ref> The guardsman [[Ylarell]] tracked these undead and in the process was slain by Myrkul.<ref> Five Cellarers also became lost in the sewers during this time, having been transformed into cursts that continued to patrol the sewers for decades.

In the wake of Myrkul's destruction a [[deathshrieker]] was created in the sewers beneath what later became known as [[Cynosure]]. It would stalk the sewers for over a decade.

Also during this year, on [[Marpenoth 7]] an [[Heroes of Waterdeep|adventuring band]] received orders from the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to travel into the city's sewers to put an end to the ongoing plans of [[Xanathar (original)|Xanathar]].{{Cite document/Eye of the Beholder/Clue Book|27}} which included several notes on the hazards and creatures they could expect to encounter.{{Cite document/Eye of the Beholder/Clue Book|2}} Secretly aided by another beholder,{{Cite dungeon/206/The Xanathar: Crime Lord of Waterdeep}}

In [[Eleint]], [[1367 DR]], new creatures began to be encountered in the sewers by members of the Plumbers' Guild, such as sewerms. Some of these new creatures originated from the Rat Hills, such as gulguthydrae, having fled into the sewers following the Rat Hills Conflagration.<ref>

In [[1369 DR]], during the event known as [[Halaster's Higharvestide]], a number of creatures crawled out from the sewers and terrorized the people of Waterdeep.<ref> Following this event, the guard station located near the northern entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand became primarily concerned with guarding against the [[living spell]]s that still remained after Halaster's Higharvestide.

That same year the city faced an attack by the forces of [[Iakhovas]]. In the wake of that repelled invasion a number of sea creatures escaped into the sewer system, with some of them, like the [[malenti]] [[Laaqueel]], having been led into the sewers through a surface shaft at Coin Alley by Iakhovas himself.

Among the dozens of aboleths that fought in the army of Iakhovas there was one trio, hailing from the [[Swordsea Depths]], who had joined in this assault for the sole purpose of using the chaos to sneak their way into the city's sewer system. Within the sewers the would-be Savants of the Dark Tide established a lair, then over time gradually enslaved members of the Cellarers’ & Plumbers’ Guild and transformed rogues into skum servitors.

Around 1372 DR, the [[doomsphere]] [[Xliiqil]] began stalking the sewers, trying to learn what happened to the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] who had slayed it decades prior. Also around this time, eyeballs and lurking stranglers roamed the sewers on behalf of Xanathar. After the event known as the [[Silence of Lolth]] began in [[Eleasis 28]],<ref> some [[drow]] fled into the depths of the [[Lowerdark]] and displaced the rylkar, a rat-like species to known to only a few Underdark experts. Moving to higher subterannean depths, the rylkar began infesting sewers in Faerûn, including the Sewers of Waterdeep.

In [[1385 DR]], the [[Spellplague]] hit Toril and caused all of the [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep]] to become animated and wreak havoc across the city. The [[Blackstaff]] at the time, [[Tsarra Chaadren]], turned the ground to mud underneath a statue known as the [[God Catcher]]. It sank partway into the ground, one of its legs penetrating a sewer line. Once the statues became immobile the God Catcher remained where it had sunken and was eventually converted into a tenement building, while its leg was hollowed out to create an access point to the sewer system.

Around In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a number of dwarves attempting to dig larger homes for themselves in [[Undercliff]] inadvertently breach Waterdeep's sewers in the process.<ref>

In {{Yearlink|1491}}, shortly after [[Mistshore]] was largely destroyed in a massive fire,<ref> Xanathar had some areas of the sewer network diverted in order to give his organization more space, which resulted in a large daily influx of sewage into Deepwater Harbor. Merfolk who lived nearby made attempts to clean the area, but were slaughtered by an undead [[eye of the deep]] under Xanathar's command. Eventually, [[Laeral Silverhand]] intervened &mdash; the meddlings of Xanathar were undone, the eye of the deep was slain, and harbor waters were revitalized.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-05-08 - Waterdeep's 15th century Sewer Debacle}}

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} [[Jeryth Phaulkon]] sent ''[[awaken]]ed'' rats into the sewers to search for Xanathar's hidden lair, eventually discovering a secret spiral stairwell in the sewers beneath the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]].<ref>
