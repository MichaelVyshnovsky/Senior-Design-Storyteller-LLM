'''Kazayama''' was a mountain located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Kazayama was situated on the border between [[Iwari Province|Iwari]] and [[Fukudo Province]]s on the island of [[Shinkoku]].  Once a lofty and snow-capped summit, Kazayama now exhibited a dished-out shape, a peculiar aftermath of a magical confrontation.

The slopes of Kazayama bore the remnants of curious glasslike stone and [[obsidian]], a result of the mountain's magical destruction. The locals utilized these glassy rocks to craft knives and decorative items, and it was rumored that such artifacts possessed an affinity for enchantment, boasting arcane magical properties.

==History==
Kazayama was also known as '''Broken-Dish Mountain''' due to a duel between the [[wu jen]]s [[Ch'u Tei Zao]] and [[Goboro the Lame]] in {{yearlinkConvert|1215|KY}}, which resulted in the mountain's peak being ravaged by their magical clash.
