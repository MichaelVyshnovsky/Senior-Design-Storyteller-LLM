Javuhansa was a town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.
Javuhansa lay at the source of the Kunong River,Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, Javuhansa has not been labelled on any map of Malatra. However, it is known to be on the headwaters (source) of the Kunong River, which, based on descriptions, is most likely the river from the central hill country and joining the Fenghsintzu River. It stood at the northern end of the trade road to the south, which passed through Enlasre south of Javuhansa.
Gold and ivory collected in the southern jungles were carried north via caravan to Javuhansa in the midâ€“14 century DR. These goods were sold in its open markets.
More notably, Javuhansa was the best place to get imported herbs, spices, and medicinal plants in all of Malatra. These were expensive and often rare, even magical.
