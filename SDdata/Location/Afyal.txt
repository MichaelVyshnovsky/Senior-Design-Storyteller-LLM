}}'''Afyal''', also called the '''Isle of the Elephant''', was a large island kingdom at the eastern edge of [[Zakhara]], north of [[Sahu]].

==Geography==
The kingdom's capital, [[Medina al-Afyal]], was also its only real city. The landscape of Afyal was mainly untamed jungles with wild creatures in abundance. Afyal was also the location of a fallen empire whose ruins were scattered across the island's jungles,<ref> often bearing inscriptions in the forgotten language [[Affa]].<ref><ref>

==Trade==
It had rich deposits of [[gemstone]]s and precious metals, [[spices]], and valuable hardwoods which grew in abundance. The presence of these raw materials combined with its advantageous position ''en route'' to Zakhara's trading partners in the [[Kara-Tur|far east]] made Afyal one of the wealthiest areas of the continent. Fabulous jewelry was one of their prime exports.
