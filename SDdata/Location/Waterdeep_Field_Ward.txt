The '''Field Ward''' of [[Waterdeep]] was an unofficial ward of the city, located between the inner and outer walls on the north side of town. It was in fact the city's slums — possessing the poorest living conditions within the city, was rife with crime, and served as a home to the most destitute Waterdhavian citizens.

==Description==
The ward had muddy, unpaved streets and no sanitation services or working [[sewer|sewer system]]. It was especially crowded, noisy and foul-smelling — stinking of slaughter-houses, tanneries, and waste. These [[Guild of Butchers|guild]] businesses whose industries were rather offensive to the nose and ears were all relegated to the Field Ward, outside the city proper.

The [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] did not patrol here, but the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] watched over the road between the inner and outer gates to protect those passing through.

Many poor [[elves]], half-breeds, servants, homeless squatters and other disregarded Waterdhavians, such as those with obvious deformities, called this district their home.

==History==
Originally a caravan yard during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Field Ward was the last destination for the many refugees that came to Waterdeep following the [[Spellplague]].

==Notable Locations==
;Taverns:
* [[Endshift Tavern]]: This establishment was popular among off-duty officers of the City Watch
