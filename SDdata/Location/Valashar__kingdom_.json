        "Geography": "At its founding, Valashar extended from the highlands near the start of the [[Sulduskoon River]] north to the headwaters of the [[Amstel River]]. On the west, it bordered the [[halfling]] kingdom of [[Meiritin]] At its height, the country extended north to the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]] and far beyond into even the [[High Moor]], pushing east even toward the western borders of [[Cormyr]] and west to the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Government": "Valashar's only ruler was its founder, King [[Ashar Tornamn]], though he was only considered a [[Alzhedo dictionary#N|''nazir'']] by the Shoon Imperium.",
        "Defenses": "A wooden fortress, later named [[Fort Ilbratha]], defended the northernmost region of Valashar. It was located in the eastern foothills of the Troll Mountains.",
        "History": "Valashar was founded in [[361 DR]]{{Valashar dates}} by Lord Ashar Tornamn, a prince and the fourth nephew of King [[Karaj Tiiraklar II]] of [[Tethyr]]. As only fourth in line to the throne of Tethyr, Ashar sought another means to power. Over fifteen years, he slowly built up an army and continuously spread the territory under his control, all in the name of the Shoon Empire.\n\nThe largest territorial expansion came during [[Ashar's March]], when King Ashar marched in a fifteen-month campaign, without orders from either the Emperor or the king of Tethyr, north as far as the High Moor by the end of summer, [[376 DR]].{{Valashar dates}}\n\nUnknown to most, it was the secret machinations of Emperor [[Shoon VI]] and his advisors that orchestrated these events. They hoped to eventually conquer Cormyr.\n\nIt was because of the constant expansion of Valashar and the demands for taxes along the Sword Coast that Crown Prince [[Azoun Obarskyr I|Azoun I]] of [[Cormyr]] had the magic sword ''[[Ilbratha]]'' forged. Wielding the blade, Cormyr's heir apparent waged a valiant campaign against Valashar and the Shoon Empire. In [[376 DR]], Cormyr wiped out the army of Valashar in a great battle on the [[Fields of the Dead]] before marching into Tethyr and sacking the city of [[Darromar|Ithmong]].\n\nKing Ashar was executed that same year by the Shoon Empire for antagonizing King Azoun.\n\nMost of the territory of Valashar was absorbed into the kingdom of [[Cortryn]], another short-lived kingdom, in [[491 DR]]."
