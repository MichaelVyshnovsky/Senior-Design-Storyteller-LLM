        "mainbody": "'''Auckney''' was a small fiefdom near the [[Spine of the World]]. It was ruled by the noble [[Auck]] family. Because its cold location was somewhat removed from busy trade routes, it was not often visited.",
        "Geography": "[[File:Iceflow.png|thumb|''Map showing the location of Auckney.''{{Auckney-location}}]]\nAuckney was located on the Cold Run. The village hugged a small, round harbor that was dominated by an island topped by Castle Auck. Sea cliffs lined the southern edge of the harbor and beyond the village's farms was the steep [[Maerlon Mountain]].",
        "Description": "The village was constantly beset by fog and strong, cold wind. An abandoned lighthouse sat on a cliff to the north of the harbor. Villagers said they could sometimes hear a woman screaming from inside the tower.\n\nIn part because of its location in the harbor, [[Castle Auck]] was removed from the village. The castle, which had two 15-foot-tall towers and a 12-room house, itself was built in the 8th century [[DR]] by the [[Dorigast]] family. However, the Auck family had reigned there for more than 400 years.\n\nThe Lord of Auckney ran a number of towers surrounding the fiefdom. When a flag flew above the tower, it was manned by a handful of soldiers.",
        "Demographics": "In about [[1369 DR]], Auckney had a population of around 200, most living in the village around the harbor or on surrounding farms. Auckney was mostly inhabited by humans, but a population of [[gnome]]s settled there, having to work extra hard to be accepted by its human inhabitants. For that reason, the gnomes of Auckney were known for their work ethic.",
        "Notable inhabitants": "* [[Colson]], the girl rescued by [[Wulfgar]] while still a baby.\n* [[Feringal Auck]], Lord of Auckney ca. [[1369 DR]].\n* [[Tristan Auck]], former Lord of Auckney.\n* [[Priscilla Auck]], Feringal's older sister.\n* [[Temigast]], steward to Lord Feringal.\n* [[Liam Woodgate]], a [[gnome|gnomish]] carriage driver\n* [[Meralda Ganderlay]], Colson's true mother who married Feringal.\n* [[Jaka Sculi]], Colson's true father.\n* [[Soth]], a scholar encountered at the [[Wyrm's Tooth]] glacier.\n* [[Kieran Nye]], owner and bartender of the [[Whistling Gallows]] inn in [[Lonelywood]]"
