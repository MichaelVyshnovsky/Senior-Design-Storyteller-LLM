Nun was a small village on the Vilhon Reach filled with priests.
Nun rested on the site of the Battle of Nun (part of the Rotting War conflict of 902 DR.
As of 1357 DR, Nun was occasionally raided by an orc tribe named the Flaming Spike. The tribe lived in an ancient dwarven hold in the Akanapeaks.
Nun was often refereed to as a shrine rather than a village because the majority of its inhabitants were priests.
Although Nun was filled with followers of numerous faiths, Tempus was the most prominent. There were also notable shrines to Silvanus and Tyr.
Nun was a peaceful village and avoided getting involved in the politics of its region.
