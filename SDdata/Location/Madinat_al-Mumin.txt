'''Madinat al-Mumin''', or '''The City of the Faithful''',  was a small settlement located on the [[Steaming Isles]] within the [[Crowded Sea]] of southern [[Zakhara]].

==Inhabitants ==
Each and every one of the inhabitants of this town lived for the [[Law of the Loregiver]], firmly believing that as long as the Law was practiced within Madinat al-Mumin, that it would never cease to exist regardless of what happened to the rest of the Land of Fate 

==Defenses==
A militia of 28 individuals could be assembled if needed, but the citizens of Madinat al-Mumin were peaceful, learned folk who could call upon [[Fate]] to aid them.

==Description==
Madinat al-Mumin gleamed like a wealthy city of a larger size. All of the buildings were white-washed, and many possessed fabulous architecture. The town boasted a grand palace that seemed out of place for such a small settlement.

==History==
Madinat al-Mumin was founded by [[Jamila]] the Virtuous and her husband. Together they discovered the descendants of [[Nog]] and [[Kadar]] and guided them to [[Enlightenment]].
