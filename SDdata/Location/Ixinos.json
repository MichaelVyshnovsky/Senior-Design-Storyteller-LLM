It was also where the [[Vilhon Reach]] met the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].<ref>Todd Gamble, Dennis Kauth, and Robert Lazzaretti http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/wd_maps/FRposterLarge_150.jpg \n\nAs of [[1370 DR]], the island was populated by a matriarchal tribe, comprised almost entirely of women, and ruled by Queen [[Elissa Tarixon]]. The island nation refused all visitors, even diplomatic envoys, and would trade only with select ships captained by women. The few men who existed on the island were considered highly-valuable slaves.\n\nIxinos was also the home base of the all-women mercenary company known as the [[She-Wolves]], who secured Ixinos from pirate incursions as well as sought out mercenary opportunities throughout the Vilhon Reach.",
