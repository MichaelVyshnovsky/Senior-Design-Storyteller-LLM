The Twilight Marsh was a swamp found in the Moonsea region of North Faer√ªn.
While the swamp was typically blanketed with heavy rain and a thick fog in the early hours of the morning, light from middays sun shone through the canopy of trees in a manner that resembled the soft glow of sunset.
It was situated on the northern shore of the Moonsea lake,The Crossing Inn is stated as being  east of Phlan, and approximately  north of the swamp.
As the Trank River flowed south from the Vanishing Hills, it opened up into a depression in the land, flowing between the small tors and thick vegetation that made up the Twilight Marsh. As the currents formed by the river continued southward, they formed an eddy that encircled the archipelago known as the Ringcurrent Islands.
The swamp was home to animals typically found in wetland environments, such crocodiles, swarms of biting insects, and snakes that would unsuspectingly drop down from tree branches.
Perhaps the most menacing of the swamps wildlife were giant toads, which could swallow a person whole in a single gulp.
Some time in the late 15 century DR, the black dragon Throstulgrael relocated to the Twilight Marsh from the Flooded Forest to the south and killed the local king of the lizardfolk in a show of power. He then pit the lizardfolk tribes against one another, forcing them to compete for a role of chieftain of each tribe.
Over the next tenday or so, the lizardfolk of the swamp began abducting people from the surrounding areas, raiding farms north along the River Trank. Fortunately for the farmers and their families, a group of adventurers rescued them from captivity and thwarted the plans of Throstulgrael. In an act of vengeance, the black dragon cut a swath of destruction across the surrounding lands of the Moonsea.
* Bloodroot Hollow, home of the Bloodroot coven of hags.
* Hall of the Black Bull, a ruined keep once held by cultists that was taken over by the black dragon Throstulgrael.
The swamp was home to no less than three clans of lizardfolk, including the Rootwater and Dusk-Dusk clans. For many years they were ruled by Lizard King Scalecrusher, until his untimely death at the hands of Throstulgrael.
As was their habitat, will-o-wisps could be found fluttering around the Twilight Marsh.
* Bogclaw, the younger Lizard King of the Muckmarsh lizardfolk.
* Rythnax, a black dragon wyrmling that made his lair in the marsh.
* Yusten Karas, a drow assassin that fled into the swamp after escaping imprisonment.
