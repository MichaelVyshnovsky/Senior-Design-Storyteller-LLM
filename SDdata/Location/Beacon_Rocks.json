        "mainbody": "The '''Beacon Rocks''' were a small cluster of about twelve unsettled islands, located almost halfway between the island nation of [[Nimbral]] and the [[Snout of Omgar]] in the [[Great Sea]].",
        "Description": "To all appearances, the islands were barren.",
        "History": "During the rule of [[Calimshan|Calishite]] emperor [[Shoon IV]], Shoon had constructed a lighthouse to protect sailing ships from the rocky islands.\n\nIn [[605 DR]], a large number of vessels from Western [[Thindol]], whose citizens were escaping unrest and anarchy in their country, crashed upon the Beacon Rocks during a massive storm.\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], two individuals of [[Arcane (race)|the Arcane]] were said to have been living on at least one of the islands.",
        "Notable Locations": "The Beacon Tower of Shoon IV stands on the largest of the islands. It was renamed the [[Beckoning Tower of Shoon]], because of the magical enchantment that had been placed upon it, which compelled those who saw its light to drive their vessels directly towards it and destruction upon the rocks."
