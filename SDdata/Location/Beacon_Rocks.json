        "mainbody": "The Beacon Rocks were a small cluster of about twelve unsettled islands, located almost halfway between the island nation of Nimbral and the Snout of Omgar in the Great Sea.\nTo all appearances, the islands were barren.\nDuring the rule of Calishite emperor Shoon IV, Shoon had constructed a lighthouse to protect sailing ships from the rocky islands.\nIn 605 DR, a large number of vessels from Western Thindol, whose citizens were escaping unrest and anarchy in their country, crashed upon the Beacon Rocks during a massive storm.\nIn 1361 DR, two individuals of the Arcane were said to have been living on at least one of the islands.\nThe Beacon Tower of Shoon IV stands on the largest of the islands. It was renamed the Beckoning Tower of Shoon, because of the magical enchantment that had been placed upon it, which compelled those who saw its light to drive their vessels directly towards it and destruction upon the rocks."
