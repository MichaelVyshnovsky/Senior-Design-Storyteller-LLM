        "mainbody": "Dock Ward was one of the four port wards of the city of Calimport.\nDock Ward had the highest percentage of taverns and festhalls in the whole metropolis of Calimport. It also had the most warehouses and the most shipping berths, even more than neighboring Armada Ward, where the navy kept their ships.\nThe ward was known for its rowdy entertainment. After taverns, festhalls, and inns, the next most common buildings were warehouses, followed by cheap row houses built atop the wards taverns and then by rope sellers and sail makers. Structures made of mud bricks or wood, with thatched roofs, were common here. There were a few houses or other larger buildings, such as the villas of the pashas of sea-related guilds, but these were rare.\nThe public docks were located here and in Hook Ward to the east. Dock Ward was a long and narrow ward, stretching west to east on the water. To the north, it bordered Palace Ward, Jewel Ward, Grand Ward, Quill Ward, and Wizard Ward.\nThe ruler of the ward was Sultan Batras yn Faruk el Tuladim. He was promoted to the position of sultan by Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal for helping the rising caleph attain his position during the Darkstalker Wars. Batras, a sabbalad at the time, used his connections with the guilds of harbormasters and shipbuilders to financially ruin his own opponents, while he arranged for the murders of members of El Djenispool, the main opponents of El Pesarkhal.\nAs Dock Wards leader, Batras preferred to allow the guilds to be run by their pashas.\nDock Ward was divided into three sabbans with nine drudachs.\nAlso known as \"Tavern Sabban\", this sabban was dominated by alcohol-selling establishments.  It contained three drudachs Qademit Drudach, Markhib Drudach, and Meena Drudach.\nThe mark for this sabban was a mug of ale, with the liquid forming a wave at the top.\n Notable Locations\n The Ninth Bell  This was a popular two-story tavern. Location Qademit Drudach.\n Palace of the Cresting Wave  This luxurious, seven-story temple was dedicated to Istishia, the god of elemental water.

Location Meena Drudach.\nAlso known as \"Festhall Sabban\", this district was known for its many festhalls.  It contained three drudachs Harayal Drudach, Bayown Drudach, and Rehla Drudach.\nThe sabban mark was a pair of dice. Residents and visitors liked to touch the sabban mark for good luck, and in many places in the district, the mark had been worn down to a pair of cubes.\n Notable Locations\n The Oceans Heart  This festhall was spread throughout two separate buildings, one one-story and one two-story.
