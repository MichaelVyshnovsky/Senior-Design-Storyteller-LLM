Amnwater was a large town in Amn that acted as a vital caravan stop on the long trade route that ran between the east and west of the country.
The town sat at the meeting of the Lake Way, South Fork, Esmel Road, and Eshpurta Road, making it one of the most important crossroads in Amn.
The Wengwater flowed north of the city from the Cloud Peaks to Lake Weng. It flooded severely every spring, leaving a wide expanse of ponds that slowly evaporated over summer.
Amnwater was officially ruled by the High Wheel, who was responsible for overseeing the militia, defenses, and general infrastructure and welfare of the town. By the 14 century DR, the city was effectively owned and run by the Yhliivast, Wheelarit, and Ironseth families, who collectively dominated the businesses tied to the caravan trade.
The town fell under the Alandor Sect of Shadow Thieves, which covered much of northern Amn.
In 1370 DR, the town was made up of 60% humans, 25% halflings, and 15% other folk. An average of 7,500 people lived permanently in the town, with temporary visitors increasing it to 15,000 in summer and a peak of 26,000 in autumn as caravans made their last run of the year.
The towns economy was strongly devoted to supporting caravans and merchants as they passed through the crossroads. Wheelwrights, wainwrights, horse traders, and coopers did extremely well for themselves as the endless caravans rolled in, as did the owners of stables, inns, and taverns. Mercenaries and sellswords found good work in Amnwater as so many employers passed through, and it wasnt uncommon for a caravan to struggle into town after surviving an attack, looking for more guards to hire. The town also had some well-regarded armorers, though they would happily upcharge any customers who needed emergency work done.
The tavern that founded the village was famed for the beer that it produced, Amnwater No.1. It continued to be brewed and exported through the 14 century DR.
Amnwater was protected by a militia controlled by the High Wheel, and surrounded by a low stone wall. The large road gates tightly controlled the incoming and outgoing wagon traffic, while foot traffic used smaller side gates.
The town defenses were supplemented by the wide-ranging Council Army road patrol from Keczulla.
Amnwater started as a tavern and trail stop on the long road between Crimmor and Eshpurta. It became a proper village in 1107 DR, and continued growing over the following centuries.
By about 1320 DR, the Wheelarit, Yhliivast, and Ironseth families had managed to corner the various businesses that Amnwater was built on. This enabled them to unofficially control the town and limit the power of the High Wheel.
The town had a large amount of inns and taverns ranging from decent to exceptional that catered to the travelers and caravans that continually passed through.
