Sheshyrinnam, meaning "the homes of the faithul", also known as the Temple Ward, was the region of Myth Drannor that housed many of its greater temples, along with quite a few of its taverns. It was the second-oldest part of the city, only after its neighboring ward of Cormanthor.
Many of the structures in the Temple Ward were constructed of stone or hollowed out of petrified trees.
The Temple Ward was located on the western side of the city, encompassing the entirety of its northwestern borders.
