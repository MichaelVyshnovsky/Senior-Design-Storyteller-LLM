The '''Stonelands''' were a range of desolate plains and moorlands that extended north and south of the [[Storm Horns]] mountain range, lying between [[Anauroch]] and [[Cormyr]]. Its northern extents joined the [[Goblin Marches]] and [[High Moors]] in a narrow band of habitable lands south of the Anauroch desert, forming an infamous region inhabited by countless tribes and monsters of all kinds.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Geography==
The Stonelands consisted of dry plains and hills that had a harsh beauty to them, marked by knife-edged ridges, deep ravines, caverns and overhangs.

The southern Stonelands lay entirely within the traditional borders of Cormyr, formed of a rough plateau of broken, treacherous ground north of the [[High Road]] starting with the [[Stonecliff]]'s limestone escarpment, transitioning to the granite foothills of the Storm Horns. The [[Helmlands]] made up a significant portion of the region following the [[Time of Troubles]], turning a large part of the southern Stonelands into a dangerous and unstable region of tar pits, [[wild magic]] and [[dead magic]] zones. Following the [[Spellplague]], the Helmlands expanded across much of the southern Stonelands.{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|18}}{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Spellplague: The Wailing Years}}

The northern Stonelands were what people generally referred to when they meant the Stonelands, as they were far more wild and inhospitable than the south. The eastern bounds were roughly delineated by the [[Moonsea Ride]], though the wilderness was not really distinguished from the rolling plains of the upper [[Immerflow]] and [[Tilver's Gap]], or the foothills of the [[Thunder Peaks]]. The northern edge of the Stonelands blended with the lower-lying [[Desertsedge]] of Anauroch, which consisted largely of dry rocky hills. The dried-up river valley of [[Raudilauth]] divided the Stonelands from [[Alauthwaerd]] the Watcher, the southernmost peak of the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], and provided a passable trail into [[Anauroch]]. The western edge merged with the bogs, hills, and broken ground of the [[Goblin Marches]], while the [[High Moors]] rose to the south along the foothills of the Storm Horns.

===Geographical Features===
The Eastern [[Storm Horns]] and [[Gnoll Peaks]] were great mountains that cut through the center of the Stonelands, and provided a natural barrier for Cormyr against threats from the north. They roughly divided the Stonelands into northern and southern halves, each with distinct regional qualities.

The northern Stonelands had poor soil consisting largely of dry [[clay]] unsuited to agriculture, but was mostly free of stones, instead named for the extraordinary rocks that protruded from the ground. These rocks varied in size from boulders to spires hundreds of feet tall, scattered haphazardly about the land with no apparent pattern. They appeared as if they had fallen with great force, with the larger ones often embedded in the ground at dangerous angles and looming threateningly over the landscape.

* The [[Gnoll Flats]], a level area of ground amid the broken hills.
* The valley of [[Raudilauth]] divided the Stonelands from the Desertsmouth Mountains to the north, and provided an accessible route into the Desertsedge of the [[Sword]].
* [[Startop Crag]], a peak in the northern Stonelands just south of the High Meadows.
* The [[Stonewoods]], a forest that grew south of the [[Hunter's Hills]] on the edge of the Stonelands in the 15{{th}} century DR.

The southern Stonelands tended towards desolate, broken ground that rose from the Stonecliff and disappeared into the foothills of the Storm Horns. A great contrast to the low-lying fertile forests and plains of Cormyr, it comprised vast sweeping moors that were accentuated by stony tors. A great profusion of ravines, cliffs and streams broke up the terrain, making it difficult to travel across on foot and almost impossible by mount.

* The [[Starwater River]], that descended from the Storm Horns across the southern Stonelands, cutting through Starwater Gorge and the Stonecliff.

===Flora & Fauna===
{{Quote|Adventurers, eh? We get a lot of 'em here. Durn fools go traipsing after monsters like it was some kind of sport... a game. Well, let me tell you, it ain't. Over half o' this town is Purple Dragons, and you know why? Monsters. Lotsa 'em, and Zhentish raiders!
|[[Purple Dragons]] sergeant greeting [[adventurer]]s at the gates of [[Halfhap]].}}

The folk of northern Cormyr feared the Stonelands as a place that all kinds of monsters poured out of to harry them, from mundane [[wolves]] to [[chimera]]e, [[fire lizard]]s, and [[hydra]]s.

The northern Stonelands had somewhat richer, less rocky soil than the nearby Goblin Marches, though this offered little advantage as the region was regularly struck by harsh storms and droughts. The flora largely consisted of hardy grasses, flowering weeds, prickly vines, scrub brush, mosses, lichen, and fungi. These flourished best in sheltered spots, especially in the shadows of the land's megaliths or growing upon their sides. Trees were uncommon and mostly grew around the edges of permanent streams and lakes, with their size severely curtailed by the harsh storms and unforgiving climate.

The natural fauna of the region was based on herds of [[antelope]], [[deer]], [[oxen]], [[sheep]], and [[goat]]s that fed on the grasses, along with great flocks of birds and many other smaller animals such as [[badger]]s, [[fox]]es, and [[rabbit]]s. These were preyed upon by [[bear]]s, wolves, [[eagle]]s, and [[giant owl]]s, with rarer [[giant spider]]s and [[Firedrake (dragonet)|firedrakes]] acting as apex predators. This balance was broken by constant pressure put upon the land, from the magical influences of [[Netheril]] to the short-sighted hunting of [[goblinoid]] tribes, causing these creatures to largely die out or migrate away by the 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|21-24}}

The remaining herbivores tended towards their [[dire animal|dire cousins]], including [[dire badger]]s, [[dire porcupine]]s, and [[dire skunk]]s, as well as other megafauna such as [[titanothere]]s, [[axebeak]]s, [[baluchitherium]], [[phororhacos]], and [[woolly rhinoceros]].

A few varieties of [[dinosaur]] lived within the Stonelands, though all were small [[ostrich]]-sized species. These included [[deinonychus]], [[fleshraker]]s, [[swindlespitter]]s, and [[velociraptor]]s. All of these species hibernated in deep rifts near [[earth node]]s and volcanic flows. They were never known to race along the heights of the Stonelands or ventured far from the region, as they feared being eaten by [[dragon]]s, [[darkenbeast|dark horror]]s, or [[Zhent]] [[foulwing]]s.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Dinosaurs in the Stonelands}}

Wolves were especially prevalent in the southern Stonelands, and harsh winters in northern Cormyr were called "wolf winters" for the packs that came down the Stonecliff to hunt.

{{Quote|In the summer, if you are not too hot, you're cold and wet. In the winter, you're just cold.
|Orcish commentary on the climate.}}

The northern Stonelands near Anauroch were marked by a harsh, unforgiving climate, variously attributed to the nearby Storm Horns and Desertsedge Mountains, Anauroch desert, and ancient [[Netherese]] magic run amok. Humidity, temperature, and precipitation fluctuated wildly throughout the year, regularly causing local flooding and droughts, as well as occasional hot winters and cold summers.

Summers were generally blazingly hot and humid, punctuated by swift and sudden thunderstorms that lashed the land with torrential rain, hail, and continuous lightning strikes before disappearing. The land did not retain water well despite the heavy rain, so the water quickly drained and flowed north into Anauroch. Winters tended to be cold, windy and dry, with flurries of powdery snow that blew about like dust and rarely piled up. Autumn and spring were transitory periods which were less dry than winter and cooler than summer, providing brief respites. Thanks to the harshness of the climate, the landscape was largely unchanging throughout the year with only a short green period in spring before the sun baked the land brown again.

The thunderstorms sometimes took on an unnatural aspect, on average once every three years, presumed to be the lingering results of ancient magical experiments or battles. On these rare occasions it could rain fire, enormous icicle-like hailstones, or [[acid]], potentially wiping out flora and fauna over miles of ground. On even rarer occasions, there were "storms" of [[antimagic]], which drained the powers of exposed [[magical]] items caught in them, as well as storms of [[wild magic]] which could spontaneously generate magical items, mutate and transform creatures, or cause any other conceivable (or inconceivable) effect.

In contrast, the weather in the southern Stonelands was relatively mild. They were usually wreathed in mists, that were blown away by the high winds accompanying frequent but mundane storms.

Although Cormyr claimed the Stonelands as part of its territory, it could not control it beyond where its soldiers marched. The Crown offered generous rewards for those who could establish and maintain settlements in the region, including King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]], Steel Regent [[Alusair Obarskyr|Alusair]], and King [[Foril Obarskyr I|Foril I]]. Many [[adventurer]]s and ambitious nobles attempted to claim the prize of the Barony of the Stonelands, though none managed to secure the land.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|56-57}}{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|17}}

The northern extents were an especially inhospitable place for "civilized" [[humanoid]]s and was home to potentially hundreds of independent tribes and bands of [[orc]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and other creatures.

==Trade==
The southern Stonelands were used by Cormyrean prospectors, game hunters, treasure-seekers and ranchers who could make a living from the wilderness. [[Arabel]] was the primary base of operations for these ventures, lending the big city a frontier feeling, with [[Eveningstar]] also serving as a gateway. Following the annexation of [[Tilverton]], many of these frontier folk moved on to new opportunities that arose in the northern Stonelands and [[Tilver's Gap]].

The area around [[Gnoll Pass]] was home to extensive [[coal]] mining operations, with bell pits common north of Arabel.

The closest thing to a trade route through the Stonelands was the [[Long Road to Riches]], a Zhentarim caravan route that passed around the southern edge of Anauroch. Its success was dependent on their agents parleying or manipulating the locals.

==History==
===Netheril & Hlundadim===
The southern frontier of [[Netheril]] received relatively little attention compared to that of the [[Northwest Faer√ªn|west]], though serious efforts were made to conquer and colonize the [[Forest Country]] and beyond. At the time, the future Stonelands were wooded, part of the greater [[Cormanthor]] and Forest Country, and home to great numbers of orcs, goblinoids, and kobolds. As the frontier moved south, many of these humanoids were killed or driven away into the Forest Country and along the coast of the [[Inner Sea]], and presented a consistent threat to Netheril. In {{yearlinkConvert|2573|NY}} the Netherese founded the outpost of [[Blister]] in the northern [[Thunder Peaks]], using it as a forward base for exploring and conquering the lands to the south. It was supported by a network of ''[[portal]]s'', including one in a [[Netherese Ruins (Stonelands)|Netherese outpost]] in the northern Stonelands, and the [[Laughing Head]] in the southern Stonelands. This intrusion was met by continual raids and skirmishes by the local humanoids, who were unable to directly strike at the fortress-city but over the centuries managed dominate the lands around it. Despite the great military and magical power of Netheril, it lost control of the region and the outlying ''portals'' were abandoned and hidden, though not deactivated. Blister managed to survive a surprise attack by [[phaerimm]]s in {{yearlinkConvert|3417|NY}} with heavy losses, but it never recovered. 

In the {{yearlinkConvert|3466|NY}}, in the midst of Netheril's decline and the spread of Anauroch, the [[Great Hlundadim]] rallied [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[kobold]]s into a great nation called [[Hlundadim]]. They proceeded to conquer the [[Windy Plains]], [[Goblin Marches]] and Stonelands, and warred with their neighbors fiercely. Blister survived until {{yearlinkConvert|3547|NY}}, 27 years after [[Karsus's Folly]], when it was destroyed and looted by kobolds. Following the fall of Netheril and Blister there was a great migration north of the displaced humanoids of the Forest Country and beyond, resettling in the Stonelands and [[Goblin Marches]]. The Stonelands became one of the regions variously settled and fought over by Hlundadim and the [[Lost Kingdoms]], scattering it with fortifications and remnants of powerful magic.

Legends told that the great rock formations in the northern Stonelands were created circa {{Yearlink|-200}} when [[Asram]] and [[Anauria]] attacked a realm that existed in the clouds of the region called [[Avaeraether]], in order to escape the encroachment of the ever-expanding [[Anauroch]] desert. The castles built among the clouds crashed down to the earth, creating the unique stone formations after which it was named.

Hlundadim's armies destroyed [[Tarkhaldale]] in {{Yearlink|-87}} and Anauria in [[111 DR]], giving it almost uncontested control over the lands north of the Storm Horns. They invaded a young [[Cormyr]] in [[198 DR]] and razed [[Arabel]], but were defeated by King [[Moriann Obarskyr]] in [[200 DR]].

===Post-Hlundadim===
The realm was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|268}} when great dust storms and desertification struck the Windy Plains, absorbing it into the Great Sand Sea. The Great Hlundadim disappeared and his former subjects fled south, disintegrating into warring bands. Although they eventually returned and rebuilt, the realm was forever broken. 

A second wave of desertification in [[1038 DR]] brought the desert south again to the edge of the Stonelands and Goblin Marches, destroying much of what had been rebuilt and drying out the local climate further. Hundreds of thousands of goblins, orcs, and other victims of the environmental catastrophe rallied under the warlord [[Izac Uthor]] in [[1090 DR]] and marched west, intending to conquer the whole of the [[Northwest Faer√ªn|North]], only to be destroyed in a huge [[Battle of Bones (battle)|battle]] at what would become known as the [[Battle of Bones]].

The 12{{th}} century [[DR]] saw the rise of the bandit warlord [[Rivior]], who built a large [[Rivior's Keep|keep]] and extensive [[Haunted Halls|underground fortifications]] in the southern Stonelands. He was defeated and killed by Queen [[Enchara]] of [[Esparin]], whose realm was also built in the Stonelands. Queen Enchara went on to marry Prince [[Palaghard Obarskyr I]] in [[1162 DR]], resulting in the union of Cormyr and Esparin into a single realm.

===14th Century===
King [[Rhigaerd Obarskyr II]] waged a great campaign against the [[border raiders]] during his time, bringing a period of peace to the realm. However, the threat from the Stonelands remained during the reign his son King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]], and resulted in the construction of [[Castle Crag]] in [[Gnoll Pass]] beginning around [[1347 DR]], which remained under construction for at least a decade onwards. It went on to become a major strongpoint and garrison for Cormyr's border, effectively halting raiders from entering Cormyr proper from the north.

In [[1352 DR]], [[Gondegal]]'s war spread into the Stonelands as he engaged in hit-and-run strikes on Cormyrean forces. One such unit, the [[Twilight Brigade]], razed the village of [[Darkenshield]] and slaughtered the inhabitants. At the same time, the [[Starburst Swords]] [[Purple Dragons]] sought to avoid combat with the Twilight Brigade, only to be ambushed by [[troll]]s and devoured. The inhabitants of the then-unruined nearby [[Tower of Ruin]] refused to aid them, resulting in both groups being shunned by [[Torm]] and facing judgment for their cowardice.

The bandit lord [[Jhassilm Onespear]] held a citadel in the Stonelands, before it was stormed by the mercenary [[Brandon]] some time before [[1356 DR]].

In [[1356 DR]], aggression by orcish tribes, [[Lashan Aumersair]], and [[Zhentil Keep]] resulted in Cormyr preemptively annexing [[Tilverton]], securing the whole eastern edge of the Stonelands. Purple Dragons were then able to patrol in force to [[Tilver's Gap]] and beyond, severely curtailing the Zhentarim's operations in the region and the ability of others to raid at will.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], in {{yearlinkName|1358}}, [[Bane]] reformed the ruins of [[Castle Kilgrave]] into an intact and unnatural fortress, and imprisoned [[Mystra]] inside. [[Caitlan Moonsong]] and [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]] freed her and Bane withdrew his power, causing the divinely-sustained fortress to vanish and be returned to a crumbling ruin. Mystra then attempted to force her way past [[Helm]] to the [[Celestial Stairway]], only to be violently destroyed by him. The force of her death turned Castle Kilgrave to dust completely and burned the land around it, leaving only an intact circle of stone foundations where Midnight had stood.

By the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, Lord [[Vorik Aris]] had accrued an army of mercenaries and secured [[Wyvernwatch Castle]], planning on using them to raid the border regions of Cormyr in preparation for a larger campaign that would see him crowned King. He marched on the ruins of Darkenshield, but his forces were destroyed by a group of adventurers who summoned the vengeful spirits of the residents and the duty-bound Starburst Swords, ending his ambitions.

Also in 1369 DR, Princess [[Alusair]] operated in the Stonelands, and commanded a troop of twenty-four young noble knights in pursuit of a bold [[orc]] band that had raided a caravan east of [[Eveningstar]]. In six days of pursuit, they killed a [[hydra]], a [[fire lizard]], and three [[chimera]]e. North of [[Startop Peak]], the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed before Alusair rallied them to defeat the orcs. They deduced the orcs served a [[dark naga]] and the [[Zhentarim]], who had been charming and transporting monsters into the area. Alusair and her knights defeated the naga and destroyed the ''[[gate]]'' before it could disgorge another monster, and resolved to seek out and destroy the other gates.

In mid-[[1372 DR]], [[Purple Dragons]] at the [[Black Crater]] spotted orcish raiders a few miles off the Moonsea Ride at an [[Netherese Ruin (Stonelands)|old Netherese ruin]]. This led to [[adventurer]]s hired by the Crown discovering the still-functional ''[[portal]]'' within, and the rest of the [[Blister]] ''portal'' network.{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|16-17}}

Following the official crowning of [[Azoun V]] as King in [[1389 DR]], Alusair's regency ended and she abandoned the court, spending most of her time in the Stonelands and other frontiers. She returned for [[Filfaeril Obarskyr|her mother]]'s funeral in [[1390 DR]], then vanished into the wilderness again, never returning.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|56-57}} She died fighting on the frontier shortly after, and became a duty-bound [[ghost]] tied to Cormyr.{{Cite digital book/Spellstorm|?|4}}

===15th Century===
During the war between [[Thultanthar]] and Cormyr in [[1486 DR]], Lady [[Marsheena]] drove [[goblin]]s, [[gnoll]]s, and monsters out of the Stonelands and into Cormyr, causing them to rampage through the countryside.{{Cite digital book/Fire in the Blood|?|20}} At the same time, an army of Shadovar invaded through a ''portal'' in the [[Forgotten Keep]], bypassing [[Castle Crag]] and the other defenses of Cormyr, going on to besiege [[Arabel]], [[Marsember]], and [[Suzail]].{{Cite digital book/Fire in the Blood|?|21}} In early [[Nightal]], the ''portal'' in the Forgotten Keep was sealed by the [[War Wizards]] and the Shadovar army destroyed, ending the invasion.{{Cite digital book/Fire in the Blood|?|30}}

;Ruins & Dungeons
The northern Stonelands were littered with the ruins of old settlements and fortifications, most of which came from the [[Netherese]] realms of [[Anauria]] and [[Asram]], as well as some of [[Hlundadim]]. Later ruins came from successive waves of explorers and colonizers who then fell to the perils of the Stonelands, which ultimately gave the Stonelands a high density of ruined structures. Regardless of the origin, the ruins were used as homes and hideouts for tribes and gangs, as well as lairs for monsters. The known ruins were poor prospects for treasure hunters by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], as they had long been picked clean and only contained dangerous residents.

The southern Stonelands were home to a number of old ruins, many built by those who sought to take land on the poorly-controlled borderlands of Cormyr. The Stonecliff in particular had a preponderance of abandoned wizard's abodes in caves or crumbling towers, drawing forth a regular stream of treasure-hunters seeking magical riches.

[[Image:Stonelands creatures.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|''A snapshot of the major creatures and tribes of the northern Stonelands and eastern Goblin Marches in the 1360s DR.'']]
The northern Stonelands were famously home to dozens of tribes of [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[hobgoblin]]s. These tribes shared a common origin with those of the [[Goblin Marches]] and [[High Moors]] from the ancient realm of [[Hlundadim]]. The martial legacy of Hlundadim granted many of these groups a level of technical and magical expertise that belied their primitive circumstances, while the legends of the realm's supremacy inspired them to rebuild and expand their lands, driving an aggression that would not have been present otherwise. The various races frequently hired each other as mercenaries or cohabited with each other, with monoracial tribes and settlements quite uncommon.

The goblin tribes tended to raise and live alongside [[wolves]], [[dire wolves]], and [[worg]]s, treating them not as pets but as family members. They kept slaves that were mostly goblins with a minority of other humanoids, though humans usually died rapidly from the poor living conditions and forced labor. Their settlements tended to be caves and old structures that they expanded with tunnelling, improving on the defenses with traps and cunning architecture learned in Hlundadim. Hobgoblins were once much more common, but declined significantly since the [[Battle of Bones (battle)|Battle of Bones]] and often lived as part of other tribes.

[[Image:Stonelands village.png|thumbnail|right|250px|''A Stonelands village scene.'']]
Orcish tribes were fairly common in the region, living in fortified wooden villages. They subsisted off hunting and farming, and mined [[iron]] that they used to forge their own tools, weapons, and armor. Their villages were usually home to other humanoids and giantkin as well, having them as martial reinforcements and marital prospects.

[[Kobold]]s and [[bugbear]]s were quite rare in the region, preferring to live deeper in the [[Underdark]] and avoid trouble on the surface unless a profitable opportunity arose. [[Gnoll]]s generally lived apart from all other peoples and were mostly found in unsettled tribes in the eastern Stonelands, led by [[flind]]s and accompanied by domesticated [[hyaenodon]]s. They had a particular hatred for [[stone giant]]s, who they believed slew the legendary gnoll [[Grrat]] and forever doomed them to insignificance. Small groups of [[medusa]]e and [[doppelganger]]s also made their homes in the hidden cave systems of the Stonelands, largely content to avoid notice by others.

More than a few [[human]] bandit gangs and malevolent [[wizard]]s made their homes in the forbidding wasteland, and the [[Zhentarim]] often had agents in the region to spy, parley, or trade with the locals. The Zhentarim ran the [[Long Road to Riches]] around the edge of the Anauroch and made influencing the locals a priority, using diplomacy and bribery to ensure safety for their interests while directing aggression towards [[Cormyr]] and the [[Dalelands]]. They went so far as to use mind-controlled [[doppelganger]]s to take over entire tribes and raider groups, directing them towards specific goals without apparent outside influence. In the southern Stonelands, they had numerous agents in place who used ruins and caves to hide from Cormyrean forces, and performed patrols of their own on flying beasts, sometimes directly over [[Eveningstar]].

Although it was normal for the inhabitants of the Stonelands to occasionally raid trade routes and settlements, some groups focused on this as their only occupation. These "[[border raiders]]" were highly aggressive and well-organized, striking regularly at humans in Cormyr and the Dales, [[elves]] in the [[Cormanthor]], and [[dwarves]] in the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]]. They almost always contained multiple types of creature who fulfilled different specialities and offset each other's weaknesses, including any combination of [[goblinoid]]s, orcs, [[giantkin]], kobolds, and more. Most of these border raider groups were secretly controlled by the great [[Red dragon|red wyrm]] [[Grinnsira]], who used her mastery of ''[[charm]]'' magic and a vast spy network to control her minions and ensure they performed well against their targets. She was actively opposed in these schemes by the [[silver dragon]] [[Fi Lendicol]], and unwittingly sabotaged by the Zhentarim, who bribed her minions in unproductive directions or secretly replaced them with doppelgangers.

===Giants & Dragons===
Giantkin were not uncommon in the Stonelands, with many [[ettin]]s and [[ogre]]s finding work as warriors with tribes of humanoids or giants, with the ogres usually bullying and mistreating their orc or goblin employers. Despite this, the combination of ogres and orcs led to a growing population of [[ogrillon]]s that were treated especially favorably by their orcish kin. Ettins got along well enough with the smaller creatures they met, and never enslaved them. Instead, they hired goblins and orcs as guards, hunters, or builders to improve their homes, and paid them generously in treasure. [[Troll]]s were rarer and normally lived in the [[Underdark]], only coming up for profitable long-term work or opportunistic raids.

Small tribes of [[hill giant]]s were common across the region, often working as mercenaries for humanoid tribes, and sometimes taking over if the idea struck them. [[Stone giant]]s normally lived in the nearby mountains, but were also seen traveling through the Stonelands for unknown reasons. [[Cloud giant]]s and [[storm giant]]s were also seen more rarely on the ground, either gathering food or trading, with the two kinds working together amicably and keeping [[giant eagle]]s as pets and [[roc]]s as mounts. They were believed to live in the [[Storm Horns]] to the south, as well as in [[Avaeraether]], if it even existed.

[[Dragon]]s were seen to lair or hunt in the region, with [[red dragon]]s most common, and generally occupied with terrorizing victims (goblins) and avoiding those who could fight back (giants). [[Copper dragon|Copper]], [[amethyst dragon|amethyst]] and [[silver dragon]]s were also seen in the region, usually for inscrutable reasons.

==Rumors==
* Cloud giants, storm giants, silver dragons and [[mist dragon]]s were believed to make their homes in the remnants of [[Avaeraether]].
* A border raider group found an ancient intact war galleon in the Stonelands around [[1367 DR]], leading to speculation that it had been used by [[Asram]] to assault the Cloudlands, or that it could [[Spelljammer|fly to other worlds]].
* Around 1367 DR, a captured raider orc claimed that the orcs and goblins of the Stonelands were close to uniting into a great army again, with the [[Neidlig]] most likely responsible.
* Large amounts of [[undead]] began appearing around 1367 DR with no apparent origin, sparking claims that the [[Zhentarim]] were raising them as an army, or some ancient dead realm had awoken on its own accord.
