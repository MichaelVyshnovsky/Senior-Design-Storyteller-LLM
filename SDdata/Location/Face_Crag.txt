'''Face Crag''' was a cleft located along the [[Trade Way]] between [[Scornubel]] and [[Triel]].

==Geography==
Face Crag was a cleft with a stream across the middle, which crossed the [[Trade Way]]. It had an eastern bed, strongly implying it was split north-south.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|186|12}} and visible from afar.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|109|7}}

==Defenses==
Decades prior to {{yearlink|1357}}, a merchant had placed several braziers around Face Crag. When lit at dark, they concealed those camping on the eastern side of the cleft from sight, making the area more defensible.

==History==
After the first murder in [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan in late {{yearlink|1357}}, he sought to make it to Face Crag, expecting attack from the locals in the Blackrocks otherwise.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|87-88|6}} He made it there before nightfall.

[[Belgon Bradaskor]], when asked by [[Sharantyr]] how to find Orthil Voldovan's caravan, was directed there.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|129|8}} She arrived there soon, but to do so, she had to ride the horse [[Flamewind]] too severely.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|149|9}} Nonetheless, the horse accompanied her there.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|183|11}}
