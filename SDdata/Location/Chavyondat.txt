Chavyondat was a port city and the capital of Estagund.  It was the largest city in that realm.
Chavyondat was formerly known as Klionna.
Situated on the protective Bay of Kings on the southern coast of Estagund, Chavyondat was the first line of defense against raiders from Dambrath.
Shou Lung was working intrigues to establish an enclave—a Shou Town—in Chavyondat in Estagund in the mid-1370s DR.
Chavyondat was guarded by a corps of skilled crossbowmen and powerful illusionists. Additionally, Chaka Seltarir supplied 10 fully-armed warships to supplement the 5 used by the city.
