        "Description": "There were no known settlements or roads in Melabrauth. Its many rivers were navigable but were infested by fierce and dangerous monsters.",
        "Inhabitants": "The only known inhabitants of Melabrauth were dragons and their [[dragonspawn]] servants. A few [[human]]s and [[dragonborn]] were allowed to live in Melabrauth, but only to serve as amusement for its dragon inhabitants.",
        "Government": "Melabrauth was ruled by [[Melauthaur]] the Undying One, a powerful [[dracolich]]. Melauthaur chose twenty dragons to be the \"overdragons\", dragon lords who ruled over their brethren and were tasked with the protection of the land. If an \"overdragon\" became reckless or ambitious, Melauthaur commanded other \"overdragons\" to kill it before that dragon could do anything. Otherwise, Melauthaur allowed his \"overdragons\" to pursue their own goals, which often included hunting humans and dragonborn for sport.\n\nAfter a dragonborn rebellion during the [[Wailing Years]], Melabrauth forbade the \"overdragons\" to have dragonborn slaves.\n\nThe [[Dusk Ports]] were a vassal state to Melabrauth.",
        "Geography": {
            "Locations": "* [[Fang (Laerakond)|The Fang]]: A tooth-like mountain near the [[Dragon Sea (Abeir)|Dragon Sea]].\n* [[River Vypaeryn]]: The most important river in Melabrauth.\n* [[Starspire]]: A lone peak amid the jungles of Melabrauth.\n* [[Djerad Kusold]]: A ruined dragonborn citadel."
        },
        "History": "During the Wailing Years, the dragonborn of Djerad Kusold took advantage of the chaos to get [[dragonbane amber]], and started a rebellion that nearly killed a quarter of the dragon population of Melabrauth before Melauthaur intervened and destroyed the dragonborn fortress.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Melauthaur]] the Undying One.\n* [[Roroaros]], a black \"overdragon\".\n* [[Naeryndroth]], another black \"overdragon\".\n* [[Sarakror]], a green \"overdragon\"."
