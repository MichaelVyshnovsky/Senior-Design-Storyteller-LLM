The town was situated near a steep waterfall of the same name.\nDagger Falls had a strong stone wall encompassing the town and whilst under the rule of Zhentil Keep boasted a garrison of 100 Zhentilar soldiers, 200 mercenaries, and roughly 130 Dalesmen reserves. Two gatehouses guarded the entrances to the town, holding 35 troops each, located by the northern forest gate and eastern river gate.\nThe site was once used as a storage site for dwarven metals mined from the Desertsmouth Mountains to the east.\nDagger Falls had long been the seat of power for Daggerdale if only by virtue of it being the largest settlement. The Morn family ruled the dale from Dagger Falls for centuries until 1336 DR when the Zhentarim agents deposed them.\nThe town was then primarily controlled by series of Zhentilar-nominated constables, who held it until Randal Morns triumphant retaking of Dagger Falls in 1369 DR.\nIn 1372, it still existed as a frontier town under the authority of Randal Morn, Lord of Daggerdale.\nConstables Tower This fortified tower served as the seat of power for the towns constable, before being afflicted by a destructive magical tempest.\nFulgaths Caravan Supplies This shop provided basic provisions and goods useful to merchants, albeit at a 200% markup. \nMarket Square This was the towns open market area. \nOld Dulwars Leatherworks This store operated as a safehouse during Randal Morns resistance and rebellion against the Zhents.  \nThunds Warehouses\nTeshford Arms This low quality inn, with exorbitant prices, was run by a matronly woman named Olavia.\nBroken Dagger The epitome of rough-and-tumble bars whose patrons were primarily Zhentish soldiers and mercenaries before the rebellion. \nRed Rock A ramshackled inn frequented by the country folk.\nLathanders Light This formerly grand temple was destroyed in a fire during the war with the Zhents and rebuilt afterwards as a testament to their determination and resiliance.\nDagger Bridge \nTethyamar Trail The southbound road that continued to Serpentsbridge and Spiderhaunt Woods. \nTesh Trail\nDagger Falls The eponymous waterfall had a sheer drop and was unnavigable by boats. \nEagles Eyrie This rocky knoll was home to altars sacred to the Clan Brightblade of Dwarves."
