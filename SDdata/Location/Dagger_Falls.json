The [[Morn]] family ruled the dale from Dagger Falls for centuries until [[1336 DR]] when the [[Zhentarim]] agents deposed them.\n\nThe town was then primarily controlled by series of Zhentilar-nominated constables, who held it until Randal Morn's triumphant retaking of Dagger Falls in [[1369 DR]].\n\nIn [[1372]], it still existed as a frontier town under the authority of [[Randal Morn]], Lord of Daggerdale.",
