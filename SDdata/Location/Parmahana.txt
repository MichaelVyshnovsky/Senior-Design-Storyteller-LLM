Parmahana was a former capital city of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra, later deserted and fallen into ruins. It stood in the eastern kingdom, among the mountains there.
As the Kuong Kingdom expanded, it relocated its capital from Suranatra for administrative purposes. Parmahana became its second capital.
However, some time in the early 8 century DR,This is "over 600 years" before a setting date of 1357 DR, so some time before 757 DR. the Kuong deserted Parmahana, leaving much behind.The reason for abandoning Parmahana is unknown. While it might be another shift for administrative ease, the description suggests a disaster of some kind. The people made an exodus through the jungle, founding a temporary capital at Beradandar, before moving on to the permanent capital at Ranguri.
By the midâ€“14 century DR, the jungle had reclaimed Parmahana, shrouding its carved stone walls and half-fallen-down buildings under thick jungle growth. Many things were abandoned there when the people left, and lay there still. The Kuong believed the city to be cursed by the gods, that it was a place of disease and decay that brough death to all who ventured within.
