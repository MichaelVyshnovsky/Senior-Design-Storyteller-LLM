'''Nedeheim''' (meaning "'''Down-home'''" in the [[Giant language]]) was an ancient kingdom of [[stone giant]]s,

==Geography==
This kingdom was located north of [[Shanatar]] and south of the [[Cloud Peaks]]. It stood beneath [[Mount Dodild]], part of the [[Giant's Run Mountains]], within a high mountain cavern that extended to a depth of {{frac|1|2}} miles. Spread out through a series of lava tubes and caves.

==Government==
Cairnheim was a monarchial kingdom, ruled by a king and his council of Dodforerir, or "Death Chiefs." Both the king and the Dodforerir were all [[cairn (giant)|cairns]], a form of [[undead]] stone giant. Each of the Dodforerir, raised from the dead by the king, had in life had served as a clan chieftain.

The government did not tolerate trespass into their land, particularly among [[dwarves]].

==History==
Being of the kingdoms that made up the ancient empire of [[Ostoria]], and stairs through its peaks, as well as tremendous halls beneath its peaks.

It was one of the giant kingdoms that warred with the ancient [[dragon]] kingdoms during the Dawn Age It eventually came into a conflict with the dwarves of [[High Shanatar]], a conflict known as the [[Giant Wars]], that listed sixty years. Finally falling in [[-5350 DR]], having lost half its population and reduced to scattered clanholds, whose remaining inhabitants fled into the [[Upperdark]]

In [[-160 DR]], a cairn by the title of [[Dodkong]] came to to the site of the fallen kingdom with the ''[[crown of Obadai]]'', the legendary crown of [[Faerûn]]'s [[Obadai|first stone giant]], and gathered its stone giants clans together, refounding the kingdom under the name of Cairnheim. 

Over time this kingdom grew slowly, until by [[1372 DR]] it had a sizeable population of 546 living within it. In addition, more than a dozen minor clanholds of stone giants and [[hill giant]]s acknowledged the Dodkong as their ruler. Several large tribes of [[hobgoblin]]s and [[orc]]s would rally around him if asked to do so. And nearby [[human]] communities offered him tribute. Around this time some communities within the Underdark began to fear that Cairnheim might be preparing themselves to expand beyond their borders,<ref>{{Cite web/More of the Underdark and the Vast}} noting a growing number of [[barrowe]]s roaming the Giants Run Mountains.
