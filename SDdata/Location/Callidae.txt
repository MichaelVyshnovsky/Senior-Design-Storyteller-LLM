'''Callidae''' was a secretive icy enclave in [[the North]] that was mainly populated by [[aevendrow]] but counted also a few [[Ulutiun]] [[human]]s, [[arctic dwarves]] called kurits, and [[orc]]s called oroks. The city counted more than 50,000 inhabitants{{Cite web/Legend of Drizzt}}

==Description==
[[File:CallidaeMap.png|thumb|right|250px|''A map of Callidae.'']]
This enclave was almost completely unknown and, as such, held multiple secrets. The city was located inside a glacier that hosted a [[primordial]] of ice.

The city had five boroughs:
* Scellobel: Considered the heart of Callidae, this was the most populous borough with around 15,000 aevendrow and half that number of non-aevendrow. It was the only borough from which it was possible to live in the glacier.
* Mona Chess: The oldest borough, the center of the political power wielded by the Temporal Convocation, the governing council. The Temporal Convocation was located inside the Siglig building.
* B'shett: A small and narrow forest from which wood was used for construction and tools.
* Ardin: Considered as a garden and the place for keeping the muskox herds.
* Cattisola: Lost for many years after being swallowed by the glacier.

The Cascatte cavern was not strictly part of the city. It housed a colony of kurits and oroks.

==History==
When the majority of [[drow]] followed [[Lolth]]'s ways and descended to the [[Underdark]], a small group instead traveled northward. They established the enclave of Callidae.

Callidae and the glacier were created when [[Qadeej]], a [[Vaati]] and one of the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]], who had chosen this place to abandon his physical form and pass on to the other side of existence. He was of the wind, of nature and balance, and had an army of cante and n'divi.

==Government==
Callidae was ruled by a Mona (an elected governor) and a Temporal Convocation (a council).

==Society==
The aevendrow and other inhabitants lived in a peaceful, joyful, and egalitarian society. As the surrounding environment was hazardous, because of [[slaadi]], [[dragon]]s, [[giant]], and just the cold climate, they trained hard for battle.

During the autumn, magic didn't work. The four boroughs held a fighting tournament between the four boroughs called the Cazzcalci that was the most important event of the year.

==Culture==
Cuisine here included [[persimmon]]s and kurit [[muskox]] [[cheese]], [[Scellobelee ice wine]], and ''[[tagliog]]'' (a steak of fatty tail).

==Religion==
The aevendrow of Callidae had a difficult relationship with [[Eilistraee]]. Though many agreed with the goodness of the goddess, they also strongly stood in opposition to her demands because Callidae was an isolated community whose most important law was that none outside of Callidae must ever know of its existence.<ref>
