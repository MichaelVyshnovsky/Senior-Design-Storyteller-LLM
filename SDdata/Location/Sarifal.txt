Sarifal was a fey kingdom located on Gwynneth Isle in the Moonshaes.  As of 1479 DR the kingdom was ruled from the city of Karador by High Lady Ordalf.
Around the time of the Spellplague High Lady Ordalf moved the city through a portal from the Feywild and it rose from the depths of Lake Myrloch.  The fey forces soon routed the High Kings troops and took control of the entire island of Gwynneth.Brian R. James"Realmslore  Sarifal" Dragon  #376. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, June, 2009.
