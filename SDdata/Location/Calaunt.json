        "mainbody": "'''Calaunt''' was a city-state in [[the Vast]], and formerly the village of '''Vespermouth'''. It sat on the mouth of of the [[River Vesper]] on the eastern side of the [[Dragon Reach]], at the end of [[Blaern's Trail]] from [[Thindilar]] and at the end of the [[Hlintar Ride]] from [[Hlintar]].",
        "Language": "The city's people spoke the [[Easting language]],{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} which was related to the [[Damaran language]].{{cite book/Player's Guide to Faerûn|15}} People and things from here were called \"Calauntan\". The terms \"Calauntian\" and \"Calaunan\" were both incorrect.",
        "History": {
            "The Time of Glorious Fools": "Originally, this was the site of the village of Vespermouth, named for its location on the mouth of the River Vesper.\n\nPrior to Calaunt's rise as a city, it was held by a band of robber-barons, who constructed the [[Fortress of the Five Vultures]], which was named for them.\n\nDuring the Vast's so-called [[the Vast#The Time of Glorious Fools|Time of Glorious Fools]] (from [[649 DR]] onwards), Calaunt was among those harbors that served as landing spots for immigrants and as rest stops for pirates. These harbors were developed as trade ports for the trading vessels came from [[Aglarond]], [[Impiltur]], [[Sembia]], and [[Westgate]]. From its beginnings, Calaunt was a free city, but equally free for criminals and a haven for the lawless.\n\nAround the 1330s [[DR]], [[Bellas's Band]], an [[adventuring company]], took over Calaunt, naming themselves [[Supreme Scepter]] and the [[Merchant Duke]]s.",
            "Modern history": ""
        },
        "Demographics": "According to the tax rolls of 1358 DR, the city had a population of 86,012 people. This could rise to ~88,600 in the summer.The 3{{rd}}-edition [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'']] saw widespread significant population reductions, though it is not clear why. The larger figure of 86,012 may refer to the population of the surrounding land that Calaunt controls, while 38,706 may only be those people within the city itself.\n\nIn 1479 DR, Calaunt had a population of around 32,000.",
        "Government & Politics": "In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Calaunt was ruled by the self-styled [[Supreme Scepter]] [[Bellas Thanatar]] and the [[Merchant Duke]]s, named [[Pirithin Alagost]], [[Iritar|Iritar the Dark]], [[Saleska Mintharl]], [[Halabankh Ormsarr]], [[Haldyn Stormkin]], and [[Alascartha Vyperwood]]. They were all former [[adventurer]]s of [[Bellas's Band]], and each of them grew increasingly wealthy and powerful by following him and supporting his rule. In all decisions on major policies, each duke had one vote while Bellas had two. Nevertheless, the Dukes wielded significant power. Under them were two barons, [[Uthorn]] and [[Wenszrin]].\n\nTheir regime was evil, oppressive, and kleptocratic. The Scepter and his Dukes often confiscated property and magic from visitors, allegedly \"for the benefit of the city\", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of [[magical item]]s this way, and still sought more. In particular, Duke Iritar slew and robbed any [[wizard]] of even middling power who stayed long in Calaunt, to secure the dukes' rule.\n\nMerchant Dukes still ruled Calaunt in 1479 DR.",
        "Relations": "Calaunt was an independent city-state, one of the five so-called \"sister cities\" of the Vast, together with [[Procampur]], [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Tantras]], and [[Tsurlagol]]. It grew from being the third largest in the Vast in the 1350s and 60s DR to being the largest and most influential among them by 1372 DR, and wealthier and more powerful than Ravens Bluff. Calaunt feared and despised Ravens Bluff, and Ravenians of any stripe were not welcome there.\n\nCalaunt competed aggressively with the neighboring town of [[Ylraphon]]. Its agents employed intimidation tactics and a few careful murders to make certain that Ylraphon could not grow to compete with Calaunt or take its trade. The town was left struggling and in decline by 1370 DR.\n\nRumors circulated that the Merchant Dukes were in league with slavers preying on the city's beggars, with [[drow]] spotted wandering the streets, and the so-called \"Calaunt gargoyles\".\n\nBy 1479 DR, Calaunt had united with Ravens Bluff and Tantras in the nation of [[Vesperin]].",
        "Law & Order": "The authorities of Calaunt were ruthless with pirates and smugglers, punishing them swiftly and without mercy—unless, of course, they'd made a deal with the local [[thieves' guild]], the [[Shadowcloaks]]. The Shadowcloaks had a tight control on all fencing and smuggling through Calaunt, and had their own lethal punishments for those who engaged in such in their territory without sanction or tithe. For these reasons, pirates rarely docked at Calaunt, let alone raided it. Those pirates who were accepted, however, traded freely with the Shadowcloaks. Pirates were more welcome in Calaunt than any other port on the Dragon Reach, and city defenders didn't care about pirates simply passing along the river. Nevertheless, some in the guard wouldn't be pleased to have killers at large in the streets, and could hire adventurers as \"special agents\" to investigate difficult issues.\n\nHowever, by 1479 DR, Calaunt had grown watchful of pirates and raiders, as it controlled trade on the River Vesper. Travelers to the city required a Writ of Trade, a legal document issued by the Merchant Dukes or by the [[Golden Lord]]s of Tantras, in order to pass without interference. Regardless, corruption remained rife, and money, influence, and blackmail could see dodgy deeds go unhindered.",
        "Defenses": "The city maintained a standing army named \"[[The Teeth of Calaunt]]\". They numbered six-thousand soldiers, twenty battle-mages, and twenty warcaptains. Each battle-mage was an [[illusionist]] and an apprentice of Duke Halabankh Ormsarr. One battle-mage served each warcaptain, who each served Barons Uthorn and Wenszrin. The Teeth were poorly trained brawlers, their captains little better, though they were well equipped. They occasionally indulged in piracy in the Dragon Reach and hunting for [[orc]]s on land.\n\nCalaunt's authorities always hired mercenary armies, known as \"lances\", to support the Teeth in times of war or orc assault. The barons commanded these units directly. The mercenaries did most of the actual fighting, while the Teeth conducted raids and ambushes and only entered the final stages of a battle to steal the victory.\n\nIt also kept a small navy of six vessels, each with a crew of seventy-three. Their purpose was mainly to guard against pirates who wished to raid Calaunt, though pirates who did not were tolerated.Despite ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'', the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting: A Grand Tour of the Realms'' (2nd edition, revised)]], and ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'' all mentioning Calaunt's six-ship navy, ''[[Pirates of the Fallen Stars]]'' says that Calaunt has no navy. It may be that these six ships are actually pirate vessels.\n\nCalaunt was ringed by city walls, topped with guard towers. The gates were additionally guarded by a force of six [[stone golem]]s, commanded by the dukes. The docks, meanwhile, were barely defended and there were no fortifications of note by the mouth of the river, as the city trusted to its deals with pirates.",
        "Economy & Trade": "Calaunt was one of the wealthiest cities in the Vast, wealthier than Ravens Bluff and second only to Procampur. It earned this position thanks to its monopoly on all legal trade in and out of the River Vesper; the Shadowcloaks' iron grip on fencing, piracy, and smuggling in the city; and ruthless competition with Ylraphon. Nevertheless, it remained a place of squalor and poverty.\n\nThe city's major industry was tanning, with several large tanneries located there. Its primary products were [[leather]] and [[vellum]], as well as wool and preserved meats, all produced from livestock taken from the surrounding farmlands.\n\nIt had its greatest trade activity in the summer months, with less in winter.",
        "Culture & Society": "Calaunt was a free city, but a haven for criminals, outcasts, and all things forgotten and forbidden. Under the oppressive rule of the Merchant Dukes, crime and corruption were rampant, and intrigue and rumor flowed. The nights were often rent by screams and battles, with bodies found on the streets come morning. The social structure at all levels was in a state of decay, and the whole city was described as evil, corrupt, tainted, and a septic wound.\n\nFolk regarded Calaunt as being thick with [[magic]], but far from the wonders of other magical cities, its magic was of a cruel and oppressive, dark and strange kind. On the one hand were the stockpiles of magical items stolen by the Merchant Dukes, and on the other was the magic used to guard the city and intimidate the people, such as the stone golems that guarded the gates. Furthermore, an undefined taint of unpleasant magic seemed to hang over the city. According to folk around the Dragon Reach, Calaunt was always a fey place, and tales held that evil magic was buried there, dormant but far from dead.\n\nThe aura of corruption, decay, and fey magic infected the Calauntan [[mage]]s too. They had a deep understanding of deceptive and corrupting magic, perhaps the best in the Realms. Their [[illusion]] and [[phantasm]] [[spell]]s were harder to resist or disbelieve, especially if cast by an [[illusionist]]. But this taint could be felt by others. Domestic animals grew skittish at the approach of a Calauntan [[wizard]], and finally cried out in alarm: [[dog]]s would bark or howl, [[horse]]s would snort or whinny, and so on. Even some human and [[humanoid]] races could feel uneasy in the presence of a Calauntan mage, and this grew more likely with the power of the mage. However, no mages of significant power operated openly in Calaunt, as it was feared that Duke Iritar the Dark robbed and murdered any who stayed there long. Among the rest, it was fashionable to advertise what little power they had, with glowing [[gem]]s and similar jewelry.\n\nTo survive the dark streets, crime, and urban decay of their city, even Calauntan warriors had a knack for moving stealthily and lurking in the shadows. However, they carried the notoriety of Calaunt with them, and outsiders thought less of them for it.\n\nThe city was also home to sizeable populations of [[dwarves]] and [[half-elves]]. They had an energetic but usually good-natured rivalry in both trade and social matters.\n\nDespite the poverty and slums, Calaunt had surprisingly few beggars. This was attributed by some to tales of monsters hunting the streets, or [[slavery|slavers]] conducting nighttime raids.\n\nFew people from outside Calaunt actually liked the city, though many had to visit on some business matter. Visitors were wise to be careful and avoid flashing around money or magic. This was largely due to the Supreme Scepter and the Merchant Dukes' habit of confiscating magic for their own use. Most country folk of the Vast thought of Calaunt as outright evil, filled with thieves and ruled by arrogant fools. They had sayings for anyone behaving arrogantly, foolishly, recklessly, calling them a \"Calaunt-head\" or telling them to \"go back to Calaunt\".",

        },
        "Organizations": "Calaunt was dominated by the [[Shadowcloaks]], a vast and mysterious thieves guild known for the baggy gray cloaks they wore, and led by the unidentified [[Night Hood]]. They had a ruthlessly enforced monopoly on all fencing, piracy, and smuggling in the city, and many Calauntans believed they worked closely with the ruling Merchant Dukes, either working for them directly or in alliance.\n\nA [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell serving the [[black dragon]] [[Throstulgrael|Velvet]] of the [[Flooded Forest]] was thought to be based near either Calaunt or the town of [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]].",
        "Legends & Rumors": "Tales from around the Dragon Reach claimed that evil magic slept in Calaunt, and that it slept only lightly, making the city a strange, fell place.\n\nLocal urban legends told of monstrous creatures lurking in the city, either in the sewers or in the River Vesper. One legend went that someone in the city kept captive a gigantic, flesh-eating lizard, larger than two bulls, hiding it in a cellar or cesspool by day and releasing it on dark nights to wander the streets and devour all it caught. Proponents of the legend pointed to the surprisingly low number of beggars in the city, as well as the huge bite-marks on the severed forelegs of [[horse]]s found in the gutters some mornings, and occasional sightings of [[shark]]-like or [[bulette]]-like fins plowing through the river muck.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Inner Sea pirates, creatures that lurked in the Vesper could curse a sailor who crossed them with bad luck.\n\nThe city was also apparently home to the mysterious \"Calaunt gargoyles\". These creatures resembled [[gargoyle]]s with fangs and wings, but were bigger, faster, smarter, even more dangerous, and had the ability to [[teleport]] from here to there as they pleased. These creatures attacked adventurers guarding Tantran merchants' property in 1370 DR, but avoided Calauntans. This suggested that the Merchant Dukes either controlled the creatures or had some deal with them.\n\nAnother explanation for the low beggar population was the slavers rumored to raid the city in the dark of night. It was said that the slavers dealt with the Merchant Dukes, and that those kidnapped disappeared into crowded slave ships were carried over the Inner Sea to [[Westgate]] or the [[Vilhon Reach]].\n\nIn [[1367 DR]], there were sightings of [[drow]] on the streets in the nighttime. There were rumors that the Merchants Dukes were in league with them too.\n\nFinally, legend had it that in forgotten locations in the city were valuable dwarven treasures. These supposedly dated back to the time of the dwarf kingdom of [[Roldilar]], but remained undiscovered by 1358 DR."
