The humans above cooperated with the dwarves to handle the mining, move the ore to market, and defend the city against magical threats. Mirabar was ruled by a hereditary [[marchion]], but the true power was in an elected assembly called the [[Council of Sparkling Stones]], a mixed dwarven and human group that met once a year to determine production quotas and whether or not to threaten current clients with reduced output. It was led by the dwarven [[cleric]] of [[Dumathoin]], [[Agrathan Hardhammer]]. Mirabar also had an elected sceptrana,",

There was virtually no crime, and the city utilized professional thief trackers, the \"[[Shadow District]]\", to monitor any potential criminals.\n\nMaking maps of the city was illegal for security purposes, because the city was concerned about intelligence getting into the hands of Mirabar's enemies, especially [[Luskan]].
