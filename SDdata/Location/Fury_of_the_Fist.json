        "Description": "The statue was in the [[Lower City]], outside the [[Seatower of Balduran]] and prior to crossing the bridge.",
        "History": "In [[1482 DR]], the hand of this statue, as well as others, was stolen by agents of [[the Guild]]. The youths of the [[Ravenshade]], [[Oberon (family)|Oberon]], [[Durinbold]] families and potentially others carried out the same act to the [[Beloved Ranger]]. All but those of the [[Outer City]] were angered, and the [[Flaming Fist]] conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up. [[Horgold Hadru]] took in the noble youths who had vandalised the statue of [[Minsc]] and [[Boo]], as he owed the Durinbold patriar family a favor."
