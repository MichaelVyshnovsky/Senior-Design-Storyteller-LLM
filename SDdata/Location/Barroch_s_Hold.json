        "mainbody": "Barrochs Hold was a citadel located on the Glacier of the White Worm in the Earthspur Mountains, and once the fabled lair of Barroch, the first great bandit lord of the Inner Sea.\nIn the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR, a band of adventurers rediscovered Barrochs Hold but soon ran into a number of strange creatures, and were separated or killed. Two of them survived—Yostur Ulhmond and Feenoch the Five-Fingered—and made it to Orm to tell their story, though they would not be drawn on the matter of treasure. By the end of the year, it was said in Hillsfar they were trying to muster a larger group of adventurers, bearing sledges, perhaps intending to return."
