        "Description": "Nestled in the [[Gulf of Mi]], Okaroshima showcased extraordinary erosion caused by the relentless ocean. Its coastline was adorned with caverns carved into the rock, while awe-inspiring blowholes unleashed towering spouts of saltwater during high tides and storms. Standing proudly in splendid isolation from the bustling fishing villages on the sheltered northeastern shore was a shrine dedicated to the revered [[Lord of the Sea]].\n\nThe shrine on Okaroshima held deep sanctity for sailors, fishermen, [[sea spirit folk]], and all who shared a profound connection with the sea. The sect responsible for its care also maintained a nearby monastery and pilgrim hospices. Each year, a ceremony occurred at this shrine, offering tribute to the Lord of the Sea. Such is the grandeur of this event that even the emperor himself graced it with his presence during the autumn season.\n\nFor those seeking to establish contact with the Lord of the Sea or embark upon a journey to explore his kingdom, undertaking a pilgrimage to the shrine at Okaroshima was deemed essential. Furthermore, the island served as an excellent starting point for underwater expeditions of a similar nature."
