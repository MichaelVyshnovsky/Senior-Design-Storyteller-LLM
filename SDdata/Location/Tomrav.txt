Tomrav was a small mining settlement found high in the Earthspur Mountains in southern Arcata.
Tomrav was able to survive by getting along with their neighbors, including monks from the Monastery of the Yellow Rose as well as various goblinoid tribes.
Humans, dwarves, and half-orcs made up most of the population of Tomrav. The resident half-orcs helped maintain positive relations with the local goblinoid tribes.
