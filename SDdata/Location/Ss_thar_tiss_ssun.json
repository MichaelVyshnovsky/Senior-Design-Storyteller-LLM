        "mainbody": "Ssthartissssun, or the City of Fountains, was once a sarrukh realm and later the capital city of the ancient serpent empire known as Najara.\nIts breadth once extended at least as far as Serpents Cowl, on the western edge of the Forest of Wyrms the villagers there avoid digging cellars for fear of falling into the buried ruins of the city. A network of tunnels still connected Ssthartissssun with Sszuraassnee and to caverns beneath Mount Hlim at the southern edge of the Greypeak Mountains.\nThe original City of Fountains was founded during the Days of Thunder, around , by a powerful creator race called the sarrukh. It was built as a temple-city by the cult of Ssharstrune, but was abandoned after their gods apparent death.\nIn a bygone age, the slithering ophidians from the High Moor and Serpent Hills migrated to the Forest of Wyrms. \nIn the Year of Netted Dreams, âˆ’320 DR, yuan-ti members of House Hsstafi were magically summoned from the northwestern shores of the Lapal Sea and transported here. They thrived as nobles of Najara, primarily acting as administrators, merchants, and religious leaders.\nWhen the city fell to the Shadowking of Ebenfar in the , Najara fell with it. Terpenzi was slain, Serpentfolk who survived fled to the Serpent Hills, and wards were placed by agents of the Shadowking in order to keep all serpentfolk out. It would eventually be built over, albeit partly, by the villagers of Serpents Cowl.\nNevertheless, House Hsstafi survived the fall of Najara and continued Terpenzis legacy through his descendants, the dark naga. One of their works included converting the original temple to the Shrine of Cowled Serpents. This underground shrine contained the legendary Naja Fountain, which was the home of Terpenzi after his conversion.\nThe serpentfolk succeeded in penetrating the wards to the old city in the . Ssthartissssun was carefully re-explored by wizards of the Coiled Cabal from the neighboring city of Sskowlynraa, the City of Spellskins.\nEven centuries after its initial destruction, Ebarnaje, a later King of Najara, sought to capture the city and reclaim it as a capitol.\nThe ruins of Ssthartissssun were occupied from different kinds of undead and construct guardians left to their own devices, as well as successful species brought over by the different occupations of serpentfolk. Sword spiders and ti-khana (hybridized) dinosaurs made their nests here, and undead bone nagas guarded treasures from every era of the city.\nThe Naja Fountain was said to improve the arcane magic of any who bathed in it, and its waters had healing properties. With Terpenzis death, the shrine was left unattended."
