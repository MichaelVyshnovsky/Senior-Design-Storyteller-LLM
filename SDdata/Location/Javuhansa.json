However, it is known to be on the headwaters (source) of the Kunong River, which, based on descriptions, is most likely the river from the central hill country and joining the [[Fenghsintzu River]]. It stood at the northern end of the [[Trade road (Kuong Kingdom)|trade road]] to the south, which passed through [[Enlasre]] south of Javuhansa.",
        "Trade": "[[Gold]] and [[ivory]] collected in the southern jungles were carried north via caravan to Javuhansa in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. These goods were sold in its open markets.\n\nMore notably, Javuhansa was the best place to get imported [[herb]]s, [[spices]], and [[:Category:Medicines|medicinal plants]] in all of [[Malatra]]. These were expensive and often rare, even magical."
