The Quoya Desert was a large arid region found between the Hordelands and Shou Lung.
The Quoya was bordered on its eastern edge by the fabled Dragonwall, effectively separating it from Shou Lung. In the west the vast Plain of Horses and nation of Ya√Ømmunahar stretched for as far as the eye could see. Mountains penned the desert from both the north and south, with the Chigidi Range of the Koryaz Mountains framing the desert from the north, while the northern arm of the impressive Katakoro Shan covering the deserts southern edge.
The Quoya was a cold, arid place. Despite this fact, enough water from small streams flowed through the desert into the Merket Depression to sustain the growth of the famous Kwachow melons.
