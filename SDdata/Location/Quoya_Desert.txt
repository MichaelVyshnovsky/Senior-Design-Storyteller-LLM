The '''Quoya Desert''' was a large arid region found between the [[Hordelands]] and [[Shou Lung]].

==Geography==
The Quoya was bordered on its eastern edge by the fabled [[Dragonwall]], effectively separating it from Shou Lung. In the west the vast [[Plain of Horses]] and nation of [[Ya√Ømmunahar]] stretched for as far as the eye could see. Mountains penned the desert from both the north and south, with the [[Chigidi Range]] of the [[Koryaz Mountains]] framing the desert from the north, while the northern arm of the impressive [[Katakoro Shan]] covering the desert's southern edge.

==Description==
The Quoya was a cold, arid place. Despite this fact, enough water from small streams flowed through the desert into the [[Merket Oasis|Merket Depression]] to sustain the growth of the famous [[Kwachow|Kwachow melons]].

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Spice Road]]
* The Merket Depression
* [[Horseshoe Temple Oasis]]
* [[Bitter Well Oasis]]
* [[Ansi]]
* [[Kwachow]]
* [[Chegoyui]]

==Climate==
The Quoya was seen as a land where temperatures operated in extremes and rainfall was very light.
