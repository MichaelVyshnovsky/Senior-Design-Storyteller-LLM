Noanars Hold was a village, just off the Evermoor Way just on the edge of the High Forest, that grew up around one of the most famous hunting lodges in the North. Cottages and well-kept stables rambled between the trees.
The Hunt Lords ruled the settlement and arranged hunting parties for rich sportsmen of the Sword Coast.
Eventually, less and less people came, as rumors got out that the Hunt Lords encouraged their guests to kill one another. In their old age, the Hunt lords struck a deal with Orcus, who transformed them into wights, and their long-dead steeds into warhorse skeletons.
Noanars Hold was named after a famous hunter who once lived in the village keep.
The villages hunts could involve anything from pursuing normal creatures to sentient beasts and humanoids that were less than willing participants.
