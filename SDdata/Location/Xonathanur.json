        "Notable Locations": "Xonathanur's holdings were far reaching. They included [[Mardaruk]], a community in the [[Lowerdark]] that mined high-quality [[adamantine]] ores.",
        "History": "Xonathanur, like its contemporaries [[Oghrann]] and [[Gharraghaur]], stood firm in the millennia before [[Dalereckoning]]. They were considered to be examples to the other, less civilized races of Faerûn in how to hold and wield power. They distrusted [[magic]] so, while they never rose to the heights of arcane power like [[Netheril]] and [[Imaskar]], they never suffered the catastrophes they did either.\n\nUltimately, however, endless [[Goblin Wars (disambiguation)|goblin wars]] led to Xonathanur's downfall. Those few shield dwarves who remained lived as Wanderers, rootless nomads of the dwarves. Many of ventured into the World Above and never returned.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a shield dwarven enclave in the [[Western Heartlands]], inhabited by descendants of Xonathanur, found its [[mithral]] and [[silver]] mines running out. They desperately sought a replacement for their ailing mining industry to prevent their people moving away and again being scattered. A dwarf [[bard]] proposed they reclaim the Lost Mines of Mardaruk, their birthright. After much research and exploratory searching, they uncovered a non-yet-collapsed section and dispatched a mining expedition, by means of a limited-use two-way ''[[portal]]''."
