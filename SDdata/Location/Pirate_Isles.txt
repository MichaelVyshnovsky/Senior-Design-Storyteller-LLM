The '''Pirate Isles''' were a collection of rocky islands that dotted the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and were inhabited by pirates. There were fifteen named islands but around sixty in total. The islands that comprised [[Prespur]] were not included in the Pirate Isles, despite their proximity.

==Geography==
The general makeup of the islands was mountainous terrain with high rocky cliffs. This meant that there were not a lot of ports in the Pirate Isles.

As of [[1479 DR]], due to the continued shrinking of the Sea of Fallen Stars in the century after the [[Spellplague]], most of the Pirate Isles had become a single large island named Pirate Isle.
