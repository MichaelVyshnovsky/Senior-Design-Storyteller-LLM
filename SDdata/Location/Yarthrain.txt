Yarthrain was a small village found in the Backlands region of the Western Heartlands. It was named after a traitorous wizard that was featured in ballad from the southern realm of Amn.
The center of the village comprised a handful of great stone houses that surrounded a ruined stone castle.

The folks of Yarthrain provided for themselves by growing crops, herding sheep and cows, and fishing from the Winding Water.
