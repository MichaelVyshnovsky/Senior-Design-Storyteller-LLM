'''Yarthrain''' was a small village found in the [[Backlands]] region of the [[Western Heartlands]]. It was named after a traitorous [[wizard]] that was featured in ballad from the southern realm of [[Amn]].

==Description==
The center of the village comprised a handful of great stone houses that surrounded a ruined stone castle.

==Geography==
It was situated on the southern back of the [[Winding Water]], upstream from [[Boareskyr Bridge]], northeast of the [[Forest of Wyrms]].

==Trade==
The folks of Yarthrain provided for themselves by growing crops, herding [[sheep]] and [[cow]]s, and fishing from the Winding Water.

==History==
Yarthrain was founded  in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]], by the [[Amn]]ian mercenary [[Zelarravyan Fangshield]].

While the baron proved ill-prepared for rulership,

Yarthrain remained in a half-destroyed state in the Backlands for decades, well into the midâ€“14{{th}} century.

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors of [[Zhentarim]] control over the small village circulated across the region ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.

==Notable Locations==
* Backlands Castle, the ruined stone keep around which the town was built.
* Black Buck Inn, one of Yarthrain's local inns.<ref name=NS-p254" />
* [[Silver Blade]], a quality inn/tavern that was constructed from stones taken from Backlands Castle.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Horace (Yarthrain)|Horace]], the town's cooper and a local contact of the Zhentarim.<ref name=NS-p254">
