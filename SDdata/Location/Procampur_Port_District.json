        "mainbody": "The '''Port District''' was a district of the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]], comprising the harbor and entry gates. It was officially outside the city proper and outside the [[Thultyrl]]'s influence and laws.{{Cite document/Procampur City Expansion Packet|1,3-4}}",
        "Description": "Lying at the western end of the [[Great Way]], beyond two huge towers, the Port District faced onto the [[Dragon Reach]]. Regardless, the port area was hemmed in by two stub walls leading off the main city walls that curved to meet the shore in a rough crescent. and another onto the Great Way and the main part of the city.\n\nBeing outside the city's laws, the buildings here kept to no particular purpose, style, size, or roof color, unlike the other districts that were reserved for specific activities. It contained places that could not or would not fit into the other districts, being home to warehouses, fisherfolk, and ship-builders that needed to be nearer the sea, as well as stables and facilities for training and caring for mounts and livestock that didn't belong to Procampan authorities. There were also cheaper inns and taverns that catered to travelers, as well as a number of small \"bed-and-beer\" houses that huddled around them. It could be a crowded and dank place, and in parts disreputable.\n\nThe docks comprised eleven piers. There were also two drydocks.",
        "Activities": "Contrasting with the order and duty of the other districts, the Port District was a relatively chaotic and dangerous place{{Cite organized play/LC/A Vial Secret|3}} Although it operated fairly normally in the daytime, after night fell it became a rowdy area where the young and daring ventured out and dangerous folk prowled with cocky attitudes, ready weapons, and a need to show off. It was also commonly where one would hire [[prostitution|coin-lads and coin-lasses]] to spend an evening with. Beggars were also present, as begging was banned elsewhere in the city.{{Cite document/Procampur City Expansion Packet|2}} The Port District was said to be a place where something was always going on.\n\nVisitors, citizens, and foreign traders here could come and go freely and act as they liked, within reason.{{Cite document/Procampur City Expansion Packet|16}} To those who entered, the gate guards of the Diamond Legion would explain the city's rules and laws to all who asked, and did so readily and patiently.\n\nNaturally, the Port District was the hub of Procampur's trade with cities in other lands. With frequent trade in and out of Procampur, the eleven piers were constantly in use all year round. Shipbuilding was also a significant business here, so the drydocks were also always in operation; ''circa'' [[1370 DR]], a new ship for the [[Ravens Bluff]] navy was under construction.",
        "Law & Order": "Procampur's [[Diamond Legion]] kept the peace here as they did elsewhere in the city but usually only showed up after a fight was over and usually arrested both parties regardless.{{Cite document/Procampur City Expansion Packet|13}}\n\nHowever, corporal punishments and executions were also carried out here, at The Way's End.",
        "History": "On [[Uktar 17]], the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, a [[Sel√ªnite]] priestess visiting from [[Ravens Bluff]] named [[Justina Palfry]] was murdered in the Port District. Local rumor claimed this was committed by a supposed serial killer dubbed the [[Portside Mangler]] thought to be responsible for the recent deaths of a former barmaid and a dancing girl in the district. However, the [[Proctors]] declared there were no links between the murders. In fact, the [[Sharran]] priestess [[Inosencia Cielian]] was later found to have murdered Justina solely to become a [[Dark Justiciars|Dark Justicar]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Friendly Suggestion|21,23,36,40}} \n\nLater, Lady [[Constantine Grimm]] was also murdered in the Port District, her body discovered in an alley by a passing [[bard]] who quickly alerted local people. A crowd of onlookers gathered that had to be dispersed by the [[Diamond Legion]] so the Proctors could investigate.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Grimm Determination|3-6}}",
