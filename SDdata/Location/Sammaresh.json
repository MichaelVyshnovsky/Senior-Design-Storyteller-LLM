        "mainbody": "ammaresh, known as the City of Dancing Dolphins, was a city in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR.\nIt stood at the western end of the Lapal Way, and marked the westernmost settlement of Lapaliiya. It was huddled between three low hills that gave out onto a wide sandy beach at the eastern side of the Dolphingulf,\nSammaresh was home to 21,912 people in 1373 DR.\nThe people made their living off the sea, by fishing and collecting emerald oysters for their rare and valuable pearls. As the bay was so shallow, the citys docks stretched almost half a mile (800 meters) out to sea, where the water was sufficiently deep for a ships draft. Aquatic elves living among the undersea hills in the bay also often went to the markets of Sammaresh to trade rare treasures of the sea.\nThe ruler of Sammaresh sat upon the Mantimera Throne (named for the mantimera). Circa 1373 DR, the city was ruled by Lady Ilnara Mremman.\nThe rulers were traditionally advised by the Whispering Serpent, thought to be the ghost of a couatl.\nThe civic deity of Sammaresh was Selûne the Moonmaiden. The people regularly made pilgrimages to the Abbey of Tharynd, just over the border in the Tashalar."
