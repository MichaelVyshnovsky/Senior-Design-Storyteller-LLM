        "mainbody": "The '''Western Emirate of Amin''' was a territory of the [[Shoon Imperium]] that preceded the foundation of the independent kingdom of [[Amn]].",
        "Geography": "The Emirate encompassed the urbanized cities along the coast between the [[Forest of Tethir]] and the [[Cloud Peaks]], including the major cities of [[Athkatla]], [[Murann]], and [[Crimmor]].",
        "History": "Amin came about with the settlement of the coast by the [[Shoon Imperium]] and the construction of the cities there, becoming part of the greater [[Calishar Emirates]]. The three largest cities built were [[Athkatla]] in [[100 DR]], [[Crimmor]] in [[163 DR]], and [[Murann]] in [[212 DR]], with the smaller [[Trademeet]] in [[223 DR]].\n\nFollowing the internal collapse of the Shoon Imperium in [[450 DR]], the Amin-born general [[Esmel Torlath]] took control of the Emirate and declared himself the first king of Amn in [[460 DR]]. He took the city-states of Athkatla, Murann and Crimmor and formed them into his realm, then began a program of eastern expansion and settlement."
