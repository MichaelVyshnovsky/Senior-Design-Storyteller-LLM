        "mainbody": "Bloomridge was a wealthy district within the Lower City of Baldurs Gate located on the western half of Gray Harbor south of the Old Wall. It was home to the wealthier citizens of the Lower City, the merchants, landowners and sea captains who sought a lifestyle that more closely resembled that of the wealthy patriar of the Upper City.\nBy great feats of engineering, both structural and arcane, Bloomridge was partially built into the Old Wall that separated the Upper and Lower Cities.\nThe district was highlighted by the grand manor-houses that, on occasion, took up entire city blocks of Bloomridge. Between these palatial estates were cafes, restaurants and boutique shops that were connected by a series of open-air sweeping staircases that descended to street level. Hanging gardens, open galleries and rooftop terraces served to beautify the streets of Bloomridge even further.\nMany of the buildings in Bloomridge featured ground-level businesses with upper-story apartment complexes, many of which offered great views over the bay. By the late 15 century DR there was little available housing and those that were open for rent were exceedingly expensive.\nAs of 1492 DR The Guild Kingpin of Bloomridge was Goblin Behnie, whose gang provided a source for forged Watch tokens, visitor licenses, and docking permits.Adam Lee, Christopher Perkins (September 17, 2019). Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus.
