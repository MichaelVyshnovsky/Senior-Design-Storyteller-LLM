The Heart of the Harbor was the largest pier found in Harrowdale.
The main body of the Heart of the Harbor ran parallel to the shoreline and was connected to the town via three roads including Dendever Street and Moonside Lane. The pier ran roughly a hundred yards in length and, in addition to docking ships, was large enough to support five separate buildings including the notorious Fouled Line.
