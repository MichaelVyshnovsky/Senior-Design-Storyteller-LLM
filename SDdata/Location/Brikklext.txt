Brikklext was a hamlet located in the Upperdark under the southern foothills of the Earthspur Mountains , between Impiltur and the Vast.
This hamlet, unlike other goblin communities, was somewhat civilized. The tribe was ruled by a mixed council of blues (psionic goblins) and bugbears, and together they managed to force the goblins out of their usual squalor and lack of perspective, guiding them into a more cohesive society.
The peculiarity of Brikklext was its underground water reservoir. Under the blues direction, the goblins diverted a spring that once brought water to the surface. By digging and dam building, they redirected its waters to flood their own underground caves, creating a vast reservoir of clean drinking water.
When their spring dried up, the surface people had to accept trade with the goblins, who began appearing everyday with loads of water casks for sale.
The goblin "citizens" of Brikklext accepted civilization slowly. The idea of codified laws and a trade system was strange to them, though some understood the benefits.
