        "mainbody": "Tibor Westers loggers camp, simply referred to as the loggers camp by folk in Phandalin, was a woodcutting operation in Neverwinter Wood operated by the craven businessman Tibor Wester.\nThe camp sat on a sandy beach along the southern bank of the Neverwinter River. As of the late 15 century DR, the camp was comprised of only two permanent structures a wooden building that served as an office and tool storage, and a  dock where barges and rowboats were moored. Two circles of tents sat on the eastern edge of the camp, each with its own firepit. The remains of two cabins which had been torn down sat to the west with a third ruined cabin&mdashwith its stone chimney still intact&mdashsitting in the middle of the camp itself.\nThe camp was located in the Woods about  upstream of Neverwinter and  north of Phandalin.\nThe camp was one of many logging sites involved in supplying lumber to the city of Neverwinter as it was rebuilding itself in the decades following Mount Hotenows eruption in the 15 century DR. As trees were felled, logs were amassed on the beach and then loaded onto barges for transport downriver. While the lumber was sold in Neverwinter, the camp avoided buying supplies in the city in order to avoid the \"devastation tax\" charged by Neverwinter. Instead, the camps inhabitants fished in the river and imported ale, oil, and additional food from Phandalin.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the camp was owned and operated by Tibor Wester, the half-brother of Phandalins townmaster, Harbin Wester. In order to help Tibor avoid Neverwinters high taxes, Harbin would arrange for guarded shipments of supplies to be sent to the camp from Barthens Provisions in Phandalin every two months.\nWith the arrival of the white dragon Cryovain in the region, unrest that began with orcs in the Sword Mountains echoed its way to the loggers camp when a group of half-orc spellcasters known as anchorites of Talos determined the camp to be infringing on their territory, and so set in motion a plan to destroy it. They used sticks and hair to craft crude effigies representing each of the camps inhabitants, inscribed them with the symbol of their god Talos, dipped them in pig blood, and then buried them in the chimney of a ruined cabin at the campsite. These effigies drew bad luck to the camp, and soon a pack of ankhegs arrived. They erupted from the sandy beach on which the loggers tents were pitched, spraying the loggers with acid and swiftly killing all of them before dragging their bodies below ground. Only Tibor himself survived as he was in his office where he barricaded the door and cowered in fear as he waited for rescue. The anchorites themselves saw no further need to be involved, and merely left one of their number&mdashDrethna&mdashto keep an eye on the camp in case any reinforcements arrived.\nAt the camps height, Tibor had twelve expert loggers working at the site, each with their own tent complete with a bedroll and mess kit."
