The Neck was a mountain pass in the Cloud Peaks of Amn.
The Neck was far east of Fang Pass, the route that the Trade Way took through the Fangs. It followed the valley of the Amnurflow from Lake Weng into the mountains, passing near the fortress of Citadel Amnur and beneath Scarsiirs Crag. It emerged on the northern side of the Cloud Peaks, distantly east of Nashkel and the Uldoon Trail.
