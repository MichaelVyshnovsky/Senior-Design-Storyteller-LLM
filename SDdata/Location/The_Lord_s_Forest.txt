}}The '''Lord's Forest''' was a small woodland found next to [[Aithelar]] in the kingdom of [[Callidyrr]] on [[Alaron]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Geography==
The Lord's Forest was located just south of Aithelar along the coast in between the town and [[Aithelar Keep]]. The forest was separated from the larger [[Dernall Forest]] by a trail.
