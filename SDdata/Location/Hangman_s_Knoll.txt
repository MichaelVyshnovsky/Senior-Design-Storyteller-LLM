'''Hangman's Knoll''' was a small rise where the road from [[Mirrorman's Mill]] connected to the [[North Ride]] in [[Shadowdale]]. 

==History==
Hangman's Knoll took its name from the days of Lord [[Joadath]], who commissioned gallows here to execute "thieves, highwaymen, and petty followers of all gods."

During the [[Zhent]] occupation in [[Hammer]], [[1375 DR]], the [[Black Network]] built new gallows upon Hangman's Knoll to execute traitors convicted in [[Mourngrym Amcathra]]'s court.
