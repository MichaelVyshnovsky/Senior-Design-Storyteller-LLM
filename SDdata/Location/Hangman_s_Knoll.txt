Hangmans Knoll was a small rise where the road from Mirrormans Mill connected to the North Ride in Shadowdale. 
Hangmans Knoll took its name from the days of Lord Joadath, who commissioned gallows here to execute "thieves, highwaymen, and petty followers of all gods."
During the Zhent occupation in Hammer, 1375 DR, the Black Network built new gallows upon Hangmans Knoll to execute traitors convicted in Mourngrym Amcathras court.
