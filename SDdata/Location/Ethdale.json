        "mainbody": "-edition source shows the River Eth north of the River Flam whereas the 3-edition source has it to the south.\nEthdale was a town near the mouth of the River Eth where it emptied into the Easting Reach in northeast Faer√ªn, circa the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR.\nEthdale was likely part of Thesk because it was south of Nyth, a small city in Thesk, but it was north of the River Flam, which was the unofficial boundary between the Great Dale and Thesk in the Forest of Lethyr. (See Gallery.)\nAround the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, the population of Ethdale was mostly halflings and humans coexisting, with the halflings somewhat more prominent."
