It was a days ride away from the southwestern edge of the Sword.\nThis village was once founded and inhabited by a Bedine tribe named the Goldor. \nFrom then on, Zhent caravans in Anauroch would often try to find their way to this village when they ran into trouble.\nEventually, after many years, once the Black Road was completed the Zhentarim abandoned this village.\nthumb|273px|The undead of the Goldor tribe stand vigilant in defending Lundeth.\nAround the 1360s DR, the inhabitants of this village were made up of members of the Zhentarim and the undead remains of the Goldor tribe. The latter numbered around twenty minor magelings and underpriests.\nAfter the construction of the Black Road was finished, the Zhentarim members stationed in Lundeth left. All that remained within the village were those undead remnants of the Goldor."
