        "Description": "When [[Naeryndam Alastrarra]] accompanied [[Elminster Aumar]] before the [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], they materialized by a large, winged statue of a panther, which glowed blue. Two moss paths joined by it. [[Will o' wisp]]s danced above, some luminous night-flowers grew around the garden, and faint, harping sounds could be heard all across. One of the mossy paths went past small streams and pools, into small bowers with curved seats between shrubs, finally up into some steps between two spiral-barked trees towards a patio. The patio was broad, paved, and lit by more luminous plants.",
        "Defenses": "At least one [[watchnorn]], [[Braerindra Calauth]], dwelt there as a protector.",
