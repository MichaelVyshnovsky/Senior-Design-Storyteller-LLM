Brynnlaw was an island located on the Sea of Swords.
Brynnlaw was once an island town which survived off of fish, as well as other produce. The Spellhold asylum was built nearby, and offered jobs to the denizens. The pirate lord, Desharik, had lost a naval battle against another pirate king. He was forced to this island and his ships invaded the town.
Deshariks pirates took the homes of the people, killed their mayor, and forced them onto the streets. To the town folks dismay, they dumped their mayors corpse into the sea. The evicted townspeople begged the asylum for shelter, but the wizards locked the doors shut. From here on, Desharik took control of the island, forcing many natives into prostitution, or to the grave.
The nearby asylum belonging to the Cowled Wizards was attacked by Jon Irenicus in 1368 DR. Gorions Ward and his companions traveled on the Galante to Brynnlaw, in order to try and save his fellow Bhaalspawn, Imoen.
The island of Brynnlaw held a few places of interest. It had a fairly large dock, where a few large ships, and multiple smaller boats could dock. 
Many homes were dotted around the island, as well as a temple to Umberlee and a tavern, the Vulgar Monkey. Other notable locations were Lady Galvenas Festhall and the lair of the pirate king.
The island was mainly occupied by sailors and courtesans, along with the Cowled Wizards. The pirates of Brynnlaw were often hostile, and would duel other inhabitants, or outright attack newcomers.
