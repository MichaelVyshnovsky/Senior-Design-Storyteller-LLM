        "mainbody": "Shepherdston was a small village of shepherds and dairy farmers in southern Amn.\nThe village was about halfway between Esmeltaran and Imnescar along the Imnescourse Trail, solidly in the Dauntir region.\nSherpherdston was formerly an important caravan stop on the road between Esmeltaran and Murann, but that faded when the realms capital moved to Athkatla. It became a surprisingly common place in the 14 century DR for Tethyrian nobles to hide out during the civil wars of the country, though the noble exiles never stayed for long as they feared that they would be pursued and found at Shepherdston, though it never actually happened. It was common hearsay in the village that the nobles had hidden their caches of treasure in the nearby Umar Hills, with few of them returning to collect the goods."
