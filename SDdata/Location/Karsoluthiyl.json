        "mainbody": "'''Karsoluthiyl''' was a [[drow]] city located beneath the [[Trackless Sea]], west of the mouth of the [[River Chionthar]].\n\nTwo prominant houses were [[House Tanor'Thal]] and [[House Lysaen]]. Both houses were big players in the slave trade of [[Skullport]].",
        "Geography": "Karsoluthiyl is located in a region of the [[Underdark]] known as the Swordsea Depths, which lies underneath the [[Sword Coast]]. They are engaged in a struggle for supremacy with [[Aboleths]], [[Svirfneblin]], and [[Thaalud]] who also call the area home.<ref>[[Eric L. Boyd]] (June 2005). [[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]. ([[Wizards of the Coast]]) p. 57. [[ISBN 0-7869-3693-2]].\n\nIt is connected by long and arduous tunnel routes to [[Undermountain]] to the north, [[Sshamath]] to the east, and the realms of Deep [[Shanatar]] to the south.[[Eric L.

        "History": "Although some claim that Karsoluthiyl was founded by House Tanor'Thal in −105 DR, the Year of the Bloody GoadJoseph Wolf (1999). ''Skullport''. (Wizards of the Coast) p. 6.

They proceeded to re-purpose the dwarven halls to their own needs, building up the outpost of Kyorlamshin, and even building a barracks and martial academy, the Citadel, and the Crystal Labyrinth. Their success was only to be short lived as [[Halaster]]'s arrival in the Undermountain  precipitated Halaster's Hunts which started in 171 DR and ended with the Drow withdrawing completely from the Undermountain by the Year of the Ecstatic Priest, 493 DR. During this time many Drow were also captured and twisted by Halaster's apprentice [[Muria]]l into \"Murial's Creations\".\n\nA series of Drow raids occured along the Sword Coast and resulted in the destruction of the small kingdoms of Harpshield and Talmost.<ref>Eric L. Boyd (2006). City of Splendors Web Enhancement. (Wizards of the Coast). p. 5. http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060503a The Drow were unidentified, but given the location it seems reasonable to suspect Karsoluthiyl. Drow in the area also attempted to excavate the [[Netherese]] ruins of Philock.<ref>Bruce R. Cordell, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Jeff Quick (2003). Underdark. (Wizards of the Coast) p. 185. ISBN 620-88581-001-EN. Philock lies in the tunnels between Karsoluthiyl and Sshamath. In 1136 DR the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] returned from the Plane of Shadow to the Prime Material Plane and established a fosterage in Karsoluthiyl among other cities.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}} This fosterage went under the guise of the wealthy merchant House Oussghym. At least two centuries later the house was led by Patron Father [[Quildan Oussghym]], and had developed a rivalry with House Lysaen.<ref>Eric L. Boyd (2007-04-25). [[City of Wyrmshadows]] (Zipped PDF) p. 12. Retrieved on 2017-01-28. Karsoluthiyl was one of the cities in which the Jaezred Chaulssin were able to weaken the power of the matriarchy during the [[Silence of Lolth]].\n\nAt some point the Drow re-established links with the Undermountain, being heavily involved in the slave trade in Skullport, as well as competing with [[Duergar]] to sell Deep Rothé meat and hides.Joseph Wolf (1999) Skullport. (Wizards of the Coast) p. 18-19. ISBN 0-7869-1348-7. House Tanor'Thal dominated the trade from Karsoluthiyl due to their control over the portal system. Their interests there were great enough for Matron Mother Haelra Tanor'Thal to send her niece Kesra to act as de facto Matron Mother in Skullport, and building a massive spider shaped compound. House Lysaen attempted to establish their own presence, under the guidance of Ahlysaaria Yril'Lysaen<ref>Steven E. Schend (March 1996) DRMG #227: The Reports From Undermountain> (Wizards of the Coast) p. 17.

His house was destroyed by House Tanor'Thal and he escaped, changing his name to Tabuirr. He used his position and organization to secretly undermine House Tanor'Thal's commerce by attacking their caravans.<ref>Joseph Wolf (1999) Skullport. (Wizards of the Coast) p. 86. ISBN 0-7869-1348-7.\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]] much of Skullport was destroyed, and described as being only home to houseless Drow, suggesting that much of the various Karsoluthiyl interests were no longer operating.<ref>Bruce R.
