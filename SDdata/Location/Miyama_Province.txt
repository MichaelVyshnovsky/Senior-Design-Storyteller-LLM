The '''Miyama Province''' was one of the most wealthy and populated provinces in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Geography==
Miyama was at the exact center of the isle of [[Shinkoku]]. It was composed of two very fertile plains, the Northern and Southern Plains, divided by woods and the mountains of [[Kurisammyaku]]. It also had two lakes, [[Nora-ko]] and [[Uji-ko]], and three large cities: the capital [[Tamanokuni]], the former capital [[Kuda]], and the northern city of [[Okahira]].

Among the two plains, the Southern Plain was the more expansive. Situated along the shores of the [[Gulf of Mi]], this plain was bifurcated into two fertile regions by a tributary of the Kurisammyaku range. To the east lied the area formed by the [[Tara-gawa Basin]], while the western portion received water from numerous small streams that cascaded down from the mountains. Both regions benefit from extensive irrigation systems that support the cultivation of [[rice]], making them vital agricultural zones.

The Northern Plain, smaller and more secluded than its southern counterpart, featured fertile land primarily near the coast where the mountains abruptly met the sea. The principal agricultural area was created by the confluence of several stream valleys. Extending from this plain was a rugged cape, densely forested and interspersed with marshy reeds. The cape terminated in a series of smaller islands that were equally rugged and generally unsuitable for habitation.

==Climate==
The climate of Miyama was temperate, with distinct seasonal variations. Spring ushered in a gradual warming trend, lifting the area from the chilly grip of winter's below-freezing temperatures to an average of {{SI|60|F|long=yes}} by the season's end. As summer approached, this transition heralded the onset of the rainy season, marking a significant shift in the weather pattern.

As summer progressed in Miyama, the weather became humid and oppressive. During this period, there was little wind, and rainfall was abundant, leading to a constant state of dampness and the proliferation of mildew. As the season advanced, the rain decreased while temperatures climbed, often reaching between {{SIrange|95|100|F|long=yes}}. The air in the lower valleys remained stiflingly humid.

In the late summer, the region was occasionally struck by typhoons, which were capable of delivering over {{SI|12|in|c|long=yes}} of rain in a single event. These powerful storms also generated huge tidal waves and gale-force winds, severely impacting the coastal areas.

The typhoon season in Miyama heralded the conclusion of summer, leading to cooler and more comfortable weather with the arrival of fall. The oppressive humidity receded, making the lower slopes and valleys more pleasant. Autumn was marked by a vibrant transformation of foliage into a colorful display. As the days shortened, heavy frosts begin to appear.

Nearing the year's end, the first snows began to fall, driven by cold winds sweeping in from the [[Celestial Sea]]. These conditions brought substantial snowfall to the highland areas of the province. As winter deepened, occasional snowfall blanketed the entire province, with lighter coverage on the lower plains and heavier accumulations in the mountainous regions. Temperatures dropped below freezing, causing lakes and streams to ice over.

==Government==
The governance of Miyama mirrored the complex and factional nature of the imperial government. Power struggles among the shikken, shogun, and the imperial line at the national level were paralleled within Miyama through the structure of its local government. This was evident in the official posts and appointments across the province, where each major faction had its representatives. These representatives aimed to wield influence and secure advantages for their respective factions, leading to a dynamic yet contentious political landscape in Miyama.

In Miyama, the highest echelons of regional governance were occupied by the [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shugo-daimyo'']] and the [[Kozakuran dictionary#K|''kokushu'']]. The shugo-daimyo was appointed directly by the shogunal authorities and oversaw military and administrative matters in the province. The kokushu served as the representative of the imperial family, embodying the central government’s interests and policies within the province.

Both the shugo-daimyo and kokushu oversaw a hierarchy of minor officials, ensuring that their respective directives were implemented throughout the region. Additionally, the governance structure includes samurai [[Kozakuran dictionary#J|''jitto'']], who managed the many [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']] scattered across Miyama. These jito were tasked with overseeing agricultural production, tax collection, and local law enforcement.

==Trade==
In Miyama, as in other provinces of Kozakura, [[rice]] served as the principal source of income. It was integral to the economy, used not only as a staple food but also as a form of [[currency]] for various taxes and transactions. Rice was utilized to pay the land tax, harvest tax, and occasionally the labor tax. It also served as payment for other foods, finished goods, animals, and services.

As a result, rice production was a critical resource for both peasants and lords. Every individual aimed to maximize their yield—some peasants even resorted to cultivating secret rice fields in the mountains, away from the eyes of tax collectors, to increase their harvest and reduce their tax burden.

Nobles, officials, and temples accumulated rice primarily through the collection of rents and taxes from peasants. They invested in large-scale land reclamation projects, aimed at converting new territories into productive rice fields. These endeavors were labor-intensive and challenging; they involved clearing forests, filling bogs, constructing irrigation ditches, terracing mountainsides, diverting streams, and establishing fields, all by manual labor.

Despite the demanding nature of these tasks, the potential benefits made them worthwhile. Increased rice production led to more rent income, reinforcing the economic foundation of the region and supporting the societal infrastructure.

[[Tea]] was swiftly emerging as a significant agricultural product. Introduced to Kozakura around {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, tea had rapidly gained popularity, especially among the [[samurai]] and noble classes, becoming a fashionable and sought-after commodity.

Tea cultivation took advantage of the warm mountain slopes in Miyama, an ideal environment for this crop. Although current production levels were modest, there was a noticeable trend of increasing land conversion for tea cultivation. As more suitable mountain terrain was dedicated to tea production, it was poised to become an increasingly important aspect of Miyama’s economy and culture.

Lumber represented another crucial natural resource for Miyama, extracted from its mountains and wooded valleys. This wood was utilized within the province itself to meet local demands. However, the supply was sufficient to allow for some lumber to be exported, especially to the capital and other provinces, via shipping routes. Additionally, lumber was occasionally requisitioned as a form of tax payment, particularly in times of crisis, such as after a fire had devastated parts of the capital or a daimyo’s palace.

Miyama was proficient in the production of a wide range of finished goods, including cloth, woodworks, paper, baskets, and pottery. This diversity enabled the province to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency, a common trait among the provinces of Kozakura. Among these, Miyama was particularly noted for its pottery industry, albeit small, which has gained a distinguished reputation.

Centered around [[Hiwasa]], several small family-operated kilns produced pottery that was celebrated for its unique characteristics. This pottery was distinguished by its ashen blue cracked glazes and textured surfaces, features that have garnered acclaim and appreciation. These well-crafted pieces are highly valued and often found in the homes of the samurai and daimyo.
