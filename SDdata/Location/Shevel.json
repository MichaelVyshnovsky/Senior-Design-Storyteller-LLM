        "mainbody": "Shevel was the greatest of Rashemens trading cities that lay on the great Golden Way. As of the midâ€“14 century DR, it was the largest settlement in the entire country.\nShevel was distinctly different from other Rashemaar settlements in that it did not have the typical stone dwellings built within burrowed hills. Rather it featured a number of wooden buildings that were protected by a large stone wall.\nThe various districts within the city each housed populations that largely hailed from from the same ethnic background, including Damarans, Kara-turans, Mulhorandi, and even one predominantly occupied by shield dwarves.\nIt was located between the cities of Taporan and Thasunta, south of the Urlingwood. \nTraders came to Shevel from a great number of nearby locales including Mulhorand, Semphar, and the Hordelands.\nShevel was one of two cities in Rashemen, along with Mulptan, where foreigners could establish a permanent residence.\nFollowing the demise of Citadel Rashemar, Shevel and local caravanners both faced increasing attacks from both bandits and other malevolent people in the region."
