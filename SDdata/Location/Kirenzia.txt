'''Kirenzia''' was one of the two smallest independant city-states of the [[Blade Kingdoms]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
In reality, Kirenzia was less of a "city-state" and more of a humble independent town that shared the traditions and government structure with its bigger neighbors. Kirenzia and [[Zurtia]]. Kirenzia had busy docks with ships and river barges

==Geography==
Kirenzia stood to the south off the grandest city-state of the Blade Kingdoms - [[Sumbria]]. Both settlements were located on the lush shores of the [[Akanamere]], in the rolling green foothills of the [[Akanapeaks]].

==Government==
Like other city-states of the Blade Kingdoms, Kirenzia was governed by a free-voting mercenary [[Blade Council]]. The Blade Council was composed of [[Blade Captains]] - leaders of noble families who held enough mercenaries, troops, and machines of war. The ruler of the city was the Prince-elect, one of the Blade Captains with significant numbers and political power. The law that dictated the functions and rules of the Blade Council was called the ''[[Articles of Association]]''. The laws dictated the rules of crown elections, the rules of selection of the Grand Commander, and the annual Council meetings. Additionally, each of the city-states had their own constitution.

==History==
The Blade Kingdoms were resettled ''circa'' [[1017 DR]] by the grand mercenary companies from the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The sellswords turned their backs on their honor-less Chondathian masters and their bloody trying wars. The numerous mercenary troopers with their families, traveling hospitals, mobile sanctuaries, and courts, slowly traveled the continent until they reached the unclaimed lands on the north-western shores of the Akanamere. The Vilhonese claimed the yellow rolling hills and valleys of scattered ruins.{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}}

The engineers and scientists that came with the mercenary settlers spent several years preparing ancient aqueducts, soldiers cleared the broken harbor mouths and repaired the roads and mountain passes. With more time, tent cities became high-walled cities. Each mercenary company claimed a piece of land, each becoming a city-state. Mercenary captains wed their followers, captured enemies, and courtesans, making the first generations of the noble families of the Blade Kingdoms.

In the fall of {{YearlinkName|1217}}, the bloodless civilized traditions of the Blade Kingdoms were shattered by an ambitious and cruel Blade Captain of [[Lomatra]], [[Ugo Svarézi]]. He manipulated and schemed to bring the cities of Lomatra and Sumbria to open war, decimated forces of Sumbria, and instated himself as the Prince-elect of both cities. Svarézi hunger for power did not end there. He planned on taking barges from Kirenzia to build his war fleet, knowing that Kirenzia had no chance against the joint armies of two city-states. However in the winter that followed, Ugo Svarézi moved against his neighbours. Once his armies reached Kirenzia, the town opened its gates in surrender. In response, Svarézi raized the town and slaughtered most if not all inhabitants.
