The Urlingwood was a wild, untamed forest in north Rashemen that was considered to be of great importance to the Wychlaran, the order of witches that held great influence in the nation of the east.
The Urlingwood was the meeting place of the Witches of Rashemen. Anyone not of their order, or members of the Vremyonni, Patrols of Rashemaar warriors marched around the border to warn off those who were lost or ignorant to local customs.
It was the site where the hathrans came to hold meetings, craft their witchboats, brew Jhuild, and ordain the young ethrans within their order. The only non-Wychlaran allowed within the forest were young Rashemaar that were readied to join the order of the Vremyonni. 
While the witches of Rashemen always wear their masks in public places, they frequently went maskless while within the Urlingwood.
The forest was located northwest of the Sunrise Mountains, just beyond the Running Rocks and south of the Endless Wastes. 
Aside from the town of Urling, the two nearest Rashemaar cities were Mulptan and Shevel.
As of the , the easternmost cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra operated within the Urlingwood. It composed those members of the organization that committed crimes not serious enough to warrant execution. The cell was tasked with ridding the wood of its resident witches.
