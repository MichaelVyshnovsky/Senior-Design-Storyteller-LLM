The Marids Mouth, also known as al-Gawwar, al-Hazan, or Maut Ahmar, was a large whirlpool located in the waters of the southern region of the Nada al-Hazan achipelago within the Crowded Sea.
The mouth of Maut Ahmar spanned several leagues, striking fear into the heart of any sailor within sight because the whirlpool moved around in random patterns, making it nearly impossible to safely navigate around.
