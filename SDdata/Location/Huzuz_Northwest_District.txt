The '''Northwest District''' was a district of [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
The Northwest District was found in the [[Clothiers' Quarter]] in the western portion of Huzuz. It was the only part of the city that could be considered a slum. Many fish markets could be found here, selling their catches from [[Al-Sarif River]] and [[Zakharan seas|Suq Bay]]. Other less-savory trades such as gambling, smuggling, and slave-trading, also occurred here.

The [[Avenue of the Sea|Fishers' Road]] ran along the northeastern border of the district, separating it from the [[Merchants' District]] and the [[Grand Bazaar]]. Most of the eastern border was formed by the [[Clothiers' Way]]. The [[Clothiers' District]] lay to the south of the Northwest District.

==Inhabitants==
Most of the population of this district were commoners, laborers, and petty criminals. The Northwest District was a haven for illicit activities, making the streets unsafe during the night.
