'''Castle Grimstead''', originally founded as '''Castle Greatstead''', was a castle in [[Shadowdale]], in the [[Dalelands]]. 

==Geography==
North of the castle was [[cavenauth]], a cave mouth that lead down into the [[Shadowdark]].

==History==
In [[834 DR]], Castle Greatstead is constructed by the [[adventurer|adventuring]] company [[Glittering Band]] with the aim of driving back the [[drow]] who inhabited the nearby [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba|Twisted Tower]].

In [[864 DR]], the castle was overrun a combination of drow forces from above and below the ground and partially destroyed by explosions.

''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], the castle's walls were pitching at dangerous angles and the wood had mostly rotted away. It was uninhabited at that time.

==Product History==
In 2012 Wizards of the Coast released the set of Dungeon Tiles (DN6) bearing the same name.
