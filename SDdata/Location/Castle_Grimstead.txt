Castle Grimstead, originally founded as Castle Greatstead, was a castle in Shadowdale, in the Dalelands. 
North of the castle was cavenauth, a cave mouth that lead down into the Shadowdark.
In 834 DR, Castle Greatstead is constructed by the adventuring company Glittering Band with the aim of driving back the drow who inhabited the nearby Twisted Tower.
In 864 DR, the castle was overrun a combination of drow forces from above and below the ground and partially destroyed by explosions.
Circa 1367 DR, the castles walls were pitching at dangerous angles and the wood had mostly rotted away. It was uninhabited at that time.
In 2012 Wizards of the Coast released the set of Dungeon Tiles (DN6) bearing the same name.
