        "mainbody": "'''Eylea''' was a small city somewhere in [[Faerûn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Living City: Black Dugal's Music Shoppe|25}}<ref group=\"note\">As Eylea is only mentioned in \"The Living City\" in ''Polyhedron'' #56 and is not marked on any map, it is unknown where in the Realms it actually is. Given Dugal's travels, it might lie somewhere around [[Sembia]] or [[the Vast]], but this is only an assumption. Moreover, as a \"small city\", Eylea might be more of a large town, hence a lack of notability, and it could've been destroyed or abandoned after the attack. Incidentally, \"Eylea\" is also the name of a palace-temple in the 1986 adventure module [[Wikipedia:Ravager of Time|''Ravager of Time'']], but there are no other connections, so this seems entirely coincidental.",
        "Defenses": "It was protected by Eylea Keep and was the base of the [[Avante Guard]] [[adventuring company]].",
        "History": "After leaving [[Yhaunn]] in [[Sembia]], the young [[wizard]] and would-be [[adventurer]] [[Dugal Buchannan|Black Dugal Buchannan]] went to Eylea to join the Avante Guard, but was declined for his lack of experience. Thus, Dugal joined the Eylea Keep garrison instead as a journeyman wizard, where he served for two years.\n\nAfter the Avante Guard destroyed a temple used by an obscure cult ''circa'' [[1340 DR]], the cultists sent their minions and hired mercenaries, including [[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, [[drow]], and even [[demon]]s, against Eylea. The attack raged for two days before it was routed, leaving many dead. Sickened by battle, Dugal became a pacifist and retired, later establishing [[Black Dugal's Music Shoppe]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] by around [[1357 DR]]."
