'''Unthalass''' was the capital of [[Unther]], considered once the greatest city in all the Realms.

==Goverment==
During the rule of [[Gilgeam]], the city was governed by his priesthood. ''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], the city was governed by the [[priest]] [[Zimrilim]].

During the late years of the 14{{Th}}, Unthalass was ruled by the [[Mulhorand]]i occupation forces.

After the destruction of Unther, the city was ruled by [[lamia]]s. By [[1486 DR]], it was [[Zillah]].

In [[1487 DR]], a second incarnation of Gilgeam reclaimed the rulership of the city from the lamias.

==Population==
Unthalass was populated mostly by humans of the [[Mulan]] ethnic group, most of them nobles.

After the destruction of Unther, the ruins of Unthalass were inhabited by lamias.

In 1487 DR, the ruins of Unthalass were reclaimed by the Untherite who returned from [[Abeir]].

==Notable Locations==
Unthalass' undercity was the location of a secret temple to [[Tiamat]]. Around 1357 DR, the area was home to [[wererat]]s and lamias, led by a [[lamia noble]] named [[Ereshkigal]].

==History==
Unthalass was founded in {{Yearlink|-2087}} by the [[god]]-king [[Enlil]], in a place were he found [[pearl]]s in the west coast of the [[Alamber Sea]]. At its peak, Unthalass was considered the greatest city in all of [[Faer√ªn]].

Over the years, two great floods,

Finally, in [[1358 DR]], an epic confrontation between the two raging deities Gilgeam and Tiamat destroyed most of the city. Unthalass was later occupied by the Mulhorandi, who put the city under military law and claimed its slaves as propriety of the church of [[Anhur]],

Unthalass was finally destroyed during the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]]. As the [[dragonborn]] from nearby [[Tymanther]] were not interested in claiming the ruins, the lamias that survived the catastrophe became the "new" inhabitants of the ruined city.

In 1487 DR, after the [[Second Sundering]] brought the Untherans from Abeir to [[Toril]], the second incarnation of Gilgeam reclaimed the city from the lamias, and began to develop a project to rebuilt the city as the capital of the reborn Unther.
