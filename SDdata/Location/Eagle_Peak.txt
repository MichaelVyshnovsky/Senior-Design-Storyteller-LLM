Eagle Peak was a human hamlet in the Storm Horns, a mountainous area northwest of Cormyr. It was built on a large outcrop and had a population of 153. It was a popular caravan stop.
In the early 1360s DR, one of the merchant caravan drovers was accused of being a werewolf. The townies wanted to hang the suspected monster before the arrival of the full moon in just three days. The drovers employee stood up for the lycanthrope, calling him to be the best caravan drover in the masters employ.
