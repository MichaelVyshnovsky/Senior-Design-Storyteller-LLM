The '''Dragonbone Vale''' was an ancient mountain valley located high in the southwestern part of the [[Sword Mountains]] of the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Description==
[[File:Dragonbone Vale waterways.png|thumb|350x350px]]
The Dragonbone Vale was divided into four areas by perilous ridges. The wooded area was known as [[Whetstone Thicket]], the [[dwarven]] ruins of [[Quellwater Tarn]] laid in the crags, and [[Wyrmbone Marrows]] – an area of sharp rocks with ancient [[dragon]] remains scattered all over. Lastly, the [[Scaleblight Summit]] was a mountain wrapped in corruption and foul magics. Quellwater Tarn was the remnants of an ancient dwarvish civilization – [[Keldegonn]], long gone and forgotten by the 15{{th}} century.

===Flora & Fauna===

The slopes of the valley were inhabited by [[bear]]s, [[deer]], [[toads]], sheltered by massive [[pine]] [[tree]]s. On occasion, dragons were known to call the valley a home.

The area was known for its healing [[herb]]s, most – killed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s corrupting magic. One curative herb of note found there was a vibrant blue flower – the [[Vale Blossom]] that was said to be able to cure nearly any ailment.

==History==
[[File:Dragonbone Vale cultists.jpg|thumb|350x350px]]
Many centuries before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the unnamed vale was claimed by the ancient dragon named [[Baruloxis]]. An aggressive creature, they still believed that there was enough space in the valley for other dragons to have lairs of their own and keep their hoards secure in safety and peace. Baruloxis was hailed as the leader of their kin and respected by the dwarves of Keldegonn. Legends claimed that Baruloxis developed an obsession over their mate, the obsession that led the ancient dragon to practice [[necromancy]]. Baruloxis' necromancy was what gave the Dragonbone Vale its name.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Elminster Aumar]] uncovered a sinister plot by the Cult of the Dragon in an ancient vale deep within the Sword Mountains. The cultists uncovered an ancient [[Netherese]] ''[[mythallar]]'' that had enough magical power to make the prophecy of the ''[[Chronicle of Years to Come]]'' true. With Elminster's help, factions and [[adventurer]]s of the Sword Coast North gathered their forces under Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]]'s command and set up camp in the [[Dragonbone Vale]] to thwart the cult's plot. The allied forces named the camp – the [[Shield of the North]].

The cult was spreading corruption with the use of ''[[malignant conduit]]s'' across the Dragonbone Vale, with the help from the dreaded [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. The parasitic corruption was designed to feed sapped lifeforce from the vale and its creatures back into the ''mythallar'', fuelling it. This needed the attention of Neverwinter's heroes, guided to the ''malignant conduits'' locations across the valley by [[Xuna]], a hero and a supplier for the Shield of the North. Meanwhile, the [[Emerald Enclave]] and [[Etrien]] tried to restore depleted wildlife and keep the cult's corruption at bay. [[Celeste]] and the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] focused their radiant magics on cleansing and repurposing ''malignant conduits'', turning them into devices to cleanse the spreading corruption.

Thayvian agents were led to the valley by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]. She ordered draconic remains to be exhumed and dragged to the Wyrmbone Marrows from where the corrupting magic was spreading its vile tentacles. Ancient dragon bones were used to create more powerful ''malignant conduits,'' leading the Red Wizards to desecrate draconic graves.

To combat the growing corruption and enter the Scaleblight Summit, Elminster and his friend [[Gisentraxia]] developed magical protection using an ancient ritual scroll recovered from the ruins of Keldegonn – the ''[[Decree of the Mad King]]'', crystalised remains of dragon Baruloxis, who was murdered by their own mate after delving into necromantic magics, a Thayan ''[[periapt of shielding]]'', and the [[Vale Blossom]].

Once the protective magic was distilled into radiant foci, the adventurers and troops of the Shield of the North marched to the Scaleblight Summit just in time as Valindra Shadowmantle was casting the ''mythal'' spell, using the fully-charged ''mythallar''. The ''mythal'' was charged with the ''[[Rite of the Dracolich]]'' that was to convert all dragonkind into dracoliches.

With an intervention, Valindra managed to cast a flawed version of ''Scaleblight mythal'' and faced heroes in battle on the back of a dracolich. She faced yet another defeat at the hands of Neverwintran heroes and fled as Elminster shielded heroes from the destructive magics of the ''mythal's'' demise.

==Notable Locations==
* Whetstone Thicket, a patch of idyllic forested land teeming with healing herbs and animal life, driven away by the cult's ''malignant conduits'' in the late 15{{th}} century DR. Most of the healing herbs were killed by the cult's dark magics.
* [[Scalerot Caverns]], cave tunnels underneath Quellwater Tarn.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Drakken|Commander Drakken]], a traditionalist commander of the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Old Oghi]], a massive and powerful [[bear]], strong enough to scare away a young [[blue dragon]], who lived in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Orgnir|Orgnir the Lost]], a giant [[undead]] guardian of the ''mythallar''.
* [[Aelioth|Master Aelioth]], a Red Wizard necromancer in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[The Mad King]], the spirit of an ancient leader of Quellwater Tarn, trapped in a ''[[curse]]d'' Netherese chalice, ready to possess anyone foolish enough to drink from it.
