        "mainbody": "The smallest district was the red-roofed Adventurers' District, lying between the District of the Poor and the Merchant District, south of the Great Way. It was dedicated the more dangerous trades, including exploration, prospecting, mining, scavenging, caravan guarding, wagon and caravan driving, and weapon making and training. People who engaged in such activities were all generally considered \"adventurers\" in Procampur. The area housed them and those who had no particular work to do yet had the money to own their own homes anyway.\n\nIt had other purposes as well, being a place for gambling, hearing [[bard]]s tell tales, and finding adventurers who were free with their magic. It was home to the notorious \"red-roof girls\".The bawdy local song \"[[I'm Quite the Red-Roof Girl]]\" from ''[[Crypt of the Moaning Diamond]]'' suggests that the Adventurers' District may also be a home to prostitutes and [[festhall]]s.\n\n===Merchant District===\nThe Merchant District had sea-green roofs and sat south of the Great Way, between the Adventurers' District and the Temple District. It contained the shops and homes of local, domestic businessmen, those who did not conduct trades related to the sea or adventuring. It was filled with workshops and apartments, with narrow, unflagged streets and the smells of the various businesses.\n\n===Temple District===\nThe Temple District had shining black roofs and sat between the Merchant District and the Castle District, beneath the Great Way. The district comprised four great temple complexes, as well as smaller temples and many shrines to lesser gods. There was an open space for setting up temporary shrines. The district was also home to the scattered houses of the clergy. The temples were built of stone. The temples were:\n* The [[Domes of Reason]], dedicated to [[Oghma]];\n* The [[Hall of Success]], dedicated to [[Waukeen]];\n* The [[House of the Hand]], dedicated to [[Torm]];\n* The [[Lady's Happy Hall]], dedicated to [[Tymora]];\n* The [[Tower of the Eye]], dedicated to [[Helm]];\n* An [[temple of Deneir (Procampur)|unnamed temple]] of [[Deneir]]; and\n* An unnamed temple of [[Istishia]];\n\nAmong others, there was a shrine to [[Mystra]], as well shrines to Deneir and Oghma, in addition to their temples.''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' and the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)]]'' state that there are only shrines to Mystra, Deneir, and Oghma, and the latter equates the shrine of Oghma to the home of Kordamant. However, ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'' places the Domes of Reason, a major temple of Oghma, in Procampur, while the short story \"Patronage\" in ''[[Realms of Valor]]'' and the ''[[Horde Campaign]]'' place an unnamed [[temple of Deneir (Procampur)|temple of Deneir]] there. This suggests that these shrines exist in addition to the temples.\n\n===Military===\nThe only exceptions to the district rule were military buildings, which were located at strategic locations throughout the city and were marked by white-washed roofs. These were barracks, stables, armories, guard-posts, and guard-houses.\n\n===Harbor===\n[[File:Hm-boye.jpg|thumb|''[[Hm-boye]] in a foggy Procampan street.'']]\nAt the western end of the Great Way, beyond two huge towers, was the harbor or port area. Being officially outside the city, and outside the Thultyrl's influence, the buildings here kept to no particular purpose, style, size, or roof color. Visitors, citizens, and foreign traders here could come and go freely and act as they liked. It contained places that could not or would not fit into the districts, being home to warehouses, fisherfolk, and ship-builders that needed to be nearer the sea, as well as stables and facilities for training and caring for mounts and livestock that didn't belong to Procampan authorities. There were also cheaper inns and taverns that catered to travelers, as well as a number of small \"bed-and-beer\" houses that huddled around them. It could be a crowded and dank place, and in parts disreputable.\n\nThe port area was hemmed in by two stub walls off the main city walls that curved to meet the shore in a rough crescent. The district was some quarter-mile (400 meters) wide, and extended a significant distance up the coast. The city didn't have an easily controlled harbor mouth, making the harbor difficult to defend well. The north and south walls each had a pair of gates leading to the coast road, the [[High Trail]], and the [[North Road]].\n\n===Locations & Establishments===\nThe following streets and shops were found in Procampur:\n* Scribes' Alley, Merchant District: [[Forgemaster]] [[Inkstain]]\n* Shards Street, Adventurers' District: [[Rendril's Forge]]\n* Leaping Dolphin Lane: [[Summergarth Facilitations]]\n\nThere were several inns and taverns that catered to locals, travelers and adventurers:\n* The [[Happy Hippocampus]]\n* The [[Silent Sword]]\n* The [[Griffin's Claw]]\n\nThere was also the [[Thayan Quarter]], which was the very first [[Thayan enclave]], founded in 1344 DR.\n\n[[Raven Express]] kept an office in Procampur, allowing communication via carrier-[[raven]] to its offices in other cities.",
        "Etymology & Language": "The name \"Procampur\" was derived from \"Proeskampalar\", the [[dwarven]] town that previously occupied the site. The demonym and adjectival form was \"Procampan\". Its people spoke the Procampan dialect of the [[Easting language]],{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} which was related to the [[Damaran language]].{{cite book/Player's Guide to Faerûn|15}}",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "Procampur was an ancient and well-established city, the oldest in the Vast{{Cite web/More of the Underdark and the Vast|}} and with a long heritage.\n\nOriginally, it was the site of an anchorage. When thieves stole the treasury of King [[Glaurauth|Glaurauth the Great]] of [[Westgate]] ({{Yearlink|-301}} to {{Yearlink|-291}}), they fled by ship and anchored here. From they, they ventured into the [[Earthfast Mountains]], with Westgate's wizards in pursuit; both forces were slain in [[Elvenblood Pass]].\n\nDwarves from [[Earthfast]] founded the underground town of Proeskampalar in the {{YearlinkName|-153}}. Fueled by this trade, Proeskampalar was a strong and wealthy city-state before the {{YearlinkName|1}}.\n\nIn the early 5{{th}} century [[DR]], King [[Meldath I]] of Impiltur led a conquest of the Vast and other nearby lands, turning Proeskampalar and [[Chessagol]] into vassal city-states. He took the royal regalia of both cities.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|63}}<ref group=\"note\">[[Dragon magazine 346|\"Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom\"]] names this warrior king Meldath the Magnificent. However, ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' lists only Meldath I \"the Mighty\" ([[441 DR|441]]–[[445 DR]]) and Meldath II ([[445 DR|445]]–[[448 DR]]). The name and details suggest this is in fact Meldath I. Both Proeskampalar/Procampur and Chessagol/Tsurlagol later became independent, but this event has not been detailed.\n\nIn time, the human surface settlement grew into a great city, known as Procampur, which was founded in the {{YearlinkName|523}}.It's not clear when the Thultyrls rose to power. This history assumes it took place after the city became known as Procampur, owing to mentions of it under that name in the source. However, this could've occurred when Procampur was described as a strong and wealthy city prior to 1 DR.\n\nAt the time, Procampur was a fortress-city, based around the Castle District of later centuries. The Thultyrls who ruled it preferred peace, order, and discipline in a walled and guarded city. To reduce petty crimes like theft and enable easy rule, the expanding city was segregated into walled, self-contained districts, connected by guarded passages, unlike in other open and sprawling cities.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1164}}, the master jewelers of Procampur crafted a new crown for the coronation of King [[Palaghard I]] of [[Cormyr]]. But the crown was stolen when the legendary pirate [[Immurk|Immurk the Invincible]] raided the merchant-ship carrying the precious cargo. The crime was so audacious that Palaghard believed no one could be so brave, and the Procampan jewelers must be cheating him instead. He mustered his armies and nearly declared war on Procampur before being corrected. This crime signified a rise in piracy on the Inner Sea, and the nations around it began building warships to protect their merchants. The crown was eventually recovered, but was so heavy, grandiose and ugly that it was only used for a few months. Immurk went on to steal from Procampur, among several other cities.\n\nFinally, the [[Pirate Wars]] broke out in the {{YearlinkName|1209}}, when kingdoms around the Inner Sea allied against a pirate fleet based at [[Dragonisle]]. Procampur contributed mercenary forces and, with Impiltur and [[Aglarond]], formed the eastern fleet of 75 ships. Working with the western fleet of Cormyr, [[Sembia]], and the [[Vilhon Reach]], they defeated [[Urdogen]]'s pirate fleet in the [[Battle of the Fallen]]. For the eastern fleet's brave rescue of the Sembian force, Procampur and Impiltur claimed a greater share of the prizes. Soon after, the alliance fell into bickering and broke apart.\n\nIn the mid–13{{th}} century [[DR]], a fever in Procampur killed several people, including the current Thultyrl. He was succeeded by his son, a young man. The current [[Hamayarch]] was [[the Pearl]], who'd apparently held the position for three generations, despite her youthful appearance. The mid–13{{th}} century saw the Vast suffer rampaging hordes of [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[bugbear]]s, supplemented by some human brigands and half-breed rogues. In the {{YearlinkName|1246}},{{CotMD-time}} the orc warlord [[Fottergrim]] and the [[magelord]] [[Archlis]] led a mixed horde of them in an invasion and takeover of [[Tsurlagol]]. The Thultyrl honored Procampur's treaty with Tsurlagol and led an army to besiege and liberate the city. To supplement his forces, he hired mercenaries, including [[camel]]-riding cavalry from the [[Shaar]] and the [[Siegebreaker]]s, an adventuring band of sappers. It was an expensive undertaking, paid for by Procampur's nobles and merchants; by the treaty, Procampur expected to recover its expenses from Tsurlagol. It also had to be done quickly, before those paying for it grew too restless.\n\nThe Pearl predicted the Thultyrl was destined to die young, at the age of 26 and early in his reign, in battle against Fottergrim before the walls of Tsurlagol. Instead, he was wounded on a hunting trip during the campaign (an event perhaps orchestrated by the Pearl). The Pearl secretly prevented his wounds from healing to keep him away from the front-lines and Fottergrim, believing he would go on to become a good king and complete the [[Great Codex]] of Procampur's laws. Thanks to the Siegebreakers and the [[Moaning Diamond]] artifact, Fottergrim and Archlis were slain, Procampur's armies victorious, and Tsurlagol was liberated. Fottergrim's [[silver]]-plated skull was mounted on a pillar halfway between the two cities with a warning against threatening Procampur's allies.\n\nAlso in the mid–13{{th}} century,<ref group=\"note\">That is, \"more than a century ago\"  before at least 1357 DR. a hobgoblin horde marched near Procampur. It was defeated with the aid of the mage [[Snilloc]], who earned some fame for his actions here.",
            "Undated History": "At some point, Procampur was assaulted by the [[green dragon]] [[Maldrithor]], the \"Sarbreenar Wyrm\". Though it laired at [[Sarbreenar]], it had eaten all it could there and flew south to Procampur for food. There it ripped the roofs from houses and ate the people it caught inside. The city suffered two such raids, and by the third they had hired a wizard to slay the dragon. With exploding \"[[swordball]]s\", the wizard bloodily tore Maldrithor apart and sent the dragon crashing down dead in the harbor.<ref group=\"note\">This is estimated to be some time between [[649 DR]] (the fall of [[Roldilar]], the dwarf realm that possessed Sarbreenar) and [[1370 DR]] (the date of ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]''.\n\nPrior to [[1356 DR]], Procampur had conflicts with [[Mulmaster]] and [[Sembia]], in which it fended off their attacks in decisive naval battles. It also suffered several [[pirate]] raids. Although they pillaged the harbor district, they were always unable to break into the main city.\n\n[[File:Vilhiard.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''An illumination from ''A Discovery of the World'', depicting Vilhiard of Procampur meeting a Tuigan tribe.'']]\nA Hierarch of [[Deneir]] (thought to be receiving commands from the Thultyrl) sent the renowned scholar-monk [[Vilhiard]] on a number of lengthy and hazardous journeys into the east. The Thultyrl granted him a supply of wealth for expenses. Though he later wrote of his travels in ''[[A Discovery of the World]]'', Vilhiard remained quiet about the actual purposes of these missions.<ref group=\"note\">Descriptions and references to the Tuigans and Thayans in the passage of text from ''A Discovery of the World'' in ''[[The Horde]]'' place Vilhiard's travels sometime between [[1074 DR]] and [[1360 DR]].",
            "Modern History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1317}}, the [[Plague of Dragons]] quickly spread around the Inner Sea from the Vilhon Reach to Impiltur and Tsurlagol. The priests of Procampur feared their city would be next to suffer the diseases and the dragon that spread them. The Thultyrl of the time recruited the temple corps to help defend the city.<ref group=\"note\">The outcome of the Plague of Dragons' approach to Procampur is unknown.\n\nThe very first of the [[Thayan enclave]]s was founded in Procampur in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, when [[Samas Kul]], [[Thay]]'s Master of the Guild of Foreign Trade, organized the concession of the small [[Thayan Quarter]] there.\n\nBy [[1357 DR]], the Thultyrl of Procampur was the young [[Rendeth of the Royal Blood]], while the position of Hamayarch was held by [[Alamondh]]. Alamondh was in truth an evil mage named [[Carthoun Misintle]] with desires on the throne."
        },
        "Demographics": "By 1358 DR, the most recent census showed a population of some 49,000 people: 98% [[human]], 1% [[dwarf]], and 1% [[half-elf]].The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' (3rd edition)]] saw widespread significant population reductions, though it is not clear why. The larger figure of 49,000 may refer to the population of the surrounding land that Procampur controls, while 24,631 may only be those people within the city itself.",
        "Government & Politics": {
            "Relations": "Procampur was an independent city-state, It was the oldest and richest of them.\n\nProcampur had a long-running alliance with neighboring Tsurlagol,\n\nThe Ravenians of Ravens Bluff tended to look up to and respect Procampur, treating it as their \"elder sister\" of the sister cities. The kingdom of [[Impiltur]] also maintained good relations with Procampur, and its cities had close ties with it before they unified, particularly [[Lyrabar]].\n\nA Ravens Bluff–originated proposal to form a regional government across the Vast was met with a cautious, neutral response from Procampur.\n\nProcampur had past conflicts with [[Mulmaster]] and [[Sembia]], in which it fended off their attacks in decisive naval battles.",
            "Law & Order": "Law and order were paramount in Procampur, which had a set of firm but not particularly harsh or difficult laws. These were strictly implemented and enforced by authorities, who were vigilant and competent, and the people were law-abiding. Though visitors used to more chaotic cities might find themselves restricted by the many laws and codes, or just find them strange, anyone could ask the gate guards to list and explain them, which they did readily and patiently. All the city's laws were compiled in the [[Great Codex]].\n\nThough the city's gem and jewelry trade attracted the criminal element,\n\nProcampan authorities were particularly hostile to pirates. Every Thultyrl formally swore eternal vengeance against any pirate who dared attack the city's ships or raid its well-defended harbor, while judges passed swift judgment on captured pirates. A first offense saw a pirate banished from the city, with a hanging death for those who returned. Nevertheless, Hamayarch Alamondh encouraged Thultyrl Rendeth to relax the city's stance on piracy in the 1360s DR and show leniency and conciliation. A few pirates were even allowed to use Procampur's port, provided their crimes were not too great and no Procampan captain accused them of anything.\n\n[[Slavery]] was illegal in Procampur. All slaves taken to the city were considered free. Nevertheless, slave [[galley]]s sometimes passed through, including those with [[Tuigan]] prisoners in 1362 DR.\n\nVisitors to Procampur were segregated. In particular, visiting adventurers were forced to stay in the port district, officially outside the city proper. Any former adventurer who'd acquired a noble title and desired to live in the Nobles District had to swear to the Thultyrl they would never adventure again and promise not to aid or give shelter to other adventurers in their house.",
            "Public Utilities": "The city maintained fog trumpets that warned of fogs rolling in from the Sea of Fallen Stars.\n\nIn the Nobles District, at least, there were magical street lamps that produced a [[continual flame|constant light]]."
        },
        "Army & Navy": "{{fq\n| text   = Thank all the gods little and small, or heavy and tall, that Procampur is too polite to fight.\n| source = Mercenaries' song<ref>\n| float  = \n| width  = 250px\n}}\nProcampur maintained a strong defense force of army and navy, primarily to protect its valuable gem and metal trade from pirates and rival states.\n\n''Circa'' 1246 DR, Procampan soldiers were clad in [[half-plate]] [[armor]], including [[chain mail]], [[banded mail]], and [[breastplate]] parts, together with shoulder and arm guards, greaves, and [[gauntlet]]s. These were matching, tailored and specially fitted to a soldier, over white shirt and polished [[boots]]. They also had cavalry. Nobles brought three [[horse]]s and a man-servant with them on campaign. Around 1358 DR, Procampan soldiers wore [[plate mail]] and fought with [[broadsword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[morning star]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[crossbow]]s. At the time, Procampur fielded an army of 4000 well-trained soldiers.\n\nThe navy has sixteen major warships with highly trained crews. Several times, Procampur had relied on these ships and crews for its very survival, so they were heavily invested in and well-maintained. They policed the eastern Dragon Reach against pirates, but preferred to stick close to their home-port and the commercial sealanes rather than exploring the less-traveled areas of the Inner Sea.\n\nMuch like their parent city, Procampan armed forces were neat, tidy, and orderly. Their camps were arranged like their city, with banners and ribbon edgings colored similarly to the districts: gold for the Thultyrl's tent, silver for nobles, yellow for servants, and black for priests. The largest tents were impressive pavilions. In the city itself, military buildings like barracks, stables, armories, guard-posts and guard-houses, all with white-washed roofs, circumvented the district system and were located at strategic locations throughout.\n\nMany laws applied to the armed forces, with specific rulings against aiding the enemy and forbidding officers to lose their armor, They also had scholars to research histories and old maps to rediscover tactics and tricks from earlier wars.\n\nProcampur's armed forces were sufficient for its own needs, but on larger campaigns, such as the liberation of Tsurlagol in 1246 DR, the city sometimes needed to hire mercenaries. These were expensive undertakings, paid for by Procampur's nobles and merchants, and had to be over quickly, before those paying for it grew too restless. The [[crusader]]s of the [[blade magic]] sword-temple, led by [[Oriphaun McMaren]], were usually engaged in providing security at major events and noble galas, as well as guarding visiting dignitaries.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades}}\n\n[[The Forty]] were forty stern bodyguards to the Thultyrl.",
        "Economy & Trade": "[[File:Patronage.jpg|thumb|''Inkstain's printing press in operation.'']]\nProcampur was widely regarded as the richest city on the northern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars, and was certainly the wealthiest in the Vast. It lay near some of the oldest [[gem]] mines of that side of the Sea and the gem trade contributed to its success from its earliest days.\n\nThe city was famous for the quality of its jewelry. Its shops were well-stocked with most things available for purchase.\n\nIt was equally famous for its precise and talented smiths, goldsmiths, gem-cutters, and wide-ranging merchants, who were some of its wealthiest and most prominent citizens. Around 1358 DR, these included such figures as [[Opara Rendril]], the master smith; [[Nathchan Belemmor]], a gem-cutter to royalty; and [[Torstan Ulzimmer]], the merchant fleet-owner. One cutting-edge business was the [[printing press]] of Forgemaster [[Inkstain]] in the early 1360s DR. The city's wealthiest nobles, merchants, and mages made donations of wealth to state and church.\n\nThe city had a number of regular traders. Among others, from Ravens Bluff in 1370 DR, the [[Smokeflower House]] merchant house sold goods from [[Altumbel]] and the \"Old Masters\" of the [[Brotherhood of Wool Carders and Weavers]] sold bolts of cloth and bales of wool. Over the Inner Sea, salt from [[Turmish]] was imported.\n\nProcampur distributed its own [[currency|coinage]], but citizens also accepted the [[Cormyr]]ean [[golden lion]], such that 10,000 lions was equivalent to 8,000 Procampan gold coins. A [[copper]] bit was a very low denomination.",
        "Culture & Society": {
            "Religion": "Procampans worshiped a wide range of gods \"beneath the black-roof tiles\" of the Temple District. Deities were adopted and venerated for protection of a household, an occupation, or the protection of a whole district. Their main deities, however, to whom they had the greatest temples, were [[Helm]], [[Oghma]], [[Torm]], [[Tymora]], and [[Waukeen]]. Even worship was governed by many rules and regulations, such as correct and incorrect days for entering shrines and temples. Nobles had their own family shrines at which they could make offerings and prayers in private.\n\nIn Procampan funereal rites, the dead were cremated and their bones stored in ossuaries, which were kept in underground crypts.",
            "Mages": "The [[magic]]-users of Procampur were governed and regulated by the [[Hamayarch]], who was the highest-ranking wizard in the royal court. By the mid–13{{th}} century DR, the Hamayarch called [[the Pearl]] strictly regulated the magic-users, and largely discouraged the practice.\n\nIn addition to their magical studies, Procampan wizards were trained by their mentors in etiquette, heraldry, and the city's codes of conduct. They were expected by their peers to keep up appearances and live grandly, in the manner typical of wizards of the Vast. Spending money on gifts, a well-kept home, and donations to church and state took up a good portion of their wealth.\n\nAround 1358 DR, famous Procampan mages were [[Keldor Hannith]], a seller of potions, scrolls, and spellcasting services; [[Ombedor Steen]], an adventuring mage who rose to the nobility and conducted research; and [[Undylyl Tessran]] and [[Jandather]], young, would-be adventurers.\n\nProcampan wizards who followed Oghma developed an unmistakeable focusing diagram for their spells.<ref>",
            "Thieves": "With the Procampan authorities banning thieves' guilds and breaking up frequent attempts to establish one, and none known to exist, the city had a general lack of thieves.\n\nThose who remained were mostly independent operators. They preyed on Procampur's famed gem and jewelry industry, and specialized in their theft. Thus Procampan thieves were the most skilled and infamous cat burglars in Faerûn, skilled at scaling walls, picking locks, and bypassing traps. They avoided combat and back-stabbing assaults, and rarely wore armor as it interfered with their skills.",
            "Warriors": "As a prosperous city, Procampur's warriors and soldiers, especially officers, were typically those who joined the army out of duty rather than for pay. They were wealthy and could afford fine equipment, but needed to spend as much to maintain appearances and high standards. They focused on courtesy and etiquette, were always good mannered, avoided arguments in camp, and remained clean, with polished boots and armor. They were typically good, honorable, dutiful, and courageous, but could be headstrong in seeking glory. Their training was in sword-fighting and horsemanship, but included etiquette, literature, and poetry. In combat, they fought with grace, balance, and good coordination, and avoided grunting, shouting or insulting their foes. Soldiers were required to wear full armor when away from their camp.\n\nProcampur was also a center of blade magic training and practice, particularly of the discipline of [[White Raven]]. It was also once home to the great [[swordsage]] [[Thallastam]]. The city had a sword-temple with an order of [[crusader]]s led by [[Oriphaun McMaren]] that usually engaged in providing security at major events and noble galas, as well as guarding visiting dignitaries.",
            "Nobility": "The nobles and rich of Procampur were a showy lot, fancy dressed and well-groomed, with [[perfume]]s, powdered faces and elaborate hair-styles. They had a pampered life, traveled the city in [[palanquin]]s carried by bearers, and were attended by hired courtesans. They were known for their delicacy, courtesy, and intrigues.\n\n\"Born under a silver roof\" was a saying to describe noble and wealthy Procampans and all that that implied. Noble children were betrothed to one another at a young age, even as babies. They were raised separately from their families by a succession of nannies and tutors and lived in school dormitories, only seeing their real parents on formal occasions."

        "Layout": {
            "Castle District": "The Castle District sat at the western end of the Great Way, and was the former fortress-city of Procampur before it expanded beyond its walls. Later, it was the site of two grand buildings with gold roofs: the Palace of the Thultyrl and the High Court, which housed royal servants and officials, apartments for state guests, courtrooms, and the treasury. It also contained a number of white-roofed military buildings, mainly barracks and stables for the soldiers. People who did not live or work in the Castle District were discouraged from entering and looking around.",
            "Nobles District": "The silver-roofed Nobles District sat north-west of the Castle District and bordered the Services District. The area was tidy, spacious, and luxurious, with all the grand houses of the city's nobility, flagged streets, and gardens with trees and ornamental pools.",
            "Services District": "The yellow-roofed Services District sat between the Nobles District and the Sea District, north of the Great Way. This area was set aside for a range of service activities, for restaurants, taverns, and a various businesses, and was home to builders, servants, handy-people, and so on.",
            "Sea District": "The blue-roofed Sea District lay north of the Great Way, between the Services District and the harbor. It was home to people who made their living off the sea, from sailors to sea-captains to fleet-owners, though by necessity fisherfolk and ship-builders were located in the port itself. It was also dedicated to cargo storage, outfitters, shipping businesses, and other buildings and businesses related to sea-going trades.",
            "District of the Poor": "The gray-roofed District of the Poor, also known as \"Graystreets\", laid south of the Great Way and between the harbor and the Adventurer's District. All houses here—mostly rooming houses—were owned and maintained by the Thultyrl, while anyone who could own their own home did so in another district. It was home to the poorest people of the city: beggars, the unemployed, and common laborers, who begged, pooled their wealth, and did their best to survive. It was also home to visitors who had to stay in the city for a season or longer. Wealth, or lack of it, was no requirement for dwelling in the Graystreets, and nor was there any stigma to having an address here. The district wasn't very strongly guarded.",
            "Adventurers' District": "{{fq\n| text   = Once the men lived for my sighs, but now they want a peek of…\n| source = Lines from \"I'm Quite the Red-Roof Girl\"\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nThe smallest district was the red-roofed Adventurers' District, lying between the District of the Poor and the Merchant District, south of the Great Way. It was dedicated the more dangerous trades, including exploration, prospecting, mining, scavenging, caravan guarding, wagon and caravan driving, and weapon making and training. People who engaged in such activities were all generally considered \"adventurers\" in Procampur. The area housed them and those who had no particular work to do yet had the money to own their own homes anyway.\n\nIt had other purposes as well, being a place for gambling, hearing [[bard]]s tell tales, and finding adventurers who were free with their magic. It was home to the notorious \"red-roof girls\".The bawdy local song \"[[I'm Quite the Red-Roof Girl]]\" from ''[[Crypt of the Moaning Diamond]]'' suggests that the Adventurers' District may also be a home to prostitutes and [[festhall]]s.",
            "Merchant District": "The Merchant District had sea-green roofs and sat south of the Great Way, between the Adventurers' District and the Temple District. It contained the shops and homes of local, domestic businessmen, those who did not conduct trades related to the sea or adventuring. It was filled with workshops and apartments, with narrow, unflagged streets and the smells of the various businesses.",
            "Temple District": "The Temple District had shining black roofs and sat between the Merchant District and the Castle District, beneath the Great Way. The district comprised four great temple complexes, as well as smaller temples and many shrines to lesser gods. There was an open space for setting up temporary shrines. The district was also home to the scattered houses of the clergy. The temples were built of stone. The temples were:\n* The [[Domes of Reason]], dedicated to [[Oghma]];\n* The [[Hall of Success]], dedicated to [[Waukeen]];\n* The [[House of the Hand]], dedicated to [[Torm]];\n* The [[Lady's Happy Hall]], dedicated to [[Tymora]];\n* The [[Tower of the Eye]], dedicated to [[Helm]];\n* An [[temple of Deneir (Procampur)|unnamed temple]] of [[Deneir]]; and\n* An unnamed temple of [[Istishia]];\n\nAmong others, there was a shrine to [[Mystra]], as well shrines to Deneir and Oghma, in addition to their temples.''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' and the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)]]'' state that there are only shrines to Mystra, Deneir, and Oghma, and the latter equates the shrine of Oghma to the home of Kordamant. However, ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'' places the Domes of Reason, a major temple of Oghma, in Procampur, while the short story \"Patronage\" in ''[[Realms of Valor]]'' and the ''[[Horde Campaign]]'' place an unnamed [[temple of Deneir (Procampur)|temple of Deneir]] there. This suggests that these shrines exist in addition to the temples.",
            "Military": "The only exceptions to the district rule were military buildings, which were located at strategic locations throughout the city and were marked by white-washed roofs. These were barracks, stables, armories, guard-posts, and guard-houses.",
            "Harbor": "[[File:Hm-boye.jpg|thumb|''[[Hm-boye]] in a foggy Procampan street.'']]\nAt the western end of the Great Way, beyond two huge towers, was the harbor or port area. Being officially outside the city, and outside the Thultyrl's influence, the buildings here kept to no particular purpose, style, size, or roof color. Visitors, citizens, and foreign traders here could come and go freely and act as they liked. It contained places that could not or would not fit into the districts, being home to warehouses, fisherfolk, and ship-builders that needed to be nearer the sea, as well as stables and facilities for training and caring for mounts and livestock that didn't belong to Procampan authorities. There were also cheaper inns and taverns that catered to travelers, as well as a number of small \"bed-and-beer\" houses that huddled around them. It could be a crowded and dank place, and in parts disreputable.\n\nThe port area was hemmed in by two stub walls off the main city walls that curved to meet the shore in a rough crescent. The district was some quarter-mile (400 meters) wide, and extended a significant distance up the coast. The city didn't have an easily controlled harbor mouth, making the harbor difficult to defend well. The north and south walls each had a pair of gates leading to the coast road, the [[High Trail]], and the [[North Road]].",
            "Locations & Establishments": "The following streets and shops were found in Procampur:\n* Scribes' Alley, Merchant District: [[Forgemaster]] [[Inkstain]]\n* Shards Street, Adventurers' District: [[Rendril's Forge]]\n* Leaping Dolphin Lane: [[Summergarth Facilitations]]\n\nThere were several inns and taverns that catered to locals, travelers and adventurers:\n* The [[Happy Hippocampus]]\n* The [[Silent Sword]]\n* The [[Griffin's Claw]]\n\nThere was also the [[Thayan Quarter]], which was the very first [[Thayan enclave]], founded in 1344 DR.\n\n[[Raven Express]] kept an office in Procampur, allowing communication via carrier-[[raven]] to its offices in other cities."
        },
        "Organizations": "Several organizations and adventuring bands were based in Procampur.\n\nOf the [[Harpers]], there were at least two resident agents, [[Opara Rendril]] and [[Halthara Summergarth]]. The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were of course represented at the Thayan Quarter.\n\nThough it lacked a thieves' guild, Procampur was home to its own [[assassin]]'s guild, a small and elite group called the [[Shadowkind]]. The [[Cabal of the Crown]] adventuring company was based in Procampur.",
        "Legends & Rumors": "Some items from the famous sage Thallastam's collection of magical swords were never found after his death, and were thought to still be hidden somewhere in Procampur.\n\nThe royal regalia of old Proeskampalar was said to be buried with King Meldath I of Impiltur, in his tomb in the [[Hill of Tombs]].\n\nBy 1372 DR, some people began to suspect that the Hamayarch, Alamondh, was unjust and less than truthful."
