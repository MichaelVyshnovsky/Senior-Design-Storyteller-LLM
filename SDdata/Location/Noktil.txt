'''Noktil''' was a village in the [[Cormyr/East Reaches|East Reaches]] of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
Noktil was a small, unchanging village of about 50 buildings.

==Geography==
The village lay along the [[Immerflow]], about halfway between [[Masoner's Bridge]] and the [[Wyvernwater]]. It was only a short distance from the [[Hullack Forest]].

==Government==
Noktil was administered from [[Arabel]] by the lord of Arabel.

==Trade==
Noktil was renowned for its [[bread]] and [[wood]] production, which was exported across Cormyr, but most of its trade was with [[Immersea]]. Three waterwheels on the Immerflow powered an assortment of [[flour]] mills, and the bakers of Nokil produced enough bread to send all across Cormyr. 

The wood was springy and malleable when green and extremely strong when dried, reputed to be the strongest in Cormyr. [[Bow]]s made with the wood had a terrifically hard pull, and were able to launch missiles with incredible range and power. The shafts of [[quarrel]]s and [[arrow]]s made with the wood were especially lethal, and reputed to be as strong as [[iron]]. Other bespoke woodworking products were exported to [[Suzail]], custom ordered by the wealthy nobility there.

The village had a single inn and an equipment shop, which traded in farm tools more than adventuring tools. [[Adventurer]]s and explorers arrived in the village every spring to prepare expeditions into the [[Hullack Forest]], which the locals did not appreciate due to the risk of a dangerous entity being roused and emerging from the forest.

==Defenses==
The village had no walls or other built defenses, and had a volunteer militia of locals who were primarily archers. Equipped with their masterwork bows, the militia had a reputation for exceptional accuracy despite not being professional soldiers.

==Rumors & Legends==
Around [[1367 DR]], rumor had it that a master [[elf|elven]] archer dwelt in Noktil, teaching the locals to craft their impressively strong bows and training their militia in expert archery techniques. The villagers refused to comment on such matters.
