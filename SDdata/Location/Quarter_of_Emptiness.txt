The '''Quarter of Emptiness''' was a stretch of particularly harsh landscape in the region of [[Anauroch]] known as [[the Sword]]. It was largely devoid of activity and notably absent of any of the desert's nomadic [[Bedine]].<ref name="FRCS3e-p99>

==Description==
This unforgiving area had little in the way of landmarks or points of interest. The expanse of open bedrock and sandy dunes had no plant life or other living inhabitants to speak of.

==Geography==
The region was located the southern stretch of the Sword, south of the [[Saiyaddar]], north of the [[Secret Place in the Sands]].

==Rumors & Legends==
In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], rumors circulated about an oasis within the Quarter of Emptiness, whose only inhabitants were vicious female spellcasters, ruled by a being that resembled a [[lamia noble]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Rasalith]], the ancient and ruined city that served as the region's only landmark.{{Template:Cite book/Lost Empires of Faerûn|106}}

==Inhabitants==
While the Quarter of Emptiness was nearly entirely uninhabited,
