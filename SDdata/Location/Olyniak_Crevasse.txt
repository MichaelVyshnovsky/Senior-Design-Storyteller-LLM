The '''Olyniak Crevasse''' was a crevasse located in the [[Nakvaligach]] region within the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
The Olyniak Crevasse was truly massive. At {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}} in width and several dozens miles deep, it was the largest crevasse in the Great Glacier. It was surrounded by the highest mountains in Nakvaligach. A layer of fluorescent minerals {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}} down illuminated the crevasse at night, giving off a faint green light.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-212}}, the [[white dragon]] [[Ufloq]] awoke in its lair located within the crevasse. Several dozen [[Nakulutiun]] witnessed the event, attracted to the crevasse by the loud rumbling. Many were promptly devoured by the hungry dragon. This is the only recorded sighting of Ufloq.
