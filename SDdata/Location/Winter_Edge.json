        "Geography": "The hamlet lay west of the [[Moonwood]] and east of the [[River Surbrin]], near to [[Mithral Hall]] where it lay in the [[Frost Hills]].",
        "History": "Winter Edge gained importance in the autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1370}} after King [[Obould]]'s [[orc]] army threatened the [[dwarves]] of Mithral Hall. Their allies at [[Citadel Felbarr]] marched an army to Winter Edge to aid them, making camp there, and King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] planned to link up with them at the Subrin. Later, in a meeting with Bruenor, [[Alustriel Silverhand]] of [[Silverymoon]] declared to turn the settlement into a military encampment and channel supplies and soldiers through Silverymoon and Winter's Edge to aid Mithral Hall, and to have Silvermoon's forces relieve Felbarr's.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the town came under attack by [[orc]]s from the [[Spine of the World]]."
