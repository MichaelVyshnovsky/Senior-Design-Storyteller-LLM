The '''Moonwood''' was a large forest north of [[Silverymoon]] in the [[Silver Marches]].

==Geography==
The Moonwood was located between Silverymoon and [[Mithral Hall]] and was bound by the [[River Surbrin]] to the west and the [[River Redrun]] to the northeast. Directly to the north of the Moonwood was the [[Druarwood]]; across the Redrun were the [[Night Trees]] forest groves and, beyond them, the [[Cold Wood]]. It was one of the woodlands that were collectively called the [[Moonwoods]] by some local folk.

By the mid–15{{th}} century [[DR]], these four woods had grown together and became known as Glimmerwood.

==Flora==
The Moonwood was dominated by [[wikipedia:evergreen|evergreens]], [[shadowtop]]s, and [[duskwood (tree)|duskwoods]].

==Inhabitants==
Although the Moonwood was known to be free of [[orc]]s and other [[goblinoid|goblinkind]],{{cite book/Champions of Ruin|79}} 

The southern section of the Moonwood was home to small bands of [[moon elves]].

==History==
During the rise of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]] in the {{yearlink|1370}}, orc tribes raided the outer edges of the forest for lumber. In retaliation, the [[pegasus]]-riding elf warrior [[Tarathiel]] attacked them.<ref>
