Ixitxachitl
Orilidren was one of the Six Holy Cities of the ixitxachitl nation in the Sea of Fallen Stars known as the Xedran Reefs.
Like all of the chitl cities, Orilidren consisted of a huge warren of tunnels and subcaverns. This included a central entrance to the surface, with passages riddled in traps, and large cavern beneath that site with a great temple to Ilxendren around which the rest of the city grew outward from.
There stood an outbuilding near the temple for the Devitans personal slaves, at least four caverns on the outskirts of the city in which other slaves were kept, two military garrisons, and at least four public shrines on the city outskirts that were deciated to Ilxendren. 
Around the 3 to 9 day of Lifesong, in , the holy cities of Ageadren and Orilidren were attacked by the rampaging forces of Iakhovas in the midst of what would come to be known as the Twelfth Serôs War. These forces would go on to destroy the two cities supporting temples at Ilramas, Ilkanar, Ilphaeth, and Ilteon.
Unlike Ageadren, Orilidren would be only partially destroyed during the Twelfth Serôs War. However, it was fall out of ixitxachitl hands, being claimed by koalinths that had once been allied with Iakhovas.
Around 1370 DR, Orilidren was home to a population of 300 koalinths.
