The Gate of Wealth was one of the entrances into Huzuz, the City of Delights.
The Gate of Wealth was located within the Affluent District of Huzuz. It was comprised of two smaller gates.
Though caravans and common pilgrims used this gate, the vast majority of individuals passing through the Gate of Wealth were rich young nobles in search of entertainment.
At sunset, one of the gates was closed and the other left halfway open in case stumbling nobles needed to get back home during the dead of night.
Smuggling activity was common here when compared to the other gates of Huzuz.
