'''Warriors' Monument,''' also occasionally known as the '''Warriors of Waterdeep''', was a monument in [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] meant to honor all those who ever fought to defend the city.

==Description==
Carved of stone and standing roughly {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} tall, In addition to being an intricate statue, the monument acted as a fountain, with water gushing out from wounds on its stone figures.

It depicted a group of [[warrior]]s in a circular formation, three men and two women, striking down hordes of enemies that were falling backward and outward from their circle. These enemies included [[barbarian]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[orc]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[bugbear]]s. A later addition to the monument was a warrior riding upon a [[griffin]], high above the other stone figures, and [[spear]]ing a [[Night rider|skeletal knight]] with a [[breastplate]] bearing the symbol of [[Myrkul]].

==History==
In [[1361 DR]], three years following the event known as the [[Time of Troubles]], Warriors' Monument was renovated and magically altered to feature a minion of Myrkul. This addition was meant to commemorate those who perished fighting against the death god's invasion of Waterdeep.
