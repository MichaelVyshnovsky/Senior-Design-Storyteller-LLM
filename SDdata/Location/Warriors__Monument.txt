Warriors Monument, also occasionally known as the Warriors of Waterdeep, was a monument in Waterdeeps City of the Dead meant to honor all those who ever fought to defend the city.
Carved of stone and standing roughly  tall, In addition to being an intricate statue, the monument acted as a fountain, with water gushing out from wounds on its stone figures.
It depicted a group of warriors in a circular formation, three men and two women, striking down hordes of enemies that were falling backward and outward from their circle. These enemies included barbarians, hobgoblins, orcs, trolls, and bugbears. A later addition to the monument was a warrior riding upon a griffin, high above the other stone figures, and spearing a skeletal knight with a breastplate bearing the symbol of Myrkul.
In 1361 DR, three years following the event known as the Time of Troubles, Warriors Monument was renovated and magically altered to feature a minion of Myrkul. This addition was meant to commemorate those who perished fighting against the death gods invasion of Waterdeep.
