        "mainbody": "he Twin Songs was a district of the Outer City of Baldurs Gate, located on the northern side of the Wyrms Crossing bridge. It was an expansive collection of minor temples, shrines and altars dedicated to nearly every deity, particularly those that were considered dark and malevolent. In fact, it had monuments dedicated to more deities than most Baldurians were even aware existed.\nThe district was wholly devoted to worship of the divine. As such, services of clerics from nearly every faith were readily available.\nLike the other districts that were located on the shores of the River Chionthar, Twin Songs had a number of boatmen who could ferry them to other quays and docks within the city.\nA gang associated with The Guild called \"The Faithless\", which was run by Kingpin Straightstick, operated in this area. They also acted as smugglers, moving goods along the river or across Dusthawk Hill into the city, usually into Brampton.\n* Church of Last Hope This sanctuary was not dedicated to any particular faith, but rather served those who suffered from hopelessness, emotional suffering, and fatal illnesses."
