Ishe was a small community located in the far northeast of Vaasa.
Ishe was dismally cold and was noted as being the last (mostly) civilized stop for those planning to follow the Howling Kupuk trail north toward the Great Glacier. 
The village sat on the windswept westerly ridges of the northern end of the Galena Mountains, just below where they met the eastern end of the Lugsaas Chain. It lay along the trail that headed north toward the Howling Kupuk pass to Frohms Rest and south toward either Palischuk or the High Walk to Ironspur.
Ishe was the furthest northeastern settlement in Vaasa proper. As of , the edge of the Great Glacier sat south of the Lugsaas Chain, just a few hours north of the village. Because the Glacier continued to retreat northward over the decades, by the late 15 century DR explorers had to travel to the Surykyk Range approximately 75 miles (120 km) north of the village to arrive at the edge.
*The Frozen Finger, the only inn in the village as well as the only reliable place to buy adventuring equipment.
The local populace was a motley collection of mountain folk, trappers, prospectors, and down-on-their-luck derelicts. They were notably risk-averse, especially when it came to venturing even further north toward or into the Great Glacier. As a result, they had developed something of a reputation for cowardliness among adventurers and explorers who sought local guides from the village.
In the mid&ndash14 century DR, notable members of Ishe included
* Vurl, the innkeeper.
* Kahil Brogman, a guide and conman.
