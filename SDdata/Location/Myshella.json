        "mainbody": "yshella was an ancient Netherese city that fell to attack during the last years of Netheril. It was buried and ruined by the 14 century DR.\nBy the 14 century DR, all that remained of Myshella was in a crevice underneath a hill in Atars Looking Glass. Most of the space was too full of sand to recover with any effectiveness.\nThe defenses of the city were mostly magical. However, most of the walls were reinforced against all magic. Despite this precaution, a powerful lifedrain effect leaked out of the ruin, slowly killing anyone who wandered close to the crevasse even in the 14 century DR.\nAt some point, Myshella possessed a number of diviners. The phaerimm planned on sending a deadly weapon against Myshella to level the city the diviners failed to foresee the phaerimm weapon was immune to all magic and bore a permanent lifedrain effect in its magic-immune heart. Thus, much of Myshella was ruined before one of its inhabitants, Garavan, came up with the idea of building a nonmagical device, a Light Pump, to fight back.\nHowever, the Light Pump was still unused as of the 14 century DR, in a room with a statue of Azuth. The Phaerimm weapon was neutralized by the sacrifice of six of the citys greatest mages. The section where the weapon was neutralized was a temple, later guarded by a greater mummy serving Ilmater.\nBy the 14 century, not much remained beyond a temple, which held an archaic statue of Azuth, despite the fact that his ascension post-dated the fall of Netheril. The temple still held some information, the corpse of a treasure-seeker, and some inexplicable curios, such as Rocky XXVI in laser-disc and four translations of the Necronomicon. Those may have been a result of the citys forays into chronomancy. The lifedrain strengthened once inside the ruins, quickly draining the life out of anyone inside.\nA few obstacles and traps, still functional, barred the way to an inner chamber with three doors forward. One of them led to a fiery trap, the other to an illusion of Dispater threatening death, and the last to a room with three tables set on it, all of them covered in a variety of yellow mold that resembled gold. A secret door required a special key to open the way to a guardian, a greater mummy and priest of Ilmater, who would fight only evil trespassers. The mummy would not explain the circumstances of the situation, but would allow people to pass to the final chamber.\nIn the final chamber, six of the mightiest mages of Myshella had sacrificed themselves in a ritual to stop a stone juggernaut which was the source of the lifedrain the agents of Cormyr would also find the body of Sabkhat el Talab there. These mages were already impeding the lifedrain harshly the slightest disturbance would render the area instantly uninhabitable, slaying everyone in the temple within minutes.\nPer a nearby serpent lord, Myshella dedicated itself to \"cutting-edge magical research\". The city was extant in the times of said serpent lords grand-sire.\n* Garavan"
