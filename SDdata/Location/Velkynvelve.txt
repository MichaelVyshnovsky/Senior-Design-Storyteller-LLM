'''Velkynvelve''' ("unseen knife" in the [[Drow language]]) was a small [[drow]] outpost of the city of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was specifically used to collect [[slave]]s captured in various raids before taking them to the city as workers or sacrifices to [[Lolth]].

==Inhabitants==
The commander of the outpost was [[Ilvara Mizzrym]] of [[House Mizzrym]] and her senior officials were [[Shoor Vandree]] and [[Asha Vandree]] of [[House Vandree]] and [[Jorlan Duskryn]] of [[House Duskryn]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], there was a great escape of prisoners. Some months later, the command was given to the wizard [[Servan Llarabbar]].
