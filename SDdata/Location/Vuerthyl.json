        "mainbody": "Vuerthyl was an artificially-created oasis in Anauroch, that was created by the Zhentarim, and was a stop along the Black Road.\nThe oasis comprised a number of fruit trees that grew atop an underground reservoir. Like many of the Zhentarim-made oases, Vuerthyl was formed using a decanter of endless water.\nVuerthyl was located in the northwestern region of the Sword, north of the Jackal Hills. \nThe oasis outpost was manned by seven journeyman Zhentarim wizards and a contingent of 20 veteran Zhentilar soldiers.\nAt some point, the Zhents at Vuerthyl discovered a great wealth of naturally-occurring beryl and emeralds hidden away in the reservoir beneath the oasis. While digging beneath the ground they unwittingly released a mind flayer that had been imprisoned beneath the sands, a being that was since out on the loose."
