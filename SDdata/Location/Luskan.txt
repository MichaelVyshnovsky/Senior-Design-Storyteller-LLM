'''Luskan''', also known as the '''City of Sails''', was a port city at the mouth of the [[River Mirar]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. Luskan, despite the presence of the [[Ten Towns]], was considered by many to be civilization's farthest reach.

Although once a bustling city, in the days prior to the [[Spellplague]], the city would suffer greatly at the hands of [[Arklem Greeth]]. The resulting disaster would allow the Spellplague to nearly annihilate the city, with it having only a fraction of its former populace.{{fact}}

{{quote|''Tucked like a gold filling (or some would say a pus-filled abscess) at the mouth of the River Mirar, Luskan is a city of merchant princesses, swarthy bandit princes, and the most diverse, cutthroat, and fractured cabal of pirates on Toril. Torn into factions, these piratical groups are known as "Ships."''|Excerpt from ''[[Corsairs of Luskan]]''}}

==Geography==
As of [[1370 DR]], the city was split into northern and southern halves by the River Mirar, and these were connected by the bridges [[Dalath's Span]], [[Harbor Cross]], and the [[Upstream Span]].{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the North|113}} Other than the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], the city was dominated by two- and three-story buildings.

The city and its five inhabited islands sat in the mouth of the [[River Mirar]], on the [[Mirarmouth Bay]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2024-05-10/Mirar Bay}} Three of these were inhabited: [[Cutlass Island]] (upon which lay the Host Tower of the Arcane, and which was connected to both sides of the river by bridges), [[Closeguard Island]] (which housed [[Ship Kurth]] and was connected to the southern bank by a bridge), and [[Blood Island]] (which housed Luskan's army garrison). The remaining uninhabited islands were [[Fang Island]] (named for its treacherous rocks) and [[Harbor Arm Island]] (which sheltered the city's harbor).

===Northern Bank===
[[File:Luskan.png|thumb|''Luskan at night.'']]
The northern section was walled and was almost entirely made up of warehouses. The [[Mirabar District]] (also known as the Mirabar Shield) was a fortified compound operated by the merchants of [[Mirabar]], and it contained the [[Throat]], the city's heavily guarded main water tower, which was situated in a grazing area for sheep.), was situated on the northern bank, as was the ''[[North Gate (Luskan)|North Gate]]'', the portal between the northern and southern banks. 

The docks on the northern bank were on the sea coast (western part of the city) and consisted of [[Whitesails Harbor]], used exclusively for the Luskan navy, and the unprotected [[Open Shore]], which was situated outside the city walls and was the only place foreign shipping could dock.

===South Bank===
[[File:Luskan South Bank - Valerie Valusek.png|thumb|300px|''The dingy streets of the South Bank.'']]
As of 1370 DR, the southern bank consisted of a heavily fortified inner section surrounded by caravan compounds. The southern bank also housed stables, the Captains' and High [[Captains' Court]], the Market and the [[Prisoners' Carnival]], and the town's original harbor, [[Dragon Beach]], a lawless place where even soldiers feared to tread

==Outlook==
[[Sammereza Sulphontis]] said that traders in Luskan "always wear furs, haughty expressions, and ready swords." Luskanite traders were always alert and well-armed. The people of Luskan always tended to be tense and paranoid—rightly so, because of the dangers of the tough city—and they were extremely prejudiced against non-humans. In fact, few non-humans were allowed past the city gates.

==Government==
As of [[1372 DR]], the city was officially ruled by the five [[High Captains (Luskan)|High Captains]], all former pirate lords and each of which led a faction called a "ship" named after its respective captain: [[Ship Taerl]], [[Ship Baram]], [[Ship Kurth]], [[Ship Suljack]] and [[Ship Rethnor]]. The true power in the city resided with the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].

The High Captains encouraged the harassment of the trading routes of small cities such as [[Mirabar]], [[Neverwinter]], and [[Ruathym]], and made sure to avoid conflict with [[Waterdeep]] and [[Amn]] because they were too powerful.

The Arcane Brotherhood also encouraged local traders to treat travelers with disdain and suspicion, due to the possibility that they may be spies for their enemies, often sending low-level agents to follow strangers personally.

Luskan was rumored to be allied with the [[Zhentarim]] but no evidence of this was ever presented.

By [[1480 DR]] there was no true functioning government and gangs (including the Ships of the High Captains) carved out territories within the city.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6534}}

Some time after [[1485 DR]], the five High Captains who ruled the city started to conduct legal sea trade across the Sword Coast. They also protected the city and raided the island kingdoms to the west. Secretly, the High Captains were under the sway of [[Jarlaxle Baenre|Jarlaxle]] and the [[Bregan D'aerthe]].<ref>  

==Relationships==
Although Luskan and [[Ruathym]] were often enemies, they had an alliance known as the [[Captains' Alliance]].

==Trade==
[[File:Luskan Pirate King.png|thumb|''Luskan circa [[1377 DR]].''|400x400px]]
Luskan was the gateway to the lands northward and as such was a perfect market for ore from the [[Spine of the World]] and [[scrimshaw]] from the [[Ten Towns]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

As of [[1370 DR]], Luskan was the main shipyard for [[Mirabar]]. Trade with such places as [[Amn]] and [[Calimshan]] was carried out on the neutral ground offshore from [[Mintarn]] because it was not desirable to be associated with Luskan.

As of 1370 DR, the city's market only allowed stalls by permit. These were only given to Luskan companies, and those outsiders who were closely watched. The main offerings at the market were fresh goods, firewood and trinkets.

After Bregan D'aerthe took over the city, they began trading [[Netherese]] artifacts to [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Militia==
As of 1370 DR, Luskan had an army of 300 spearmen and a navy of 19 dragonships. The dragonships were each armed with 70 archers. The North Gate was guarded by soldiers with spears and crossbows; in the winter they wore fur caps.

==Piracy==
While not at war, Luskan ships of war carried out independent piracy against shipping destined for other ports, with the aim of increasing trade with Luskan. While this contravened Luskan law as of 1370 DR, the pirates were actually supplied and directed by the high captains themselves.

==History==
===Pre-Spellplague===
Built on the ruins of the ancient and magical city of [[Illusk]], Luskan was a port town frequented by pirates, thieves and other disreputable folk interested in money. Although life within its walls was dangerous, Luskan was a very lucrative city. Pirates brought in their goods to be sold to the black market, northern traders frequented the place as a rest stop on their way to the [[Ten Towns]] during the warmer months, ready to buy exotic [[scrimshaw]] ornaments, several taverns traded in [[ale]] and other spirits, the drugs and slave trades were rife (although obviously sublimated) and information brokers and [[prostitute]]s plied their trade during the night-time.

There was a period in Luskan's history during which dwarves from [[Mirabar]] would paint Luskan sheep different colours in acts of defiance, but as of 1370 DR this practice had ended after savage reprisals from the Luskanites.

Luskan had a history of waging war against lesser naval powers, It withdrew when faced with war against the [[Lords' Alliance]]. Luskan has previously been defeated by [[Gundarlun]], [[Lantan]], [[Mintarn]], [[Orlumbor]] and [[Tuern]]. The conflict against Lantan was disastrous enough that inhabitants of Luskan did not even acknowledge its happening. Inland, Luskan would attack [[Mirabar]] and the tribes of [[Uthgardt]] in order to keep them submissive.

In the autumn of [[1376 DR]] Luskan was attacked by an army of mercenaries led by Lord [[Brambleberry]] of Waterdeep and aided by the famous Captain [[Deudermont]]. The attack destroyed the Hosttower and the grateful populace installed Deudermont as their governor. Although he tried to rebuild as many homes as possible before winter set in, supplies were scarce and most food came via Ship Rethnor in the form of a strange tangy meat and edible fungus. People were being murdered every day for this food and those who weren't prepared to kill for it, starved. When supplies from Waterdeep were sent to aid Deudermont's new city the land caravans were attacked by bandits paid for by Ship Rethnor and the fleet of trading ships that was supposed to dock was attacked by Arklem Greeth, who had (unknown to all) survived the Hosttower's destruction. Barely any of the supplies arrived and then Kensidan had Suljack murdered, which sparked off a street war among the hungry masses and guards who had been bribed by Ships Rethnor and Kurth. At the same time Arklem Greeth attacked ''[[Sea Sprite]]''. When Deudermont's corpse was found, it was all over. The survivors fled the city, leaving the four remaining captains to rule over the place, though Kensidan and Kurth would dominate Baram and Taerl. Luskan would become a free port, a place of trade where absolutely no questions would ever be asked.

Unknown to most, much of the resources and intelligence that led to this outcome were provided by [[Bregan D'aerthe]] who, once more led by [[Jarlaxle]], wanted to share in the profits the free port would hopefully produce.

===Post-Spellplague===
In the years after the [[Spellplague]], Luskan fell into ruin. Over the next century, the rulership of the city changed from hand to claw to hand so many times that it would be nigh-impossible to document them in any kind of detail. The result was a mockery of a true city. Most buildings were ruined and murderers and demon-worshipers roamed the streets freely, plying their trade in broad daylight. Wretched tribes of [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s skulked in the shadows and the fetid bog that was once the estuary of the [[River Mirar]] was infested with aquatic horrors. The place became a haven for escaped criminals who, while escaping punishment for their crimes would likely die on the end of a psychopath's blade or a monster's claw.{{fact}} Bregan D'aerthe continued their semi-secret domination of the city and its trading markets, associating with [[Ship Kurth]]. Indeed, one of their agents, [[Beniago]], in guise of a human, became High Captain Kurth.

In [[1483 DR]], the city and its bridges were in disrepair. The [[Red Dragon Trading Post]] was no longer in operation, but [[Baliver's House of Horses]] still was, housing a pony for 3 silver coins per night.

==Notable Locations==
===Host Tower of the Arcane===
The [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] was the site of real power in the city until shortly before the Spellplague. In [[1372 DR]], [[Arklem Greeth]] presided over around 130 mages. While delegating laws to the High Captains, the arcanists within partook in their studies and bouts of infighting.{{fact}} The tower itself resembled a tree with four "limbs" (spires) and exuded a magical aura that many residents found so uncomfortable that they purposely avoid looking at it.

===The Cutlass===
The [[Cutlass (inn)|Cutlass]] was one of the busiest taverns in the city, a haven for the crews of the pirate ships that docked in the harbor as well as the escorts whom they spend their share of the booty on. The famed [[barbarian]] [[Wulfgar]] spent some time working here as a bouncer. It was located close to the lawless harbor, the [[Dragon Beach]].

===The Royal Arms Inn===
[[Royal Arms|The Royal Arms]] was an expensive and luxurious inn that served only the finest foods and drinks, often favored by rich traders and dignitaries.

===Seven Sails Inn===
The [[Seven Sails Inn]] was an establishment on [[Setting Sun Street]] where one could actually get some sleep. However, it was also a place closely watched by the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].{{fact}}

===Prisoners' Carnival===
The [[Prisoners' Carnival]] was Luskan's "court" of justice, although truly it was just a public spectacle of torture and execution. It was located in the most public part of town: the Market.

===Rat Alley===
[[Rat Alley]] was narrow alley crowded by trash, such as crates, and lined on both sides by low storehouses. It was the perfect place for thieves in hiding.

===Ruins of Illusk===
Some of the ruins of the city that Luskan was built atop of still existed until quite recently, namely on the western side of the South Bank not far from the Host Tower of the Arcane. Most folks stayed away from the ruins as wandering undead, restless spirits of [[Illusk]], were known to prey on the drunks and adventurers who got too close to the hidden passageways to the old city.{{fact}} Crumbled walls and moss-grown statues remained. By [[1474 DR]], [[Bregan D'aerthe]] had set up their secret headquarters in Illusk, with a path connecting Illusk with Closeguard Isle and Ship Kurth.

===One-Eyed Jax===
[[One-Eyed Jax]] was a post-Spellplague inn and tavern on the northern bank named for [[Jarlaxle]] of [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. It was overtly owned and protected by Ship [[Kurth]] (which was in fact an arm of [[Bregan D'aerthe]]). It was one of the most reliable inns for foreigners, although it was often populated with [[drow]].

===The Winter Palace===
In the post-sundering era, the temple of [[Auril]] was a great complex adorned with soaring white spires. It had no roof, but was an open court filled with white stone pillars and arches. Its rituals seemed overtly cruel to those not of Auril's faith.
*One of the most well known rituals were the [[wet parades]]. The parades involved the wearing of garments stuffed with ice. While wearing these garments, participants would race through the streets of Luskan to climb six white pillars, called the Kisses of Auril. They would climb the pillars to kiss the iron plates located at the top of each spire. During the winter, [[frostbite (condition)|frostbite]] and physical injury are quite common during these climbs due to the ice stuffed clothes and slippery pillars. Those who complete this race are believed to have assuaged Auril's wrath, bringing an easy winter. The participants are given free food and drink all winter long by Luskan's inhabitants.
