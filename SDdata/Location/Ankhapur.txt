Ankhapur was a city located in the Lake of Steam region on the southern edge of interior Faer√ªn.
The city was primarily known for its pearl industry, which involved many of its citizens.
There were a number of tressym in the city. Curiously, on the day before Highsummer each year, every tressym in the city mysteriously disappeared only to return three days later.
In 1366 DR, Manferic III ruled Ankhapur with an iron hand and a touch of sadism. He became a lich and sought to inhabit the body of Janol Famisso, a bastard son of his. In his attempt, Manferic killed his other heirs while controlling Janols body in order to inherit the throne from himself. However, thanks to a cleric of Lathander, Lissa, and others, Manferic was destroyed by Janol and his allies.
With no other heirs left, Janol took the crown.
