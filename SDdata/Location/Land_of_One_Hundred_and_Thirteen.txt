The '''Land of One Hundred and Thirteen''' was a pocket dimension carved out of [[Fury's Heart]] by [[Marek Rymüt]], a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard of Thay]] in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. Marek gave it this name because it took 113 days to pacify it and make is usable.

==Description==
The terrain of the pocket dimension resembled a typical subtropical area of Toril. However, the shapes it formed were more angular and the rivers appeared to work in straight lines and right angles. The area of the dimension was larger than the city-state of [[Innarlith]]. It had a lake, mountains and a swamp inside of it.<ref>

==History==
Marek had formerly been using an area underneath the city of Innarlith to raise the mutant offspring of the [[black dragon]] [[Insithryllax]] and female [[firedrake]]s, which he called "[[black firedrake]]s". However, he was having trouble getting enough food to feed them, and some of the black firedrakes found a way out of the nursery and into the city itself, creating havoc and mayhem.<ref>

Marek carved out the pocket dimension and pacified it, before teleporting the black firedrakes to the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen, where they feasted on the local fauna, including huge worms that Marek called "Fury's Grubs". Insithryllax also came to the pocket dimension and helped Marek with his plans to raise the drakes. 

Marek grew and developed his army of black firedrakes within the pocket dimension. He also use polymorphed black firedrakes to build a keep there for himself along with other structures that resembled a village. In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, he brought Senator [[Salatis]] to the pocket dimension and showed him his army of black firedrakes. Marek made deal with Salatis in the pocket dimension, that he would give him the firedrakes in order to help him take power in Innarlith and in exchange, Salatis would do whatever Marek asked him to do. Salatis thus became a puppet of the Red Wizard. Marek then followed through on his side of the deal and gave Salatis use of the drakes while Salatis launched a coup in Innarlith that secured power for himself as the new Ransar. <ref>

During the [[Rage of Dragons]] that occurred in [[1373 DR]], Marek teleported Insithryllax back into the pocket dimension from Innarlith when he realized that Insithryllax was losing control of himself and might have gone on a rampage across Innarlith. Marek kept Insithryllax there for months before Insithryllax convinced him he would be able to keep control of himself if he was allowed to return to Toril. Marek then brought him back and Insithryllax then departed from Innarlith and flew home to Thay. <ref>

==Fauna==
A lake in this pocket dimension held demonic giant eel–like fish that created electricity with their bodies that ate the black firedrakes when they came too close. Marek took interest in these after Insithryllax pointed them out to him and tamed them. He later transported two of them to the harbor in Innarlith in order to attack a [[Shou]] merchant named [[Ran Ai Yu]] who had refused his offer to magically teleport her boat back to [[Shou Lung]]. These fish were killed by the merchant and some of her friends.<ref>

A kind of fat giant worm was commonly found in the landscape and had become a favorite food to the black firedrakes after they were moved there. Marek named them "Fury's Grubs".
