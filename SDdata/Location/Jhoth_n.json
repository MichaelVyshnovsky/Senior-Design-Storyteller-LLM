        "Description": "While not large, Jhothûn was a powerful empire of giantkind. Its people mastered great magics, which allowed them to keep their lands in perpetual cold. [[Portal]]s connected the four major cities of the empire.",
        "Geography": "Jhothûn was located in the north of Faerûn, from the [[Yal Tengri]] in the east to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] in the west. Its capital, also called [[Jhothûn (city)|Jhothûn]], was located somewhere in the region of the [[Endless Ice Sea]]. It had three provinces. The first was located in the area of the Sea of Moving Ice and claimed [[Karffbadh]] as its capital. The second province was in the vicinity of the [[High Ice]] and had [[Choshein]] for a capital. [[Gharreil]] was the provincial seat of the [[Great Glacier]] region.",
        "Government": "The emperor of Jhothûn reigned supreme and under him were three provincial rulers, called satraps, in similar manner to ancient [[Calimshan]]. Jhothûn society included a strange relationship with ice [[genie]]s called [[qorrash]]. The qorrash served as advisers, titled as \"princes of Jhothûn\".",
        "Inhabitants": "The giants of Jhothûn were the ancestors of modern [[frost giant]]s.",
        "History": "Jhothûn was an empire long before even the first [[Elf|elven]] kingdom came into existence.<ref group=\"note\">While it is not explicitly stated in the web source, it is reasonable to assume that Jhothûn was a sub-empire of [[Ostoria]] founded by [[Ottar]], as described in the ''[[Giantcraft]]'' sourcebook. Not much is known about the history of the empire, except that it eventually fell because of rebellion amongst its satraps followed by attacks from [[white dragon]]s who took advantage of the situation.",
