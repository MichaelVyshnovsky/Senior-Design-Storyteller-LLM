        "mainbody": "Skull Island was an island located south of Skullport.\nSkull Island was an island fortress and was located in the center of Skull Pool on the River Sargauth. A significant portion of the island was encircled by a -high defensive wall. The walls were constructed from quarried stone sourced from the nearby caverns. Along the wall were fifteen square towers, each equipped with medium-sized ballistae and incendiary devices. A wooden pier extended along the islandâ€™s eastern side, providing a safe harbor for ships.\nSkull Island featured two natural harbors. One was located on the eastern coast of the island, called Parley Pool. The other, larger one was called The Maw and was located on the western coast of the island.\nSkull Island was connected to Skullport proper via the Murkspan Bridge. The Skull Island side of the bridge was heavily guarded.\nDuring the summer months, when the tides receded, the base of the island became partially visible, revealing a series of natural caves positioned just above and below the waterline. \nThe Iron Ring, a consortium of the most powerful slavers in Skullport, exercised complete control over all activities on the island, maintaining strict oversight and authority over its operations. The leader of the Iron Ring occupied the Tower of Seven Woes.\nSkull Island was the heart of the slave trade in Skullport. Captives were brought to the School of Obedience and processed, preparing them for a life of slavery. They were given an assesment of their physical and mental abilities, and then branded. After a short period, up to a tenday, the captives were brought to the Slavers Market to be sold.\nThe island fortress was secured by a contingent of over 200 guards, who patrolled the perimeter walls, safeguarding the internal structures, and oversaw the captive labor force. In addition to operating the defensive artillery, the tower guards were equipped with broadswords and light crossbows.\nThe slave pens were heavily guarded. Only the most ruthless guards were assigned to watch the slaves. They wore heavy armor and carried clubs, broadswords and nets.\nThe guards maintained a high standard of discipline and morale, supported by favorable compensation. Instances of guards sleeping while on duty, taking unauthorized breaks, or acting without notifying their superiors were exceedingly rare, reflecting their commitment to maintaining order and security.\nThe guards lived on the island within a two-story barracks. When not on duty or in training, they were often found on leave in Skullport.\nAmong the caves visible during low tide, was one believed to descend deep beneath the island, leading to a network of chambers lined with mithral. These chambers were rumored to contain a treasure left by the ancient Melairkyn clan."
