'''Freedale''' was a town in [[Shadowdale]].

==Geography ==
Freedale was located around 15 miles to the south-east from the village of [[Shadowdale]] on a minor trail that ran along the [[River Ashaba]] all the way to [[Ashabenford]].

==History==
[[File:Town crier.png|thumb|''A town crier from Freedale reading from a [[scroll]] with the day's announcements after blowing his [[horn]].'']]
Freedale was founded on the area that was, at some in the past, cleared by [[Sembia]]n woodcutters harvesting valuable wood. The creation of the settlement was an attempt to create a new town in the [[Dalelands]] or expand Shadowdale. The township was governed by their own elected lordship, independent from Shadowdale. The village was named Freedale and, by [[1359 DR]], expanded enough to have wharves and had its highest population. 

Unfortunately, by [[1374 DR]], after the resettlement of [[Myth Drannor]], the people of Freedale were in decline, possibly due to the elves of Myth Drannor frowning upon a town built on an area that was a beautiful forest once. By the late [[1400 DR|1400s DR]], the village still existed mostly in just name and consisted of several log cabins inhabited by human households that lived off the land. As the forests slowly reclaimed the mostly abandoned hamlet, the remaining inhabitants survived by harvesting [[mushroom]]s, edible [[moss]]es, and various [[herb]]s. The harvested items were often sold to traveling merchant caravans who passed through the village towards Shadowdale. In 1400s DR, the town did not have rulers nor lords and was largely forgotten, remaining nothing but a few scarce cabins and one working wharf.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210131215633/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1221189608546951170| title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 31-01-2020| date = 31-01-2020}}
