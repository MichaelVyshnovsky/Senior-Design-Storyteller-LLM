        "Geography": "Firedrake rested on the westernmost tip of the peninsula, known as the [[Dragon's Head]]. It was one of the counties of the [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|Duchy]] of [[Cape Velen]], along with [[Fyraven]] and [[Greenshores]] farther to the east.\n\nThe county takes its name from [[Firedrake Bay]], which rested between the Dragon's Neck and [[Starspire Peninsula|Starspire]] Peninsulas.",
        "Government": "Firedrake was governed by [[Ondul Jarduth]] in [[1370 DR]] from his manor house of [[Millvuthan]] in [[Velen]], but he was often absent, working instead at [[Tordraken]] or [[Faerntarn]].",
        "Notable Locations": "The haunted city of Velen was the most notable settlement in the county."
