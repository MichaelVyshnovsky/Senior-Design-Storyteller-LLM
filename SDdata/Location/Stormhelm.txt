Stormhelm was the capital and the only proper city of the kingdom of Eskorn, Laerakond.
As of 1479 DR, Stormhelm was ruled by King Ornan Roaryl. When he was traveling, the king appoint his trusted servant, Lord Mreskan Haundle, as his seneschal.
Stormhelm architecture was dominated by a haphazard stone layout, with many undeveloped areas and forested zones instead of blocks of buildings. The city was unwalled and had muddy roads flanked by gravel footpaths.
Its largest building was a stone fortress called the Throne Hall, home of the royal family.
Stormhelm was named after a legendary human hero who fought and died during the rebellion against Eskornamundyr. The city was originally a dragon settlement made by dwarven slaves, and rebuilt by humans after Eskorn gained its freedom.
