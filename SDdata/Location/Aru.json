        "mainbody": "'''Aru''' was a town on the island of [[Tsukishima]] and part of the nation of [[Wa]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. ''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], it was a center of worship of [[Bishamon]] and [[pilgrim]]s from all over Wa traveled here. Aru was capital of the [[Aru Province]].",
        "Geography": "Aru was quite an isolated settlement, lying in a remote part of the northwestern coast of Tsukishima, huddled in the foothills of the [[Ikuyu Mountains]]. It was a difficult journey to reach Aru, as one had to traverse some of the most rugged passes of the mountains.\n\nThe small [[Aru (river)|Aru river]] provided fresh water to the area.",
        "History": {
            "Precursor": "Aru began as a small shrine to Bishamon, and though only a few dedicated monks resided there, pilgrims still made the long and difficult journey to visit it, in small but consistent numbers. Thus it was for centuries. Since there were no facilities, the pilgrims simply camped and endured the elements during their stay. Eventually, however, owing to the increasing number of pilgrims falling victim to the tough journey and austere living, with a few dying each year, the monks erected buildings on the site to allow them to stay in greater comfort.\n\nThrough a combination of pilgrims settling permanently and people setting up businesses to make a profit providing services to the pilgrims, the settlement began to grow. Over a few decades, a town grew up around the shrine, but it remained unrecognized by Wa's rulers and had no [[Wa-an_dictionary#D|daimyo]] or official government of its own. Instead, the people were labelled \"support staff\" for the shrine. The monks used their skills, such as in martial arts, to maintain law and order and to protect the population from threats such as bandits.\n\nMeanwhile, the shrine continued to grow as a result of donations, becoming a small temple and then a larger temple. The Shining Temple of Bishamon had taken shape by [[1176 DR|Wa Year 1594 (1176 DR)]], and its renown attracted yet more pilgrims and tourists.",
            "Founding": "Finally, in [[1190 DR|Wa Year 1608 (1190 DR)]], the shogun [[Eiko]] officially recognized the settlement (now a small city) and named it \"Aru\" after the Aru river. Furthermore, he decreed it the capital of the new Aru Province (cleaved off the existing [[Jasuga Province]]) and appointed [[Arata Matsutomo]], head of the completely loyal [[Matsutomo]] clan, as its first daimyo; the Matsutomos dutifully relocated to Aru. Arata served ably for two decades, until [[1209 DR|Wa Year 1627 (1209 DR)]], when bandits aided by unidentified supernatural creatures ([[tengu]] being one possibility) massacred a large pilgrim train in one of the mountain passes. The shogun reprimanded Arata for this failure of security. The [[1210 DR|next year]], Arata's samurai guarded the next pilgrim train, but they too were attacked and slaughtered to a man. The shogun removed Arata and the Matsutomos from power.\n\nNext, the daimyate went to [[Sousuke Toda]], of the newly arrived [[Toda]] clan. Sousuke led well and Aru enjoyed a decade of peace. When Sousuke died in a hunting accident, his 17-year-old son [[Eiji Toda|Eiji]] became daimyo; he was eager to do well but inexperienced. The following three years saw resurgent bandits devastate the pilgrim trains, though shogun [[Takahiro]] forgave Eiji because of his age and inexperience. Then, in [[1222 DR|Wa Year 1640 (1222 DR)]], a foreign raiding party (possibly from [[Shou Lung]]) made through the daimyo's defenses to Aru's outskirts and razed part of the ''Eta'' District. This failure was too great and Eiji was removed.\n\nThe shogun returned Aru to the Matsutomo clan, now under [[Koji Matsutomo]]. A weak man, Koji was liked by peasants but hated by rival nobles who'd moved to Aru. He survived two attempted coups in [[1227 DR|Wa Years 1645 (1227 DR)]] and [[1231 DR|1649 (1231 DR)]], and thereafter focused only on protecting himself and his clan. As a result, he neglected the province's administration and corruption got out of control. When in [[1234 DR|Wa Year 1652 (1234 DR)]] the annual shipment of tax payments at [[Uwaji]] was 30% less than reported on the manifest, Koji was removed.This may be in error in another way: Uwaji was not the capital of Wa at the time, instead, [[Iiso]] is.",
            "Modern History": "Next, the daimyate passed to [[Seiji Kubahachi]]; the [[Kubahachi]] clan ruled well for two generations. However, the third daimyo, [[Koji Kubahachi]], was cruel and vindictive. In [[1295 DR|Wa Year 1713 (1295 DR)]], when he levied a special tax to pay for castle improvements and a certain fishing village fell short, Koji killed every inhabitant, razed it, salted the earth, and did the same to two neighboring villages, insisting they must been aware of a plot to defraud him. In [[1299 DR|Wa Year 1717 (1299 DR)]], two [[ninja]]s infiltrated Aru disguised as pilgrims and tried to assassinate Koji. They were killed in the attack, Koji couldn't identify who hired them, and in revenge and as a message to his unknown enemy, he executed every one of the pilgrims in the train. At this excess, shogun [[Masanori]] removed Koji both from office and from life.\n\nThe daimyate went back to the Matsutomos. Vowing to do better, [[Masakito Matsutomo]] was efficient and enlightened, if strict, but too old to reign for long. He died in [[1307 DR|Wa Year 1725 (1307 DR)]] and was succeeded by his son, [[Hisao Matsutomo|Hisao]]. Hisao lacked his father's wisdom and corruption flourished in Aru Province again. Many of his advisors established their own \"business interests\", most egregiously charging pilgrims a \"visitation fee\" to worship at the Shining Temple of Bishamon. When the shogun heard of his violation of tradition, the Matsutomos were removed again in [[1312 DR|Wa Year 1730 (1312 DR)]].\n\nThe next daimyo was [[Takashi Yayazato]]. He ruled ably, but his three sons all died tragically, leaving him with no male heirs to succeed him when he died in [[1340 DR|Wa Year 1758 (1340 DR)]]. Shogun [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] returned the daimyate once again to the Matsutomos. [[Benju Matsutomo]], a renowned samurai and one of Nagahide's generals, governed well but as he grew older he worried about his family's future. Deciding his ancestors' failures resulted from overambition, he resolved to be as quiet, safe, unobtrusive, and error-free as he could, hoping that if the Matsutomos could hold the daimyate for a few generations, they might achieve a better position. He remained in power through [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]].\n\nIn the summer pilgrimage season of that year, a variety of strange and disturbing incidents around Aru threatened the safety of the pilgrims and the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps. Therefore, seven days before it was to take place, the daimyo of Aru, [[Benju Matsutomo]], recruited a group of adventurers to investigate and halt them."
        },
        "Government": "[[Benju Matsutomo]] was the daimyo of Aru and Aru Province during the mid-to-late 1600s.",
        "Defenses": "As was typical for Wa-an cities, Aru was surrounded by a defensive wall, with four gates each flanked by two watchtowers. In daytime, these gates were left open but each guarded by detachments of twelve [[samurai]], their purpose to maintain peace. The gates were shut at sunset while ten samurai stood watch from within each watchtower.\n\nWithin the walls, Aru's districts were divided by walls, with gates providing passage between them. They were guarded throughout the day by eight-man squads of samurai, while those to the Castle District were guarded by twelve or more samurai. Samurai also patrolled within the districts.",

        "Activities": "The Shining Temple of Bishamon was the undoubted center of the faith for many Wanese, especially commoners, peasants, and others of the lower classes (nobles and upper classes preferred the [[Great Temple of Bishamon]] in [[Kurahito]]). Moreover, travel within the country was restricted, so pilgrimage also offered the chance of tourism. Thus, pilgrims from across the country made the perilous journey over the islands and through the mountains to Aru to worship and were rewarded with the amazing site of the Shining Temple. They came in summer, when it was easier to travel the passes.\n\nMuch of Aru's meager industry was devoted to the comfort and service of pilgrims. There were countless inns and stables to house them, and many merchants hawking all manner of religious wares and holy texts. Peddlers in the street sold [[ceramic]] apples in imitation of the sacred apples, and necklaces comprising 3,333 brass beads after the statues. Wealthy or footsore pilgrims could hire a palanquin to carry them up the 3000 steps.\n\nA special ceremony in Aru involved believers making an individual prayer of thanks to each and every one of the 3,333 priest statues in the Shining Temple. True faithful were required to do this each year."
