The '''Settler Camp''' outside [[Leilon]] was a temporary encampment during the town's reconstruction in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was managed by [[Mazira Shae]].

==Description==
The vast settler camp outside of Leilon consisted of circled wagons, tents, cooking fires, and supply containers. The town council met there on a regular basis to plan the rebuilding and address any risks in the area, and the majority of the town's business was conducted there.

==Geography==
The Settler Camp was situated under the trees along the [[High Road]] just south of Leilon.

==History==
By the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild Leilon at the behest of [[Dagult Neverember]], Lord Protector of [[Neverwinter]]. During the town's reconstruction, the Settler Camp was the settler's temoprary home.
