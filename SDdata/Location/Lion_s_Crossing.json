        "mainbody": "Lions Crossing was a town located at least a days travel away from the city of Ravens Bluff in the Dragon Reach region and just  south of Fort DeVillars.\nIn the late 14 century DR, a quartet of bards traveled to the town of Lions Crossing for a festival. Bards Frenchy, Absolute, Scar, and Morton came across a strange sight a collection of young heroes from the far-away land of the Malatran Plateau, speaking through magic in a strange way, dressed in curious adventuring garb, and including some uncanny creatures such as saru, tamhi, and katanga. The meeting proceeded with no incidents, and after a bit of trading, both groups continued on, the bards to Lions Crossing and the Malatran heroes to find an obsidian artifact."
