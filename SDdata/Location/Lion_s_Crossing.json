        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a quartet of [[bard]]s traveled to the town of Lion's Crossing for a festival. Bards [[Frenchy]], [[Absolute (bard)|Absolute]], [[Scar (bard)|Scar]], and [[Morton]] came across a strange sight: a collection of young heroes from the far-away land of the [[Malatran Plateau]], speaking through [[magic]] in a strange way, dressed in curious adventuring garb, and including some uncanny creatures such as [[saru]], [[tam'hi]], and [[katanga]]. The meeting proceeded with no incidents, and after a bit of trading, both groups continued on, the bards to Lion's Crossing and the Malatran heroes to find an [[obsidian]] artifact."
