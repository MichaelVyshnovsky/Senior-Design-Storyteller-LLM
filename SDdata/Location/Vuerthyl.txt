'''Vuerthyl''' was an artificially-created oasis in [[Anauroch]], that was created by the [[Zhentarim]], and was a stop along the [[Black Road]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Black Road|?}}

==Description==
The oasis comprised a number of fruit trees that grew atop an underground reservoir. Like many of the Zhentarim-made oases, Vuerthyl was formed using a ''[[decanter of endless water]]''.

==Geography==
Vuerthyl was located in the northwestern region of [[the Sword]], north of the [[Jackal Hills]]. 

==Defenses==
The oasis outpost was manned by seven journeyman Zhentarim [[wizard]]s and a contingent of 20 veteran [[Zhentilar]] soldiers.

==History==
At some point, the Zhents at Vuerthyl discovered a great wealth of naturally-occurring [[beryl]] and [[emerald]]s hidden away in the reservoir beneath the oasis. While digging beneath the ground they unwittingly released a [[mind flayer]] that had been imprisoned beneath the sands, a being that was since out on the loose.
