Vuerthyl was an artificially-created oasis in Anauroch, that was created by the Zhentarim, and was a stop along the Black Road.
The oasis comprised a number of fruit trees that grew atop an underground reservoir. Like many of the Zhentarim-made oases, Vuerthyl was formed using a decanter of endless water.
Vuerthyl was located in the northwestern region of the Sword, north of the Jackal Hills. 
The oasis outpost was manned by seven journeyman Zhentarim wizards and a contingent of 20 veteran Zhentilar soldiers.
At some point, the Zhents at Vuerthyl discovered a great wealth of naturally-occurring beryl and emeralds hidden away in the reservoir beneath the oasis. While digging beneath the ground they unwittingly released a mind flayer that had been imprisoned beneath the sands, a being that was since out on the loose.
