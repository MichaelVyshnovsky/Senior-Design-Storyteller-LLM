'''Sarbreen''', called the '''City of the Hammer''', was a ruined [[dwarf|dwarven]] city in [[the Vast]]. For a brief time, it was a great thriving city that shone as the richest of all [[dwarven]] holds in [[Faerûn]]. Led by master crafters known as Master Masons—armorers, weaponsmiths, jewelers, miners, woodcarvers, glassblowers and others—Sarbreen flourished.

==History==
The dwarves of the newly established realm of [[Roldilar]] began construction of a secure trading center, Sarbreen, at the mouth of the [[Fire River]], around the [[611 DR|Year of the Normiir, 611 DR]]. It was finished in [[616 DR|Year of the Ensorceled Kings, 616 DR]], and thrived as "the Gate to the Vast". Through the new port of Sarbreen, the Roldilarren dwarves engaged in heavy trade with other nations to develop their kingdom. They sold [[gem]]s, trade-[[metal]]s, and only a little of their fine armor, weapons, and artworks, in exchange for [[cloth]], livestock and exotic [[food]]s. They imported herds of [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and shaggy-haired cattle to fill the cleared lands.

At some point in its history, Sarbreen was beset by a wave of [[disenchanter]]s.<ref>

Roldilar, the Realm of Glimmering Swords, fell to the resurgent [[orcs]] in the {{YearlinkName|649}}. The dwarves abandoned Sarbreen to the orcs, who quickly pillaged and razed it.

Its treasures were either carried away or still remained in the ruins of the city, waiting for adventurers to find them. Later, a [[human]] city was built on top of the ruins, going by the name of [[Ravens Bluff]]. This new city's sewers were built into the ruins of Sarbreen, and the plucky were likely to find either mighty treasures or deadly perils if they went exploring them.
