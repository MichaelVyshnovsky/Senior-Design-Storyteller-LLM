'''Abreon''' was a large town in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]].

==Geography==
This inland town lay amidst low rolling hills. These were strewn with fields, vineyards, and olive groves.

==Government & Religion==
Around [[1373 DR]], it was governed by a council of wealthy farmers.

The civic deity of Abreon was [[Lliira|Lliira the Joybringer]].

==History==
The area was once the location of a great battle fought between the besieged defenders of Lapaliiya and the invading forces of [[Serpentes]], which finally conquered the land in the [[-189 DR|Year of Sunned Serpents, –189 DR]].

==Locations==
Barrows dating back to the last battle between Lapaliiya and Serpentes still lay hidden in the fields around Abreon in the 14th century DR. Occasionally, [[undead]] [[humanoid]]s and [[serpentfolk]] creeped out to terrorize the people of the area.
