Beldenshyn, nicknamed "the Bell" and derogatorily called "Goatreek" and "the Goatstink", was a gnome village in the Fields of the Dead, circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Beldenshyn was located west of Trollclaw Ford on the south side of the Winding Water on the southernmost curve of that river.
Beldenshyn was among the locations linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists.
This community manufactured and sold crossbows and bolts. The village had a tin mine run by  General Manager of the Jannath mines, Skalgarrad, until it was depleted in 1492 DR.
The village was surrounded by a stockade, and the residents were sure-shots with crossbows.

The residents of Beldenshyn raised long-haired goats that grazed around the village, both inside and outside the walls. Unfortunately, these hirsute ungulates had an odor that most humans found disgusting, thus giving the village the disparaging nicknames that were bandied about in places like Scornubel.
