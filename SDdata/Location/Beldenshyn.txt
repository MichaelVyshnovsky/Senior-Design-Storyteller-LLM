'''Beldenshyn''', nicknamed "the Bell" and derogatorily called "Goatreek" and "the Goatstink", was a [[gnome]] village in the [[Fields of the Dead]], ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==Geography==
Beldenshyn was located west of [[Trollclaw Ford]] on the south side of the [[Winding Water]] on the southernmost curve of that river.
Beldenshyn was among the locations linked through the [[magic]]al transportation network known as the [[Trail of Mists]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}

==Trade==
This community manufactured and sold [[crossbow]]s and [[bolt]]s. The village had a [[tin]] mine run by  General Manager of the [[Jannath (family)|Jannath]] mines, [[Skalgarrad]], until it was depleted in [[1492 DR]].

==Defenses==
The village was surrounded by a stockade, and the residents were sure-shots with crossbows.

==History==
[[FIle:Dragon267-Ron Spencer-Goat.png|thumb|right|272px|''One of the four-legged denizens of Beldenshyn.'']]
The residents of Beldenshyn raised long-haired [[goat]]s that grazed around the village, both inside and outside the walls. Unfortunately, these hirsute ungulates had an odor that most [[human]]s found disgusting, thus giving the village the disparaging nicknames that were bandied about in places like [[Scornubel]].
