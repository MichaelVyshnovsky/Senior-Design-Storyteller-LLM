Zalazuu (also seen as Zalasuu
Zalasuu was a small city with a population of 5,000. An additional 2,000 soldiers and sailors were stationed in a nearby fort.
Zalasuu was a city of rich green gardens and villas. The city had intricate iron trellises form piazzas and gazebos, thickly entangled by grapevines, forming refreshing shade. The vines were fruit-bearing producing yellow and soft pink-colored grapes. The air about town was heavily scented by its lush vegetation, scented brazier insect-repellant smoke, and underlining smell of the neighboring fetid Kilmaruu Swamp.
Zalasuu was ruled by the cleric Lailuu.
This city served as one of two naval bases for Halruaas mighty navy.
