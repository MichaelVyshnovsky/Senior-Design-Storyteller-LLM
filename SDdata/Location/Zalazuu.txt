}}'''Zalazuu''' (also seen as '''Zalasuu'''

==Description==
Zalasuu was a small city with a population of 5,000. An additional 2,000 soldiers and sailors were stationed in a nearby fort.

Zalasuu was a city of rich green gardens and villas. The city had intricate iron trellises form piazzas and gazebos, thickly entangled by [[grape]]vines, forming refreshing shade. The vines were fruit-bearing producing yellow and soft pink-colored grapes. The air about town was heavily scented by its lush vegetation, scented brazier insect-repellant smoke, and underlining smell of the neighboring fetid [[Kilmaruu Swamp]].

==Inhabitants==
Zalasuu was ruled by the [[cleric]] [[Lailuu]].

==History==
This city served as one of two naval bases for Halruaa's mighty navy.
