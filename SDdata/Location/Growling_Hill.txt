The Growling Hill was a peculiar site of interest in Amn.
Originally the site of a wizards tower, the site fell to ruin and became buried by mud and grass growth, resembling a small irregularly shaped hill. An intermittent growling sound of unknown origin could be heard if one pressed their ear to the ground. Local parents claimed there was a great beast living under the hill, who would surely eat naughty children.
The hill was about a days walk northeast of Crimmor not far from the Bitten Road, north of the Alandor River and west of Minsor Vale and Lake Weng.
