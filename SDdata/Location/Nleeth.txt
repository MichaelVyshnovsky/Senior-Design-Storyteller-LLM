Nleeth was a Turmish-sponsored city-state, one of the Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach, located on the northern bank of the Reach.
A big part of Nleeths economy was rooted in tourism. The military training and maneuvres between Chondath and Turmish attracted travelers from neighboring regions. Spectators sat back and watched armies fight for superiority without starting real wars. Even though each county sent only a small portion of their armies to participate in the tournaments, they also considered it a reconnaissance of the opponents tactical prowess.
Nleeth was established in the , alongside the cities of Amah and Reth, to be used as training settlements for the Chondathan and Turmish armies.
Nleeth and its neighbors continued the tradition of the Southsands Games as of the . By the late 14 century DR, most bloodshed of the Games was drastically reduced to being just accidents. These competitors had a winner. Chondath, Sespech, and Nimpeth put slaves on the stake while Turmish brought in trade goods and money. With Turmish abolishing slavery, the years when it won, the slaves were claimed from other participants and granted freedom.
