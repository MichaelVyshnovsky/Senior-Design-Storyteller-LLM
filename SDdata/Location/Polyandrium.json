        "History": "The word \"polyandrium\" meant \"the gathering place of fallen warriors\". The name was given to this area following an ancient battle between the defenders of Myth Drannor and an orcish horde. The attackers maneuvered the defenders down one of the nearest hills and surrounded them spilling the blood of many valiant warriors. Eventually, the defenders of Myth Drannor persevered.\n\nThe Polyandrium became a site of the mass grave for the unidentified fallen defenders. Orcish fallen received a mass grave of their own not war from there. The Myth Drannor erected a monument on the site and with time, the area started being built up with tombs and mausoleums, becoming the secondary graveyard for Myth Drannor.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], during the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, one of the Cult's cells was stationed out of the Tower of Bones in the Polyandrium. The Cultists used slave labor and the undead created using expired slaves and enemies to excavate the tombs on the graveyard. By the time a group of heroes pursuing the Cult's slavers arrived at the Polyandrium, about half of the tombs have been broken open and desecrated.",
        "Notable Locations": "[[File:Crypt rothilion entrance.png|thumb|300x300px|''A human and a dwarf enter a [[Crypt of Rothilion|crypt]].'']]\n*[[Candledance Way]], the path that connected the Polyandrium and [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The road led south, connected to a bridge over a stream, then veered south-west, intersecting with the [[Street of the Evening Star]]. The path from there led towards the caste and reached [[Shaundakul's Throne]].\n*The [[Tower of Bones]], the center for necromantic research, later taken over by the Cult of the Dragon.\n*[[Crypt of Kesefehon]], the final resting place of the disgraced elven hero [[Kesefehon]].\n*[[Crypt of Orbakh]], a large crypt decorated with carvings of skulls and runes with its door magically fused with the rock that was the entrance to the crypt.\n*[[Crypt of Rothilion]], a large tomb that belonged to [[Rothilion]] the Honorable, Wizard, and Judge of Myth Drannor.\n*[[Ikeshia's Crypt]], the tomb of a rich elven philanthropist.\n*[[Lyssic's Crypt]], the large tomb that housed the dead body of a [[human]] commander of Myth Drannor's armies, [[Lyssic]], and his army of [[clay warrior]] [[constructs]].\n*[[Loresinger's Crypt]], the smaller-sized mausoleum for an unnamed musician.",
        "Inhabitants": "In 1369 DR, the area was under the control of the Cult of the Dragon, they filled the graveyard with slave laborers of various races and the undead, such as [[skeleton]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[wight]]s, and [[zombie]]s. At night the polyandrium became a dangerous and scary area, filled with roaming undead awakened from the ancient mass-graves.\n\nThe Cult of the Dragon's operations in the Polyandrium was led by [[Ryngoth]] and his loyal ''[[awaken|awakened]]'' [[dire badger]] [[Zulkir (badger)|Zulkir]].\n\nClose proximity to the forest also meant the wild creatures often could be found in the area, such as [[troll]]s, [[giant wasp]]s, [[giant spider]]s, and [[phase spider]]s."
