        "mainbody": "The '''Border Forest''' was a large forest that connected four different regions of [[Faerûn]]: the [[Dalelands]] to the south, [[Anauroch]] to the west, the [[Tortured Land]] to the north, and the [[Moonsea]] to the east.",
        "Geography": "The Border Forest was a mixture of [[pines]], [[oak]]s, and other deciduous trees. The forest undergrowth was relatively thick, making travel difficult.",
        "History": "The Border Forest was once known as '''Rystall Wood''' by the [[sylvan elves]] that lived there for many centuries after the [[Crown Wars]]. However, little evidence remains of their civilization as they built few permanent structures. It was later known as the '''Eastern Forest''' by the of [[Empire of Netheril]] before it got its modern name.\n\nRystall Wood was cut off from the rest of [[Cormanthor|Arcorar]] during the [[Twelve Nights of Fire]] in {{Yearlink|-5000}}, which were started by a falling [[meteor]]. Rystall Wood became a separate forest and elven realm after the Twelve Nights of Fire cleared away the mountain and hill trees that had attached it to Arcorar. Although an independent forest after the event, its [[coronal]] still convened often with the leaders of the [[Elven Court]].\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-4970}}, [[Coronal]] [[Mhaenal]] of Rystall Wood was slain by monsters that were summoned into his bedchambers, ending the reign of the sixth [[Rysar]] in Rystall Wood.\n\n[[Drow]] later made use of dark magic to burn and clear the area surrounding the [[Twisted Tower]] in {{Yearlink|-2439}}, in an event known as the [[Spiderfires]]. This further expanded the gap between Rystall Wood and [[Cormanthyr]]. This marked the beginning of a conflict of more than two thousand years known as the [[Shadow War]] between the drow and the elves of Rystall Wood.\n\nThe fortified [[Netherese]] logging camp of [[Coniferia]] entered into open war with the [[troll]]s of the forest in {{Yearlink|-1105}}, after enduring centuries of attacks from them. The [[Trollflame Wars]] lasted nearly three hundred years and culminated in a siege of the camp by the giant-kin and the slaughter of around 12,000 trolls.\n\n[[Orc]]s from the forest began repeatedly attacking [[Seventon]] in the {{YearlinkName|-649}}, and in the {{Yearlink|-556}}, they razed the city of [[Janick]]. Finally, in {{YearlinkName|-487}}, the orcs were finally routed by the Netherese and they fled back to their woodland lairs.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-371}}, the [[primordial]] [[Maram of the Great Spear]] carved a great swath of destruction across the heart of the forest, as it sought to reach the [[Monument of the Ancients]] after fleeing the aftermath of the [[Seven Sigils War]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48}}\n\nConiferia was overrun when trolls attacked again in the {{YearlinkName|-335}}. Four years later, in the {{Yearlink|-331}}, with the aid of the Elven Court, the Shadow War ended with defeat for the drow and the Twisted Tower being rededicated as a temple to [[Eilistraee]]. In only a little more than a hundred years, however, orc hordes would ravage the area, and by {{Yearlink|-64}} the twelfth and final Rysar had fallen, leaving behind only the city of Yrlaancel, which would later become Myth Ondath.\n\nIn the late 1350s DR, a variety of unusual monsters were sighted around the [[Dragon Reach]] and were tracked back to the Border Forest, where they'd seemingly emerged. Meanwhile, across [[Faerûn]], similar monsters appeared on the [[Sword Coast North]] and apparently originated in the [[Lurkwood]]. Among these were flying [[troll]]-like things; winged [[undead]] capable of flight; smoky clouds with multiple retractable arms ending in [[clam]]-like jaws and which hunted silently; intelligent two-headed [[snake]]s with tentacles and magical powers—all previously unknown both to local hunters and forest-dwellers and to wider Faerûn. Too big and too numerous to all be supported by forest food sources, and emerging at a steady rate, the monsters were theorized to have been spawned by unidentified magical sources within their respective forests.{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|27}}",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Eldreth Veluuthra": "Two [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] cells were known to be active in the forest around [[1374 DR]]. One cell focused on raiding the [[Daggerdale]] border while the other concentrated on ambushing [[Zhentarim]] agents. The Eldreth Veluuthra in this area were supported by fey."
        },
        "Notable Locations": "At the southern edges of the Border Forest lay the ruins of the [[Flaming Tower]], once built by [[fire giant]]s and destroyed by the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]. The ruins came to be inhabited by a powerful [[beholder]], served by a force of [[goblins]].\n\nNot far from the northern edge of the forest, where the [[White Peaks]] extended eastward from the great desert of [[Anauroch]], between the [[Tortured Land]] and [[the Ride]], and toward [[Ilinvur]], lay the blasted rubble that was all that remained of [[Myth Ondath]].\n\nBuried somewhere in the forest was the fallen Netherese enclave of [[Spiel]]. Its remains were not documented as being discovered.<ref>\n\nThe [[Bone Dance]] was a bare hilltop in the southern part of the forest. It was strewn with jagged boulders and appeared to be haunted by ghosts in the form of bizarre monstrous [[skeletons]].{{Cite dragon/295/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Bone Dance|78}}"
