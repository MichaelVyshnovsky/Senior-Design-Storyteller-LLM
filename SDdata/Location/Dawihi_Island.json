        "mainbody": "awihi Island was a small island found in the Crowded Sea in the Cities of the Ancients region in east Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nThe island sat roughly  offshore of mainland east Zakhara with the northern part of the island laying near Rogosto.\nOpen grasslands dominated the relatively flat surface of Dawihi Island. The crumbling towers dotting the coastline and countryside, which were similar to the famed metal towers of Rogosto, served as nesting grounds for birds.\nAside from the town of Sagat and other small merchant villages, the island was mostly populated by seabirds and raptors of various kinds.\nViolent monsoons were a constant danger the islands inhabitants faced every summer. The storms often claimed the smaller settlements found along the coast.\nThe strange towers decorating the island were actually the remnants of a locathah civilization that was once underwater. The locathah met their end at war with un unknown air-breathing race that summoned a powerful elemental power that banished the creatures and raised their civilization above the water.\nA mysterious avian queen was said to rule the birds calling Dawihi Island home.\n* Sagat"
