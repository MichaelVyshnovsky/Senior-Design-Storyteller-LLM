Like other cities in Threskel, Thamor's lord served the [[chromatic dragon]]s loyal to the [[Great Bone Wyrm]] that reigned over the entire realm.",
        "Trade": "As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], most of the city's traders exchanged goods with farmers from the badlands along the southern stretch of Threskel, as well as the miners that made their living in the [[Riders to the Sky]] mountain range.",
        "History": "The city was founded as a place where traders from [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]] could freely exchange goods without having to pay any taxes.\n\nAfter the collapse of [[Unther]] following [[Gilgeam]]'s death during the [[Avatar Crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Thamor struggled for some time before experiencing a strong recovery."
