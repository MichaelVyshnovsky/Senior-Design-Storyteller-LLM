        "mainbody": "Elembar was a large human kingdom in northwest Faer√ªn that existed from the 2 to 6 centuries DR.\nElembar lay across the lower Delimbiyr Vale between the Delimbiyr River, Ardeep Forest, and Forlorn Hills, and reached into the Dessarin Valley almost as far as future Womford. The capital city, Delimbiyran, sat halfway between the Ardeep Forest and the later site of Daggerford.\nThe kingdom of Elembar was founded in the  by Illuskan settlers moving up the Vale from Tavaray. Other contemporary human realms in the Sword Coast North included Eigersstor founded in 87 DR, Steeping Falls founded in 133 DR, Uthtower also founded in 146 DR, Athalantar founded in , and Yarlith founded in . Over the following century these realms did well for themselves, as Elembar, Athalantar, Yarlith, and Uthtower settled the lands along the Dessarin Valley all the way to the Crags with fortified frontier holds, calling it the Mlembryn lands.\nYet the Illuskan realms of the North suffered a period of reversals over the next few centuries that would only halt with Laeral Silverhands establishment of Stornanter in 806 DR and the rebuilding of Illusk in 812 DR. The largest city of the Vale, Tavaray, was abandoned in the  when it suddenly sank into the Lizard Marsh, and Athalantar was destroyed by orcs in 342 DR. Steeping Falls was abandoned by its own people in  as evil monstrosities and undead made Morlin Castle their home. As the realms waned and collapsed, Tethyrian humans and halflings from the Shoon Imperium, Tethyr and Amn migrated north, joining with or absorbing the local Illuskans.\nElembar itself fell in the  at the hands of an orc horde that ravaged its northern and central regions. Though the invaders were destroyed at the House of Stone and the capital city Delimbiyran survived intact, the realm was shattered. Javilarhh Snowsword I reformed it as the kingdom of Delimbiyran and became its first king, leading it into a period of expansion and security as part of Phalorm.\nBy the 14 century DR, the name \"Elembar\" was still used to refer to the northern regions of the realm between the Ardeep Forest and Forlorn Hills, roughly synonymous with the former Halangorn Forest. The Moon Tower of Elembar was destroyed by the invasion of 511 DR, but a ghostly remnant of it remained on the eastern edge of the Forlorn Hills, with it trapped inside the Border Ethereal."
