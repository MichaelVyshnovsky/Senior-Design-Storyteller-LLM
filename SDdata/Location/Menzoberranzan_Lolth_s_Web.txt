Lolths Web was a neighborhood of the district of West Wall in Menzoberranzan that was suspended from the ceiling and walls by calcified spider silk.
Lolths Web was located in West Wall next to the district of Narbondellyn. It consisted of hundreds of strands of calcified spider silk stretching from the ceiling to the ground in a dense latticework. Hollow, cocoon-like structures, both on top of and below the webs, provided living space. Narrow ladders connected the levels for those without the ability to levitate.
Lolths Web was constructed by survivors of the destruction of Ched Nasad, which fell in 1372 DR. Over the next hundred years, the survivors based Lolths Web on the structure of their home city, using magical techniques to weave the web.
 House Melarn
 Formed in 1383 DR, the houses compound was shaped like a nautilus.
