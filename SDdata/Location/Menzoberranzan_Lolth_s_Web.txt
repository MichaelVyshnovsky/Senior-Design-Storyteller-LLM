'''Lolth's Web''' was a neighborhood of the district of [[West Wall]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] that was suspended from the ceiling and walls by calcified [[spider]] silk.

==Description==
Lolth's Web was located in West Wall next to the district of [[Narbondellyn]]. It consisted of hundreds of strands of calcified spider silk stretching from the ceiling to the ground in a dense latticework. Hollow, cocoon-like structures, both on top of and below the webs, provided living space. Narrow ladders connected the levels for those without the ability to [[levitate]].

==History==
Lolth's Web was constructed by survivors of the destruction of [[Ched Nasad]], which fell in [[1372 DR]]. Over the next hundred years, the survivors based Lolth's Web on the structure of their home city, using magical techniques to weave the web.
