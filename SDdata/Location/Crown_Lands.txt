The '''Protectorate of the Crown Lands''' was composed of the four central-most counties of the Kingdom of [[Tethyr]].

==Geography==
The counties [[Ithmonn]], [[Rivershire]], [[Varyth]], and [[Spellshire]] make up the Crown Lands. The majority of Tethyr's farmland was located here, and the region only contained one major city, the capital of [[Darromar]].
