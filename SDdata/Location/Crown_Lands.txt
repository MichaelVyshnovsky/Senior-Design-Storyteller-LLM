The Protectorate of the Crown Lands was composed of the four central-most counties of the Kingdom of Tethyr.
The counties Ithmonn, Rivershire, Varyth, and Spellshire make up the Crown Lands. The majority of Tethyrs farmland was located here, and the region only contained one major city, the capital of Darromar.
