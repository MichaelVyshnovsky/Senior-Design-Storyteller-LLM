'''Beliard''' was a small trading village that was home to, as well as a meeting place for, the many cattle ranchers that drove their herds across the nearby hills. 

==Geography==
It was located at the crossroads where the [[Stone Trail]] intersected the [[Dessarin Road]], just a bit a few miles east of [[Stone Bridge]].

==History==
Sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, four merchants went missing in Beliard. The cause of this disappearance was a [[doppelganger]] that had assumed the form of one of Blasko Halamar's young apprentices, [[Hagarl]].

Some time after the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] was abolished, around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, groups of [[hill giant]]s began to steal livestock from Beliard's animal pens.

==Notable locations==
;Shops:
* [[Halamar's Horses]]: The stables were run by former adventurer Blasko Halamar and a dozen young assistants.
* [[Milshoun's Stronghouses]]: These three warehouses were owned by the [[Calishite]] man, [[Ahbaer Milshoun]].

;Inns & Taverns:
* [[Watchful Knight]]: This cold and unwelcoming hostel was run by [[Arachar Calatharr (innkeeper)|Arachar Calatharr]] who was pointedly ''not'' a retired adventurer.
