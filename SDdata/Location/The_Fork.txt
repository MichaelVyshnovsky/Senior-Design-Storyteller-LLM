'''The Fork''' was the spot where the [[Fork Road]] from [[Sundabar]] split to go north along the [[Adbar Road]] towards [[Citadel Adbar]], and east along an unnamed path toward [[Ascore]].

==Geography==
The lonely and wild spot seemed like the end of [[Faer√ªn]], splitting toward the dwarfholds of the [[Ice Mountains]], and the nameless track heading east to the ruins of [[Ascore]]. Few traveled the way, but the [[gnome]]s of [[Graevelwood]] sometimes used the road.

==Points of Interest==
* [[Ghaurin's Hold]] was located here, but as of [[1374 DR]], all that remained of the keep on the surface were a few stones. The mossy foundation used to be a mansion of the ancient [[Dwarf|dwarven]] hero, [[Ghaurin]]. According to some rumors, Ghaurin's treasure laid somewhere deep in its cellars together with the restless spirit of the old dwarf.) 
* The [[Wildlands Rest]] was an inn built on the roadside by former adventurers [[Irvag|Irvag the Bear]] and [[Grumbelham Goldhand]]. The structure looked like a fortress rather than an inn. It was very well cared for.
