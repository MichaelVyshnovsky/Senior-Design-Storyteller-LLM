        "mainbody": "The '''Reaching Woods''' was a large forest in the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Geography": "The forest spread east of the [[River Chionthar]] and the border of [[Elturgard]], south of the [[Trielta Hills]], and some way west of the [[Far Hills]].{{ Cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition/Map}} It was split in twain by the [[River Reaching]] between [[Hill's Edge]] and where it joined the Chionthar.\n\nThe northern part was called the '''Northdark Wood''', but others named it the '''Dusk Wood''' or '''Reluvethel's Wood''' after the famed [[elf]] [[ranger]] [[Reluvethel]] who once hunted here.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/67/Training Ground|34}} It thinned where the [[Dusk Road]] ran through the woods, before continuing as a minor sub-branch on the far side of the road. The village of [[Drawn Swords]] stood on a lone crag on the eastern side.",
        "Description": {
            "Climate": "In winter, the Reaching Woods see a lot of snow, freezing temperatures, and clouded skies. The areas of the woods untouched by the sun remained frozen through the season, especially during the seventy days of coldest weather. In contrast, the rest of the winter was milder, humid, and often enveloped by fog. Snowfalls happened every three to four days, and due to colliding streams of air from northwest and southwest, common freak storms turned into complete whiteouts.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-12-19 - The Reaching Woods}}"
        },
        "History": "In the 1{{st}} century DR, the woods were the home of the city of Talis, which was settled by the Talfir race of humans. It was known that the woods, crossed by the [[River Reaching]], were called Elanvae by the [[elves]] of {{yearlink|240}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|557}}, hobgoblin tribes of the Reaching Woods made war against [[Phalorm]], having been incited by [[yuan-ti]] infiltrators sent by [[Nejizar]] of [[Najara]] in the north. The hobgoblin horde march north, but Phalorm's own infiltrators stopped them in their tracks at the [[Battle of Notched Axes]], then guaranteed their defeat in the [[Battle of Blunted Fangs]] by assassinating the yuan-ti provocateurs. The hobgoblins were repelled and the serpentfolk forced to withdraw into the [[Serpent Hills]].<ref group=\"note\">\n''Serpent Kingdoms'' places these events in [[577 DR]], but ''The Grand History of the Realms'' chooses 557 DR. This article adopts the earlier date as ''Grand History'' is more recent source.\n\n[[File:1479-Elturgard.png|thumb|right|''A map of the lands of Elturgard and the Reaching Woods, ''circa'' 1479 DR.'']]\n''Circa'' [[1459 DR]], the neighboring realm of Elturgard learned that shrines to \"unapproved\" [[god]]s and primal entities existed in the forest. These shrines were maintained by humans and elves as well as gnolls and goblins. The High Observer [[Thavius Kreeg]], ruler of Elturgard, said the goblins were vicious and the gnolls known [[demon]] worshipers, and ordered the Reaching Woods barricaded and declared that no one could enter or exit the woods or they would suffer the death penalty.\n\nOver the next two decades, the gnolls of the forest slaughtered all other humanoids and captured the survivors, keeping them alive only for food. Finally, in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a single elf escaped and sneaked past the barricade to spread word to the outside world. She warned that only a few prisoners remained alive, and that the gnolls would surely soon look outside the forest for fresh sources of meat.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the 6{{th}} century DR, [[hobgoblin]] tribes occupied by the forest.\n\nIn the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, the Reaching Woods were home to [[centaur]]s and [[hybsil]]s, as well as [[satyr]] [[druid]]s. Some powerful druids dwelled here in the 1360s [[DR]]. However, ''circa'' [[1367 DR]], some parts of the forest were overrun with [[goblinoid]]s. They enslaved the native centaurs and satyrs.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Reaching Woods were inhabited by [[human]]s and [[elves]] and by [[goblin]]s and [[gnoll]]s, but 1479 DR, the gnolls dominated the forest and kept the humans and elves as no more than food.",
        "Locations": "The [[Talfir]]ian city of [[Talis (city)|Talis]] lay deep in the woods along the banks of the River Reaching. Prominent in the 1{{st}} century DR, it was in ruins by the 14{{th}} century.\n\nA number of shrines to [[Eldath]], the Green Goddess, could be found nearby the calm pools ''circa'' 1367 DR.\n\nA curious, mobile landmark in the woods was the Walking Tower. It took the form of a massive statue, standing many stories tall, and it wandered the forest seemingly at random or as if seeking something. Believed to be a relic of ancient [[Netheril]], it was the possession of a ranger named [[Alomystia]] in the mid-1200s DR, but his fate is unknown."
