'''Gloomwrought''' was a city in the [[Shadowfell]].

==Government==
The ruler of Gloomwrought was [[Rolan the Deathless|Prince Rolan]], a [[human]] nobleman. Other merchant nobles held power in the city but they cared little for the city itself, only themselves. Hidden organizations also wielded some influence and it was unknown whether the mysterious [[Keepers]] held any temporal power or not.
