Gloomwrought was a city in the Shadowfell.
The ruler of Gloomwrought was Prince Rolan, a human nobleman. Other merchant nobles held power in the city but they cared little for the city itself, only themselves. Hidden organizations also wielded some influence and it was unknown whether the mysterious Keepers held any temporal power or not.
Draygo Quick maintained a home in a compound here where he imprisoned Drizzt DoUrden for quite some time and petrified Dahlia Sinfelle and Artemis Entreri. The prisoners were rescued when the compound was assaulted by Bregan Daerthe at the bequest of Jarlaxle.
* Draygo Quick, a Netherese noble.
