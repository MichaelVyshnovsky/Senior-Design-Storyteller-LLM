        },
        "Flora": "Around the fringes of the swamp grew [[blueleaf]]s and [[oak]], typically gnarled and stunted. As one ventured further in, copses of more tangled trees grew more common and finally became predominant. A variety of trees grew in the heart of the flooded forest: [[gum|black gum]], [[cypress]], [[ash|water ash]], [[birch|water birch]], [[oak|gall oak]], and [[willow]] and weeping willow. These trees invariably choked the region, their trunks were twisted and dark, and were draped in moss. There were even carnivorous trees that could be hazardous, like the [[black willow]] and [[thornslinger]].\n\nOther plants found growing in the Vast Swamp were common marsh reeds, swamp grass, and cattail. Meanwhile, duckweed floated on the waters. There were also a number of rare species of water lily; a few of these served as components for spells and potions, like healing potions.",
        "Fauna": "Even the ordinary animals were unnatural in aspect and behavior. They were highly aggressive, fighting each other for food or space. They also had no fear of humanoids, being ready to attack with great ferocity. There were [[fox]]es, [[otter]]s, [[raccoon]]s, rodents such as black [[squirrel]]s, poisonous [[snake]]s (an ever-present threat), and even [[lynx]]es and [[panther|swamp panthers]]. Many of these creatures were diseased, carrying [[rabies]], [[swamp fever]], and the like. Creepy-crawlies to watch out for were [[leech]]es and centipedes. Bull[[frog]]s were also heard to croak here.<ref>\n\nMonstrous beasts included [[dire boar]]s, [[giant crocodile]]s, and [[giant constrictor snake]]s, as well as [[giant frog]]s, [[giant leech]]es, and [[monstrous centipede]]s.",
        "Relations": "The Vast Swamp and the Darkflow served as the ''de facto'' border between the realms of Cormyr and Sembia, largely because neither Cormyr nor Sembia had any interest in laying claim to the land, nor anything beyond. The myriad of monsters and other hazards made the Vast Swamp the most dangerous place in either land, people had no cause or desire to go in, and clearing it and draining it would be an epic undertaking, so both nations were happy to ignore it—at least until some raider or monster crept out and into their lands.\n\nThankfully, the savage denizens of the Vast Swamp usually stayed in its confines, content to war between themselves rather than raid the neighboring lands. By the 1360s DR, [[Ghars]] also lay within reach of Vast Swamp raiders, but was well defended. The town of [[Thunderstone]] was also well protected against the dangers of the swamp.\n\nNevertheless, the Vast Swamp enticed explorers who would brave the dangers and endure the difficult environment. Many famed explorers and adventurers, even whole bands, went into the Vast Swamp, and few were heard of again. However, at a national level, neither Cormyr nor Sembia themselves had attempted any major expeditions into the Vast Swamp before the late 14th century [[DR]]. Hence few people knew for sure what lurked in the darkest, dankest depths of the swamp.",
        "History": "The Vast Swamp was originally a natural marshland, but in {{Yearlink|-702}}, the wizards of the kingdom of [[Orva]] opened a portal to [[Minauros]]. This triggered an explosion, and ooze and slime from the [[Nine Hells|hellish]] layer poured into the swamp and expanded it greatly.\n\nIn the [[900 DR|Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR]], King [[Galaghard III]]'s army, the [[Glory of Cormyr]], drove the [[Witch Lords]] and their undead forces toward the Vast Swamp. They caught and trapped them there against the swamp's western shore and finally [[Battle with the Witch Lords|defeated them]].\n\nIn the [[1352 DR|Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR]], the Lost King [[Gondegal]], who attempted to carve his own kingdom out of Cormyr, extended his reach as far east as the Vast Swamp.\n\nIn the late 1340s DR, the [[Thunderstone]] farmer [[Del Geery]] (whose farmland extended to the edge of the Vast Swamp) sponsored the explorer [[Hadley Erridge]] for a thirty-man expedition into the Vast Swamp to capture a live [[hydra]]. Two months later, they returned with an adult hydra in a cage of [[iron]]. Ultimately, Geery developed a variety of uses for hydra body parts and began to fund new hydra-hunting expeditions into the Vast Swamp. He was very successful at this new trade by [[1367 DR]].\n\nAround [[1357 DR]], an adventuring group called the [[Moon's Twelve]] went into the Vast Swamp. The last surviving member, [[Sylara]], returned to civilized lands ranting and delirious about discovering an [[elf|elven]] ruin as old and as extensive as [[Myth Drannor]] but her group was ambushed and pursued by [[mind flayer]]s and [[beholder]]s. She died of a swamp fever before she could elaborate further and no one knew if what she saw actually existed.\n\nBrother [[Twick]], a knowledgeable [[halfling]] [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] who studied the marshes of Cormyr on behalf of the [[Naturalists' Guild]], made a few expeditions into the Vast Swamp before [[1367 DR]]. His aim was to further knowledge of botany and wildlife and to seek converts for the Grain Goddess. He found no potential believers, but plenty of experiences of horror. Nevertheless, he survived to become an authority on the place and its dangers.\n\nIn the late 1360s [[DR]], the [[Dragonslayer (tribe)|Dragonslayer]] lizardfolk tribe (so named for claiming to have killed several dragons over the decades) slew the [[black dragon]] [[Tyra]] and moved into her lair. However, Tyra's brother [[Despayr]] came and massacred many of the Dragonslayers, and enslaved the survivors. He then took her lair and hoard as his own. He had a daughter by one of the lizardfolk, [[Ketsarra Shadowscale]], who became their new chieftain. In time, Despayr was visited by [[Esvele Graycastle]], who retrieved from the treasure the ''[[shadow shard]]'', with which Despayr transformed the lizardfolk slaves and even his daughter into the first of the [[undead]] [[Shadowscale]]s. The Dragonslayers were no more.<ref group=\"note\">The date of Tyra's death and the Dragonslayers' downfall is unknown. The Roll Call of Dragons in ''[[Dragons of Faerûn]]'' lists Tyra as alive as of [[1373 DR]]. The timeline in ''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'' is not precise, but the presence of Despayr's adult half-lizardfolk daughter, Ketsarra Shadowscale—presumably born to one of the lizardfolk, who have been said to grow to maturity in five years—suggests his takeover was at least five years before 1374 DR, with Tyra's death before that.\n\n[[File:Tearing of the Weave cover art.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Adventurers battling Shadowscale lizardfolk and will-o'-wisps in the Vast Swamp.]]In the service of Esvele's scheme, Despayr sought to dominate much of the Vast Swamp. Their goal was to tear a hole in the [[Weave]] of [[magic]] and so form a [[dead-magic zone]] over all the Vast Swamp. It was to be a powerbase for the followers of [[Shar]] and an earthly homeland for their [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] allies. In the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], at Despayr's behest, the Shadowscales made savage war upon the tribes of the Vast Swamp, particularly the other lizardfolk, who could hardly resist the [[shadowslain]] raiders. Many were slain and more were captured and carried off to the [[Lost Refuge]], eventually returning as Shadowscales themselves to attack their own kin. However, the lowly [[Kessessek]] proved himself by turning the Shadowscales and the leaderless Sharptooths acclaimed him as their new chieftain. Kessessek adopted an aggressive but canny strategy against the mightier Shadowscales. He made an alliance between the Sharptooths and the [[Blackscale]]s and [[Poison Dusk]]s—other tribes attacked by the Shadowscales—and so they survived against further raids. Then, in early [[Eleint]], he led a war party of Sharptooths, Blackscales, and Poison Dusks into Shadowscale territory around the [[Skull Staff]]. They hoped to slay some Shadowscales or their [[Shar]]-worshiping allies, or else capture some of the \"dream walkers\"—mind-controlled petitioners of a false [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]]—that regularly passed that way to the Lost Refuge. Kessessek and his kin recognized that these dream walkers were innocents and hoped to capture them, free their minds, and deny this resource to their shared enemy.\n\nIn fact, the next group to pass that way were adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating the false temple and Sharrans' activities. Parlaying at the [[Vast Swamp geyser|Sharptooth encampment]], Kessessek aided and enlisted the adventurers to deal with the Shadowscales at the Lost Refuge. When they returned, the Sharptooths feted them as heroes. In the following weeks, after [[War Wizards]] investigated the Lost Refuge, the kingdom of Cormyr made an alliance with the Sharptooth tribe. Limited trade even began between lizardfolk and human, and the Vast Swamp lost a little of its mystery and dread to the Cormyreans, though they still declined to go near it.",
        "Notable locations": {
            "The Skull Staff": "[[File:Skull Staff.jpg|thumb|right|The Skull Staff, a territorial marker on the western fringe.]]\nJust within the swamp on its south-western border was the [[Skull Staff]], a 30-feet-high (9 meter) log jutting out of the ground, surrounded by many kinds of skulls, with more mounted on spikes and stakes. Built by orcs, it was a territorial marker for them and other tribes who held the area.",
            "The Lost Refuge": "[[File:Lost Refuge.jpg|thumb|right|The Lost Refuge.]]\nThe [[Lost Refuge]] was a Cormyrean keep placed near the border of the Vast Swamp. It supported a town as well but in the late 1200s DR, the combination of the expanding swamp and an orc attack killed the garrison and Cormyreans subsequently forgot all about the place.",
            "Orvaskyte Keep": "Sages agreed that [[Orvaskyte Keep]], discovered in the 1360s [[DR]] by adventurers seeking missing comrades in the swamp, was built by members of the kingdom of [[Orva]]. The keep was believed to have been built around the 7th century before [[Dalereckoning]], but was reported to be (in [[1374 DR]]) occupied by fiends and other monsters, which abruptly ended all considerations of exploring the place further.\n[[File:VastSwamp-Wheloon-Daerlun.png|thumb|right|250px|''Map showing the location of Orvaskyte Keep.'']]",
            "Elven Ruins": "As claimed by Sylara, last survivor of the Moon's Twelve, there was somewhere in the Vast Swamp a complex of ruined structures as old and as extensive as the famous [[Myth Drannor]]. This too was of [[elf|elven]] architecture, with carvings and murals illustrating elven kings and mages, all of which seemed to point to a heretofore unknown and forgotten elf kingdom that had once stood in these lands before the Vast Swamp grew. The truth of this tale and the elven ruins is unknown, but a number of other treasures of elven make, bearing elven imagery and archaic [[Espruar]] script, coming separately out of the Vast Swamp supported the Moon's Twelve's discovery.",
            "Other Locales": "Around 1374 DR, there was a frequently erupting [[Vast Swamp geyser|boiling water geyser]] located in the western Vast Swamp. It was surrounded by several hot springs, and the area was misty, muggy, and smelled of [[sulfur]]. Lizardfolk sometimes camped here."
        },
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Lizardfolk": "According to Brother Twick, the lizardfolk of the Vast Swamp were utterly savage, even compared to those in the Marshes of Tun, and matched all the worst depictions of lizardfolk. The evil atmosphere seemed to have affected these lizardfolk badly; they were said to be almost psychotic, attacking any outsider who even came close and relentlessly and obsessively hunting down [[human]]s, [[elves]], and [[halflings]]. Rather than follow the traditional lizardfolk god [[Semuanya]], they paid homage to evil spirits of nature and to fiends, especially the [[demon lord]] [[Sess'innek]]. Shamans of these lizardfolk fashioned strange altars and icons from the bones of animals and sacrificial victims, and there conducted brutal rites. He reported these lizardfolk gathered into tribal groups of only around a dozen members and that they were nomadic, erecting no permanent structures or shelters. They were led by especially cruel and wicked [[lizard king]]s who demanded the sacrifice of sentient beings like elves and humans, and would settle for killing and devouring their own followers.\n\nThe reality, however, was quite different when the adventurers in service to Mystra penetrated the Vast Swamp in 1374 DR and gained the aid of the friendly [[Sharptooth]] tribe and their allies, the [[Blackscale]]s and [[Poison Dusk]]s. These lizardfolk followed Semuanya, even [[Essylliss]]. Only the undead [[Shadowscale]]s, the former [[Dragonslayer (tribe)|Dragonslayer]] tribe twisted to suit a dragon's ends, were hostile.The depiction of Vast Swamp lizardfolk in ''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'' as [[neutral]]-aligned NPC allies for the PCs seems very much at odds with the description of them as evil and entirely savage in ''[[Elminster's Ecologies]]: The Cormyrean Marshes''. Furthermore, the lizardfolk are briefly confirmed to follow Semuanya, not demons. These differing versions are not difficult to reconcile, however. ''Elminster's Ecologies'' is presented with an in-universe point-of-view, so the narrator may be mistaken or lacking complete knowledge. It may be that, in-universe, this description pertains to lizardfolk in other tribes in another part of the swamp (such as those who raided the southern settlements of Battlerise and Monksblade) or to lizardfolk many years before. It is also possible that this mistakenly refers to the corrupted Dragonslayers/Shadowscales, or that the Shadowscales eradicated these dangerous elements first.\n\nSome of the known lizardfolk tribes were:\n* [[Sharptooth]]\n* [[Shadowscale]]\n* [[Blackscale]]\n* [[Dragonslayer (tribe)|Dragonslayer]]\n* [[Poison Dusk]]",
            "Hobgoblins": "Also according to Twick, the hobgoblin tribes of the Vast Swamp were also especially violent and xenophobic compared to their kin in other lands, assaulting all trespassers in their territory. There were several tribes who fought incessantly against each other. Most had enslaved goblins and [[kobold]]s to use as servants and fodder in battle.\n\nUnusually, these hobgoblins followed the mad god [[Cyric]]. They believed their conflicts would ultimately unite them under a single commander, who would then lead them in a unstoppable holy war against the human realms outside the swamp. They believed Cyric himself would arrive to lead their crusade, wielding a weapon so mighty that whole armies would flee at the sight of it and that it could cause castle walls to fall with but a touch.\n\nSome of the known hobgoblin tribes were:\n* [[Kyara]]\n* [[Norgath]]",
            "Grell": "A colony of [[grell]], numbering some sixty specimens spread over four hives, operated in the darker reaches of the Vast Swamp. Each hive was dominated by a patriarch of greater than normal [[psionic]] power. The grell's evil seemed related to the evil of the Vast Swamp, and they were feared and hated by all in the swamp.\n\nThe grell venerated the [[Imperator]]—perhaps a god of their kind—a colossal grell of enormous psionic power, who was reputed to lie under the surface of the whole swamp. The grell apparently believed this thing would lead the floating brains in a war of conquest and consumption. This also figured highly in local hobgoblin legends, which told of an enormous and highly cerebral grell lurking in caves under the swamp. The truth of this remained unknown.",
            "Other tribes": "Other specific tribes in the Vast Swamp included the [[Blood Moon]] and [[Darkstar]] orc tribes and [[Broken Dagger (tribe)|Broken Dagger]] and [[Scimitar (tribe)|Scimitar]] goblin tribes."
        },
        "Rumors and legends": "The popular image that city-dwellers had of swamps and marshes—as dark and dismal place of danger and death, disease, and dismemberment—while completely false when it came to natural wildernesses, was completely true when it came to the Vast Swamp. If it was widely imagined that evil lurked and festered in such places, then it was entirely likely it did in the Vast Swamp, and even authorities like Brother Twick were inclined to believe it and fear it would spread. There was, as yet, no tangible proof of this, but neither was there a better explanation. Nevertheless, all those who lived outside the Vast Swamp, namely the folk of Cormyr, shunned the place and shared all kinds of horror stories about what went on there.\n\nIt was commonly claimed that at one time dark magic was practiced here or that forbidden gods were worshiped, and this was the cause of the evil, but this was unverified. Nevertheless, evil [[magic]] was rumored to lay about the swamp. According to one legend, early inhabitants of the area once gave refuge to a vile [[demigod]] and were cursed for their deeds. Some speculated this was in fact a stunningly powerful beholder or the Imperator of the grell. More recent versions of this legend (post–[[Time of Troubles]]) told that it was the god [[Cyric]] who sheltered in the Vast Swamp, and his evil lingered.\n\nAccording to one legend, the notorious [[Dusk Lord]] of [[Sessrendale]] was not killed as history recorded, but instead escaped into the Vast Swamp. There, the story said, he plotted vengeance against all living beings in the [[Dalelands]]. The Dusk Lord was the most well known of the villains said to inhabit this land.\n\nThere were rumors of both mind flayer and beholders lurking in an ancient ruin close to the center of the marsh.This could well be the elven ruins reported by Sylara of the Moon's Twelve, who were ambushed and slaughtered by such abominations.\n\nThere was something to support the idea of an ancient elven kingdom once lying in this land, as several items of old elven design had been retrieved over the years. Furthermore, other treasures including elaborately ornamented crowns, amazing gemstones, scintillating armor pieces, and weaponry of exotic design and make had also been found, apparently created by different hands in different cultures and in different times. Perhaps these had originated elsewhere and been carried into the Vast Swamp by adventurers or raiders, but they hinted a number of lost and forgotten kingdoms that predated the Vast Swamp and were later buried in its bogs. Only a close archaeological examination could say for sure.\n\n[[Necromancy|Necromancers]] were reputed to make their homes in the Vast Swamp. Some stories even told that, somewhere deep inside the swamp, there was a ruined necropolis or some other complex of ruined structures. Herein dwelled a [[lich]] or even a whole cabal of liches, in tattered black clothing and wielding archaic and exotic weaponry, alongside countless [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s. From these liches, it was said, flowed an unremitting evil force that contaminated all that stayed overlong in the area.\n\nIndeed, Cormyrean investigators theorized that not only was the Vast Swamp slowly growing, but it had a malevolent influence on those outside. Incidences of violent crime, such as arson, brawling, feuding, and murder were apparently increasing in neighboring settlements in the 1360s DR. However, it was hard to say whether this was due to the evil of the swamp or merely to the troubles of that era.\n\nWorse still, several humanoid tribes and inhuman monsters foretold of an impending unification and subsequent holy war against the humans of Cormyr and surrounding realms.Although not specifically linked to the prophecies mentioned on pages 16 and 32 of ''The Cormyrean Marshes'' (bar the presence of allied grell and Cyric-worshipers), Despayr's actions in ''Tearing of the Weave'' share some similarity with elements of the prophecy, namely a war of unification (through transformation into undead) and service to an evil deity. However, there is no plan for a war on human lands."
