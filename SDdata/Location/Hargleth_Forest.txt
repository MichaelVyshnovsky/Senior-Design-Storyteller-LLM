The '''Hargleth Forest''' was a large forest located in eastern [[Eskorn]], [[Laerakond]].

==Description==
This forest was dotted with countless ancient ruins that dated back to the time when Eskorn was ruled by [[dragon]]s. The area was inhabited only by monsters and outlaws, and all roads and trails in Eskorn faded away in the forest.

The forest was good for hunting, either for sport or for food, and hunters from nearby [[Mistshaws]] usually hired adventurers to deal with monsters or bandits hiding in the forest.
