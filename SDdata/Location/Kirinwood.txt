Kirinwood was a large village on the coast of Cormyr.
Kirinwood was located on the north bank of the Kirinar Stream that flowed into the River Mistwater and the Dragonmere. It was inside a tiny forest of the same name that sheltered the village from strong coastal winds, and east of nearby bogs.
The village was strongly influenced by a druidic circle called the Talkers to the Trees, which oversaw the surrounding forest and strictly regulated what could be harvested from it.
The village lay in the agricultural heartlands of Cormyr amid a small wood tended by druids, making Kirinwood an excellent place to buy crops in bulk or seek guidance on matters of forestry. It had three mills that processed oats, corn, wheat, and the farmers market brought alfalfa, fruit, poultry, and eggs from surrounding farms. Nearby orchards supplied plentiful apples, while the bogs the west yielded blueberries and raspberries harvested with the aid of gawl crawlers.
The village made and sold a lot of fern-and-mint wine that cleared the throat and tasted like spruce bark. They also made a fiery mushroom ale and a famous mushroom gravy that was sent all across Cormyr and the Dragon Coast, both of which sold for 5 sp per hand keg.
Fine white sand was gathered from ridges north of Kirinwood and used in glassworking at Galandors Glassworks. This workshop made exceptionally fine glass objects, from simple marbles to finely-ground lenses and complex sculptures, and had customers from around the Sea of Fallen Stars.
The Kirinar noble family made their home in remote Kirinwood, and Ardest Kirinar founded a wizards school to win some influence and fame in the realm. His plans came to ruination when competing mages broke into a fierce spell battle that wiped out his student body, his whole family, and the lower levels of his estate-turned-school. The "Tower That Will Not Fall" continued to hover in place regardless, becoming a local attraction that was regularly checked by Purple Dragons to ensure nothing dangerous took up residence.
