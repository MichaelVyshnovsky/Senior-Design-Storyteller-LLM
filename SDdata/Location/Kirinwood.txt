'''Kirinwood''' was a large village on the [[Cormyr/Coast|coast]] of [[Cormyr]].

==Geography==
Kirinwood was located on the north bank of the [[Kirinar Stream]] that flowed into the [[River Mistwater]] and the [[Dragonmere]]. It was inside a tiny forest of the same name that sheltered the village from strong coastal winds, and east of nearby bogs.

==Government==
The village was strongly influenced by a druidic circle called the [[Talkers to the Trees]], which oversaw the surrounding forest and strictly regulated what could be harvested from it.

==Trade==
The village lay in the agricultural heartlands of Cormyr amid a small wood tended by druids, making Kirinwood an excellent place to buy crops in bulk or seek guidance on matters of forestry. It had three mills that processed [[oat]]s, [[corn]], [[wheat]], and the farmer's market brought [[alfalfa]], [[fruit]], [[poultry]], and [[egg]]s from surrounding farms. Nearby orchards supplied plentiful [[apple]]s, while the bogs the west yielded [[blueberry|blueberries]] and [[raspberry|raspberries]] harvested with the aid of [[gawl crawler]]s.

The village made and sold a lot of fern-and-mint [[wine]] that cleared the throat and tasted like [[spruce]] bark. They also made a fiery [[mushroom]] [[ale]] and a famous mushroom gravy that was sent all across Cormyr and the [[Dragon Coast]], both of which sold for 5 [[sp]] per hand keg.

Fine white [[sand]] was gathered from ridges north of Kirinwood and used in glassworking at [[Galandor's Glassworks]]. This workshop made exceptionally fine glass objects, from simple [[marbles]] to finely-ground [[lenses]] and complex sculptures, and had customers from around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==History==
The [[Kirinar]] noble family made their home in remote Kirinwood, and [[Ardest Kirinar]] founded a wizard's school to win some influence and fame in the realm. His plans came to ruination when competing [[mage]]s broke into a fierce spell battle that wiped out his student body, his whole family, and the lower levels of his estate-turned-school. The "Tower That Will Not Fall" continued to hover in place regardless, becoming a local attraction that was regularly checked by [[Purple Dragons]] to ensure nothing dangerous took up residence.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Daliver's Door]], a friendly inn.
* The [[Falling Tower]], the levitating ruins of the Kirinar wizard college.
* [[Galandor's Glassworks]], a famous [[dwarf|dwarven]] glassworks.
* The [[Old Troll's Foot]], a druidic restaurant.
* The [[Unicorn's Pool]], a high-quality tavern.

==Inhabitants==
* Sir [[Ajandor Surehand]] was a knight who retired to his family farm in Kirinwood.
