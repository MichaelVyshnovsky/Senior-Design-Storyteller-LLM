        "Description": "The Shistak Pass was a man-nade pass, a cut extending into the Keryjek Ridge {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} from the [[Angalpuk]] side and {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} from the [[Alpuk]] side, with the remaining {{SI|20|mi|k|long=yes}} in between incomplete. This has caused issues with adventurers and travelers, who found a dead end and were forced to turn around. Bandits from [[Eghagu]] took advantage of this and often ambushed these unfortunate travelers.",
        "History": "Construction on the pass began in {{Yearlink|1284}} when the residents of [[Hupiik]] and [[Isenghack]] realized a safe passage through the Keryjek Ridge would be advantageous for travel and trade."
