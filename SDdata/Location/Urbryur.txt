Urbryur was a gnome village in Altumbel circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
This village was carved into the cliffs on the southern coast of Altumbel overlooking the Thousand Swords archipelago and the Wizards Reach. It was directly south of the capital, Spandeliyon.
Chalk was the primary product of this enterprising village, but they did a lucrative business on the side for pirates that wanted to dispose of bodies in their lime pits or hide treasure in exhausted chalk mine shafts. The gnomes were scrupulous in their dealings, returning buried valuables even after many years of storage.
Clams were another commodity harvested by the Urbreir.
An occasional beached whale provided a bounty of substances that the gnomes put to good use. This happened often enough that humans in the region thought the gnomes had a way to lure whales to their death, either by magic or some natural ability, but had no evidence to prove this claim.
The many tunnels created by the Urbreir were extrapolated by rumor to delve deep into the earth, but the villages responded to inquiries about them with nothing more than a smile.
