The '''Valley of Dog-Men''' was nestled deep within the [[Kun-Yen Shan]] mountain range in the [[Hordelands]].

==Inhabitants==
A large colony of [[gnolls]] claimed this valley. The gnolls were originally summoned to serve a powerful [[wizard]], but stayed around and thrived after the wizard's death. As of [[1359 DR]] their numbers hovered around 400.

Their presence in the isolated valley gave rise to many legends about savage dog-faced men who abducted beautiful women.

A group of the gnolls clashed with inhabitants of the [[Valley of Exiles]] while they were out exploring for new territory.
