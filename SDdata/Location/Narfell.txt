'''Narfell''', also referred to as '''old Narfell''' or the '''Empire of Narfell''',<ref name=UE-p117">  was a once-great, albeit brief-lasting [[human]] empire that arose thousands of years before the [[Era of Upheaval]] in the [[Cold Lands]]. These strong-willed survivors lived hard lives, but still occasionally imperiled by the lingering effects of their wicked pacts with the [[Lower Planes]].

The name Narfell also referred to the country that remained after the empire's fall, a realm that encompassed the vast plains between neighboring nations.<ref name=UE-p189"> 
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
As of the last years of the [[Age of Humanity]], Narfell was a savage and inhospitable realm that attracted few outside visitors. It was home to migrant tribes of [[horse]]-riding [[human]]s known as the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]], as well as numerous long-abandoned ruins dating back to the fallen empire.

==Geography==
During the peak of its influence and power, Narfell stretched from the [[Giantspire Mountains]] eastward to [[Lake Ashane]],
and even the [[Endless Wastes]] beyond, extending south and east into the [[Great Dale]] and the [[Unapproachable East]].

The great [[Underdark]] domain of [[Earthroot]] lay in part beneath the lands of Narfell.

===Geographical Features===
Narfell was a dry, flat and infertile land, dotted with rocky outcroppings that supported little plant life beyond scrub grass.

====Bodies of Water====
* [[Icelace Lake]], the once-bountiful lake
* [[Teardrops]], a series of lakes that provided a bounty of fresh food to the Nar tribes.
*[[Lake Ashane]], an icy body of water, protected by various magical aquatic creatures and defining the southeastern border of Narfell.

====Forests====
* [[Rawlinswood]], the great forest of the northeast separated the plains of Narfell with the [[Great Dale]] to the south. 

====Hills & Mountains====
* [[Giantspire Mountains]], this massive yet sparsely-populated range separated Narfell from [[Damara]] to the west.
* [[Hark's Finger]], a mountain formed from the ruined [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Jiksidur]], that unceremoniously fell from the sky unto the plains of Narfell.
* [[Mount Nar]], the massive snow-capped peak that lay in the lands of Narfell<ref name=UE-p190"> could be seen from as far away as the crossroads village of [[N'Jast]].<ref name=UE-p190" />

===Flora & Fauna===
It was home to herds of [[reindeer]], wild [[ox]]en, as well as an especially large breed of horse known as the [[Nars]], that was quite popular among horse breeders in the region.

[[Tundra yeti]] were considered a distinct threat to the inhabitants of the land's grassy plains.

==Government==
The empire of Narfell was ruled by [[Nentyarch]] [[Thargaun Crell]], patriarch and founder of the [[Crell Dynasty]]. The reign of his descendants were succeeded by the [[Orgolath Dynasty|Orgolath]] and [[Darakh Dynasty|Darakh]] dynasties, until the empire's collapse.

==Society==
Following the fall of Narfell, the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] people remained among the plains of the Cold Lands, forming tribes of nomadic [[horse]]-riders that spread across from the Rawlinswood to the southern stretches of the [[Great Glacier]]. They gathered in temporary tent settlements known as "waymeets" while following the migration patterns of deer and oxen.

Few if any remnants of the ancient Narfell empire lived on in the Nar people,<ref name=UE-p189" /> unlike the legacy of the Raumathar that remained with the [[Hathran]] of [[Rashemen]].

===Culture===
[[File:Nar demonbinder.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Nar demonbinder]]s carried on the [[fiend]]-conjuring traditions of Old Narfell.]]
Imperialist Nar culture was wholly ingrained with the practice of conjuring and bargaining [[fiend]]s, as evidenced by the summoning chambers that have been found in each uncovered Nar fortress. Using mere ''[[glyph of warding|glyphs]]'' and [[ward]]s as their protection, Nar [[conjurer]]s frequently opened ''[[portal]]s'' to numerous layers of both the [[Abyss]] and the [[Nine Hells]].

===Magic===
[[Rune magic]] was commonly practiced among the imperialist Nar people, having learned some of its secrets from nearby [[giant]]s.<ref name=UE-p47"> 

Following the collapse of the empire, some [[Nar demonbinder]]s carried on the old dark ways of conjuring and binding [[demon]]s from beyond the [[Prime Material plane]].

===Religion===
The role of tribal [[shaman]] was held high within Nar society. These spiritual leaders solely drew upon blessings from their singular deity [[Tempus]].

==Trade==
Trade with outsiders was minimal among the tribes of Narfell, and they often exchanged goods with one another by means of barter. 

Traders occasionally passed through Narfell by means of the [[Long Road]], through the [[Giant Gap]] pass in the [[Giantspire Mountains]]. They would often continue on to the [[Cold Road]], passing by one of the country's few crossroad villages on their way to neighboring nations, such as [[Rashemen]].<ref name=UE-p190">

==Defenses==
The realm was defended by the different tribes coming together to repel foreign invaders

During the time of the ancient Narfell Empire the nearby lakes and seas was patrolled and protected Narfell Armada.

==History==
As the nation's history was long tied to that of neighboring Raumathar, it was only fitting that the two nations shared a common origin. Both realms were founded by mercenaries from the [[Old Kingdoms]] of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]], following the decline of their first respective empires, after they relocated north as bands of independent warriors. The collective fate of the Nar kingdoms were wrested from their control in the {{YearlinkName|-970}}, when the malevolent Thargaun Crell, Nentyarch of [[Tharos]], forged the [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Crown of Narfell]]''. Granted immense power by the crown, Thargaun established his seat of power at [[Dun-Tharos]] and began his campaign of conquest. Within a quarter century all of the kingdoms fell under the emergent empire of Narfell, beholden to Thargaun and his [[demon lord]] patron [[Orcus]], Lord of the Undead.

Just as Narfell became a preeminent power in the Cold Lands in the centuries that followed, so to did the burgeoning power of [[Raumathar]]. By the {{YearlinkName|-900}}, the two emergent nations had significantly risen in power and engaged escalating conflicts with one another. In the {{YearlinkName|-626}}, Narfell and Raumathar entered into a struggle for control over the lands surrounding [[Lake Ashane]]. Undeterred from this conflict, Narfell led a failed invasion of Mulhorand and Unther just a [[-623 DR|few years later]].

Having seen the first sign in the failure or decline in their power, the priest-kings of Narfell maintained their power through horrid blood-pacts with powerful [[demon]]s,<ref name=UE-p123">  gaining terrible and mighty [[sorcerous]] powers.

===Collapse of the Empire===
In the {{YearlinkName|-160}}, Narfell and Raumathar entered into what would become their final war,''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'' states [[-160 DR]] as the date where Narfell collapsed. ending with one final battle that saw the fall of two magnificent and terrifying civilization, along with the summoning of demon lords [[Kostchtchie]] and [[Eltab]] to the face of [[Toril]]. Ultimately it was the [[avatar]] of the deity [[Kossuth]] that incinerated each of the warring armies and each of the empires for which they fought.

Some empire's few survivors fled back to individual enclaves in Narfell, vowing to rebuild their mighty realm.<ref name=UE-p189" /> In the century that followed, neighboring powers carved out Narfell's outer territories for their own, such as the [[Suren]] [[barbarian]]s from the east and [[Impiltur]] from the southwest. Other refugees sought refuge in the forests and entered into a pact with a great nature spirit, transforming themselves into the beings known as [[volodni]].

===Legacy===
The horrific actions taken by the conjurers of the ancient Narfell empire left a lasting strain between the ongoing relationship between mankind and [[elves]] that monitored events in the region. The elves could not forget the atrocities committed by the ancient Nars<ref name=UE-p117">  or their corrupt magic Additionally, small remnants of the Abyss itself known as [[demoncyst]]s remained buried beneath Narfell and the surrounding landscape for centuries, holding onto horrific beings and previously enthralled fiends. 

Fiendish influence over the realm was made worse in the mid–9{{th}} century DR, when [[demon]]s that remained in Rawlinswood following the [[Fiend Wars]] were driven away from the forest, inadvertently unleashing a horde upon the tribespeople of Narfell. 

In the 300 years that followed, the [[Great Glacier]] receded from the Cold Lands, unearthing much of northern Narfell and offering more lands to be settled. The lands of Narfell experience waves of immigration from surrounding regions, and by the {{YearlinkName|1038}},<ref group="note">Page 34 of the 2{{st}} edition source ''[[The Bloodstone Lands]]'' states that the [[Great Glacier]] covered all of Narfell as of 300 years before [[1359 DR]]. This appears to be retconned in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)]]'', as this timeline is pushed back an additional 300 years. The ''FRCS 2e'' timeline is corroborated in the ''[[Great Glacier]]'' sourcebook and subsequent 3{{rd}} edition material. During this time, fiends continued to run rampant over the countryside of Narfell, remnants of the former empire's lust for power. 

Starting in the 11{{th}} century DR, the [[Knights of Imphras II]] of Impiltur devoted their service to [[the Triad]] by destroying the demons and [[devil]]s that continued to blight their neighboring lands, including Narfell.

===Emergence of the Tribal Nar===
The dream of rebuilding the Narfell empire had long since faded by the 14{{th}} century DR. By then, Narfell was a frigid land of approximately 20 [[barbarian]] Nar tribes, nearly all of which had little or no knowledge of their ancestors' sinister past, merely preoccupied as they were with simply surviving though the bitter winters that wracked their homeland. 

When the [[undead]] hordes of the Witch-King [[Zhengyi]] marched across neighboring lands in the 1350s DR, the tribes of the Narfell endured collective peril and prepared for war. They were spared the horrors of warfare however when the forces of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] intercepted the Witch-King's armies and wrought victory for the region during the [[Bloodstone Wars]]. 

During the mid–15{{th}} century DR, changing weather conditions led to increasingly harsh and more frigid climate for the Nar tribes. Some desperate members sought out the powers once-wielded by those in the Narfell empire, establishing permanent homes near ancient ruined fortresses and once-again engaging in the art of demonbinding.
