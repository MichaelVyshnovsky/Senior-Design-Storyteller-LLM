The '''Moonlands''' was a region that was located east of the [[River Surbrin]] and north of [[River Rauvin]] in the [[Silver Marches]].

==Description==
{{Climate/Silver Marches/Open country|the Moonlands}}
The southern part of this region was densely populated, but away from the river, the landscape soon turned into a real wild land. The landscape was characterized by meadows interspersed by rolling hills and thick stands of woods.

==History==
The Moonlands were the territory of the [[Uthgardt]]. The ancestral mounds of the [[Black Lion tribe]] and [[Red Tiger tribe]] were near [[Beorunna's Well]], up in the north, while the [[Sky Pony tribe]] was located in the environs of the [[One Stone]] down in the south. There were some disputes in this region since  Uthgardt's Sky Pony tribe attacked many caravans of [[dwarves]] directed from [[Citadel Felbarr]] to [[Silverymoon]]. Hot-head dwarves of Felbarr, who were brave stalwart defenders, were considering driving the Sky Pony [[barbarian]]s away from the area; this would surely cause both sides to suffer many losses.
