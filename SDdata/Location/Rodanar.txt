Rodanar was a town located in the country of Chessenta during the midâ€“14 century DR. 
The town lay on the northwest shore of the Akanamere in western Chessenta, just south of the Akanapeaks.
Some 5,000 people lived in Rodanar in the , and 1,000 of these belonged to the garrison. Rodanar was led by a warrior named Hyurkes.
The war god Tchazzar founded Rodanar to serve as a fortress to thwart orc incursions from the Akanapeaks. Rodanar used to be a large city, but a war with Akanax during the 12 century DR left it in ruins. The new Rodanar that sprung up since was much smaller.
