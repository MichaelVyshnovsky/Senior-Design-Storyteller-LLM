'''Huthduth''' was a small fortified [[Chauntean]] monastery and keep in the [[Storm Horns]] of western [[Cormyr]].

==Geography==
Huthduth lay in a small wooded valley of the Storm Horns east of the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]], on the edge of the mountains and the foothills two days west of [[High Horn]].

==Trade==
The inhabitants of Huthduth raised flocks of [[sheep]] on the hills and slopes nearby, and harvested wild berries, [[parsnip]]s, and alpine sprouts. They made a kind of [[wine]] from the parsnips, and shared their food and drink freely with guests for up to three night's stay.

==Rumors & Legends==
[[Volo]] speculated that a powerful [[archmage]] resided in Huthduth, and it may have been home to a valuable secret, person, or treasure.

==Inhabitants==
Huthduth was home to a population of friendly yet well-armed [[priest]]s, who watched over their flocks of sheep via [[scrying]] spells and ''[[teleport]]ed'' to them when threatened. Hungry [[orc]]s, monsters, and [[adventurer]]s that preyed on the sheep found themselves suddenly surrounded by serious-minded priests prepared for battle, with a penalty of 1,000 [[gp]] or a significant service to the monastery, such as slaying a nearby threatening creature. To regular visitors they were perfectly hospitable, offering food and lodgings for three nights, and freely exchanging news of the outside world for their own knowledge of nearby ruins, mines, lairs, and other sites of interest.

The spirit of its founder [[Huthduth (monk)|Huthduth]] continued to reside at the monastery, sometimes appearing during religious rituals and watching on with approval.
