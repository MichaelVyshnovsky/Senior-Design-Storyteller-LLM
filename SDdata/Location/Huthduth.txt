Huthduth was a small fortified Chauntean monastery and keep in the Storm Horns of western Cormyr.
Huthduth lay in a small wooded valley of the Storm Horns east of the High Road, on the edge of the mountains and the foothills two days west of High Horn.
The inhabitants of Huthduth raised flocks of sheep on the hills and slopes nearby, and harvested wild berries, parsnips, and alpine sprouts. They made a kind of wine from the parsnips, and shared their food and drink freely with guests for up to three nights stay.
Volo speculated that a powerful archmage resided in Huthduth, and it may have been home to a valuable secret, person, or treasure.
Huthduth was home to a population of friendly yet well-armed priests, who watched over their flocks of sheep via scrying spells and teleported to them when threatened. Hungry orcs, monsters, and adventurers that preyed on the sheep found themselves suddenly surrounded by serious-minded priests prepared for battle, with a penalty of 1,000 gp or a significant service to the monastery, such as slaying a nearby threatening creature. To regular visitors they were perfectly hospitable, offering food and lodgings for three nights, and freely exchanging news of the outside world for their own knowledge of nearby ruins, mines, lairs, and other sites of interest.
The spirit of its founder Huthduth continued to reside at the monastery, sometimes appearing during religious rituals and watching on with approval.
