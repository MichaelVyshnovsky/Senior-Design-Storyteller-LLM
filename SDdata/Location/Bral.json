        "mainbody": "The city of Bral was full of rogues and unsavory characters of all kinds.\nNevertheless, everyone was polite to everyone in the city of Bral; [[mind flayer]]s could be seen conversing with [[elves]] and [[dwarves]] with [[beholder]]s. This was not because they were friends; rather, the city had a policy of \"check your vendettas at the docks\". A simple walk down any of Bral's main streets would introduce a visitor to hundreds of languages.\n\nHumans maintained the highest population, but almost all manner of races lived here. The city contained several districts where the various races were dominant. These included:\n* [[Burrows (Bral)|The Burrows]], where many [[halfling]]s lived;\n* [[Dwarven District (Bral)|The Dwarven District]];\n* [[Dracon Enclave|The Dracon Enclave]];\n* [[Forest (Bral)|The Forest]], where many [[elves]] lived;\n* [[Giff-town]]; and\n* [[Shou-town (Bral)|Shou-town]].\n\nAlso found in the city of Bral were [[gnome]]s, beholders, and mind flayers. [[Neogi]] were not welcome in Bral.\n\nWhile severely overcrowded, there was little poverty in Bral, because there was always work to be found, even if it was hard work at the docks, and visiting ships very often took on new crewmembers.\n\nThe nobles of Bral were the 37 persons besides the prince who actually owned land on the small asteroid. All other lands belonged to the prince, and all other citizens rented from him or the nobles.\n\n===Religion===\nThe city contained a number of temples, mostly located near Lake Bral. In addition to many faiths or pantheons from [[Toril]], there were also churches for the [[Polygot]]s, [[Pantheists]], the Church of [[Ptah]], and [[the Path and the Way]]. Nonhuman faiths also had a presence in Bral.",
        "Description": "[[File:Rock of Bral topside map 5e.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A map of the city of Bral.'']]\nThe city of Bral was built on the upper side of the Rock of Bral. The underside was reserved for agriculture and for government property.\n\nThe city was divided into two or three main sections, termed the [[High City]],<ref> the [[Middle City]],<ref> and the [[Bral/Low City|Low City]].<ref> The High City was located on the \"trailing end\" of the asteroid as it traveled through [[wildspace]]. Here was located the castle of the prince. A great wall and [[Lake Bral]] separated the High City from the rest of Bral.\n\nAt the leading edge of the asteroid were the Low City and the docks. Here was where most of the [[spelljammer]]s would arrive for trade. There were cavern warehouses for storing goods and hoists for lifting things up to the surface. The Low City also contained a dry dock where spelljammers designed to land on a flat surface instead of on water could park. As one passed from the Low City to the Middle City, inns and shops replaced the taverns and ale houses. As one continued on, the prince's palace could be seen beyond the greenery of the noble's villas.",
        "Government": {
            "Law and Order": "[[Piracy]] and [[slavery]] were both officially illegal, but charges were generally only pressed if the prince wanted to get rid of the accused. Betrayal of Bral was the ultimate crime and could include simple treason against the crown or doing something that put the whole asteroid at danger, such as starting a fire, which could deplete the [[air envelope]]. Those guilty of such a crime might be handed over to the [[illithid]] embassy to be eaten.\n\nHowever, for the most part, laws were absent in Bral, and there was not even a city watch to keep order in the streets."
        },
        "Trade": "Bral was the epitome of free trade. Money was power, and anything and everything was bought and sold there, from a vast number of worlds and [[crystal sphere]]s. Bral was full of shops and contained two major open-air markets, the [[Great Market]] and the Lesser Market, usually called the [[Thieves' Market|Thieves' Market]]. Musicians and entertainers filled the streets, hoping to earn [[copper]]s for their songs.\n\nCoinage from at least thirty different realms was known to be accepted in Bral, but paper currency was not accepted from even the most powerful nations. Coins from other locations would need to be exchanged by the Royal Exchequer, with a 5% service fee applied. The Royal Exchequer accepted coins from at least 100 different countries.\n\nThe cost of living in Bral was much higher than in other places, and most things cost half again as much as they would on the surface of a planet. Rent for an apartment in the Low City cost anywhere from 5 to 30 [[gold piece]]s per month. A cheap room at an inn would cost about 3 gold per month, while a fancier room might be as much as 8 gold per month.\n\nA laborer in Bral earned about 12 gold per month, while a longshoreman earned double that. The agent for a merchant might take home as much as 40 gold per month.\n\nFour distinct groups engaged in trade in Bral: the large trading companies, who dealt in bulk materials; the smaller, familial merchant houses, who usually specialized in a unique type of cargo; small merchants, shopkeepers, and the owners of inns and taverns; and, finally, independent spelljammer captains.\n<!--==Defenses==-->",

        },
        "History": "The settlement that would one day become Bral began near the start of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]] as a pirate hideout for the [[Black Brotherhood]], whose leader was one Captain [[Bral (pirate)|Bral]]. When Bral fell in an ambush to [[elves]], the remaining pirates on the Rock named their town after him.\n\nOver time, the population of Bral shifted, until by the end of the 13{{th}} century, there were more merchants and shopkeepers in the city, selling goods and ale to the pirates, than pirates themselves. One pirate, Captain [[Cozar]], saw this as an opportunity. He purchased all land in the city and the rest of the asteroid from the merchants and forced any pirates to lease from him or run actual businesses if they wanted to remain. In this way, Cozar became ruler of the city above all the other pirates.\n\nPrince Cozar ruled remarkably fairly for a former pirate, and the city thrived and grew as a legitimate center of trade, as trade turned out to be more profitable than piracy.\n\nPrince Cozar's successor, Prince [[Frun]], was not as good a ruler as his father. Nevertheless, the city continued growing from its trade, as companies from at least twelve different crystal spheres established businesses there. Frun commissioned the building of the [[Citadel (Bral)|Citadel]] and the [[Donjon]] and rebuilt and expanded the royal palace.\n\nAt one point during Frun's 35-year reign, he had insulted a [[neogi]] trader, which triggered an attack from a neogi fleet set on razing the city. They succeeded in destroying a part of the Middle City by crashing an abandoned [[dwarven citadel]] into it, but then retreated.\n\nAfter Frun died, Prince [[Calar]] ruled for only six days before being assassinated by being jettisoned into space. His brother, Prince [[Andru]], then took the throne. Within fifteen years, Andru had doubled the size of Bral's army, tripled the size of its navy, and strengthened the law-enforcement of the government.",
        "Notable Locations": "[[File:Rock of Bral 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A view of the Docks.'']]\nThe city contained a graveyard, although most of the dead were cremated, composted, or set adrift in wildspace.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The older and more superstitious citizens of the city believed that Bral would one day be destroyed by the asteroid's original inhabitants.\n\n<!--==Inhabitants==-->"
