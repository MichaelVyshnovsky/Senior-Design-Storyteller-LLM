'''Ironfang Deep''', sometimes mistakenly labeled as '''Ironfang Keep'''

==Description==
Ironfang Deep was an independent mountain city-kingdom that stretched deep into the heart of the Alaoreum. It was one of the very few non-human settlements of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Government==
Ironfang Deep was ruled by "the most wise and humble King." King [[Anthrus Strongarms]] guided the city-kingdom through the treacherous [[Turmish War of 1220]] and the bloody [[Campaign of Darkness]] against [[duergar]].

==Trade==
Historically, and resulting from bitter conflicts with the [[human]]s of the Reach, proud Ironfang was wary of outsiders, evaluating the motives of others with extreme cynicism. Despite that, the dwarves engaged in a great amount of trade, mostly with their Turmite neighbors and an occasional merchant from [[Telpir]]. Ironfang Deep purchased Turmish goods and traded it for mined precious metals and various minerals. Ironfang was especially renowned for its great-quality [[gemstone]]s and [[gold]].

==History==
[[File:Alaoreum Mountains.png|thumb|''A map of [[Turmish]] and the [[Mountains of the Alaoreum]] circa [[1370 DR]].''|270x270px]]
As the human population started settling in the Vilhon Reach by the {{YearlinkName|-37}}, dwarves of the Orsraun Mountains have already been flourishing in Ironfang. The human settlements started engaging in trade with the dwarves.

Peace between secluded dwarves of Ironfang was shattered in the {{YearlinkName|1220}}. Turmish warlord [[Sjorn Sendreth]] went to war against his dwarven neighbors, spreading death across the [[Alaoreum]]. The conflict lasted for 20 years, filled with Turmite attacks and dwarves defending against aggressors.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Campaign of Darkness was long over; however, clashes with duergar were still quite common, keeping the dwarves of Ironfang on high alert. The [[goblin]]s of the [[Ancient Ax]] tribe have menaced Ironfang seemingly for countless centuries and, as of the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], remained a constant threat, regularly helming attacks on the city-kingdom.

==Notable Locations==
Ironfang had a minor shrine to the human deity [[Helm]], the Vigilant One.
