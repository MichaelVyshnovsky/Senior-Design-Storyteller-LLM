'''Still Waters''' was the name of a haunted swamp in the [[Shadowfell]].

==Description==
The waters were cold and dark, and appeared to be entirely motionless.

The swamp was inhabited. Rickety paths of cut trees connected huts that sat atop stilts.

==Geography==
Still Waters lay along the [[Shadowfell Road]] somewhere between [[Endless Alleys]] and [[Veil (town)|Veil]]. The road was made of lashed-together logs, and [[vehicle]]s had to be careful when traversing this stretch. Other paths branched out in different directions, potentially making the road difficult to follow.

==Inhabitants==
The swamp was home to various [[shadowborn]] who wore blindfolds so as not to see their own reflections in the waters. They lived together in hamlets and traveled the waters on [[skiff]]s piloted with long poles. They took no interest in travelers along the Shadowfell Road, and offered  no warnings about the dangers of the water.
