        "mainbody": "Gana, the \"City of Riches,\" (together with Jumlat) gave the group of the Pearl Cities of west Zakhara their name because pearl diving was one major source of wealth.\nAnother source of wealth was from the nearby wasteland to the west called the Realm of Bleeding Trees where frankincense and other aromatic gums could be collected. Trade with these and other commodities gave Gana the well-earned title \"City of Riches\" as even its lower classes were better off than elsewhere.\nMany of Ganas citizens were involved in the pearl diving business which was fully active for five months out of the year.\nGana held the annual Festival of the Pearl after the close of each pearl diving season. This was followed by the Sultans Great Task of the Pearl where bold adventurers were challenged with scouring the land in search of wondrous items to present to the Sultan.\nGanas city watch was comprised of 5,000 soldiers. The city also hired an additional 2,000 mercenaries to serve as infantry. Ganas navy numbered 30 ships in 1367 DR. Additionally, Ganas rookery, found east of the city in al-Yabki Mountains, held five highly trained Zakharan rocs and riders.\nGana was suspected of hiring privateers to harass and hinder pearl diving ventures from rival Jumlat.\nA bold sea monster was blamed for a string of missing ships sent out to harvest pearls. The Sultan offered a reward of 50,000 dinars for anyone brave enough to kill the creature or prove that it did not exist."
