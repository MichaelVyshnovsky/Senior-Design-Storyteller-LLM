Watchers Knoll was a good sized hill with a clearing at the top located in Shadowdale. The knoll could be found northeast of Shadowdale, in the forest.
A large stone pillar or plinth dominated the top of Watchers Knoll. This plinth has been used as a watchtower, when necessary, from the time of Aencar the Mantled King.
Watchers Knoll contained the burial site of Aumry and Syluné Silverhand.
In 1297 DR lord Joadath slew dozens of worshipers of Tyr atop Watchers Knoll.
