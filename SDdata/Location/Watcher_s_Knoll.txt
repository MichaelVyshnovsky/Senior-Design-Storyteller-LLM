'''Watcher's Knoll''' was a good sized hill with a clearing at the top located in [[Shadowdale]]. The knoll could be found northeast of Shadowdale, in the forest.

==Features==
A large stone pillar or plinth dominated the top of Watcher's Knoll. This plinth has been used as a watchtower, when necessary, from the time of Aencar the Mantled King.

Watcher's Knoll contained the [[Aumry's Tomb|burial site]] of [[Aumry]] and [[Syluné Silverhand]].

==History==
In [[1297 DR]] lord [[Joadath]] slew dozens of worshipers of [[Tyr]] atop Watcher's Knoll.
