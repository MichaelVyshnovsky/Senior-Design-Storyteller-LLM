The '''Bowl of Loneliness''' was a great dune field located in [[the Sword]] region of the [[Anauroch]] desert.
{{Quote|It's like an ocean.|The outlander Lander, describing the endless dunes of the region.}}

==Description==
The Bowl of Loneliness was an immense basin of white whaleback dunes, which looked like a stormy ice ocean from the distance.

Outside the Bowl, the yellow and white sand dunes grew smaller and more easily traversable. Their gradual slopes rose no more than {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} above ground level and were inset with pathways formed by the many people and camels that traversed the region.

==Geography==
The Bowl of Loneliness was located on the far eastern stretch of the Sword, between the oases of [[El Rahalat]] and [[El Ma'ra]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Zhentarim raiders ambushed the travelers [[Ruha]], [[Kadumi]], and [[Lander]] as they were traveling across the Bowl of Loneliness.
