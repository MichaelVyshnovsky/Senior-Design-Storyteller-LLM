        "mainbody": "lgoths Beard was a hamlet on the north bank of the river Chionthar, within sight of the Sea of Swords. It was home mostly to poor shepherds and fishermen. The purpose of the settlement was to warn Baldurs Gate of pending attacks or pirate raids.\nThe beacon was located on the cliffs at the mouth of the river. Ulgoths Beard was named because the beacon was said to metaphorically singe the beard of a pirate named Ulgoth, whose attack was robbed of surprise by the beacon.\nthumb|A map showing Ulgoths Beards location west of Baldurs Gate.\nTo travel to Ulgoths Beard, one was required to navigate rolling grassy hills or arrive by boat as there was no road. Ulgoths Beard also had no tavern or inn. The closest thing to a tavern was a local who sold poor quality home-made ale.\nThere were few notable inhabitants of the hamlet except for an eccentric mage by the name Shandalar. The wizard lived in a floating house just east of the settlement, made from a converted Halruaan skyship."
