        "mainbody": "The '''Damaran Gate''' was a massive fortification in [[Damara]] that completely spanned the eastern end of [[Bloodstone Pass]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} It and the [[Vaasan Gate]] (on the western end of the Pass) comprised the '''Bloodstone Gates''', one of the most ambitious feats of military engineering in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "The Damaran Gate stretched 3 miles (5 kilometers) from mountain-to-mountain to completely block Bloodstone Pass and span the [[Beaumaris River]]. \n\nThe wall was 35 feet (11 meters) tall and 20 feet (6 meters) thick, and two castles built into the mountainsides anchored the wall on either end. The castle on the southern end of the Gate was the larger of the two, and housed the [[Order of the Golden Cup]], while the castle on the northern end guarded tunnels leading to [[Bloodstone Mines]]. Only three iron gates allowed for access through the fortress: two large gates, one by each of the castles, and a third smaller gate in the center which was only large enough for a single rider at a time to pass through.",
        "Geography": "Bloodstone Pass ran through the [[Galena Mountains]], connecting Damara on its southeastern end to [[Vaasa]] on its northwestern end. By spanning the Pass on the eastern end, any traveler or invader that wished to enter Damara from the Pass would need to either besiege the Damaran Gate or travel around the mountains entirely.",
        "Defenses": "The Damaran Gate's crenelated walls were defended by massive watchtowers positioned at 300-yard (275-meter) intervals. Each tower was garrisoned by fifty Damaran soldiers and was equipped with [[ballista|ballistae]] that could be used to defend against attacks from the air.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|8}} The Gate's garrison was supplemented by [[paladin]]s from the Order of the Golden Cup.\n\nThe individual gates connected to courtyards inside the fortress, and were [[magic]]ally warded. They could be operated by complex [[dwarf|dwarven]] mechanisms that allowed a heavy portcullis to to be raised by just two soldiers operating a windlass.",
        "History": "After the defeat of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the [[Bloodstone Wars]], there was a pressing need to fortify Bloodstone Pass against future incursions from the remnants of his armies. The project was massive and costly, and was largely funded with wealth acquired by Gareth and his adventuring companions in the course of defeating the Witch-King.\n\nOn [[Mirtul 2]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, both the Vaasan and Damaran Gates fell over the course of one night to a horde of Vaasan monsters rallied by the [[lich]] [[Sammaster]], who had declared himself to be the new Witch-King. Two members of his [[Cult of the Dragon]], [[Avarin]] and [[Fodel]], infiltrated the Damaran Gate as soldiers, and opened the Gate to allow Sammaster's horde to seize the smaller castle of the otherwise impregnable fortress as a prelude to launching a full-scale invasion of Damara.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1469}}, the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] seized control of Bloodstone Pass, penetrating the Vaasan Gate and razing [[Bloodstone City]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}{{BloodstoneCityRazing}} They then garrisoned both the ruins of the city as well as the Vaasan Gate, and sealed the Pass.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} The Damaran Gate was put on high alert, and remained that way for decades. King [[Yarin Frostmantle]] ordered that the Gate be regularly patrolled and be fully stocked to weather a siege. However, King Frostmantle lacked the loyalty of many of his vassals, whose cooperation was necessary for the continued defense of the Gate. Many of them despised him as a usurper, and he in turn was known to execute anyone who suggested as much, raising concerns that Damara would not be ready if and when the Warlock Knights attacked again.",
