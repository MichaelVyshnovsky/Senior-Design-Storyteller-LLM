'''Swanmay's Glade''' was a portion of the [[Wealdath]] forest located in its southern reaches.

==Geography==
This region of the forest included the [[Nebulae Pool]] and the [[Calathalureenteir]] stream from which it was fed.

==Trade==
[[Human]] merchants were forced to conduct their business with the elves on the banks of the Calathalureenteir. They were not allowed any further into the forest.

==History==
The region earned its name from the old fire than ravaged this area of the Wealdath. It reduced the thicket of trees to an open glade in the middle of the forest.

==Notable Locations==
Perhaps most notable landmark of Swanmay's Glade was the [[elven]] treetop city of [[Suldanessellar]].

==Inhabitants==
The resident elves kept way many who tried to intrude on their land. They were more tolerant of [[human]]s and extremely discriminatory towards [[goblin]]s.

Despite its name the region was not known to house any actual [[swanmay]]s.
