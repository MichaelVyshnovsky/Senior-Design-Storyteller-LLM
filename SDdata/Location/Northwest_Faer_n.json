In the northernmost reaches of the region, these deciduous trees gave way to coniferous ones, such as [[larch]]es, ponderosa [[pine]]s, [[spruce]]s, [[tamarack]]s, and white pines.",

The well-traveled and all-too-famous Volothamp, in the aforementioned guide, himself split it into a set of five: The [[Dessarin Valley]], along the matching [[River Dessarin]]; the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]] upwards of Waterdeep; the [[Frozenfar]]; and the rest, the Interior, making up the area surrounding Silverymoon and fellow [[Sundabar]]. Given the purposes of his work, Volo chose to exclude the [[High Forest]] from his categorization, though acknowledged that its size alone made it a worthy candidate."
