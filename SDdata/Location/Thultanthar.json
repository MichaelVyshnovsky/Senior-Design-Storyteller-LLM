        "Geography": "On [[Toril]], Thultanthar was located in the middle of the [[Anauroch]] desert along the [[Black Road]] trade route connecting the [[Silver Marches]] with [[Cormanthor]], in the area of the [[Bedine]] tribes. Near the city was the [[Shadow Sea]], and the [[Scimitar Spires]] range surrounded both the lake and the city on three sides (all except the north).",
        "History": {
            "Origins": "Thultanthar was created in the year {{Yearlink|-1471}}, Thultanthar's high mage, known only as [[Lord Shadow]], experimented with the [[Plane of Shadow]] for some time and successfully shifted the entire city into the Plane of Shadow mere days before [[Karsus]] cast ''[[Karsus's Avatar]]'' and temporarily destroyed the [[Weave]] in the [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR]]. For some reason, however, Lord Shadow could not move the city back to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It took weeks but eventually, they managed to return to Netheril, or at least what was left of it. Searching for survivors for days, the city floated over the ruins of the [[Netheril|Netherese empire]]. Finding none, Lord Shadow assumed it was the work of the [[phaerimm]] and began planning his revenge. He stopped, however, when he realized that one city was not a match for them and that his subjects were likely the last of the empire's people. He abandoned those plans and retreated back into the Plane of Shadow, vowing that one day, they would return and reestablish the empire.\n\nThe city's clerics of [[Shar]] cast [[divination]]s and saw what had really happened, but only informed the noble families, presumably on the whim of Shar herself for some reason. The excursion into the Plane of Shadow, due to unforeseen circumstances, lasted much longer than Lord Shadow anticipated.",
            "Return": "On [[Hammer 1]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], Thultanthar returned to Faerûn after the [[elf]] [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] finished a spell to bring Shade back to [[Toril]] where the shadovar, led by [[Telamont Tanthul]], found themselves floating over the [[Dire Wood]]. as well as spying on, sabotaging, and even trying to destroy those people and places that could possibly hinder\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, Thultanthar was brought to ground by [[Elminster]]. It fell upon [[Myth Drannor]], destroying both cities."
