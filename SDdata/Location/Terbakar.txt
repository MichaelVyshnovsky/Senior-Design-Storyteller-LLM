'''Terbakar''' was the ancient capital of [[Bakar]] in the [[Raurin]]. The [[river Athis]] had once sprang from within the [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]] in the city.

==Description==
Terbakar's ruins were visible from the tops of dunes {{SI|5|mile|k|long=yes}} away,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|40}}

In {{yearlink|1356}}, after the Pyramid of Amun-Re was plundered and the curse lifted, the river Athis began flowing again, slowly refilling its banks over the years.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|61}}{{Cite dragon/424/Martek and the Desert of Desolation|17}}

==History==
Terbakar served as the capital of Bakar; it was built close to the magical spring of the River Athis, along which the entire kingdom of Bakar was situated. The capital was known as a jewel of the desert. Its pharaohs had ruled for time out of mind, and though its libraries were noted in some circles, the Waters themselves were what was revered.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|4}}

By the year {{yearlink|300}}, the Pharaoh [[Amun-Re]] constructed a pyramid to serve as his own tomb. To finance its construction, he raised taxes and waged war on neighboring kingdoms. Discontent rose in response to the pyramid's construction; the pharaoh was slain during a riot.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}} His dying curse caused the spring of the river Athis to refill no longer, causing Terbakar, in fact the whole of Bakar and the entire river basin, to depopulate quickly.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|5}}
