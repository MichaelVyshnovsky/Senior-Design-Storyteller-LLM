'''Moortown''' was a small community located in the [[Bottomless Bogs]] of [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Description==
The small town was encircled by an eroded earthen and stone wall built on the remains of an earlier palisade.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|62}} Moortown was meant as a stopover for merchants, and so contained warehouses, stables, and at least one inn&mdash;the [[Swamphouse Inn]].{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|63}}

Life in Moortown was harsh and dangerous. 

==Geography==
Moortown lay within the Bottomless Bogs alongside the [[Beaumaris River]]. It sat at an important point along [[Dead Man's Walk]], the main road passing through Vaasa from east to west.

==Trade==
In the 15{{th}} century DR, the town was part of Vaasa's western trade route. Harvested materials and other goods were floated down the river to [[Kond]] for wider distribution,{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} while taking in goods via the trail to [[Avang]] and the [[Dead Man's Walk]] that led to points across Vaasa.

==History==
The town was initially founded in the 13{{th}} century DR{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1269}}. The original town was built by an expedition of settlers seeking to create a trading post midway between the [[Bloodstone Mines]] and the [[Moonsea North]]. However, it was soon overrun by monsters and [[humanoid]]s coming out of the surrounding bogs, leaving the ruins inhabited by [[giant rat]]s and [[hairy spider]]s. Even so, the town was repeatedly resettled over the centuries, with new arrivals dreaming of taming the vast marshlands around the site and discovering their rumored hidden treasures.

The town stood in ruins as of the {{YearlinkName|1359}},{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|55}} Their garrison included a number of [[dragon]]s, several [[Ring-nose]] [[orcs]], and a handful of [[troll]]s who were strong-armed into serving as guards. The Cult of the Dragon continued to operate in and around the town for over a century despite repeated attempts to stamp them out. They were rumored to still be active in the area as of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, by which time the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] were in control of the town.

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Swamphouse Inn]], the most intact building in town as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
* A [[Temple of Tempus (Moortown)|temple of Tempus]] which lay in ruins as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
