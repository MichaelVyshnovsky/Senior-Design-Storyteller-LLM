The Moonbridge was a magical, invisible bridge in Silverymoon,
The Moonbridge crossed the River Rauvin, connecting Northbank, the older section of the city, with Southbank. and relied on talismans of power buried on each shore to sustain its magics.
The Moonbridge was a large, gentle arch, constructed of magical force. Many considered it more impressive to behold than any of the slender and graceful towers of the city, and some even claimed that Lurue could sometimes be seen dancing over the bridge. It was fourteen feet wide and two feet thick and rose 60 feet above the water at its highest point. The bridge contained no walls or railings, and was perfectly smooth. It was not known to have had any weight limit&mdashdragons had sat on it without any issue. It was usually invisible by day, but by moonlight, it glowed with a silver sheen.
The bridge could be "turned off" in the middle to function as a "drawbridge" and allow ships with tall masts to pass by When this occurred, anyone standing on the bridge would be moved with the receding ends as they unjoined and pulled away from the middle.
The Moonbridge was linked to the protective wards of Silverymoon. A bearer of such a staff could also cause gravity to be reversed on the surface of the bridge, or erect a wall of force to block passage across it. Alustriels six Sisters, as well as Taern Hornblade, Jorus Azuremantle, and Sernius Alathar had also been given control over the bridge.
In 384 DR, a human tribe, whose name is lost to history, first constructed a crude wood-and-rope bridge over the river at the site that would one day be Silverymoon.
Decades later, in 403 DR,
After the Spellplague of 1385 DR, Silverymoons mythal healed itself, reforming out of the Moonbridge after Mystras return to life.
