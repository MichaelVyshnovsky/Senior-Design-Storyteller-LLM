The '''Bridge District''' of [[Athkatla]] was one of the city's poorer quarters, situated on the southern reach of the [[Alandor River]], just south of the [[The Bridge (Athkatla)|bridge]] that spanned its waters.

It was home to a fair number of low-end businesses, tiny hole-in-the-wall shops selling second-hand or illegal wares. Many of these catered to the merchants and travelers who made their living along the caravan routes.

==Description==
The district had narrow, winding streets lined with rowhouses of some of the poorer Athkatlan citizens. Among these were the city's laborers, street-side cart vendors, shop assistants and the like.

==Notable locations==
*[[Bordryn's Bucket]]: The tavern of choice for the locals of the district
*[[Delosar's Inn]]
*[[Mithrest|Mithrest Inn]]
