        "mainbody": "Southern Ward was the southeastern sector of the city of Waterdeep. It was named for the many settlers from southern Faer√ªn as well as its geographic location within the city. As of the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR, only outsiders called it South Ward, according to famed author Volo in his Waterdeep Enchiridion. Interestingly, this custom changed from just the opposite, as reported by Volo in his Guide to Waterdeep written in the early 1360s DR.\nThe northern boundary with Trades Ward lay across Telshambras Street and Caravan Court. On the west and south side was Dock Ward across the Way of the Dragon. To the east, the Ward was bounded by the city walls (circa 1372 DR), specifically the \"Trollwall\", which included the southern inner gate leading to the Caravan Grounds and the South Gate beyond.\nThe stretch of buildings and alleyways in this Ward that stood between the Way of the Dragon and the High Road was an area that locals referred to as the Tween Run.\nThis was considered the \"poor\" ward and was often known as Caravan City due to the large numbers of caravan merchants, teamsters and guards that swelled the population of the ward most of the year.\nDust and mud were common on the streets and most buildings were old, multi-story tenements with shops or businesses on the ground floor. adjacent to the Jade Dancer one of the best-known festhalls in the city.\n* The Jade Dancer Tavern and festhall famous for its dancing statue.\n* The Moon Sphere Appeared in Dancing Court when the full moon was out.\n* The Full Cup Caravan workers and haulers choice.
