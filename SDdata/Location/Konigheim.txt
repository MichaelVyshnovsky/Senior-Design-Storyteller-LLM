'''Konigheim''' was a city and kingdom in the [[Utter East]] of [[southeast Faerûn]]. It was one of the [[Five Kingdoms]] of the Utter East.

==Geography==
[[File:Utter east tharkar.jpg|thumb|right|''A map of the Utter East showing Konigheim and its neighbors.'']]
It stood near the southernmost river of the Utter East, south of [[Doegan]] and north of the [[Web Mountains]] (part of the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]]) and the [[Land of the Yak-Men]].<ref group="note">Although not specifically stated, the geographic location of Vanesci Hamlet as being in Konigheim is determined by comparing the game map of ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' with standard maps of the region.

==Description==
Konigheim was a city of cobblestoned streets with the occasional park or monument, tiled plazas, and crenelated forts and short towers. In the northwest, an aqueduct curled through the city to supply water, while a round keep stood in the southeast. The buildings were constructed of stone and had chimneys, with wooden doors, window shutters, pillars and beams, and roofs, and all seemed to burn really well.

==History==
===The Bloodforge Wars===
King [[Grewe]] of Konigheim discovered the first of the [[bloodforge]]s in the [[648 DR|Year of the Dancing Daggers, 648 DR]]. These ancient devices of war could mass-produce entire armies of [[basal golem|living golems]], eliminating overnight the cost of mustering and maintaining armed forces. Within [[tenday]]s, more were found across all the Five Kingdoms. Losing all restraint, turning war-mad, the [[Ffolk]] rulers of the Five Kingdoms each manufactured great golem armies and marched them against one another, bursting into the [[Bloodforge Wars]].{{Cite document

====Nuts and !Bolts====
[[Garrulos]] and [[Wormskull]] were a pair of feuding, treasure-hunting brothers who delved into an ancient barrow tomb and discovered the [[Pearl of Power]], an [[artifact]] that could make arcane inventions come alive. Garrulos immediately snatched it for himself, cheating his artificer brother of the glory, and took it to Konigheim to present to the king, "for safekeeping". Incensed, Wormskull tried to seize back the Pearl, triggering the [[Nuts and !Bolts]] (''sic'') conflict, which saw Konigheim itself attacked and devastated.<ref group="note">In the ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' game, two alternate campaigns are provided, one for Garrulos and one for Wormskull. These appear to be mutually exclusive and an official history is unknown.<ref group="note">This king may be the same as the King Grewe of Konigheim, the first to discover the bloodforges, mentioned in ''The Grand History of the Realms'' page 95.

;Garrulos

[[File:Nuts And !Bolts Garrulos 2b.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Hey, at least the fire is out.'']]
:To seize the stolen Pearl, Wormskull led a bloodforge army against Konigheim, starting fires in the city and interrupting Garrulos's audience with the king. Missing out on his reward, Garrulos was forced to battle his brother with a bloodforge army of his own, and to get to and breach the city's aqueduct in order to flood the city and extinguish the fires, causing a different kind of disaster.

:In the chaos, Wormskull pinched the Pearl and carried it away to the [[Puzzle Palace]] for his own plans. Garrulos followed to find his brother and get justice, and battled him there in another bloodforge battle.

:Finally, Garrulos confronted Wormskull in his workshop in the [[Hall of Wonder (Utter East)|Hall of Wonder]], where the artificer revealed he'd installed the Pearl inside a great machine, creating the [[Juggernaut (Wormskull)|Juggernaut]]. In a third bloodforge battle, Garrulos was forced to destroy the machine. Afterward, he reclaimed the Pearl of Power and returned it to its resting place in the tomb, for safekeeping.

;Wormskull
[[File:Nuts And !Bolts Wormskull 1b.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Garrulos presenting the Pearl of Power to the king of Konigheim, interrupted by lack of actual Pearl.'']]
:Secretly, Wormskull went to Konigheim and stole back the Pearl, embarrassing his brother before the king when he presented an empty chest. Wormskull returned to his workshop in the Hall of Wonder, planning to use the Pearl in his inventions. Garrulos found him there and they fought a bloodforge battle, but Wormskull was victorious.

:Making plans for his grand invention and revenge against society, Wormskull hunted for three components hidden inside statues within the Puzzle Palace. Though Garrulos tried to stop in another bloodforge battle, Wormskull was successful.

[[File:Nuts And !Bolts Wormskull 4a.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The reign of King Wormskull was probably good for the construction industry.'']]
:With these components, Wormskull finishing construction of the Juggernaut and animated it with the Pearl of Power. Riding it at the head of his bloodforge army, he assaulted and burned Konigheim, defeating his brother's bloodforged defenders. Humiliating his brother and reigning over the ruins of Konigheim, Wormskull had his victory and vengeance. However, he realized he'd forgotten to include a way to turn off the still-rampaging Juggernaut...

====During the Legendary Campaign====
Afterward, a Festival of [[Talos]] was held in the city, but somehow this tribute to the god of destruction turned to disaster. Another fire started in the heart of the city, spread swiftly to nearby buildings, then grew into a huge blaze that threatened to destroy all of Konigheim. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] discovered the arsonist [[Illnar Dreth]] was the culprit and decided to punish them in a [[bloodforge]] battle amidst the burning city.

Later, when the Legendary Campaign leader rested in Konigheim, the mage [[Gareth Gimorrin]] attacked with a rain of fire in an effort to stop the campaign. Alerted by a watchman, the leader fought Gareth in a bloodforge battle through the once-again blazing city.

Towards the end of the Bloodforge Wars, Konigheim was watched over by a benevolent order headed by [[Saja Stillwater]]. They were capable combatants and nigh invulnerable whilst occupying the keep. However, yet another catastrophic fire swept through the city, drawing Stillwater's order out into the streets. The Legendary Campaign leader seized the opportunity to strike in a bloodforge battle.
