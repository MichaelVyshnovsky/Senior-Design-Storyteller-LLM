'''Ebenfar''' was an empire in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]] that lasted from the 1{{st}} to the 4{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Geography==
The Ebenfar Empire stretched south from its capital city of [[Ebenfar]] in the [[High Moor]] to encompass the [[River Chionthar|Chionthar Valley]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==History==
The empire was founded shortly after the {{YearlinkName|34}}, when [[Verraketh Talembar]] found the ''[[Shadowstar]]'' in the [[High Moor]]. This mysterious [[meteor]]ite transformed him into the "[[Shadowking]]" as he gathered an army of [[shadow-spinner]]s and began a campaign of conquest against nearby [[Netherese]] and [[Talfir]]ic populations. to steadily gain strength and territory over the following decades.

After King [[Terpenzi]] of neighboring [[Najara]] received a vision in the {{YearlinkName|89}}, foretelling his own death at the hands of the Shadowking, he made preparations to go to war against Ebenfar. He assembled a massive army of [[ophidian]]s and [[yuan-ti]], and in the {{YearlinkName|90}}, they attacked. However, the forces of Najara were beaten back all the way to their capital, [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]], which was destroyed by Ebenfar's armies and its ruins cloaked in [[ward]]s. With his kingdom destroyed and people scattered to the [[Serpent Hills]], Terpenzi led his remaining armies into a final clash that resulted in his destruction. The battlefield on which he was defeated came to be the namesake for the [[Fields of the Dead]].

Under the continued reign of the Shadowking, the empire would go on to persecute its Talfir subjects, including the nobility. In the {{YearlinkName|140}}, a large group led by [[Gwynneth (person)|Gwynneth]] would flee across the [[Sea of Swords]], becoming the ancestors of the [[Ffolk]] people of the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|32}}

The Shadowking would eventually become imprisoned beneath what would become [[Iriaebor]]. Without him, the empire of Ebenfar collapsed in the {{YearlinkName|323}}. Its [[human]]-ruled successor states continued to rule the Western Heartlands, but were steadily undermined by the resurgent Najara.

==Inhabitants==
The kingdom was ruled by humans of the Talfir and Netherese ethnicities.

Notable inhabitants included:
* [[Verraketh Talembar]], the Shadowking.
* [[Talek Talembar]], son of the Shadowking.
* [[Markus Randol]], an Archduke of Ebenfar in the 2{{nd}} century DR.
* [[Gwynneth (person)|Gwynneth]], daughter of Markus Randol and a Talfiric leader.
* [[Deric]], son of Gwynneth.
* [[Taylor]], consort to Gwynneth.
* The noble [[Hugh Dynasty|Hugh]] family, whose descendants would go on to found the [[Cymrych Dynasty]] of Moonshae High Kings.
