        "mainbody": "'''Death Heart''', formerly known as the '''Heart of the Void''', was a city located within one of the major doldrums of the [[Negative Energy plane]]. Considered a nexus of [[evil]] and [[undeath]], it was largely unexplored by outsiders, with even the [[Doomguard]] and [[Dustmen]] fearing it. It was also considered to be one of the most stable locations within that [[plane]].",
        "Description": "This city had many tall spired structures, plazas, squares, streets, and fountains. It stood within a metal sphere that was {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} in diameter, protecting the city from the baneful [[negative energy]] of the plane it floated in.",
        "History": "Death heart originated from a long dead, alternate [[Prime Material plane]] as an experimental utopian community free of other schools of thought. At some point it drifted into the Negative Energy plane, though some believe that it was an attempt to establish a colony within that plane. When it entered the Negative Energy plane the city was overrun by [[undead]], who proceeded to feast upon the flesh and souls of its inhabitants.\n\nOver time various evil factions developed among the city's undead and they engaged in a near endless war with one other.\n\nAt some point it became connected to [[Faer√ªn]] by means of a [[portal]] placed within a tunnel complex in the mountains of [[Thay]] by the [[necromancer]] [[Zzarka Tuzarr]]. She would occasionally participate in the warfare among the factions for the sole purpose of amusement.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Strongholds of Undeath Portals:The Portal of Negative Energy}}",
        "Inhabitants": "Death Heart was entirely inhabited by a wide variety of undead creatures. Most notably, several [[lich]]es and powerful [[vampire]]s claimed this place as their home.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some rumors claimed that this city was home to many of the most foul creatures of the [[multiverse]].\n\nRumors propagated by the [[mercane]] claimed that a vampiric [[minotaur]] brokered a peace among the various factions in Death Heart, encouraging further research into the nature of both the city and the Negative Energy plane.\n\nThe mercane who propagated these rumors speculated that the vampiric minotaur sought to one day steer the city into another plane and wreak havoc with the city's undead."
