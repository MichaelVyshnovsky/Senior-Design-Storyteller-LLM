Hawa, also known as City of Chaos and the City of Stilts, was the only important settlement within the Genies Turban in the Corsair Domains. 
Circa 1357 DR a fleet of the mamluks of Qudra tries to take control of the city. The attack is beaten back with severe losses to the Qudran navy, an event that is still celebrated every year by Hawas citizens.
Around 1367 DR, Grima al-Auni, the hill giant cleric of Kor fought against an increasing number of Istishia cultists in the city.
The city had a reputation as a rough place of independent and sometimes ferocious inhabitants, many of whom were involved in piracy. Despite this reputation, most of Hawas residents considered themselves to be enlightened and civilized. Hawa boasted mosques to Hakiyah, Kor and Najm. Hawa was also called the "City of Stilts" by its residents, for many of its houses were built directly over the water.
