Lerren was a village in Tethyr that supplied the city of Ithmong (later Darromar) with food.
Lerren was a small hamlet of about 80 to 100 persons living in 12 to 15 simple homes. The village was surrounded by farmland. The villagers divided up the land into smaller fields with fences and tall bushes, where they cultivated root crops, such as potatoes.
Lerren was located in the county of Monteshi, in the duchy of Ankaram in Tethyr. The village was located west of the city of Ithmong about  south of Ithal Road and  north of the River Ith.
In 1358 DR, the village was headed by a man named Dolgan, a friend of the Company of Eight.
During the Time of Troubles, many of the crops in Lerren and the surrounding villages were destroyed in the chaos of that world-shattering event. A month after the Time of Troubles ended, however, things did not return to normal. Instead, the population of monsters in the region seemed to increase, and this led to a shortage of food in nearby Ithmong, which relied on Lerren and other nearby villages for food. In particular, the fields had been badly torn apart by land sharks.
These monsters were, in fact, summoned to the region by a series of Thayvian beacons as part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield and Inselm Hhune to prevent Ernest Gallowglass from rising to power over all of Tethyr&mdasha position that Hhune himself wanted&mdashduring the time of anarchy known as the Tethyrian Interregnum.
The Company of Eight became involved and hired a group of adventurers to investigate the area and determine the cause of all the monster attacks, sending them first to this village.
