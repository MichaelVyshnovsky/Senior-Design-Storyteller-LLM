        "mainbody": "City\nThe Thurid Reefs, formerly known as Thuridru, was a city turned close group of coral reefs in the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThe reefs were said by Elminster to be colorful and quite beautiful.\nThis area was originally founded as the city of Thuridru in 216 DR, as part of the merfolk kingdom of Eadraal. \nIn early 11 century DR Thuridru became immersed in a territorial skirmish with ixitxachitl over some of the kelp beds along the slopes west of Mount Teakal and Voalidru. In , the ruling Kamaar Clan willfully broke one of the Laws of Battle of Ser√¥s wherein they destroyed one of the chitl cities through an ignoble ambush. For their violation of the Laws of Battle, Eadraals then-king Kosul I chose to punish Clan Kamaar by having them exiled to the Xedran Reefs and forced to resettle upon the site of their crime. There they would go on to found a new settlement under the same name as their old one, Thuridru.\nEver since its abandonment, the city became a place that was shunned by most merfolk. Over time, numerous corals and reefs grew up around the city, until it became known as the Thurid Reefs by 1290 DR."
