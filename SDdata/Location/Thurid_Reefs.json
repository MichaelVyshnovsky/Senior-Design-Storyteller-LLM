        "Description": "The reefs were said by [[Elminster]] to be colorful and quite beautiful.",
        "History": "This area was originally founded as the city of Thuridru in [[216 DR]], as part of the [[merfolk]] kingdom of [[Eadraal]]. \n\nIn early 11{{th}} century [[DR]] Thuridru became immersed in a territorial skirmish with [[ixitxachitl]] over some of the [[kelp]] beds along the slopes west of [[Mount Teakal]] and [[Voalidru]]. In {{YearlinkConvert|1073|TS}}, the ruling [[Kamaar|Kamaar Clan]] willfully broke one of the [[Laws of Battle]] of [[Ser√¥s]] wherein they destroyed one of the 'chitl cities through an ignoble ambush. For their violation of the Laws of Battle, Eadraal's then-king [[Kosul I]] chose to punish Clan Kamaar by having them exiled to the Xedran Reefs and forced to resettle upon the site of their crime. There they would go on to found a new settlement under the same name as their old one, [[Thuridru|Thuridru]].\n\nEver since its abandonment, the city became a place that was shunned by most merfolk. Over time, numerous [[coral]]s and reefs grew up around the city, until it became known as the Thurid Reefs by [[1290 DR]]."
