'''Aurilssbarg''',<ref group="note">The name of the settlement may mean "[[Auril]]'s mountain": Aurilssbarg was subject to freezing winters and icy storms (associated with the goddess, Auril), and it was located on the [[Ice Peak]], a mountain ''(barg)''." was the largest settlement on [[Ice Peak]] island.

==Description==
Aurilssbarg was a small town of about 3,000 citizens. It acted as a general trading post for incoming traders (mainly from [[Luskan]] who had established a monopoly), as well as those of [[Bjorn's Hold]] and [[Icewolf]]. Wares such as [[scrimshaw]], [[oil]]s, animal skins, and other provisions were traded. The other settlements of the isle did not have a dock large enough to serve ships from the mainland, and thus did not have a say in which communities they sold to.

The ground and paths of Aurilssbarg were made up of felled tree trunks. The buildings were also made of wood, and their roofs were covered in turf. [[Green Hall]], the local tavern, was known as the "heart" of the town, and several [[goat]]s were cooked for its patrons.

==Defenses==
A standing army of 100 soldiers manned up to six longboats. The town also owned a [[Striker (ship)|striker]], a powerful type of ship in the [[North]] that could hold up to 44 soldiers, four ballistae, and a ram.

==Inhabitants==
The residing [[Northmen]] were eager to hear any major news from the mainland.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Ascore]] arrived in Aurilssbarg. The leader of the small town, [[Tranjer Rolsk]], told his guards to capture the heroes, so he could turn them over to Luskan for a reward.
