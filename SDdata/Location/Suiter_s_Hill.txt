'''Suiter's Hill''' was a small rustic yet prosperous [[human]] town in the [[Vast]], far from the bustling metropolis of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|2}}

==Description==
Suiter's Hill was located about three weeks' worth of travel northeast of Ravens Bluff. The town had strong ties to merchant organizations, including those that ventured across the seas to [[Maztica]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|4-6}}

The town proper was laid out around its main street with the [[Temple of the Vigilant]], a once-majestic temple dedicated to [[Helm]], placed at its end. Interiors of many buildings and establishments in town were decorated with Maztican ornamentations – furniture, wall decorations, [[ceramic]] [[mask (object)|masks]], sculptures of bone, [[clay]], [[gold]], [[rose quartz]], carved [[obsidian]], and [[tapestries]] of woven feathers.

==Government==
The town of Suiter's Hill was run by the local [[Church of Helm]]. The city's Mayor was a member of the clergy, and the High Watcher was the town's sheriff. Aside from these two positions of power, the clergy had the governing power. The sheriffs wore gold-foiled stars that bore Helm's Unsleeping Eye.

==Trade==
Its main industry was farming and agriculture, and in the years after the colonization of Maztica, it became famous for growing vast fields of the rare Maztican species of maize, or corn. Maztican corn took to the town's fields wonderfully and quickly influenced its trade and culture, being the only producer of Maztican corn in all the Vast. The town also raised [[horse]]s, [[cow]]s, [[chicken]]s, and [[hog]]s.

To no surprise, Suiter's Hill's cuisine was thoroughly corn-centric – everything made with corn meal, [[corn bread]], [[corn-on-the-cob]], [[corn pone]], corn [[relish]], [[corn chowder]], h[[ominy stew]], [[popped corn]], and many other maize dishes.{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|10}}

==History==
In the late 14{{th}}, the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Suiter's Hill became strangely cut off from the rest of the Vast, and its corn fields turned into a [[fiend]]ish "reality wrinkle." All was done by a powerful [[ultroloth]] called [[Eyes of Fire]], who was imprisoned in Maztica and brought to Suiter's Hill. The fiend spread its influence out of its obsidian prison after the [[Baglin Brothers]] robbed and torched the local temple of Helm, killing the town's sheriff – High Watcher, and the High Priest. Without the priest, Eyes of Fire was able to spread its magic out and started plotting its freedom. When odd things began happening in town after the fire, Mayor [[Jeb Galtin]] sent a word to Ravens Bluff, offering a payment in exchange for the help of the Living City heroes.

The heroes' investigation proved fruitful. They discovered an obsidian box – a sarcophagus that impressed the fiend. Its magic was damaged during the Baglin Brothers' robbery. Jeb Galtin's daughter, the [[paladin]] named [[Cassie Galtin|Cassie]], deputized adventurers as honorary members of the church and made them the Deputy Watchers. In their investigation, the adventurers cared with endless swarms of [[crow]]s that plagued the corn fields, all driven into frenzy by the fiend, as well as attacked by animated [[scarecrow]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|11}} and enthralled villagers and village elders who were preparing the Eyes of Fire's release.{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|17-18}}

On the second day of the investigation, enthralled villagers finished the construction of a pyramid that would be used for a ritual sacrifice to release the Eyes of Fire. The enthralled cultists kidnapped Cassie Galtin, intending her to be the sacrifice. The heroes battled [[Matthias]], whose body was inhabited by the ultroloth while trying to spare innocent villager lives. Eventually, the creature was defeated and sealed once again by the reassembled Xoxitlhuachi's golden snake idol.{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|19-21}}

Subsequently, any and all damage done to the town was quickly repaired and the temple rebuilt, thanks to the booming lucrative corn trade. Some of the Helmite adventurers from the Bluff took over the Temple of the Vigilant, and some even suggested that one of them wed Cassie Galtin.{{Cite organized play/LC/Out in the Cornfield|24}}
