'''Jastaath Castle''' was the name given to a massive ruined fortress that sat high on [[Mount Nar]] in [[Narfell]].

==Description==
The ruins were immense, and sat atop the western slopes of the mountain above a glacier. They were buried under a perpetual blanket of snow and ice.

==History==
The castle had been the seat of power for the ancient [[Nar]] kingdom of [[Jastaath]]. In ancient times, the magic of Jastaath's [[Nar demonbinder|demonbinders]] had altered the weather on Mount Nar to make the castle warm and comfortable even in the winter, but after it was abandoned for unknown reasons, the castle fell into ruins that became buried beneath snow and ice.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], no explorers had successfully found the ruins owing to the harsh climate and the [[dracolich]] [[Kryonar]], who laired nearby and was known to kill any visitors to the area.

At some point around or before the {{YearlinkName|1439}}, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Branimern Rythil]] and her minions arrived at the ruins seeking the lost [[magical]] knowledge of Jastaath's ancient demonbinders. They destroyed Kryonar and erected a towering stronghold amidst the castle ruins, which was visible from as far away as [[Bildoobaris]]. From her stronghold, Branimern spent the next several decades researching and plotting to conquer the surrounding areas. All the while, the local Nars stayed away from the ruin out of fear that Kryonar might still be alive.

==Inhabitants==
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the castle ruins were home to Branimern Rythil and her [[demon]] and [[fey]] minions, including a fearsome [[fomorian]] known as [[Hughan]].
