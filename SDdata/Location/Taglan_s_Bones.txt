Taglans Bones was a large freshwater swamp on the isle of Thelve in the Sea of Swords, west of the library fortress of Candlekeep.
Taglans Bones was located on the western end of Thelves northern shore. A quicksand laid at the swamps heart, and it emptied into saltwater Cauldron of the Reach.
The swamp was named after a pirate captain who stashed his treasure there, only to be murdered by his vengeful crew at the swamps center.
