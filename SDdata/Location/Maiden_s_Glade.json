        "mainbody": "aidens Glade, also known as Eridis in the language of Illefarn, was a glade near the Mere of Dead Men along the Sword Coast North. \nLocated between Fort Locke and Highcliff, Maidens Glade was a clearing and a retreat for druids, rangers, animals, or any traveler.\nThe inhabitants were druids, rangers, and animals, who protected this place.\nAround 1374 DR, the glade was where druids and rangers would protect the land from intruders. However, the King of Shadows influence had an impact on the land, causing the local druid Kaleil to be trapped and enraged in the form of a bear, allowing the animals to attack travelers and intruders. The Kalach-Cha, paired with Elanee, could attack Kaleil and learn of the shadow presences in the Mere of Dead Men before Kaleil died."
