        "mainbody": "The '''Flame Fault''' was a volcanic crevasse located on the island of [[Tuern]] on the [[Trackless Sea]]. It was famously the home to the trio of [[red dragon]]s that ruled over the island of barbarians.",
        "Description": "The Flame Fault was deep, and fire and smoke constantly poured out from it. Owing to this active geothermal activity, prospectors were likely to find [[diamond]]s and [[adamantine]] ore in the Fault.",
        "Geography": "It was located in the western mountains of the island, and was one of many volcanically active sites on Tuern.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Fault was famously home to a trio of red dragons who terrorized Tuern and several of the neighboring islands.  The various kingdoms on Tuern (and elsewhere within their range) would send them gifts of food, [[slave]]s, and treasure to placate them. \n\nThe Fault was the only place where wild [[giant strider]]s could be found. Given these creatures' close relationship with [[firenewt]]s, it was likely to find them there as well.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the isle's red dragons were effectively the rulers of Tuern and were even worshiped by the island's [[human]] inhabitants. Around that same time, a clan of [[fire giant]]s was plotting to overthrow them.\n\nAt some point during the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} a group of adventurers ventured into the Flame Fault<ref group=\"note\">While not explicitly stated as occurring at the Flame Fault, the location depicted in the ''[[Tyranny of Dragons (comic)|Tyranny of Dragons comic]]'' is described as the \"island's great volcano\", the lair of one its three red dragon rulers. and slew one of the Tuern's three red dragon overlords,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 2}} precipitating a rampage of the surviving two over the island.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 3}}"
