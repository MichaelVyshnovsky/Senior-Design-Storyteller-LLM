'''Tirumala''', sometimes called the "Holy City," was a rich city-state in the [[Beastlands]] ruled over by a [[rakshasa]] of the [[Tirumala (rakshasa)|same name]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The city was located among seven "holy hills" which sat at the northern end of the [[Curna Mountains]] south of [[Durpar]] and north of [[Estagund]].

==History==
The city sat atop the ruins of a [[Durpari]] settlement that had been destroyed by [[giants]]. The old ruins were reclaimed and rebuilt by Tirumala, who claimed that the site was sacred.

Later, in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the city signed a unique trade agreement with [[Estagund]] which mystified the people of that realm, none of whom could believe that their raja would agree to such terms. In truth, the raja's trusted vizier, [[Devang]] was secretly a rakshasa in league with Tirumala.

==Inhabitants==
Tirumala was primarily populated by rakshasa nobility, [[orc]] and [[hill giant]] soldiers, [[kenku]] spies, and [[slavery|slaves]] of [[human]], [[halfling]], and kenku origins.{{cite web |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124212752/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1183344200298979328| title= Ed's Twitter |date=2019-10-13 |accessdate=2024-03-17}}
