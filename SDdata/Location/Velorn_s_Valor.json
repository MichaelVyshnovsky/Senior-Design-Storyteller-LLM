        "mainbody": "Velorns Valor was a small town in Turmish that accepted refugees from across the country â€“ Morningstar Hollows, after Alaoreum River turned their home into uninhabitable bog.\nBy the late-14 century DR, Velorns Valor was a market-town that catered to cattle ranchers.\nLike so many other Turami settlements, Velorns Valor was named after a hero of antiquity. Velorn valorously stood against orcish warbands that threatened Turmish. Velorns heroics were remembered fondly, and his battered, reportedly authentic shield was proudly displayed on a wall of the towns council hall.\nVelorns shield became the talk of the town in the late-14 century DR when it was discovered that its backside contained a portable hole. A mysterious treasure map was fished out from the hole. The city council immodestly became absorbed by debates on what to do with the map. The council kept the location of the map a secret, and the shields portable hole was kept away from prying eyes."
