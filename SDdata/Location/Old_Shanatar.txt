Old Shanatar was one of the major domains of the Underdark. It lay beneath west Faerûn, and stretched for hundreds of miles under Amn, Tethyr, and Calimshan.
It was once home to the mighty dwarf realm of Deep Shanatar, for which it was named. By the 14 century DR, all but one been overrun, conquered, or simply destroyed at the hands of drow, mind flayers, and duergar.
Compared to the other major Underdark domains, Old Shanatar had the most non-natural tunnels, passages, and halls, though some were of amazingly huge scale. Just like the Northdark, inhabitants and adventurers alike had fairly well explored and mapped the passages of Old Shanatar.
