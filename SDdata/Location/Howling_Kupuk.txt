The '''Howling Kupuk''' was a pass through the [[Lugsaas Chain]] mountains that connected northeastern [[Vaasa]] to southern [[Alpuk]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Description==
The pass was narrow and prone to avalanches. It was named for the native [[kupuk]] of the Alpuk region, whose [[Kupuk#Rumors_.26_Legends|eggs]] were often the object of the northward expeditions of adventurers, explorers, and collectors who used the trail. However, any howling to be heard was more likely from [[winter wolf|winter wolves]].

During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the pass was an entry point to the [[Great Glacier]], and the mountains on either side of it were completely encased in pure white ice and snow.

==Geography==
The Howling Kupuk pass traversed the Lugsaas Chain from south-to-north just west of where they met the northern tip of the [[Galena Mountains]].

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the trail that ran through the pass originated on the Vaasan side north of [[Palischuk]] at the base of the [[High Walk]]. It traveled north along the Galenas and passed [[Ishe]] before entering the pass and crossing the stream. It then turned east toward [[Frohm's Rest]] on the north shore of [[Taak Lake]].

The pass itself was only about 10 miles (16 kilometers) long.
