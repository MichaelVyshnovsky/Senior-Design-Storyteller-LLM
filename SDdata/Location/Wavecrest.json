It was situated close to the mouth of the Vilhon Reach.\nIt benefited from the protection of reefs and also the magic of the Emerald Enclave. The Eyes of Silvanus were formed from mountains when Jhaamdath fell. Those members of the Emerald Enclave who sought to master wilderness survival, reportedly traveled to  Wavecrest. The island was known for its untamed jungles full of mysteries and danger. However, the Enclave did not share its knowledge of the island with outsiders."
