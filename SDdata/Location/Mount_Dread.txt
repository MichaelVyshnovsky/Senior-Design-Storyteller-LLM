'''Mount Dread''' was an underground complex near [[Shadowdale]]. By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was a monster lair once used by the evil mage [[Azazabus]].

==Description==
The dungeon was near Shadowdale.

==Geography==
Presumably, Mount Dread must've been in a mountainous region.

==Structure==
Of note, the most immediately accessible level contained a small underground tower-like structure, where a wall once held a ladder to a higher level; that level had since collapsed, leaving the ladder a path to nowhere. One room in the same level was an old prison, and a room used by [[orc]]s.

The lower level's layout wasn't known, but it included an old library, a paper-walled room made by [[giant wasp]]s, and a mine shaft.

==History==
Part of the lower level connected to an old mineshaft, strongly implying the location was originally a mine.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Mount Dread was the lair of numerous monsters that attacked locals near [[Shadowdale]], making local authorities call for adventurers; the same heroes who braved the [[Tomb of Damara]] and [[Harrow Hill]] might've been among them. Before that, Mount Dread had been the center of activities once for the evil mage [[Azazabus]].

As they progressed into the dungeon, they might've encountered a gnome, [[Tinker]], who needed a special [[silver]] spring for a certain, secret project. They may also have come across a number of [[gnomes]] who were looking for a special glowing moss there, which they required for a catapult meant for their king. Another mage, [[Kordak]], could've come across them. He'd have tried to ''[[charm]]'' them or otherwise make them kill a [[brown bear]] that had taken up residence nearby, before trying to kill them.

Should they have pushed into the lower level, they may have chanced upon a [[lammasu]] also took temporary shelter there to examine an old library, and a [[duergar]] called [[Axerock]], whose treasure was stolen by [[drow]].
