'''Chalarstaukh''' was the largest [[goblin]] realm in the [[Rauvin Mountains]] in [[Luruar]].

==Geography==
Chalarstaukh was located in the [[Chalarstaukh caverns]] in the western foothills of the Rauvin Mountains, not far from [[Citadel Felbarr]].

==Government==
In [[1372 DR]], King [[Asglarek]] and his seven sons ruled Chalarstaukh.

==Inhabitants==
Chalarstaukh was inhabited by goblins, who subsisted on yellow cave-worms. This habit meant that the Chalarstaukh goblins were called "Worm-Eaters" by the [[orc]]s above, who often raided the goblin warrens.

==History==
In the 1370s DR, the goblins of Chalarstaukh delved southwest of their home and discovered a number of [[dwarf]] tombs. The goblins ransacked the tombs, finding a number of magical items they intended to use against their enemies—if they ever figured out how to use them.
