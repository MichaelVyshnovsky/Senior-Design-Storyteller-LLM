        "mainbody": "Baldurs Gate was the eponymous city gate that gave the famed port city of the Sword Coast its name. It was one of the oldest Baldurian landmarks, located in the heart of the city, that separated the aristocratic Upper City from the working-class Lower City. In fact, by the 15 century DR, it had become a symbol that embodied the class struggle between the citys rich and poorer citizens.\nThe gate was inset within the citys old wall. Heading south through the gate led to The Steeps in the Lower City, while the street north from the gate separated the Temples District from The Wide.\nDespite its name, Baldurs Gate was the most ordinary of the citys numerous walled passageways.\nPrior to the citys Tax Revolts, Baldurs Gate was the only means to reach the city from Gray Harbor. The uproarious event was actually caused by city officials enacting taxation of goods that passed through this landmark.\nIronically, after the revolts were settled, the newly formed Council of Four put in place very similar tolls on the gate that benefited the citys government. These taxes continued for centuries and, as of the , cost 5 cp to each individual."
