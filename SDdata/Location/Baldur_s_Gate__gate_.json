        "mainbody": "'''Baldur's Gate''' was the eponymous city gate that gave the [[Baldur's Gate|famed port city]] of the [[Sword Coast]] its name. It was one of the oldest Baldurian landmarks, located in the heart of the city, that separated the aristocratic [[Upper City]] from the working-class [[Lower City]]. In fact, by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it had become a symbol that embodied the class struggle between the city's rich and poorer citizens.",
        "Geography": "The gate was inset within the city's old wall. Heading south through the gate led to [[The Steeps]] in the Lower City, while the street north from the gate separated the [[Temples District]] from [[The Wide]].",
        "Description": "Despite its name, Baldur's Gate was the most ordinary of the city's numerous walled passageways.",
        "History": "Prior to the city's [[Tax Revolts]], Baldur's Gate was the only means to reach the city from [[Gray Harbor]]. The uproarious event was actually caused by city officials enacting taxation of goods that passed through this landmark.\n\nIronically, after the revolts were settled, the newly formed [[Council of Four]] put in place very similar tolls on the gate that benefited the city's government. These taxes continued for centuries and, as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, cost 5 [[cp]] to each individual."
