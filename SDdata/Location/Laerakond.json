Some believed Laerakond had replaced [[Maztica]] when that continent was sent to the world of Abeir. However, in fact Laerakond was located near [[Evermeet]], in the [[Great Sea]] to the south of the [[elven]] island.{{Cite web|url=http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=12023&whichpage=66|title=Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)|accessmonthday=September 4th|accessyear=2017|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|date=January 6th, 2008}}<ref group=\"note\">According to the official map of Laerakond in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' (page 201), the Great Sea is located to the south of Laerakond.",
        "Geography": {
            "[[Dusk Ports|The Dusk Ports]]": "The Dusk Ports were ostensibly a collection of free trade cities on the western shores of the Dragon Sea. In reality, they were vassal states to the [[green dragon]] [[Orlarrakh]]. Each port vied with each other for favored status with \"The Green Duchess\" but all followed her orders. The five Dusk Ports were:\n*[[Dusklan]]- A city of racial diversity that harbored escaped slaves, if only to use them as sacrifices to Orlarrakh.\n*[[Mreyelundar]]- A city of lawlessness and home of the strange [[Order of the Dawn]]. It was the most actively anti-draconic of the 5 cities.\n*[[Tarsith]]- A calm fishing community known for their exports of [[rock crab]]s and fine sailing equipment.\n*[[Lylorn]]- The dominant Dusk Port as of 1479 DR. Lylorn boasted the farthest reaching trade network and the most aggressive sailors.\n*[[Marrauk]]- A bleak and wind-scoured city in an equally desolate hillside. Marrauk featured a busy shipping trade and a fiercely defiant government.",
            "[[Gontal]]": "Gontal was a western land isolated from the rest of Laerakond. It was separated from the rest of the continent by its mountainous frontier and it was a land of mystery even to the Abeirans. The inhabitants of Gontal knew it as a place of intrigues.{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|50}}",
            "[[Melabrauth]]": "Melabrauth was the oldest dragon kingdom on Laerakond. It was ruled by [[Melauthaur]] the Undying One, a huge black dragon. The region was mostly unmapped, heavily monster-infested and completely unnavigable to non-dragons. During the Spellplague shift, the [[dragonborn]] slaves of Melauthuar rose up and escaped, leaving the kingdom dramatically weakened, but not destroyed. As of 1479 DR, dragonborn were prohibited from entering and humanoid slaves of all kinds were not allowed.",
            "[[Fimbrul]]": "Fimbrul was a vast mountain range locked permanently in winter's grip. It was the sleeping place of the last of the [[Dawn Titan]]s who slumbered since they were overthrown by their former dragon mounts. What little population called this region home were mostly [[earth giant]]s and near-feral [[orc]]s. All of these residents despised [[dragon]]s for one reason or another and expelled them from Fimbrul whenever possible. A handful of [[dwarf|dwarves]] made their home there, constantly warring against both the dragons and giants.",
            "[[Relmaur]]": "Relmaur lay on the southern edge of Fimbrul and acted as a buffer between the dragon empires of Melabrauth and Skelkor. Relmaur was primarily a dragonborn kingdom consisting of escaped slaves and their descendants. It was a highly defensive kingdom, with all cities lying underground. As of 1479 DR, they came into conflict with orcs from Fimbrul, but the dragonborn had the upper hand at that time.",
            "[[Skelkor]]": "Skelkor was ''the'' evil dragon empire of Laerakond. Larger than Melabrauth and more powerful, Skelkor was ruled by the Empress Dragon, [[Gauwervyndhal]]. Skelkor treated its slaves with special brutality, which led to a large rebellion when the Spellplague hit. In the wake of the planeshift, a large quantity of [[amber]]-like crystals appeared across Skelkor. The amber had the peculiar quality of weakening dragons almost to the point of death. This \"[[dragonbane amber]]\" fueled a rebellion that nearly wiped Skelkor off the map, but the substance quickly evaporated after use and within a few years, Gauwer returned and resumed control of the region.\n\nSome two hundred years before the Spellplague, a rebel group of dragonborn managed to seize a portion of Skelkor and hold it until the plague ripped their kingdom of [[Tymanchebar]] from Abeir and literally dropped it on [[Unther]] in Toril. The survivors founded the kingdom of [[Tymanther]]. Tymanchebar occupied a portion of what is now the Dragon Sea.",
            "[[Eskorn]]": "Eskorn was a densely forested land that was controlled by an upstart [[human]] kingdom that overthrew their draconic overlord, [[Eskornamundyr]], some several hundred years before the Spellplague threw the continent into Toril. It was considered a backwater realm pretending to be a kingdom. The current royal dynasty barely enforced the laws of the region, moving from one royal keep to the next and the law of the land moved with them. The capital of [[Stormhelm]] was a small city on the Dragon Sea rife with political intrigue and backstabbing.\n\nAnother point of interest was the Royal Keep of [[Nornglast]]: a mysterious, haunted castle. Nornglast was the “capital” of the undead empire, the [[Eminence of Araunt]], a bizarre organization of [[specter]]s and [[ghost]]s that claimed every crypt and mausoleum in the world as a principality. A network of [[undead]]-only portals called \"[[deathway]]s\" extended out from Nornglast, connecting its crypt to dozens of others across Toril.",
            "[[Sword Lands|The Sword Lands]]": "The Sword Lands were human-controlled lands south of Eskorn. They were largely lawless and without rulers save a series of warlords who constantly disrupted the relative peace of the countryside. For some reason, the Sword Lands were left alone by the dragons that dominate the rest of the continent. The reality of the situation was the [[dragonheir]]s, humans with the ability to control dragons by gaze or touch, probably still frightened the dragons, despite the fact that these near-mythical figures probably all died out.",
            "[[Tarmalune]] and the [[Windrise Ports]]": "Tarmalune was often referred to as '''Tarmalune Great Port'''. It was a sizable metropolis rivaling [[Waterdeep]] in size and splendor. The surrounding area was free of draconic control due to the lingering presence of the sleeping Dawn Titan [[Achazar]], who ruled the region centuries ago. His extended slumber prompted the people of Tarmalune to declare themselves free, although dragons still feared a centuries-planned ambush from the sleeping pillar of fire. The titan slumbered in the form of a 100 foot (30 m) column of fire that burned at all hours, regardless of weather.\n\nWhile the city was free from the dragons, it had a reputation for collaborating with them and returning escaped slaves, lest the dragons would have overcome their fear and turned on the bustling metropolis.\n \nThe Windrise Ports, of which Tarmalune was the largest and the most prosperous, were made up of five cities on the southeastern shores of the Dragon Sea. The other cities were:\n*[[Ramekho]]- A dilapidated city with little or no laws that was popular with adventurers.\n*[[Imdolphyn]]- A wealthy city that specialized in shipbuilding and textiles.\n*[[Harglast]]- A spartan trade port ruled by the dragonborn.\n*[[Sambral]]- A city of eloquent blademasters who prided themselves on their taste and style.",
            "Underdark": "{{Main|Abeiran Underdark}}\nLike [[Faerûn]], Laerakond also had its own [[Underdark]] region. However, this region was usually unknown even to the inhabitants of Laerakond.{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|52}}"
        },
        "History": "During the [[Dawn War]], [[Glaur]], a huge metallic fortress, was erected in the northern region of the land later known as [[Gontal]] by the Dawn Titan [[Nehushta]] to serve as a central front in that ancient conflict.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}} After the war, [[Ao]] sundered [[Abeir-Toril]] into the twin worlds, Abeir and Toril. Laerakond was sent to Abeir. \n\nNot long after, the [[War of Fang and Talon]] took place and the few Dawn Titans who survived retreated into hiding to the northern mountains of Laerakond and fell silent. \n\nIn the 13th century [[DR]], dragonborn and human rebels won the [[Dragonborn rebellion|rebellion]]. They managed to seize the nation of Eskorn and a province of the empire of [[Skelkor]].\n\nIn [[1385 DR]], the [[Blue Breath of Change]] took place and affected the world of Abeir. The blue flames first appeared in Gontal, where they made contact with the ancient fortress [[Glaur]]. Unable to withstand the chaotic forces, the fortress detonated in an explosion as potent as the [[Tearfall]]. This rocked the entire planet of Abeir and created the [[Glaur Barrens]] where the old fortress once stood.{{cite web |url=http://secretsofthearchmages.net/Threads/Wotc/2015/ForgottenRealms/1514971.htm|title=The one and only \"Ask the Realms authors/designers thread\" 4|accessmonthday=January 29th|accessyear=2017|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=August 12th, 2008}}\n\nLaerakond remained on Toril and in time became known as 'Returned Abeir' to the native inhabitants of that world.\n\nSmall quantities of dragonbane amber were uncovered after the Spellplague transported Laerakond to Toril. Although small, those quantities of dragonbane amber were enough to kill a lot of dragons. Dragonborn slaves across the lands were able to get enough dragonbane amber to start a rebellion during the [[Wailing Years]], killing many dragons and even destroying a few dragon empires. Among the most fierce rebellions were those of Skelkor and [[Djerad Kusold]] in Melabrauth. Eventually, however, the reserves of dragonbane amber were depleted and dragons were able to retaliate and destroy the rebels.\n\nIn 1479 DR, [[Tarmalune Trade House|merchants from Tarmalune]] and Lylorn had began to trade with the Faerûrian cities of [[Neverwinter]] and [[Luskan]], in hopes to establish permanent trade routes between the two continents.\n\nWhen the cataclysm known as the [[Second Sundering]] occurred during the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]], Returned Abeir was among the lands that were transported from Toril back to Abeir, being gone by [[1486 DR]] and still missing as of [[1491 DR]]. This caused shortages of products as [[silkroot]] back in Faerûn.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|14-15}}<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Death on the Wall|27}} However, many sailors who'd apparently set out from Tarmalune, their ships carrying cargo from Laerakond, thought that Laerakond was still on Toril, having been somehow \"Returned\" and left behind.<ref>{{Cite archive/Forgotten Realms Discord/2021-07-16/Humans on Abeir}}<ref group=\"note\">There is a contradiction over whether Laerakond continues to exist on Toril or on Abeir, with Adventurers League modules ''[[Breath of the Yellow Rose]]'' and ''[[Death on the Wall]]'' stating \"Akanul and the rest of Returned Abeir are no longer on Toril\" as a reason for a silkroot shortage, and Ed Greenwood [[Archive:Forgotten Realms Discord/Humans on Abeir|saying]] \"And Laerakond IS still on Toril; it was \"Returned\" and left behind. Or so a whole bunch of sailors who voyaged out of Tarmalune Great Port with full cargo holds believe...\" While a whole continent may be a hard thing to miss, there are numerous possible explanations to resolve this, such as the silkroot shortage leading to a mistaken belief in the lost continent, Laerakond later coming back to Toril, a part including Tarmulune staying behind, the sailors being tricked or mistaken about their destination, the sailors predating the Second Sundering, a portal between worlds, and so on."
