        "mainbody": "Fangjaws Hold, also called Fangjaws Hold, was an ogre stronghold in Thar.\nFangjaws Hold was located in central Thar within a small region of hills just east of the trail connecting Melvaunt to Glister.\nThe Hold was made up of a dozen ogre-sized dwellings made of piled earth and rocks that were surrounded by a wooden wall. It was named for its fearsome gate, which was covered with hundreds of bulette teeth making it look like a fearsome jaw.\nAs of the late 14 century DR, the Hold was home to the Skullsmashers ogre tribe lead by Zar-Umak. The tribe had numerous goblin slaves who served as foot soldiers and watched over a group of human and dwarven slave laborers.\nThe Hold still stood as of the late 15 century DR and the Skullsmashers still existed under the leadership of Guld, however it was unclear whether the tribe still inhabited the Hold."
