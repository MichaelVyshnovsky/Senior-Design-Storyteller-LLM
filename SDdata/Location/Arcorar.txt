'''Arcorar''', also known as the '''Great King Forest''', was a large forest region that at one time included the realms/domains of [[Rystall Wood]], [[Cormanthyr]], [[Elven Court]], [[Jhyrennstar]], [[Semberholme]] and [[Uvaeren]].

==Geography==
At its largest extent, Arcorar stretched from west of [[Cormyr]] to east of the [[Moonsea]].

==History==
The forest was originally populated after the [[Crown Wars]] when the elves were spreading out looking for new unspoiled regions to settle. Over time, this forest broke up into smaller and smaller pieces until the name was no longer relevant, with the largest remaining fragment being [[Cormanthor]].
