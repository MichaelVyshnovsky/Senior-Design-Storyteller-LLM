        "mainbody": "'''Kabe''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].",
        "Description": "Kabe was perched atop a steep bluff overlooking the white sands of [[Bay of Koba|Kobawan]]. The village, comprising ninety-three buildings, was strategically positioned where a small stream flowed into the bay. Fishing boats, the heart of the village's livelihood, were hauled onto the beach and secured to posts in the sand. Accessibility to the beach was a feat in itself, being achieved either through a winding trail or a staircase, the latter constructed at a considerable expense to the villagers.",
        "Trade": "The villagers of Kabe faced significant hardship. Their obligation to support not only [[Niwa Sutai]] and his [[samurai]] but also the seamen and [[bushi]] under his command placed a heavy burden on their resources. Consequently, unlike other fishing villages, the people of Kabe lived in a constant state of near-poverty, struggling to meet these demands while trying to sustain their own livelihoods. This precarious economic situation set them apart from other communities.",
        "Government": "One of the village's key roles was the managerial headquarters for the [[Niwa clan|Niwa]] estate. As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the village's [[jito]] was Niwa Sutai.",
        "Defenses": "Niwa Sutai commanded a modest force of four samurai and ten bushi. His lineage and position in the Niwa family afforded him control over two warships, highlighting the village's strategic naval importance at the mouth of Kobawan. Each warship was staffed with ten sailors and fifteen bushi, who served as marines, and was led by a samurai captain. Typically, one ship patrolled to safeguard against pirates, while the other remained docked. The high military presence discouraged bandits."
