'''Hupiik''' was a village in the [[Angalpuk]] region within the [[Great Glacier]] and was the largest [[Angulutiun]] settlement.

==Geography==
Hupiik was located {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} west of the [[Angsaas Chain]]. To the north of the settlement, it was surrounded by a thick forest of [[birch]] and [[willow]] and to the south, a stream of clear, fresh water.

==Inhabitants==
The residents of Hupiik secretive, serious and a little arrogant. While Hupiik had nominal relations with other Angulutiun villages, they rarely associated with the residents of other villages outside of [[Ulutiun dictionary#S|''sukkiruchit'']].

They were considered the best [[caribou]] herdsman on the Great Glacier, and hosted the largest caribou herd in Angalpuk. During an [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''ikili'']], the three thousand large heard was driven between the settlement and [[Isenghak]].

The animal-handling techniques developed by the herdsmen were so effective they have been copied by other villages in Angalpuk. The herdsman divided the main herd into [[Ulutiun dictionary#J|''jiji'']], each containing between 100-200 animals and was led by a [[Ulutiun dictionary#U|''ujiji'']]. The ''ujiji'' rode behind their ''jiji'' upon a [[Ulutiun dictionary#U|''uhkerek'']] and had six [[Ulutiun dictionary#K|''kaujiji'']] to assist them, who rode upon [[Ulutiun dictionary#J|''jakerek'']] on each side of the ''jiji''. The whole herd was led by a [[Ulutiun dictionary#P|''pimataung'']]. 

The herdsmen used [[lasso]]s to prevent a caribou from wandering off. Trained [[okteff]] assisted in keeping the herd together and chased down any caribou who wandered off, herding the animal back to the herd. The herdsman tie [[feedbag]]s around the caribous' neck to provide supplemental nutrition. Each caribou of the herd was branded with the Hupiik [[Ulutiun dictionary#W|''wakiak'']] in the inside of the ear, a symbol of three parallel notches.
