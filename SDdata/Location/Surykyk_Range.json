        "mainbody": "The '''Surykyk Range''' was a frozen chain of mountains in southern [[Alpuk]] in the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "The slopes of the Surykyk Range were icy and barren, and the wind and snow quickly covered any tracks. Some of the peaks concealed networks of tunnels and caverns beneath them, which connected to the surface via deep fissures and crevasses. These could be up to hundreds of feet (dozens of meters) deep and up to 60 feet (18 meters) wide, and could became treacherously concealed by the snow.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The Surykyk Range held popular nesting grounds for [[kupuk]], especially in the south. The mountains' tunnels, caverns, and valleys provided excellent shelter to build their nests and raise their pups, as well as multiple routes to flee or hide from predators, such as the [[tirichik]]s that also haunted the caverns and crevasses."
