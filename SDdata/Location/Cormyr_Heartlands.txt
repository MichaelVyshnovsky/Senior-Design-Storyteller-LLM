The '''Heartlands of Cormyr''' was an informal region of the Forest Kingdom that was made up of the lands around the [[King's Forest]], which included the oldest and most important cities of the realm.

==Description==
The popular imagination of [[Cormyr]] was largely based on the King's Forest and the surrounding lands. This protected woodland was a site of great natural beauty, home to beasts and [[fey]], as well as many villages and lost ruins of the realm. The forest was bordered by the farmlands that supported much of the realm's population, the country estates of the nobility, and the major highways that held Cormyr together.

==Geography==
The heartlands were roughly bounded by the [[Storm Horns]] and [[West Reaches of Cormyr|west reaches of Cormyr]], the [[Wyvernwater]] and [[Coast of Cormyr|coastal region]] to the east, and the [[Dragonmere]] to the south. The north was met by the [[Stonecliffs]] and broad [[East Reaches of Cormyr|east reaches]], marking the start of the [[Stonelands]]. The heartlands were bisected by the [[Starwater River]], which passed south from the northern Storm Horns through to the Dragonmere.{{Cite interactive atlas|Kings Forest}}

===Bodies of Water===
* The [[River Sharragh]] rose in the eastern forest and flowed for a few miles, before disappearing into [[Plungepool]] and the [[Underdark]], collecting at [[Lake Thalmiir]] and [[Daerbraun]] near the [[drow]] city of [[Sschindylryn]].
* The [[Starwater River]] emerged in the northern Storm Horns and passed through the King's Forest, was joined by the smaller [[Tearflow]] stream, and eventually emptied into the [[Dragonmere]]. A famous and fairly navigable river, it served as a primary route for travelers and goods to pass between the coast and interior of the realm.
* The [[Sword River]] flowed from [[Arabel Springs]], eventually emptying into the Wyvernwater.
