        "mainbody": "The nation of Sossal () was located in the Cold Lands of northeast Faerûn.\nThis chilly place was locked between Pelvuria and Yal Tengri.\nFrom its founding in 331 DR to 1319 DR the nation of Sossal was ruled under a system of monarchy. Following the death of its then-leader at that latter date, the nation was ruled by a druid conclave known as the Circle of the Frozen Sun.\nDue to how remote it was, the land of Sossal had very little contact with the rest of Faerûn outside of trade. Sossals only known trade city was Naupau, a port on the shores of the Yal Tengri. The sailors of Sossal were rumored to know of a secret passage through the ice pack northwest from the Yal Tengri to the Trackless Sea, and tales were told of strange ships matching their description sailing as far south as Calimshan.\nCirca -2320 DR, a clan of Rashemi migrated north and settled in the alpine valleys of the Armridge Mountains. Over time, their descendants would come to be known as the Sossrim.\nIn the , the Sossrim living around the Great Glacier were united by Ylaethar \"The Bear\", who proclaimed himself to be Ornath (king). He went on lead the Sossrim south from their ancestral lands and founded the nation of Sossal. \nAt the height of the Raumathar Empires power, they briefly ruled over land of Sossal.\nIn the , the land of Sossal was rocked by a series of earthquakes. These tremors opened fissures in the nearby Great Glacier and several powerful demons that had been trapped below since the fall of Narfell were unleashed. Under the guidance of then-ruler Londraeth, the kingdom managed to vanquish the rampaging horde.\nIn the , the monarchy of Sossal collapsed when then-leader Thelessar was murdered by his twin sons Norlith and Baldraeth. Both were banished from Sossal for this transgression by the nations spiritual leader, the Great Druid Ulthorkh. He and his druid conclave, the Circle of the Frozen Sun, would soon after take over the role of governing the nation.\nIn the , Dabron Sashenstar of Baldurs Gate embarked on a voyage to Sossal. He would later return with a hauberk from the land, which would go on display within the Hall of Exploration in the House of the Moon.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Sossal remained an isolated nation, both in terms of location and diplomacy.\nNaupau a port trade city along the Great Ice Sea.\nMount Sundabar a mountain upon which the great Aerie of the Snow Eagles had been built in replacement of the mountaintop, that was sheared off during the Dareth Hoarfaern war.\nHeroes Height a lonesome mountain where the last remnants of Dareth and Hoarfaern both perished in climactic battle."
