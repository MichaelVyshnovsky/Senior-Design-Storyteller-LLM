        "mainbody": "'''Holloway''' was a [[Netherese]] town and archaeological site within [[the Hollow]] during the time of ancient [[Netheril]].",
        "Geography": "The town was located inside the Hollow on the edge of Netheril, next to the [[Bodensee River]].",
        "History": "Holloway was established in {{yearlinkConvert|2714|NY}} when Netherese [[archwizard]]s took note of the ancient ruins on the surface and within the cave systems around the valley. They decided to examine the ancient human habitations of the Hollow, which they believed to be the earliest humans on [[Toril]], and hoped to find powerful artifacts on par with the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]''. As a result, Holloway was quickly built and fortified, and [[adventurer]]s were hired to explore the deeper cave systems within the Hollow. Disappointingly for them, no powerful relics were ever recovered, only prehistoric drawings, [[pottery]], and stone spearheads from their ancestors.\n\nThe lack of materially significant results caused the archwizard benefactors to lose interest over time, and in {{yearlinkConvert|3222|NY}} they withdrew their financial support. Most of their hired explorers and adventurers left as the money dried up, but a small population remained. Though impoverished, the town was sheltered from the unnatural storms and destructive battles between the Netherese, [[phaerimm]], and [[sharn]] forces, and it was only threatened by occasional monsters from the depths that were disturbed by ongoing underground expeditions. Holloway was ultimately abandoned in {{yearlinkConvert|3589|NY}}, well after [[Karsus's Folly]], and the inhabitants joined with other Netherese populations to the south such as [[Indoria]]."
