==Geography==
Hitan Island sat approximately {{SI|30|mi|k|long=yes}} offshore due west of the mainland of the northern section of the [[Cities of the Pantheon]] region. The elongated island measured roughly {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|15|mi|k|long=yes}} wide. Much of the shore was rocky. There were no settlements on Hitan Island as of [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}}. Four smaller unamed islands lay off of Hitan Island's northeast corner.
