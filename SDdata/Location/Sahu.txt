}}'''Sahu''' was a large island in the [[Crowded Sea]] to the southwest of [[Afyal]].<ref>

==Geography==
Like in other places in the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] area of [[Zakhara]], ancient ruins dotted the jungles and mountains, which were left here by two fallen empires: the worshipers of [[Thasmudyan]] of old and, following it, the [[New Dynasty of the Necromancer Kings]]. Many dark secrets and dangers to would-be adventurers hid in land and buildings.

==History==
Sahu was also called the "'''Isle of Serenity'''", a name usually attributed to the calm lifestyle of its residents in [[1367 DR|the 1360s]].{{AQ-time}} The byword also had a much more ancient and sinister connotation, however: "Sahu" itself was a word in the dead language of [[Kadari]] and can be loosely translated as "Serene Eternity", meaning nothing else but "death".

==Notable locations==
Two places of modern habitation, the villages of [[Misbahd]] and [[Jinutt]], were located on the island's northern shore. The inner part of the island consisted of a wooded plateau with a mountain range called the [[Vishap's Spine]] along the center.

Along the shoreline of this island were ruined structures similar to the famed metal towers of [[Rog'osto]]. But unlike the intact spires of that city, these were toppled and twisted heaps that littered the island's low shores in random clusters.
