'''Palischuk''', sometimes spelled '''Palishchuk'''<ref group="note">In [[R.A. Salvatore]]'s works, ''[[Promise of the Witch-King]]'', ''[[Road of the Patriarch]]'', and ''[[The Bloodstone Lands (sourcebook)|The Bloodstone Lands]]'', the name of the settlement is spelled as Palis'''h'''chuk, contrary to how it is spelled in all other sources, even in maps in ''The Bloodstone Lands''., was a city in the northeastern corner of [[Vaasa]]. It was populated predominantly by [[half-orc]]s.

==Description==
The city was a fortress town rebuilt in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by half-orcs{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} It was made of up mostly shorter buildings and was well-lit at night by torchlight. It was ringed by a wall with main gates facing north and south.

==Geography==
The city sat on a wide, rocky plain east of the ruins of [[Castle Perilous]].

The largest major community in eastern Vaasa, the city lay upon the northern trade routes that connected [[Maur-Eturo]] and the south with [[Ironspur]], [[Ishe]], and [[Frohm's Rest]] in the far north and [[The Reach]] trail to the west.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Trade==
Palischuck made a great effort upon its refounding in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR to build trade relations with the civilized peoples of Vaasa and [[Damara]], and largely succeeded. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, it was the most important trade hub in Vaasa.

==History==
A few years prior to the rise of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, the city was attacked by the [[black dragon]] [[Urshula]], but the town survived with relatively minor scars. 

Palischuk was ruined by the depredations of the Witch-King during the [[Vaasan War]], but was subsequently claimed and rebuilt by the half-orcs of the surrounding areas as a place to call their own.

By the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, after Zhengyi had been defeated, Palischuk's half-orc inhabitants succeeded in befriending other nearby settlements. They traded with the  [[Vaasan Gate]], [[Darmshall]], and neighboring [[dwarves|dwarven]] communities harmoniously, but the dwarves and [[human]]s would continue to deal with them cautiously for the next decade.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Palischuk became the epicenter of a territorial dispute between King Gareth Dragonsbane of [[Damara]], who openly desired to claim Vaasa as his own, and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] when [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] and [[Artemis Entreri]] claimed Vaasa as the Kingdom of D'aerthe. The Palischukians sided with King Gareth, opening the door for him to ultimately annex Vaasa. Palischuk was absorbed into his [[Kingdom of Bloodstone]] sometime in the late 14{{th}} century DR.

The city was subsequently conquered by the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] sometime in the 1460s DR.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78,80}} As of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Palischuk had grown to a city of over 10,000, the great majority of whom were still half-orcs. Their mercantile businesses served as the economic engine that underlay much of Vaasa's economy, and they had become much more accepted as a vital part of Vaasan society. At this time, the city was ruled by Knight-Vindicator [[Mansard Kanaoth]], the only half-orc on the Ironfell Council of the Warlock Knights.

==Inhabitants==
Most folk in Palischuck kept to themselves. The majority of its residents were half-orc or [[orc]]. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, just 1 in 5 of the local population was human.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} It was not uncommon for residents to insert [[Orc language|Orcish]] words into their sentences when speaking in [[Common]] or [[Damaran language|Damaran]].

As of [[1479 DR]], several half-orcs of Palischuk were practicing [[Zhengyian blood magic]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}
