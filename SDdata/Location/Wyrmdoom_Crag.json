        "mainbody": "Wyrmdoom Crag was a goliath settlement nestled within the Spine of the World mountains in the North. It was home to the warm and outgoing Thuunlakalaga clan.\nThe caverns of Wyrmdoom Crag were carved within a tall mountain, with a cave mouth that faced the north.\nWyrmdoom Crag featured a central sleeping chamber, encircled by a number of caves that served other functions. The settlements leader, Chief Ogolai, and a few other venerated warriors had private chambers that branched off to the east.\n\"The Crawl\" was a chamber that featured a small tunnel with walls that were inscribed with a number of runes, an important site for goliaths that were about to come of age.\nIn the innermost chamber of Wyrmdoom Crag was a wide and open feasting hall.\nIt was located among the western slopes of the Spine mountains, some ways southwest of the Reghed Glacier.\nAs with other goliath settlements, Wyrmdoom Crag was led by a single chieftain.\nThe Thuunlakalaga goliaths were very welcoming to outsiders, save for the goliaths of the Akannathi clan.\nShortly after the settlements founding, a white dragon called Stygiarus assaulted the goliaths at their home. Unfortunately for the dragon, it greatly underestimated the clans strength and was defeated and slain.\nWord about Stygiaruss death and remains spread as far away as the Ten Towns. The scholar Dannika Graysteel sought out these dragon bones for the formulation of a potent stew with magical properties.\nIn addition to the goliaths, a small number of chwingas dwelled in and around the caves of the crag.\n* Aruk Thundercaller, the clans healer.\n* Kapanuk, a young hunter who was lost by his people.\n* Sikki-kree, an aarakocra who was sheltered by the goliaths after being caught in a blizzard."
