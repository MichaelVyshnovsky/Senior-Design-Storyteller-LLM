The '''Lustrum''' was a [[mithral]] mine outside of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Geography==
The Lustrum was located 20 miles from the [[Pillars of Woe]].

==Description==
The Lustrum was a rich mithral mine. It was a wedge-shaped vault hundreds of feet high, with a narrow and cramped floor.

==History==
The rich ore lodes and gem caches of the Lustrum were discovered by the [[drow]] circa [[1360 DR]]. It was mined by slaves and soldiers of [[House Xorlarrin]], who hired [[Bregan D'aerthe]] to help protect the mines. They believed that should [[Mithral Hall]] learn of the mine, their lust would cause another war with Menzoberranzan.

The highest-ranking members of House Xorlarrin were aware that three [[golem|gemstone golems]] -- [[Mulhorandi]] constructs -- were found intact in a [[silver]] vein in the Lustrum, though how they got there was a mystery. 

The mine was abandoned (at least temporarily) in [[1372 DR]] during the [[duergar]] invasion of Menzoberranzan. At this time, [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] staged negotiations here with [[Horgar Steelshadow]] of [[Gracklstugh]] and [[Kaanyr Vhok]] to determine how much of the war's spoils would go to each party.
