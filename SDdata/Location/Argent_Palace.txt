The Argent Palace was Grazzts personal home in the city of Zelatar.
The palace was composed of sixty-six ivory towers and scores and scores of mirrored hallways. The cold but meticulous hallways were filled with wandering bodaks and other more malevolent abyssal denizens as part of the demon lords amusements. Woe to those residents of Zelatar who received an invitation to an audience with Grazzt in his palace!
From his palace, Grazzt planned and schemed his intricate plots to gain more power while thwarting his enemies.
