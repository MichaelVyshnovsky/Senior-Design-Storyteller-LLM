'''Werapan''' was a crystal-domed underwater [[Netherese]] city that existed in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], until it was destroyed by the forces of [[Serôs]] in {{Yearlink|-1660}}.

==History==
The enclave was established ''circa'' {{YearlinkName|-1720}} just off the coast of what later would be the nation of [[Sembia]], overlooking the [[Plains of Duna]]. Named after its founding [[archmage]], it joined the other colonies of [[Cuulmath]] and [[Quaeluuvis]], together making up [[Deep Netheril]]. The enclaves proceeded to enslave the people of Serôs, with the [[locathah]] being the primary victims, and were violently opposed by the [[sea elves]] of [[Aryselmalyr]] and other sentient species of the Inner Sea.

All three enclaves were destroyed in the [[Battle of the Three Seaflames]] in the {{YearlinkName|-1660}} when the allied High Mages of Serôs and [[Dukar]]s of Aryselmalyr, led by Coronal [[Essyl Merynth]], attacked the Netherese oppressors. The battle to remove the crystal domes raged until it was abruptly ended by the High Mages' [[spell]] that turned the crystal domes into a substance flammable in water. The resultant explosion was directed away from the forces of Serôs, annihilating the Netherese forces and carving out [[Saerloon Bay]].
