Werapan was a crystal-domed underwater Netherese city that existed in the Sea of Fallen Stars, until it was destroyed by the forces of Ser么s in .
The enclave was established circa  just off the coast of what later would be the nation of Sembia, overlooking the Plains of Duna. Named after its founding archmage, it joined the other colonies of Cuulmath and Quaeluuvis, together making up Deep Netheril. The enclaves proceeded to enslave the people of Ser么s, with the locathah being the primary victims, and were violently opposed by the sea elves of Aryselmalyr and other sentient species of the Inner Sea.
All three enclaves were destroyed in the Battle of the Three Seaflames in the  when the allied High Mages of Ser么s and Dukars of Aryselmalyr, led by Coronal Essyl Merynth, attacked the Netherese oppressors. The battle to remove the crystal domes raged until it was abruptly ended by the High Mages spell that turned the crystal domes into a substance flammable in water. The resultant explosion was directed away from the forces of Ser么s, annihilating the Netherese forces and carving out Saerloon Bay.
