        "Description": "Sumbrar was the headquarters for the military and navy of Evermeet. The island was home to mighty magical fortresses, interconnected with each other.",
        "Geography": "Sumbrar was a rocky island {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}} to the east of Evermeet. A complicated network of tunnels permeated the island. Large sea caves were found on the coasts of the island.",
        "Defenses": "Sumbrar was a fortress and home base to the fleet of Evermeet. Within the tunnels of the islands were barracks that housed up to a thousand warriors. Also based on the island were the aerial forces of Evermeet. The elven aerial troops were housed there along with their [[giant eagle]] and [[pegasus]] mounts. The navy harbored their ships within massive sea caves.\n\nThe island was also home a small flotilla of six [[spelljammer]]s. These spelljammers, called [[Ruathimaer]], were used to defend Evermeet from attacks from Realmspace.",
        "History": "The island was devastated during the [[Spellplague]], when Evermeet was dragged into the [[Feywild]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Found deep under the island were twelve ancient [[dragon]]s: five [[bronze dragon]]s, four [[silver dragon]]s and three [[gold dragon]]s. They, and the warriors who flew them, were in a dreamless sleep, defended from external threats and hidden from observation with powerful magic. Since they could only be awakened once, they were only summoned if the need was dire."
