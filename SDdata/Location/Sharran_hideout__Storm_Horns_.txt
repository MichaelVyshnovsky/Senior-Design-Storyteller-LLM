A secret Sharran hideout was hidden in the foothills of the Cormyrean Storm Horns, home to many Sharrans and the infamous Dedryk Black.

The caves and surrounding hills were home to wild wolves and mountain lions. To support their defenses, Dedryk Blacks followers summoned air and ice mephits to fight alongside them, and kept caged wolves as guard dogs. The Sharrans also kept a large owlbear penned up in the hopes of using it as a weapon, though it proved to have no loyalty for them, only hunger.
