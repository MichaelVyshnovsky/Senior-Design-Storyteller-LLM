        "mainbody": "Nairns Tomb was the middle of the three islands located south of Thelve and southwest from the the fortress library of Candlekeep.\nNairns Tomb was a rocky outcropping that sore above the Sea of Swords – fissured granite with temperate woods growing among the cracks. It was a steep-sided, rocky, and heavily-forested island. Nairns Tomb was  long east to west and a bit over  from north to south.\nThe rock underneath the island was honeycombed with underground chambers and tunnels tall enough to accommodate a dwarf. Many of these tunnels dropped down all the way into the Underdark. The island has one sheltered anchorage at the center of its eastern shore, but Nairns Tomb completely lacked beaches or harbors.\nNairns Tombs northern shores were awash by Skoonds Run that separated the large island of Thelve from three of its southern sisters. Arthoum was the smallest and westernmost of the three, Nairns Tomb was the middle isle, and Askalet was the easternmost and lowest to the Sword Coast shores. Arthoum was just a  away from Nairns Tomb, while Askalet was  away from Nairns Tomb.\nUnlike other islands among the seven, Nairns Tomb was completely devoid of seabirds who avoided the island for some unknown reason.\nNairns Tombs namesake was a long-dead adventurer entombed in an abandoned dwarf-delve that could be accessed through the islands highest point. By the 14 century DR, the tomb itself had been emptied of all its valuables and was rumored to be haunted by phantoms or other much more dangerous things. Over the years, the islands tunnels were used by pirates and smugglers and prowled by underground monsters. Miirym, the guardian dragon of Candlekeep, was known to travel from the fortress to Nairns Tomb through underground passages."
