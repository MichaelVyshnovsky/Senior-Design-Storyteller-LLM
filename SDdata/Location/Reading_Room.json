        "Activities": "Although every devout follower of Deneir made at least one pilgrimage to the Master's Library, most only got as far as the Reading Room, which supported the Library.\n\nA secret nonliving matter–only ''[[gate]]'' spell allowed notes and texts to be passed between the two, so that copies of texts could be lent to visitors.",
        "Organization": "The Reading Room was governed by a [[Keeper]]; a kind old woman in the late 1360s DR. She sent messages through the ''gate'', and was aided and protected by loyal [[watchghost]]s.",
