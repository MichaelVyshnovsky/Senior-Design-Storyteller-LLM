It was located far to the south of the main temple of the Masters Library on Iron Dragon Mountain.\nAlthough every devout follower of Deneir made at least one pilgrimage to the Masters Library, most only got as far as the Reading Room, which supported the Library.\nA secret nonliving matter–only gate spell allowed notes and texts to be passed between the two, so that copies of texts could be lent to visitors.\nThe Reading Room was governed by a Keeper a kind old woman in the late 1360s DR. She sent messages through the gate, and was aided and protected by loyal watchghosts.\nCategoryTemples\nCategoryTemples to Deneir\nCategoryDeneirrath locations\nCategoryLocations in the Earthfast Mountains\nCategoryLocations in Impiltur\nCategoryLocations in the Vast\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\n6720mpnyff4dektz3n8uoxgpywo7gv7"
