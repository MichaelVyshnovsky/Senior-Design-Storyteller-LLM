        "mainbody": "easerpent Tamed by Umberlee was a statue in the Gray Harbor of Baldurs Gate.\nThe statue was located in the Lower City, very close to the Water Queens House.\nIn 1482 DR, the hand of this statue, as well as others, was stolen by agents of the Guild. All but those of the Outer City were enraged, and the Flaming Fist conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up, even when searching the Calim Jewel Emporium. Later, the Beloved Ranger was vandalised by bored noble youths. Horgold Hadru took in the young nobles, as he owed the youths family a favor."
