For years, these raiders attacked merchants between [[Silverymoon]] and [[Sundabar]] and growing fabulously rich. Their their ill-gotten gains were hoarded in a great keep and in these tombs, After their nation was wiped out by [[orc]]s, only the Tombs remained unplundered.\n\nAt some point prior to the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[great wight]] [[Vinjarek|Vinjarek the Mound King]] arose in the Tombs. He had apparently not been interred there originally, and so claimed rulership over them along with the treasures of the Chieftains. His rule continued into the late 15{{th}} century DR, by which time he had become [[plaguechanged]] and was a menace to nearby [[Luruar]].\n\nWhen one of the seven barrows was raided by [[adventurer]]s from [[Silverymoon]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, every member of their party was slain on their journey home. Each body was discovered with its loot and equipment missing, its limbs dismembered, and with the words \"Disturb not the Mound King\" carved into the flesh.",
