'''Furthinghome''' was a trading port city in [[Aglarond]] and one of the oldest cities in the nation.

==Description==
Around [[1368 DR]], it was made up of some buildings in the traditional Aglarondan weathered wood style and others made from stone. It also contained a large slum where the buildings were simple huts. At the city's center was a circular road and a public park called [[Old Furthing]], which acted as a social and financial center.

==Trade==
The port in Furthinghome was small and shallow, which limited the size of vessels that could dock. In 1368 DR, merchants imported [[spices]], textiles, tools, and weapons, and exported [[fish]] and a small amount of timber from the [[Yuirwood]], limited in quantity by its [[half-elf]] occupants.

The city was also known for its horticulture around the same time, particularly for the dahlias, [[rose]]s, and orchids grown in the glass greenhouses of the wealthier citizens, but also for [[herbs]] too.

==Government==
The city was ruled in [[1374 DR]] by Lord [[Fardyl Albin]], a member of the [[Royal Council of Aglarond]]. He preferred to stay away from the council where possible and concentrate his efforts on the wealthier merchants of Furthinghome.

==Peacocks==
A flock of [[peacock]]s were brought to the city from [[Mulhorand]] by Lord [[Ceraut]], several decades prior to 1368 DR. After the death of Ceraut, his large estate became abandoned and the peacocks gradually spread to roam freely throughout the countryside surrounding the city.

==Furthingharrow==
The slum district of the city, on the hills of its east side, was known as Furthingharrow. It was a shanty town populated by those settlers who were driven out of the [[Yuirwood]]. Most citizens here worked at the docks or as laborers or drivers. The lack of prosperity here was blamed upon a perception that only [[elf|elves]] and [[half-elf|half-elves]] could do well. The slums were inclined towards the [[Sons of Hoar]].
