        "Description": "The land was full of secretive cities, unwelcoming to travelers, huge deserts, lush oases and powerful [[genie]]s who meddled in the affairs of humans frequently. \n\nZakhara was a land of many types of exotic magic and powerful warriors.<ref><ref> Faerûnian tales told of [[demon]]-infested cities and [[god]]less [[sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]], like the genie-binding [[sha'ir]]s<ref> wielding strange magic.",
        "Geography": "{{Quote|To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.|Faerûnian saying}}\nThe land was located south and east of Faerûn, beyond the region of the [[Utter East]], with the closest Faerûnian lands to Zakhara being [[Dambrath]] and [[Var the Golden]] (by sea) and [[Ulgarth]] or arguably [[Konigheim]] (by land).<ref> Zakhara was mostly isolated from the rest of the world, as the peninsula was separated from the main mass by the treacherous [[World Pillar Mountains]].<ref> \n\nThe [[Zakharan seas|seas around Zakhara]] were plagued with [[pirate]]s and [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]] who charged traders tolls to cross their seas, such traders willingly paid these exorbitant fees as Zakhara's exotic trading goods tended to be well worth the price back in Faerûn. Occasionally the pirates decided to completely cut off Zakhara from Faerûn.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Land of Fate was home to a diversity of non-human inhabitants, but the majority comprised [[human]] [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] with brown skin, dark hair, and relatively small height. They usually all spoke the common language of [[Midani]] and shared in the common culture of [[Zakharan pantheon|Enlightenment]]; racial values were much less prominent than elsewhere. Zakharans were firmly convinced they were more civilized than the rest of the world and treated these \"barbarians\" accordingly.<ref><ref>\n\nOnly a few Zakharans ventured outside their homeland, usually as traders, and could typically be found only in the very south of Faerûn.<ref> At least two human groups were the exception to this rule: the peoples of the [[Bedine]]<ref> and [[Calishite]]s came from the Land of Fate to Faerûn in the ancient past with the help of ''[[portal]]s''.<ref>"
