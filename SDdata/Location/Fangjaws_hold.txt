'''Fangjaws Hold''', also called '''Fangjaw's Hold''',{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} was an [[ogre]] stronghold in [[Thar]].{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Print.aspx?x=dnd/drrl/20071217a|title=The Tribes of Thar|accessdate=2007-12-21|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=2007-12-17|work=Realmslore|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]}}

==Geography==
Fangjaws Hold was located in central Thar within a small region of hills just east of the trail connecting [[Melvaunt]] to [[Glister]].

==Description==
The Hold was made up of a dozen ogre-sized dwellings made of piled earth and rocks that were surrounded by a wooden wall. It was named for its fearsome gate, which was covered with hundreds of [[bulette]] teeth making it look like a fearsome jaw.

== Inhabitants==
As of the late 14{{Th}} century [[DR]], the Hold was home to the [[Skullsmashers]] ogre tribe lead by [[Zar-Umak]]. The tribe had numerous [[goblin]] slaves who served as foot soldiers and watched over a group of [[human]] and [[dwarf|dwarven]] slave laborers.

The Hold still stood as of the late 15{{th}} century DR and the Skullsmashers still existed under the leadership of [[Guld]], however it was unclear whether the tribe still inhabited the Hold.
