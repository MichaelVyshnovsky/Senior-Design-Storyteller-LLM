The [[Nunwood]] was a forest on the mouth of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

The nearby cities of [[Reth]] and [[Hlath]] used the Nunwood  as their main source of lumber.<ref> In [[1372 DR]], Hlath's main export was Nunwood lumber.<ref>

==History==
For a while around [[1370 DR]], Reth stopped cutting down trees from the Nunwood because of a conflict with the [[Emerald Enclave]]. When the lumberjacks eventually returned to the Nunwood, they were confronted by creatures using hit-and-run tactics during the night.<ref>

==Inhabitants==
Snakes that spat a blinding venom were common in the Nunwood.<ref> As of [[1357 DR]] a tribe of [[hybsil]]s called the [[Autunuk]] were also known to live in the Nunwood.
