'''Thorngap''' was a [[druidic circle]] in the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]]. It was taken over by the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] and used as his lair in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
Thorngap was made up of several interconnected groves, caverns, glades, and other natural features in the King's Forest. It included the dens of [[Thorn Hollow]], where druids and beasts lived together, and the hidden sanctum of the [[Druid's Deep]]. Some caves reached down to the [[Underdark]], while others were filled with water and served as secretive passageways.

Thorngap served as a home for druids and rangers in the King's Forest for centuries. During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the druid [[Halsaime]] was driven mad by his [[Halsaime's staff|cursed staff]] and used its power to forcibly control nature and his fellow foresters, intending to build an army with which to attack the world at large.

After the ranger [[Peron Uthe]] caused an outbreak of [[red musk zombie]]s in [[Eveningstar]], the [[Harpers]] [[Kirinel Zay]], [[Tarim Inavule]], and [[Jussko Kwahn]] arrived to investigate. With the assistance of the tracker [[Garstrom Toom]], their agents found Thorngap and looked for Halsaime at his home at Thorn Hollow, but only found frenzied druids and animals. After fighting through the defenders, the adventurers found the dying druid [[Carm Woodrusk]], who had resisted Halsaime's power and been lethally wounded. With her last breath she revealed that Halsaime was hidden at the nearby [[Druid's Deep]] refuge, sending the Harpers on a final strike at him. While Jussko Kwahn scouted ahead and was temporarily [[petrified]] by Halsaime, the adventurers overcame his last defenders and slew him. The recovered Jussko then destroyed the cursed staff, ending the dire influence over Thorngap.

==Inhabitants==
The respected druid Halsaime made his home there, along with a number of other druids, rangers, and [[dryad]]s, who lived alongside [[wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[dire bear]]s, and other animals. During his period of madness, Thorngap was filled with malevolent [[Will-o'-wisp|wisps]], [[earth elemental]]s, [[red musk zombies]], [[wood woad]]s, and [[vine horror]]s. The animals were driven into a frenzy, and many of the resident folk were forcibly recruited to Halsaime's cause. During this time the [[bog hag]] [[Aghilde]] moved into a dank corner of the refuge and made herself at home.
