'''Angelhead Mine''' was a mine found in the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was likely named for the enormous statue of an [[angel]]ic being found within its depths.<ref group="note">The source of the name is unknown; it's assumed to be one of the statues, such as that shown on this page.

==Geography==
[[File:Angelhead Mine.png|thumb|right|350px|''The interior of Angelhead Mine.'']]
The mine lay beneath the hills just inland from [[Raven Cliff Beach]], a short distance away from [[Cragmire Keep]] and [[Cragmire Barrow]] and just off the [[High Road]] north of [[Neverwinter]].

==Description==
The mine had several entrances standing amongst the hills.<ref group="note">While several mine entrances appear in the Blackdagger Ruins zone in ''Neverwinter'', only one of them is accessible as Angelhead Mine. It's assumed these are all part of the same mine. These were supported with high arches built into sturdy stone walls, with wooden pillars and a shelter out the front. Each arch was secured with a portcullis to bar entry.

[[File:NW Angelhead Mine runestone.jpg|thumb|right|''The runestone outside Angelhead Mine.'']]
Found lying amongst the rocks outside the main mine entrance was a [[runestone]] inscribed with runes of an unknown script and language. A translation read "with a heavy pick slung over his shoulder the bearded miner heads deep into the earth in search of precious metals and gemstones the quintessential dwarf".The runes are actually written in [[Wikipedia:Elder Futhark|Elder Futhark]], the oldest form of Norse and Germanic runes, which are presumed not to exist in the Realms.

Inside, the mines were a series of chambers hewn from the stone, with low ceilings and winding passages. Wooden supports lined the walls and ceilings, and wall-mounted [[torch]]es and [[lantern]]s hanging from [[chain]]s provided lighting. Scattered around was mining equipment, chains, [[barrel]]s, and chests.

All around the mine, massive statues were being dug out of the rock, often found in odd orientations or with only a single body part visible. A head, a hand, a whole figure, or a beast all emerged from the rock. These were covered in timber scaffolding to keep them safe.

==Trade==
The mining efforts in Angelhead were led by forewoman [[Mira Thamros]] and owned by the [[dwarven]] merchant [[Melkhor Goldseeker]]. Melkhor made an agreement with the local [[Blackdagger Bandits]], offering them a large portion of his profits in exchange for protection from their raids.

==History==
[[File:NW Angelhead Mine statue 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Part of a massive statue, possibly the "angel head".'']]
[[File:NW Angelhead Mine statue 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The upside-down statue of a winged lion suspended from a ceiling.'']]
The source of the statues and ruins in the mine, or how they got there, is unknown.<ref group="note">That is, no explanation is given in ''Neverwinter''. It may be a normal ancient ruin buried over time, the [[Spellplague]] spontaneously transporting these things underground, or a site buried in the [[Mount Hotenow]] eruption of [[1451 DR]]. Taggot's quest suggests a connection to Delzoun.

The mines were opened in the late 1470s DR by dwarf merchant Melkhor Goldseeker. However, they were in the territory of the Blackdagger Bandits, who demanded a large cut of the profits to leave them alone. Otherwise, they cared little for mining and the mines had no other value to them.

Then, in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Melkhor's miners unearthed ancient ruins, statues, and the great stone head after which the mine was named. Learning of this and thinking they could find treasure too, the Blackdaggers reneged on their agreement with Melkhor and sent [[Krag Foultooth]], the leader of their [[gnoll]] forces, to attack the mind, capture and enslave the miners, and take whatever treasure could be found for themselves. Krag took the forewoman Mira Thamros, Melkhor's niece, hostage in order to ensure he would not disrupt their operations. Meanwhile, the Blackdaggers raided Melkhor's wagons and bandit leader [[Marion Hexbane]] sent some of her men to the [[Broken Crown]] inn to apply their new leverage on Melkhor.

Fearing his business ruined and niece threatened, Melkhor gave up hope until an [[adventurer]] sent by [[Xalliana]] to investigate came to him. He admitted what had happened and asked the adventurer to check the wagons and go to the mining base camp to learn what had happened. There, a caravan guard and survivor of the attacks named [[Yates|Sergeant "Dusty" Yates]] explained what had happened and sent them to free the captives and recover the mine for her employer. The adventurer delved into the mines, slew the Blackdagger bandits along with their leader, and freed the miners and forewoman and ensured Mira made it out of the mines safe and sound.

Meanwhile, the dwarf adventurer [[Taggot Ironshroud]] was searching caves in the area for relics from the ancient dwarven kingdom of [[Delzoun]]. He wished to retrieve them in order to preserve dwarven culture, rather than make a profit of them like the avaricious Melkhor.
