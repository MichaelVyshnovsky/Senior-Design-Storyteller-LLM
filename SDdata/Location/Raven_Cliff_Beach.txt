'''Raven Cliff Beach''' was a stretch of coastland on the [[Sword Coast North]] that was long-associated with criminal groups such as dreadful pirates and murderous bandits.

==Geography==
The beach was located west of [[Neverwinter Wood]], some ways of north of the city of [[Neverwinter]].

===Geographical Features===
It featured a network of rather spacious sea caves that were regularly used by smugglers and other lawbreakers.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the beach and surrounding coastland was ravaged by pirate raids led by [[Traven Blackdagger]].

Some time round the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the beach was again overrun with the activity of ne'er-do-wells associated with the Blackdaggers. The culprits then were the [[Blackdagger bandits]] led by the vicious [[Jareth Grim]], who led the groups raids on behalf of the undead Traven Blackdagger, who had been risen as a skeletal pirate captain by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Kallos Tam]].

Also around that time, [[Marion Hexbane]] set up operations within the sea caves set into beach's cliff face.

The bandits' activities were thwarted by the combined efforts of the [[Harpers]] [[Seven Toes]], [[Garl Gnarlclaw]], and [[Xalliana]], and their ally, the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].

==Notable Locations==
In addition to these two landmarks, the cliffs overlooking the beach were dotted with a number of small lighthouses.

* [[Broken Crown]], a small establishment owned and run by [[Gorun Pricebreaker]].
* [[Cragmire Keep]], the ruined keep of the noble [[Cragmire]] family was taken over by the [[Blackdagger Bandits]].
* [[Hidden Cove]], a beachside cavern that opened up to an underground lake.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Lenn|Old Lenn]], a retired lighthouse keeper.
