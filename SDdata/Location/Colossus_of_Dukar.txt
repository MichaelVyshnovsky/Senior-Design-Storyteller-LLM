The '''Colossus of Dukar''' was a gigantic monument in the underwater city of [[Myth Nantar]] depicting the near-mythical [[triton]] of the [[Dukar (individual)|same name]], the first Grand Master of the [[Dukar]]s, an ancient [[Ser√¥s]]ian order of [[wizard]]s.

==Location==
The Colossus stood within the [[Dukar Quarter]] of Myth Nantar, next to the [[Dukars' Academy]], with its legs straddling the entrance to Dukar's tomb.

==Description==
This statue stood {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} tall, making it the tallest structure in the city. It was completely carved from [[lucent coral]], which naturally gave off a bright glow and thus made the Colossus the source of one-fourth of all light in Myth Nantar. It depicted Dukar with his legendary ''[[Grandmaster's Tapal]]'' raised overhead in his right arm.

The Colossus was notably the site of one of the few [[portal]]s within the city that the dukar [[Qos]] would freely divulge to anyone. This hidden portal opened to the former gates of the city of [[Akhanmyr]] and in order to activate it one had to swim in a loop around the Colossus's head three times before swimming straight upwards.

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|-168|TS}}, a group of dukar of the [[Jhimari]] and [[Numos]] orders went rogue, wanting to transform Myth Nantar into their own city-state by the name of Nantarum. Sometime later around {{YearlinkConvert|-150|TS}}, on the day the merfolk king [[Ristan]] laid siege against them, the thirty rogue dukars were standing around the Colossus of Dukar as the city's [[mythal]] let off bursts of [[magic]]al energy. The dukars were later found by the attackers to have been [[petrification|petrified]] into [[coral]] statues, lining the avenue leading to the Dukars' Academy, their faces frozen with looks of contrition.

On [[Marpenoth 30]], [[1369 DR]], when [[Iakhovas]] and his forces launched an assault upon the city of Myth Nantar the [[Oghmanyte]] [[bard]] [[Pacys]] stood atop the Colossus of Dukar, overlooking the battle. From there he played upon his instrument [[saceddar]], singing a ballad he had written for Myth Nantar's defenders to magically inspire them.

Late in the year [[1370 DR]], among the thirty petrified dukars a [[sea elf]] of the Order of Jhimar by the name of [[Radom]] mysteriously returned to life, leaving only twenty-nine petrified dukars around the Colossus.<ref>
