        "mainbody": "The '''Lizard Marsh''' was a large bayou in the delta of the [[Delimbiyr]] river meeting the [[Sea of Swords]].",
        "Description": "The Delimbiyr river, also called the River Shining, plunged into the bogs and scattered waterways of the swamp delta. The Marsh was filled with cold and humid [[hanging moss]]-filled mangroves. The marshes did not freeze over in the winter, turning into slush instead. Sages were not sure of the reasons why that was the case. Some believed it was because of the seawater, while others suspected a magical phenomenon.\n\nA subterranean underwater cave connected the old dried-up well in Daggerford's [[Western Farmlands]]. The tunnel could only be traversed by the strongest swimmer and aquatic creatures.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Fauna": "A variety of monstrous creatures and voracious insects inhabited the Lizard Marsh, including the eponymous lizardfolk\n\nAmong other dangerous inhabitants of the marsh were [[giant spider]]s, [[dire spider]]s, and [[wraith spider]]s, as well as bloated queen spiders of these species. Several species of [[giant beetle]] could also be encountered in the swamp, including [[giant bombardier beetle]]s, [[stink beetle]]s, and [[giant stag beetle]]s. Among more mundane animals, [[wild dog]]s, [[badger]]s, and vicious [[piranha]] were a common occurrence. Rarer and deadlier creatures in the green muck included young [[black dragon]]s and wyrmlings, and even the occasional hungry [[bulette]]. A huge species of dinosaur known as the [[thunderbeast]]s were known to have inhabited the region or its adjacent lands at some point before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By the late 14{{th}} century, their presence was only evident by sets of [[thunderhide armor]] favored by the wild druids who called the Lizard Marsh their home.\n\nBy the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], more common encounters within the marsh included [[giant frog]]s, [[giant lizard]]s, [[giant centipede]]s, [[stirge]]s, [[constrictor snake]]s, and [[will-o'-wisp]]s. [[Bullywug]]s, [[harpies]], [[troll]]s, and [[green hag]]s were among more intelligent inhabitants of the swamps, while [[hydra]]s were also not unheard of.",
            "Flora": "A species of giant gourds was a staple of the area. These enormous edible fruits were hollowed out and dried by the lizardfolk of the Marsh, making them into oversized containers, often bigger than an adult [[human]] in size. These gourds were painted, decorated, and used to store various liquids, such as freshwater, fermented alcoholic libations, and small swimming snacks. One such gourd became a curio item known as the [[Castaway Gourd]] and was displayed in [[Torleth's Treasures]] of [[Gillian's Hill]].\n\nA species of flowering plant, simply called [[brightflower]]s could be found along the water edges in the marsh. This hardy plant had bright yellow flowers that, when crushed, served as a natural [[leech]] and [[mosquito]] repellant."

        "Government": "Even though several tribes of lizardfolk dwelled in the marsh, many of them were united under the leadership of an ancient and cunning lizard-man known to others as [[Redeye]]. The leader was known to use magical powers to impress his followers.\n\nSeveral of the tribes splintered from Redeye's rule and worshiped black dragons as their gods, namely dragons [[Thuraskulusk]], [[Thoss Fyurnen]], and [[Cheleen]].",
        "History": "In [[302 DR]], the settlement of [[Tavaray]], which was located on the edge of the Lizard Marsh, was abandoned by its inhabitants and swallowed by the swamp's rising waters. That was one of the factors that contributed to the diminished influence of [[Illuskan]] on the Sword Coast south of the [[Sword Mountains]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], a lizard man witch doctor named Redeye was attempting to unify the lizardfolk of the marshes. To this end, he was attempting to trade metal weapons from nearby [[Daggerford]]'s armory and merchants, in exchange for bird feathers and various delicacies. However, the request was shut down by Daggerford's [[Council of Guilds]].<ref group=\"note\">While the exact year is not stated, [[Pwyll Daggerford]] became Duke after his father's death in the [[First Dragonspear War]] of [[1356 DR]]. During the same stretch of time, Baron [[Cromm Redhand]] was a common sight in the Lizard Marsh, where he game-hunted dinosaurs and an occasional lizard-man.\n\nMany years before [[1370 DR]], a group of heroes ventures into the muck of the Lizard Marsh and slew the king of the lizardfolk known as Redeye. However, ''circa'' 1370 DR, a lizard man [[lich]] calling himself Redeye reemerged in the Marsh and took over the leadership once again. It was not known if the [[undead]] Redeye was indeed the same Redeye who was killed by adventurers, however, many researchers and scholars were interested in the nature of that mysterious lich lizardfolk.\n\nSometime before [[1372 DR]], a group of adventurers led by [[Emythene Faldree]], traversed the dangers of the Marsh. The deadly trek cost many companions' lives as they battled with nature, lizardfolk, black dragons, poisonous snakes, and [[giant snapping turtle]]s. The adventurers' exploits were published in the book titled ''[[Beware the Lizard Marsh!]]'' that served as a guide and a cautionary story.\n\n1372 DR was a tumultuous year for the inhabitants of the Lizard Marsh. A lizardfolk tribe, led by a shaman [[Uzzak-Szalzik]] and chieftain [[Saslick]] took to worshiping an ancient black dragon [[Thuraskulusk]], slitting from under Redeye's leadership. Conniving ruler, Redeye allied with the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] and the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to bring the tribe back under his control. The hag, who feuded with shaman Uzzak-Szalzik, provided the Hero and their companions with magics that disguised them as lizardfolk, while Redeye stole Thuraskulusk's egg and ordered the hero to stash it in chieftain Saslick's hut, framing him for the egg's theft. Eventually, the plan succeeded and the angered dragon slew chieftain Saslick and withdrew his protection of the tribe.\n\nSometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[galleon]] named the ''[[Sea Robber]]'' was washed ashore by some mysterious great wave and sank within the putrid waters of the Lizard Marsh. A part of the ship, along with numerous shattered [[barrel]]s, was accessible from the swamp, appearing nothing but a dark mound rising from the mud.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Cromm's Hold]], a stone keep owned by [[Wynne Cromm|Duchess Wynne Cromm]].\n* [[Krandon Manor]], a stone house, long abandoned leftover from the time then Daggerford attempted to expand into the Lizard Marsh. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the manor was occupied by inbred and especially ugly [[half-orc]], [[half-dwarf]] [[Clotskull tribe]] of [[orc]] bandits.\n* [[Tavaray]], an abandoned settlement, reclaimed by the swamp in 302 DR.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Caustilancer]], a [[black dragon]] who laired in the Marsh in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Mama Booga]], a matriarch and leader of the inbred orcs of Krandon Manor in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Redeye]], the ancient leader of the lizardfolk who returned to life as a lich after being slain by a gang of adventurers.\n* [[Thoss Fyurnen]], an adult black dragon and the [[Chosen of Talona]] who, along with his mate, [[Cheleen]], laired in the Lizard Marsh and planned on taking over the region in the late 15{{th}} century DR."
