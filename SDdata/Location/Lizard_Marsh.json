        "mainbody": "he Lizard Marsh was a large bayou in the delta of the Delimbiyr river meeting the Sea of Swords.\nThe Delimbiyr river, also called the River Shining, plunged into the bogs and scattered waterways of the swamp delta. The Marsh was filled with cold and humid hanging moss-filled mangroves. The marshes did not freeze over in the winter, turning into slush instead. Sages were not sure of the reasons why that was the case. Some believed it was because of the seawater, while others suspected a magical phenomenon.\nA subterranean underwater cave connected the old dried-up well in Daggerfords Western Farmlands. The tunnel could only be traversed by the strongest swimmer and aquatic creatures.\nA variety of monstrous creatures and voracious insects inhabited the Lizard Marsh, including the eponymous lizardfolk\nAmong other dangerous inhabitants of the marsh were giant spiders, dire spiders, and wraith spiders, as well as bloated queen spiders of these species. Several species of giant beetle could also be encountered in the swamp, including giant bombardier beetles, stink beetles, and giant stag beetles. Among more mundane animals, wild dogs, badgers, and vicious piranha were a common occurrence. Rarer and deadlier creatures in the green muck included young black dragons and wyrmlings, and even the occasional hungry bulette. A huge species of dinosaur known as the thunderbeasts were known to have inhabited the region or its adjacent lands at some point before the 14 century DR. By the late 14 century, their presence was only evident by sets of thunderhide armor favored by the wild druids who called the Lizard Marsh their home.\nBy the 15 century DR, more common encounters within the marsh included giant frogs, giant lizards, giant centipedes, stirges, constrictor snakes, and will-o-wisps. Bullywugs, harpies, trolls, and green hags were among more intelligent inhabitants of the swamps, while hydras were also not unheard of.\nA species of giant gourds was a staple of the area. These enormous edible fruits were hollowed out and dried by the lizardfolk of the Marsh, making them into oversized containers, often bigger than an adult human in size. These gourds were painted, decorated, and used to store various liquids, such as freshwater, fermented alcoholic libations, and small swimming snacks. One such gourd became a curio item known as the Castaway Gourd and was displayed in Torleths Treasures of Gillians Hill.\nA species of flowering plant, simply called brightflowers could be found along the water edges in the marsh. This hardy plant had bright yellow flowers that, when crushed, served as a natural leech and mosquito repellant.\nEven though several tribes of lizardfolk dwelled in the marsh, many of them were united under the leadership of an ancient and cunning lizard-man known to others as Redeye. The leader was known to use magical powers to impress his followers.\nSeveral of the tribes splintered from Redeyes rule and worshiped black dragons as their gods, namely dragons Thuraskulusk, Thoss Fyurnen, and Cheleen.\nIn 302 DR, the settlement of Tavaray, which was located on the edge of the Lizard Marsh, was abandoned by its inhabitants and swallowed by the swamps rising waters. That was one of the factors that contributed to the diminished influence of Illuskan on the Sword Coast south of the Sword Mountains.\nCirca 1357 DR, a lizard man witch doctor named Redeye was attempting to unify the lizardfolk of the marshes. To this end, he was attempting to trade metal weapons from nearby Daggerfords armory and merchants, in exchange for bird feathers and various delicacies. However, the request was shut down by Daggerfords Council of Guilds.While the exact year is not stated, Pwyll Daggerford became Duke after his fathers death in the First Dragonspear War of 1356 DR. During the same stretch of time, Baron Cromm Redhand was a common sight in the Lizard Marsh, where he game-hunted dinosaurs and an occasional lizard-man.\nMany years before 1370 DR, a group of heroes ventures into the muck of the Lizard Marsh and slew the king of the lizardfolk known as Redeye. However, circa 1370 DR, a lizard man lich calling himself Redeye reemerged in the Marsh and took over the leadership once again. It was not known if the undead Redeye was indeed the same Redeye who was killed by adventurers, however, many researchers and scholars were interested in the nature of that mysterious lich lizardfolk.\nSometime before 1372 DR, a group of adventurers led by Emythene Faldree, traversed the dangers of the Marsh. The deadly trek cost many companions lives as they battled with nature, lizardfolk, black dragons, poisonous snakes, and giant snapping turtles. The adventurers exploits were published in the book titled Beware the Lizard Marsh! that served as a guide and a cautionary story.\n1372 DR was a tumultuous year for the inhabitants of the Lizard Marsh. A lizardfolk tribe, led by a shaman Uzzak-Szalzik and chieftain Saslick took to worshiping an ancient black dragon Thuraskulusk, slitting from under Redeyes leadership. Conniving ruler, Redeye allied with the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh and the Hero of Daggerford to bring the tribe back under his control. The hag, who feuded with shaman Uzzak-Szalzik, provided the Hero and their companions with magics that disguised them as lizardfolk, while Redeye stole Thuraskulusks egg and ordered the hero to stash it in chieftain Saslicks hut, framing him for the eggs theft. Eventually, the plan succeeded and the angered dragon slew chieftain Saslick and withdrew his protection of the tribe.\nSometime in the late 15 century DR, the galleon named the Sea Robber was washed ashore by some mysterious great wave and sank within the putrid waters of the Lizard Marsh. A part of the ship, along with numerous shattered barrels, was accessible from the swamp, appearing nothing but a dark mound rising from the mud.\n* Cromms Hold, a stone keep owned by Duchess Wynne Cromm.\n* Krandon Manor, a stone house, long abandoned leftover from the time then Daggerford attempted to expand into the Lizard Marsh. In the late 15 century DR, the manor was occupied by inbred and especially ugly half-orc, half-dwarf Clotskull tribe of orc bandits.\n* Tavaray, an abandoned settlement, reclaimed by the swamp in 302 DR.\n* Caustilancer, a black dragon who laired in the Marsh in the late 15 century DR.\n* Mama Booga, a matriarch and leader of the inbred orcs of Krandon Manor in the late 15 century DR.\n* Redeye, the ancient leader of the lizardfolk who returned to life as a lich after being slain by a gang of adventurers.\n* Thoss Fyurnen, an adult black dragon and the Chosen of Talona who, along with his mate, Cheleen, laired in the Lizard Marsh and planned on taking over the region in the late 15 century DR."
