        "mainbody": "The Shrine to Mystra was a holy place devoted to the goddess Mystra in Shadowdale.\nThe shrine was a low step pyramid of three wide steps.\nIt was located behind the temple of Tymora, and was twenty feet by twenty feet on its base and ten feet by ten feet at the top. This top step was made of dark stone and was inscribed with the symbol of Mystra in silver. The shrine had no caretakers or clergy, but was tended by worshipers.\nFollowers of Mystra originally wanted to build a shrine on the ruins of Sylunes Hut, but Lord Mourngrym wouldnt allow it. In compromise, they built a shrine that allowed viewing of both Sylunes Hut and Elminsters Tower and, as of 1367 DR, it was viewed by both visitors and townsfolk alike.\nIn Hammer, 1375 DR, the Zhents took over Shadowdale, and removed the silver from the top of the shrine, defacing the carved stone at the top. Dark Doom Malathon, a half-orc priest of Bane, cast unhallow upon the shrine and sacrificed at least three villagers upon the altar to the Black Lord.\nCategoryShrines\nCategoryShrines to Mystra\nCategoryMystran locations\nCategoryLocations in Shadowdale (town)\nCategoryLocations in Shadowdale\nCategoryLocations in the Dalelands\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\nqng6iutv3r98l4l4jzj9htf9p3enxr2"
