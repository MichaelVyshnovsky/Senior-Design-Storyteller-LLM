        "mainbody": "The Shining Lands, or the Lands of the One, was the collective term used for three of the countries surrounding the Golden Water. These were Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden.\nThe term \"Lands of the One\" was derived from the fact that all three counties followed the belief in Adama.\nLocated in the southeast corner of Faerûn along the northern shore of the Great Sea, the Shining Lands represented the last civilized region before reaching the mysterious Utter East.\nAll of the counties of the Shining Lands were hot areas that possessed rich soil. The inhabitants of these lands considered this region the \"land of gold.\" Winter rainfall and storms were mild except in the southern regions along the shore of the Great Sea.\nThe countries of Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden all shared the same way of life because Durpar controlled the other countries for many years. In fact, the term \"Durparian\" usually referred to anyone from these three countries, not just someone from Durpar. These countries were ultimately ruled by the Council of Merchants from Heldapan.\nThe Shining Lands officially came into being in 1023 DR when Jeradeem, a rich merchant who represented Durpar and Var the Golden, purchased the famished country of Estagund from its king for the price of 24 gems.\nIn mid—14 century DR, the Imperial Fleet of Doegan was busy fighting the pirates and independent navy vessels of the Golden Lands. Some speculated that this display of naval force was the first step in the emperor Aetheric the Thirds conquest plans and the expansion of the Imperial Reaches of Doegan.\n* Dustwall Mountains\n* Golden Water\n* Curna Mountains\n* Forest of Gundar\n* Ajmer Forest\n* Gryphon Mountains\n* Adamas Wrath\n* Adamas Tooth"
