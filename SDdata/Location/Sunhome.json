        "mainbody": "unhome was a desert dwarf settlement deep in the House of Tezca in Maztica. The dwarves in this settlement knew the location of the Sunstone that was near their settlement.\nSunhome was a small village composed of cave-homes inside a canyon in a remote part of the desert. It also included a clearing in the canyon floor.\nVery few human visitors ever found this settlement and those that did were usually looking for the sunstone. The dwarves would sometimes rescue humans they found in the desert and bring them to the village.\nIn the , the Rockfire cataclysm occurred in the Underdark beneath Maztica. The cataclysm ended up destroying much of the Underdark beneath Maztica and made the remaining sections uninhabitable. One of the surviving dwarf tribes migrated to the surface and came to inhabit the shallow caves that became Sunhome.\nIn the , Poshtli of Nexal received a vision from the god Qotal to come into the desert and seek out the Sunstone. He ventured into the desert and almost perished, but he was rescued by Luskag, the chieftain of Sunhome, after the latter had received a dream that he took as a sign to rescue him. Luskag later took Poshtli to the Sunstone, where Poshtli received another vision. They then returned to Sunhome again, where Poshtli then departed."
