Mantol-Derith () was a trading city situated in an underground cavern three miles below the surface.
Its exact location was not known by many. The nearest drow settlement was Menzoberranzan, or Ched Nasad before that citys destruction. 
Mantol-Derith was located in a twisted cavern 60â€“70 feet tall and twice as wide. The city was heavily guarded and protected by strong magic. The city itself primarily comprised trade caravans and campsites.
In 1372 DR, the city was was very quiet because of the problems during the Silence of Lolth in Menzoberranzan and elsewhere. The drow group led by Quenthel Baenre stayed here while they worked to gain access to Gracklstugh across the Darklake.
It had small groups of merchants of many races drow, illithid, svirfneblin, and duergar.
 Central market  The market was ringed with giant fungi and merchants set up stalls selling fruit, perfume, woods, and spices beneath them.
 Nameless inn  The innkeeper of the nameless inn was a duergar woman named Dinnika who kept goblin slaves. They served mushroom ale and surface lagers. The rooms were located in crevices behind petrified mushroom doors.
 Warehouses  There was one huge storage area at each of the four corners of the cavern, representing the four factions present in the city.
