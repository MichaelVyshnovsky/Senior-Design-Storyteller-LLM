'''Mantol-Derith''' ({{Pronounce|MAN|toll|DARE|ith|refs=}}) was a trading city situated in an underground cavern three miles below the surface.

==Geography==
Its exact location was not known by many. The nearest [[drow]] settlement was [[Menzoberranzan]], or [[Ched Nasad]] before that city's destruction. 

==Structure==
Mantol-Derith was located in a twisted cavern 60â€“70 feet tall and twice as wide. The city was heavily guarded and protected by strong magic. The city itself primarily comprised trade caravans and campsites.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the city was was very quiet because of the problems during the [[Silence of Lolth]] in Menzoberranzan and elsewhere. The [[drow]] group led by [[Quenthel Baenre]] stayed here while they worked to gain access to Gracklstugh across the Darklake.

==Inhabitants==
It had small groups of merchants of many races: [[drow]], [[illithid]], [[svirfneblin]], and [[duergar]].

==Notable locations==
; Central market : The market was ringed with giant fungi and merchants set up stalls selling [[fruit]], [[perfume]], woods, and [[spices]] beneath them.
; Nameless inn : The innkeeper of the nameless inn was a duergar woman named [[Dinnika]] who kept [[goblin]] slaves. They served mushroom ale and surface lagers. The rooms were located in crevices behind petrified mushroom doors.
; Warehouses : There was one huge storage area at each of the four corners of the cavern, representing the four factions present in the city.
