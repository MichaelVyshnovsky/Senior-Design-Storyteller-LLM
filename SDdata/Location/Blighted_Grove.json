        "mainbody": "The Blighted Grove, also known as the Blighted Forest was a wild region of the Feywild that was corrupted by the malevolent influence of the dark fey.\nThe once-beautiful forest was tainted by the efforts of the fomorian king Malabog of the Feydark, and the denizens of the dark fey enclave located elsewhere in the Feywild.\nAfter Malabog formed an alliance with the lich Valindra Shadowmantle, circa the Faer√ªnian , he began a campaign of destruction and scourge against every living being within the Feywild. He inflicted the creatures and the plants of the forest with blight and disease, corrupting the very soil of the earth within the plane.\nIn response, the Iliyanbruen elves of New Sharandar launched a campaign against the corruptive influence of Malabog and the dark fey. Under the leadership of Pelendethas Everstride, they worked with adventurers to slay the evil creatures that overran the forest, destroyed and then healed the corrupted plants that took root in its earth, and nurtured new life by planting seedlings that had been enchanted by magic.\nPelendethas uncovered the whereabouts of a particularly harmful fomorian champion that was known as the Scion of Corruption, and enlisted the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to defeat the twisted giant.\nLandmarks\n* Gnarlroot cave, an underground cave system that was corrupted by the red cap Grimak Nailbiter.\n* Wyldwood Gate, a portal that linked the grove to New Sharandar."
