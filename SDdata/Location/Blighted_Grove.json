He inflicted the creatures and the plants of the forest with blight and disease, corrupting the very soil of the earth within the plane.\n\nIn response, the [[Iliyanbruen]] elves of [[New Sharandar (Feywild)|New Sharandar]] launched a campaign against the corruptive influence of Malabog and the dark fey. Under the leadership of [[Pelendethas Everstride]], they worked with adventurers to slay the evil creatures that overran the forest, destroyed and then healed the corrupted plants that took root in its earth, and nurtured new life by planting seedlings that had been enchanted by [[magic]].\n\nPelendethas uncovered the whereabouts of a particularly harmful fomorian champion that was known as the [[Scion of Corruption]], and enlisted the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to defeat the twisted giant.",
