        "mainbody": "'''Mistledale''', considered one of the ''rustic dales'' of the [[Dalelands]], was a quiet and friendly land covering a vast expanse of grassland within the forest of [[Cormanthor]]. It consisted of a small number of hamlets as well as the large city of [[Ashabenford]] and bisected by the major road of the [[Moonsea Ride]].",
        "Society": "The Mistren were a friendly and welcoming lot, and their home was often free from the typical troubles of the dales. The dale was so often free from danger and excitement that it was often considered somewhat boring by travelers and adventurers.",
        "Government": {
            "Defenses": "The first line of defense in Mistledale were the [[Riders of Mistledale]], 30 mounted defenders who patrolled the dale, apprehended criminals and protected the townsfolk from outside incursions. These Riders were supplemented by a local and well-armed militia, who numbered about 200 active members and at least 600 more that can be made available, if needed. Both the Riders of Mistledale and the militia were based in [[Ashabenford]]\n\nDue to the widely spread settlements of dale, each hamlet was equipped with special bells that could raise messages of alarm or inquiry with nearby settlements. These were especially useful in the early morning fog that can fill the valley."
        },
        "Economy": "Situated along the well-traveled [[Moonsea Ride]], many of the dale's farmers made their way to [[Ashabenford]] where mechants from [[Cormyr]] and the [[Moonsea]] often stopped to buy produce and trade. Much of the trade passed through the [[Black Eagle Coster|Black Eagle]] trading coster and [[Jarwain's Imports]] company in Ashabenford.\n[[File:Mistledale - tantras novel.png|thumb|''A map of Mistledale, [[Shadowdale]], and [[Cormanthor]].'']]",
        "History": {
            "14{{th}} century": "Mistledale's claim to fame was the defeat of Lord [[Lashan Aumersair]] in [[1356 DR]], along with the help of [[Shadowdale]] and others.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], during the events of the [[Time of Troubles]], the [[Riders of Mistledale]] were even able to rebuff an army from [[Zhentil Keep]]. However, they seem unable to combat the incursions of the local [[drow]] who were steadily growing in power.\n\nThis was among the more peaceful of the Dales, although as of [[1372 DR]], drow incursions from the forest, led by [[House Jaelre]], began causing serious problems. They raided Highdale in an effort to distract from fortresses that had been rising from the [[Elven Court]]."
