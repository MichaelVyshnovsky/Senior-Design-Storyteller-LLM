The City Bastion was a district of the dragonborn city of Djerad Thymar.
The City Bastion was the upper level of Djerad Thymar, a giant pyramid whose summit had a flat end. Other sources, such as Clan Kepeshkmoliks ancestor stories, claim the pyramid was built in Faer√ªn using rocks from the Smoking Mountains and the magic of a powerful artifact known as the Breath of Petron.
The City Bastion was numerous levels high. The Vanquisher also had his or her own enclave, that doubled as an office of power and as the headquarters of the Adjudicators. Other enclaves served as schools and academies.
The enclaves were separated by walkways and bridges, The ceiling of the pyramid also served as the Lance Roost, home to a colony of giant bats that served as the mounts of the Lance Defenders. Above the City Bastion were the Lance Barracks, an open-air platform that served as the headquarters of the Lance Defenders.
The interior of the pyramid was lit by magical glowing balls embedded on the walls. The magical illumination waxed and waned at intervals to match the cycles of day and night outside the city, and had magical properties that allowed it to nourish the different kinds of plants dragonborn cultivated in their enclaves and in the plazas between them.
The City-Bastion was connected to the Market Floor by a series of stairs and ramps, although the most influential clans also had teleportation rooms that allowed quick access to all levels of the pyramid. Such rooms were considered clan secrets and only trustworthy members of other clans or races knew about them.
