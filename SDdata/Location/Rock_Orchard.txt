'''Rock Orchard''' was a small hamlet on the shores of the scenic [[Firedrake Bay]], along the [[Firedrake Road]], in [[Tethyr]], best known for its [[apple]] harvests.

==Description==
The small village was one of many hamlets that were sprinkled along the minor trade route of the Firedrake Road, that bent along the [[Firedrake Shores]], through the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]], and reached the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]]. Rock Orchard was among more notable hamlets, along with its close northern neighbor â€“ the hamlet of [[Viperstone]].
