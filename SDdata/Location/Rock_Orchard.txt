Rock Orchard was a small hamlet on the shores of the scenic Firedrake Bay, along the Firedrake Road, in Tethyr, best known for its apple harvests.
The small village was one of many hamlets that were sprinkled along the minor trade route of the Firedrake Road, that bent along the Firedrake Shores, through the Dragons Neck Peninsula, and reached the Dragons Head Peninsula. Rock Orchard was among more notable hamlets, along with its close northern neighbor â€“ the hamlet of Viperstone.
