'''Caer-Dineval''' ({{Pronounce|kair|_|DIN|eh|vawl|refs=}}) was one of the towns of [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

==Geography==
Caer-Dineval was located on the northwestern bank of [[Lac Dinneshere]], not far south of [[Caer-Konig]].  It was situated in a half-circle around [[Knucklehead Harbor]], with [[the Caer]] castle overlooking the harbor from the ''Cliffs of Dinev'' in the east.

==Relationships==
The two towns of Caer-Dineval and Caer-Konig had an agreement to share fishing rights, but nevertheless squabbled over fishing territory.

==History==
[[File:Caer-Dineval 5e.png|thumb|''Caer-Dineval during the [[Everlasting Rime]].'']]
The [[Dinev]] family, displaced from their home in [[Cormyr]], originally built the castle in the {{Yearlink|1050}}, hoping to claim all of Icewind Dale for themselves. They abandoned it eight years later in [[1058 DR]] due to an [[orc]] siege that eliminated the town's population, either by death or by forcing them to flee. The Dinevs starved after three weeks inside their home and were too weak to fight back when the orcs got inside. A decade later, the castle was retaken from the orcs by the ancestors of the current townsfolk.

By the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, young [[Jensin Brent]] had become the councilman of the town. As spokesman, he lived in the Caer and greedily defended fishing rights against Caer-Konig.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Caer-Dineval was largely the same.
