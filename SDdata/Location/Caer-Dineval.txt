Caer-Dineval () was one of the towns of Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
Caer-Dineval was located on the northwestern bank of Lac Dinneshere, not far south of Caer-Konig.  It was situated in a half-circle around Knucklehead Harbor, with the Caer castle overlooking the harbor from the Cliffs of Dinev in the east.
The two towns of Caer-Dineval and Caer-Konig had an agreement to share fishing rights, but nevertheless squabbled over fishing territory.
