        "Geography": "Telfaran was found just south of [[Mirg Isle]] and north of [[Sarr]].",
        "Description": "Telfar's excellent natural harbor made it a popular resting point for pirates returning from the open sea laden with treasure.",
        "Inhabitants": "The threat of storms left Telfar uninhabited aside from temporary visitors.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Pirates familiar with the area usually avoided Telfar on nights where a full moon rose as entire ships were known to disappear here. Many speculated about the sinister causes of these disappearances, ranging from [[lycanthrope]]s to giant sea monsters, but the truth was a purely scientific one. The natural shape of Telfar's harbor caused water to rush out during the tidal change of the full moon, creating a large whirlpool capable of engulfing any nearby ships."
