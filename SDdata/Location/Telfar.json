        "mainbody": "Telfar was a small island in the southern Pirate Isles on the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nTelfaran was found just south of Mirg Isle and north of Sarr.\nTelfars excellent natural harbor made it a popular resting point for pirates returning from the open sea laden with treasure.\nThe threat of storms left Telfar uninhabited aside from temporary visitors.\nPirates familiar with the area usually avoided Telfar on nights where a full moon rose as entire ships were known to disappear here. Many speculated about the sinister causes of these disappearances, ranging from lycanthropes to giant sea monsters, but the truth was a purely scientific one. The natural shape of Telfars harbor caused water to rush out during the tidal change of the full moon, creating a large whirlpool capable of engulfing any nearby ships."
