        "Physical Description": "Standing atop a 100-ft-high (30 m) plateau, the elegant curves and fluted battlements of this castle represented the epitome of [[drow]] aesthetics. At 250-ft (76 m) tall and comprising seven floors, Castle Maerimydra was by far the largest noble house in Maerimydra.\n\nIt comprised three basic structures: the Great Tower, the Lesser Tower and the South Column.",
        "History": "Originally, the castle housed the hundreds of drow that comprised [[House Ch没mavh]] until the [[Silence of Lolth]] and the betrayal of the city's [[Archmage]] brought ruin to the drow city. The armies of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] attacked the city and, as the surviving loyalists of House Ch没mavh barred themselves inside Castle Maerimydra, the [[fire giant]]s, [[demon]]s, and [[goblinoid]]s besieged it.\n\nHowever, on [[Elient 28]], [[1372 DR]], [[Irae T'sarran]], the leader of the cult of [[Kiaransalee]] in Maerimydra, gathered her followers to her and slaughtered the remaining [[Lolth]]-worshiping drow of House Ch没mavh and seized the castle for her own. This was much to the annoyance of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], who also plotted to seize control of the city.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|4}}\n\nBy [[Marpenoth 17]], Irae managed to summon the [[Undying Temple]] above Castle Maerimydra, which disrupted the [[Weave]] in a growing radius around the castle.",
        "Defenses": "The castle was warded by a powerful ''[[forbiddance]]'' spell that prevented most creatures from entering without the proper password. The walls of the castle itself were magically strengthened to make them even harder to breach.",
