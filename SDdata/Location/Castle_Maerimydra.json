        "mainbody": "Castle Maerimydra was a fortification at the heart of Maerimydra and the seat of the ruling house.\nStanding atop a 100-ft-high (30 m) plateau, the elegant curves and fluted battlements of this castle represented the epitome of drow aesthetics. At 250-ft (76 m) tall and comprising seven floors, Castle Maerimydra was by far the largest noble house in Maerimydra.\nIt comprised three basic structures the Great Tower, the Lesser Tower and the South Column.\nOriginally, the castle housed the hundreds of drow that comprised House Chûmavh until the Silence of Lolth and the betrayal of the citys Archmage brought ruin to the drow city. The armies of Kurgoth Hellspawn attacked the city and, as the surviving loyalists of House Chûmavh barred themselves inside Castle Maerimydra, the fire giants, demons, and goblinoids besieged it.\nHowever, on Elient 28, 1372 DR, Irae Tsarran, the leader of the cult of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra, gathered her followers to her and slaughtered the remaining Lolth-worshiping drow of House Chûmavh and seized the castle for her own. This was much to the annoyance of the Jaezred Chaulssin, who also plotted to seize control of the city.\nBy Marpenoth 17, Irae managed to summon the Undying Temple above Castle Maerimydra, which disrupted the Weave in a growing radius around the castle.\nThe castle was warded by a powerful forbiddance spell that prevented most creatures from entering without the proper password. The walls of the castle itself were magically strengthened to make them even harder to breach.\nCategoryCastles\nCategoryLocations on the Grand Boulevard\nCategoryLocations in Maerimydra\nCategoryLocations in the Deep Wastes\nCategoryLocations in the Middledark\nCategoryLocations in the Underdark\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nenfyjkqlh0n65u1qmarycy8dt35v7n3"
