'''Orogoth''' was one of the most dangerous locations in the [[High Moor]] and was known for the presence of [[black dragon]]s.

==Description==
Orogoth was a large and sprawling ruined villa

Tunnels beneath the ruin connected it to the [[Serpent Tunnels]] of [[Najara]].

==Geography==
The ruin was located in the heart of the eastern [[High Moor]] about {{SI|55|miles|k|long=yes}} south of [[Hammer Hall]].

==History==
The villa was built in {{Yearlink|-2482}} by the [[Netherese]] Orogoth family. It served as their headquarters for their dark [[magical]] experiments and efforts to gain control over [[dragon]]s and to assume dragon shape. as well as of a titanic civil war in {{Yearlink|-2211}} during which the family seemingly wiped itself out.

In the {{YearlinkName|90}}, [[yuan-ti]] from [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]] raided the ruins and accidentally awoke a powerful [[black dragon]] known as "[[Calathanorgoth|the Old One]]". Despite repeated incursions by the yuan-ti, the ruin henceforth became the home and lair of this Old One and his descendants, who claimed to be the last scions of the ancient Orogoth family. 

By the {{YearlinkName|111}}, the Old One had enslaved several tribes of ophidians and had recruited Netherese [[wizards]] fleeing the fall of [[Anauria]],

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the reputation and mystique of Orogoth suddenly exploded. The ruin of became well-known among treasure seekers throughout the [[Sword Coast]], with [[Amnian]] adventurers and merchants becoming particularly enamored with tales of hidden caches of [[gem]]s collected by the powerful ancient family. This fame was such that the ruin was mentioned in every guide to the area, and even children heard tales of it. However, those who visited were killed, sent fleeing, or were transformed into beasts.

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Old One and his descendants continued to lair in Orogoth.{{Cite web/Villains: Rezmir}}

==Inhabitants==
{{Main|House Orogoth}}
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the villa was home to the black dracolich [[Calathanorgoth]]&mdash;better known as The Old One&mdash;and his living great-grandson, [[Wastirek]], along with Wastirek's mate [[Vilholin]] and their children, [[Awsidorg]], [[Woklef]], [[Cheleen]], and [[Kasidikal]].

Non-dragon inhabitants included [[human]] wizards descended from the Netherese recruited by Calathanorgoth centuries prior, many of whom studied ancient magic and collaborated with [[Halruaa]]s wizards. In addition, the villa was the headquarters of the largest ophidian tribe in the High Moor, appropriately calling themselves the [[Tribe of the Old One]]. Owing to experiments with ophidian eggs, House Orogoth created a means to manufacture half-dragon versions of the creatures. As of the 1370s DR, the Tribe of the Old One was led by a half-black dragon ophidian named [[Abreauth]].
