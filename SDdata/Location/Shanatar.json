It first came into being around {{Yearlink|-10800}} when [[Taark Shanat]] and his dwarves migrated west from [[Bhaerynden]] and defeated the inhabitants of the [[Rift of Dhalnadar]] in the [[Cloaker Wars]] to found [[Alatorin]].\n\nAfter the [[Spawn Wars]], the subterranean part of Shanatar consisting of the eight sub-kingdoms became known as \"Deep Shanatar\" whilst the part above ground became known as \"High Shanatar\".",

Of the original eight kingdoms that composed it, the sole surviving one is the reclusive [[Iltkazar]].\n\nWhereas in [[Alatorin]] the dwarves of Shanatar primarily venerated Moradin and [[Berronar]],{{fact}} the eight subkingdoms each venerated their own deity:\n* '''[[Barakuir]]''': the Iron Kingdom.

The dwarves asked the gods to decide which of them should sit on the [[Wyrmskull Throne]] of [[Brightaxe Hall]] in Taark Shanat's place and [[Dumathoin]] chose the king of [[Ultoksamrin]]. Dumathoin then became the patron of the shield dwarf race. This age ended with another invasion of the Guallidurth drow and the [[Third Spider War]] that lasted around thirty years.{{fact}}",

This saw the creation of [[High Shanatar]] and later, its destruction at the hands of the [[humans]] of Calimshan around {{Yearlink|-2600}}. This age also saw the rise and fall of [[Oghrann]] and [[Haunghdannar]] and the rise of [[Delzoun]] and [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]]. It ended when all of Deep Shanatar with the exception of [[Iltkazar]] was destroyed by the invading [[duergar]] who had once been its inhabitants.{{fact}}"
