The Horsefields was a beautiful glade located on the elven homeland of Evermeet.
The Horsefields was located in eastern Evermeet east of the River Ardulith and the Eagle Hills. Some of the glade bordered the Trackless Sea near Taltempla.
The glade got its name from the herds of mystical moon-horses that lived within.
