        "mainbody": "The '''Menesankh''', also known as the '''Plain of Life''', was the name of a region that encompassed the southern shore of the [[Alamber Sea]], in the [[Old Empires]] region.",
        "Geography": "The Menesankh region extended in a crescent around the southern end of the Alamber Sea up to the north. In the western shore, the Menesankh extended up to [[Red Haven]], in [[Unther]],\n\nThe lands of the Menesankh were fertile in extreme, thanks to being irrigated by many rivers, such as the [[River Alamber]] and the [[River of Swords]]. The [[Greenfields (Old Empires)|Greenfields]] of the southern Old Empires were part of the Menesankh region.",
        "History": "Before the foundation of Mulhorand and Unther, the Menesankh region was inhabited by [[Turami]] tribes that farmed the land for centuries until the arrival of the [[Mulan]]. Since that time, and util the late years of the 14{{Th}} century [[DR]], the Menesankh became the southern extent of both Mulhorand and Unther.\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the Menesankh was devastated by the catastrophe, although it was not hit as hard as the northern regions of [[Methtir]] and [[Taranoth]], although its northernmost region, around Dalath, was completely devastated. After the [[Wailing Years]], the Menesankh became part of both [[High Imaskar]] and [[Tymanther]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]], in [[1487 DR]], the [[Mulhorandi rebellion]] toppled High Imaskar, and Mulhorand became a sovereign territory again, reclaiming their hold over their ancient lands. Tymanther, however, was able to maintain almos all of the Menesankh region after winning the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]], while Unther was only able to reclaims the small part of the territory in the vicinity of [[Unthalass]].",
        "Notable locations": "As of [[1491 DR]]:\n\n====[[Mulhorand]]====\n* [[Gheldaneth]]\n* [[Neldorild]]\n* [[Sampranasz]]\n* [[Skuld]]\n\n====[[Tymanther]]====\n* [[Arush Ashuak]]\n* [[Djerad Kethendi]]\n* [[Djerad Thymar]]\n* The [[Greenfields (Old Empires)|Greenfields]]\n* [[Ruinspoke]]\n\n====[[Unther]]====\n* [[Unthalass]]\n\n====Bodies of water====\n* [[Ash Lake]]\n* [[Lance Lake]]\n* [[River Alamber]]\n* [[River of Spears]]\n* [[River of Swords]]"
