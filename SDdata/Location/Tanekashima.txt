Tanekashima was an island located in Kozakura.
Tanekashima was located off the southeastern tip of Kanshu. It was known for its tin mines that yielded a moderate output.
Tanekashima was the dwelling place of industrious korobokuru who toiled in the tin mines. They engaged in trade, either with traveling merchants or with the nearby town of Iewara.
An insectoid gargantua went on a destructive rampage across the island. There was a prevailing concern that its eggs remained dormant in the distant hills and could potentially hatch during a prolonged period of intense heat.
