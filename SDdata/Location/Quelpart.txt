The Quelpart was an island and fortress lying between Kang Bay and the Sea of Kozakura, off the coast of the Koryo Peninsula. It was important to the defense of Koryo, particularly against Kozakura, being the staging area of the kingdoms entire armada.Like many sites in Koryo, Quelpart shares a name with a real-world counterpart Jeju, an island and province of Korea that was given the Dutch name "Quelpart". In the Realms, Quelpart shares this origin with the island of Saishu and the settlement of Cheju.
The fortress and armada depended on daily barges via the Tenasu Ferry from the nearby city of Tu Pe for supplies. The city could support Quelpart for up to two months if under siege.
