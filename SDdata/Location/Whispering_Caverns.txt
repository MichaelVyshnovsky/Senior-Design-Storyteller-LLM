The Whispering Caverns was an expansive subterranean network found within the Northdark region of the Underdark, deep within the Sword Coast North. It was home to populations of drow and duergar, the latter of whom believed the lands to be haunted. In fact the caverns earned their name from the chilling whispers regularly heard by the underground dwarves.
The naturally-forming caverns were fairly easily-navigable as stone- and dirt-covered pathways wound throughout open expanses and into narrow passageways. Massive root-systems lined the rock walls of the caverns and rushing waterfalls helped give life to all manner of underground flora and fauna.
The Whispering Caverns were situated in the area of the Northdark, deep beneath the Crag Mountains. It was located nor far off from passageways that were once part of the ruined dwarven kingdom of Delzoun.
A wide variety of underground plant life was found within the caverns, including bitter berry plants and skullcap mushrooms.
Like many regions of the Underdark, the Whispering Caverns were home to many varieties of deadly and venomous spiders.
While there was no direct form of governance, the Whispering Caverns appeared to be under the influence of House Xorlarrin of QXorlarrin and originally Menzoberranzan. They established a prominent outpost in the region, and raided the surface land known as Rothé Valley for slaves.
Trade within the region was predominantly conducted between the native duergar residents and drow of House Xorlarrin. Some surface-dwelling traders accompanied expeditions that ventured into the caverns periodically, but their wares were akin to those of other common merchants found across the Sword Coast North.
Millennium before the Era of Upheaval, the Whispering Cavern was home to the elder brain known as Yshiggol that resided within the Dread Vault. It was Yshaggol that first whispered into the minds of the native duergar and brought them under the enslavement of its illithid colony.
After the slaving operation of House Xorlarrin was put to an end in Rothé Valley circa the , the drow relocated to the Whispering Caverns and their settlement of Zesraena. They rapidly killed or otherwise cast out the surface creatures that took up residence within. The drow did not however undertake any aggressions to the neighboring duergar settlements. Rather they offered them a non-aggression pact, ensuring their safety in exchange for weapons crafted by dwarven smiths.
Around the same time as the relocation of the Xorlarrin drow, a group illithids led by Revered Thlorrog arrived to the Whispering Caverns and enslaved the duergar of The Crucible. They used a mysterious crytalline formation to link their enclave in the Whispering Caverns with the long-lost Dread Vault.
Having used the ruins of Zesraena as their one-time base of operations, the Guild of Underdark Guides Neverwinter suffered a great setback when the Xorlarrin drow reclaimed their former city. They themselves relocated to the upper reaches of the caverns to continue their studies of the Underdark, and launch efforts to save their comrades that had been taken captive. They worked with the Hero of Sleeeping Dragon Bridge to uncover the link between the drow slavers, the native duergar, and returned group mind flayers. Through their combined efforts, the guild members along with their adventurer ally and their companions were able thwart Thlorrogs efforts to release Yshggol from the Dread Vault, and opened up a passageway to the long-lost dwarven city of Gauntlgrym.
In the 1480s DR, agents of the Cult of the Dragon reached out to Zhentarim to gain access to the Whispering Caverns, under the guise of purchasing poisons from the Xorlarrin drow. In fact one of the cults dragonsouls by the name of Thanin sought out the hoard of the ancient dragon Saphirax. After the Zhentarim became fully aware of the threat the cult posed to the Realms, they dispatched Dran Barrow and Shay Cutter to end their working relationship and destroy any evidence it ever existed.
Found within the caverns was a massive crystalline monolith known as the Iron Heart. Floating in the spacious caverns in a manner similar to an earthmote, the Iron Heart drew much speculation and wonder from the scholars and explorers that encountered or otherwise heard about the floating cuboidal structure.
