The '''Whispering Caverns''' was an expansive subterranean network found within the [[Northdark]] region of the [[Underdark]], deep within the [[Sword Coast North]]. It was home to populations of [[drow]] and [[duergar]], the latter of whom believed the lands to be haunted. In fact the caverns earned their name from the chilling whispers regularly heard by the underground dwarves.

==Description==
The naturally-forming caverns were fairly easily-navigable as stone- and dirt-covered pathways wound throughout open expanses and into narrow passageways. Massive root-systems lined the rock walls of the caverns and rushing waterfalls helped give life to all manner of underground flora and fauna.

==Geography==
The Whispering Caverns were situated in the area of the Northdark, deep beneath the [[Crag Mountains]]. It was located nor far off from passageways that were once part of the ruined dwarven kingdom of [[Delzoun]].

===Geographical Features===
===Flora & Fauna===
A wide variety of underground plant life was found within the caverns, including [[bitter berry]] plants and [[skullcap (fungus)|skullcap]] mushrooms.

Like many regions of the Underdark, the Whispering Caverns were home to many varieties of deadly and venomous spiders.

==Government==
While there was no direct form of governance, the Whispering Caverns appeared to be under the influence of [[House Xorlarrin]] of [[Q'Xorlarrin]] and originally [[Menzoberranzan]]. They established a prominent outpost in the region, and raided the surface land known as [[Rothé Valley]] for slaves.

==Trade==
Trade within the region was predominantly conducted between the native duergar residents and drow of House Xorlarrin. Some surface-dwelling traders accompanied expeditions that ventured into the caverns periodically, but their wares were akin to those of other common merchants found across the Sword Coast North.

==History==
Millennium before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the Whispering Cavern was home to the [[elder brain]] known as [[Yshiggol]] that resided within the [[Dread Vault]]. It was Yshaggol that first whispered into the minds of the native duergar and brought them under the enslavement of its illithid colony.

After the slaving operation of House Xorlarrin was put to an end in Rothé Valley ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the drow relocated to the Whispering Caverns and their settlement of [[Zesraena]]. They rapidly killed or otherwise cast out the surface creatures that took up residence within. The drow did not however undertake any aggressions to the neighboring duergar settlements. Rather they offered them a non-aggression pact, ensuring their safety in exchange for weapons crafted by dwarven smiths.

Around the same time as the relocation of the Xorlarrin drow, a group [[illithid]]s led by Revered [[Thlorrog]] arrived to the Whispering Caverns and enslaved the duergar of [[The Crucible]]. They used a [[Iron Heart|mysterious crytalline formation]] to link their enclave in the Whispering Caverns with the long-lost Dread Vault.

Having used the ruins of Zesraena as their one-time base of operations, the [[Guild of Underdark Guides]] Neverwinter suffered a great setback when the Xorlarrin drow reclaimed their former city. They themselves relocated to the upper reaches of the caverns to continue their studies of the Underdark, and launch efforts to save their comrades that had been taken captive. They worked with the [[Hero of Sleeeping Dragon Bridge]] to uncover the link between the drow slavers, the native duergar, and returned group mind flayers. Through their combined efforts, the guild members along with their adventurer ally and [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|their companions]] were able thwart Thlorrog's efforts to release Yshggol from the Dread Vault, and opened up a passageway to the long-lost dwarven city of [[Gauntlgrym]].

In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} agents of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] reached out to [[Zhentarim]] to gain access to the Whispering Caverns, under the guise of purchasing [[poison]]s from the Xorlarrin drow. In fact one of the cult's [[dragonsoul]]s by the name of [[Thanin]] sought out the hoard of the ancient dragon [[Saphirax]]. After the Zhentarim became fully aware of the threat the cult posed to the Realms, they dispatched [[Dran Barrow]] and [[Shay Cutter]] to end their working relationship and destroy any evidence it ever existed.

==Rumors & Legends==
Found within the caverns was a massive crystalline monolith known as the [[Iron Heart]]. Floating in the spacious caverns in a manner similar to an [[earthmote]], the Iron Heart drew much speculation and wonder from the scholars and explorers that encountered or otherwise heard about the floating cuboidal structure.

==Notable Locations==
* [[The Crucible]], a massive duergar fortress that was home to the [[Wrathforge]].
* [[Steelshear Mines]], the duergar-controlled mine that produced [[hellthorn]], a red-hued metal associated with the [[lower planes]].
* [[Verdant Caves]], a series of caves that were described as an oasis in the desert that is the Underdark.
* [[Zesraena]], an abandoned [[drow]] city that was used as a refuge for surface-dwelling travelers.

==Inhabitants==
The Whispering Caverns were home a large community of duergar dwarves, drow that relocated from nearby subterranean metropolises, and a community of [[mind flayer]]s that were searching for one of their [[Yshiggol|lost gods]].

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Davlin Hoth]], leader of the Neverwintan guild expedition.
* [[Relonagh Xorlarrin]], commander of House Xorlarrin's outpost in the caverns.
* Lady [[Vaskelis]], a noble-born female [[drider]] that resided within a drow villa in Zesraena.
* [[Wendolyn Shoosh]], a scholar of [[Candlekeep]] and member of the [[Order of Librarians Militant]] that ventured within to recover a ''[[Nematodes of the Northdark|lost tome]]''.
