'''Bistal's Bottom''', or simply '''the Bottom''', was a small village in [[Turmish]], [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
Bistal's Bottom was a collection of humble scattered buildings. The visitors of the hamlet were greeted by the village's name painted on a side of a mill. The settlement was lush with trees and gardens, perched on the side of a hollow turned a millpond.{{Cite polyhedron/104/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Country Treasures|7}}

Notably, the village was under protection of [[Oghma]] the Father of All Knowledge, a [[deity]] who served under [[Mystra]]. The god of knowledge kept the village safe because of [[the Cave of Memories]], hidden underneath.

==Geography==
Bistal's Bottom was located in the heart of Turmish, to the southeast from the town of [[Peldrathan's Pool]] and connected to it via a trail. Other neighboring cities included [[Zustild]], far to the south, [[Moonhunt Down]], to the north-east, and [[Nonthal]] to the east.{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|20}}

==History==
Bistal's Bottom was named after the person who owned a hollow around which the town grew. With time, the hollow was turned into the village's millpond.

Over the years, many adventuring bands, [[wizard]]s, [[priest]]s, and mercenaries tried to claim an ordinary-looking rocky hill in the village. Every single one of the would-be conquers found themselves aimlessly wandering the outskirts of Bistal's Bottom, affected by ''[[feeblemind]]'' magic. Since the village's founding, many children were lost after wandering too close to the strange hill and into the cavern at its summit. The defensive magics of the Cave of Memories sent these unwitting children to an unknown destinations far across the land never to be seen again. Because of these disappearances, locals believed the hill to be haunted.

==Notable Locations==
* Despite Bistal's Bottom's size, the town held a shrine to [[Tyr]].
* Perhaps the most notable thing about the sleepy little village was [[The Cave of Memories]] that laid beneath a rocky hilltop in Bistal's Bottom.

==Notable Inhabitants==
Most folk of the Bottom were simple famers that raised animals, and hunters. Several competent [[ranger]]s could be found within the village, as well as a family of [[halfling]]s who ran the Bottom's mill.

[[Shaeril]], the priestess of Oghma who kept a watchful eye on the Cave of Memories. It was believed she was empowered by her god to stand against group of strong fighters and even [[archmage]]s. She eagerly talked about the vision granted to the cave's visitors who managed to find their way back to Bistal's Bottom after being magically spirited away.
