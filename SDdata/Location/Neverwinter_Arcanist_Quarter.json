        "History": {
            "Eruption": "When Mount Hotenow erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the Arcanist Quarter was almost completely destroyed by the earthquakes that followed the cataclysm. The huge, canyon-like [[Chasm]] replaced most of the district, however a portion of the Arcanist Quarter remained floating several hundred feet down inside the ravine. It was presumed that the high concentration of [[arcane magic]] in the neighborhood had caused this part to become an [[earthmote]]."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The Arcanist Quarter was home to many [[spellcaster]]s, hence the name of the district. The area known as [[Apprentice Row]] housed a motley assortment of wannabe mages and students.\n\nNotable inhabitants prior to the [[Ruining]] included [[Roderick the Wary]]."
