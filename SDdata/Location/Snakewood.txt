The '''Snakewood''' was a relatively small forest located in eastern [[Amn]].

==Etymology==
It was given the name "Snakewood" because of the great number of black and green snakes that lived there.

==Geography==
The forest was located west of the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]], south of the [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Green Fields]], north of the [[Amstel River|Amstel]] and [[Splendarrllur]] rivers and east of the [[Cloud Peaks]].

==Flora & Fauna==
Other than snakes, the forest was known to be the home of small pockets of [[giant spider]]s

==History==
The Snakewood was once part of the great forest of [[Shantel Othreier]]. The forest was split off from Shantel Othreier by [[dragon]] fires as early as {{Yearlink|-11700}}.

By {{Yearlink|-1100}}, [[Elf|elves]] had slain the last great dragon from the forest, then known as the '''Wyrmwood''', and they founded a kingdom there, which they called '''Arundath''', the Quiet Wood.

The elves were nearly eradicated by [[human]]s during the last one hundred years of the [[Shoon Imperium]], (the late 350s [[DR]]). This was because the elves tried to protect a small herd of seven [[unicorn]]s in the woods from the evil emperor [[Shoon VII]], who wanted their horns for his magic, in particular for the powerful [[artifact]] known as the [[Tome of the Unicorn]]. In retaliation, Shoon VII hunted them down. About a third of the elves were driven from the forest, another third made into slaves, and the final third subjected to torturous magical experiments.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Duskwood Dell]] : This former elven settlement was the most sacred location to the goddess [[Eldath]] in [[Faerûn]].
; The [[Stone of Clans' Parting]] : This monolith was located on the eastern edge of the woods and contains ancient elven writing. It was also the center of a [[dead-magic zone]].
; [[Magar's Hill]] : Located in the foothills of the Troll Mountains, this was the site of the Stone of Clans' Parting and the place where [[Esmel Torlath]] slew a dragon in the days before the founding of Amn.
; [[River Rimril]] : This river flowed from the southern end of the Snakewood.
; The [[Vudlur]] : This stream originated from a spring within the forest.

==Inhabitants==
The forest contained a small number of [[beholders]] and [[Lycanthropy|lycanthropes]].

The ambitious [[green dragon]] [[Ringreemeralxoth]] laired in the northern hills southwest of [[Brigand's Gorge]] and west of the [[Gulf of Storms]]. [[Druid]]s of [[Eldath]] live in the central woods, in Duskwood Dell.

==Rumors & Legends==
Those living near the forest suspected that the Eldathyn druids might be the cause of the high population of snakes living there, but this had not been confirmed.
