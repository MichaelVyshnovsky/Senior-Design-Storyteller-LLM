The Glacier of the Lost King was located in the western reaches of what was once known as the kingdom of Guge.
The glacier rested upon the southwestern rim of the Hollow Crown Mountains.
Local rumor stated that this was the place where Kalon Doring, the last king of Guge, disappeared after having been driven mad  by the gods for challenging the armies of the Celestial Emperor.
The spirits, the king, and his men were said to roam the glacier, cursed to hate all life of the "warmlanders" as punishment by the gods.
