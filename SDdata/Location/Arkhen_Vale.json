        "mainbody": "The Arkhen Vale was a long valley within Archendale, created by the River Arkhen. Either side of the gorge was beset by steep cliffs leading down into the swift current of the Arkhen.\nThe Dawnpost road came into the vale from Ordulin, running alongside the River Arkhen until crossing it at the Arkhen Bridge just north of the city of Archenbridge, before extending further south to Daerlun. On the other end of the valley was a road leading north from White Ford,\nThe valley floor was rich with lush flora such as ferns, mosses and full of small ponds and waterfalls.\n*Archenbridge\n*White Ford"
