        "mainbody": "urkazar was a county in Tethyr located on the western foothills of the Omlarandin Mountains.\nCounty Surkazar was known for its beautiful, pastoral landscapes as much as for its danger from monsters from the mountains. The region contained Tethyrs largest population of sheep and had a large military presence.\nLocated in the Duchy of Suretmarch, Surkazar neighbored counties Alonmarch and Mirkazar. The Omlarandins were its eastern border, and the River Ith flowed to the north.\nCount Oon Santele, the Battalion Chancellor of Tethyr, ruled this county in 1370 DR. He was not a particularly talented organizer, but he had good councilors who helped him rule. The county seat was in Colbertann.\nThe fortified city of Saradush was located in Surkazar."
