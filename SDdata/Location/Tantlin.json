        "mainbody": "Tantlin, the City of Ice, was the largest city in Stygia, the 5 layer the Nine Hells occupying the most vast and central of its titanic icebergs. Its title was well-deserved, for every street and structure was in some way formed using ice. In the middle of the \"harbor\", which bordered on one side of the nearby River Styx, floated the iceberg prison of the ruling archdevil, Levistus, at least when it was not uncontrollably cruising across Stygia.\nLike the lesser settlements of Stygia, Tantlin was built atop an ice floe. was either carved directly from ice, including that of the iceberg it sat upon, or created by pouring water into shaped molds and freezing it. The city was arranged in concentric circles, and its translucent, serrated spires rose high into Stygias twilight sky. \nThe Stygian swamp curved about Tantlin for slightly less than half the run of its walls.\nTantlins social structure was a strict hierarchy embodied in its physical layout. A baatezus neighborhood in the City of Ice was dependent on its influence in the power structure. The closer to the center a baatezu lived, the higher their station, with the inner areas being reserved for the most powerful devils while extra-planar visitors were confined to the outermost ring along with the lowliest of infernal wretches. Entering a quadrant beyond ones station was an offense punishable by immediate execution.\nThroughout its known existence, Tantlin was an important hub of trade. During Geryons reign, the quarries nearby provided structural stone to the other Nine Hells. Furthermore, during this period it was richly provisioned, furnished, and crammed with centuries worth of baubles, treasures seized by or gifted to Geryon over the course of centuries. These had been plundered before he controlled Stygia during pillaging expeditions where he sought out the most dangerous and wealthy foes. Rather than coinage, his treasures took the form of statues, idols, furniture, tapestries, and unusual or gaudy ornaments (such as a giant gemstone as opposed to tiny, exquisite, and ultimately common ones).\nAfter the rise of Levistus, even during its more anarchic period, Tantlin remained an important trade post, a place where commerce and intrigue came together. The city received many of the souls brought to Stygia by Levistuss fleet. However, the biggest industry for devils in Tantlin after Levistus fully asserted control was paperwork. The scriveners of Tantlin transcribed various books, contracts, magic scrolls and other documentation, taking assignments  from all the other Hells. For the most part these were uncountable numbers of boring reports, but sufficient sifting through the calligraphy workshops might produce a scrap of information genuinely useful to a given investigator.\nTantlin was important even beyond the context of the Nine Hells. The sea surrounding the city contained many drifting, icy, well-guarded portals that linked the Styx to the Prime Material Plane, \nAll of this meant that, despite being deep in the middle of Hell itself, Tantlin was a major cross-planar trading hub that received  traffic from non-devils second only to Dis. However, many among these non-devils were tolerated only if a powerful devil (such as a pit fiend or war devil) guaranteed their safe passage, and most would be forbidden from entering the deeper circles of the City of Ice.\nThere was little shelter in Stygia beyond Tantlin, although even then it didnt protect an extra-planar traveler from the layers cold. It was described as having high stone walls during the rule of Geryon. Ironically its newer, concentric structure made it somewhat vulnerable to attack, since raiders could safely plow through the outer boroughs and retreat upon encounter sufficient resistance.\nThe devils of Stygia were resistant to the cold, and so to them Tantlin (and other Stygian cities) were normal, comfortable environments.\nLurking within the City of Ice was the greatest concentration of amnizu in all the Nine Hells. The lowliest of lemures and bitterest of nupperibos were exiled the the outskirts of the city.\nLevistuss tomb was technically a location within Tantlin, but only when it occupied the harbor and wasnt being caught in currents or lodged in-between icebergs elsewhere in Stygia, which could happen for years at a time. Despite his condition however, Levistus was fully aware of his layer and was capable of enacting his will through telepathy and servitors.\nDuring Geryons reign, Tantlin was more accurately described as his giant castle. Seldom did he leave, for he delighted in battling and hunting lesser devils and intruders throughout its massive, labyrinthine halls or the gravel-strewn mines nearby. While his master was hunting, it fell to his magistrate Herodias to assume command of the citys defenses.\nWhen Geryon was deposed by Asmodeus and Levistus rose to power, Tantlin fell into a state of anarchy due to the leadership of the pit fiend who had taken control of the City of Ice. with her only law being that the strong should survive.\nBecause of this pit fiends \"off-handed\" approach and flexible regimentation, Tantlin was overtaken by motley gangs of assorted baatezu and other evil beings from throughout the planes, each regularly warring and vying for control in an attempt to dispense their own brand of law at each others expense. Each controlled a section of the city and hoped to expand their territory, only refraining from damaging those important to the citys welfare (such as traders or petitioners involved in repairs) for fear of causing the pit fiend to rise up and root them out.\nSo violent did Tantlin become that the dukes of the previous regime (who lived in fiefs outside Tantlin) were encouraged to prove themselves by battling for supremacy in the City of Ice under the watchful eye of the pit fiend, resulting in the death, disappearance, or exile of the great majority of them. With the streets in disarray, the rulers of Stygia dying, and the pit fiend ruler acting as a mad queen, something had to change in Tantlin. The chaos had become so encompassing that Levistuss rivals were questioning his lawful credentials.\nBefore outside criticism reached a crescendo, Levistus reinstated his authority by rewarding the survivors of this period with positions and promotions. His amnizu factorums meanwhile dealt with the one responsible for the citys descent, freezing the unnamed pit fiend of Tantlin was frozen where she stood before she was promptly shattered into a million shards. Her pieces became highly coveted collectibles in Stygia, wearable as pendants to confer strength and endurance (although exposure to above-freezing temperatures would quickly cause them to thaw into gobbets of useless, rotting devil flesh). From there, Tantlins social structure refroze into its more modern form."
