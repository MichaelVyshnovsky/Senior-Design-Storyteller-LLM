        "mainbody": "'''Illefarn''' was an [[elven]] city-state that was founded during the [[First Flowering]] in {{Yearlink|-22900}}, survived the [[Crown Wars]], grew into an expansive nation and later fragmented into smaller realms.",
        "Geography": "Illefarn as a nation at its height stretched along the [[Sword Coast]] from just south of the settlement of [[Illusk]], itself not far south of the [[Spine of the World]], to the River [[Delimbiyr]]. Its capital was [[Aelinthaldaar]] which was built in the shadow of [[Mount Waterdeep]].",
        "Sciences": "Illefarn was renowned as the nation first to have formulated the theory of gravity.",
        "History": {
            "Crown Wars": "Illefarn attempted to remain neutral during the turbulent period of the [[Crown Wars]]. In {{Yearlink|-11800}}, secret safe havens were provided to former [[Miyeritar]]i citizens by elves of Illefarn. Its [[High Mage]]s and [[Cleric|priests]] of [[Corellon]], Illefarn's nobility, began decades of prayer in {{Yearlink|-10110}}, hoping the [[Seldarine]] would intervene and end the [[Ilythiir]] [[Dark elf|dark elves]]' use of fire. Their prayers were answered in {{Yearlink|-10000}}, although the consequences fell on all dark elves, not just the Ilythiiri, who became [[drow]].\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-9900}}, under control of [[House Vyshaan]] and the leadership of [[Coronal]] [[Giilvas Vyshaan]], [[Aryvandaar]] attacked Illefarn and its [[Neverwinter Wood|Llewyrrwood]] colony. They aimed to prevent Illefarn's priests and High Mages from opposing the Aryvandaar court as they had done to the Ilythiir. Aryvandaar slew Illefarn's nobility and annexed its lands. Survivors fled south to join [[Shantel Othreier]], while others settled in the [[Moonshae Isles]] where they became known as the [[Llewyrr]].\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-9200}}, the surviving priests and High Mages came out of hiding to oppose Aryvandaar in the [[Crown Wars#Fifth Crown War|Fifth Crown War]]. Illefarn managed to survive through the fighting, becoming a powerful realm in the aftermath.",
            "The Founding Time": "Despite resistance to several [[orc]] hordes from out of the [[Spine of the World]] mountains, it was the encroachment of humans into Illefarn's territory that spurred Syglaeth Audark, Illefarn's coronal, to call for a retreat to [[Evermeet]], magically razing [[Aelinthaldaar]] in {{Yearlink|-1100}} to remove any proof of its existence.\n\nOver the next seven and a half centuries, many elves abandoned their homes of the last seven millennia and Illefarn's elven population dwindled into three smaller kingdoms: [[Ardeep]], [[Iliyanbruen]], and [[Rilithar]]. After the fall of nearby [[Athalantar]] in the {{YearlinkName|342}}, the elves of Ardeep forged a strong alliance with the dwarves of [[Dardath]] and the two realms kept the name of Illefarn, striving to work with local populations of humans instead of hiding from them. This came to pass less than two centuries later in the {{YearlinkName|523}}, when the \"Illefarn\" elves and dwarves helped to form the realm of [[Phalorm]] after the Council of Axe and Arrow.\n\nApart from scholars, the memory of Illefarn was kept alive by the dwarves of [[Clan Ironeater]], who stubbornly clung to their Illefarn identity centuries after the fall of Phalorm.",
            "Rise of the Empire": "As [[Netheril]] rose, it knew only Illefarn and [[Eaerlann]] among its elven neighbors. Elves of the two nations tried to provide guidance to the [[Netherese]] [[wizard]]s, but the relationship deteriorated. In {{Yearlink|-2825}}, the elves stole a set of ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'', establishing a delicate balance of power among the nations that lasted millennia.",
            "The King of Shadows": "Illefarn was threatened by Netheril. A [[human]] wizard whose name is lost to time volunteered to sacrifice himself to a magical ritual to create an effective deterrent. The Guardian that resulted was a being of pure [[Weave]] magic.\n\nWhen ''[[Karsus's avatar]]'' was cast, the Weave was interrupted momentarily, which would have destroyed the Guardian. It chose to change its power source to the [[Shadow Weave]] and became the [[King of Shadows]]. The Illefarn sent warriors to destroy it, but failed. They then bribed the great dragon [[Nolaloth]]. The King of Shadows struck him down, but was sorely wounded and retreated to the [[Plane of Shadows]].",
            "Fate of the Subrealms": "In the {{YearlinkName|-111}}, a massive orc horde streamed out of the Spine of the World and laid waste to the Kingdom of [[Illusk]] and the hidden city of [[Gauntlgrym]], and ravaged the dwarven empire of [[Delzoun]]. Iliyanbruen, Rillithar and the neighboring elven kingdom of Eaerlann united to finally destroy the horde. They paid a bloody price for their success.\n\nWithin a century, the human dominated realm of Illusk had rebuilt and began to encroach south into Illiyanbruen. War finally erupted in the {{YearlinkName|-11}}, and culminated in an Illuskan defeat at the hands of Lord [[Halueth Never]] the following year. Peace eventually returned in the {{YearlinkName|-4|}}, with the [[River Mirar]] set as the boundary between the two kingdoms.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|152}}, the orcs were once again a serious threat. Elven outposts in the Spine of the World were overwhelmed and Illusk was again overrun. Human refugees began to swamp Iliyanbruen. To halt the tide, the host of Iliyanbruen marched to war against the orcs. In a campaign which lasted over 20 years, the face and nature of Iliyanbruen was changed completely. Within three years after the {{YearlinkName|177}}, Iliyanbruen was gone. Many elves had fallen against the orcs or departed for [[Evermeet]].\n\nWith victory achieved, the few remaining elves under Lord Never settled in Eigersstor, an Illusk refugee settlement, which was renamed [[Neverwinter]] in the Elf Lord's honor.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|342}}, the fall of human-ruled [[Athalantar]] to an orc horde precipitated a hasty alliance between the Stout Folk of [[Dardath]] and the Fair Folk of Ardeep that was made permanent after the last Council of Illefarn was called. The Alliance of Illefarn then began debating allying with the humans of the region against the burgeoning threat of orc hordes rising across the North. However, before that decades-long discussion could reach any form of consensus, King Harnorth II Snowsword and most of the lands of Elembar fell to the Tarnished Tusk horde, which was in turn destroyed while invading the [[House of Stone]] in the {{YearlinkName|511}}. Only the capitol city of [[Delimbiyran_(city)|Delimbiyran]] and the lands immediately bordering it survived the orc horde’s assault.\n\nA dozen years later, in the {{YearlinkName|523}}, the elves of Ardeep and the dwarves of [[Dardath]] invited the humans of the Delimbiyr river valley, the [[gnome]]s of [[Dolblunde]], and displaced [[halfling]]s from [[Mieritin]] (now absorbed into Amn) to the Council of Axe and Arrow at the [[Laughing Hollow]], where [[Phalorm]], Realm of Three Crowns was founded. Javilarhh “the Dark” Snowsword, son of Harnorth II and heir to the throne of Elembar, was crowned King of Delimbiyran, one of Phalorm’s ruling triumvirate.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a small group of [[drow]] [[arachnomancer]]s took over one of the ancient Illefarn ruins, interestingly enough, located in the deep jungles of [[Samarach]] of the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Even though their goal remained a mystery, the drow brought a pack of [[phase spider]]s with them. The creatures were kept in the top levels of the ruins."
