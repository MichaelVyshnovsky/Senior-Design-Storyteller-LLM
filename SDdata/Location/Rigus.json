        "mainbody": "igus was a large gate-town leading to Acheron from the Outlands. \nRigus was more of a military fortress than a town. It was built on a massive hill, divided into seven rings that rose to a pinnacle. Massive octagonal iron battlements and walls separated each ring, as well as the gate-town itself. The uppermost level was called the Crown. Entrance into Rigus was through several gates in the lowest, and largest, ring. The exterior of the lower wall was treated with a mild poison to prevent rust monsters from feeding on it. \nDeep below the fortress, the gate to Acheron was located in a large chamber. The main entrance was at the bottom of a long staircase that connected the Crown to the gate. The gate itself was within an archway made from the bones of various bariaur. The gate was green-yellow in color with a stripe of black down the middle, somewhat resembling the eye of a cat. As such, it was also known as the Lions Gate. \nThe gate-town was ruled by groups called military orders. There were roughly one hundred such groups of various size and strength. Each military order was led by a general, and the generals ruled the city. However, the true source of power in Rigus was found in the Crown. Here, the spirits of former generals remained in a state of half-life, somewhat similar to that of liches. They were the true rulers of Rigus and they gave their orders and commands to the generals of the military order, who obeyed without question.\nThe inhabitants of Rigus were primarily humans and tieflings. Every inhabitant was given a military rank and was expected to respect the military hierarchy and obey anyone with a higher rank without hesitation. When born, an inhabitant was given the rank of citizen. This rank was also given to foreigners. Promotion was given by the Great Generals. Ranks followed a typical military structure, one could be promoted from private, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, and eventually general. Anyone who broke the law, or those taken prisoner during raids, were given the rank of slave-soldier. Disobedience was considered a high crime on par with treason and was punishable by death.\nVisitors were not given a warm welcome. Most who came to Rigus were encouraged to conduct whatever business brought them to the gate-town as quickly as possible. They were given a special plaque made from slate, which indicated they were unfamiliar with the hierarchy and laws of Rigus. This plaque meant that a visitor was not expected to have the same unquestionable obedience as the locals, but they were expected to show respect and obey as much as possible. Disrespectful visitors often had their plaques destroyed, leaving them vulnerable to the strict laws of Rigus, and were usually then taken as a slave-soldier."
