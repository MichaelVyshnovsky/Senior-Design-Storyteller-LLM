'''Pelath's Isle''' was an island in the [[Nelanther Isles]] in the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Description==
This low island had a thin grove of trees, a stone cottage with a garden, and numerous large rooks.

==Rumors & Legends==
Local pirate crews tended to avoid the island because of the old hermit mage, Pelath, who detested pirates and hurled fireballs at ships that got too close around [[1370 DR]].

==Inhabitants==
* [[The Rook Widow]]
* [[Pelath]]
