Pelaths Isle was an island in the Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords.
This low island had a thin grove of trees, a stone cottage with a garden, and numerous large rooks.
Local pirate crews tended to avoid the island because of the old hermit mage, Pelath, who detested pirates and hurled fireballs at ships that got too close around 1370 DR.
