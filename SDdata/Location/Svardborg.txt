'''Svardborg''' was a [[frost giant]] fortress built atop an iceberg in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. After [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] of the [[giant]]s was destroyed, it came under the control of [[Jarl]] [[Storvald]] as he sought to increase the standing of his kin by bringing about the [[Age of Everlasting Ice]] on [[Toril]]. 

==Geography==
It was a completely isolated settlement situated on top of an ice formation that closely resembled the hundreds that surrounded it.

===Features===
The fortress comprised a number of old frost giant hunting lodges, arranged in a circle around a central peak of ice. 

One of the recovered lodges served as a home for the Jarl, another as a barracks for the frost giants,<ref name="SKT-p161>  while the [[Temple of Thrym (Svardborg)|temple of Thrym]] housed a [[white dragon]].<ref name="SKT-p164>

==Defenses==
While the fortress was protected by over a dozen frost giants there were no structural defenses. The giants believed its remote location precluded its discovery. 

==History==
During the age of [[Ostoria]], Svardborg was an isolated frost giant hunting village. When the giant empire fell, the berg on which the settlement was built floated north into the Sea of Moving Ice. The settlement became covered in ice due to the freezing temperatures of the far north. 

Some time later, the mated pair of white dragons, [[Cryovain]] and [[Isendraug]] formed their lair and accompanying nest within Svardborg's temple.

After the destruction of the Ordning by [[Annam All-Father]], Jarl Storvald sailed to Svardborg aboard the ''[[Krigvind]]'' and reclaimed the home of his ancestors. He planned to use the settlement as a base from which he could recover the ''[[Ice that Never Melts]]''.

Just after the giants reclaimed the village, they found a clutch of eggs left by the pair. The giants blackmailed the dragons into servitude, and locked up Isendraug in Svardborg and bound Cryovain to the ''Krigvind''.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Temple of Thrym (Svardborg)|Temple of Thrym]]: The giants' place of worship featured a massive ice-sculpture of the [[titan]] [[Thrym]].  

==Inhabitants==
In addition to its frost giants residents, Svardborg housed their [[giant owl]] and [[winter wolf]] pets, along with the [[northlander]]s, [[yeti]]s and the white dragon they kept as slaves. 

===Notable Inhabitants===
* The frost giant Jarl Storvald
* The mated white dragons Isendraug
* The [[Zhentarim]] [[mage]] [[Nilraun Dhaerlost]]
