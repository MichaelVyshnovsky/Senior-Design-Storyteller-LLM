The '''Gond Gate''' was a gate and local landmark in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was located in the region of the Old Wall that separated the [[Temples District]] in the [[Upper City]] from [[the Steeps]] in the [[Lower City]].

The Gond Gate was one of the city's "[[patriar]] gates", four well-controlled entrances that connected the Lower City and Upper City regions. These gates were typically only accessible to select individuals, such as the city's wealthy patriar, those persons bearing their livery, or certain criminal [[Kingpin]]s.
