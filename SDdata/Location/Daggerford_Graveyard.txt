Daggerford Graveyard was the main plot of land used by the city of Daggerford, located in the Eastern Farmlands outside of the city walls.
The Graveyard was located just a couple of hours outside Daggerford by foot, across from a lush apple orchard. The gated land was protected by a stone hedge and held a wide variety of mossy headstone, lichen-covered sarcophagi, monuments, obelisks, chest tombs, and several crypts. The mortuary and a mausoleum stood in the center of the Graveyard. Patches of daisies sporadically grew throughout the land as well as two other cheerfully colored flower types, orange, and pink.
A cobblestone path ran between the orchard and the Graveyard towards the watermill that was one of the major food sources for Daggerford.
In 1372 DR, Elveronne Bricket, a member of a wealthy Brickett family of Daggerford, was quickly embalmed and interred in the Brickett family tomb after suffering from a sudden and deadly food poisoning, outlived by his two lovely sisters, Alicine and Muriel Bricket. The service cost the sisters a whooping five hundred gp. Soon after the ceremony, however, the old mans body mysteriously disappeared from the crypt leaving the mortician, Moris Olgrund baffled and at a loss. Moris was a devote follower of Kelemvor as suspected vile necromancy. He asked the Hero of Daggerford to track the missing corpse and return it to the crypt or take care of the evil being that stole the dead. The truth, however, was more bizarre than simple ghouls and wizards, Elveronne Brickets sarcophagus showed the signs of the man breaking out and shuffling away from the Graveyard.
At almost the exact center of the Graveyard stood its main and biggest structure. It was an old mausoleum, converted into the mortuary of Daggerford. The interior of the mortuary consisted of a large hallway that led to a round chamber that held the front desk and three doors. Across from the entrance, the central door led to a storage area, where the mortician kept tombstones, coffins, barely of supplies, and empty chest tombs. The right-hand door opened to the morticians workspace where the bodies were prepared for the burial, embalmed, and finished with two gold coins placed on the bodies eyes as per the local tradition. The door to the left led to the morticians office, filled with books and records and one sturdy wooden work desk.
Bricket family crypt was located to the east from the mortuary mausoleum and was one of the bigger subterranean tombs circa 1372 DR.
Several of the gravestones found in the Daggerford Graveyard held amusing messages with the names of the graves occupants lost to time, such as
*"Was afraid of the dark with good reason."
*"Dont sit on me."
*"Id rather be cremated."
*"Lets not mince words - Boo!"
Apart from Moris Olgrund, the funeral director and mortician of the Graveyard circa 1372 DR, the Graveyard held numerous deceased citizens of Daggerford. Among some of the people buried there were defenders and guard of Daggerford Sergeant Johnston, Captain Yulis, as well as regular citizens including Trant Mariss, Alan the adventurer, Olavi, and Alex.
