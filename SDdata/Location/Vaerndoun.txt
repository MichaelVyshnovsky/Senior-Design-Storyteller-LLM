'''Vaerndoun''' was a network of interconnected caves in the [[Underdark]].

==Geography==
Vaerndoun stretched for over 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast to southwest with the center point directly under the city of [[Torsch]]. Many, but not all, of the caves were filled with water, forming lakes.

==Activities==
Vaerndoun was the site of a two-week trade fair at the beginning of [[Alturiak]] every year. It was hosted by [[mind flayer]]s who referred to themselves as, and claimed to be from, a hidden realm called "the [[Asglyth]]". The fair, called the "Eleave" in the [[drow]] tongue, was visited by agents from all over the Underdark as long as they provided the admission price of slaves for the illithid to feed on.

==History==
The traveling merchant [[Rebrum]] of [[Sheirtalar]] wrote in the ''[[Life of Rebrum]]'' (written ''circa'' [[1210 DR]]) of an appearance of the ''[[Chanting Chain]]'', a holy relic of [[Talos]] the Destroyer, at the Eleave. A group of [[drow]] traders, sent by their matrons, attempted to barter the ''Chain'' to another group of drow from a distant city. However, the ''Chain'' likely fell into the hands of one of the Asglyth mind flayers.
