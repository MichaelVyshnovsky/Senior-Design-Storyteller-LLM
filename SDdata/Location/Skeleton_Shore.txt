The Skeleton Shore was a coast line along the Dragonmere in the Dragon Coast.
The shore ran from Teziir in the west all the way to Westgate.
The most notable feature of the Skeleton Shore were the Cliffs of Karthaut, This seemingly innocuous tower was the domain of Aeroth, a Wearer of Purple for the Cult of the Dragon, and the lair of the green wyrmling Eldrisithain.
