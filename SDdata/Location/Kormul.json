        "mainbody": "Kormul was a village in the Shaar in southwest Faerûn by the mid–14 century DR. By the late 15 century DR, it had grown and was known as the City of Cults.\nKormul was a trading settlement much reduced in size, judging by the volcanic stone ruins in the northwest and southeast sections of it, but it was still larger than it was in the late 14 century. People still inhabited these ruined sections, using them to support shacks and huts. More centrally located buildings were, in part, constructed using some of the more easily lootable stones from those selfsame ruins.\nKormul was located in the Channath Vale at a major crossroads at the southern end of Lake Lhespen, north and east of the foothills of the Wormbones mountain range.\nThe city was ruled by the Harlord, an intelligent and ruthless, but most importantly loyal, puppet ruler, installed by the local drow and yuan-ti traders. The last noted Harlord was Vespraele Irontusk, who came to power after her predecessor was killed in 1456 DR. The Harlord collected taxes on all transactions involving drugs, poisons, and spices, and commanded the Ward Swords mercenary company.\nSitting at the crossroads of three major roads that connected the cities of Sheirtalar, Shaarmid, and Eartheart, Kormul was a bustling trading center. Though by day gangs fought wars in the alleys of the city, brisk trade was done at the same time. Most trade, though, was done after the sun went down, when the drow and yuan-ti emerged.\nMost of the trade done in the city was in salt and spices, but drugs and poisons were also major trade goods. One could also trade in metals, woods, gemstones, wine, and grain get money lent and changed purchase the services of mercenaries and buy or sell information.\nThe community would cater to large numbers of Akadian pilgrims traveling to Blaskaltar during each Midsummer.\nKormuls walls did not have gates, so no physical barrier was in place to prevent entry. Individual mercenaries in the city were well-equipped, but only the Ward Swords actively worked for the city and even then, mostly as tax collectors. There were at least seven entrances to the Underdark in the cellars of the citys buildings.\nKormul was originally part of the Shoon Imperium, but successfully revolted against the local Shoon garrisons in the , along with six other neighboring settlements. The Imperium responded with overwhelming, brutal force when Qayadin Hakam yn Sarak el Sallah razed all seven settlements to the ground in the Seven Burnings campaign.\nKormul was re-founded sometime in the 9 century Dale Reckoning. In the , Kormul was the site of the Struggle of Storms which saw the Storm Prophet Tothur kill, and be slain by, over forty high priests of Talos in an effort to challenge the established hierarchy of the Talassan church.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, trade routes around Kormul came under attack, forcing the town to consider mobilizing an army. The route to the south was menaced by gnolls from the Wyrmbones led by a chieftain known as the Wyrm Master while the route to Shaarmid was threatened by yuan-ti from the Lhespenbog.\nAt some point, several beast cults, beholder cults, yuan-ti cults, and dragon cults began to proliferate in Kormul. Superstitious traders, believing that their joining these cults would give them an edge in business, swelled their numbers. As a result, many of the cults became impromptu banks, inns and apothecaries for caravaners who passed through town.\nIn the , the brown dragon Belathellar, who was venerated by one of Kormuls largest dragon cults known as the Penitent of Belathellar, was killed by another dragon named Velauthlusglar. The Penitent of Belathellar believed that Belathellar needed to die in order to ascend to godhood, and continued to worship him afterward.\n* The Harlhouse was a decrepit mansion, and the residence of the Harlord and their ten personal bodyguards. It was situated above the city jail.\n* The Flantard was an adventurers clubhouse. Most of the patrons were human.\n* Vorulphs Barrelworks was another club, built atop a coopers shop.\nMembers of all of the humanoid races could be found somewhere in Kormul, with the majority of them being human, but with significant minorities of other peoples. Loxo and wemics made up the majority of the daytime traders, while humans made up the majority of the gangs, who fought each other in the streets. Large numbers of the citizenry were criminals and outcasts, and many were disfigured as well.\nYuan-ti, known locally as Scaly Ones, slitherers, scalies, and shedders (the last two terms were considered pejorative), spent their days basking in the sun at their three- or four-story sunwell tower residences before setting out to trade in heated buildings by night. Drow ventured up to the city each night from their Underdark bases as well. These two groups held the most power in the city, but maintained an uneasy truce, owing to the drow having concocted a poison that effectively and swiftly killed even the poison-resistant yuan-ti. Drow were known locally as the Darkfolk, the Dark Ones, and Night Ears (the last term was considered pejorative).\n* Belorghal Orbreth was a mutant four-armed orc with a prominent vertical scar down the middle of his face. He and his band of orc bodyguards were hired as enforcers to threaten folk who needed threatening, but Belorghal also did brisk trade as an armorsmith.\n* The Marahuud was a bizarre individual who could either change their shape or switch places with other beings who shared the same identity. Even Elminster hadnt managed to figure out which circumstance was true. They were a money changer, loan shark, and trader who had survived many attempts on their life from both the drow and the yuan-ti.\n* Sarindra Doomhand was a mind flayer wizard, disguised as a human woman, who sold her spellcasting services, as well as spell scrolls, mostly to adventurers.\n* Tirlagar Tathalore was a Harper agent assigned to Kormul. Everybody who was anybody knew that he was a Harper, but he was left alone because of his perceived lack of subtlety and public drunkenness. This was all a ruse however—the drunkenness was an act, as were his poor spying skills, so he could cover up the activities of other Harper spies.\n* Vespraele Irontusk was a half-orc, most recently ascended to the seat of The Harlord. Although seven feet tall, very muscular, and possessing prominent tusks, she was noted as a particularly beautiful woman. Her rule was popular, as she didnt interfere in the citys goings-on except in the most obvious and disruptive breaking of Kormuls few laws, which she responded to with speedy and ruthless punishment."
