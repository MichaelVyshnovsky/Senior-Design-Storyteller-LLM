        "mainbody": "Patayang was a town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra. It stood by the western frontier, near the border with Tu Lung and the Warring States, and was one of the kingdoms remotest settlements in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nDespite its isolation and not having a decent temple by Kuong standards, Patayang was a valuable supplier of gemstones to the kingdom. These it traded through Gapapurang to Ranguri, the Kuong capital.\nSeeking more riches, many adventurers explored the jungles surrounding Patayang. Most only fell prey to the carnivorous jungle apes."
