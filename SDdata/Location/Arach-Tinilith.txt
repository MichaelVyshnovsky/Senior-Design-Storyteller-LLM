Arach-Tinilith was the clerical school in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. Like the rest of the Academy, it was located in Tier Breche.
The complex -- the largest of the Academy -- was located on the northern side of the Tier Breche cavern and was shaped like a spider. The "cephalothorax" of the spider housed the grandest chapels, the holiest altars, and the quarters of the senior priestesses. The crowning gem of the complex was the main chapel, carved from a single mass of black stone. Inside, seats surrounded a circular platform that held a statue of a spider with the head of a drow female.

The Mistress of the academy had an office on the highest level that had a tapestry depicting Lolth looming over a sacrificed surface elf.
There were dungeon-like kitchens located in the lower levels. Slaves, such as the ogre slave Chirank in 1361 DR, were employed there.
A small library was located somewhere in the complex.
Arach-Tinilith was founded as part of Tier Breche, Menzoberranzans educational institution as House Ssrils literal last act, in order to standardize Lolths teachings and produce clerics of any meaningful quality. House Ssril was one of Menzoberranzans founding Houses, though a total lack of heirs and inheritors led to the houses extinction. Before the founding, it was normal in Menzoberranzan for each House to teach only their own children. House Ssril, seeing that this practice led to numerous different interpretations of Lolths teachings, believed that the founding of Arach-Tinilith would increase the quality of clerics and divine spell casters in Menzoberranzan.
