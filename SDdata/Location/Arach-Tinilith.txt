Arach-Tinilith was the clerical school in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. Like the rest of the Academy, it was located in Tier Breche.
The complex -- the largest of the Academy -- was located on the northern side of the Tier Breche cavern and was shaped like a spider. The "cephalothorax" of the spider housed the grandest chapels, the holiest altars, and the quarters of the senior priestesses. The crowning gem of the complex was the main chapel, carved from a single mass of black stone. Inside, seats surrounded a circular platform that held a statue of a spider with the head of a drow female.

The Mistress of the academy had an office on the highest level that had a tapestry depicting Lolth looming over a sacrificed surface elf.
There were dungeon-like kitchens located in the lower levels. Slaves, such as the ogre slave Chirank in 1361 DR, were employed there.
A small library was located somewhere in the complex.
Arach-Tinilith was founded as part of Tier Breche, Menzoberranzans educational institution as House Ssrils literal last act, in order to standardize Lolths teachings and produce clerics of any meaningful quality. House Ssril was one of Menzoberranzans founding Houses, though a total lack of heirs and inheritors led to the houses extinction. Before the founding, it was normal in Menzoberranzan for each House to teach only their own children. House Ssril, seeing that this practice led to numerous different interpretations of Lolths teachings, believed that the founding of Arach-Tinilith would increase the quality of clerics and divine spell casters in Menzoberranzan.

In 1372 DR, the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, Quenthel Baenre, was attacked at the school by a number of demons intending to assassinate her. A number of novice priestesses and even instructors led by Drisinil Barrison DelArmgo believed that Quenthel had lost the favor of Lolth, and thus they planned to murder her. Quenthel discovered their plot and summoned hordes of spiders to kill them and demonstrate that she was in her goddesss favor (although that was during the Silence of Lolth). In truth, unbeknownst to her, the demons had been sent by her brother, Gromph Baenre, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan.
In 1469 DR, members of the Jaezred Chaulssin infiltrated and tampered with the graduation ceremony. It caused a large number of demons to be summoned, who then ran amok causing heavy damage, not only to the temples structure but also in a lot of lives. 
Most new priestesses (called novices) had to share rooms with one or two others until the fifth year (although Liriel Baenre was able to secure her own room). Novices wore black robes with red trim.
Each day ended in the chapel in prayer and praise of Lolth.
Priestesses received training in weapons combat from older students of Melee-Magthere.
All female, the priestesses of Lolth went to Arach-Tinilith after being trained by their houses in the basics of worship of the Spider Queen. This usually happened around the age of 40, and they were to spend 50 years studying under the tutelage of the mistresses there. By 1361 DR, it appeared priestesses were expected to enter Arach-Tinilith by age 25. The priestess Dabnay Trarach, however, entered the academy at age 35.
Priestesses provided religious instruction to other students of the Academy.
It was a crime for males to enter Arach-Tinilith unsummoned.
