The Assad Bazaar, or Lion Bazaar, was a marketplace found within the Court District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
This bazaar derived its name because it faced a monument of an old hero of Huzuz named Assad al-Assad.
A  sandstone carving called the Assad Head could be found in the bazaar.
The activity within the Assad Bazaar paled in comparison to the bustle of the Grand Bazaar. Prices here were much steeper as well considering it catered to the wealthy inhabitants of the Court District.
