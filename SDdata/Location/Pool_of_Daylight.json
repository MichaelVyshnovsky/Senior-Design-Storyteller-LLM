        "mainbody": "The Pool of Daylight was a pool of liquid that glowed with radiant energy as bright as a sun. It was hidden away in a chamber in the depths of the Temple of Filth in Evernight on the Shadowfell.\nIt was said that an immensely powerful artifact lay within the Pool of Daylight which had the ability to annihilate undead creatures by the hundreds.\nThe light of the radiant pool was enough to cause crippling pain to any undead who entered it chamber. Touching the liquid would instantly destroy lesser undead, including weaker ghouls and vampires.\nThe Pool was protected by the ghouls of the Temple of Filth, and was locked behind cursed and trapped doors deep within that Temple. It was kept shrouded by rituals of darkness.\nThe truth of what lay in the Pool of Daylight was known only to the priests and the Tribunal of Evernight. They claimed that a powerful artifact was stored there to keep it out of the hands of Evernights enemies, but also to hold it in reserve if they ever needed a doomsday weapon. As of the , the mere threat of this artifact was used to dissuade the Thayans from trying to conquer the city, although this was largely unnecessary because the Thayans were satisfied with their arrangements within the city."
