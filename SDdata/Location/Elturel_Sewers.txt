The sewers of Elturel were a sanitation system of brick tunnels beneath the city of Elturel.
* The Dwarfs Pot Inn had a hidden entrance to the sewers in its cellar. This had been constructed by the inns owner, Algaroz, and his friend Pinch. On the sewer side of things, this entrance was marked by a jagged gap in the brick casing of a sewer wall. Fortunately the air  within the inn was typically so thick with the smells of wood smoke, stale ale, and spiced stew that the odor of the sewers was rarely ever noticed.
During his years as a thief on the streets of Elturel, Pinch and his gang of rogues frequently navigated the city through use of the sewers, with his companion Sprite-Heels having memorized many of the twisting tunnels to the best of his abilities.
Early 15 century DR, Elturel was among the cities whose sewers were significantly expanded and improved upon by the gnome Joster Barbellow.
