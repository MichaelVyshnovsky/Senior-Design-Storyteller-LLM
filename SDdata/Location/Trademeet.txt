'''Trademeet''', also known as the '''City of Merchant's Peace''', was a settlement in [[Amn]] and the smallest of the region's caravan stops. Due to the [[Merchant's Peace]], all commerce in Trademeet was bound to be carried out honestly and fairly.

==Geography==
Trademeet was located between the [[Forest of Tethir|Forest of Tethir/Wealdath]] to the south and the [[Small Teeth]] mountains to the north. It was generally considered part of the Small Teeth region of Amn.

==Trade==
Trademeet was primarily a caravan stop, with a few agricultural products produced by the estates surrounding the town.

The [[Trade Way]] passed north-south through Trademeet, connecting it to [[Imnescar]] and eventually [[Baldur's Gate]] in the north and [[Mosstone]] and eventually [[Zazesspur]] in the south. The [[Tethir Road]] led west to [[Murann]] on the coast and east to [[Riatavin]] and the [[Snowflake Mountains]].

==Description==
Trademeet was a small town centered around [[Waukeen's Circle]], a prehistoric circle of seven upright stone slabs.

==History==
In [[223 DR]], Trademeet was established as the caravan mustering point for Amn and Tethyr.

In [[661 DR]], [[ogre]]s from the [[Cloud Peaks]] and [[Small Teeth]] ransacked Trademeet and neighboring [[Imnescar]]. They were eventually defeated and turned away by the forces of General [[Rashturl]].

On [[Shieldmeet]] of [[920 DR]], [[Waukeen]] appeared in Trademeet and established the [[Merchant's Peace]] after she saw the dishonesty and bickering of the caravan hub.

In [[1369 DR]], Trademeet was plagued by animal attacks. In [[Uktar]] of that year, exiles from [[Tethyr]] (namely the [[Krimmevol]] family from [[Ithmong]]) arrived in Trademeet before moving elsewhere in Amn.

On [[Eleasis 19]], [[1370 DR]], Trademeet was ransacked by the ogre forces of the [[Sythillisian Empire]]. Much of the town was burned to the ground. More than 60% of the population was killed.

==Organizations==
The [[Seas's Sect]] of the [[Shadow Thieves]] guild was active in Trademeet, as well as in Imnescar, Murann, Velen, and other locations.

==Notable locations==
