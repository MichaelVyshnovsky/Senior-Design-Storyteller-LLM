        "mainbody": "Golden was a village in the land of Koryo in Kara-Tur.The descriptions of magical shuriken called stars of Ojy-do in Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2 refer to the village of Golden. Although the games are primarily set in northwest Faer√ªn, it is not known where Golden lies. Ojy-do, however, is a city in Koryo, and the Fangs of Night ninja there are known for their Throwing Stars of Ojy-do, but these have very different powers. Given the similarity and oriental theme, this article assumes that Golden lies in Koryo near Ojy-do.\nLong before the 14th century DR, the village of Golden was once besieged by bandits and the villagers were forced to defend themselves. The spiritual guide Ojy was pressed into work as a weaponsmith, though he knew little of metalworking. With every accurate strike of his hammer, he thanked his guiding spirits, and so the stars of Ojy-do were forged from the strength of his faith. He also crafted other weapons, and with his creations, the villagers fought back."
