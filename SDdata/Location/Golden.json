Although the games are primarily set in [[northwest Faerûn]], it is not known where Golden lies. [[Ojy-do]], however, is a city in Koryo, and the [[Fangs of Night]] [[ninja]] there are known for their ''[[Throwing Stars of Ojy-do]]'', but these have very different powers. Given the similarity and oriental theme, this article assumes that Golden lies in Koryo near Ojy-do.",
        "History": "Long before the 14th century [[DR]], the village of Golden was once besieged by bandits and the villagers were forced to defend themselves. The spiritual guide [[Ojy]] was pressed into work as a weaponsmith, though he knew little of metalworking. With every accurate strike of his hammer, he thanked his guiding spirits, and so the ''[[stars of Ojy-do]]'' were forged from the strength of his faith. He also crafted other weapons, and with his creations, the villagers fought back."
