'''Saelmur''' was a city-state in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faerûn]], on the northern shores of the [[Lake of Steam]].

==Geography==
The city-state was sat in a natural bay in the Lake of Steam, rising upwards to the crests of four hills, which were capped with various columns, towers, and spires.

==Government==
The city-state was ruled by the [[Councilium of Prelates]], a governing council made up of the [[high priest]]s of Saelmur's seven largest faiths &ndash; [[Chauntea]], [[Helm]], [[Ilmater]], [[Lathander]], [[Oghma]], [[Torm]], and [[Tyr]].

==Trade==
Saelmur produced a variety of fruits and vegetables from the fields and orchards around the city, though as a port city it also produced a great deal of seafood. It produced a variety of different minerals, including [[salt]], [[sulfur]] and the magical [[zardazil]]. Other products of the city-state included [[dye]]s and [[ink]]s.

In the late 14{{th}} century DR, as the city housed an influx of refugees from Mintar, many of its equipment shops were poorly stocked as demands for all manner of items skyrocketed. Expensive items could be ordered, but the wait for them was often weeks long.

==Defenses==
The armed forces of Saelmur were the [[Bresmer (organization)|Bresmer]], who numbered 3,000 by 1370 DR. They patrolled the city, the tent city outside its walls, and the neighboring vegetable fields and orchards.
===Crime===
Saelmur was typically so well managed by the Councilium that [[thieves' guild]] would be uncovered and broken up by the Besmer before they could fully form. However, some criminals managed to take advantage of the city's strained resources in 1370 DR. The strongest of the groups to take a foothold were the [[Scarlet Throats]], who made most of their money by running a very lucrative black market.

==History==
''Circa'' [[-5100 DR]], Saelmur began life as one of many garrisoned fortresses that were established by the armies of the [[First Kingdom of Mir]]. Sometime in the 25 years following the Mirran army's defeat at the hands of [[Jhaamdath]] in {{Yearlink|-5032}}, on the plains north of the tiny fishing town of Ankhapur, Saelmur along with the other Mirran fortresses were overtaken by the Jhaamdathan army as they pushed the Mirrans all the way back to garrisons at [[Saradush|Fort Saradush]].

In {{Yearlink|-5007}}, after a year long siege on their eastern fronts, the leaders of Mir and [[Coramshan]] came together for negotiation and came to conclude that only unification of their states would ensure their survival against Jhaamdath. United under the rulership of [[Ukhar IV]], the Coramshite-Mirran army unleashed a devastating counterattack against the Jhaamdathans and within two months pushed them all the way back to Saelmur. The fighting continued on into {{Yearlink|-5003}}, with Jhaamdath losing Saelmur. Eventually a truce was reached between the two nations, with the promise that both would abandon any claims over the Land of the Lions, leaving Saelmur and others in the region independent.

In the {{YearlinkName|755}}, Saelmur was struck by the [[Crimson Death (plague)|Crimson Death]] and lost 16% of its population from the plague.

Centuries later, during the [[Eighth Age of Calimshan]], Ankhapur tried to convince Saelmur and their neighbor Mintar to unite into a single country. However, these efforts failed for a multitude of regions, such as the general preference among Arnadens for local governance and independence, trade dis-agreements, and difficulties with defenses.

Over the centuries it developed a reputation as being one of the cleanest cities along the Lake of Steam.

Migrant workers from Saelmur, among other places, went to join in the construction of the canal that Innarlith was building between the [[Lake of Steam]] and the [[Nagaflow]] in the mid-1360s DR. This project was widely seen as bringing much lucrative trade to the Lake of Steam region, because it would have connected the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the oceans of [[Toril]] through the Lake of Steam. When Innarlith's Ransar [[Salatis]] started to find excuses to cut funding for the project, Saelmur paid for its own workers to continue their work on the site.

In the years following Mintar's takeover by [[Teldorn Darkhope]] and his [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]] in [[1362 DR]],{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|?}} many fled east from the city-state to seek refuge in Saelmur.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals Under the Black Gauntlet}} Refugees packed the city's many inns and boarding houses, As the city grew too overcrowded to house further refugees, a [[tent]] city was erected outside its western walls. With Saelmur's population pushed beyond expected parameters its [[sewer system]] grew overwhelmed, leaving the once "cleanest city on the lake" to be dirty, smelly, and smoky.

In [[1369 DR]], as Mintar was faced with uprisings and strikes, Saelmar bolstered its defenses.

By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the high priests of Helm, Lathander, Torm and Tyr &ndash; [[Genas Stoutshield]], [[Santan Argath]], [[Athelstan Meiados]], and [[Thallon Geiros]] respectively &ndash; were in agreement that it was high time Saelmur fought Mintar and liberated it from the [[Church of Bane]]. And many [[mercenaries]] and sellswords made their way to Saelmur in hopes of being hired by the Councilium for this anticipated war, however, the cost of feeding and housing so many people taxed the city-state's coffers, making it difficult for Saelmur to pursue its aims of raising an army. And the churches were locked in debate over how best to deal with the Banite threat.

Thallon and others argued that Saelmur only stood a chance against Mintar if they could convince others to join them in the fray, such as the nations of [[Tethyr]] particularly the [[Ala-min]]. Athelstan, however, grew increasingly impatient and threatened in multiple Councilium meetings to rally his Tormtar forces alone against the Banites.

In [[1372 DR]], though the churches were still locked in debate, Saelmar was working to organize a mutual-defense pact against Banite attacks with the other city-states in the Land of the Lions. The next year, in the midst of [[Sammaster]]'s [[Rage of Dragons]], the [[red dragon|red]] [[great wyrm]] [[Balagos]] flew over the Land of the Lions and unleashed a firestorm in Mintar and Saelmur, killing over half of the population of both city-states.<ref>

==Notable Locations==
* The Central Market.
* The [[Needle in the Loft]], a makeshift boarding house for refugees.
* [[The Knave's Nape]], a high-class inn.
* [[Master of the Blade]], a school of swordsmanship.
===Religious===
* [[Guardian Hall]], a Helmite temple.
* The [[Hall of High Justice]], a Tyrran temple.In ''[[Dragons of Faerûn]]'' it is stated that (as of 1373 DR) the horde of the [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]] contained the "...onion dome of Anachtyr (gilded dome wrested from the top of a since-fallen temple in Saelmur...)". This implies that Tyr was worshiped in Saelmur under his aspect [[Anachtyr]], though whether this referred to the Hall of High Justice or a preceding temple is unclear.
* The [[Lady's Sheaves]], a Chauntean temple.
* The [[Library of High Justice]], an Oghmanyte temple.
* The [[Shrine of Duty]], a Tormtar temple.
* The [[Shrine of the Rising Sun]], a Lathanderite temple.
* The [[Temple of the Bound Hands]], an Ilmatari temple.

==Inhabitants==
The majority of the city-state's population was made up of [[human]]s, due in part to the influx of Mintaran refugees. It also long had a sizable number of [[mage]]s, even prior to the Banite takeover of Mintar, due to the great access to mineral substance derived spell components. Many Mintaran mages made their home in Saelmar, hoping to one day return to the city-state.

Saelmar was also among the settlements in the Land of the Lions that the Shadi'ar tribes visited at least once a year, with their younger warriors taking the opportunity to indulge in city luxuries.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* The [[alchemist]] [[Surero]] fled here from [[Innarlith]] in the mid-1360s DR after he was excused for his attempt to murder the clandestine [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]].
