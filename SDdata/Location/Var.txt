|destroyed=1385 DR (Spellplague induced submergence)Var, or more commonly known as Var the Golden was one of the three Shining Lands surrounding the Golden Water in southeast Faerûn and the most surrounded by water. After the Spellplague in 1385 DR, it was the only of the three to be destroyed and it was then known as Var the Drowned.
Its name came from huge quantities of wheat fields found throughout the land.
This land was once known for its vast wheat fields, but in 1385 DR the Spellplague came, and Var the Golden sank beneath the waves. By 1479 DR, this area was a drowned land of silt-covered fields and ruined towns and villages. The ruins were stalked by its insane former ruler, Anwir Dupretiskava.
The capital was Pyratar. The city of Zelpir was a famed crafts spot. The "mouth" linking Var to the Great Sea was the Sunstrait through the city Myrmyr. The Isle of Ships resided to Vars northeast. The city of Vaelen beyond Vars most northwest hosted a Shou Town. The Curna Mountains isolated most of Var from the lands of Southeast Faerûn.
Other locations were Des and Durgach.
