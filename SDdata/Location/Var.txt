|destroyed=[[1385 DR]] ([[Spellplague]] induced submergence)}}'''Var''', or more commonly known as '''Var the Golden''' was one of the three [[Shining Lands]] surrounding the [[Golden Water]] in [[southeast Faerûn]] and the most surrounded by water.<ref> After the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], it was the only of the three to be destroyed and it was then known as '''Var the Drowned'''.

==Name==
Its name came from huge quantities of wheat fields found throughout the land.

==Geography==
This land was once known for its vast wheat fields, but in 1385 DR the Spellplague came, and Var the Golden sank beneath the waves. By [[1479 DR]], this area was a drowned land of silt-covered fields and ruined towns and villages. The ruins were stalked by its insane former ruler, [[Anwir Dupretiskava]].

==Locations==
The capital was [[Pyratar]]. The city of [[Zelpir]] was a famed crafts spot. The "mouth" linking Var to the [[Great Sea]] was the [[Sunstrait]] through the city [[Myrmyr]]. The [[Ship Isle|Isle of Ships]] resided to Var's northeast. The city of [[Vaelen]] beyond Var's most northwest hosted a [[Shou]] Town. The [[Curna Mountains]] isolated most of Var from the lands of [[Southeast Faerûn]].<ref>{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Eastern Classes}}
