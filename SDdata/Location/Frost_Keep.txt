'''Frost Keep''' was a [[frost giant]] fortress located in the [[Frozenfar]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Description==
The Frost Keep, as per its name, was constructed from glacial frost and ice.

==Geography==
The fort was situated to the north of the [[Ice Lakes]] and just south of the [[Spine of the World]]. To the southeast of Frost Keep was [[Raven Rock]], an [[ancestral mound]] to the [[Uthgardt]] people. [[Black Raven River]] flowed close-by the keep.

==History==
As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[human]]s of the [[Savage Frontier]] had been attempting to overtake the fortress for decades. However, the frost giants had successfully defended Frost Keep. They were known to disrupt trade caravans along the [[Northern Means]] to the southwest. As well as selling the stolen wares and using the [[magic]] to empower themselves, they would cook and eat the tradesmen as well as their animals.

==Inhabitants==
The fort was inhabited by seventeen frost giants, one of which was a powerful leader that commanded the others.
