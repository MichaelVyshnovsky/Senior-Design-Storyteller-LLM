        "mainbody": "he Frozenfar was the coldest, most remote region of the North. It comprised the Spine of the World mountains the frigid lands to the north and west including Icewind Dale, the Cold Run, the icebergs of the Sea of Moving Ice, and the northeasternmost part of the Trackless Sea.While The North Guide to the Savage Frontier includes the islands of Purple Rocks and Gundarlun within the Frozenfar section, their status as sub-arctic isles (and their latitude) is inconsistent with the in-text description of the Frozenfar in various sources. Additionally, they are not included within the broad categories of the Frozenfar section of the more recent sourcebook, the Legacy of the Crystal Shard.\nThe Frozenfar did not have definable boundaries. The term \"Frozenfar\" was used by people across Faerûn to include various areas. For example in Amn and the Inner Sea, the term \"Frozenfar\" referred to the city of Mirabar and everything north, including the Spine of the World mountains. Sometimes the term \"Frozenfar\" also included the island of Ruathym.\nHowever in the North, the term \"Frozenfar\" referred only to the lands north of the Spine of the World.\nYet others used \"Frozenfar\" to refer to all the lands of the North within which individuals could literally freeze to death during their travels.\nThe Frozenfar reached the northern peaks of the Spine of the World and extended northwest through the Sea of Moving Ice. It stretched as far east as the Reghed Glacier.\nThe Cold Run encompassed the icy tundras west of the Iron Trail and extended all the way to the Sword Coast. It was bordered to the south by the Iceflow river, and to the north by the Shaengarne.\n* Fireshear Vale, a deep chasm and adjoining crater whose origins were debated by the sages of Faerûn.\n* Ironmaster Vale, the valley of dwarves that barred the entrance of any but their own kind within.\n* Auckney, an impoverished town of farmers that received few visitors and even fewer ships from the other towns of the North.\n* Fireshear, a port city run by a trio of merchants that had financial holdings in the cities of Mirabar, Neverwinter and Waterdeep.\n* Ironmaster, a mining city founded and run by dwarves that had tunnels that went deep beneath the Frozenfar.\nthumb|right|300px|An aerial view of Icewind Dale and Kelvins Cairn.\nThe tundra of Icewind Dale was named after the freezing winds and snowstorms that blew down from the mountain of Kelvins Cairn.\n* Dwarven Valley, a sprawling valley that was home to the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer.\n* Kelvins Cairn, the massive lone mountain of the dale that according to legend, comrpised stones piled atop the resting place of the frost giant Kelvin.\n* Lac Dinneshere, a lake of tranquil waters that allowed locals to glean insight about upcoming lulls and storms.\n* Maer Dualdon, the largest and deepest of the dales three lakes.\n* Shaengarne, the icy river flowed down from Maer Dualdon into the Sea of Moving Ice.\n* Redwaters, the smallest lake of the dale that earned its name from a bloody battle that erupted between two of the nearby towns.\n* Ten Towns, a confederacy that comprised nine smaller settlements situated around the dales three lakes, along with the mercantile hub of Bryn Shander.\nThe northeast of the Trackless Sea bordered the Sea of Moving Ice. This was immediately west of the Cold Run and was considered to be part of the Frozenfar.\n* Ice Peak Island, a frozen isle located just off the coast of the Cold Run, Bjorns Hold,\nthumb|right|250px|A large iceberg in the Sea of Moving Ice.\nThe waters north of the Cold Run and west of Icewind Dale were densely filled with hundreds of shifting icebergs and a number of frozen isles. It was sparsely populated and accommodated only a handful of landmarks and few inhabitants, like ice trolls and tribes of Ice Hunters. \n* Revels End, a prison used for the most devious individuals that committed crimes against the Lords Alliance.\n* Tower of the Ice Witch, the sanctuary of the Ice Witch of Auril was constructed from black ice that held residual magic from the Crenshinibon.\n* Svardborg, and old frost giant village that was abandoned for many years before being reclaimed by Jarl Storvald.\nthumb|right|300px|The Spine of the World peaks were a breathtaking sight to behold, and imposing to traverse.\nBy most accounts, the Spine of the World mountains encompassed the southern reaches of the Frozenfar, separating the whole of the region from the warmer lands to the south.\n* Frost Hills, rugged hills were found on the southern stretch of the Spine of the World. \n* Hundelstone, a community of dwarves and gnomes that was located in the mountains on the Ten Trail.\n* Karkolohk, a goblin prison-fortress led by Chief Yarb-Gnock.\n* Kuldahar, the mountain village founded around the Great Oak was associated with the nature deity Silvanus.\n* Mithral Hall, the famous dwarfhold was located deep beneath Fourthpeak in the Frost Hills.\n* Sunblight, the mountain fortress of the Clan Sunblight duergar\n* Wyrmdoom Crag, the home of the Thuunlakalaga clan of goliaths."
