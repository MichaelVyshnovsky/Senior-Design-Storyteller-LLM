        "mainbody": "The '''Frozenfar''' was the coldest, most remote region of [[the North]]. It comprised the [[Spine of the World]] mountains; the frigid lands to the north and west; including [[Icewind Dale]], the [[Cold Run]], the icebergs of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], and the northeasternmost part of the [[Trackless Sea]].<ref group=\"note\">While ''[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]]'' includes the islands of [[Purple Rocks]] and [[Gundarlun]] within the ''Frozenfar'' section, their status as sub-arctic isles (and their latitude) is inconsistent with the in-text description of the Frozenfar in various sources. Additionally, they are not included within the broad categories of the ''Frozenfar'' section of the more recent sourcebook, the [[Legacy of the Crystal Shard]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Usage": "The Frozenfar did not have definable boundaries. The term \"Frozenfar\" was used by people across [[Faerûn]] to include various areas. For example in [[Amn]] and the [[Inner Sea]], the term \"Frozenfar\" referred to the city of [[Mirabar]] and everything north, including the Spine of the World mountains. Sometimes the term \"Frozenfar\" also included the island of [[Ruathym]].\n\nHowever in the North, the term \"Frozenfar\" referred only to the lands north of the Spine of the World.\n\nYet others used \"Frozenfar\" to refer to all the lands of the North within which individuals could literally freeze to death during their travels.",
        "Geography": "The Frozenfar reached the northern peaks of the Spine of the World and extended northwest through the Sea of Moving Ice. It stretched as far east as the [[Reghed Glacier]].",
        "Geographical features": {
            "Cold Run": "The Cold Run encompassed the icy tundras west of the [[Iron Trail]] and extended all the way to the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]]. It was bordered to the south by the [[Iceflow]] river, and to the north by the [[Shaengarne]].",
            "Icewind Dale": "[[File:IWD HoW WMap.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An aerial view of [[Icewind Dale]] and [[Kelvin's Cairn]].]]\nThe tundra of Icewind Dale was named after the freezing winds and snowstorms that blew down from the mountain of [[Kelvin's Cairn]].",
            "Northeast Trackless Sea": "The northeast of the Trackless Sea bordered the Sea of Moving Ice. This was immediately west of the Cold Run and was considered to be part of the Frozenfar.",
            "Sea of Moving Ice": "[[File:SeaMovingIce.png|thumb|right|250px|A large iceberg in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].]]\nThe waters north of the Cold Run and west of Icewind Dale were densely filled with hundreds of shifting icebergs and a number of frozen isles. It was sparsely populated and accommodated only a handful of landmarks and few inhabitants, like [[ice troll]]s and tribes of [[Ice Hunters]].",
            "Spine of the World": "[[File:Spine of the World AFR.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Spine of the World peaks were a breathtaking sight to behold, and imposing to traverse.]]\nBy most accounts, the [[Spine of the World]] mountains encompassed the southern reaches of the Frozenfar, separating the whole of the region from the warmer lands to the south."
