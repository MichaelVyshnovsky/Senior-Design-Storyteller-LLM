Midwinter Pass was a mountain pass found in the Hordelands and east FaerÃ»n.
Midwinter Pass was found in the southern region of the Giants Belt Mountains. The pass connected the plains of the Eastern Shaar and the Beastlands with the southwestern corner of Raurin. A short stretch of plains separated the pass from the Aerilpar Forest.
Midwinter Pass derived its name from the perpetual cold that permeated the pass regardless of the time of year.
