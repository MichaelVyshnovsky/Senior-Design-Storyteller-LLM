After a distant history of opposing kingdoms, the Haunted Lands were only thinly populated by several enlightened tribes of nomadic herders (called Al-Badia in Midani) and a number of small groups of savage nomads with more sinister trades.
Writings in a savage language could be found on the walls of the ruins in the Haunted Lands. Some of it was magically deciphered by scholars and identified as the dead language called Chun.
