        "mainbody": "'''Darkmaiden's Leap''' was a shrine sacred to the goddess [[Eilistraee]] and her followers, found in the northern [[High Forest]], southeast of [[Everlund]].",
        "Description": "Darkmaiden's Leap was a small clearing with a large flat-top gray rock about six feet tall and five feet in diamater. Pre-[[Time of Troubles]] the stone was known as [[Hastrin's Grayrock]], but after [[1358 DR]], the time when the place became sacred to Dark Maiden, the top of the stone bore a single left footprint the size of a drow female's foot and the place was named Darkmaiden's Leap by the followers of the goddess.",
        "Properties": "Darkmaiden's Leap was a [[planar touchstone]], a hub of energies linking strongly connected planes together<ref>[http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/iw/20040613a&page=3, Planar Touchstones] (in this case, Toril and Eilistraee's realm in [[Arvandor]]).\n\nDarkmaiden's Leap was infused with the magic of Eilistraee. Lolth worshipers had difficulty in casting divine spells when in the area, while travelers that chose to attune with its power (by dancing in the moonlight for at least one hour) could be granted [[low-light vision]], the ability to perform graceful and beautiful movements when dancing and to invoke a blade of moonlight (as the spell [[moon blade]]). The stone also acted as a two-way portal to a small cavern near the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]], if activated through a [[moon beam]] spell, or as a portal to Eilistraee's realm in Arvandor, if activated through a [[moon path]] spell."
