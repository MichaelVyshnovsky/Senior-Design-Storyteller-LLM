The '''Shigatse Glacier''' was a monstrous glacier that sat just south of [[Ra-Khati]] in the [[Katakoro Shan]] mountain range.

==Geography==
The glacier measured {{SI|90|mi|k}} in length and was {{SI|30|mi|k}} at its widest point. The Shigatse's yearly runoff fed the [[Muren Tso]] on the [[Katakoro Plateau]] to the east.
