'''Semphar''', also spelled '''Semphâr''', was the mightiest nation in the [[Hordelands]]. 

==Government==
It was officially considered the easternmost holding of [[Mulhorand]], but remained semiautonomous for some time.

===Flora & Fauna===
Fearsome [[dire horse]]s were known to roam Semphar wilderness, inspiring fear, awe, folk tales, and even cultist veneration.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/03-21 - Dire Horses}}

Semphar strove to be independent but was subjugated by different realms in its history, including the [[Imaskari]], [[Mulhorand]], and [[Shou Lung]]. Each contributed to Semphar's culture, society, laws, and faiths.

==Trade==
Trade in Semphar was based mostly around the caravans that passed through the nation along the [[Silk Road]], as well as the rich agriculture of its lands.

==History==
The first [[dwarves]] of [[Faerûn]] originally settled beneath beneath the lands that later came to be known as Semphar.

Mulhorand conquered the realm of Semphar ''circa'' the {{Yearlink|-1482}}.

==Notable Locations==
===Settlements===
* [[Dhaztanar]]
* [[Duirtanal]]
* [[Estanil]]
* [[Iliphanar]]
* [[Phelzel]]
* [[Semkhrun]], a Mulhorandi outpost that was founded some three centuries after Semphar was conquered.
* [[Semlithol]]
* [[Solon]], the city that was destroyed when a volcanic eruption burst underground in [[1360 DR]].
