Carradoon was a shipwrights town on the southern shore of Impresk Lake, southeast of the Snowflake Mountains.
Cadderly Bonaduces Spirit Soaring cathedral lay north of the town.  
The city proper was walled with many multi-story structures huddled inside the town walls. A long bridge connected the city of Carradoon to a nearby island section of the town reserved for the more wealthy inhabitants such as merchants and governing officials. It bordered on Impresk Lake, which drained into the Shalane River.
The city contained a market with a winery, two inns&mdashThe Dragons Codpiece and the Snoozing Dwarf Inn&mdashand a private club, the Moth Closet, which was located at the end of Lakeview Street.
In the city stood the tower of the wizard Belisarius.
Cadderly Bonaduce was born here.
In 1385 DR, the city was attacked by undead and shadow monsters from the Shadowfell, summoned by the liches Fetchigrol and Solm√©, as part of the Ghost Kings campaign to destroy the Spirit Soaring.
