        "mainbody": "Thiam was a town in Laothan in Malatra.\nIt was situated on Laothans northern coast, on the shore of the Eastern Sea south of the Hanchi Shoals. A trail ran east along the coast to Sayan.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, Thiam was well known for crafting jewelry and metalwork with inlays. Despite its position by the sea, it was only a lesser producer of pearls.\nOutside Thiam stood a monastery to the Ku Nien school of the Path of Enlightenment. It was believed to be a holy site, among the oldest known to the Seng, where legend held that a monk known as Tulang shifted a hill and made a spring."
