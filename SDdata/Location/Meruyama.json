        "mainbody": "Meruyama was a volcano located in Kozakura.\nMeruyama was located in Migri Province in the cool northern region of the island of Shinkoku. This slumbering volcano occasionally rumbled with restlessness, holding the distinction of being the loftiest among all of Kozakuras volcanoes. Surprisingly, its slopes remained unusually warm, seldom retaining snow, even during the coldest winters. The peak intermittently emitted steam and sporadically released ash and mud flows, contributing to numerous earthquakes in the surrounding area.\nThe presence of tengu and oni around Meruyama could be particularly vexing, creating a bothersome environment for travelers and locals alike. Furthermore, encounters with shinen-gaki were not uncommon."
