        "mainbody": "'''Lushpool''', known as the '''City of Shimmering Pools''', was a city in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "It stood on the [[Lapal Way]], by the mouth of [[Talar Bay]] in the sheltered lee of the [[Ithmong Peninsula]], where it faced the [[Shining Sea]].",
        "History": "In the [[1142 DR|Year of the Sword's Oath, 1142 DR]], the [[Coiled Cabal]], a group of [[yuan-ti pureblood]] mages, awoke from centuries of somnolence and attempted to reconquer the [[Cities of the Seabreeze]]. They were opposed by over two dozen [[archmage]]s of Lapaliiya and [[Tashluta]], who fought first the yuan-ti, then each other as they vied for their own power. For a full season, in a conflict called the [[Rage of Wizards]], they waged wild [[spell]] battles up and down the [[Tashtan Coast]]. By its end, the cities of Lapaliiya and the [[Tashalar]] had suffered gratuitous destruction, but not one wizard or yuan-ti had won a single crown. In the aftermath, the ruling houses of [[Sheirtalar]] and Lushpool formed a union in the [[1147 DR|Year of Glad Tidings, 1147 DR]], and installed [[Haliim]] as ruler: the first Overking of Lapaliiya.\n\nIn the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], after four years of adventuring, Prince Royal [[Shaliim Wyrmslayer|Shaliim]] returned to Lushpool. Over the following decade, he fought countless thieves who came for the treasures he'd brought back.\n\nIn the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], the aged Overking of Lapaliiya died of [[heartstop]] and his son, Shaliim, was crowned in his place, moving to Sheirtalar to rule.",
        "Description": "Lushpool was built upon a hill cut with seven great terraces. The bottom terrace joined the wharfs and comprised the wharf district. The uppermost level, at the very peak of the hill, was the exclusive domain of the Prince Royal of Lapaliiya and held the Palace of the Prince. All over the city were splendid hanging gardens and pools draped in mosses, and the city was famed for its beauty.",
        "Government & Religion": "<div class=\"border-box border-box-runes\" style=\"max-width: 400px; width:250px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: auto; border-width: 45px 23px 28px; float:right;\">\n  <div class=\"border-box-contentarea border-box-contentarea-runes\">\n    {{Split table|caption=Glossary|captionstyle=font-size:larger;font-family:Georgia,serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;\n      | '''asharlan'''     | Fortified luxury compound\n      | '''Lushpan'''      | Demonym\n    }}\n  </div>\n</div>\nThe nominal ruler of Lushpool was also the Prince Royal, that is, the heir to the Overking of Lapaliiya. In the mid-1300s DR, this was the former adventurer Shaliim Wyrmslayer.\n\nHowever, everyday matters of government were handled by a council of satraps. Throughout their history, the Lushpan satraps were perforce reclusive, remaining cloistered within their asharlans, issuing decrees in writing via servants (human but often [[tainted one]]s). They were only seen masked, and when they wished to address the citizens or give an audience, they used magic to speak through the mouths of chained female slaves.\n\nLushpool had been officially ruled by the Prince Royal since the union of the ruling houses of Sheirtalar and Lushpool in 1147 DR. In theory, the Overking ruled over Lushpool via the Prince Royal. However, in practice, to enact a new policy, an Overking needed the support of the representative of Lushpool on the Grand Council and typically had to negotiate with the Lushpan council of satraps. Lushpool was the third most politically powerful city in Lapaliiya after Sheirtalar and [[Ithmong (Lapaliiya)|Ithmong]].\n\nThe civic deity of Lushpool was [[Eldath]], Goddess of Singing Waters.\n\nThe town of [[Mierskar]] lying just to the south was a vassal of Lushpool.",
        "Population": "Lushpool was a large city of 17,265 people.",
        "Economy & Trade": "Several rare species of freshwater [[fish]] were bred in the city's pools. Their roe were delicacies all around [[Faerûn]] and the city's primary export, bringing Lushpool most of its riches. These fish, otherwise practically unknown to humans, were actually native to [[Lake Lemas]] beside the [[Black Jungles]]. The Hazim'tar yuan-ti introduced the initial breeding stock to the pools.\n\nThe Eselemaa yuan-ti also traded illicit goods through Lushpool. The yuan-ti in [[Oeble]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]] trafficked slaves through Lushpool south to the Black Jungles. In turn, urns of addictive [[mordayn powder]] manufactured in the Black Jungles were traded north to Oeble and distributed around [[Faerûn]]. The Coiled Cabal, with the consent of the Eselemaa, also traded through the port of Lushpool to [[Tharsult]] and, through other merchants, to the western lands of Faerûn.\n\nThe [[Baldovan]] family of mercenaries and merchants from [[Narruth]] in the [[Lake of Steam]] maintained businesses and homes in cities including Lushpool, as part of the trade with Lapaliiya around [[1370 DR]].",
        "Secrets": "Beneath the Palace of the Prince there was a two-way ''[[portal]]'' to the western shore of Lake Lemas, amongst the ruins of [[Ss'dath'in'ssatath]] in [[Serpentes]]. Passage required a key, namely a snakeskin; this could be shed or still on the body, from a snake or a serpentfolk, alive or dead. Naturally yuan-ti could pass with ease."
