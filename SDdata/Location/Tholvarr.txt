'''Tholvarr''', meaning ''"our place"'' in an ancient dialect of [[Giant language|Jotun]], was a region of the [[Spine of the World]] mountains that was home to several communities of [[frost giant]]s.

==Inhabitants==
Among the frost giants that dwelled within the mountain peaks and valleys that encompassed Tholvarr were those from the [[Arthlarr]], [[Borumn]], [[Joront]], [[Klevvyn]], [[Turtorst]] and [[Yargray]] tribes. While they lived amongst one another, these groups regularly came into quarrels and clashes.
