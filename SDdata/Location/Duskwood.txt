The '''Duskwood''' was a forest in the [[Border Kingdoms]]. It covered the eastern side of the Border Kingdoms area, between the [[Realm of the Smoking Star]] and the [[Realm of the Ready Sword]].{{Cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frbk/20060719a|title=Duskwood|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|date=2006-07-19|work=The Border Kingdoms|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|accessdate=2008-04-25}}

==Description==
Of all forests in the Border Kingdoms, the Duskwood was the deepest and most untamed. It had dense undergrowth.

==Inhabitants==
Giant [[spider]]s, huge [[snake]]s, [[owlbear]]s, and [[badger mouse|badger mice]] were all found in the Duskwood. [[Beholder]]s were also said to lurk there.

Duskwood was home to several species of unique plants and animals. [[Ash wheat]]'s lifecycle affected the cycles of other animal species in the region. Ash wheat grew in abundance every spring, providing a generous food source for the [[badger mice]] and swelling their numbers. The growing population of badger mice led to abundant food for [[puff adder]]s, increasing the [[snake]] population. In harsh winters, puff adders numbers dwindled only to increase after the annual ash wheat growth.

==History==
By [[1479 DR]], the Duskwood no longer existed, having been swallowed by the desert wasteland of the [[Shaar Desolation]] created through climate change brought about by the [[Spellplague]].
