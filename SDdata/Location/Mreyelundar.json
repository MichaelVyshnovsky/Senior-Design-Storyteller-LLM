        "mainbody": "Mreyelundar was a port city and a member of the confederation of the Dusk Ports in Laerakond. It was the most decadent of all the Dusk Ports.\nMreyelundar was known for its wealth, decadence, lawlessness, and illicit practices. Gangs dominated the city and gained great wealth after having paid the green dragon Orlarrakh her due.\nThe free people of Mreyelundar loathed dragons, having suffered first hand the depredations of the Green Duchess. In desperation, most of them turned to the cults of the Dawn Titans for succor. The Order of the Dawn, founded some years before 1479 DR, gained enough influence to be considered a real force behind Mreyelundars closed doors.\nMreyelundar was ruled by a Gate Lord. In 1479 DR, the Gate Lord was Trusk Rantyne. However, he had no real power in the city, who was truly ruled by a mysterious thief known as Narnorn.\nThe foremost goldsmiths and gemcutters in all of Laerakond lived and worked in Mreyelundar.\n* Trusk Rantyne, the Gate Lord in 1479 DR.\n* Narnorn, a mysterious thief and the true power in the city.\n* Rowan Babar, the leader of the Order of the Dawn in 1479 DR."
