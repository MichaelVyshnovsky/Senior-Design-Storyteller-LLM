        "mainbody": "The '''Lurkwood''', also known as '''Vurykvudd''' to the [[dwarves]], was a great, temperate hardwood<ref> forest located south of the [[Spine of the World]]. It was one of the woodlands that were collectively called the [[Moonwoods]] by some in [[the North]].",
        "Geography": "South of the forest was the village of [[Grunwald]],<ref> where the [[Thunderbeast tribe]] dwelled within the wood.\n\nTo the east of the wood lay the [[Frost Hills]] and [[Mithral Hall]], the mining community of [[Mirabar]] was west, and the town of [[Nesmé]] was to the south-east.<ref> The edges of Lurkwood were logged by [[human]]s, but its shadowy depths were largely mysterious; plagued with legends of bottomless bogs and deadly [[quicksand]]. Beneath the Lurkwood, in the upper [[Underdark]], lay the region called the [[Wormwrithings]] and many tunnels connecting to the Underdark could be found within the forest.",
        "Trade": "A sleeping salve, known as ''[[haedrar]]'', was made by the [[Thunderbeast tribe]] from [[herb]]s and roots found within the forest. Though the tribe did not sell ''haedrar'', theft of the salve proved profitable.<ref>",
        "History": "In ancient times, the Lurkwood was part of the [[High Forest]], but it and many other woodlands were split off by the conflicts of the [[Crown Wars]].<ref>\n\nIn the late 1350s DR, a variety of unusual monsters were sighted around the [[Sword Coast North]] and were tracked back to the Lurkwood, where they'd seemingly emerged. Meanwhile, across [[Faerûn]], similar monsters appeared around the [[Dragon Reach]] and apparently originated in the [[Border Forest]]. Among these were flying [[troll]]-like things, winged [[undead]] capable of flight, smoky clouds with multiple retractable arms ending in [[clam]]-like jaws and which hunted silently, and intelligent two-headed [[snake]]s with tentacles and magical powers—all previously unknown both to local hunters and forest-dwellers and to wider Faerûn. Too big and too numerous to all be supported by forest food sources, and emerging at a steady rate, the monsters were theorized to have been spawned by unidentified magical sources within their respective forests.{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|27}}\n\nIn [[Eleint]] of the {{yearlinkName|1366}}, the [[gnoll]] tribe that called themselves the [[Hoar Fang]] were destroying large parts of the Lurkwood. The recently empowered [[Chosen]] of [[Mielikki]], [[Jeryth Phaulkon]]; prominent [[Harper]] [[Bran Skorlsun]]; a pair of mercenaries; and a force of woodland animals killed all but the tribe's leader and one lieutenant.\n\nAlso in the mid-to-late 1360s, the numerous [[Urlbluk]] tribe of [[kobold]]s attempted to migrate from the [[Fell Pass]] to tunnels beneath the Lurkwood. However, at last report, the kobolds had run into violence in the attempt.<ref>{{Cite dragon/216/Elminster's Notebook: Kobold commotions|100}}",
        "Inhabitants": "A bad reputation lay over the forest because of its inhabitants. The southern area of Lurkwood was safe and attracted loggers, hunters, and woodsmen from the neighboring communities of [[Mirabar]], [[Nesmé]], and [[Longsaddle]]. The rest of the wood was overrun with evil creatures, such as [[orc]]s. Other monsters preyed on those who entered the forest, like [[ettin]]s and [[giant]]s. Several [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]] tribes lived within the forest as well, such as the [[Elk tribe|Elks]], [[Griffon tribe|Griffons]] and [[Sky Pony tribe|Sky Ponies]]. In the eastern parts of Lurkwood toward Fell Pass, the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] lived and hunted, numbering more than fifty [[lycanthropes]]. Worshipers of [[Vhaeraun]] were also known to conduct holy rites in the forest on the night of the new moon.<ref>",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Chill Tower]], headquarters of [[the Chill]], a nonhuman mercenary company.<ref>\n* [[Dungeon of Death]], located just within the southern border of the forest, beneath a grassy hill.<ref>\n* [[Vintner's Keep]], a keep and winery located just south of the forest."
