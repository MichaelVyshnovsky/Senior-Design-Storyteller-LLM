'''Silverglen''' was a grove and temple in the city of [[Silverymoon]] dedicated to the [[deity]] [[Silvanus]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was often used for worship services by priestesses of [[Lurue]].

==Geography==
The Temple of Silver Stars was located in the eastern part of the [[Northbank]] section of Silverymoon. It was south of the [[Halls of Inspiration]] and many of the city's other temples, west of the [[High Palace]], and east of the city's [[Market (Silverymoon)|Market]]. Along its eastern boundary was the [[Harper Hall]].

==Description==
This grove had the look of a well-maintained park, with carefully tended trees.

==Inhabitants==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the [[druid]] known as [[Willa O'Greensleeves]] inhabited the grove.

==Rumors & Legends==
By [[1367 DR]], there was a rumor that a network of passageways existed beneath the grove that connected Harper Hall to various buildings across the city, including the [[Dancing Goat]] tavern, the [[Map House]], and the [[Vault of the Sages]]. Nearly every copse of trees in Silverymoon was the subject of sightings of the [[avatar]] of the Unicorn Queen, including those in Silverglen.
