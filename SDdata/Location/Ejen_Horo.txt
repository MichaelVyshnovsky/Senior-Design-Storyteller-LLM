Ejen Horo, or the Valley of the God, was a vale located between the Mountains of Copper and the Khopet Dag within the Hordelands.
Blessed with good weather, Ejen Horo was a lush garden-like valley that offered plentiful hunting as many animals were drawn to the bountiful vegetation. Small lakes dotted the landscape, courtesy of the plentiful rainfall experienced in the valley.
Sacred to the Tuigan, this large valley was believed to be the birthplace of their great nation. They vigorously defended the entire valley from intruders.
The natives of the Hordelands used this valley to hold their annual couralitai meetings. Honored dead of the Tuigan were also buried within the valley.
Though physically beautiful, Ejen Horo could be a dangerous place since many spirits wandered the land. Usually their wrath was only reserved from those who attempted to rob burial mounds.
A special group of Tuigan priests called the Irooukudel lived within the valley to oversee the care for the deceased.
