Teshenfall Pass was a mountain pass that allowed access to Anauroch from the Tesh Valley.
Teshenfall Pass cut through the Desertsmouth Mountains, beginning at the headwaters of the River Tesh and ending within Anauroch.
The Zhentarim used Teshenfall Pass to move their caravans into Anauroch before turning south toward Tel Badir. A dozen Zhentilar soldiers accompanied by two Zhent wizards were stationed in the pass to prevent any non-Zhentarim from entering.
