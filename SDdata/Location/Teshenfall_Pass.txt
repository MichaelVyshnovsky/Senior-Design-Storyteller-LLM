'''Teshenfall Pass''' was a mountain pass that allowed access to [[Anauroch]] from the [[Tesh Valley]].

==Geography==
Teshenfall Pass cut through the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], beginning at the headwaters of the [[River Tesh]] and ending within Anauroch.

==Activities==
The [[Zhentarim]] used Teshenfall Pass to move their caravans into Anauroch before turning south toward [[Tel Badir]]. A dozen [[Zhentilar]] soldiers accompanied by two [[Zhent]] [[wizard]]s were stationed in the pass to prevent any non-Zhentarim from entering.
