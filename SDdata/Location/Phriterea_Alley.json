        "mainbody": "hriterea Alley was a street located in the affluent second quarter of the city of Innarlith on the Lake of Steam.\nPrior to 1361 DR, a pottery shop existed here that sold locally made pottery wares, while many other pottery shops nearby were stocking imported ceramics from Shou Lung.\nIn 1361 DR, the Red Wizard Marek Rym√ºt was engaged in a breeding program to produce the mutant offspring of a black dragon and firedrakes in a nursery underneath the second quarter of Innarlith. However, he was having trouble feeding them and needed more space for the nursery. On Tarsakh 3, 1361, the black firedrakes escaped by finding a way through underground tunnels to a connection under the floor of the cellar of the pottery shop in Phriterea Alley. The connection had been sealed off many years prior to this, perhaps before the pottery shop had been built.\nThe black firedrakes came through the cellar and destroyed the building. One of them was seen with the wife of the pottery merchant in its jaws. They then proceeded to make a path of mayhem and destruction through the city of Innarlith, before they were either killed by the city guard or clandestinely transported back to the nursery by Marek.\nMarek had initially thought that the black firedrakes had emerged from the hatchery itself, but when he saw that it hadnt been breached, he identified the pottery shop as the source of the outbreak and promptly went there, performing a transmutation spell to seal the connection and make it appear like it was just a crater, so that no one would discover the nursery. After he did this, he overhead two city watchmen nearby, one of whom claimed to the other to have seen the black firedrakes emerge from the shop. Marek then killed them both with a fireball before making himself invisible again and checking for other witnesses."
