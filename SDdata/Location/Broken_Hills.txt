The '''Broken Hills''' was a rough and rugged plot of land immediately beyond [[Nimpeth]]'s northeastern wall ending at the waters of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
The rugged and unwelcoming rocks of the Broken Hills were turned into the agricultural wonder of the Vilhon â€“ [[Woren Vineyards]]. These sprawling vineyards were built through cruel slave labor by [[Woren]], the Lord of Nimpeth. The vineyards overlooked the body of water of the Vilhon Reach and were walled off, securing the Lord's property.

==History==
The Broken Hills were transformed into the vineyards through hard labor and astonishing feats of landscaping sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1370}} and before the visit from [[Adamar Session]], [[Bard]] of [[Starmantle]], during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Reach.
