'''Cape Raeth''' was a sparsely-populated peninsula to the southwest of the [[Cloakwood]] that formed the western border of [[Cloak Bay]].

==Description==
Cape Raeth was a cliffy peninsula that housed three [[fish]]ing settlements of [[Orthul's Notch]] almost on the cape's tip, [[Calyaun]] on the cape's base, and Eldelorr at its northernmost point where Cloakwood almost reached the Cloak Bay.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the hamlets of Cape Raeth were almost deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage.
