Manapurang was a mining town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, Manapurang has not been labelled on any map of Malatra, 
Manapurang stood among the hills at the border of the Kuong Kingdom and the Purang hill country.
The towns population was half Kuong humans and half korobokuru, who were considered by the Kuong to be "primitive hill folk" and "odd dwarf-like natives".The sourcebook notes "The natives of Manapurang should be regarded as korobokuru barbarians in terms of their abilities." so its not clear if theyre actually meant to be korobokuru or if korobokuru stats are a stand-in for human dwarfs.
Manapurang was a common starting point for expeditions by prospectors for gold and miners of alabaster and jade. The korobokuru worked as guides and gold miners, and knew well how to find riches in the hills that were their home.
