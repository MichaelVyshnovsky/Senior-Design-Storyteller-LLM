'''Candlekeep''' was the famous library-fortress that stood proud as a bastion of enlightenment and knowledge on the [[Sword Coast]] for many centuries. It housed a magnificent collection of books and scrolls of lore, considered the greatest collection of the writings in all of [[Faer√ªn]]. The keep was the home of the [[Avowed]], a group of renowned scholars and people of learning, that revered great seer [[Alaundo]] and his [[Prophecies of Alaundo|collection of prophecies]] that foresaw many great events that passed throughout the ongoing history of the Realms.

==Description==
[[File:candlekeep2.jpg|thumb|300px|''A follower of [[Oghma]] on a [[giant eagle]], flying over Candlekeep.'']]
Candlekeep was a spectacular sight from the surrounding lands, a formidable fortress that comprised scores of towers, of varying heights and styles. Its numerous towers ascended into the skies above, creating a unique silhouette against the skies over the coastal sea. 

The keep's enormous double gates, which stood three times as tall as a [[human|man]], formed its main entrance facing east. Its doors were forged from a strange black metal, each of which featured the sigil of Candlekeep, the image of castle with flames set atop each of its towers. 

Immediately beyond the imposing front gates was the Court of Air, a vast cobblestone courtyard around which were [[Candlekeep#Court of Air|Candlekeep's establishments and amenities]] that catered to visitors and "Seekers", those who arrived with the purpose of finding knowledge and wisdom.

To venture beyond the Court of Air into the sheltered Inner Ward of Candlekeep, Seekers had to pass through the magnificent, and [[magic]]ally-protected ''Emerald Door''. The Inner Ward housed the [[Great Library]] of Candlekeep,

Beneath the keep were a series of secured chambers used for spellcasting,  catacombs, sewers, and subterranean passageways inhabited by unusual creatures. Deepest of these was the Chamber of Lost Lore, a continually-illuminated room that allowed those with permission to ''[[contact other plane|commune]]'' with long-deceased scholars and [[Sage|sages]].

Candlekeep was nestled upon a rocky outcropping on a narrow peninsula, about {{SI|100|ft}} from the cliffside along the [[Sea of Swords]]. The path leading to its entrance was called the [[Way of the Lion]],<ref name=VGSC-p27> which extended from the [[Coast Way]] that ran along the Sword Coast.

The keep was located {{SI|120|mi|k}} south of [[Baldur's Gate]].

===Geographical Features===
The library-fortress rested atop a volcanic crag that jutted out from the side of the [[Sea of Swords]]. 

The western side of Candlekeep was bombarded with mist and waters from the [[Sea of Swords]], and iced over during winter. During these cold months, several of these towers had to be abandoned as they became too hazardous to live within.

==Government==
[[File:Candlekeep crest.png|thumb|right|200px|''A depiction of the crest of Candlekeep.'']]
While Candlekeep did not possess a true government as a village or similarly-sized settlement might, the [[Monk|monks]] of the Avowed were led by a group of their order who ascended the ranks on a meritocratic basis. their leadership made allowances for them to fulfill their duties with structure and order.

The [[Keeper of the Tomes]] was the highest-ranked member of the order, an individual who appointed those believed well-suited to take on leadership roles within. In all practical applications, their word was considered law in Candlekeep.

The Keeper was served by the [[First Reader]], who tirelessly worked to obtain new books, scrolls, and other pieces to add to the libraries' collections; along with the Great Readers, eight learned sages that were each considered to be the premier authority in their selected field of study and research.

They were further assisted by the Great Readers, the Chanter, the Guide, and the Gatewarden. 

===Laws===
In addition to Candlekeep's absolute rule, forbidding the destruction of knowledge,<ref name=VGSC-p33 /> Seekers and other visitors were asked to abide by the Orders of Accordance, a set of rules that were enforced by banishment. Violence, theft, and the damage or copying of any documents in the library's collection was not tolerated under any circumstances.

==Defenses==
[[File:Emerald Door.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The ''Emerald Door'' of the Inner Ward, watched over by its Keeper.'']]

The physical defense of Candlekeep's exterior was led by member of the Avowed known as the Gatewarden. They coordinated the protection of the front gate through which all petitioners and visitors passed. They were aided by monks known as Watchers, the Keeper of the Emerald Door, previously known as the Keeper of the Portal, who served as the protector of the Inner Ward. 

Nearly all of the Avowed whose efforts contributed to the safety of the keep were powerful [[Archmage|archmages]], like those other individuals that took on leadership roles. Each of Gatewarden, Watchers, and the Keeper were served by a dozen well-armed monks, armed with a myriad of magical implements.<ref name=VGSC-p33/>

Candlekeep possessed ancient hidden entrances, known as 'Old Gates', that were unknown even to the most senior of the Avowed. Passage required precise knowledge of their location, appropriate postures, and utterance of intonations. Beyond these, any prospective intruders would also have to contend with the wards.

===Magical Protection===
Candlekeep was guarded by layers of [[magical]] [[Ward|wards]] that protected the keep itself, the people within, along with its collection of writings. Among the protections provided by these wards included the restriction of entry by means of ''[[teleportation]]'', the preservation of writing from degradation by [[mold]] or [[weevil|insect]], an inhibition of flames that were larger than those provided by a [[candle]], and prevention of theft of whole [[Book|books]], amongst others. The Candlekeep wards were old and rather unique - employing multiple layers of powerful spells, unlike the living ''[[Mythal|mythals]]'' 

Along with the wards, the keep was even protected by a singular ''mythal'', referred to as the Great Shield, a barrier of [[Elven high magic|elven magic]] that could be activated by the Keeper of Tomes if the need ever arose.

==Activities==
{{Quote|...so sayeth the wise Alaundo.|''Ending of many lines of the Endless Chant.''}}
[[File:Candlekeep_interior-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|''The interior of the Great Library of Candlekeep.'']]

One of the primary goals of the keep's Avowed was to catalog and maintain the prophecies of the famed, 1{{st}} century seer Alaundo. Recitations of the prophecies were magically recorded within a series of prismatic [[gem]]stones, referred to as the Echoes of Alaundo.

Candlekeep's Chanter and the three Voices were often found carrying out procession throughout the Court of Air, reciting the lines of the ''[[Endless Chant]]''. During these processions, the prophecies of Alaundo continually echoed through the grounds of Candlekeep for all to hear.

Among the faithful of [[Oghma]], Candlekeep was considered one of the most holy sites in all the Realms.

===Gaining Entrance===
To gain entry into the halls of wisdom, a petitioner had to present the seal of a renowned [[wizard]], as well as an "entrance-gift" to the library, a [[book|tome]] of immense value, great rarity or significant historical importance to add to their collection. While the shrewd gatekeepers typically accepted books worth no less than 1,000 [[gp]],<ref group="note"> some reported the value as much as 10,000 [[gp]] or even more. books containing particularly insightful annotations or journals of important persons have been accepted before. 

The "friends of Candlekeep" were allowed entrance in to Candlekeep without offering an entrance-gift. Among these select individuals were certain [[archmage]]s, [[priest]]s of the [[deities]] [[Oghma]], [[Deneir]], [[Gond]] and [[Milil]], along with both [[Heralds (local)|local]] and [[High Heralds]] alike.

Anyone entering the Inner Ward was required to possess special permission from leaders of the Avowed, in the form of a signed letter that could only be verified by the portal's Keeper.

===Services===
Visitors granted entry into the keep were known as "Seekers", and referred to as "goodsir" or "goodlady" by the library's monks, if their name was unknown.<ref group="note">[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|VGtSC]] refers to "seekers" as a rank within the Avowed. These individuals were allowed to stay for one [[tenday]], after which they were asked to leave and wait a full month before returning for another stay.

During their time in Candlekeep, Seekers could read specific books within the necessariums, but were not permitted to copy their contents. Inscription service was specifically provided by the Avowed, with copying and binding costs that ranged anywhere from 100 to over 10,000 [[gp]] and took upwards of several weeks to complete.

Seekers could solicit the wizened advice of Candlekeep's scholars for the substantial fee 2000 gp, double the standard rate for sages in the Realms beyond.

==History==
Although some sources stated that Candlekeep was originally the citadel of Alaundo, having grown around his small and humble tower,{{cite web |url=http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/ck_scroll.htm |title=An Introduction to Candlekeep |accessdate=2011-05-05 |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] |year=2004 |publisher=Candlekeep |language=English}} the keep actually predated the seer by some hundred years, having been founded c. the [[-200 DR|Year of Stonerising, -200 DR]].>  

Alaundo arrived in Candlekeep in the {{yearlinkName|75}}, to study the writings kept there and got a reputation for his visions into the future. Following his death, the keep became a sanctuary of knowledge, revering his prophecies and dedicating itself to the preservation of all available knowledge.

[[File:Gorion3.png|thumb|left|250px|''The sage [[Gorion]] and his ward [[Abdel Adrian|Abdel]] leave Candlekeep for the [[Way of the Lion]] in [[1368 DR]].'']]

During the [[Iron crisis]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Sarevok Anchev]] infiltrated the Great Library during his quest for power and immortality. He filled Candlekeep's catacombs with [[doppelganger]]s that masqueraded as citizens of the fortress, along with those who were significant to his sibling and fellow [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]], including his foster father [[Gorion]].

As the calamitous [[Second Sundering]] wracked the Sword Coast, the keep was beleaguered by wealthy citizens attempting to purchase shelter within its walls or foreign envoys who demanded arcane knowledge to shield themselves from the growing threats of the Realms. Numerous monks of the Avowed began to disappear, 

Elminster mentioned that Candlekeep was once besieged by a host of [[devil]]s from the [[Nine Hells]], led by a [[mage]] devoted to the [[archdevil]] [[Asmodeus]]. This led to the creation of the protective wards around Candlekeep. 

The [[1487 DR|following year]] Candlekeep suffered an aerial assault carried out by a woman riding atop a [[black dragon]], mysteriously attempting to go after one of the long-abandoned towers

Just a few days later, the continued efforts of several parties seeking gain control the magical [[Weave]] energy stored in Candlekeep's ''mythal'' came to a violent conclusion. While the sage [[Elminster]] strived to personally guard over the wards of Candlekeep, [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral]] and [[Alustriel Silverhand]] of the [[Moonstars]] sought to destroy them, in order to prevent them from being used by [[Shar]] and the [[Princes of Shade]]. Just as [[Maerandor]] the Shadovar began their attack, they were met by the Great Readers of the Avowed, and rebuffed in a great spell battle. After the spell battle broke out, the [[lich]] [[Larloch]] revealed himself to the monks of the keep, and deceived Elminster into essentially handing over control of the ''mythal's'' power.

Many Avowed were killed during this conflict, including several senior monks such as the [[Keeper of the Tomes]].<ref>

It addition to the great works and rare tome found within, the Great Library held a seemingly endless amount of paltry and insignificant documents such as recipes, inscribed song lyrics, journals of fairly unremarkable individuals and other such trivial writings.  It held a dozen towers, known as "necessariums", that offered seekers ample place to study and read in peace.
* Vaults, the subterranean chambers that were said to contain such hidden knowledge that anyone who was able to discover and wield them, would gain power that was incomparable to anything known on Toril.
* The [[Everwinding Stair]] led to study areas for the monks. 

In addition to these buildings the keep housed a warehouse, several granaries, and an infirmary.
