        "mainbody": "Thok was a village in Tabot.Sources and maps variously call Thok a village, town, or city \"village\" is adopted here to suit the description in \"The Flowers of Flame\".\nIt stood at the foot of the northern face of the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains, beside the southern forests of Tabot. Roads from here led northwest to Darka and east to Khampo, both roughly a days ride away.\nIt was a small village with a lone trading post and the manors of three minor nobles. These stood at the town center around a cobbled courtyard and a shallow well fed by a spring.\nIt was inhabited mostly by goat herders.\nWhen a band of adventurers came through Thok in their quest to find the Valley of Wings and the Flowers of Flame, no one there knew how to find themâ€”unsurprisingly, for they were thought to be a fairy-tale. Regardless, the people of Thok suggested they find a good guide. Six likely local guides were found at the trading post Chang-chub, Sakya, Tshal, Pagmotru, Gedun, and Karmapa, of varying skill, approach, and reliability. Whoever they chose, in Thok they could trade their fine horses for pack-carrying goats or donkeys for the journey into the mountains\nIn , in response to a Phutanese army assembling at the border, Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in Bidnop So, Darka, Thok, and Khampo. That same year, when yeti emerged from the Wu Pi Te Shar mountains and raided Nafeen Gompa, the dzong-pon (sheriff) of Thok district organized a hunting expedition against them, distributing printed handbills around southwestern Tabot as far as Bidnop So Bridge. Among the first volunteers were 25 people from Eotzi Gompa, who quickly went to Nafeen."
