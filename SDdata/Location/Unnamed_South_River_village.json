        "mainbody": "his village was a small elven settlement located along the Tun River in the Tunlands of Cormyr.\nThis unnamed elven village stood on the southwestern shores of the Tun River, west of Skull Crag and just south of the Tun Marshes. The river brought a cool refreshing breeze to the town, as well as giant crocodiles from upstream. The local population was known for its sharpshooting skills, with regular archery competitions taking place, open exclusively to the residents.\nIn the early 1360s DR, the elven village became the target for the lizarfolk tribe, allied with a group of young black dragons. The village started being attacked by the scaled forces from the nearby Tun Marshes. Subsequently, the monsters dealt some significant damage to the town, leaving it in a bad state of disrepair and vulnerable to continued assault. Despite their best attempts, elf and human archers failed to stop the attackers while the defenders slowly mounted the losses. A band of adventurers who were aiding Skull Crag in the time of need arrived just in time to stand with the villages defenses against yet another lizardfolk, dragon, and giant crocodile assault. Once the village was safe, the group ventured into the swamp in search of the lizardfolk camp\nThe village had a trader of various goods, including some elven magic times, a humble but busy tavern, and a boathouse, closed to outsiders. Those unwise to break in were faced with elven ghostly spirit guardians. The village had at least one shrine open to visitors, dedicated to the goddess Lliira. The towns harbor was littered with fishing boats and fishers who used nets to haul in the catch.\nThe town was also the site of the Grove of the Holy Ones, a local landmark where the benediction of the gods ceremony took place. Locals sold tickets to the event..\nThe village was a mostly elven settlement, inhabited by some bow-wielding humans. The elven population kept a tight social group, while some inhabitants thought the south river region was not the same since the hin had left across the mountains."
