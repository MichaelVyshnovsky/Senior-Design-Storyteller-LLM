'''Fetlock Court''' was a large paved courtyard in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]], adjoining the stables and paddocks of the [[Palace of Waterdeep|Lords' Palace]].

==Description==
Officially, it was used as the staging area for mounted guards before their departure on patrols. Unofficially, [[bard]]s from the [[New Olamn]] college often used Fetlock Court as an impromptu concert practice area.

Benches were available here for public sitting purposes.

==Geography==
Fetlock Court lay directly to the west of [[Swords Street]]. A minor street known as [[the Rise]] climbed north from the Court and up [[Mount Waterdeep]] to the [[Mountainside]] neighborhood.

==Rumors & Legends==
A flagstone in Fetlock Court concealed a small shaft connected to the [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]], roughly the diameter of a [[human]] arm and equipped with a small container attached to a thin cord of enchanted [[spidersilk]], allowing messages and small items to be passed to and fro. The [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] were aware of the shaft, but no one could remember exactly which chamber of Undermountain it connected to. In the spring of {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a mysterious individual was spotted using the shaft but they fled when confronted by Watch officers, apparently vanishing into thin air. This drew the attention of [[Lords of Waterdeep|Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]] as well as the [[Blackstaff]], [[Vajra Safahr]]. Following this, the City Watch kept the flagstone under active surveillance.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Weirdnesses of Waterdeep}}

One of the many ''[[portal]]s'' leading to [[Maldiglas's Refuge]] deep inside Mount Waterdeep could be found at the southwestern end of Fetlock Court, just past the horse-trough.

==Inhabitants==
