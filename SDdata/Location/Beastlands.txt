The '''Beastlands''' were a region of plains at the eastern end of the [[Shaar]]. It was home to various non-human monstrous tribes who were allied in a loose confederation for self-defense. The eastern edge of this region was formed by the [[Giant's Belt Mountains]], a range which separated the plains from the desert to the east.

{{Quote|''Yes, those tales your mother told you were true: There is a land of monsters, ruled by monsters, and this is it. They eat caravans whole along the [[Trade Way]], love to raid the camps of outlanders who will all be too dead to hit back, and dream of ruling all Faerûn. Avoid the place or be eaten, as the old [[map]]s say.''|Anonymous [[Harper]] agent<ref>{{Cite web/geocities/Ed Says: Geography of the Realms}}}}
