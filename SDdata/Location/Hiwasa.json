        "Description": "Hiwasa, positioned a short distance from [[Gulf of Mi|Miumi]], was a significant fishing village in the Miyama region. Located within the [[Niwa clan]] estate, it contained 300 buildings, predominantly [[Kozakuran dictionary#M|''minka'']] and [[Kozakuran dictionary#G|''godowns'']].",
        "Trade": "The village primarily engaged in fishing and farming. Additionally, Hiwasa boasted a variety of skilled craftsmen. The village offered various services, including an inn, several shipwrights, salt makers, two smiths, multiple potters, a family of weavers, numerous carpenters, a freight merchant, [[sake]] makers, three [[tofu]] makers, two [[Tea house|teahouses]], and even a small theater.\n\nA unique aspect of Hiwasa's economy was [[pearl]] diving, a task predominantly undertaken by women, who were believed to possess greater aptitude for this challenging activity. These pearls were located in deep, dark waters of Miumi, posing significant risks to the divers. Besides the inherent dangers of deep-sea diving, the local [[oyster]] beds were frequented by undersea creatures known to threaten the lives of the pearl divers. The bodies of missing pearl divers were found deceased in the village center at dawn.",
        "Government": "Hiwasa served as the administrative center for the Niwa estate. As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the village's [[jito]] was [[Hiro Koji]]. He resided in a fortified compound on the village's outskirts. His household also included numerous servants such as grooms, maids, cooks, and washing women. He diligently monitored the movement of strangers through the estate and within Hiwasa, ensuring the security and order of the area.",
        "Defenses": "Hiro Koji maintained a retinue of ten [[samurai]] and ninety [[bushi]] and employed an armorer and a bowyer within his fortified compound."
