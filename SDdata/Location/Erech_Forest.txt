The '''Erech Forest''' was a dark and isolated forest located on the edge of [[Rashemen]] in the [[Unapproachable East]].

==Geography==
The forest was located at the base of [[Mount Nar]] and the [[Firward Mountains]]. While it was considered to be outside the borders of Rashemen for many years, by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] it was contained within.

===Flora & Fauna===
It was home to dangerous plants like [[assassin vine]]s and [[shambling mound]]s, as well as fearsome beasts like [[owlbear]]s, [[night hunter]]s, and at least one [[gray render]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Citadel Tralkarn]], the fallen fortress of the evil Rashemaar [[durthan]]s.

==Inhabitants==
The mysterious forest was the domain of malevolent [[fey]] creatures and [[telthor]]s, as was much of Rashemen.

While the Erech Forest served as the hidden refuge of the [[durthan]]s for some time, in the years following the [[Witch War]] it was home to the witches' [[ghost]]s, left to haunt their former home.
