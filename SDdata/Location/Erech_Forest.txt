The Erech Forest was a dark and isolated forest located on the edge of Rashemen in the Unapproachable East.
The forest was located at the base of Mount Nar and the Firward Mountains. While it was considered to be outside the borders of Rashemen for many years, by the late 15 century DR it was contained within.
It was home to dangerous plants like assassin vines and shambling mounds, as well as fearsome beasts like owlbears, night hunters, and at least one gray render.
* Citadel Tralkarn, the fallen fortress of the evil Rashemaar durthans.
The mysterious forest was the domain of malevolent fey creatures and telthors, as was much of Rashemen.
While the Erech Forest served as the hidden refuge of the durthans for some time, in the years following the Witch War it was home to the witches ghosts, left to haunt their former home.
