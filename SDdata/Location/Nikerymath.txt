'''Nikerymath''' was an ancient [[elven]] kingdom. In {{Yearlink|-255}}, in response to Jhaamdath's murdering of many elves over their need for wood to build their ships, the High Mages of Nikerymath destroyed the realm of [[Jhaamdath]] by summoning a gargantuan tidal wave which also reformed the coastline of the [[Vilhon Reach]].
