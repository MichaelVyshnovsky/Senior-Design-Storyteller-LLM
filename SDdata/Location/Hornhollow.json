        "mainbody": "ornhollow was a logging village on the edge of the Wood of Sharp Teeth in the Western Heartlands established before the early 14 century DR.\nSome years before the , the village of Hornhollow was visited by a geriatric red dragon, Craum Straug. The wyrm was afflicted by a terrible draconic cough, his wheezing and belching flames set the village on fire, and the inhabitants of Hornhollow fled, fearing for their lives. Craum Straug perched at the center of town, unwilling to move. The people of Hornhollow held a lottery to see who was to negotiate with the dragon, and a traveling minstrel whose welcome at the village had worn out, Aznee Fraystrings, was the unlucky winner.\nAznee attempted to cure the dragons cough but likely overestimated his knowledge of the local herbs, and his herbal remedy caused Craum Straug terrible vomiting. The belched flames immediately incinerated Aznee Fraystrings and several acres of the Wood of Sharp Teeth but also took the life of the fragile creature.\nWhen Hornhollows inhabitants returned, they found Craum Straugs bones, still sneezing and creaking even after his death. They subsequently sold the draconic corpse to a local wizard to be fashioned into the famed Pipes of the Wheezing Dragon."
