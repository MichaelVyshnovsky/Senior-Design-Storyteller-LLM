        "mainbody": "Vaeranth was a failed upstart barony in the northern reaches of Amn belonging to House Yeldred of Waterdeep.\nThis barony was located somewhere north of the barony of Hawkhill. It was largely an untamed wilderness.\nThis land was purchased by Vaeranth Yeldred as part of an effort to improve his familys prestige. The family had an elaborate blazon made for the barony, built three stone keeps there, hired cartographers to produce elaborate maps of the land and distribute them throughout Waterdeep, and his family members styled themselves as the Lords and Ladies of Vaeranth. Despite all this, their fellow Waterdhavians never recognized or used these titles of House Yeldred.\nBy the late 15 century DR there were still only three stone keeps on the land, with the rest of it being untamed wilderness. One of them was maintained by garrison the Yeldreds paid with chapbooks, companions, food and strong drink. The other two had been seized by brigands. Those two keeps periodically switched hands between brigands and monsters, each of them slaying the other for control."
