County Valashar, or Lathmarch, was known as the "Gate to the Highlands" of Tethyr. Located roughly in the southern reaches of the historic kingdom of the same name, Valashar had a large population of monsters.
Valashar was one of the Golden Marches.
The county rose high above sea level, over 2,000 feet (600 meteres), and was at the highest elevation of any other region of Tethyr. The Tethir Road passed through its lands.
In 1370 DR, the Siegelord of Tethyrs armies, Count Holver Roaringhorn ruled Valashar from the manor of Tannithall.
After the defection of Riatavin from Amn to Tethyr in 1370 DR, the county grew in size. It also grew in unrest, as the queen ordered many of her troops into that county in case war with Amn could not be averted.
