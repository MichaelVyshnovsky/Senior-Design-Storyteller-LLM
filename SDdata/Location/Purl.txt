Purl was a pirate haven along the coast of the Great Sea in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
The name of the village a bastardization of "pearl", derived from the gem having been frequently used by visitors to pay off their expenses.
Purl was located in the nation of Dambrath, in the Shining South region of south Faer√ªn, on the Hethar Peninsula. Nestled between some hills and sporting only a small, sheltered harbor, the village was partially hidden from view by sea and to the north.
The village was a lawless place, where fighting was an expected part of life. It was nominally under the jurisdiction of Dambraths matriarchal monarchy, but went untended by the Crinti.
This shanty town had a wide selection of beer halls, boarding houses, brothels, and gambling dens. Its merchant primarily catered to the unsavory corsairs and privateers who made their living plying the Great Sea around Dambrath. Following the overthrow of the Crinti in the late 15 century DR, it was not uncommon for the nomadic human clans of Dambrath to sometimes visit Purl to engage in trade.
The legendary Captain Jape "One-Eye" Belson fled to Purl after having allegedly buried his treasure somewhere on the Isle of Quelthiir, but was eventually captured.
In the , native human Dambrathans rose up in rebellion against the Crinti and drove them from the land. Having been left ignored by the Crinti for much of its existence, Purl came out from the conflict unscathed.
In 1373 DR, the living population of Purl numbered over 400. By 1479 DR, this number had doubled to 800. In addition to residents, the village was frequently host to visiting fortune-hunters and other grizzled sea veterans. Prior to the monarchys overthrow, over half of the visiting sailors at any one time were in service to one of the Crinti nobility.
