        "History": "When Thay had been a [[Mulhorand]]i colony, around 1000 years before [[Dale Reckoning]], Delhumide was one of its greatest cities and bastions of power. When the [[Red Wizards]] rebelled, they destroyed the town, using the darkest sort of sorcery to accomplish their task.\n\nIn [[1375 DR]], the ground where the city's ruins still stood was still unclean. [[Demons]] walked there and a man could suffer from madness or leprosy just by venturing there. Shattered battlements and toppled towers could be seen though many of the buildings remained essentially intact."
