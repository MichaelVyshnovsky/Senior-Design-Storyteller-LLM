        "mainbody": "elhumide was a city in the tharch of the same name, located in northeastern Thay.\nWhen Thay had been a Mulhorandi colony, around 1000 years before Dale Reckoning, Delhumide was one of its greatest cities and bastions of power. When the Red Wizards rebelled, they destroyed the town, using the darkest sort of sorcery to accomplish their task.\nIn 1375 DR, the ground where the citys ruins still stood was still unclean. Demons walked there and a man could suffer from madness or leprosy just by venturing there. Shattered battlements and toppled towers could be seen though many of the buildings remained essentially intact."
