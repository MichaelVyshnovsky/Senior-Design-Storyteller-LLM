        "Description": "Thasselen was a walled city with a main keep. The city was encircled by a number of small fortresses.",
        "Geography": "The city lay on the coast of the [[Wizards' Reach]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] south of the [[Yuirwood]].",
        "Trade": "The city specialized in farming, fishing, and a small amount of caravan trade,",
        "History": "Thasselen was initially founded by the empire of [[Unther]] following the great wars between [[Narfell]] and [[Raumathar]], but over the passage of time Unther lacked the strength to hold it and Thasselen was controlled by [[Thay]] for centuries before eventually gaining independence.\n\nThasselen was destroyed in the [[Salamander War]] due to a plot hatched by [[Hargid Tenslayer]] and his allies in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}.\n\nThe burned-out remains of the city were given to [[Aznar Thrul]] after the death of Hargid Tenslayer, Thrul treated Thasselen and its surviving citizens as his own personal possessions. The people were frequently terrorized or killed both by random monsters wandering in through the broken walls as well as by Thrul's [[gnoll]] garrison, who captured and tortured them in the central keep. [[Slaver]]s and [[Red Wizards]] in need of test subjects were also given free access to the city. Attempting to leave the ruined city was considered a serious crime, and efforts to smuggle out important citizens or children were met with brutal punishment, including the use of the ''[[flensing]]'' spell.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the city's population had been reduced to half of what it had been prior to the Salamander War just a decade prior. Thasselen came to be considered a major Thayan port on the Sea of Fallen Stars. By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, it was regarded as a major settlement but remained quite poor."
