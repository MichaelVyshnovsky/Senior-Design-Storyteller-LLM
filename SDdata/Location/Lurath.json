        "Geography": "Lurath sat near the center of the Pirate Isles along the [[Windrace]] and the northern edge of [[the Bowl]].",
        "Description": "Lurath covered roughly {{SI|20|sq mi|long=yes}} of area. This island stood apart from the other islands of the Pirate Isles in that it had very little lowlands. Most of Lurath's coast was dominated by sheer cliff faces. The cliffs actually concealed a circular valley and tropical paradise at Lurath's heart.",
        "Inhabitants": "Though few outsiders ever saw them, Lurath was populated by primitive [[elvish]] creatures. They were quite friendly. Several types of dangerous [[dinosaur]] lived in the valley as well.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Access to the tropical valley in the center of the island was only possible through a series of caves. However, passing through the caves actually brought travelers back in time to a primitive age before humans. Anyone attempting to leave the valley by any means other than the caves found they were trapped in a primitive time period ruled by [[dragon]]s."
