Aloushe was a secretive and independent realm of dryads in the forests of Cormyr.
The realm lay somewhere not far east of Waymoot in the Kings Forest.
At some point during his time as Royal Magician, Vangerdahast discovered the realm via his long-range scrying magic. He delivered a challenge to the inhabitants that was answered by Queen Radanathe, who asserted her realms independence from Cormyr.
