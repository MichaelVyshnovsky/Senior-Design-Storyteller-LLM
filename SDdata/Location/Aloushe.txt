'''Aloushe''' was a secretive and independent realm of [[dryad]]s in the forests of [[Cormyr]].

==Geography==
The realm lay somewhere not far east of [[Waymoot]] in the [[King's Forest]].

==History==
At some point during his time as Royal Magician, [[Vangerdahast]] discovered the realm via his long-range ''[[scrying]]'' magic. He delivered a challenge to the inhabitants that was answered by Queen [[Radanathe]], who asserted her realm's independence from Cormyr.
