        "Description": "The Court District was the wealthiest section of Huzuz. It encompassed the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne|royal palace]] and had a splendid view of the [[Golden Mosque]].\n\nSince anyone of note, and wealth, desired to live in the Court District, the influx of inhabitants caused builders to elevate their construction in the form of beautiful towering minarets that could be found throughout this section of the city.\n\nThe Court District was virtually surrounded by many other districts; including the [[Craft District]] to the north, the [[East District]] to the east, the [[Affluent District]] to the south, and the [[Pilgrims' District]] to the west. \n\nMajor roads within the Court District included:\n* the [[Street of the Inns]]\n* the [[Palace Lane]]\n* the [[Avenue of Wealth]]\n* the [[Street of the Ajami]]\n* the [[Caravan Boulevard|Ghost's Route]]",
        "Activities": "This district housed a myriad of personalities including wealthy merchants, mysterious [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]], and nobles of the court.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Assad Bazaar]]\n* [[Lair of the Unspeakable]]\n* [[White Agate's Tower]]\n* [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]]"
