The Isle of the Long Legged and Long Armed was a tiny island in the Outer Isles of Wa in Kara-Tur.
The island was known for its very strange inhabitants. The race abiding there was composed of extremely tiny individuals, persons achieving a height of no more than an inch (a couple centimeters). Moreover, they all had (relatively) long legs (twice the length of their bodies) and long arms that drooped all the way to the ground&mdashhence the name of the island.
The inhabitants of the island were known among mainland Wa as superb artists their tiny paintings were prized and highly valued among the rich.
Ionoi, an advisor to the daimyo of Kurahito, was a refugee from the Isle of the Long Legged and Long Armed, having been banished from his home for having legs that were too short.
