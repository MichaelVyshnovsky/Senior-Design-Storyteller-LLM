'''Sukyo''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. Its people were primarily weavers.

==Description==
Perhaps because they had suffered much in raids from yellow-robed attackers sent by [[Za-Jikku]], the people of Sukyo were especially suspicious of strangers and refused to allow any to enter their settlement, even to the point of screaming at outsiders and chasing them away.

Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.

The hamlet had a population of about 290 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.

==Geography==
Sukyo was located at the far northern end of the Fochu Peninsula, where it connected to the mainland of [[Tsukishima]] west of the [[Jufosu Range]] of mountains. A trail from Sukyo led through the hills south to the city of [[Jasuga]].

==Government==
Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]], and Sukyo was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' of Sukyo after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was [[Katasuma Tandanobu]].

==Trade==
Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Sukyo had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The people were weavers, but there is no evidence that they actively traded their goods with other settlements.

If, by some miracle, one was allowed to enter the village, the cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 2 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 2 [[yuan]] to sell.

==Defenses==
About 29 citizens of Ushirilin served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.

==Religion==
Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Sukyo were not particularly religious.

==History==
Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Sukyo suffered especially severely from Za-Jikku's raids.
