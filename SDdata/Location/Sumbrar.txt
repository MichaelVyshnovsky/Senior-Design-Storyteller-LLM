Sumbrar was an island located near Evermeet.
Sumbrar was the headquarters for the military and navy of Evermeet. The island was home to mighty magical fortresses, interconnected with each other.
Sumbrar was a rocky island  to the east of Evermeet. A complicated network of tunnels permeated the island. Large sea caves were found on the coasts of the island.
Sumbrar was a fortress and home base to the fleet of Evermeet. Within the tunnels of the islands were barracks that housed up to a thousand warriors. Also based on the island were the aerial forces of Evermeet. The elven aerial troops were housed there along with their giant eagle and pegasus mounts. The navy harbored their ships within massive sea caves.
The island was also home a small flotilla of six spelljammers. These spelljammers, called Ruathimaer, were used to defend Evermeet from attacks from Realmspace.
The island was devastated during the Spellplague, when Evermeet was dragged into the Feywild.
Found deep under the island were twelve ancient dragons five bronze dragons, four silver dragons and three gold dragons. They, and the warriors who flew them, were in a dreamless sleep, defended from external threats and hidden from observation with powerful magic. Since they could only be awakened once, they were only summoned if the need was dire.
