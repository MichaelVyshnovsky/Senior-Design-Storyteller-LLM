'''Maiden's Glade''', also known as '''Eridis''' in the language of [[Illefarn]], was a glade near the [[Mere of Dead Men]] along the [[Sword Coast North]]. 

==Geography==
Located between [[Fort Locke]] and [[Highcliff]], Maiden's Glade was a clearing and a retreat for [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, [[animal]]s, or any traveler.

==Inhabitants==
The inhabitants were [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, and animals, who protected this place.

==History==
Around [[1374 DR]], the glade was where druids and rangers would protect the land from intruders. However, the [[King of Shadows]]' influence had an impact on the land, causing the local druid [[Kaleil]] to be trapped and enraged in the form of a [[bear]], allowing the animals to attack travelers and intruders. The [[Kalach-Cha]], paired with [[Elanee]], could attack Kaleil and learn of the shadow presences in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] before Kaleil died.
