        "mainbody": "The '''Fang''' was a large promontory extending north into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] from [[Aglarond]].",
        "Geography": "It was a mostly barren and rocky piece of land that jutted out from the northern coast of Aglarond, marking the beginning of the [[Sea of Dlurg]]. The area was battered by storms almost constantly, and seas were often violent. Reefs surrounded the coastline.",
        "Government": "The Fangers ruled themselves, wanting nothing to do with the [[Royal Council of Aglarond]], but were still considered Aglarondan citizens.",
        "History": "The Fang came to prominence in history after the humans of [[Velprin]] were defeated by the [[half-elves]] of the [[Yuirwood]] in the 1060s by [[Dalereckoning]]. While the majority of the defeated humans who rejected half-elven rule would soon found [[Altumbel]], a few hundred went north instead to settle the Fang.",
        "Inhabitants": "\"Fangers\" was a derogatory term given to the human inhabitants of the Fang. The vast majority of them were descendents of the wave of migrants from the fall of Velprin. [[Aquatic elf|Sea elves]] had several villages among the coastal reefs.<ref>",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Structures": "* [[Fang Light]]: A lighthouse at the northern tip of the Fang.",
            "Settlements": "* [[Dhast]]\n* [[Findar]]"
        },
        "Rumors and Legends": "Some of the younger Fangers had allegedly begun expressing a desire to reject their countrymen's disdain of wider Aglarond in [[1368 DR]], which both gladdened and worried the [[Simbul]] as she was concerned that their efforts may have stirred up the older generations against the region's half-elves.<ref>"
