The '''Rhygn burial mounds''' were a pair of artificial hills in the [[Kingdom of Mertwig]] that acted as the resting place of the conquered [[Rhygn]] civilization.

==Description==
The two burials were known individually as '''Acme''' and '''Heaptop'''. The area around them emanated a palpable aura of pain and suffering. They were encircled by a large ring of [[standing stone]]s, referred to collectively as the "Monolith". These stones were somewhat [[magical]] in nature, as sometimes interacting with them could cause a [[spellcaster]] to gain knowledge of new [[spell]]s.

==History==
Following the bloody war between the Rhygn and the father of the future king [[Mertwig]], these mounds were constructed to house the bodies of the Rhygn's [[warrior]]s and their king. Decades later, the mounds were considered a holy site. Some would make offerings of [[gold piece]]s or [[weapon]]s in hopes of receiving a blessing from the [[spirit]]s of the Rhygn. However, these offerings sometimes angered the spirits and they would strike back at the offer-giver with a deadly [[curse]].

When King Mertwig was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth, searching even the burial mounds.
