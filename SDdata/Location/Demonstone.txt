The '''Demonstone''' was the focus of initiation rites conducted by the [[Fraternity of Tharos]] in [[Impiltur]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The stone was inscribed with the names of various [[demon]]s, all of which were written in fire. Those who wished to be inducted into the Fraternity of Tharos had to kidnap and sacrifice an innocent victim in a bloody [[ritual]] while calling out these names.

The Demonstone was located within a bland, gray, and windowless tower somewhere in [[New Sarshel]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the tower housing the Demonstone was filled with demonic horrors.
