        "mainbody": "Kront was a small crossroads settlement and trade outpost situated where the Great Road intersected with the Cold Road on the plains of Ashanath in the Unapproachable East. It was repudiated by the nearby nations of Thesk, Rashemen, and the tribes of Narfell, and was thus considered a part of the Great Dale.\nBecause of the terrible storms that came off Lake Ashane numerous times a year, all of the structures in Kront were built with cellars in which to to take shelter.\nKront was situated on the eastern end of the  long Great Road, on the western shore of Lake Ashane.\nIt was located about  south of the ruins of Shandaular.\nConsidering the crossroads town was a neutral locale at a site nestled between several different nations and powers, it made an ideal location for traders to stop along their journeys. Kronts residents traded their wares and provided services for these road-weary merchants. They traded goods such as hake, trout, and salmon from Lake Ashane along with smoked meats.\nThe independent settlement remained strong even after enduring numerous raids from the Nars horsemen of nearby Narfell.\n* Lord Chinilvur, the wealthiest man in town that claimed descendance from Impilturan nobility.\n* Durtentan Palander, head of the local ranger group.\n* Xander Capstal, captain of the local militia."
