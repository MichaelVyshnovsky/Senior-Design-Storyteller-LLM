The foul clouds and the dark pools of water were the direct result of the alchemical experimentation of the fomorian coven of witches.\nCirca the , a number of Iliyanbruen elves of New Sharandar became trapped in the Horrid Mire, during the conflict that arose between their people and the army of Malabog.\nKehl Skywatcher worked with some adventurers from Neverwinter to rescue her fellow elves. She concocted a unique potion that could actually reverse the putrid clouds permeating the swamp, as well as undo with the effects they had on the trapped elves."
