        "mainbody": "Talung was a town in Tabot.\nIt stood in the middle of an open plain on the road between Chophon and Motra, and near the border with Shou Lung.\nIn , several small villages south of Talung were menaced by a man-eating tiger. Though a bounty was put on its head, it cunningly escaped all the hunters. People began to fear it was a magical creature, even a spirit or god disguise and bringing divine retribution.\nNako Nang, a merchant adventurer and wu jen, had a small house in Talung but was often away. A servant minded the house and was well-paid and happy."
