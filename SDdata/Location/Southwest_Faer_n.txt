Southwest Faerûn lay along the great Chultan Peninsula that jut out toward the west of south Faerûn. The surrounding waters included the northern Shining Sea, a body bounded by Calimshan to the north and joined to the Lake of Steam through the Strait of Storms, and the southern Great Sea, that seperated the region from the continent of Zakhara.
This region of dense jungles lay at the western edge of the Chultan peninsula, where the Shining Sea joined the oceans to the west. It was a swamp-filled land with wild beasts such as dinosaurs, Ubtao-worshiping tribes, and wealthy merchant-princes that founded a great city that attracted adventurers from across the Realms.
Before its destruction, known as the Lapal League, ruled over by hereditary monarchs. It was home to hard-working, yet somewhat barbaric folks that detested serpent-kind and took honor and proper behavior very seriously. Duels were common, as were feuds between families. Each of the cities in this land had a different patron deity whom its residents worshiped above all others.
This was a secretive land at the eastern edge of the jungles of Chult about which little was known.
This coastal land on the southern shore of the Shining Sea was the home to wealthy merchants and craftspeople that dwelled at the edge of the Black Jungle to the south. The capital city of Tashluta and the surrounding waters were protected by a strong fleet of ships. Malevolent serpentfolk like the Yuan-ti infiltrated the Realms cities, striking out from the surrounding jungles.
Before its near-entire destruction, the grasslands of Thindol were home to fleet-footed tribes of humans and its neighboring mountain ranges were home to clans of dwarves.
