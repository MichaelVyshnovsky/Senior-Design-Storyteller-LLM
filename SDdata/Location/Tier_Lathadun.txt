'''Tier Lathadun''' was a little-known location in the [[Underdark]] that hid treasure-filled [[undead]]-infested ruins.

==History==
Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a [[tiefling]] explorer named [[Pasi]] discovered the ruins in Tier Lathadun and quickly enriched herself. However, despite her successes, Tier Lathadun became Pasi's tomb. She died plummeting a thousand feed off a slippery edge along with her favorite [[enchanted]] weapon called ''[[Doorknocker]]''.
