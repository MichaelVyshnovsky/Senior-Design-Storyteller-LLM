'''Darrawn''' was the capital and only proper city of the nation of [[Fimbrul]], on [[Laerakond]]. It was inhabited only by [[earth giant]]s and their [[galeb duhr]] servants.

==Background==
The [[giant]]s of Darrawn spent their time hunting in the caverns and valleys of the [[Howling Mountains]], while waging war against [[dragon]]s, the [[oni]] and their [[orc]]s servants, and rebel groups of galeb duhrs.

==Architecture==
Darrawn's structures were coaxed from natural rock instead of just built in, and the homes of Fimbran giants were wonderful caves full of rock draperies, silica falls, glowing crystalline stalactites, and other wonders made of stone.

==Trivia==
A typical [[abeir]]an giant drink, the [[gulluk]], originated in Darrawn.
