Many waterfalls flowed from an unseen source inside the earthmote and fell into Lower Breen, creating a curtain of mist. New Breen was said to be designed after Breen, a genasi city located in Shyr, a realm on their homeworld of Abeir.\nNew Breen was inhabited mostly by genasi.\nNew Breen was a prosperous city thanks to its port, located in Lower Breen, that served as a bridge between west and east Akan没l."
