'''Elbencort''' was a [[gnome]] village in extreme eastern [[Tethyr]] ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. It was a settlement of many small cottages that dotted the hillsides surrounded by small farms and vegetable gardens.

==Geography==
Elbencort was located on the [[Tethir Road]] east of [[Riatavin]] where it forded the [[Shining Stream]] on the border between County [[Valashar (county)|Valashar]] and County [[Morninggold]].

Elbencourt was among the gnome settlements linked through the [[magic]]al transportation network known as the [[Trail of Mists]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}

==Trade==
This small village was self-sufficient and humble in its understated wealth. Some residents sold various [[gem]]s to the merchants that passed through town, offering them at the high end of the usual price range and seemingly without need to bargain. It was a well-kept secret that Elbencorters got their gems from trade with the [[deep gnome]] city of [[Kolethloe]], nearly four miles (just over six kilometers) below Elbencort.

==Defenses==
The town had little in the way of defenses, but was under the protection of County Morninggold and perhaps the patrols from the baronies of [[Carrelath]] and [[Impresk]]. Carrelath had a garrison in the area to protect the upper Shining Stream and Impresk guarded their portion of the Tethir Road.

==Rumors & Legends==
[[Elminster]] acknowledged that the gnomes might have been bold enough to lie to him about Kolethloe. The story may have been fabricated or "Kolethloe" had a different meaning that what he was told, but the gnomes got their gems from somewhere.
