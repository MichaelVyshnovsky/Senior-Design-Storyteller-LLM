        "mainbody": "Scornubel (), also known as the Caravan City, was a major tradestop for caravans. It lay on the northern bank of the River Chionthar, where the Trade Way reached the river.\nIts population was made up of many races and could increase by between six and eight times during the summer.\nthumb|right|250px|A map of Scornubel in 1358 DR.\nThe river was populated by barges, narrowboats, and skiffs, which made their way west as far as Baldurs Gate southeast along the Chionthar to Berdusk and northeast along the River Reaching to Hills Edge.\nA person from Scornubel was known as a Scornubian or Scornubrian.\nThe southern part of Scornubel was once a rival city known as Zirta, until it was conquered in the War of Lords.\nIn the years immediately after the Spellplague of 1385 DR, trade across Faer√ªn ground to a halt and Scornubels fortunes plummeted. The city saved itself by allowing its annexation by Elturgard.\nIn the 14th century DR, the city was ruled by Lady Rhessajan Ambermantle, three Lord High Advisors who were formerly merchants, and an additional council of merchants.\nBecause there was so much trade passing through the city, many buildings and businesses changed hands rapidly, meaning that the city did not have many permanent landmarks. All year round, many inhabitants slept in their caravans or simply out in the open, using a bale of hay as bedding, rather than paying for a bed in more comfortable accommodation.\nTraditional entertainment consisted of mock battles between humans and monsters, monsters trained to dance or perform, or monsters that participated in comedy or spellcasting. Occasionally these monsters could break free and turn on the audiences.\nIn the past, Scornubel was raided by bugbears and hobgoblins. These raids were more likely during the winter months. The city had problems with thieves and doppelgangers. Creatures like doppelgangers and lamias were tolerated in the city because of their special powers, and the city was used as a meeting place for illithids and yuan-ti, when the Underdark or Skullport were not suitable.\nOfficial Buildings\n* Scornubel Hall stood on the east side of the Trade Way and was the seat of government. The door warden was named Eljan.\n* The Red Shields office.\n* The Free Traders of Scornubel offices.\nReligious Buildings\n* The Healing House of Lathander was a temple to Lathander, the citys only temple.\n* The High Holy House of Coin, a temple to Waukeen in northeasternmost Scornubel, fully funded and erected in the late 1490s DR.\nTrade Buildings\n* The citys harbor was muddy and on the west side, there was a fish market and a ferry dock from where the Southdock Ferry sailed.\n* The smithy ran by Kaerus Thambadar was on the east side of the harbor.\n* The shipwright Arkarass yards were also on the east side of the harbor.\n* Trail Lords headquarters.\n* Highmoon trading coster\n* The Windriders trading coster\n* Purple Sun trading coster\n* Tallahabur the wagonmaker\n* Surefeet Trademasters headquarters\n* Stag Caravan Company headquarters\n* The Spice & Wine Shop\n* Malikhar the Outfitter\n* Angah Lallas shop\n* Thyumdars Reliquary &amp Eremosckh (general store).\n* The Everfull Jug winery.\n* Ehaevaeras Beauty Rooms\n* Ssimbars Fine Clothes\n* Preszmyr the Herbalist\nClubs, Inns and Taverns\n* Mother Minxs was a festhall in the city\n* The Nightshade nightclub\n* The Dusty Hoof inn and tavern\n* Far Anchor inn\n* The Jaded Unicorn inn and tavern\n* The Raging Lion inn and tavern\n* The Serpents Tooth inn and tavern\n* The Thirsty Thunder Beast tavern\n* The Travelers Rest inn\n* The Fishym & Smoka Inn\n* The Randy Wench tavern and gaming room\n* The Jesters Bells tavern, festhall and baths\n* Thruus Way Rooms and Dining inn\nRoads and Streets\n* Far Rider Street\n* Northstorm Street\n* Red Shields Road\n* Stumblepost Trail\n* Trade Way\n* The Walk\n* Lady Rhessajan Ambermantle, ruler of Scornubel\n* Angah Lalla, a fence and curios dealer\n* Laertilus, a sage specializing in lost treasures\n* Vaerum, the Master Thief and one time head of a local thieves guild"
