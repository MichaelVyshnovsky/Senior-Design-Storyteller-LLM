The '''Well of Mimir''' was a legendary magical well in [[Jotunheim]], one of the layers of the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]], that was said to be a source of unlimited knowledge.{{Cite dragon/90/Plane Facts on Gladsheim|37}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|31}}

==Location==
This well was located near one of the roots of [[Yggdrasil]], One of the hills had a large cavern inside of it and the root reached into the Well itself, which had the appearance of a streambed and was encircled by pile of stones as tall as most [[human]]s or [[demihuman]]s. The surrounding area was mostly barren and devoid of [[animal]] life, host to but a few scraggly weeds and stunted [[pine]]s.

==Powers==
Drinking the waters of this well was said to increase one's wisdom. [[Spell key]]s could also be obtained from the well, each tied to either a specific [[spell]] or [[plane of existence]].

To drink from the well garnered a steep price to its guardian, requiring either the offering of an eye, a hand, a heart, or some other form of living sacrifice for each question. Alternatively, one could pay with a [[favor coin]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|11-13}} A sacrificed eye could not be restored for no less than a ''[[wish]]'' spell, though its restoration would cause the individual to lose whatever knowledge they had gained from the Well for it.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|37}} The head of the [[Norse pantheon]], [[Odin]], was said to have only one eye because he sacrificed the other in return for gaining secret knowledge from the well.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] went on an epic journey across [[Asgard]], Jotunheim, and Yggdrasil in search of the Well of Mimir so they could learn how to destroy a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} Their benefactors, the [[Ministry of Art]], knew little about the Well's guardian but said that the knowledge the Well held was far greater than that contained within the halls of [[Candlekeep]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
The well was guarded by [[Mimir (giant)|Mimir the Wise]], an immensely powerful [[mountain giant]] who lived in the hill with a cave. He stopped all who would attempt to steal the well's power keys or drink from its waters without proper payment. Those who weren't a powerful [[giant]] or [[deities]] of the Norse pantheon were usually killed for bothering him, though he was willing to do business with anyone that presented him a favor coin.

==Rumors & Legends==
* Duke [[Rowan Darkwood]], a long time inhabitant of Toril, claimed to have drunk from this well.<ref>
* According to the legends of the Norse pantheon, Odin buried the head of [[Mimir (deity)|Mimir]] the god beneath this well after it was cut from the Norse god's body and that his great wisdom imparted upon the well's water.
