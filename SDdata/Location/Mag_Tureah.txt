'''Mag Tureah''' was a country-sized cavern fortress in the depths of the Feydark.

==Geography==
Mag Tureah contained many structures, particularly [[iron]] towers. Due to the vast amount of [[gem]]s on an [[onyx]] backset all around the cavern, it looked just like the clear night sky. The onyx stone was sculpted into pillars, curtains, and buildings. This fortress was the home of the [[fomorian]] king, [[Bres]].

Mag Tureah was described as a maze of iron and stone, which was odd for a fomorian stronghold. The fortress held countless ''[[portal]]s'' to and from [[Toril]]. They opened, closed and collapsed at any time, meaning a bold adventurer could be trapped on a world which wasn't their own. More than one of these adventurers was unlucky enough to go through a portal to Mag Tureah, only to become a slave to the fomorians.
