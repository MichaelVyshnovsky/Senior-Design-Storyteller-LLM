The Maw was a harbor located in Skullport.
The Maw was located on the eastern coast of Skull Island. Its name derived from its resemblance to the gaping mouth of a great beast and the ominous implication that those who enter were effectively being consumed. The Maw was lined with multiple wooden docks, while recessed staircases wound their way up the sheer black stone walls of the harbor. At the top of these walls, large hoists were installed, designed to efficiently lift cargo to the courtyard beyond. During the unloading process, numerous guards in splint mail kept a vigilant watch, armed with heavy crossbows and tridents to ensure security.
To safeguard the harbor from unauthorized departures and potential marine assaults, the Iron Ring has installed steel hull augers across the entrance of the harbor. These mechanisms, controlled by massive chains connected to winches located in the towers on either side of the harbor, were designed to dig into the hulls of passing ships when activated. The augers then flooded the lower decks, effectively immobilizing the vessel and preventing its escape. Several shipwrecks resting at the bottom of Skull Pool served as a testament to the destructive capability of these devices.
