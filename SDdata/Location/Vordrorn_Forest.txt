The '''Vordrorn Forest''' was a small forest at the base of the [[Ice Mountains]], north of the fork. It was sometimes referred to as the '''Ghostwood''', owing to the large number of incorporeal [[undead]] that seemed bound to it. Nearby areas of interest included [[Adbar Road]], [[Ascore]], and [[Fork Road]].

==Description==
As of around [[1372 DR]], the forest was seldom explored, and it was usually shrouded in chilly mist. The forest lay on top of caverns and dungeons dating back to ancient [[Illusk]]. At one time, a cult of [[sorcerer]]s, death-priests, and warriors practiced evil rituals in the forest, leaving behind black stone towers and crypts, protected by curses and magical wards.

As of 1372 DR, at least one [[doomsphere]] (a ghostly beholder) was known to inhabit this area. It was also inhabited by [[ghost]]s, [[spectre]]s, and [[wraith]]s.

==Flora==
The Vordrorn Forest was mainly pine trees and [[wikipedia:muskeg|muskeg bogs]].
