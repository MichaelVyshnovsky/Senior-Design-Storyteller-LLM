'''Sapra''' was the only port city on the isle of [[Ilighôn]] of the [[Eyes of Silvanus]], in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], off the shores of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

{{Quote|''The price they offered was so outrageous that I followed the owner back to his home to take a look at this mansion. The man's house was nice, but quite small, probably less than 1,000 square feet. I couldn't imagine anyone paying that much for a house. I decided to do some investigating. The first place I looked was the city hall. What I found there was shocking virtually every home sold in the last ten years had gone for outlandish prices. I also found the cause&mdash;no new building permits had been issued for that same amount of time. But, I still wondered why.''|Excerpt from [[Adamar Session]]'s guide to the Vilhon Reach}}

==Description==
Sapra was the only port on the entire island. The city was calm, quiet, and possibly, the cleanest settlement in all of [[Faerûn]].

The city welcomed those who wanted to flee oppression by wizards. Sapra aided refugees from the lands ruled by spell-casting tyrants, and its inhabitants even included several "retired" [[Red Wizards]] who fled [[Thay]]. The island's magics shielded the ex-wizards from Thayan ''[[divination]]s''.

==Geography==
[[File:VilhonReach3e.png|thumb|''The location of Sapra off the shores of the [[Vilhon Reach]].''|320x320px]]
Sapra stood on a small bay on the southeast of Ilighôn, directly in front of the cape passage gap in the reefs of [[Eldath's Ring]] that encircled the island. The [[Great Forest]] and [[Mielikki's Garden]] surrounded the city on land, while its harbors were awash with waters of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] through the [[Strait of Silvanus]] and the [[Farshore Straits]]. The [[Hierophant trail]] led from the city of Sapra towards the [[Oakenhall]], or the [[House of Silvanus]] at the heart of the island.

==Government==
The city of Sapra was ruled and guarded by the [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Enclave]] who venerated both [[Silvanus]] and [[Eldath]]. Not a single unwanted nor unwelcome visitor was allowed to enter the harbors of Sapra under the druids' watchful eye. Direct rulership of Sapra was in the hands of a council of six elders whose position on the council was a part-time job. The council met as the need arose, usually once a month. In the late-14{{th}} century DR, the leader of the council was the local blacksmith, Mayor [[Thomas Flagcairn]].

The city of Sapra was mandated by the Emerald Enclave to control its size and population. In the late-14{{th}} century, Sapra's population was at 2,000 souls, pushing the Emerald Enclave's limits. Due to the number and growing size, the town's lodging and housing prices were on the rise as well. However, by the later parts of the 1370s DR, Sapra's population expanded dramatically to over 3,000 souls.

==Trade==
Sapra's export was humble and consisted mainly of foodstuff and various [[herb]]s, all produced by the island's lush forests. The slow trade only had a handful of merchant ships docking in Sapra every month. Because of that, most things not produced locally were valued highly. Locals spent a lot of time negotiating trades and bartering.

==Defenses==
[[File:Vilhon Reach woman.png|thumb|''An resident of Sapra overlooking the city.''|alt=|left]]
Sapra's harbors and waters surrounding the isle of Ilighôn were defended by the [[Seven Sentinels of Silvanus]], a group of [[Water elemental|water]] and [[air elemental]]s who pummeled unwanted visitors and washed ashore allies whose vessels suffered damage or drowning innocents. The Seven Sentinels also guided friendly ships across the perilous reefs of Eldath's Ring towards Sapra. Additionally, Sapra, just like the entirety of Ilighôn, was shrouded in the ''[[faith-magic zone]]'', a gift from [[Mystra]], goddess of magic, to Silvanus. While on the island, all [[arcane]] magic was negated, permanent and long-lasting spells fizzled out, and wizardly magic items stopped functioning.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Sapra had been peacefully existing under the control, protection, and policies of the Emerald Enclave for over 200 years. until Sapra was finally allowed to expand by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.

Everything changed with the advent of the [[Spellplague]] that reshaped the Vilhon Reach and drained the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Eyes of Silvanus were no longer islands, instead becoming the new edge of [[Turmish]] and later its only port city. In the 100 years that followed, the city's population exploded to more than double its size&mdash;8,500 souls included the locals, druids, and Turamis.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200224175103/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1231995991613673472| title = TheEdVerse on Twitter| accessdate = 27-12-2021| date = 27-12-2021}}

==Notable Locations==
* '''City Hall''', the place for the council's gathering, center of the city's bureaucracy, and archives.
* The [[Dazzling Dolphin]], an expensive and clean inn that charged ten times the average for lodgings.
* The [[Temple of Tempus (Sapra)|Temple of Tempus]], a large temple dedicated to the Lord of Battles.
* The '''Shrine to Eldath''', one of the few small places of worship in the city.
