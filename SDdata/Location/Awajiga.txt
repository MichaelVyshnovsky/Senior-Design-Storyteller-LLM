'''Awajiga''' was a community of weavers and one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].

==Description==
The people of Awajiga were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. It had a population of about 350 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.

At that time, the leader of Awajiga was constructing a canal from the [[Nanaichi River]] to the south, hoping to improve the settlement's capacity to grow crops and improve the financial health of its citizens.

Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.

==Geography==
Awajiga was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of [[Tsukishima]], north of [[Fochu]], off a spur trail from the [[Hisano Road]].

==Government==
Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]], and Awajiga was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed. The ''shoya'' of Awajiga after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was [[Nasu Anteki]], an enterprising businessman who always wore a bright red [[kimono]].

==Trade==
Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Awajiga had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The people were weavers, but there is no evidence that they actively traded their goods with other settlements.

The cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 3 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 4 [[yuan]] to sell.

==Defenses==
About 35 citizens of Awajiga served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.

==Religion==
Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Awajiga were not particularly religious.

==History==
Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.

During the same time period, the village ran into problems with the [[Order of the Snake]],
