'''Talagbar''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] mine in eastern [[Vaasa]]. It was considered a "twin" of the [[Delhalls]] in western Vaasa.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Geography==
Talagbar was located in the [[Galena Mountains]] to the east of the road from [[Nigel's Ford]] to [[Palischuk]].

==History==
By the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], Talagbar had long been frozen under the [[Ice Run]] of the [[Great Glacier]], but was believed to be rich with deposits of [[bloodstone]], [[emerald]], [[ruby]], [[copper]], and [[iron]].

Around [[1372 DR]], melting at the edge of the Glacier exposed Talagbar along with its twin, the Delhalls. The two mines were said to be so rich in wealth that their discovery changed the culture of Vaasa, making its people more greedy.

As of the 15{{th}} century DR, the mines had been reopened.
