        "mainbody": "he Frozen Sea was one of the regions of Anauroch, the great desert of Faerûn, located on its western edge.\nThe Frozen Sea was the part of Anauroch lying west of the High Ice. Here, where that massive glacier ended gave rise instead to the hard ground of frozen sand. The place was a maze of natural sand sculptures, shaped by the wind and frozen by the cold. The area was void of any water or ice.\nIn springtime, life briefly appeared in the Frozen Sea, as low-growing ground plants briefly grew. During this time many varieties of birds would fly here to breed. Outside this narrow time, little life could be found here.\nBefore the magical formation of Anauroch, the great Narrow Sea filled this region. When the waters left, the basin that remained behind became the Frozen Sea.\n Ascore  The ruins of this dwarven port still contained ships of stone.\n Hlaungadath  This was one of the fallen cities of ancient Netheril.\n Oreme  This was once a Netherese port on the edge of the Narrow Sea.\n Spellgard  A grand castle located on a rocky ridge that was the abode of Lady Saharel, High Mage of Netheril.\nFRMer gelée\nCategoryDeserts\nCategoryLocations in Anauroch\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nqc2d6bk0rw6zstzx7ikv5ee4zsber52"
