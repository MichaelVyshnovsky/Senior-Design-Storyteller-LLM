        "mainbody": "The '''Frozen Sea''' was one of the regions of [[Anauroch]], the great desert of [[Faerûn]], located on its western edge.",
        "Description": "The Frozen Sea was the part of Anauroch lying west of the [[High Ice]]. Here, where that massive glacier ended gave rise instead to the hard ground of frozen [[sand]]. The place was a maze of natural sand sculptures, shaped by the wind and frozen by the cold. The area was void of any water or ice.",
        "Flora & Fauna": "In springtime, life briefly appeared in the Frozen Sea, as low-growing ground plants briefly grew. During this time many varieties of birds would fly here to breed. Outside this narrow time, little life could be found here.",
        "History": "Before the magical formation of Anauroch, the great [[Narrow Sea]] filled this region. When the waters left, the basin that remained behind became the Frozen Sea.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "[[Ascore]]": "The ruins of this [[Dwarf|dwarven]] port still contained ships of stone.",
            "[[Hlaungadath]]": "This was one of the fallen cities of ancient [[Netheril]].",
            "[[Oreme]]": "This was once a Netherese port on the edge of the Narrow Sea.",
            "[[Spellgard]]": "A grand castle located on a rocky ridge that was the abode of Lady [[Saharel]], High Mage of Netheril."
