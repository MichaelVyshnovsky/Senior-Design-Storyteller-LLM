}}'''Centaur Bridge''', also known as the '''Stone Village''', was a small town in [[Turmish]], just off the [[Halondar]].<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p37"/><ref name ="tVH:DMR-map">

==Description==
Centaur Bridge was named after a stone bridge that arched over a small pound located in the ancient deep [[Dancing Forest]].<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p37"/> <ref group="note">This forest is not visible on any source maps and is not mentioned in any other context other than the town of Centaur Bridge. This could mean that it was an especially small forest, or was perhaps a continuity error. The pond was a seasonal body of water that rose even spring and trickled away into distant sinkholes later.{{Cite polyhedron/104/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Country Treasures|7-8}} The town was surrounded by an ever-present, thick white mist. The town's other name, the Stone Village, came from the fact that all buildings in the Centaur Bridge made out of stone, as wood never lasted in the constant damp mist. The stone cottages where wrapped in [[creeper]]s and [[moss]].<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p37"/> The village's stables and homes stood close to the surrounding old woods. Even though Centaur Bridge was a small village, it had several taverns.

==Geography==
Centaur Bridge was adjacent to Halondar, also known as the Turmway, was a road that stretched from [[Alaghôn]] to [[Hlondeth]]. From Centaur Bridge one road veered north towards the town of [[Nonthal]]. The south route veered far south until it reached the town of [[Gildenglade]] and the [[Lake of Drifting Stars]].{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|20}}

==History==
Sometime ''circa'' [[1366 DR]], the adventuring [[Company of the Shining Stars]], backed by a wealthy [[Sembian]], explored the the vanished mansion's cellars. Reportedly, the adventurers awoken a "great evil" that devoured all members of the troupe apart from the group's [[rogue]] - [[Emanuel Foreister]]. The survivor claimed that a [[deepspawn]] or similar beast was unleashed as the adventurers opened an ancient sarcophagus within the cellars. Following this disastrous adventure, Emanuel Foreister returned to Centaur Bridge every year to pay respect to his perished friends.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p37" />

==Rumors and Legends==
Around [[1370 DR]], it was rumored that the tunnels beneath the vanished mansion hid vast treasure and unknowable dangers.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p37"/>

Like in many other places in the Realms, the Dancing Forest was rumored to hold undiscovered buried treasures left there by individuals on the run.

Another legend of a treasure told of riches hidden at the eastern end of Centaur Bridge. The treasures were believed to be hidden in a clearing only visible from [[horse]]back on a bright day and only if the rider knew where to look. Legends claimed that the clearing was haunted by a menagerie of [[ghost]]ly monsters. Some sages theorized that these ghosts were spellcreations of some [[wizard]] who himself was investigating the rumors of the treasure. The clearing was also said to be the entrance to the cellars of the vanished mansion.

==Notable Locations==
;The vanished mansion
:Sometime before [[1170 DR]], there was a mansion just outside of Centaur Bridge. The mansion was said to have belonged to a merchant from [[Alaghôn]] named [[Torst Habilar]]. Although the mansion was lost (in an unknown event), it left behind a network of cellars and tunnels.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p37"/>
;[[Sylvan Geyser]]
:This natural spring shot boiling water every hour. It attracted worshipers of [[Eldath]], tourists, and adventurers. As of 1370 DR, coins and gems had started to occasionally shoot out with the bursts of water. This lead to speculation about what might lie within the geyser.<ref name ="tVH:DMR-p38">
