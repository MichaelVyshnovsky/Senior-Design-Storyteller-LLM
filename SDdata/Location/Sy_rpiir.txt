'''Syòrpiir''' was an ancient kingdom of [[moon elves]] and [[sun elves]] created during the [[First Flowering]] in {{Yearlink|-23100}}.

==History==
Syòrpiir was drawn into the [[War of Three Leaves]] against [[Thearnytaar]] and [[Eiellûr]] by the actions of assassins and spies from [[Ilythiir]] in {{Yearlink|-17100}}.

In {{Yearlink|-11600}}, the kingdom was destroyed by the [[dark elf]] kingdom of Ilythiir during the second war of the [[Crown Wars]]. Over the years, the ruins of the [[elf|elven]] civilization were taken over by the [[Chondalwood]] and the [[Ankhwood]].
