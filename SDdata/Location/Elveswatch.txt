'''Elveswatch''' was a small city located in the [[Forest of Amtar|Forests of Amtar]] in [[Dambrath]].

==Geopgraphy==
The city was located along the southeastern fringes of the great forest. Elveswatch experienced more rainfall than any other settlement in Dambrath.

==Activities==
Most of the famed [[bluewood]] of Amtar moved through Elveswatch on its way to the rest of Dambrath.

The people of the city had to remain vigilant for the attacks from the [[elves]] who lived in the forest. The elves hoped that their attacks would dissuade deforestation, but the attacks did not hinder the bluewood enterprise.

==Armed Forces==
Elveswatch boasted a fighting force of 1,000 infantrymen, 500 cavalry, and 500 [[gnoll]] mercenaries.

==Inhabitants==
Five thousand transients populated Elveswatch. The chance of killing surface elves brought many [[drow]] to the city, more so than any other city in Dambrath. Because of this, [[Lolth]], and not [[Loviatar]] had the primary temple within the city.
