        "mainbody": "rashtide Alley was an alley located in Skullport.\nTrashtide Alley was one of the few alleyways in Skullport with a name. It was notorious for the large numbers of both giant and normal rats that gathered to feed on the refuse from nearby establishments such as the Burning Troll tavern, Findlewulfs Galley, and the Drowning Buoy. The scavenging rats were largely fearless, paying little attention to those who passed through the alley. However, it was widely believed that a family of wererats has established residence in the vicinity, driving off or infecting intruders who ventured too close."
