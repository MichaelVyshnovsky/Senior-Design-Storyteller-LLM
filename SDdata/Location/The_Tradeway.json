        "mainbody": "he Tradeway was a road in the Lower Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nThe Tradeway served as the primary and most expedient route into the deeper regions of Skullport. As the widest street within Skullport, it was constantly maintained, its cobblestones replaced by a labor force comprising enslaved workers and reanimated undead. Lining this prominent avenue were numerous permanent establishments offering a variety of goods and services, catering to the diverse demands of Skullportâ€™s denizens. In addition to these fixed businesses, merchants crowded the road with temporary stalls, carts, and even improvised displays of wares, often carrying additional items to sell directly from their person.\nCompetition among vendors was intense, and disputes over pricing and territory frequently escalated, sometimes resulting in skirmishes that provided onlookers with both cover and opportunity to pilfer from unattended goods.\nInevitably, the presence of commerce drew panhandlers, particularly as one approached the Lower Port. Along the Tradeway, beggars lined the route, many displaying visible signs of injury, illness, or neglect as they appealed for small change. Though some of these individuals genuinely suffered from misfortune, others are frauds, seeking to exploit the compassion of others to finance their own indulgences. Among these beggars were numerous pickpockets and petty criminals, who stalked potential victims with practiced patience, awaiting the right moment to strike from concealment. Many worked in coordinated groups, as a result the safest way to travel was in groups."
