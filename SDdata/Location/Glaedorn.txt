Glaedorn was a cave located somewhere in the Howling Mountains section of Fimbrul, Laerakond. The cave was full of rich veins of metal ores and huge gemstones.
It was believed that there were at least different six entrances to this cave, located in various points of the Howling Mountains. Some also believed that the gemstones were in fact the severed fingers of a primordial, because the gemstones moved on their own accord.
The cave was named for Glae Dorn, the presumed dwarf that first found the cave in ancient times.
