        "mainbody": "'''Citadel Rashturl''' was a [[Council Army]] fortress in the eastern [[Cloud Peaks]] of [[Amn]] paired with the nearby [[Citadel Amnur]], the two mightiest fortresses in the realm.",
        "Geography": "Citadel Rashturl was deep in the Cloud Peaks east of [[Lake Weng]], near the source of the [[Rashturiver]]. Citadel Amnur lay to the northwest, with the closest settlements being the town of [[Amnwater]] to the south and the villages on Lake Weng that included [[Edive]], [[Ideepton]], [[Shatar]], and [[Minsor Vale]]. The abandoned mining town of [[Orlsfall]] lay to the east across the mountains.",
        "Defenses": "The Citadel was accessed by a narrow mountain pass that included a {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} long drawbridge that crossed a chasm. The outer walls were functionally {{SI|400|ft|long=yes}} high, with the first {{SI|350|ft|long=yes}} comprised of carved and flattened mountainside. The top 50 feet were made of fitted stone and was 6-{{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} thick, topped with a 10-foot-wide walkway. About 700 soldiers and 20 officers were permanently assigned to the fortress, with additional space for another 1,500 troops if needed.",
        "History": "Citadel Rashturl was first built as a log fort in the {{YearlinkName|897}} in response to a decade of monster incursions, and was upgraded to a stone fortress in [[901 DR]]. The fortress was named after the famous general King [[Rashturl Torlath]], who fought against the [[Horned Mage]] in [[661 DR]]. It was periodically abandoned during long periods of peace but was regularly regarrisoned and upgraded as needed.\n\nCitadels Rashturl and Amnur were rebuilt in modern, identical designs shortly before [[1350 DR]] to head off the threat of [[baatezu]] and [[orc]] armies originating from [[Dragonspear Castle]]. Citadel Rashturl came to be held by Commander [[Reyni Delapond]], a famous hero of the [[First Dragonspear War]] whose intelligence and charisma made him an extremely effective leader. Under his influence, Citadel Rashturl's garrison became highly disciplined and well-trained, counted as the best soldiers in all of Amn. Despite the isolation and hardship of the posting, the Citadel was regarded as a \"pearl\" of a posting that any soldier would be happy to be assigned to, even higher than the famously popular garrison at [[Keczulla]].\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], the growing number of bandits under [[Timok the Tusk]] at Orlsfall threatened to win the attention of Citadel Rashturl's patrols.",
        "Inhabitants": "* Commander [[Reyni Delapond]], a skilled leader who instituted an outstanding training program.\n* [[Arbas Rosznar]], a prospective commander who was reassigned to [[Hillfort Keshla]] after killing a man.\n* [[Logan Coprith]], a soldier who later became High Merchant of [[Trademeet]]."
