        "mainbody": "The '''Tun Marshes''', also called the '''Marsh of Tun''', was a swamp lying in the [[Tunlands]] between the [[Sunset Mountains]] and the [[Stormhorns]] west of [[Cormyr]] in [[interior Faerûn]].",
        "Description": {
            "Climate": "The Tun marshes enjoyed moderate weather nearly all yearlong. While the hotter months of the year were rather uncomfortable, springtime brought forth a myriad of blooming flowers and lush greenery that were quite the sights to enjoy."
        },
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Originating in the [[Farsea Marshes]], the [[Tun River]] flowed south through the Tun Marshes, with few bends. The central portion of the river was bogged down into the low and densely vegetated marshland.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "A great variety of songbirds made their nests among the trees of the marsh, including redwing [[blackbird]]s, [[lark|meadowlarks]], [[goldfinch]]es, and [[swallow]]s."
        },
        "Trade": "The [[lizardfolk]] of the Tun Marshes developed an advanced trading system for their communities, where they bartered away all the unusable goods they accumulated in their raids to nearby traders in exchange for ''[[healing potion]]s''.",
        "History": "Like the Farsea Marshes, it was believed that the Tun Marshes were once home to an ancient civilization, one that boasted great architecture that remained standing after so many years.\n\nAt some point, a large obelisk made of stone was recovered from the Tun Marshes and brought over to the [[Dragon Coast]] city of [[Proskur]], where it became the centerpiece of the [[Standing Stone Inn]].\n\nThe marsh eventually joined with the Farsea Marshes some time after the [[Spellplague]] ravaged [[Faerûn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Together the two wetlands form the greater [[Farsea Swamp]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The region was home to many creatures both magical and mundane. But unlike the northern Farsea Marshes, the Tun Marshes were not populated by the same races of sentient beings. Instead it was home to the various lizardfolk tribes, and two known [[black dragon]]s, the deceased [[Constulgrael]], and the female wyrm known as [[Skurge]]. Other creatures that could be found within were [[basilisk]]s, [[catoblepas]], [[troll]]s,\n\nFew reputable humans called the Tun Marshes home.<ref group=\"note\">The 3{{rd}} edition ''[[Player's Guide to Faerûn]]'' erroneously states the [[Marsh Drover]]s lived in the Marsh of Tun, when in fact they dwelled in the [[Farsea Marshes]]. The [[Tun Bandits]] held significant numbers in the marsh during the mid–14{{th}} century DR, last recorded at or around 1000 bandits. The mostly-[[human]] bandits were outlawed refugees fleeing the justice of Cormyr, led by their \"king\", [[Thaalim Torchtower]]."
