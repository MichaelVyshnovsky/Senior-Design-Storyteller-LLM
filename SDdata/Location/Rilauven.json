        "mainbody": "Rilauven was a relatively small and young drow city in the Underdark in the 14 century DR.\nThe city was located under an area near the surface city of Neverwinter, likely in the Northdark. It was close to the illithid compound of Zhinda Citadel, which once belonged to the drow.\nRilauvens Lolthite priesthood was overthrown by the worshipers of Vhaeraun in a relatively bloodless coup. The city was thereafter ruled by a council of the representatives of its Sorcere, Belaessar, Melee-Quartha, and Ultrinnan Quellar, respectively, the academies of wizards, merchants, warriors, and old noble Houses. These houses included\n* House Despana\n* House Arabani\n* House Olonrae\n* House Leun\n* House Pharm\n* House Vaer\nAll drow members of its society, be they wizard, fighter, or cleric, were apparently treated the same, although the citys Archmage, Malavon Despana, who organized the coup, seemed to hold the most power and Vhaeraun was venerated above Lolth. \nIt was rumored that the Legion of the Chimera would attack Rilauven, and the Melee-Quartha were busy preparing battle defenses.\nApparently, the priests of Vhaeraun railed against civic battles. The Sorcere hoped that Menzoberranzan never decided to wipe them out.\n* Malavon Despana Archmage of the Sorcere.\n* Ginafae Despana Sister of Malavon, turned into a drider and returned to drow-form later.\n* Ilmryn Despana Deceased brother of Malavon.\n* Malfeem Despana Son of Malavon and former weapon master, deceased.\n* Dizreth Arabani\n* Viizra Arabani Priestess of Vhaeraun and Lolth, a Masked Traitor, First Daughter\n* Kadresh Olonrae A male drow cleric of Vhaeraun and seller of magic items\n* Valas Belaem del Pharm the half-drow who fought as a gladiator in Rilauven.\n* Tanthalyn Rrostarr A spy scouting Pirtelspace."
