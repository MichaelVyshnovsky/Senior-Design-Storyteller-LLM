        "mainbody": "Selûnarra, also known as Opus in Loross, was a Netherese enclave whose patron was Selûne. The citys population escaped the phaerimm and Karsuss Folly by the grace of Selûne in the .\nUnlike many of the other enclaves of ancient Netheril, the arcanists of Opus founded great magical universities, libraries, and other repositories of arcane knowledge, rather than the schools that were meant to allow spellcasters to gain additional power and personal knowledge. Residents of the enclaves eschewed such uncivilized practices such as public arenas or the allowance of spellcasting duels.\nThe enclave was founded in  by Chever, the famous mentalist that spent much of his life in pursuit of a spell that would allow him to reach out to other planes of existence. After his death in , other arcanists of Opus vied for leadership of the enclave. \nOver time, Selûnarra became home to some of the most well-renowned artists, performers, and scholarly minds that were known in ancient Netheril, and a favored cultural hotspot of the Netherese elites.\nIn the , Lady Arilain discovered that the arcanist Karsus was formulating some unknown spell of tremendous power and went to warn her colleagues in Selûnarra. She even went so far as to confront Karsus himself, but disappeared shortly thereafter.\nAt the moment of Netherils destruction in , just as Karsus began casting his great spell to seize the Weave, many residents of the enclave detected the oncoming danger and teleported to safety elsewhere in the world. They were scattered across Faerûn and faced incredible hardships as they were forced to survive in a hostile wilderness, with many of Netherils spiteful neighbors luxuriating in their doom. Of those who were not able to flee, Selûne took them up from their falling enclave and deposited them safely on a distant, unknown continent on Toril, where they proceeded to live comparatively simple lives with little magic as they built new homes in the uninhabited wilds. A few wished most of all to remain in their lost city, and so Selûne recreated the enclave within the Gates of the Moon for them to live in. While the original enclave was destroyed, the folk of Low Netheril who witnessed it presumed that the Selûnarrans had escaped through some means, and this became the commonly understood history, though the story grew in the telling to include the entire enclave being transported intact to Selûnes realm.\nCenturies later in the , the mortal avatars of gods were set against one another on the face of Faerûn. During the Time of Troubles, Selûne fought the goddess Shar in a great battle in Waterdeep and an artifact known as Selûnes Eye was left with Kyriani Agrivar, half-drow owner of the tavern Selûnes Smile. The artifact, which had the power to temporarily open portals to other planes, was eventually revealed by the goddess to be intended for a special ceremony known as the Ritual of the Waxing. \nIt was widely believed by scholars that Selûnarra had avoided the cataclysmic effects suffered by so many other enclaves during the event that came to be known as Karsuss Folly. Some legends spoke of how the goddess Selûne intervened directly in the enclaves salvation, and it was said that the entire population of Selûnarra had been transported to the Gates of the Moon, the divine realm of Selûne, where they eventually became aasimars.\nAccording to legend, if the Ritual of the Waxing was performed correctly at Elahzad, a holy site in the Hills of Scent in Anauroch, a portal would open that would summon Selûnarra back from the Gates of the Moon so as to combat the shades of Thultanthar. But apparently the correct time and manner of this ceremony was never discovered, since such an event never took place."
