Kataburi was a medium-sized river-port town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, Kataburi has not been labelled on any map of Malatra. While it is known to be on a river, there are several named rivers in the Kuong Kingdom, none of which are marked on a map.
A bustling port in the midâ€“14 century DR, Kataburi saw much of the silk from Banda pass through it. Its fishermen caught giant crayfish in the river and sold them to communities up and down its length.
There was also an illicit trade in abducted women, who were kidnapped from Tu Lung in cross-border raids launched from Mhou in Laothan and trafficked by caravan south as far as Kataburi. There, these women were sold in a hidden market by the waterfront and taken to serve as consorts in the households of the immoral people who bought them.
A nice temple here was dedicated to a local river spirit, who was believed to bless Kataburi with its giant crayfish. The priest of the temple was Devuri, himself a crayfish hengeyokai.
