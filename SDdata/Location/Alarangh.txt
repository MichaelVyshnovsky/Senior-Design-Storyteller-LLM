'''Alarangh''' was a bandit keep, taken by the [[Zhentarim]] in {{yearlink|1357}}.

==Location==
Alarangh was south of the [[East Way]] and just east of the [[Thunder Gap]].

==Government==
As of {{yearlink|1357}}, Alarangh was under [[Zhentarim]] control, per [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|1357}}, Fzoul Chembryl reported to [[Xarlraun]], a [[beholder]], that the bandit keeps of Alarangh and [[Tossril]] were now under Zhentarim control, and forces were dispatched from there to assist in the capture of [[Shandril Shessair]]. The force out of Alarangh was twenty men strong.

That same force was able to catch up with Shandril a few days prior to the report; though they were destroyed, they were able to determine she traveled accompanied by [[Delg Ironstar]] and [[Narm Tamaraith]], and they caused great damage to [[Thundarlun]].
