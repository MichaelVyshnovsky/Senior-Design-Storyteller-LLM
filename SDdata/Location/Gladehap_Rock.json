        "mainbody": "ladehap Rock was a small plateau found along the northern end of the Lost Lake in Gladehap, Cormyr.\nA trail of 67 stone steps lead from the Lost Lake valley to the top of the plateau about 80 ft. (24 m) into the air.\nThough worshipers of many faiths came here to honor the gods, the plateau was also used for duels and other forms of trial by combat.\nA pair of paladins of Tyr once battled here, ranging up all of the steps until one of them was finally flung to his death far below the plateau. By the 1360s DR, the bones of the slain paladin still rested within a stone catafalque where the various trails crisscrossing the valley met."
