The '''Surmarsh''' was a dreary, humid swamp located in the northern tharch of [[Surthay (tharch)|Surthay]] within the nation of [[Thay]]. It was fed by both the [[River Sur]] and the [[River Thay]] and opened up into [[Lake Mulsantir]]. It was among the favored grounds of the nobles of [[Thay]] who partook in trophy hunting.

==Description==
The Surmarsh was a foul place, with a fetid smell that drifted well beyond its borders, as far away as the city of [[Surthay]]. This stench was especially wretched during the summer and drove scores of people away from its vile waters. The Surmarsh was fever-ridden and rife with sickness, which was spread by swarms of disease-carrying insects.

The waters of the swamp were broken by occasional small hills that held small, isolated shelters.

==Inhabitants==
The Surmarsh was populated with numerous tribes of [[lizardfolk]] that occasionally raided the outlying lands. Many of these [[scalykind]] had been conscripted into the [[Thay]]an legions and considered their service to be an act of high honor.

Many horrific creatures such as [[otyugh]]s, [[roper]]s, [[slithermorph]]s and even [[black dragon]]s were known to infest the swamp.

Some escaped slaves and other Thayan criminals attempted to find refuge within the swamp and eke out some sort of lives for themselves.
