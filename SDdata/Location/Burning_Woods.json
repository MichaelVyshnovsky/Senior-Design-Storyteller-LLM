Some of these trees&mdash;known as [[ash tree]]s&mdash;seemed sentient and quite angry, known to lash out at those who came near them.\n\nBurrowing undead could occasionally be found living within the heavy ash mounds of the forest, such as [[carcass eater]]s and [[corpse vampire]]s. Bandits and other predators could be found lurking near its twisted forest paths, as they were the only truly usable roads."

In [[1479 DR]], it was being used as a temporary home by a small group of bandits made up of mortal [[humanoid]]s, [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]], and \"hunting hounds.\" These hounds were in fact humanoids that had been corrupted by the Shadowfell into having animalistic minds and deformed into running on all fours. Together they hunted the Shadowfell for mere sport.\n* [[Mount Hotenow (Shadowfell)|Mount Hotenow]], the Shadowfell's reflection of a [[Mount Hotenow|volcano of the same name]] on the Prime Material world of Toril. It was constantly spewing ash and cinder into the air. Rivers of magma flowed down from it into various parts of the Burning Woods, which had fires dancing along their banks and emitted thick gouts of smoke."
