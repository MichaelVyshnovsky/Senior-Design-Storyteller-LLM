century DR.
The Sword Coast, also nicknamed the Empty Lands, and extended inward into to the vale. 
The Sword Coast was an expansive tract of wilderness, that some saw as merely a place through which you had to travel in order to reach an actual meaningful destination. that encompassed some of the most important cities in all the Realms.
It was considered one of the rougher locales of Faerûn, both geographically and by virtue of its people.
Some say the Sword Coast took its name from the white cliffs that rose up sharply for hundreds of miles along the coastline between the River Dessarin and Baldurs Gate.
While scholars disagreed as to the exact borders of the Sword Coast, it was generally considered to have been bordered by the merchant nation of Amn in the south, though most other cartographers and writers shared the former opinion on the matter, designating the coastal lands north of Waterdeep as the separate Sword Coast North.
The landscape of the coastal lands varied from the verdant fields along much the Coast Way to the dangerous badlands found north of the Chionthar.
The River Chionthar was vital to trade all throughout the Western Heartlands, linking the great port of Baldurs Gate with other inland cities including Elturel, Iriaebor, Berdusk, and the ever-important Caravan City of the West, Scornubel.
* River Chionthar, the great river that ran across the Heartlands was vital for commerce in the region, serving as a trade route between a half dozen major cities.
* Lizard Marsh, a seemingly-endless stretch of fetid wetlands infested by lizardfolk tribes, otherwise seldom-encountered dinosaurs, and even the terrifying black dragons.
* Sea of Swords, the coastal waters of the Trackless Sea that bordered and were named after the Sword Coast.
* Winding Water, a long waterway that twisted through the stretch of Wilderness between the Troll Hills and the River Chionthar.
* Lykortha Expanse, a network of fungi-filled caves that was touched by the influence of the demon lord Zuggtmoy.
* Cloak Wood, an old and overgrown forest was home to many fearsome monsters, malevolent fey, and portals linking it to other locales across the continent.
* Trollbark Forest, the dense and overgrown forest that – as its name suggested – were infested with trolls.
* Swords Teeth, the precarious sheer cliffside that lined the coast for miles upon miles.
* Troll Hills, a collection of hills south of the similarly forest that remained an extension of shared territory of the troll tribes.
* Trollclaws, a grouping of hills that held within it many monstrous creatures including the horrific tall mouthers, along with even more trolls.
* Wild Hills, the stretch of barren land south of Daggerford.
Because much of the coastland was still relatively untamed wilderness, it was rich with game rabbits and fowl including grouse, bustards, and rock doves, could be hunted in abundance.

While there was no central government of the Sword Coast, both Daggerford and Baldurs Gate were member-states of the Lords Alliance. Each of these cities enjoyed a degree of increased security and lawfulness, benefits that accompanied membership in the coalition of the West.
An agreement known as "the Pact" offered protection for those traveling across the Coast Way, a responsibility shared among the settlements from Baldurs Gate all the way south to Amn.
Much of the lands beyond the trade roads and away from the influence of the coasts cities were considered mostly lawless. Like many similar places in the realms, bandits, monstrous creatures, and raiders were considered to be regular threats.
The spirit of the Sword Coast was one that comprised the shared traits of its people and their ancestors courage, resourcefulness, and a resolute sense of self-determination.
Venues and festivals across the Sword Coast often hosted tableaux, plays in which motionless performers reenacted historical scenes to live music backing. While they were known by several other names, they often featured provocative wardrobing for their actors.
Common among other live performances, often referred to as the "good old plays", was the character Old Duiwin, a wily peasant from the backcountry. Current jokes and political commentary were updated in these kinds of plays as the years went on.

Beyond the shared protection offered by various alliances and nations, the cities of the Sword Coast were bound together by their shared common interest in successful commerce.
Powerful financial and mercantile organizations operated throughout the Sword Coast, including the Merchants League of Baldurs Gate, the High Moon Trading Coster, the Seven Suns Trading Coster, and the Iron Throne among others. The Sword Coast Traders Bank of Daggerford allowed traveling merchants to deposit their accumulated wealth at a single location, for safe-keeping during their travels along the coast, and withdrawal the same amount at either city of Baldurs Gate or Waterdeep.
While the Lords Alliance provided some shared defense of the northern coastlands, and the Baldurian Flaming Fist protected the citys interests beyond its walls, while travelers of appropriate means were encouraged to hire personal guards or adventurers.
Tens of thousands of years before the Era of Upheaval, the Sword Coast was dominated by the ancient elven kingdom of Illefarn.
During the Age of the Proud Peoples,circa -4974 DR, the dwarven realm of Haunghdannar emerged as a power of the Sword Coast. It remained active for over 1500 years before rapidly falling into decline for reasons lost to time.
The elves of land secured a great victory against the orc hordes when they routed the armies of Gluthtor in the .

A devastating plague spread throughout the Sword Coast in the . Worship of Talona soared in the wake of the disaster.
The people of the Sword suffered years of strife during the onset of the Era of Upheaval. The First Dragonspear War broke out in the , and saw the armies of Waterdeep and Baldurs Gate fighting back against goblinoid and fiendish forces that poured out from a portal beneath Dragonspear Castle. Interestingly enough, this conflict led to a swell in the tiefling population in the region.
The Second Dragonspear War broke out a mere seven years later, following the Realms-wide catastrophe of the year-long Time of Troubles. The battles of this conflict far eclipsed the first, calling to arms a coalition of united dwarves, elves, soldiers from Daggerford, along with Waterdhavian forces, some of whom fought in the first Dragonspear conflict. the people of the Sword Coast were forced to defend themselves from the forces of the Nine Hells in battles across their homeland and even at the gates of their cities. The losses were much greater than before however many of the coasts people suffered great loss and the collective trauma took its toll on many.
While the Sword Coast enjoyed a brief reprieve for a few years, the ever-looming threat of war arose again in the . The organization known as the Iron Throne manipulated the availability and quality of iron, while simultaneously hiring bandits to ambush any caravans bearing iron or weapon shipments, in a series of events that came to be known as the Iron Crisis. These events were revealed to be a piece the political machinations of the charismatic Iron Throne leader Sarevok Anchev and were put to a stop before the years end.
Before the end of the year, war and chaos did finally erupt for the third time in less than a decade and a half. The charismatic aasimar paladin Caelar Argent raised the Shining Crusade army and marched her followers to the ruins of Dragonspear Castle, claiming she could bring back the souls of those that died in the previous wars. Innocent bystanders fled from small towns and farmlands along the crusades path of conquest and sought safety from nearby cities and fortifications. The profound migration of people created a refugee crisis in the fortified city Baldurs Gate. Caelar Argents crusade was finally put to an end at the decisive battle at Dragonspear Castle, when Caelar Argent and a group of adventurers entered into the Nine Hells themselves.
Circa the early 1470s DR, a movement to resurrect the glory of ancient Illefarn emerged among the wood elf communities along the coast. These efforts were led by Alagarthas, the son of King Melandrach of the Misty Forest.
In the , the saprophytic plague ravaged areas of the Sword Coast. Many people and animals, along with massive stores of foodstuffs were afflicted by the mysterious fungal disease. It finally ended when a group of adventurers investigated its source and destroyed its creator.
While the great many tall-tales, local rumors and gossip, hushed political murmurs, and awe-inspiring legends that permeated the Sword Coast were far too many to list, they could often be found for a few coins at the many inns and taverns across its lands.
Several guidebooks detailing the Sword Coast have been written over the years, including numerous volumes of the Travelers Guides and the infamous Volos Guidebook series.

More individualistic types on the Sword Coast, like the corsairs found contentment carving out fame and fortune, in their case at the high seas just beyond the coastlands. Alternately, the lands rangers were often among the most helpful folks of the Sword Coast, assisting travelers and settlers survive within its often-harsh landscape. Those adventurers fortunate enough to retire from the life could often be found living second lives as crafters or tradespeople.
As a result of the absence of a single, centralized government in the Sword Coast, many competing organizations such as cults, religious-militaristic orders, secret societies, and mercantile consortiums haven taken root in the coastal cities. Most notable among these were the good-intentioned spies and operatives known as the Harpers, the network of self-serving merchants and mercenaries of the Zhentarim, the expansive criminal organization of the Shadow Thieves, the altruistic and sometimes-zealous druids of the Emerald Enclave, and the most-recently founded collective of knights, paladins, and other holy crusaders united under a single banner, the Order of the Gauntlet.
By the same reasoning, the region attracted many smaller adventuring companies, mercenary outfits, and minor military outfits. While the Fist absorbed many smaller outfits during its founding and growth in power, other well-known mercenary companies continued to operate throughout the Sword Coast despite being headquartered in other lands. Notable among these were the Chill from the Lurkwood forest, the Amnish Order of the Blue Boar, and the Blacktalons of Iriaebor. Some of the more storied adventuring companies included the Order of the Burning Dawn, the Knights of the Unicorn, and the Heroes of Baldurs Gate. The firm known as Acquisitions Incorporated served as a brokerage between prospective clients and lesser adventuring groups that operated throughout the Sword Coast under a shared charter.
