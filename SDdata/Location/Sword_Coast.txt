The '''Sword Coast''', also nicknamed the '''Empty Lands''', and extended inward into to [[Sunset Vale|the vale]]. 
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Description==
The Sword Coast was an expansive tract of wilderness, that some saw as merely a place through which you ''had'' to travel in order to reach an actual meaningful destination. that encompassed some of the most important cities in all the Realms.

It was considered one of the rougher locales of [[Faerûn]], both geographically and by virtue of its people.

===Etymology===
Some say the Sword Coast took its name from the white cliffs that rose up sharply for hundreds of miles along the coastline between the [[River Dessarin]] and [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Geography==
While scholars disagreed as to the exact borders of the Sword Coast, it was generally considered to have been bordered by the merchant nation of [[Amn]] in the south, though most other cartographers and writers shared the former opinion on the matter, designating the coastal lands north of Waterdeep as the separate [[Sword Coast North]].<ref name="FRCS3e-p.78><ref name="FRCS3e-p.176>

===Geographical Features===
The landscape of the coastal lands varied from the verdant fields along much the [[Coast Way]] to the dangerous badlands found north of the [[Chionthar]].

The [[River Chionthar]] was vital to trade all throughout the Western Heartlands, linking the great port of Baldur's Gate with other inland cities including [[Elturel]], [[Iriaebor]], [[Berdusk]], and the ever-important Caravan City of the West, [[Scornubel]].<ref name="FRCS3e-p.225>

====Bodies of Water====
* [[River Chionthar]], the great river that ran across the Heartlands was vital for commerce in the region, serving as a trade route between a half dozen major cities.<ref name="FRCS3e-p.225 />
* [[Lizard Marsh]], a seemingly-endless stretch of fetid wetlands infested by [[lizardfolk]] tribes, otherwise seldom-encountered [[dinosaur]]s, and even the terrifying [[black dragon]]s.<ref name="FRCS3e-p.224>
* [[Sea of Swords]], the coastal waters of the [[Trackless Sea]] that bordered and were named after the Sword Coast.
* [[Winding Water]], a long waterway that twisted through the stretch of Wilderness between the [[Troll Hills]] and the [[River Chionthar]].<ref name="FRCS3e-p.225 /><ref name="FRCS3e-map>

====Caves & Caverns====
* [[Lykortha Expanse]], a network of fungi-filled caves that was touched by the influence of the [[demon lord]] [[Zuggtmoy]].

====Forests====
* [[Cloak Wood]], an old and overgrown forest was home to many fearsome monsters, malevolent [[fey]], and ''[[portal]]s'' linking it to other locales across the continent.
* [[Trollbark Forest]], the dense and overgrown forest that – as it's name suggested – were infested with [[troll]]s.<ref name="FRCS3e-p.225 />

====Hills & Mountains====
* [[Sword's Teeth]], the precarious sheer cliffside that lined the coast for miles upon miles.
* [[Troll Hills]], a collection of hills south of the similarly forest that remained an extension of shared territory of the troll tribes.<ref name="FRCS3e-p.225 />
* [[Trollclaws]], a grouping of hills that held within it many monstrous creatures including the horrific [[tall mouther]]s, along with even more trolls.<ref name="FRCS3e-p.225 />
* [[Wild Hills]], the stretch of barren land south of Daggerford.

===Flora & Fauna===
Because much of the coastland was still relatively untamed wilderness, it was rich with game: [[rabbit]]s and fowl including [[grouse]], [[bustard (bird)|bustards]], and [[dove|rock doves]], could be hunted in abundance.

==Government==
[[File:Lords' Alliance 5e.png|thumb|right|150px|Both [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Daggerford]] were active members of the [[Lords' Alliance]] as of the late 15{{th}} century.]]
While there was no central government of the Sword Coast, both Daggerford and Baldur's Gate were member-states of the [[Lords' Alliance]]. Each of these cities enjoyed a degree of increased security and lawfulness, benefits that accompanied membership in the coalition of the West.

===Law & Order===
An agreement known as "the Pact" offered protection for those traveling across the Coast Way, a responsibility shared among the settlements from Baldur's Gate all the way south to Amn.

Much of the lands beyond the trade roads and away from the influence of the coast's cities were considered mostly lawless. Like many similar places in the realms, [[bandit]]s, monstrous creatures, and raiders were considered to be regular threats.

==Society==
The spirit of the Sword Coast was one that comprised the shared traits of its people and their ancestors: courage, resourcefulness, and a resolute sense of self-determination.

===Culture===
Venues and festivals across the Sword Coast often hosted tableaux, plays in which motionless performers reenacted historical scenes to live music backing. While they were known by several other names, they often featured provocative wardrobing for their actors.

Common among other live performances, often referred to as the "good old plays", was the character [[Old Duiwin]], a wily peasant from the backcountry. Current jokes and political commentary were updated in these kinds of plays as the years went on.

==Trade==
[[File:Road to phandalin.webp|thumb|300px|''A cart is attacked along the coast.'']]Unfinished [[bloodstone]] gems were regularly used as currency throughout the Sword Coast, especially by mercenaries.

Beyond the shared protection offered by various alliances and nations, the cities of the Sword Coast were bound together by their shared common interest in successful commerce.

Powerful financial and mercantile organizations operated throughout the Sword Coast, including the [[Merchant's League]] of Baldur's Gate, the [[High Moon Trading Coster]], the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]], and the [[Iron Throne]] among others. The [[Sword Coast Traders' Bank]] of [[Daggerford]] allowed traveling merchants to deposit their accumulated wealth at a single location, for safe-keeping during their travels along the coast, and withdrawal the same amount at either city of Baldur's Gate or Waterdeep.

==Defenses==
While the Lords' Alliance provided some shared defense of the northern coastlands, and the Baldurian Flaming Fist protected the city's interests beyond its walls, while travelers of appropriate means were encouraged to hire personal guards or adventurers.

==History==
Tens of thousands of years before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the Sword Coast was dominated by the ancient [[elven]] kingdom of [[Illefarn]].

During the [[Age of the Proud Peoples]],''circa'' [[-4974 DR]], the [[dwarven]] realm of [[Haunghdannar]] emerged as a power of the Sword Coast. It remained active for over 1500 years before rapidly falling into decline for reasons lost to time.

The elves of land secured a great victory against the [[orc]] hordes when they routed the armies of [[Gluthtor]] in the {{YearlinkName|225}}.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|33}}

[[Delimbiyran]] the ''Kingdom of Man'' arose within the northern lands of the Sword Coast The kingdom's dissolution saw the formation of numerous lesser realms and the founding of new cities and settlements.

A devastating plague spread throughout the Sword Coast in the {{YearlinkName|1150}}. Worship of [[Talona]] soared in the wake of the disaster.

===14{{th}} Century===
The people of the Sword suffered years of strife during the onset of the [[Era of Upheaval]]. The [[First Dragonspear War]] broke out in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, and saw the armies of Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate fighting back against [[goblinoid]] and [[fiend]]ish forces that poured out from a ''[[portal]]'' beneath [[Dragonspear Castle]]. Interestingly enough, this conflict led to a swell in the [[tiefling]] population in the region.

The [[Second Dragonspear War]] broke out a mere [[1363 DR|seven years later]], following the Realms-wide catastrophe of the year-long [[Time of Troubles]]. The battles of this conflict far eclipsed the first, calling to arms a coalition of united [[dwarves]], [[elves]], soldiers from [[Daggerford]], along with Waterdhavian forces, some of whom fought in the first Dragonspear conflict. the people of the Sword Coast were forced to defend themselves from the forces of the [[Nine Hells]] in battles across their homeland and even at the gates of their cities. The losses were much greater than before however; many of the coasts' people suffered great loss and the collective trauma took its toll on many.

While the Sword Coast enjoyed a brief reprieve for a few years, the ever-looming threat of war arose again in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. The organization known as the Iron Throne manipulated the availability and quality of [[iron]], while simultaneously hiring bandits to ambush any caravans bearing iron or weapon shipments, in a series of events that came to be known as the [[Iron Crisis]]. These events were revealed to be a piece the political machinations of the charismatic Iron Throne leader [[Sarevok Anchev]] and were put to a stop before the year's end.

Before the end of the year, [[War of the Shining Crusade|war and chaos]] did finally erupt for the third time in less than a decade and a half. The charismatic [[aasimar]] [[paladin]] [[Caelar Argent]] raised the [[Shining Crusade]] army and marched her followers to the ruins of Dragonspear Castle, claiming she could bring back the souls of those that died in the previous wars. Innocent bystanders fled from small towns and farmlands along the crusade's path of conquest and sought safety from nearby cities and fortifications. The profound migration of people created a refugee crisis in the fortified city Baldur's Gate. Caelar Argent's crusade was finally put to an end at the decisive battle at Dragonspear Castle, when Caelar Argent and a group of adventurers entered into the [[Nine Hells]] themselves.

===15{{th}} Century===
''Circa'' the early 1470s DR, a movement to resurrect the glory of ancient Illefarn emerged among the [[wood elf]] communities along the coast. These efforts were led by [[Alagarthas]], the son of King [[Melandrach]] of the [[Misty Forest]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[saprophytic plague]] ravaged areas of the Sword Coast. Many people and animals, along with massive stores of foodstuffs were afflicted by the mysterious fungal disease. It finally ended when a group of adventurers investigated its source and destroyed [[Xanthoria|its creator]].

==Rumors & Legends==
While the great many tall-tales, local rumors and gossip, hushed political murmurs,{{Cite dragon/430/Eye on the Realms: The Three-headed Helm|44}} and awe-inspiring legends that permeated the Sword Coast were far too many to list, they could often be found for a few coins at the many inns and taverns across its lands.

Several guidebooks detailing the Sword Coast have been written over the years, including numerous volumes of the ''[[Traveler's Guide to the Sword Coast|Traveler's Guides]]'' and the infamous ''[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast (in-universe)|Volo's Guidebook]]'' series.

==Inhabitants==
===Individuals===
More individualistic types on the Sword Coast, like the [[Sword Coast corsair|corsairs]] found contentment carving out fame and fortune, in their case at the high seas just beyond the coastlands. Alternately, the lands' [[ranger]]s were often among the most helpful folks of the Sword Coast, assisting travelers and settlers survive within its often-harsh landscape. Those adventurers fortunate enough to retire from the life could often be found living second lives as crafters or tradespeople.

===Organizations===
As a result of the absence of a single, centralized government in the Sword Coast, many competing organizations such as cults, religious-militaristic orders, secret societies, and mercantile consortiums haven taken root in the coastal cities. Most notable among these were the good-intentioned [[Harper agent|spies and operatives]] known as the [[Harpers]], the network of self-serving merchants and mercenaries of the [[Zhentarim]], the expansive criminal organization of the [[Shadow Thieves]], the altruistic and sometimes-zealous [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Enclave]], and the most-recently founded collective of knights, [[paladin]]s, and other holy crusaders united under a single banner, the [[Order of the Gauntlet]].

By the same reasoning, the region attracted many smaller adventuring companies, mercenary outfits, and minor military outfits. While the Fist absorbed many smaller outfits during its founding and growth in power, other well-known mercenary companies continued to operate throughout the Sword Coast despite being headquartered in other lands. Notable among these were [[the Chill]] from the [[Lurkwood]] forest, the [[Amn]]ish [[Order of the Blue Boar]], and the [[Blacktalons]] of [[Iriaebor]]. Some of the more storied adventuring companies included the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]], the [[Knights of the Unicorn]], and the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|19-21}} The firm known as [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] served as a brokerage between prospective clients and lesser adventuring groups that operated throughout the Sword Coast under a shared charter.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Mintiper Moonsilver]], the famous bard and singer nicknamed the "Lonely Harpist" who traveled all along the coast singing tales of his escapades.
* [[Sylvira Savikas]], a renowned [[sage]] and one of the [[Great Reader]]s of [[Candlekeep]].
* [[Minsc]], an adventurer from [[Rashemen]] that found a new home on the Sword Coast and emerged as the Beloved Ranger of Baldur's Gate.
