The '''Temples District''' was the largest and perhaps the oldest and most important regions in the entirety of the [[Upper City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It featured some of the city's greatest buildings and landmarks that were famous across the [[Sword Coast]]. It housed the grand [[Ducal Palace]], which served as the seat of power for the ruling [[Grand Duke]]s, the vast [[Gond]]ar temple-workshop known as [[High House of Wonders]], along with the museum that proudly displayed the creations of Baldurian [[Gondsmen]], the [[Hall of Wonders]].

==Notable Locations==
;Inns and Festhalls:
* [[Three Old Kegs]]: The Kegs was such a popular establishment that many retired [[Flaming Fist]]s chose to take up permanent residence within. It was considered one of the finest inns in all of [[Faerûn]].
* [[Helm and Cloak]]: This upscale, traditional inn was located in the heart of the Upper City.

;Landmarks:
* [[High Hall]]: While the castle of Baldur's Gate was the seat of power for the [[Grand Duke]]s, it was also housed the city courts, its civic record keeping and served as a venue for professional and guild meetings alike.
* [[Six Wise Machinists]]: This notable statue was located just north of the High House of Wonders.

;Residences:
* [[Ramazith's tower]]: The tower of the 14{{th}} century [[Ramazith Flamesinger|sage]] remained standing over a century later.
* [[Vanthampur Villa]]: Wanting to get away from the gossip of the other nobles of [[Manorborn]] district, the [[Vanthampur]] estate is located here.<ref>Adam Lee, Christopher Perkins (September 17, 2019). ''Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus''. (Wizards of the Coast), p. 183. ISBN 0786966769.
* [[Portyr]] estate: Unassuming manor which is home to the family of [[Dillard Portyr]], Duke of Baldur's Gate.

;Temples:
* [[Hall of Wonders]]: "The Hall" served as both a city museum and a holy site to the Gondar faith.
* [[High House of Wonders]]: While "the House" catered to the followers of Gond, it was open night and day to everyone within Baldur's Gate.

;Roads:
* [[Belltoll Street]]
* [[Windspell Street]]
