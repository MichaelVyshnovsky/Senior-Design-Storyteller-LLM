The Temples District was the largest and perhaps the oldest and most important regions in the entirety of the Upper City of Baldurs Gate. It featured some of the citys greatest buildings and landmarks that were famous across the Sword Coast. It housed the grand Ducal Palace, which served as the seat of power for the ruling Grand Dukes, the vast Gondar temple-workshop known as High House of Wonders, along with the museum that proudly displayed the creations of Baldurian Gondsmen, the Hall of Wonders.
