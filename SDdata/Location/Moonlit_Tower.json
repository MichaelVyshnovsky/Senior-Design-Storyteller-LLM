            "Interior": "Adventurers were able to enter the tower and describe the interior. Inside, there were seven rooms and a rooftop floor. These were connected by a spiral stair of stone treads that floated without any visible means of support, and with no rail either. [[Magic]] [[spell]]s cast within the Tower had unusual effects."
        },
        "History": "There were many different tales about what was found within. At times, the Tower was either empty or inhabited by rare or bizarre monsters; for example, an [[argos]], or [[beholder]]s, [[steel shadow]]s, [[watchghost]]s, and strange, unknown creatures. Sometimes there was treasure, sometimes there was not. On occasion, explorers returned with a [[disease]], eggs that hatched into dangerous monsters, or statuettes that reverted to living monsters.",
        "Rumors": "[[Sages]] theorized that when not on the crag the Moonlit Tower traveled between several other planes or even to other worlds. When it disappeared, any explorers still inside were rarely seen again.",
