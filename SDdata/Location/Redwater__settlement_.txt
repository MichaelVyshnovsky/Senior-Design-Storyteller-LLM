Redwater was a notable settlement found in the Dragon Coast region of the Eastern Heartlands.
It was situated on the northern shore of its namesake body of water, Redwater lake.
Redwater became a destination for Helmite pilgrims following the midâ€“14 century DR, after the Guardtower of the God was sacked by followers of the Gods of Fury.
Some time later, the Helm of Helm rose from the rubble of the destroyed temple and presented itself to Rolor, who believed himself to be the new Sword of Helm.
