        "Description": "It was a small town of 700 folk mainly known for its skilled stonecutters and excellent harbor&mdash;a small bay sheltered by a high, rocky spit, with a fine beach and inlet. In [[Volo]]'s estimation, the folk were tense and suspicious, being fearful of attack or other treachery by Luskan, and the village had little of interest about it.",
        "Government": "Port Llast was ruled by a First Captain. Around [[1365 DR]], this was the retired stonemason [[Haeromos Dothwintyl]].",
        "Relationships": "The town was closely allied to [[Neverwinter]].\n\n[[Luskan]] coveted Port Llast for its excellent harbor, as the City of Sails wished a southern base for its warships.",
        "Trade": "A fishing fleet comprising twelve boats operated out of Port Llast's harbor ''circa'' 1365 DR, though two in poor condition.\n\nPort Llast's primary land-bound industry was cutting stone, with quarries situated on the coastal headlands just to the south.",
        "Defense": "Defending Port Llast against bandit raids and potential Luskan attack or annexation were a local of militia of 50 people, backed up by 50 men-at-arms from Neverwinter and 30 more from the [[Lords' Alliance]], hailing mostly from [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Elturel]]. As a result, any attack on Port Llast by Luskan risked dragging it into a war with three powerful cities.\n\n[[Catapult]]s that launched boulders were installed atop the cliffs overlooking the harbor.",
        "History": "[[File:PortMap.png|thumb|250px|''A map showing the location of Port Llast.'']]\nA [[Northlander|Northman]] raider and explorer named [[Grath Erlkar]] built Grath's Hold in the {{YearlinkName|127}}.<ref> Some time after, the town was renamed to Last Port and it bore that name until roughly the late 1000s DR during the existence of the town's last noble line, the [[Adreum]] family, after which it was called Port Llast.<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|175}}, Port Llast was assailed and sacked by the [[orc]]s of the [[Severed Hand (tribe)|Severed Hand]]. Many of its inhabitants fled south and sought refuge in [[Eigersstor]] (which was later Neverwinter).<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|806}}, Port Llast was claimed by the Witch-Queen [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral]] as the capitol of her realm of [[Stornanter]].<ref> In the {{YearlinkName|834}}, the [[kraken]] [[Slarkrethel]] attacked Port Llast; though repelled by Laeral, it absconded with Stornanter's magical throne of state, the ''[[Soaring Throne of the Witch-Queen]]''.{{Cite dragon/351/Volo's Guide: Lost Regalia of the North: The Toppled Thrones|75}} In the {{YearlinkName|841}}, the Witch-Queen left Stornanter to travel the planes. Nobles of the realm descended into infighting and Stornanter was dissolved, though Port Llast remained.<ref>\n\nSometime before the late 1000s DR, Port Llast's rulership was in the hands of the Adreum family. The last ruler of that clan was the infamous Coward Lord of Last, Lord [[Adreum VI]], who was in power during the [[Orc Wars]] of the late 1000s DR. Lord Adreum faced the grave danger of an encroaching orcish horde and ordered Last Port to be abandoned. In fear of the unbeatable horde, Lord Adreum fled with his family, leaving his captain to organize the evacuation. However, predictions of the orc horde's speed were off, and Last Port was besieged before the evacuation was completed while Lord Adreum was safely away. He returned to find the city ablaze, and many of its defenders and commoners were slaughtered, drastically reducing its population. When the battles were over, the survivors of the siege became a furious mob who blamed Lord Adreum for the deaths of their friends and families. The mob murdered the entire Adreum line. The town was renamed from Last Port to Port Llast, and the last ruling family was remembered mainly for the \"Adreum Curse\" that was said to haunt the town for centuries to come. Lord Adreum VI was buried in [[Gothaladreum]], a cemetery on the edge of the [[Neverwinter Wood]], long abandoned and ruined by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His grave stood just to the east of the cemetery's entrance, decorated with a statue of a winged [[angelic]] being. However, despite being interred, Lord Adreum VI did not find peace in death. His oath to protect Port Llast was unfulfilled, and for the centuries that followed, when the town was in danger, Adreum rose from his ancient grave.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1333}}, the Overwizard [[Glagorn]] and other wizards of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] attacked the mage [[Llomnauvel Oloadhin|Llomnauvel \"Firehands\" Oloadhin]] of Port Llast. Llomnauvel ensured his and their destruction when he worked a mighty magic that hurled down his abode and burned away the lives of all within it.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Port Llast was weakened by the [[War of Shadows]], leaving its outskirts scarred by burned buildings, empty barns, and barren fields. With Neverwinter weakened as well, Port Llast became occupied by a Luskan army. The huge [[undead]] forces, led by ancient spirits of Port Llast's founders, tried to reclaim the city. It's not known whose side won the conflict.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] and the return of parts of [[Abeir]], the transposition of [[Laerakond]] changed the tides surrounding Port Llast, filling the harbor with silt and making it effectively useless as a port. This ultimately made Neverwinter an easier harbor to reach. With the docks of Port Llast failing and trade dying off, many citizens fled the town or died at the hands of marauding bandits and [[sahuagin]] raids, leaving only a few stubborn holdouts remaining in residence.<ref>\n\nAfter decades of decline, both economically and through the loss of large portions of the city to invading [[sahuagin]], Port Llast enjoyed renewed hope as those areas of the city were retaken in the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, with help from [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and companions, as well as an influx of peoples from the northern [[Neverwinter Wood]] and the farmland surrounding [[Luskan]].<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Port Llast was occupied by [[Tidescourge Pirates]], who used it as a base of operations.\n\nSome time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] of [[1485 DR|1485]]/[[1486 DR]], [[frost giant]]s raided the town twice, killing any townsfolk who stood their ground.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, a [[drow]] raiding party including [[drider]]s assaulted the city searching for Drizzt Do'Urden.  A number of inhabitants were killed and some others were abducted for slaves, including [[Artemis Entreri]], [[Dahlia Sin'felle]], [[Ambergris (person)|Ambergris]], and [[Afafrenfere]]. Ultimately Drizzt and the reborn [[Companions of the Hall]] succeeded in rescuing the majority of the lost citizens from [[Q'Xorlarrin]].<ref>",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Cracked Anvil]]: a smithy run by [[Haljal Throndor]].\n* [[Whaelgund's Wheelrace Wagonworks]]: a wagonworks and repair shop operated by [[Whaelgund]].\n* The [[Jack and Saber]]: the most typical tavern.\n* The [[Alliance Arms]]: the only inn in the town c. 1365 DR.\n* [[Stonecutter's Solace]]: the only inn and tavern c. 1463 DR. It rested along the eastern cliff and was a favored haunt of the local townspeople. Drizzt and his companions stayed at the inn while they cleared the city of sahuagin and helped revitalize the port town.<ref>"
