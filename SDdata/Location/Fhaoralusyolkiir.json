        "Geography": "This city was nestled along and built into the subsea cliffs of [[Turmish]], between [[Alaghôn]] and the [[Aprhunn Mountain]], near the mouth of the [[Vilhon Reach]].<ref> Its city gates and grandiose guardposts, with gleaming tridents made of [[blaze coral]], were set into the edge of the underwater valley of the Vilhon Reach.",
        "Inhabitants": "By [[1371 DR]], about two hundred [[sea elves]] lived in Fhaoralusyolkiir, though most were tied to its temple.",
        "History": "Fhaoralusyolkiir was founded in the year {{YearlinkConvert|-8923|TS}}. It would continue to stand following Aryselmalyn Empire's demise not becoming entirely abandoned and left to ruin until {{YearlinkConvert|-10|TS}}. As the years passed, much of the city built into the cliffside would be buried by collapsing caverns.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|573}}, the Church of Deep Sashelas took up residence in the palace once lived in by the garrison city's commanders, turning it into a temple to their god. This state of affairs would continue well into the 14{{th}} century DR, with the city still retaining some vestiges of its grandeur."
