'''Gramble's Climb''' was a trade route through the [[West Galena Mountains]]. It was the shorter of the two routes connecting [[Vaasa]] and the [[Moonsea]], with the other going through [[Garumn's Climb]] to the west.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}

==Geography==
Gramble's Climb crossed the West Galenas just north of [[Mount Throndar]] to connect Vaasa to the port city of [[Hulburg]].

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the trail that passed through the Climb originated on the Vaasan side at the crossroads of [[Maur-Eturo]]. From there, it ran south through the [[Sunderland]] and then west through the [[Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen]] along the slopes of the West Galenas before turning south to ascend through the Climb. to Hulburg.

==History==
The Climb was passable as of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR during the reign of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in Vaasa, providing a connection between Vaasa and [[Glister]] in Thar.{{Cite polyhedron/81/The Everwinking Eye: As Cold As Bare Fingers}} Following Zhengyiâ€™s defeat in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Gramble's Climb was used by the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Hillsafar Hall]] to transport [[bloodstone]] and [[copper]] to the Moonsea.<ref group="note">While it is not stated explicitly in the text of [[The Bloodstone Lands (sourcebook)|''The Bloodstone Lands'']] that the dwarves used Gramble's Climb, given its proximity to Hillsafar Hall and the fact that it is the only route on the map that fits the discussion in the text, it is a reasonable assumption that this was intended to be the case. However, at some point during the late 14{{th}} century or early-to-mid 15{{th}} century DR, Gramble's Climb became unusable.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] sought to establish easier trade with the Moonsea by restoring Gramble's Climb and seizing control of the entire trade route through it. While this plan failed when the orcs and their allies were defeated at the [[Battle of Lendon's Dike]], the Knights still cleared the mountain pass of orcs and [[goblin]]s and their engineers completed the restoration of Gramble's Climb in the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, thus granting the isolated realm greater access to the Moonsea and the lands beyond.
