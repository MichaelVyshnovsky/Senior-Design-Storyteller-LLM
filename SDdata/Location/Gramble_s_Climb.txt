Grambles Climb was a trade route through the West Galena Mountains. It was the shorter of the two routes connecting Vaasa and the Moonsea, with the other going through Garumns Climb to the west.
Grambles Climb crossed the West Galenas just north of Mount Throndar to connect Vaasa to the port city of Hulburg.
In the late 15 century DR, the trail that passed through the Climb originated on the Vaasan side at the crossroads of Maur-Eturo. From there, it ran south through the Sunderland and then west through the Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen along the slopes of the West Galenas before turning south to ascend through the Climb. to Hulburg.
The Climb was passable as of the mid&ndash14 century DR during the reign of Zhengyi the Witch-King in Vaasa, providing a connection between Vaasa and Glister in Thar. Following Zhengyiâ€™s defeat in the , Grambles Climb was used by the dwarves of Hillsafar Hall to transport bloodstone and copper to the Moonsea.While it is not stated explicitly in the text of The Bloodstone Lands that the dwarves used Grambles Climb, given its proximity to Hillsafar Hall and the fact that it is the only route on the map that fits the discussion in the text, it is a reasonable assumption that this was intended to be the case. However, at some point during the late 14 century or early-to-mid 15 century DR, Grambles Climb became unusable.
In the late 15 century DR, the Warlock Knights of Vaasa sought to establish easier trade with the Moonsea by restoring Grambles Climb and seizing control of the entire trade route through it. While this plan failed when the orcs and their allies were defeated at the Battle of Lendons Dike, the Knights still cleared the mountain pass of orcs and goblins and their engineers completed the restoration of Grambles Climb in the spring of the , thus granting the isolated realm greater access to the Moonsea and the lands beyond.
