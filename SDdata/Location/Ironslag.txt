'''Ironslag''' was an ancient [[dungeon]] complex beneath [[Mount Hamarhaast]] in the [[Ice Spires]]. Home to a clan of [[fire giant]]s, this was the ancestral forge of Duke [[Zalto]].

==Location==
Ironslag lay beneath a mountain in the Ice Spires known to the [[dwarves]] of the [[Silver Marches]] as Mount Hamarhaast.

==Description==
Ironslag had two entrances. The main entrance was a set of [[adamantine]] doors 50 ft (15 m) tall, sealed by magic. The second entrance was guarded by an iron portcullis in a [[yak folk]] village on the mountain above. The main forge area was a large, two-level dungeon complex connected to a series of mines.

==Features==
Ironslag housed a magical adamantine forge.

==Inhabitants==
The complex was largely inhabited by fire giants, but also included a large number of [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[orc]]s along with several [[dwarf]], [[gnome]], and [[human]] slaves/prisoners. There were also a few [[hell hound]]s, [[salamander]]s, an [[iron golem]], and a [[chimera]] among the inhabitants.

==History==
[[File:Yakfolkvillage.png|thumb|275px|The [[yak folk]] village above the entrance to Ironslag.]]
Some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late fifteenth century [[DR]], the fire giant Duke Zalto led a clan of fire giants to reclaim the complex. Proceeding to capture slaves from across the Silver Marches, Zalto began sending agents to search for fragments of the [[Vonindod]] and rebuilding the ancient colossus within Ironslag.
