Burnt Ridge was an area of burnt woodland outside the city of Myth Drannor that was used by its wizards to practice hurling their spells. 
In 714 DR, it served as a last stand for the citys wizards who were overcome by the invading Army of Darkness, that would later bring about the fall of Myth Drannor.
