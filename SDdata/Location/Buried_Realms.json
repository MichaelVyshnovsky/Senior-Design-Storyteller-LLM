        "mainbody": "The '''Buried Realms''' was a domain of the [[Underdark]] lying underneath the vast desert of [[Anauroch]]. The area was called the '''Phaerlin''' ({{Pronounce|FAYR|lin|refs=}}) by the [[phaerimm]] who dwelled there, though this name was little-known on the surface.<ref><ref>",
        "Geography": "The whole of the Buried Realms was bordered by the [[Sharnwall]]. This magical artifice was created in ancient times by the [[sharn]] to imprison the phaerimm. It functioned as a barrier, confining the phaerimm to the Buried Realms. They could not travel between their realm and the rest of [[Faer√ªn]] by any skill or magic they were capable of. However, all other creatures could cross it freely.\n\nMany of the deepest catacombs of [[Oreme]], former capital of the fallen [[sarrukh]] empire of [[Isstosseffifil]], directly connected to this region. However, a barrier similar to the Sharn Wall that was constructed by the ruin's [[lich]] rulers prevented any phaerimm from entering the city.\n\nAs Anauroch was once the site of the old [[Netherese Empire]] and its successor states, many [[Netherese]] ruins could still be found in the Buried Realms. However, the threat of the phaerimm discouraged most adventurers from delving into the Buried Realms, even though they could pass the Sharnwall, so the sites and settlements in the area remained largely unknown to surface dwellers by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[-33,800]] the phaerimm inhabitants were forced to flee deeper into the Underdark as the Isstosseffifil empire attempted to drown them by rerouting the [[Narrow Sea]].<ref>\n\nOn [[Nightal 20]], the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the magical barrier was breached near the city of [[Evereska]], unleashing the phaerimm to cause chaos in the lands outside. Eventually, the return of [[Thultanthar]] and the forces combating the phaerimm kept them at bay.\n\nDuring their restoration of Netheril, the Shadovar led expeditions into the Buried Realm, annihilating the phaerimm and their holds, including the [[beholder]] city [[Ooltul]]. By [[1479 DR]], they commanded much of the Buried Realms.<ref name=\"FRCG-p221>",
        "Inhabitants": "This area was largely home to the terrible phaerimm. It was also inhabited by the [[asabi]] descendants of the Isstosseffifil empire, who were often controlled either directly or secretly by the phaerimm. Beholders and [[mind flayers]] were also enslaved by the phaerimm.<ref>"
