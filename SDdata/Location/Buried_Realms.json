        "mainbody": "he Buried Realms was a domain of the Underdark lying underneath the vast desert of Anauroch. The area was called the Phaerlin () by the phaerimm who dwelled there, though this name was little-known on the surface.\nThe whole of the Buried Realms was bordered by the Sharnwall. This magical artifice was created in ancient times by the sharn to imprison the phaerimm. It functioned as a barrier, confining the phaerimm to the Buried Realms. They could not travel between their realm and the rest of Faer√ªn by any skill or magic they were capable of. However, all other creatures could cross it freely.\nMany of the deepest catacombs of Oreme, former capital of the fallen sarrukh empire of Isstosseffifil, directly connected to this region. However, a barrier similar to the Sharn Wall that was constructed by the ruins lich rulers prevented any phaerimm from entering the city.\nAs Anauroch was once the site of the old Netherese Empire and its successor states, many Netherese ruins could still be found in the Buried Realms. However, the threat of the phaerimm discouraged most adventurers from delving into the Buried Realms, even though they could pass the Sharnwall, so the sites and settlements in the area remained largely unknown to surface dwellers by the 14 century DR.\nIn -33,800 the phaerimm inhabitants were forced to flee deeper into the Underdark as the Isstosseffifil empire attempted to drown them by rerouting the Narrow Sea.\nOn Nightal 20, the , the magical barrier was breached near the city of Evereska, unleashing the phaerimm to cause chaos in the lands outside. Eventually, the return of Thultanthar and the forces combating the phaerimm kept them at bay.\nDuring their restoration of Netheril, the Shadovar led expeditions into the Buried Realm, annihilating the phaerimm and their holds, including the beholder city Ooltul. By 1479 DR, they commanded much of the Buried Realms.\nThis area was largely home to the terrible phaerimm. It was also inhabited by the asabi descendants of the Isstosseffifil empire, who were often controlled either directly or secretly by the phaerimm. Beholders and mind flayers were also enslaved by the phaerimm."
