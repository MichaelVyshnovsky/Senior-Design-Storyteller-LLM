'''Barret's Quay''' was a small island in the eastern reaches of the [[Korinn Archipelago]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Inhabitants==
This island lacked any major port cities. Its population consisted primarily of [[human]]s, along with a few [[dwarves]]. Residents of the island were noted by outsiders for their taciturn nature.The text states that "no other races" could be found on Barret's Quay besides dwarves and humans, however, this is contradicted by one of the sample characters for ''[[Treasure Hunt]]'' being an [[elf]] from the island (p. 4).
