        "Geography": "The city was located north of [[Morovar]] and south of [[Ironspur]] along the [[Goliad River]] near the point where it met the [[Beaumaris River]]. The [[Ford of Goliad]] lay just to the west of town.",
        "History": "Goliad was the capital of Brandiar and the seat of its ruling family, [[House Brandebury]]. Its critical location at the junction of Damara's two main rivers made it highly influential.\n\nThe village was rebuilt at least twice since its founding. It was here that two major historical battles between the evil forces of [[Vaasa]] and the people of [[Damara]] took place. In the first battle, the city was flattened during [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]]'s [[Vaasan War|conquest of Damara]]\n\nBy this time, there was no heir remaining to the ducal throne, and stewardship of the town and of the Duchy of Brandiar fell to a common-born hero named [[Dormythyrr]].",

        "Inhabitants": "While about nine hundred [[Damaran]]s called Goliad home, only about 250 people resided within the town itself, with the remainder living in outlying farms. These farmers looked to the town as a safe haven in times of hardship."
