        "History": "After the sundering of [[Abeir-Toril]], the corpse of Arambar was left in the lands that eventually would become Skelkor. Slaves who fled from their dragon masters founded the town of Wandering Stones in the rocks that composed the remains of the primordial.\n\nIn the 13th century [[DR]], clans of slave [[dragonborn]] started a [[dragonborn rebellion|revolt]] that ended with their victory in the Battle of the Crippled Mountain. The rebels managed to seize a province and free themselves from the rule of the Empress Dragon. Renaming that province [[Tymanchebar]], they fought bravely against flights of dragons to maintain their freedom for two centuries.\n\nWhen the Spellplague hit Abeir, in [[1385 DR]],{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}} a portion of Tymanchebar, where [[Djerad Thymar]] was located, was separated from Skelkor and fell in the [[Faerûn]]ian land of [[Unther]]. With their capital city lost, the remaining dragonborn in Tymanchebar lost their fighting spirit and Gauwervyndhal was able to defeat them and reconquer what was left of the province.\n\nSmall quantities of [[dragonbane amber]] were uncovered after the Spellplague transported Laerakond to Toril. Dragonborn slaves across the lands were able to get enough dragonbane amber to start a rebellion during the [[Wailing Years]], killing many dragons and even destroying a few dragon empires. Among the fiercest rebellions were those of Skelkor and [[Djerad Kusold]] in [[Melabrauth]], regions where dragonbane amber was more common. Eventually, however, the reserves of dragonbane amber were depleted and dragons retaliated and destroyed the rebels.\n\nIn 1479 DR, Gauwervyndhal empowered a few of her human and dragonborn slaves and sent them as envoys to the free lands of Laerakond, in hopes to create commercial treaties with those nations. Many Abeirans suspected that those \"envoys\" were in fact spies, trying to put into motion whatever evil plot Gauwervyndhal had devised.",
