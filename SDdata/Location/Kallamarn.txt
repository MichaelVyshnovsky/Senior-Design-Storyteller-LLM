'''Kallamarn''' was a small farming [[village]] in southern [[Cormyr]] on the north bank of the [[Starwater River]] by the 1360s [[DR]].<ref name=VGC-p79><ref name=VGC-p81>

==History==
Kallamarn was named for one of its early settlers.<ref name=VGC-p79/>

==Geography==
Nearby towns included [[Hilp]] to the northwest, [[Gladehap]] to the northeast, and [[Nesmyth]] to the east.<ref name=VGC-p81/> 

The part of the Starwater where Kallamarn was situated was an area of rapids. A towpath (walkway) along the bank allowed those on land to pull barges past the rapids, or anchor them with [[rope]]s to large wooden tripods.<ref name=VGC-p79/>

==Trade==
An apple orchard was located along the river. It grew large, tart, green apples called [[Kallamarn Catsheads]], which were sold in [[Suzail]] and were used to make pies. When the orchard was abandoned, the apples were free for the taking, but every year a few unfortunate pickers lost their lives when they were grabbed by [[kelpie]]s and dragged down into the water.<ref name=VGC-p79/>

==Inhabitants==
Kallamarn was the birthplace of [[Lucas Surin]], a captain in the [[Purple Dragons]]. He was commissioned by [[Elminster]] to write an ecology [[book]] about the coastal areas of Cormyr and [[Sembia]] on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].<ref name=EECAL-pp1-2>
