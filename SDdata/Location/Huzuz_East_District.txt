The '''East District''' was a district of [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The East District was found in the [[Palace Quarter]] and made-up most of the eastern section of the city along the city walls. This district was bordered by the [[Affluent District]] in the south, the [[Court District]] in the west, and the [[Craft District]] in the north. The [[Avenue of Wealth]] rang along much of the East District's western border, while the [[Caravan Boulevard|Ghost's Route]] framed it from the north.

==Inhabitants==
A portion of Huzuz's military was quartered within the East District. Though many caravanserai could be found around all of the gates of Huzuz, the East District was one of only two districts within the city walls to house a caravanserai neighborhood.
