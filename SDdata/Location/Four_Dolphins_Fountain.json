        "mainbody": "The '''Four Dolphins Fountain''' was a beautifully crafted fountain, surrounded by a courtyard in the docks district of [[Scardale Town]] that was a noted meeting point for travelers and the townsfolk of [[Scardale]].",
        "Description": "The fountain was constructed in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]] and held a unique [[Item enchantment|magical enchantment]]. The fountain would block any [[scry]]ing or other means of eavesdropping within the surrounding courtyard. It survived the town's numerous turmoils, including the [[second inter-dale war]], the foreign occupation, and even the [[Shaking Plague]].\n\nDue to the beauty of the fountain's craftsmanship, the fountain was beloved for being a landmark of calm and tranquility amid the city's chaos and lawlessness. It was also extremely valued by criminals and other ne'er-do-wells who wanted complete and secure privacy in their discussions."
