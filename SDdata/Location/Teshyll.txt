The ancient city of Teshyll was a center for trade in the old Calim Empire. It was best known for the famous Harem Palace of Calim.
The ruins of the city were found in the Calim Desert near the Trade Way about mid-way from Calimport to Memnon in the region known as the Teshyllal Wastes.
In its day, before the First Era of Skyfire, the city of Teshyll served as a central caravan stop for traders and a massive marketplace for the farmers from around the fertile plains of the Teshyllal Fields. The city imported goods from the other territories within the genie empire and exported farm produce.
The city of Teshyll was destroyed by the armies of Memnon sometime during the Era of Skyfire. By 1370 DR, only the corners of a few building remained intact.
The architectural marvel, the Harem Palace, was Calims primary jhasinnadah , containing thousands of slaves.
