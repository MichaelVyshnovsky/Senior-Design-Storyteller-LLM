Yadd al-Djinni, or the Hand of the Djinni, were rocky jungle islands of the Djinnis Claws southwest of mainland Zakhara. 
The islands of Yadd al-Djinni were very slender and covered with dense jungle.
Civilized people stayed far away from these islands since they were inhabited by a variety of monsters and undead, including the rare su-monster.
Some speculated that the undead that could be found on this island were offshoots of the undead that inhabited the island of Kaff.
