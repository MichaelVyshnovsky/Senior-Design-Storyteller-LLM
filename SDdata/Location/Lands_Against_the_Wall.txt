The Lands Against the Wall was a group of foothills located on the southern slopes of the eastern stretch of the Spine of the World.
This region was completely free from any man-made landmarks such as roads or settlements. It was full of pine trees and a number of small lakes.
During the late 14 century DR, the orcs of Many-Arrows maintained regular patrols across the region, turning away travelers and adventurers.
Several herds of particularly large deer roamed across the regions. Orcs, hobgoblins, and Uthgardt barbarians claimed it under their respective hunting territories.
