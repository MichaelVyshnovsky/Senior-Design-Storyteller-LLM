        "mainbody": "Old Vaelen, and sometimes erroneously spelled as Vaelan  or Old Vaelan, or  was the ruined former capital of Veldorn.\nFollowing its collapse, Old Vaelen remained as a vast subterranean network beneath the grassy plains where the original city once stood.\nThe city was built within a grouping of hills\nAs of the late 15 century, the Datharathi chaka of Durpar claimed the lands over Old Vaelan as their own, a mere formality to hold some esteem in the public eye. In secret, they paid monetary tribute to Saed as the old vampire lord slowly increased his control over the region.\nThe original city of Vaelen was founded as a trade city in the . It remained in human hands for well over a millennium, but was taken over by a band of were-creatures led by a noble wererat in the . In the years that followed, the were-beasts that took haven in the city constantly assailed passing caravans, much to the ire of neighboring nations.\nFurious about their constant loss of goods, Mulhorand directed their army to level Vaelen, reducing it to mere rubble. Many of its lycanthrope inhabitants survived, finding shelter in the network of subterranean passageways built beneath the city. The vampire lord Saed arrived within the ruins of Vaelen two years later, he rapidly emerged as champion for the outcast creatures that were forced to live underground and over time arose as a leader among the chieftains of the Beastlands.\nThe domain of Vampire Lord Saed was home to its undead and lycanthrope minions.\nIt was rumored that the ruins of Old Vaelen held a great wealth of old Durpari riches.\nThe confusing nomenclature of Old Vaelen and its namesake city Vaelan was outlined and clarified by the Waterdhavian scribe Loducious the Laughing."
