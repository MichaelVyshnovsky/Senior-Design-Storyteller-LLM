        "Description": "Following its collapse, Old Vaelen remained as a vast subterranean network beneath the grassy plains where the original city once stood.",
        "Geography": "The city was built within a grouping of hills",
        "Government": "As of the late 15{{th}} century, the [[Datharathi]] [[chaka]] of [[Durpar]] claimed the lands over Old Vaelan as their own, a mere formality to hold some esteem in the public eye. In secret, they paid monetary tribute to Saed as the old vampire lord slowly increased his control over the region.",
        "History": "The original city of Vaelen was founded as a trade city in the {{YearlinkName|-1234}}. It remained in human hands for well over a millennium, but was taken over by a band of [[Lycanthrope|were-creatures]] led by a noble [[wererat]] in the {{YearlinkName|245}}. In the years that followed, the were-beasts that took haven in the city constantly assailed passing caravans, much to the ire of neighboring nations.\n\nFurious about their constant loss of goods, [[Mulhorand]] directed their army to level Vaelen, reducing it to mere rubble. Many of its lycanthrope inhabitants survived, finding shelter in the network of subterranean passageways built beneath the city. The [[vampire lord]] [[Saed]] arrived within the ruins of Vaelen [[1048 DR|two years later]], he rapidly emerged as champion for the outcast creatures that were forced to live underground and over time arose as a leader among the chieftains of the [[Beastlands]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The domain of Vampire Lord Saed was home to its [[undead]] and [[lycanthrope]] minions.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that the ruins of Old Vaelen held a great wealth of old Durpari riches.\n\nThe confusing nomenclature of Old Vaelen and its namesake city [[Vaelan]] was outlined and clarified by the [[Waterdhavian]] scribe [[Loducious|Loducious the Laughing]]."
