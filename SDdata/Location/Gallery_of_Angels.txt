The '''Gallery of Angels''' was a cavern deep within the [[Labyrinth]]. It housed eight fallen, petrified [[angel]]s.

==Description==
The ceiling of the cavern was some {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} high; the floor was uneven and broken. A living cave, it had abundant stalactites and stalagmites dripping water. The statues were in various poses of fear, suffering, or longing: some covered their faces, some clawed at them, some gazed at the ceiling longingly. All were dotted with lichen and mineral deposits.

==Geography==
The cave was located approximately {{SI|48|mi|k}} away from the cavern that housed the [[Maze Engine]].

==Inhabitants==
The angels were [[Anaya]], [[Baatral]], [[Harajin]], [[Lorabelios]], [[Nemevon]], [[Silnia]], [[Tamiel]], and [[Zarod]].
