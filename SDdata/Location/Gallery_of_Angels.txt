The Gallery of Angels was a cavern deep within the Labyrinth. It housed eight fallen, petrified angels.
The ceiling of the cavern was some  high the floor was uneven and broken. A living cave, it had abundant stalactites and stalagmites dripping water. The statues were in various poses of fear, suffering, or longing some covered their faces, some clawed at them, some gazed at the ceiling longingly. All were dotted with lichen and mineral deposits.
The cave was located approximately  away from the cavern that housed the Maze Engine.
The angels were Anaya, Baatral, Harajin, Lorabelios, Nemevon, Silnia, Tamiel, and Zarod.
