        "mainbody": "'''Skull Pool''' was an estuary located in [[Skullport]].",
        "Description": "Skull Pool was an estuarine basin that received a mixture of relatively fresh water from the [[River Sargauth]] and saltwater from the [[South Seacaves]], creating a dynamic aquatic environment. Despite its modest surface area, the pool was notably deep and contained subterranean connections to the [[Underdark]]. Beings such as [[aboleth]]s and [[kuo-toa]] occasionally emerged from its turbid depths to engage in trade at the [[Port of Shadow]] before retreating to their subterranean aquatic tunnels.\n\nThe pool's waters were in constant motion due to tidal influences, the inflow from the Sargauth, and runoff from a nearby waterfall that connected to the magical locks and the South Seacaves. This motion intensified when a vessel arrived from the South Seacaves, as it brought with it thousands of gallons of water into the pool.\n\nThe basin floor comprised cracked stone, sand, and muddy silt deposited from the northern [[Underhalls]]. Scattered throughout the pool were the remnants of vessels, either washed in from the Sea Caves or carried downriver by the Sargauth. Predatory species, including [[shark]]s, occasionally inhabited the area, alongside [[merrow]], [[scrag]]s, and other dangerous creatures from the Underdark seas. \n\nThe waters themselves were highly polluted, contaminated by salt and sewage discharged from the northern Port ward, rendering them unsuitable for drinking. Wounds exposed to the water were at risk of infection, leading to illness that resembled the effects of a ''[[cause disease]]'' spell.\n\nThe [[Murkspan Bridge]] crossed Skull Pool. It connected [[Skull Island]] with the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]].",
        "Geography": "The water levels of Skull Pool fluctuated in response to tidal patterns, with low tide occurring between midnight and dawn and high tide between noon and dusk. Seasonal changes also influenced the tides, with late winter and early spring bringing violent surges of seawater and ice through the South Seacaves. These obstacles were removed by the Keepers, primarily using merrow labor and fire magic. A network of caves were found beneath the water's surface at the base of the island, providing lairs for marine creatures, including a small tribe of scrags that were controlled by the [[Iron Ring]] through force and magical influence. These scrags patrolled the shallow waters, targeting both escaped slaves from Skull Island and the unwary.\n\nEvery day, between midnight and daybreak, the waters of  Skull Pool receded, exposing a muddy strip of silt and rock along the southern edge of the Lower Port ward. This brief period of low tide provided an opportunity for scavengers to search the shallow waters and sludge for [[clam]]s and [[ghost shrimp]], both of which could grow to impressive sizes. However, the area was not without danger, as predators from the Underdark occasionally hid beneath the thick sludge. [[Giant crayfish]], [[crab]]s, and even immature [[mottled worm]]s have been known to prey on unsuspecting scavengers.\n\nDuring low tide, two hidden entrances to the [[Skullport/Sewers|sewers]] were revealed along this exposed strip. Each entrance was large enough to accommodate a [[halfling]] or a stooping [[dwarf]]. These openings allowed water from the River Sargauth to flow into the sewers during high tide, aiding in the process of flushing sewage out of the city. The presence of these entrances, while known to some, remained a secret to most residents of Skullport.",
        "Inhabitants": "* The [[black dragon]] [[Vulharindauloth]] lived in the caverns below Skull Pool.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The lairs of the scrags who lived within Skull Pool were rumored to contain valuable treasure salvaged from shipwrecks, alongside the bones of their unfortunate victims."
