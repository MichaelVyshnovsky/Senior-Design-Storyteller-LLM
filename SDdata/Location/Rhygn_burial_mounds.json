        "mainbody": "The Rhygn burial mounds were a pair of artificial hills in the Kingdom of Mertwig that acted as the resting place of the conquered Rhygn civilization.\nThe two burials were known individually as Acme and Heaptop. The area around them emanated a palpable aura of pain and suffering. They were encircled by a large ring of standing stones, referred to collectively as the \"Monolith\". These stones were somewhat magical in nature, as sometimes interacting with them could cause a spellcaster to gain knowledge of new spells.\nFollowing the bloody war between the Rhygn and the father of the future king Mertwig, these mounds were constructed to house the bodies of the Rhygns warriors and their king. Decades later, the mounds were considered a holy site. Some would make offerings of gold pieces or weapons in hopes of receiving a blessing from the spirits of the Rhygn. However, these offerings sometimes angered the spirits and they would strike back at the offer-giver with a deadly curse.\nWhen King Mertwig was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth, searching even the burial mounds."
