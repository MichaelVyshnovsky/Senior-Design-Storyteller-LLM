        "Description": "The Uplands contained a few large towns and small cities but was most noted for its numerous farming communities known as \"thaedars\". These collectives saw a number of small farms banding together for mutual protection, easier transportation of goods and a greater shared labor force during the harvest months. Among the most successful and well-known of these groups included the [[Red Ram]], [[Silver Plough]] and [[Three Horns]] thaedars.\n\nThe miners and other laborers of the Uplands led hard lives that often led to heavy drinking rowdy behavior. While this behavior was seldom tolerated, these hard-working folk earned the nation significant wealth, and were a granted a fair amount of leeway by otherwise austere [[Royal Constabulary (Impiltur)|Impilturan constabulary]].",
        "History": "Before the [[Great Glacier]] receded from [[Northeast Faerûn|northeastern Faerûn]] the Uplands were dominated by the great [[hobgoblin]] realm of [[Haekrukkha]].",

            "Settlements": "*[[Laviguer]]: This rough-and-tumble mining town often competed with the nearby settlement of [[Vordric Dun]].\n*[[New Sarshel]]: While it fell within the borders of the Easting Coast, this great city was considered the \"capital\" of the Uplands.\n*[[Outentown]]: Located where the [[Prince's Road]] met the [[Herald's Road]], this small city was centered among the farms of the Uplands.\n*[[Songhal]]: A place of learning nestled in sprawling frontier farmlands, this town housed perhaps the [[House of Many Tomes|largest temple]] of [[Oghma]] in all of [[Faerûn]].\n*[[Vordric Dun]]: Another of the great mining hubs of the Earthfasts, this wild town was well-patrolled by the [[Warswords]] of Impiltur."
