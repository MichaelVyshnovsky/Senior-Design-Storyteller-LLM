        "mainbody": "The Protectors Enclave was one of the districts of Neverwinter, named after Dagult Neverember, the Lord Protector of the city.\nMost of the original buildings of this district were left unscathed after the destruction of the city. As such, the Protectors Enclave was the only part of Neverwinter that looked like it did in its old days.\nThe citys market, where all commerce in Neverwinter took place, was located in the Protectors Enclave. Merchants from Waterdeep and other cities of the Sword Coast had to pay high taxes to sell their wares here.\nBesides Lord Neverember and his underlings, the Protectors Enclave was inhabited by survivors of the cataclysm as well as immigrants who took up residence in the city after its recovery.\nThe Protectors Enclave was originally known as the Merchant Quarter of Neverwinter.Based on the locations of certain buildings in the game. This district in turn was part of other two different districts the City Core and the Peninsula District. Both were heavily damaged during the war against Luskan. The damaged parts were rebuilt as a different district.\nWhen the Spellplague of 1385 DR struck Neverwinter, the lands surrounding the Moonstone Mask became an earthmote.\nWhen Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the southwestern part of the city was left mostly untouched by the pyroclastic flow. It thus also became the primary target for Lord Neverember when he began his efforts to rebuild Neverwinter. He later fused the City Core, the Peninsula District and the Merchant Quarter into only one area. Soon after, survivors of the cataclysm, as well as new immigrants began to quickly repopulate the district.\nAs the seat of power of Neverember, the district was soon renamed the \"Protectors Enclave\" by the people.\n* Lord Dagult Neverember\n* Major Soman Galt\n* General Sabine\n* Liset Cheldar\nBusinesses & Mercantile\n* Grand Emporium, the business that provided wild beasts for sale and mercenaries for hire.\n* Manycoins Bank\n* Sages Shop, an out-of-the-way specialty shop that catered to those interested in the arcane arts.\n* Seven Suns Coster Market, a grand marketplace run by the famous Seven Suns company.\n* Shaundakul Stables, the shop of Brendon Canter, that specialized in all sorts of steeds, from horses to exotic beasts.\n* Tarmalune Trade House, the establishment run by a consortium from the Abeiran city of Tarmalune.\nInns, Festhalls, & Taverns\n* Moonstone Mask, the famous festhall built upon a earthmote that rose over the city.\nLandmarks\n* Alteration Tower, the mages tower of Lady Jyllian\n* Castle Never\n* Tower of Solace, a partially destroyed tower that served as an illegal hospital for the citys plaguetouched.\n* The Wall\nTemples\n* Hall of Justice\n* House of Knowledge\nRoads\n Coriol Street • Dagger Way • Deekin Street • Fiddlers Path • Protectors Road • Tymor Street"
