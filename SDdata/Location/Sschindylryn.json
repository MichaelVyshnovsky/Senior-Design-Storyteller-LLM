        "mainbody": "'''Sschindylryn''' was a [[drow]] city in the [[Middledark]] of the [[Deep Wastes]] in the [[Underdark]].{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Campaigns|10}} It was a strong trading power in the [[Underdark]] but a minor military one, at best.",
        "Location": "The city was situated miles below the kingdom of [[Cormyr]], beneath the [[King's Forest]], though maps placed it beneath the [[Eastern Plains]].<ref>While generally stated to be below King's Forest, the map in ''Underdark'' places Sschindylryn on the other side of Cormyr. This is assumed to be in error.\n\nIt stood on the shore of the underground [[Lake Thalmiir]],''Volo's Guide to Cormyr'' page 126 places an unnamed drow settlement near Daerbraun, but ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' 3{{rd}} edition page 213 places Sschindylryn on the shore of Thalmiir. It is assumed here that Daerbraun is misidentified or treated as part of Thalmiir.",
        "History": "The city was once very war-like, using their ''[[portal]]s'' to raid other Underdark settlements and cities. At some point in its history, Sschindylryn lost a war against [[Menzoberranzan]]. The defeat caused an almost complete demilitarization of the city. What followed was a time of rebuilding the city as a mercantile power. Toward that end, the city's spellcasters specialized in magic of divination and such that allowed easier travel.\n\nSome time in the late 1350s [[DR]], scouts from Sschindylryn discovered a very old ''[[gate]]'' on an island in the eastern [[Darklake]] of [[Gracklstugh]]. Dubbed [[Sschindylryn's Gate]], it led to a different [[plane]] entirely. Sschindylrynyr mercenaries were hired to guard the ''gate'', but rival cities fought over it. Finally, mercenaries hired by Menzoberranzan forced the Sschindylrynyr through the ''gate''. However, the ''gate'' was damaged, and none of the occupying Menzoberranzanyr knew how to operate it or to where it led.<ref><ref group=\"note\">This may be the same conflict as the war with Menzoberranzan mentioned earlier.",
        "Society": "Sschindylryn enjoyed, for a [[Lolth]]-dominated city, rare political and social stability that resulted from the ruling priestesses' inability to follow Lolth's philosophy of strife. It also had economic stability and power that the male-dominated merchant class built through surprisingly peaceful means.\n\nHowever, Lolth was a goddess who enforced and enjoyed internal strife. Prior to the [[Silence of Lolth]], the ruling priestesses started to fear that their city's stability would cost them Lolth's favor. Their solution was to start plotting and killing each other. The priestesses' inability to get their houses involved as well led to them murdering each other more less personally, thus preventing casualties from spilling outside of the priesthood. Due to the priesthood's near-self-destruction, the male merchants, mages, and soldiers moved into positions of power and leadership of the city, while the priestesses ruled in name only. After losing their effective power over the city, some priestesses converted to [[Kiaransalee]] and dead priestesses rose again as [[revenant]]s to get vengeance on other priestesses, which escalated their conflict further. The ruling males did not love Kiaransalee's clergy but their efforts against them were lackluster.",
        "Inhabitants": "Around [[1136 DR]], Sschindylryn was infiltrated by the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]]. They took over a minor noble house and installed a fosterage.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}} The leader of this fosterage in [[1372 DR]] was Patron Father [[Ilphtrin Imphraezl]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}}",
        "Description": "Sschindylryn was constructed atop older [[kuo-toa]]n ruins lying above the water of the lake. The later drow city maintained a piscine style to its architecture.\n\nSschindylryn was contained in a pyramid-shaped cavern having three sides each around {{SI|2|miles|k|long=yes}} long with the tip two miles high. At the outer edges of the cavern, great trenches or moats had been dug around the city.\n\nAt the city's center was a giant ziggurat. Many of the buildings were constructed from stone and brick (unusual for a drow city) and were fairly close together as they rested on the stepped tiers."
