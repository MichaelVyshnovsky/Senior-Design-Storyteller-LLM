        "mainbody": "Sschindylryn was a drow city in the Middledark of the Deep Wastes in the Underdark. It was a strong trading power in the Underdark but a minor military one, at best.\nThe city was situated miles below the kingdom of Cormyr, beneath the Kings Forest, though maps placed it beneath the Eastern Plains.While generally stated to be below Kings Forest, the map in Underdark places Sschindylryn on the other side of Cormyr. This is assumed to be in error.\nIt stood on the shore of the underground Lake Thalmiir,Volos Guide to Cormyr page 126 places an unnamed drow settlement near Daerbraun, but Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3 edition page 213 places Sschindylryn on the shore of Thalmiir. It is assumed here that Daerbraun is misidentified or treated as part of Thalmiir.\nThe city was once very war-like, using their portals to raid other Underdark settlements and cities. At some point in its history, Sschindylryn lost a war against Menzoberranzan. The defeat caused an almost complete demilitarization of the city. What followed was a time of rebuilding the city as a mercantile power. Toward that end, the citys spellcasters specialized in magic of divination and such that allowed easier travel.\nSome time in the late 1350s DR, scouts from Sschindylryn discovered a very old gate on an island in the eastern Darklake of Gracklstugh. Dubbed Sschindylryns Gate, it led to a different plane entirely. Sschindylrynyr mercenaries were hired to guard the gate, but rival cities fought over it. Finally, mercenaries hired by Menzoberranzan forced the Sschindylrynyr through the gate. However, the gate was damaged, and none of the occupying Menzoberranzanyr knew how to operate it or to where it led.This may be the same conflict as the war with Menzoberranzan mentioned earlier.\nSschindylryn enjoyed, for a Lolth-dominated city, rare political and social stability that resulted from the ruling priestesses inability to follow Lolths philosophy of strife. It also had economic stability and power that the male-dominated merchant class built through surprisingly peaceful means.\nHowever, Lolth was a goddess who enforced and enjoyed internal strife. Prior to the Silence of Lolth, the ruling priestesses started to fear that their citys stability would cost them Lolths favor. Their solution was to start plotting and killing each other. The priestesses inability to get their houses involved as well led to them murdering each other more less personally, thus preventing casualties from spilling outside of the priesthood. Due to the priesthoods near-self-destruction, the male merchants, mages, and soldiers moved into positions of power and leadership of the city, while the priestesses ruled in name only. After losing their effective power over the city, some priestesses converted to Kiaransalee and dead priestesses rose again as revenants to get vengeance on other priestesses, which escalated their conflict further. The ruling males did not love Kiaransalees clergy but their efforts against them were lackluster.\nAround 1136 DR, Sschindylryn was infiltrated by the Jaezred Chaulssin. They took over a minor noble house and installed a fosterage. The leader of this fosterage in 1372 DR was Patron Father Ilphtrin Imphraezl.\nSschindylryn was constructed atop older kuo-toan ruins lying above the water of the lake. The later drow city maintained a piscine style to its architecture.\nSschindylryn was contained in a pyramid-shaped cavern having three sides each around  long with the tip two miles high. At the outer edges of the cavern, great trenches or moats had been dug around the city.\nAt the citys center was a giant ziggurat. Many of the buildings were constructed from stone and brick (unusual for a drow city) and were fairly close together as they rested on the stepped tiers."
