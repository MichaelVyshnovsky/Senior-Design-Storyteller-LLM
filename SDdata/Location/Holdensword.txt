'''Holdensword''' was a hamlet in [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|24}}{{Cite polyhedron/104/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Country Treasures|8}}

==Geography==
Fairly isolated, Holdensword was located on the southeastern edge of Turmish, between [[Gildenglade]] and [[Jathrin's Jump]].

==History==
The hamlet sprung up around the namesake stronghold known as '''The Hold of the Sword'''. This was the base of a mercenary company, [[The Riders of the Sword]], who were active in the earliest days of [[human]] settlement on the northern shore of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

By [[1370 DR]], however, the Riders were long gone and the place was but a humble farming community.

==Description==
The people here were cattle ranchers who kept their herds in the rolling uplands to the east and the south. They were known to be a stern and hardworking folk.

==Notable Locations==
The old stronghold stood on a spur of rock in the southeast of the hamlet. Built of stone with massive walls and well fortified, it was a castle said to be as big and as imposing as anything found in [[Thay]] or [[Chessenta]]. Within the outcrop beneath it was a web of tunnels used for granaries and burial catacombs, and in former times as a long defensive gauntlet for defenders to retreat through.

Somewhere within either the castle or the tunnels were a series of secret rooms that were the quarters and workplace of the [[wizard]] [[Olonther]], a high-ranking member of The Riders of the Sword. He built dozens of [[battle horror]]s to defend the castle.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was thought possible that some of Olonther's battle horrors remained hidden within the castle or the tunnels, waiting to be reactivated. Furthermore, it was speculated that Olonther's [[spellbook]]s, [[magic item]]s, and treasure might be with them too, and even the old mage himself in some state.
