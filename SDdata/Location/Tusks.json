        "mainbody": "The Tusks was the duo of islets that separated the Firedrake Bay and the Race in the Trackless Sea, off the coast of Tethyr.\nThe two islands that collectively were called the Tusks were Iyritrastrul – the southern islet, and Borammur – the northern one. The so-called Gullet separated the two islands – perilous straight full of obtruding sea rocks. Bring one of the most dangerous areas of the Sword Coast, and it was rarely navigated through unless the ship was guided by a knowledgeable masterful helmsman.\nThe Tusks were located to the south of the Dragons Neck Peninsula and west of the Firedrake Bay, between the Starspire and Tethyr Peninsulas.\nThe islands main population were wild sheep that survived some ancient shipwrecks along the Gullet. However, there were rumors of a number of various shapeshifters inhabiting the Tusks.\nThe isle of Iyritrastrul had abundant shadowtops, duskwoods, and blueleaf trees.\nThe isle of Borammur once produced copper and held a small village that supported the mines. The entire settlement and the mines were overrun by mysterious \"dark things of the depths\" that slaughtered all the islands inhabitants. This took place many years before the late 14 century DR.\nVarious parties attempted to resettle Borammur and claim its rich copper deposits twice. But both lead to slaughter."
