        "mainbody": "Konang Pen was a city in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur. It stood west of the Tumen River and east of the Naktong Moors.\nThe people of Konang Pen dug peat from the perilous Naktong Moors.\nIn 1357 DR, a great fire struck Konang Pen, razing large parts of the city. Desperate to rebuild important structures such a defences, housing, and storage facilities, the city authorities pressed even travellers passing into the reconstruction effort."
