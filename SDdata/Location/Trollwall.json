        "mainbody": "he Trollwall was a defensive barrier that encircled nearly the entirety of the city of Waterdeep.\nThe Trollwall fully surrounded Waterdeeps eastern perimeter, from its southern tip at Deepwater Harbor to the northern end of the City of the Dead, The Trollwall then continued around Waterdeeps northern perimeter, beginning at the point in which the Cliffwatchs height was negligible enough for attackers to scale it, and formed the southern boundary of the Field Ward before doubling back south to surrounded the western seacoast.\nIn the Present Age, the Trollwall was made of stone and measured  tall. The thickness of the barrier varied from  in places, but was most commonly  thick. The wall had crenellations on both of its sides.\nThroughout its length the Trollwall was studded with watch towers. These were known as Trollwall Towers or torchtowers, with those bearing names being considered \"major towers\".\nIt was pierced by four major gates, one for each cardinal direction - the North Gate, River Gate, South Gate, and West Gate.\nRunning through the interior of the Trollwall was a tunnel and small rooms.\nEvery torchtower featured a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, some garderobes, and three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby. Each major torchtower had six small holding cells in total, which could hold up to ten people and which were used in times of trouble.\n* East Torch Tower\n* Endcliff Tower\n* Farwatch Tower\n* Guard Tower (City of the Dead)\n* Harborwatch Tower\n* North Tower\n* Seaeyes Tower\n* Seawatch Tower\n* The Upper Towers\n* Watchway Tower\nCommitting an act of arson or vandalism against any part of the Trollwall was a serious offense. Those who did so would suffer a fine of over 2000 gold pieces, plus the cost of repairs.\nThe Trollwall began life as a wooden palisade, that fortified the northern end of Nimoars Hold, the precursor to what would become Waterdeep. The original purpose for its construction was to protect the Hold from the regular assaults it faced from trolls to the north, though it would not receive the name \"Trollwall\" until much later. In 882 DR, the walls were expanded around the Hold and its perimeter. By 940 DR, the palisade measured over  in length.\nBetween 940 and 952 DR, it alongside Cliffwatch proved invaluable in defending the hold during the Second Trollwar. Because of the role it played in the Trollwars, the wall would later gain its name.\nIn 974 DR, the wooden palisade was torn down. The Trollwall was rebuilt out of stone and further expanded, coming to connect the wall around Halasters Hold.\nIn 1007 DR, the Trollwall expanded to absorb the ruins of Halasters Hold, making its perimeter run along the lines of what would one day become the northern borders of the Dock and Southern Wards. And in 1010 DR, the wall saw further expansion as Nimoars Hold finally took on the mantle of Waterdeep.\nIn 1035 DR, under the rulership of Ahghairon and the Lords of Waterdeep, the Trollwall saw further expansion in order to accommodate Waterdeeps growing population. The walls perimeter would move to occupy what would later be the site of River Street and Waterdeep Way. Further expansion to accommodate the citys growing population occurred in 1064 DR, with Waterdeep surpassing 50,000 citizens, making the Trollwall occupy what would one day be the site of Coffinmarch and Selduth Street. Around this time, a low adjoining wall was built to surround the citys eastern cemetery.\nIn 1101 DR, the Trollwall saw further expansion to accommodate more settlers, making its perimeter approximately occupy what would later be the site of Andamaars Street and Traders Way. Further growth in both population and trade would force the walls to move further northward in 1255 DR, approximately occupying what would later be the site of Julthoon Street and Sulmor Street.\nAll of the Trollwalls torchtowers were manned by members of the City Watch. And each of the Trollwalls gates had a detachment of twelve guards defending them."
