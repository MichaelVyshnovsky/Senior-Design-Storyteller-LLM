        "mainbody": "The '''Trollwall''' was a defensive barrier that encircled nearly the entirety of the city of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Location": "The Trollwall fully surrounded Waterdeep's eastern perimeter, from its southern tip at [[Deepwater Harbor]] to the northern end of the [[City of the Dead]], The Trollwall then continued around Waterdeep's northern perimeter, beginning at the point in which the Cliffwatch's height was negligible enough for attackers to scale it, and formed the southern boundary of the [[Waterdeep/Field Ward|Field Ward]]<ref><ref> before doubling back south to surrounded the western seacoast.",
        "Structure": {
            "Interior": "Running through the interior of the Trollwall was a tunnel and small rooms.\n\nEvery torchtower featured a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, some garderobes, and three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby. Each major torchtower had six small holding cells in total, which could hold up to ten people and which were used in times of trouble.",
            "Major Torchtowers": "* [[East Torch Tower]]\n* [[Endcliff Tower]]\n* [[Farwatch Tower]]\n* [[Guard Tower (City of the Dead)]]\n* [[Harborwatch Tower]]\n* [[North Tower]]\n* [[Seaeyes Tower]]\n* [[Seawatch Tower]]\n* The [[Upper Towers]]\n* [[Watchway Tower]]"
        },
        "Law & Order": "Committing an act of arson or vandalism against any part of the Trollwall was a serious offense. Those who did so would suffer a fine of over 2000 [[gold piece]]s, plus the cost of repairs.",
        "History": "The Trollwall began life as a wooden palisade,{{Cite adventurers league/Hero of the Troll Wars|4-5}} that fortified the northern end of [[Nimoar's Hold]], the precursor to what would become Waterdeep. The original purpose for its construction was to protect the Hold from the regular assaults it faced from [[troll]]s to the north, though it would not receive the name \"Trollwall\" until much later. In [[882 DR]], the walls were expanded around the Hold and its perimeter. By [[940 DR]], the palisade measured over {{SI|800|ft|long=yes}} in length.\n\nBetween 940 and [[952 DR]], it alongside Cliffwatch proved invaluable in defending the hold during the [[Second Trollwar]]. Because of the role it played in the [[Trollwars]], the wall would later gain its name.\n\nIn [[974 DR]], the wooden palisade was torn down. The Trollwall was rebuilt out of stone and further expanded, coming to connect the wall around [[Halaster's Hold]].\n\nIn [[1007 DR]], the Trollwall expanded to absorb the ruins of Halaster's Hold, making its perimeter run along the lines of what would one day become the northern borders of the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock]] and Southern Wards. And in [[1010 DR]], the wall saw further expansion as Nimoar's Hold finally took on the mantle of Waterdeep.\n\nIn [[1035 DR]], under the rulership of [[Ahghairon]] and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], the Trollwall saw further expansion in order to accommodate Waterdeep's growing population. The wall's perimeter would move to occupy what would later be the site of [[River Street]] and [[Waterdeep Way]]. Further expansion to accommodate the city's growing population occurred in [[1064 DR]], with Waterdeep surpassing 50,000 citizens, making the Trollwall occupy what would one day be the site of [[Coffinmarch]] and [[Selduth Street]]. Around this time, a low adjoining wall was built to surround the city's eastern cemetery.\n\nIn [[1101 DR]], the Trollwall saw further expansion to accommodate more settlers, making its perimeter approximately occupy what would later be the site of [[Andamaar's Street]] and [[Trader's Way]]. Further growth in both population and trade would force the walls to move further northward in [[1255 DR]], approximately occupying what would later be the site of [[Julthoon Street]] and [[Sulmor Street]].",
        "Inhabitants": "All of the Trollwall's torchtowers were manned by members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]. And each of the Trollwall's gates had a detachment of twelve guards defending them."
