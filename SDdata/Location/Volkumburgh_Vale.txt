'''Volkumburgh Vale''' was a valley nestled in the foothills of the [[Thunder Peaks]], south of [[Thunder Gap]].

==Geography==
Volkumburgh was a rugged, snowy valley. Where winters came early and were liable to have blizzards or ice storms. In the southern half of the valley,<ref group="note" name="north">Page 2 of ''Vale of the Dragon Oracle'' text states that the eponymous valley is to the north-northwest of the village and that the Temple of the Dragon Oracle is located there. But in the ''Shattered Statue'', it was stated that the temple is south of the village. stood [[Mount Drakkor Rouge]], a semi-extinct and partially flooded volcano.<ref group="note" name="mount">Since it is stated that the Temple of the Dragon Oracle is in the Vale of the Dragon Oracle, it is assumed that the mountain it's built into is also part of the Vale.

==Notable Locations==
* [[College of Rune Magics]], a school dedicated to the study and practice of [[rune magic]]. It was situated south of the valley on a wide natural ledge opposite the other college.
* [[College of Shaping Magics]], a school dedicated to the study and practice of a form of [[arcane magic]] it referred to as '''shaping magics'''. It was situated south of the valley on a wide natural ledge opposite the other college.
* [[Chantry of St. Sammaster]] and [[Temple of the Dragon Oracle]], two [[Cult of the Dragon]] bases that stood opposite of each other within the Vale of the Dragon Oracle.
* [[Volkumburgh]], a small rustic village of miners and [[sheep]] farmers nestled within the valley.

==History==
In [[999 DR]],

Around the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], members of the Cult of the Dragon came to the Thunder Peaks area. Some time between the {{YearlinkName|1151}} and the {{YearlinkName|1174}}, an evil force overran the temple and forced the cultists to abandon it.

In the mid-12{{th}} century [[DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}} King [[Proster Obarskyr]] ordered the College of Shaping Magics to construct a new breed of [[stone golem]]s, designed to help expedite his building projects.

Later that same year Volkumburgh Vale was sacked in a rampage by [[Awtawmatawn|that same golem]], leading to the destruction of both of the valley's magic colleges entrusting one of its hands with Lord Volkumburgh and hiding its head within a volcanic vent inside the abandoned Temple of the Dragon Oracle.

Lord Volkumburgh's manor would go on to be rebuilt as the [[Crimson Wyrm]], while the rest of its remains were used to construct the small village of Volkumburgh.

In 1358 DR,{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} the magic-user [[Amelior Amanitas]] set up a [[Amelior's workshop|workshop]] in the village in the form of a huge tower, as well as some fragments of it, which he managed to merge back together into an arm through use of [[potion]]s.
