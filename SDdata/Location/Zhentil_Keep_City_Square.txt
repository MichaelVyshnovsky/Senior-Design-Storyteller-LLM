The '''City Square''', which was also called '''the Gathering''', was a paved plaza located in [[Zhentil Keep]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The City Square was located in south Zhentil Keep in the central section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] on [[Zhent Avenue]]. 

==Description==
Six stone benches lined the perimeter of the square facing a statue of an unknown bureaucrat in the square's center. Stocks and pillories were also found here to be used to punish criminals. A pair of enchanted lanterns kept the City Square illuminated at all times. Their enchantment allowed them to burn for a full month before their flask of oil needed to be changed. Since the square was usually quite crowded, opportunistic [[bard]]s performed here hoping to catch the attention of an innkeep or tavern owner.

==Activities==
As its name implied, the Gathering was a favorite spot for citizens of Zhentil Keep to lounge. Clever produce vendors sold rotten wares which citizens could use to pummel criminals locked in the stocks. Clergy of [[Loviatar]] performed public floggings here as well.

==Inhabitants==
An old man named [[Sanamun]] played competitive [[Chess (game)|chess]] here for 1 [[gp]] per game.
