        "mainbody": "'''Sixstar''' was one of the more luxurious neighborhoods found within the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The quiet and peaceful locale was full of three-and-four-story longhouses that had housed several generations of the [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|city's nobility]]. There were few businesses within Sixstar and anyone that drew weapons too loud within its streets were quickly intercepted by the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] and their war dogs they kenneled at the [[Redspires House]].\n\nThis neighborhood of the [[Uptown District]] garnered its name from the six-way intersection of [[Broken Bit Lane]], [[Fire Lane]] and [[MacIntyre Path]], a bit west of [[Lake Christina]].",
