Atars Looking Glass was a sweltering and uniquely hazardous stretch of desert in Anauroch.
The region was  composed of what appeared to be a flat "sea" of small, multi-color polished stones that absorbed more heat from the sun than any other surface in the desert. It was so intensely hot that even camels had great difficulty traversing its surface without harming the pads of their feet. Any creature that collapsed upon Atars Looking Glass would literally be roasted atop the pebbled desert floor.
Atars Looking Glass was located east of the Scimitar Spires mountain range, in the northeastern area of the Sword. It was roughly ovular in shape, stretching  across from east to west, and  north to south.
Sidelong travel across the region took four days on camelback.
The three borders of Atars Looking Glass not adjacent to the mountains were marked by low-cresting sand dunes.
The region was named after Atar the Merciless, the Bedine goddess of the sun. According to Bedine legend, the god Kozah wielded the wind to keep it clear of all debris in order for Atar to admire herself in the reflective pebbles that formed what thus referred to as her looking glass.
