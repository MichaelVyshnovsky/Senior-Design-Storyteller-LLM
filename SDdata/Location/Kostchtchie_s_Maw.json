The prison's name derived from the fact it was the one-time prison of [[Kostchtchie]], the [[demon lord]] who had been stripped of his [[Matalotok|favored weapon]] and shackled within by [[Zariel]].",
        "Description": "The infernal prison comprised a {{SIAdj|1000|feet|adj=long}} chasm,''Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus'' states the chasm is {{SI|500|ft}} deep while ''The Harrowing of Hell'' states it is {{SI|200|ft}} deep. filled with the murky, mind-altering waters of the [[River Styx]]. Only a portion of the waters' depth within was visible, however, as what lay beneath was unperceivable from the battleground of Avernus.\n\nBefore it became flooded, Kostchtchie's Maw was an enormous pit set within steep cliff walls. While these cliffsides were traversable with some effort, the journey was precarious and fraught with peril. Within its depths was an enormous [[tar pit]], some {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} wide and {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} deep.",
        "History": "Some time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Kostchtchie was freed from imprisonment within the maw that bore his name. The chasm was then repurposed as a prison for the soul of the Storm King [[Hekaton]], who was bound to [[Toril]] as an undead servant of [[Szass Tam]].",
        "Notable Locations": "Within the bottom of Kostchtchie's Maw was [[Mirror Maelstrom]], a stronghold of black [[iron]] that resembled a twisted facsimile of the [[storm giant]] fortress of [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]] on [[Toril]]. Its surface was crusted over with barnacles composed of hardened magma and [[ward]]ed to protect it from [[divination]] and ''[[teleport]]ation'' magic.",
        "Inhabitants": "When it remained empty, Kostchtchie's Maw held only the demon lord himself, restrained by [[magic]]al [[chain]]s that continuously tightened over the demon lord's form. He was guarded by his infernal jailor, the [[kyton]] [[Mazer]] and his four [[hell hound]] minions.\n\nLater on, Mirror Maelstrom housed a myriad of [[devil]]s that watched over its prisoner, including [[yugoloth]]s and mortal [[Red Wizards]] from the [[Faer√ªn]]ian realm of [[Thay]]."
