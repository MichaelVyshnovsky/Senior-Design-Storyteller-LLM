        "mainbody": "Flask Circle was a small shopping district in the Anvil neighborhood of Ravens Bluff, referred to by some as a \"boutique district.\" It was originally a hidden cul-de-sac, but by late 1370 DR it had opened up and gained direct ingresses from two streets.In the module Scavenger Hunt (1994) an exact location within the city is not given for Flask Circle and its shops. Out of the seven shops that were connected to Flask Circle, only Floras Flower Shop and Healthier Living would reappear within The City of Ravens Bluff, wherein they were both detailed as being located in Anvil in the block of buildings formed by Black Visor Street and Blacktree Boulevard. Maps of Ravens Bluff published after Scavenger Hunt depict no such cul-de-sac behind this block of buildings. This could be explained as a cartographic error brought on by poor internal record keeping of Living City material, but alternatively, it could be explained as having been opened up following the buyout, demolition, and reconstruction of Floras Flowers by the Ampner noble family.\nPaved in cobblestone, this cul-de-sacWhen the Flask Circle makes a reappearance in The Hands of Mohammad no such entry badge is discussed.\nBy 1370 DR, the cul-de-sac housing Flask Circle was opened up into a proper alleyway, with ingresses from Blacktree Boulevard South and Red Wyrm Ride.\nFrom counterclockwise, the shops that lined the Flask Circle were\n* Floras Flower Shop was, as the name implied, a flower shop It was later bought out by the Ampners, who demolished the building and in its place built a four-story apartment building that retained a flower shop on the ground floor.\n* Healthier Living, formerly the site of a laboratory that was run by the potion maker Wendell, was an apothecary shop and clinic run by the cleric Sister Maltornis.\n* Material Assistance, a shop that sold spell components.\n* Modern Ointments, a shop that sold a variety of aromatic oils, candles, incense, and lotions.\n* Ollies Discount Potions, a store that specialized in the buying, selling, and bartering of a wide range of potions.\n* Practical Potions, another store that specialized in selling potions. Its owner typically ran his prices alongside Ollie of Discount Potions to ensure that the two businesses minimized any arbitrage.\n* Supreme Supplies, a shop that sold all manner of alchemy supplies.\n* Wendells laboratory, a potion store that was shut down after its owner was kicked out of the market for having one too many accidents occur within.\n* Winns Ice House, an icehouse business that later occupied the building that once housed Healthier Living."
