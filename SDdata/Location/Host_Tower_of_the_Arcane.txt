{{quote|''Why, and here I'd thought you a Luskanite. Surely you must know of the Hosttower of the Arcane Brotherhood, girl - that body of mages and merchants who '''owns''' the City of Luskan? Well, 'tis of no consequence.''|The Beastlord [[Harshom]]}}

==Description==
The Host Tower was located on [[Cutlass Island]] at the mouth of the [[River Mirar]] in Luskan. It resembled a massive, dead tree with a central spire and four skyward-reaching "limbs" oriented to the cardinal directions. Each of these limbs was covered in lesser spires, towers, and balconies, and contained living quarters, laboratories, summoning chambers, and arcane libraries. The building radiated an aura of magic that many residents found so uncomfortable that they purposely avoided looking at the building.

The top of the central spire was occupied by the leader of the Arcane Brotherhood, the [[Archmage Arcane]]. Each of the Brotherhood's four [[Arcane Brotherhood#Hierarchy|Overwizards]] occupied the limbs and were given titles and duties based on the cardinal direction of their spire. It was said that every apprentice received their own alchemical laboratory and meditation chamber within the Tower.

==Defenses==
While the Host Tower had no obvious physical defenses, it was rumored to have many magical ones. It was a well-known fact that would-be intruders often ended up incinerated or worse.

==History ==
The earliest account of the Host Tower's existence comes from the ''Mirar Saga'', a [[Illuskan|Northlander]] oral tradition recorded in [[1237 DR]] by a loremaster of [[Waterdeep]], which claims the Tower existed during the Northlanders' first migrations to the [[Sword Coast]]. This account would suggest that the Host Tower had existed since at least [[-3000 DR]]. This is significantly earlier than when the Tower was actually built, so the story likely conflated this first migration with a later one.

The Tower was raised by the [[netherese]] arcanist [[Melathlar]] in {{Yearlink|-354}} to protect [[Illusk]] from [[phaerimm]] attacks, an effort which cost Melathlar his life.

In [[95 DR]], Illusk came under attack from [[Uthgar|Uthgar Gardolfsson]] and his raiders from [[Ruathym]]. The [[wizards]] who ruled the city, called the [[Grand Cabal]], fled into the Host Tower and abandoned the city. Without them, [[Stefan Blackspear]] led the people of Illusk in repelling the invaders. He became the first Highlord of Illusk a year later, and immediately decreed that wizards were to be exiled from the city. However, the Grand Cabal persisted in the Host Tower, eventually becoming [[liches]] and weathering no less than three [[orc]] hordes (in [[152 DR]], [[306 DR]], and [[611 DR]], all of which failed to enter or damage the Tower).

It was not until [[806 DR]] that someone managed to penetrate the Host Tower's defenses. [[Laeral Silverhand]] entered the tower and encountered the Cabal, and ultimately sealed the ancient spellcasters back inside.

The Host Tower would serve as the headquarters of the Brotherhood for the next several decades. They became the true rulers of the city, now known as Luskan, and based some of their organization's power structure on the architecture of the Tower. 

In [[1376 DR]], Greeth broke his ''[[staff of the magi]]'' during an invasion of Luskan by [[Waterdeep]]. The resulting explosion was large enough to cause damage as far away as [[Closeguard Island]], and it nearly leveled the Tower and killed most of its inhabitants. For over a century, the Tower was a strange ruin haunted by [[undead]], and the locals would not go near it.

The Host Tower was regenerated in [[1486 DR]]. An effort was mounted to reconstruct it by [[Catti-brie]], [[Gromph Baenre]], Lady [[Avelyere]], and others via the power of Maegera and the root system connecting it to Gauntlgrym. The dwarves of Gauntlgrym marshaled numerous raw materials, including original stone from the Host Tower, and the primordial "grew" the structure out of molten rock at the behest of Cattie-brie.{{Cite digital book/Hero/Kindle||15}} The Arcane Brotherhood was reestablished shortly afterward with the Tower once again as their headquarters.
