        "mainbody": "Chalarstaukh was the largest goblin realm in the Rauvin Mountains in Luruar.\nChalarstaukh was located in the Chalarstaukh caverns in the western foothills of the Rauvin Mountains, not far from Citadel Felbarr.\nIn 1372 DR, King Asglarek and his seven sons ruled Chalarstaukh.\nChalarstaukh was inhabited by goblins, who subsisted on yellow cave-worms. This habit meant that the Chalarstaukh goblins were called \"Worm-Eaters\" by the orcs above, who often raided the goblin warrens.\nIn the 1370s DR, the goblins of Chalarstaukh delved southwest of their home and discovered a number of dwarf tombs. The goblins ransacked the tombs, finding a number of magical items they intended to use against their enemies—if they ever figured out how to use them.\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryGoblin locations\nCategoryLocations in the Rauvin Mountains\nCategoryLocations in Old Delzoun\nCategoryLocations in Luruar\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n4bzc1kvksedxveomtn4fxvq3i1jye81"
