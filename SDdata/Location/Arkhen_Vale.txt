The '''Arkhen Vale''' was a long valley within [[Archendale]], created by the [[River Arkhen]]. Either side of the gorge was beset by steep cliffs leading down into the swift current of the Arkhen.

The [[Dawnpost]] road came into the vale from [[Ordulin]], running alongside the River Arkhen until crossing it at the Arkhen Bridge just north of the city of [[Archenbridge]], before extending further south to [[Daerlun]]. On the other end of the valley was a road leading north from [[White Ford]],

==Description==
The valley floor was rich with lush flora such as ferns, mosses and full of small ponds and waterfalls.
