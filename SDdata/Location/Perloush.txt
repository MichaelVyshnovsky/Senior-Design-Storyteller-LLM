The '''Perloush''' was a great valley in [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].{{Cite polyhedron/96/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Mysterious Turmish|5}}{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|24}}

==Geography==
Lying in the western reaches of Turmish, the Perloush cut westward into the great [[Orsraun Mountains]]. The [[Mountains of the Alaoreum]] rose upward on the northern side of the valley.

At the 'mouth' of the Perloush in the east, the land opened into some of the few plains to be found in Turmish{{Cite polyhedron/101/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Turmish Customers and Festivals|23}}

==Flora & Fauna==
Wild Turmish [[ponies]] once roamed the plains in the mouth of the Perloush, but by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] they were found only in captive herds bred by farmers.{{Cite polyhedron/101/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Turmish Customers and Festivals|22}}
