        "mainbody": "The '''barony of Steeping Falls''', also known as the '''Barony of Blood''', was an ancient realm that existed in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] from the 2{{nd}} to early 5{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It was ruled over by the [[vampire]] mercenary [[Artor Morlin]], referred to as the Baron of Blood.\n\nIt served as a crossroads for traders travelling on and along the [[Delimbiyr River]].{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|37}}",
        "Geography": "The barony encompassed the lands that would later come to be known as the duchy of [[Daggerford]]. It was located between the [[Realm of the Stag|Realm of the Stag, Athalantar]], and the [[Halangorn Forest]], on the north bank of the Delimbiyr River.\n\nIts seat of power was [[Morlin Castle]], which was built atop a hill located that overlooked the river.",
        "History": "The barony was founded in the {{YearlinkName|133}} by Artor Morlin some time after he fled from the [[Shoon Imperium]].\n\nIt came to an end in the {{YearlinkName|403}}, but left a legacy of fear and tales of horrific monstrosities that dwelled within the ruins of the barony's castle. The Baron of Blood fled for the settlement that later came to be known as [[Waterdeep]] and formed a lair within the [[Dungeon of the Crypt]].\n\nA remnant of Morlin Castle could be accessed via the [[Ethereal Plane]]. It was used by Artor Morlin as an emergency redoubt.{{Cite_dungeon/128/Vampires_of_Waterdeep:_The_Fireplace_Level|83}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "By the time a thousand years had passed following the dissolution of the Barony of Steeping Falls, it was viewed a place of myth rather than a historical realm."
