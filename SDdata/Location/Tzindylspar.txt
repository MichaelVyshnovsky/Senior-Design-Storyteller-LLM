Tzindylspar, the City of Rubies, was founded in  by dwarves of Delzoun and humans of Netheril.  
The mountain that marked the location of the city was unremarkable, one of many in the western Nether Mountains northeast of Silverymoon.
Halflings also dwelt here.
A rich corundum vein gave the city its name and brief prestige.
