        "mainbody": "The '''Coast of Cormyr''' was an informal region of the kingdom that consisted of the rural lands along the coast of the [[Dragonmere]]. Though home to the oldest [[human]] settlements in [[Cormyr]], much of the coastal region remained a lightly-inhabited countryside of hidden villages and old, forgotten ruins.",
        "Description": "The coast was a stretch of pastoral lands east of the kingdom's [[Heartlands of Cormyr|heartlands]] and south of the [[East Reaches of Cormyr|east reaches]] frontier, with many villages and hamlets but few towns. It largely consisted of rolling plains interspersed with small valleys and woodlands, the largest of which was the [[Hermit's Wood]], and was watered by many rivers, streams, and marshlands. The lightly-populated coastline had plenty of coves and beaches suitable for landings, making it popular with smugglers and pirates despite the best efforts of the [[Blue Dragons]] and [[Purple Dragons]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Bodies of Water": "* The [[Darkflow River]] emerged from the [[Vast Swamp]] and flowed into the [[Dragonmere]], forming the border between Sembia and Cormyr.\n* The [[Starwater River]] primarily flowed through the [[Cormyr/Heartlands|Heartlands]], but formed part of the western border of the Coast as it turned towards the sea.\n* The [[River Mistwater]] was fed by the [[Evenbrook]] and [[Kirinar Stream]] before flowing into the Dragonmere.\n* The [[Wyvernflow]] passed from the [[Wyvernwater]] in the north, bisecting the coastal region and allowing trade and travel to and from the interior of Cormyr.",
            "Territories": "* [[Starwater]], an earldom east of Marsember across the Starwater.{{Cite dragon annual/2000/After the Dragon: The Kingdom of Cormyr Today|66}}\n* The [[Windcoast]], the farmlands of House [[Arcantlet]] east of the Wyvernflow.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/House Arcantlet}}"
