        "mainbody": "The Coast of Cormyr was an informal region of the kingdom that consisted of the rural lands along the coast of the Dragonmere. Though home to the oldest human settlements in Cormyr, much of the coastal region remained a lightly-inhabited countryside of hidden villages and old, forgotten ruins.\nThe coast was a stretch of pastoral lands east of the kingdoms heartlands and south of the east reaches frontier, with many villages and hamlets but few towns. It largely consisted of rolling plains interspersed with small valleys and woodlands, the largest of which was the Hermits Wood, and was watered by many rivers, streams, and marshlands. The lightly-populated coastline had plenty of coves and beaches suitable for landings, making it popular with smugglers and pirates despite the best efforts of the Blue Dragons and Purple Dragons.\nThe coast generally referred to the rural lands east of Marsember and the Starwater River, along the Way of the Manticore up to the border of Sembia at the Vast Swamp and Darkflow River.\n* The Darkflow River emerged from the Vast Swamp and flowed into the Dragonmere, forming the border between Sembia and Cormyr.\n* The Starwater River primarily flowed through the Heartlands, but formed part of the western border of the Coast as it turned towards the sea.\n* The River Mistwater was fed by the Evenbrook and Kirinar Stream before flowing into the Dragonmere.\n* The Wyvernflow passed from the Wyvernwater in the north, bisecting the coastal region and allowing trade and travel to and from the interior of Cormyr.\n* Starwater, an earldom east of Marsember across the Starwater.\n* The Windcoast, the farmlands of House Arcantlet east of the Wyvernflow.\n* Battlerise, a hamlet just east of the Darkflow River and Sembia, below the ruins of Battlegate.\n* Blustich, a small village between the Hermits Wood and Wyvernflow.\n* Bogbrook, a farming village near the Starwater, notorious for its country bumpkins.\n* Dawngleam, a coastal town and easternmost harbor in the realm.\n* Dreamers Rock, a village in the lee of the hill of the same name north of the Way of the Manticore.\n* Gladehap, a prosperous village in the wooded valley of Lost Lake.\n* Gorthin, a hamlet north of Kirinwood amid bogs that fed into the Evenbrook.\n* Helduls Rest, a waystop along the Way of the Manticore east of Wheloon.\n* Kallamarn, a farming village on the bank of the Starwater.\n* Kirinwood, a large village on the Kirinar Stream.\n* Moonever, a fishing village at the east side of the Starwaters mouth.\n* Monksblade, a hamlet founded on the ruins of four monasteries.\n* Nesmyth, a troubled, environmentally-disastrous village north of Marsember.\n* Onguls Water, a placid village on a small lake near the Starwater.\n* Smugglers Stone, a small fishing village historically favored by smugglers.\n* Wheloon, a large town on the Wyvernflow river.\n* Wormtower, an obscure village notable for its destroyed wizard tower and dragon skeleton.\n* Daunthers, a royal estate that housed and cared for physically disabled Purple and Blue Dragons.\n* Downshield Keep, the country manor of the Downshield family.\n* Draegur High, a ruined castle used as a War Wizards base, then sold to the Ridinghound family.\n* Oldspires, the manorial home of the noble Halaunt family lying southeast of Northbank.\n* Battlegate, a ruined castle atop a hill near Battlerise, former home of the Auantiver family.\n* Eastbridge, the bridge over the Darkflow River that crossed into the Westward of Sembia.\n* Marsarks Grove, a site north of Wheloon near a slate quarry.\n* Netherese portal, an ancient portal built upon by a temple of Tyche that became Monksblade.\n* The Blister Trail, a path that followed the shore of Wyvernwater between Immersea and Wheloon.\n* The Bluemist Trail, a long trail that ran along the coast of the Dragonmere through Dawngleam and up the Darkflow River.\n* The Mistwood Trail, a country road that ran from Dawngleam to Wheloon.\n* The Water Trail, a path that went from Kirinwood across the border of Sembia to Seaspring and Nolin.\n* The Way of the Manticore, a major highway that ran east from Hilp through Wheloon into Sembia."
