'''Maerstar''' was a town in [[the Vast]], situated at the point where [[Helve's Trail]] from [[High Haspur]] ended at the [[North Road]] between [[Procampur]] and [[Sevenecho]]. It lay near the [[Earthfast Mountains]] and south of the [[Brynwood]].

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]], [[1358 DR]], many merchants of Procampur and [[Tsurlagol]] fled to take refuge in their country houses in Maerstar. However, refugees from [[Tantras]], [[Calaunt]], and even [[Mulmaster]] also came through Maerstar, and looting mobs of them harassed the wealthy merchants. Some were slain by the mobs.

When a well in the neighboring [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] was poisoned on [[Eleint 1]] in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Maerstar was unwilling to send aid, fearing that they too would be attacked by [[Calispar Delgorth|those responsible]].{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}

==Economy==
The town made its living in quarrying and breeding [[horse]]s. The town was a center for breeding horses, and had a number of well-used paddocks. In particular, the people of Maerstar bred a large, black, sleek-coated horse that was highly sought after all around the [[Inner Sea]].

==Description==
[[File:Vipers Map of Brynwood.jpg|thumb|left|''A map of the lands around Sevenecho.'']]
Despite the popularity of Maerstar's horses, it was not a town of great wealth, but its people earned their prosperity with hard work. In contrast, Maerstar was also home to a number of country houses belonging to merchants of Procampur and Tsurlagol.

==Local Legends==
To protect their treasures, the merchants harassed during the Troubles buried them in the paddocks, but not all survived to retrieve them afterwards. According to a local rumor in the years afterwards, at least two of these treasures still lay buried around Maerstar by [[1370 DR]]: a collection of [[moonstone]]s and [[pearl]]s belonging to the Procampan merchant [[Uligker Oloskar]], and a hoard of coins and trade-bars that belonged to [[Shondarl Stonegiant]], a [[locksmith]] and supplier of trained dancers.

One more local legend was that of the [[Moonlit Tower]], which sat—occasionally—on a crag northwest of the town.
