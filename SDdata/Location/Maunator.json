        "History": "It was disintegrated in {{Yearlink|-1657}} in an accident caused by poorly planned spell research. The spell that led to the enclave's destruction was ''Sunrest sunshock'', a significantly more powerful version of the spell ''[[meteor swarm]]''. \n\nAfter its destruction, the abandoned mines of [[Dekanter]] became the premiere site of Netherese arcane research."
