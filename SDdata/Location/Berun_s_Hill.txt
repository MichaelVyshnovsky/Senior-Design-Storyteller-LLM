'''Berun's Hill''' was a  bare-topped, conical hill that commanded a splendid view of the valley of the [[Dessarin River]] to the east.

==History==
The hill was used as a lookout for advancing [[barbarian]]s and [[orc]] hordes from north and east. The hill got its name from the [[ranger]] [[Berun]]. He was slain by an orc horde but managed to take 300 tuskers with him, before they overwhelmed him.

In [[1351 DR]], a group of fifty [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[priest]]s of [[Marthammor Duin]] discovered the dwarven tomb that had long been talked about in legends of [[the North]]. They found that this cavernous crypt belonged to none other than Maegar, of the [[Royal House of the Helm]] of [[Gharraghaur]], and that it had been plundered long ago by [[duergar]].

==Rumors and Legends==
Legend tells that under the hill lay the grave of an ancient dwarf with rich [[gold]]en armor and treasures, but none ever found it.
