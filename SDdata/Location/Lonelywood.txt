Lonelywood was a town in Ten Towns within the cold region of Icewind Dale. It was known as being the "first choice" for rogues seeking a refuge in Icewind Dale.
This northernmost town was surrounded by the Lonelywood Forest, with Maer Dualdon on the west side and the Bryn Shander Trail on the east. By 1351 DR, Lonelywood consisted of mere several dozens of low wooden cabins and inhabited for people who wanted to disappear from other parts of the world, a place where "the rogues of rogues hid out".
The Lonelywood Forest was rich with fir trees, allowing Lonelywood to be the main producer of lumber in Icewind Dale. The trees from Lonelywood were used to build all structures across the Ten Towns. The timber gets carted from Lonelywood to Termalaine or Targos, and occasionally, to Bryn Shander. The town maintained insignificant fishing fleet, easily overshadowed by all nine of other neighboring towns.
Lonelywoods spirit of community was strong. A successful hunter was bound to share their catch, beyond one full meal a day, equally among the inhabitants of the town.
Small in size, lacking in walls, Lonelywood, along with Termalaine, were two of the most raided towns of Ten Towns and gladly accepted aid from their neighbors during the times of strife.
As of the , there were no settlements north of Termalaine. The land surrounding the Lonely Wood held nothing more than several logging camps and trapper huts. The town truly was born with the construction of the famous Whistling Gallows Inn. Soon after, houses started appearing around the inn, and more people started settling in the secluded northernmost town. Only shortly before the , Lonelywood was recognized by the council of the Icewind Dale.
It was believed that Lonelywoods very humble growth and development was caused by the rise of the barbarian king Wylfdene, who united the Uthgardt tribes of the Bear, the Elk, and the Great Whale to drive the southern peoples of the Ten-Towns away from Icewind Dale in 1281 DR. Without the military campaign that was centered around Lonelywood that stood in front of the encroaching army, the town wouldve likely never become anything more than a scant collection of secluded huts.
By the , Lonelywood was an establishment town with its own landmark â€“ the Whistling Gallows. A tradition was born among those who stayed at the inn to carve their names into the huge old tree that grew outside the establishment.
Before Drizzt DoUrden journeyed to Icewind Dale, Regis was the "leader" of the town, but in 1351 DR after Wulfgars people raided Ten Towns, Regis retired as council spokesman, although the city continued to use him to "market" the town. Even after his move to Mithral Hall, he maintained a home there for some time.
Muldoon became the next town spokesman in 1351 DR. He was originally from Waterdeep, but came to Lonelywood with his father when his father was kicked out of Waterdeep (although he later returned). Muldoon became a successful merchant and council spokesman. However, sometime before 1369 DR, Regis returned to the Speakers seat following his predecessors demise inside a Yeti. The folk of Lonelywood asked the Halfling Hero to lead the city once more, with the blessing of Bruenor Battlehammer.
During Regis return to the Speakers seat, he operated out of his humble store, the Bone Works. He was visited by a group of adventurers who were tasked with uncovering the location of the long-lost Accursed Tower that disappeared off the coast of Maer Dualdon circa 1269 DR. Subsequently, with the halflings help, the adventurers discovered that the tower of Damien Morienus stood across from Lonelywood, on the western side of the lake.
Regis returned to Lonelywood in 1483 DR and once again purchased a house there, spending time "fishing" in Maer Dualdon. In the forest not far from his house, Catti-brie built a small garden shrine to Mielikki.
In time of war, Lonelywood could muster a militia of around 100 humans who were armed with dwarven weapons and light armor.
