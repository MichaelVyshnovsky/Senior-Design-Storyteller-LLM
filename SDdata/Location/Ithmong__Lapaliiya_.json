        "mainbody": "'''Ithmong''', known as the '''Stormwracked City''', was a city in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "It stood on the [[Lapal Way]] on top of a cliff that stood 50 feet (15 meters) high at the head of Ithmong Bay and beside Ithmong Peninsula. Owing to its position, Ithmong suffered the majority of storms that traversed the [[Shining Sea]], hence its title.",
        "Government & Religion": "The ruler of Ithmong held the title \"shoonsar\", a hereditary position. Around [[1373 DR]], it was led by Shoonsar [[Darhost Tharsuir|Darhost \"the Mongrel\" Tharsuir]]. It was the next most politically powerful city in Lapaliiya after the capital, [[Sheirtalar]]. In practice, the Overking of Lapaliiya needed to negotiate with the Shoonsar to have decrees passed by the Grand Council.\n\nThe civic deity of Ithmong was [[Bhaelros]], also known as [[Talos]], the Storm Lord.",
        "Population": "Despite the havoc wreaked by the storms, Ithmong was a metropolis of 46,729 people, the second largest in Lapaliiya after Sheirtalar.",
        "Economy": "Ithmong's docks were constructed inside a series of a dozen linked seacaves at the base of the cliffs. Together, they gave the city an underground port district. A high volume of goods from the Lapaliiyan hinterlands and [[Halruaa]] passed through these, making it the second richest city in the realm."
