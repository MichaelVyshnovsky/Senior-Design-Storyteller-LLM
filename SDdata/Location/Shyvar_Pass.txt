'''Shyvar Pass''' was a mountain pass across the [[Tannath Mountains]] on their eastern side.

==Geography==
The pass lay east of [[Tannath Mountains]], varying its width from {{SI|10|miles|k|long=yes}} at points to {{SI|100|yards|long=yes}} at others. It separated [[Umbergoth]] and the rest of the Tannath.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|98}}

==Defenses==
The eastern reaches were guarded by the [[Umber Marshes]] and the [[River Umber]] itself, and to the south lay the [[Watchwall]] and [[Glarondar]], making attacks from [[Thay]] a risky proposition. Most [[Aglarondan]]s did not take the threat of invasion from Shyvar Pass seriously, but the pass was still regularly patrolled by horsemen.
By {{yearlink|1372}}, the pass was watched by watchtowers instead. They mostly greeted caravans rather than fight at the time.

==History==
As of {{yearlink|1202}}, [[Thay]]an forces had attempted to take Aglarond through several routes, including the pass itself{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|124}} several times over the centuries.
In {{yearlink|1365}}, a Thayan force was spotted by Aglarondan griffonriders, while a second Thayan force marched towards Emmech along another route. The Aglarondan forces, after pushing back the force in Shyvar Pass, went around and attacked the second force at [[Emmech]].{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|147}}{{cite book/Unapproachable East|105}} The [[Chosen of Mystra]] [[Alvaerele Tasundrym]] and the [[Red Wizard]] [[Selemvarr]] had a brief fight in the Pass.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|148}}
