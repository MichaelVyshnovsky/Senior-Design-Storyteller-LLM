        "mainbody": "Abreon was a large town in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14th century DR.\nThis inland town lay amidst low rolling hills. These were strewn with fields, vineyards, and olive groves.\nAround 1373 DR, it was governed by a council of wealthy farmers.\nThe civic deity of Abreon was Lliira the Joybringer.\nThe area was once the location of a great battle fought between the besieged defenders of Lapaliiya and the invading forces of Serpentes, which finally conquered the land in the Year of Sunned Serpents, –189 DR.\nBarrows dating back to the last battle between Lapaliiya and Serpentes still lay hidden in the fields around Abreon in the 14th century DR. Occasionally, undead humanoids and serpentfolk creeped out to terrorize the people of the area."
