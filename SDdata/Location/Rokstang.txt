'''Rokstang''' was a city in [[Tabot]].

==Geography==
It stood in northern Tabot, near the headwaters of one of the rivers there. A road from Rokstang joined that linking [[Fij]] and [[Draya]] to the [[Lokar Pass]] and [[Ji]] far to the south.{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}

==Trade==
Clay was gathered from the lands south of Rokstang. This was made into pottery by the lamas at [[Pokarr Gompa]], and their works were renowned throughout Tabot.

==History==
Rokstang was inundated by a great flood in {{YearlinkConvert|2601|SY}}, before [[Mo Kin]], Abbot of Pokaar, used one of the ''[[golden eggs of Ghastar]]'' to stop the flood.<ref>

Later, workers excavating a deep irrigation canal in Rokstang unearthed an extensive network of caverns. Furthermore, these contained a ruined city built entirely of [[brass]] that seemed to have suffered some great catastrophe. Afterward, the river began to dry up, possibly due to freezing high in the mountains, which led the lands around Rokstang to suffer drought. Believing a curse to have befallen Rokstang, in {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, the dzong-pon (sheriff) of the district sought courageous warriors to join him on an expedition into the brass city to end it.<ref>

==Rumors & Legends==
A blind beggar here told a tale that he and his companions had discovered a lost mine, stuffed with [[diamond]]s and other [[gem]]stones, deep in the [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]]. But a wrathful [[spirit]] attacked and slew them, and the beggar barely got away with his life. Blinded by either the spirit or the sun, he wandered a glacier for days before being found and taken to Rokstang, where he still lived in 2607.<ref>
