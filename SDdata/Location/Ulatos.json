        "Geography": "Ulatos was located a few miles inland along the Payit River. It was centered around a great plaza, around which were pyramid-temples. The temple of [[Qotal]], which was the biggest and greatest, had a magical spring on top of it.<ref> The city itself was full of gardens and fountains.<ref>",
        "Inhabitants": "Ulatos was inhabited by Maztican humans of the [[Payit (ethnicity)|Payit ethnic]] group. They spoke their own language, also called [[Payit language|Payit]].",
        "Society": "Ulatos was the center of Payit culture and the capital of the Payit nation. The Payits were a peaceful people, and villagers tended toward practicality in their education, but in the city of Ulatos the ancient curiosity and learning of the people thrived. Their sages were especially knowledgeable about biology and astronomy.\n\nThe Payit people worshiped the [[Maztican pantheon]], especially the god Qotal. Unlike their western neighbors, they did not practice human sacrifice.\n\nLike many Maztican cities and nation, Ulatos was ruled by a Revered Counselor. It was also the capital of Payit.",
        "History": "Millenia before the rise of [[Nexal]], the peoples of Payit and [[Far Payit]] had a great civilization. Their sages and scholars had great knowledge, and their physicians could treat nearly any injury or illness. Great works of art and magic were created, and a mighty stone highway was built connecting the cities of Ulatos and [[Tulom-Itzi]].\n\nThis golden age ended when a prince of Tulom-Itzi came to desire a princess of Ulatos. She was already betrothed to another prince, so he plotted to steal her away by force. Ultimately, his plan failed, ending with his death and her's. Not long afterwards, the culture of Payit and Far Payit began to decline for mysterious reasons, with people simply leaving the cities. The cities fell into ruins, and knowledge was lost.\n\nNot long after the decline, a small group of [[Dog People]] arrived in the [[Valley of Nexal]]. After Nexal's rise, merchants from that city began to travel to Payit to trade.<ref>\n\nIn [[1361 DR]] ships belonging to the [[Golden Legion]] from [[Amn]] arrived to the shores of Ulatos. This was the first location in continental Maztica that they encountered in their expedition. A priest of [[Zaltec]] and armed Payit warriors attacked a group of the Amnish soldiers, which led to the start of a war between Ulatos and the Golden Legion. The Golden Legion, although vastly outnumbered by the Payit warriors, decisively defeated the Payit and captured their city. Following this they turned the city into a colony of Amn and built the fort of [[Helmsport]] next to it. <ref>From Ulatos, the legion then marched westwards towards [[Nexal]]."
