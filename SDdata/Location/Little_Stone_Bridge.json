        "mainbody": "The Little Stone Bridge was found just outside of the city of Manass in Khazari.\nThe bridge straddled a small river that flowed by Manass on the south and west sides of the city, allowing road access to Manass from the west.\nNatives of Manass believed that a powerful oni used to live beneath the bridge. The oni would attack any travelers crossing the bridge during the cover of darkness. Tsikapasmatra was believed to have defeated the oni in combat. The onis treasure was rumored to be buried somewhere near the bridge, but was never discovered. However, this did not stop the locals of Manass from selling treasure maps for the area."
