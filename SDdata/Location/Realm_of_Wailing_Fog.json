        "mainbody": "The Realm of Wailing Fog was a mysterious land found on the eastern edge of the Hullack Forest and west of the Thunder Peaks mountain range in Cormyr.\nThe realm was a collection of permanently mist-covered secluded fens with eerie calls echoing through it. By the 14 century DR, the misty wetland hid long-ruined towers. Everyone who traversed the Hullack Forest or passed along the East Way that curved south towards the nearby Realm of Wailing Fog, testified of a strange and sinister feeling of being watched.\nDuring the century that followed the Spellplague, the magical chaos did not affect the Realm of Wailing Fog. The land remade a forbidding mystery. None dared enter the Realm, not even the Eldreth Veluuthra. In the 15 century DR, there were unsubstantiated rumors that claimed that the Realm of Wailing Fog was home to a coven of hags."
