        "Description": "The realm was a collection of permanently mist-covered secluded fens with eerie calls echoing through it. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the misty wetland hid long-ruined towers. Everyone who traversed the Hullack Forest or passed along the [[East Way]] that curved south towards the nearby Realm of Wailing Fog, testified of a strange and sinister feeling of being watched.",
        "History": "During the century that followed the [[Spellplague]], the magical chaos did not affect the Realm of Wailing Fog. The land remade a forbidding mystery. None dared enter the Realm, not even the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]]. In the 15{{th}} century DR, there were unsubstantiated rumors that claimed that the Realm of Wailing Fog was home to a coven of [[hag]]s."
