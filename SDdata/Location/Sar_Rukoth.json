        "mainbody": "'''Sar'Rukoth''', known to outsiders as the '''Ruins of the Serpent Kings''', was the capital of [[Okoth]].",
        "Description": "Appearing outwardly as a sprawling and half-buried ruin of low walls and crumbling monuments, a small central island was secretly inhabited and served as the seat of power for Okoth. Underground, the city was connected by narrow crawl spaces and corridors that were dark and humid, and further down were catacombs, grottos, and underground pools of salt water.\n\nBeyond this central portion that comprised the inhabited capital, the broader Ruins of the Serpent Kings sprawled across a wide area and were rumored to conceal vast wealth.",
        "Geography": "It sat on a low hill on the edge of the [[Lake of Salt]]. During the wetter time of the year,  the water level rose, flooding the catacombs and turned the hill into an island.",
        "Government": "The city was led by a council of eighteen [[sarrukh]] led by a [[khuzdar]], or \"imperator\". Each councilor held a unique title describing their expertise and was the leader of their respective clans. During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they were led by a [[priest]] named [[Pil'it'ith]], who was lord of [[Clan Sar'Ruuss]]. As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, the khuzdar was [[Ziss'thiss]], whose influence was spread across [[Faerûn]].",
        "Defenses": "The secrecy of the city was maintained by a [[magic]]al field that filled intruders with dread, causing all but the bravest interlopers to leave in fear.",
        "History": "Okoth was the first of the ancient sarrukh realms (founded ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-35000}}), and Sar'Rukoth had been its ancient capital. When the realm went into decline, the sarrukh of Okoth retreated into Sar'Rukoth.\n\nFollowing the [[Time of Troubles]] ({{Yearlink|1358}}), the inhabitants turned away from their patron [[god]], [[Sseth]], as he had grown quiet. While serpentkind across [[Faerûn]] sought to reawaken their god, the inhabitants of Sar'Rukoth instead venerated the god [[Set]] under the guidance of Pil'it'ith, who in truth had struck a deal with Set to bind Sseth in eternal slumber. This soon invited reprisals by the [[khaasta]]s, and then during the events of the [[Spellplague]] ({{Yearlink|1385}} - {{Yearlink|1395}}), all of Okoth came under attack by serpentfolk seeking to stamp out its heresy. Pil'it'ith and his followers were slain, and not long after, Sseth reawakened and Set began to fade.\n\nAs of {{Yearlink|1479}}, the sarrukh of Sar'Rukoth continued to bide their time and build up their strength away from the prying eyes of the outside world.",
        "Notable Locations": "* The crumbling ruins included a series of new, unlit domes of the late 15{{th}} century DR. Each dome contained one of the eighteen sarrukh councilors and all of that sarrukh's servants, protectors, advisers, and entertainers, most of them being [[yuan-ti]]. They were connected by a system of tunnels that passed through various salt lakes, caves, and sarrukh tombs.\n* A pyramid occupied by wereserpent and [[human]] cultists was notable for its [[Obsidian Ziggurat|dark twin]] in the [[Shadowfell]].\n* The [[Vaults of Record]] were a long-since plundered area of the Ruins of the Serpent Kings near the village of [[Buldamar]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Sar'Rukoth had long been home to the sterile sarrukh and their yuan-ti servants. Following the city's alliance to the [[church of Set]], wereserpents came into existence and settled in the city, and a contingent of [[werecrocodile]]s immigrated to the city on the orders of Set's ally, [[Sebek]]."
