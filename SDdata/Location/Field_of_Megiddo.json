        "mainbody": "The Field of Megiddo, was a plain on the Avernus layer of Baator. It was one of the many battlefields of the Blood War.\nThis battlefield was located somewhere close to Ankhwugaht Prime, a small divine realm in Avernus belonging to the Mulhorandi god Set.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff found themselves in the plane of Baator, at a spot overlooking the Field of Megiddo, At that time, a group of blue dragons were in flight from Megiddo, having taken a severe beating from tanarri, and they quickly sprung an attack upon the Ravenians. When the adventurers eventually managed to return to the Prime Material plane, they startled their benefactor Simon Regulus, who had just managed to find the Field of Megiddo in an ornate mirror he was scrying with.\nAccording to some legends, the Field of Megiddo was destined to one day be the site of the final battle of the Blood War."
