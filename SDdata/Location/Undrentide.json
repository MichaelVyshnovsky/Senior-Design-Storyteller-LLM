        "mainbody": "'''Undrentide''' was a [[Netheril|Netherese]] flying city that floated in the south east of their territory, near the western border of what was then the [[Border Forest|Eastern Forest]].\n\nIt crashed to the earth when [[Karsus]] cast the spell that momentarily made him the god of magic. It was buried under the sands of [[Anauroch]] and forgotten, until the [[medusa]] [[sorceress]] [[Heurodis]] discovered a powerful artifact that allowed her to reawaken the ''[[mythallar]]'' that powered the city, gaining its powers for herself but also becoming a [[lich]] in the process. The city was rising to the skies again at her command when [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]] and companions, who had followed her after she killed their master, confronted Heurodis and destroyed her along with the mythallar, fleeing to the [[Plane of Shadow]] as the city fell back to the earth a second time.<ref>"
