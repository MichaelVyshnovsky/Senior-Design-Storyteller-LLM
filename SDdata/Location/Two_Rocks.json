        "mainbody": "'''Two Rocks''' was a small rocky island in the harbor of [[New Velar|Harrowdale Town]] (later New Velar). As of [[1368 DR]], it was believed to be the location of hidden treasure, stored by pirates such as [[Urthag|Urthag the Knife]] and the [[Masked Marquis]], although up until that time, no treasure had been found there.\n\nAs of 1368 DR, the [[Council of Seven Burghers]], the ruling council of [[Harrowdale]], were considering building a sea tower on the island to provide further defenses for the port, against the \"one or two privateer night raids per season\" that were endured at that time. It would have seen a bridge constructed from the island to the rocks known as the Shoulder.\n\nAlthough in 1368 DR, the idea of constructing a defensive tower was generally seen as good, it was notably opposed by the newest Burgher, the wizard [[Erethun Rivenstave]], based on its proposed cost."
