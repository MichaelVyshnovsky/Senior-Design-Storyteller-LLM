'''Skull Gorge''' was a long gorge that ran along the northernmost stretch of the [[River Reaching]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Geography==
The gorge was situated along the River Reaching, just downstream of the [[Misty Stair]] waterfalls.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/Skull Gorge}} The [[Sunset Mountains]] lay to the southeast, with the [[Battle of Bones]] situated to the north, the [[Hill of Lost Souls]] to the northwest, and [[Darkhold]] due south. The [[Well of Dragons]] lay just east of Skull Gorge.

===Geographical Features===
Skull Gorge was very steep and narrow, appearing almost like a cut in the surrounding terrain, with its walls running almost to the edge of the River Reaching. The gorge's pale whitestone walls were pockmarked with caverns.

==History==
Back during the [[Dawn Age]], the Skull Gorge made up part of the [[giant]] kingdom of [[Grunfesting]]. It also served as a refuge for some of the first [[human]]s in [[Faerûn]], who were tolerated by the giants and lived within caves in the sides of the valley.{{Cite web enhancement/Dungeon 133 Map and Handout Supplement|26}}

In {{yearlink|-1145}}, a group of [[Netherese]] established a town called [[Holloway]] in one of the gorge's caverns to act as a base of operations for their explorations of the ancient human and giant ruins. Its founders hoped to discover some ancient form of [[magic]] comparable to the [[Nether Scrolls]], but ultimately they found nothing. Becoming isolated from the rest of [[Netheril]], the town was gradually taken over by the church of [[Jergal]].

Following the fall of Netheril in {{yearlink|-339}}, Holloway's population started to dwindle until it was fully abandoned by {{yearlink|-270}}.

In the {{yearlinkName|1090}}, a massive [[orc]]ish and [[goblinoid]] horde threatened to overrun [[Northwest Faerûn|the North]], but was stopped by the combined forces of the goodly races at the site of the Battle of Bones. The diminished goblinoid survivors of the battle sought refuge at Skull Gorge&mdash;known as River Reaching Gorge at the time&mdash;hoping to use the area's many caves to hide out and tend to their wounds. However, they were pursued by an army comprising mainly [[human]]s who were intent on wiping out the horde entirely.

A desperate last stand ensued, with the goblinoid forces summoning [[fiend]]s to help them, including [[tanar'ri]],The ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' (1e) refers to these creatures as "malebranche", but this article uses the term "horned devil" to avoid confusion with another type of devil named [[malebranche]], introduced in later editions of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. A large disembodied and fire-wreathed skull was observed floating mid-air during the battle, scorching the attackers with its fiery breath. Although the orcs and goblinoids were utterly destroyed, many [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s outlived their summoners, forcing the victorious human army to swiftly abandon the gorge without looting the area.

The sage [[Elminster Aumar]] later questioned the reports of extraplanar assistance, ascribing it rather to inspired [[illusion]] work, especially since the goblinoids were so decisively crushed. So many [[hobgoblin]]s died at Skull Gorge that even 300 years later, their population across [[Faerûn]] remained at a historic low.

In the 14th century DR, Skull Gorge was inhabited by several tribes of orcs and goblinoids, most of which were controlled by the [[Zhentarim]]. The goblinoids received supplies and reinforcements from the nearby bastion of Darkhold, and in return they left Zhentarim caravans in peace, and aided the Zhents in fighting off [[Cormyr]]ian incursions into [[Yellow Snake Pass]].

==Rumors & Legends==
{{Fq|text=[&hellip;] to risk life or limb pursuing the rumor is a fool's quest.|source=Elminster, referring to the hidden treasure of Skull Gorge.|width=260px}}
Rumors told of hidden treasure in the caverns of Skull Gorge, hastily concealed by the orcish and goblinoid forces as they prepared to defend themselves. Although some few caches of treasure were found, most adventurers who sought these hidden riches never returned, falling prey to the dangerous creatures who made the gorge their home.

Among the tribes of the Goblin Marches, the warlord [[Izac Uthor]] was rumored to have escaped the battle at Skull Gorge alive. Some goblin elders believed he would one day return to lead his people, but few others took this seriously.

==Inhabitants==
When it was part of the giant kingdom of Grunfesting, the caverns that lined the walls of the gorge were largely inhabited by tribes of [[stone giant]]s. As the power of the kingdom waned over time, they allowed small tribes of primitive humans to settle alongside them.

In the 1350s and 1360s DR, the gorge was largely thought to be deserted, but was in fact inhabited by Zhentarim-controlled tribes of goblinoids and orcs.

The [[Melial]] tribe of hobgoblins and orcs lived near Skull Gorge. Direct descendants of the survivors of the Battle of Bones, this tribe was noted for their unusual affinity for [[magic]], and a high occurrence of [[lycanthropy]].

The [[Church of Velsharoon]] maintained a major temple, the [[Crypt of the Arisen Army]], beneath Skull Gorge, its entrance carefully hidden among its steep walls and deep caverns. The subterranean temple was surrounded by a settlement known as [[Necropolis]]. The site, known as the [[Forgotten Crypt]], was once inhabited by Velsharoon himself in his mortal life, and was situated on top of a buried [[Netherese]] city. The [[cleric|priests]] of Velsharoon's temple were known as "Cryptskulls", and were led by a [[necrophant]] called Baron [[Vjurn Blacktower]]. From their temple base they extended their influence across Skull Gorge all the way to the Battle of Bones, having raised a legion of undead to enforce their hegemony.It is unclear how the priests of Velsharoon were able to lay claim to all of Skull Gorge at the same time the area was controlled by the Zhentarim.
