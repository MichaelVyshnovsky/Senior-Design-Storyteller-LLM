'''Forgefires''' was a small [[dwarven]] stronghold located in [[Fimbrul]], [[Laerakond]].

==Background==
The dwarves of Forgefires were xenophobic and only allowed other dwarves to enter in their domain. Even so, unfamiliar dwarves were treated with suspicion as well.

==Architecture==
Forgefires was built in tunnels too small for [[giant]]s or [[dragon]]s to enter them. The stronghold had hundreds of hidden tunnels and doors, and the deeper cellars were located in volcanic rifts where the dwarves forged all manner of stuff.
