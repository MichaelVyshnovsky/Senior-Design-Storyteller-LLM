Military camp
Camp Righteous was an Order of the Gauntlet military outpost in Chult that was established, and destroyed, during the 15 century DR. 
The camp was located on the River Soshenstar in the northern regions of the Chultan jungles. It was built around the Chultan structure known as the House of the Crocodile.
It had no defensive structures, a fact that contributed to its fall.
Before its abandonment, the camp was led by an arrogant commander whose decisions cost the lives of many of her templars. Then, a matter of months before the death curse was set upon Faer√ªn, Camp Righteous was overrun by undead leaving only a few survivors who fled south to Camp Vengeance. The commander lost her life in this retreat, but rose again as a revenant obsessed with pursuing her former subordinates, believing they had betrayed her.
Following its destruction, the camp was watched over the batiri goblin boss Yakka and her tribe, who took up residence within the House of the Crocodile.
