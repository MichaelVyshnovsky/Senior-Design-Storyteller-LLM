'''Camp Righteous''' was an [[Order of the Gauntlet]] military outpost in [[Chult]] that was established, and destroyed, during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Location==
The camp was located on the [[River Soshenstar]] in the northern regions of the Chultan jungles. It was built around the Chultan structure known as the [[House of the Crocodile]].

==Defenses==
It had no defensive structures, a fact that contributed to its fall.

==History==
Before it's abandonment, the camp was led by an arrogant commander whose decisions cost the lives of many of her templars. Then, a matter of months before the [[death curse]] was set upon [[Faerûn]], Camp Righteous was overrun by [[undead]] leaving only a few survivors who fled south to [[Camp Vengeance]]. The commander lost her life in this retreat, but rose again as a [[revenant]] obsessed with pursuing her former subordinates, believing they had betrayed her.

Following its destruction, the camp was watched over the [[batiri]] [[goblin|goblin boss]] [[Yakka]] and her tribe, who took up residence within the House of the Crocodile.
