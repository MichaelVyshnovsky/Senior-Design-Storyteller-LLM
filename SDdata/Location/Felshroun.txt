The '''Free Barony of Felshroun''' was an independent town located in the [[Border Kingdoms]].
==Geography==
Felshroun was a diamond-shaped walled town located on the cross-road between [[Blacksaddle]], [[Realm of the Smoking Star]] and [[Shandolphyn's Reach]] along the north-west coast of the Border Kingdoms. Felshroun laid claim to the fertile meadows and small forests north of the [[Duskwood]], between Lammatar's Water and the West Dusking River.

Felshroun was a crowded labyrinthine town. Narrow streets and alleys winded around buildings up to five stories high. 
==Government==
Felshroun was ruled by a Free Baron, who was elected to rule for a decade. 

The Free Baron ruled from the [[Hall of Domes]], located at the center of Felshroun. It was from there the Free Baron acted as judge for criminal proceedings, financial disputes and merchant negotiations. Diplomats and important visitors were hosted within the Hall of Domes. the building contained the towns armory and dungeon. 

The Free Baron appointed three individuals called the Knights of Justice as magistrates for the town. The Free Baron was protected by an all-women bodyguard detail. The detail, made up of veteran former pirates from the [[Inner Sea]] area, were heavily armed and each carried a ''[[hold person wand]]''.

The true power in Felshroun were the Four Mages. The Four Mages were a relatively rare group in [[Faerûn]], as four powerful [[wizard]]s who agreed to live near each other in peace was indeed a rarity in the Realms. Each mage lived in one of the four towers along the walls of the town, were they lived in seclusion to focus on their magical studies or teaching their apprentices. Each of the Four Mages had apprentices, totalling about three dozen in total.

==Trade==
Felshroun is famous for its [[horse]]s. Merchants from as far away as [[Tashalar]] and the [[Vilhon Reach]] travel to the town yearly to purchase Felshrounan horses. 

The town hosts a thriving local economy as well. Felshroun has two shopping districts, Fendle Street and Lorndragon Lane. Fendle Street is lined with small retailers and pawn shops selling all sorts of goods, and is the location of several taverns. Lorndragon Lane is a smaller street with shops catering to fine goods and items, such as [[gem]]s and high fashion. Storrockh Street hosts stables for travellers and shops that rent and sell carts or coaches.

Houndworm Street was home to Felshroun's black market and red light district. Due to the frequent fights and robberies, the street was heavily patrolled by the Foresters.

==Defenses==
The town was protected by a diamond-shaped wall. At each corner of the wall was a tower, were the Four Mages lives. Each tower was heavily defended by various magical [[trap]]s. 

Felshroun's defence was maintained by a company of [[ranger]]s called the Foresters. In addition to defense of the town and its territory, the Foresters assisted the citizens in planting crops, repairing irrigation channels and the removal of diseased plants. Like most rangers, their uniforms were designed to blend in with the forest. Their [[leather armor]] was brown, green and grey. They each wore a maroon [[sash]] across their midriff, which had their unit symbol upon it, a silver falcon atop a bear's paw.

The Foresters mounted regular patrols of a dozen units on horseback, with each unit accompanied by either a priest of [[Chauntea]] or [[Mielikki]], or an apprentice of the Four Mages. The ranking member of each patrol wears a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'' and a hunting horn cast from [[silver]].

A pseudo-militia called the Watchers assist the Foresters. Their duty was to light a special beacon when alerted by the call of a Foresters horn or ''ring of shooting stars''. The beacons notified the reserve unit that a patrol required assistance. The reserve unit consisted of twenty-four Foresters and two apprentice wizards. This reserve unit headquarters was in Highgirt Hold near the Duskwood. Instead of riding horses, this unit rode [[pegasi]].
