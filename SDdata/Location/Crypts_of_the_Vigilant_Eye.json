According to the Crypt of Vigilance's in-game lore entry, the crypt was built beneath the forest so that \"the large funeral complex (doesn't weaken) the ground beneath Helm's Hold itself\". The lore entry then conflates the two names, using them both to apparently refer to the same location. For the purposes of the wiki it is assumed both names refer to the same location, which will be described as being located beneath Helm's Hold. were a secret burial place for [[Helm|the Watcher's]] faithful located beneath [[Helm's Hold]], a veritable city beneath a city.",
        "Description": "The crypts were built as a resting place for the followers of [[Helm]],\n\nWhile the halls of the crypts were decorated with statues of proud knights and its tombs were adorned with Helm's [[holy symbol]], its deeper levels featured more enigmatic imagery. Some hidden alcoves featured tall skeletal figures draped in robes, standing in stark contrast to the armored sentinels that were more commonly encountered.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The the crypts were built within natural caverns and tunnels of old civilizations that long predated the city of Helm's Hold. They were accessible by means of a lone stone tower found in the ."
        },
        "Defenses": "The only defense the crypts had against intruders were the spirits of the fallen Helmite faithful, whose remains were interred within.",
        "History": "The crypt complex served as the resting place for Helm's faithful long before the construction of Helm's Hold. They were first discovered in the {{yearlinkName|1384}}, when builders were beginning work on the [[Cathedral of Helm]] within the Hold. The [[ghost]]ly protectors of the crypts rose that same year, following the divine death of Helm himself.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[succubus]] [[Rohini]] rose to power in Helm's Hold and allowed the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] to claim the crypts for their own devices. The aberrant beings from the [[Far Realm]] dispatched horrid [[undead]] monstrosities and [[foulspawn]] began to appear throughout the maze-like tunnels of crypts. Unfortunately, the Helmite ghosts could take no direct actions against the Sovereignty's [[Symphony of Madness]], concentrated \"Spellplague energy\" that emanated from the ''[[Hex Locus]]'' and permeated the halls of the crypts.\n\nThe Helmite ghosts and the Sovereignty's servants were not the only residents of the crypts. A band of [[Uthgardt]] barbarians of the [[Gray Wolf Tribe]] infiltrated the Crypts of the Vigilant and became trapped within.\n\nSome time ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[Ashmadai]] cultists serving Rohini took over an area of the crypts for their own ends. The cult leader [[Halas|Halas the Pure]] ventured into the tombs in order to complete rituals that would summon [[devil]]s into Helm's Hold. They even managed to corrupt one of the ghosts of a Helmite paladin and turned it against their enemies. Fortunately the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] managed to stop their efforts, slay their leader Halas, and put the spirits of the fallen to rest.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that the crypts may have been originally built by cultists of [[Myrkul]] or some other ancient god of death."
