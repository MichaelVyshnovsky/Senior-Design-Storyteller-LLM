Going overland on foot, the travel times to nearby settlements and landmarks were:\n* [[Bryn Shander]] ― 7.5 hours via the Eastway. \n* [[Caer-Dineval]] ― 9 hours across a snow-covered path. \n* [[Good Mead]] ― 4.5 hours travel.\n* [[Xorvintroth]] Ruins ― approximately three days east across the snowy wastes.{{Cite adventurers league/The City That Should Not Be|6}}",

This was not always the case however. Various accords between the three settlements changed the dynamics of regional fishing industries, with each town taking it's place as leader of the three.\n\nFishing for [[knucklehead trout]] was easily the most lucrative and popular of the region's fishing industriues.\n\nDespite their rivalries, each of the three towns on the lake supported ferries that allowed for easier travel between the settlements.",

        "History": {
            "14{{th}} Century": "It was said that in a time before the [[Era of Upheaval]], cities south of the Spine got \"white gold fever\", and people came it droves to the Ten Towns to find their own fortune fishing Knucklehead trout. While other settlements of the Ten Towns grew larger and more prosperous, Easthaven's growth remained stunted for some time.\n\nIt was not until around the mid–14{{th}} century DR that Easthaven saw great commercial success come their way. After the Eastway road was paved over, a great many traders, craftspeople, traveling warriors, and others set out for new lives in Icewind Dale, and often began their journeys in Easthaven. This prolific growth drew away prospectors and others from the neighboring Ten Towns, to the point where the council at Bryn Shander had to weigh in on the matter.\n\nEasthaven was the site where the evil wizard [[Akar Kessell]] murdered his mentor [[Morkai the Red]] in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}.\n\nWhen the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]] broke out near Bryn Shander in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Glensather waded into a group of [[orc]]s and managed to kill at least two of the invaders. But as Glensather made his way to the [[barbarian]] hero [[Wulfgar]], a spear was driven into his back and the town's leader was killed.",
            "15{{th}} Century": "[[File:Burning_Wizard.png|thumb|left|300px|''Easthaven residents burning alive the [[Red Wizard]] murderer [[Dzaan]].'']]\nOn [[Marpenoth 3]] in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, pirates aboard the ''[[Howling Fiend]]'' led by [[Derrick Gaffner]] launched a raid against Easthaven. They attempted to steal weaponry from [[Rurden's Armory]]. The attack was part of a greater plot by the returned lich [[Akar Kessell]] to throw the Ten Towns into chaos. \n\nAlong with the other Ten Towns―and in fact all of Icewind Dale―Easthaven was plunged into eternal darkness in the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, when the goddess [[Auril]] cursed the lands with the [[Everlasting Rime]]. The intense cold brought on by the supernatural climate shift forced closed the Easthaven ferry, and slowed growth of numerous businesses. Industry no longer prospered in Easthaven and its prosperous growth came to an end.\n\nThe dramatic change brought out the worst of people in the Ten Towns. In Easthaven and two other settlements, locals set up a ghastly lottery that forced an innocent person to be chosen as a living sacrifice, in the vain attempt to appease the Frostmaiden and end their hardships. Even worse perhaps, those that had the power often rigged the selections to their benefit or the detriment of others. \n\nDuring the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the closed down Easthaven Ferry was taken over by a band of [[duergar]] from the fortress of [[Sunblight (fortress)|Sunblight]] in the Spine of the World Mountains. They used the abandoned locale to continue and extend their search for any deposits of [[chardalyn]] across the Ten Towns.\n\nSome time later Easthaven was attacked by a small horde of ''[[awaken]]ed'' beasts led by an exceptionally intelligent [[winter wolf]] called [[Fortararavkott]] and her [[verbeeg]] servant [[Tolvmeter]]. The beasts were turned away by a band of adventurers, who rallied aide from some of the nearby Ten Towns.{{Cite adventurers league/Terror in Ten Towns|16-18}}"
