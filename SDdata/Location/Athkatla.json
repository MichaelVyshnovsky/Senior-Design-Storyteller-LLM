        "Description": "The streets of Athkatla were well lit in the evenings, thanks to the massive, [[halfling]]-sized street oil lamps known as \"''storm-lanterns''\". They were kept aflame by patrols of six civil servants armed with double-hooked metal poles and vats of oil.",

Thieves within the city operated under written contracts more than anywhere else in Faerûn.",
            "Magic": "The practice or use of [[arcane]] magic was explicitly illegal within the city of Athkatla, a ban which dated back to a royal decree by the young King [[Dhanar Parhek]] the late 13{{th}} century DR. Spellcasting by [[wizard]]s or [[sorcerer]]s were limited to a select few who were licensed by the High Houses of Amn, or their [[magic]]al enforcement agency, the [[Cowled Wizards]], who acted as little more than mercenaries and spies for [[Selemchant|House Selemchant]].",
            "Heraldry": "The heraldry of the city was a circular shield containing a scarlet triangle on a field of rich purple. The triangle was equilateral with one angle pointing up, and it filled the shield so that all of its three points touched the edges. In the center was a white diamond, long axis horizontal. Around the edge of the shield, but just a little inward from the actual edge, were twelve golden discs distributed at an equal distance from each other, representing gold coins.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/Heraldry of Crimmor and Athkatla}}\n\nThe symbolism behind this coat of arms was as follow:\n* The purple field represented opulence and refinement\n* The red triangle represented textiles and luxury\n* The diamond represented a massive wealth\n* The gold coins represented the wealth flowing into Athkatla from everywhere else"

            "City Gates": "{{/Imagemap}}​​\nThe city had six outer gates, that, save for the Sparandar, required a toll of \"any one coin\" as a fee to pass through. Typically a ''[[fandar]]'' was given to the toll-taker but if any unrecognizable currency was used, they would demand a coin of [[silver]] or [[gold]].\n\nClockwise from the north the gates were:\n* Alandamer's Gate (B1): Led north out of the [[Wave District (Athkatla)|Wave District]].\n* Meirtyn Gate (F2): Opened eastward on the north bank of the Alandor River.\n* Heroes' Gate (F4): Also opened eastward, however on the southern bank from the [[Guards District (Athkatla)|Guards District]].\n* Sparandar Gate (E7): Led southbound out of the [[Grave District (Athkatla)|Grave District]].\n* Julkoon Gate (D6): Located a few blocks south from [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the [[Center District (Athkatla)|Center District]].\n* Oloemandur Gate (B7)\n\nThe Sea-Gates (A4) allowed for ships to enter the city's harbor from the [[Sea of Swords]] and the Chain-Gate (F3) granted access down the Alandor River.",
            "Bridge District": "The narrow, winding streets south of Athkatla's bridge (E4) was home to the city's many poor laborers, who lived lives a mere step above those within the [[River District (Athkatla)|River District]]. It was full of small, shoddy shops selling illicit goods and businesses that served the great number of caravans that entered Athkatla's walls.\n\n[[Mithrest]] (E5) was a notable inn located here.",

            "Athkatla/Guards District|Guards District": "The quarter of Athkatla catered to the city's mercenaries and adventures.

            "Athkatla/River District|River District": "Home to the slums of Athkatla, the river district was home to the city's poorest and most destitute citizens.

            "Scepter District": "The most exclusive section of the city was home to the administrative office of the Council of Five and contained the sprawling estates of the most influential Amnian aristocracy such as the [[Chainstone]] and the [[Hardsharn]] families.\n\nNotable locations:\n*[[Cloakspell tower]]\n*[[Council House]]: The seat of power for the city's ruling [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]].",

            "Wave District": "A region of the city that housed a number of seafaring business such as cartographers, shipwrights and other nautical craftspeople. Due to its proximity to the [[Temple District (Athkatla)|Temple District]] it was home to a fair number of scribes and [[sage]]s.\n\nNotable Locations:\n* Great Griffin: This massive, seven-ton (6.5 Mg) bell was used to warn ships docking in the harbor during storms\n* [[Moonhall]]: A well-recognized temple of [[Selûne]]",

            "Trade Wars": "Things got worse from [[1238 DR]] forward as every three or four decades saw a trade war erupt that would last for two or three years at a stretch. The worst one came in [[1333 DR]] when all trade in or out of Amn was stopped. A young merchant from Athkatla named [[Thayze Selemchant]] had just inherited a rich spice-importing business and the most affluent trading house in the city. He refused to allow this trade war to squash the wealth and power he would inevitably gain from his inheritance, so he personally went out and \"persuaded\" (using his intelligence, charisma, secret powers of magic and the third largest personal fortune in the country) five other Amnian merchant house leaders into forming a new government that wouldn't be so susceptible to these trade wars. The attempt succeeded and peace reigned once more (though only with a compact of mutual nonaggression with the [[Shadow Thieves]]). The new \"Council of Six\" was based in Athkatla and the city became Amn's new capital and busiest trade port on the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the churches of [[Church of Lathander|Lathander]] and [[Church of Talos|Talos]] grew enough to be locked in a series of constant conflicts for the dominance in the city. Many Athkatlans believed that the rivalry was soon to erupt in open war.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] as the last free port in Amn, Athkatla became the hub for nearly all the trade from [[Maztica]] although contact with Maztica ended when the entire continent was transported to [[Abeir]] during the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]]."
