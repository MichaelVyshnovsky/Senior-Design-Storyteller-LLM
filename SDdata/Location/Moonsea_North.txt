The Moonsea North was the name given to the region of the Moonsea, along the northern coast of the sea after which it was named, and the wild, untamed lands further north. During the early years of the Era of Upheaval, it famously became associated with the Zhents, partially coming under their control from their seat of power in Zhentil Keep.
Much of the Moonsea North was considered to be a uncivilized and uncharted wilderness, devoid of civilization but rife with natural resources ready for the seizing.
The region of the Moonsea North was difficult to define with complete accuracy. Some used the term to describe the coastal lands directly north of the Moonsea proper, while some sages such as Elminster used the term synonymously with the region of the Wide.According to page 16 of Ruins of Zhentil Keep and page 154 of Mysteries of the Moonsea, the Moonsea North was home to an ancient human kingdom whose descendants made up the barbarian population of the Ride. while some cartographers included the Tortured Land, and the lands around the Abbey Mountains north to the Great Glacier.

The Moonsea North was marked by four massive mountain ranges, the Abbey Mountains in the north, the White Peaks the western arm of the Galenas across its center, and the Dragonspine Mountains towards the south. 
While there were many far-reaching rivers  and lakes that formed in the Moonsea North, a few were particularly notable and worth mentioning. The Shattersoul River formed from the Great Glacier, joining with the west-flowing River Pelauvir. Telstang Brook and Razacks Tears flowed down from the Galena and Dragonspine peaks respectively, forming Lake Longreach in between the two mountain ranges. 
While a portion Border Forest marked the western border of the region, and the Frozen Forest well beyond to the north, the smaller Quivering Forest and Vercy Wood were entirely contained within the seldom-encountered verdant areas of the Moonsea North. 
The Twilight Marsh was situated on the northern shore of the Moonsea Lake, adjacent to the Quivering Forest.
While there was no central government in the Moonsea North, the city-state of Zhentil Keep held great power and influence over a portion of the region, and Melvaunt, that came under the influence of the returned empire of Netheril or restored city of Myth Drannor. 
The Moonsea North was known to be rich with veins of naturally-occurring metals, and was a source of wealth for the powers of Zhentil Keep. Caravans passing through the Moonsea North were often granted extra protection from the hazards they may face.
During the 14 century DR, Zhent forces famously sought to link their mercantile interests in the region with their holdings on the Sword Coast North, gaining dominance over two frontiers in with natural resources were plentiful.
Fitting to its natural landscape that attracted many explorers and pioneers, numerous shrines to Shaundakul have been built by his church throughout its lands over the course of many centuries.
The history of the Moonsea North predated the recorded history of its human residents.
For a time circa the 3 century DR, the Moonsea North experienced years of peace it was watched over by the Three Peoples of elves, dwarves, and humans.
In the late 13 century DR the explorer Tal Lancegrove famously made journeys into the Moonsea North and detailed his exploits in diaries that were later published by his daughter Tarteera.
* Melvaunt, a powerful mercantile city-state nestled on the northern coast of the Moonsea.
* Phlan, the smallest of the three coastal Realms of the Moonsea North.
* Zhentil Keep, an infamous city long-associated with the Zhentarim spanning the River Tesh, that was brought to ruin twice in its history.

Many dwarven communities built their fortified holds in the lands of the Moonsea North, often sharing their homes with their human neighbors. Other races that famously dwelled in the region included the goblinoid races, orcs, and the Ogres of Thar.
* Ragflaconshen, the red wyrm once claimed a region of the Moonsea North as its domain from its lair in the Abbey Mountains.
