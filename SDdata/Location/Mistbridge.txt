'''Mistbridge''' was the point at which the [[Long Road (Northeast Faerûn)|Long Road]] crossed the [[River Erech]]. It was the only notable crossing of this river, which served as the boundary between [[Narfell]] to the west and [[Rashemen]] to the east.

==Geography==
It was located along the River Erech north of the [[Falls of Erech]].While ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'' (p. 7) shows Mistbridge north of the Falls of Erech, ''[[Unapproachable East (sourcebook)|Unapproachable East]]'' (p. 129) shows the Long Road crossing the river south of the Falls, although Mistbridge is not labeled on this map. It is thus unclear whether Mistbridge is north or south of the Falls.

==Trade==
Mistbridge was part of the extensive trade route that passed along the Long Road, which connected Rashemen all the way to [[Damara]].

==History==
Mistbridge was the site of an event that made the [[Simbul]] infamous across [[Faerûn]]. Having learned that the [[Red Sword (mercenary company)|Red Sword]] mercenary company had been hired by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], the Simbul intercepted them at Mistbridge to try to dissuade them from attacking her land of [[Aglarond]]. When they not only refused to parlay but dared to attacked her, she flew into a rage and single-handedly annihilated all 2,000 mercenaries with her fiery spells. The story of this slaughter was the single best-known tale about the Simbul's power as of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].
