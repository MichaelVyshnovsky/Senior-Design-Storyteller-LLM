Chang-liu-shui, or Inexhaustible Spring Halt, was a small town located on the Spice Road on the Plain of Horses.
This oasis could be found between the Merket Depression and the Ni-Ko Oasis.
The actual well was found beneath a lone willow tree near a muddy pond. Water from the well was drawn from a clean underground river. The constant supply of water from the river, which allowed it to never dry out, even in the worst heats, spawned the nickname of Inexhaustible Spring Halt.
A small house, half buried in the ground, was located near the pond. Altho Farambler, a halfing from Faer√ªn, had setup a small business here by 1359 DR, often selling water to travelers.
