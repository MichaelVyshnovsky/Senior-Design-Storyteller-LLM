'''Chang-liu-shui''', or '''Inexhaustible Spring Halt''', was a small town located on the [[Spice Road]] on the [[Hordelands|Plain of Horses]].

==Description==
This oasis could be found between the [[Merket Oasis|Merket Depression]] and the [[Ni-Ko Oasis]].

The actual well was found beneath a lone willow tree near a muddy pond. Water from the well was drawn from a clean underground river. The constant supply of water from the river, which allowed it to never dry out, even in the worst heats, spawned the nickname of Inexhaustible Spring Halt.

A small house, half buried in the ground, was located near the pond. [[Altho Farambler]], a halfing from [[Faer√ªn]], had setup a small business here by [[1359 DR]], often selling water to travelers.
