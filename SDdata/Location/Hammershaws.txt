'''Hammershaws''' was a village near [[Felmorel]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
There was a log bridge crossing a creek.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, [[Elminster Aumar]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], crossed Hammershaws whilst seeking [[Dasumia]], the Lady of Shadows, at the command of [[Mystra]]. He found no one in the village, and nothing but picked bones along the main street. Some of the bones inside a house were still sitting as if they'd died in that position. The stone hedges were overgrown, some roofs were collapsed, and there was at least one [[wolf]]-like creature lairing inside one of the houses, indicating that the place had been abandoned for some time.

==Rumors & Legends==
Though Elminster assumed the killing had been done by the Lady of Shadows, he never got firm confirmation of the fact.
