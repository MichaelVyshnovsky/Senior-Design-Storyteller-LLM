        "mainbody": "Taskerleigh was a village located not far from Waterdeep.\nTaskerleigh was located north of Goldenfields in fertile hills near Gaustars Creek, a tributary of the River Dessarin. Presumably, it would have been located near Womford.There is a conflict between the text of Elfsong and the map in the novel. The text makes clear that Taskerleigh is found on or near Gaustar’s Creek, is located near fertile hills, and is north of Goldenfields. It is also found to the west of the fork in the Iron Road which leads south to Secomber and north up the Unicorn Run. For these reasons, the site marked on the novel’s map must be regarded as an error, and Taskerleigh cannot be located at the confluence of the Delimbiyr and the Unicorn Run.\nIn or just prior to the year 1364 DR, the village was attacked and destroyed by the green dragon Grimnoshtadrano. There was only a single survivor the elven bard Ingrival, who had carried the Morninglark harp. When others found him after the attack, he was quite mad and living as a hermit."
