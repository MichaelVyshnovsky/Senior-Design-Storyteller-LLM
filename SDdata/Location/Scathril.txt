'''Scathril''' was a small [[human]] realm in [[northwest Faer√ªn]], created from the destruction of the kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]] in [[697 DR]].

==Geography==
Scathril lay in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], in the former territory of Delimbiyran.

==History==
Scathril was originally a territory of the kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]]. Succeeding [[Phalorm]] in [[616 DR]], Delimbiyran overtook many of the lands formerly held by the [[dwarf|dwarven]] and [[elf|elven]] realms of [[Dardath]] and [[Ardeep]].

In the {{YearlinkName|697}}, the [[Sharran]] high priestess [[Lalondra Worul]] became a [[lich]], in the process killing her faithful [[True Servants of Shar]] who controlled an extensive network of Sharran temples across the [[Sword Coast]]. Completely uncontrolled, the leaderless faithful of her church caused mayhem and destruction across the region, and threatened numerous cities and realms. When King [[Davyd Snowsword]] of Delimbiyran deployed his soldiers in force to counter the violence, he was assassinated by a Sharran martyr. Dying without an heir, King Davyd's realm fell into civil war and broke apart into petty kingdoms, creating the independent kingdoms of Scathril, [[Calandor]], [[Harpshield]], [[Talmost (realm)|Talmost]], [[Loravatha]], [[Dauntylgar]], [[Secomber]], and more lost to history.

Shortly after in the {{YearlinkName|702}}, the [[High Forest orc]] [[Horned Horde]] invaded and destroyed several of the weakened and disunited claimants. The Duke of Calandor managed to form an alliance with his rivals, and together they threw back the invasion. Though the surviving realms remained independent of each other, their wars largely ended thanks to this instance of cooperation.

By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Scathril and most of the other realms had disappeared, though [[Daggerford]] and [[Secomber]] prospered.
