'''Sezilinta''' was a large city in [[Durpar]] in the [[Shining Lands]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Geography==
This city was located on the northern coast of the [[Golden Water]] about halfway between [[Adama's Tooth]] and the eastern edge of the [[Giant's Belt Mountains]].

==Description==
Sezilinta possessed docks, but they were much smaller than those of the other cities found on the Golden Water.

==Inhabitants==
Sezilinta was home to 17,000 inhabitants. Given the close proximity to the extensively-mined Giant's Belt Mountains, many metalworkers could be found in Sezilinta, processing mined [[iron]] and [[silver]] ore. Plenty of farm workers and weavers were kept busy with the large cotton fields found north of the city, producing [[flax]] and refining it into [[linen]].
