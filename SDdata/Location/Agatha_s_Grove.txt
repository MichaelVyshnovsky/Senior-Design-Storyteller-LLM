Agathas Grove was the lair of the banshee Agatha, the "Ghost of Neverwinter Wood".
The grove was northwest of the Conyberry area at the end of a path whose entrance was marked by a group of birch trees in the Neverwinter Wood in northwest Faer√ªn.
The banshees home was constructed out of a dome of branches with a single hole for an entrance, where individuals had to get on hands and feet to crawl through the opening. Once inside the structure, Agatha placed a mirror on the far wall to help create illusions of herself. The final room in her tree cave was the treasure room.
Agathas lair used to be guarded by a magic mirror spell, which hid her exact location for intruders and give her time to hurl spells. After the robbery of her mask, Agatha built new defenses around her home. Her spells enabled her to charm owlbears and she convinced the villagers of Conyberry to dig pitfall traps around her grove. These townsfolk had also been seen guarding her lair. In addition, Agatha wedged wands into trees throughout her haunt and aimed them toward the path to her grove.
In 1356 DR, Companions of the Hall Drizzt DoUrden and Wulfgar stole a magical mask from Agathas treasure hoard. After this event, Agatha took up looting the Dessarin area to rebuild her hoard. Around 1370 DR, Agatha added new defenses to her grove.
