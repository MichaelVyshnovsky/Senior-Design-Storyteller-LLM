'''Agatha's Grove''' was the lair of the [[banshee]] [[Agatha]], the "Ghost of Neverwinter Wood".

==Geography==
The grove was northwest of the [[Conyberry]] area at the end of a path whose entrance was marked by a group of birch trees in the [[Neverwinter Wood]] in [[northwest Faer√ªn]].

==Structure==
The [[banshee]]'s home was constructed out of a dome of branches with a single hole for an entrance, where individuals had to get on hands and feet to crawl through the opening. Once inside the structure, Agatha placed a mirror on the far wall to help create illusions of herself. The final room in her tree cave was the treasure room.

==Defenses==

Agatha's lair used to be guarded by a ''[[magic mirror]]'' spell, which hid her exact location for intruders and give her time to hurl spells. After the robbery of her [[Agatha's mask|mask]], Agatha built new defenses around her home. Her spells enabled her to charm [[owlbear]]s and she convinced the villagers of Conyberry to dig pitfall [[trap]]s around her grove. These townsfolk had also been seen guarding her lair. In addition, Agatha wedged wands into trees throughout her haunt and aimed them toward the path to her grove.

==History==

In [[1356 DR]], [[Companions of the Hall]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Wulfgar]] stole a magical [[Agatha's mask|mask]] from Agatha's treasure hoard. After this event, Agatha took up looting the [[Dessarin]] area to rebuild her hoard. Around [[1370 DR]], Agatha added new defenses to her grove.
