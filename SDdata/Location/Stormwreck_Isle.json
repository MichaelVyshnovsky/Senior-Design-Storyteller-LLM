        "mainbody": "tormwreck Isle was a small volcanic island located off the Sword Coast.\nThe island was mountainous. It was a beacon to dragons, and had become suffused with the magic of countless dragons who had died there. It was said that this had left a spiritual wound across the island that could cause unpredictable magical phenomena.\nStormwreck Isle was located in the Sea of Swords about  from the coast of Faer√ªn near the High Road. and was very close to that city. It was only about  wide.\nThe rocky island was characterized by basalt cliffs, and hot springs. Sharp rocks along the coast were the cause of many shipwrecks, especially along a particularly treacherous shoal to the northwest that was strewn with massive gold dragon bones. On the southwest side of the island was Seagrow Caves, where toxic fumes said to originate in the volcanic tomb of the red dragon Sharruth vented to the surface. \nWhite wildflowers grew on the islands northeast, while mushrooms and the occasional violet fungus grew in the caves below ground.\nThe islands shores were home to seagulls, and its caves were inhabited by stirges. Deeper underground, the energies emanating from Sharruths tomb could weaken the barrier between the Prime Material plane and the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing fire elementals like salamanders or their young to arrive beneath the island.\nThe island was formed in ancient times by volcanic activity that was caused when the mighty red dragon Sharruth was entombed on the sea floor by a group of three metallic dragons the bronze dragon Astalagan, the gold dragon Clyssavar, and the brass dragon Turadaer. Ever since, the island was a beacon to dragons, and thus hosted many battles in the never-ending struggle between metallic and chromatic dragons. This, in turn, caused the island to become suffused with the magic of the slain dragons.\nAt some time in the latter half of the 14 century DR, the blue dragon Eldenemir sought to use the Observatory to seize control over the magic of the island, but was slain by the bronze dragon Runara.&mdasha grandchild of Eldenemir, a wyrmling known as Sparkrender, arrived on the island. He moved into the ruined Observatory with the intention of performing a ritual that would awaken the spirits of Stormwrecks many dead dragons, and then use their power to turn himself into a god. When a bronze wyrmling named Aidron attempted to intervene, Sparkrender imprisoned him and planned to sacrifice his life to energize the ritual.\nCirca the , a ship called the Compass Rose wrecked on the rocks to the north of the island on Tarsakh 19. As she lay dying in the wreck, a passenger named Aletha prayed to Orcus to be reunited with her husband Brastos, and brought about a curse that caused all those who died in shipwrecks on the island&mdashbeginning with herself&mdashto rise as undead.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, there were rumblings that the long-dead Sharruth might have continued to persist in some form deep below the island.\n* The Clifftop Observatory, an ancient structure built to study the islands magic and to observe the celestial movements of the King-Killer Star.\n* Dragons Rest, a monastery dedicated to Bahamut known to be a place of wisdom and peace.\n* Seagrow Cave, a basalt cave atop the tomb of Sharruth.\nThe island was home to many kobolds. and harpies sometimes took up residence on the coast to lure ships to their doom and feast on the sailors. In the latter half of the 15 century DR, many zombies could be found along the northern coast.\n* Runara, the abbess of Dragons Rest who was widely known for her wisdom and who was a strong proponent of peace and nonviolence. She was secretly a bronze dragon.\n* Sinensa, leader of the myconids of Seagrow Caves in the late 15 century DR."
