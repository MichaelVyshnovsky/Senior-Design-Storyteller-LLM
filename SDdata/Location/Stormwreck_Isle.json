        "Description": "The island was mountainous. It was a beacon to [[dragon]]s, and had become suffused with the [[magic]] of countless dragons who had died there. It was said that this had left a spiritual wound across the island that could cause unpredictable magical phenomena.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The rocky island was characterized by basalt cliffs, and hot springs. Sharp rocks along the coast were the cause of many [[ship]]wrecks, especially along a particularly treacherous shoal to the northwest that was strewn with massive [[gold dragon]] bones. On the southwest side of the island was [[Seagrow Caves]], where toxic fumes said to originate in the volcanic tomb of the [[red dragon]] [[Sharruth]] vented to the surface.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "White wildflowers grew on the island's northeast, while [[mushroom]]s and the occasional [[violet fungus]] grew in the caves below ground.\n\nThe island's shores were home to [[seagull]]s, and its caves were inhabited by [[stirge]]s. Deeper underground, the energies emanating from Sharruth's tomb could weaken the barrier between the [[Prime Material plane]] and the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], allowing [[fire elemental]]s like [[salamander]]s or their [[fire snake|young]] to arrive beneath the island."
        },
        "History": "The island was formed in ancient times by volcanic activity that was caused when the mighty red dragon Sharruth was entombed on the sea floor by a group of three [[metallic dragon]]s: the [[bronze dragon]] [[Astalagan]], the gold dragon [[Clyssavar]], and the [[brass dragon]] [[Turadaer]]. Ever since, the island was a beacon to dragons, and thus hosted many battles in the never-ending struggle between metallic and [[chromatic dragon]]s. This, in turn, caused the island to become suffused with the magic of the slain dragons.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = This island has many old wounds.

        "Rumors & Legends": "As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, there were rumblings that the long-dead Sharruth might have continued to persist in some form deep below the island.",
