        "mainbody": "The '''''hollow of dominion''''' was a room-sized [[artifact]] that allowed an attuned wielder to unleash potent [[Psionics|psychic power]] over the southern [[Sword Coast North]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|52}}",
        "Description": "The ''hollow of dominion'' was an [[arcane]] chamber constructed by an [[archmage]] centuries prior to the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|53}}",
        "Location": "The ''hollow of dominion'' was located a half mile (1 kilometer) west of [[Wave Echo Cave]] near the town of [[Phandalin]]. It was underground beneath the ruins of an old temple,{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|49}} and sealed behind a pair of marble double doors carved with circular runes inlaid with [[silver]]. The doors were sealed with a puzzle lock, warded against [[evil]], and protected by a bladed trap. These doors remained open when no one was attuned to the ''hollow'', but could be sealed shut by its wielder.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|51}}",
        "Powers": "Whoever attuned to the ''hollow'' and controlled the ''dominion rod'' could channel psychic power exceeding that of an [[elder brain]],{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|42}} which enabled them to commune with the minds of everything within {{SI|30|miles|k|long=yes}} and to cause madness in or exert control over those minds.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|50}}",
        "Defenses": "Any unwelcome enemy of the wielder who approached the ''hollow'' itself was overcome with waves of confusion. Furthermore, the ''hollow'' could assault the minds of intruders with distressing visions of their worst memories.\n\nDestruction of the chamber's intricate magical symbols could cause the whole room to start to collapse within twelve seconds, with the entire ''hollow'' becoming utterly destroyed in less than a minute and nullifying its power permanently.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|54}}",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR sometime after the resettlement of Phandalin, a [[mindwitness]] called [[Gavmogon]] discovered the ''hollow of dominion'' with its doors open. He used it to break free of the mind control of the elder brain who had created him, and proceeded to use it first to get revenge against the elder brain and its [[mind flayer]] colony&mdash;by using the ''hollow'' to manipulate the elder brain into causing madness among its followers&mdash;and to cause madness and confusion in Phandalin and the surrounding area.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|38}} Within a few [[tenday]]s, an explorer named [[Aladair]] identified the ''hollow of dominion'' as the source of the madness, and disappeared into the ruins to investigate. Hearing of her disappearance into said lair, Lady [[Ilsa Wisemantle]] of [[Neverwinter]] convinced the [[Town Council of Phandalin]] to send [[adventurer]]s to help. At the same time, the power of the ''hollow of dominion'' had caught the attention of other [[beholder]]s in the region, who both feared its power and wanted it for themselves.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|51}}",
        "Notable Wielders": "* [[Gavmogon]], a mindwitness who sought to use the ''hollow'' to kill or control everything near Phandalin to prove his superiority. He was highly protective of the ''hollow'' and of the ''dominion rod''."
