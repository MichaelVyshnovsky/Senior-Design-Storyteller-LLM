The '''Arches of Xenosi''' were a ruined path, lined with great arches.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|145|14}} They were near the southern end of the [[Rawlinswood]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|Map}}

==Description==
The arches framed a tree-lined corridor, which had similar arches every approximately forty or fifty feet; the trees often encroached in the space between the arches, which were themselves covered in ivy and other greenery. Near the entrance, a verdant mist blocked sight further than the approximate distance between arches, also muffling sound.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|152|15}} Further along the path, visibility continued to deteriorate, and the forest intruded further into the space lined by the arches.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|160|16}}

==History==
In {{yearlink|1373}}, the [[Talontar blightlord]] [[Anammelech]] ambushed [[Marrec]]'s party at the entrance of the Arches of Xenosi.
