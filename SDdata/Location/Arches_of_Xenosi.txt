The Arches of Xenosi were a ruined path, lined with great arches. They were near the southern end of the Rawlinswood.
The arches framed a tree-lined corridor, which had similar arches every approximately forty or fifty feet the trees often encroached in the space between the arches, which were themselves covered in ivy and other greenery. Near the entrance, a verdant mist blocked sight further than the approximate distance between arches, also muffling sound. Further along the path, visibility continued to deteriorate, and the forest intruded further into the space lined by the arches.
