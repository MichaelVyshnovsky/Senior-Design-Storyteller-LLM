The '''South Center''' was a ward of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}<ref name="CoD.M>

==Activities==
The South Center was part of the [[Affluent District]]. Activity through the [[Gulf Gate]]<ref group="note">Including the Gulf Gate under the responsibility of the Affluent District may be a printing error of ''Golden Huzuz'' as the Gulf Gate is located south of the [[Clothiers' District]] on the opposite side of the city from the Affluent District., [[Pilgrim's Gate]], and the [[Gate of Wealth]] was monitored here. While other centers in Huzuz handled large caravans and merchant trains, the South Center handled more foot traffic from pilgrims and other visitors, as well as the occasional caravan.

==Inhabitants==
A [[Tasked genie|tasked]] [[administrator genie]] named [[Aasim al-Gammam]] ran the South Center. [[Miba sitt Lelia]], who ran the Gulf Gate, reported to him.
