        "Description": "Sitting where the [[Jumpa River|Jumpa]] and [[Shyok Muren]] rivers met, the city of Skarou was well fortified due to the divided nature of the nation's politics. Though the capital of the nation, Skarou was considered run-down and ramshackle for its size, due to most of its power having been taken by the nobles of the nation.\n\nInside the city was the [[Seven-Tiered Palace]], from which the royalty of Khazari ruled, the [[Monastery of the Flowing Water]], and the largest monastery of the [[Red Mountain sect]]. There was also a small monastery of the [[Yellow Mountain sect]] inside the city, resulting in some feuding between the two groups.\n\nSkarou was one of the five great cities of Khazari legend, along with [[Manass]], [[Taghla]], [[Barkhul]] and [[Alashan]].",
