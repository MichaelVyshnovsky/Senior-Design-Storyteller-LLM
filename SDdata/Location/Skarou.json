        "mainbody": "Skarou was the capital city of the nation of Khazari.\nSitting where the Jumpa and Shyok Muren rivers met, the city of Skarou was well fortified due to the divided nature of the nations politics. Though the capital of the nation, Skarou was considered run-down and ramshackle for its size, due to most of its power having been taken by the nobles of the nation.\nInside the city was the Seven-Tiered Palace, from which the royalty of Khazari ruled, the Monastery of the Flowing Water, and the largest monastery of the Red Mountain sect. There was also a small monastery of the Yellow Mountain sect inside the city, resulting in some feuding between the two groups.\nSkarou was one of the five great cities of Khazari legend, along with Manass, Taghla, Barkhul and Alashan.\nWhile shown as Skarou on maps, the city was called both Skarou and Skardu in The Horde booklet. \nCategoryCapitals\nCategoryCities\nCategoryLocations on the Shyok Muren\nCategoryLocations in Khazari\nCategoryLocations in the Hordelands\nCategoryLocations in Kara-Tur\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n41ygkxj45m6ts4i1ica3xoylkbm1u3b"
