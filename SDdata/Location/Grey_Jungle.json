        "mainbody": "The '''Grey Jungle''' was a dense rain forest found in the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] region of [[Zakhara|east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Geography": "The jungle sat approximately halfway between the cites of [[Dihliz]] and [[Mahabba]]. It rested at the southern end of [[Al-Sayaj Mountains]]. The jungle touched the coast bordering both a small portion of the [[Crowded Sea]] in the west and [[Serpent Bay]] in the south.",
        "Description": "The Grey Jungle was densely packed with vegetation thick enough to hide the ruins of [[Ysawis]] from [[Enlightenment|Enlightened]] Zakhara. Hard soil covered much of the jungle floor. The [[River Abdo]] meandered through the northern portions of the jungle.",
        "Inhabitants": "Despite the thick vegetation, the Grey Jungle was home to savage carnivorous [[jungle giant]]s who preyed upon anything they encountered, often including sentient creatures. Tribes of [[yuan-ti]] claimed the northern reaches of the jungle. Their sinister reputation was enough to keep even the dangerous jungle giants at bay.\n\nLarge snakes, called teak serpents, made their home within the dense rain forest. The snakes were large enough to feed upon prey the size of elephants.",
        "History": "The Grey Jungle was usually avoided by travelers and adventurers because of the [[Grey Fever]] known to claim those who dared to venture into its depths. Still, the promise of ancient treasure was enough to lure some brave fortune-seekers."
