'''Gladehap Rock''' was a small plateau found along the northern end of the [[Lost Lake]] in [[Gladehap]], [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
A trail of 67 stone steps lead from the Lost Lake valley to the top of the plateau about 80 ft. (24 m) into the air.

==Activites==
Though worshipers of many faiths came here to honor the gods, the plateau was also used for duels and other forms of trial by combat.

A pair of [[paladin]]s of [[Tyr]] once battled here, ranging up all of the steps until one of them was finally flung to his death far below the plateau. By the 1360s [[DR]], the bones of the slain paladin still rested within a stone catafalque where the various trails crisscrossing the valley met.
