'''Viperstongue Ford''' was a ford where the [[Cross Road]], between [[Thindilar]] and [[Blanaer]], went over the [[River Vesper]] in [[the Vast]]. It coincided with the valley of '''Viperstongue''', a low saddle in the [[Troll Mountains (the Vast)|Troll Mountains]] that served as a major pass through the range.{{Cite web/More of the Underdark and the Vast}}<ref group="note">This valley was only named in the ''Rand's Travelogue'' series, so all prior references to "Viperstongue" may be assumed to take place at the ford rather than in the valley.

==History==
Viperstongue Ford was a strategic location, making it the site of several battles. No buildings or settlements survived there very long.

When [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]] of [[Roldilar]] led the [[dwarf|dwarven]] armies against those of [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s in the [[649 DR|Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]], they were defeated at Viperstongue Ford. Roldilar's defenses were broken, and the dwarves retreated to [[Mount Grimmerfang]]. However, the Roldilarren dwarves were saved from total extinction by their [[human]] and [[elf|elven]] allies. The elven warrior [[Beluar]] and his forces routed the orcs at Viperstongue Ford, then pursued them through the hills later known as [[Beluar's Hunt]] and into the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] to slay the last orc.

==Locations==
By [[1370 DR]], [[The Stag and Viper]] inn stood at the ford. It was once the base of the [[Mistdown Marauders]], who were later buried amongst some trees north-east of the ford.
