The original walls were made of stone and were roughly nine feet (2.7 meters) at the base, tapering to about three feet (0.9 meters) at the top, with a height of twenty feet (six meters). As the city expanded, the walls were pierced with streets and they fell into disrepair.

In 1373 DR, these private armies combined consisted of over three hundred well-trained [[fighter]]s of varying experience and double that number of [[warrior]]s who had less formal training. They were originally hired to protect the satraps' horses and oxen from [[wemic]] raids out of the [[Eastern Shaar]], [[goblin]] raids out of the nearby [[Toadsquat Mountains]], and [[bandit]] attacks from all points. They each still defended their family and their interests, but banded together to defend the city when circumstances demanded it.",
        "Geography": {
            "Climate": "For most of the year, Delzimmer was hot and humid-to-damp, interspersed with occasional dry spells that turned the mud to dust.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|50-51}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 42: Doings in Delzimmer, Part 1}} The climate was very conducive to [[snake]]s, which thrived in the city and environs. The winter tended to last only two months but was characterized by stiff winds that brought heavy rainstorms barreling through town, sometimes causing flooding in the streets that could last for hours. The flooding and the snakes were good reasons why there were not many cellars or underground rooms in Delzimmer, and the ground floors of most buildings were either covered in dirt, tile, or flagstone. Most anything of value was kept on upper floors."
        },
        "Government & Politics": {
            "Law & Justice": "Sometime in the city's past there was an undeclared turf war between rival builders, rival merchants, and rival satraps that involved many fatal building collapses and bedroom fires that spread to consume entire houses. Nothing was ever proven, but the public outcry was so great that they convinced a high-ranking priest of [[Tyr]] to convene a council to forge a system of laws, enforcement, and justice (see the [[#History|History]] section below). Out of this three-day council came a code of law known as the \"kauladd\", a system of property deeding and insurance known as \"ethrael\", a provision for a police force known as the \"nagra\", and a court system with judges (known as \"kala\") for adjudicating infractions and complaints, giving restitution to the victims, and punishing the guilty."
        },
        "Society": "{{Fq|text=One can always tell an Olaundran&mdash;<br />from as far as the eye can see.|source=Delzemaer saying|float=right|width=300px}}\nThe humans of the region were largely of the [[Arkaiun]] ethnicity, speaking an [[Akalaic languages|Akalaic language]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26,28}} The people of Delzimmer were referred to as the Delzemaer or Delzmaer<ref group=\"note\">Both spellings occur multiple times in the source, perhaps indicating both 3- and 2-syllable pronunciations of the same term, respectively. and things that came from Delzimmer were called Delzemaeran or Delzmaeran.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|47-48}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 39: Delzemaeran Delicacies, Part 1}} The Delzemaer referred to all people from elsewhere as outlanders.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|43-44}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 36: The Satraps of Delzimmer, Part 1}} A person empowered to represent an individual or a group in business negotiations was called a \"meavor\".{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|53-54}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 45: Doings in Delzimmer, Part 4}}\n\nAlthough there were no true nobles in Delzimmer, many members of the four satrap families certainly acted the part. They had money and leisure time to spare and indulged their whims and desires often.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|44-46}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 37: The Satraps of Delzimmer, Part 2}} Wherever they focused their attention, trends were set and fads were born, only to wither and die when something new grabbed the spotlight. This was especially true of the [[Olaundran]] clan who were well known by most of the populace in one way or another.\n\nGaming and gambling were favorite pastimes, especially among the [[hin]] ([[halfling]]s) who at times outnumbered every other racial group in Delzimmer. Card games, dice games, and even tabletop games of strategy could be found throughout the city, with new ones being invented every season or so. Some of these games went with caravans and became known in other countries, but most were only seen here. The local hin were full of big ideas and never seemed to tire of get-rich-quick schemes. They loved taking risks with their money as long as they thought a game was fair or a scheme was not undercut by treachery.\n\nThe prosperity of the town did not reach all they way down through the ranks of society. Hungry children were often seen using [[sling]]s on the rookeries atop the old city walls, hoping to bring down a [[pigeon]] to have made into a pie.\n\nFuneral rites in Delzimmer were typically cremation on a temple-built pyre.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|56}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 47: Doings in Delzimmer, Part 6}} For a less ceremonial disposal of a corpse, there were clingvine-covered refuse pits outside the city where [[dung|nightsoil]], offal, and trash were dumped and consumed by the plants.",
        "Trade": {
            "Local Commerce": "Delzimmer was an open-trade city with few restrictions, and that kept the atmosphere lively and made shopping an adventure. Most common dwellings were above a shop that was the family business. Goods from all over Faerûn eventually came through Delzimmer and many shops sold a hodgepodge of items ranging from the newest fad to dusty old items. Even stolen goods were sold openly, after the wagons that the items \"fell off of\" were long gone.\n\nThe caravan trade created a demand for oxen, draft horses, and riding mounts, which were plentiful in Delzimmer. The stiff competition that pervaded the town kept prices for common and even uncommon goods very low. Food was also cheap and plentiful, as long as you didn't mind eating [[scaletail]] (fried [[snake]] and [[lizard]] on a stick) or handpies (also called \"[[rat]] pies\" for good reason) smothered in one or both of the local spicy brown sauces, [[mlael]] and [[sakra]]. Still within most budgets, one could dine on [[quace]] (a locally grown fruit), jugged [[fruit jelly|fruit jellies]], [[cheese]]s of various kinds, and roasted [[boar]] imported from nearby Luiren.\n\nServices in town included wagons and drovers for hire, mercenaries to protect them, or even small bands of thieves to rob or harry them. Business didn't stop when the sun went down: many establishments lit their doorways or premises with large iron lanterns to indicate they were open after darkness fell. However, the Shrimmer was only open during the day, so access to (official) bank accounts, loans, currency exchanging, and ethrael services had to wait until morning."

They each still defended their family and their interests, but banded together to defend the city when circumstances demanded it.",
        "History": "Sometime in the city's past there was a rash of catastrophic building failures, often fatal to the occupants. At first, these disasters were mostly the result of overly ambitious builders making structures too tall for the footing, or inadequately designed to withstand the heavy rains, floods, and harsh winds of winter, or both. As time went on, building standards improved and there were fewer disasters, but people began to notice who acquired the land after a collapse&mdash;invariably it was a rival satrap or builder, a personal enemy, or a debtor of the victim&mdash;and public outcry reached new heights. Some concerned citizens posted neighborhood watches (employing children with horns and lamps to watch at night and sound the alarm) and eventually caught a crew of building saboteurs who were promptly slain by an angry mob.\n\nAmid irate debate, toppling buildings became rare, but soon mysterious bedroom fires became much more frequent than normal, often with the same fatal results. When the angry citizens noticed that the pattern of destruction and death, acquisition, and rebuilding even bigger and more ornate structures was continuing unabated, they finally resolved to do something about it. A high-ranking priest of [[Tyr]] that was passing through town suddenly found himself being entreated by dozens of local merchants to convene a council and forge a system of laws and a system of property deeding that would put a stop to the violent urban land war that was plaguing the city.\n\nThe council lasted for three days and was marred by fights, injuries, and nighttime disappearances, but the priest and the public hammered out a simple code of law called the \"kauladd\", and a system of handling the ownership and exchange of real estate called \"ethrael\". To enforce the codes, they created a police force known as the \"nagra\", and a system of justice to handle disputes adjudicated by hired priests of lawful denominations, called \"kala\".\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a new sort of crime began worrying the citizens of Delzimmer: ethrael fraud. Ethrael deeds were being forged or stolen and sold to wealthy outlanders in far away places who were willing to buy a property sight unseen, based on the exacting description given in the ethrael. One victim of this fraud was [[Eloem Elchantragar]], a successful pottery importer, who was rudely awakened in the dark of night by a wealthy sculptor from [[Selgaunt]], [[Ildel Morusk]], and his fifty armed retainers, demanding the \"squatters\" vacate his property immediately. The incident was finally diffused with only minor bloodshed, but it took Eloem's neighbors rallying to his defense, some quickly hired mercenaries, and the nagra offering temporary use of one of their seized mansions at no cost to appease and pacify the irate Sembian.\n\nPrior to the [[Spellplague]], the city was located hundreds of miles inland, near the western border of the [[halfling]] realm of [[Luiren]]. Delzimmer's fortunes took a dramatic turn for the better in the {{YearlinkName|1386}}, when the Spellplague collapsed Luiren into the [[Gulf of Luiren]], making the city a port.[[Canon]] sources do not provide a specific year for the creation of the [[Gulf of Luiren]], and state only that it was created during the [[Spellplague]] ([[1385 DR]]–[[1395 DR]]). However, [[Brian R. James]] clarified in a [https://archive.ph/DVYFu Tweet] that the event occurred in [[1386 DR]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Wild rumors were spawned by the roundup of forty to sixty goblins by the mercenary company [[Rollivar's Redfangs]], hired by [[alchemist]] [[Urngath Dorrund]], in 1372 DR. The most prevalent rumor was that Dorrund believed the goblins' blood had magical properties because they drank from springs welling up through a cache of magic buried deep beneath the western Toadsquats. It was no secret that the Redfangs were directed to do their hunting around the peaks known as Klauntra's Leap, the Wyrmlar, and Liontlefang. Rumors further speculated that the store of magic could be dwarven, elven, [[Netheril|Netherese]], or even more ancient.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|54-55}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 46: Doings in Delzimmer, Part 5}}",
