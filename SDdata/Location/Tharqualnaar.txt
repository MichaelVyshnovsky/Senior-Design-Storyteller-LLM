'''Tharqualnaar''' was a village of [[merfolk]] in [[Deepwater Harbor]] in [[Waterdeep]], beneath [[Deepwater Isle]]. It was older than the city itself, founded in the year {{Yearlink|-458}}.

==Activities==
The male merfolk of this settlement were charged with the task of gathering tithes to [[Umberlee]] thrown into the harbor, and with guarding the entrance to [[Umberlee's Cache]]. By the year {{Yearlink|1372}}, the adult merfolk of the settlement were recruited into the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]], and were expected to aid in the recovery of corpses, spilled cargo, and sunken vessels.

==History==
Tharqualnaar was founded in âˆ’458 DR as a military garrison for adult male merfolk from the north to gather tithes to Umberlee.

Since {{Yearlink|-334}}, the merfolk were tasked with guarding Umberlee's Cache.

In [[1355 DR]], the population of Tharqualnaar boomed, as merfolk refugees fleeing [[Laakos' Reef]] bolstered the ranks, transforming the settlement from garrison to village.

The village was nearly destroyed in {{Yearlink|1369}} by the Army of [[Iakhovas]] in the [[Deepwater War]], but was replenished by merfolk traveling from up and down the [[Sword Coast]]. Since that time, merfolk acted as members of the City Guard.
