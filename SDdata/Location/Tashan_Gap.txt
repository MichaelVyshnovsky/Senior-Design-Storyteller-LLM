The '''Tashan Gap''' was a rather wide mountain pass found in northern [[Tashalar]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] of [[southwest Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
The Tashan Gap marked where the dense [[Black Jungles]] pushed through the lowland area between the [[Delphin Mountains]] in the east and the [[Hazur Mountains]] in the west. The gap measured nearly {{SI|80|mi|k|long=yes}} across, yet the dense jungle made any kind of passage difficult.
