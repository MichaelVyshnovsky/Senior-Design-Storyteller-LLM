        "mainbody": "orammur was the northern and bigger of the two islands that collectively were known as the Tusks, off the Firedrake Shores in Tethyr.\nThe island of Borammur rose above the waters of the Trackless Sea directly across from its smaller sister â€“ the islet of Iyritrastrul. Both islands were nestled between the Starspire Peninsula to the south, the Dragons Head Peninsula to the north, the part of the Trackless Sea called the Race to the west, and scenic Firedrake Bay to the east.\nBefore the late 14 century DR, Borammur was the site of a prosperous copper mine and a village that supported the industry. The village, mines, and their granary caves were located on the islands northern side.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the islands copper mines were lost to some dark things that came from underneath and took the lives of every miner and villager. Since the massacre, there had been at least two attempts to resettle Borammur, but they ended in similar disasters. To avoid further bloodshed, attempts to restart the mines were abandoned."
