        "History": "The fortress was originally named Emmech, and was built by King [[Brindor Olósynne]] to aid in the defence of Aglarond against invaders from [[Thesk]].\n\nIn [[1194 DR]], it launched forces to repel the invasion of the [[Red Wizards]] from [[Thay]] in the [[Battle of the Singing Sands]], in which King [[Elthond Olósynne]] was killed.\n\nBy [[1368 DR]], the number of troops in Emmech had increased to 2500, which was a large proportion of the total army. There was also a village around the fortress with five hundred inhabitants, who kept the harbor and provided services to the troops.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], the detachment of [[Aglarondan griffonrider]]s stationed in Emmech were led by Captain [[Araevil Darkeye]], and the overall command of the troops, known as the [[Army of the Lion]] was held by Lord [[Gante Demelin]]. The amount of soldiers had been reduced to 1500, but the population of the old village had swelled, with the town of 6100 ruled by Lady [[Mantelia Parsuns]]. The settlement outside the fortress had a military feel and most of its buildings were constructed of stone. The two towers facing the River Umber were equipped with a river chain that could be raised from the bottom of the river in order to block the passage of ships.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1432}}, Emmech fell under [[Thay]]an control following a major battle of Red Wizards' armies and living soldiers. The attack was swift and relentless. The first wave was composed of the undead that attacked from the [[Shyvar Pass]] as Red Wizards ''[[teleport]]ed'' angry monsters straight onto Aglarondan troops to sow chaos. Thay's living soldiers marched behind [[golem]]s, yet the attack was repealed before the troops reached the [[Tannath Mountains]], which was exactly what the Thayan strategists planned for. As the defenders were distracted, a small strike force infiltrated Emmech and turned down the fortress's defensive magics and wards, exposing it to Red Wizards' ''teleportation'' spells that brought in hundreds of less powerful Red Wizards. Battles on the streets lasted for a month, fueled by barges full of undead soldiers shipped down [[River Umber]] from [[Nethentir]] and [[Nethjet]], until all resistance quelled. Thay exterminated all civilians and Aglarondan soldiers. However, the conquest came at a price – lives of thousands of lesser Red Wizards under the zulkirate's command, several thousand living Thayan soldiers, and tens of thousands of undead. This hefty price curbed [[Szass Tam]]'s ambitions for decades, forcing him to focus on recovering his military numbers. This win also convinced Tam that undead legions were the best military force one could have. The \"lean years\" of weakened Thay caused the living Thayans to lose the last vestiges of respect for Tam as a leader, and fear was the only thing that kept them in check.{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-03-04 - Emmech}}\n\nTam appointed a personally-loyal apprentice, governor [[Undumora]], who began to transform Emmech into a formidable Thayan fortress with a sizable garrison of undead forces.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Undumor, sometimes called the Hollow City, Its population consisted of very few living inhabitants – Red Wizards and their bodyguards. Its governing body consisted of a single governor and six Red Wizard commanders. The most senior of them was a [[conjurer]] named [[Ruralekh Prator]], a master of monster summoning, including spells that called forth [[behir]]s, [[chimera]]s, and [[roper]]s."
