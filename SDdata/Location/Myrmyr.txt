Myrmyr was a small city in Var the Golden in the Shining Lands in 1367 DR.
Myrmyr was located near the western coast of the "mouth" of the Golden Water. That "mouth" was called the Sunstrait and it linked the Golden Water with the Great Sea.
This small city helped protect the Golden Water from pirates and raiders, ensuring they were able to ship large quantities of grain through the Shining South. The grain fields of Myrmyr were second only to those of Pyratar.
The nearby Ship Isle bustled with activity from ship yards owned by the Sholapur chaka.
Myrmyr hosted a population of 10,000 residents.
