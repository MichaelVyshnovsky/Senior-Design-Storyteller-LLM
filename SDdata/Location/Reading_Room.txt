The '''Reading Room''' was a fortified temple of [[Deneir]] in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] between [[Impiltur]] and [[the Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]]. It was located far to the south of the main temple of the [[Master's Library]] on [[Iron Dragon Mountain]].

==Activities==
Although every devout follower of Deneir made at least one pilgrimage to the Master's Library, most only got as far as the Reading Room, which supported the Library.

A secret nonliving matter–only ''[[gate]]'' spell allowed notes and texts to be passed between the two, so that copies of texts could be lent to visitors.

==Organization==
The Reading Room was governed by a [[Keeper]]; a kind old woman in the late 1360s DR. She sent messages through the ''gate'', and was aided and protected by loyal [[watchghost]]s.
