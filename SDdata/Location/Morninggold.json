        "mainbody": "'''Morninggold''' was the easternmost county of [[Tethyr]], located within the [[Golden Marches]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Geography": "County Morninggold was located in the western foothills of the [[Kuldin Peaks]] and was bordered in the north and west by the [[Shining Stream]] and in the south by the [[Idolflow]] and its tributary, the [[Levast River]]. Its neighboring counties were [[Valashar (county)|Valashar]], [[Hazamarch]], and [[Surkazar]]. During the time of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]], one of its many baronies was named [[Pundaria]].",
        "Government": "From [[1362 DR]], the county was ruled, until the end of the Tethyrian Interregnum, by [[Zaranda Star]]. When she became queen of all Tethyr in [[1369 DR]], power over the county passed to [[Aalangama Gulderhorn]], who was also Title Chancellor of the kingdom. However, her power over the region was not strong, and at times it seemed that the monster races of the area&mdash;[[gnoll]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[troll]]s&mdash;had more control.",
        "History": "The county, which used to belong to the [[Gulderhorn]] family, was purchased from the [[Order of the Silver Chalice]] in [[1362 DR]] by [[Zaranda Star]].{{Countess Morninggold dates}}\n\nThe order was nearly wiped out during the [[First Siege of Myratma]]. To reward them for their service to Tethyr, after her ascension as queen, Zaranda restored the lands to a surviving member of the Gulderhorns and of the order, Aalangama.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "[[Morninggold Keep]]": "This was the estate of Zaranda Star during her time as countess and afterward the county seat for Aalangama Gulderhorn.",
            "[[Mount Noblesse]]": "This manor was the headquarters of the Order of the Silver Chalice."
