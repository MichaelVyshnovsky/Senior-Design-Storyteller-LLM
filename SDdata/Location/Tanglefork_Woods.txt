The '''Tanglefork Woods''' was a small forest in the [[Grayvale]].

==Geography==
It lay at the southwestern fringe of the great [[High Forest]], between it and the [[River Delimbiyr]] and the [[Delimbiyr Road]] and just east of the [[Heartblood River]] where it joined the Delimbiyr.

==Description==
The soil here was as dark as midnight, even half a century after the Battle of Tanglefork.

==History==
The [[Battle of Tanglefork]] was fought here in the {{YearlinkName|1317}}, when the rebel leader [[Nanathlor Greysword]], the [[Green Regent]] of [[Mielikki]], led his ragtag band against the mercenaries of [[Pasuuk Rensha]], the then ruler of Loudwater. To aid her champion, Mielikki ''[[awaken]]ed'' the trees and set them to attack Pasuuk's forces, and he in turn summoned a coven of [[devil]]s. But they were defeated and the corpses of Pasuuk and his fiendish allies were scattered like filth, blackening the soil of Tanglefork Woods with their evil.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}

In the summer of the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, [[Hekkut|Hekkut the Molted]] and his [[goblin]] bandits, all working for [[the Hark]], established a hidden lair somewhere near the Tangleforks. From there, they attacked travelers passing along a lightly wooded stretch of the Delimbiyr Road just near the Tanglefork campsite and a wooded knoll. Late one afternoon in [[Eleasias]], [[Skar]], [[Gvrag]], and others caught and tortured [[Blaz Merrymar]] there, before [[adventurer]]s intervened.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/"Extermination" Plot Recap}}

==Notable Locations==
A campsite in the woods was commonly used by travelers between [[Loudwater]] and [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]].

[[File:Blueleafs and raft.jpg|thumb|right|''From the blueleaf staff down to the river, with the tunnel exit—part of the goblin base near the Tangleforks.'']]
A river cave on the banks of the Heartblood River where it passed through a winding chasm near the Tangleforks was used as a base by Hekkut the Molted and his goblin bandits. Its walls were hard-packed sand, clay, and stone, with some lashed logs to provide crude supports to this dank, dark place. [[Deathsbreath mushroom]]s grew in abundance in one cave and a family of [[lightning rat]]s made their lair outside and served as guardians. A few holes in the cliff-face let goblin crossbowmen watch over and shoot at anyone approaching via the river, which the goblins used a [[raft]] to traverse. In their storeroom, they kept their loot before transporting it back to the [[Dungeon of the Hark]]. Hekkut's own lair held a shrine to his rodent deity and and a hole leading to an [[Underdark]] passage ominously called the [[Flayers' Corridors]].

In a nearby stand of [[blueleaf]] trees, the goblins maintained a grisly carcass-filled pit—the product of both cooking large meals and conducting rites and sacrifices to [[Maglubiyet]]. As well as [[deer]] and other animals, it included a few [[human]]s, a pair of [[orc]]s, a lone [[ogre]] who had blundered into their base before being killed, the dozen goblins it slew, and several [[halfling]]s, likely the sons and nephews of Blaz Merrymar. An older such hole was the trapped secret passage into a tunnel leading toward their base.
