        "mainbody": "The Lower Trade Lanes of Skullport was the lower level of the Trade Lanes.\nHere, a wide array of goods—ranging from legal imports sourced from the Sword Coast to the most forbidden contraband—were readily available. The port’s market area was dense with stalls and open doorways, where vendors proclaimed their offerings to passersby. Among these goods were metalwork, leather items, carved bone, and various toxins, all openly displayed for customers to examine and, in some cases, sample.\nMoving through the ward were figures of varying intentions opportunistic criminals seeking unsuspecting targets, goblins bearing heavy loads for their illithid overseers, and enslaved laborers mending structures and cobblestones. Members of the Iron Ring patrolled the area in search of individuals to capture and exploit.\nFew inhabitants resided permanently in the Lower Trade Lanes. Those who did were primarily merchants and craftsmen, typically living in compact quarters above their shops. Amidst the noise of bartering and scheming, a glance skyward revealed a waterclock suspended between the Lower and Central Trade Lanes, marking the passage of time over the bustling marketplace.\n* Miskers Manse\n* Skull Square\n* Zstulkk Ssarmns residence\n* Crowing Cockatrice\n* Dizzy Drake\n* The Tradeway\n* Clockwork Wonders\n* Cryptkey Facilitations\n* Draglines\n* Hall of the Voice\n* Nooses Knots\n* Fatted Bookworm\n* Mizzen Mast\n* Sea Chest"
