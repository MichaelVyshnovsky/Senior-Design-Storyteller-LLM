'''Helgabal''', formerly known as '''Heliogabalus''', was the largest city in [[Damara]], and was once the seat of government until King Gareth moved the capital to [[Bloodstone Village]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The capital was subsequently moved back to Helgabal in the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century DR.

==Geography==
Helgabal was located in central Damara, and sat on the northwestern shores of [[Lake Mogador]] at the mouth of the [[Goliad River]]. It lay within the borders of the [[Barony of Morov]] at a central point along the [[King's Road]].

==Government==
===14th Century DR===
Baron [[Dimian Ree]] of Morov also held the title of Mayor of the city beginning in [[1357 DR]]. After [[1359 DR]], he was subordinate to King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]. Regardless of who the ruler was, real power lay in the merchants and guilds of the city, whose wealth, heavy involvement in the Damaran economy, and strong connections to foreign lands made them nearly immune to political pressure.

===15th Century DR===
Lord [[Yarin Frostmantle]] ruled both the city and the kingdom from his palace in Helgabal as a tyrannical king in the late 15th century DR.

==Trade==
Helgabal sat at or near the intersection of every major trade artery in Damara, making it a critical lynchpin in the kingdom's economy.  The city had the most readily accessible illicit markets in Damara.

==Defenses==
The merchants [[guild]]s once maintained their own private militias by way of hired mercenaries. In [[1367 DR]], by decree of the king Dragonsbane, the guilds were ordered to disperse their private armies. The defense of Helgabal was maintained by [[Order of the Golden Cup|paladins of Ilmater]] who led young recruits in protecting the city.

==History==
[[File:Heloiogabalus B&W.png|thumb|right|300px|The city of Heliogabalus.]]
Helgabal was founded as "Heliogabalus" around the {{YearlinkName|1075}}, by [[Feldrin Bloodfeathers]], First King of Damara. The [[Bloodfeathers]] had a long, unbroken line of kindly kings who ruled Damara from Helgabal until [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] seized control of the kingdom in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. Up to this point, Helgabal had enjoyed the singular status of being its own separate province of Damara belonging to the crown. However, Zhengyi's newly appointed Baron of Morov, Dimian Ree, quickly moved his seat of power from [[Morovar]] to Helgabal, and then annexed Helgabal into the Barony of Morov. Dimian Ree would struggle to control the powerful merchants who ran the city, and clashed with Baron Gareth Dragonsbane of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] two years later.

Following the defeat of Zhengyi and the crowning of Gareth Dragonsbane as the King of Damara in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the capital of Damara was moved from Helgabal to Bloodstone Village.

In the {{YearlinkName|1469}}, Bloodstone Village (by then called Bloodstone City) was razed by the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]],{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} and the capital returned to Helgabal. The last heir to the [[Dragonsbane]] dynasty had been assassinated at this point by Lord Yarin Frostmantle, who had seized the throne.{{Cite digital book/Hero/Kindle||2}}

By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the fortunes of Helgabal had begun to dwindle as southern merchants hesitated to venture into the domain of the unpredictable and despotic King Frostmantle.

==Inhabitants==
Helgabal was prone to intrigue, although not quite to the extent as many major cities further south. Most folk were independent-minded, and were loyal to no one outside their respective guilds. The people rarely objected to anything unless it interfered with day-to-day businesses. The powerful merchants who effectively ran the city only cared about money and stability, and the purpose of the stability was to ensure they made more money. A common sentiment was that regardless of what happened in Damaran politics, Helgabal was happy as long its own the status quo was maintained. Or as they said, the just wanted "Morov the same!"

The city was home to various merchant and trade guilds, as well as several thieves guilds, such as [[Tightpurse]]. There was also a population of celebrated [[dwarf|dwarven]] craftsfolk in the city.
