The '''realm of Malabog''' was a region of the [[Feywild]] that served as the personal domain of [[Malabog|King Malabog]] of the [[fomorian]] giants.

==Description==
Like the rest of the Feydark, Malabog's realm projected an eerily beautiful and dreadful atmosphere.

It was accessible from another region in the Feywild, by means of the ''[[Moonlight Gate]]'' portal.

==Geography==
The realm was divided into several smaller regions, including the High Cliffs, Barbican Ruins and the Outer Ward.

===Geographical Features===
===Flora & Fauna===
Among the spectacular flora that decorated the realm was a wide variety of plant life, particularly mushrooms and other fungi. Some specimens were exceptionally nourishing, while others were extremely toxic when consumed; yet others grew to gigantic proportions, great glowing mushrooms that were larger than most [[humanoid]]s from [[Toril]].

Due to the enslavement of other beings by Malabog and his armies, both [[dryad]]s and [[portal hound]]s could be found within the realm, though typically under duress and dire circumstance.

==History==
After Malabog began his campaign of conquest against the [[elves]] of [[New Sharandar]], ''circa'' the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the fomorian king's realm began to resemble a great war camp. Malabog's black knight [[Celadaine]] conscripted [[redcap]]s to begin construction of siege weaponry in preparation for the assault on the city. In response, the [[Iliyanbruen]] elves led by [[Merrisara Winterwhite]] launched their own counter-offensive. They established a small outpost near the High Cliffs region of the realm and struck out against the king and his allies.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Malabog's Castle]], the labyrinthine fortress of King Malabog.
* [[Tower of Celadaine]], a fallen tower that was used by Malabog's black knight, [[Celadaine]].

==Inhabitants==
The kingdom was home to Malabog's army of fey dark minions. At the head of these forces were the fomorian commanders, the powerful [[cyclops]] warriors, and the hordes of lesser creatures, namely [[troll|fell trolls]], [[quickling]]s, and [[redcap]]s.
