Aranghthal was a dragonborn settlement in Relmaur, Laerakond.
Aranghthal was one of the two "mobile" settlements the Relmorn dragonborn always maintained near the city of Rokthorl. Every time the location of Rokthorl changed, the dragonborn also moved Aranghthal to a western cavern near the capitals current location.
