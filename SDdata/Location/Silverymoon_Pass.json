        "Description": "The pass was a narrow and deep valley of jagged rocks and dark bramble bush. In the shadow of the highest peaks, heaps of snow laid all the year on the southern side. The road was often closed for threatening avalanches during the winter. Patrols from Silverymoon and Sundabar regularly walked across this road.",
