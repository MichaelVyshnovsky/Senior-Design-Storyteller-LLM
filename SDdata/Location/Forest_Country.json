        "mainbody": "The Forest Country (eventually also known as the Forest Kingdom) was a forest basin southeast of the Stormhorns in the area later known as Cormyr. Mountains lie on the north, west and east sides of the forest, with an inlet of the Inner Sea to the south. This area was part of Cormanthor to the elves and would later become the nation of Cormyr.\nOriginally, the forest was home to forest buffalo, giant owlbears, envenomed pumas and great ruqs, but these have long since been eliminated.\nThe elves orginally settled and named it Lythtlorn and although it was somewhat separated from the main forest by the Thunder Peaks, the elves considered it a part of Cormanthor. They used it as one of their hunting grounds before it was settled in the , by Ondeth Obarskyr and his immediate family. Twenty years later, the nation of Cormyr was founded and it included the Wolf Woods. After years of human habitation and clearing, the Wolf Woods was separated into three parts, the Kings Forest, the Hullack Forest, and the Hermits Wood.\nAround the , the forest was occasionally raided by tribes of goblins, and refugees from ancient Netheril sometimes made their way through.\n* Thauglor, the Black Doom"
