Sarha Isle was a small island found just off the southwest shore of Afyal in the Cities of the Ancients region in east Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The island was located just  offshore from the mainland of Afyal. It was also  due east of the Horn of Sahu, and  northeast from the mainland of Sahu.
Afyal kept soldiers stationed in a qalat on the north side of Sarha Isle, perhaps to keep a close watch on Sahu.
