        "mainbody": "Virdin was a small mining town found in Bloodstone Barony.\nVirdin sat directly west of the Bloodstone Mines in the northern region of the Valley of Bloodstone.\nThe town took its name from Virdin, the last king of Damara. Many of the stores found in Virdin supported the miners who preferred to sleep above ground at The Snoring Giant inn. Marko Orothiar, a master smith, also plied his wares in the town if the coin was right."
