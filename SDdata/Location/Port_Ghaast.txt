'''Port Ghaast''' was a large city in [[Murghôm]].

==Geography==
Situated along the western bank of the [[River Ghaast]] and the coast of [[Brightstar Lake]], Port Ghaast was a prime military location for incursions into neighboring [[Semphar]].

==Description==
Three distinct sections dominated the city. The mercenaries were quartered outside of the city walls. Regular army soldiers were quartered in guard towers that kept a close watch on the mercenaries after the [[Sell-Sword Rebellion]] that occurred during the 1330's [[DR]].

==History==
Port Ghaast was originally a small town used to ship lumber harvested from the [[Shalhoond]]. It wasn't until the king decided to invade Semphar, and chose to launch the invasion from Port Ghaast, that the city began to develop as a fortress with proper fortifications.

==Defenses==
Port Ghaast supported 4,000 troops in their regular army and kept another 3,000—5,000 mercenaries close by.

==Inhabitants==
Port Ghaast was populated by regular citizens and a fair share of mercenaries, making it a rough place to live. Most of the population practiced [[Muhjari]] law, but the mercenaries flouted these laws at every opportunity, paving the way for frequent clashes and brawls.
