While it is known to be on a river, there are several named rivers in the Kuong Kingdom, none of which are marked on a map.",
        "Trade": "A bustling port in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Kataburi saw much of the [[silk]] from [[Banda]] pass through it. Its fishermen caught [[giant crayfish]] in the river and sold them to communities up and down its length.\n\nThere was also an illicit trade in abducted women, who were kidnapped from [[T'u Lung]] in cross-border raids launched from [[Mhou]] in [[Laothan]] and trafficked by caravan south as far as Kataburi. There, these women were sold in a hidden market by the waterfront and taken to serve as consorts in the households of the immoral people who bought them.",
        "Notable Locations": "A nice temple here was dedicated to a local river spirit, who was believed to bless Kataburi with its giant crayfish. The priest of the temple was [[Devuri]], himself a [[Crab hengeyokai|crayfish hengeyokai]]."
