It was named for its location, being a \"bowshot\" from the [[Misty Forest]] when the village was founded . The woods became considerably farther away as the years of logging have taken their toll.\n\nRecently caverns have been discovered at the western edge of the hamlet. The caves maybe connected to the upper [[Underdark]] and a large vein of silver.",
