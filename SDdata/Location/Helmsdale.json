After she bore a daughter following her split with the king, the spiteful monarch ordered the child to be killed. She was saved by the intervention of Showithal Terdidy, a member of the Kneebreakers, who subsequently fled the realm to avoid the kings wrath.\nThis small farming community hosted a population of 500 inhabitants who produced food in support of the dwarves of Ironspur. The population swelled to 4,000 when Zhengyis forces occupied the town. Only 78 of the original inhabitants survived to see the Witch-Kings defeat. Most of these folk remained stubbornly determined to stay and make a living in the village.\n* Last Outpost, a tavern."
