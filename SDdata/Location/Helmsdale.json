After she bore a daughter following her split with the king, the spiteful monarch ordered the child to be killed. She was saved by the intervention of [[Showithal Terdidy]], a member of the [[Kneebreakers]], who subsequently fled the realm to avoid the king's wrath.{{Cite digital book/Hero/Kindle||13}}",
        "Inhabitants": "This small farming community hosted a population of 500 inhabitants who produced food in support of the [[dwarves]] of Ironspur. The population swelled to 4,000 when Zhengyi's forces occupied the town. Only 78 of the original inhabitants survived to see the Witch-King's defeat. Most of these folk remained stubbornly determined to stay and make a living in the village.",
