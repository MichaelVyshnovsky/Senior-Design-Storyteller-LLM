        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, the entire settlement shifted from the [[Prime Material plane]] to the [[Plane of Shadow]] by unknown magical means.\n\nFortunately for the people of Hespheira, many of them were rescued by the [[Brotherhood of Light]], led by the daring [[Dahaerlin|Dahaerlin of the Burning Brand]]. The [[paladin]] and his allies fought against the [[dracolich]] [[Umbralax]] and securing the lives of the villages at the cost of their own.\n\nThe ruins of the village returned to [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1136}}. Unfortunately it was accompanied by Umbralax itself and shadow creatures that resembled [[undead]] [[wraith]]s. The [[Knights of the Aster]] met the threat of the dracolich and its minions, in a conflict that came to be known as the Battle of Hespheira, emerging victorious thanks in part to the ''[[rod of Lathander]]''.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed that the ''[[portal]]'' between the Prime and the Plane of Shadow near the ruined village remained for some time, at least until the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
