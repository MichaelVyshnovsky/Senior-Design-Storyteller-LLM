'''Myth Drannor''', formerly known as the city of '''Cormanthor''' ({{Pronounce|kor|MANTH|or|refs=}}), the '''City of Song''',

For hundreds of years after the [[Weeping War]], Myth Drannor languished as [[fiend]]-infested ruins. After hundreds of years the city was reclaimed by the [[elves]] of [[Evermeet]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It enjoyed a century-long renaissance, before falling to ruin once more.

{{Quote|''"We shall watch guard, until Myth Drannor stands proud again!"''|Old saying in the [[Dales]]}}

==Description==
The stone towers of Myth Drannor were predominantly tall and graceful in appearance, though some of those used by wizards took the shape of fantastic creatures or forms found in nature. The "naturally-grown" structures of wood and plant life, formed by the ''[[Oacil'Quevan]]'' [[ritual of complement]], were among the most breath-taking in all the Realms. 

Cobbled streets wound through the city, running in-between the ground-level buildings of elven design and picturesque glades and city parks. Embedded within the roads were markers for the ''[[levitate|levitation pillars]]'', shafts of magical energy that could lift an individual to the skybridges and elegant treetop dwellings set within the canopy of Cormanthor.

There was an expansive set of [[Dwarven Dungeons]] that ran underneath Myth Drannor, that was inter-connected with many of the subterranean dwellings that were built by the city's non-elven residents.

;Magic
As per its name, Myth Drannor partly defined by its protective ''[[mythal]]'' that was raised under the guidance and leadership of the legendary spellcaster [[Mythanthar]]. While the ''mythal's'' made the lives of its citizens more safe and convenient during its existence, and even held secret powers known only to its creators. Following its destruction, the ''mythal'' leaked magical energy that greatly affected the ruins and the surrounding forest of Cormanthor, in regions that came to be referred to as "[[Edgelands]]". 

Magical enhancements were prevalent throughout Myth Drannor to the point of being excessive. The city's skyways were illuminated by subtle magic fields of light resembling that reflected by the [[Sel√ªne (moon)|moon]] and spellfields that functioned for its citizens' amusement. The villas of elven nobles eschewed the use of "normal" glass, preferring ''[[theurglass]]'' that could be altered by mere touch.

The excessive use of [[High magic]] and ''[[portal]]s'' in the city, combined with the actual ''mythal'' itself, weakened the "planar fabric" of the region, granting easier access to other [[planes of existence]] and [[crystal sphere]]s. Most notable among these were the [[Feywild]], the [[lower planes]], the [[demiplane of Dread]], along with the planet [[Krynn]]. Myth Drannan ''portals'' linked the city to other destinations such as the ''[[portal nexus]]'' referred to as ''[[Abarat's folly]]'', located within his [[Abarat's tower|namesake tower]] in the [[Moonsea]], the ''[[warrior's gate]]'' connected to the kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]], and most importantly, the ''[[Gate Halls]]'' nexus that link the castles of the all the great elven kingdoms. The ''[[Silversgate]]'' connected Myth Drannor to [[Eaerlann]], while the ''[[Honorsgate]]'' led to the [[Forest of Mir]] in [[Tethyr]].

;Technology:

The dwarves of the [[House of Gems]] established a complex network of underground pumps, called ''Lifespring Wells'', that provided its citizens with a reliable source of fresh water, and many of the city's beautiful fountains guarded by [[naiad]]s. Among other wonders of technology created by the city's dwarves was the sophisticated air vent systems that ran through all the levels of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] and the House of Gems itself, called the ''Channels of the Earthborn Wind''; the many winding walkways around the [[Castle Cormanthor]] and [[Windrider Glade]]; as well as the ingenious ''"liquid fire"'', used to illuminate the Dwarven Dungeons and [[Elven Catacombs]] and other  city districts.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041030235221/http://pool-of-radiance.com/story/chars.htm#| title = Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor official webpage (archived) | accessdate = 18-10-2020| date = 18-10-2020}}

==Climate==
Due to the magic of its ''mythal'', Myth Drannor enjoyed exceptionally pleasant weather. It remained free from extreme heat or cold, and was immune to natural disasters such as storms and forest fires.

==Geography==
Myth Drannor was one of four old communities of [[Cormanthyr]], alongside the [[Elven Court]], [[Semberholme]], and the [[Tangled Trees]].

Myth Drannor was constructed around two tributaries that came together to form [[Oacenth's Stream]], which flowed south through [[Tilver's Dam]] to [[Glyryrryl's pool]] in the southern end of the city. and the [[Shrine of Mystra]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], two notable landmarks stood in stark contrast to the restored City of Song: the mold-covered fortress known as the [[Citadel of Fungi]], and the [[Shadowfell]]-corrupted [[Demon Estate]] of the [[Fey'ri]].

===Geographical Features ===
Myth Drannor was built in such a way that its layout resembled the head of a [[battleaxe]], with the blade pointed to the west.

The two approximate halves were linked by the large curved bridges that spanned the streams that ran through the city in a north-south direction.

==Government==
{{fq
| text   = ''As I would think, so shall ye;<br />As I would feel, so shall ye;<br />As I would do, so shall ye;<br />As I would not harm, nor shall ye;<br />As I would, so shall the clan;<br />As the clan would, so shall I;<br />As we would, so shall ye.<br />The People are as one, and<br />never shall I stray from this, nor shall ye,<br />for to digress is to diminish you and your People.''
| source = Code of the People
| float  = right
| width  = 
}}
Throughout most of its history, Myth Drannor and all of Cormanthyr was ruled by a single coronal. They were aided in their duties by the [[arms-major]] and [[spell-major]], the empire's greatest warrior and mage respectively,

The authority of these leaders was each embodied in one of the three [[Elfblade]]s, the ''[[Rulers' Blade]]'', the ''[[Warblade]]'', and the ''[[Artblade]]''.

Composed of the heads of Myth Drannor's elven noble houses, the ''Nobles' Council'' met regularly to discuss any issues or laws that concerned them. They met with the coronal at least once a year to offer their voice and advice to the coronal's rule.

For a scant 50 years Myth Drannor was governed by the [[Council of Twelve]], though it was little more than a collection of squabbling, entitled bureaucrats who acted only in self-interest.

===Laws===
The laws of Myth Drannor followed the "Code of the People", simple and elegant ideal that a crime against one of its citizens was a crime against all. While the full scope of the code was over 100 stanzas long, the final words eloquently described the heart of its intent:

The code was enforced either by the Coronal or an elf from one of the city's noble houses. The punishment varied on a case-by-case basis.

==Defenses==
Beyond its namesake ''mythal'', Myth Drannor owed its defense to the great Cormanthyrian army of [[Akh'Velahr]] along with its many great and powerful mages of the [[Akh'Faer]]. 

Service in the military was a life-long dedication, symbolized by the permanent [[tattoo]]s inscribed upon a soldier or mage's hands and forearms.

Throughout its history, Myth Drannor enjoyed bolstered protection from the [[War Wizards]] of Cormyr along with contingents of the kingdom's [[Purple Dragons]].

==Relations==
Myth Drannans enjoyed robust trade with the residents of the land that came to be known as [[Sembia]], along with a strong friendship the folks of the [[Dalelands]]. While elves from the city of Cormanthor first granted permission for men to settle the Dales, it was the Dalesfolk who came to the city's aid during its hour of need in the 8{{th}} century DR.

Within the city, guilds were formed with the goal of sharing information and knowledge between the various races of its citizenry.

When the city was reformed some 700 years later, Myth Drannor renewed its bonds of camaraderie with the free folk of the Dales, along with those in the neighboring kingdom of [[Cormyr]].

==Society==
While Myth Drannor was the exemplification of tolerance between the races, there were some cultural traditions that separated the Tel'Quessir from non-elven citizens. For example, many elves only spoke to others of their own kind unless they were specifically addressed, the exception being [[moon elves]] and their outgoing nature. Noble-born elves were always granted right-of-way, even in the case of personal flight, and were never to be look at in the eyes, unless they did so first.[[File:Myth Drannor (book cover).jpg|thumb|''The city of Myth Drannor peering from the mists of Cormanthor.'']]

One of the festivals of note that were celebrated in Myth Drannor was the [[Midsummer Firemeet]], legendary for the lavish celebrations and  exquisite [[silk]]en banners and decorations draped across Windrider Glade.

==History==
{{main|History of Myth Drannor}}

Myth Drannor was founded as Cormanthor in the {{YearlinkName|-3983}} by the Coronal [[Kahvoerm Irithyl]]. For over four thousand years, the city prospered with little incident.

===Glory of Myth Drannor===
Coronal [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] decided that if Cormanthyr was to survive, its people must make peace with the other races, so Eltargrim set about organizing the elf [[wizard]]s to create a [[mythal]].

The Opening marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Myth Drannor, when the city prospered and many races flourished amid its towers. Many demihuman groups came to the city during this time, including [[dwarves]], [[gnomes]], and [[halflings]]. Myth Drannor reached a peak of influence and culture in the {{YearlinkName|661}}, and all the races living within flourished under a sense of unity.

Following the death of Eltargrim in the {{YearlinkName|661}}, the city was left without a leader. By Midsummer in the {{YearlinkName|667}}, the [[Council of Twelve]] was in control of Cormanthyr and Myth Drannor. This council soon forgot the dreams of the Coronals, focusing on actions that favored their own families and influence. With Myth Drannor failing as a capital, the next 40 years saw Cormanthyr dissolve into city-states rife with divisive in-fighting that poisoned the city's council and the guilds.

===Fall===
{{main|Weeping War}}

In the {{YearlinkName|711}}, the [[Trio Nefarious]] entered the northern woods, attacking some eladrin outposts and moving closer to the capital, and starting the [[Weeping War]]. The elves of the city were aided in its defense by the men of the [[Dalelands]] and some [[Cormyr]]ean [[War Wizards]].

Myth Drannor's former residents scattered across the Realms. Some elves found new homes in the land of [[Tethyr]] by the grace of [[Strohm II]].

The fall of Myth Drannor began an event that came to be known as the [[Retreat]] ‚Äì the great migration of elves from the continent of Faer√ªn to the isle of [[Evermeet]]. Among those that were known to have returned to the Green Isle were the elven houses of [[Durothil]], [[Silverspear]], [[Symbaern]], [[House Nightstar|Nightstar]], and [[House Nierdre|Nierdre]].

===Interim years ===
[[File:Ruins of Myth Drannor - Jason A. Engle.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''An [[osyluth]] and a [[hamatula]] in the ruins of Myth Drannor.'']]
For over six centuries, the elves kept the place hidden and sealed for the most part, refusing to let any into the ruins save [[dragons]], whom the elves hoped would guard the city against interlopers as they would their own lairs{{Cite dragon/359/Volo's Guide: Myth Drannor, City of Song|102}} The city became a legend, one of the most dangerous adventuring sites in all of Faer√ªn.

During the 13{{th}} century DR, the deity [[Lathander]] appeared before a group of his clergy that came to be known as the [[Seekers of the Dawn]]. He tasked them with the formation of a Lathanderite temple within the ruins of Myth Drannor and bestowed upon them the ''[[Dawnstone]]'' to aid them in their endeavor.

In the same year that the elves' Retreat reached its apex,

A mere two years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, the alhoons had manipulated the [[church of Bane]] into opening a ''[[portal]]'' to [[Avernus]] within the ruins in an effort to set ther devils upon their [[phaerimm]] enemies.{{Cite dragon/359/Volo's Guide: Myth Drannor, City of Song|103}} The [[Banite]]s quickly erected magical [[ward]]s to contain the fields, hoping that [[adventurer]]s would slay some of their number.

===The Seizing ===
[[File:Castle cormanthor.png|thumb|713x713px|[[Castle Cormanthor|''Castle Cormanthor'']]'' during the Cult of the Dragon occupation.'']]
Over the next ten years, the followers of [[Bane]] spread rumors about the great riches that could be obtained from within Myth Drannor. in search of wealth and glory. Notable among these groups were the [[Company of the Catlash]], and the [[Masked Marauders]]. Other groups were more benevolent in their motivations. The [[Knights of the Shadow Sword]] made regular patrols in the city, seeking to rid it of its [[evil]] denizens, while the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] relocated there in the years prior to their retirement.

In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, an [[avatar]] of [[Moander]] marched on Myth Drannor from [[Y√ªlash]]; while it was prevented from reaching its destination, the destruction it caused formed a path in the forest called [[Moander's Road]].

A few months later in [[Marpenoth]], the entity known as [[Tyranthraxus]] briefly took over the city by means of a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' and established itself within the [[Temple of Labelas Enoreth (Myth Drannor)|temple of Labelas Enoreth]]. With the assistance of a disguised [[Elminster]], a group of adventurers found passage through Myth Drannor's barriers and drove the possessing spirit out of the ruined city. 

The following month in [[Uktar]], the Knights of Myth Drannor managed to close the ''portal'' established by the followers of Bane a decade before. Unfortunately, scores of devils remained within the ruins.

Twelve years after that, in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, They had discovered a newly formed ''pool of radiance'' inside [[Castle Cormanthor]] and wished to bathe the [[dracolich]] [[Pelendralaar]] in its waters to grant him more power. Once again, the malevolent plans of those seeking to exploit Myth Drannor were foiled by adventurers of the Realms.

===Reclamation and Reconstruction===
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the return of the [[Netherese]] to Faer√ªn led to the expedient destruction of the phaerimm that dwelled within the city's ruins. The returned [[arcanist]]s erected a ''[[shadowshell]]'' that prevented their escape and nearly eradicated the [[aberration]]s from within the ruins.

Two years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the forces of the [[daemonfey]] managed a feat that so many others could not ‚Äì they conquered the ruined city by force. In turn, [[Seiveril Miritar]] and the [[Elven Crusade]] returned to Faer√ªn from Evermeet to reclaim Myth Drannor for the Tel'Quessir from the fiendish plague. Seiveril's daughter [[Ilsevele Miritar|Ilsevele]] became the new coronal and efforts to restore the city began. The elves of the region began to clear the ruins of Myth Drannor, in order to build the city anew.{{Cite dragon/359/Volo's Guide: Myth Drannor, City of Song|105}}

By the [[1375 DR|following year]], Myth Drannor became a flourishing city-state that garnered influence over several Moonsea and Dalelands settlements.

After over a century of tension and conflict, war broke out in the [[Eastern Heartlands]]. The [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Thultanthar]] took to the air directly over Myth Drannor as the Netherese shades sought to take control over its ''mythal''. During the struggle, Thultanthar crashed down upon Myth Drannor, leveling both of the cities upon impact. Coronal Ilsevele managed to survive the catastrophe, and her subjects fled to the formerly abandoned settlement of [[Semberholme]].

===Legacy===
[[File:Myth Drannor's mythal.jpg|thumb|''Myth Drannor's mythal, cleansed by [[Anorrweyn Evensong]]'s spirit.''|260x260px]]
At its height, Myth Drannor represented the peak of elven civilization and craftsmanship. It served as a beacon for the free folks of Faer√ªn, particularly the elves, dwarves, and humans, demonstrating they could peacefully live alongside one another. 

Throughout the years it lay in ruin, leaders from several city-states sought recapture its splendor and beauty. Cities such as [[Ascalhorn]] and [[Silverymoon]] were seen by some as resonances of the City of Song. Some even referred to Silverymoon as "Myth Drannor of the North".

Relics that survived the destruction of Myth Drannor were highly prized throughout the Realms. The [[Old Dragon Down]] in [[Archenbridge]] earned some renown for selling these types of items, while a single bottle of wine recovered from the city was considered priceless by the proprietor of [[Thaola's Wineshop]] in [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of [[Evermeet]]. Some relics known to have survived the city's fall included a number of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[harp]]s,{{Cite dragon/115/Airs of Ages Past|46}} the ''[[the Black Book|Black Book]]'' of [[Beshaba]], Gaulguth's [[battleaxe]] ''[[Heartcleaver]]'', [[Arbane]]'s ''[[Arbane's Sword of Agility|swords of agility]]'', and the legendary ''[[baneblades of Demron]]'' forged to commemorate the unity forged among the city's residents, among others.  

Countless other types of [[magic item]]s traced their origins back to the city, including the ''[[gauntlets of the valorous]]'', ''[[dagger of defiance|daggers of defiance]]'', and of course the legendary ''[[moonblade]]s''.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Myth Drannor was one of the possible locations in the Realms where the ''[[well of spells]]'' could appear.

Seeing as how many great [[magical item]]s traced their history back to Myth Drannor, many rumors surrounding misplaced or long-lost relics pointed in the direction of the fabled city. As of the mid‚Äì14{{th}} century DR it was rumored at the ''[[Wyvern Crown of Cormyr]]'' rest somewhere within its ruins. 

==Notable locations==
The city comprised four distinct districts, and a vast underground network referred to as the Dwarven Dungeons.

===City of Song===
[[File:Speculum Wallpaper.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The entrance to the Speculum in Sheshyrinnam.'']]
[[Myth Drannor/Cormanthor|Cormanthor]], also known as the "Old City", was the oldest ward that housed the city's austere civil buildings and estates of the noble elven houses. Notable sites included:
* [[Castle Cormanthor]], the once-majestic citadel around which the city was built, beginning with the ''Rule Tower'' that rose from the ground when the ''[[Rulers' Blade]]'' was pulled from the ground of Cormanthor.
* [[House of Song (Myth Drannor)|House of Song]], the fortress-temple dedicated to the deity [[Oghma]].
* [[Onaglym]], the House of Gems that was appropriated by the city's dwarves and the city's [[Gemcutters' and Jewellers' guild|jewelers' guild]].
* Ursplindaar, the great fortified library.
* [[Glim-Gardens]] of the [[House Ammath]], the enchanted gardens that healed the travelers' bodies and spirits, and the exuberant Ammath family mansion.
* [[Jerrok's Concert Hall]], once grand hall, enchanted for the perfect acoustics. The hall was turned into a cursed and dangerous ruin by a mis-fired spell during the last days of the Weeping War.

[[Sheshyrinnam]], or the "Temple Ward", was nearly as old as Cormanthor, housing many elven citizens and the temples of the [[Seldarine]].
* [[Nightingale Court]], the plaza that housed the [[Temple of Mystra]] and the enchanted monument called the  ''Ear of Myth Drannor''.
* [[Shaundakul's Throne]], the holy house dedicated to the [[Rider of the Winds]] was considered to be the greatest of his faith in all the Realms.
* [[Windrider Glade]] was the park dedicated to the ideal of peace and diversity of religion, that housed an open-air Temple of Shaundakul and multiple other shrines.
* [[Speculum|The Speculum]], the guildhall of the city's [[Guild of Wizards, Conjurers, & Enchanters|wizards' guild]] and a repository of arcane knowledge, that was founded by [[Alaghar|Alaghar of the Horns]].
** The [[Speculum Grounds]] surrounding the guildhall had numerous sites such as the ''[[Orrery]]'' that allowed ''[[teleport]]ation'' throughout the city.
* [[Windsong Tower]], the three-spired school of [[sorcery]] that housed one set of the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' in the form of the [[Quess'Ar'Teranthvar]].
* [[Temple of Sehanine Moonbow]], an open air temple to the [[Sehanine Moonbow|Goddess of Moonlight]].

[[Kerradunath]], also known as the "Lake Ward", was home to the many businesses and guildhalls built around the tranquil [[Glyrryl's pool]].
* [[Hall of the Open Book]], guildhall for the [[Lorekeepers' Alliance]].
* [[Irithlium|The Irithlium]], the legendary arcane academy that was constructed over a span of 300 years.

[[Dlabraddath]], the "Alliance Ward", was constructed after the Opening in order to accommodate the non-elven residents that made their home in Myth Drannor.
* [[Halls of the Beast-Tamers]], the subterranean hall of the [[Guild of Naturalists (Myth Drannor)|Guild of Naturalists]] located on the east side of the city.
* [[Incanistaeum|The Incanistaeum]], the magical school that was overseen by the [[Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor]].
* [[Lovers' Glade]], a step-encircled pool that served as an open temple to the goddess [[Sune]].

Landmarks outside the districts of Myth Drannor included the [[Polyandrium]], the north-most graveyard that contained numerous mausoleums and the [[Tower of Bones]], and the [[Dwarven Dungeons]], an underground complex that housed much of the city's dwarven population.

===Ruins===
In the centuries following the city's destruction, various areas were left nearly unrecognizable from their previous state. The [[Sullymarsh]] swamp grew out of the beautiful public park and estate grounds of the [[Omberdawn]] noble family,

Landmarks that could be found within the ruins of Myth Drannor included the [[Fog Tree]], an especially deadly cluster or tangled trees formed by the residual magic in the city. and the [[Well of the Fallen]], the site at which [[Sambranna Highstar]] wrote the introduction to her treatise on the holy books of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]]. In the years after the city's fall some new structures were still being erected as well, such as [[Dawnspire]], the Lathanderite that was built by the Seekers of the Dawn.

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Myth Drannor resettlement.jpg|thumb|''Resettlement of Myth Drannor.'']]
During the height of its splendor, Myth Drannor was home to some of the most famous and knowledgeable of the Realms' residents. The [[Seven Wizards]] who taught at the city's school of magic had a lasting legacy that influenced practitioners of [[the Art]] for centuries to follow.

The city attracted artists, scholars craftspeople from all across the Realms. A person was just as likely to find a learned [[sage]] or world-traveled [[bard]] as they were to encounter an [[artificer]] of fantastic [[magic item]]s.

;In the Ruins:

Following its destruction in the 8{{th}} century DR, Myth Drannor became overrun by many monstrous, aberrant, and horrific creatures. Entities known as [[wizshade]]s haunted the city's once-majestic wizard-towers, Interestingly enough, the city's ruins was the location for the first sightings of the rarely-seen [[fang dragon]]s.

Also in the ruins were undead horrors rarely encountered by mortals ‚Äì magic-wielding [[illithid]]s known as alhoons, [[burnbones]], and an army bone nagas. Not all the undead in ruined Myth Drannor were malevolent however, as the [[baelnorn]] remained as vigilant sentries watching over the tombs of their deceased kin.

The more [[aberrant]] denizens included the horrific phaerimm that escaped from beneath [[Anauroch]], and a single [[deepspawn]] that took control of the ruined Speculum.

Through the centuries of ruin devils and other fiends run rampant through Myth Drannor. One contingent of baatezu once fell under the command of the fallen [[solar]] Malkizid, while another was led by the [[pit fiend]] [[Aglaeroch]].
