        "mainbody": "'''Easting''' was a small town in the [[Western Heartlands]], lying east of [[Iriaebor]], whence it got its name. It was a fairly typical town of the region.",
        "Description": "A small town, it comprised less than 40 buildings in the mid-1360s DR.",
        "Trade": "In the 1360s DR, it was home to four or more well-known [[horse]] breeders, who had competitive prices and were kept busy supplying fresh mounts to travelers going between the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n\nThanks to its small size and nearness to the mountains, Easting became a meeting place for [[dwarf]] craftsmen and merchants from hidden delves in the [[Far Hills]] and [[Sunset Mountains]]. They sold their high-quality smith-work here,",
        "Population": "The small town had a large non-[[human]] population, namely of dwarves.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1296}}, an adventuring party discovered a hidden temple to [[Malar]] in Easting and tried to take the ''[[Book of Fangs and Talons]]'', a [[Malarite]] holy book. But they were discovered by the priest and quickly overcome by \"a great horde incorporating of all manner of beasts\", as survivors described it. The would-be thief was dragged away and eaten and the book retaken. Those who escaped returned the next day with mercenaries looking for vengeance, but found the temple abandoned.<ref>\n\nLocal sage Rulthaven sighted a [[star-spore]] fall from the sky in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, and land near [[Darkhold]], several days' ride from Easting, and quickly went to examine it. However, it was discovered by a band of [[adventurer]]s known as the [[Seekers]], who were stricken by the alien spores. Aided by Rulthaven's treatments, the adventurers recovered in Easting over a period of several days, during which the sage visited the crater and eagerly collected samples of the star-spore for his research.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, the Bruenghor Clan of the Sunset Mountains tried to light a signal fire on Mount [[Burning Eye]], as their mines had been invaded by [[drow]]. They had hoped to alert their brothers in Easting to rush to their aid. Unfortunately, their march to the peak of Burning Eye was cut off by [[Ciraxis]] and a group of [[ogre]]s.",
        "Notable Locations": "Temple of [[Chauntea]]: Located on the central square of the village, the temple dedicated to the Earthmother was a large stone building covered in [[grape]] vines, [[rose]]s, and old [[plaster]]. The building was open, with a simple altar standing in its center and a [[statue]] of the Goddess surrounded by lambs standing at the front doors.\n\nSouth of Easting, near the caravan road, there was a knoll standing between two marshes, which became shallow ponds in the wet season. Scrub trees and [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwoods]] covered the knoll, but on the northern side, in a small hollow between some duskwoods, was a {{SIAdj|40|ft|long=yes|adj=wide}} dome that was a refuge created by [[Maldiglas Turntower]], a [[Magister]] of the early 1300s DR.<ref>",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Rulthaven]], a famous sage known to be an expert botanist knowledgeable in [[herb]]s and [[poison]]s. Both good priests and agents of [[Darkhold]] came to consult with him. Hence, there was a potential for a [[Zhentarim]] influence in town.<ref>\n* Vanguard [[Shellidar]], a crusader of [[Torm]] and Speaker of the [[Janessar]] in [[Calimshan]].<ref>"
