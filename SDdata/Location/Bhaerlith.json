        "mainbody": "Bhaerlith was the name of a secret, manufactured oasis located in the Anauroch desert.\nThe oasis was rich with a variety of fruiting trees including palms. Within the camp was a single underground stone structure used by the Zhentilar soldiers.\nBhaerlith was located in the northern region of the Sword, just north of Elahzad in the Hills of Scent. \nLike other Zhent oases, Bhaerlith was protected by a ring of spring-sword traps that would harm any would bring great harm to any would-be trespassers or wandering wildlife. The remains of local Bedine tribespeople that did make it into the camp were displayed on wooden posts outside the perimeter as a warning.\nDuring the mid-14 century DR it served as an outpost for the Zhentilar army. It was used as a major way point for Zhent caravans crossing the desert to trade goods to and from Zhentil Keep.\nRumors stated that the oasis was haunted by a single guardian daemon.\nThe camp supported its contingent of Zhentilar soldiers, who were in turn given support by a cadre of Zhentarim spellcasters."
