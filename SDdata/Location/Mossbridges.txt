'''Mossbridges''' was a town in [[the Vast]], lying where the [[Coast Road]] between [[Ravens Bluff]] and [[Tantras]] crossed the [[Fire River]], over the bridge of the same name. [[Feldar's Trail]] began at Mossbridges and joined to [[Highbank Forest]].

==Description==
The village of Mossbridges was divided into two areas known as New Town and Old Town. These were distinct from each other in terms of their inhabitants and the age of their architecture. New Town in particular hosted a variety of shops. Bordering Old Town was a pair of old, but sturdy bridges, which were said to be the namesake of the village.

The village's main landmark{{Cite organized play/LC/Fire's Eye|4}} but the [[engineer]]s and stonemasons who worked on it simply called it "the Bridge".

==Geography==
The village was located roughly {{SI|8|miles}} northeast of the city of Ravens Bluff.{{Cite web/A Primer on Vastian Geography}}

==Government==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Mossbridges was home to Lord [[Thalmir]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|29-30}} one of the wealthiest petty lords in the area.

==Law & order==
Around 1370 DR, Mossbridges was policed by [[Rulisqer of Tyr]], a [[paladin]] of the god of justice [[Tyr]], together with his fourteen followers. They believed that public safety and lawful behavior would bring happiness and prosperity to all. Through diligent, expert policing, they broke up brawls in the streets and kept out [[thieves' guild]]s. Those who drew a weapon would soon find themselves subdued, disarmed, and marched out of town. The Tyrrans seemed to always know when and where there was going to be trouble. Thanks to their efforts, Mossbridges saw very little crime.

==Economy==
Mossbridges in the 14th century largely served Ravens Bluff as a warehouse district, a staging area for caravans, and a center for [[horse]] trading and stabling, as well as through its stockyards. Consequently, a great deal of wealth passed through Mossbridges, but this was kept safe by the efforts of the Tyrrans.

The good security led to Mossbridges being utilized as a neutral, "no swords" meeting ground for those who would otherwise come into conflict, such as traditional foes who needed to trade or negotiate. Some merchants who preferred not to stay in Ravens Bluff—a few of who had made enemies there—based themselves in nearby Mossbridges instead. They arranged for clients and creditors to meet them in the town.

Both the Tyrran security and the neutral ground encouraged investment and even banking in Mossbridges. A fledgling but prosperous banking industry had sprung up by 1370 DR.

The civic authorities of both Ravens Bluff and Tantras paid a corps of engineers and stonemasons based in Mossbridges to maintain the bridge over the Fire River, which they simply called "the Bridge". They could never be persuaded to risk or sabotage the bridge, but were corrupt in other areas. For a hefty bribe, they would conceal bodies, treasure, and telltale items in the bridge pilings, where they might remain for a good long time. Both the corps and the stashing operation were led by the foreman, [[Klonalogh Umesker]], in 1370 DR.

==History==
The bridge over the Fire River was built during the kingdom of [[Roldilar]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] surface realm founded in the {{YearlinkName|610}}. The bridge lay a few miles upstream of the secure trading center of [[Sarbreen]] at the mouth of the river. Although Roldilar and Sarbeen fell to [[orc]]s in the {{YearlinkName|649}}, the bridge survived.

As [[human]]s began to settle the coastline of the Vast, Sarbreen remained dangerous but the river remained useful. So local farmers and merchants gathered instead at the Fire River Bridge, as they called it, where they traded their goods and coin. A settlement grew, and bridge and community came to be known as Mossbridges. Sarbreen was eventually resettled, becoming the city of Ravens Bluff in the {{YearlinkName|1222}}.

Late in the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, a rash of [[cow]] killings occurred in Mossbridges. The superstitious villagers all suspected [[Alice Clarkson]], a retired [[adventurer]] and mage who was living in the village, of being responsible and believed she was a [[witch]] intent on using their cows in evil experiments. On [[Eleint 13]], the villagers stormed her home as an angry mob, pulled her out, and had her burned at the stake. When another cow disappeared later that night the villagers organized a posse to patrol the surrounding farms over the coming nights, until eventually a figure was spotted carrying away a slain cow.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|8-9}} Tracking the figure down to a nearby cave, the true culprits were revealed to be two [[troll]]s led by a [[gnoll]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|29}} [[Archer]]s kept the three [[humanoid]]s pinned down inside the cave whilst the rest of the villagers pelted it with [[Greek fire]], eventually killing them. Afterwards the people of Mossbridges, feeling tremendous guilt and shame over what they had done to Alice, erected a tombstone for her in their cemetery and vowed never to speak of what happened to her ever again.

The part of the village that would become known as New Town would have most of its buildings constructed during the 1350's [[DR]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|20}} as would the Fire River Bridge.

In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Ravens Bluff was working to establish a regional government in the Vast by taking a number of neighboring towns and villages under its control. Mossbridges and the newly settled [[New Hope]] were the two communities to be incorporated into the city-state. After suffering eight sudden attacks within three months, the people of Mossbridges pleaded with Ravens Bluff for protection. The town had barely enough time to rebuild between humanoid and mercenary attacks and was desperate for protection. Thankfully, Ravens Bluff and Mossbridges had longstanding friendly relations. Acting Mayor [[Belanor Fenmarel]] of the Bluff responded swiftly and pledged a force to Mossbridges' defense in exchange for a tariff reduction agreement for Ravenaar goods entering and exiting Mossbridges. The Acting Mayor assigned a group of mages to magically transport goods, supplies, and food in town's aid.{{Cite polyhedron/121/The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter|31}}

Following the [[War with Myrkyssa Jelan]], the newly-elected mayor [[Amber Lynn Thoden]] presented [[Lorien Keltree Darkarrow]] with the title of Baron of Mossbridges, along with a title to the lands and estates of Fort Thoden.

* [[Darkarrow Keep]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Luck, Law, and Life|8}}<ref group="note" name="estate">While Darkarrow Keep is not directly stated to be Fort Thoden, their shared proximity to Mossbridges and ownership by Lorien Darkarrow suggest they are likely meant to be the same estate. formerly known as Fort Thoden, was a large fortified estate outside of town{{Cite trumpeter/2-6}} that was gifted to Lorien Darkarrow by Amber Lynn Thoden following the War with Myrkyssa Jelan.
* [[General Store (Mossbridges)|General Store]], a shop that traded in common goods and most basic weapons and armor.

* The New Town section of Mossbridges was host to a cart maker, a bakery, a general store, and a stable.

==Inhabitants==
Mossbridges was inhabited by a combination of farmers, wealthy merchants, and various workers related to the commerce that traveled through the village. The farmers,{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|19}} whilst the merchants and various other workers inhabited New Town.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|21}} The people of New Town also considered themselves to be Ravenians and petitioned for the city to annex Mossbridges until its eventual incorporation in 1370 DR. The two groups rarely intermingled, safe for inside The Blushing Gynosphinx.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Earl Kassin]], a blacksmith in Old Town.
* [[Jim Wilson]], a local farmer.
* Lord [[Thalmir]], one of the most wealthy humans of the Vast in the 14{{th}} century DR. He rarely concerned himself with the villagers.
* Rulisquer of Tyr, a paladin who policed the village and ran its Temple of Tyr.

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumor had it that the only successful criminal in Mossbridges was a semi-retired smuggler who still dealt with pirates. Supposedly, she was some kind of amphibious shape-changer who would take the form of a [[giant octopus]] to swim out to pirates when they signaled from offshore. It was said she kept her loot stashed underwater, not far from land. One drunken fellow in a tavern claimed it was kept inside [[giant clam]]s and that they snapped shut on and trapped unauthorized people, though this was given little credence, of course.
