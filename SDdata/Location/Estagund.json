        "mainbody": "'''Estagund''' was a kingdom that was one of three realms that composed the [[Shining Lands]] of [[southeast Faerûn]]. It extolled the virtues of commerce and trade among nearly all else, save perhaps for veneration of the [[Adama]], the spiritual belief that was the dominant practice among its people. The kingdom was also home to the legendary [[Maquar]], holy warriors that served at the direction of Estagund's rajah.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "One notable feature of Estagund was the [[Curna Mountains]], a range that extended along its northwestern edge into the realm of Var. They were home to a large population of [[goblinoid]]s, most notably the [[Iron Eye]] tribe.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "[[Monkey spider]]s were popular pets among the Estagundan people.",
            "Climate": "The people of Estagund enjoyed warm, pleasant weather."
        },
        "Government": "Estagund was a hereditary monarchy,<ref name=TSS-116-120\"> and the title of \"rajah\" was handed down across the century's of the kingdom's history. The rajah was assisted in their rule by the [[Council of Chakas]], a group of powerful mercantile houses that facilitated trade throughout not only Estagund, but the other realms of the Shining Lands. In practice, the rajah owed their power to the fact they retained the greatest wealth among their noble peers.\n\nAfter the monster-tribes arose to power in the Beastlands during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], The monarchy also arranged an alliance with the [[rakshasa]]-ruled city of [[Tirumala]], in the Beastlands, though the exact specifications were unknown.",
        "Society": {
            "Culture": "Throughout its history, Estagund shared its cultural origins and heritage with the neighboring realms of Durpar and Var.\n\nTo much of the population of [[Faerûn]], Estagund and the Shining Lands were considered the end of the \"civilized\" world.",
            "Religion": "Adherence to and veneration of the Adama was the main shared philosophical view held by most people of Estagund, and the surrounding Shining Lands. This view held that the entirety of existence was connected under a single spark of creativity, known as the Adama, or The One.\n\nSeveral deities of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] were venerated in Estagund as their lesser-known divine [[aspect]]s, each of which were considered as part of the Adama. Notable among them were [[Gond]], as Zionil; [[Oghma]], as Curna; [[Selûne]], as Lucha or \"She Who Guides\".",
            "Food & Drink": "Dried [[apricot]]s and caked [[quince]] sticks were popular treats among the Estagundan people."
        },
        "Trade": "Like other realms in the Shining Lands, trade and commerce were prominent aspects of Estagund's society.",
        "Defenses": "Estagund was defended by the [[Maquar]], an order of elite warriors that originally acted to further Estagundan trade interests. These dedicated protectors followed a strict code of honor and solely dedicated themselves to safeguarding Estagund and its people.",
        "History": {
            "Origins & Founding": "Over two dozen centuries before [[Dale Reckoning]], the tribes that lived in what would later be known as Estagund (along with Var), formed a portion of ''[[Gundavar]]'', a provincial state of the [[Imaskari Empire]]. When the empire fell in {{Yearlink|-2488}}, Gundavar fell into a collection of warring [[barbarian]] tribes. Some centuries later, the people of future Estagund would come under the reign of the [[Unther|First Untheric Empire]].\n\nIt was not until the {{YearlinkName|-162}}, that the tribal leaders of the realm led their people in open revolt against the ruling rajah. It was on that occasion that the Kingdom of Estagund was founded, separate from the survivor-state of Gundavar.",
            "Dissolution & Reunification": "The fledgling kingdom suffered its first major threat in the {{YearlinkName|-119}}, when Rajah [[Marak III]] attempted to invade Estagund to re-incorporate it into neighboring Gundavar. The people of Estagund were able to resist aggressions long enough, that [[-112 DR|seven years later]], Rajah [[B'Heshti II]] gave up all claim to the kingdom, and renamed his own realm as simply, Var.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|48}}, Estagund's seventh king, [[Thultim]], died without leaving a heir. A civil war broke out over succession to the throne and it divided Estagund into many smaller city-states. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|551}}, Estagund was conquered by [[Reinhar I]] and his [[arkaiun]]s, but three years later the Estagundans regained their independence when Reinhar was slain by the archmage [[Mycontil]] from [[Halruaa]] and they reunited under the rule of King [[Bonrial]].Page 55 of ''[[The Shining South (1993)|The Shining South]]'' states that Estagund fell apart into city-states, whereas the newer sources such as ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' states they united under King Bonrial.",
            "Conflicts At Home & Abroad": "During the 8{{th}} century [[DR]], specifically in the {{YearlinkName|823}}, the military of Estagund engaged in a series of skirmishes with neighboring Var over control of to natural springs and wells. Lord [[Derendri]] of Estagund built a fortified tower to extort a fee from the Varran people. A young hero from the neighboring nation, [[Estelarra Rilpar]] the \"Flame of Var\", rallied warriors from her land and eventually brought down the tower of the Estagundan lord.\n\nSome two hundred years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1023}}, Estagund invaded [[Dambrath]], but were defeated. Not only did they fail to conquer their neighbor, but the vengeful [[crinti]] attacked Estagund in retaliation, slaying most of the working age men throughout the country. Famine soon struck all of Estagund. [[Durpar]] jumped on the opportunity to pacify their violent neighbors and in the {{YearlinkName|1026}}, sent an [[Jeradeem|emissary]] to negotiate terms with King [[Hedgita]] and the nobles of Estagund. After days of negotiating, Durpar purchased the country of Estagund for twenty-four gems. In return, they offered their full protection and taught them the way of Durpari life. A century later, Estagund was fully enveloped into the Shining Lands.\n\nDuring the following century, in the {{YearlinkName|1102}}, Estagund allied with neighboring Durpar and Var to defeat a hive of [[beholder]]s that overtook the cities of [[Vaelan]]tar and [[Assur]]. The [[1103 DR|following year]], they rallied together again to drive out an army of [[demon]]s that arose from the coastal city of [[Ormpé]].\n\nEstagund allied with Durpar yet again, in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, in an allied push to clear the realm of Veldorn from monstrous creatures. Advisors to the kingdom's rulers had been urging the initiation of a \"cleansing march\" They marched into the realm for a mere three days, before their forces were turned away. The accounts of this conflict were included in ''[[The March Into Monsters]]'' by [[Relldeveir Mraztar]].",
            "Era of Upheaval": "As of the the mid-1370s, individuals from the eastern empire of [[Shou Lung]] were working intrigues to establish an enclave—a [[Shou Town]]—in [[Chavyondat]] in Estagund.<ref>{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Eastern Classes}}\n\nEstagund was largely spared for destruction when the [[Spellplague]] struck [[Toril]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Talos]]an cultist [[Ularan Mortus]] led a dreadnaught vessel imbued with the soul of a [[Anauria]]n [[death knight]] from Estagund far west to the [[Sea of Swords]]."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, it was suspected among many the rajah of Estagund was supplanted by some unknown figure, or at the very least fell under sway of some malign magical force.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Settlements": "* [[Chavyondat]], the kingdom's capital situated on the [[Bay of Kings]] housed the [[Seltrarir Palace]], [[House of Chakas]], and the [[House of the Vanquisher]], where the Maquar were trained for service to the rajah. \n* [[Thruldar]], a once-thriving trade city that fell to ruin and was ruled over by the [[ghost]] of the powerful [[druid]] [[Voolad]]."

        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* Vizier [[Devang]], a rakshasa who masqueraded as one of Rajah Seltrarir's most-trusted advisors.\n* [[Indamu Podo]], the leader of the Maquar ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].\n* [[Ronatsinaderin]], the ancient [[green dragon]]."
