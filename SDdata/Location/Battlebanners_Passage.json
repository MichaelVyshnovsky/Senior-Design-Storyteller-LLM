        "History": "In the aftermath of the massacre during the [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlink|1479}}, the [[War Wizards]] [[Welwyn Tracegar]] and [[Yarjack Blamreld]] used it to go towards [[Glathra Barcantle]]; they took no great notice of [[Mirt]] and [[Storm Silverhand]] moving across the hallway, perpendicular to them."
