The '''Duchy of Arcata''' was a province in the Kingdom of [[Damara]] in the [[Cold Lands]].

==Geography==
Arcata was the westernmost province of Damara, abutting the [[Galena Mountains]]. The land was flat and dusty.

==Government==
As of [[1359 DR]], it was ruled by Duke [[William Horgath]] from its capital town of [[Valls]].

==Trade==
Arcata traded with the other Damaran provinces via the [[King's Road]]. As one of the so-called "supply provinces," its farms produced food for the kingdom and its mines harvested [[iron]] and [[silver]].

==History==
The start of the [[Bloodstone Wars]] was marked by a conflict between Arcata and the neighboring [[Barony of Bloodstone]], in which Duke [[William Horgath]] attempted to seize the [[bloodstone]] mines in Baron [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s territory. The attack was ill-prepared and hundreds of Arcatans died before peace was instated by Gareth in what became known as [[Gareth's Gamble]].

The resolution of the conflict led to the concentration of both armies against the threats to the south led many of the Arcatan people to favor unification with the Barony of Bloodstone under Gareth Dragonsbane's rule as king. Rumors were rife in 1359 DR that the [[Ducal Guard]] in Valls were loyal to Gareth instead of William.

==Notable Locations==
* With a population of 1300, [[Valls]] was the largest settlement in Arcata as well as the capital in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Tomrav]] was a mining and farming settlement in the [[Earthspur Mountains]].
* [[Sudrav]] was a village on the shores of [[Lake Icemelt]], in the [[Earthwood]].

==Inhabitants==
Arcata had a population of around 15,000 in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The duchy was mainly made up of farmers, and the Arcatan people were known for their work ethic and self-sufficiency.
