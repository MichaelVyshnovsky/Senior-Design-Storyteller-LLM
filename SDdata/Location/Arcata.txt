The Duchy of Arcata was a province in the Kingdom of Damara in the Cold Lands.
Arcata was the westernmost province of Damara, abutting the Galena Mountains. The land was flat and dusty.
As of 1359 DR, it was ruled by Duke William Horgath from its capital town of Valls.
Arcata traded with the other Damaran provinces via the Kings Road. As one of the so-called "supply provinces," its farms produced food for the kingdom and its mines harvested iron and silver.
The start of the Bloodstone Wars was marked by a conflict between Arcata and the neighboring Barony of Bloodstone, in which Duke William Horgath attempted to seize the bloodstone mines in Baron Gareth Dragonsbanes territory. The attack was ill-prepared and hundreds of Arcatans died before peace was instated by Gareth in what became known as Gareths Gamble.
The resolution of the conflict led to the concentration of both armies against the threats to the south led many of the Arcatan people to favor unification with the Barony of Bloodstone under Gareth Dragonsbanes rule as king. Rumors were rife in 1359 DR that the Ducal Guard in Valls were loyal to Gareth instead of William.
