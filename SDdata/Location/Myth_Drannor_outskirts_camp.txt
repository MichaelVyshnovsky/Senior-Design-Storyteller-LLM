The Myth Drannor outskirts camp was the temporary fortified camp of the Elves of Cormanthor as they worked to reclaim Myth Drannor  alongside the Elven Crusade in the 1370s DR. They were joined there by the Eilistraees Wanderers, a group of drow, and various adventurers and other non-elf folk.
The campsite consisted of a number of tents, pavilions, and huts, interspersed by ancient ruins and trees. The centerpiece of the camp was a semi-intact tower atop a hill. A small dock was built on the shore of the lake for canoes, and a temporary shrine to Amaunator was set up as well.
The camp was located on the south side of Glyrryls Pool, at the east end of Tilvers Dam.
The camp was protected by a large wooden palisade that incorporated some of the pre-existing ruins and vegetation. A contingent of professional elven guards was kept defending the camp against the endless threats that emerged from the ruins and wilderness.
