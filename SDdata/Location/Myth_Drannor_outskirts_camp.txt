The '''Myth Drannor outskirts camp''' was the temporary fortified camp of the [[Elves of Cormanthor]] as they worked to reclaim [[Myth Drannor]]  alongside the [[Elven Crusade]] in the 1370s [[DR]]. They were joined there by the [[Eilistraee's Wanderers]], a group of [[drow]], and various [[adventurer]]s and other non-[[elf]] folk.{{DDO-MoMDtime}}

==Description==
The campsite consisted of a number of [[tent]]s, pavilions, and huts, interspersed by ancient ruins and trees. The centerpiece of the camp was a semi-intact tower atop a hill. A small dock was built on the shore of the lake for [[canoe]]s, and a temporary shrine to [[Amaunator]] was set up as well.

==Geography==
The camp was located on the south side of [[Glyrryl's Pool]], at the east end of [[Tilver's Dam]].

==Defenses==
The camp was protected by a large wooden palisade that incorporated some of the pre-existing ruins and vegetation. A contingent of professional elven guards was kept defending the camp against the endless threats that emerged from the ruins and wilderness.
