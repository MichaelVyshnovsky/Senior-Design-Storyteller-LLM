        "mainbody": "elsforin was a hamlet in Thay. As of the late 15 century DR, it was the only community to have survived within the gruesome landscape of the Charnel Fields west of Surcross.\nThe community lay west of Surcross within the Bonedark Hills, a contested region on the border of Thay and Thesk. This area was darkened by the looming cliffs of the Thayan Plateau and eruptions from the Thaymount. After the formation of the Charnel Fields, the area around the village was inundated with blood and corpses, reeked of death, and was a hotbed for filth fever.\nWhen the Netherese enclave of Kolthunral arrived in the area in the , to attack Surcross, the initial battles between the Netherese and Thayans created the charnel fields and obliterated all other villages in the area. Relsforin endured thanks to Thayan protection, which was offered in exchange for the manual labor of collecting corpses from the Charnel Fields to be used by Thayan necromancers. The villagers were responsible for finding bodies in good physical condition and for gathering and loading them onto military vehicles for transport.\nThe people of Relsforin were traumatized by their experiences and terrified of both the Netherese and the Thayans. They feared what would happen should they ever lose the protection of Thay, and so they strove to make themselves useful and were reflexively hostile to any outsiders. They were known to scavenge the valuables from the corpses that they collected as the Thayans were not interested in anything but the bodies."
