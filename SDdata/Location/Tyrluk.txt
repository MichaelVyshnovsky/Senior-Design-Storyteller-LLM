'''Tyrluk''' ({{Pronounce|TEER|luke|refs=}}) was a small village at the base of the [[Storm Horn Mountains]] in [[Cormyr]].<ref name=VGtC-p173>

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Tyrluk, along with [[Espar]], [[Eveningstar]], and [[Waymoot]], was plagued by rogue [[dragon]]s.

In [[Tarsakh]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Tyrluk was sacked at the beginning of the [[Goblin War]]. By the end of the war all that was left was the smithy and [[the Old Man's Face]] inn, and they were both left in poor condition.<ref>
