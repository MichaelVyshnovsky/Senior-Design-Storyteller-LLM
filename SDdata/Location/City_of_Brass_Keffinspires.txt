The Keffinspires was a district within the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
This quarter of the efreet city housed the golden towers of the azer, many of which were connected to each other by suspended walkways.
Most of the trade within this district was regulated by the Azer Steel Guild, whose offices were located in the golden towers. They had nearly exclusive rights to oversee the manufacture and sale of armor and weapons.
The Keffinspires was primarily populated by azer and some salamanders.
* The Street of Steel, one of the main features of this district.
