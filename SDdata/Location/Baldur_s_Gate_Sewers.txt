The '''sewers of Baldur's Gate''' were a sanitation system of tunnels beneath the city{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-25 - Sewers of Baldur's Gate}} whose operation was maintained by the [[Master of Drains and Underways]].
{{quote|[[Wizard]] called it "Soo-Err". Whatever it's called, it's impressive. And it tastes great.|[[Aelis Siryasius]]'s [[grease mephit]]}}

==Structure==
===Functionality===
;Initial System
Due to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] having geographically started life within a steep-sided bowl, the brute majority of its sewer system operated on gravity and pumps.

This sewer system initially consisted of numerous [[clay]] pipes with narrow interiors, which could be as big as {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in diameter in the largest, lowest sections of the sewers. These pipes were laid in flanged sections that fit into each other and were sealed with concrete.
Pipes only got larger in the areas where they met, which were known as '''junction rooms'''. Such rooms were typically built in areas where “plugs” were likely to occur in the system, so they had a tendency to back up during storms. Only a few of these rooms had '''surface shafts''' with iron rungs set in the walls for use as ladders Those with access shafts always led up to un[[mortar]]ed, rectangular stone "manholes", that were located on the city streets. This ensured that any overflow onto the surface ran down the street, into gratings further away, and back into the system.

The system's pipes ran horizontal, descending in parallel from the plateau around the bowl. They were flushed by cisterns, which were filled by pumps that pulled seawater uphill from the [[River Chionthar]] estuary. These pumps were powered by [[mule]]s trudging in circles. 

As the Gate continued to grow over time, the descending length of pipes got increasingly-long and required the installation of "outer pumps," situated further and further away from the bowl. These were necessary to ensure that waste made its way to the edge of the bowl, where gravity could do the rest of the work and dump it out into the River Chionthar.

The outer pumps were traditionally located in the fortified stone outposts of [[the Watch]] to ensure their mechanisms and mules were safe from mischief.

;Expanded System
[[File:Sewer passage bg.png|thumb|330x330px|''An underground passage that began on the [[Fisher's Wharf]].'']]
The initial system failed to account for the tidal nature of the Gate's river estuary washing untreated sewage back into the intake pumps, creating a cycle of sewage that propagated stench and [[disease]]. These issues were solved in part by a filtration system designed by the [[Church of Gond]] sometime prior to [[1368 DR]].This date is estimated based on the video game [[Baldur's Gate (game)|''Baldur's Gate'']], which is set in 1368 DR, depicting the city's sewers as having this new filtration system.

This new filtration system placed beneath the [[Upper City]] a number of intermediate-flow pumps and stone cellar settling-chambers All together these circulated sewage through gratings and settling “wells” to treat it or use it in the flushing of waste. Both the gratings and the bottoms of these wells required regular cleaning.

Those stone cellars notably connected to the [[Undercellar]], the headquarters of the [[Iron Throne]], and [[Ducal Palace]].

The other major addition of their new system was [[Sewer Keep]],

===Sewer Ecology===
The creatures most commonly encountered in the central sewers beneath the Upper City in 1368 DR included: [[gray ooze]]s, [[green slime]]s, [[mustard jelly|mustard jellies]], [[ochre jellies]], and a tribe of [[kobold]]s led by [[Ratchild]].

The creatures most commonly encountered in the western sewers beneath the Upper City in 1368 DR included: [[ghast]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[phase spider]]s, as well as a sentient [[olive slime]] named [[Schlumpsha]] and his devoted sewerfolk followers.

Other creatures that could be found within the sewers on occasion included [[gelatinous cube]]s, [[beetle|giant beetle]]s, [[giant centipede]]s,<ref> [[rat]]s, [[giant rat]]s,<ref> [[carrion crawler]]s, and [[otyugh]]s.

===Surface Connections===

* The underpass of the [[Basilisk Gate]] had a manhole entrance into the sewers.
* In the center of the alleyway behind the [[Glitter Gala]] was a manhole entrance into the sewers.

==History==
Around 1368 DR, an [[ogre mage]] took refuge in the sewers and used domesticated [[carrion crawler]]s to cause a string of disappearances in eastern Baldur's Gate, luring victims to the sewers and having them eaten by the crawlers after robbing them. Eventually [[Gorion's Ward]] was hired by the Flaming Fist to investigate the disappearances and they confronted the ogre mage within the sewers.

At some point while managing the sewer system and the city's water utilities, [[Grand Duke|Duke]] [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] stumbled upon the subterranean [[Dungeon of the Dead Three]]. She would go on to use her authority as the minister of the [[Department of Drains and Underways]] to ensure its secrecy, having the portion of the sewers that were beneath [[Vanthampur Villa]] cordoned off and building a [[unnamed Vanthampur bathhouse|bathhouse]] above the [[dungeon]].

Around [[1492 DR]] or [[1494 DR]],{{BG-DiA-time}} sewer maintenance supervisor [[Shaleen Zoraz]] was leading an effort to extend the sewers beneath the [[Lower City]] into the Dungeon of the Dead Three. Not wishing for her secret to be stumbled upon, Thalamra had Shaleen kidnapped and imprisoned beneath Vanthampur Villa.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a mad mage by the name of [[Aelis Siryasius]] took up residence in the sewers and populated his small portion of the system with a small army of [[grease mephit]]s, [[grease elemental]]s, and [[greaseball]]s.

==Rumors & Legends==
* Rumors abounded of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] having a connection to the sewers.<ref>
* The [[Three Old Kegs]] was said to contain a secret passage linking it with a sewer shaft that came to the surface near the [[Black Dragon Gate]].<ref>
