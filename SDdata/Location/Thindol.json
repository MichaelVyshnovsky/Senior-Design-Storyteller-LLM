        "mainbody": "hindol was a country on the southern coast of the Chultan Peninsula.\nAbove ground, it was covered in long grasslands. Below ground, however, there were flooded tunnels.\nThe Hills of Sythrilia hid a network of narrow caves.\nThe land was inhabited by Tashalans and Chultans of the Thinguth tribe. Although human, some carried the blood of their yuan-ti conquerors. They were famed for their incredibly swift running ability. Others had exceptional endurance.\nGold dwarves dwelt in the hills and the mountains, while kuo-toa and yuan-ti (with a swimming snake appearance) lurked in the flooded tunnels. The latter two races were allied and at war with the dwarves.\nIt was a mercantile nation defended by very capable militias and dedicated yuan-ti hunters. They fought with fine cutlasses and even blade boots and wore studded leather, while potions of blur were common.\n* Sythrilia, a famous heroine responsible for freeing her people from the rule of the yuan-ti, for whom the Hills of Sythrilia were named.\n* The Sythrilian Sybil, a noted psychic seer and expert on psionics named for the Hills of Sythrilia in which she dwelt."
