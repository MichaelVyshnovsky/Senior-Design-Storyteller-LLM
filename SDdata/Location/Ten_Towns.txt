The '''Ten Towns''', sometimes written as '''Ten-Towns''', were a loose confederation of frontier villages found in [[Icewind Dale]] in the western [[Frozenfar]]. The communities of the Ten Towns attracted those people of [[Faer√ªn]] determined to find a life for themselves, and those desperate to leave their former lives behind.

While life within each community exemplified diligence and partnership, relations between each of the communities demonstrated the fierce competitive spirit that was needed to survive in [[the North]].

==Geography==
The [[Shaengarne]] river extended west from the Ten Towns, through the dale's western tundras.

==Geographical Features==
The Ten Towns were formed around the three lakes of Icewind Dale, [[Redwaters]], [[Lac Dinneshere]], and [[Maer Dualdon]]. 

Situated northwest of Redwaters, the smallest of the lakes, were fittingly enough the smallest villages, [[Dougan's Hole]] and [[Good Mead]]. To the north was Lac Dinneshere, upon the shores of which sat the settlements of [[Easthaven]], [[Caer-Dineval]], and [[Caer-Konig]]. Some {{SI|10|mi|k}} west was the largest and deepest of the lakes, Maer Dualdon, around which were situated the towns of [[Lonelywood]] (along with its [[Lonelywood Forest|namesake forest]]), [[Bremen]], [[Termalaine]], and the walled city of [[Targos]].

Between Lac Dinneshere and Maer Dualdon was the massive solitary peak of [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. a deep chasm that housed a number of [[dwarf]] clans.

Southwest of the valley, nestled between all three lakes,

==Government==
Official decisions for the towns were made by a council consisting of one influential member from each town. These council members, called speakers, met in the council building in [[Bryn Shander]], which was unanimously recognized as the capital of the Ten Towns, and of Icewind Dale itself, once a month during the summer season, and once every three in the winter.

;14{{th}} Century:
Around the time of the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]], the council consisted of the following individuals:

* [[Dougan's Hole]] - Freya Grynstead
* [[Good Mead]] - Unknown
* [[Easthaven]] - [[Glensather]]
* [[Caer-Dineval]] - [[Jensin Brent]]
* [[Caer-Konig]] - [[Schermont]]
* [[Lonelywood]] - [[Muldoon]]
* [[Bremen]] - [[Gil Haerngen]]
* [[Termalaine]] - [[Agorwal]]
* [[Targos]] - [[Kemp]]
* [[Bryn Shander]] - [[Cassius]]

In the years leading up to the battle, other individuals served as spokesmen on the council, such as the [[halfling]] [[Regis]], and [[Dorim Lugar]], who was killed over a fish. under the leadership of [[Revjak|King Revjak]].

;15{{th}} Century:
As of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the council comprised the following individuals:
* Dougan's Hole - [[Edgra Durmoot]]
* Good Mead - [[Kendrick Rielsbarrow]]
* Easthaven - [[Danneth Waylen]]
* Caer-Dineval - [[Crannoc Siever]]
* Caer-Konig - [[Alden Lowell]]
* Lonelywood - [[Avandro Perth]]
* Bremen - [[Dorbulgruf Shalescar]]
* Termalaine - [[Shaelen Masthew]]
* Targos - [[Giandro Holfast]]
* Bryn Shander - [[Duvessa Shane]]

==Trade==
The fishing and sale of [[knucklehead trout]], along with the [[scrimshaw]] made from its bones, was the industry that allowed the Ten Towns to remain in existence for as many years as they have. Each of the lakeside settlements maintained their own fleet of fishing ships.

Despite some timbering industry in [[Lonelywood]], the Ten Towns had to import much of the wood they used for construction and warmth.

==History==
The Ten Town began from single community, founded by the [[Dinev]] family of [[Cormyr]], at the shore of Lac Dinneshere.

==Inhabitants==

The Ten Towns attracted those who were brave and hard-working enough to set out for a harsh life they could call their own. Among these were prospectors, miners,, treasure-hunters, and other industrious, but sometimes less-reputable folks. Fugitives often came to the Ten Towns to flee their troubles, only to find a life of hard work ahead of them. Some petty criminals, and other agents serving malevolent forces, settled within the communities.

[[Dwarves]] stayed within their nearby holds and underground halls.

Many of the folks from Caer-Konig and Bremen traced their ancestry to clans of the Reghedmen tribesmen that once dwelled within those settlements.
