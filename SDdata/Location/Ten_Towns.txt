The Ten Towns, sometimes written as Ten-Towns, were a loose confederation of frontier villages found in Icewind Dale in the western Frozenfar. The communities of the Ten Towns attracted those people of Faer√ªn determined to find a life for themselves, and those desperate to leave their former lives behind.
While life within each community exemplified diligence and partnership, relations between each of the communities demonstrated the fierce competitive spirit that was needed to survive in the North.
The Shaengarne river extended west from the Ten Towns, through the dales western tundras.
The Ten Towns were formed around the three lakes of Icewind Dale, Redwaters, Lac Dinneshere, and Maer Dualdon. 
Situated northwest of Redwaters, the smallest of the lakes, were fittingly enough the smallest villages, Dougans Hole and Good Mead. To the north was Lac Dinneshere, upon the shores of which sat the settlements of Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig. Some  west was the largest and deepest of the lakes, Maer Dualdon, around which were situated the towns of Lonelywood (along with its namesake forest), Bremen, Termalaine, and the walled city of Targos.
Between Lac Dinneshere and Maer Dualdon was the massive solitary peak of Kelvins Cairn. a deep chasm that housed a number of dwarf clans.
Southwest of the valley, nestled between all three lakes,
Official decisions for the towns were made by a council consisting of one influential member from each town. These council members, called speakers, met in the council building in Bryn Shander, which was unanimously recognized as the capital of the Ten Towns, and of Icewind Dale itself, once a month during the summer season, and once every three in the winter.

The fishing and sale of knucklehead trout, along with the scrimshaw made from its bones, was the industry that allowed the Ten Towns to remain in existence for as many years as they have. Each of the lakeside settlements maintained their own fleet of fishing ships.
Despite some timbering industry in Lonelywood, the Ten Towns had to import much of the wood they used for construction and warmth.
The Ten Town began from single community, founded by the Dinev family of Cormyr, at the shore of Lac Dinneshere.

The Ten Towns attracted those who were brave and hard-working enough to set out for a harsh life they could call their own. Among these were prospectors, miners,, treasure-hunters, and other industrious, but sometimes less-reputable folks. Fugitives often came to the Ten Towns to flee their troubles, only to find a life of hard work ahead of them. Some petty criminals, and other agents serving malevolent forces, settled within the communities.
Dwarves stayed within their nearby holds and underground halls.
Many of the folks from Caer-Konig and Bremen traced their ancestry to clans of the Reghedmen tribesmen that once dwelled within those settlements.
