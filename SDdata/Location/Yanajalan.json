        "mainbody": "Yanajalan was a fortress in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra, standing on the southern trade road.Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, Yanajalan has not been marked on any map of Malatra.\nIt was a squat but strong fortification.\nCirca 1357 DR, it had a garrison of 1,000 soldiers. They busied themselves with patrolling the trade road to make it safe for those who used it. However, the garrison commander, Chou Yueng, was believed to be overzealous in his duties, even extorting \"road fees\" from travelers to guarantee their safe passage. Those from outside the kingdom who refused to pay risked being imprisoned for up to ten days and their property being confiscated."
