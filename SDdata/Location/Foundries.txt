The foundries of Hiyal were the source of the cities endless riches and pollution around 1367 DR.
The structure of the foundries was located just north of Hiyal along Al-Wahl River.
Many of the finest weapons throughout the Land of Fate were forged in the foundries. The mamluks of Qudra commissioned hundreds of weapons on a yearly basis. Weaponsmiths and armorers travelled to Hiyal to develop their craft. The fires of the foundries never stopped, blazing through each night belching forth fine weaponry and thick soot.
