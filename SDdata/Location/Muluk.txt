'''Muluk, '''located on the mouth of [[Al-Zalim River]], was one of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free Cities of Zakhara.]] Renowned as a trading city, Muluk specialized in many goods including regal purple [[dye]]. Its established unbroken line of rulers gave it the name "'''City of Kings'''". It was located between the cities of [[Umara]] to the south and [[Qadib]] to the north.

==Inhabitants==
Muluk was the base for the [[Respected Mamluk Society]].{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|2122}}

==Defenses==
Muluk's armed forces consisted of 2,000 footmen, 5,000 militia, and 1,000 cavalry. Additionally, the mamluks of the Respected numbered 2,000 strong.

==History==
Muluk was initially founded as the city of '''In'aash''' which translated to "place of life-giving refreshment" in [[Old Anwahran]]. Centuries later the city was renamed after the Caliph accepted the [[Law of the Loregiver]].
