'''Ironspur''' was one of the three major [[Dwarf|dwarven]] holds in the northern [[Galena Mountains]] as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], along with [[Hillsafar Hall]] and [[Bloodstone Mines]].

==Description==
The city was a rugged settlement

==Geography==
Ironspur was located on the edge of the [[Galena Mountains]] within the borders of the [[Duchy of Soravia]] in the Kingdom of [[Damara]]. It was connected to the city of [[Palischuk]] in [[Vaasa]] via the treacherous [[High Walk]] across the mountains.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

==Trade==
The nearby mountains were mined for [[silver]], [[iron]], and [[bloodstone]], while the city itself was renowned for its forges.

==History==
Following the defeat of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the dwarves of Ironspur helped to drive Zhengyi's remaining forces from Helmsdale, ending the village's twelve year occupation. 

Around the same time, the dwarves quickly developed a surprisingly good relationship with the [[half-orcs]] of [[Palischuk]] following their refounding of that city.
