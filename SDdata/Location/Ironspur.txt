Ironspur was one of the three major dwarven holds in the northern Galena Mountains as of the 14 century DR, along with Hillsafar Hall and Bloodstone Mines.
The city was a rugged settlement
Ironspur was located on the edge of the Galena Mountains within the borders of the Duchy of Soravia in the Kingdom of Damara. It was connected to the city of Palischuk in Vaasa via the treacherous High Walk across the mountains.
The nearby mountains were mined for silver, iron, and bloodstone, while the city itself was renowned for its forges.
