        "mainbody": "astle Dunraven was a haunted ruin said to sometimes appear before travelers lost during the fierce snowstorms of Damara.\nThis old ruin appeared to be a good place for travelers to seek shelter during snowy weather. It was said to contain a dark and seemingly bottomless pool of water that did not freeze, but which claimed the lives of any who drank from it.\nCastle Dunravens reputation was well-known in Damara as of the late 15 century DR. Most information about it came from those who had seen its horrors and survived.\nThe ruin was reputed to be haunted by a glowing green woman wearing knights armor."
