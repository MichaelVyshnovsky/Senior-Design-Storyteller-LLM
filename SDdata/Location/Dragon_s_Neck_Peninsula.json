        "mainbody": "The Dragons Neck Peninsula was the eastern part of the Tethyr Peninsula, with the Dragons Head Peninsula being its western part.The sourcebooks use the names Dragons Neck Peninsula and later Tethyr Peninsula interchangeably. However, more precise geography was introduced in Volos Guide to Baldurs Gate II. To avoid confusion, the page uses the Tethyr Peninsula to refer to the entire landmass, Dragons Head Peninsula to refer to the western part of the land (also called the Velen Peninsula), and the Dragons Neck Peninsula to refer to the eastern part of the Tethyr Peninsula.\nMost of the peninsula was covered by the wild Forest of Tethir with the Firedrake Road crossing it on the southern bank. That stretch of the road was dangerous and sometimes hard to pass because of narrow trails, wild beasts, and bandits. The hamlet of Jhaansciim was the first notable settlement along the road in the Dragons Neck Peninsula, several miles away from Khalids Wall, a long ruined wall perpendicular to the shoreline.\nThe Tethyr Peninsula was a landmass that protruded from the mainland of Tethyr in a shape that resembled a dragon with its maw wide open. The eastern part was called the Dragons Neck Peninsula, aptly named for its shape being that of a dragons neck. Tarseth Bay washed the northern side of the Dragons Neck and the Firedrake Bay to the south.\n*Burnt Bones Cove, once a prosperous settlement called Larungyr, later, a peaceful cove with remnants of the burnt town, on the north-eastern edge of the peninsula.\n*Honorguard House, a fortified manor of County Fyraven.\n*Kaalinth, a small city keep that collapsed into the Tarseth Bay many years before the 14 century DR.\n*Cephalopolop, the kraken ruler of an underwater city of Sloopdilmonpolop, deep underneath the Dragons Neck Peninsula."
