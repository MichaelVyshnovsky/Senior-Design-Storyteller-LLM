'''Barroch's Hold''' was a citadel located on the [[Glacier of the White Worm]] in the [[Earthspur Mountains]], and once the fabled lair of [[Barroch]], the first great bandit lord of the [[Inner Sea]].
==History==
In the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]], a band of adventurers rediscovered Barroch's Hold but soon ran into a number of strange creatures, and were separated or killed. Two of them survived—[[Yostur Ulhmond]] and [[Feenoch|Feenoch the Five-Fingered]]—and made it to [[Orm]] to tell their story, though they would not be drawn on the matter of treasure. By the end of the year, it was said in [[Hillsfar]] they were trying to muster a larger group of adventurers, bearing [[sledge]]s, perhaps intending to return.
