        "mainbody": "Tilbrand, formerly known as Hilbrand, was a walled port city located just south of the country of Aglarond.It is not clear whether the change of name was intentional or occurred because of a typo in The Forgotten Realms Atlas (1990). Both names appear in Spellbound (1995), although \"Hilbrand\" is only used in the section about the citys history while \"Tilbrand\" is used for the present name. Sources afterward refer to the city as \"Tilbrand\".\nThe city lay on the coast of the Wizards Reach on the Sea of Fallen Stars just south of the Yuirwood. It was situated in between Laothkund to the west and Taskaunt to the east.\nThe city was ruled by an elected council. It also had a ceremonial position of \"High Lord\", who oversaw festivals and played host to foreign diplomats. \nAfter the city came under the nominal rule of Thay in the mid&ndash14 century DR, it was technically administered by Hezess Nymar, the Tharchion of faraway Lapendrar. Nymars agents visited the city only periodically, and it continued to largely govern itself.\nHilbrand was initially founded by the empire of Unther following the great wars between Narfell and Raumathar, but over the passage of time Unther lacked the strength to hold it and Hilbrand eventually declared independence. It subsequently was known as Tilbrand.\nWhile many died in the fighting and several older parts of the city burned down in the war, the city soon recovered and rebuilt. Some came to see the Salamander War as having been a blessing in disguise.\nAlthough nominally a Thayan vassal, Tilbrand continued to rule itself and simply pay tribute to Thay. However, within a decade it had grown increasingly confident that Thay was not willing to risk a military venture to punish the city for failing to pay, and so it had begun to give only some of the tribute demanded of it. In that time, it had also grown closer with Aglarond and with the infuential Waverunner clan, both of whom helped to defend the city.\nApproximately 20,000 people lived within Hilbrand as of 1357 DR, growing to 25,000 a decade later. It hosted a force of Aglarondan rangers who helped to defend the townsfolk."
