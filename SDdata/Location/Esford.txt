Esford was a small village in western Amn.
Esford lay in the Dauntir region on the south bank of the River Esmel, some distance north of the Imnescourse Trail. Shepherdston and Harvest House lay to the west, while Esmeltaran and Gambiton were to the east.
The village was the last stop for barges on the Esmel on the way from Esmeltaran to Purskul, and so local farmers often met there to buy goods from the river route. Barter was extremely common, and was even accepted at the villages trade post if coins werent available.
