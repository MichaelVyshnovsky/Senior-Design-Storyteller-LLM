'''Camp Vengeance''' was the forward camp for the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] for their operations in [[Chult]]. It succeeded their former headquarters, [[Camp Righteous]], which was previously overrun by the [[undead]].

It was led by the [[Tyr]]ran knight, [[Niles Breakbone|Commander Niles Breakbone]].

==Location==
The camp was located in the western bank of the [[River Soshenstar]] just a few miles north of the [[Aldani Basin]].

==Structure==
The camp was formed by wooden palisades dotted with a number of watchtowers and a main gatehouse. It was encircled by a 20-foot-deep (6.1 meter) trench, lined with sharpened wooden stakes.<ref name="ToA-p48" >

==History==
The camp was originally founded by the handful of survivors that escaped the slaughter at Camp Righteous.

==Inhabitants==
The camp was staffed by a variety of [[templar]]s, [[priest]]s and [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] locals. Serving under Commander Breakbone were his long-time ally [[Wulf Rygor]], captains [[Ord Firebeard]] and [[Perne Salhana]], and nearly three dozen other soldiers and templar. [[Cyas|Sister Cyas]] watched over a handful of clergy and [[Lorsa Bitwatal]] led her fellow Chultan tribesmen.
