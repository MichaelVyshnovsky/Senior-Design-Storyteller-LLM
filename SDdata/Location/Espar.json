        "Description": "Espar was a farming town with one inn: [[The Watchful Eye]], and a small shrine to [[Helm]], where Lord Hezom, a priest of Helm, took care of the ill and wounded, when necessary.",
        "Geography": "Espar was located on the [[Way of the Dragon]], sheltered by the [[King's Forest]] to its north. Before the space trees joined together to for the King's Forest, the hamlet was separate from it by lush green rolling hills. The folk of Espar were not numerous enough to make a dent into the tree-line, harvesting firewood. The highest hill was crowned with ruins of a stone cottage, so old, no-one actually know who build it. The structure was no big enough to be a keep but the locals called it simply the [[Stronghold]]. The ruins were a popular place for young and brave Esparran whipper-snappers.\n\nThe lush hills were the perfect graze pasture for Esparran [[sheep]] flocks.",
        "Trade": "Animal pelts from the [[Thunder Peaks]] and the [[Storm Horns]] did very good business in Espar as of 1368 DR.",
        "History": "In [[1022 DR]], [[Elminster Aumar]] was looking for a band of adventurers for the [[Harpers]]. He found the [[Wanderers of Espar]], led by [[Finder Wyvernspur]], in Espar. The [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] also originated in Espar.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], Espar, along with [[Eveningstar]], [[Tyrluk]] and [[Waymoot]], was plagued by rogue dragons.\n\n[[Dove Falconhand]] temporarily moved to Espar with her husband, [[Florin Falconhand]] (who was born in Espar), to bear her child.",
