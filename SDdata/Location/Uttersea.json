        "mainbody": "Uttersea was the largest settlement and capital of Tuern.\nThe capital of Tuern was built upon a collapsed volcanic crater. The crater was huge on all sides, and acted as a weather shield to those of Uttersea, so the inhabitants were able to resist heavy winds and rain. The geothermal activity beneath the volcanic crater warmed the surface above it, providing heat in such a cold area of the Frozenfar.\nUttersea was ruled by a high king, who acted as the king of kings on Tuern.\nThose of Uttersea made profit by fishing, farming and whaling. They also spent time mining for adamantine and diamonds, but they were unable to refine, or make useful items and weapons, out of these rare materials.\nMany Northmen made Uttersea their home, but so did many other species, such as giant octopuses."
