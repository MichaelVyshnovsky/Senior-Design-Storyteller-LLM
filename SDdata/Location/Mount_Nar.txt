'''Mount Nar''' was a massive mountain in the [[Firward Mountains]] of [[Narfell]]. Its perpetually snowcapped peak was visible across most of that realm.

==Description==
The huge, rugged mountain with its bluish glaciers was a dominant feature across the plains of Narfell. The mountain was clearly visible as far away as [[N'Jast]], and as of the mid&ndash;15{{th}} century [[DR]], the ruins on the western side of the mountain were visible from [[Bildoobaris]].

Mount Nar's glaciers dominated its western and northern slopes

==History==
In ancient times, the capital of the [[Nar]] kingdom of [[Jastaath]] was located atop Mount Nar, and their powerful [[Nar demonbinder|demonbinders]] altered the weather to make the mountain warm and hospitable. However, after the kingdom was abandoned, the mountain became covered in snow and ice, and the ruins of Jastaath became lost beneath the snows. The kingdom came to be remembered only in archaic texts and local legends.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the mountain was the domain of [[Kryonar]], a [[white dragon]] [[dracolich]] who murdered anyone who approached the peak. Kryonar was so feared that no Nars dared to scale the mountain.

Beginning in the mid&ndash;15{{th}} century DR, the ruins atop the mountain had been claimed by [[Branimern Rythil]], who slew Kryonar and sought to uncover the ancient secrets of Jastaath to enable her to conquer the surrounding lands. She constructed for herself a towering stronghold amidst the old ruins high on the western slope, and beginning around the {{YearlinkName|1439}}, this structure was visible from Bildoobaris.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Jastaath Castle]], a massive ruined fortress on the western side of the mountain near the peak.
* '''Kryonar's caverns''', a natural cavern on the north side of the mountain near Jastaath Castle that was once the lair of Kryonar. The cavern was only accessible via tunnels through a glacier. Following Kryonar's destruction, the cavern became home to a number of monsters loyal to Branimern Rythil, including a number of [[cyclops]]es.

==Inhabitants==
During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Kryonar was the most notable inhabitant of Mount Nar.

During the late 15{{th}} century DR, Branimern Rythil and her [[fiend]]ish and [[fey]] minions were the most notable inhabitants. This included the formidable [[fomorian]] known as [[Hughan]].
