'''Nairn's Tomb''' was the middle of the three islands located south of [[Thelve]] and southwest from the the fortress library of [[Candlekeep]].

==Description==
Nairn's Tomb was a rocky outcropping that sore above the [[Sea of Swords]] – fissured [[granite]] with temperate woods growing among the cracks. It was a steep-sided, rocky, and heavily-forested island. Nairn's Tomb was {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} long east to west and a bit over {{SI|2|mile|k|long=yes}} from north to south.

The rock underneath the island was honeycombed with underground chambers and tunnels tall enough to accommodate a [[dwarf]]. Many of these tunnels dropped down all the way into the [[Underdark]]. The island has one sheltered anchorage at the center of its eastern shore, but Nairn's Tomb completely lacked beaches or harbors.

==Geography==
Nairn's Tomb's northern shores were awash by [[Skoond's Run]] that separated the large island of Thelve from three of its southern sisters. [[Arthoum]] was the smallest and westernmost of the three, Nairn's Tomb was the middle isle, and [[Askalet]] was the easternmost and lowest to the [[Sword Coast]] shores. Arthoum was just a {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} away from Nairn's Tomb, while [[Askalet]] was {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} away from Nairn's Tomb.

===Flora & Fauna===
Unlike other islands among the seven, Nairn's Tomb was completely devoid of seabirds who avoided the island for some unknown reason.

==History==
Nairn's Tomb's namesake was a long-dead adventurer entombed in an abandoned dwarf-delve that could be accessed through the island's highest point. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tomb itself had been emptied of all its valuables and was rumored to be haunted by phantoms or other much more dangerous things. Over the years, the island's tunnels were used by pirates and smugglers and prowled by underground monsters. [[Miirym]], the guardian [[dragon]] of Candlekeep, was known to travel from the fortress to Nairn's Tomb through underground passages.
