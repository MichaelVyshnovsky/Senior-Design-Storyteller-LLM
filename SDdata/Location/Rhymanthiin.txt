'''Rhymanthiin''', also called the '''Hidden City of Hope''', was a city on the [[High Moor]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. It was a reconstruction of the ancient [[Miyeritar]]i city of [[Faer'tel'miir]], the Library City of [[Miyeritar]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|author=[[Steven E. Schend]]|title=Blackstaff: Chapters 28 – 40|topicid=7224|whichpage=2|postid=143532|date=2006-07-21|accessdate=2008-04-21}} Rhymanthiin served as a center for magic, knowledge, lore, and the unity of different races.

==Description==
The great boulevards and high walls of Rhymanthiin were clean and straight. They were constructed of massive, pitch-black stone blocks.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|59}}

==Geography==
Rhymanthiin was located on the High Moor on the exact spot that the Miyeritari city of Faer'tel'miir once occupied. The High Moor was partly cleansed by this city-raising, and the toxins were redirected into the body of the [[lich]] [[Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk]], thus also starting the rejuvenation of the High Moor.

==Inhabitants==
The city only accepted those who were "worthy of her," and those with malice in their hearts "shall not find their way here."

==Defenses==
The city had high walls and was invisible to most outsiders, appearing instead as an empty plain. Within the city, [[sharn]]s lived within the walls and streets, and could freely emerge to attack any who threatened the city.

==History==
===Construction===
It was created on the [[Feast of the Moon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, through a [[High Magic]] Ritual of Myriad and manipulation of the [[Killing Storms]] by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]], [[Tsarra Chaadren]], and [[Danthra the Dreamer]], all of whose souls were within the body of Tsarra Chaadren, and over ninety wielders of the Art. Among the notable participants in the ritual were the three grand mages and many other sharn:
* The [[Chosen of Mystra]]: Khelben Arunsun, [[Elminster Aumar]], [[Laeral Silverhand]], [[Alustriel Silverhand]], and [[Alvaerele Tasundrym]], the Silent Chosen.
* [[Mentor Wintercloak]], one of the [[Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor]].
* [[Ualair|Ualair the Silent]], Grand Mage of [[Myth Drannor]], keeper of Uvaeren's Secrets, and master of the [[N'Vaelahr]] of Myth Drannor.
* High Mage [[Orjalun]] of [[Silverymoon]].
* The elf wizards [[Darcassan]] of [[Windsong Tower]] and [[Shalantha Omerdawn]].
* The human [[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]].
* The gnome [[Parthar|Parthar the Valiant]], also called [[Rhymallos]] the Hidden Eye, an unsung hero of Myth Drannor who took the form of a [[mezzoloth]] to infiltrate the [[Army of Darkness]].
* The wizard [[Malchor Harpell]].
* [[Syndra Wands]], granddaughter of Khelben.
* The Tethyrian wizard Lord [[Gamalon Idogyr]], Count of [[Spellshire]], Sage of the Royal Court of [[Tethyr]], and great-grandson of Khelben.
* Lord [[Maskar Wands]]
* [[Phaerl Hawksong]]
* [[Luvon Greencloak]]
* The [[bronze dragon]] [[Essioanawrath|Essioanawrath the Elder]].
* The [[gold dragon]] [[Tlanchass]].
* The dragon called [[the Argentalon]].
* The [[tiefling]] mage [[Tulrun|Tulrun of the Tent]].
* The [[Mistmaster]] and his consort [[Azure]].
* The wizards and former [[Zhentarim]] [[Sememmon]] and [[Ashemmi]].
* [[Maaril]], the Dragonmage of Waterdeep.
* [[Nain Keenwhistler]].
* The high-ranking clerics of [[Oghma]]: Fourth Reader [[Shaynara Tullastar]] of Candlekeep, Loremaster [[Cadathlyn]] of the House of Many Tomes, and [[Sandrew|Sandrew the Wise]], lorekeeper high and ranking priest of the [[Font of Knowledge]] in [[Waterdeep]].
* [[Kyriani Agrivar]], [[half-elf]] mistress of [[Selûne's Smile]].
* [[Elsura Dauniir]].
* A number of [[sharn]]: previously three grand mages of [[Miyeritar]]—[[T'karon]], [[Hamra]], and [[Alunor]]—and some 80 other citizens.
This was all by the design of [[the Pentad]], the five gods [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Sehanine Moonbow]], [[Dumathoin]], [[Mystra]], and [[Oghma]].

===Legacy===
Rhymanthiin was largely untouched by the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Hidden City of Hope still stood, hidden within the [[Feywild]] and invisible to any outsiders not welcome in the city. It had grown to be roughly the size of [[Waterdeep]], and hosted the largest population of "redeemed" [[drow]] in [[Faerûn]] alongside [[good]] folk of all races.
