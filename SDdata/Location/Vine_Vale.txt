The Vine Vale, was the area of Evereska that immediately surrounded the city and the mesa atop which it stood. The lush valley was a dedicated agricultural center, filled with bountiful orchards and vineyards. 
It was a vast, crescent-shaped staircase of lush, terraced vineyards and black soiled winter fields, descending toward Evereskas walls in a series of terraces covered in smokethorn trees and spiny soapleaf.
The vale was covered by continuous mists that obscured vision of Evereska itself.
This secret garden of the elves was encircled by the greater region known as the Upper Vale.
Parts of the upper Vine Vale were destroyed by phaerimm in the , as skirmishes broke out between the recently-released monstrosities and the elves of Evereska.
