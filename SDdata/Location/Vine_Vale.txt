The '''Vine Vale''', was the area of [[Evereska]] that immediately surrounded the city and the mesa atop which it stood. The lush valley was a dedicated agricultural center, filled with bountiful orchards and vineyards. 

==Description==
It was a vast, crescent-shaped staircase of lush, terraced vineyards and black soiled winter fields, descending toward Evereska's walls in a series of terraces covered in [[smokethorn]] trees and spiny [[soapleaf]].

The vale was covered by continuous mists that obscured vision of Evereska itself.

==Geography==
This secret garden of the elves was encircled by the greater region known as the [[Upper Vale]].

==History==
Parts of the upper Vine Vale were destroyed by [[phaerimm]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, as skirmishes broke out between the recently-released monstrosities and the elves of Evereska.

==Notable Locations==
* Arvandor Gate, a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Arvandor|plane that housed]] the domain of [[Hanali Celanil]].
* ThistleHoney Vineyard
