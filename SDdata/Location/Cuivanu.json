        "mainbody": "'''Cuivanu''', known as '''the spirit tree''',{{Cite digital book/Sword of the Gods||26}} was a great and mystical tree that grew at the heart of the [[Misty Vale (forest)|Misty Vale]] in [[south Faer√ªn]]. Its location was lost when the Misty Vale was destroyed following the [[Spellplague]], leading it to be known as the [[Dead Vale]].",
        "Description": "Cuivanu was said to be a flowering tree located in a hidden glade deep in the Misty Vale. Its sap had potent curative and life-giving powers.\n\nThe tree was sacred to the [[elves]] of [[Elfharrow]]&mdash;once known as the [[grugach]]&mdash;and they prayed and dreamed that the tree had somehow survived the devastation that had befallen the once-holy ground of the Dead Vale. Their warriors were known to pledge their lives to the tree as they committed to suicidal attacks.",
        "History": "The location of the tree was lost sometime after the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, when the shifting climate and disruptions of magic caused by the Spellplague began to erode the Misty Vale. As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, elven tribesfolk of Elfharrow still desperately sought the tree, hoping that it had somehow survived and that its healing magic could be used to restore their homeland. Their worst fear was that the tree was already dead, rotted, or worse."
