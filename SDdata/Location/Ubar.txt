'''Ubar''', also called the '''Lost City of Ubar''', was a unique city found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

Ubar was the given name of the city in [[Jannti]], the common [[genie]] tongue, but the [[desert giant]]s referred to the location as '''Dayya''' in their own language.

==Geography==
This mystical city was said to rise from the sands of the [[Genies' Anvil]] of the [[High Desert]] whenever the genies commanded. Other travelers said it was a permanent fixture of the desert. 

==Description==
Ubar was ringed with strong stone walls and iron gates. Eight octagonal-shaped towers provided splendid views of the surrounding terrain. Ubar's central market was built around a deep well. All of the buildings in Ubar were large enough to accommodate [[giant]]s, prompting the logical conclusion that it was originally constructed by desert giants.

Because of the Amir's poor health, and lack of leadership to direct routine maintenance, many of the buildings in Ubar were in need of repair.

The Amir's palace, the [[Red Tower of Dayya]], was located in the center of the city.

Mosques to [[Hajama]], [[Najm]], and [[Haku]] could be found within Ubar.

==Activities==
Perhaps in an attempt to win back a location that was originally theirs, desert giants raided Ubar frequently.

==Inhabitants==
Ubar was populated by an astonishing 200,000 [[jann]], though many of them only visited periodically while wandering the desert. Any janni within the city was not required to answer the call of a [[sha'ir]].

==Defenses==
Ubar fielded 2,000 soldiers to guard the city. Many of these soldiers were [[camel]] lancers and archers.
