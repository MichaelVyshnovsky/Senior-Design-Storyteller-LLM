Baeniff Tor was a hill in the marshland of the Evermoors, in Luruar.
It was located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of the town of Nesmé, and 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) north of Morach Tor. Around 1374 DR there existed flooded mines underneath the tor, which was where the lizardfolk of the Khoroshen tribe took the captured Chaver Tegarech of Nesmé to be sacrificed. The mines beneath the hill led into the Underdark.
