'''Baeniff Tor''' was a hill in the marshland of the [[Evermoors]], in [[Luruar]].

It was located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of the town of [[Nesmé]], and 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) north of [[Morach Tor]]. Around [[1374 DR]] there existed flooded mines underneath the tor, which was where the [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Khoroshen]] tribe took the captured [[Chaver Tegarech]] of Nesmé to be sacrificed.{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|18}} The mines beneath the hill led into the [[Underdark]].{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|23}}
