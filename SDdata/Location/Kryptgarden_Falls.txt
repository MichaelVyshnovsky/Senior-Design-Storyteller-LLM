Kryptgarden Falls was an ancient Netherese outpost built in the Sword Mountains during its early period of expansion.
The outpost was located within the foothills of the northern Sword Mountains, in the woods of the Kryptgarden Forest northwest of Southkrypt.
Kryptgarden Falls came about during Netherils Silver Age ( to ), when the Terraseer directed Netheril to explore its western frontier. Reported among the first promising sites in , alongside Old Owl Well and Spirecoast, Kryptgarden Falls served as a caravan stop, watering station, and fortified watchpost amid Netherils westward expansion. Secured with warriors and overseen by arcanists, it was equipped with crystal balls that were used to spy on the surrounding area, especially the nearby elves of Illefarn. The outpost was also fitted with a mythallar that powered quasimagical items, but the requirement for expeditions to venture further and further afield caused the development of some of Netherils first proper magical items that could be used anywhere.
