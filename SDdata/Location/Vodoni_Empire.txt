The '''Vodoni Empire''' was a vast and aggressive realm in the [[phlogiston]]. Spanning twelve [[crystal sphere]]s, it was the largest and mightiest empire in the region of the [[Prime Material plane]] known to  the inhabitants of [[Realmspace]]. In the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], an attempted [[vodoni]] invasion of Realmspace, [[Greyspace]], and [[Krynnspace]] triggered the conflict that became known as the [[War of the Spheres]].

==Defenses==
The empire counted with a vast fleet of [[spelljammer]]s and an army of [[lycanthrope|lycanthropic]] soldiers that numbered in the tens of millions. the [[nightwolf]], and the [[werewolf (spelljammer)|werewolf]], which were all built by the [[zalani]] in one of the crystal spheres controlled by the Empire. Vulkaran's personal warship was a unique [[vodoni diamond]].

==History==
===Formation===
The vodoni expansion started sometime in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], when [[Vodon Prime]], the star of [[Vodonispace]], exploded in a supernova. The disaster caused unimaginable destruction throughout the system, completely destroying the fourth planet [[Kathyk (planet)|Kathyk]] and opening a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] on the first planet [[Sala]]. The entire population of the sphere had to flee to the neighboring sphere of [[Vodonikaspace]] in a massive exodus led by emperor [[Vulkaran]].

The [[deity|deities]] of the [[Vodoni pantheon]], led by the [[Crystal King]], also needed to flee the sphere from the impending disaster, but were incapable of doing so while keeping their own power. The pantheon designed a way to escape by entering the [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Eye of the Gods]]'', built by the Crystal King himself, and trusting a mortal to release the deities at an opportune time. However, Vulkaran tricked the deities into trusting him with the key of their release, as part of his plan to keep them trapped for eternity while he consolidated his own power.

After completely colonizing Vodonikaspace, the vodoni set out to recover their lost technological knowledge by conquering and annexing neighboring crystal spheres. This expansion campaign slowly rendered the vodoni more aggressive and warlike, as sphere after sphere came firmly under the control of Vulkaran and his army of [[werewolf|werewolves]].

===The War of the Spheres===
{{Main|War of the Spheres}}
In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Vulkaran set his eyes on three spheres that neighbored the Empire: Greyspace, Krynnspace, and Realmspace. Only vaguely aware of space travel at the time, the spheres seemed like an easy conquest for the Empire. As a prelude to invasion, vodoni spelljammers conducted minor raids throughout the spheres with relative impunity, until an incident with a group of adventurers in Realmspace brought matters to the attention of the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]], as the ''[[Arrow of Justice]]'' escorted the adventurers to the [[Rock of Bral]] for the first war council of the [[Free Space Alliance]].{{Rock of Bral location}}

[[File:War of the spheres-2e.jpg|thumb|250px|''The assault on Vodonispace.'']]
After a reconnaissance mission into Vodonispace, the council decided that, in order to prevent the impending vodoni invasion, a fleet composed of nearly all spacefaring races of the alliance set out to strike Vodonispace, with the adventurers assigned to spearhead the invasion and defeat Vulkaran himself in his palace in the [[Imperial City]] on [[Vulkarus]]. Vulkaran's defeat marked the dissolution of the Empire, freeing the imprisoned pantheon and restoring freedom to the twelve spheres.

The Vodoni Empire was completely dissolved after the war. Although most vodoni enforcer troops were destroyed, it was rumored that some soldiers had survived, in a similar fashion to the humanoids who had survived the [[First Unhuman War]].

==Notable Locations==
The twelve spheres under control of the Empire were the following:
;[[Vodonispace]]: Principal sphere of the Empire and the location of its capital, the [[Imperial City]], located in the planet [[Vulkarus]].
;[[Golotspace]]:
:Inhabited primarily by [[human]]s and [[dragon]]s, with a culture similar to Greyspace.
;[[Gorthspace]]:
:Located in a central location within the Empire's territory, its only habitable planet [[Gorth]] served as a hunting ground and leisure center for Vodoni armies.
;[[Kofuspace]]:
:A strange, solid crystal sphere whose "planets" were bubbles within the shell material, each with its own "star" at the center of the bubble. It was inhabited by [[drow]]-like [[elf|elves]] who did not know the concept of night.
;[[Kra'akenspace]]:
:A sphere entirely filled with breathable air, where large asteroids made of plant matter floated freely, unattached to any gravitational body. It was inhabited by the benevolent [[kra'aken]], or kra', translucent winged humanoids with telepathic abilities and unearthly beauty.
;[[Lostspace]]:
:Totally ravaged by an ancient, all-consuming war, this sphere had no surviving inhabitants, but was intensely researched by vodoni in search of advanced weaponry.
;[[Passarspace]]:
:A system with no central star and bereft of life, its numerous asteroids were explored and mined for their abundant natural resources.
;[[Salzarspace]]:
:One of the first spheres to be annexed by the Empire, it had a small [[:Category:Water bodies|water body]] at its center, surrounded by eight [[:Category:Fire bodies|fiery]] stars that produced small explosions when they collided with one another. Its inhabitants, the immortal [[salzarian]]s, were huge watery spheres immune to all [[magic]]. No magical devices operated within the sphere.
;[[Thasiaspace]]:
:This sphere's only planet, [[Thasia]], was an enormous body inhabited by intelligent entities similar to [[shambling mound]]s. Vulkaran's hold on the system was extremely tenuous and was expected to be challenged when the [[thasian]]s became sufficiently advanced to achieve space travel.
;[[Vergonspace]]:
:This system's six planets' human inhabitants were at a constant state of war with each other, a situation that was maintained by Vulkaran in order to ensure the system's weakness. After the dissolution of the Empire and the end of the internal wars, it was expected that the warlike inhabitants would unite and pose a new threat to known space within one century.
;[[Vodonikaspace]]:
:The closest sphere to Vodonispace, it was the destination of their exodus. After wiping out the original inhabitants, the vodoni colonized the sphere and turned it into a replica of the original Vodonispace, as diversely populated as the spheres of the [[Free Space Alliance]].
;[[Zalanispace]]:
:This was inhabited by the peaceful, yet terrifying [[zalani]], humanoids that resembled [[gargoyle]]s and had an alien taste for art and beauty. It was the location of all the Empire's shipyards.
