        "Haunted Lands": "{{Main|Haunted Lands}}\nThe Haunted Lands were the larger of Zakhara's two great deserts. In the 14{{th}} century DR{{AQ-time}} they were sparsely populated by small tribes raising livestock and raiding trade caravans and each other. They had a rich history of fallen petty kingdoms.",

            "Hiyal": "{{Main|Hiyal}}\nThe great and dirty City of Intrigue, near the mouth of [[Al-Wahl River]], was a center for the production of metals and weapons. Its population had a reputation for underhanded dealings.",
            "Huzuz": "{{Main|Huzuz}}\nThe City of Delights, Gem of Zakhara, located at the banks of [[Al-Sarif River]], was the \"heart of the heart\" of the Land of Fate: It held the center of political power in the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne|seat]] of the [[Grand Caliph]], the nexus of trade in the [[Grand Bazaar]], and the most important goal for pilgrims, the [[Golden Mosque]]. Golden Huzuz was famed for its sparkling roofs and cosmopolitan population.<ref>",
            "Wasat": "{{Main|Wasat}}\nThe Middle City, near the mouth of [[Al-Qalil River]], was a rather quiet way-station for travelers between its larger sister cities. Its inhabitants were known for their even disposition.<ref>"

            "Fahhas": "{{Main|Fahhas}}\nThe City of Searching, at the mouth of [[Al-Naqus River]], was prosperous in agricultural production of the surrounding farmlands, but its people were downcast and somber, and always questing for deeper enlightenment.<ref>",

            "Hudid": "{{Main|Hudid}}\nThe City of Humility, at the mouth of [[Al-Jana River]], was famed for its trade in exotic goods, achievements in science and technology, and the largest university in all of Zakhara.<ref>",
            "I'tiraf": "{{Main|I'tiraf}}\nThe City of Confessions, at the mouth of [[Al-Hadi River]], functioned as the Capital of the League of the Pantheon. It strictly followed [[moralist]] teachings of the Pantheon and also enforced them in visitors.<ref>",
            "Mahabba": "{{Main|Mahabba}}\nThe City of Charity, at the mouth of [[Al-Munamma River]], was dominated by the struggle between its strict Caliph and the League's military force against the followers of [[Bala]], fighting from the shadows, leading to an oppressed and xenophobic atmosphere.<ref>",
            "Talab": "{{Main|Talab}}\nThe City of Questing, at the source of Al-Muti River, was a meeting point between the Cities of the Pantheon and the surrounding wilder parts of Zakhara, and featured a major university.
