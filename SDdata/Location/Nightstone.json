        "mainbody": "'''Nightstone''' was a fortified settlement located near the [[Ardeep Forest]], in the hills between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Daggerford]]. It was connected to the [[High Road]] via a side trail.",
        "Geography": "Nightstone was located a few miles south of the Ardeep Forest.",
        "History": "Over the years, the villagers of Nightstone had bad relationships with the [[wood elf|wood elves]] who inhabited the Ardeep Forest, owing to Lord [[Drezlin Nandar]]'s hunting. This eventually culminated in an attack on the village, wherein Lord Drezlin and half of the villagers died. His widow, [[Velrosa Nandar]], negotiated peace with the wood elves and spent years maintaining that peace by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nSometime after [[1485 DR]], the village was bombarded with large rocks by a [[cloud giant]] [[cloud palace|floating castle]]. Many of the inhabitants were crushed, but those who survived fled north into the nearby hills intending to hide in some caves. Unfortunately for the fleeing villagers, the caves were being claimed by a clan of [[goblins]] and a pair of [[ogres]], who captured and ate them. Meanwhile, the cloud giants descended on Nightstone and removed the village's obelisk, believing it to be an artifact of the ancient [[giant]] civilization of [[Ostoria]]. After removing the obelisk, the cloud giants had no interest in the town or its inhabitants and so drifted off the way they came. The now-abandoned town was subsequently ransacked by the goblins and left to ruin.",
        "Notable Locations": "Its name derived from a mysterious [[obsidian]] [[black obelisk|obelisk]] in the center of the village that had strange glyphs carved into it and emanated a magic aura.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "Lady Velrosa Nandar\n\nGuards\n\n* Sydiri Haunlar\n* Torem Breck\n* Alara Winterspell\n* Kaelen Zam\n\nAgganor Family\n\n* Destiny Agganor\n* Grin Agganor\n\nDelfryndel Family\n\n* Renarra\n* Olaf\n* Zalf\n* Elize\n* Darson\n* Hildy\n\nHulvaarn Family\n\n* Nestor\n* Godrick\n* Prennis\n* Jehanna\n* Ellis\n* Ghalt\n\nNesper Family\n\n* Yondra\n* Sarvin\n* Syldra\n\nOsstra Family\n\n* Thelbin\n* Brynn\n* Broland\n\nSummerhawk Family\n\n* Taela\n* Larlow\n* Barley\n* Midge\n* Nincy\n* Dollop"
