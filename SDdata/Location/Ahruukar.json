        "Geography": "The realm lay deep below the [[Thesk Mountains]], near [[Thesk]].",
        "Relations": "The dwarves of Ruuk lacked the arrogance that was often seen in gold dwarves, and were quite cosmopolitan and worldly. They had a strategic and philosophical attitude with the wider world, and sought to manipulate the [[Realms]] into engaging in energetic trading and prosperity, and avoiding raiding and war. Despite this pacifistic and intellectual bent, the dwarves were fearless in battle even against [[dragon]]s.",
        "Trade": "As of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the realm mined and worked [[iron]] and [[hematite]] from the mountains, as well as great riches of [[sapphire]]s, [[citrine]]s, [[peridot]]s, and [[spinel]]s. They traded with the wider world at [[Phsant]]."
