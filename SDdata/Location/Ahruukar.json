        "mainbody": "Ahruukar () was a small realm of gold dwarves in east Faer√ªn. It was home to the Ruuk clan of dwarves.\nThe realm lay deep below the Thesk Mountains, near Thesk.\nThe dwarves of Ruuk lacked the arrogance that was often seen in gold dwarves, and were quite cosmopolitan and worldly. They had a strategic and philosophical attitude with the wider world, and sought to manipulate the Realms into engaging in energetic trading and prosperity, and avoiding raiding and war. Despite this pacifistic and intellectual bent, the dwarves were fearless in battle even against dragons.\nAs of the 15 century DR, the realm mined and worked iron and hematite from the mountains, as well as great riches of sapphires, citrines, peridots, and spinels. They traded with the wider world at Phsant."
