Arandron was a continent a long distance to the southwest of Faer√ªn.
Around the 8 century DR, there was a bustling port city on Arandron called Haunvaerune, inhabited by humans. Ships such as Captain Imbryn Ultals Aelusteen sailed between Haunvaerune and Lantan to trade in Lantanna inventions.
Behind the city was a high, bare rocky ridge upon which stood Steelspires, a castle constructed by stone giants for the steel dragons Malavauvrantarandra and Phaudrantanthildrar.
