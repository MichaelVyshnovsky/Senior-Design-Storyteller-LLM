'''Trashtide Alley''' was an alley located in [[Skullport]].

==Description==
Trashtide Alley was one of the few alleyways in Skullport with a name. It was notorious for the large numbers of both [[Giant rat|giant]] and normal [[rat]]s that gathered to feed on the refuse from nearby establishments such as the [[Burning Troll]] tavern, [[Findlewulf's Galley]], and the [[Drowning Buoy]]. The scavenging rats were largely fearless, paying little attention to those who passed through the alley. However, it was widely believed that a family of [[wererat]]s has established residence in the vicinity, driving off or infecting intruders who ventured too close.
