        "mainbody": "lpuk, also called the Central Basin, was the largest of the three regions of the Great Glacier and the home of the Iulutiun people.\nThe Great Glacier was naturally divided into three regions. The largest region was Alpuk, located in the southwest and bordered by the Uppuk River in the north, the Tuutsaas Chain in the west, the Lugsaas Chain in the south, and the Keryjek Ridge in the east. The region of Angalpuk was to the east, and Nakvaligach to the north.\nAlpuk encompassed the two largest seas in the Great Glacier, the Nakalpgotak and the Lugalpgotak.

The strange creatures known as \"walrus dogs\", or kupuk, lived wild in Alpuk and were often tamed by the Ulutiuns.\nTwo monsters lived in Alpuk that caused fear among its people&mdashwhite dragons and the bizarre centipede-like tirichik.\nVery little vegetation grew in Alpuk. A few exceptions were mikka, a mint-flavored, black lichen growing near streams, and seal berries, found on the shore of the Lugalpgotak Sea.\nAlpuk was first settled by humans in  by hunters and explorers from Sossal, who were ambushed by a tirichik and then lost.
