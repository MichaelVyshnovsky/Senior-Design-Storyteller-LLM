        "Geography": "The Great Glacier was naturally divided into three regions. The largest region was Alpuk, located in the southwest and bordered by the [[Uppuk River]] in the north, the [[Tuutsaas Chain]] in the west, the [[Lugsaas Chain]] in the south, and the [[Keryjek Ridge]] in the east. The region of [[Angalpuk]] was to the east, and [[Nakvaligach]] to the north.\n\nAlpuk encompassed the two largest seas in the Great Glacier, the [[Nakalpgotak Sea|Nakalpgotak]] and the [[Lugalpgotak Sea|Lugalpgotak]]. The mysterious mountainous region known as [[Novularond]], home of [[frost giant]]s and [[Arctic dwarf|arctic dwarves]], was also within its borders.\n\nMost of the land was at a low elevation, but the ground was rough and occasionally contained rolling hills.",

        "Flora & Fauna": "Wild [[caribou]] herds lived in the hills and mountains of Alpuk, though not nearly in the large numbers seen east in Angalpuk. The strange creatures known as \"walrus dogs\", or [[kupuk]], lived wild in Alpuk and were often tamed by the [[Ulutiun]]s.\n\nTwo monsters lived in Alpuk that caused fear among its people&mdash;[[white dragon]]s and the bizarre centipede-like [[tirichik]].\n\nVery little vegetation grew in Alpuk. A few exceptions were [[mikka]], a mint-flavored, black lichen growing near streams, and [[Seal berry|seal berries]], found on the shore of the Lugalpgotak Sea.",
        "History": "Alpuk was first settled by [[human]]s in {{Yearlink|-1648}} by hunters and explorers from [[Sossal]], who were ambushed by a tirichik and then lost. They eventually found their way to the Lugalpgotak Sea and settled around its shores.",

        "Inhabitants": "The primary inhabitants of Alpuk were the Iulutiun tribes, descendents of the first settlers from Sossal.\n\nArctic dwarves, known as ''Innugaakalikurit'', and frost giants also lived in Alpuk.",
