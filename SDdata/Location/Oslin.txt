'''Oslin''' was a small trading village in [[Chessenta]].

==Location==
It lay at the southeastern tip of the [[Akanamere]], betwixt the [[Akanul]] farming land and the [[Hills of Maerth]]. From Oslin, trails led west to [[Villon]], south to [[Saden]], and northeast around the lake-shore to [[Maerduuth]].

==History==
Oslin had stood as early as the 4{{th}} century [[DR]].

In the 10{{th}} century DR, the mighty [[archmage]] [[Ultham|Ultham, son of Urrekanam]], who kept a tower in the Hills of Maerth, had a great love of Oslin and enjoyed playing [[chess (game)|chess]] with the village elders for hours on end. However, some time during the reign of King [[Tchazzar]] ([[929 DR|929]]–[[1018 DR]]), Ultham appears to have anticipated Chessenta's swift collapse and incessant warring, and created the ''[[Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre]]'' to defend Oslin before he journeyed into the [[planes]]. Meanwhile, the ''Chessmen'' were just used as simple chess pieces.

Then, several years later, the lord of Maerduuth (at the time a large city) desired to annex Oslin and sent an expeditionary force, thinking it defenseless, with the ordinary farmers, fishers, and traders there unable to muster a capable militia and or hire mercenaries. Yet the good people of Oslin used the ''Chessmen'' to transform themselves into a company of strong soldiers, supported by potent mages and priests, that routed the Maerduuth force. A second expeditionary force didn't come back at all. Thereafter, the lord of Maerduuth and the neighboring powers elected to just ignore Oslin altogether.

Curiously, several decades later, a well-defended caravan transporting a fortune in [[gem]]s from [[Unthalass]] to [[Akanax]] disappeared between Oslin and Maerduuth. The lone survivor reported they'd been ambushed by a company of glittering, armored knights—most likely the ''Chessmen'' again—and investigators found Oslin emptied of half its population overnight. They, the gems, and the ''Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre'' were not seen again.

==Government==
Oslin was a subject of [[Akanax]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Defenses==
Once defended by the ''Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre'' creating a magical militia of its people, Oslin thereafter needed to hire mercenary companies to protect the village. One such mercenary company, the [[Lords of the Inner Reach]], were based in Oslin around 1357 DR. They were hired by local farmers to push rivals off their lands so they could claim them.
