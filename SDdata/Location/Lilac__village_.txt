Lilac was the home of lacerials who resided in the jungles of the Malatran Plateau. The name was inspired by the lilac scent lacerials emitted when feeling longing for home.
Lilac was a busy village, well-hidden by the jungle vegetation. The village population included all four species of lacerials finheads, bladebacks, hornheads, and flyers, who lived along with a smaller population of yuan-ti. These snake folk considered lacerials their "cousins" and showed them and their peaceful way great respect. In general, Lilacs doors were closed to outsiders. However, the village was always ready to answer pleas for help from goodly creatures.
Most structures of Lilac were simple huts of various sizes. Each of the species of lacerials preferred slightly different homes. Fliers liked to nest in open-sided homes elevated from  to  above ground. Fliers liked to build light shelters as they felt uncomfortable with heavy construction above their heads. Oftentimes their homes were in dire need of repair after every storm. Bladebacks and finheads resided in the most traditional huts, usually consisting of a single huge room with decorated walls. The biggest huts usually belonged to hornheads as they were the biggest of their kind. Their homes tended to have one wall missing and often had gated backyards around their abodes.
Lilac stood on the downriver shores of the River of Laughing Idols.
Lilac was ruled by the council of the village elders.
Lacerials of Lilac faced a fair share of xenophobia from their neighboring community of Rudra. On the other side of the political spectrum were the yuan-ti of Malatra, with whom Lilac engaged in mutually beneficial trade. If aggression with Rudra reached the boiling point, yuan-ti were sure to aid lacerials. Along with the yuan-ti, Lilac traded with hyena katanga folk.
Every night, the entire population of Lilac participated in the ritual known as the Moment of Remembrance. Lacerials lowered themselves on one knee with hands over their hearts and prayed to the southern sky. This ritual filled the air of Lilac with scents of roses, lilacs, and ozone - these smells signified sadness, longing for home, and despair in Lacerial scent language. The Moment of Remembrance was the ritual of grieving for lacerials lost homeworld.
The conflict with the village of Rudra that took place in the 14 century DR was caused by the lacerials of Lilac "tearing out" vanilla plants from the grove that held significance in the eyes of both towns of Lilac and Rudra. In reality, lacerials carefully and lovingly transplanted two dozens of vanilla plants. Lacerials were in decline and produced no eggs after their arrival to Malatra, and they were hoping to use vanilla plants as a part of a powerful fertility spell to stop their race from eventual extinction. As another way of resolving the stranding in the alien world, lacerials searched for a way to repair an oscray skyship - a spelljammer.
