'''Tarsith''' was a port city and a member of the confederation of the [[Dusk Ports]] in [[Laerakond]]. It was also one of the most important fishing cities in the region.

==Geography==
Tarsith was located in the [[Esmur Flats]], in the shore of the [[River Esmur]] near the mouth where the river flowed to the [[Dragon Sea (Abeir)|Dragon Sea]].

==Background==
Tarsith was the most calm and peaceful city of the Dusk Ports. However, this situation wasn't always the same, and usually the population had to endure hard times when the [[green dragon]] [[Orlarrakh]] invited a fellow from [[Melabrauth]] to eat.

Aside from foodstuffs, Tarsith also boasted the finest [[rope]]s and sails in all Laerakond, although such products were not for sale.

==Government==
Tarsith was ruled by a Tarsandar, a [[wizard]] who received his or her scepter from the Green Duchess herself.

==Economy==
Due to its location in the River Esmur, Tarsith was known as the busiest fishing center of Laerakond. Most of the [[eel]]s and [[clam]]s were consumed locally, but the [[rock crab]]s and fish were Tarsith's major exports.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Rhauron]], a notorious individual who lived in Tarsith in the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]].{{Cite dungeon/193/The Winking Eyes of Rhauron|69}}
