        "mainbody": "The '''Manor Gate''' was a landmark gate in the old wall within the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was located in the region of the wall that separated the [[Upper City]] district of [[Manorborn]] from the [[Lower City]] district of [[Bloomridge]].\n\nIt was one of the city's four, generally smaller, \"[[patriar]] gates\" that connected the poorer Lower City to the Upper City region. These entrances were constructed using private funds and were only accessible to select individuals. Generally speaking, only the city's wealthy noble patriar, those individuals bearing their livery, or certain powerful criminal individuals could pass through the Manor Gate."
