        "mainbody": "he Manor Gate was a landmark gate in the old wall within the city of Baldurs Gate. It was located in the region of the wall that separated the Upper City district of Manorborn from the Lower City district of Bloomridge.\nIt was one of the citys four, generally smaller, \"patriar gates\" that connected the poorer Lower City to the Upper City region. These entrances were constructed using private funds and were only accessible to select individuals. Generally speaking, only the citys wealthy noble patriar, those individuals bearing their livery, or certain powerful criminal individuals could pass through the Manor Gate."
