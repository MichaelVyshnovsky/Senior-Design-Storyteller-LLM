Here there were rich natural clay pits along the banks of the River Shining.\nCirca 1365 DR, around 120 people lived here, largely quiet farm-folk and including a dozen or so aged crafts-folk.\nThe people of Zelbross had a thick and unusual accent, enough that the words \"hark\" and \"hawk\" sounded nearly the same. This was posited as a possible cause of the varying name of the Dungeon of the Hark and its rulers.\nZelbrosss potters produced all kinds of pottery of excellent quality. Traveling merchants and peddlers came through and bought all they could for resale elsewhere.\nIn particular, Zelbross was famed for its clay smoking pipes. These were baked iron-hard and had a mottled, tortoise-shell finish. They could be found all over Faerûn. While they were sold locally for 5 sp each, in Waterdeep the price rose to 1 gp each and all smoking nobles there owned at least one.\nZelbross was considered a very old settlement by the mid–14 century DR, and possibly was established here because of the rich clay that could be found in the vicinity.\nBy 1479 DR, Zelbross lay in ruins.\n* The Last Place, an inn\n* The Sly Fox, a tavern"
