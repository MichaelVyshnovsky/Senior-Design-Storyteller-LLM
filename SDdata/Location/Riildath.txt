'''The Riildath''' was a large forest in [[northeast Faer没n]] and [[east Faer没n]].

==History==
Clan [[Sethomiir]] [[dark elf|dark elves]] migrated to the Riildath in {{Yearlink|-10400}} and established [[Narathmault]]. When the dark elves became [[drow]] in {{Yearlink|-10000}}, [[fiend]]s escaped Narathmault and the drow fled to caverns beneath the [[Thayan Plateau]].

[[Sun elf]] and [[moon elf]] refugees from [[Shantel Othreier]] arrived in {{Yearlink|-9750}} and established the realm of [[Lethyr]], vowing to cleanse the Riildath of non-elves and the horrors of Narathmault.

In {{Yearlink|-1020}}, the elves of Lethyr abandoned the northern portion of the Riildath and an arm of the Great Glacier began scouring the valley of the [[Great Dale]], splitting the forest into the [[Dunwood|Rawlinswood]] and the [[Forest of Lethyr]]. [[Tharos]], a chieftain of the Nars, discovered the ruins of Narathmault in {{Yearlink|-1015}}. His son, [[Thargaum]], established the kingdom of Tharos in {{Yearlink|-987}}, and as its first [[Nentyarch]], built its capital, [[Dun-Tharos]], at the site in {{Yearlink|-970}}.

==Notable Locations==
* Narathmault
* Dun-Tharos

==Inhabitants==

* Drow
* Fiends
* Sun Elves
* Moon Elves
* Nars (humans)
