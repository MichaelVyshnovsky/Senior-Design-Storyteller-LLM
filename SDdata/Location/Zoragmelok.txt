Zoragmelok was the capital city of Hollows Heart and the personal fortress and lair of the demon prince Fraz-Urbluu.
Zoragmelok was a sprawling, roughly circular city of impossible architecture, full of corkscrew towers, looming domes, and colossal amphitheaters. At its center was a massive fortress that constantly changed according its owners whim this was Fraz-Urbluus personal palace that he shared only with his many consorts.
The walls of Zoragmelok were towering creations of adamantine covered in hooks and razors, upon which countless humans hung, kept barely alive by a small army of harpy clerics that applied food, water, and healing as needed to prolong their suffering. Occasionally, a victim would escape the wall and vanish into the nearby Scarwood.
Zoragmelok was located on the 176 layer of the Abyss, Hollows Heart. It was situated by a river mouth, on the eastern shore of the Hollow Sea.
Zoragmelok was one of the many places Fraz-Urbluu created out of the layer when he returned from his centuries-long exile on the Material world of Oerth.
Fraz-Urbluu was the lord and sole ruler of Zoragmelok. Besides himself, the place was inhabited only by his dozens of succubi consorts, who prowled the halls of his fortress, and tens of thousands of the deceived.
The Deceived were human petitioners who had been sacrificed to Fraz-Urbluu by his cult. Denied their rightful afterlives, each Deceived lived alone in a section of the city that was reshaped by illusion to be their ideal afterlife, populated by neighbors, friends, and family. Slowly, however, Fraz-Urbluu would strip away these illusions, reveling in the despair caused by their realization of the truth, before the demon prince finally devoured them.
