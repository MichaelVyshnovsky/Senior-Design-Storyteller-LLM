However, at that time, a shadow priest came and began raising an undead army. Fortunately, he was stopped by the Kalach-Cha.\nIn the area around the castle at the time, the adventurers Alex and Andrew, as well as William (who ran away from his wife), were threatened by wolves. The Kalach-Cha could rescue them."
