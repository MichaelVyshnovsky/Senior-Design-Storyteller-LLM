        "mainbody": "'''Chunming''' was a city in [[Shou Lung]] and one of the largest [[spelljammer|spelljamming]] ports of [[Toril]], second only to [[the Dock]].",
        "Government": "The Chunming government established that approaching spelljammers must fly over the city before docking in the ocean or directly into the spaceport's drydocks. No spelljammer was allowed to approach by sea, as an effort to ensure that sailing ships and spelljammers remained in different tax brackets. Since spelljammers also recharged their air, a surcharge of one [[fen]] per ship's ton was added to their docking tax.",
        "Trade": "The city only accepted Shou Lung [[currency]], which made it necessary for all crews to exchange their money before paying their docking taxes and engaging in businesses. Exchange stations were abundant among the docks, charging a fee of 5% per conversion. In addition, no Shou Lung currency was permitted to be removed from the premises, so all crews had to exchange their remaining money before departure, at the risk of being chased by the patrolling [[dragonship]]s.\n\nThe spaceport imported mostly exotic food and [[spices]] from other [[crystal sphere]]s, as well as [[magic item]]s and [[alchemist]] recipes. There was always interest in hiring [[mage]]s and [[cleric]]s to work for the Shou Lung empire.\n\nMost prominent among the city's exports was its handicraft, in particular its figurines made of [[jade]] that came in many colors. Other top sellers included ''[[smokepowder]]'' and arcane supplies such as [[scroll]]s and [[potion]]s, which were known for their reliability and ease of use.",
        "Inhabitants": "The local population welcomed spelljamming crews and viewed them with respect and a measure of envy.\n\nOne of the spaceport's guards was the [[kensai]] [[An Ching Wang]], who was approachable and willing to share information that was not considered secret by the government. She followed her betrothed [[Yu Fu Tieh]] to Chunming soon after her father was injured, where she became one of the first women to serve in the Emperor's guard."
