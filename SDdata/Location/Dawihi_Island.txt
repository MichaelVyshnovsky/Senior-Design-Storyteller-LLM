}}'''Dawihi Island''' was a small island found in the [[Crowded Sea]] in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region in [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Geography==
The island sat roughly {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} offshore of mainland east Zakhara with the northern part of the island laying near [[Rog'osto]].

==Description==
Open grasslands dominated the relatively flat surface of Dawihi Island. The crumbling towers dotting the coastline and countryside, which were similar to the famed metal towers of Rog'osto, served as nesting grounds for birds.

==Inhabitants==
Aside from the town of [[Sagat]] and other small merchant villages, the island was mostly populated by seabirds and raptors of various kinds.

Violent monsoons were a constant danger the island's inhabitants faced every summer. The storms often claimed the smaller settlements found along the coast.

==History==
The strange towers decorating the island were actually the remnants of a [[locathah]] civilization that was once underwater. The locathah met their end at war with un unknown air-breathing race that summoned a powerful elemental power that banished the creatures and raised their civilization above the water.

==Rumors & Legends==
A mysterious avian queen was said to rule the birds calling Dawihi Island home.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Sagat]]
