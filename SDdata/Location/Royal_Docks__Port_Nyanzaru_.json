        "Description": "The Royal Docks were only used by the merchant princes or those whom they wished to impress, generally meaning foreign dignitaries, ambassadors, or other powerful merchants.\n\nThe name \"Royal Docks\" was derived from a time when Chult had been ruled by literal kings and queens as opposed to Merchant Princes.",
        "Geography": "The Royal Docks were located at one end of the harbor, separated from the public docks by the drydocks and [[Port Nyanzaru/Warehouse District|Warehouse District]].<ref group=\"note\">While the map of Port Nyzanzaru provided with the ''[[Tomb of Annihilation]]'' adventure places the Royal Docks on the western end of the Harbor Ward, they are described in the text as being on the eastern end."
