        "mainbody": "'''At'ar's Looking Glass''' was a sweltering and uniquely hazardous stretch of desert in [[Anauroch]].",
        "Description": "The region was  composed of what appeared to be a flat \"sea\" of small, multi-color polished stones that absorbed more heat from the sun than any other surface in the desert. It was so intensely hot that even [[camel]]s had great difficulty traversing its surface without harming the pads of their feet. Any creature that collapsed upon At'ar's Looking Glass would literally be roasted atop the pebbled desert floor.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The three borders of At'ar's Looking Glass not adjacent to the mountains were marked by low-cresting sand dunes."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "The region was named after [[At'ar|At'ar the Merciless]], the [[Bedine]] goddess of the sun. According to Bedine legend, the god [[Kozah]] wielded the wind to keep it clear of all debris in order for At'ar to admire herself in the reflective pebbles that formed what thus referred to as her looking glass."
