        "mainbody": "Black Mound was an exclusive neighborhood in the city of Evernight in the Shadowfell.\nThe neighborhood lay in the southwestern corner of the city atop a small hill&mdashalso known as the Black Mound&mdashthat overlooked the lava that flowed into the sea. The steam that arose from the hot lava meeting the water would occasionally cause a cloud of fog and mist to settle over the area.\nBlack Mound was the site of houses and manors that were much larger than buildings in other parts of the city. While sometimes opulent,  they were just as filthy and decrepit as the rest of Evernight.\n* The House of Screams, a large and old manor that was the closest thing to a courthouse in Evernight.\nBlack Mound was home to some of Evernights most powerful undead (mostly intelligent ghouls), including its ruling Tribunal. The residents were accustomed to getting their way in disputes with inhabitants of other parts of Evernight.\nAny lesser undead or visitors to the city were liable to be stopped for questioning if they lingered in Black Mound."
