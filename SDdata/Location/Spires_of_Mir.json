        "mainbody": "The Spires of Mir were a wasteland of strange stone spires located in southern Tethyr, just north of the Marching Mountains.  \nPrior to the Spellplague, the spires were part of the Forest of Mir, but the plague changed the trees into huge stone spires. Not only was the landscape warped by the Spellplague, but so too were the creatures that roamed the land, which were transformed into dangerous beasts. The only settlement of note within the spires was Argentor, which was inhabited by Earthsoul genasi."
