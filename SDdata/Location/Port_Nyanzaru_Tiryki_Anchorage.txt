'''Tiryki Anchorage''' ({{Pronounce|tee|REE|kee|refs=}}) was a ward of the [[Chult]]an city of [[Port Nyanzaru]] located on the southeast side of the city, outside of its walls. It was considered a slum, and was home to the city's animal-handlers, river folk, and [[smuggler]]s.

==Geography==
The anchorage sat at the mouth of the [[River Tiryki]], hence its name.

==Description==
Tiryki Anchorage hugged the outside of eastern walls of Port Nyanzaru and extended south where it turned into the pens for the city's [[dinosaur]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|6}} The northern and eastern parts of Tiryki Anchorage featured the docks.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|4}} and the odor of dinosaur [[manure]], wet fur, and tanned hides stretched all the way from the dinosaur pens to the walls of the city.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|12}}

Buildings in Tiryki Anchorage were largely shanties and hovels made of weathered wood and stone,{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|41}} and some taller structures.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|5}} and sometimes very seedy. The district further boasted a large number of [[tavern]]s, especially around its ramshackle harbor.

==Trade==
Much of Port Nyanzaru's trade in [[beast]]s&mdash;notably dinosaurs&mdash;occured in Tiryki Anchorage, as did the training of said beasts.

The docks of Tiryki Anchorage were virtually unregulated and unpatrolled compared to those of the city's [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]], and so were quite popular&mdash;especially among smugglers&mdash;despite the relative lack of resources to help with loading or unloading ships.

Lodging and accommodations were cheaper in Tiryki Anchorage than in most other parts of Port Nyanzaru, and so were popular among visiting explorers. 

==Defenses==
Because it lay outside of Port Nyanzaru's defensive walls, the people of Tiryki Anchorage relied on the volunteer [[Citizens' Brigade]] to keep them safe. In case of attack, a [[horn]] was sounded to usher the inhabitants to safety and the residents could rely on the keen senses of the many penned beasts in the district to detect invaders. However, unlike Port Nyanzaru's other slum districts, the Anchorage had no safe havens in which to hide (such as the stone ziggurats of the [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]] or the [[Temple of Tymora (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple of Tymora]] in [[Malar's Throat]]), and so their only recourse was to flee to through [[Tiryki Gate]] before it was locked. 

==Notable Locations==
:;[[Dinosaur Pens]]: The paddocks to the south were where the city's beasts of burden and [[dinosaur races|racing dinosaurs]] alike were trained and housed at night. The air was filled with the throaty calls of the huge beasts alongside the general noises and stenches of ranching.
:;Docks: The docks of the anchorage were much less regulated than those located in the Harbor Ward. There was no [[lighthouse]] to help guide ships safely into port.
:;[[Serpent's Coil]]: This smugglers' tunnel could be accessed via a grate in the west end of the docks, and led into Port Nyanzaru proper.
:;[[Tiryki Gate]]: The main access point into the city, connecting the Anchorage to the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]].

==Inhabitants==
Tiryki Anchorage was home to some of Port Nyanzaru's poorer residents, including animal-handlers and river folk, along with the more rowdy individuals such as smugglers, [[adventurer]]s, and explorers.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Jailo Mek]], a smuggler and dinosaur handler.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|29}}

==History==
During the colonial rule of [[Amn]] over Port Nyanzaru, the Old City was among the districts where people had to live if they did not work for a major trading company.<ref name=FRCG-p102>

During the events of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]],{{ToA-time}} Tiryki Anchorage was briefly overrun by the forces of the [[devil|infernal]] pirate captain [[Idrianne Smoke]].{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|4}}{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|24}}
