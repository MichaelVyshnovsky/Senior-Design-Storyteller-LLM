The Trollclaws was a region of troll-infested hills along the Sword Coast.
The Trollclaws lay along the northern edge of the Fields of the Dead. Both the Winding Water and the Coast Way ran through the area.
The region often seemed shrouded in mist, and was characterized by steep, grassy hills, and dense foliage.
Many caravans and other travelers passed through the Trollclaws by virtue of the Coast Way passing through the region.
Exactly why trolls seemed to thrive in the area was unknown, fueling conversation around many a campfire. At any rate, travelers were advised to avoid the Trollclaws if at all possible.
* Trollclaw Ford a ford where the Coast Way crossed the Winding Water. Several attempts were made to settle near the ford, but all ended in ruin.
* The legendary Eye Tyrant Xroon maintained a lair in the northern Trollclaws, where he left an ithrim for other beholders to compete over through the Vellurith game.
The Trollclaws were home to a seemingly inexhaustible population of trolls. Repeated attempts by mercenaries and adventuring bands to clear the area seemed to have little effect.
