'''Tchinggult''' was a large town found in northwestern [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Geography==
Tchinggult was located along the banks of the [[River Tching]] in the lowlands between the [[Sanrach Mountains]] and [[Tching Mountains]].

==History==
Tchinggult was once a prominent waystop along the road from [[Narubel]] to [[Thindar]]. The settlement fell into a state of disrepair when trade diminished. A [[chaos roc]] began hunting in the area around the same time, compounding Tchinggult's problems.

==Inhabitants==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Tchinggult was home to outlaws and small bands of [[lizardfolk]]. Gangs of criminals vied for control on of the streets, leading to nightly bloodshed.

==Activities==
Several small markets operated during the day. Items that were illegal elsewhere in Thindol could be found here.
