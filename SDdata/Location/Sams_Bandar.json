        "mainbody": "ams Bandar was the largest settlement located on Jazirat al-Qraidis within Jazayir al-Sartan.\nSams Bandar could summon a militia force of 15 armed men during a crisis.\nThe villagers of Sams Bandar were particularly suspicious of a lagoon called Batihat al-Saji which was located on the other side of the island. Most believed those waters to be haunted, though the nature of what was haunting them depended on the villager asked.\nThis small village was \"ruled\" by Najib al-Samsi, an aging fisherman. He would meet weekly with the local court to settle disputes and catch up on general gossip."
