        "mainbody": "Ruathym (\nRuathym was located more than  north of the Moonshae Isles.\nIt was a rocky island with rugged coasts, narrow coves, green hills, forested purple mountains, and a few villages.\nSome time around , the Sailors of the Mountainous Waves, the navy of the dwarf realm of Haunghdannar, built a stone fortress they named Sonnmorndin on the island, which was originally called Arauwurbarak.\nIn the , the Tome of the Unicorn was reported to be in the possession of the monarchy of Ruathym. It was stored in the Green Rooms.\nThe Tome of the Unicorn was stolen by a Calishite mage called Shond Tharovin in the . Ignorant of the true culprit, the last foreign ship to leave the island—Telgontan Horn, a caravel from Luskan—was attacked and sunk. In response, Luskan declared war on Ruathym. The Luskanites destroyed Ruathyms fleet and landed troops on the island. With help from the Holgerstead tribe, First Axe Ulphron Lithyls forces managed to drive the Luskanites back into the sea after a few months of warfare.\nHowever, Luskan attacked again the following year. This time they were much more successful, managing to conquer the entire realm save for scattered pockets of resistance. In Uktar of the , Aumark Lithyl, Ulphrons son and a member of the famous Knights of Myth Drannor, returned home. After his father died in battle just before the winter storms set in, he managed to unite the four tribes of Ruathym under his banner.\nIn Kythorn of the , the Lords Alliance threatened war against both sides unless they came to an accord. Realizing that Luskan and the Northlander island realms had more in common than any other coastal city, Ruathym, Luskan, the Whalebones, and Tuern declared an alliance called the Captains Confederation (also known as the Captains Alliance) the following summer and began raiding shipping and coastal settlements up and down the Sword Coast in concert.\nDuring the Time of Troubles that year, avatars of Labelas Enoreth and Clangeddin Silverbeard battled on Ruathym. After the destructive battle, plantmen appeared in the streets, attacking residents and the crew of the Realms Master. Although the crew managed to escape thanks to the intervention of Labelas, many of the islands inhabitants died to the creatures onslaught.\nIn the , the Captains Confederation was dissolved when Luskan attempted to conquer Ruathym a second time. Luskan, with the help of the Kraken Society, began a conspiracy (mainly involving pickled sea elves placed in Ruathen casks) intended to provoke Waterdeep and the Lords Alliance against Ruathym, but the conspiracy was discovered by Liriel Baenre. The attacking Luskan navy, led by High Captain Rethnor, and a merrow army led by Vestress of the Kraken Society, was defeated by the Ruathen with her help. The mind flayer Vestress, self-proclaimed Regent of Ascarle, sent a merrow army against Ruathym but the Northmen managed to repel them. Threatened with war by Waterdeep, Luskan withdrew its forces.\nA third war was instigated between Luskan and Ruathym when Black Garius sent men to steal the Tome of Iltkazar from the Green Rooms in 1374 DR.\n* Holgerstead Known for its berserker warriors. Until Aumark Lithyl united the tribes, Holgerstead was ruled by First Axe Wedigar Ruthmaald.\n* Hastor A village led by First Axe Glammad in 1361 DR.\n* Inthar (also Ithnar) A ruined fortress located  south of Rethgaard. It was avoided by all sailors who knew of it due to strange phenomenon that occurred there at night, and because of a legend it housed an entrance to Baator.\n* Rethgaard An ancient dwarven naval fortress that still stood nearly 6,000 years after it was originally built.Both being stone fortresses built by ancient seafaring dwarves on Ruathym, it is presumed that Sonnmorndin and Rethgaard are the same.\n* Ruathym The name of the largest settlement was confusingly named after the island itself. A town of about 5,000 inhabitants in the mid-to-late 1300s DR, this was the seat of Aumark Lithyl and his descendants after the Luskan/Ruathym war. The famous Green Rooms library of magical books was located here. It was also home to the Hall of Black Waves, a temple to Umberlee.\n* Yggdrasils Child A tree of incredible power that grew from a seed of the World Tree Yggdrasil.  Individuals who carved their name on the tree would grow in power as the tree grew.\nThe people of Ruathym were known as the Ruathen or the Northmen. They were generally tall and fair with light blue eyes. Ruathen women wore crude jewelry, fabric boots, and brightly colored embroidered cloth.\nThe dead were cremated in large funeral bonfires that escorted them on their way to the Halls of Tempus.\nThe people here spoke Ruathen, which was a dialect of Illuskan, although most spoke Common. Dock-alfar meant dark elf. Hamfriggan (literally \"shapestrong\") referred to the shapeshifters of Ruathym.\n*Vok Dorrg, First Axe of Ruathym.\n*Aumark Lithyl, First Axe of Ruathym.\n*Dagmar, daughter of Ulf and twin of Ygraine betrayed her people to the Kraken Society and died in 1361 DR.\n*Hrolf the Unruly, pirate captain of the Elfmaid.\n*Ulf the Shaman of Ruathym town.\n*Wedigar Ruthmaald, First Axe of Holgerstead married to Alfhilda hamfriggan shapeshifter.\n*Ygraine, daughter of Ulf and twin of Dagmar prophesied to be the one to return the magic of hamfriggan shapeshifters to Ruathym."
