        "mainbody": "'''Southeast Faerûn''' lay to the south and east of the grassy plains known as the [[Shaar]], along the shores of the [[Great Sea]] opposite the land of [[Zakhara]]. At the edge of this region lay in the east the [[Five Kingdoms]] of the [[Utter East]]<ref name=\"GHotR-p95> and further to the south, and thus beyond [[Faerûn]], the giant peninsula of Zakhara.<ref name=\"FRCS3e-p230-231>",
        "Regions": {
            "Eastern Shaar": "{{Main|Eastern Shaar}}\nThe great expanse of the Eastern Shaar stretched from the [[Landrise]] in [[south Faerûn]] to the eastern region known as the [[Shining Lands]], south of the [[Raurin Desert]].\n* [[Beastlands]]: Located at the site of the ruined nation of [[Veldorn]], this region was home to various non-human monstrous tribes who aligned with one another in a loose confederation for self-defense. Aside from a [[kenku]] city in the [[Blackfeather Barrens]], there were no cities or population centers of note, but mere fortresses and ruins.\n* [[Okoth]]: After millennia of slumber, the ancient realm of the [[sarrukh]] slowly returned to prominence in the centuries leading up to the [[Era of Upheaval]]. By the late 1470s [[DR]] the sarrukh had re-established a number of cities around the central [[lake of Salt]].",
            "Shining South": "{{Main|Shining South}}\n* [[Dambrath]]: The coastal region on the northern shores of the [[Great Sea]] were home to nomadic clans of [[Arkaiun]]s who practiced [[lycanthropy]] as a means to honor their gods. Before the events of the [[Spellplague]], these people were ruled by the [[Crinti]], a grouping of [[half-elf|half]]-[[drow]]s who believed themselves to be far above their human subjects. The former capital of [[Cathyr]] was destroyed during the human revolt and beset with monstrous [[spider]]s and [[demon]]ic forces.\n* [[Luiren]]: An anomaly among the nations of Faerûn, these rich farmlands formed the only realm that ruled entirely by [[halfling]]s. After centuries of prosperity, disaster struck during the Spellplague, when the entirety of the realm was swept underwater by the expanse of the Great Sea. Many of the communities that lay on raised lands survived the disaster as island settlements, that endured the decades it took for the waters to recede and reform the coastline as it once was.<ref name=SCAg-p11\">\n\nThe [[Shining Lands]] comprised the three nations that were nestled around the great bay of the [[Golden Water]]. For many [[Faerûn]]ians, the realms of this region formed the eastern border of their known world, as tales about the [[Utter East|lands to the east]] were too far-fetched to ever be believed.\n\n* [[Durpar]]: The tolerant merchant kingdom believed wholly in the ideal of wealth and financial success. Unfortunately their lack of a unified army caused them to suffer great losses to the monstrous forces that originated from the Beastlands to the northwest, leaving only their capital of [[Vaelan]] untouched from war.\n* [[Estagund]]: While it shared strong bonds with its neighboring nations of [[Durpar]] and [[Var]], the monarchy of Estagund stood apart from its continued faith and practice of the [[Adama]]. It remained a beacon of spiritual wealth, commercial success, and stalwart military strength for all the Shining Lands.\n* [[Var]]: Once famous for its great fields of wheat and profound agricultural production, Var the Golden was entirely submerged under the waters of the [[Great Sea]] during the cataclysmic Spellplague. The sunken ruins of once-great cities were left as prices for the denizens of the depths, such as the [[sahuagin]].\n\nBeyond the Shining Lands were two more, out-of-the-way Realms.\n\n* [[Thommar]]: A small, rather unnoteworthy nation located far to the south beyond the [[Dustwall Mountains]].\n* [[Ulgarth]]: This [[human]]-centric feudal kingdom enjoyed strong trade with its neighbors, but suffered slower cultural and technological advancement due to isolation and years of oppressive rule.",
            "Utter East": "{{Main|Utter East}}\nThe Utter East was a land made famous by tales of fancy that featured the legendary [[Five Kingdoms]] and their fantastic exploits. The kingdoms were formed by the [[Ffolk]] who had migrated from the [[Moonshae Isles]] and conquered the local people known as the [[Mar (ethnicity)|Mar]], and ruled over them for a number of decades.<ref name=\"GHotR-p93> While the Mar were able to reclaim their freedom, they remained stuck in an imbalance of power with the kingdoms of the Ffolk.<ref name=\"GHotR-p95 />\n\nAmong the Five Kingdoms were [[Doegan]], [[Edenvale]], [[Konigheim]], and the [[Free Cities of Parsanic]]."
