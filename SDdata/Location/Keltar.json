        "mainbody": "{{otheruses4|the city|the person|Keltar (individual)}}\n'''Keltar''', one of the oldest cities in [[Faerûn]], was located in [[Calimshan]] and was famous for being the site of the [[House of the Broken God]].<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
        "Geography and Layout": "Keltar was located at the eastern edge of the [[Calim Desert]] along the deepest point of the [[Calim River]].<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/><ref name=EotS-p56/> The majority of the city was on the west side of the river, but the cattle processing centers were on the east side.<ref name=EotS-p56/> It was one of the smaller cities of Calimshan &mdash; a town by usual [[Calishite]] standards<ref name=EotSS-p99> &mdash; and contained eight [[sabban]]s composed of 24 [[drudach]]s.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/> <ref group=note name=note3>The reference cited lists Keltar as having 14 drudachs, but this is assumed to be a typographical error, as the ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' and [[Calimport (sourcebook)|''Calimport'']] sourcebooks establish that sabbans contain three to five drudachs. Unlike with other Calishite cities, Keltar's sabbans were named after the eight points of the compass.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>\n\nThe city contained a massive [[wikipedia:en:Sluice|sluice gate]] to divert the waters of the Calim River and boasted many canals flowing through its easternmost sabbans. In Northeast Sabban, these canals turned waterwheels to power mills and also giant fans, which were designed to blow the smell of cattle pens, slaughterhouses, and [[wikipedia:en:Tanning|tanneries]] away. In other areas of the city, they were used for fishing and swimming or for travel in [[wikipedia:en:Gondola|gondolas]].<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>\n\nThe House of the Broken God (see below) encompassed the entire Northwest Sabban.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>\n\nOutside of Keltar, the Calim River provided relatively fertile farmland for crops,<ref name=EotSS-p87> and the surrounding [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|shanate]] was dominated by herds.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
        "Government": "In [[1370 DR]], Keltar was ruled by Sultan [[Duncan el Ashnarti]],<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/> and he had held his position of power there for at least a dozen years.<ref name=EotS-p56/> Because he was married to a woman from [[el Ahimar]] crime family, who were in turn subservient to the [[Ralan el Pesarkhal|syl-pasha]], he controlled the underworld in Keltar as well.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/> Despite his strong grip on the city, he was a wise ruler,<ref name=EotS-p56/> and Keltar was for the most part a peaceful city.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>\n\nThe surrounding shanate was controlled by [[Alzhedo dictionary#Y|Ynamalik]] [[Uras el Ihak]]. Since he was good friends with Sultan Ashnarti, he was not a political threat to the latter's power.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>\n\nBecause it contained more cattle than people, Keltar did not have a high reputation among Calishites and was therefore the least political of all Calimshan's cities.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
        "Trade": "All kinds of livestock were traded, herded, slaughtered, and packed here, including cattle, camels, buffalo, and other exotic herd animals. Keltar was also well known for its leather trade, especially its fine saddles,<ref name=EotS-p56/> most notably those manufactured by [[Tenassar Saddleworks]].<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>\n\nKeltar's slave trade focused primarily on [[goblinoid]]s. Most of these slaves were exported to [[Calimport]] or [[Thay]].<ref name=EotSS-p189>\n\nBecause the city was so cattle-driven, it did not cater to adventurers.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
        "History": "Keltar was as old as Calimport, making it older even than [[Waterdeep]].<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/> It was founded sometime after {{Yearlink|-7800}} by the great genie [[Calim]] and became part of the [[Calim Caliphates]].<ref name=FRCS-p267>\n\nThroughout its history, the city was destroyed and rebuilt many times:\n* After the [[First Era of Skyfire]], the city was rebuilt at the start of the kingdom of [[Coramshan]].<ref name=TGHotR-p21/>\n* In {{Yearlink|-664}}, Keltar was nearly annihilated by a [[drow]] attack. Over a period of 37 hours, the city was encased in magical darkness and nearly half of its population at the time was carried off as prisoners. The army of Calimport rescued the city, but not before 3,000 people had been lost.<ref name=TGHotR-p41>\n* In [[320 DR]], Keltar was one of the Calishite cities suffering from the [[Infernal Death]].<ref name=TGHotR-p70>\n* In [[1018 DR]], during a [[Rage of Dragons]], [[Sapphiraktar|Sapphiraktar the Blue]] destroyed Keltar, as well as Calimport, which ended the [[Seventh Age of Calimshan]].<ref name=TGHotR-p115>",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Bathhouses": "South Sabban had a number of bathhouses, which were a more culturally acceptable option to bathing in the canals.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
            "The [[House of the Broken God]]": "Undoubtedly the most famous site within Keltar, the House of the Broken God was the largest temple to [[Ilmater]] in all of [[Faerûn]]. It covered an area the size of three drudachs, the entirety of Northwest Sabban.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
            "The [[Ringed Nose]]": "This seedy tavern was located in East Sabban among the slaughterhouses and was run by a staff of [[half-orc]]s. It had bar fights nearly every night, but was a good place to secretly trade information.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
            "The [[Seminarcane]]": "This complex from the Seventh Age of Calimshan housed the [[Guild Arcane]]'s headquarters and a school for magic.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
            "[[Steps of Istishia]]": "This monolithic shrine to [[Istishia]] in North Sabban was thousands of years old and a wonder to behold. The waters from the city's sluice gate were directed here and pumped to the top of the structure where they cascaded down steps into the pool below.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>",
            "The [[Tenassar Saddleworks]]": "This company made some of the most famous saddles in Faerûn. Supposedly, the owner, [[Asraf el Tenassar]], could make a saddle for any animal, from rabbits to dragons.<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>"
        },
        "Notable Inhabitants": "In [[1370 DR]], figures of influence in Keltar included:<ref name=EotSS-pp108-110/>\n* [[Duncan el Ashnarti]], the sultan of Keltar\n* [[Xaros Tenseal]], officer of el [[Amlakkar]]\n* [[Uras el Ihak]], ynamalik of the shanate around Keltar\n* [[Jafar el Ihak]], Uras' son\n* [[Asraf el Tenassar]], owner of the Tenassar Saddleworks\n* [[Rabi el Lammil]], a skilled horse breeder and horseman\n* [[Adhan el Ilmater]], head priest of the House of the Broken God"
