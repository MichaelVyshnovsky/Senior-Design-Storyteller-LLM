Stonyeyes was one of the districts of the Outer City of Baldurs Gate. It was located just outside of the eastern region of the Lower City, just beyond the Basilisk Gate.
The neighborhood was home to a large community of half-orcs, many of whom worked as porters. They helped in transporting goods to and from caravans coming to Baldurs Gate, as their pack animals were not allowed within the city walls.
The Bloody Hands gang was the most prominent criminal organization that operated within Stonyeyes, during the late 15 century DR, under the leadership of Nine-Fingers and the Guild. Additionally, the Cult of the Dead Three also had a presence, infiltrating local businesses and commiting murders in the name of their dark gods.
