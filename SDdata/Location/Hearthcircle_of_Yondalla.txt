The Hearthcircle of Yondalla was a sacred grove and shrine to the halfling goddess Yondalla in the village of Shining Falls in the Delimbiyr Vale in the 14 century DR.
Lying amidst the woods northwest of the village, the Hearthcircle was simply a lush clearing where worshipers would gather. Close by was a cottage where the priest and acolytes lived.
Circa 1372 DR, the cleric Kellinda Harvertide lived here with two young acolytes. They provided healing, such as cure light wounds for a 10 gp donation.
