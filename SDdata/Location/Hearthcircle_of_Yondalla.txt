The '''Hearthcircle of Yondalla''' was a sacred grove and shrine to the [[halfling]] goddess [[Yondalla]] in the village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lying amidst the woods northwest of the village, the Hearthcircle was simply a lush clearing where worshipers would gather. Close by was a cottage where the priest and acolytes lived.

==Inhabitants==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the [[cleric]] [[Kellinda Harvertide]] lived here with two young acolytes. They provided healing, such as ''[[cure light wounds]]'' for a 10 [[gp]] donation.
