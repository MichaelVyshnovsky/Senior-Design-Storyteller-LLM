        "mainbody": "Druidhome was druidic settlement on the island of Ilighôn, off the coast of the Vilhon Reach.\nDruidhome was situated about a mile away from the south-eastern shores of Springbrook Shallows, a large lake at the end of the Springbrook river that rushed down from the Elder Spires at the center of Ilighôn. Lake Bluesprings laid around  to Druidhomes east. The settlement itself was more of a small collection of groves than a traditional village. This strange settlement served as a home for old clerics, druids, and rangers who served Silvanus, Mielikki, and Eldath. All the inhabitants of Druidhome arrived there in their advanced twilight years to spend them in peace, serving the deities they devoted their lives to.\nMost inhabitants of Druidhome preferred calm and seclusion to worldly affairs, but they readily took up weapons in defense of their forests and churches if the need arose."
