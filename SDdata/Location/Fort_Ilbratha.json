        "Description": "The log palisade that once ringed the fort was burned to the ground and entirely erased, but the stone foundations survived into the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "The fort lay on the eastern side of the Troll Mountains, and controlled the quickest east–west pass through mountains. This pass was also the only one that didn't lead into the [[Snakewood]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Amn}}",
        "History": "The fort was built to be the northernmost defense of the 4{{th}} century DR realm of [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]]. However, on King [[Ashar Tornamn]]'s push north in the {{YearlinkName|375}}, the [[Calishite]] garrison there was left with a bare skeleton staff.\n\nFollowing Valashar's defeat to Cormyrean forces in the {{YearlinkName|376}}, Prince [[Azoun Obarskyr I]] of Cormyr pushed on through [[Amn]], Valashar, and [[Tethyr]], pillaging many garrisons. With the magical sword ''[[Ilbratha]]'' in hand, Azoun overran the few remaining defenders of this fort and razed it to the ground, with the campaign continuing deeper into the [[Shoon Imperium]] until his victorious sacking of [[Ithmong]].{{Valashar dates}}\n\nThe garrison's original name was lost; history recorded it as \"Fort Ilbratha\" after the famed sword that destroyed it."
