        "mainbody": "Muranndin, also known formerly as Murannheim and the Sothillisian Empire,  was a kingdom of ogres and orcs in the Lands of Intrigue in western Faerûn.\nThe monster kingdom of Muranndin bordered Amn in the north via the Small Teeth Mountains, Tethyrs northern Wealdath forest in the east, and west with the Dragons Head peninsula. This left the independent duchy of Velen isolated from the rest of Faerûn. \nThe monarch of this kingdom was called the \"Great Mur\" or \"Murkul\", which usually was the chieftain of the strongest tribe. The Great Mur was responsible for essentially keeping the other tribes and bandits together and prevent infighting between them.\nThe kingdom had few qualms about seizing the wealth and goods that passed through or near their territory, however they were known to form secret arrangements to leave the caravans of select wealthy merchants alone in exchange for payment in either gold or weapons.\nSlavery was the status quo since the foundation of the kingdom. The conquerors of the Murann city enslaved thousands of Amnians back in the 1370s and the descendants of those slaves served the ogres, orcs, and brigands of the area. A slave in Muranndin could fight his way out by showing martial skill or usefulness enough to impress either his owner or one of the chieftains.\nThe chieftains maintained scattered strongholds and keeps across the kingdom that were vital to secure the borders, especially with Amn since Muranndin was established on a great portion of Amnian soil and the High Houses offered bounties on ogres, trolls, and giants.\nThe kingdom of Muranndin existed since the , when a duo of ogre mages, Sothillis and Cyrvisnea, led an army of monstrous humanoids and worshipers of Cyric against southern Amn in a conflict that would come to be known as the Sothillisian War. The official establishment of the kingdom, however, was after the successful siege of the southwest Amnian city of Murann in the , that eventually became its capital. As of the , it had become common knowledge that one of Amns ruling Council of Six was present in the city when it was captured, and the Council had became increasingly concerned that this imprisoned councilor might have given away important information under duress.\nDuring the early years, the kingdom was more commonly known as the \"Sothillisian Empire\" or as \"Murannheim\".\nAs of , Muranndin remained a constant threat to Amnian trade interests. In-fighting within the kingdom was common at this time, and the Great Mur wielded only nominal control over Muranndins chieftains and bandit lords."
