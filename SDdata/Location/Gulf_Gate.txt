The Gulf Gate was one of the entrances into Huzuz, the City of Delights in 1367 DR.
Located south of the Clothiers District,The activity of the Gulf Gate was stated as being monitored by the Affluent District, but this may be a printing error since the Affluent District is located on the opposite side of the city. this gate was largely used by traders and suppliers. It was also the closest gate to the Grand Bazaar. In addition to the craft goods, most of Huzuzs food supply entered through this gate.
The Gulf Gate was closed during the night.
