        "mainbody": "lodel was an island in the north-west Lake of Steam that was once a private hunting preserve for some eccentric, self-made Calishite merchants. They would often charge other wealthy Calishites for the privilege of joining them.\nOlodel laid south and west of the island known as Narruth.\nWithin the heart of the Olodel was a tunnel system that led directly to the Underdark beholder city of Zokir.\nThe Calishite merchants that once hunted on Olodel brought a number of deepspawns on to the island to to disgorge countless monsters for them to hunt. Monsters that they fed to them to populate Olodel included chimerae, manticores, su-monsters, tigers.\nOne day the Calishite merchants that inhabited Olodel brought a cadre of beholders to the island, who proceeded to slay them and take it for themselves. The beholders would go on to create a series of traps and utilize the deepspawn to creature more malicious creatures.\nThe Calishite merchants that once inhabited this island constructed fortified hunting lodges, from which fly out across the island on the backs of griffons or hippogriffs. Following their deaths, the lodges fell into ruin and became the lairs of its beholder usurpers."
