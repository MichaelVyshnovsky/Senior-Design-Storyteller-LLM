        "Trade": "Myratma became known as the Textiles City because of its high-quality canvases, silks, and other fine textiles. Most of these were produced in the [[Tethyr Mills]], just outside its gates along the River Ith.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp76-78/>\n\nThe city depended on commerce and trade for its livelihood. Most of the agricultural produce from the center of the country flowed through Myratma on the way to other lands by sea. The goods were floated down the River Ith by barge. Calimshan was a major purchaser of Tethyrian grain coming through Myratma.<ref name=EotS-pp39-40/>\n\nWith the exception of [[Zazesspur]] to the north, the markets of Myratma tended to sell at higher prices than other cities of Tethyr. In 1370 DR, port and dock duties were three gold coins (''aenar''), and caravan and wagon tolls were one ''aenar''.<ref name=LoI1:T-p15/> Market fees varied, depending on the season of the year.<ref name=LoI1:T-p16/>",
        "History": "The site that would later become Myratma was first settled by the subjects of the Great Pasha [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] sometime between {{Yearlink|-6800}} and {{Yearlink|-6400}} as part of the kingdom of [[Memnonnar (country)|Memnonnar]].<ref name=EotSS-p12> This city was laid to ruin during the [[First Era of Skyfire]] and subsequently rebuilt by the dwarves of [[High Shanatar]],<ref name=EotSS-p14/> who removed the brass and red brick from the original buildings to adorn their new tunnels and halls.<ref name=LEoF-p119>\n\nMyratma was first settled by humans sometime after the [[Second Age of Calimshan]] when the [[Calishite]]s began establishing outposts and garrisons in what they called the [[Purple Marches]].<ref name=LoI1:T-p22> It was founded by the Jhannivvar clan.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp76-78/> During the [[Tethyrian]] rebellion against [[Calimshan]] in that country's Fourth Age, the city changed hands several times. It was first taken from Calimshan by Tethyr in {{Yearlink|-307}},<ref name=EotSS-p19> at which point it was renamed \"Artrimmar\",<ref name=EotSS-p41/> then taken back for Calimshan in {{Yearlink|-230}}. Tethyr took it back again in {{Yearlink|-212}}, when [[Darrom Ithal]] brought independence to Tethyr until the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]].<ref name=EotSS-p19/> (Myratma was, in fact, the original home of the infamous [[Akkabar Shoon the Elder]].<ref name=EotSS-p23>)\n\nMyratma was to play a key role during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]]. It was the site of two major battles, the [[First Siege of Myratma|First]] and [[Second Siege of Myratma|Second Sieges of Myratma]].<ref name=LoI1:T-p42><ref name=LoI1:T-pp43-45>\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], \"Prince\" [[Yusuf Jhannivvar]] claimed rulership over the city and refused to submit to the new queen of Tethyr, [[Zaranda Star]]. For a month, the Reclamation Army laid siege to the city, but by the last day of [[Eleint]] that year, they were defeated, and Zaranda Star and several other leaders of the Loyalist movement were taken prisoner and tortured.<ref name=LoI1:T-p42/>\n\nThe Second Siege began on the [[Feast of the Moon]], when Prince [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] arrived and gathered the army together again. The Second Siege lasted three months, during which time a successful rescue attempt by Haedrak and [[Timoth Eyesbright]] was made to recover the queen. While the rescue was under way, [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Perendra Raslemtar]], and [[Onyx the Invincible]] sabotaged the city, clogging the wells and weakening its walls.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp43-45/>\n\nThe siege finally ended in a battle known as the Storm Siege on the [[Ches 30|last day of Ches]], [[1369 DR]], when Loyalist [[druid]]s and [[cleric]]s bombarded Myratma with lightning and blew open its gates. The army stormed in, and the city was taken when Haedrak and Zaranda slew Yusuf on the west wall.<ref name=LoI1:T-pp43-45/>\n\nReconstruction of the city's Eastgate and walls were completed by [[1370 DR]].<ref name=LoI1:T-pp76-78/>",
