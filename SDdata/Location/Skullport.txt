'''Skullport''', also known as the '''Port of Shadows''', was a subterranean city located far below [[Waterdeep]], within the 3{{rd}} level of [[Undermountain]] known as the [[Sargauth Level]]. While rumors of this subterranean domain of villainy persisted throughout the surface world, few of its inhabitants had any knowledge of any points of entry.

==Description==
Built on an ancient [[Netherese]] [[Sargauth Enclave|ruin]], within an immense subterranean cavern, the shadowy port was a dark reflection of the ''City of Splendors'' above. Its structure was built in three tiers, interconnected by narrow catwalks and rickety scaffolding. Creaking houses built on stilts were haphazardly built in a dense network that formed a near shantytown.{{Cite dungeon/200/Backdrop: Skullport}}

Exact divisions between regions was a matter of debate, but Skullport was divided into four generally accepted wards: [[Skull Island]], [[the Port]], [[the Trade Lanes]], and [[the Heart]]. Although no clear vertical boundaries existed, locals divided Skullport into three vertical tiers to aid navigation: the Crown, the Venter and the Dredge.

==Geographical Features==
===Sargauth, Portals, and Port===
The portals in the cavern walls along the river [[Sargauth]] were said to have been established by [[Halaster Blackcloak]] himself.

Passage through the locks that separated Skullport from the [[sea caves]] of Waterdeep required permission from the [[Keepers]]. However, a talented mage could "piggyback" another ship passing through the portal at the same time.

==Government==
As of [[1479 DR]] most control over day-to-day activities was managed by gangs such as the [[Lowfellows]] or the [[Mandible]].

However, the [[Skulls of Skullport]], [[magic|magically]] transformed remnants of the original [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[mage]]s who settled in the cavern, watched closely over trade within the town. Any activities that interfered with the town drew the attention of the Skulls who would impose seemingly random punishments for minor infractions and enslave or destroy offenders for serious crimes.

==Notable Locations==
[[Image:Skullport-Zstulkk.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Overview of Skullport showing location of the "Snake Pit"]]

===[[Crown (Skullport)|The Crown]]===
The upper tier of Skullport, this area was home to pirate captains and wealthier merchants prior to the city's abandonment after the Spellplague.
* [[Crookspar Parlor]]: A gambling den in the highest part of the Crown.
* [[Dumathion's Jest]]: This establishment was run by the [[gem]]-appraiser [[Ygarra Urmbaalt]].

* [[Nightshade's Caress]]: An apothecary shop run by the [[mummy]] known as [[Nightshade (shopkeep)|Nightshade]].
* [[Overflowing Urn]]: Listing to one side, this shop offered flasks and oil under the ownership of the shopkeep [[Garryth]].
* [[Tanor'thal Refuge]]: The stronghold of [[House Tanor'Thal]] resembled a gargantuan upside-down [[giant spider|spider]] that overlooked all of Skullport.
* [[Worm's Gullet]]: This restaurant was located within the hollowed-out carcass of a petrified [[purple worm]].

===[[Venter|The Venter]]===
The cramped middle tier of Skullport that contained most of its buildings.
* [[Bat's Roost]]: What was formerly a particularly seedy tavern during the 14{{th}} century DR, the Roost had evolved into a fighting den.

* [[Nine Bells]]: An enormous warehouse that served as a market in the late 15{{th}} century.
* [[Pick and Lantern]]: A rather successful tavern that was favored by the sailors and [[skulldigger]]s of Skullport.

* [[Twinbeard's Traps]]: Located in the center of the Venter, this building was the workshop of [[Thorvin Twinbeard]] master trapsmith of [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]].

===[[Dredge|The Dredge]]===
The lowest level of Skullport was a dank slum,
* [[Black Tankard]]: This small, filthy tavern fell under the domain of Xanathar and his thieves guild.
* [[Blind Fish]]: a rowdy tavern by the riverfront.
* [[Dark Harvest market]]: A number of [[duergar]] sold food they had harvested from throughout the Underdark within this shop.
* [[Dead Man's Corner]]: Within this dilapidated shop, the [[sea hag]] [[Olive Stillwater]] sold [[zombie]]s that had been formed from the corpses of [[human]]s.
* [[Feathered Rat]]: This peculiar pet store was run by the [[half-elven]] Harper spy [[Ulvira Snowveins]].
* [[Flagon and the Dragon]]: Of a higher class than the nearby [[Black Tankard]], this establishment was run by a particularly knowledgeable half-[[drow]] woman named [[Cal'al Claddani]]. 
* [[Grand Hoist|The Grand Hoist]]: An unfinished, and possibly misguided project to build a hoist to transport goods from Skullport to Waterdeep.
* [[Guts and Garters]]: Run-down and grimy, this establishment was the last-known inn to exist in Skullport as of the 15{{th}} century.
* [[Gyudd's Distillery]]: This tall, three-story stone building featured a number of ales and wines of varying quality.
* [[Hired Horrors]]: A sturdy two-story warehouse that sold [[deepspawn]] to wealthy clients in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Kreel's fishery]]: A group of buildings in the Dredge where fish were processed for sale.
* [[Scupperden]]: The only eatery in the Dredge featured a single dish of fish-and-mushroom stew.
* [[Sea Chest]]: This shop, which once sold a variety of chests and strongboxes, was abandoned following the untimely devouring of its proprietor's brain.
* [[Sword and Sextant]]: The [[halfling]]s that run this map shop long sought to procure any maps that accurately portrayed the layout of Undermountain.
* [[Thimblewine's Pawnshop]]: Originally run by the cheerful fence [[Thimblewine]], this shop was taken over by his niece [[Krystaleen]] following his death.

===[[Skull Island]]===
Located south of Skullport proper, within the Sargauth River across the [[Murkspan Bridge]], this small isle was a well-defended fortress.
* [[Tower of Seven Woes]]
* [[Skull Island Prison]]
* [[School of Obedience]]
* [[Halls of the Iron Ring]]

===[[Skullport/Dungeons|Dungeons]]===

===The Port===
The Port was located directly north of Skull Island and east of the Trade Lanes in Skullport's main cavern. It was the rowdiest ward of Skullport, hosting a large number of [[festhall]]s and buccaneers on shore leave. The cavern ceiling was nearly 100 feet tall. The Port had a lower (Dredge) and central (Venter) level.

* [[Skullport/Lower Port]]
* [[Skullport/Central Port]]

===Trade Lanes===
The Trade Lanes was a ward that connected the Port ward to the west and the Heart ward to the east. It was a long corridor with fairly straight north and south cavern walls, containing the bulk of Skullport's trades and services. The ceiling rose from {{SIrange|100|300|ft|long=yes}} as it angled up from the Port to the Heart. The Trade Lanes had three levels, Dredge, Venter and Crown.

* [[Skullport/Lower Trade Lanes|Lower Trade Lanes]]
* [[Skullport/Central Trade Lanes|Central Trade Lanes]]
* [[Skullport/Upper Trade Lanes|Upper Trade Lanes]]

===[[Skullport/Heart|The Heart]]===
The Heart was the easternmost part of the main Skullport cavern, opening from the Trade Lanes to the west to round off at the cavern's eastern wall. It was the primary residential ward and highest-class area of Skullport, and also contained some businesses. Its ceiling was 300 feet. It had a rougher, more natural cave-like appearance than the other wards due to the hundreds of overhanging stalactites. Like the Trade Lanes, the Heart contained three levels, but due to its higher ceiling, its upper Crown levels were higher than the upper levels of the Trade Lanes.

===Other Locations===
*[[Hall of Mental Splendor]]: A small stronghold that housed a cadre of [[psionic]] spies that worked on contract, led by [[Vhondryl]].
*[[Snake Pit]]: The Snake Pit was located in the heart of Skullport's mercantile district.
*[[Threads|The Threads]]: A series of tunnels north of the main cavern.

==History==
Skullport's history dated back centuries to a group of Netherese mages known as the [[Sargauth Enclave]] who settled in Skullport's cavern. These mages fashioned the [[Mantle]], a [[mythal]] that protected their settlement. When Netheril fell in {{Yearlink|-339}} the Mantle was ripped apart by [[wild magic]] which killed most of the inhabitants.  Thirteen Netherese mages were absorbed by the magic and turned into disembodied skulls.

In the [[1148 DR|Year of the Angry Sea, 1148 DR]] [[Shradin Mulophor]] obtained permission from [[Halaster Blackcloak]] to settle in the ruins of the Netherese enclave. For several centuries Skullport prospered as one of the main trading ports of the Underdark.

However, in the late 14{{th}} century DR just prior to the [[Spellplague]] a [[slaad]] named [[Azriim]] weakened the Mantle so that it could no longer support the cavern's weight and large sections of the cave collapsed.  During the Spellplague in [[1385 DR]] the Mantle shot off bursts of wild magic and then disappeared.

[[File:Skullport.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Skullport in 1479 DR]]

After the Spellplague, most survivors fled Skullport.  At some point in the second half of the 15{{th}} century DR a young explorer named [[Miriam Sequora]] began showing off chunks of [[mithral]] she claimed she found in Skullport's ruins. She convinced a small number of miners to join her and soon a few merchants and miscreants settled in the town.{{Waterdeep-time}}

==Inhabitants==
Inhabitants of Skullport were known as "Skulkers".

===Notable Organizations===
* [[Keepers|The Keepers]], hired [[mage]]s who raised ships through the magical locks that led from the port to the sea caves south of Waterdeep.
* [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]], the infamous criminal organization helmed by the [[Xanathar (title)|Xanathar]].

===14{{th}} Century===
