Skullport, also known as the Port of Shadows, was a subterranean city located far below Waterdeep, within the 3 level of Undermountain known as the Sargauth Level. While rumors of this subterranean domain of villainy persisted throughout the surface world, few of its inhabitants had any knowledge of any points of entry.
Built on an ancient Netherese ruin, within an immense subterranean cavern, the shadowy port was a dark reflection of the City of Splendors above. Its structure was built in three tiers, interconnected by narrow catwalks and rickety scaffolding. Creaking houses built on stilts were haphazardly built in a dense network that formed a near shantytown.
Exact divisions between regions was a matter of debate, but Skullport was divided into four generally accepted wards Skull Island, the Port, the Trade Lanes, and the Heart. Although no clear vertical boundaries existed, locals divided Skullport into three vertical tiers to aid navigation the Crown, the Venter and the Dredge.
The portals in the cavern walls along the river Sargauth were said to have been established by Halaster Blackcloak himself.
Passage through the locks that separated Skullport from the sea caves of Waterdeep required permission from the Keepers. However, a talented mage could "piggyback" another ship passing through the portal at the same time.
As of 1479 DR most control over day-to-day activities was managed by gangs such as the Lowfellows or the Mandible.
However, the Skulls of Skullport, magically transformed remnants of the original Netherese mages who settled in the cavern, watched closely over trade within the town. Any activities that interfered with the town drew the attention of the Skulls who would impose seemingly random punishments for minor infractions and enslave or destroy offenders for serious crimes.

The Port had a lower (Dredge) and central (Venter) level.

The Trade Lanes was a ward that connected the Port ward to the west and the Heart ward to the east. It was a long corridor with fairly straight north and south cavern walls, containing the bulk of Skullports trades and services. The ceiling rose from  as it angled up from the Port to the Heart. The Trade Lanes had three levels, Dredge, Venter and Crown.
* Lower Trade Lanes
* Central Trade Lanes
* Upper Trade Lanes
The Heart was the easternmost part of the main Skullport cavern, opening from the Trade Lanes to the west to round off at the caverns eastern wall. It was the primary residential ward and highest-class area of Skullport, and also contained some businesses. Its ceiling was 300 feet. It had a rougher, more natural cave-like appearance than the other wards due to the hundreds of overhanging stalactites. Like the Trade Lanes, the Heart contained three levels, but due to its higher ceiling, its upper Crown levels were higher than the upper levels of the Trade Lanes.

Skullports history dated back centuries to a group of Netherese mages known as the Sargauth Enclave who settled in Skullports cavern. These mages fashioned the Mantle, a mythal that protected their settlement. When Netheril fell in  the Mantle was ripped apart by wild magic which killed most of the inhabitants.  Thirteen Netherese mages were absorbed by the magic and turned into disembodied skulls.
In the Year of the Angry Sea, 1148 DR Shradin Mulophor obtained permission from Halaster Blackcloak to settle in the ruins of the Netherese enclave. For several centuries Skullport prospered as one of the main trading ports of the Underdark.
However, in the late 14 century DR just prior to the Spellplague a slaad named Azriim weakened the Mantle so that it could no longer support the caverns weight and large sections of the cave collapsed.  During the Spellplague in 1385 DR the Mantle shot off bursts of wild magic and then disappeared.

After the Spellplague, most survivors fled Skullport.  At some point in the second half of the 15 century DR a young explorer named Miriam Sequora began showing off chunks of mithral she claimed she found in Skullports ruins. She convinced a small number of miners to join her and soon a few merchants and miscreants settled in the town.
