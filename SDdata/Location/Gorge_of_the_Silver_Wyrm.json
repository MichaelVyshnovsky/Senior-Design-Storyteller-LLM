        "mainbody": "he Gorge of the Silver Wyrm was a canyon in Hartsvale through which the Wyrm River flowed.\nThe gorge was deep and dark. On one side of the canyon, the walls were sheer granite cliffs, against which the Wyrm River flowed. On the other side was a road full of ruts that led to the mines of Earl Radborne Wynn. Small footpaths led up a steep, rocky slope to the various silver mines from the road. Pine trees used to cover the slope, but were cut down because of the mining.\nThe gorge was found within the Ice Spires South.\nSilver was discovered in the gorge by the Wynn family early in the history of Hartsvale, and this silver supported the country as its primary export.\nIt was in this canyon, in 1369 DR, that Queen Brianna Burdun and her escorts were ambushed first by fire giants"
