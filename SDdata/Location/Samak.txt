'''Samak''' was the sole settlement found on [[Maribar Island]] in the [[Cities of the Pearl]] region of [[west Zakhara]].

==Geography==
Samak sat along the southwestern shore of the island facing the city of [[Sikak]] roughly {{SI|60|mi|k}} to the southwest. The [[Bountiful Shoals]] coral reef filled the waters of the [[Golden Gulf]] directly offshore from the town.
