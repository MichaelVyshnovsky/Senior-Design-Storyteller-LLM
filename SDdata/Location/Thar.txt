'''Thar''', also known as the '''Great Gray Land''', was a rocky, broken moor stretching for hundreds of miles with a harsh climate in the [[Moonsea North]] region, beyond the eponymous [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] lake. It was inhabited by wild tribes of [[humanoid]]s such as [[orc]]s and [[ogre]]s that were constantly at war with one another.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: The Tribes of Thar}}

==Description==
The vast steppes of Thar were bleak and barren, that was considered by many to be wholly uninhabitable. While the rough and hard terrain made it difficult to effectively settle, it also offered resiliency against some of its more savage and destructive inhabitants.

===Climate===
Thar was bleak and windy, and was highly unsuitable for growing crops.

==Geography==
It was situated partly within and continued west of the [[Cold Lands]], along the northern shores of the Moonsea Lake, between the [[Galena Mountains|Galena]] and [[Dragonspine Mountains]].

The [[Glister Road]] the only true pathway that cut through the land of Thar.

===Geographical Features===
Some areas of Thar held rich deposits of [[gem]]s.

===Flora & Fauna===
Among the more monstrous beasts found in Thar included [[bulette]]s, [[ibrandlin]], [[leucrotta]] [[manticore]]s, [[peryton]]s, While Thar was famous for the savage ogres, or "beast-men" as they were known in the lands beyond, it was also home to savage tribes of [[orc]]s, and the orc-ogre crossbreed known as [[orog]]s.

While large prey animals such as [[deer]] were not common in Thar, many smaller rodents such as [[mice]], [[vole]]s, and [[rabbit]]s thrived in its grasslands. Above them in the food chain were smaller predators such as [[fox]]es and [[wolves]], along with predatory birds like [[kestrel (bird)|kestrels]], [[shrike]]s, [[falcon]]s, and the magnificent [[steppe eagle]].

It was the home of the [[Tharurr]] breed of [[horse]], the name meaning "Thar's horse" in the [[giant language]].

==Society==
===Religion===
The worship of [[Vaprak]] was predominant among the ogre tribes of Thar, as they believed tolerating his cruelty would allow them the strength to rule over the land once more.

===Culture===
[[Messenger snake]]s were considered quite a delicacy throughout the lands of Thar.

==Trade==
Despite its reputation as a dismal wasteland, a number of important caravan routes crisscrossed across the plains of Thar. Adventurers, scouts, and guides were regularly found accompanying these caravans to ensure safe passage.

==History==
From {{YearlinkName|-981}} to {{YearlinkName|-350}}, the region that would eventually be known as Thar was part of the [[minotaur]] kingdom of [[Grong-Haap]], ruled by [[Haask, Voice of Hargut]], during which time the region enjoyed a comparatively high level of civilization.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep}}

Later, [[Vorbyx]] founded the ogre kingdom of Thar.

The Tharkuls of the realm, referred to by outsiders as ogre-kings, would continue to rule over the land for nearly 1500 years.

In the {{YearlinkName|400}}, the [[Dark Alliance]] of malevolent [[humanoid]]s from Thar attacked and destroyed [[Northkeep]], sinking it below the waves of the [[Moonsea]].

The [[elven]] [[archmage]] [[Abarat]] began construction of his ivory tower in Thar during the {{YearlinkName|669}}, with the hopes that it would serve as a bulwark against the malevolent forces of the lands beyond. 

The terrible [[Battle of the Masks]] brought out on the plains of Thar in the {{YearlinkName|1259}}, between the [[Masked Wizards of Ankhalus]] and the [[Zhentilar]].

The human kingdom of Thar was established in the {{YearlinkName|1288}}, when [[Beldoran]] slew [[Maulog]] the last Tharkul of the ogre kingdom of Thar. The human kingdom fell after a mere 15 years, in the {{YearlinkName|1303}}, after an army of ogres threatening the [[Citadel of the Raven]] were re-routed to sack [[Phlan]] by the [[Zhentilar]].

When the [[Flight of Dragons]] occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, many rampaging [[dragon]]s flew south from Thar and wreaked havoc on the lands of the Moonsea.

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[lich]] [[Aesperus]] controlled the undead of eastern Thar. Around that same time, the [[orog]] warlord [[Larga Bloodhand]] rose to some level of prominence, at least until she angered the [[red dragon]] [[Throstulgrael]] and became stranded by her minions.{{Cite adventurers league/Raiders of the Twilight Marsh|20}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Legends stated that the great lost kingdom of ogres was formed by the legendary Vorbyx, who united many tribes together and enslaved the land's orc population. He was said to have a [[Vorbyx's Hammer|legendary hammer]] that bestowed upon him profound wisdom and keen intellect.

==Notable Locations==
===Landmarks===
* [[Chambers of Bone]], a false lair of Vorbyx, meant to throw off those that attempted to overthrow his power.
* [[Fangjaws Hold]], the lair of the [[Skullsmashers]] tribe of ogres, located in the hills in central Thar.
* Orc Fortress, a solitary outpost that legend stated was under the protection of the [[orc pantheon]].
* [[Ogre's Stronghold]], a stone fort that housed the ogres led by chieftain [[Dagryg]].
* [[Tomb of Vorbyx]], the true resting place of Vorbyx.
* [[Valley of the Falls]]
* [[Vorbyx's Watchpost]], a lone stone tower that was once served as an outpost for the legendary Vorbyx.
* [[Xûl Jarak]], an ancient orc citadel containing a passage to the [[Underdark]].

===Ruins===
* [[Glister]], a former [[human]] city that was demolished by [[Blood Skull (tribe)|Blood Skull]] orcs.
* [[Rosestone Abbey]], a ruined abbey near [[Hulburg]] dedicated to the worship of [[Amaunator]].

===Settlements===
* [[Hulburg]], a small city on the southeastern edge of Thar.

==Inhabitants==
The many humanoid tribes of Thar carried out attacks on caravans heading to or from [[Glister]], the camps in the [[Galenas]] foothills, or villages in the [[Stojanow Vale]]. In an attempt to keep them in check and bring stability to the area, lords and merchants were known to enter into agreements with the tribes to encourage them not to attack, but these agreements broke down easily. Scouts, hired adventuring companies, and the [[barbarian]]s of the [[Ride]] also ventured into Thar to hunt these tribes and destroy any creatures they encountered.

Ogre tribes in Thar were named after aspects of their ancient kingdom, such as the [[Jade Skull]], [[Falling Star]], and [[Crystal Sphere (tribe)|Crystal Sphere]] tribes. Prominent orc tribes included the [[Skullsmashers]], [[Red Claws]], the [[Kossuth]]-worshiping [[Burning Daggers]], and [[Black Spear]]s.

A group known as the [[Thar Rangers]] operated throughout Thar, looking our for the interests of foreign travelers and financial holdings.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Okkmog]], chieftain of the Jade Skulls.
* [[Orinskar]], the [[ogre]] [[barbarian]] [[Cult of the Dragon|dragon cultist]].
