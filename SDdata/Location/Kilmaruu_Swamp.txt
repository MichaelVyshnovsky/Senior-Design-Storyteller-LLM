The '''Kilmaruu Swamp''' was a stretch of swamp and marshland located in southeast [[Halruaa]].

{{quote|''As the proverb goes, the Swamp of Kilmaruu keeps the numbers of fools in [[Zalasuu]] low.''|[[Matteo (Halruaa)|Matteo]] of the [[Jordaini College]]}}

==Description==
The swamp was the site of a ruined city. [[Undead]] constantly roamed the swamp and aging ruins, making appropriate defense forces in nearby towns and cities a necessity.

The Kilmaruu Swamp was a popular destination for [[adventurer]]s and treasure-seekers. Both groups hoped to stumble upon lost treasures buried by the murky swamp waters.
