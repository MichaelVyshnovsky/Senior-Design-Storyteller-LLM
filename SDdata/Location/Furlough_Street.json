        "Description": "Furlough Street was a heavily trafficked thoroughfare that runs directly north from the [[Fish market (Skullport)|Fish Market]] in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]]. It was known for its bustling activity, with ambitious shop owners and independent [[prostitute|escorts]] vying for the attention of passersby. These merchants and professionals loudly promoted the quality of their goods and services from open windows and the doorways of their shops and homes, adding to the vibrant, if chaotic, atmosphere of the street.\n\nFurlough Street was one of the few roads in the Lower Port that remained in relatively good condition. However, despite its upkeep, the street frequently became cluttered with rubbish, a byproduct of the dense population in the surrounding ward. The refuse was typically swept into the adjacent alleyways, where it accumulated until individuals either pay for its removal or take it upon themselves to clear it. This ongoing cycle of debris and removal was a common feature of life in the Lower Port, reflecting the district's lack of organized municipal services."
