        "mainbody": "Al-Anwahr was an ancient ruin found along the northern reaches of the Haunted Lands in a region known as the Burning Lands in Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nAl-Anwahr was found wedged between the blistering Great Anvil and the Sea of Salt.\nAl-Anwahr was a powerful city-state during the 5 century DR. At that time the lands surrounding the city were quite fertile, allowing the city to flourish in the surrounding harsh environment of interior Zakhara.\nAzaltin ibn Issad was the ruler of the city during this time of prosperity. Much of Al-Anwahr was destroyed during a civil war between Azaltin and his brother, Amakim.\nThe rulers of Muluk, the City of Kings, could trace their lineage back to Al-Anwahr."
