        "mainbody": "'''Iltkazar''' (the '''Mithral Kingdom''') was a subterranean [[dwarf|dwarven]] realm, originally one of the eight sub-kingdoms of [[Shanatar]], and known for its stone carving and engineering. The term \"Iltkazar\" came to describe more than just the original sub-kingdom, and by {{Yearlink|-1900}} it was used to describe a sub-kingdom of [[Calimshan]]. The Shanataran sub-kingdoms of [[Barakuir]], [[Drakkalor]], [[Holorarar]] and [[Ultoksamrin]] were located in Iltkazar, as well as [[Zokir]], City of Orbs.\n\nAs of 1371 DR, Iltkazar was mainly inhabited by shield dwarves, although populations of humans, rock gnomes, svirfneblin and urdunnirin also existed.\n\nIn its prime, Iltkazar had an estimated population of 7,506 (mostly [[shield dwarf|shield dwarves]]) and was ruled by a [[silver dragon]] known as [[Mithbarakaz|King Mith Barak the Clanless]], who spent seventy-five out of every hundred years sitting still as a solid mithral statue on his throne. During this time, the [[Regency Council of Iltkazar]] ruled the city. It was probably the best defended city in the [[Underdark]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|title=Shanatar's sub-kingdoms|author=Kiaransalyn|topicid=7524|date=2006-08-12|accessdate=2010-10-16}}\n\nIn [[1367 DR]] King Mith Barak's astral form was captured by Tiamat and he was only released in [[1477 DR]].  During his absence the city was ruled by regents."
