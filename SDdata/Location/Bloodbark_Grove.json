Unfortunately for him, Chalmers lost nearly half of his lords belongings during the journey.\nA single stone house could be found within the Bloodbark Grove. It was home to a hunter, his wife, and their son. At some point the young man went missing in the forest and was transformed into a fledgling vampire. Someone in the household was the proud owner of the warhammer that was falsely stated to have been the fabled Crom Faeyr.\nThe woods were full of dangerous creatures such as wolves, along with their dire and dread varieties, as well as greater basilisks and bombardier beetles. Even the plants of the grove were deadly, as evidenced by the resident shambling mounds.\nIt was also home to an elder druid named Onoroth."
