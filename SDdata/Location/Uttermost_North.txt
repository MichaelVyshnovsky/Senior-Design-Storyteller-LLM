The Uttermost North, also known as the Utter North, was a freezing region of Toril that spanned across the northern-most regions of the continent of Faerûn. It was nearly entirely inhospitable, with only a scattering of humanoid societies and places of note.
From the perspective of the people of the North, the Utter North comprised all the lands north of the Spine of the World mountains.
The predominant feature of the Uttermost North was the vast frozen wasteland of the Endless Ice Sea. There were only a few scattered points of interest found throughout the region, and some of those only existed as mere rumor or legend.
