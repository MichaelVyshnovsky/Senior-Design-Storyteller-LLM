Faenasuor was an ancient garrison city of the sea elf kingdom of Aryselmalyr, as well as one of the major sea elf colonies of the Sea of Fallen Stars in the 14 century DR.
The structures of this city were heavily encrusted in coral. It also held some of the most pristine and representative pieces of ancient Aryselmalyn art.
Faenasuor was located on the continental slopes east of Starmantle, approximately  north of that surface city, in an area that solely the sea elves referred to as the Lost Lands.
Faenasuor was originally founded in the year  by the kingdom of Aryselmalyr, albeit under another name that by the 14 century DR had long since been lost to time. In the year , the city was abandoned and over time it was buried by sea storms under tons of detritus and silt.
Around the 13 century DR, this garrison city was rediscovered and exacted by the High Mages of Sylkiir. By the year , it was officially resettled by sea elves and other students of history and was given the new name of Faenasuor. Many of these sea elves who settled at the city sought to profit off of the abundant pearl beds that surrounded it.
