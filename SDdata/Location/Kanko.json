        "History": "In ancient times, the Kanko volcano rose up out of Kang Bay and erupted; it was said that the very skies over Koryo caught fire. The land was devastated; the city of [[Bejung|Old Bejung]], closest to Kanko, was engulfed in poisonous gas that killed all the people, before the city itself was obliterated in a matter of seconds and buried in ash. According to legend, the entire Han clan sought shelter in the vast [[Dang Caverns]].For simplicity, these eruptions of Kanko have been merged; the intent behind the sourcebook was likely that these were part of a single event. Nevertheless, it is possible that Kanko erupted multiple times."
