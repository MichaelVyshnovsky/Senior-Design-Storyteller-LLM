        "mainbody": "calefathers Hollow was a winding cave found within the Vilebog swamp on Pirates Skyhold.\nThe hollow comprised a natural cave formation whose tunnels were added onto by non-naturally-occurring influences. Wooden support beams could be found alongside the caves moss-covered walls just as often as massive tree roots that extended underground from the swamp above.\nThe ceilings of the cave had many openings, allowing streams of water to trickle down from the wetlands, pooling within the cavern floor. A scant few of these holes allowed for columns of light to shine within, providing limited illumination in certain areas.\nIt was located in the southwest stretch of Vilebog, just west of the crash site of the Magisters Hope skyship.\nScalefathers Hollow was raided by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge in the , while under the employ of Company Yargo mercenary group.\nThe cave was named after the Scalefather, the shaman of the lizardfolk tribe that made their home within Vilebog swamp."
