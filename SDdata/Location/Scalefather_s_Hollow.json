        "mainbody": "'''Scalefather's Hollow''' was a winding cave found within the [[Vilebog]] swamp on [[Pirates' Skyhold]].",
        "Description": "The hollow comprised a natural cave formation whose tunnels were added onto by non-naturally-occurring influences. Wooden support beams could be found alongside the cave's [[moss]]-covered walls just as often as massive tree roots that extended underground from the swamp above.\n\nThe ceilings of the cave had many openings, allowing streams of water to trickle down from the wetlands, pooling within the cavern floor. A scant few of these holes allowed for columns of light to shine within, providing limited illumination in certain areas.",
        "Geography": "It was located in the southwest stretch of Vilebog, just west of the crash site of the ''[[Magister's Hope]]'' [[skyship]].",
        "History": "Scalefather's Hollow was raided by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, while under the employ of [[Company Yargo]] mercenary group.",
        "Inhabitants": "The cave was named after the [[Scalefather]], the [[shaman]] of the lizardfolk tribe that made their home within Vilebog swamp."
