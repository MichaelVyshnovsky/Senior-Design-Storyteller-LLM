The '''Forest Country''' (eventually also known as the '''Forest Kingdom''') was a forest basin southeast of the [[Stormhorns]] in the area later known as [[Cormyr]]. Mountains lie on the north, west and east sides of the forest, with an inlet of the [[Inner Sea]] to the south. This area was part of [[Cormanthor]] to the elves and would later become the nation of [[Cormyr]].

==Wildlife==
Originally, the forest was home to [[forest buffalo]], giant [[owlbear]]s, [[Puma|envenomed pumas]] and [[great ruq]]s, but these have long since been eliminated.

==History==
The [[elf|elves]] orginally settled and named it '''Lythtlorn'''{{Cite dragon/276/The New Adventures of Volo: Cormyrian Contracts|79}} and although it was somewhat separated from the main forest by the [[Thunder Peaks]], the elves considered it a part of [[Cormanthor]]. They used it as one of their hunting grounds before it was settled in the {{YearlinkName|6}}, by [[Ondeth Obarskyr]] and his immediate family. Twenty years later, the nation of [[Cormyr]] was founded and it included the Wolf Woods. After years of human habitation and clearing, the Wolf Woods was separated into three parts, the [[King's Forest]], the [[Hullack Forest]], and the [[Hermit's Wood]].{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|17}}

Around the {{YearlinkName|-400}}, the forest was occasionally raided by tribes of [[goblin]]s, and refugees from ancient [[Netheril]] sometimes made their way through.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Thauglor]], the Black Doom
