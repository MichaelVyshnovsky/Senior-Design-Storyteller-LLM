'''Yliyl''' was a minor oasis found in [[the Sword]] region of southern [[Anauroch]].

==Description==
The small hollow comprised a small pool of water surrounded by some [[palm]] trees and desert shrubs.

==Geography==
It was located in an isolated area of The Sword, west of the [[Hills of Scent]].

===Flora & Fauna===
The only notable animals to make their way to Yliyl were desert scavengers like [[jackal]]s and [[vulture]]s.

==History==
Long before the [[Era of Upheaval]], an entire tribe of [[Bedine]] perished from some unknown disease and were buried in the sands around Yliyl.

==Rumors & Legends==
Over the years, stories about the lost Bedine tribe were transformed into something else entirely. As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], these tales metamorphized into rumors about great treasure that was buried beneath the oasis.
