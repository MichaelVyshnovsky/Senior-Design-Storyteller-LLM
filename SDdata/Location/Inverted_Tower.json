        "mainbody": "The '''Inverted Tower''' was the center for the study of arcane magic in [[Szith Morcane]].",
        "Structure": "The stronghold was so named because of its unusual construction of rooms branching off from a tall, octagonal cavern. Without stairs connecting the various levels only those with capability to ''[[levitate]]'' or climb the smooth walls could navigate the Inverted Tower effectively.\n\nAmong the connecting rooms was a chamber for instructing students in the art of spellcraft and a room dedicated to the summoning of extraplanar creatures.",
        "Defences": "Boasting a complement of [[wizard]] [[fighter]]s known as the [[Arcane Guard]], the tower had additional protection in the form of a contingent ''[[guards and wards]]'' spell. This was keyed to activate whenever any creature entered the spire without speaking the password, \"''B'zadaara''\".",
        "History": "Despite the fall of [[House Morcane]] in [[1372 DR]] and the decline of [[drow]] in the region after the [[Silence of Lolth]], the Inverted Tower's insular community remained largely unaffected by the turmoil.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Solom Ned'razak]] - Head of the Inverted Tower\n* [[Susztam Mar-Shinn]] - Head Student\n* [[Nobruzzal]] - Student\n* [[Filzaur]] - Student"
