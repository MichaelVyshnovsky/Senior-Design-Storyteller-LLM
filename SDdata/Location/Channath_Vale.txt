The '''Channath Vale''' was a narrow stretch of land comprising a series of hills and forests that formed the southern edge of the [[Shaar]] where it met the [[North Wall]] mountains. It was a major caravan thoroughfare between the lands of [[Lapaliiya]] on the [[Shining Sea]] to the west and the [[Great Rift]] and [[Dambrath]] to the east.

As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], much of the Channath Vale was devastated by a changed climate, and was part of the eastern reaches of [[Elfharrow]].

==Geography==
The Channath Vale was a valley centered on the [[River Channath]] and [[River Talar]] as the former fed the latter flowing east-to-west. The region ran from the [[Channathwood]] and [[Rathgaunt Hills]] in the east to the [[Dun Hills (Lapaliiya)|Dun Hills]] in the west, and was bounded to the south by the North Wall, the [[Bandit Wastes]], and the [[Swagdar]], and to the north by the Shaar and [[Lake Lhespen]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|58}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 48: The Road to Khôltar, Part 1}}{{Cite web/EN World/RETHMAR, Rathole of the Shaar}} which passed through the south side of the Vale.

The region was hot and humid. It was notable for its three jungle-like forests: the Channathwood, the [[Misty Vale (forest)|Misty Vale]], and the [[Shaareach Forest]]. The Vale also encompassed a small mountain range known as the [[Wyrmbones]]

===Flora and Fauna===
Woodlands in the Channath Vale were densely overgrown with trees and vines, and edible [[berries]] and [[herb]]s could be found within. In the drier hills of the Vale, [[olive]] trees thrived. [[Avalathar]] trees were native to the area.

The Channath Vale was home to a wide array of [[animal]]s, such as [[baboon]]s, [[beguiler]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[deep bat]]s, [[dire ape]]s, [[dire boar]]s, [[dunscale]]s, [[giant eagle]]s, [[giant owl]]s, [[giant water spider]]s, [[goat]]s, [[hyena]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[snake]]s. More monstrous fauna included [[ankheg]]s, [[bulette]]s, [[chimera]]s, [[darkenbeast]]s, [[digester]]s, [[displacer beast]]s, [[ettercap]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[girallon]]s, [[griffon]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[krenshar]]s, [[leucrotta]]s, [[manticore]]s, [[nyth]]s, [[peryton]]s, [[phase spider]]s, [[spectral panther]]s, and [[tall mouther]]s.{{Cite web/Steal This Hook/A Place to Call Home}} [[Dragon]]s were also known to make their home in the Vale, notably [[bronze dragon|bronze]], [[green dragon|green]], and [[rattelyr dragon]]s.

Some areas of the Vale were haunted by [[undead]]&mdash;especially near the many Lapaliiyan tombs in the Dun Hills to the east. Such undead included [[allip]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[mohrg]]s, [[shadow]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[spectre]]s, [[vampire spawn]], [[wight]]s, [[wraith]]s, and [[zombie]]s.

==History==
Among [[halfling]]s, the Channath Vale was known as a land that produced great heroes.

The Vale became one of the easternmost holdings of the [[Shoon Imperium]] by {{Yearlink|300}}. When several Shaaran towns rebelled in the {{YearlinkName|435}}, this led to a brutal reprisal from [[Amahl Shoon VII]] against the region known as the [[Seven Burnings]] campaign: between {{Yearlink|438}} and {{Yearlink|440}}, Shoon armies rampaged through the communities of the Vale and killed or displaced many locals. Despite quelling the rebellion, the Shoon forces were soon forced to withdraw from the Shaar due to outside factors. The area was completely freed from Shoon rule by the end of the {{YearlinkName|451}}.

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the trade route through the Channath Vale was frequented by [[merchant]]s and [[pilgrim]]s, who in turn were attractive targets for the likes of [[gnoll]]s, [[slaver]]s, and [[bandit]]s. As of {{Yearlink|1373}}, the eastern end of the Vale was menaced by a number of raiders operating out of the [[Forest of Amtar]]. This included a motley force led by the [[ogre mage]] [[Tandith Tornears]], an unusually organized group of gnolls based in the [[Gate of Iron Fangs]], and a bandit gang known as the [[Reavers (Forest of Amtar)|Reavers]] led by the [[half-fiend]] [[Tanushk Versix]], Meanwhile, trade through the western end of the Vale was threatened by gnolls from the Wyrmbones being led by a chieftain known as the [[Wyrm Master]].

During the cataclysmic events of the [[Spellplague]] of {{Yearlink|1385}}, the eastern side of the Vale was swallowed by the [[Underchasm]]. Over the following twenty years, dramatic changes in climate caused the Channath Vale to dry out. The area became a veritable desert, with the Misty Vale coming to be known as the [[Dead Vale]] and the western half of the Channath Vale coming to be considered part of the wastes of Elfharrow.{{Cite web/EN World/Making Rethmar Come Alive}}

==Notable Locations== 
* [[Channathgate]], the easternmost town in the Vale located south of the Channathwood.
* [[Fryndul]], a [[gnome|gnomish]] village known for exporting cut [[gem]]s.{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|86-87}}
* [[Kormul]], a settlement located between the Misty Vale and the Shaareach Forest.
* [[Rethmar]], a city located between the Shaareach Forest and the Channathwood that was located atop natural springs. Rethmar survived the fallout of the Spellplague and subsequently grew as it accepted refugees.

==Inhabitants==
Prior to the Spellplague, several communities and small villages lay along the trade route that passed through the Vale, and survived by servicing the caravans that traveled through them. These settlements were populated notably by [[Shaaryan]] and [[Tashalan]] [[human]]s, [[Ghostwise halfling|ghostwise]] and [[strongheart halfling|strongheart]] halflings, gnomes, and [[wood elves]], and their populations could swell during the peak of caravan season. For food, these communities grew olives, farmed, herded goats, foraged local flora, and hunted. Their [[ranger]]s and [[warrior]]s patrolled the Vale day and night.

These communities had minimal contact with the inhabitants of the nearby woodlands: a reclusive and territorial tribe of ghostwise halflings in the Channathwood, and the [[yuan-ti]] that inhabited the waterways of the Shaareach Forest. such that it was not uncommon for other inhabitants to learn the [[gnoll language]]. The Vale was also known to be home to [[aranea]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[centaur]]s, [[doppelganger]]s, [[green abishai]], [[hill giant]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[hybsil]]s, [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[pterafolk]], [[satyr]]s, [[troll]]s, [[wereboar]]s, and [[weretiger]]s. Tribes of nomadic Shaaran humans also crossed into the Vale, herding goats and raiding caravans.

Following the Spellplague and the mass exodus of the wild elves from the dying Misty Vale, these elves became the dominant force from the coast of the Shining Sea to the North Wall. They coexisted tentatively with centaur tribes who had fled to the area from the [[Shaar Desolation]].
