The '''Dragon Wood''' was a wooded ravine deep in the [[Evermoors]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. It got its name from the unusual megalith that floated at its center, called the [[Sleeping Dragon (artifact)|Sleeping Dragon]].{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|88}}

==Location==
Dragon Wood was located about five days' travel due west of [[Everlund]] through the [[Silverwood]] and the eastern Evermoors. It was in a sinuous ravine about three miles (4.8 kilometers) long.

==Description==
{{Fq|text=Much as it pains me to dash minstrels' hopes, it must be said this much has been learned: the curving ridge is simply rock, not a creature—petrified or otherwise—at all.|source=[[Elminster]]|width=340px}}
Closely spaced [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] and [[shadowtop]] trees were the primary flora in the Wood, except for the immediate area surrounding the Sleeping Dragon which was barren. The artifact floated above a rocky ridge that resembled the curved spine of a subterranean serpent.

Animal life in the ravine was mostly small birds and mammals. Strangely, no predators larger than a fox ever stayed in or even passed through the Dragon Wood.{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|90}}
* "The wyrm! The wyrm comes!"
* "The seventh hand upon the door opens all &hellip;"
* "The skull's green eye watches unblinking."
* "There is yet another [[moonblade]], this one flying awake and aware."

==Defenses==
The ravine containing the Dragon Wood radiated strong [[transmutation]] magic and was enchanted with some form of conditional ''[[teleport]]ation'' spell that gently removed large animals from the vicinity and placed them fifty to five hundred miles (eighty to eight hundred kilometers) away.{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|89}} Occasionally, the whole ravine glowed with painful ''[[witchfire]]'', or reverberated with a song that seemed to come from some other [[plane]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The Dragon Wood had a reputation for being haunted, mainly because of the magic guarding it, and the flicking away of large predators, but also for the whispered words that were occasionally heard. Even [[troll]]s and [[giant]]s avoided settling here. The same fate was meted out to anyone attacking the Sleeping Dragon, either physically or magically.

==Notable Inhabitants==
A band of [[pixie]]s made their home in Dragon Wood and enjoyed playing tricks on those that came to examine the Sleeping Dragon.{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|90}}
