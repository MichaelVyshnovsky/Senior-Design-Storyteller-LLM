        "mainbody": "Anauril, also known as the City of Swords was the one of the cities of ancient Anauria.\nThe city was located northeast of Amazandar the capital of Anauria, just due west of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba.\nAnauril was famous for the great quality steels swords crafted by the finest smiths in all the lands north of the Moonsea. They were often granted enchantments by the mages of House Nyntynel and House Olyrnn.\nThe city was founded some time after Netherils fall in , as the enclave of Anauria grew into a grand kingdom.\nIn the , goblinoid and orcish forces led by the shaman Andegril the Wise, caused the collapse of the kingdom of Anauria and all of the cities within.According to pages 116 of Netheril Empire of Magic The Winds of Netheril, this event occurred in 450 DR. This is direct conflict with a statement on page 12 of the same book that says the kingdom fell in 3970 Netheril Year, or 111 DR. Nearly all of the orcs besieging the city were slain at the hands of Anaurils skilled warriors, their corpses splain by the citys famed blades.\nCenturies after the citys fall, it remained protected by the many sword wraiths that haunted its ruins."
