Singye authorities offered a reward to any who could eliminate the menace.\n\nIn that year, following battles between Koryoan troops and advance forces of [[Kozakura]] around [[Karak]] in the south, around a thousand refugees fled to Singye and camped outside the city.",
        "Inhabitants": "Singye was home to the [[wu jen]] [[Yuraka]], owner of the last known scroll case of the ''[[Ky Trencha Ukang]]''."
