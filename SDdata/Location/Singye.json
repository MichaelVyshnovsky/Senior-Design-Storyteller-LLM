        "mainbody": "Singye was a city in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.\nSingye lay at the edge of the great Quang Muku Forest, by the sea.\nETyon Bay lay just north of Singye.\nBy 1357 DR, ETyon Bay had become infested by tigerworms, which sunk four fishing boats and a merchant ship. Singye authorities offered a reward to any who could eliminate the menace.\nIn that year, following battles between Koryoan troops and advance forces of Kozakura around Karak in the south, around a thousand refugees fled to Singye and camped outside the city.\nSingye was home to the wu jen Yuraka, owner of the last known scroll case of the Ky Trencha Ukang."
