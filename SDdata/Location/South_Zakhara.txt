South Zakhara comprised the central part of the Crowded Sea with myriad islands, most of them within three large archipelagoes where civilization gave way more and more to the untamed wild and its mysteries Nada al-Hazan, the Steaming Isles, and the Islands of the Utter South.
Away to the north, on both sides of the Golden Gulf, lay south Zakharas most important trading partners in the Cities of the Pantheon and especially the Pearl Cities. To the east, the nearest neighbor was the large isle of Harab, to the west there were the archipelagoes of Jazayir al-Sartan and the Djinnis Claws. To the south lay only the endless expanse of the uncharted Southern Ocean.
Also called the Silver Road, this chain of islands was the entry way to the Crowded Sea from the north, with the town of Bandar al-Saadat functioning as de facto capital and trading center. Civilization declined along the chains length from the islands Masud Jazayir to al-Zabdiyat, Tawil, Dirs, and Jazirat al-Sayyad with the unpredictable whirlpool Jazirat al-Gawwar at the end.
The Steaming Isles, unexplored by denizens of the mainland, were shrouded in mist and covered in sub-tropical forest. This archipelago of six large and many smaller islands was inhabited and ruled by intelligent, talking animals.
Furthest removed from the mainland, this group of low, often jungle-covered unnamed islands stretched the whole breadth of the Crowded Sea from west to east in an irregular chain.
