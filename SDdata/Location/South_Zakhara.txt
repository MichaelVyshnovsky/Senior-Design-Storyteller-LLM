'''South [[Zakhara]]''' comprised the central part of the [[Crowded Sea]] with myriad islands, most of them within three large archipelagoes where civilization gave way more and more to the untamed wild and its mysteries: [[Nada al-Hazan]], the [[Steaming Isles]], and the Islands of the Utter South.<ref><ref>

==Geographic limits==
Away to the [[Interior Zakhara|north]], on both sides of the [[Golden Gulf]], lay south Zakhara's most important trading partners in the [[Cities of the Pantheon]] and especially the [[Pearl Cities]]. To the [[Southeast Zakhara|east]], the nearest neighbor was the large isle of [[Harab]], to the [[Southwest Zakhara|west]] there were the archipelagoes of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]] and the [[Djinni's Claws]].<ref><ref> To the south lay only the endless expanse of the uncharted [[Southern Ocean]].<ref>

==Nada al-Hazan==
{{Main|Nada al-Hazan}}
Also called the Silver Road, this chain of islands was the entry way to the Crowded Sea from the north, with the town of [[Bandar al-Sa'adat]] functioning as ''de facto'' capital and trading center. Civilization declined along the chain's length from the islands [[Masud Jazayir]] to [[al-Zabdiyat]], [[Tawil]], [[Dirs]], and [[Jazirat al-Sayyad]] with the unpredictable whirlpool [[Jazirat al-Gawwar]] at the end.<ref>

==The Steaming Isles==
{{Main|Steaming Isles}}
The Steaming Isles, unexplored by denizens of the mainland, were shrouded in mist and covered in sub-tropical forest. This archipelago of six large and many smaller islands was inhabited and ruled by intelligent, talking animals.<ref>

==Islands of the Utter South==
Furthest removed from the mainland, this group of low, often jungle-covered unnamed islands stretched the whole breadth of the Crowded Sea from west to east in an irregular chain.
