Cuardin was a small farming town on Gwynneth, adjacent to a forest that surrounded the Myrloch Vale. Sometime between the 3 and 8 centuries DR, its inhabitants took part in a battle against a Northlander raiding party, in which the legendary tools of the common man were created and played a decisive part.
Prior to their conflict with the Northlanders, Cuardin had no access to any weapons besides repurposed farming equipment.
The people of Cuardin were farmers and herders, and were known to keep goats.
Notable among Cuardins populace were the original bearers of the tools of the common man Shod, a courageous goat herder who rallied the community into standing up to the Northlanders, wielder of the shepherd staff Gabe, the quiet but powerful wielder of the shovel and Boric, the wise elderly stable worker, wielder of the pitchfork.
