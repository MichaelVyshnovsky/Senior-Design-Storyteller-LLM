        "mainbody": "rows End  was a district in Ravens Bluff located in the central and eastern side of the city, wrapped around Clearwater Harbor, north of the Fire River. It was a diverse region of the city, the neighborhoods of which varied between driving the robust Ravenian economy, housing its efficient but rather mundane businesses, and acting as little more than a holding area for the citys poorest and filthiest dregs. \nWhile some regions of Crows End were frequented by just about every shipping merchant, guild artisan, and foreign emissary, some locales were dreary and lifeless and yet other streets were littered with clotheslines and refuse, and possessed the distinct smell of rotted fish. \nKnown by some Ravenians as the \"heart and soul\" of the city, the neighborhood of Anvil was where the business of the Bluff took place. All the goods brought in from the docks, which would remain in the city, were taken to the Central Warehouse Registry for inspection, packing, and labeling before they were hurried off to the many warehouses, most of which were located in the streets of the Shutters. The City Watch maintained a strong presence in Anvil as they made sure all city business was on the level.\nLocated on the eastern shore of the harbor, this neighborhood was quiet and boring compared to the busy and dynamic streets of Anvil. While it had few locations that provided entertainment or pleasure for the citys citizens, its importance lay in the fact that it housed a number of quiet, dull, yet crucial businesses. Despite this, it was home to the especially popular bakery, Downunda Patisserie, run by Jemima Chisolm.\nEasily the poorest place in all of Ravens Bluff, the streets immediately north of the Fire River were full of squalor and filth. The rotting, unfinished wooden houses that lined Riverview Road were plagued by the smell of mildew and dead fish. Urchins and rats ran rampant in the main roads of Shadystreets, and its darkest corners were home to thieves and other neer-do-wells.\nThis part of Crows End earned its name from the vast number of shuttered warehouses that lined the streets just south of the Fire River. Despite the handful of businesses that were scattered among the many rows of storerooms, few Ravenians frequented this part of Ravens Bluff south of the Ravensbridge, save for the guards who had been hired to protect the goods of the citys merchants.\n*Markas Bruno, a suspected leader of the Black Talon gang of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR."
