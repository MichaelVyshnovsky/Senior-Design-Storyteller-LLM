Closer toward the coast of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free Cities]], authority over the [[Wizard's Reach]] toward the north and the group of three islands—[[the Bird]], [[the Dancer]] and [[the Fortress]]—to the south, were disputed between the [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]] and the mainland cities.\n\nThe vast open stretch of the Great Sea separated northwest Zakhara from [[Faerûn]] in the north and [[Maztica]] in the west.<ref> The islands of Lahib and Dahab marked the southern border toward [[west Zakhara]].",

Several villages and one city could be found at the shores of the Genie's Turban.",

Many of its buildings rested on stilts around and within [[Chaos Bay]] at the [[Island of Firethorns]].
