        "Geography": "The outpost was located somewhere beneath the Stonelands, under an [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient Netherese tomb]] and [[Daeronnax]]'s lair. It was on the upper edge of the [[Underdark]] as it merged with various surface-level cave systems. It was connected by a ''[[portal]]'' to the city of [[Sschindylryn]], from which the [[drow]] forces originated. A group of [[lizardfolk]] lived nearby, with a distinctly unfriendly attitude to the drow.",
        "History": "During the 1480s [[DR]], the base was controlled by Mistress [[Laerion'vyr]], a high priestess of [[Lolth]]. She commanded a sizable detachment of soldiers, [[wizard]]s, [[priestess]]es, [[skeleton]]s, and [[drider]]s. A team of ritualists were led by the summoner [[Vur'din]], who produced a great number of servile [[Red slaad|red]], [[Blue slaad|blue]], and [[green slaad]]i, and the powerful [[gray slaad]] [[Il'tharis the Terrible]]. When the [[adventurer]] [[Popkin Shortshanks]] put out a call for assistance nearby, her allies may have discovered the outpost and attacked the drow."
