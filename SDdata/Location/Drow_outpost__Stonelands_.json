        "mainbody": "A drow outpost beneath the Stonelands was used as a base of House Avithoul in the late 15 century DR.\nThe outpost was located somewhere beneath the Stonelands, under an ancient Netherese tomb and Daeronnaxs lair. It was on the upper edge of the Underdark as it merged with various surface-level cave systems. It was connected by a portal to the city of Sschindylryn, from which the drow forces originated. A group of lizardfolk lived nearby, with a distinctly unfriendly attitude to the drow.\nDuring the 1480s DR, the base was controlled by Mistress Laerionvyr, a high priestess of Lolth. She commanded a sizable detachment of soldiers, wizards, priestesses, skeletons, and driders. A team of ritualists were led by the summoner Vurdin, who produced a great number of servile red, blue, and green slaadi, and the powerful gray slaad Iltharis the Terrible. When the adventurer Popkin Shortshanks put out a call for assistance nearby, her allies may have discovered the outpost and attacked the drow."
