        "mainbody": "High Hedge was the home of the wizard Thalantyr, which was situated northwest of Beregost.\nThalantyr the Conjurers estate was a dark, turreted stone building overgrown with pines. It overlooked a pond, which the wizard used to sit near and speak to something beneath the surface.\nThe house was defended by two griffons, who were a mating pair and strongly loyal to Thalantyr. His home was also protected by an invisible servant, who was known to spy and deliver information and objects to the wizard."
