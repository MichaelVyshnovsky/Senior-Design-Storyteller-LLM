}}'''Ysawis''' was a ruined city of the [[Nog|Nog Empire]] found buried in the heart of the [[Grey Jungle]] within the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] of [[Zakhara|east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Ysawis was a shadow of its former self in 1367, despite the efforts of its rulers and their horde of [[undead]] workers to restore the city to a glorified state.

Strangely enough, the most striking feature of the city was not a piece of architecture, but the hordes of undead who constantly roamed the city in morose silence performing tasks given to them by their superiors. These undead workers halted their tasks every day at sundown and moved into the nearest building to lay down for the night. This seemingly strange behavior served not to allow the undead to rest, but to make them more efficient at their tasks for their necromancer masters quickly learned that they were not nearly as effective in darkness.

The most impressive physical structure found within Ysawis was the [[Jade Palace of the Necromancers]].

Even after Ysawis' fall, several grand mosques still stood including those to [[Kiga]] and [[Ragarra]] as well as a shrine to [[Shajar]].

==Inhabitants==
An estimated 5,000 undead inhabited Ysawis, with the vast majority of these creatures being [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s. It was believed that the [[necromancer]]s who ruled the city added to their grisly population on a daily basis. The undead performed a variety of tasks during the daytime hours including clearing rubble, trimming vegetation, and building new structures. Each night the undead ceased their labors and shuffled into the nearest building until morning when their routine began anew.

===Leadership===
[[Sumulael]] and [[Kazerabet]], a pair of skilled [[necromancer]]s, ruled the ruins of Ysawis. Their prime goal was to return the ruins into a fully rebuilt city for them to lord over.

===The Court===
Though not a permanent inhabitant of the city, one of Ysawis' most influential residents was a mysterious merchant named [[Barak al-Gani]] because he provided the city with everything they needed to grow and rebuild.

The necromancers were aided in their administrative tasks by a [[lich]] named [[Shalmaneser]]. Shalmaneser oversaw the daily routines the city required.

[[Netocris bin Shalah]] served as an emissary of the [[yuan-ti]] population found in the Grey Jungle. This [[Yuan-ti pureblood|pureblood]] often masqueraded as a human merchant.

==Trade==
Though Ysawis did not produce goods of any kind, the rulers of the city often traded in slaves and antiquities in order to procure amenities.

==Defenses==
Before even dreaming of attacking Ysawis, any invading force first needed to successfully navigate their way through the dense jungle surrounding the city. Along the way they would encounter carnivorous [[jungle giant]]s, [[yuan-ti]], and many soldiers risked falling to the dreaded [[Grey Fever]] known to plague the region.

Hundreds of [[juju zombie]]s and other elite undead guarded the Jade Palace, but the entire poplulation of Ysawis could be called upon to protect the city during an attack.

==History==
The city of Ysawis was sacked by devout followers of [[Shajar]], the [[Zakharan pantheon|savage]] Zakharan god of the [[Nogaro River]]. Shajar's followers attacked the city in reprisal for Ysawis' princess [[Zoraya]]'s theft of their [[Talisman of Shajar]]. They ransacked the entire city searching for their lost artifact but never found it.

==Rumors & Legends==
Despite the physical isolation of Ysawis from the outside world, Sumalael and Kazerabet enjoyed exerting their influence over [[Dihliz]] and [[Kadarasto]] through an extensive spy network.
