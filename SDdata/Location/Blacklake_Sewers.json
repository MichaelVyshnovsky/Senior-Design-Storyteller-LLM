        "mainbody": "The Blacklake Sewers were the sewer system beneath the Blacklake District of Neverwinter.\nMost of the sewer system of Neverwinter was destroyed during the Ruining of 1451 DR, as many buildings collapsed over their foundations, leaving a maze of precarious wreckage and treacherous tunnels. The Blacklake Sewers survived the Ruining mostly unscathed, however.\nAround 1479 DR, the Dead Rats cell of Neverwinter had taken control of most of the sewer system of the Blacklake District.\n* Rsolk"
