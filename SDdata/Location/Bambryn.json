        "mainbody": "'''Bambryn''' was a [[village]] in [[the Vast]], lying on the crossroads of the [[Hlintar Ride]], between [[Hlintar]] and [[Dark Hollow]], and the [[Long Reach]], between [[Sendrin]] and [[Orlimmin]].{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part One|13-14}}",
        "History": "During the early [[the Vast#The Time of Glorious Fools|Time of Glorious Fools]], after [[human]]s first settled the central Vast in the mid–7{{th}} century [[DR]], the vengeful bandit [[Iljack|Iljack of the Black Blade]] plagued the central Vast. He made Bambryn his base of operations.\n\nBambryn was a wealthy village by the mid-to-late 14.",
        "Description": "Bambryn was a way-village marked by its rural beauty and common hedgerows. There were many [[horse]]-ranches and farms. There were manor houses belonging to the wealthy merchants and [[adventurer]]s who settled there; these houses were protected by hired guards and war-[[dog]]s.",
        "Economy": "Thanks to its proximity to local trade-routes, Bambryn was popular with merchants and adventurers, particularly those who'd been successful but not fully retired. It was a wealthy village, but this was largely invested in agriculture. Bambryn produced quality [[horse]]s and luxury crops, like [[flower]]s, [[truffle]]s, and other exotic [[fungi]]. These plants were kept fresh with [[cantrip]]s prior to export.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Iljack of the Black Blade was widely thought to have hidden his loot somewhere in Bambryn, but it was never located. Once, a tree fell over in a storm, revealing a stone marked with a black sword buried beneath. However, there was no treasure underneath, just another stone carrying the message \"Moved it all. See me for your share.\" and another black sword symbol."
