Eylea was a small city somewhere in Faer√ªn in the 14 century DR.As Eylea is only mentioned in "The Living City" in Polyhedron #56 and is not marked on any map, it is unknown where in the Realms it actually is. Given Dugals travels, it might lie somewhere around Sembia or the Vast, but this is only an assumption. Moreover, as a "small city", Eylea might be more of a large town, hence a lack of notability, and it couldve been destroyed or abandoned after the attack. Incidentally, "Eylea" is also the name of a palace-temple in the 1986 adventure module Ravager of Time, but there are no other connections, so this seems entirely coincidental.
It was protected by Eylea Keep and was the base of the Avante Guard adventuring company.
After leaving Yhaunn in Sembia, the young wizard and would-be adventurer Black Dugal Buchannan went to Eylea to join the Avante Guard, but was declined for his lack of experience. Thus, Dugal joined the Eylea Keep garrison instead as a journeyman wizard, where he served for two years.
After the Avante Guard destroyed a temple used by an obscure cult circa 1340 DR, the cultists sent their minions and hired mercenaries, including ogres, trolls, drow, and even demons, against Eylea. The attack raged for two days before it was routed, leaving many dead. Sickened by battle, Dugal became a pacifist and retired, later establishing Black Dugals Music Shoppe in Ravens Bluff by around 1357 DR.
