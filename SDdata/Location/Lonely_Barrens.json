        "mainbody": "The '''Lonely Barrens''' was a craggy and secluded area located to the south from [[Delimbiyr River]] and east from [[Daggerford]] and its [[Eastern Farmlands]] on [[Saeraethra's Stream]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-02-06 - Saeraethra's Stream}}\n\n{{quote|''What a bleak landscape this is. I suppose that's why it's called the Lonely Barrens. The occupant of that tower obviously prefers solitude.''|[[Raegen Brunegar]]}}",
        "Description": "The Lonely Barrens laid around six hours of trek through the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] from the city of Daggerford. The region was secluded and almost inhabitant, characterized by outcroppings of high and dangerous crags. Several smaller streams cascaded off the high edges into the wild rivers running along the crag floors. The Barrens had thick forests growing on its top levels with an occasional natural cavern of chasm.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], one of the cavers in the Lonely Barrens became a home for dangerous and smart foe, known as the [[Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor]]. Aspirant knights from the [[Order of Tye]] of [[Waterdeep]], Squire [[Blancheflor]], Squire [[Launfal]], and Squire [[Camelon]], were sent to slay the terrible beast but were unable to handle the creature's horrific [[rat]] swarms. They found themselves shivering and crying outside of the rat warrens until aided by the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The adventurer bravely defeated the rat swarm and rid the Lonely Barrens of the cunning brain-devouring talking rat.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Edalseye's Tower]]: the lone tower that rose from a crag, cut off from the rest of the Lonely Barrens by a deep chasm that encircled the structure and accessible via a ''[[gate]]'' created by the tower's hermit [[wizard]].",
        "Inhabitants": "*[[Deldarine]]: a young [[elf|elven]] ward of a planeswalker wizard of the Edalseye's Tower.\n*[[Edalseye]]: a hermit planeswaking wizards master of the Lonely Barrens Tower.\n*[[Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor]]: the intelligent leader of hungry carnivorous rat swarm ''circa'' 1372 DR.\n*[[Skully]]: Edalseye's pet floating skull who bore an uncanny resemblance to a certain mimir from the planar city of [[Sigil]]."
