The community of '''Kond''' was carved into the steep cliffs along the southern side of the [[Clefts of Razack]] above the [[Beaumaris River]] in [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} 

==Description==
It served as a stop for trade goods that had been floated down the Beaumaris from [[Moortown]]. The folk used an ingenious system of winches and [[pulley]]s, along with magic from some [[warlock]]s, to get the goods up the {{SIAdj|500|foot|long=yes}} cliff face to the wagons waiting at the rim.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} 

==History==
Kond was originally a delve for [[minotaur]]s, but they were routed in the {{YearlinkName|1453}} by the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was a waypoint along the [[Dead Man's Walk]], which scaled up from the canyon floor to the west to the top of the cliffs to the east.
