        "mainbody": "'''Utgard''' was a major [[giant]] fortress and city in [[Jotunheim]], the land of giants in the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]].",
        "Government": "This city was ruled by King [[Utgard-Loki]],{{Cite dragon/90/Plane Facts on Gladsheim|37}}{{Cite dragon/110/For Better or Norse: I|22}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|17,23}} an incredibly powerful [[cleric]] and [[illusionist]], as well as a son of the [[Giant pantheon|Giant power]] [[Thrym]]. The city was additionally ruled over by a council of jarls. This council was kept in-line by the King through a combination of sheer force of will and cunning wit, rather than the tactic of mere brute strength that many other [[frost giant]]s relied upon. One of these jarls was [[Habrok Icecaster]], a nephew of Utgard-Loki.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|17}}\n\nThe ruler sat upon the ''Skull-Throne of Ymir'', a throne that had been carved from a {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} tall skull carved, though it had once belonged to the city of [[Meerrauk]]. The throne held great symbolic significance to the giants of Jotunheim, imparting a sense of authority upon those that owned it.",
        "Defenses": "Utgard was a heavily defended and well camouflaged city, owing to the powerful [[divine magic]] and [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[illusion]]s of its ruler.",
        "History": "At some point giants ambushed a [[movanic deva]] that they came to name [[Silverwing]]. They crushed his wings under rocks and [[chain]]ed him to a high table in Utgard, keeping him prisoner as a sort of jester for many years. Over time it became believed that the deva's regularly molting feathers were good-luck charms. One of these feathers would make its way into the possession of the frost giant [[Brimir]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|24}}\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the deva was still being held captive within the walls of Utgard.The imprisoned deva mentioned in ''Three Coins in a Well'' is unnamed, but is presumed to be the same deva that was described in the Planescape boxset ''Planes of Chaos'' as being a prisoner in the city of Utgard. [[Torheim]], a [[proxy]] of the [[Norse pantheon|Norse power]] [[Thor]], came to learn about this imprisoned deva and scouted the area around the city{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|23}} in hopes of infiltrating it and rescuing the [[angel]]. Around this same time a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]], a city on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]], traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} While traveling through Jotunheim they heard of Utgard and its ruler from both giants and Torheim alike. The latter asked of the heroes if they could break into [[Okalnir|Brimir's hall]] and steal the deva feather from him, as having it would make it much easier for Torheim to track the deva down inside the city.",
        "Inhabitants": "Utgard was primarily inhabited by giants, who did not act too friendly to smaller races. Notably, the deity Thrym's own personal court of jarls occasionally stopped by to visit the city."
