        "mainbody": "'''The Forlorn Cliffs''' was a once well-traveled [[Middledark]] portal nexus that connected various parts of [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "The Forlorn Cliffs were located in a group of massive caverns and allowed the travelers to traverse them via many winding cliff pathways illuminated by luminescent fungi and enchanted brazers of ''[[continual faerie fire]]'' leftover from the region glory days. The bottom of the deep caverns was littered with sharp rock formations and giant Underdark [[mushroom]]s. The pathways intertwined and intercepted and occasionally led to bigger naturally-formed rock platforms. The entire area was littered with portals and ''[[gate]]''s that were used in the past to quicken the underground travel. In late 15{{th}} century DR, many of the portals were corrupted, destroyed, or forgotten. [[Cave moss]] grew in this region in abundance.",
        "Geography": "[[File:Forlorn cliffs map.png|thumb|''A map depicting the location of the Forlorn Cliffs.'']]\nOne of the many portals of the Forlorn Cliffs led to the ancient [[Rhylfang's Lair]] in the [[Evermoors]].\n\nAnother portal of note was hidden behind a complex rune-lock and eventually led to [[Gracklstugh]].",
        "Notable Locations": "*Abandoned dig site - the long-abandoned area that was used by [[Torga Burduum]] and her [[dwarf|dwarven]] smiths to excavate the massive ancient vault doors to Izzaxu's Kiln.\n*[[Izzaxu's Kiln]] - the ancient [[drow]] summoning chambers, home of many horrors, and the creature bound to the Kiln, [[Izzaxu]] itself.",
        "Inhabitants": "Since the region abandoned by most travelers, the area became infested with the dangerous wildlife of the Underdark and ''circa'' [[1490 DR]], drow Cult of [[Belaphoss]] and their summoned [[fiend]]s resided in the Forlorn Cliffs. The monsters in the area included [[gelatinous cube]]s, [[umber hulk]]s, and [[hook horror]]s. Straggling [[duergar]]s and [[derro]] could be found in the area as well as the cult's [[quasit]]s, [[hezrou]], [[dretch]]es, and [[succubus|succubi]].\n\nAn insane derro [[Izhkin]], a companion of the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]], made home in the abandoned camp of [[Tezzarae]] in the Cliffs ''circa'' [[1490 DR]].\n\nAn [[imp]] named [[Gliuxni]] made home in the Forlorn Cliffs ''circa'' [[1490 DR]], as well as a cursed refugee [[Perren]].\n\nThe [[ghosts]] of Torga Burduum and her dwarven comrades were bound to the Kiln located deep in the Forlorn Cliffs. The same caves were homes to summoned hezrou, quasits, dretches, and [[blazing skeleton]]s, as well as the local wildlife that found a way into the Kiln - umber hulks, and hook horrors. Izzaxu's Kiln was home to Izzaxu until ''circa'' [[1490 DR]]."
