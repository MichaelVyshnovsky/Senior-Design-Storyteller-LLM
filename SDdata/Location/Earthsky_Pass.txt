Earthsky Pass was a valley and mountain pass located deep in the heart of the Omlarandin Mountains.
The area was steeply-sloped and heavily wooded. Two streams of water winded through narrow canyons, eventually joining together at the northern extent of the valleys floor, and from there traveled down Earthsky Pass until exiting out its southern end.
In the 14 century DR, the only sentient races to make semi-permanently inhabit Earthsky Pass was a community of alaghi, who made their homes within four shallow caves high above the valley floor. 
* Chapel of the Blooded Moon, a chapter house of the Knights of the Crescent Moon, was located on a hill between the two creek beds. It was later entombed beneath an avalanche of mud and rock.
In the , following the disbanding of the Knights of the Crescent Moon, the siege engineers of the Chapel of the Blooded Moon deliberately caused a landslide in the valley to bury their isolated redoubt. As the centuries passed, the area where the landslide had occurred was reclaimed by nature, reverting to a natural state and leaving no trace of the knights.
At some point in the 14 century DR, the alaghi living in the valley uncovered an ancient, buried brass coffer containing seven chased silver wrist-bracers, bejeweled in sapphires and turquoise, from the fallen kingdom of Tathtar.
Centuries later, in 1370 DR, a group known as the Doom Brigade came to Earthsky Pass in search of the buried chapel. They came into conflict with the only alagi, decimating their ranks, when they dared to investigate their diggings. The Doom Brigade dug a cave, angled at a sharp 40 degrees, granting them access to the catacombs beneath the buried chapel, known as the Halls of the Sleeping Legion.
