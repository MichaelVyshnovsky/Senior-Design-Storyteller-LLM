'''Shilku''' was a ruined coastal town in [[Chult]], located in the [[Shilku Bay|bay]] south of the [[Kobold Mountains]]. It was less than 50 miles (80 km) from [[Wyrmheart Mine]] in the north and about 100 miles (160 km) from the [[Valley of Lost Honor]].<ref name="ToA-p39" ><ref name="ToA-p82" >

==Description==
In the years following its decimation, many of Skilku's buildings were encased in volcanic rock.

==History==
Some time before the end of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the town was decimated by activity from the nearby volcanoes. In a unique turn of events, the town was actually entirely preserved by the volcanic activity.

==Inhabitants==
After its destruction, Shilku no longer housed any [[human]] inhabitants. It was since overrun by fire-loving creatures such as [[mephit]]s, [[firenewt]]s, and [[salamander]]s, among others.
