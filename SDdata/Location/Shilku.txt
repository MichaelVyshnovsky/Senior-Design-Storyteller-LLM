Town
Shilku was a ruined coastal town in Chult, located in the bay south of the Kobold Mountains. It was less than 50 miles (80 km) from Wyrmheart Mine in the north and about 100 miles (160 km) from the Valley of Lost Honor.
In the years following its decimation, many of Skilkus buildings were encased in volcanic rock.
Some time before the end of the 15 century DR, the town was decimated by activity from the nearby volcanoes. In a unique turn of events, the town was actually entirely preserved by the volcanic activity.
After its destruction, Shilku no longer housed any human inhabitants. It was since overrun by fire-loving creatures such as mephits, firenewts, and salamanders, among others.
