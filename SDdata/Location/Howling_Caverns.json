By the late 14 century DR, they had collapsed.\nThe labyrinth joined various meltwater caverns wind constantly moaned through them, giving them their name.\nIn the late 10 century DR, Meldryn Jalensifer lured the Magister, a black dragon named Constulgrael, to the location with a rumor and ambushed him, slaying him and claiming the mantle of the Magister for himself.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the caverns had collapsed.\nTo lure Constulgrael, Meldryn had spread the rumor of an ancient draconic crypt, belonging to a sorcerous dragon and full of spells unique to dragons. Some sources implied that the caverns may have in fact been dug by dragons."
