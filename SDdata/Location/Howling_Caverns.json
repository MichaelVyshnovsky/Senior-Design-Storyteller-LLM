        "mainbody": "The '''Howling Caverns''' were a network of tunnels beneath the [[Orsraun Mountains]]; by the late 10{{th}} century [[DR]], they were mostly large enough even for the largest [[dragon]]s to move in. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they had collapsed.",
        "Description": "The labyrinth joined various meltwater caverns; wind constantly moaned through them, giving them their name.",
        "History": "In the late 10{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Meldryn Jalensifer]] lured the [[Magister]], a [[black dragon]] named [[Constulgrael]], to the location with a rumor and ambushed him, slaying him and claiming the mantle of the Magister for himself.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the caverns had collapsed.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "To lure Constulgrael, Meldryn had spread the rumor of an ancient draconic crypt, belonging to a sorcerous dragon and full of spells unique to dragons. Some sources implied that the caverns may have in fact been dug by dragons."
