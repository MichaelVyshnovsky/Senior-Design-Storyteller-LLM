The '''Dai River''' was a river located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
The Dai River was located in [[Kodo Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. The river cut through the Inner City of the imperial capital of [[Dojyu]]. As the river flowed out of the city, it carried pollution from the industries located in the Fourth Ward. The country estates of the nobility were located along the banks of the river upstream of the city.
