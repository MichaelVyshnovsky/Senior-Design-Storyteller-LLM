}}The '''Trade Harbor''' was located in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, along the banks of [[Al-Sarif River]].

==Description==
This large harbor had enough docks to support 40 [[galley]]s or [[dromond]]s with an additional 75 [[cog]]s. All of the docks were well-maintained to accommodate the constant influx of vessels.

==Activities==
A constant bustle of activity permeated every available space of the Trade Harbor. This section of Huzuz acted like a small city, with many of the thousands of workers never even leaving the area during their lifetimes.

Each incoming ship had their wares assessed by a tax collector to determine the tax to be paid. After paying the tax, the ship was assigned a dock where they could unload their merchandise. Since the Trade Harbor was crammed at times, [[marid]]s were often used to pull ships to their docks.

==Inhabitants==
Many of the wealthy merchant families employed [[genie]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[giant]]s to facilitate the movement of trade goods.

Several platoons of the [[Dauntless Mamluk Society]] were always present around the docks to maintain security and apprehend thieves for justice.
