'''Ilthan''' was an island in the [[Pirate Isles]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Description==
There were several harbors on the island, mainly situated along the southern edge. There were no major settlements, as the storms that occurred during the winter were so severe they tended to destroy most buildings.

The most prominent feature of Ilthan was a city, built of stone and fallen into ruin, that stood in the center of the island,<ref group="note">''[[Pirates of the Fallen Stars]]'' places the city in "the northern highlands", but the later source, ''[[Sea of Fallen Stars (sourcebook)|Sea of Fallen Stars]]'', says it was in the center. forming its highest peak, and was built for creatures much larger than humans and [[cyclopskin]].

==Inhabitants==
Cyclopskin claimed the northern edge of Ilthan, herding [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s, but lived on the southern shore inside of high cliff caverns. Some were known to keep [[minotaur lizard]]s as both pets and guard animals.

Pirates tended to live in small communities on the southern edge of the island, departing to [[Dragonisle]] whenever the winter season came. They largely left the cyclopskin alone, considering the dearth of adequate harbors on Ilthan's northern shore not worth the trouble.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to legend, whoever once lived in Ilthan's ruined stone city had dominated the Sea of Fallen Stars, but were destroyed by vengeful gods.

Rumors said that the cyclopskin who inhabited the island were lorded over by a small band of [[ettin]]s.
