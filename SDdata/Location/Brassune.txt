'''Brassune''' was a ruined [[genasi]] city located in western [[Akanûl]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Brassune was the first city the genasi of Akanûl built after the [[Spellplague]], atop the ruins of a [[Shyr (realm)|Shyran]] city and the [[Chondath]]an city of [[Reth]]. Around [[1400 DR]], after nearly two decades of civil war among the nobles of the city, they decided to create the 'Covenant of Monarchy', appointing King [[Zavon]] as the first ruler of Akanûl.

However, in the {{YearlinkName|1429}}, Brassune was attacked by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. The city was completely destroyed and the surviving inhabitants fled to the ruins of an abandoned [[Chessenta]]n city, [[Airspur]].

As of [[1479 DR]], the ruins of Brassune were still attacked by the minions of the Abolethic Sovereignty, and for this reason the [[Firestorm Cabal]] still watched over its ruins.
