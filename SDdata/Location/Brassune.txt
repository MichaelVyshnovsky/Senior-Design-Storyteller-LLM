City
Brassune was a ruined genasi city located in western Akanûl in the 15 century DR.
Brassune was the first city the genasi of Akanûl built after the Spellplague, atop the ruins of a Shyran city and the Chondathan city of Reth. Around 1400 DR, after nearly two decades of civil war among the nobles of the city, they decided to create the Covenant of Monarchy, appointing King Zavon as the first ruler of Akanûl.
However, in the , Brassune was attacked by the Abolethic Sovereignty. The city was completely destroyed and the surviving inhabitants fled to the ruins of an abandoned Chessentan city, Airspur.
As of 1479 DR, the ruins of Brassune were still attacked by the minions of the Abolethic Sovereignty, and for this reason the Firestorm Cabal still watched over its ruins.
