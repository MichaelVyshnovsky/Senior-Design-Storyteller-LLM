Alonmarch was a county in Duchy Suretmarch in eastern Tethyr.
Alonmarch was located just where the lowlands and the highlands of Tethyr met.
In 1370 DR, Count Vartan Thrynnar ruled Alonmarch from his castle of Thynnars Hold atop Komars Hill.
Alonmarch was one of the few stable areas of the country during the unrest of the Tethyrian Interregnum, because Count Vartan Thrynnar went out of his way to protect his tenant peasants, permitting some of them to even take refuge in Thrynnars Hold.
The region had traditionally been the site of many monster uprisings, as was the case with much of eastern Tethyr. In 1370 DR, because of the conflict with Teldorn Darkhope southeast in Kzelter and the defection of two cities from Amn in the north, many of the needed troops had been pulled out of the area.
The home of the Knights Kuldar, the fortified religious settlement of Barakmordin was located within Alonmarch.
The Dukes mansion of Veaddakar was also located here.
