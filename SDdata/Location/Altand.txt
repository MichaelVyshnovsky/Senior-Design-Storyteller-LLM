Altand was a village in the Misty Forest in the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR. The village existed on two levels, with a few structures built on the ground around an ancient monument to an elven ranger.
Residences and the village temple were built into the upper boughs of the forest. The elves strung rope bridges between these sites and constructed circular walkways around the trees.
