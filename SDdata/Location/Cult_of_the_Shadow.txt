The '''Cult of the Shadow''', or '''Cult of the Shadows''', was a [[temple]] of [[Shar]] in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

The temple doubled as a [[thieves]] [[guild]], acting as the headquarters of the [[Sharwomen]].

The identity of its high priestess was unknown, but she was also head of the Sharwomen.
