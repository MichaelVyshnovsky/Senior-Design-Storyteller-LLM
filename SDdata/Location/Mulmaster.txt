'''Mulmaster''' ({{Pronounce|MUHL|mah|ster|refs=}}), also known as the '''City of Danger''', was an independent city-state found in the harsh [[Moonsea]] region of [[north Faerûn]]. While Mulmaster controlled no land beyond its city walls for much of its history,

{{Quote|This is Mulmaster, a city of the [[Moonsea North]]. Look upon it, and know just how wretched human greed can be. This is a city driven by the lust for power and the greed for gold. Is it not splendid? Is it not matchless?|Excerpt from ''[[The View From Sember Heights]]''.}}

==Description==
While it was a bustling and lively metropolis,{{Cite adventurers league/Cloaks and Shadows|10}} Mulmaster exemplified the worst consequences that arose when merciless commercial enterprise and unchecked greed took hold throughout a populace. It was a corrupt, crime-ridden place that was just as unpleasant to walk through – due to the sickening smell of rotting [[fish]] and molten [[slag]] – as it was to try and eke out a life for oneself.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|8}}

Built within the depression formed by an arc of overbearing peaks, the city's buildings and winding streets stretched on a slant down towards the harbor.

Even the seabed of the harbor was demonstrative of the corruption that gripped on Mulmaster, as it was literally an underwater boneyard for all those that dared cross the ruling High Blade.

===Weather===
Like other cities in the region, Mulmaster had to endure the harsh and unforgiving climate that permeated the Moonsea.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|4}} It was a city besieged on all sides, by the freezing winds that came down from the surrounding mountain slopes and icy gale storms that buffeted its walls from the Moonsea lake.

==Geography==
[[File:Mulmaster.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Map of Mulmaster and the surrounding area, ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]]]
The city of Mulmaster located in the rugged area west of the [[Earthspur Mountains|Earthspur]] and [[Galena Mountains]] in the eastern part of the Moonsea region, nestled within [[Mulmaster Bay]] in the southeast of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]].

With the exception of [[Ironfang Keep]], there were few settlements near Mulmaster in the eastern Moonsea.{{Cite adventurers league/Embers of Elmwood|5}} and [[Masker's Eye]] was situated several days' travel south.{{Cite adventurers league/Bounty in the Bog|7}}

The [[Falling Stone Mine]] that was located {{SI|90|mi|k}} southeast of the city, nestled within the Earthspurs.{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|12}}

===Geographical Features===
The city itself was built around Mulmaster Bay, the inlet of water the formed eastward from the Moonsea Lake.

Like many cities, Mulmaster had a network of [[Mulmaster/Sewers|sewer tunnels]] that snaked around beneath its streets.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|9}} Even deeper still were a series of [[dwarven]]-dug tunnels referred to as the [[Lost Ways]], subterranean passageways that were once part of the ancient realm of [[Sarphil]].

===Flora & Fauna===
Mulmaster was surrounded by a barren, rocky landscape. There was no significant plant life around the city, nor parks or even trees within its walls.

==Government==
{{Main|Blades (Mulmaster)}}
{{quote|''I was born in Mulmaster, the City of Danger. Sail due east from Zhentil Keep, and you'll eventually reach it, perched on the edge of the Moonsea like some predatory beast. Mulmaster is a grim place, ruled by a wicked man and his puppet council."''|[[Astar Graysteel]]}}<br/>
Governance of Mulmaster was carried out by a ruling council of sixteen individuals known as the [[Blades (Mulmaster)|Blades]], also known as the Council of Blades, led by ruling High Blade. Throughout the city's history, the High Blade threatened or otherwise coerced the other members of the council, along with the Mulmasterite nobility into supporting the High Blades goals and wishes. Entrance into the Blades required a confirmation vote by a majority of the council's members.

===Law & Order===
[[File:Thurndan Tallwand.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Thurndan Tallwand]], Senior Cloak as of [[1373 DR]]]]
The [[City Watch (Mulmaster)|City Watch]] of Mulmaster served as little more than hired goons for those wealthy enough to afford their services.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|6}} They regularly extorted their fellow Mulmasterite for "protection fees" and acted as purveyors of violence throughout the city's streets.{{Cite adventurers league/Embers of Elmwood|8}}

As of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], no thieves' guilds were permitted to operate within the walls of Mulmaster. Criminal organizations that attempted to garner renown or accumulated wealth were readily hunted down by agents of the Blades.

Lower-leveled thieves, hired killers and black market traders could be found in every corner of Mulmaster. Petty crime and other lawlessness, including [[drug]] use,{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|7}} continued to be pervasive throughout the entirety of the city well into the late 15{{th}} century.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|1}}

Mulmaster was infamous for its taxes. Even for actors it was illegal to perform without an official city permit with which came the theater tax.

===Magic Regulation===
Practitioners of magic were heavily regulated within Mulmaster, as all native spellcasters of certain power were required to join the city's official [[mage]]'s guild, the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]]. These [[mage]]s and other practitioners of [[the Art]] were pressed into service as social overseers, using invasive [[magic]] to look into the minds of every day citizens to ensure their devotion to the city's ruling powers. Each of the Cloaks, as they were individually known, reported to the [[Cloak Council]], that comprised the Mulmaster's High Blade, two councilors of the Blades, and all members of the Brotherhood of the Cloak deemed to possess power enough to garner such responsibility. Those that left the organization were named traitors of the state and deemed too much a threat to be allowed to live.

==Society==
{{Quote|Fear and loyalty are the same word.|Common saying in Mulmaster's taverns.}}

Mulmasterites, or Mulman, and by and large exhibited one of the finest virtues of those that sought out commercial, industrial and political success in life: patience.

Despite their resolute outlook on life, the unjust and harsh nature of Mulmaster led to a pessimistic attitude within its people.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|6}}

===Nobility===
Members of the 49 noble houses of Mulmaster were called Zor for men, and Zora for women. The head of a noble house, regardless of gender, was a referred to as Lord.{{Cite polyhedron/60/The Everwinking Eye: Who's Who in Mulmaster|8}}

===Politics===
{{Fq|text=If it's spilt blood you want to see, go you to the marketplace of any fair town. There they lie, cheat, and stick knives in each other every day. Best come early—all idle folk in every such place known how good the show is, too. The crowd of bloodthirsty onlookers can make finding a good watching-spot a mite difficult, especially for an outlander.|source=[[Arglauth Melroryrr]], Sage of Mulmaster, ''[[Arglauth's Guide to the North]]''<ref>{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|94}}}}
{{Quote|This is a city where everybody stiffs everybody else.|A local tavernmaster on commerce in the city.}}
While the city of Mulmaster was firmly entrenched in the politics of the Moonsea,

The city maintained an [[Embassy of Mulmaster|embassy]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].

===Economy===
Mulmaster suffered from a tremendous gap in wealth inequality. The powerful nobles hoarded nearly all of the city's wealth offering little else to the city's commoners who were left to live in poverty. Despite the disparity, the Mulmaster's nobility as well as its temples each had to a pay a tax of 100 [[gp]]. A 10  gp tax was imposed on each sponsored caravan, while ships were levied double that fee. The nearly 100,000 individuals employed by the 10,000 Mulmasterite merchants each paid a 6 [[sp]] "head tax" every year to continue to work, lest they no longer have a head with which to be taxed.

===Religion===
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[church of Bane]] had become the dominant faith in the city, as its clergy offered their backing to Mulmasterite nobility.

While Mulmaster historically beat down and tormented devotees of the deity [[Ilmater]], the city was one of only a handful in the Realms that tolerated the open worship of [[Shar]]. 

==Culture==
Interesting and troubling sights were an everyday occurrence in Mulmaster. Travelers in the city could just as readily encounter [[dog]]-fighting matches on streets, as they could exotic beasts from the [[Shining Lands]], or worshipers of the dark gods engaging in ritualistic bouts of self-flagellation.

===Festivals & Holidays===
In Mulmaster, the festival of [[Highharvestide]] was "celebrated" as "he Revel of the Reckoning, the day when each individual paid their taxes to the city. As an act of "gratitude", the High Blade hosted a grand feast for the citizenry, albeit using the funds that were just collected.{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|20}}

===Art & Fashion===
Mulmasterites tended to wear [[leggings]] and [[breeches]] made of [[leather]], along with heavy gauntlets, fur-lined cloaks and caps, to combat the frigid weather that permeated the city. On particularly cold winter days, they would wrap their bodies in fur aprons known as maliskers.

Surprisingly enough, creative artistry in Mulmaster enjoyed a great boom in the 1490s DR, as the city's noble families saw the growing movement as a new means to compete in their social standing with one another. Unfortunately for the city's art scene, the Blades took quick action to suppress works that were seen as "inflammatory".{{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|5}}

===Food & Drink===
Drinks that warmed the body and dulled the senses were each popular among the Mulmasterite populace, fares including [[blackbark tea]], [[beer]], heated [[spiced cider]], along with fortified [[wine]]s.

==Trade==
Considering the city was originally founded as a fortified trading post,

Mulmaster fed its citizens by and large through the efforts of its large fishing fleet and were offered protection from its navy.

==Defenses==
The Blades commanded the armed forces known as the [[Soldiery]],{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|17}} numbering about 6,000 well-trained soldiers as of the the mid–14{{th}} century DR. These soldiers were recruited from among the Mulmaster's native population for service lasting at least six years,{{Cite polyhedron/60/The Everwinking Eye: Who's Who in Mulmaster|7}}

All the branches of Mulmaster's armed forces were commanded by the city's eight Battlemasters. One each of these generals directed armed patrols outside the city, took command of the state's navy on the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]], and oversaw protection of the city's trade caravans and dedicated bodyguards. The Watchmaster of the City served as the head of Mulmaster's city guard, while the Hawkmaster directed the activities of the city's [[Hawks|information gathering organization]]. The final three Battlemasters served as seconds to the more senior of Mulmaster's generals.

When the goals of the High Blade or the rest of the council could not be achieved by means of force, they relied on the secret group known as the [[Hawks]]. This clandestine organization comprised a select group of spies, assassins, and saboteurs that traveled all across the Realms to help ascend Mulmaster's standing in the world.

==History==
{{Quote|Even when it's quiet in Mulmaster, it's not really quiet–ye can hear the sound of everyone who's still awake, plotting. Always plotting.|[[Elminster]].}}

The settlement of Mulmaster was founded in the {{YearlinkName|934}}, as a secured trading fort linking the Moonsea region and the [[Dragon Reach]] via the [[River Lis]].

Mulmaster was among the Moonsea powers to contribute men and resources to repair and retake the ruined [[Citadel of the Raven]] in the {{YearlinkName|1276}}.

After scores of adventurers went missing in [[Ironfang Keep]] for years on end, an expedition was sent from Mulmaster to investigate in the {{YearlinkName|1288}}. This act was ultimately futile, serving only to around and incense bands of local [[gnoll]]s, causing them to direct raids and assaults on the city for the next 50 years.

In the {{yearlinkName|1306}}, Mulmaster began a campaign of conquest across the Moonsea region, that came to be known as the [[Moonsea War]]. The city-state was soundly defeated by an alliance of other powers, including [[Phlan]], [[Hillsfar]], [[Melvaunt]], [[Sembia]], and [[Zhentil Keep]].

===Reign of the High Blades===
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1317}}, Mulmaster was ruled by the monarch [[Nesker]], a sorcerer who died of old age with no apparent heir. The power vacuum created by his death led to The city's first High Blade ascending to power.

Selfaril Uoumdolphin rose to power either the {{yearlinkName|1347}}, or the {{yearlinkName|1348}}, when he destroyed the reputation of the previous High Blade [[Rualph Blackbuckler]], challenged and slew the man in combat, and assumed the title of ruler for himself.

High Blade Selfaril faced a resounding military defeat in the {{YearlinkName|1354}}, when its "New Fleet" was utterly destroyed in battle by the Zhent navy.

Some time before {{YearlinkName|1356}}, After that abject failure, he began to pursue [[Dmitra Flass]], [[Tharchion]]ess of [[Eltabbar]] and First Princess of [[Thay]]. 

The decade-long courtship proved fruitful for Mulmaster, as the two were finally set to wed in the {{YearlinkName|1366}}.<ref group="note">The year of this event varies between various sourcebooks: ''[[Mysteries of the Moonsea]]'' (p.90) says [[1368 DR]] while ''[[Unapproachable East (sourcebook)|Unapproachable East]]'' (p.163) states the marriage occurred in [[1370 DR]]. Some time before the ceremony, High Blade Selfaril was murdered by his twin brother [[Rassendyll Uoumdolphin]], and his soul was place within the [[soul gem|gem]] of the new ruler's sword.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|5}} Rassendyl assumes rulership of Mulmaster under the guise of his brother's identity, and carries on with the marriage to Dmitra Flass, securing the alliance with Thay.

Unfortunately the public demonstration of love and coming together of different nationalities, not to mention the deft political maneuvering and fratricide, did not sit well among the Mulmasterite people, that resent growing Thayan influence within the city. The tension came to a head in [[Alturiak]] the [[1367 DR|following year]] when a crowd of native citizens assailed a [[Red Wizard]] delegate of Tharchioness Flass for committing some unknown transgression within the city. The Mulmasterite mob set the Thayan wizard on fire, chased down a number of other Thayan nationals, and nearly burnt down the [[House Built of Gold|local temple]] of [[Waukeen]]. A great magical battle erupted between the the city's [[Brotherhood of the Cloak|Cloaks]] and the Red Wizards, with reported casualties in the hundreds.

===Zhent Control===
{{Quote|Why are ye so happy that Zhentil Keep is undone? Now Mulmaster will rise to fill the vacancy. Believe me, that is scarcely cause for celebration!|[[Elminster]].}}
After the destruction of [[Zhentil Keep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, waves of refugees left their ruined city for Mulmaster. The As a show of force, the Mulmasterite navy blockaded the ruined city at sea, contributing to the Keep's considerable number of woes. The [[1369|following year]], [[Fzoul Chembryl]] formed an alliance with High Blade Rassendyll, while outwardly it appeared that "Selfaril" had actually been a long-time and high-ranking agent of the [[Zhentarim]]. 

In [[1369 DR]], a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' emerged in Mulmaster, starting to consume lives of the city's residents. The ''spawn pool'' originated from the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]] where it was corrupted and abused by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. [[Kya Mordrayn]]'s cult cell spread tentacles of her corrupted ''pool'', feeding it on cities across the [[Moonsea]], empowering it. Subsequently the Cult's plans were shattered and its leaders slain by the [[Veiled Ones]]. With the main ''pool of radiance'' gone, Mulmaster was saved.

In a twist of fate, Fzoul Chembryl and Rassendyll expertly choreographed a second great defeat of the Mulmasterite navy, presenting to outsiders a decisive victory by the Zhents. After selectively slaughtering certain members of the city's Blades council, the Zhentarim had essentially taken over as masters of Mulmaster. This secret alliance consolidated power for the two city-states, with an edge given to the Zhents.

In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, an army of [[giant]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[orc]]s led by two [[fire giant]]s, formed in the lands east of Mulmaster in the Galenas. They launched increasingly flagrant attacks against travelers, and began to disrupt overland trade to the city.

===15{{th}} Century===
[[File:Mulmaster district Will Doyle.jpg|thumb|right|350px|One of the districts of Mulmaster, ''circa'' [[1480 DR]]]]
In the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, the Blades worked together with local [[Tymora]]n priests to reclaim the lost mine of [[Point Iron]] from its [[duergar]] residents. Atop the site they built the stronghold of [[Fort Iron]], to secure the rich natural resources found within.{{Cite adventurers league/Oubliette of Fort Iron|5}}

As the zealots of [[Elemental Evil]] emerged in cities across the [[Heartlands]] in the 1490s [[DR]], cultists of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred|Howling Hatred]],{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|7}} the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame|Eternal Flame]],{{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|5}} and the [[Cult of the Black Earth|Black Earth]]{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|5}} each competed with one another for the fate of Mulmaster. Their collective experimentation with [[elemental node]]s led to a sweltering heatwave in the summer of the {{yearlinkName|1491}}.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|6}} 

In the month of [[Kythorn]] Eternal Flame used the heatwave as inspiration to unleash various [[fire elemental]]s throughout the city and burn it to ashes,{{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|20}} while the Black Earth obsessively sought out the [[seed of fel earth]] underground, regardless of any the potential destruction it could cause to the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|5, 8}} and the Crushing Wave attempted to form a ''[[devastation orb]]'' at the node beneath ruined [[Fort Dalton]] to take vengeance on the city,{{Cite adventurers league/Dark Rites at Fort Dalton|6}} after their ''[[orb of living water]]'' was stolen from the [[Drowned Tower]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|19}}

After being uncovered in the {{YearlinkName|1481}} by the [[dwarven]] King [[Bhún Ludwakazar]],{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|21}} the ''[[Rassendyl's Sword|magical sword]]'' containing the [[soul gem|spirit]] of Selfaril Uoumdolphin, came into the possession of a band of adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|7}} After the blade was taken to the [[Tower of Arcane Might]], the former High Blade of Mulmaster was freed from his century-long imprisonment.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|9}} The returned Selfaril immediately set out to reclaim his title of High Blade, by challenging Mulmaster's ruler [[Jaseen Drakehorn]] to a duel in single combat, with the fate of the city at stake.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|19}}

==Rumors & Legends==
There was an oft-shared tale about a foolish adventurer from Mulmaster that jumped on the back of a sleeping [[wyvern]] in order to slay the beast. As it took flight and twisted in the sky, the adventurer took his time to kill the beast, thinking he could glide down to the ground atop its slowly-descending serpentine corpse. Rather he was crushed by the carcass as it came plummeting down to the face of [[Toril]].
