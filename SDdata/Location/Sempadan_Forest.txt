The '''Sempadan Forest''' was a vast forest lying on the eastern side of the wide isthmus joining the continents of [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Kara-Tur]] with [[Zakhara]]. It was known as the '''Jungle of Monsters''' to Zakharans to the southwest.

==Geography==
The Sempadan Forest spread along the shore around the [[Segara Sea]], east of the [[World Pillar Mountains]] and south of the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]].

===Geographical features===
An unnamed river ran south-east through the forest, emptying into the Segara Sea. It had two tributaries descending from the mountains. Two more meandering rivers cut through its narrower southern part, flowing from the eastern heights of the [[Land of the Yak-Men]] into the [[Foreigners' Sea]]. Another short one marked the southern border of the forest towards the no-man's land between the [[Haunted Lands]], the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] and the sea.

In the eastern part of the forest was [[Lake Odoh]].

The northern edge of the forest was known as [[Herne's Wood]] to the people of the [[Utter East]], the land lying on the western side of the isthmus.<ref group="note">The video game ''[[Blood & Magic]]'' presents two locations, Edenvale Castle and Herne's Wood. Comparing the game map with standard maps of the region shows that these lie in the Sempadan Forest, though the game map only encompasses the northern edge of the forest. Although lore for these locations might encompass the whole of the forest, for simplicity and clarity, these are treated as distinct locations within the Sempadan Forest.

==History==
The nations of Kara-Tur and the [[Grand Caliph]]ate of Zakhara had largely ignored the continental isthmus.{{speculation}} The Sempadan Forest, together with the adjacent Roof of the World, was a formidable barrier for land travel between the two continents, so that trade was usually done by sea.<ref><ref> Thus the Sempadan Forest remained completely unknown and unexplored by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].Apart from its appearance on maps and a few little-known locations near the edges, very little is known about the Sempadan Forest itself. Given the stated lack of interest in the area, it appears that the forest is unexplored.

The neighboring [[Yikarian Empire]] had often been in direct conflict with the dangerous denizens of the Jungle of Monsters. By the [[1367 DR|1360s DR]],{{AQ-time}} the army of the [[yak folk]] was on guard in the adjacent [[Bronze Falcon]] province under the effective leadership of the [[Mountain Prince]].{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

==Notable locations==
Around [[1357 DR]], the settlement of [[Seringkali]] lay in the eastern fringes of the Sempadan Forest, connected by a trail to [[Tang-ga]].) sat at the very eastern tip of the Sempadan Forest.

In the far northwestern corner, near Herne's Wood, stood [[Edenvale Castle]], part of the Utter Eastern realm of [[Edenvale]] around the mid-600s [[DR]].

Around 1367 DR,{{AQ-time}} there were also persistent rumors of a yak folk trading post at a location where one of the rivers from the World Pillars emptied from the forest into the Foreigner's Sea.
