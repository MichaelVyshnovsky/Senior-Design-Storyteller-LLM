'''The Vast''' was a region in [[north Faerûn]] that rested along the north coast of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], bounded by the [[Dragon Reach]] and [[River Lis]] in the west; the [[Earthspur Mountains]], the [[Gray Forest]], and [[Impiltur]] in the east; and the [[Moonsea]] and [[Damara]] in the north. It lay on both sides of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] that ran through it. Over its long history, it was home to the [[orc]] nation of [[Vastar]] for which it was named; the ancient [[elf]] city of [[Ylraphon]], an outpost of [[Cormanthyr]]; the brief [[dwarf]] kingdom of [[Roldilar]], the Realm of Glimmering Swords; and a variety of [[human]] city-states—historic [[Procampur]] and [[Tsurlagol]], and the newcomers [[Calaunt]], [[Tantras]], and [[Ravens Bluff]], the Living City—some of which gathered into the nation of [[Vesperin]].

{{Quote|''Come one, come all, here to the Vast. All the killing's happening here, and the next handful of dooms to befall us all are a-hatching here—why wait for them to crawl to you? Come to the Vast, and join the slaughter.''|[[Guldaeth Grimshield]] of [[Highbank Forest]]}}

==Environment & Geography==
The Vast was a land of great open spaces, sparsely settled but far from empty. Once, it was covered in dense forests, but the orcs of [[Vastar]] cut these down, leaving only grasslands and isolated woods.

This left a green and temperate realm of hunting grounds and rolling farmlands, their fields used to grow all kinds of crops that suited the climate or for the grazing of herds. The farms and fields were separated by low fieldstone walls, which were often cultivated as wild hedges where they faced the roads. Amongst these farms were small woodlots and copses, which grew from scrublands left behind by the great old forests of the past.

Beyond the farmland were real forests, though mostly these were second-growth forests from surviving saplings. [[Druid]]s cultivated these forests, and encouraged woodland creatures and [[fey]] to move in from other forests further away. The great forests of the Vast were [[Adhe Wood]], [[Brynwood]], and the [[Gray Forest]], which was called the "Tsurlar Forest" in the Vast.

The Vast held four great rivers: the [[Fire River]], the [[River Vesper]], the [[River Lis]], and the [[River Dalton]]. They emptied into the bay of the Dragon Reach, There were many small streams and brooks, but they rarely joined the major rivers of the Fire River and the River Vesper. More often, they ended in pools and drained away into subterranean channels and finally emptied into the Inner Sea. Some even rose to the surface again, only to disappear once more. Thus the water table was described as a crazy jigsaw.

This was due to the geology of the Vast, consisting of slanting and broken layers of rock deep beneath the soil. These left a quite a number of small-sized caves, rifts and sinkholes, that could be well concealed in apparently empty fields. Such places were a favorite spot for children to hide, for farmers to conceal their savings, or for some to build privies over.

There were also rocky outcrops marking where the foothills met the great mountain ranges of the Vast. The southern coast against the Inner Sea was called the Tsurlagan coast. In the north, [[Mount Wolf]] marked the border of the Vast in the north.

On the east, the [[High Country]] was a large area of rocky moors and grassy plains and hills. It jutted east into a gap in the Earthspur Mountains. Rumors told of hidden passes through the mountains into neighboring [[Impiltur]]. Protected from human settlement and farming, the High Country was a fertile breeding area for game animals.

===Climate===
As with the other lands that surrounded it, the Sea of Fallen Stars produced rainfall and moderate temperatures in the Vast, warming it in winter and keeping it moist and green. Thus the Vast experienced a mild climate all year, with its summers long and cool, and its winters short and clement, though the Dragon Reach could ice over.

===Fauna===
Animals commonly found in the forests and mountainsides were [[boar]], [[deer]] and black-masked [[bear]]s. These were a favorite of local hunters and local inns.

{{Quote|''—aren’t exactly stable and easy-going places to dwell, now, are they?''|[[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], on the cities of the Vast.}}
In its history, the Vast was home to several large cities, each thriving ports. Some were incredibly old and well established, such as the fallen elven city of [[Ylraphon]], the enduring dwarven city of [[Earthfast]], and the human cities of [[Procampur]] and [[Tsurlagol]], among the first settled by humans in the [[Heartlands]]. Others were veritable newcomers, such as the brief dwarven city of [[Sarbreen]], and the later human cities of [[Calaunt]], [[Tantras]], and [[Ravens Bluff]].

==Demographics==
The peoples of the Vast were diverse and mixed. It was once home to [[orc]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and [[dwarf|dwarves]], and later settled by a variety of [[human]] immigrants.

As of [[1372 DR]], the Vast was home to 1,308,960 people: 78% human, 9% dwarf, 5% halfling, 3% elf, 2% gnome, 1% half-elf and 1% half-orc.

The human population was a blend of Damaran and Chondathan immigrants, predominantly Damaran. However, those Damarans who lived south of the Earthfast Mountains mostly resembled their Chondathan neighbors. They were of the same heritage as the [[Cormyr]]eans, [[Dalelands|Dalesman]], and [[Sembia]]ns, whom they considered kin.

==Etymology & Languages==
The true source of the name "the Vast" was lost to history, but most [[sage]]s thought it derived from "[[Vastar]]", the name of the ancient [[orc]] kingdom that once dominated the land.

The people of the Vast spoke the [[Easting language]], with both Procampan and Tantran dialects,{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26,28}} which was related to the [[Damaran language]].

==Governments==
There was no overall government or leader in the Vast, and no capital city. Instead, it was divided up by a number of city-states and feudal holdings. The cities were mostly governed by councils made up of landowners and wealthy merchants, or dominated by ex-[[adventurer]]s.

Eventually, however, the formerly independent city-states of Calaunt, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras united in the nation of [[Vesperin]], a young country by [[1479 DR]]. Its capital was at Tantras, and it was ruled by the [[Golden Lord]]s there, but gold was more influential than government. Vesperin remained neutral with regard to international politics, becoming a meeting place for agents of other powers and thick with intrigue. <ref group="note">Only  Calaunt, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras are mentioned as being a part of Vesperin in ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'', with the status of the other cities (Procampur and Tsurlagol), towns, and settlements in the Vast unknown. Therefore, it is uncertain to what extent Vesperin overlaps the Vast.

==Business & Economy==
The peoples of the Vast produced and exported metals of [[copper]], [[iron]], nickel and [[silver]], farm produce like grain and livestock, and parchment and textiles.

Many travelers declared that the finest inns in the Vast were not those in the cities or in the Vast itself, but on the roads linking to the Vast to the outside. The best was said to be [[The Wizard's Hand]] in [[Maskyr's Eye]], followed by [[The Worried Wyvern]] in [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] and [[The Elf in Armor]] in [[High Haspur]]. These were among the best in [[Faerûn]].

By 1479 DR, with the decline of Impiltur and Sembia, the nation of Vesperin in the Vast had become a center for trade in the region. However, it was also rife with corruption and crime.

==People==
[[File:VastRogue.jpg|thumb|right|A typical rogue of the Vast.]]
The humans of the Vast, by culture and custom, were more or less similar to those of [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], the [[Dalelands]], with all of whom they shared a common heritage, and even those of faraway [[Waterdeep]]. Thus they considered themselves more closely related and to have more in common with their neighbors west across the Dragon Reach than those of the east over the Earthspur Mountains.

By and large, they were characterized as adventurers, explorers, and pioneers, known for a spirit of adventure, daring and opportunity for growth and advancement, more so than anywhere else in Faerûn. They were an honest and optimistic people. Here it seemed that all the monsters and enemies of the [[Moonsea]] and other neighboring lands were more easily defeated, while the heroes won out more often.

Nevertheless, the people of the Vast remained diverse and wide-ranging, with the cities of [[Calaunt]], [[Procampur]], [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Tantras]], and [[Tsurlagol]] all quite different, from each other and from the rural communities.

They usually preferred to keep to themselves, satisfied with their own homes and lives. Each person considered themselves as one with the land they lived on and were loyal first and foremost to their local community. Country folk in particular just wanted to get the job done without hassle, and so they viewed cities as dangerous or dodgy or both. Procampur was thought to be dominated by status and age. Tantras was considered "god-ridden", suspicious and unfriendly. Calaunt was said to be evil, full of thieves and ruled by arrogant fools; people who acted arrogant and foolish were labeled "Calaunt-heads" or told to "go back to Calaunt". Ravens Bluff seemed to be both, full of religion and thieves, and colorful, dangerous and chaotic too.

Their neighbors in Sembia, Cormyr, and the Dalelands were generally viewed with compassion by both country and city folk alike, both as allies and as business partners. King [[Azoun IV]] was highly regarded for his efforts during the [[Horde Wars]]. Opinions were much lower of the [[Moonsea]] lands, said to be home to misers, cheats and spies; [[Mulmaster]] in particular was the great evil in the north, as disliked and feared as [[Zhentil Keep]] was to [[Shadowdale]]. Across the Inner Sea, the [[Dragon Coast]] cities were considered lawless and the origin of the pirates that raided the Vast. 

Regardless, they liked to hear a [[bard]] tell news about realms outside their own, mainly for its entertainment value. They also loved to hear a [[ballad]], whether a new or an old, oft-told one. Folk all over the Vast made bards and [[minstrel]]s welcome, treating them as honored guests and new friends. For their entertainment, they were well paid and well fed. Many who toured [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], [[Sembia]], and the Vast preferred the last for these reasons.

===Adventurers===
[[File:VastWizard.jpg|thumb|left|A typical wizard of the Vast.]]
[[Adventurer]]s were similarly welcome, for they brought [[gold]], [[magic]], and tales from their travels. The country folk, however, tended to be more reserved towards adventurers that trekked through their fields and risked causing trouble.

Such adventurers were often folk who were quick to act and a little pushy, and who often won through by pluck, determination, or dumb luck. A fair number came from wealthy merchant families. Adventurers tended to vary by their home city and trade, but in general shared some broad characteristics.

In keeping with the general Vast attitude, adventuring [[fighter|warriors]] of the Vast tended to be optimistic and enthusiastic, undeterred by tales of adventurers meeting sorry ends. They were daring, willing to stand up to any challenge. Many youngsters of the Vast were drawn to this kind of life. However, little distinguished them visually from adventuring warriors Faerûn-over. These warriors preferred reliable, practical, and oft-used armor and weaponry, with simple clothing and heavy cape or cloak, and a little [[jewelry]] and other decoration. Spiked [[banded mail]] was a common choice of armor.

[[Wizard]]s of the Vast were described as grand, charismatic and even glamorous people. Whether in success or in disaster, they always planned ahead to gain or regain wealth and status. They preferred comfortable clothing that was both practical when adventuring and suitable for a visit to a palace. They did enjoy jewelry and similar accessories, but no more than was tasteful.

The Vast's rogues, thieves, and scoundrels, meanwhile, were eager and willing to do anything, and almost recklessly brave—an attitude that as often as not got them into danger as well as out. They were high-spirited and good-humored even in the face of doom, and were described as masters of graveyard humor. They often dressed in dandy clothing to stand out, with flowing capes, feathered caps, fancy frills, and a range of bright colors, though they eschewed apparel that was too encumbering or weakened their defenses.

The [[Sublime Way]] found one of its greatest homes in western Faerûn in the Vast, where the traditions of blade magic remained strong. The [[White Raven]] discipline was created in the Vast and the great [[Reshar]] learned it there. The discipline of the [[Devoted Spirit]] was called "Ancestral Sword" in the Vast, in respect to the great blade magicians of old. Many wandering warriors in the Vast practiced blade magic, with a few dedicated [[Master of Nine|Masters of Nine]]. Sword temples were found in the cities of Procampur, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras, each with [[crusader]] orders, such as the [[Trueblades]] and the [[Knights of the White Raven]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades|}}

===Customs & Culture===
For the dangers of the wilderness, the people of the Vast commonly went armed, especially outside the cities and in the rural areas. Such weapons were simple and practical, however, usually a [[knife]], [[sling]], or [[staff]]. As soon as a child was allowed away from their parents, they could have a sling or a knife in their belt.

For the country folk, hunting was a way of life and game was plentiful. Most hunts were carried out in the woodlands, on foot by a few archers or a handful of people equipped with [[club]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[spear]]s; the former method, though it took more skill, left the prey in better shape. On hills and wooded mountainsides, hunts were conducted by large bands with better weapons, lest the hunters find themselves the prey of orcs, bandits, or monsters. In wildernesses plagued by monsters, this form of hunting was the norm.

Favorite prey animals were [[boar]], [[deer]], and even [[bear]], and these were roasted and served in many inns. The Vast was famous for its roast stag, with succulent, high-quality meat of great size. A local tradition was to serve the roast stag on several large platters, including the entire rack of antlers on the first tray, accompanying the finest cuts and sweetmeats.

[[File:BoneDance.jpg|thumb|The Bone Dance was an event for young and old.]]There were a few local festivals unique to the Vast, celebrated across the land but with more enthusiasm in the countryside communities than in the big cities. These were:
* [[The Arming]] (4th [[Tarsakh]]): A celebration of local militias and battle readiness.
* [[The Plowing]] (6th [[Mirtul]]): The traditional plowing time in farming communities.
* [[Hornmoot]] (14th [[Kythorn]]): The first trading day of the year between dwarves and humans.
* The [[Bone Dance (festival)|Bone Dance]] ([[Eleasis 9|9th]] [[Eleasis]]): A hunting festival and banquet dedicated to [[Malar]], god of the hunt.

===Religion===
The people of the Vast tolerated a wide number of faiths, and all of the most popular [[Faerûnian pantheon|human faiths]] were represented there. The most important were those of [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]] and [[Torm]], followed by [[Mystra]], [[Tempus]], [[Tymora]], [[Umberlee]], and [[Waukeen]]. Tymora, Tempus and Waukeen were known as the "traveler's gods" and they had [[shrine]]s across the land. Other gods also had shrines across the Vast, along with a few [[temple]]s, mainly in the big cities. Waukeen's temples declined following her disappearance in [[1358 DR]], but were expected to quickly recover when she returned in [[1370 DR]].

Dwarves of the Vast commonly followed [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]]. The fallen dwarven realm of [[Roldilar]] left behind a number of boulders along the [[North Road]], each carved with the symbol of Clangeddin. Many human warriors of the Vast honored both Tempus and Clangeddin before going into battle in the mountains.

The cities of the Vast, especially Ravens Bluff, were centers of worship for halfling followers of [[Brandobaris]].

==Adventures==
{{Quote|''Treasure? Aye, lots of it in the Vast, lad; why didn't ye ask earlier? Oh… I see; ye wanted to live a while, first.''|[[Buirin Thalshond]] of [[Tantras]], [[1357 DR]]}}
Though some of its cities were extremely old and standing on the first settled lands in modern times, much of the Vast in the mid–14th century had only been taken from the native orcs within the last few generations and was just beginning to be settled and civilized. Thus in many places it remained wild, lawless, and unexplored, and so for professional adventurers it was a hotspot for adventure.

The land was once ruled by orcs and goblins, in the nation of [[Vastar]], but they were steadily pushed out of power by the dwarves and humans. By the mid–14th century, great numbers of them still inhabited the mountains, unexplored caves, and distant corners of the land. They were confined in such places, but not defeated. Orcs and dwarves still warred for control of the mountains. Although rare, orcish raiders in the lowlands were dangerous enough and common enough, especially in the winter months, to force human settlers to stick to the coasts. However, barring catastrophes, they were unlikely to dislodge human rule from the Vast. 

There were several common lures for adventurers from all around the Realms, such as the intrigues and disputes between rival factions, or the number of dwarven ruins and their rumored treasure vaults. The Vast acquired a reputation as a place where some secrets were better off left undisturbed, where some things were best left buried in the mountains and deep caves.

{{Quote|''Beware—there are beasts and secrets sleeping in those mountains that had best be awakened only by someone with a ready blade and fast spells, if they would live to boast of it…''|[[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]]}}
==History==
===Ancient history===
In ancient times, agents of the [[Elven Court]] of [[Cormanthor]] made contact with the dwarves of [[Sarphil]] in the lands later known as the Vast. Desiring to maintain control over the forests there, the Elven Court warred against the dwarves to stop them expanding to the surface. But after the elves saved the dwarves from being defeated by orcs, the two sides negotiated on the Vast's battlefields around {{Yearlink|-6400}}. They made a tenuous alliance, but it lasted 2000 years, and each prospered from trade of goods and information.

Some time after {{Yearlink|-5005}}, [[Jhaamdath]] began expanding over the [[Inner Sea]] and settled colonies in the Vast, among other lands. These brought trade goods and prestige to the empire.

Elves from Cormanthor went beyond the [[River Lis]] to found [[Yrlaphon]] in the northern Vast in {{Yearlink|-1535}}. After drow raiders weakened its defenses in the winter of {{Yearlink|-722}}, Yrlaphon fell to orc hordes in the summer.

The ancient [[minotaur]] kingdom of [[Grong-Haap]] ({{Yearlink|-981}} to {{Yearlink|-350}}) once encroached upon the northern highlands of the Vast.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep}}

===Vastar and the Jhaamdathan colonization===
[[Image:ElvenbloodPass.jpg|thumb|left|Vastar's orcs descending upon the forces of Westgate.]]
The orc kingdom of [[Vastar]] rose ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-700}}. The history of Vastar was a turbulent one, with frequent coups, bloody civil wars, constant strife, and regular attacks and counter-attacks against their neighbors and other creatures who lived in their land. Every dozen years, a horde would form in the summer, steal or build ships, and sail south over the Inner Sea to raid. Their survivors rarely returned, instead spreading south. For their shipbuilding efforts, the orcs cut down the great forests of the land. When they ran out of timber, they went over the Dragon Reach and over the River Lis to take what they wanted from [[Cormanthor]], but were more often slaughtered by the elves. They made several such invasions by sea and land.

During the reign of King [[Glaurath|Glaurath the Great]] of [[Westgate]] ({{Yearlink|-301}} – {{Yearlink|-291}}), thieves stole the royal treasury of Westgate and fled by ship to the Vast. They anchored at the spot where the city of Procampur would later lie, and went up into the Earthfast Mountains, pursued by Westgate's forces, until both sides were annihilated by a thousand local orcs in [[Elvenblood Pass|a mountain pass]].

On the southern side of the Inner Sea, the empire of Jhaamdath fell beneath a great wave in [[-255 DR|the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR]]. A wave of refugees—later known as the [[Chondathan]] people—crossed the Inner Sea to colonize the lands of [[Impiltur]], [[Thesk]] and the Vast south of the Earthfast Mountains, becoming among the first lands on the north coast to be settled by humans. After occupying these lands, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-200}}, their descendants migrated westward from Impiltur and the Vast to cross the Dragon Reach and settle [[Sembia]], [[Cormyr]] and the [[Dalelands]], in time giving rise to those realms.

Dwarves from [[Earthfast]] founded the underground town of Proeskampalar in [[-153 DR|the Year of the Starry Shroud, −153 DR]]. That same year, it was joined by descendants of the Jhaamdathan refugees, who also settled there. It later became known as [[Procampur]]. More founded the city of Chessagol, later known as [[Tsurlagol]], in [[-72 DR|the Year of Enchanted Hearts, −72 DR]].

When [[human]]s first dominated the Vast, [[Sendrin]] was settled in the remote Vast, along with a temple to [[Savras]]. With Savras then commonly seen as a wise user of [[magic]] rather than just a diviner, Sendrin became a mecca for [[wizard]]s, despite its remoteness. However, when [[Azuth]] defeated Savras and supplanted him as god of magic before or after the [[Dawn Cataclysm]], Azuth's followers sacked and destroyed the Savran temple of Sendrin. The wizards stopped coming, and those who'd serviced them—scribes, component sellers, tailors, healers, escorts—gradually left. The community they'd made went mobile, becoming the travelling [[Magefair]]. <ref group="note">The founding and decline of Sendrin is difficult to date. ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'' page 155 states "When human rule had just come to the Vast". This could be after the Jhaamdathans settled Procampur and Tsurlagol in the second and first centuries before Dalereckoning. However, this would be deep in orc territory in the kingdom of Vastar, and the ''The City of Ravens Bluff'' never refers to this earlier founding time. Instead, it focuses on human settlement from the 7th century DR onward. As for Sendrin's decline, according to ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' page 47, Azuth defeated Savras sometime during or shortly after the [[Dawn Cataclysm]], a difficult-to-date divine event. Finally, ''[[Secrets of the Magister]]'' places the first true Magefair in the 3rd century. This supports a much earlier date for Sendrin's rise and fall, between −153 DR (the settling of Procampur) and ''circa'' 253 DR (the date of the first Magefair). This agrees with estimates of the Dawn Cataclysm.

In [[331 DR|the Year of Cold Clashes, 331 DR]], the orcs of Vastar launched a surprise attack on [[Cormanthyr]], and occupied a portion of the lands east of the Old [[Elven Court]]. They solidified their forces in the area over the next few years. It wasn't until [[339 DR|the Year of the Vanished Foe, 339 DR]], that the occupying orcs were routed by combined elvish and [[human]] forces.

In the early 5th century DR, King [[Meldath I]] of Impiltur led a conquest of the Vast and other nearby lands, turning Proeskampalar and Chessagol into vassal city-states.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|59}} <ref group="note">[[Dragon magazine 346|"Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom"]] names this warrior king Meldath the Magnificent. However, ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' lists only [[Meldath I]] "the Mighty" ([[411 DR]]–[[445 DR]]) and [[Meldath II]] ([[445 DR]]–[[448 DR]]). The name and details would suggest that this is in fact Meldath I. Both Proeskampalar/Procampur and Chessagol/Tsurlagol are later stated to be independent, but how they attained their freedom has not been detailed.

In [[512 DR|the Year of the Wyvernfall, 512 DR]], Vastar was on the rampage again, with orc hordes from here and other strongholds emerging and threatening Cormanthyr and many other lands with war. The orc chieftain [[Ulbror]] marched his horde through many small passes in the Earthspur Mountains and invaded [[Impiltur]]. The orcs slew King [[Sharaun Mirandor]], his three heirs and their army, killing off the [[Mirandor]] dynasty. Ulbror and the orcs were defeated later that year in the [[Battle of Bloody Reeds]].

[[Ologh]] the Overking of Vastar was killed by the [[black dragon]] [[Iyrauroth]] in [[572 DR|the Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]], leaving his throne at the [[Hollow Mountain]] vacant. Vastar descended into civil war as orcish factions battled for control across the land.

===Roldilar, the Realm of Glimmering Swords===
The victorious dwarves claimed the surface lands for themselves and that same year they founded [[Roldilar]], the Realm of Glimmering Swords, under [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]], who ruled from Mount Grimmerfang. The Roldilarren dwarves set to work trading with other nations and developing their new land, by building stone towers and importing livestock. Their logging industry cleared forests for miles and they attempted large-scale agriculture.

[[Image:Tuir and Maskyr.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maskyr One-Eye|Maskyr]] paid a high price for his [[Maskyr's Eye|vale]].]]Roldilarren dwarves ruled the Vast while the orcs and goblinoids were driven out and subdued, but others soon immigrated to the developing land. Ironically, in some parts, humans and elves lived in the mountains alongside orcs and worse neighbors, as the dwarves controlled the lowlands. There they built their tombs and strongholds.

Among these settlers, two [[Sembia]]n merchants explored the dwarven-held lands, seeking a trade-route from the dwarven mines down to the [[River Vesper]].

Roldilar enjoyed only forty years of peace before its power waned. In that time, the orcs had replenished their numbers and recovered their strength. Above and below ground, vast hordes of orcs engulfed Roldilar in the [[649 DR|the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]].

The Roldilarren dwarves, however, were saved from total extinction by their human and [[elf|elven]] allies. This delayed the end of Roldilar.

Dwarven refugees of Roldilar retreated, many going to other lands. Roldilar was the last dwarven realm to claim the surface lands of the Vast or dominate there, as of [[1370 DR]].

===The Time of Glorious Fools===
The humans settlers, however, stayed to fight the orcs and hold onto the land they now called home. Many more, however, left overcrowding in the [[Vilhon Reach]] to cross the Inner Sea and settle the Vast south of the Fire River. Here, they made a foothold from which they could expand, growing populous with high immigration and birthrates. They quickly absorbed the former, settled inhabitants, the dwarves, gnomes, and halflings.

They advanced swiftly over the Vast, finding a war-torn land where orcs ruled, and [[troll]]s, [[leucrotta]], and other creatures had left the mountains and flourished by preying upon dead and dying dwarves and orcs. They fought them frequently, and steadily pushed them all out of the lowlands and into the hills and mountains once more. Many adventurers rose out of these conflicts, folk who sought impossible odds and made desperate assaults, and miraculously won as often as they were slaughtered. Thus local bards named this "the Time of Glorious Fools", a period that some said continued well on into the 14th century.

The most successful adventurers were those who won both gold and fame for their great deeds. Such adventuring bands set themselves up in keeps, with mounted warriors, minor battle-mages, and priests of [[Helm]] or [[Tempus]], and promised to protect local farmers from raids in exchange for a "shield tax", though they were often too late to help.

As they expanded, the human settlers cleared land for their farms, erected low fieldstone walls to divide their fields, and built good roads. These eventually linked Procampur and Tsurlagol on the Inner Sea to [[Mulmaster]] by the [[Moonsea]]. Farmers then enjoyed bountiful harvests for several years. The settlers went on to open up the more accessible mines, and grew more prosperous. Seeking agricultural produce, trading vessels came from [[Aglarond]], Impiltur, Sembia, and [[Westgate]], and they sold goods like quality cloth and [[iron]]work, locks, and [[weapon]]s. The harbors of the Vast, [[Calaunt]], Sarbreen, and [[Tantras]]—once landing spots for immigrants and rest stops for pirates—were developed as trade ports. This all cemented human habitation of the Vast.

Thus, there were two paths to lordship for the folk of the Vast. On the one hand were big farmers who'd earned their fortunes, bought up surrounding land and their fellows, and called themselves lords and ladies. On the other were retired adventurers who'd won wealth and power, built strongholds and gathered their own followers, and could call themselves what they liked. Some of the farmer lords were themselves retired adventurers, while others were deposed by adventurers looking to retire.

[[Ravens Bluff]] was established as a city over the remains of Sarbreen, in [[1222 DR|the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR]].

The mid–13th century saw the Vast once again suffer rampaging hordes of orcs, goblins, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[bugbear]]s, supplemented by some human brigands and half-breed rogues. In [[1246 DR|the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR]],{{CotMD-time}} the orc warlord [[Fottergrim]] and the [[magelord]] [[Archlis]] led a mixed horde of them in an invasion and take-over of Tsurlagol. Procampur sent an army to besiege and liberate the city. Fottergrim and Archlis were slain, Procampur's armies were victorious, and Tsurlagol was liberated. Fottergrim's silver-plated skull was mounted on a pillar halfway between the two cities with a warning against threatening Procampur's allies.

In the mid-13th century (''i.e.'', over a century before the 1360s DR), a hobgoblin horde marched near Procampur. It was defeated with the aid of the mage [[Snilloc]], who earned some fame for his actions here.

Also sometime around the mid–13th century DR, the forests in the northern Vast began sinking into swampland, becoming the [[Flooded Forest]].

In [[1253 DR|the Year of Beckoning Death, 1253 DR]], plague struck the Vast, as well Cormyr and Sembia.

The terrifying [[red dragon]] [[Halarglautha|Halarglautha Firewings]] had rampaged across the lands of the Vast south of the [[River Vesper]], particularly along the [[Fire River]]. The flaming destruction she inflicted on dwarf, human, and orc settlements here apparently gave the Fire River its name. Her reign of terror ended when she was slain by a band of [[human]] adventurers in the late 13th century. <ref group="note">The duration of Halarglautha's rampage is unknown, and the date of her fall is estimated based on the number of generations of  her slayers' descendants at the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]].

By [[1294 DR]], much of the Vast was again wilderness, lawless, and plagued by monsters. The [[Magister]] of the time, [[Inhil Lauthdryn|Inhil "Hurler-of-Stars" Lauthdryn]], went into the Vast wilderness to find, defeat, and bring to justice rogue [[archmages]] of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. Inhil's remains were later found, slain but apparently successful in his quest.

===Modern History===
In [[1317 DR|the Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR]], the [[Plague of Dragons]] quickly spread around the Inner Sea from the Vilhon Reach to Impiltur and Tsurlagol. The priests of Procampur feared that their city would be the next to suffer the diseases and the dragon that spread them.

====The Time of Troubles====
During the [[Time of Troubles]], in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[skeleton]]s rose from their graves to take over the town of [[Hlintar]]. Refugees from Hlintar and other chaos-stricken areas fled to Calaunt, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras.

The [[god]] [[Torm|Torm the True]] manifested in the city of Tantras and took up residence there, while his faithful persecuted those of other gods. Torm eventually discovered their crimes and punished them for it. Then the god [[Bane|Bane the Black Lord]] arrived to take one of the [[Tablets of Fate]], which he'd hidden in the city. In a titanic battle in the harbor, Torm fought Bane, and absorbed the souls of thousands of his willing faithful there to strengthen himself. In the end, both gods slew one another, and left parts of the city destroyed, depopulated, and in a massive [[dead-magic zone]]. Torm did not take the children of the faithful, however, leaving a generation of orphans known as the [[Martyr's Progeny]].

The god [[Talos|Talos the Destroyer]] visited Tsurlagol, and was there at the conclusion of the crisis on [[Marpenoth 15]].

Calaunt suffered great strife of its own, producing its own displaced peoples. Looting mobs of refugees from Calaunt, together with those from Tantras and [[Mulmaster]], wandered the Vast. Meanwhile, in the southern Vast, many wealthy merchants of [[Procampur]] and [[Tsurlagol]] fled to their country houses in the town of [[Maerstar]]. However, they were harassed by the mobs, who'd also come through Maerstar, and some were killed.

====Recent History====
[[File:HC-Hubadai.jpg|thumb|left|An Earthfast dwarf standing against Prince [[Hubadai]] of the [[Tuigan]].]]
With the [[Horde Wars]] in [[east Faerûn|east]] and [[Northeast Faerûn|northeastern Faerûn]] over [[1359 DR|1359]]–[[1360 DR]], a wave of refugees and immigrants fled west into Impiltur and the Vast and over the Inner Sea. The [[Tuigan Horde]] was expected to overrun [[Thesk]] and Impiltur and then the Vast, before continuing east. King [[Azoun IV]] of Cormyr called for a crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]]. The dwarf city of Earthfast was the first to join and this helped sway other allies to the cause. Tantras and Ravens Bluff sent envoys to Azoun's council on [[Tarsakh 10]], and between them contributed 4,000 volunteer soldiers, as well as wizards, to the crusade. Meanwhile, the nobles of Procampur, such as Duke [[Jozul Piniago]], contributed to, and profiteered off, the crusade by selling supplies to the army.

Although [[sahaugin]] raids increased all around the Inner Sea in [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], the ports of the Vast on the eastern Dragon Reach were inexplicably spared, leaving only the usual activity.

One night in [[1370 DR|the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], pirates launched a surprise attack on the harbor of Ravens Bluff. Crippled by the assault, the city's navy was annihilated by subsequent setbacks. On that same night, in the backlands of the Vast, the Warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] arose at the head of an army of orcs, [[ogre]]s, [[giant]]s, [[drow]] and [[human]] mercenaries, mages, and even [[demon]]s. They marched against Ravens Bluff, demanded the city's surrender, then assaulted and lay siege to the city and surrounding estates, demolishing buildings and ruining the land. This war dragged on for half the year and Ravens Bluff came close to defeat.

The Vast was among those lands covered by the [[Tyrantfog]] of 9–11 [[Mirtul]] of 1370 DR, stretching as far east as Tsurlagol. Under the fog, [[Cyric]] worshipers were afflicted with terrible diseases, while followers of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] were strengthened. Finally, items and beings filled with Bane's power were destroyed, and [[banelich]]es hidden in Tantras exploded. The Tyrantfog then burned away in green flame.

In the summer of 1370 DR, the forces of Ravens Bluff rallied and confronted those of Myrkyssa Jelan, and her war ended in the six-day-long [[Battle of Fire River]]. By its end, Myrkyssa Jelan's army had been defeated, its combatants slain or routed, but the Warlord herself had escaped. Ravens Bluff survived, but with a quarter of its army killed or injured, its fleet gone, and no means of support, but the Ravenians pulled through and rebuilt.

Later that year, Myrkyssa Jelan reappeared with another army, likely the remnants or reserves of her first, and this time marched on Tantras. She demanded the city's surrender, else she'd raze it to the ground. The Tantran [[High Council]] met with the Warlord, and they came to some agreement. The terms of this were unknown, but Jelan's army withdrew without attacking. Tantras had requested aid from Procampur and Ravens Bluff, but by the time this arrived, Jelan's army had faded into the mountains.

Later in 1370 DR, Ravens Bluff proposed the formation of a regional government in the Vast. They started by taking neighboring settlements under its control, such as [[Mossbridges]] and [[New Hope]], and thus turned Ravens Bluff into a city-state. Procampur remained neutral on the plan, preferring to wait-and-see, while Tantras strongly rejected the proposal. Local lords were unwilling to place themselves under civic authority, while others disliked being annexed, but merchants and many ordinary folk felt it would only improve prosperity of the Vast.

Through 1370 DR, there was strange news of dark goings-on in the Vast. Some unknown being, organization, or power had paid regular visits to the tombs of powerful undead creatures—and cleaned them. Another had deposited horrifying [[deepspawn]] in several old ruins to dwell there. Though adventurers and local folk kept a lookout, these bizarre practices continued and remained unexplained. Furthermore, some adventurers had found and explored old tunnel networks once used by dwarves and orcs. They disturbed orcs and more dangerous creatures, which ventured out of the mountains to hunt adventurers themselves. These made the Vast a more dangerous land for heroes. Strange monsters also began lurking in numbers around the Flooded Forest's southern marshes, including [[owlbear]]s, [[stirge]]s, and strange unknown creatures, threatening hunters from Ylraphon.

By [[Midsummer]] of [[1372 DR]], rumors spread that a powerful mercenary commander in the Vast was gathering an army of hired soldiers and adventurers. Their plan was, apparently, to capture the town of [[Scardale]] over the Dragon Reach, which would be a valuable holding for any Vast city. It was unknown who was behind this venture; some thought merchants in Calaunt or Tantras.

During the [[Dracorage]] of [[1373 DR|the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373]], on [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] 23rd a flight of [[dragons]] destroyed Ylraphon.

====Post-Spellplague====
A regional government was eventually formed in the Vast, as the formerly independent city-states of Calaunt, Ravens Bluff, and Tantras united in the nation of [[Vesperin]]. It was still a young nation by [[1479 DR]]. Tantras was named its capital.It is unknown exactly when the unification into Vesperin occurred between 1372 DR and 1479 DR.

When the second [[Netheril]] took over [[Sembia]] around [[1400 DR]], many Sembian merchants migrated to Vesperin. The majority of them settled in Ravens Bluff, making it the largest city in the nation. The Netherese rulers eventually cracked down on Sembian migration, killing would-be refugees who tried to cross to the Vast. With Sembia dominated, Impiltur in decline, and the influx of migrants, Vesperin flourished as a neutral center of trade and intrigue.
