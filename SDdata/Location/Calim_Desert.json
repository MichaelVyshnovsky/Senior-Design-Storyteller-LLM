        "mainbody": "The '''Calim Desert''', also known as the '''Skyfire Wastes''', was a rocky desert on the coast in the country of [[Calimshan]]. It was not formed by natural means, instead being the result of an epic magical war between two [[genie]]s, the [[djinni]] [[Calim]] and [[efreeti]] [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]]. The sands hid the ruins of ancient cities, which were said to hold many treasures.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The Calim Desert was primarily a level and rocky [[Wikipedia:en:Salt pan|salt flat]], yet the magical effects of Calim and Memnon could change that. These often dangerous manifestations of the two genies were called [[Calim#Description|\"Calim's Breath\"]] and [[Memnon (efreeti)#Description|\"Memnon's Crackle\"]]. The former was the cause of frequent sandstorms and whirlwinds; the latter the cause of earthquakes or the creation of patches of hot sand. The highly-porous [[worm rock]] could be found around the Calim Desert.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Heart of the Desert: Race Against Time|18}}",
            "Flora and Fauna": "Small rodents and reptiles were a few of the animals who had adapted to life in this desert. Most lived among the ruins of ancient cities. Also numerous were arachnids and insects, rabbits, weasels, toads, and vultures.\n\nThe largest creatures lived below the sands; desert [[purple worm]]s frequented the area, and unlike typical purple worms, they lived in groups.\n\nThe [[Calim cactus]] was one of the few plants able to adapt to the changing and dry surface of the Calim desert. These strange plants were the primary food source for many of the animals listed above."
        },
        "Trade and Travel": "The [[Trade Way]] cut directly across the Calim Desert from [[Calimport]] to [[Memnon]].\n\nOne could also travel around the desert along the [[Coast Trail]], but this was neither safe nor well-traveled.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], the [[Twisted Rune]] had placed a magical gate in the desert to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.",
        "History": "In long ages past, the lands that later became the Calim Desert were lush farmland, a portion of which were known as the [[Teshyllal Fields]]. The cities of [[Dashadjen]] and [[Teshyll]] were located here during the [[Calim Empire]].\n\nThe desert's creation began in {{Yearlink|-6100}}, when the [[elf|elven]] [[high mage]] [[Pharos]] trapped the bodies of Calim and Memnon in the [[Calimemnon Crystal]]. Since that time, their consciousnesses had continued to war against each other, and their magical manifestations in the air and in the ground formed and maintained the desert.\n\nIt was estimated that if Calim and Memnon were ever released&mdash;which did in fact occur during the [[Spellplague]]&mdash;the desert would take 800 to 1,000 years to return to the terrain it once was.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1450}}, the desert was frozen over for months while vassals of [[Auril]] fought against the efreet and genies of Calimshan.{{Cite dragon/367/Hall of the Frostmaiden|61}}",
        "Legends": "Every year on [[Ches 4]], locals claimed that the night winds howled with the sound of the hundreds of trapped genies within the Calimemnon Crystal, as that day was the anniversary of their entrapment.",
