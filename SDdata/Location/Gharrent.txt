'''Gharrent''', [[Jhaamdath]]'s '''Fourth City of the Sword''', was one of main cities in the ancient Jhaamdathan empire.

==Geography==
The Fourth City was a few days west of the First City, [[Naarkolyth]], just south of [[Golmuth]] and the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. After its destruction, it lay in the [[Selmal Basin]] beneath the waters of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
Gharrent was founded in {{Yearlink|-5425}} as the fourth of Jhaamdath's cities, followed the same year by nearby [[Golmuth]].

Jhaamdath entered into a period of imperial conquest in the {{YearlinkName|-276}}, which resulted in aggressive deforestation of the [[Chondalwood]] and the slaughter of the [[Nikerymath]] [[elves]]. The elves responded in the {{YearlinkName|-255}} by performing a [[High Magic]] ritual that caused a great wave from the [[Inner Sea]] to wash over the Cities of the Sword and destroy the core of Jhaamdath. Gharrent remained a sunken ruin hidden in the Reach, with its lost [[psionic]] artifacts slowly affecting the surrounding environment.

The sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. This was almost as quickly reversed in [[1486 DR]] by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]] that hid the ruins once more.
