Gharrent, Jhaamdaths Fourth City of the Sword, was one of main cities in the ancient Jhaamdathan empire.

Gharrent was founded in  as the fourth of Jhaamdaths cities, followed the same year by nearby Golmuth.
Jhaamdath entered into a period of imperial conquest in the , which resulted in aggressive deforestation of the Chondalwood and the slaughter of the Nikerymath elves. The elves responded in the  by performing a High Magic ritual that caused a great wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the Cities of the Sword and destroy the core of Jhaamdath. Gharrent remained a sunken ruin hidden in the Reach, with its lost psionic artifacts slowly affecting the surrounding environment.
The sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR, becoming the Vilhon Wilds. This was almost as quickly reversed in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering that hid the ruins once more.
