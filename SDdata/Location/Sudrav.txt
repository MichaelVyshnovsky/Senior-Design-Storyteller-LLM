'''Sudrav''' was a small mining town found in the farthest southern reaches of [[Arcata]] in [[Damara]].

==Geography==
Sudrav was nestled with the [[Earthwood]] forest at the foot of the [[Earthspur Mountains]].

==Inhabitants==
Disgusted by the politics of Damara, inhabitants despised Duke [[William]] and were not afraid to burn his effigies. Inhabitants of Sudrav considered themselves more politically aligned with [[Impiltur]]. They even went so far as to secretly ask Impiltur to annex their town. Though [[Imphras II]] refused the request, he did promise aid if needed.
