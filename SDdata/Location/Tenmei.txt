Tenmei was one of the four largest islands making up Kozakura.
Tenmei, the second largest island in Kozakura, was positioned to the north of Shinkoku, forming the northern limit of the Inland Sea. While the central mountainous region of Tenmei did not reach the same towering heights as those in Shinkoku, its peaks were characterized by steeper inclines and dense forest cover. The northeastern portion, near Tanegawa, was marked by the Gosuki Range, while the southwestern section is recognized as the Teeth of Kanfu.
The densely forested Gosuki Range in Tenmei was home to the largest population of korobokuru in Kozakura. The human inhabitants of Tenmei, recognizing the challenging nature of mining metals in the inhospitable high mountains, willingly yielded this occupation to the korobokuru residing there.
Instead, humans in Tenmei sustained themselves through rice farming and fishing in the Inland Sea. Additionally, they engaged in trade, particularly in ceramics crafted from the distinctive clays discovered near the city of Yoshida. Yoshida served as the capital of Tenmei Province and was the seat of power for the shugo-daimyo Suzuki Motosune.
To the north, the town of Tanegawa was inhabited by both humans and korobokuru. The port of Tanegawa facilitates the trade of tin and copper, as well as clandestine activities involving the smuggling of luxury goods from the island of Eburishima.
Oni lived in the mountains and the Kanfu Forest.
This island housed the Red Fog cult, a dissident sect of the Konjo school. The Red Fog cult lived around Daidake, a volcanic region.
