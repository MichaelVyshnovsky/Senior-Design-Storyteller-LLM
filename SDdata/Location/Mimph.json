        "mainbody": "Mimph was a coastal city of Sespech. It could only be reached by sea or overland travel as no road led to this city. Despite this limitation, it still saw a fair amount of overland trade.\nMimph was a busy port city with its harbor chuck-full of ships nestled so close to each other, their masts looked like a thick leaf-less winter wood. Most buildings in Mimph were made out hand-raved of pale gray granite and were shaped like sharp-angled small, simple squares. All doors and windows were square as well, and sharp-looking flights of stairs veered around the hilly city, leading up the towns piers.\nThe streets of Mimph were often filled with town criers and over-eager advertisers, usually young humans, who tried their best to out-scream their peers and lead guests of the city to inns and taverns who paid for the criers services. Street vendors were equally aggressive in selling their goods. Women were known to sell sweet, and hot mulled wine by a tankard for six coppers per serving. And the citys doxies were a common sight in the neighborhoods near the docks.\nThe citys rulership was in the hands of the Overlord. The title belonged to Admiral Kalisa Tauno as of 1372 DR. Unlike many other rulers of Sespech, Kalisa was not one of Baron Aldorn Thuragars – the leader of Sespechs, past adventuring companions. Before that, High Priest Marasa Ferrentio of Helm and the spiritual guide for Baron Thuragar was the citys Overlord, before retiring to focus on the work of the Church of Helm.\nBaron Aldorn Thuragar was a regular and often unexpected visitor in Mimph. The other cities of Sespech received Baron frequently as well. Mimph visits for the ruler of the nation often included attending service at the local Temple of Helm. \nMimph and its closest naval neighbor – Arrabar, shared certain animosity towards each other. Many merchants conducted business in only one of the two cities at the time not to provoke the other. It was common for the Arrabarran vessels to board ships heading to Mimph and claiming their cargo.\nDespite lacking land trade routes, Mimph received merchants who disliked doing business with Chondath. These caravans left the Old Road after reaching Ormpetarr and traveled through roadless territory or took boats across the Nagawater.\nIn the late 14 center DR, Baron Aldorn Thuragar ordered a navy built based out of Mimph, creating its sizable naval defenses to battle piracy by the Arrabarran fleet. \nLand defenses of Mimph often included mercenary adventuring companies who were contracted to serve as the citys guards. Mimph hired private naval vessels as well. The ships escorted rich merchant vessels.\nMimph, like other cities of Sespech, was a part of a well-connected pay network. Spies from Arrabar and other major cities in the area traveled to Mimph to deposit collected covert intel on military activities, news, and trade deals information. Mimphs messengers collected the intel and forwarded it to the cities of Fort Arran or Ormpetarr.\nThe city of Mimph was established in the  to the west from the capital of Chondath – Arrabar. For several years, the shiny new city was overshadowing Arrabar, attracting inhabitants and trade away, threatening to leave its neighbor a short town. The aggressive growth was thwarted by Arrabarran armies in the  that razed Mimph.\nAs years passed and the Chondathian Empire established the Barony of Sespech, the city of Mimph quietly sprouted back to life. Soon, Sespechians grew dissatisfied with the Chondathian rule, and Mimph, along with the other Barony cities, failed several tempts to gain independence. The separation was completed in the , as the Rotting War decimated the Chondathian Empire.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Lord Eles Wianar of Chondath was plotting to invade Sespech via a land attack on the city of Elbulder and simultaneously – a naval strike on Mimph. Previous attacks on the cities were nothing but probes and reconnaissance. Wianar believed that this strategy would saw confusion among the cities of Sespech.\n*Bluefish Inn, a well-advertised establishment that served good food and drink.\n*Tangled Net Tavern, a tavern not far from the towns harbours.\n*Travelers Rest, a clean inn that offered its services for mere five silvers.\n*Temple of Helm, the citys newest church that expanded from being a humble shrine. It was led by High Priest Marasa Ferrentio as of 1372 DR.\n*Thieves guild, the city of Mimph had a secretive thieves and rogues guild.\n*House Ludini, a noble merchant family of Mimph with a member of the house serving in the Waukeenar mercenary company – the Order of the Sapphire Crescent of Arrabar circa 1374 DR.\n*Dazratha Alaemalarr, the Sage of Mimph and author of Lady in Chains, or I Say What I See."
