'''Psamma''' was a small town found in western [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Geography==
Psamma was located along the southern bank of the [[River Gur]].

==Activities==
Psamma was a small and simple trading center. In the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, residents of Psamma sunk a new well, revealing a series of underground tunnels that appeared to have been used as tombs by [[yuan-ti]] in the past. Explorers retrieved various yuan-ti artifacts, but the officials of Psamma quickly forbade any further delving into the catacombs. Armed guards were stationed at the main entrances, but new yuan-ti artifacts continued to surface from time to time, suggesting that new entrances into the tunnels had been dug.
