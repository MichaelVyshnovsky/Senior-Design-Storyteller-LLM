It was devoted to Ilmater, the Crying God.\nIt lay sprawling across three hilltops west of the Lapal Way,\nDuring the time of the Shoon Imperium (27–450 DR), Ilmatari missionaries of the Order of St. Uzurr from Calimshan traveled to Lapaliiya and founded a walled monastery called the Cloister of St. Uzurr. In the following centuries, a city grew up around the monastery, known simply as \"Uzurr\".\nYuan-ti purebloods began infiltrating Uzurr on Eleasias 1, the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR with the aim of assassinating Abbot Kadar al Ilmater and stopping his research into curing tainted ones and broodguards.\nThe city was dominated by the Order, and ruled by the Abbot of St. Uzurr this was Kadar al Ilmater circa 1373 DR.
