        "Geography": "Callidyrr encompassed all but the far northern section of Alaron, including the [[Fairheight Range]] and all lands south of the mountains. The kingdom was broken into four distinct counties. Aside from the Fairheight Range, the [[Dernall Forest]] was the dominant feature in northern Callidyrr, while the plains of [[Bregonshire]] covered much of southern Callidyrr.{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}",
        "Defenses": "The kingdom had an army that mustered alongside its [[knight|knights of the realm]]. During the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an elite force known as the [[Callidyrr dragoons]] rose to prominence: these particularly loyal knights and heroes had the power to speak with the authority of the High Kings and Queens, and often embarked on clandestine missions for the crown.{{Cite dragon/405/Heroes of the Moonshaes|5}}",
        "History": "Callidyrr, and [[Caer Callidyrr]] in particular, served as the seat of power for the High King of the Ffolk. The kingdom's vast array of natural resources attracted more visitors from the [[Sword Coast]] when compared with any other region of the Moonshae Isles. This eventually lead to a population that was more mixed than others amount the isles."
