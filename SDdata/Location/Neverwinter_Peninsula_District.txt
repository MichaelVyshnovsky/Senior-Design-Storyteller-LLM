The '''Peninsula District''' was one of the districts of [[Neverwinter]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Geography==
The Peninsula District was named for the geographic peninsula that conformed most of the territory of this district. Most of this district was taken up by the [[Neverwinter's Prison|prison of Neverwinter]].

==History==
===Plague and War===
During the city's struggle with the [[Wailing Death]] in [[1372 DR]], the district was in turmoil because of a prison break. However, the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] was able to deal with this problem.

The Peninsula District was badly damaged during the war against [[Luskan]].

===Eruption===
When [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted in [[1451 DR]], bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, most of the City Core was left untouched by the pyroclastic flow. When [[Dagult Neverember]] began his efforts to rebuild Neverwinter, in the late years of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], he fused the [[City Core (Neverwinter)|City Core]], the Peninsula District and the Merchant Quarter into only one area. Eventually, the survivors of the cataclysm renamed this new area the [[Protector's Enclave]].
