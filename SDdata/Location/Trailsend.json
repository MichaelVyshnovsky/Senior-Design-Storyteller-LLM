It was the last stop in Damara for merchants travelling south with [[bloodstone]], and the first stop from Impiltur for traders bringing supplies north to [[Helgabal]], passed through the city. A local population of [[dwarf|dwarven]] craftsfolk contributed to the city's own exports, with their production of fine [[armor]] being of particular note.",
