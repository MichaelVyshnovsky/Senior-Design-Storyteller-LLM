The island took its name from Hawk, a pirate who used the island as his hold whilst competing with Immurk.\nIts inhabitants were horribly deformed after a plague struck the island at some point in the past. The island had the remains of more than twelve harbors, but the inhabitants only had the ability to use canoes. Wildlife was abundant."
