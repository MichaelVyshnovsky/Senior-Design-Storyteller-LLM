'''Laothkund''' was a city in the [[Unapproachable East]], on the coast of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|107}} It was later known as '''Laothkund the Drowned''' after it sank into the sea.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|89}}

==Geography==
There were caverns beneath Laothkund, which the [[merro]] sons of the great shaman [[Porag]] wanted as part of their reign.{{cite book/Sea of Fallen Stars|145}}

==Government==
''Circa'' {{yearlink|764}}, Laothkund had a number of lords.{{cite book/The Temptation of Elminster/Paperback 1999|?|9}}

The independent city had been under [[Thayan]] control since {{yearlink|1357}}. and loosely as of {{yearlink|1372}}.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|100}} Like much of the [[Wizards' Reach]], the [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm]] had strong influence there.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|84}}

A ruling council existed on {{yearlink|1375}}, which the [[Shadow Tongue]] thieves had plans to blackmail by implicating them in false conspiracies with the [[Red Wizards]], and slave trade in children (which was illicit).{{cite book/Stardeep|25|3}}

==History==
The region was first settled by people from [[Chessenta]] between {{yearlink|-250}} and {{yearlink|-100}}.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|58}}{{cite book/Unapproachable East|104}} The city of Laothkund broke free of [[Unther]] in {{yearlink|482}}.{{cite book/Dreams of the Red Wizards|5}}{{cite book/Old Empires|5}} Unther abandoned its wars on {{yearlink|679}} to focus on reclaiming Laothkund.{{cite book/Sea of Fallen Stars|6}}

In the late {{yearlinkName|764}},Per the Google Books version of ''Temptation'', its realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster they're in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764. Given Feldrin's warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. the armies of the Lords of Laothkund struck at Nethrar (later [[Nethra]]){{cite book/The Temptation of Elminster/Paperback 1999|?|10}} in [[Galadorna]], destroying the Unicorn Kingdom forever.{{cite book/The Temptation of Elminster/Paperback 1999|217|11}}Elminster has been the seneschal of Galadorna for a year at the time of Nethrar's destruction, and he is anointed such on the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR.

Laothkund was important to [[Gargauth]]'s worship.{{cite book/Powers and Pantheons|180}}

The city came under Thayan control in {{yearlink|1357}}, during the [[Salamander War]].{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|142}}{{cite book/Unapproachable East|105}} During the [[Spellplague]] of {{yearlink|1385}}, Laothkund's Thayvian government was secured and reinforced by the forces of [[Mordulkin]].{{cite book/Undead}} They city became Laothkund the Drowned at most a decade later, by {{yearlink|1396}},{{cite book/City of Torment|13|2}} after the seismic shifts from the Spellplague caused the land to sink beneath the waves.

By {{Yearlink|1479}}, the submerged and silted streets were populated only by [[fish]] and sea monsters. Much of the city's old wealth had yet to be plundered.

==Demographics==
[[Half-elves]] of [[wood elf]] stock were very common in the city.{{cite book/Stardeep|19|3}} Like in the rest of the [[Wizards' Reach]], the humans were a grand majority [[Mulan]], with a smaller number of [[Chondathan]]s and [[Rashemi]], and a small fraction of [[Damaran]]s.{{cite book/Races of Faer√ªn|111}}

==Weather==
Gusts from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] usually kept the city fairly temperate, even in [[Midwinter]].{{cite book/Stardeep|18|3}}

==Notable Locations==
===Sal's Tavern===
Sal's tavern was a location close to the Shadow Tongue lair. The local sentries were known to go there.{{cite book/Stardeep|19|3}}

===Tannery===
The tannery was a quarter with narrow streets.{{cite book/Stardeep|19-20|3}}

===Smokehouse Inn===
This inn served alcohol, and included locations for armwrestling.{{cite book/Stardeep|55|6}}

===Shadow Tongue Lair===
The lair of the [[Shadow Tongue]] thieves' guild was on a building at least three stories tall, with one window on the third story boarded up on the outside and brick-and-mortared from the inside.{{cite book/Stardeep|20|3}} The room that bore that window had been converted to a storage closet; down the hallway, there were rooms, a downwards-pointing stair with a switchback, and on the hallway below, at least one office and one privy. A hidden panel led to another set of stairs, and an iron-valved door that led to the vault, which doubled as Sathra's personal quarters.{{cite book/Stardeep|22-27|3}}

In the vault, objects of great value were stored. Two [[smokeless torch]]es were placed on stone pillars flanking the entrance; the shade of the pillars kept the back of the room dark. The obsidian tiles of the vault helped keep the room dark.{{cite book/Stardeep|45-46|5}} There was a fabled red room somewhere else in the lair, where [[Sathra]] could visit unlikely tortures on her foes.{{cite book/Stardeep|47|5}}

===Green Warrior Inn and Tavern===
This tavern featured some women of the night.{{cite book/Stardeep|58-60|6}}

===Tenambulum's Library===
The mage [[Tenambulum]] had a library in the city as of {{yearlink|1374}}. There were wards in it.{{cite book/Stardeep|21|3}}

==Inhabitants==
*[[Gage]]
*[[Sathra]]
*[[Tenambulum]]
==Trivia==
*The price of a used scroll would buy a tenday's worth of staying at the highest festhall in Laothkund, per [[Gage]].{{cite book/Stardeep|243|22}}
*The [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] [[Telarian]] purchased some of his supplies in the city.{{cite book/Stardeep|7|1}}
