Laothkund was a city in the Unapproachable East, on the coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars. It was later known as Laothkund the Drowned after it sank into the sea.
There were caverns beneath Laothkund, which the merro sons of the great shaman Porag wanted as part of their reign.
Circa , Laothkund had a number of lords.
The independent city had been under Thayan control since . and loosely as of . Like much of the Wizards Reach, the Shadowmasters of Telflamm had strong influence there.
A ruling council existed on , which the Shadow Tongue thieves had plans to blackmail by implicating them in false conspiracies with the Red Wizards, and slave trade in children (which was illicit).
The region was first settled by people from Chessenta between  and . The city of Laothkund broke free of Unther in . Unther abandoned its wars on  to focus on reclaiming Laothkund.
In the late ,Per the Google Books version of Temptation, its realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster theyre in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764. Given Feldrins warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. the armies of the Lords of Laothkund struck at Nethrar (later Nethra) in Galadorna, destroying the Unicorn Kingdom forever.Elminster has been the seneschal of Galadorna for a year at the time of Nethrars destruction, and he is anointed such on the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR.
Laothkund was important to Gargauths worship.
The city came under Thayan control in , during the Salamander War. During the Spellplague of , Laothkunds Thayvian government was secured and reinforced by the forces of Mordulkin. They city became Laothkund the Drowned at most a decade later, by , after the seismic shifts from the Spellplague caused the land to sink beneath the waves.
By , the submerged and silted streets were populated only by fish and sea monsters. Much of the citys old wealth had yet to be plundered.
Half-elves of wood elf stock were very common in the city. Like in the rest of the Wizards Reach, the humans were a grand majority Mulan, with a smaller number of Chondathans and Rashemi, and a small fraction of Damarans.
Gusts from the Sea of Fallen Stars usually kept the city fairly temperate, even in Midwinter.
Sals tavern was a location close to the Shadow Tongue lair. The local sentries were known to go there.
The tannery was a quarter with narrow streets.
This inn served alcohol, and included locations for armwrestling.
The lair of the Shadow Tongue thieves guild was on a building at least three stories tall, with one window on the third story boarded up on the outside and brick-and-mortared from the inside. The room that bore that window had been converted to a storage closet down the hallway, there were rooms, a downwards-pointing stair with a switchback, and on the hallway below, at least one office and one privy. A hidden panel led to another set of stairs, and an iron-valved door that led to the vault, which doubled as Sathras personal quarters.
In the vault, objects of great value were stored. Two smokeless torches were placed on stone pillars flanking the entrance the shade of the pillars kept the back of the room dark. The obsidian tiles of the vault helped keep the room dark. There was a fabled red room somewhere else in the lair, where Sathra could visit unlikely tortures on her foes.
This tavern featured some women of the night.
The mage Tenambulum had a library in the city as of . There were wards in it.

*The Keeper of the Cerulean Sign Telarian purchased some of his supplies in the city.
