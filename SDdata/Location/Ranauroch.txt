Ranauroch was a site mentioned in the Saga of the Dragon Queller, a giant ballad. In it, the giant hero Hjurgen was known as the "leveler of Ranauroch".
Ranauroch was believed to be a prehistoric kingdom or citadel but no evidence of its existence was found. Owing to the similar name, it was commonly believed to be beneath Anauroch.
