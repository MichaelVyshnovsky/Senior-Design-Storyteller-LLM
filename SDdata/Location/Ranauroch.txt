'''Ranauroch''' was a site mentioned in the ''[[Saga of the Dragon Queller]]'', a [[giant]] ballad. In it, the giant hero [[Hjurgen]] was known as the "leveler of Ranauroch".

Ranauroch was believed to be a prehistoric kingdom or citadel but no evidence of its existence was found. Owing to the similar name, it was commonly believed to be beneath [[Anauroch]].
