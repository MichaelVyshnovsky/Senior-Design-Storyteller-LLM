        "mainbody": "'''New Sarshel''' was a busy trade city on the coast of [[Impiltur]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "New Sarshel was founded in response to the decline of trade through [[Sarshel]] following the rise of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in [[Damara]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. Incensed by what they saw as indifference on the part of Sarshel's rulers as Damaran trade dried up and the city began to stagnate and shrink, fifteen merchants financed the construction of New Sarshel just across the water. By the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the newly built city was vying to steal business away from Sarshel, especially trade from the east. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful, and many presumed that the upstart city was as like as not to be abandoned within a year.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the waters of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] receded, leaving many port cities&mdash;like [[Dilpur]] and [[Hlammach]]&mdash;high-and-dry. However, thanks to its history and dire situation, New Sarshel was better able than any other city to rapidly build structures that kept up with the dropping water level, and it thus became an increasingly important and prosperous trading hub as the folk of these other cities flocked there. Competition within New Sarshel was fierce, and as the city became increasingly favored as a trading partner of [[Telflamm]] and the [[Great Dale]], it even captured some of [[Lyrabar]]'s trade. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, New Sarshel was continuing to grow, and Sarshel had come to be known as part of New Sarshel.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, several members of Impiltur's ruling council lived in New Sarshel, which increased the city's influence. Owing to the huge influx of people and competition that the city had experienced following the Spellplague, New Sarshel was full of ruined merchants who had to scrounge for other sources of income.",
