'''Briarbosk''' was a [[Wild elf|sy-tel-quessir]] [[village]] in the [[Tangled Vale]]

==History==
Briarbosk was inhabited by the wild elven clan of the same name. The village became the first target of the [[green dragon]], [[Venominhandar]]'s, assault against elven communities of Cormanthor in {{Yearlink|-982}}, but the local [[Elf|elves]] survived.

The surviving elves of the clan met their end years later in an ill-fated attempt to avenge themselves on Venominhandar. The attacker's on [[Venom's Lair]] died all and sundry leaving Briarbosk abandoned.

A couple of decaying tree dwellings was all that was left of the village. It was rumored that Briarbosk's ruins were visited by the [[baelnorn]] from the [[Vale of Lost Voices]]. Some said the baelnorn came there to reminisce about their bygone days of life.
