Highcastle, which earned its name from the keep located just south, was the largest community in High Dale. It served as a crossroads between Cormyr and Sembia. Despite there being no permanent trading companies in all of High Dale, many traders would come to the city to trade in the warmer spring and summer months.
The city of Highcastle was home to High Dales ruling body, the Dale Council and the High Constable, which was Irreph Mulmar in 1367 DR. It also housed their militia, the mercenaries known as the Pegasus Archery Company and Irrephs militaristic endeavor, the Flying Auxiliary.
 The Dale Council Chamber This complex included the council hall, a barracks for the Watchmen and the manor of the High Constable.
 The Eagles Eyrie A small, dirty inn that primarily catered to travelers on a budget.
 The Shield and Keep An alehouse that was quite popular among the Highdalesmen.
 The Swordsmiths House This rather fine inn would close down during the winter months due to lack of business.
 Frogfoots Provisions A general store that provided some rations and finished crafts and goods.
 Ironhands Arms This weapon shop was run by a dwarven smith named Azan Stonesplitter.
 Arrowpoint Home to the Pegasus Archery Company, this holding included a barracks and stables and was encircled by an earthwork.
 High Castle The now-ruined castle was once the seat of power for the bandit-king, Baron Amadin.
There were no major temples in Highcastle, though the town did have a small chapel of Tempus, watched over by Sheila Wyndlass.
