'''Highcastle''', which earned its name from the [[High Castle|keep]] located just south, was the largest community in [[High Dale]]. It served as a crossroads between [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]]. Despite there being no permanent trading companies in all of High Dale, many traders would come to the city to trade in the warmer spring and summer months.

==Government and defense==
The city of Highcastle was home to High Dale's ruling body, the [[Dale Council]] and the [[High Constable]], which was [[Irreph Mulmar]] in [[1367 DR]]. It also housed their militia, the mercenaries known as the [[Pegasus Archery Company]] and Irreph's militaristic endeavor, the [[Flying Auxiliary]].
 
==Notable locations==
; The Dale Council Chamber: This complex included the council hall, a barracks for the Watchmen and the manor of the High Constable.

===Inns and taverns===
; [[The Eagles' Eyrie]]: A small, dirty inn that primarily catered to travelers on a budget.

; [[The Shield and Keep]]: An alehouse that was quite popular among the Highdalesmen.

; [[The Swordsmith's House]]: This rather fine inn would close down during the winter months due to lack of business.

===Shops===
; [[Frogfoot's Provisions]]: A general store that provided some rations and finished crafts and goods.

; [[Ironhand's Arms]]: This weapon shop was run by a [[dwarven]] smith named [[Azan Stonesplitter]].

===Strongholds===
; [[Arrowpoint]]: Home to the Pegasus Archery Company, this holding included a barracks and stables and was encircled by an earthwork.

; [[High Castle]]: The now-ruined castle was once the seat of power for the bandit-king, [[Amadin|Baron Amadin]].

===Temples===
There were no major temples in Highcastle, though the town did have a small chapel of [[Tempus]], watched over by [[Sheila Wyndlass]].
