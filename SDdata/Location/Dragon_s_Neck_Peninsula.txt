The '''Dragon's Neck Peninsula''' was the eastern part of the [[Tethyr Peninsula]], with the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]] being its western part.The sourcebooks use the names Dragon's Neck Peninsula and later Tethyr Peninsula interchangeably. However, more precise geography was introduced in ''Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate II''. To avoid confusion, the page uses the Tethyr Peninsula to refer to the entire landmass, Dragon's Head Peninsula to refer to the western part of the land (also called the [[Velen Peninsula]]), and the Dragon's Neck Peninsula to refer to the eastern part of the Tethyr Peninsula.

==Description==
Most of the peninsula was covered by the wild [[Forest of Tethir]] with the [[Firedrake Road]] crossing it on the southern bank. That stretch of the road was dangerous and sometimes hard to pass because of narrow trails, wild beasts, and bandits. The hamlet of [[Jhaansciim]] was the first notable settlement along the road in the Dragon's Neck Peninsula, several miles away from [[Khalid's Wall]], a long ruined wall perpendicular to the shoreline.

==Geography==
The Tethyr Peninsula was a landmass that protruded from the mainland of Tethyr in a shape that resembled a [[dragon]] with its maw wide open. The eastern part was called the Dragon's Neck Peninsula, aptly named for its shape being that of a dragon's neck. [[Tarseth Bay]] washed the northern side of the Dragon's Neck and the [[Firedrake Bay]] to the south.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Burnt Bones Cove]], once a prosperous settlement called [[Larungyr]], later, a peaceful cove with remnants of the burnt town, on the north-eastern edge of the peninsula.
*[[Honorguard House]], a fortified manor of [[County Fyraven]].
*[[Kaalinth]], a small city keep that collapsed into the [[Tarseth Bay]] many years before the 14{{th}} century DR.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Notable Inhabitants==
*[[Cephalopolop]], the [[kraken]] ruler of an underwater city of [[Sloopdilmonpolop]], deep underneath the Dragon's Neck Peninsula.
