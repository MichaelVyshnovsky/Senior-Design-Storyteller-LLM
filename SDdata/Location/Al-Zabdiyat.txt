Al-Zabdiyat, or the Bowl, was a group of mountainous islands located near Masud Jazayir in the Nada al-Hazan achipelago in the Crowded Sea.
The islands of Al-Zabdiyat were crescent shaped laying at the mouth of the Strait of Woe.
Most travelers and sailors avoided these islands because of Khadiga. The shair was known to keep dangerous "pets" that discouraged visitors to her sanctuary.
A great domed mausoleum made of clear crystal was rumored to rise from the center of the lagoon.
