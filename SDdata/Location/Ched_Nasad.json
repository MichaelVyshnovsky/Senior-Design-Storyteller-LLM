        "Geography": "Ched Nasad was located in the [[Middledark|Middle]] [[Northdark]] beneath the [[High Gap]] in the northern [[Graypeak Mountains]].\n\nIt was connected to the surface via tunnels through [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] to the north, which eventually led to [[orc]]-held caverns in the [[Nether Mountains]] and the [[Fardrimm]]. Access points along the way could be found through the [[Nameless Dungeon]], [[Hellgate Dell]], and the ruins of [[Myth Glaurach]].\n[[Menzoberranzan]] was a journey of several tendays to the northwest on the other side of [[Araumycos]]. The path through Ammarindar was the quickest journey between Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad, but it was less traveled because of the danger that lurked there.\n\nA portal to the ruins of [[Hlaungadath]] in [[Anauroch]] was located in the [[Dangling Tower]]. It is through this portal that [[Quenthel Baenre]], [[Halisstra Melarn]], and their companions were able to escape the destruction of Ched Nasad in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Structure": {
            "Pre-destruction": "The city was located in a large V-shaped cavern. The grotto was nearly a mile high and half a mile wide at the top (narrower at the bottom). The walls of the cavern were very steep.\n\nThe city had magically controlled lighting. The city structure was built of layers of petrified webs that were bathed in [[faerie fire]] that was usually purple, amber, green, and yellow. Hundreds of webs stretch across the cavern, with nearly vertical webs connecting layers; for ease, the city was generally split into eleven major horizontal levels.\n\nThe higher the level in Ched Nasad, the richer and better its inhabitants were. Non-drow needed permission to visit the upper levels. However, in the lower levels, few drow were found on the streets. The business section of the city was located on the middle levels.\nWater runoff along the cavern wall fostered farms of molds, lichen, and fungi. The cavern floor was used for the rearing of [[rothe|deep rothe]] tended by goblin slaves.\n\nMultiple gates lead into the city. The Fracture Gate opened up into the lowest quarters of the city.",
            "Post-destruction": "After its destruction, the city was a ruined heap, with much of the central city lying in rubble on the cavern floor after being bombed by the attacking duergar. All that remained were the minor Houses attached to the walls of the cavern or located in adjoining caverns.\n\nThe Jaezred Chaulssin quickly moved in to take charge of the rebuilding of the city. Within a few months, the bottom of the chasm had already began melding with the [[Shadow Fringe]] (part of the [[Plane of Shadow]])."
        },
        "History": {
            "Founding": "Ched Nasad was founded in {{Yearlink|-3843}} by exiles from Menzoberranzan who had sided with [[House Nasadra]] against [[House S'sril]] after the city was nearly destroyed by [[House Thaeyalla]]. Afterward, House Baenre encouraged House Nasadra to found another city honoring  [[Lolth]], the Spider Queen, while those who sided with House S'sril remained. An avatar of Lolth herself appeared and gave her blessing to this plan, decreeing that the two cities were to remain friendly with each other.\n\nThe Nasadran drow wandered for decades before Lolth's avatar led them to the grotto where they were to found their new city. Before it left, the avatar wove a great web throughout the cavern which was turned into stone and lined with faerie fire.\n\nChed Nasad flourished despite regular fighting with the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Ammarindar]], the beholders of the [[Graypeaks Hive]], the [[phaerimm]] beneath [[Anauroch]], and the [[fiend]]s of [[Hellgate Keep]].\n\nIn [[1233 DR]], a number of drow from [[House Mylyl]] left the city for the [[Far Forest]] to continue their magical experiments and ended up creating the [[chitine]] race.",
            "Destruction": "During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]] when Lolth did not communicate with her clergy or grant them spells, a plot by the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] (inadvertently) led to the near-complete destruction of the city on [[Uktar 3]] 3.\n\nThe city was already in upheaval at this time, as mobs arose in the city due to people blaming the priestesses of Lolth for angering the Spider Queen and fearing invasion. Additionally, refugees had flooded the city; it was estimated that there were three times as many people in the city as there were normally, and many of them were starving.\n\nHowever, the true trouble began when the [[matron mother]] of a minor merchant house, [[Ssipriina Zauvirr]] of [[House Zauvirr]], used [[Zammzt]] to hire the [[duergar]] mercenary band [[Clan Xornbane]] to aid her in destroying her rival, [[House Melarn (Ched Nasad)|House Melarn]]. What Ssipriina didn't know, however, was that Zammzt was in fact a prince of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] and his intention was to weaken the city so that his group could take over. He provided [[stonefire]] to the mercenaries and prematurely gave them word to attack. The stonefire destroyed House Melarn but also had a massively destructive effect on the city, causing the house and the layer of web on which it was build to fall into the chasm and destroy the levels underneath it.\n\nIn order to defend the city, the five of the most powerful matron mothers ([[Aunrae Nasadra]], [[Umrae D'Dgttu]], [[Nedylene Zinard]], [[Ulviirala Rilynt]], and [[ShriNeerune Hlaund]]) summoned a humongous black [[guardian spider]]. However, the guardian spider (and soon another guardian spider it summoned) was never in their telepathic control, due to the artifacts being divine artifacts and tied to the power of Lolth, and began raging through the city, further compounding the chaos.\n\nEventually, the entire city fell into the chasm in smoke and flames, marking the end of the great days of Ched Nasad.",
            "Post-destruction": "It was estimated that half of Ched Nasad perished in the fall and a third fled into the tunnels. There were over 6,000 (presumably drow) who survived the initial destruction of the city and remained there, but over the next few months, nearly half of those died of privation or to monsters or simply left the city. A dozen minor houses who located on the sides of the chasm and in side caverns survived, although their holdings were quickly ransacked and they were forced to live in camps on the edge of the hole that is the city. Gangs, many run by non-drow ex-slaves, cropped up in the area.\n\n[[House Teh'Kinrelliz]] was one house that survived because its noble members were away on a chitine hunt. Because of its size, it quickly rose to a position of power, setting up tools for reclamation at the edge of the city's pit and capturing slaves to do the work for them.\n\n[[Zesstra Aleanrahel]], a daughter of one of the ruling houses, survived the city's destruction and gathered a cult of more than 70 worshipers of [[Shar]] to enact revenge on her remaining enemies. Her zeal turned away many of the cultists, however.\n\nAdditionally, the evil [[blue dragon]] [[Krashos Morueme|Krashos]], disguised as a drow named \"Quevven Jusztiirn,\" was living in the city at the time of its disaster. He survived, but lost some magical items he attempted to retrieve by capturing a fire genasi named [[Hurnoj Rikrekts]] to do his dirty work.\n\nAt the end of the Silence of Lolth in [[1373 DR]], the Jaezred Chaulssin moved to control the ruins of Ched Nasad.\n\nAfter their siege against [[Menzoberranzan]] failed, the Jaezred Chaulssin realized that they couldn't restore Ched Nasad on their own and left for [[Chaulssin]], and enforced to have influence in the city's power structure.",
            "Post-Spellplague": "Ched Nasad was officially ruled by a ruling council of seven Houses with [[House Teh'Kinrellz]] as the leading House and its matron [[Faathryll Teh'Kinrellz]] in full control of it. The council was considered an abomination by the one in [[Menzoberranzan]], because House Teh'Kinrellz's male members held power that equaled and sometimes exceeded the one owned by the female [[cleric]]s of [[Lolth]]. These male [[drow]] were controlled by in turn by the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]]. The city in general had a close association with the [[assassin]]s' guild, under Patron Father [[Zammzt Everharn]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}} While much of the city remained in ruins, the arrangement of power proved itself successful. The lower city was civilized enough to allow trade to be reestablished with Menzoberranzan. While ideological differences between the cities were a problem, there were also more tangible problems for this trade in the form of the [[beholder]]s of [[Graypeaks Hive]] and the [[tanarukk]]s  from [[Ammarindar]].\n\nIn [[1463 DR]], Menzoberranyr drow talking about the city said it had never been rebuilt."
        },
        "Government": {
            "Pre-destruction": "The city was officially ruled by the Council, which was composed of the [[matron mother]]s of the first twelve houses of the city. In [[1370 DR]], those leaders were [[Aunrae Nasadra]], [[Umrae D'Dgttu]], [[Drisinil Melarn]], [[Shyntlara Auvryndar]], [[Inidil Mylyl]], [[Jyslin Aleanrahel]], [[Talabrina Claddath]], [[Ulviirala Rilynt]] ([[House Rilynt'tar]]), [[Lirdnolu Maerret]], [[Nedylene Zinard]], [[Pellanistra Ousstyl]], and [[ShriNeerune Hlaund]]. However, as the matron mother of the most powerful house in Ched Nasad, [[Aunrae Nasadra]] of [[House Nasadra]] (matron since [[689 DR]]) held the greatest power, said to be unmatched even by the scope of [[Yvonnel Baenre]] of [[House Baenre]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].\n\nWhile the rule of the clergy and the noble houses was absolute, both wizards and merchants wielded great influence.",
            "Post-destruction": "After the destruction of the city, the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] took control of the city. They were a group of [[shadow dragon]]-blooded assassins that were determined to rid drow society of the worship of Lolth and the matriarchy."
        },
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Pre-destruction": "Before Ched Nasad's destruction in [[1372 DR]],the city had a population of just under 30,000 drow. That figure had been declining somewhat for centuries due to the common in-fighting, politics, and intrigue of the drow. Approximately 1,600 drow were considered nobles, forming about 100 noble houses.\n\nAn additional 70,000 inhabitants lived in the city, the majority of them slaves (although officially there were no slaves; only drow battle captives could be openly named slaves). Frequently seen races were [[dwarf|dwarves]], [[hobgoblin]]s, [[orc]]s, [[quaggoth]]s, [[svirfneblin]], and [[thaaluud]]. [[Bugbear]]s were also common.\n\nTypically, there were about 2,000 visitors residing in the city. These included [[aboleth]]s, [[deep dragon]]s, [[grell]], [[illithid]]s, and even [[fiend]]s. However, [[beholder]]s were not welcome in the city due to past wars with the [[Graypeaks Hive]]. Surfacers were relatively rare due to general inaccessibility of the city.",
            "Post-destruction": "There were over 6,000 (presumably drow) who survived the initial destruction of the city, but over the next few months, nearly half of those died of privation or monster or simply left the city. Gangs, many run by non-drow ex-slaves, cropped up in the area."
        },
        "Culture": {
            "Education": "There were a number of wizards' guilds and schools located in the city where aspiring mages could be trained, including the [[Disciples of Phelthong]], the [[Weavespinners Academy]], the [[Runemasters of the Dangling Tower]], and the [[Arcanist Conservatory]]. The schools are more or less independent, although a few are tied to noble houses. Rivalries between the schools not only exist but can also serve as proxies for interhouse warfare.",
            "Food and drink": "Common staples of Ched Nasad were [[rothe]] meat and cheese, as well as the fungus cultivated on the walls of the cavern. The [[Glowing Goblet]] tavern has a specialty drink known as [[glowwine]], which is named for its faerie fire glow."
        },
        "Trade": "Ched Nasad produced a great variety of items. These included body dyes, pottery (from calcified webs), [[everdark]] [[ink]] (from deep dragon scales), fine armor and weapons, giant [[solifugid]]s (used as guardians), molds (brown, chromatic, death, deep, gray, russet, sonic, and yellow), poisons, potions, [[riding lizards]], [[rothe]] wool, meat, cheese, spells, textiles, and water.\n[[Netherese]] artifacts made up a significant part of Ched Nasad's fortune. Regular raids into the [[phaerimm]] lands (known as the [[Buried Realms]]) produced valuable plunder, even though more than half of all raiding bands never returned.\n\nForeign traders in Ched Nasad included [[duergar]], [[trog]]s, and [[kuo-toa]].  Merchants sold mushrooms, jewelry, potions, [[chitine]]s, and slugs, among other items Several trading guilds operated in Ched Nasad, including the [[White Spider Company]], [[Fellowship of the Seventh Scepter]], [[Company of the Flickering Flame]], and the [[Dragon's Hoard]] (destroyed in [[1361 DR]]). The Council did not allow lesser nobles to invest in a single company, instead pressuring them to invest in multiple companies.\n\nBefore its destruction, Ched Nasad provided fully half of Menzoberranzan's goods. Other trading partners included [[Gracklstugh]], [[Ch'Chitl]], and [[Eryndlyn]], [[Gualidurth]], and [[Underspires]].",
        "Defenses": "Before its destruction, Ched Nasad had more than 12,000 drow soldiers and 6,000 slaves that were directed by noble houses, merchant companies, or mercenary bands. An additional 1,200 drow wizards and 15,000 priests lived in the city; all of them except the nobles were required to serve one month per year in the military.\n\nThe ruling [[matron mother]]s could also summon [[guardian spiders]] to protect the city. Guardian spiders were huge black spiders that protected and repaired the city. They had originally been summoned by priestesses and wizards at the founding of the city of Ched Nasad to spin the city's webs, which were then turned to stone. They were Lolth's blessing. After they created the city's levels, they were transformed into crystal statues but could be brought to life by the matrons of Ched Nasad in times of great need. They could repair the city or defend it. Guardian spiders were also able to summon other guardian spiders.",
