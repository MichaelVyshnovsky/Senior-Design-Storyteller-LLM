        "mainbody": "The '''Gem District''' of [[Athkatla]] was a quarter in the center of the city, on the north bank of the [[Alandor River]]. It was home to the city's wealthiest merchant families, whose ostentatious taste for jewels, gold and other status symbols were displayed in proud competition with one another. The district seemed to have no landmarks that stood out as every building glittered with such over-the-top opulence, they clashed in a display of utter tastelessness.",
        "Society": "Only common couriers or servants walked the streets of the gem district. Merchants traveling about the city would be carried by jewel-encrusted palanquins or ride ornately-decorated, gilded coaches led by elaborately adorned steeds and protected by a cadre of highly regimented, and [[Council of Five (Amn)|council]]-regulated, personal guards. These protectors were known to carry long [[polearm]]s equipped with [[wand of paralyzation|wands of paralyzation]] attached at their ends.\n\nGuests were tolerated, though not particularly welcome, and tourists or mere onlookers who traveled within the gem district were firmly turned away. Those determined enough to enjoy the decadent splendor of the city's richest district could occasionally find a way to go undetected, with some clever thinking or a convincing disguise.",
        "Description": "Despite its proximity to the [[River District (Athkatla)|River District]] of Athkatla, there was next to no crime within this section of the city. It was even rumored the sewers beneath the district were patrolled by a group of apparitions and [[wraith]]s, called the [[Ghost Patrol]],\n\nThe streets were kept immaculately clean, as even the droppings of pack animals would be cleaned up in a few moments. During the night the streets were illuminated by ''glowspells'', floating clouds of radiance that drifted throughout the city quarter.",
        "History": "One trend in the mid-14{{th}} century was the use of increasingly large animals as status symbols by the city's merchant families - to the point where [[elephant]]s became a common sighting within the streets of the gem district.",
