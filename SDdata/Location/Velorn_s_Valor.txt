'''Velorn's Valor''' was a small town in [[Turmish]] that accepted refugees from across the country â€“ [[Morningstar Hollows]], after [[Alaoreum River]] turned their home into uninhabitable bog.

==Description==
By the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], Velorn's Valor was a market-town that catered to cattle ranchers.

==History==
Like so many other Turami settlements, Velorn's Valor was named after a hero of antiquity. [[Velorn]] valorously stood against [[orc]]ish warbands that threatened Turmish. Velorn's heroics were remembered fondly, and his battered, reportedly authentic [[shield]] was proudly displayed on a wall of the town's council hall.

Velorn's shield became the talk of the town in the late-14{{th}} century DR when it was discovered that its backside contained a ''[[portable hole]]''. A mysterious treasure map was fished out from the ''hole''. The city council immodestly became absorbed by debates on what to do with the map. The council kept the location of the map a secret, and the shield's ''portable hole'' was kept away from prying eyes.
