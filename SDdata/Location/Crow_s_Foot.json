        "mainbody": "'''Crow's Foot''' was a hamlet at the foot of the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], on the eastern shores of the [[Dragon Reach]].",
        "Location": "The hamlet was situated outside of the protective stone walls of the city, west of its [[Ravens Bluff/Foreign District|Foreign District]].{{Cite interactive atlas|4750 Raven's Bluff}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"presence\">The hamlet is not depicted in the map of Ravens Bluff in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas]]'', but the source is cited here for the sake of identifying the road.",
        "Description": "Most of the buildings in the hamlet were built in an architectural style known on some worlds as \"[[Wikipedia:Tudor architecture|Tudor]]\". Many were built of [[stucco]], some simple stone, and thatched roofs were quite prominent. Narrow cart paths passed for streets in the hamlet and no [[torch]]es were set out to illuminate them during the night. During the evening one could see the light of hearthfires and [[candle]]s from the many windows of residents.\n\nIt was not uncommon to hear [[conch]] shells being blown during the night, either as a religious act towards [[Istishia]] during nights when [[the Veil]] was up or out of a local belief that doing so would ward off monsters.",
        "Law & Order": "The [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] and [[Night Watch]] of Ravens Bluff oversaw the hamlet's law enforcement, though things were usually quite peaceful in Crow's Foot.",
        "History": "On a foggy night around the spring or fall season of the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, a group of newly minted Night Watchmen patrolled the hamlet and had a myriad of encounters. First they saved a middle-aged woman, who was on her to slop the two [[pig]]s she kept in her backyard, from three mangy [[dog]]s. As they tried to leave Crow's Foot to patrol [[Old Town]] they investigated a ''[[fireball]]'' and tremendous pyrotechnic display in the nightsky that were the cause of two [[wizard]]s, [[Modo]] and [[Yvas]], arguing over which of them had cast the [[spell]] that slayed a [[blue dragon]] back in their [[adventurer|adventuring]] days.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, a group of [[fire]] worshipers emerged in Crow's Foot{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|14}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"date1\">''Inferno in the Living City'' makes some references to the events of ''Nightwatch in the Living City'', referring to them as having happened four years prior. As that module has been estimated to be set in 1355 DR, that would place the events of ''Inferno'' in 1359 DR. called the [[Cult of Red Ruin]] and established [[Temple of Red Ruin|a temple]] close to the [[Red Sail Tavern|Red Sail Inn]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|18-19}} Sometime later that year the cult found and trapped within an ''[[iron flask]]'' a [[pyre elemental]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|6-7}} Over the next two weeks the cultists caused several fires in Ravens Bluff,{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|13}}",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Raven's Eye]], formerly known as the Red Sail Inn, was an inn and tavern{{Cite organized play/LC/The Perils of Politics|19}} close to the outer wall.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|18-19}} It was one of two taverns in the hamlet,<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"tavern\">''Nightwatch in the Living City'' states there are at least two or more taverns in Crow's Foot, though the name of this other tavern (or taverns) is never given. and most residents chose to flock to it instead of making the trek down to Old Town.\n* [[Temple of Red Ruin]], a marble temple near the Raven's Eye that was operated by the Cult of Red Ruin.",
        "Inhabitants": "The hamlet was inhabited by many families, as well as merchants that worked in Old Town.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Jack Harker]], an old and semi-retired vampire hunter.<ref>\n* [[Modo]], a [[conjurer]] that ran an [[alchemical]] store in Old Town.\n* [[Thomas]] and [[T.J.]], an orphaned child and his grandfather that lived in a cottage in Crow's Foot in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|17}}\n* [[Yvas]], an [[illusionist]] that ran a small scribe shop in Old Town."
