Many were built of stucco, some simple stone, and thatched roofs were quite prominent. Narrow cart paths passed for streets in the hamlet and no torches were set out to illuminate them during the night. During the evening one could see the light of hearthfires and candles from the many windows of residents.\nIt was not uncommon to hear conch shells being blown during the night, either as a religious act towards Istishia during nights when the Veil was up or out of a local belief that doing so would ward off monsters.\nThe City Watch and Night Watch of Ravens Bluff oversaw the hamlets law enforcement, though things were usually quite peaceful in Crows Foot.\nOn a foggy night around the spring or fall season of the , a group of newly minted Night Watchmen patrolled the hamlet and had a myriad of encounters.
