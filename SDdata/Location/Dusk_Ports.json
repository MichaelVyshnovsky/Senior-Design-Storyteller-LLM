        "mainbody": "he Dusk Ports were a collection of seemingly free trade cities on the western shores of the Dragon Sea. In reality, they were vassal states to the green dragon Orlarrakh.\nThe Dusk Ports were located on the western shore of the Dragon Sea.\n*Dusklan&mdashA city of racial diversity that harbored escaped slaves, if only to use them as sacrifices to Orlarrakh.\n* Lylorn&mdashThe dominant Dusk Port as of 1479 DR. Lylorn boasted the most far-reaching trade network and the most aggressive sailors.\n* Marrauk&mdashA bleak and wind-scoured city in an equally desolate hillside, it featured a busy shipping trade and a fiercely defiant government.\n* Mreyelundar&mdashA city of lawlessness and home of the strange Order of the Dawn. It was the most actively anti-draconic of the five cities.\n* Tarsith&mdashA calm fishing community known for their exports of rock crabs and fine sailing equipment.\nAlthough in appearance each port was an independent and self-ruling state, rival to each other and never cooperating in anything, in reality all ports were under the thumb of Orlarrakh, the Green Duchess, who in turn was a vassal of the ruler of Melabrauth.\nAll cities of the Dusk Ports were rivals of those of the Windrise Ports, not only because those cities were also trade ports, and therefore commercial rivals, but also because the Dusk Ports employed pirates, a practice frowned upon in the Windrise Ports.\n* Dauna Lorastur, the ruler of Marrauk in 1479 DR.\n* Nandrel Gostur, one of the richest persons in the Dusk Ports and a head member of the Shadowkiss in 1479 DR.\n* Narnorn, a legendary thief in Mreyelundar.\n* Rhauron, a notorious individual who lived in Tarsith in the 1480s DR.\n* Rowan Babar, the leader of the Order of the Dawn in 1479 DR.\n* Zasheena Drethyl, a head member of the Shadowkiss in 1479 DR."
