The Pillars of Woe was a cavern and gorge located between Gracklstugh and Menzoberranzan in the Northdark of the Underdark.
The Pillars of Woe was located not far south of Menzoberranzan. It was  north of Rhazzts Dilemma and some  from the Lustrum mine.
The Pillars of Woe was a cavern half a mile across with its ceiling a few hundred feet high. There were shelf-like caverns on each side and many columns supporting the roof. In the center was a gorge that narrowed between two large columns.
In the , the Menzoberranyr Army of the Black Spider and the duergar armies of Gracklstugh (under the command of Horgar Steelshadow and the aid of Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin) fought their first battle at the Pillars of Woe. It turned out to be an ambush the duergar were already there when the drow arrived, as was the tanarukk army of Kaanyr Vhoks Scourged Legion, which turned on the drow. At the beginning of the battle, the contingent of House Agrach Dyrr also turned against their fellows. The drow army suffered high losses—a quarter to a third of their total number—and were only able to retreat back to Menzoberranzan when a small contingent of House Baenre was sent to cover their backs. The duergar and tanarukk armies continued on to besiege Menzoberranzan.
