'''The Purple Marches''' was a [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|duchy]] of western [[Tethyr]] known for the quality of its wines.<ref name=LoI1:T-p72/>

==Geography==
The Purple Marches were located on the coast between the [[Sulduskoon River]] and the [[River Ith]] and included the counties of [[Vintor]], [[Bardshyr]], and [[Elemetar]].<ref name=LoI1:T-map> [[Myratma]] was the largest city the duchy claimed.<ref name=LoI1:T-p72/>

The southwestern part of the duchy, in County Vintor, was composed of rolling hills known as the [[Purple Hills]]. Where these met the [[Sea of Swords]], there were treacherous cliffs called the [[Purple Cliffs]]. These names all came from the multitude of purple flowers growing in the region.<ref name=LoI1:T-p73/>

==Government==
In [[1369 DR]], the Marches were ruled over by Duchess [[Marilyn Haresdown]]. Her estate was in the keep of [[Krennasar]], though she was only there three months out of the year.<ref name=LoI1:T-p73/>

==History==
The region was first named by [[Calimshan|Calishites]] when they expanded their empire north beyond the [[River Ith]] (then the Wurlur) sometime before [[-2400  DR]].<ref name=LoI1:T-p22>
