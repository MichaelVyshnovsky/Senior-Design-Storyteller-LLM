'''Velartree''' was a hamlet in [[Harrowdale]], and marked the start of the [[Halfaxe Trail]] to the north west, and the [[Harrow Ride]] to the south east. As of 1374 DR, it consisted of a market paddock, an inn-and-tavern, a mill, a smith, and a small number of residences, including boarding for seasonal farm hands.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Harrowdale}}
