'''Lastarr''' was an independent trading city found in the [[Shining Lands]]. While it was formerly a part of the nation of [[Estagund]], it remained in the territory of the [[Durpar]]i kingdom from the 11{{th}} to the midâ€“14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Description==
It was a truly inclusive city that allowed beings of any background within its walls to conduct trade. Often-maligned creatures such as [[vampire]]s or even [[beholder]]s, even those from [[Veldorn]], could freely enter Lastarr to carry on with their business.

The fact that Lastarr's doors were open to anyone extended only so far that these individuals did not interfere with the business of others.

==Geography==
Lastarr was situated along the lengthy road that passed westward through Durpar, right on the border of Veldorn.

==Trade==
It was considered poor form to inquire into the origins of goods purchased in Lastarr, a fact that often allowed merchants to sell imported items for considerable markup.

==Defenses==
The city was well-defended by 20-man patrols most of which included a powerful [[spellcaster]] and [[cleric]] of [[Lucha]],

==History==
When the great [[Jeradeem Seltarir]] acquired the nation of Estagund for the Durpari throne in the {{YearlinkName|1026}}, Lastarr refused to align itself with the ever-expanding kingdom.
