'''Ostraland''', very briefly known as the '''Kingdom of D'aerthe''', was the region in the northeastern corner of [[Vaasa]]. It included the [[half-orc]] city of [[Palischuk]]. 

==Description==
Much like the rest of Vaasa, Ostraland was a stretch of tundra. The land was largely characterized by flat, nearly featureless plains of mud, rock, and grassland stretching out from the foothills of the [[Galena Mountains]], but it was rumored to be home to a large number of [[dragon]]s. During the summer melt, the land became the site of muddy bogs big enough to conceal an adult [[black dragon]].

==Geography==
Ostraland included Palischuk as well as the lands further north and west of that city along the Galena Mountains.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} 

Prior to the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the region was largely cut off from the rest of Vaasa by the [[Great Glacier]], By the late 15{{th}} century DR, this corner of Vaasa extended up to the [[Lugsaas Chain]] mountains as the Glacier continued to melt. 

==History==
Prior to the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the region was populated by tribes of [[orcs]] in the mountains as well as [[humans]] and [[dwarves]] in the town of [[Palischuk]], plus a growing population of [[half-orcs]] emerging from the confluence of these groups. Before them, it was the home and hunting grounds of the mighty [[Urshula|Urshula the Black]].

With the rise of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, Palischuk was destroyed and the region fell under Zhengyi's control. After Zhengyi was defeated by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Ostraland was liberated and the local half-orcs began rebuilding Palischuk, soon becoming the dominant group in the region.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, after a decade of Gareth Dragonsbane's efforts to pacify Vaasa, a half-orc [[wizard]] named [[Arrayan Faylin]] inadvertently activated a [[Book of Creation]] left by Zhengyi and caused a replica of [[Castle Perilous]] to begin growing atop an orc burial ground in the region. A group was dispatched from the [[Vaasan Gate]] to investigate and deal with the construct, joined by the sellswords [[Artemis Entreri]] and [[Jarlaxle]]. The two were hailed as heroes when they slew the [[dracolich]] Urshala at the heart of the castle, but were subsequently vilified when they claimed the castle for themselves shortly afterward. They dubbed the fortress "Castle D'aerthe" and claimed the region as the "Kingdom of D'aerthe" for "King Artemis the First," provoking Gareth Dragonsbane and his army to race the oncoming winter in order to lay siege to them. The battle was brief, with no casualties among the soldiers of [[Damara]]. Jarlaxle and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] had abandoned the castle immediately once the siege began, and later claimed that whole fiasco had been a ploy to accelerate Gareth's annexation of Vaasa into his kingdom by allowing him to play the hero yet again for the people of Palischuk.

A century later, the region fell to the [[Warlock Knights]] during their conquest of Vaasa in the 1460s DR. Under their rule, the trade route through [[Bloodstone Pass]] was closed, making northern routes through Ostraland much more important and leading Palischuk to become the wealthiest city in Vaasa by the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}}{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}
