        "mainbody": "Thousand Faces was a stone giant settlement found in the Greypeak Mountains, within the Savage Frontier of the North.\nThe entrance to the settlement lay within a gorge between two neighboring cliffsides, each guarded by life-size sculptures of stalwart stone giant sentries. The walls within the passage were decorated with relief sculptures depicting scenes of stone giant life giant families at play, scenes of their craftspeople toiling away, all surrounded by the beasts and critters of the natural world. \nThe cliff walls were dotted doorways and windows, a number of which were obscured by trees growing within the canyon.\nThousand Faces was overrun by a collection of phaerimm-controlled beholders in the , and nearly all of its residents were slain or forced to flee.\n* Aris, the lone survivor of Thousand Faces that achieved much acclaim as an artist throughout the Heartlands."
