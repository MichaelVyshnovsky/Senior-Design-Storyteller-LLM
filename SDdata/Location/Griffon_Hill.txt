'''Griffon Hill''' was a thorp in the East Reaches of northern [[Cormyr]], on edge of the [[Stonelands]].

==Description==
Griffon Hill was an unremarkable collection of fortified cottages and a repeatedly-burnt-down inn that sat atop a rocky hill. It was populated by hardy shepherds and several priests of [[Chauntea]], who had become suspicious of visitors after being tricked by bandits repeatedly.

==Geography==
The hill upon which the settlement was found sat about halfway along the [[Stonebolt Trail]], from [[Gnoll Pass]] to [[Shadow Gap]]. Roughly {{SI|25|mi|k|long=yes}} to the west was a noted [[goblin]] burial ground. The ruins of [[Darkenshield]] lay far to the south along the Trail, while [[Halfhap]] and [[Tilverton]] sat along the parallel [[Moonsea Ride]] to the south and east, respectively.

Somewhere below the hilltop was a good-sized aquifer that the residents used to draw drinking water.

==Trade==
Griffon Hill raised sheep and traded the meat and wool of its flocks for whatever they could buy from the merchants who visited them. Those in need of healing also traveled to the site to visit the three priests of [[Chauntea]] who lived there, who supplemented the thorp's income by selling [[holy water]] and other services. More expensive goods were imported from [[Arabel]] via trusted messengers hired by the priests.

==Defenses==
Apart from lying at the top of a hill, the cottages of Griffon Hill were somewhat fortified against attack. During the mid–14{{th}} century DR, one of the priests living there gained the ability to summon [[earth elemental]]s and [[Control weather|control the weather]].

==History==
The hill was named after the [[griffon]]s that had lived there, though they were long gone by the 14{{th}} century. After it was settled, Griffon Hill became the target for frequent [[orc]] attacks, but the folk living there survived and rebuilt time after time.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that when under dire threat, the residents of Griffon Hill retreated to a cavern within the hill itself for safety. Legend also had it that this cavern was deep enough to connect to the [[Underdark]], and that they could flee there to escape pursuit.

==Notable Locations==
One of the cottages built atop the hill was set aside for visiting travelers to sleep in — it was marked by ''[[faerie fire]]'', had cots set up inside, and was stocked with firewood and water. However, it was also kept in a far less tidy state, with the door left open unless occupied.
