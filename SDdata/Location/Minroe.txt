Minroe was a town in Cormyr located west of the Kings Forest.
It was a gem-mining town for many years but by 1367 DR the mines were no longer profitable and the population dwindled to only a few families. It became known for its mushrooms, which grew in some of the old mines, but these were occupied by medusae around 1357 DR.
By 1479 DR, the population had expanded to 500. Minroe was reputed to have high-quality jewelers and gem-cutters who provided their products at affordable rates.
