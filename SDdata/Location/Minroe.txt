'''Minroe''' was a town in [[Cormyr]] located west of the [[King's Forest]].<ref name=VGtC-p125>

==History==
It was a [[gem]]-mining town for many years but by [[1367 DR]] the mines were no longer profitable and the population dwindled to only a few families. It became known for its mushrooms, which grew in some of the old mines, but these were occupied by [[medusa]]e around [[1357 DR]].<ref name=VGtC-p125/>

By [[1479 DR]], the population had expanded to 500. Minroe was reputed to have high-quality jewelers and gem-cutters who provided their products at affordable rates.<ref name=Dr365>{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|21}}
