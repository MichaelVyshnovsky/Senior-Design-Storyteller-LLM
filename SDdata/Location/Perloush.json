The Mountains of the Alaoreum rose upward on the northern side of the valley.\nAt the mouth of the Perloush in the east, the land opened into some of the few plains to be found in Turmish\nWild Turmish ponies once roamed the plains in the mouth of the Perloush, but by the midâ€“14 century DR they were found only in captive herds bred by farmers."
