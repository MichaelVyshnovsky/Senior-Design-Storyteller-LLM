        "mainbody": "he Chultengar referred to a branch of the main jungle of Chult that encroached on Thindol and Samarach.\nThe Chultengar lay between the Luo Peaks in the north and the Sanrach Mountains to the south. The rain forest swept east to the doorstep of Narubel.\nTribes of pterafolk, each ruled by a single spirit naga, were the dominant lifeform within the Chultengar. Other species present included wild dwarves, wyverns, and batiri.\nThe spirit nagas met with three ha-nagas on a yearly basis somewhere within the dense Chultengar. They called themselves the Conclave of Spirits."
