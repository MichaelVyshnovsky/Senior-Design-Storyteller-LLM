'''Gracklstugh''' ({{Pronounce|GRAK|ul|stoog|refs=}}), the '''City of Blades''', was a [[duergar]] city on the shores of the [[Darklake]] in the [[Northdark]].

==Geography==
The city was located five miles beneath the [[Evermoors]],

Gracklstugh was located about 100 miles away from [[Menzoberranzan]] across the Darklake and beyond.

Access to Gracklstugh could be achieved by the following routes: caves in the [[Sword Mountains]]; tunnels from [[Beldabar's Rest]] in [[Yartar]]; tunnels from [[Luskan]] and [[Mithral Hall]]; and via a major trade route from [[Skullport]] through the [[Labyrinth]].

==Structure==
Gracklstugh was a cavern city that sloped down on the eastern side to join the Darklake as a subterranean port. The city was lit by the firelight of smelters and foundries mingling among stalagmites. The air smelled acrid and was filled with industrial sounds: fire, steam, and [[iron]] ringing. The persistent smog that filled the cavern could cause a persistent and sometimes fatal cough, known as [[grackle-lung]].

[[Laduguer's Furrow]], also known as "the Cleft," split the city in half north-south. Bridges connected the higher city to the lakeside districts. The west side was off-limits to foreigners.

==History==
Gracklstugh was founded in {{Yearlink|-3717}} by duergar escaping the fall of [[Deep Shanatar]] and the subsequent enslavement of many gray dwarves in [[Oryndoll]]. 

In {{Yearlink|-3392}}, King [[Horgar Steelshadow II]] began uniting the duergar clans in and around Gracklstugh, creating the [[Deepkingdom]]. Over the past few centuries, however, the Deepkingdom narrowing its reach to the city itself and its close environs.

The Deepkingdom's might began falling during the [[Deepbear Battles]] against the [[quaggoth]]s from {{Yearlink|-1803}} to ''ca.'' {{Yearlink|-1350}}.

Around the 14{{th}} century DR, King [[Tarngardt Steelshadow]] (grandfather of [[Horgar Steelshadow IV]]; king since [[972 DR]] 

In [[1372 DR]], Horgar used the [[Silence of Lolth]] and the weakness of the followers of [[Lolth]] as an excuse to attack the drow city of Menzoberranzan and thus cement his power over his lairds. He allied with [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] to further his goals. Under his prompting, Horgar led his army to success against the drow at the [[Pillars of Woe]] and gained additional allies: the [[Scourged Legion]] of [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and the traitorous drow [[House Agrach Dyrr]], also aligned with the Jaezred Chaulssin. Referred to as the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]], the allies then marched against the drow city and besieged it for several months.

On [[Ches]] 28, [[1373 DR]], the Silence of Lolth ended and Lolth's priestesses regained their powers. Kaanyr Vhok subsequently recalled his forces to [[Hellgate Keep]]; the remaining duergar were easily defeated and turned back. The siege officially ended on Ches 30.

As the duergar army retreated, Nimor swept in and killed Horgar Steelshadow IV.

Following Horgar IV's death, Horgar Steelshadow V ascended to the throne.

==Inhabitants==
The city was mainly home to duergar, but there was a sizable minority of derro who lived there, as well as a number of durzagon, orogs, and stone giants. A third of the total population consisted of slaves, namely goblins, shield dwarves, orcs, svirfneblin, and humans.

The city hosted many visiting merchants, especially drow, duergar, and [[kuo-toa]]. Foreigners were required to obtain writs of passage for passage through the city (beyond the docks district) and its territories. On the black market, [[Clan Muzgardt]] provided writs of passage for 200 gold per person.

==Military==
The army of Gracklstugh was one of the strongest in the [[Underdark]] although the duergar lacked [[arcane magic|arcane]] or [[divine magic|divine]] casters. Other products of the city were metal armor, [[arrow]]heads, [[fish]], locks, mining equipment, smithing equipment, and other tools.

*[[Stone Guard|Stone Guards]] were the king's royal guards and secret police. They numbered nearly 500 experienced duergar soldiers. They were equipped with black plate mail, battleaxes, and shields and carried serrated short swords, known as King's Blades, with which their position could be recognized by; high rank was indicated by strips of gold filigree on their helms. The city's clan lairds could muster additional forces when needed.

==Trade==
Gracklstugh was especially well known for its quality weapons. Other products of the city were metal armor, arrowheads, fish, locks, mining equipment, smithing equipment, and other tools.

The city had good trading relationships with Menzoberranzan (except in times of war), [[Mantol-Derith]], Skullport, [[Sshamath]], and [[Ooltul]]. 

Clan Muzgardt was a clan of merchants that made and traded ales and liquors.

==Culture==
===Outlook===
The duergar were generally serious and somber and not friendly towards non-duergar, although there were many non-duergar in the city.

To outsiders they could be ruthless and contemptuous, but were by nature pragmatic in their dealings with others. Duergar were far more interested in using others to their advantage, such as enslaving them, rather than killing them.

Duergar believed strongly in the ethic of hard work and tended to prefer earning success and status through labor rather then scheming against a rival.

It was claimed that the duergars' second love after gold was ale.

Coins from Gracklstugh were minted the face of the current duergar monarch on one side, and the [[mind flayer]] skull symbol of [[Deep Duerra]] on the other, with the dwarvish phrase "As low as we can go" on the rim of the coin.

===Food===
Food in Gracklstugh included [[rothe]] roasts, red wine, smoked rothe cheese, and black sporeflour bread.

==Notable locations==
[[File:Gracklstugh-5e.jpg|thumb|300px|''A map of Gracklstugh.'']]
===Districts===
; Laduguer's Furrow : A rift 200 feet deep and 500 feet wide which split the city in half north-south. The walls of the rift were lined with carved dwellings and the eastern section housed the derro quarter. Twelve stone bridges across it connected the [[Northfurrow District]] to the [[Southfurrow District]].
; Northfurrow District : The area north of Laduguer's Furrow encompasses Darklake District along with the residences of those whose clan specializes in crafts and other commercial goods. This district is also the only part of the city where outsiders are allowed to reside. The Darklake Docks are located at the northernmost section of the district.
; Southfurrow District :South of Laduguer's Furrow resided the more prestigious clans of Gracklstugh. The area was also home to the lair of the red dragon Themberchaud, Cairngorm Cavern, and the Hold of the Deepking. Access to the Southfurrow district by unauthorized non-natives was strictly prohibited.
; [[Cairngorm Cavern|Cairngorm Cavern ]]: A remote district somewhat removed from the main cavern. It housed the stone giants of Clan Cairngorm.
; [[Darklake District|Darklake District ]]: The docks, on the shore of the Darklake in the north, were the poorest and most dangerous district of the city due to lack of use.
; Business district : Filled with artisans and merchants in cramped field storehouses.

===Landmarks===
; [[Blade Bazaar]] : The town square and marketplace located in the Darklake District. It was surrounded by low buildings and weaponsmiths.  In 1372 DR, a duergar captain in service of Laird [[Thrazgud]] sold armor and weapons from minor drow houses here.
; The [[Deepking's Hall]] : Gracklstugh's palace had a large gate with no decorations. The guards, called the Stone Guards, generally remained invisible while on watch. The palace had a waiting suite with simple and functional furnishings, as well as a small slitlike window out over the city. The palace had a large portcullis and a large stairway that led to the vast throne room.
; [[Themberchaud]]'s Lair : The lair of the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh, located in a large side cavern in the south part of the city.

===Establishments===
; [[The Cold Foundry]] :A fortress like inn located a few blocks from the wharves. The sign was in [[Undercommon]] and [[Dwarvish]]. The inn was composed of a wall around free-standing blockhouses holding the rooms. A pen outside the front gate housed pack lizards. It included a freestanding building that could be rented out that had eight rooms on two floors which were acceptable for [[drow]]-sized humanoids.
; The [[Shattered Spire]] : A ramshackle tavern that was located atop a broken stalagmite that rose from the Darklake and was connected to the mainland by a [[rope]] bridge.
; The [[Gohlbrorn's Lair]] : A low-quality but safe inn due to its location beneath the Blade Bazaar in the docks district.
