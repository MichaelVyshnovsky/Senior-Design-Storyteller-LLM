        "mainbody": "'''Ilighôn''' was one of two islands, along with [[Wavecrest]],\n\nThe island was accessible via a gap in the reef, known as the [[Farshore Straits]]. This passageway was guarded by the [[Seven Sentinels of Silvanus]], a group of [[Water elemental|water]] and [[air elemental]]s who acted upon the direction of the enclave.",
        "Description": {
            "Magic nullification": "A unique property of the island was that it naturally negated all [[arcane]] [[magic]]. If a [[wizard]] were to cast any magic on the island it would immediately fizzle into nothingness; this included spells that may have been cast prior to arrival such as ''[[stoneskin]]'' or ''[[contingency]]''. Any [[scroll]]s, [[rod]]s, [[staves]] or other items with magical charges would cease to function and their use would ultimately be a waste of magical energy.\n\n[[Divine magic]] was unaffected in this way, rather the island possessed a [[faith-magic zone]], which improved the effects of certain magic of the gods. Although the nature of this boon wasn't fully known to the mortals of [[Toril]], it was believed to have been a gift from the goddess [[Mystra]] to [[Silvanus]]."

            "[[Calling River|Calling]], [[Elder River|Elder]] and [[Springbrook River]]s": ":These three rivers were formed from the pools of water surrounding the House of Silvanus. They roared down the [[Elder Spires]], forming magnificent waterfalls.",
            "Eldath's Ring": ":",
            "Grandlore Forest": ": Covering over half its land, the Grandlore was easily the largest forest on Ilighôn.",
            "Great Forest": ": The smallest forest on the island, located on its southern reaches.",
            "Lake Bluesprings": ":This getaway for the island's residents was surrounded by otherwise wild and overgrown lands.",
            "Mielikki's Garden": ":A grove of primarily [[oak]] trees on the north-eastern region of the island."
        },
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Archentree": ":A settlement of sorts that served as a gathering place for [[treant]]s, some of whom were extremely old.",
            "Druidhome": ": While it wasn't a settlement so much as a collection of small groves, Druidhome served as a haven for elder [[ranger]]s, [[priest]]s and druids who wished to live their last years in service to the nature deities.",
            "House of Silvanus": ":A holy site for the worshipers of the Forest Father located in the heart of the island of Ilighôn. It could be reached by the [[Hierophant trail]], a walkway that led to the temple from the city of [[Sapra]].",
            "Sapra": ":This enclave city was a haven to those across [[Faerûn]] who sought to live away from what saw as the tremendous negative effects of wizards and their brand of magic."
        },
        "History": "The island was originally settled by a group of [[druid]]s in [[374 DR]]. Within a few years they had constructed the temple known as the [[House of Silvanus]].\n\nWith the retreat of the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars after the [[Spellplague]], the island became part of mainland [[Turmish]]."
