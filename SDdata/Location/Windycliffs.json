        "Trade": "Most inhabitants of Windycliffs were merchants and traders. Travelers that ventured from the town of [[Port Llast]] often used Windycliffs as a safe stop long the [[High Road]] on their way down south. The town had several inns, general, arms, and weapons stores, as well as a few jewelers.",
        "Defenses": "Due to the proximity to Neverwinter, Windycliffs was regularly patrolled by Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]]'s private guard, granting travelers and goodly adventurers their protection.",
        "History": "In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], a usually safe town became menaced by fierce monsters. The village's Lord-Mayor suspected that [[Luskan]]'s dreaded tyrant pirate captains were responsible for the unrest. The town of Windycliffs formally requested aid in handling the monsters from Neverwinter's Lord Nasher."
