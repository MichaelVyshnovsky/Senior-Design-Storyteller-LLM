        "mainbody": "Windycliffs was a small merchant town located north of the city of Neverwinter along the High Road.\nWindycliffs was a humble and safe caravan stop town, named after powerful winds that battered the town at the base of a small cliff.\nMost inhabitants of Windycliffs were merchants and traders. Travelers that ventured from the town of Port Llast often used Windycliffs as a safe stop long the High Road on their way down south. The town had several inns, general, arms, and weapons stores, as well as a few jewelers.\nDue to the proximity to Neverwinter, Windycliffs was regularly patrolled by Lord Nasher Alagondars private guard, granting travelers and goodly adventurers their protection.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, a usually safe town became menaced by fierce monsters. The villages Lord-Mayor suspected that Luskans dreaded tyrant pirate captains were responsible for the unrest. The town of Windycliffs formally requested aid in handling the monsters from Neverwinters Lord Nasher."
