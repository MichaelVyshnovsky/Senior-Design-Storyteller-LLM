        "History": "Aluwand was constructed around {{Yearlink|713}} by refugees of [[Cormanthyr]], who had transformed themselves into sea elves through use of the artifact known as the ''[[Sashelan Glass]]''. It later became incorporated into Selu'Maraar, but would not become its capital until much later.\n\nFollowing the end of the disastrous [[Eleventh Serôs War]] the Thuvys clan was ousted from power in Selu'Maraar and the capital was moved to Aluwand. The title of Coronal was then adopted and [[Aolis Ildacer II]] was crowned as the kingdom's first coronal.\n\nAfter the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], the city was filled with a sense of unease as the Coronal [[Semphyr Ildacer]]'s must valuable agents, the [[elven high mage]]s of Serôs, left him to join the [[Nantarn Council]]. Paranoid at what might happen in the future, Aluwandans began preparing themselves for a potential future conflict."
