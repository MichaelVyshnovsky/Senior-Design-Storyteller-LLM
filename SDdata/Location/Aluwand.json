This would put it in the Gloom level of the Inner Seas ocean depths, which is stated on page 39 of Sea of Fallen Stars to be in the  range.\nThis city was the seat of power for the ruler of SeluMaraar, who held the classical Faer没nian elf title of Coronal.\nAluwand was constructed around  by refugees of Cormanthyr, who had transformed themselves into sea elves through use of the artifact known as the Sashelan Glass. It later became incorporated into SeluMaraar, but would not become its capital until much later.\nFollowing the end of the disastrous Eleventh Ser么s War the Thuvys clan was ousted from power in SeluMaraar and the capital was moved to Aluwand. The title of Coronal was then adopted and Aolis Ildacer II was crowned as the kingdoms first coronal.\nAfter the Twelfth Ser么s War, the city was filled with a sense of unease as the Coronal Semphyr Ildacers must valuable agents, the elven high mages of Ser么s, left him to join the Nantarn Council. Paranoid at what might happen in the future, Aluwandans began preparing themselves for a potential future conflict."
