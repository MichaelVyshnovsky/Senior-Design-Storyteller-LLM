Evernight was the dismal echo of Neverwinter located in the Shadowfell. It was a city of the undead and those that trafficked with them&mdashunhinged necromancers, slave traders, and followers of dark deities.

The whole city was in disrepair, as if the wood and stone that held the buildings together had the life leeched out of them, becoming rotten and crumbling. The lanes and alleys were paved with grave-dirt trodden and scuffed into a fine dust, while the few cobblestone streets were cratered with potholes. The atmosphere was damp and humid, with a chill wind under a perpetually ashen sky illuminated by feeble moonlight. Much of the city was relatively silent save for sporadic screams of pain and terror.
Certain places throughout the city were bursting with necromantic power that made lights dimmer, the air colder and more still, attracted the undead, and drained mortals of their stamina. The ambient energies around the city also had the effect of blunting the undead citizens appetites for flesh and blood, allowing them to carry on with daily unlife.
Evernight was connected with Neverwinter on the Material Plane via Crevices of Dusk&mdashsporadic portals and "dimensional gaps"&mdashthat allowed for easy contact between the two planes. This provided ample opportunity for the undead to snatch living victims from Neverwinter, and in turn, led to many of Neverwinters urban legends of hauntings and disappearances.
The gloomy streets of Evernight.
Evernight had a very similar layout to Neverwinter, with locations that were sometimes forlorn mockeries of their equivalents in that city. It was located on the coast at the mouth of a once fast-flowing and treacherous river that had been replaced by a lava flow following the events of the Ruining. The western end of the city was often shrouded in mist from the lava where it met the sea while the rest of the city was choked in an ash "fog" that came off the river.
The city was controlled by a ruling caste of intelligent ghouls, They also dictated foreign policy, and insisted that Evernight remain a neutral zone among squabbling factions.
The closest thing to a city hall or courthouse in Evernight was the House of Screams.

Evernight lay at the western end of the Shadowfell Road and was located at a crossroads in the Shadowfell, making the city a center of commerce in that plane. Evernight imported live meat those who were lucky became slaves while those who were unlucky became meals. The city had several markets, but the center of commerce was the Corpse Market, a place that almost seemed like any normal busy marketplace except that it sold body parts, blood, slaves, zombie servants, and all manner of unnatural goods. A district of workshops and storehouses was located nearby the Market, and was jealously guarded.
Transactions in Evernight generally involved the exchange of gold pieces, but occasionally favors or flesh might be exchanged instead.
A hungry population of flesh-eaters and blood drinkers was enough of a threat to put off most living adversaries. For enemy undead or necromancers however, the priests of the Temple of Filth had a secret doomsday weapon hidden away in case their own people were not enough to defend the city. This weapon was said to be a magical artifact that had the ability to project radiant energy equivalent to the light of Torils midday sun. Only strong undead creatures were capable of handling it without being instantly destroyed, but even they suffered crippling pain. Once wielded against enemy undead however, hundreds were sure to be destroyed all at once, even under the pall of the Shadowfell. The artifact itself was protected by a shrine in the Temple of Filth, hidden by ritual magic, behind trapped and cursed doors.
Prior to the Time of Troubles, Bhaal and Myrkul had once been worshiped in Evernight. However, by the late 15 century DR, only the very oldest of the citys undead still recalled a time when this was the case. None could recall a time before the appearance of Castle Nowhere, and many assumed that it had simply always existed.
The shadovar had an ambassador to Evernight even before their Return to Faer√ªn in . Evernight also maintained a diplomatic relationship with Thay after it became a nation of necromancers and began to take interest in the Shadowfell Road during the 15 century DR. In exchange for humanoid slaves and corpses, the Thayans purchased the right to set up an outpost in the city.
In , when Mount Hotenow erupted on the Material Plane, so did its Shadowfell mirror. On the Shadowfell though, rather than a pyroclastic flow like the one Neverwinter suffered, Evernight got a slow and perpetual stream of lava that was contained and channeled by the riverbed, evaporating the river water but otherwise not damaging the city save for a few piers.
By , the tension between the Netherse and Thayans was a source of concern for the ghouls of Evernight, and so they forbade these factions from open conflict within the city walls.

The majority of Evernights population was undead, and almost any kind of corporeal undead creature could be found there whether intelligent (such as the ghouls, ghasts, pale reavers, vampires, and wights) or non-intelligent (such as zombies). It was also home to a few creatures of pure shadow as well as the occasional cadaver collector.
The ambient energies around Evernight had the effect of curbing the appetites of the citys undead, thus allowing them not to be ruled by their hunger (although it did not stop them from preying on each other and on visitors to the city). This meant that they had few basic needs, although many of them maintained a macabre facsimile of the patterns of behavior which they had followed in life. Although they did not need coin, some still worked as crafters, merchants, or soldiers. Likewise, they could not enjoy luxuries, yet some still lived in opulent homes and strove to hold onto their possessions. If not by habit, the sentient undead predominantly were motivated either by ambition&mdashleading them to work or to seek the favor of more powerful citizens&mdashor by boredom, leading to a demand for entertainment (such as mock combat that would usually turn bloody, games of hide-and-seek with living prey, puppet shows with humanoid bodies as props, or sports with limbs for equipment) or to spending their time cavorting and playing games. Meanwhile, the mindless undead merely roamed the streets until given an order to do something else. Whatever the undead did, it was predominantly done in silence as even those who could speak rarely felt the need to do so.
The undead worshiped Orcus and Doresain. They paid homage to these entities by engaging in profane rights at the Temple of Filth, singing triumphant songs, and sacrificing living creatures to the Demon Pit.
Important inhabitants as of the late 15 century DR included
* Arkwright, keeper of the gates of the Graveyard.
