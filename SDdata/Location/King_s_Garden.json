        "mainbody": "he Kings Garden was used as the personal retreat of the necromancer Sumulael within the Jade Palace of the Necromancers in Ysawis in 1367 DR.\nThick vegetation from the surrounding jungle was allowed to grow wild within the Kings Garden. A single narrow path wound through the garden, leading to a stagnant pool of water near its center. The nightmarish Bone Pavilion could be found at the gardens southern end.\nSumulael enjoyed his privacy, so anything wishing to explore the garden would need to sneak past the ever-vigilant jungle giant zombies posted along its perimeter. In addition to the jungle giants, groups of shadows roamed the forested areas and lacedons hid within the depths of the pool, though they were known to emerge from the water from time to time.\nSumulael also let his gruesome undead experiments roam wild within the Kings Garden. Magical wards kept these bizarre pets confined to the borders of the garden."
