        "Description": "Thick vegetation from the surrounding jungle was allowed to grow wild within the King's Garden. A single narrow path wound through the garden, leading to a stagnant pool of water near its center. The nightmarish [[Bone Pavilion]] could be found at the garden's southern end.",
        "Defenses": "Sumulael enjoyed his privacy, so anything wishing to explore the garden would need to sneak past the ever-vigilant [[jungle giant]] [[zombie]]s posted along its perimeter. In addition to the jungle giants, groups of [[shadow]]s roamed the forested areas and [[lacedon]]s hid within the depths of the pool, though they were known to emerge from the water from time to time.\n\nSumulael also let his gruesome [[undead]] experiments roam wild within the King's Garden. Magical wards kept these bizarre pets confined to the borders of the garden."
