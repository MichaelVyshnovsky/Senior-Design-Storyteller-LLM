'''Joya''' was a city in [[Tabot]]. It was considered a twin city of its neighbor, [[Motra]].

==Geography==
It stood in southeastern Tabot, at the very edge of the border with [[Shou Lung]]'s [[Arakin]] province. Joya lay just south of the river there, while Motra lay opposite in the north.{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}

==Population==
In the eyes of [[Pang]], a monk of [[Pokarr Gompa]], the twin cities of Motra and Joya were frontier towns and their people only "confused laymen". He believed the streets were plagued with thieves, bandits, murderers, and even "[[ninja|night assassins]]", and that the people gave free passage to outlaws from Shou Lung and [[T'u Lung]]. It was rumored the people worshiped "the [[frog]] and the [[snake]]".
