'''Faerûn''' ({{Pronounce|fay|ROON|refs=|audio=Faerûn.ogg}} {{Pronounce|FAY|er|OON|primary stress=3|refs=|alt=yes}}) was a major continent on the planet of [[Toril]].<ref group="note">As the key setting of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', the majority of official ''Forgotten Realms'' material covers this continent, and it has had more attention than any other area of the planet.
{{quote|''Someone should have dared, long ago, and done so as often as it took to break you of this serenely wrong view of the ways of the world. Hear this, [[Narantha Crownsilver|Narantha]], and hear it well: Faerûn is not going to change to your will. Either you must change to dwell in it, or it will break you.''|[[Florin Falconhand]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]}}

==Etymology==
The word "Faerûn" was a modified version of "Faerie", the name of the homeland of ancient [[elves]]. The term was coined by [[Durothil (prince)|Durothil]], prince of [[Tintageer]], [[Faerie]].

==Geography==
{{main|Portal:Geography}}
The continent included terrain that was as varied as any other. Besides the exterior coastline to the west and south, the most dominant feature on the continent was the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. This was an irregular inland sea that kept the interior lands fertile, connected the west and east regions of Faerûn and served as a major trade route for many of the bordering nations.

Next in significance was the [[Shaar]], a broad region of grasslands in the south that, together with the Lake of Steam, separated the area around the inland sea from the coastal nations at the southern edge of the continent. To the east, Faerûn was bordered by a vast region of steppes from [[Kara-Tur]], and in the north were massive glaciers ([[Pelvuria]] and [[Reghed]]) and tundra.

The continent included the following geographic regions.<ref group="note">The following division of Faerûn by compass directions was developed for organizational purposes on the Forgotten Realms Wiki, and is not closely reflected by descriptions in source text. In particular, terms like "the North" and "the South" in the sources can be much more wide-ranging in scope, and as ambiguous, than what is defined here.

===Northwest===
