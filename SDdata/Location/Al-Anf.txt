Al-Anf, also called The Nose, was a small easterly island found in the Genies Turban archipelago in the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Al-Anf and Al-Oyun were collectively referred to as the "Beauty Marks" by local corsairs. Ever distrustful of strangers, the corsairs would use the term as a form of password to test outsiders.
The island was the farthest southeast point of the Genies Turban. It was a small forested island measuring roughly  in diameter.
