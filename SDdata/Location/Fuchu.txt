'''Fuchu''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Situated on a portion of the [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']] originally under the [[shikken]] of Kozakura, Fuchu enjoyed the unique status of being tax-exempt.

==Trade==
Despite being just a modest fishing community, the village prospered, its inhabitants enjoying a level of economic well-being uncommon for such small settlements.

==History==
The tax-exempt status of Fuchu was a recognition of the village's courageous actions during the [[Hojo War]]. At that time, the shoen was controlled by the [[Hojo clan|Hojo family]]. In a bold move, the [[jito]] of the shoen rallied the villagers to support the shikken, opposing the Hojo family's rule. This rebellion, although valiant, was ultimately futile, leading to the village's destruction and the near-total massacre of its inhabitants. However, following the conclusion of the war, the shikken acknowledged the villagers' loyalty and sacrifice by granting tax exemption to the survivors and their future generations.
