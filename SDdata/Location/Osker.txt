Osker was a fishing settlement in eastern Aglarond on the southern shores of the Sea of Dlurg.
As of the mid-14 century DR, Osker was a sleepy town of 700 inhabitants. It was a charming village of steep wooden roofs and aging homes built around a dark-wood clocktower.
Osker was built on the Sea of Dlurg and relied on the seas bountiful fish. The towns closest neighbors to the west was Furthinghome, and to the east â€“ Dlusk.
Oskers human population wore bright-colored woven tunics and trousers, typical for eastern Aglarond. These clothes were commonly embroidered with floral peppers and designed in black thread. Most common jewelry included silver and bronze rings, circlets, earrings, and bracelets.
Oskers central clocktower was a creation of the eccentric dwarf named Snorri Rockhammer sometime in the early 14 century DR. The clock itself was a wondrous device of clockwork that rang every 15 minutes and daily, at midday, unleaded a parade of mechanical dragons, beats, manticores, chimeras, giants, unicorns, and pegasi.
