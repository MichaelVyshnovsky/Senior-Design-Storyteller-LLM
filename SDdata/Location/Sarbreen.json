        "mainbody": "Sarbreen, called the City of the Hammer, was a ruined dwarven city in the Vast. For a brief time, it was a great thriving city that shone as the richest of all dwarven holds in Faerûn. Led by master crafters known as Master Masons—armorers, weaponsmiths, jewelers, miners, woodcarvers, glassblowers and others—Sarbreen flourished.\nThe dwarves of the newly established realm of Roldilar began construction of a secure trading center, Sarbreen, at the mouth of the Fire River, around the Year of the Normiir, 611 DR. It was finished in Year of the Ensorceled Kings, 616 DR, and thrived as \"the Gate to the Vast\". Through the new port of Sarbreen, the Roldilarren dwarves engaged in heavy trade with other nations to develop their kingdom. They sold gems, trade-metals, and only a little of their fine armor, weapons, and artworks, in exchange for cloth, livestock and exotic foods. They imported herds of goats, sheep, and shaggy-haired cattle to fill the cleared lands.\nAt some point in its history, Sarbreen was beset by a wave of disenchanters.\nRoldilar, the Realm of Glimmering Swords, fell to the resurgent orcs in the . The dwarves abandoned Sarbreen to the orcs, who quickly pillaged and razed it.\nIts treasures were either carried away or still remained in the ruins of the city, waiting for adventurers to find them. Later, a human city was built on top of the ruins, going by the name of Ravens Bluff. This new citys sewers were built into the ruins of Sarbreen, and the plucky were likely to find either mighty treasures or deadly perils if they went exploring them.\n* Armory Workshops of the dwarven armorers and weaponsmiths.\n* Hall of Knowledge Home to the citys sages. Deeper parts were said to be guarded by magical constructs.\n* Market Hall A marketplace with a large fountain in the center.\n* Temple of the Soulforger A temple of Moradin on the fifth level. It had pillars carved into the shape of dwarves and an anvil-shaped altar.\nThe most famous treasure vaults of Roldilar were reputed to lay in the ruins of Sarbreen."
