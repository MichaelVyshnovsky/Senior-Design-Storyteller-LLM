The Breakers Rocks was an infamous reef resting in the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The reef was situated at the mouth of the unnamed bay upon which the city of Almorel was founded.
The submerged reef was responsible for sinking ships whose captains were unaware of the hidden danger.
