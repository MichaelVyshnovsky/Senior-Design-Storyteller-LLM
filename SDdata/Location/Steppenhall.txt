'''Steppenhall''', also referred to as '''Little Narfell''', was a small village and farming community located in the [[Soravia|Duchy of Soravia]] in eastern [[Damara]].

==Description==
Steppenhall sat along the winding banks of the [[Icelace River]] near its junction with the [[Galena Snake]], making it an important staging point for re-routing goods to the rest of the duchy. It also served as an informal meeting ground and watering hole for farmers from all across northeastern Damara, from nearby villages by [[Kinnery]] or [[Merkum]] to places far to the north, like [[Hinterford]] or [[Newbelle]]

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Steppenhall hosted the army of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]], led by [[Olwen Forest-Friend]], as they hunted down the last of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]]'s occupying forces following the [[Bloodstone Wars]]. It was used as a staging point to strike against a [[hobgoblin]] threat that folk hoped could serve as a way to unite the peoples of Damara and [[Narfell]].

==Inhabitants==
Given the close proximity with Narfell, many inhabitants of Steppenhall maintained close relationships with [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] tribesmen. Some of the tribesmen, especially of the [[Var]], even visited the village on a regular basis to hear the latest news of the region.

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Freezing Fox]], a tavern run by the gentle [[Tremaine]] and his beautiful daughter [[Meg]].
