The '''Great Worm Cavern''' was the traditional ancestor mound of the [[Great Worm Tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] in the [[North]]. It was dedicated to the [[Great Worm]] beast totem.

==Geography==
It lay at the base of a mountain in the [[Spine of the World]] range,

The caverns were part of a vast underground complex.

==Description==
Inside the biggest cavern was the ancestor mound itself, a large altar mound shaped like a great spiraling winged snake, which was the Great Worm.

==Inhabitants==
The central cavern was the home of [[Elrem|Elrem the Wise]], shaman of the Great Worm Tribe, potentially [[Uthgar]]'s living son, and a [[great worm]].
