'''Torzak-Belgirn''' was a forge city built on the mountainside of [[Solania]], near [[Rainfather's Peak]]. The city was built upon countless platforms extending from the mountainside, which gave it a metallic appearance.{{Template:Cite dungeon/173/Those once loyal}}

==Inhabitants==
It was known to be inhabited by the greatest craftsmen of the [[planes]], including the soul-forms of [[dwarven]] master smiths. All those artisans were working in the city by choice and built products of incredible quality, including [[weapon]]s, [[armor]]s, vehicles, and [[construct]]s.

==Notable Locations==
* The Soulforge of [[Moradin]]: This forge created by the chief deity of the [[dwarven pantheon]] was connected to the [[Crucible of Light]], and served to create the ''[[Rod of Law]]'' during the [[Dawn War]].
