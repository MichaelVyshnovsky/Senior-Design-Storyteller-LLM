        "mainbody": "arpers Hill was a large, bare hill just east of the village of Shadowdale. \nThroughout history, the hill was used as a meeting place for Harpers and elves from the Elven Court. A number of revels were also held on the hill.\nMost shadowfolk avoided the hill.\nWhile no one lived on the hill itself, folk could often be found in the area. Harpers, such as Storm Silverhand used the hill for practice and meditation."
