'''Qu'ellarz'orl''', also '''The Place of the Nobles''' or '''the House loft''', was a high plateau and district in the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]]. It was home to some of the most powerful [[List of drow houses|drow houses]] in the city, including [[House Baenre]], the most powerful house. Qu'ellarz'orl and [[Tier Breche]] combined were considered the "two heads" (most important unifying parts) of Menzoberranzan.

==Geography==
The plateau was located in the southwestern corner of the city and was screened from the rest of the city by a forest of giant mushrooms. On the other side of the forest was the wealthy district of [[Narbondellyn]].

There were nine tunnels between [[Lake Donigarten]] and the edge of the Qu'ellarz'orl plateau.

==Description==
In contrast to the rest of the city, Qu'ellarz'orl was spacious and bare; no crowds were found here, nor any businesses.

==Locations==
; [[House Baenre]] : Long the city's first house, it was located along the southern wall on the second tier of the highest ledge.
; [[House Xorlarrin]] : One of the ruling houses, until its inhabitants moved to [[Q'Xorlarrin]] in [[1484 DR]].
; [[House Mizzrym]] : A house with many [[mage]]s.
; [[House Agrach Dyrr]] : One of Menzoberranzan's more powerful houses.
