Quellarzorl, also The Place of the Nobles or the House loft, was a high plateau and district in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. It was home to some of the most powerful drow houses in the city, including House Baenre, the most powerful house. Quellarzorl and Tier Breche combined were considered the "two heads" (most important unifying parts) of Menzoberranzan.
The plateau was located in the southwestern corner of the city and was screened from the rest of the city by a forest of giant mushrooms. On the other side of the forest was the wealthy district of Narbondellyn.
There were nine tunnels between Lake Donigarten and the edge of the Quellarzorl plateau.
In contrast to the rest of the city, Quellarzorl was spacious and bare no crowds were found here, nor any businesses.

 House Xorlarrin  One of the ruling houses, until its inhabitants moved to QXorlarrin in 1484 DR.
 House Mizzrym  A house with many mages.
