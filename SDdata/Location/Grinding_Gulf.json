        "mainbody": "The '''Grinding Gulf''' was a large cavern underneath [[Fox Ridge]] in [[Shadowdale]].\n\nThe Grinding Gulf was a great chasm where flying boulders cascaded in a magical vertical dance. [[Elminster]] and [[Florin Falconhand]] once investigated the Grinding Gulf, but decided that it did not present an immediate threat.\n\nThe Grinding Gulf was an emanation of old, powerful earth magic. It was considered a Class-3 [[earth node]] and bore a strong aura of earth [[transmutation]] magic."
