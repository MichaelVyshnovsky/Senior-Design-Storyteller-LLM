        "mainbody": "apoza was an Azuposi pueblo of some 1,200 members, built on the banks of the Pasocada River in the Pasocada Basin.\nYapoza was supposedly founded where the spirit Matsailema stopped to rest after going on a destructive rampage. A man and woman found him as he rested, and the man recognized him as the destructive spirit. The man wanted to kill him, but the woman said he was still a god and to be respected. When Matsailema woke up, she gave him food and welcomed him into her home. After staying there for seven nights, he promised to bring prosperity instead of destruction upon the Azuposi, and institued the matriarchy to ensure wisdom and patience among them."
