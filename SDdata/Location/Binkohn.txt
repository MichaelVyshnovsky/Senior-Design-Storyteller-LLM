'''Binkohn''' was a town in [[Laothan]] in [[Malatra]].{{Cite interactive atlas|C2aNElc.FCW}}

==Geography==
It lay on Laothan's northern coast, on the shore of the [[Eastern Sea]], between [[Sayan]] and [[Thok Treng]].

==Economy==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the people of Binkohn logged the surrounding jungle  and traded timber, woodwork, and [[camphor]] oil to passing ships. Their craftsmen included several talented woodworkers.

==Inhabitants==
As well as the [[Seng]] [[human]] inhabitants, the area was home to a lot of [[bamboo spirit folk]]. They claimed certain secret places in the jungles and not tolerate any trespassing, so explorers and loggers were liable to come into conflict with them.
