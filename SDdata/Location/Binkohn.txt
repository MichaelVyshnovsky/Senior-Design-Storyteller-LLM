Binkohn was a town in Laothan in Malatra.
It lay on Laothans northern coast, on the shore of the Eastern Sea, between Sayan and Thok Treng.
In the mid–14 century DR, the people of Binkohn logged the surrounding jungle  and traded timber, woodwork, and camphor oil to passing ships. Their craftsmen included several talented woodworkers.
As well as the Seng human inhabitants, the area was home to a lot of bamboo spirit folk. They claimed certain secret places in the jungles and not tolerate any trespassing, so explorers and loggers were liable to come into conflict with them.
