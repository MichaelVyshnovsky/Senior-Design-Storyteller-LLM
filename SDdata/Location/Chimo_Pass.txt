'''Chimo Pass''' was a pass located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Chimo Pass was located in [[Fukudo Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. The Chimo Pass, the lowest and most accessible passage over the [[Dragon's Spine]], was a recent addition to the [[Imperial Post Road]] as of {{YearlinkConvert|1431|KY}}. At the pass's peak, [[bamboo]] and fern forests merged with [[cedar]] trees near the town of [[Chimotoge]], which was a vital junction for various smaller mountain trails.
