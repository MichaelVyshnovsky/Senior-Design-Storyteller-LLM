'''Citadel Felbarr''' in the [[Silver Marches]] was originally a dwarven citadel of over 25,000 dwarves that at different times in history had belonged to [[dwarves]], [[human]]s, [[orc]]s, and, since [[1367 DR]], once again the dwarves.

==Symbol==
The badge of office for the King of Citadel Felbarr was a simple golden crown adorned with three large [[sapphire]]s.{{Cite web/Personalities of the Silver Marches}}

==Geography==
Citadel Felbarr was located at the base of the [[Rauvin Mountains]] along the [[River Redrun]], with [[Silverymoon Pass]] to the south and [[Sundabar Vale]] to the east. A trade route connected Felbarr to [[Sundabar]] to the southeast and [[Beorunna's Well]] to the northwest beyond the [[Cold Wood]]. The Citadel sat about as far up the River Redrun as was navigable, meaning that the citadel was connected by river all the way down through the [[River Dessarin]].

Citadel Felbarr had tunnels in the [[upperdark|upper]] [[Upperdark]] that connected it to [[Mithral Hall]] in the west.

==History==
===Early History===
Originally a part of [[Delzoun]], Citadel Felbarr was completed in {{Yearlink|-1900}}.

In the [[273 DR|Year of the Delighted Dwarves]], three dwarf clans hailing from [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] and Citadel Felbarr migrated to [[Myth Drannor]].<ref name=tGHotR-p68>

In around [[1054 DR]], the dwarves abandoned Citadel Felbarr. The humans of [[Silverymoon]] quickly took advantage of this massive citadel and garrisoned it with over 3,000 troops.

After the [[Battle of Many Arrows]] in [[1104 DR]], which lasted many months, the citadel was captured by orcs and renamed the '''Citadel of Many Arrows'''.

===14{{th}} Century===
In the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], Citadel Felbarr was recaptured by a force of dwarves led by [[Emerus Warcrown]], alongside a contingent of soldiers from Silverymoon, when King [[Obould]]'s forces were exhausted after battling for four months against another orc tribe led by King [[Greneire]].

===15{{th}} Century===
Emerus Warcrown was still king as of [[1479 DR]].

In the [[1486 DR|Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR]], King Emerus Warcrown abdicated his throne and title to join [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] on the march to reclaim [[Gauntlgrym]]. The king was replaced by [[Parson Glaive]].

Some time after, the throne was given over to the royal couple King [[Morinn]] and Queen [[Tithmel]], a pair of wise monarchs who made it a point to rule as equals. Together, they gave their support to a group of adventurers to deal with the [[fire giant]] threat in the old forge of [[Ironslag]], led by the fire giant ruler, Duke [[Zalto]] and his family, after the removal of [[Ordning (social structure)|the Ordning]]. In return for their efforts fighting the giants, the monarchs of Citadel Felbarr offered to build the adventurers a fortified tower somewhere in the Silver Marches, as well as supply the tower with ten Felbarren dwarf guards.

==Relationships==
King Warcrown signed the [[Treaty of Garumn's Gorge]] with the orc King Obould along with King Bruenor Battlehammer at Mithral Hall.

==Economy==
Citadel Felbarr often traded with [[Beorunna's Well]], [[Quaervarr]], [[Silverymoon]], and [[Sundabar]]. It also exchanged caravans with [[Mithral Hall]]. 

==Locations==
;The Hammer: The first gate, comprising two 40-foot-high stone gates, on the path to The Runegate.
;The Anvil: The second gate, comprising two 30-foot-high stone gates, on the path to the Runegate, also where the path crossed the river.
;The Runegate: A pair of stone doors each 20-foot-square and 3-feet-thick. Covered in 32 deadly [[runes]], these gates were considered to be the greatest accomplishment of the dwarves in the reoccupation of Citadel Felbarr.
;North Vigil: A defensive area overlooking the path to the Runegate, complete with [[heavy catapult]]s and [[ballista]]e. Completed before the winter of [[1372 DR]].
;South Vigil: A defensive area overlooking the path to the Runegate, complete with heavy catapults and ballistae.
;Hall of Ceremony: A high cavern, part natural and part carved, with a large fireplace and the king's throne on a raised dais.
;Cemetery: The most revered part of the citadel. It was where [[Clan Warcrown]] was buried. It was always under construction for expansion. The oldest chamber was large with many tunnels and smaller rooms.
