Citadel Felbarr in the Silver Marches was originally a dwarven citadel of over 25,000 dwarves that at different times in history had belonged to dwarves, humans, orcs, and, since 1367 DR, once again the dwarves.
The badge of office for the King of Citadel Felbarr was a simple golden crown adorned with three large sapphires.
Citadel Felbarr was located at the base of the Rauvin Mountains along the River Redrun, with Silverymoon Pass to the south and Sundabar Vale to the east. A trade route connected Felbarr to Sundabar to the southeast and Beorunnas Well to the northwest beyond the Cold Wood. The Citadel sat about as far up the River Redrun as was navigable, meaning that the citadel was connected by river all the way down through the River Dessarin.
Citadel Felbarr had tunnels in the upper Upperdark that connected it to Mithral Hall in the west.
Originally a part of Delzoun, Citadel Felbarr was completed in .
In the Year of the Delighted Dwarves, three dwarf clans hailing from Ammarindar and Citadel Felbarr migrated to Myth Drannor.
In around 1054 DR, the dwarves abandoned Citadel Felbarr. The humans of Silverymoon quickly took advantage of this massive citadel and garrisoned it with over 3,000 troops.
After the Battle of Many Arrows in 1104 DR, which lasted many months, the citadel was captured by orcs and renamed the Citadel of Many Arrows.
In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, Citadel Felbarr was recaptured by a force of dwarves led by Emerus Warcrown, alongside a contingent of soldiers from Silverymoon, when King Oboulds forces were exhausted after battling for four months against another orc tribe led by King Greneire.
Emerus Warcrown was still king as of 1479 DR.
In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR, King Emerus Warcrown abdicated his throne and title to join Bruenor Battlehammer on the march to reclaim Gauntlgrym. The king was replaced by Parson Glaive.
Some time after, the throne was given over to the royal couple King Morinn and Queen Tithmel, a pair of wise monarchs who made it a point to rule as equals. Together, they gave their support to a group of adventurers to deal with the fire giant threat in the old forge of Ironslag, led by the fire giant ruler, Duke Zalto and his family, after the removal of the Ordning. In return for their efforts fighting the giants, the monarchs of Citadel Felbarr offered to build the adventurers a fortified tower somewhere in the Silver Marches, as well as supply the tower with ten Felbarren dwarf guards.
King Warcrown signed the Treaty of Garumns Gorge with the orc King Obould along with King Bruenor Battlehammer at Mithral Hall.
Citadel Felbarr often traded with Beorunnas Well, Quaervarr, Silverymoon, and Sundabar. It also exchanged caravans with Mithral Hall.
