'''Ss'zuraass'nee''', the '''City of Abominations''', was a large [[yuan-ti]] city in the [[underdark]], half a mile under the [[lizardfolk]] kingdom of [[Kalran]].

==Geography==
This city stood beside a dried-up riverbed that used to drain deeper into the Underdark.

==Description==
The walls of Ss'zuraass'nee were carved to look like a [[snake]]'s digestive tract. Moreover, there was an acidic tang that hung in the air and made unaccustomed creatures uncomfortable.

==History==
At one time, Ss'zuraass'nee served as the main center of trade between [[Najara]] and several communities in the Underdark. It was normal for [[drow]] merchants from [[Sshamath]] and [[Eryndlyn]], [[grimlock]] merchants from [[Reeshov]], [[derro]] merchants from [[Tsenviilyq]], and [[illithid]] merchants from [[Llacerellyn]] to be seen trading in the city. The city had a centuries-long standing alliance with Llacerellyn, and as a result of the positive relations, many [[yuan-tillithid]]s roamed the streets by [[1373 DR]].
