'''Buckralam's Starn''', briefly '''Fox's Starn''', was a small town somewhere in [[Faerûn]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|Forty cottages full of nosy old women who weave cloaks all day while their sheep wander untended|The bard [[Talost]], on Buckralam's Starn}}

==Geography==
Buckralam's Starn lay in a vale, the [[Starn (Valley)|Starn]], where the river [[Larrauden]] crossed the [[Gar's Road]].

==Trade==
The townsfolk were reported to herd [[sheep]] and produce [[cloak]]s from their [[wool]].

==Government==
Around {{yearlink|755}}, the [[Iron Fox]], a bandit, had taken over the town.

==Defenses==
Before the Iron Fox, the town was home to [[Taver's Talons]], an adventuring band.

==History==
Taver's Talons rode frequently through town until around {{yearlink|753}}, the year they were all slain by a [[dragon]]. Afterwards, the town was taken over by the Iron Fox, who took the Shrine of the Sheaf as his own "Fox Tower", published a code of laws, renamed the town to Fox's Starn, and claimed the land around it to be the [[Realm of the Fox]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The Iron Fox's men spread vile rumors about Taver's Talons, including that they were [[fiend]]s in human form, or scouts from a bandit kingdom.

==Notable Locations==
The town had a tavern, the [[Trough and Plough]], and boasted a small market, known simply as the Market; during the Iron Fox's rule, people were flogged in the market over minor transgressions. The local shrine to [[Chauntea]] was called the [[Shrine of the Sheaf]].

==Known Inhabitants==
* [[Immeira]]
* [[Rarendon]]
* [[Taver]]
* [[Adreim]]
