The '''Lone Tree''' was a hunters' camp located at the roots of a single lone tree that was easy to spot from afar on the sprawling white of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]'s snow.

==Geography==
The Lone Tree was around two days' travel north away from [[Lonelywood]] of [[Icewind Dale]] and was located in the Sea of Moving Ice.

There were no paths or roads that led to the Love Tree making the traveling there very difficult, especially without [[snowshoes]], as the way was covered in ice and snow throughout the year.

==Description==
The Lone Tree was visible from miles around, once the travelers entered the open landscape of the area. The camp under the tree was surrounded by walls made out of blocks of ice that protected the camp from the blistering winds of the open valley. The camp's grounds were sprouted with several 5-feet-high iron crossbar handles that protected the camp's leaders. These storage units protected supplies like dung fuel, food preserves, and blankets. During the time the was used by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], a makeshift mattress made out of [[moss]] could be found in the camp, moss being good insulation protecting the sleeper from the cold of frozen ground.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the camp was used by, then not famous, [[drow]] [[ranger]] hero Drizzt Do'Urden. By his friend's [[Regis]]' request, he met with adventurers hired by [[Celerum]] at the Lone Tree camp. Aided them in fighting off a pack of wolf-like wild dogs, and guided them through the Sea of Moving Ice to a rendezvous with the ancient barbarian [[Kinnuki]].
