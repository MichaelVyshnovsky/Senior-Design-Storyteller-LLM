        "mainbody": "The Valley of Khedrun () was a valley through which the River Mirar flowed from east to west, joined by the River Khedrun from the north, with the Spine of the World to the north and the Lurkwood to the south. It was filled with tall grass and dandelions. Its eastern edge was about a hundred miles east of Mirabar. It was (falsely) thought by some to be the location of Gauntlgrym.\nAccording to legend, Khedrun, a dwarf prospector, discovered the \"greatest cache of gems the world has ever seen\" and then built a home for himself and his fellows using only his axe.\n* Silvershore, a village that stood in the valley in the early 15 century DR. Around 1439 DR, drow massacred its inhabitants. The only citizen to survive the incident was an elf by the name of Etherik."
