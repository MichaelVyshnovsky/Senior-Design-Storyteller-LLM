        "mainbody": "The '''Valley of Khedrun''' ({{Pronounce|ka|hed|ROON|refs=}}) was a valley through which the [[River Mirar]] flowed from east to west, joined by the [[River Khedrun]] from the north, with the [[Spine of the World]] to the north and the [[Lurkwood]] to the south. It was filled with tall grass and [[dandelion]]s. Its eastern edge was about a hundred miles east of [[Mirabar]]. It was (falsely) thought by some to be the location of [[Gauntlgrym]].",
        "History": "According to legend, [[Khedrun]], a [[dwarf]] prospector, discovered the \"greatest cache of gems the world has ever seen\" and then built a home for himself and his fellows using only his axe.",
        "Notable Locations": "* '''Silvershore''', a village that stood in the valley in the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Around [[1439 DR]], [[drow]] massacred its inhabitants. The only citizen to survive the incident was an [[elf]] by the name of [[Etherik]]."
