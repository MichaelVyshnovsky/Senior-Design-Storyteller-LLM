        "mainbody": "Holdensword was a hamlet in Turmish in the Vilhon Reach in the 14 century DR.\nFairly isolated, Holdensword was located on the southeastern edge of Turmish, between Gildenglade and Jathrins Jump.\nThe hamlet sprung up around the namesake stronghold known as The Hold of the Sword. This was the base of a mercenary company, The Riders of the Sword, who were active in the earliest days of human settlement on the northern shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nBy 1370 DR, however, the Riders were long gone and the place was but a humble farming community.\nThe people here were cattle ranchers who kept their herds in the rolling uplands to the east and the south. They were known to be a stern and hardworking folk.\nThe old stronghold stood on a spur of rock in the southeast of the hamlet. Built of stone with massive walls and well fortified, it was a castle said to be as big and as imposing as anything found in Thay or Chessenta. Within the outcrop beneath it was a web of tunnels used for granaries and burial catacombs, and in former times as a long defensive gauntlet for defenders to retreat through.\nSomewhere within either the castle or the tunnels were a series of secret rooms that were the quarters and workplace of the wizard Olonther, a high-ranking member of The Riders of the Sword. He built dozens of battle horrors to defend the castle.\nIt was thought possible that some of Olonthers battle horrors remained hidden within the castle or the tunnels, waiting to be reactivated. Furthermore, it was speculated that Olonthers spellbooks, magic items, and treasure might be with them too, and even the old mage himself in some state."
