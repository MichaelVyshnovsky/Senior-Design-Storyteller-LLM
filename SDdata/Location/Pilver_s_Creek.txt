Pilvers Creek was a hamlet on the Moonsea as of the late 14 century DR.
Pilvers Creek lay near a marsh, on the Moonsea.
The small hamlet was important because of its trade in furs, herbs, snakeskins and crayfish. 
The mayors residence was a three-story post-and-beam structure, with a view to the harbor.
It was controlled by the city of Hillsfar. As of the late mid-14th century DR, the mayor was Stevvin Hightower, a captain in the Red Plumes.
After a creature with freezing breath started killing people around the hamlet in the late 14 century DR, he posted a 1,000 gp reward for it.
