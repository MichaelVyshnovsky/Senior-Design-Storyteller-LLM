        "mainbody": "Gnoll Pass was a mountain pass through the Storm Horns in northern Cormyr.\nThe Gnoll Pass ran between the eastern end of the Storm Horns and the smaller Gnoll Peaks, and carried the Moonsea Ride with it north from Arabel. It adjoined the Helmlands of northern Cormyr, and was a generally sparsely-inhabited and wild land.\nGnoll Pass was the main route of access from northern Cormyr into the Stonelands and beyond, handling the majority of trade, travelers and military movements. It was a vital strategic chokepoint that separated the Stonelands from Cormyr, and was guarded against invaders from the Stonelands by the defensive fortress of Castle Crag.\nThe area was well known for its coal mines, which were operated by people from Arabel, and dominated by the merchants of House Misrim."
