        "mainbody": "The Isle of One Thousand Pines was one of the Outer Isles of Wa in Kara-Tur. It was considered part of Jasuga Province. It was a densely forested place&mdashhence, its name.\nThe island was the site of a prison colony for Wa, until the prisoners were relocated to Ibhei, a larger island. The prison was abandoned and left to fall to ruins.\nKazuo Tokuri was the last prisoner to be held on the Isle. He was nephew to the former shogun, Matasuuri Shogoro, and had been framed for planning a coup. He died there, and his spirit was said to still linger in the ruins of the prison by 1357 DR.\nCategoryPrisons\nOne Thousand Pines\nOne Thousand Pines\nCategoryLocations in Jasuga Province\nCategoryLocations in Wa\nCategoryLocations in Kara-Tur\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n460xmqcp4njmgt4j4pq5urqmncw2cv8"
