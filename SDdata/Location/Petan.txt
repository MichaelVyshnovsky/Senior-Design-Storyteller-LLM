'''Petan''' was a country in the south of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Location==
Petan lay south of [[T'u Lung]] and west of the [[Warring States]].

==Geography==
Petan stood in a cleared area amidst the great rainforests of southern Kara-Tur, between the [[Fenghsintzu River]] in the north, the [[Rendah River]] in the northwest, and the [[Intan Mountains]] to the south with a fringe of forest covering the [[Banyan Foothills]], while the jungles lay away to the east at the country's back. The western realm was given over to rice valleys and lakes watered by the Rendah.

==Locations==
The capital city was called [[Penting]]. At the edge of the Intan Moutains stood the [[Putih Shrine]].<ref group="note">While the shrine in question is named the "Putin Shrine" in almost every map, this is almost certainly a typo; in the map provided in ''Ronin Challenge'', the shrine is instead named the "Putih Shrine", and in the font used for the labels, the "h" is easily mistaken for an "n". Furthermore, the word "putih" means "white" in [[Lidahan]], which may have been intended to be the language of Petan as well or at the very least connected to it (though this connection is never explicitly stated).

==Notable Inhabitants==
The [[monk]] [[Awang Sophir]], a practitioner of the martial art [[Wikipedia:silat|silat]], and his four students traveled from Petan to the [[Komite]] contest in [[Suijeng]], [[Shou Lung]], in [[1358 DR|Shou Year 2608 (1358 DR)]].
