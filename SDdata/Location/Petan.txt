Petan was a country in the south of Kara-Tur.
Petan lay south of Tu Lung and west of the Warring States.
Petan stood in a cleared area amidst the great rainforests of southern Kara-Tur, between the Fenghsintzu River in the north, the Rendah River in the northwest, and the Intan Mountains to the south with a fringe of forest covering the Banyan Foothills, while the jungles lay away to the east at the countrys back. The western realm was given over to rice valleys and lakes watered by the Rendah.
The capital city was called Penting. At the edge of the Intan Moutains stood the Putih Shrine.While the shrine in question is named the "Putin Shrine" in almost every map, this is almost certainly a typo in the map provided in Ronin Challenge, the shrine is instead named the "Putih Shrine", and in the font used for the labels, the "h" is easily mistaken for an "n". Furthermore, the word "putih" means "white" in Lidahan, which may have been intended to be the language of Petan as well or at the very least connected to it (though this connection is never explicitly stated).
The monk Awang Sophir, a practitioner of the martial art silat, and his four students traveled from Petan to the Komite contest in Suijeng, Shou Lung, in Shou Year 2608 (1358 DR).
