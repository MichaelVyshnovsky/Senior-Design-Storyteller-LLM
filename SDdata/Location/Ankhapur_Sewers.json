        "mainbody": "The sewers of Ankhapur were a sanitation system beneath the eponymous Arnaden port city of the same name.\n* In a disused and otherwise a dead-end portion of the sewers, that was teeming with wildlife and not far from Ankhapurs docks, was a portal set up by the Moonstars as part of their network of portals for ease of access across the continent of Faer√ªn.\n* A grick of abnormally large size and intelligence, distinguished by a bright green beak, made its home in these sewers. It was on good terms with the Moonstars and would not attack anyone coming through or into the area the portal was in, a portion of the sewers that the grick claimed as part of its hunting ground. Though recognizing that the Moonstars were \"not food\", the grick would not endeavor to provide them any assistance or aid. Likewise, Moonstar agents that utilized the portal were warned not to attack the grick.\nIn the , the Turmish Emperor at the time, Shoon VII, took drastic measures ridding the cities of Ankhapur, Calimport, Innarlith, and Ithmong of their criminal underworlds. He ordered oil to be poured into their respective sewers, causing the Great Fires that destroyed the four cities nearly completely, with a deathtoll numbering over three million people.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Ankhapur was one among many cities that raise or instate new taxes in order to pay for civic utilities such as its sewer, defensive walls, public pumps and troughs, and streets."
