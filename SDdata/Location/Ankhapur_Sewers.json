Though recognizing that the Moonstars were \"not food\", the grick would not endeavor to provide them any assistance or aid. Likewise, Moonstar agents that utilized the ''portal'' were warned not to attack the grick.",

He ordered [[oil]] to be poured into their respective sewers, causing the [[Great Fires]] that destroyed the four cities nearly completely, with a deathtoll numbering over three million people.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, Ankhapur was one among many cities that raise or instate new taxes in order to pay for civic utilities such as its sewer, defensive walls, public pumps and troughs, and streets.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/191/Eye on the Realms: Jalander's Dodge|1}}"
