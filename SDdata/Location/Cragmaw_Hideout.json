        "Description": "[[File:PortionNeverwinterWood.png|thumb|250px|right|Cragmaw Hideout to the south-west.]]\nThe entrance to the cave complex was under a large hill, and had a shallow stream flowing out of it. It had four main rooms and several smaller trails linking them. There was also two large pools of water, which could be released to cause a flood. A crudely made bridge linked the room at the end of the river to the second-in-command's room, where prisoners were also kept.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the cave was inhabited by the [[Cragmaw tribe]]. At this point in time, they were led by the [[bugbear]], [[Klarg]] and his second-in-command, [[Yeemik]].",
        "Scope of Operations": "The hideout was the setting from which the Cragmaw tribe launched efforts to harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin.  Targetting of poorly defended caravans and travellers were common. The tribe had also been known to engage in kidnapping and hostage-taking on the High Road."
