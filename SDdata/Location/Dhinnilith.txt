'''Dhinnilith''', also known as the '''First City of the Sword''', was a phantom city rumored to appear on moonless nights every few years, hovering over the waters of the [[Vilhon Reach]], just north of the [[Chondalwood]].<ref name=LEoF-pp114-115/>

==History==
Dhinnilith was the first of the Twelve Cities of the Sword of [[Jhaamdath]], founded in {{Yearlink|-5750}} by that empire's [[psionic]] rulers.<ref name=LEoF-pp114-115/> It was supposed destroyed with the rest of Jhaamdath in the {{YearlinkName|-255}}, when the [[Elf|elves]] used [[Elven High Magic|high magic]] to send a tidal wave in retaliation for the slaughter of the elves of the Chondalwood.<ref name=LEoF-pp114-115/>

As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, no explorer had located the ruins of Dhinnilith on the bottom of the [[Vilhon Reach]].<ref name=LEoF-p120/>

==Rumors & Legends==
Persistent rumors were spread that Dhinnilith had somehow survived the great destruction of the Year of Furious Waves. It was claimed that a city of phantom stone would rise out of the waters of the Vilhon Reach on moonless nights and vanish before sunrise. The last such sighting occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}.<ref name=LEoF-p120/>

While as of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, no adventurer had explored the transient city, the truth was that the city's only remaining inhabitant was a [[caller in darkness]], a ghostly cloud with thousands of human faces, silently screaming in terror and anguish.<ref name=LEoF-p120/>
