'''The Druid's Deep''' was a hidden refuge in the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]], used by the [[druid]]s of [[Thorngap]]. It was briefly taken over by the druid [[Halsaime]] in the 1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

|Well, now there's a good question. We know that it's somewhere in Thorngap. And we know it has been sacred to druids for a very, very long time. Most of all, we know that it is well hidden.

The Druid's Deep was an extension of Thorngap, and was hidden by the surrounding rocky terrain and the thick canopy of the King's Forest. At the heart of the Deep was an ancient circle of huge standing stones.

The Deep was only accessible by swimming through a long underground tunnel that was flooded by water, which alone would dissuade most intruders. Additionally, some deeper caves connected directly to the [[Underdark]].

==Inhabitants==
After taking over Thorngap and the Deep, Halsaime assembled a force of corrupted druids, rangers, [[dryad]]s, [[Will-o'-wisp|wisps]], [[vine horror]]s, [[wood woad]]s, [[bear]]s, and [[wolves]]. Among them were the ranger [[Kuldail Ukien]] and the druid [[Juhni]].

Around this time, the [[bog hag]] [[Aghilde]] made her home in a corner of the Druid's Deep that contained a murky bog. Additionally, a group of [[drow]] males emerged in the caves beneath Druid's Deep, seeking an escape from the oppressive [[Lolthite]] matriarchy and the opportunity to terrorize the surface on their own terms. They carried with them a suit of ''[[firebreak]]'' armor, which was likely taken from them by force after running into surfacer adventurers.

==History==

}}
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the druid [[Halsaime]] received a [[Halsaime's staff|powerful cursed staff]] from his friend [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]]. Oriphaun had taken it from a [[Shadovar]] agent he killed while protecting the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'', and correctly identified that it was a dangerous artifact best handled by the wise. Unfortunately, Halsaime was overcome by a furious madness and used the staff's power to twist nature and his fellow foresters into a force to conquer the world with.

The [[Harpers]] [[Kirinel Zay]], [[Tarim Inavule]], and [[Jussko Kwahn]] investigated the situation after the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] returned from Thorngap carrying the [[red musk zombie|red musk]] disease. After finding [[Carm Woodrusk]] at Halsaime's former home of [[Thorn Hollow]], they narrowed in on the Druid's Deep where Halsaime was hiding. The agents fought past the defenses and finally cornered the druid, who had already temporarily ''[[petrified]]'' Jussko. After a fierce battle, the cursed druid was slain and the staff finally destroyed.
