The Starshine Academy was a school for arts and horticulture located in Blackule Lane, in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter.
The Starshine Academy taught its students how to create and appreciate art, as well as herb lore, agricultural knowledge and skills, and to know wild animals by scent, sound, and spoor. The school also sold paintings, herbs, recipes, animal-track-reference drawings, and healing potions.
However, the school also catered to people wanting to learn how to make more dangerous potions such as those that induced sleep, heightened sensations, or lust. It was also rumored that the school even sold poisons.
As of 1480 DR, the Starshine Academy was one of the few academies active in Neverwinter after the Ruining of 1451 DR.As the material in Ed Greenwood Presents Elminsters Forgotten Realms is intended to be useful regardless of what Dungeons & Dragons edition one may be playing, this implies that Starshine Academy must have survived the destruction of most of Neverwinter during the storyline that took place in 4th-edition.
