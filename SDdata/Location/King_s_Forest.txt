The '''King's Forest''' (called the '''Shadowood''' by the [[Evenor]]s It was once home to [[elves]], as the westernmost fragment of [[Cormanthor]], but they abandoned the forest to humankind. The King's Forest was so named because it was the property of the crown. After the [[Goblin War]] ended in [[1371 DR]], the forest became infested with [[orc]]s. Previous to this it had been free of evil creatures.

==Geography==
A network of roads passed through this forest that connected many small towns and farms in Cormyr.

The [[Starwater River]] ran through it.

Foresters' caches were spread through the King's Forest, marked with two ovals joined by an arc. The markings were nothing but easily missable scratches. These caches sometimes contained [[boots]], [[tunic]]s, [[belt]]s, [[breeches]], [[rope]]s, weather[[cloak]]s, [[knife|knives]], [[arrow]]s, and some non-perishable provisions, like nuts.

===Flora & Fauna===
[[File:King's Forest.png|thumb|''A path through the King's Forest.''|450px]]
The flora within King's Forest primarily consisted of [[maple]], [[oak]], and [[rowan]] trees that created high canopies. There was very little undergrowth.

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] there were no major predators within the forest and it was devoid of intelligent monsters. The largest fauna that could be found within it were [[bear]]s. Due to this lack of natural threats it was densely inhabited and a popular spot for hunting, though such activity was forbidden and typically carried a penalty of forced labor.

==History==
The King's Forest was probably a remnant of the [[Forest Country]] (also known as the [[Forest Kingdom]]) which was a forest basin.

In the {{YearlinkName|70}}, all the [[wizard]]s of Cormyr were gathered together by [[Baerauble Etharr]] to destroy several ''[[portal]]s'' within the King's Forest that had been unleashing monsters into the surrounding area.<ref>{{Cite dragon/307/Heroes of Cormyr: Adventuring in the Forest Kingdom}}

King [[Duar Obarskyr]]'s army defeated the [[orc]] invaders of the King's Forest in the {{YearlinkName|429}}.

The Dragon [[Thauglor]], the Black Doom, was defeated in the King's Forest after being lured into a trap in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}. Prince [[Azoun II]] inflicted the final blow, piercing his brain with the sword ''[[Orbyn]]''.

The end of the [[Goblin War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}} resulted in [[orc]]s infesting the King's Forest.

By this time, King's Forest, the [[Hullack Forest]], and [[Hermit's Wood]] were almost all that remained of the southern reaches of Cormanthor in Cormyr, having been pushed back significantly during the prosperous reign of [[Azoun IV]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Dathyl]], a spring that ran through the forest near [[Espar]]. The waters of Dathyl were waist-deep and lush with [[brownfin]].
* [[Dhedluk (town)|Dhedluk]], a town that stood within the heart of the forest.
* [[Waymoot]], the largest town within the King's Forest.

==Inhabitants==
Some of the [[fey]] that were known to inhabit the King's Forest were [[korred]]s.
