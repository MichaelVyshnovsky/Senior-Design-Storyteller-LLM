'''Meruyama''' was a volcano located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Meruyama was located in [[Migri Province]] in the cool northern region of the island of [[Shinkoku]]. This slumbering volcano occasionally rumbled with restlessness, holding the distinction of being the loftiest among all of Kozakura's volcanoes. Surprisingly, its slopes remained unusually warm, seldom retaining snow, even during the coldest winters. The peak intermittently emitted steam and sporadically released ash and mud flows, contributing to numerous earthquakes in the surrounding area.

==Inhabitants==
The presence of [[tengu]] and [[oni]] around Meruyama could be particularly vexing, creating a bothersome environment for travelers and locals alike. Furthermore, encounters with [[shinen-gaki]] were not uncommon.
