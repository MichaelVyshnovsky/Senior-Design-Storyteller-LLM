The '''Kumen''', or '''Ancient Gate''', was a gateway on the [[Dragonwall]].

==Geography==
This particular gateway was located at the southern end of the wall near [[Khazari]].

==History==
The Kumen, and a large portion of the surrounding wall, was obliterated when the [[Tuigan]] invaders were able to release the [[dragon]] spirit from the Dragonwall. The opening created by the spirit's release allowed the invaders to flow into [[Shou Lung]].
