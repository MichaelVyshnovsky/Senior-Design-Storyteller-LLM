The Kumen, or Ancient Gate, was a gateway on the Dragonwall.
This particular gateway was located at the southern end of the wall near Khazari.
The Kumen, and a large portion of the surrounding wall, was obliterated when the Tuigan invaders were able to release the dragon spirit from the Dragonwall. The opening created by the spirits release allowed the invaders to flow into Shou Lung.
