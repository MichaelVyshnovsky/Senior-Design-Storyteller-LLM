        "mainbody": "he Witchlight Carnival was a planes-faring carnival originating from the Feywild. It was a whimsical fair of dizzying sights and wondrous attractions that visited numerous planets across the Prime Material plane once every eight years.\nWhen packed up and in transit, the Witchlight Carnival was entirely contained within a caravan of wagons, pulled by horses and foxes.\nThere was a known fey crossing in the carnivals fairgrounds, which connected it to the domain of Prismeer.\nThe Witchlight Carnival was owned and operated by two shadar-kai named Mister Witch and Mister Light. These entrepreneurs grew up together in Gloomwrought, a city in the Shadowfell, before entering into business together as carnivaleers.\nThe 124 workers kept the carnival running were known as the Witchlight hands. They operated games and booths, maintained equipment, kept the circus animals, and acted as ticket-takers, among other activities.\nWhen the Witchlight Carnival arrived at a world, it would set up outside a large population center. After some time it would move on to another settlement, until it was decided that it relocated to another planet.\nThe carnival opened just as dusk arrived at a given locale, and continued for a number of hours until the light of the next day.\nWhile there were no written rules for how carnival-goers had to conduct themselves, offensive actions could result in expulsion. Courtesy and good-humor went a long way in endearing an individual to performers. Add detail about mood\nBefore it was so named, the Witchlight Carnival was originally owned and operated by an eladrin named Isolde. After a night of drinking, Isolde swapped her fey-themed carnival with that run by the two shadar-kai who eventually became Mister Witch and Mister Light.\nThe Witchlight Carnival was known to have arrived at the town of Daggerford at least twice, over the course of eight years.\nNotable Attractions at the Witchlight Carnival included\n* Big Top, the great tent that served as a venue for a midnight celebration and the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch.\n* Carousel, a carnival ride of eight speaking, wooden unicorns.\n* Giant dragonflies, which rested upon giant lily pads and offered rides to attendees.\n* Hall of Illusions, a tented room that held a network of mirrors, that showed people how they would look as they aged. Within the hall was a passageway that linked the Witchlight Carnival to the realm of Prismeer.\n* The Mystery Mine, a magic-powered ride that involved a mine cart that was propelled into the opening of a dragons mouth and into a \"abandoned\" mine. \n* Pixie Kingdom, the grove of oak trees within which dwelled a community of about a dozen pixies and their hamster companion.\n* Silversong Lake, a shimmering lake that was home to quippers and the mermaid Palasha.\nOther, smaller sites included\n* Almiraj ring toss.\n* \"Catch the Dragon by the Tail\", a game that involved blindfolding guests and a red faerie dragon.\n* Cyclops staring contest.\n* Food stalls that sold goodies such as cupcakes, candied apples, cookies, tarts, and other confectioneries.\n* Gnome poetry contest.\n* Goblin wrestling.\n* Snail racing, in which riders raced around a course atop giant snails. \n* Diana Cloppington, a woman cursed by a hag to resemble a centaur, who ran the carousel.\n* Dirlagraun, who helped reunite any children that went missing at the carnival with their guardians.\n* Palasha, the mermaid whose singing attracted many carnival-goers to the Silversong Lake."
