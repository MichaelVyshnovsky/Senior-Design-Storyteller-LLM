        "mainbody": "The '''Witchlight Carnival''' was a [[Cosmology|planes]]-faring carnival originating from the [[Feywild]]. It was a whimsical fair of dizzying sights and wondrous attractions that visited numerous [[planet]]s across the [[Prime Material plane]] once every eight years.\n\n{{Quote|Greetings, fair fairgoers! Welcome to the Witchlight.|[[Nikolas Midnight]].{{Cite comic/Dungeons & Dragons Annual 2022}}}}",
        "Description": "When packed up and in transit, the Witchlight Carnival was entirely contained within a caravan of wagons, pulled by [[horse]]s and [[fox]]es.",
        "Geography": "There was a known [[fey crossroad|fey crossing]] in the carnival's fairgrounds, which connected it to the [[domains of Delight|domain]] of [[Prismeer]].",
        "Organization": "The Witchlight Carnival was owned and operated by two [[shadar-kai (elf)|shadar-kai]] named [[Mister Witch]] and [[Mister Light]]. These entrepreneurs grew up together in [[Gloomwrought]], a city in the [[Shadowfell]], before entering into business together as carnivaleers.\n\nThe 124 workers kept the carnival running were known as the Witchlight hands. They operated games and booths, maintained equipment, kept the circus' animals, and acted as ticket-takers, among other activities.",
        "Activities": "When the Witchlight Carnival arrived at a world, it would set up outside a large population center. After some time it would move on to another settlement, until it was decided that it relocated to another planet.\n\nThe carnival opened just as dusk arrived at a given locale, and continued for a number of hours until the light of the next day.",
        "Rules and Etiquette": "While there were no written rules for how carnival-goers had to conduct themselves, offensive actions could result in expulsion. Courtesy and good-humor went a long way in endearing an individual to performers. Add detail about mood",
        "History": "Before it was so named, the Witchlight Carnival was originally owned and operated by an [[fey eladrin|eladrin]] named [[Isolde (eladrin)|Isolde]]. After a night of drinking, Isolde swapped her fey-themed carnival with that run by the two shadar-kai who eventually became Mister Witch and Mister Light.\n\nThe Witchlight Carnival was known to have arrived at the town of [[Daggerford]] at least twice, over the course of eight years.{{Cite comic/Dungeons & Dragons Annual 2022}}",
        "Notable Locations": "Notable Attractions at the Witchlight Carnival included:\n* Big Top, the great tent that served as a venue for a midnight celebration and the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch.\n* Carousel, a carnival ride of eight speaking, wooden unicorns.\n* [[Giant dragonfly|Giant dragonflies]], which rested upon giant lily pads and offered rides to attendees.\n* Hall of Illusions, a tented room that held a network of mirrors, that showed people how they would look as they aged. Within the hall was a passageway that linked the Witchlight Carnival to the realm of Prismeer.\n* The Mystery Mine, a magic-powered ride that involved a mine cart that was propelled into the opening of a [[dragon]]'s mouth and into a \"abandoned\" mine. \n* Pixie Kingdom, the grove of [[oak]] trees within which dwelled a community of about a dozen [[pixie]]s and their [[hamster]] companion.\n* Silversong Lake, a shimmering lake that was home to [[quipper]]s and the [[mermaid]] [[Palasha]].\n\nOther, smaller sites included:\n* [[Almiraj]] ring toss.\n* \"Catch the Dragon by the Tail\", a game that involved blindfolding guests and a red [[faerie dragon]].\n* Cyclops staring contest.\n* Food stalls that sold goodies such as [[cupcake]]s, [[candied apple]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[tart]]s, and other confectioneries.\n* Gnome poetry contest.\n* Goblin wrestling.\n* Snail racing, in which riders raced around a course atop [[giant snail]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Carnival Workers": "* [[Diana Cloppington]], a woman cursed by a [[hag]] to resemble a [[centaur]], who ran the carousel.\n* [[Dirlagraun]], who helped reunite any children that went missing at the carnival with their guardians.\n* [[Palasha]], the mermaid whose singing attracted many carnival-goers to the Silversong Lake."
