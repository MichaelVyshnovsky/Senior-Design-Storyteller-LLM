        "mainbody": "Uruth Ukrypt was a kingdom of orcs in the Sword Mountains that menaced the Sword Coast North and Dessarin Valley in the 10 and early 11 centuries DR.\nThe kingdom was ruled from Melairrin for most of its history, a secure citadel beneath Mount Sar in the Sword Mountains. Within this fortress, the first three kings ruled from the Bloodbone Throne of Uruth, a powerful enchanted chair made of the bones of the orcs ancient enemies which bestowed magical powers to those who sat upon it, including the ability to summon blood elementals.\nWhile Uruth Ukrypt had a king, the real power in the realm was held by the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge, a monastic order dedicated to the orc god Yurtrus, who operated out of a sacred crypt known as the Ukrypt.\nThe realm never developed any agriculture, and relied on hunting wild game to feed its inhabitants. This practice decimated much of the wild game within their territory, leading them to rely on raiding nearby human farming settlements to feed their population.\nIn addition to their ability to quickly raise massive hordes of orcs,\nUruth Ukrypt kept written records, at least early in the realms history. However, these were poorly maintained and many were subsequently lost.\nThe backbone of the kingdom was the religion of the Yurtrus, The holy symbol of Yurtrus&mdashtwo white hands&mdashwas used as a symbol of Uruth Ukrypt.\nThe kingdom was founded in the , by an orc shaman named Wund. After accurately predicting Yurtruss Blood Plagues of that year, he created the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge and united the surviving orcs of the Sword Mountains under his spiritual guidance. He then coronated a brutish orc chieftain named Uruth to be the first king of a new realm,\nThe fledgling nation soon started attacking its neighbors. As of the , the orcs had eradicated all major gnomish settlements in the Sword Mountains and surrounding hills. Then, in the , Wund led Uruth Ukrypt to launch an attack on the Dessarin Valley and to lay siege to Waterdeep (then called Nimoars Hold) in what would become known as the Orcfastings War. Despite several initial victories by the orcs, they were beaten back in a quick series of defeats during which first Uruth and then Wund were slain, leading to a rout. The Dessarin Valley suffered the brunt of the war, with the Knights of the Silver Horn being sent into decline and many of the smaller human settlements having been destroyed, leading to an influx of refugees into Waterdeep.\nIn the , the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt rallied under King Rauragh to once again attack Waterdeep, this time via the Underdark. However, their horde was scattered by Palarandusk, a mighty gold dragon, before it was able to fully muster.\nThe orcish realm soon depleted the wild game in the Sword Mountains and Kryptgarden Forest, leading them to rely on raiding human lands for food.\nDuring the Rage of Dragons in the , Uruth Ukrypt lost much of its food supply and treasures when the realm was ravaged by the green dragon Claugiyliamatar and the black dragon Shammagar. Notably, Shammagar attacked Melairrin directly, claiming the citadel as his lair along with the Bloodbone Throne itself.\nIn the , a band of Waterdhavian adventurers called the Dawnbringer Company plundered the sacred Ukrypt. In retaliation, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge raised the realms first orc horde in generations with the goal of destroying Waterdeep. This mighty army, dubbed the \"Broken Bone horde\", was defeated by Waterdeeps armies later that year with substantial help from the bronze dragon Lhammaruntosz.\nAfter stewing in rage and resentment for two years, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge mustered the last of Uruth Ukrypts strength to raise the \"Black Claw horde\" in the . This force laid siege to Waterdeep, completely encircling the city and successfully killing its leader, Warlord Laroun, The new Warlord, Raurlor, successfully broke the siege by sending an elite strike force through Undermountain to flank the invaders. Soon, it had disintegrated into warring clans.\nIt was suggested that the Kryptgarden Forests name was derived from the name of Uruth Ukrypt.\n* Melairrin, an old dwarven stronghold seized by the orcs and made into their base of operations.\n* Ukrypt, a sacred crypt to the orcs, and of special importance to the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge.\nThe orcs of Uruth Ukrypt traced their lineage to the legendary orc horde that decimated Phalorm in the . In addition to orcs, the realm was home to the occasional evil wizard.\n* Uruth, the first king and namesake of Uruth Ukrypt.\n* Wund, the shaman who founded the realm and was the true ruler behind the throne of Uruth.\n* Rauragh, a successor to Uruth.\n* Lethchauntos, a wizard who provided magic items to the orcs."
