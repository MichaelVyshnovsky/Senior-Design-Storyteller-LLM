        "mainbody": "'''Uruth Ukrypt''' was a kingdom of [[orc]]s in the [[Sword Mountains]] that menaced the [[Sword Coast North]] and [[Dessarin Valley]] in the 10{{th}} and early 11{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "Government": "The kingdom was ruled from [[Melairrin]] for most of its history, a secure citadel beneath [[Mount Sar]] in the Sword Mountains.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}} Within this fortress, the first three kings ruled from the ''[[Bloodbone Throne of Uruth]]'', a powerful [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] chair made of the bones of the orcs' ancient enemies which bestowed [[magic]]al powers to those who sat upon it, including the ability to summon [[blood elemental]]s.{{Cite dragon/351/Volo's Guide: Lost Regalia of the North: The Toppled Thrones|73}}\n\nWhile Uruth Ukrypt had a king, the real power in the realm was held by the [[Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge]], a monastic order dedicated to the [[Orc pantheon|orc god]] [[Yurtrus]],{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}} who operated out of a sacred crypt known as the [[Ukrypt]].",
        "Trade": "The realm never developed any agriculture, and relied on hunting wild game to feed its inhabitants. This practice decimated much of the wild game within their territory, leading them to rely on raiding nearby [[human]] farming settlements to feed their population.",
        "Defenses": "In addition to their ability to quickly raise massive [[horde]]s of orcs,",
        "Culture": "Uruth Ukrypt kept written records, at least early in the realm's history. However, these were poorly maintained and many were subsequently lost.\n\nThe backbone of the kingdom was the religion of the Yurtrus, The holy symbol of Yurtrus&mdash;two white hands&mdash;was used as a symbol of Uruth Ukrypt.",
        "History": "The kingdom was founded in the {{YearlinkName|927}}, by an orc shaman named [[Wund]]. After accurately predicting Yurtrus's [[Blood Plagues]] of that year, he created the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge and united the surviving orcs of the Sword Mountains under his spiritual guidance. He then coronated a brutish orc chieftain named [[Uruth]] to be the first king of a new realm,\n\nThe fledgling nation soon started attacking its neighbors.{{Cite dragon/258/Voaraghamanthar, \"the Black Death\"|54}} As of the {{YearlinkName|934}}, the orcs had eradicated all major [[gnome|gnomish]] settlements in the Sword Mountains and surrounding hills. Then, in the {{YearlinkName|936}}, Wund led Uruth Ukrypt to launch an attack on the Dessarin Valley and to lay siege to [[Waterdeep]] (then called [[Nimoar]]'s Hold) in what would become known as the [[Orcfastings War]]. Despite several initial victories by the orcs, they were beaten back in a quick series of defeats during which first Uruth and then Wund were slain, leading to a rout. The Dessarin Valley suffered the brunt of the war, with the [[Knights of the Silver Horn]] being sent into decline and many of the smaller human settlements having been destroyed, leading to an influx of refugees into Waterdeep.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|940}}, the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt rallied under King [[Rauragh]] to once again attack Waterdeep, this time via the [[Underdark]]. However, their horde was scattered by [[Palarandusk]], a mighty [[gold dragon]], before it was able to fully muster.\n\nThe orcish realm soon depleted the wild game in the Sword Mountains and [[Kryptgarden Forest]], leading them to rely on raiding human lands for food.\n\nDuring the [[Rage of Dragons]] in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, Uruth Ukrypt lost much of its food supply and treasures when the realm was ravaged by the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]] and the [[black dragon]] [[Shammagar]]. Notably, Shammagar attacked Melairrin directly, claiming the citadel as his lair along with the ''Bloodbone Throne'' itself.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, a band of Waterdhavian [[adventurer]]s called the [[Dawnbringer Company]] plundered the sacred Ukrypt. In retaliation, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge raised the realm's first orc horde in generations with the goal of destroying Waterdeep. This mighty army, dubbed the \"[[Broken Bone]] horde\", was defeated by Waterdeep's armies later that year with substantial help from the [[bronze dragon]] [[Lhammaruntosz]].\n\nAfter stewing in rage and resentment for two years, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge mustered the last of Uruth Ukrypt's strength to raise the \"[[Black Claw]] horde\" in the {{YearlinkName|1026}}. This force laid siege to Waterdeep, completely encircling the city and successfully killing its leader, Warlord [[Laroun]], The new Warlord, [[Raurlor]], successfully broke the siege by sending an elite strike force through [[Undermountain]] to flank the invaders. Soon, it had disintegrated into warring clans.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was suggested that the Kryptgarden Forest's name was derived from the name of Uruth Ukrypt.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Melairrin]], an old dwarven stronghold seized by the orcs and made into their base of operations.\n* [[Ukrypt]], a sacred crypt to the orcs, and of special importance to the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Uruth]], the first king and namesake of Uruth Ukrypt.\n* [[Wund]], the shaman who founded the realm and was the true ruler behind the throne of Uruth.\n* [[Rauragh]], a successor to Uruth.\n* [[Lethchauntos]], a wizard who provided magic items to the orcs."
