        "Inhabitants": "The land of Merrouroboros was inhabited by the legendary [[creator races]] and the early [[jotunbrud]] and [[human]] tribes.",
        "History": "After the creation of the planet Abeir-Toril, that world had a great Ice Age, which ended in approximately {{Yearlink|-35000}}. At this time, the continent of [[Faer没n]] did not yet exist; instead, Faer没n was joined with [[Kara-Tur]], [[Maztica]], and [[Zakhara]] as part of Merrouroboros.\n\nThe [[sarrukh]] were the first to establish an empire on Merrouroboros,<ref group=\"note\">The name Merrouroboros seems derived from the name of the sarrukh's primary god, [[World Serpent|Ourobros the World Serpent]]. ruling over most of the land that would later be Faer没n. Third came the [[batrachi]] empires, coming to prominence some 500 years later and peaking around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. Lastly, the [[aearee]] empires emerged.\n\nMerrouroboros ceased to exist around {{Yearlink|-17600}} in the great cataclysm known as the [[First Sundering]], which caused the super-continent to break apart into [[Faer没n]], [[Maztica]], and [[Katashaka]], and the appearance of [[Evermeet]].<ref>"
