'''Amah''' was a city-state of the [[Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach]] that maintained neutrality between [[Turmish]] and [[Chondath]]. Along with the cities of [[Nleeth]], and [[Reth]], they were sometimes referred to as the Southsands Games.

==History==
Amah was settled in {{YearlinkName|320}}, originally to be used as a neutral training center for mock-battles Turmish and Chondath. The cities of Nleeth and Reth, served the same function, one alien with Turmish, wile the other - with Chondath. Both were established the same year. After the mining town of [[Aelor]] exhausted its [[gold]] production, it lost its population to the neighboring city of Amah.

In [[1358 DR]], the Mayor of Amah at the time - [[Pachipol]], participated in a meeting of leaders of both [[Chondath]] and Turmish to discuss the menace of the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]].

As of [[1370 DR]], Amah and Nleeth were still used as training centers for outside armies, however bloodshed of the towns' past was abandoned. The visiting armies of Turmish and Chondath clashed in competitions of combat mettle and tactics.
