        "Inhabitants": "The island was inhabited by various [[human]] [[barbarian]] tribes. The waters around the island were home to a large population of [[dragon turtle]]s, who were hunted by the island's inhabitants. The barbarians worshiped a deity who was a dragon turtle spirit. An annual religious ceremony involved a live individual being thrown into the sea, as a sacrifice to appease the dragon turtle spirit."
