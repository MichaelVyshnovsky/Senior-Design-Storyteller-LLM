        "mainbody": "Obakuto was an island located in Kozakura.\nObakuto was found to the southeast of Hinomoto. It was used as a landmark by sailors because of its distinctive spires of rock that rose up from the jagged coastline.\nThe island was inhabited by various human barbarian tribes. The waters around the island were home to a large population of dragon turtles, who were hunted by the islands inhabitants. The barbarians worshiped a deity who was a dragon turtle spirit. An annual religious ceremony involved a live individual being thrown into the sea, as a sacrifice to appease the dragon turtle spirit."
