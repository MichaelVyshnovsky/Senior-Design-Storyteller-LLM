The Hidden Forest was a large forest in ancient Netheril, named for the Hidden Lake at its center.
The Hidden Forest completely surrounded Hidden Lake, and was itself bordered to the east by the Lodestar Mountains and to the west by the Shinantra Mountains. The largest part of the forest was to the north, with a thinner body of trees lining the other sides of the lake. The Southfill River, Cede Run, Dahla River, Tarn River, and Kraal Brook all flowed down from the mountains through the forest, eventually ending in the lake.
The elven village of Hoyden sat within the forests heart, enjoying the isolation away from Netherils business. The Netherese settlements of Algid, Earsome, Canlespiere, Trinity, and Dahla River City were scattered about the forest, mostly on the shores of Hidden Lake. These humans logged the forest, fished the lake, and mined the mountains, though any aggressive attempts at deforestation met with the intense ire of the local woodland beings, and so was kept to a minimum.
The forest proper was inhabited by fey such as pixies and sylphs, as well as several orc clans who warred on both the native fey and the Netherese settlers. The elves of Hoyden worked with the fey against the orcs, who decided to largely leave the elves alone and instead focus their efforts upon the humans of Earsome.
The settlement of Arisome in  led to a long, ongoing conflict with the native orcs, with aggressive bounty-hunting forcing the orcs deeper into the forests. The Netherese razed the orcish village of Shantraf in , but over the last century of Netherils history Earsome was razed twice, finally destroyed in the Earsome Massacre just three years before Karsuss Folly.
The Hidden Forest was still intact by , though greatly diminished by the wasteland overtaking Netheril. It continued to shrink over the next centuries until it was fully engulfed by the Anauroch desert, leaving the bare Hills of Scent and dry basin of the Shoal of Thirst.
