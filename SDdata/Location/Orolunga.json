        "mainbody": "Orolunga was a ruined city of ancient Chult that partially survived the ravages of time. As of the late 15 century DR, all that remained was a single ziggurat that was connected through time to the guardian naga, Saja Nbaza.\nThe ziggurat of Orolunga stood over 60-feet (18.3 meters) tall and had four distinct layers. Its facade was lined with numerous staircases, by which travelers could access its interior. Its exterior was decorated with symbols of Ubtao and by the , was entirely covered by tropical vegetation.\nLocated in the topmost chamber was an empty, barren shrine.\nThe ziggurat was enchanted in such a manner that no individual could traverse its exterior without climbing the stairs at its front. This enchantment was extremely powerful and described as \"mythic\".\nAfter the Death Curse was broken, the yuan-ti anathema Kress’voon led a sect of yuan-ti in an assault on Orolunga and slew Saja Nbaza. The yuan-ti then employed a beholder to carve out a tunnel to a lesser tomb beneath Orolunga as part of a plot to free Dendar the Night Serpent.\nThe ruined city was home to a number of chwinga spirits.\nSaja Nbaza lived in Orolunga hundreds of years before the Second Sundering. If a being entered the ziggurats shrine in the subsequent years, while carrying an orchid and the feather of a parrot, they could speak with Saja Nbaza as if they were alive during her time."
