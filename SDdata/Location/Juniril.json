        "mainbody": "'''Juniril''' (seen as \"Junirill\" on some maps{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}}) was a quiet fishing village in eastern [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "Juniril was a bland and boring town, where very little of interest seemed to happen. The main item of interest to travelers was the [[High Helm]] tavern, that was shaped like an enormous helm.",
        "Geography": "The village sat near the [[Hullack Trail]] on the southeast shore of [[Wyvernwater]], in the greater [[Wyvernshores]] area. Extensive bogs lay nearby, home to [[doppelganger]]s and [[mimic]]s.",
        "Government": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the village was administered by House [[Belorgan]]. At the time it was expected that [[Raedlar Belorgan]] would become the Earl of Juniril, though he died attempting to assassinate Princess [[Tanalasta]] in [[1369 DR]].\n\nAs of [[1486 DR]], the village was ruled by the elderly Lord [[Santedul]].",
        "Trade": "Juniril's folk mainly fished and wove rushes from the bogs or worked the local fruit farms. According to wider Cormyr, the primary export was boredom.",
        "Defenses": "Around the 1360s DR a small [[Purple Dragons]] detachment garrisoned the village, consisting of seven soldiers, most of whom were veteran women. They had a small barracks, stables, and jail, and typically defended the village from [[doppelganger]]s who lurked in the nearby bogs and raided the village.",
        "History": "Some centuries before the 14{{th}} century DR, Princess [[Kathla Obaryskyr]] was waylaid by brigands in Juniril. When she was dealt a mortal blow at the doors of [[Helm's Everpresent Shield]], she uttered a curse and the brigands were pierced with blades of energy, but kept alive indefinitely.\n\nJuniril was the site of a battle between King [[Galaghard]]'s armies and those of the [[Witch Lords]] in [[900 DR]].\n\nA book recounting Juniril's history was published around [[1327 DR]]; [[Phelos Marmwitz]] searched for ages and was pleased to get a copy of this \"splendid volume\" for his library in [[Ghars]] in [[Eleint]] of [[1367 DR]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Rain]] of [[1486 DR]], the village was almost completely isolated by flooding and raiders, with Lord Santedul's family and many of the local villagers sent away either to fight or to safety. On [[Eleint 28]], [[Havilar]], [[Mehen]], [[Kallan]], and [[Aubrin Crownsilver]] escorted Crown Prince [[Irvel Obarskyr]] to Juniril on their way to Suzail. They stayed briefly and met with Lord Santedul before moving on.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "* Locals regularly told tales of sightings of the cursed brigands who had slain Princess Kathla, though nobody claimed to have seen it themselves.\n* Around [[1369 DR]], baseless rumors in [[Suzail]] suggested that Juniril was home to a cell of [[Zhentarim]] spies.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Helm's Everpresent Shield]], a ruined temple of [[Helm]] where Princess Kathla was slain.\n* The [[High Helm]], a unique-looking tavern, inn, and festhall.",
        "Inhabitants": "* [[Iyrytharna Dantras]], a [[wizard]] who dwelt in a cottage near Juniril with her [[werepegasus]] husband [[Thorn (werepegasus)|Thorn]].\n* Lord [[Santedul]] dwelt in a manor with his family, including his daughter [[Ophira]]."
