        "mainbody": "uniril (seen as \"Junirill\" on some maps) was a quiet fishing village in eastern Cormyr.\nJuniril was a bland and boring town, where very little of interest seemed to happen. The main item of interest to travelers was the High Helm tavern, that was shaped like an enormous helm.\nThe village sat near the Hullack Trail on the southeast shore of Wyvernwater, in the greater Wyvernshores area. Extensive bogs lay nearby, home to doppelgangers and mimics.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the village was administered by House Belorgan. At the time it was expected that Raedlar Belorgan would become the Earl of Juniril, though he died attempting to assassinate Princess Tanalasta in 1369 DR.\nAs of 1486 DR, the village was ruled by the elderly Lord Santedul.\nJunirils folk mainly fished and wove rushes from the bogs or worked the local fruit farms. According to wider Cormyr, the primary export was boredom.\nAround the 1360s DR a small Purple Dragons detachment garrisoned the village, consisting of seven soldiers, most of whom were veteran women. They had a small barracks, stables, and jail, and typically defended the village from doppelgangers who lurked in the nearby bogs and raided the village.\nSome centuries before the 14 century DR, Princess Kathla Obaryskyr was waylaid by brigands in Juniril. When she was dealt a mortal blow at the doors of Helms Everpresent Shield, she uttered a curse and the brigands were pierced with blades of energy, but kept alive indefinitely.\nJuniril was the site of a battle between King Galaghards armies and those of the Witch Lords in 900 DR.\nA book recounting Junirils history was published around 1327 DR Phelos Marmwitz searched for ages and was pleased to get a copy of this \"splendid volume\" for his library in Ghars in Eleint of 1367 DR.\nDuring the Great Rain of 1486 DR, the village was almost completely isolated by flooding and raiders, with Lord Santeduls family and many of the local villagers sent away either to fight or to safety. On Eleint 28, Havilar, Mehen, Kallan, and Aubrin Crownsilver escorted Crown Prince Irvel Obarskyr to Juniril on their way to Suzail. They stayed briefly and met with Lord Santedul before moving on.\n* Locals regularly told tales of sightings of the cursed brigands who had slain Princess Kathla, though nobody claimed to have seen it themselves.\n* Around 1369 DR, baseless rumors in Suzail suggested that Juniril was home to a cell of Zhentarim spies.\n* Helms Everpresent Shield, a ruined temple of Helm where Princess Kathla was slain.\n* The High Helm, a unique-looking tavern, inn, and festhall.\n* Iyrytharna Dantras, a wizard who dwelt in a cottage near Juniril with her werepegasus husband Thorn.\n* Lord Santedul dwelt in a manor with his family, including his daughter Ophira."
