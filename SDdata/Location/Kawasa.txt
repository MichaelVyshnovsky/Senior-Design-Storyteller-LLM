'''Kawasa''' was a tiny farming community and one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].

==Description==
The people of Kawasa were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.

The village was surrounded by small [[rice]] fields. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops. Several of the ''minka'' were abandoned after raids on the village.

The little thorp had a population of only about 75 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.

==Geography==
Kawasa was located on the coast of the [[Sea of Patience]], where the Fochu Peninsula joined the mainland of [[Tsukishima]]. A trail led from the village west to [[Chiroi]].

==Trade==
Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Kawasa had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The people produced rice, but there is no evidence that they traded in it.

The people would allow travelers to spend the night in one of the abandoned ''minkas'' for free. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 [[yuan]] to sell.

==Defenses==
About 8 citizens of Kawasa served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.

==Religion==
Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Kawasa were not particularly religious.

==Notable Inhabitants==
[[Setsu Iki]], a powerful [[wu jen]], did not live in the village itself but kept a small home in the middle of a [[peach]] grove in a shallow valley some {{SI|5|miles|k|long=yes}} east of Kawasa.

==History==
Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Kawasa suffered especially severely from Za-Jikku's raids.
