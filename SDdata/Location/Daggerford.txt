'''Daggerford''' was a small but consequential town located in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] within the greater [[Sword Coast]]. While it was primarily a farming community, and considered by some to be a mere stopover, the town had great ambitions to grow and be seen as an alternative to their northern neighbor of [[Waterdeep]]. 

Despite its modest size and somewhat inflated sense of importance, Daggerford was resilient. It was something of a relic from the old kingdom of [[Delimbiyr]], too stubborn to fall even when a series of wars, crusades, and other conflicts threatened the entirety of the Sword Coast. Daggerford's coat-of-arms was a ''[[silver]] [[dagger]]'', covered in blood atop a field of dark blue.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
It was a walled settlement with a population that by and large lived in the outlying hamlets, farms, and estates, rather than within the town proper. As such, the streets of Daggerford were not densely populated.

Surrounding the town wall was a modest moat, with three crossing points at each of the town's three gates — the Farmer's Gate in the north, the Caravan Gate in the west, and the River Gate in the south.

Sitting atop a hill in the center of Daggerford was the grand [[Ducal Castle]], which was technically older than the town itself.

==Geography==
[[File:DelimbiyrVale.png|thumb|''Daggerford environs circa late 15{{th}} century DR.'']]
Throughout its storied history, Daggerford's dukes claimed the lands from as far away as the [[Floshin Estates]] to the north and [[Dragonspear Castle]] in the south. In truth, the duchy comprised the town proper and the surrounding farmsteads which numbered around a score. It was the largest settlement located between the metropolises of Waterdeep, 150 miles (241.4 km) to the north, and [[Baldur's Gate]] to the south.{{DagLoc}} 

There were a number of small but notable landmarks situated around Daggerford. The familial estate of [[Elorfindar Floshin|Sir Elorfindar Floshin]] was about two days away, and the home of his son [[Elorshin Floshin|Elorshin]] was approximately the same distance to the east. Near Elorshin's home was the temple known as the [[Mosque of Tyr]], which the younger [[gold elf|elf]] maintained. 

On a small hill near the town was an entrance to a nearby ''[[song path]]'', a network of ''[[portal|portals]]'' that were connected to works of oratorical art, such as songs and epic poems. The ''song path'' near Daggerford was referred to as the ''Voices of the Lost'', named for the [[Voices of the Lost|song]] that was required for its opening.

[[Gillian's Hill]], [[Liam's Hold]], and [[Black Helm Tower]] were each within a day's travel of Daggerford.

==Government==
Since its founding as part of the [[Phalorm|Kingdom of Phalorm]] around the {{YearlinkName|523}} by [[Tyndal|Tyndal "Daggerford"]], the town was governed by Dukes through Tyndal's family line until at least the end of the [[Second Sundering]].

Around the {{YearlinkName|1280}}, a town charter was granted by [[Conan Daggerford|Duke Conan]], leading to the creation of the anonymous ruling body known as the [[Council of Guilds]], modeled after the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lords of Waterdeep]]. The town was too small to maintain such secrecy, however, and it was well known that the local guildmasters served on the seats of the council.<ref group="note">[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier|The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier - Daggerford]] states this event occurs in [[1320 DR]].

===Dukes of Daggerford===
The first Duke of Daggerford was [[Rugyar]] the Just.

''Circa'' [[1270 DR]], the still young [[Edwin Daggerford]] was the Duke of Daggerford, until his death defending the city from the [[Baatezu]] [[Gorgomorz]]. His young son [[Conan Daggerford]] inherited the title.

In the mid–14{{th}} century, the town was ruled by [[Pryden Daggerford|Duke Pryden Daggerford]]. Unfortunately, the duke lost his life in the [[First Dragonspear War]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Pwyll Daggerford|Pwyll "Greatshout" Daggerford]], so named for his magically booming voice.

After Duke Pwyll's presumed death in [[1372 DR]], the city's leadership was taken over by a wealthy merchant member of the city council, [[Matagar Bugo]]. That brief change of power was a part of a [[Zhentarim]] plot to take over Daggerford. Matagar's reign ended when he was incinerated by the invading [[Gorgomorz]]. After the Zhentarim plot was thwarted and the city defended itself, Duke Pwyll, revealed to still be alive, and held hostage by the enemies of the city, returned to the throne.

Duke [[Maldwyn Daggerford]] received his title before the {{YearlinkName|1485}} as the tradition of primogeniture decreed that the title be passed to the eldest male child. It was the opinion of many in the town, however, that his elder sister, [[Morwen Daggerford|Lady Morwen]] would be more suited to the role. 

After the practice of primogeniture was suspended the [[1486 DR|following year]], Lady Morwen assumed the title of Duchess of Daggerford.

==Trade==
Due to its key location, Daggerford was a vital mercantile hub for its region of the Sword Coast. It was the site where goods moving on ships traversing the Delimbiyr River could be transferred to caravans journeying along the Trade Way or vice versa. The waterways of the Delimbiyr at Daggerford were too shallow for ships to continue upriver into the rest of the Delimbiyr Vale.

While people of Daggerford were largely self–sufficient,

The town of Daggerford emulated the grand, northern Metropolis of Waterdeep but its trade services were quite limited. While it attracted its fair share of travelers, prices for local wares were often significantly marked up. The Waterdhavian phrase ''"gone to Daggerford"'' referred to someone who was hiding out beyond Waterdeep's walls.

===Guilds===
After the establishment of guilds, each type of guild was maintained by a Guildmaster, even if it was only a single town representative, to ease trade between cities. They eventually formed into the Council of Guilds during the early 14{{th}} century, and many of them amalgamated into a fewer number of guilds by the 15{{th}} century.

The [[Mariners' Alliance]] served the town's many sailors, boatmen and other seafarers. In [[1372 DR]] they were involved in weapon smuggling with the Zhentarim..

==Defenses==
In addition to the Duke and his personal guard, Daggerford maintained a [[Daggerford militia|standing militia]]. It comprised the town's citizens who were healthy enough to serve, regardless of gender or race. Those who were not required to serve included those who were too young or too old, women who were pregnant, and women who were raising young children. As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the militia comprised only 50 individuals – which was one-tenth of the town's citizens.{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report}}

Newly–recruited militiamen were granted some training and given very rudimentary arms. Service was required three days out of every month and typically consisted of fairly light duties, unless the town was in immediate peril.

==History==
===Founding===
In [[133 DR]], on the precise spot of future Daggerford, the outlaw [[Artor Morlin]] built [[Morlin Castle]] and founded the Barony of [[Steeping Falls]]. The kingdom of [[Elembar]] was founded in the area in [[146 DR]] by folk from nearby [[Tavaray]], building the capital city of [[Delimbiyran (city)|Delimbiyran]] north of the river. Over the following centuries, power was concentrated there as Tavaray was abandoned in [[302 DR]] and [[Athalantar]] was destroyed by [[orc]]s in [[342 DR]], and the native [[Illuskan]]s were largely supplanted by north-migrating [[Tethyrian]]s. Steeping Falls was abandoned by [[403 DR]] due to the horrors emanating from Castle Morlin, and Elembar itself fell to an orc horde in [[511 DR]], though the capital survived and the kingdom was reformed under King [[Javilarhh Snowsword]] as [[Delimbiyran]].

Delimbiyran joined [[Phalorm]] in [[523 DR]] alongside [[Ardeep]] and [[Dardath]], forming a united and strong realm in the North. Unfortunately, the realm suffered terrible wars and disasters over the next century and dissolved in [[615 DR]], leaving Delimbiyran as the sole power in the region It was during this age that the area around what would be Daggerford became a duchy and grew significantly in power and influence. Though a vigorous and strong kingdom, Delimbiyran also proved short lived, collapsing into civil war in [[697 DR]] and breaking into numerous competing realms. [[Calandor]] held the lands around the capital city and the ruins of Morlin Castle, and managed to survive the centuries despite the capital city being destroyed by a magical disaster originating from [[Myth Drannor]] in [[714 DR]].

The town took its name from a 10{{th}} century legend about a boy named Tyndal who protected his family and their trade wagon while crossing the Delimbiyr River. Tyndal's family was assaulted by [[lizardfolk]] raiders, and he slew six of the beasts armed with only a [[dagger]]. While the story grew into myth over the course of the next few hundreds of years, records stated that fabled event did actually occur, at the site of the future Ducal Castle, in the {{YearlinkName|931}}. All of the subsequent Dukes of Daggerford claimed to be descended from Tyndal. 

Having earned fame in his youth and wealth as a merchant, Tyndal married [[Eleesa]], the daughter of the Duke of [[Calandor]] in the {{YearlinkName|945}}. Some [[947 DR|two years later]], the [[white dragon]] [[Cortulorrulagalargath]] came crashing to [[Toril]] after an aerial fight with the [[silver dragon]] [[Teskulladar]], and demolished the city of [[Delimbiyran (city)|Delimbiyran]], killing the Duke but sparing his daughter and his son-in-law Tyndal. The newly-risen Duke Tyndal relocated the seat of power from Delimbiyran and began construction of his Ducal Castle atop the remnants of [[Morlin Castle]]. Over the course of the next hundred years, the people of Daggerford began to build a proper town outside of the new castle.

During the mid–13{{th}} century, [[Derval Ironeater]] and the rest of [[Clan Ironeater]] moved into town and began rebuilding many of its wooden structures out of stone.

===14{{th}} Century===
[[File:Coalition.png|thumb|right|250px|The flag of Daggerford (right) with those of [[Waterdeep]] and the [[Flaming Fist]]]]

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1270}}, the [[Baatezu]] named [[Gorgomorz]] became the infamous "Daggerford's Devil", slaughtering countless innocents and aiming at Daggerford's destruction. Gorgomorz was banished by the young Duke [[Edwin Daggerford]]'s trap but he was gravely injured in battle and shortly passed.

The town of Daggerford was given sovereignty in the {{YearlinkName|1320}} by [[Conan Daggerford|Duke Conan Daggerford]]. He allowed for the formation of the [[Council of Guilds]], the ruling body that has governed the town ever since.

Daggerford was the site of a [[Battle of Daggerford|great battle]], when it was assaulted by the [[Hordes of Dragonspear (army)|hordes of fiends]] that poured out from [[Dragonspear Castle]] in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}. The town was defended and its assailants defeated by combined forces of elves, dwarves, and men. 

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Daggerford's army lent 50 of their soldiers, one-tenth of the town's population, to the [[Coalition|Coalition army]]. They fought under the command of [[Haither Stonehand|General Haither Stonehand]] who knew each of her soldiers personally.

Also around that time, [[lizardfolk]] under the command of a lich named [[Redeye]] began extorting [[Pwyll Daggerford|Duke Pwyll]] the sum of tens of thousands of [[gold piece]]s. The duke in turn hired several adventuring companies to remove the threat to the duchy.

Sometime in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a group of [[troll]]s began to infest Daggerford's sewer system.

[[Derval Ironeater]] claimed the city of Daggerford had no skilled [[tattoo]]ists within its walls as around this time in its history.

In {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Duke Pwyll Daggerford seeming perished during a hunt, gored by a wild beast. Daggerford mourned the death of the city's leader even though many found his death's circumstances highly suspicious. Shortly after, a wealthy merchant and a member of the city council [[Matagar Bugo]] proclaimed himself the new Duke. His great mercantile aspirations of turning Daggerford into a trading juggernaut to rival [[Waterdeep]] encountered unfortunate circumstances of bandits ambushing trade caravans in the middle of the day, secretly Zhentarim agents, [[orc]] forces supplied with weapon shipments that passed through Daggerford. The city militia's investigation bore no success. 

Eventually, [[Astriel Shalyn]], an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]], a traveling adventurer, and their companions [[Purfbin Doogrick]] and [[Raegen Brunegar]] involved themselves to untangle the schemes and plots surrounding these events. Their investigation uncovered the Zhentarim forces entering a dark alliance with the infamous baatezu [[Gorgomorz]] and the [[tanarukk]] of [[Dragonspear Castle]]. The Zhentarim planted the puppet ruler Bugo to take over Daggerford, while Gorgomorz sought to destroy the town. 

Zhentarim planned on betraying Gorgomorz. Once the devil's orcs invaded Daggerford, Zhentarim would lead Matagar's griffon mercenaries to defeat the invaders, imprison Gorgomorz inside a magical orb, and leave Matagar Bugo as a puppet ruler with the full support of the citizens and the Lords' Alliance.

Astriel's adventurers tracked the Duke and [[Bronwyn Daggerford|his sister Bronwyn]] to [[Illefarn]], where they being kept under guard by the [[Griffons Mercenary Company]]. Pwyll and Bronwyn Daggerford were freed, and Astriel with her adventurers took a stand against Gorgomorz. In the end, they slew the devil, and returned Duke Pwyll back to the throne of Daggerford.

===15{{th}} Century===
At some point prior to the [[Second Sundering]], the duchy of Daggerford entered into the [[Lords' Alliance]].

Around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke Maldwyn]] became involved with a woman named [[Natyssa]]. She was in fact a [[succubus]] called [[Pencheska]] working for [[Tarul Var]] of [[Thay]], both of whom sought the duke's death. The duke himself became possessed by the spirit of [[Baazka]], the [[pit fiend]] who orchestrated the [[Second Dragonspear War]] a century before. 

The succubus and the spirit of the pit fiend attempted to murder Duke Maldwyn and incriminate a group of adventurers. While it was unknown how the conflict between the groups actually played out, Pencheska was able to imprison the duke's sister Lady Morwen in [[Cromm's Hold]], assume her likeness, and succeed her "brother" as Daggerford's new duchess. By the time the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] was broken, when the region was being assaulted by [[giant]]s, she had brokered an agreement with the [[Zhentarim]] to ensure the "safety" of her people.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, "Lady Morwen" was still serving as the town's duchess. It was unknown if the individual was the real duchess or still the succubus Pencheska posing as her. Around this time, the "duchess" sent a recently formed adventurers group to search for [[Christos Tellum]], the noble heir to [[Tellum's Hold]]. The nobleman and his party went missing in the [[Dessarin Valley]] after some recent forest fires. The young nobleman was soon delivered to the "duchess" along with the mysterious ''magical flask'' he had set out to recover. 

After the ''flask'' was brought into the town, Daggerford was briefly plagued by a [[vampire]], [[Dar Lavien]] who unleashed the undead on the population. Dar Lavien was slain by the same adventuring group sent to recover Tellum. 

The "duchess" used the adventurers to recover the ''[[Ambergul Blade]]'' under the pretense that its magic was needed to restore Christos Tellum's health. The blade wound up in the hands of the [[rakshasa]] [[Nadir]], who utilized a [[slaad]]i portal to once again throw Daggerford into chaos. In the ensuing mayhem, the ''Ambergul Blade'' was used to uncork the mysterious ''magical flask'', releasing an ancient [[red dragon]] called [[Karrnsyrrl]]. The dragon caused significant damage to Daggerford but departed shortly thereafter, along with Nadir and the young Christos.

==Rumors & Legends==
The ballad ''[[Peredus the Great]]'', written about a local caravan guard named [[Peredus]], was quite popular in the Daggerford area of the Sword Coast.

==Notable Locations==
Despite its rather small size and modest population, Daggerford was divided into four different quarters:

===Landmarks===
; [[Ducal Castle]]: The centerpiece of Daggerford was its long-standing castle, that had served the dukes of Daggerford since the age of Tyndal. The Ducal Castle had a secret passage into the city, constructed by the Castle's dwarven builders. In 1372 DR it was used by [[Gorgomorz]]' forces to infiltrate Daggerford.

; [[Morninglow Tower]]: Though it was previously dedicated to [[Lathander]], this beautifully-built temple later became a holy house of the revived [[deity]] [[Amaunator]].

; Marketplace: Local grocers, farmers, and other merchants congregated within the town's open market twice a [[tenday]] in order to sell their goods.

; Drill fields: This wide-open area

; Caravan Grounds: This area was used to house the carts and wagons of those merchants and caravaneers who came to town for business. All manner of folks could be found among the drivers and caravan guards as they hailed from realms all across the Sword Coast.

; Tannery: When Daggerford was inflicted with sickness during the mid–15{{th}} century [[DR]], the citizens blamed the local guild of tanners and forced them to relocate the tannery outside of town, on the opposite side of the Trade Way.

===Town Quarters===
; [[River Quarter]]: This area of the town held the city's docks and served those whose jobs revolved around ships and sea trade. Dockworkers unloaded cargo from ships that were bound for transport along the Trade Way, while some skippers and rivermen transported people down the Delimbiyr River to [[Secomber]] and the surrounding settlements. Some of the landmarks within the River Quarter included the town's jail and constabulary,stables, and the militia's barracks; and next to the quarter, the massive [[Sullerton Shipbuilders]].

; [[Caravan Quarter]]: Catering to those individuals passing through town on trade business, this area of Daggerford comprised several shops and businesses, guildhalls, as well as a number of boarding houses. As such, it was nearly devoid of activity during the winter months, when caravan travel all but ceased. Notable locations included the grand [[Lady Luck Tavern]], [[Miller's Dry Goods]], and [[Fairfortune Hall]].

; [[Farmers' Quarter]]: As the name suggested, many farmers and other folks that lived off the land made their home within this part of Daggerford. Animal pens and small livestock paddocks were a common sight throughout its streets. [[Cromach's Smithy]], and the [[Harvest House]], the local temple to [[Chauntea]].

; [[Money Quarter]]: Easily the most affluent region of town, this quarter comprised grand buildings that were built nearest to the ducal castle. and a number of private residences.

==Inhabitants==
Due to its grand ambitions and rather one-sided rivalry with Waterdeep, Daggerford was able to attract scores of skilled craftsmen and artisans. Nearly everyone in Daggerford knew one another and outsiders were readily welcomed, especially if they were looking to patronize the town's businesses.
