The town of Red Larch was a waystop on the Long Road seven days north of Waterdeep,
The town was located atop a low ridge along the western edge of the Dessarin Valley.
Red Larch was known for its nourishing, though otherwise non-noteworthy food, called crumblecake. Crumblecakes were made into moist loaves from nuts, chickpea mash, chopped roots and greens, turkey and wildfowl scraps, all baked together.
Around the , the town had a militia of around 100 skilled archers, mostly younger boys, who trained by keeping predators away from the poultry farm, Mhandyvvers Poultry. This led raiding parties amongst the orcs to avoid the town.
The town was named after a small forest stand of red larches that extended along the ridge. The trees, however, were felled by the first settlers in the region, who chose that particular location thanks to a natural water spring that fed into a small pond that could serve as drinking water for burden animals.
