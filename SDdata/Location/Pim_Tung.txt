'''Pim Tung''' was a town in [[Tabot]].

==Geography==
It lay in southern Tabot, along the river and the road between [[Pabex]] and the twin cities of [[Motra]] and [[Joya]], with forest in the south and the plains to the north. 

==Government==
The effective ruler of Pim Tung around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}} was Lady [[Holang]], the favorite wife of Baron [[Mukow Jian]], who, had no actual political power under Tabotan law. The local dzong-pon (sheriff or district official) was her puppet, while the warriors of Pim Tung were her men. 

The sign of Pim Tung was a burning arrow, which marked the representatives of the town.

==Defenses==
The warriors of Pim Tung were adorned with the burning arrow and tied their scabbards to their belts with a distinctive red cord. Holang's men were common in Motra and Joya and bluntly interrogated anyone who passed through Pim Tung's lands.
