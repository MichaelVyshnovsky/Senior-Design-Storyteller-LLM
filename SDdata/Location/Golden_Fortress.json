        "mainbody": "The '''Golden Fortress''' was a large fortified military base and academy in [[Eshpurta]] that housed and trained the [[Council Army]] of [[Amn]].",
        "Description": "The academy was made up a large central structure with a number of smaller outbuildings. A large wall surrounded the entire complex, running down to the banks of the nearby river.",
        "Geography": "The Golden Fortress was located just outside of Eshpurta next to the [[Eshpurta Road]], on the opposite side of [[Trifin Creek]] as it joined the [[River Rimril]].{{Cite interactive atlas|4130 Eshpurta}}{{Amstel sources}}",
        "Activities": "The Golden Fortress was the primary training ground for the Council Army's recruits, and the command center for all military operations in eastern Amn. The wide plains between the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]] and [[Snowflake Mountains]] were considered a likely route for outside invasions, and so Eshpurta was turned into a heavily militarized garrison city.\n\nBefitting its martial inhabitants, the Fortress contained chapels to [[Helm]], [[Tyr]], [[Torm]], and [[Tempus]]. During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] they were all overseen by Shield Brother [[Benitus]], a venerable [[priest]] of Helm assisted by younger priests of many faiths.",
        "Defenses": "Between the Golden Fortress and Eshpurta, the local Council Army forces were made up of 18,000 soldiers and 6,300 officers, as well as 3,000 trainees and 700 military instructors, craftsmen, and other support staff.\n\nThe officers of the Fortress kept an eye on predatory businesses that could harm the welfare of their soldiers in Eshpurta. If a particular enterprise in the city such as a loan-shark or gambling den proved exceptionally troublesome, the problem was usually resolved by an unfortunate accident during [[catapult]] drills that destroyed the establishment.",
        "Inhabitants": "* Commander [[Balacer Macefist]].\n* Shield Brother [[Benitus]].\n* [[Ard Roton]], Swanmantle of the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn]] in Eshpurta."
