        "mainbody": "The Golden Fortress was a large fortified military base and academy in Eshpurta that housed and trained the Council Army of Amn.\nThe academy was made up a large central structure with a number of smaller outbuildings. A large wall surrounded the entire complex, running down to the banks of the nearby river.\nThe Golden Fortress was located just outside of Eshpurta next to the Eshpurta Road, on the opposite side of Trifin Creek as it joined the River Rimril.\nThe Golden Fortress was the primary training ground for the Council Armys recruits, and the command center for all military operations in eastern Amn. The wide plains between the Troll Mountains and Snowflake Mountains were considered a likely route for outside invasions, and so Eshpurta was turned into a heavily militarized garrison city.\nBefitting its martial inhabitants, the Fortress contained chapels to Helm, Tyr, Torm, and Tempus. During the mid-to-late 14 century DR they were all overseen by Shield Brother Benitus, a venerable priest of Helm assisted by younger priests of many faiths.\nBetween the Golden Fortress and Eshpurta, the local Council Army forces were made up of 18,000 soldiers and 6,300 officers, as well as 3,000 trainees and 700 military instructors, craftsmen, and other support staff.\nThe officers of the Fortress kept an eye on predatory businesses that could harm the welfare of their soldiers in Eshpurta. If a particular enterprise in the city such as a loan-shark or gambling den proved exceptionally troublesome, the problem was usually resolved by an unfortunate accident during catapult drills that destroyed the establishment.\n* Commander Balacer Macefist.\n* Shield Brother Benitus.\n* Ard Roton, Swanmantle of the Heralds of Faer√ªn in Eshpurta."
