        "Description": "The [[Dreadmont]] and [[Skyfire]] mountains lay to the north and south. The east of the pass was within sight of the [[River Surbrin]]. It was shrouded in fog in parts, and there was little grass. There were tunnels and caverns at various places in the pass, some of which were natural and others that were carved out by the dwarves.",
        "History": "The [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] [[Fitzmilliyun Sparkledrim]] built his [[Castle of Illusion]] in the Pass during the height of [[Ascalhorn]]'s power. A century after his death, orcs overran its defenders.<ref>\n\nIt was thought that the ghosts were those of the [[orc]]s and [[Delzoun]] [[dwarves]] slain in the [[Battle of Fell Pass]]. However, it was discovered by a scouting party led by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] (much to his displeasure) that what actually lay beneath the pass was the ruins of [[Baffenburg]].<ref>",
