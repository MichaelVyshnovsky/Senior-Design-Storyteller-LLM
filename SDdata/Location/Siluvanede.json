        "mainbody": "'''Siluvanede''' was a realm of ''Ar-tel-quessir''—[[sun elves]] or [[gold elves]]—lying in the northwestern [[High Forest]], from ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-8400}} to its fall in [[882 DR]]. It aspired to the heights of [[Aryvandaar]] before it, but also repeated its crimes, falling prey to arrogance and ambition, dark magic and the demonic taint of the [[fey'ri]]. Once an independent realm, it lost the [[Seven Citadels' War]] and became a vassal of [[Eaerlann]].",
        "History": {
            "The Founding Time": "Following the end of the [[Fifth Crown War]] and the fall of the elf realm of [[Aryvandaar]] ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-9000}}, the elves abandoned the [[High Forest]] for some six centuries. The Siluvanedenn soon desired to reclaim the exalted heights achieved by Aryvandaar.\n\nHowever, the realm's [[moon elf]] minority and some disaffected sun elves came to reject the elitism and unbearable arrogance of the Siluvanedenn nobles, and left the realm. They joined with a greater number of moon elves, who were migrating away from overcrowding in [[Evereska]], and founded the neighboring realm of [[Sharrven]] in the southern reaches of the High Forest ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-7600}}. Unlike Siluvanede, Sharrven was a mixed-race and more tolerant realm.\n\n''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-5300}}, the Siluvanedenn elves established a ''[[mythal]]'' within the city of Adofhaeranede. They rechristened the city [[Myth Adofhaer]].\n\nThe rot set in when, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-5000}}, the noble but [[half-fiend]] sun elf [[House Dlardrageth]] of the elven realms of the forest of [[Arcorar]] escaped to Siluvanede.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Monsters of Faerûn]]'', page 73, and ''[[Races of Faerûn]]'', page 118, say \"three minor\" or \"lesser\" noble houses were corrupted by House Dlardrageth, but ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]'', page 84, says \"several powerful\" houses were \"subverted\", which ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' page 26 repeats. These appear contradictory, but 'subvert' has multiple possible meanings, such as to overthrow or to undermine, not just to pervert or corrupt. Taken together, it appears that three minor houses were corrupted to produce fey'ri, while several more powerful houses were subverted, whether weakened, corrupted in other ways, or overthrown.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Cloak & Dagger]]'', page 91, says crossbreeding with demons had begun to produce offspring before the war, but flourished during it. ''Races of Faerûn'' says crossbreeding with demons began after Siluvanede's defeat to Sharrven and Eaerlann, presumably after an early skirmish of the Seven Citadels War, or after the war's end. However, later sources, namely ''Lost Empires of Faerûn'', page 84, and ''The Grand History of the Realms'', page 26, state it began before the war, c. −4800 DR, and corrupted houses were already led by fey'ri at the beginning of the war. The later case is assumed here. In any case, it is a multi-generation project occurring over centuries, so no fixed date is likely.\n\nSiluvanede's rise to power and descent towards evil did not go unnoticed or unopposed, however. The leaders of Evereska and Sharrven elected to act while they still could to try to stop Siluvanede from repeating the mistakes of Aryvandaar and curb its ambition and mounting might. To bar the Siluvanedenn from reclaiming the heartland of old Aryvandaar, young nobles of Sharrven went out and did it instead. Among Aryvandaar's ruins in the center of its rule in the northern reaches of the High Forest, they founded the kingdom of [[Eaerlann]] ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-4700}}. More open, they sought an alliance with the dwarves of the [[North]]. The Dlardrageths soon fomented war against the new realm of Eaerlann.",
            "The Seven Citadels' War": "''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-4500}}, Arcorar's [[Elven high mage|High Mages]] located the Dlardrageths' secret lair under [[Ascal's Horn]]. Helped by Eaerlanni forces, they attacked, killing four and imprisoning the remaining three, including Countess [[Sarya Dlardrageth]]. This assault against a once-great noble house, no matter how debased and vestigial, was viewed as overly harsh by their supporters. Although their masters were gone, the Dlardrageth–influenced Siluvanedenn noble houses quickly retaliated.\n\nOver the next two centuries, in a series of conflicts collectively known as the [[Seven Citadels' War]] or sometimes the [[Sixth Crown War]], a number of skirmishes were fought between the elite Siluvanedenn forces and the still-fledging Eaerlanni forces, who had support from Sharrven. In the initial skirmishes, the Siluvanedenn suffered heavy losses to the Eaerlanni. The elven realms of Arcorar were also dragged into the war and many elves were slain.\n\nHowever, in {{Yearlink|-4440}}, following past hints from the Dlardrageths, the Siluvanedenn fey'ri houses, pressed hard by the Eaerlanni and hoping to turn the tide of the war, opened four of five Dlardrageth strongholds in the former lands of Aryvandaar. In them, beyond the bound guardian demons, they found ancient [[House Vyshaan|Vyshaantar]] weapons and magic artifacts, with which they equipped their warriors. This development brought Sharrven fully into the conflict. In the following battles, the Siluvanedenn were often victorious.\n\nNow Sharrven applied its full might against Siluvanede, fielding elven [[dragon]]-riders and superior magical firepower, finally overcoming and even humbling the Siluvanedenn. In the final battle, Siluvanedenn forces emerging from the fifth armory gambled and fought a desperate but losing battle. With the end of the Seven Citadels' War ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-4300}}, Eaerlann forcibly annexed Siluvanede and made it a vassal realm.\n\nIn the aftermath, the deceits of the fey'ri were soon uncovered. Eager to avoid any association with the fey'ri, untainted Siluvanedenn High Mages placed themselves and the entire city of Myth Adofhaer in a magical stasis, so they might escape through time to the distant future. The majority of surviving fey'ri warriors were rounded up and imprisoned in the fifth armory, thereafter called the [[Nameless Dungeon]]. However, some evaded arrest and would eventually give rise to long-lived fey'ri houses that successfully hid their heritage. Three houses secretly behind the opening of the Dlardrageth armories hid in those same places, and plotted to regain their might. These Siluvanedenn exiles resumed the demon-crossbreeding plan. After centuries, they became a clan of fey'ri.",
            "A Vassal Realm": "With Siluvanede forcibly subdued as a vassal realm, Eaerlann introduced a period of peace and prosperity that lasted some five millennia. It remained a racially exclusive sun elf realm, however.\n\nHowever, the Siluvanedenn fey'ri who had survived the fall of the realm would have their revenge. Working in secrecy, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-2770}}, they opened a number of ''[[portal]]s'' simultaneously across the lands of Sharrven, unleashing hordes of marauding monsters upon the unsuspecting elves, in an event known as the [[Slaughter of Sharrven]]. The elf realm fragmented and collapsed before any help could come. Survivors of Sharrven escaped to Eaerlann and Evereska, leaving the old realm empty bar a few outposts and settlements. In the aftermath, the dwarf King [[Connar IV]] of [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] slew many of the monsters, including the [[red dragon|red]] [[dragon aging|wyrm]] [[Rithaerosurffel]], the Bane of Sharrven. Afterward, without evidence, the paranoid Siluvanedenn elves swiftly laid the blame on the [[wizard]]s of [[Netheril]], and swore to kill any [[Netherese]] wizard that trespassed in their land. History would only attribute the slaughter to an inexplicable explosion in the populations of monsters in the southern High Forest.\n\nIn the [[-111 DR|Year of Terrible Anger, −111 DR]], immense hordes of [[orc]]s poured out of [[Spine of the World]] and [[Ice Mountains]] and into the North, in a great war called the [[Orc Marches]]. They devastated everything in their path, and were not stopped until the elves of Siluvanede, Eaerlann, [[Iliyanbruen]], and [[Rilithar]] allied against them. They halted their advance south, before they could enter the High Forest and [[Dessarin Valley]], and broke their strength.\n\nSiluvanede was recorded as a contemporary of the human kingdom of [[Athalantar]] ([[183 DR|183]]–[[342 DR]]).{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|34-35}} At the time, Siluvanede neighbored the human-occupied [[Mlembryn lands]], which extended from the western fringes of Siluvanede. In the [[224 DR|Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR]], the forces of Athalantar employed used magic to burn forests and slaughter elves across [[the North|the Northlands]], even destroying the [[Halangorn Forest]], in an effort to expand their kingdom and farmlands.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|33,37}} Investigating these attacks, the adventuress [[Myrjala]] claimed to be a good friend of the Aeltagarr of Siluvanede and to have seen these events in her [[scrying]] pool. However, the Aeltagarr had not recognized the mage responsible. In a meeting at [[Morlin Castle]] hosted by Lord [[Breiyr]], Myrjala, in magical disguise as the Herald of [[Tavaray]] known as Huntinghorn, reported this information to Highlord [[Falaeve]] of Siluvanede, who was strangely dubious and dismissive and tried covertly casting a spell. Ultimately, Axelord [[Arthlach]] of Ammarindar slew Falaeve, who was revealed to actually be Mage Royal [[Ubriien Orlyn]] of Athalantar in disguise, doubtless the one responsible for the attacks.<ref group=\"note\">It's not clear how, or even if, Siluvanede was affected by these attacks, as it seems too far away. They are included here as context for Ubriien posing as the Highlord.\n\nFinally, in the [[880 DR|Year of Unfettered Secrets, 880 DR]], fey'ri aided some wizards in summoning demons to counter the devils that plagued the Eaerlanni citadel of [[Ascalhorn]]. However, Eaerlanni agents in Ascalhorn had discovered these fey'ri and, in the final months of their realm, imprisoned their foes in several secret Dlardrageth armories in the northern High Forest. However, the agents died, leaving no record.<ref group=\"note\">Although Siluvanede is undoubtedly long gone by the 14{{th}} century DR, no source yet found mentions how it fell. The demons of Hellgate Keep are confirmed to have caused the collapse of many realms in the area at this time, including Eaerlann, to which Siluvanede was a vassal. However, the only source to discuss this in connection with Siluvanede (''Lost Empires of Faerûn'' page 92) only says that Lothen was spared. Lothen is the only known city of Siluvanede remaining at the time, so it is possible that Siluvanede was entirely spared the destruction (perhaps aided by the leading fey'ri houses who'd instigated it). However, the apparent intention is that Siluvanede is included with Eaerlann and fell alongside it. This is the case assumed here. In any case, the table of historical eras in ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]'', page 186, confirms Siluvanede fell this year.",
            "Legacy": "Myth Adofhaer was remembered in a number of old [[Elven language]] songs.\n\nLord [[Elorfindar Floshin]] was ashamed for the crimes of his ancestors and in penance elected to defend the ''portals'' in the [[House of Long Silences]] in the [[Ardeep Forest]]. He had done this for eight centuries by the mid–14{{th}} century DR, even though House Floshin's part in spawning the fey'ri was largely forgotten.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Hellgate Keep in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], the remaining half-fiend Dlardrageths were freed. Breaking the magical seals on their ancient armories, they were surprised to discover the fey'ri descendants of their Siluvanedenn allies imprisoned inside. They formed a new unholy alliance under Countess Sarya Dlardrageth, and spread to renew their schemes and threaten the North. The fey'ri soon began searching the western High Forest for the ruins and remnants of Siluvanede. In the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], on [[Alturiak 16]], Sarya used the [[Gatekeeper Crystal]] to liberate the Siluvanedenn fey'ri from the Nameless Dungeon, adding them to her ranks of Daemonfey, and went on to threaten the High Forest, Evereska, and [[Myth Drannor]].\n\t\nIn the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], a tower in the ruins of Siluvanede had recently been discovered. [[Meraera]], a sun elf wizard and [[Olin Gisir]] studying in and around [[Silverymoon]], heard of this and quickly tried to assemble adventurers to support her in an expedition to the ruins. At around that time, a tome discussing the causes of Myth Adofhaer's exile and conditions for its restoration was rumored to have been found in a lost Eaerlanni library. The [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], an elf supremacist organization who shared the Siluvanedenn's attitudes, hunted for this tome."
        },
        "Geography": "Siluvanede stood proud amidst the northwestern reaches of the High Forest, north of the [[Star Mounts]]. These lands comprised the former frontier and agricultural lands of the realm of Aryvandaar, but did not include its ruling heartland, which had been in the northern reaches. Its lands also included the [[Silverwood]].",
        "Government": "In the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]], Siluvanede was ruled by a \"Highlord\". Around [[224 DR]], this was Highlord [[Falaeve]]. The most senior [[sorceress]] of the realm was the [[Aeltagarr]], at the time a kindly and revered seer.\n\nThe realm's sigil was a [[silver]] [[griffon]].\n\nThe noble elven houses present in Siluvanede included:\n* [[House Aelorothi]], who produced a branch of fey'ri\n* [[House Dlardrageth]], the daemonfey\n* [[House Ealoeth]], who produced a branch of fey'ri\n* [[House Floshin]], who produced a branch of fey'ri.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5}}\n* [[House Hyshaanth]]\nEach house had their own colors, which later fey'ri under the Dlardrageths tried to incorporate into their clothing.",
        "Culture & Society": "The Siluvanedenn elves were known to be haughty, more so than any other elven realm,\n\nNo visitors of any other race were welcome in the realm, not even \"lesser\" races of elves, even as late as the 3{{rd}} century DR. The Highlord made this point crystal clear to all. The only place where other races were accepted was at the city of [[Lothen of the Silver Spires|Lothen]], on the southwestern edge. People of all races came here to consult the Aeltagarr.\n\nSiluvanedenn architecture favored bright colors and long, graceful structures made of stone. Thus their cities bristled with lofty towers and narrow spires built of brick and stone, all in bright hues. Every street seemed to be lined with splendid manors and every boulevard to arrive at a park or garden. In these, artisans worked with wood, stone, and [[magic]] to fashion objects of art.\n\nHowever, this beauty concealed corruption and darkness. When Siluvanede was founded, the [[Elven Court]]'s punishment of [[House Vyshaan]] of Aryvandaar and the Descent of the [[drow]] were still remembered by many sun elves. Fearful of the elven gods, the early Siluvanedenn incorporated their sentiments into their new realm, banning temples and outlawing priests of the [[Seldarine]]. Siluvanedenn grew not god-fearing, but godless. This left them open to corruption, such as to House Dlardrageth and the demonic taint of the fey'ri. As a growing number of Siluvanedenn came under the sway of House Dlardrageth, more and more repeated the misdeeds of their Vyshaanti predecessors.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]'', page 21, has [[Meraera]] explore a temple to the [[demon lord]] [[Astaroth]] and also seek a tower in the ruins of Siluvanede. It is unclear if the temple to Astaroth was found within the Siluvanedenn ruins, though this is likely given Meraera's interests and that realm's history.\n\nNevertheless, some Siluvanedenn followed the gods, though not perhaps in Siluvanede itself. For example, [[Susklahava Orbryn]], [[Roanmara Neirdre]], and [[Phantyni Evanara]], known together as the Timespinners, were priestesses of [[Labelas Enoreth]] at the [[Temple Beyond Time]] in the Eaerlanni city of [[Mhiilamniir]], a position they held for thousands of years as undead [[baelnorn]].",
        "Magic": "At the height of their power, the sun elves of Siluvanede created the ''[[golden orb of Siluvanede|golden orbs of Siluvanede]]'', [[item enchantment|enchanted]] spheres of pure [[gold]] that protected against magical attack. So costly were they that each of the noble houses owned only one, which was traditionally borne by the eldest member.",
        "Notable Locations": "The greatest cities of Siluvanede were:\n* [[Myth Adofhaer]], where a ''mythal'' was erected.\n* [[Lothen of the Silver Spires|Lothen, City of the Silver Spires]], a center of study;\n* [[Telardon|Telardon, the City of Emerald Spires]], known for its unusual magical artifacts."
