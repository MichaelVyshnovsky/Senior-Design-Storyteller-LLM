}}'''Suzail''' ({{Pronounce|soo|ZALE|refs=}}) was the capital of [[Cormyr]] and the seat of power. It was named after [[Suzara Obarskyr]], the mother of the first king. It was originally the farm of [[Ondeth Obarskyr]], the father of the first king. Suzail was a large port city on the shores of lake [[Dragonmere]]. The capital had a direct link to [[Waterdeep]] via the ''[[Waterdeep portal]]''.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|688}}

==Government==
Suzail was the capital of Cormyr and the home of the ruling [[Obarskyr]] family. King [[Foril Obarskyr I|Foril Obarskyr]] delegated much of the day-to-day tasks of running Cormyr to his Lord Magister [[Edwin Morahan]] who was responsible for keeping the peace, maintaining city services and collecting taxes. The Lord Magister was assisted by a herald who handled the paperwork necessary to run the city.

==Military==
The landward side of Suzail was protected by an 80 ft. (24 Meter) wall. The city was further protected by the Citadel of the Purple Dragons as well as three gates which were essentially castles themselves.

Two thousand [[Purple Dragons]] were garrisoned in the city and over one hundred [[War Wizards]] resided within the walls. After the [[Spellplague]], most of the Imperial Navy was relocated to Suzail's harbor.

==Economy==
[[File:HighGuildsSuzail.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Merchants of the High Guilds of Suzail]]
Suzail was one of two Cormyrean ports and a huge variety of trade goods flowed through the city. Suzail primarily exported [[copper]] bars and grain and imported luxury goods such as spices, silk, and citrus fruit. Trade was dominated by merchant families and trading companies such as the [[Seven Suns|Seven Suns Trading Coster]], [[Trueshield Trading Priakos]] and the [[Glanend]] and
[[Skatterhawk]] families.

The city had a large number of trade [[guild]]s who took pride in their craftsmanship. The city was known for producing musical instruments, cloth, garments and swords, and armor. As of [[1479 DR]], the shipbuilding business, which had moved to [[Marsember]], was beginning to make a comeback.

Animal pelts from the [[Thunder Peaks]] and the [[Storm Horns]] did very good business in Suzail as of 1368 DR.

==Religion==
Suzail boasted two large temples, one of [[Tymora]] and one dedicated to [[Oghma]]. In addition to the temples, there were shrines dedicated to the [[exarch]] of joy [[Lliira]], the beastlord [[Malar]], the god of war [[Tempus]] and the exarch of [[bard]]s [[Milil]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}

==History==
{{Fq|width=310px|text=Peace? Idyllic summer days of sun, bright hope, and plenty? It's a pity, but most folk can find those only in their memories—never in the passing days as they live them. Myself, I'm generally too busy even to store away memories.|source=[[Aglasz Jhavildar]], Sage of Suzail, ''Lyres, Harps, and Horns: Sixty Years at Court, in Suzail and Elsewhere''{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|95}}}}Suzail began as a farmstead in [[6 DR]] when [[Ondeth Obarskyr]] and his immediate family settled there. Others soon joined the new settlement and by [[16 DR]] the population had grown to 350, having become a port a year earlier with the construction of the first dock.

Between [[376 DR]] and [[432 DR]], Suzail was affected by a plague brought from the merchants of [[Marsember]], and many people died, despite the efforts of the priests. Once the priests had almost exhausted their healing spells, they reserved them for their own use and were consequently slaughtered by the peoples of Suzail. Only priests of [[Talona]] survived, but they merely further spread the plague.

Around [[429 DR]], Suzail was sold to [[Magrath the Minotaur]], a pirate lord, for 500 sacks of gold, by [[Melineth Turcassan]], father-in-law to King [[Duar Obarskyr]], who was away fighting [[orc]]s at the time. The city's treasury was plundered and Magrath assumed its rule. Magrath was later defeated by King Duar and the city returned to normal.

In [[1018 DR]], much of Suzail was set ablaze by three [[red dragon]]s. The docks and the lower wards were worst affected because of their wooden construction. The garrison of the city were able to defeat all three dragons, but [[Thauglor]] soon arrived, demolishing part of [[Castle Obarskyr]] and setting it on fire. In all, half of Suzail was destroyed in the attack and a third of its population was wiped out, in addition to extensive damage to the castle.

==Places of Interest==
{{quote|''One sees the city's walls as one approaches, but there is no understanding them from a distance. It's only as one gets close, and they loom higher, and higher, and higher, that one appreciates the majesty of Suzail. I passed through gates the size of castles to enter this magnificent city. Its port is filled with ships from across the Sea of Fallen Stars, carrying goods from lands I only knew from legends. The docks overflow with fruit, spices, silks and animal pelts. You will not see a finer market, if you have the golden lions to spend.''|Excerpt from ''[[The Approachable East]]''}}
