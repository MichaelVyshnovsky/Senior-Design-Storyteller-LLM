        "mainbody": "astmyr was a district of Menzoberranzan that was primarily home to commoners.\nMost commoners, including mercenaries and lesser merchants, lived in this neighborhood. While better than the Braeryn district, Eastmyr was still where you would find many poor and outlaw drow and non-drow of no discernible means.\n* House Hunzrin The house of the citys primary agricultural family.\n* House Kenafin\n* Narbondels Shadow A good but inexpensive inn along the northern cavern wall near the Braeryn. Narbondels Shadow was run in 1370 DR by Nicholas Tindall, a retired human adventurer who was stranded in Menzoberranzan due to an angry deep dragon. Tindall had good contacts with the citys merchants and shared them with visitors due to his kindhearted, though cynical, nature.\n* Symeeras Symeeras was a fine inn run in 1370 DR by Symeera of Neverwinter, a mage of the Many-Starred Cloak guild of Neverwinter, who was stranded in the Underdark two decades previously. Symeera is also well-connected with the citys merchants."
