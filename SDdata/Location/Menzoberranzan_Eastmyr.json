        "Inhabitants": "Most commoners, including mercenaries and lesser merchants, lived in this neighborhood. While better than the [[Braeryn]] district, Eastmyr was still where you would find many poor and outlaw drow and non-drow of no discernible means.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[House Hunzrin]]: The house of the city's primary agricultural family.\n* [[House Kenafin]]\n* [[Narbondel's Shadow]]: A good but inexpensive inn along the northern cavern wall near the Braeryn. Narbondel's Shadow was run in [[1370 DR]] by [[Nicholas Tindall]], a retired human adventurer who was stranded in Menzoberranzan due to an angry [[deep dragon]]. Tindall had good contacts with the city's merchants and shared them with visitors due to his kindhearted, though cynical, nature.\n* [[Symeera's]]: Symeera's was a fine inn run in [[1370 DR]] by [[Symeera]] of [[Neverwinter]], a [[mage]] of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] guild of Neverwinter, who was stranded in the Underdark two decades previously. Symeera is also well-connected with the city's merchants."
