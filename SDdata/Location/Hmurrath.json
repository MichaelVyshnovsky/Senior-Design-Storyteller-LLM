        "mainbody": "Hmurrath (, the empire of Hmurrath arose alongside the new empires of Asarem and the Theocracy of the Deep Ones. This signaled the start of the Third Epoch of the Inner Sea, also known by the epithet \"Time of the Merfolk\".\nIn the Seventh Serôs War (&ndash) the empire allied with Esrath, the oldest kingdom in the shalarin empire of Asarem, against the onslaught of the Theocracy of the Deep Ones.\nHmurrath later fought alongside Asarem as a whole in the Eighth Serôs War (&ndash) against the ixitxachitl kingdom of the Paolan Reef, culminating in its destruction.\nIn , a merrow chieftain by the name of Tarag led an uprising against Hmurrath through a combination of his own battle strategies and the legendary sword Ilbratha. He conquered the empires western frontiers, founding the Axe Kingdoms. Over time tensions gave rise to the Ninth Serôs War (&ndash). In the second year of this conflict the Battle of the Haunted Plains took place, where the Hmurrans achieved a major victory and drove four-fifths of Serôsian merrows south, forcing the merrows to invade sahuagin territory on the other side of the Sharksbane Wall. This upset drove the sahuagin to send raiding parties over the Wall, dragging other kingdoms into the war and prolonging it.\nThe genocidal violence that was conducted during Ninth Serôs War arose concern among the various people of Serôs. Four years after the conflict this culminated in Hmurrath, Asarem, and the organization of wizards known as Dukars to draft together the Laws of Battle, thus ensuring that such devastation might not foul the waters of their land in the future.\nThe beginning of the end for Hmurrath began in  with the Tenth Serôs War. This conflict was comprised of a series of seven civil wars,It is erroneously stated on page 139 of Sea of Fallen Stars that it was the Fifth Serôs War where the kingdom fell in part, whereas in other parts of the book it is clearly stated to have been the Tenth Serôs War. waged by the six living princes of the empire. These conflicts tore the empire apart, pitting all of the races of Serôs against one another, Even the shalarin contributed to decimating the empire. Throughout these civil wars the Dukars remained uninvolved, only stepping in to protect bystanders and innocents as well as to uphold the Laws of Battle.\nThe conflicts tearing Hmurrath apart slowly waned in time, seeming as though the warring might soon be at an end. But then in , who had used an artifact known as the Sashelan Glass to transform themselves into sea elves.It is incorrectly stated on page 136 of Sea of Fallen Stars that Myth Drannan refugees \"stirred up the latter half of the Seventh Serôs War.\" as Hmurrans grew concerned that the elves were trying to restore the ancient empire of Aryselmalyr.\n was considered by some to be the date when Hmurrath had fallen completely,As the date of 724 DR is also given on the same page where its erroneously stated that Hmurrath fell during the Fifth Serôs War, its not out of the realm of possibility that the date might also be an error and therefore that the end date of the Tenth Serôs War (750 DR) might be the more accurate one. but remnants of the empire continued to wage war, with the Tenth Serôs War not ending until . When fighting had finally ceased the merfolk were overwrought with grief over what they had lost. But among their numbers an oracle blessed by the gods arose, and led them back into harmony with the other races of Serôs. founding the successor state of Eadraal in ."
