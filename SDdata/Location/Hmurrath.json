It was succeeded by the kingdom of [[Eadraal]].",
        "Geography": "The territory of Hmurrath encompassed the [[Hmur Plateau]], with its most remote outposts being situated on the slopes above the [[Bymmal Trench]].<ref>",
        "Government": "Each settlement of Hmurrath was centered around a clan, referred to by the title of \"praessar\". The praessar ruled from the empire's capital city of [[Baomal]]. For a long time the Hmurran's rulership over Serôs was compared favorably to the [[aquatic elves]] that ruled the Aryselmalyr Empire. However, over time the Hmurrath government similarly became subject to corruption and despotism, with its praessars causing destruction in the land comparable to the [[sahuagin]].\n\nOver the course of the empire's history there were forty-six praessars, with thirty-seven of them being [[gender and sex|male]] and nine of them [[gender and sex|female]].",
        "Culture": "Hmurrath had an isolationist and patriarchal warrior culture. Much of its social structure was derived from the Aryselmalyr Empire, as it had overtaken the original social structures of the merfolk of the Inner Sea that were often kept down by their aquatic elf rulers. Hmurrath also adopted Aryselmalyr's advancements in weapon technology and its complex, organized architectural styles that used a combination of [[coral]] and carved stone. Though the empire distanced itself from the elven styles it adopted by adapting various hardier [[coral]]s for their buildings in place of carved stone.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Aryselmalyr, the empire of Hmurrath systematically oppressed the [[merrow (ogre)|merrows]] that lived on the Hmur Plateau, keeping them in a barbaric state over fears of them potentially dominating Serôs. And Hmurrath's merfolk commonly carried a prejudical attitude towards all those who lacked a full fish tail like them.\n\nTime was measured in the kingdom using a system known as the [[Calendar of Hmur]], which continued to see use by some merfolk and many [[locathah]]s long after the empire's fall.",
        "History": "With the fall of the Aryselmalyr Empire, the [[Sixth Serôs War]] was kicked off and many of the races of Serôs that were once subjects to the aquatic elves began to vie for their own control of the undersea world. Following the war's end in {{YearlinkConvert|-145|TS}}, the empire of Hmurrath arose alongside the new empires of [[As'arem]] and the [[Theocracy of the Deep Ones]]. This signaled the start of the [[Third Epoch]] of the Inner Sea, also known by the epithet \"Time of the Merfolk\".\n\nIn the [[Seventh Serôs War]] ({{YearlinkConvert|-38|TS}}&ndash;{{YearlinkConvert|-36|TS}}) the empire allied with [[Es'rath]], the oldest kingdom in the [[shalarin]] empire of As'arem, against the onslaught of the Theocracy of the Deep Ones.\n\nHmurrath later fought alongside As'arem as a whole in the [[Eighth Serôs War]] ({{YearlinkConvert|289|TS}}&ndash;{{YearlinkConvert|291|TS}}) against the [[ixitxachitl]] kingdom of the [[Paolan Reef]], culminating in its destruction.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|652|TS}}, a merrow chieftain by the name of [[Tarag]] led an uprising against Hmurrath through a combination of his own battle strategies and the legendary sword ''[[Ilbratha]]''. He conquered the empire's western frontiers, founding the [[Axe Kingdoms]]. Over time tensions gave rise to the [[Ninth Serôs War]] ({{YearlinkConvert|723|TS}}&ndash;{{YearlinkConvert|726|TS}}). In the second year of this conflict the [[Battle of the Haunted Plains]] took place, where the Hmurrans achieved a major victory and drove four-fifths of Serôsian merrows south, forcing the merrows to invade sahuagin territory on the other side of the [[Sharksbane Wall]]. This upset drove the sahuagin to send raiding parties over the Wall, dragging other kingdoms into the war and prolonging it.\n\nThe genocidal violence that was conducted during Ninth Serôs War arose concern among the various people of Serôs. Four years after the conflict this culminated in Hmurrath, As'arem, and the organization of [[wizard]]s known as [[Dukar]]s to draft together the [[Laws of Battle]], thus ensuring that such devastation might not foul the waters of their land in the future.\n\nThe beginning of the end for Hmurrath began in {{YearlinkConvert|779|TS}} with the [[Tenth Serôs War]]. This conflict was comprised of a series of seven civil wars,<ref group=\"note\" name=\"war\">It is erroneously stated on page 139 of ''Sea of Fallen Stars'' that it was the Fifth Serôs War where the kingdom fell in part, whereas in other parts of the book it is clearly stated to have been the Tenth Serôs War. waged by the six living princes of the empire. These conflicts tore the empire apart, pitting all of the races of Serôs against one another, Even the shalarin contributed to decimating the empire. Throughout these civil wars the Dukars remained uninvolved, only stepping in to protect bystanders and innocents as well as to uphold the Laws of Battle.\n\nThe conflicts tearing Hmurrath apart slowly waned in time, seeming as though the warring might soon be at an end. But then in {{YearlinkConvert|785|TS}}, who had used an artifact known as the ''[[Sashelan Glass]]'' to transform themselves into sea elves.It is incorrectly stated on page 136 of ''Sea of Fallen Stars'' that [[Myth Drannor|Myth Drannan]] refugees \"stirred up the latter half of the Seventh Serôs War.\" as Hmurrans grew concerned that the elves were trying to restore the ancient empire of Aryselmalyr.\n\n{{YearlinkConvert|794|TS}} was considered by some to be the date when Hmurrath had fallen completely,As the date of 724 DR is also given on the same page where it's erroneously stated that Hmurrath fell during the Fifth Serôs War, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the date might also be an error and therefore that the end date of the Tenth Serôs War (750 DR) might be the more accurate one. but remnants of the empire continued to wage war, with the Tenth Serôs War not ending until {{YearlinkConvert|820|TS}}. When fighting had finally ceased the merfolk were overwrought with grief over what they had lost. But among their numbers an oracle blessed by the gods arose, and led them back into harmony with the other races of Serôs. founding the successor state of [[Eadraal]] in {{YearlinkConvert|805|TS}}."
