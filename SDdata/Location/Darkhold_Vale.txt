'''Darkhold Vale''' was a small valley found within the [[Far Hills]] of the [[Western Heartlands]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Geography==
The vale sat within the Far Hills between two arms of the [[Sunset Mountains]] northwest of the [[Tun Marshes]] and due east of the [[Dusk Road]].

==Description==
Darkhold Vale was relatively small, measuring approximately {{SI|3500|ft|long=yes}} in length by {{SI|2000|ft|long=yes}} wide in a roughly rectangular shape. An unnamed stream flowed through the center of the vale and turned south at the vale's mouth. The southeast section of the vale held a quarry. A fortified perimeter wall was constructed at the vale's mouth.

==Notable Locations==
Darkhold Vale's most imposing feature was the large castle of [[Darkhold]] that sat near the rear of the vale.
