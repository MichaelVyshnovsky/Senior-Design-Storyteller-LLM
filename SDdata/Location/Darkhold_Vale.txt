Darkhold Vale was a small valley found within the Far Hills of the Western Heartlands.
The vale sat within the Far Hills between two arms of the Sunset Mountains northwest of the Tun Marshes and due east of the Dusk Road.
Darkhold Vale was relatively small, measuring approximately  in length by  wide in a roughly rectangular shape. An unnamed stream flowed through the center of the vale and turned south at the vales mouth. The southeast section of the vale held a quarry. A fortified perimeter wall was constructed at the vales mouth.
Darkhold Vales most imposing feature was the large castle of Darkhold that sat near the rear of the vale.
