Iyritrastrul was southern of the two islands that collectively were known as the Tusks.
Iyritrastrul islet was directly across from its bigger sister â€“ the island of Borammur.
Iyritrastrul was occasionally used by damaged ships traveling across the Race, where they could perform necessary repairs using the islets abundant shadowtops, duskwood, and blueleaf that grew on its southern side.
