Elventree was a sylvan community in the West Branch of the Moonsea in the forest of Cormanthor.
It was surrounded on three sides by low hills dotted with caves.
Elventree had been built up with wood on ruins of stone buildings. There was an elegant but natural-looking palace. There were also a number of structures in the branches of trees, which were linked by rope ladders, walkways, and bridges of silver rope and white planks. The ground was reserved for cooking fires and gathering spaces where residents met to pass news or share a song.

Elventree had no formal leadership and no formal laws, but nevertheless the inhabitants were able to live in harmony with each other and with the land.
The local Herald office was known as Moonsilver. Elanil Elassidil held this position in 1367 DR. The heraldic symbol of the moon elves that populated Elventree was a black oval with the long axis oriented from lower left to upper right, a silver crescent moon drifting downward, trailing silver stars from each of its points.
In 1372 DR, the half-elf Dessaer was called the Lord of Elventree.
Elventree was home to a number of fine bowyers and fletchers, as well as wood carvers. Elventree also produced herbs, medicinal plants, exotic fruit, and tapestries. It imported swords, armor, parchment, wine, and seafood.
Elventree was not on a caravan route and there were no trading houses. Supplies were brought to the town and carried away by trading parties. When the rare caravan did stop in town, it was considered a festival and the community came together to buy directly from the merchant.
Elventree was established in 702 DR. It became a haven for half-elves, rangers, artists, druids, and later an outpost for the Harpers.

Environs
* House of the Harp A stone harp outside a fieldstone hut in a ravine just outside of town marked a base for the Harpers. The hut led into an underground headquarters with cave rooms and tunnels that linked to other caves in Elventree. The House of the Harp was operated by Shalaer, the ghost of a half-elven bard who communicated with the half-dozen Harpers living in the area. Wands of lightning and magic missile were set up to protect the base.
* The Dancing Stone A site sacred to the worshipers of Eilistraee was located in the vicinity. Because of that, a number of Eilistraeeans (both drow and otherwise) were welcome in the town.
Elventree was a modest community largely comprising nonhuman refugees from Hillsfars Great Law of Humanity. Its population of 900 included 200 elves, mostly wood elves, who were viewed as representatives of the Elven Court.
