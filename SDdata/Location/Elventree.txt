'''Elventree''' was a sylvan community in the West Branch of the [[Moonsea]] in the forest of [[Cormanthor]].

==Geography==
It was surrounded on three sides by low hills dotted with caves.{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|7}}

==Structure==
Elventree had been built up with wood on ruins of stone buildings. There was an elegant but natural-looking palace. There were also a number of structures in the branches of trees, which were linked by [[rope ladder]]s, walkways, and bridges of silver rope and white planks. The ground was reserved for cooking fires and gathering spaces where residents met to pass news or share a song.

==Government==

Elventree had no formal leadership and no formal laws, but nevertheless the inhabitants were able to live in harmony with each other and with the land.

The local [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|Herald]] office was known as Moonsilver. [[Elanil Elassidil]] held this position in [[1367 DR]]. The heraldic symbol of the moon elves that populated Elventree was a black oval with the long axis oriented from lower left to upper right, a silver crescent moon drifting downward, trailing silver stars from each of its points.{{Cite dragon/267/The New Adventures of Volo: Onward!|81}}

In [[1372 DR]], the half-elf [[Dessaer]] was called the Lord of Elventree.

==Trade==
Elventree was home to a number of fine bowyers and fletchers, as well as wood carvers. Elventree also produced [[herb]]s, medicinal plants, exotic fruit, and tapestries. It imported swords, armor, parchment, wine, and seafood.

Elventree was not on a caravan route and there were no trading houses. Supplies were brought to the town and carried away by trading parties. When the rare caravan did stop in town, it was considered a festival and the community came together to buy directly from the merchant.

==History==
Elventree was established in [[702 DR]]. It became a haven for [[half-elves]], [[ranger]]s, artists, [[druid]]s, and later an outpost for the [[Harpers]].

==Notable Locations==
;Temples and Shrines:
* [[Halls of the Unicorn]]: Elventree's largest temple, located in hollowed-out trunks of fallen trees and dedicated to [[Mielikki]].
* [[Cairn of Mysteries]]: A great cairn and temple dedicated to [[Mystra]]. It was tended to by a masked wizard known only as "[[the Sentinel (wizard)|the Sentinel]]."{{Cite adventurers league/State of Hillsfar|3}}
* Other shrines to [[Chauntea]], [[Silvanus]], [[Eldath]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Rillifane Rallathil]].

;Other Establishments:
* [[Gold Cave|The Gold Cave]]: One of the few shops in Elventree, this cave provided all the basics for travel but little else. It was run by the half-elf [[Amaril Sweetwater]] in [[1367 DR]].
* [[Swaying Bough|The Swaying Bough]]: An inn located in the branches of a giant oak tree. The proprietor in [[1367 DR]] was [[Emric]].
* [[Tree Spirits|The Tree Spirits]]: A fine tavern.

;Other:
* [[Listening Tree]]: A giant [[oak]] standing in the center of Elventree. The branches of the tree itself served as an amphitheater; performances happened here regularly.

;Environs:
* [[House of the Harp (Elventree)|House of the Harp]]: A stone harp outside a fieldstone hut in a ravine just outside of town marked a base for the Harpers. The hut led into an underground headquarters with cave rooms and tunnels that linked to other caves in Elventree. The House of the Harp was operated by [[Shalaer]], the ghost of a half-elven [[bard]] who communicated with the half-dozen Harpers living in the area. Wands of ''[[lightning]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]'' were set up to protect the base.
* [[Dancing Stone|The Dancing Stone]]: A site sacred to the worshipers of Eilistraee was located in the vicinity. Because of that, a number of Eilistraeeans (both drow and otherwise) were welcome in the town.

==Inhabitants==
Elventree was a modest community largely comprising nonhuman refugees from [[Hillsfar]]'s Great Law of Humanity. Its population of 900 included 200 elves, mostly [[wood elf|wood elves]], who were viewed as representatives of the [[Elven Court]].

===Individuals===
* [[Elanil Elassidil]], Herald in [[1367 DR]].
* [[Dessaer]], Lord of Elventree ([[1372 DR]]).
* [[Fandar]], elven swordsman (1372 DR).
* [[Curnil]], black-bearded human captain (1372 DR).
* [[Seyll Auzkovyn]], [[drow]] high priestess of [[Eilistraee]] and advisor to Lord Dessaer. (Seyll likely did not reside in Elventree itself, but rather in the vicinity with other Eilistraeeans.)
