Some specimens were exceptionally nourishing, while others were extremely toxic when consumed yet others grew to gigantic proportions, great glowing mushrooms that were larger than most humanoids from Toril.\nDue to the enslavement of other beings by Malabog and his armies, both dryads and portal hounds could be found within the realm, though typically under duress and dire circumstance.\nAfter Malabog began his campaign of conquest against the elves of New Sharandar, circa the , the fomorian kings realm began to resemble a great war camp. Malabogs black knight Celadaine conscripted redcaps to begin construction of siege weaponry in preparation for the assault on the city. In response, the Iliyanbruen elves led by Merrisara Winterwhite launched their own counter-offensive. They established a small outpost near the High Cliffs region of the realm and struck out against the king and his allies.\n* Malabogs Castle, the labyrinthine fortress of King Malabog.\n* Tower of Celadaine, a fallen tower that was used by Malabogs black knight, Celadaine.\nThe kingdom was home to Malabogs army of fey dark minions. At the head of these forces were the fomorian commanders, the powerful cyclops warriors, and the hordes of lesser creatures, namely fell trolls, quicklings, and redcaps."
