        "mainbody": "ld Thindar was a portion of Thindar that had been swallowed by the sea.\nOld Thindar composed the main portion of Thindars port district. This section of this city would slowly erode with each storm that passed overhead, eventually leading to a complex of ruins that were completely submerged under the waters of the Thingulph. Daring adventurers often tried to search the sunken ruins for hidden treasure but few returned because of the presence of dangerous yuan-ti."
