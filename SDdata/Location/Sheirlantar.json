        "Geography": "It stood on the [[Lapal Way]] by the [[River Talar]], on the western flanks of the [[Dun Hills (Lapaliiya)|Dun Hills]]. A road led east to [[Kormul]].",
        "Government & Religion": "The civic deity of Sheirlantar was once [[Myrkul]], until he died in the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. The town elders did not acknowledge his successor [[Cyric]]. They eventually switched to [[Kelemvor]], who arose as the new Lord of the Dead in [[1368 DR]].\n\nThe leader of the city was titled the Keeper of Crypts, and was traditionally a high-ranked priest of the god of the dead and appointing by the Overking of Lapaliiya. ''Circa'' [[1373 DR]], this was the priestess of Kelemvor, [[Antara o' Bones]].",
        "Population": "The Tomb City was home to 7306 living people.",
        "Activities": "For centuries, it was a custom of the Lapaliiyan upper classes to bury the most important among them in the hills above Sheirlantar. Thus, many tombs and crypts were scattered over the central part of the range, and [[undead]] were an ever-present threat there, though the priests of Kelemvor continually tried to eradicate them."
