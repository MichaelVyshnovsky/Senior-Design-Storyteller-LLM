        "mainbody": "Myrkul\nSheirlantar, known as the Tomb City, was a city in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14th century DR.\nIt stood on the Lapal Way by the River Talar, on the western flanks of the Dun Hills. A road led east to Kormul.\nThe civic deity of Sheirlantar was once Myrkul, until he died in the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR. The town elders did not acknowledge his successor Cyric. They eventually switched to Kelemvor, who arose as the new Lord of the Dead in 1368 DR.\nThe leader of the city was titled the Keeper of Crypts, and was traditionally a high-ranked priest of the god of the dead and appointing by the Overking of Lapaliiya. Circa 1373 DR, this was the priestess of Kelemvor, Antara o Bones.\nThe Tomb City was home to 7306 living people.\nFor centuries, it was a custom of the Lapaliiyan upper classes to bury the most important among them in the hills above Sheirlantar. Thus, many tombs and crypts were scattered over the central part of the range, and undead were an ever-present threat there, though the priests of Kelemvor continually tried to eradicate them."
