        "mainbody": "Elturel ( century DR, it was the capital of the realm of Elturgard, a theocracy of Torm the True and defended by its paladin knighthood, the Order of the Companion.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, the people of the region spoke the Thorasta language, which was related to Chondathan. People and things from here were called \"Elturian\", while \"Elturelian\" was considered incorrect.\nThe city was situated atop a bluff or tor with a cliff dominating the River Chionthar. This was both a good defensive position and a good crossing-point, as the river below was narrow, shallow, and easily traversed by poling barges the city was founded here for this advantage. The river linked it with Berdusk, Iriaebor, and Scornubel, and to Baldurs Gate on the Sword Coast.\nThe Skuldask Road ran through Elturel, linking it to Thundars Ride in the Fields of the Dead in the northwest, and to Berdusk and Uldoons Trail in the southwest. The lesser-used Dusk Road began at Elturel and went northeast to meet the Trade Way at Triel. It was a major stop on the trade routes through the Western Heartlands.\nthumb|right|A ward token for a Hellrider Lodge.\nIn the 1360s DR, Elturel laid claim to lands along the Dusk Road northeast as far as Triel, along the Skuldask Road northwest to where it met Thundars Ride and southeast down to Windstream Lodge, and along the Chionthar upstream to Scornubel, and downstream to Stone Eagle Lodge. The border was distinct within, the land was farmed and settled without, wilderness reigned, the land covered in shrubs and scrub trees. Elturels domain was characterized by agriculture, where cattle and sheep grazed, brush was cut back, and farms fenced by hedges and stone walls studded the landscape.\nAfter the 1430s DR, a shining orb known as the Companion or \"Amaunators Gift\" hung directly over the center of the city, never setting. Only the High Observer knew if this was truly a blessing of the sun god Amaunator. This second sun produced no heat but its light illuminated the city day and night, as bright as the natural sun and burned undead of all kinds. Creatures of darkness could not even bear to look at the city. It could be seen from virtually anywhere within Elturgard, though it faded with distance.\nBy 1356 DR, the city was ruled by its High Rider, Lord Dhelt, a paladin of Helm and former leader of the Hellriders. He remained in power through 1367 DR and past 1372 DR. His focus was on maintaining Elturel as the most efficient, secure, and well-policed city in the region, with interests in farming and trade. The Hellriders helped Elturel establish and maintain civilization in these harsh lands. His reign went unquestioned, but was seen as just and fair and wise and competent. He was vigilant on defense and preventing crime, and in keeping the city clean and lawful. He was known to be respectable and tolerant, as a leader who actively promoted trade while letting merchants getting on with business with minimum interference.\nThe Herald of the city was titled Ironflower.\nIn the late 1400s DR, the city and Elturgard as a whole were ruled by the High Observer of Torm, a priest named Thavius Kreeg.While this religious zealotry and inquisitions are made explicit in the write-up of Elturgard in the 4-edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, they are not mentioned at all in the more extensive and very positive description in the 5-edition Sword Coast Adventurers Guide. The two versions are difficult to reconcile. As such, this more positive vision may reflect a retcon, either out-of-universe or in-universe with the Second Sundering the narrator for this section, Aedyn Graymantle, being mistaken or unaware of the extreme elements or propaganda one way or the other. Regardless, this wiki endeavors to present both versions for the reader to make their own judgement.\nWhile it remained an independent city, Circa 1370 DR, a 30-strong squad of Lords Alliance troops, contributed to mainly by Elturel and Baldurs Gate, were garrisoned in Port Llast to guard against attack from Luskan. By 1489 DR, Elturel, now a power of its own, was no longer a member of the Lords Alliance.\nIn the mid-1300s DR, Elturel was a mutual rival of Scornubel, a city of comparable size and capability lying upriver. Lord Dhelt looked for ways to overthrow Scornubels position as the major trading town between Iriaebor and Waterdeep and Elturians themselves endeavored to beat them in riches.\nIn the 1300s DR, the main threats in Elturels domain were bandits preying on the traders and travelers, and orcs, trolls, and ogres from the High Moor raiding the farms of the Fields of the Dead.\nIn the late 1400s DR, Elturel was the capital of Elturgard, the Kingdom of the Two Suns, a realm that included Berdusk, Iriaebor, Scornubel, Soubar, and Triel, as well as many farms and villages along the roads of the Western Heartlands that were claimed and protected.\nthumb|250px|right|The side entrance to the High Hall.\nThe city was surrounded by a stout stone wall, shielding all but the southern river side. There were two gates, on the northwest and northeast sides. Inside the eastern wall, a canal served as a partial moat.\nElturels main defense in the 14 and 15 centuries DR was the Hellriders, a 2000-strong elite unit of well-equipped, loyal, and close-knit mounted troops. For a city guard, they outmatched the armies of whole realms. They were not only the guards and police of the city, they also patrolled the River Chionthar and surrounding roads, and escorted caravans from Waterdeep to Iriaebor. They maintained guardhouses in the Fields of the Dead and warning beacons in the surrounding farmlands. As well as significant raids, expeditions, and punitive assaults on aggressive demihumans were commanded by Lord Dhelt, the High Rider, or by the High Watcher of Helm Berelduin Shondar. All Hellriders were required to give a tenth of their earnings to Elturels coffers.\nthumb|right|Armor displaying the crest of Elturgard.\nIn the late 15 century, they were joined by the Order of the Companion, a well-armored mounted knighthood of paladins who defended the city and wider Elturgard, swore oaths to the realm and shared its goals, even if the members did not all share faith in Torm. Courageous, righteous, and zealous, they were proud of their dedication to the cause of good, their clear morals, even their intolerance. They were identified by the blazing insignia of the Companion that they wore. Many of the Hellriders now aspired to join the Companions. Both followed the Creed Resolute, swearing to serve the High Observer and the greater good, uphold Elturgards law, and permit no difference in faith to come between them, nor to attribute the Companion to one god or another.\nWell policed by the Hellriders in the mid-1300s DR, Elturel was a very safe city for travelers. Its dockside areas were among the safest in Faerûn, thanks to their organization, the loyalty of the handlers guild, and the alert Hellrider patrols. The main threat was theft by pickpockets, not mugging by thugs.\nIn the late 1400s DR, the city was much stricter and even bad language and irreverent humor could draw the ire of authorities. Elturgards laws were rigid, intolerant, and persecuted evil with inquisitorial zeal, leading to a host of problems. Nevertheless, it remained the safest city in the land.\nThe final verse of the ballad \"The Knights of Dragon Down\" was outlawed in Elturel by 1366 DR, because an evil archmage of the city made it the words of a summoning spell that quickly drew undead to those that sang it.\nIn the 1300s DR, Elturel was the farming center of the Fields of the Dead and thrived on the trade that passed through its domain. It was commonly rated as the second-most economically powerful city in the Western Heartlands after Scornubel and it was quite wealthy. Linking overland caravan and river barge trades, it also served as a market for farms on fertile Fields of the Dead and Chionthar banks. Thousands of cattle and sheep were assembled in Elturel every year for trade across Faerûn. Traders greatly appreciated the protection afforded them by the Hellriders caravans and convoys of riverboats chose routes through Elturels zone of control so they could relax their own security, if only for a day or two.\nthumb|250px|right|Elturian Grey, Elturels favorite cheese. Accept no imitations.\nIts primary exports were livestock and the products of them, namely meat, cheese, leatherwork, wool, and glues rendered from hooves and horns. Equipment shops in the city had moderate availability of goods. Elturian Grey was the premier cheese of Elturel, and was also sold through Auroras Emporium, though counterfeits under similar names were produced.\nThere was a guild of handlers who took care of loading and unloading goods, both on the wagons and on the docks. They were faithful and assisted the costers.\nAfter the founding of Elturgard, the port officials who handled trade in the city circa 1479 DR were overly righteous and handed exorbitant taxes and penalties to traders who showed even the slightest impiety, even banning them from setting foot inside the city. The caravans and riverboat convoys now feared to pass through there.\nthumb|250px|right|The folk of Elturel, going about their business, lawfully.\nIn 1358 DR, Elturel had a registered population of 26,778 citizens, but the real population fluctuated from 29,000 in winter to 33,000 in summer. Much of this population was transient, being traders and travelers just passing through. In event of war, plague, or orc horde, farmers of the Fields of the Dead could take refuge in the city the warehouses and cellars could briefly shelter over 400,000 people. In 1372 DR, the official population was given as 22,671. In 1479 DR, it had a population of around 17,000.\nThe Elturians were mostly Heartlanders,\nIn the 14 century, it was said that every boy and girl of Elturel and the lands around dreamed of being a Hellrider some day, even those whose talents lay in the intellectual more than the martial arts. To call such a child a [https//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hellion \"hellion\"] was not an insult but a compliment, marking one as having the courage and drive to ride the Hellriders destriers. Though they didnt all get special training, Elturians were practically raised in the saddle, learning how to ride and growing familiar with how horses behaved in any situation, even those that never became Hellriders. The downside was that, rightly or wrongly, some folk thought Elturians always smelled of horse.\nIn turn, all true warriors of Elturel were most likely Hellriders. Those who resigned were stripped of their gear, exiled from the city, and named a heretic in the eyes of Helm for abandoning their post. In the mid-1360s DR, there were no living ex-members of the Hellriders—too many had died in battle.\nElturian wizards, meanwhile, were safer in the saddle, being skilled at attacking from their mounts. They were much more capable of avoiding or resisting attacks while mounted than they on foot, being less able to react fast enough.\nOften overlooked in the citys commercial success, Elturian rogues were themselves merchants and traders. They were charismatic, talented in subtle negotiations and driving slick bargains, and skilled in appraising items. However, fighting was bad for business, and Elturian rogues made poor and less-resilient combatants.\nInstead, as a legal outlet for the poor, desperate, unruly, maladjusted, or just violent citizens, there was the High Moor Heroes Guild. This adventuring band made regular expeditions to the High Moor \"scouring\" whatever they found. They also tutored each other and other adventurers.\nOne of Elturels publications of note was Stars Seen, Tales Told, a periodical chapbook that published pleasantries and glowingly positive news. It also printed readers letters, which occasionally led to bitter in-print fights.\nIn the late 15 century, Elturian citizens still often dreamed of joining Elturgards paladin knighthood. This time, many succeeded. Inspired by the Hellriders and the Companions, the folk of Elturgard were typically devout in both their faith and the pursuit of justice. Both troops were loved and respected by the people. Elturel was known as a holy city.\nUnder the eternal day of the second sun in the 1400s DR, Elturians depending on bells tolling in the High Hall to know the beginning and ending of each workday. The constant light reduced typical nighttime activities there was little brawling and muggings, while thieves were perforce extra cautious and cunning. It was especially hard for newcomers to adjust to life here. Inns and boarding houses covered windows with thick curtains to let patrons sleep.\nthumb|250px|right|The High Hall and its surrounds.\nThe city was split into two districts an upper city known as the High District and a lower city known as the Dock District. The High District spread over the slopes of a rising, defensible hill with a rocky cliff on its south side, where it met the Chionthar. In this crowded space, the buildings were constructed of stone, with tall narrow houses topped with spires and bedecked with balconies and windows, and the cobbled streets were narrow, steep, and winding. Their cellars were dug out of the solid rock. This area was home to the citys nobility. Atop the cliff overlooking the river was the High Hall, marked by its soaring turrets and its walls encircling the summit. This was where the High Rider and later the High Observer lived, government was based, bureaucracy was managed, political and religious leaders were housed, and large commercial meetings were held. On the northeastern flank of the hill was a ravine, crossed by two bridges in the late 1400s DR the Torms Reach in the north and the Torms Blade south of it, each  and consecrated in the name of Torm by runes carved into them, and warded against fiends and undead.\nThe Dock District, meanwhile, covered the flatlands around. It was home to markets, stockyards, and warehouses, as well as wagon-makers and yards and officers of other trades associated with caravans. It was dirty, disorderly, and smelly, with buildings designed only for function and business. In the east side, it was known for hovels and warehouses clustered around the docks. In the west side there were tidier and more well-off homes and shops, and in the 1360s the area was more often being called Westerly to distinguish it as cleaner and more prosperous than the east side. Those in the east thought those in the west were lazy, soft, arrogant, and pretentious. In any case, by the late 1400s, houses in the lower town were for the most part of the same design as those on the hill.\nThe city was not all utilitarian. The Garden, also known as \"the Winter Garden\" in local songs and stories, ran right through the middle of the city along the ridge of the hill, long, straight, and narrow \"like the blade of a naked sword\", in the words of Elminster. It began at the High Hall, where a powerful freshwater spring rose in the cellars and fed a stream that wound through the Garden and guaranteed the citys water supply, before spilling over a cliff in the north called Maidens Leap, forming cascades that joined the canal. The Garden was an open space of woods and flowers, crossed by paths and arched bridges but keeping a wild beauty in wintertime. Elturians enjoyed meeting one another here. The wealthiest citizens of the High District had their houses nearest the Garden.\nThe canal began at Maidens Leap in the north and ran east and south within the walls before joining the Chionthar. It formed a partial moat for defense and a passage for barges servicing the eastern Dock District. Four bridges crossed it.The exact name of the bridge is unknown its only known that Maidensbridge Street is named for it. Comparison with Maidens Leap suggests \"Maidens Bridge\" as the original name.\nIn the mid-1300s DR, Elturel was home to two major temples Helms Shieldhall and the High Harvest Home. Thanks to Lord Dhelts patronage, the fortress-like Shieldhall was both the most influential temple in the city and one of the strongest temples of Helm, God of Guardians, in the North. High Watcher Berelduin Shondar ruled it with an iron fist and was aggressive in defense of the Helmite faith. The High Harvest Home, meanwhile, was dedicated to Chauntea, the Grain Goddess, and was managed by Raulauvin Oregh. Both provided aid and shelter to the faithful.) Tymora, Lady Luck and Waukeen, the Merchants Friend, which was rededicated to Lliira, the Joybringer, by 1367 DR after Waukeens absence in 1358 DR.\nLord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, nor could inns serve drinks, so in Elturel these were distinctly different businesses. The better inns stood in the High District, but were simply converted houses and often several neighboring houses linked into one. Those in the Dock District were simpler, not to mention noisier, but were usually the only accommodations available in summer during the trade season. Inns and taverns were generally good in quality. A Pair of Black Antlers was the best-known tavern, and a favorite of adventurers.\nShiarras Market was held within a town square (actually more of an egg-shape) in the eastern Dock District. It was known for crammed stalls. There were a number of farmers markets.\nThe Dragoneye Dealing Coster had a way-base in Elturel around 1356 DR. This was a large warehousing and shipyard area in the eastern Dock District beside the Chionthar, close to the docks.\nA six-wagon ferry crossed the Chionthar south of Elturel, linking it to Skuldask Road and taking travelers into the heart of the city.\nThe Dungeon of the Inquisitor, where lawbreakers were sent in the 1400s, was a maze-like subterranean complex lying beneath Elturel. It covered excavated passages and natural caverns.\nA natural stronghold, this site had long been one of the few defensible locations between the Sword Coast and where the Chionthar met the River Reaching. At one time, it was occupied by trolls, with a stronghold on the hill home to a troll lord. They were later driven out by ogres, and their chieftain ruled from a crude stone fortress. At one point, it was also held by orcs. The ogres were in turn replaced by humans, who settled and built a castle here to guard against the trolls, ogres, and others. Over time, it became the possession of one lordling after another but remained as a refuge for human settlers.Forgotten Realms Adventures page 95 reports the site was occupied by trolls, then ogres, then humans, while Volos Guide to the Sword Coast page 94 says it was trolls, then orcs, then humans.\nGreat battles were once fought on the neighboring Fields of the Dead, and the folk of Elturel and their Riders stayed armed and vigilant, patrolling and protecting the farms.\nIn the , Elturel was among the many communities and realms that contributed forces to the alliance against the massive exodus of goblins and orcs that had left the drought-stricken High Moor. They clashed and all were massacred in the infamous Battle of Bones.\nIn the , a beast-cult of Malar smuggled caged monsters into Elturel and unleashed them in the streets one night. Then they launched a Wild Hunt, hunting and killing the monsters, common folk, and Officers of the Watch alike. The next day, the Malarites were themselves hunted down in revenge. Captured Malarites, living and dead, were examined with magic to locate their lair the Temple of the Beast, in a secret under-cellar in the city. It took several days of bloody fighting to eliminate the cultists. As authorities finally reached the unholy altar, the high priest—with the Book of Fangs and Talons in hand—escaped with a blood teleport powered by the lives of sacrificial victims. The justiciaries were left frustrated.\nThe city was well-established by the mid–14 century DR.\nShandril Shessair, future spellfire wielder, was born in Elturel circa 1341 DR to Garthond and Dammasae. They lived there quietly for a brief time, waiting eight more months for the babe to be old enough to travel before leaving again.\nElturels modern history is tied with that of its famous Hellriders, though there are different accounts of their founding. In all, it was said that a company of Riders had once ridden into the Hells themselves—namely Avernus, the first layer—and from this story, the Hellriders were named. The earliest known version told that it was to rescue one of their own, such was their great loyalty to each other. When she thought them ready, in the , Zariel, riding her golden mastodon Lulu, led them out of the city, with the cheers and good wishes of the Elturians behind them, and embarked on the Ride, a glorious mounted charge through the gate into Avernus. Only a very few returned, sealing the portal behind them. Grief-stricken, they told that Zariel and her army had been defeated, but they were all glorified as the Hellriders.The date 1354 DR coincides with devils occupying Dragonspear Castle, some way north of Elturel, also via portals from Avernus. However, a connection between them, or even which came first, is presently unknown.The story of the Hellriders has changed and evolved significantly in each edition. The 1- and 2-edition campaign settings mention \"the story\" of a small rescue mission of a single person \"in the past\" from the perspective of 1356/1357 DR, but Sword Coast Adventurers Guide and Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus expand this into a major campaign only two years before the 1-edition account, which seems contradictory. It may be that the story has grown in the telling over 140 years and that elements have been misremembered or propagandized. Meanwhile, the change from rescue mission to major campaign suggests a case of \"mission creep\".\nOne night in the mid-1360s DR,The date of Ravenloft Strahds Possession is unknown  this date is assumed based on other works published at the same time. the High Rider of Elturel, Lord Dhelt, and local mage Baranta Chansil were attacked in his bedroom by a supposed assassin, who instead stole Dhelts holy symbol of Helm. Key de Effer, of Dhelts personal guard, responded immediately and, together with Beatrice, pursued the assassin to the woods.These woods may be Elturels Garden area. Confronting and slaying the wounded assassin, they found a note explaining he was seeking the \"Holy Symbol of Ravenkind\" to destroy Strahd von Zarovich of Ravenloft. Before the heroes could return, they were spirited to Barovia, in the Demiplane of Dread.\nSome time after, the city was visited by a mysterious magical veil, stretching from the land to the sky, so Lord Dhelt sent a couple of Hellriders to investigate. Meeting the captain of the Hellriders, they peered through and saw a desert land, but as they ventured in, Elturel disappeared behind them and they were trapped in HarAkir, once again in the Demiplane of Dread.\nThe famed travelogue writer Volothamp Geddarm visited Elturel and wrote of it in his Volos Guide to the Sword Coast around 1366 DR.\nIn 1368 DR, Volo was visiting the city of Elturel once again. The he engaged in a table dice game with a severe-looking northern barbarian. Coincidently, exactly at that time, the goddess of luck Tymora was affected by Iyachtu Xvims plot to steal the powers of the goddess and her sister Beshaba. The city of Elturel, like many other places in the Realms became awash with good luck and its disruptive consequences. Volo ended up rolling a multitude of doubles, enraging his opponent and fleeing for his life through the streets of Elturel.\nIn the , divine conflict saw Helm, God of Guardians, slain by Tyr, God of Justice, leaving the Hellriders, the High Rider, and Elturel itself without their favored god. The following year, catastrophe struck Toril in the form of the Spellplague.This is included for context. Events in Elturel at this time are not known, but Helms death or absence should be presumed to have had a significant impact on such a Helm-dedicated city.\nBy the late 1430s DR, through a variety of excuses, Elturel had laid claim to the lands of its neighbors, placing them within \"Elturels Guard\" as they called it, making itself a petty regional power.\nThen, shockingly, in the , the High Rider himself was discovered to be a vampire, with a vast network of vampire spawn, charmed minions, undead allies, and sycophantic collaborators that surprised even the Hellriders. Now exposed, the undead infested Elturel, and whatever victories the Hellriders won during the days, they lost sorely in the nights. It was said the Elturians prayed to the gods each night just for the dawn to come sooner. Then, one night so devastating it felt like the end, it did. A second sun appeared in the sky, turning night to day, and blasting the vampire lord and his spawn to ashes while the remaining undead cowered from its light. Elturel was swiftly liberated from their dead grip. A priest of Torm, Thavius Kreeg, took the credit and was acclaimed as the savior of Elturel, and few would doubt his goodness or his intent. Only he knew the true origin of the mysterious second sun.\nThe Companion, as it became known, remained where it was, for days and years after. Over time, the miracle brought pilgrims the sick, the curious, and the devout of many faiths, including many paladins. After them came hundreds of people whod fled the menace of undead of one kind or another, who came to Elturel for protection and settled there.\nSome years later, there was a crisis of leadership in Elturel and the likely successor to the post of High Observer, Tamal Thent, and her whole retinue disappeared near Boareskyr Bridge. Despite an investigation, no trace of any of them could be found. Thus, soon after, the post of High Observer was filled by Thavius Kreeg himself, incidentally Thents rival for the role. One of Kreegs first acts as High Observer was to order Fort Tamal built and named in her honor. While this mightve been an honor, in later years a posting to Fort Tamal was apparently a punishment for insubordination by young agitators and zealots in the Order of the Companion. Nevertheless, Kreeg would reign for decades and set Elturel on the road to becoming the nation of Elturgard.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Elturel served as the capital of the realm now known as Elturgard.\nIn the 1480s DR, Leosin Erlanthar and adventurers working with him traveled to Elturel to meet with Ontharr Frume, a paladin of Torm and representative of the Order of the Gauntlet, to discuss recent actions of the Cult of the Dragon.\nAround 1489 DR, Kreeg was aging and another leadership transition was expected soon.\nthumb|left|250px|The city of Elturel being pulled into Avernus.\nIn the , over a few months, Kreeg coaxed Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldurs Gate to come to Elturel to resolve several disputes that had troubled the two cities for some time. After greeting the Baldurian delegation, Kreeg escaped Elturel in secret, shortly before the Companion changed into a black orb that tore the whole of Elturel and its populace from the Material Plane and spirited it away to Avernus, first of the Nine Hells, with only a crater left behind. It would transpire that, to rid Elturel of the vampires fifty years before, Kreeg had made a deal, not with the god Torm but with the now-archdevil Zariel. Shed provided the Companion—in truth, an infernal device powered by an imprisoned planetar—but at the cost of the whole city and its oathbound defenders, to be claimed after only fifty years, with the intent that they should serve as her army in waging the Blood War.\nthumb|left|250px|The devastation of the High Hall during the descent into Avernus.\nOver the next few days, hundreds of refugees, both citizens whod escaped Elturel or been outside at the time, and folk from wider Elturgard, made their way to neighboring Baldurs Gate, with some blaming Elturels rival for the citys loss. However, they were barred from the city and the resident Flaming Fist began arresting Hellriders on sight, fearing they would cause trouble, but this only led to fighting. Those who did get in, like Hellrider Reya Mantlemorn, relayed news of the catastrophe and enlisted heroes who could investigate and ultimately pursue the stolen city into Avernus, thwart Zariels foul scheme, and return it to Toril by some means.\nthumb|250px|right|Elturel suspended between the Companion and the Styx.\nThey found Elturel a quake-wracked, war-torn city suspended in the air around  over the River Styx, anchored by massive chains and spikes of infernal iron driven into the ground and steadily being dragged down to its doom. Torn from the land, the city was fractured in twain along the ravine that ran through the city. The black Companion still hung malevolently over the city, raining down lightning that raised ghouls, ghasts, and zombies. While devils besieged the city, demons attacked them in another battle of the Blood War, and the surviving Elturians fought off both or simply hid in the ruins. Many people died in the devastation, to the demons and devils, or to thirst and starvation. With the citys leaders lost, none other than Grand Duke Ravengard rallied the defense. The High Hall was the center of the defense effort, and also the focus of the devil assault.\nEventually Elturel was returned to its rightful place in the Heartlands of Faerûn. While the exact specifics of its return to unknown, there were ramifications that were felt far and wide. Many if not all the citys tieflings were exiled from the city, thanks to a new wave of misplaced fear and newly-formed prejudice.\nthumb|right|250px|A map of Elturel during the descent into Avernus.\nGovernment Buildings High Hall • Dungeon of the Inquisitor\nTemples & Shrines Helms Shieldhall • High Harvest Home • Temple of the Beast • Temple of the Morninglord • Hand That Swings the Sword\nInns Black Gryphon • Dwarfs Pot Inn • Gallowgars Inn • Hondakars House • Phontyrs Unicorn • Oar and Wagonwheel Inn • Symbrils House\nTaverns A Pair of Black Antlers • The Bent Helm • The Glowing Goblet\nRoads \n* Maidensbridge Street turns westward to cross Maidens Bridge, running around the northern central heights to Westerly\n* Baerth Lane\nOther\n* Everlight Theatre a theater that hosted troupes such as the Sharptongue Travelling Troupe in the late 15 century DR.\n* Grand Cemetery a large graveyard in the western part of the city.\n* Torms Blade a bridge connecting the two halves of the city.\n* Torms Reach a bridge connecting the two halves of the city.\n* Mari Almaren, a Harper bard\n*Reya Mantlemorn, a Hellrider"
