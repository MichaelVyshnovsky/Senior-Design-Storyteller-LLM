}}'''Dernall Forest''' was a woodland on the isle of [[Alaron]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] ''circa'' the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR]].

==Geography==
This forest covered a large portion of central Alaron. The [[Swanmay River]] flowed through it from roughly northwest to southeast. It was also traversed north to south by [[High King's Road]]. Its northern boundary was the foothills of the [[Fairheight Range]]. On the west side was the [[Drowned Forest]] and some coastal towns. The eastern border faded into the fields of [[Talffolk]] and the southern border was bound by the rolling hills of [[Stirgewick]]. [[Caer Callidyrr]], the capital of the Moonshaes, stood on the northeast edge of the forest.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|15}} The Dernall Forest touched the western border of the [[Central Plains (Alaron)|Central Plains]].

==History==
In 1479 DR, the Dernall Forest was under siege by creatures sent through a rift from the [[Feywild]] by Great [[Gark]], the Goblin King of [[Nachtur]]. The breach in planar integrity was deep in the heart of the forest and the troops of House [[Kendrick]] were hard pressed to repel the growing evil presence.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|14}}

==Notable Locations==
* [[Bounty]]: a village on the High King's Road.
* [[Caer Callidyrr]]: the capital city.
* [[Doncastle]]: a city on the Swanmay River.
* [[Hickorydale]]: a village near the Drowned Forest.
* [[Horsa]]: a city on the High King's Road.
* [[Lehigh]]: a village on the High King's Road.
* [[Ogden]]: a city on the High King's Road.

==Inhabitants==
By the 1300s [[DR]], the forest had become a dangerous place due to the presence of [[bandit]]s and outlaws who struck fear even in the hearts of the High King's soldiers. One of these brigand leaders, more honorable than many, was a man named [[O'Roarke]] who had been outlawed by High King [[Carrathal]] for voicing his firm conviction that Carrathal was not a legitimate ruler of the [[Ffolk]]. 

As of [[1479 DR]], creatures reported to be in the forest included [[fomorian]]s, and [[worg]]s.
