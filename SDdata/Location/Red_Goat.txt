The Red Goat was a central province of the Yikarian Empire in 1367 DR.
Save for a relatively small stretch of mountainous terrain on its southern edge, the Red Goat province was completely enclosed by other provinces of the Yikarian Empire, making it relatively secure. This province ran down a stretch of the World Pillar Mountains where they entered Zakhara. The Red Goat was much longer measured north to south than it was from west to east.
Old Goatbeard ruled this province of the Empire. Herds of livestock here were plentiful compared to those found throughout the Empire.
