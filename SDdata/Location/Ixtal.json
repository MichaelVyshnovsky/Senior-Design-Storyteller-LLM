        "mainbody": "Ixtal was the easternmost settlement of the Maztican nation of Huacli, first to fall to the bloodthirsty Nexalan empire in the 12 century DR.\nIxtal was a minor town with a population somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 humans. It was located at the southern end of the mountain chain that separated the Valley of Nexal from the arable valley where the city-state Pulco stood.\nIxtals most notable historic event took place in the 12 century DR, during the reign of Ipana III as the Revered Counselor of Nexal. During the era of growth, Ipana sought to satisfy the Nexalan deity – Bloody Zaltec. The Revered Counselor led the empires armies to subjugate settlements of Cordotl and Palul only to be turned around by the defenders of the Maztican nation of Kultaka. Disheartened by that loss, Revered Counselor Ipana turned his attention to his western neighbor – Huacli. The military campaign was ruinous to the Huacli peoples, and Ixtal fell to the Nexalan armies, becoming yet another subjugated city-state of the empire. For the remainder of the Nexalan empires existence – into the 14 century DR, Ixtal paid regular tributes to Nexal – food, precious materials, and slaves."
