'''Aglarond''' ({{Pronounce|AHG|lah|rond|refs=}}) was a [[magocracy|magocratic]] state in the southwestern-most part of the [[Unapproachable East]] with its capital at [[Veltalar]]. Most of its land was covered by the [[Yuirwood]]. Filled with magic and mystery, it was ruled by one of the most potent spellcasters of the Realms: [[the Simbul]], until {{Yearlink|1425}}, and around [[1479 DR]], it was ruled by fifteen [[Simbarch of Aglarond|Simbarchs]], [[arcane spellcaster]]s trained in the Simbul's arts.
{{quote|In marked contrast to the grim and evil land of Thay, neighboring Aglarond is a pleasant land of deep woods, deep seas, and towering cliffs. Ruled by the mysterious woman known as the Simbul, one of the Red Wizards' most implacable enemies, Aglarond is an important counter to the growing strength of Thay and has defeated that lands legions on several occasions. Given its vital role in the continuing struggle against Thay, a good knowledge of Aglarond, its land, and its people is important for both the Harpers and anyone who plans to travel in the region.

==Geography==
[[File:Aglarond coast.png|thumb|250px|''The coast of Aglarond and a transforming [[selkie]].'']]
There was only one major port in Aglarond, [[Velprintalar]], later known as [[Veltalar]]. The large peninsula's coastline mainly comprised rocky cliffs with villages and towns settled near inlets suitable only for fishing boats and other smaller ships.

As of 1479 DR, the Yuirwood was filled with [[plagueland]]s formed in the wake of the [[Spellplague]], filled with ruins of an ancient, long-gone [[eladrin]] civilization.

===Regions===

* [[The Fang]]

===Towns and Cities===
The larger cities in Aglarond were the coastal ones. Most cities were supported by agriculture or fishing. Wealthier inhabitants lived in stone buildings, the poor lived in thatched huts, and those in-between lived in buildings of two or three stories, made of weathered wood with steep shale or tile roofs. Construction was usually dense, with narrow streets.

; Veltalar:
:The capital of Aglarond, [[Veltalar]] was a large city numbering around 70,000 in population. Formerly known as Velprintalar, Veltalar was the seat of the Simbarch Council and Aglarond's principle harbor around 1479 DR. After the [[Spellplague]], the city expanded westwards to meet the receding coastline of the Sea of Fallen Stars, leaving the older parts of the city, now called [[Old Velprintalar]] as little more than slums.

;Delthuntle:
:A young community, [[Delthuntle]] had recently emerged as one of Aglarond's commercial centers and major ports by 1479 DR. The city primarily earned a profit through trade with the new [[genasi]] nation of [[Akanûl]], which helped to give it one of the highest non-native genasi populations throughout the world.

;[[Undumor]]:
:The fortress of [[Undumor]], formerly known as Emmech, was lost in the [[Hundred Years of Chaos]] in the 1400s DR to the new [[Thay]]an regime under [[Szass Tam]]. Located at the mouth of the [[River Umber]] the fortress served as an outpost of Thay in Aglarond and was garrisoned by numerous [[undead]] in the former's service. It was constantly in a state of warfare with the nearby fortress [[Dantalien]], where brave but hopelessly inexperienced youths gathered to attempt to clear out the Thayan presence on Aglarond's soil.

==History==
{{main|History of Aglarond}}
Aglarond was formed after the [[Battle of Ingdal's Arm]] in the {{YearlinkName|1065}}, when the [[half-elves]], who were victorious in the battle, negotiated for the creation of a new nation, with [[Brindor Olósynne]], who had led the half-elf army, as its first king. 

The [[Olósynne Dynasty]] remained in power until the apparent death of [[the Simbul]] in battle with the god [[Velsharoon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1425}}.

As of [[1479 DR]], the Simbarch Council had recently taken control of the country.

==Government==
Aglarond was ruled for several centuries starting in 1065 DR by the [[Olósynne Dynasty]], beginning with the [[half-elf]] King [[Brindor Olósynne|Brindor]]

After the Simbul's disappearance and the end of the monarchy, Aglarond was ruled over by the [[Simbarch of Aglarond|Simbarch Council]], an assembly of fifteen mages learned in the ways of the Simbul. Following her end, the Simbul's followers banded together and took control of the [[Palace of the Simbul]], from which they governed as of 1479 DR, and took it upon themselves to lead her former kingdom. Their rule was not unchallenged, however, and the Council eventually resorted to military might to bring rebelling regions to heel. Since coming to power, the Simbarch Council consolidated their rule and extended Aglarond's power over the disputed [[Wizard's Reach]], defeating the armies of [[Thay]]'s exiled [[zulkir]]s for control of the region.

==Military==
[[File:Aglarondan half-elves vs red wizards.png|thumb|left|250px|''Aglarondan half-elves scouting invading Red Wizards of Thay.'']]
Aglarond's army was formed by Brindor Olósynne early in the nation's history. The army was small and skilled as of [[1368 DR]], famed for its [[Foresters]]—elite units of [[ranger]]s loyal to the crown—operating in the [[Yuirwood]]. The rest of the army comprised [[longbow|archer]]s, [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]], and a few cavalry. These were garrisoned at the fortress of [[Undumor|Emmech]] (later renamed Undumor) and the citadel [[Glarondar]]. Glarondar also featured a small number of [[griffon]]-riders used for scouting. During this period, the militia numbered around 6,000.

Aglarond also has a strong tradition of local militias. When the size of the army was insufficient to deal with a threat, everyday people in Aglarond took up arms, using [[spear]]s and pikes. The 6,000 trained troops could easily be joined by four times that number of citizens.

Aglarond did not formally have a navy. The Foresters used boats called [[coastboat]]s for transportation and raids, especially against invading forces.

In the late 1400s DR, the military of Aglarond was used to cement the control of the Simbarch Council, first through the suppression of resistance to the new government in outlying regions of the country and later as a defense against the encroaching threat of Thay.

==Demographics==
As of 1372 DR, Aglarond's population, numbering somewhere around 1,270,080, was mostly made up of [[humans]], though one-third were [[half-elves]] and a fair number [[elves]]. Over the course of the century since, the local [[tiefling]] population swelled, due to the large number of refugees fleeing from [[Thay]], particularly in the cities of [[Escalant]], [[Glarondar]], and [[Citadel Dantalien]]. Many [[dragonborn]] also came to Aglarond from neighboring lands and both [[genasi]] and [[halfling]]s were found in large numbers in [[Delthuntle]], [[Veltalar]], and [[Furthinghome]].

===Humans===
The humans of Aglarond are regarded as trustworthy and hardworking, living simple lives from agriculture, fishing and herding livestock. Traditionally humans kept close to Aglarond's coastal cities, since these were the first founded by them in the 750s DR, when human colonists first arrived.

Originally, human colonists arriving in Aglarond were [[Unther|Untherite]]s from [[Chessenta]], but these were soon joined by settlers and adventurers from other parts of [[Faerûn]]. The average height of an Aglarondan female was 5 foot 2 inches (157 centimeters) and a male 5 foot 8 inches (173 centimeters). They were hardy, tough people with blue or brown eyes.

Eastern Aglarondan humans dressed in bright colored [[tunic]]s and [[trousers]] embroidered with black thread. They wore bracelets, circlets, rings, necklaces and earrings made from [[bronze]] or [[silver]]. Those in the west owed much of their culture to the pirates who originally inhabited these areas. They dressed in contrasting colors, donning headbands and bandanas, or wore plain brown or white tunics. Jewelry here was simple and inexpensive, including brooches, earrings, nose-rings and necklaces.

The average Aglarondan had no concern for [[magic]] as part of everyday life, instead regarding it as best wielded by those in power. A number of Aglarondan monarchs in the [[Olósynne Dynasty]] were powerful spellcasters, but regular people with these powers were viewed with disdain. Any young children who show a particular gift for magic were recruited as apprentices by the Simbul, becoming members of [[the Simbul's Children]].

===Half-Elves===
The Aglarondan half-elf population was mainly concentrated in and around the [[Yuirwood]]. They were a copper-skinned people, amongst whom about half had pointed ears. There was a large range of attitudes toward other cultures amongst the half-elves. Those who lived on the outskirts of the Yuirwood, nearer to the human settlements, had a more tolerant approach and adopted human traditions, such as living in houses. Those half-elves living deeper in the Yuirwood were in touch with their [[elf|elven]] ancestry, preferring to live the elven way, in small communities, or as hunter-gatherers. Most half-elves either supported or accepted the human presence in Aglarond, but there was rumored to be a small group who were in favor of wiping them out.

Many of the half-elves, and the [[wild elves]] they shared their homes with, distrusted and questioned the authority of the [[Simbarch of Aglarond|Simbarch Council]] that ruled Aglarond in the 1400s DR, though it was only in the 1470s DR that their worries shifted from the ex-[[zulkir]]s of fallen Thay.

Magic among the half-elves was widely practiced; more so among the inhabitants of the Yuirwood. Some of the nomadic tribes still used [[totemic magic]].

Half-elven dress was similar to humans in the areas near human settlements, and even so in parts of the Yuirwood. In the other parts, the half-elves dressed more like wild elves, with fur, [[loincloth]]s and tattoos.

===Halflings===
As of [[1368 DR]], the [[halfling]] population of Aglarond was limited to a few hundred, concentrated on farmland in the area surrounding [[Mesring]] in the east. They were well-liked by both the humans and the half-elves.

==Economy==
Aglarond's economy was largely self-sufficient. It produced everything it needed in order to survive. It did, however, produce a small surplus with which it traded. Aglarond exported [[copper]], [[gem]]s, [[grain]], [[lumber]] and [[Aglarondan blood wine]] and imported [[glass]], [[iron]] and [[textiles]]. The half-elven community produced musical instruments and artwork from wood and [[silver]]. Aglarond did not actively seek trade with other nations; instead, it let in a small number of traders from the outside.

==Transportation==
Sea trade played an important part in Aglarondan economics. The names of vessels from Aglarond were based on the goods they carried like ''Spicesail'' or ''Timberhold''.

===Religion===
There were few temples and holy sites in Aglarond, none large. Some people worshiped regularly, and others were content to show signs of faith in their manner. Aglarondans believed that the prosperity of their land was a sign that the [[God|gods]] favored them. Amongst the humans, the farmers tended to worship [[Chauntea]] and the seafarers [[Valkur]] and [[Selûne]]. Half-elves often venerated [[Mielikki]], [[Silvanus]], the [[Seldarine]], or other human deities, depending on their profession or beliefs. The [[Yuir]] elves used to worship their [[Yuir pantheon|pantheon of gods]], who were assumed to have disappeared with the downfall of the Yuir.
