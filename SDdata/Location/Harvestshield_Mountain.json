        "mainbody": "'''Harvestshield Mountain''' was a mountain located not far from [[Waterdeep]] atop which stood the [[Chauntea's Citadel]].",
        "Description": "The mountain stood above a fertile plain. It was centrally located such that any army that held the mountain would be well-positioned to reach almost any member of the [[Lords' Alliance]].\n\nThere was a forest on the south side which afforded the safest path up to the Citadel. However, as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], parts of this forest were tainted by [[sulfur]]ic runoff originating from the lair of the [[red dragon]] [[Argathakul]] that sat at the mountain's summit. Only [[undead]], such as [[ghoul]]s, could live in these areas.",
        "History": "The mountain, and Chauntea's Citadel atop it, once protected a fertile plain that was a bountiful agricultural center for many generations, and it was this role that earned it the name \"Harvestshield\". During this time, the region was home to [[wizard]]s and [[noble]]s as well as farmers. The wizards worked to create [[golem]]s&mdash;such as the [[Harvestshield Reapers]]&mdash;to defend the mountain and the fields, while the nobles placed little value on combat and instead focused on banquets. This era gave rise to local legends, such as the unsuccessful rebel [[Bellorath]] and the foolish duo of [[Elcharn]] and [[Cielaro]].\n\nThis all ended when the entire region was decimated by Argathakul at some point between the late 8{{th}} and early 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">''[[Warriors of Waterdeep]]'' is set in the late 15{{th}} century DR during [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s tenure as [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], and Laeral states that \"Few are still alive who remember how cruelly Argathakul despoiled Harvestshield Mountain, but I do.\" Laeral was born in {{Yearlink|765}}, giving the stated range from the late 8{{th}} to early 15{{th}} century DR. Laeral subsequently describes Argathakul as \"young for a dragon\", which might suggest a more recent date within this range. The dragon then claimed the mountain's summit as his lair.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[hobgoblin]] warlord [[Mrolgyet]] and his [[Mrolgyet's Legion|Legion]] claimed Chauntea's Citadel as their base of operation. From there, they proceeded to recruit or subdue local tribes in order to amass an army with which to wage war on the Lords' Alliance.\n\nJust as the Legion began to march its invasion force down the mountain, Laeral Silverhand sent a group of [[adventurer]]s alongside an army to counter them. The adventurers managed to sneak up on the enemy while the armies held the line, and ultimately the Legion was driven back to the Citadel. That was when Argathakul reappeared to assert his claim over the mountain, but the dragon was beaten back by the adventurers.",
        "Inhabitants": "The mountain was a habitat for [[owlbear]]s and [[chimera]]s. Gangs of [[troll]]s and tribes of [[ettin]]s were also known to live on or near the mountain. With the arrival of [[Mrolgyet's Legion]], the mountain became home to [[goblinoid]]s, [[giant]]kin, and [[gnoll]]s."
