Taliat was a small town found near the coast of the Great Sea in north Zakhara.
Taliat sat along the northern branch of Al-Faddi River roughly  northeast of mighty Qudra. The town was surrounded in lush cultivated land fed by the river and the few small unnamed lakes in the area. It was also found near a vital caravan trail that connected Qudra with the Free Cities of Zakhara in the north.
