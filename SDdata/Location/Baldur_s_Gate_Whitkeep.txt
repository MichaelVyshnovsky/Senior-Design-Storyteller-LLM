'''Whitkeep''' was a district in the [[Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It neighbored the districts of [[Norchapel]] and [[Sow's Foot]], though the exact borders of each region were regularly debated.

==Inhabitants==
The neighborhood was home to a sizable community of [[gnome]]s, many of whom worked as tinsmiths within the city.

As with many Outer City districts, Whitkeep had a problem with gang crime. The group known as [[Ganthall's Gallants]] regularly stole from Whitkeep's residents, but never targeted women.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Whitkeep Hostel]]: A large manor that attracted a significant number of radical-minded individuals.
