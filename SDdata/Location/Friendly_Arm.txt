The '''Friendly Arm''' was a walled hamlet on the [[Coast Way]] between [[Baldur's Gate]] and the town of [[Beregost]].

==Interior==
The most prominent building around the hamlet was the stone keep which housed the titular inn, which was run by [[Bentley Mirrorshade]]. This establishment was a popular stop for people traveling on the Coast Road. 

Apart from the inn, the wall surrounded a temple, a handful of houses, stables, and an accompanying horse pond.

==Atmosphere==
At the Friendly Arm, peace was secured by the guards, who insisted that all weapons be left at the gate and that all [[wizard]]s and [[cleric]]s tie one thumb to their belts.

==Services==
The Friendly Arm inn offered [[veal]] medallions served drenched in a sauce of [[caper]]s and [[cream]].

==History==
The keep was once the stronghold of an evil [[cleric]] of [[Bhaal]], but Bentley, [[Gellana Mirrorshade|Gellana]] and the rest of their adventuring party cleaned out the keep and renovated it.
