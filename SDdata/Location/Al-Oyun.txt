'''Al-Oyun''', also called '''The Eyes''', referred to a pair of islands found in the [[Genie's Turban]] archipelago in the [[Corsair Domains]] of [[northwest Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

Al-Oyun and [[Al-Anf]] were collectively referred to as the "Beauty Marks" by local [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]]. Ever distrustful of strangers, the corsairs would use the term as a form of password to test outsiders.

==Geography==
Both of these forested islands were similar in size, measuring {{SI|30|mi|k|long=yes}} in length and about {{SI|15|mi|k|long=yes}} in width. They were located very close to each other directly southeast of [[Chaos Bay]] and the much larger [[Island of Firethorns]]. Their position made them appear like "eyes" when viewing the larger scope of the Genie's Turban archipelago.
