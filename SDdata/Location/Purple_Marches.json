        "mainbody": "he Purple Marches was a duchy of western Tethyr known for the quality of its wines.\nThe Purple Marches were located on the coast between the Sulduskoon River and the River Ith and included the counties of Vintor, Bardshyr, and Elemetar. Myratma was the largest city the duchy claimed.\nThe southwestern part of the duchy, in County Vintor, was composed of rolling hills known as the Purple Hills. Where these met the Sea of Swords, there were treacherous cliffs called the Purple Cliffs. These names all came from the multitude of purple flowers growing in the region.\nIn 1369 DR, the Marches were ruled over by Duchess Marilyn Haresdown. Her estate was in the keep of Krennasar, though she was only there three months out of the year.\nThe region was first named by Calishites when they expanded their empire north beyond the River Ith (then the Wurlur) sometime before -2400  DR."
