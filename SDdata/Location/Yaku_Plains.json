        "mainbody": "The Yaku Plains, also known as the Plains of Ash or the Black Plains, was one of the two great plains of the Malatran Plateau, filled with choking ash and dust.\nThe Yaku Plains was a taboo region for the tribes of the Living Jungles. The plains once were rolling green hills and outcroppings of lush trees. By the 14 century DR, the Yaku Plains were filled with grey ashen hills and husks of long-dead trees. The Plains of Ash were surrounded by living jungles, but no plant life successfully spread its greenery into the grey lands. The chocking sickness was a sting disease that threatened anyone foolish enough to venture into the Plains of Ash.\nThe Plains of Ash were nestled at the eastern foothills of the Forbidden Mountains and northwest from the Sleepy Lake.\nThe ash plains did not support life, not a single plant could be found, nor a bird could be seen flying over it. All intelligent inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau, including jungle tamhi, never willingly entered the region. The only visitors to the barren plains were aspiring Nubari shamans and witch doctors who were brought here by their instructors to teach them ambiguous lessons of inherent human foolishness.\nNone of the Nubari or other sentient species within the Living Jungle seemed to remember how the lush plains were transformed into a burned-out husk. The tribal youths managed to find out that the cause was fire, but the elders showed no interest in sharing that story.\nDespite it being a wasteland, several mysterious deadly creatures inhabited the Yaku Plains, as well as the good and evil spirits of the Living Jungle. One such lesser jungle spirit was a baboon named Rafiki who dwelt on the border of the lush jungles and the Black Plains.\nYaku Plains were home to an earth spirit named Yaku, brother to Kuya. It was believed that the spirit left, or perished alongside the plains, leaving behind only pain in the land."
