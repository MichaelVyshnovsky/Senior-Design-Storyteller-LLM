The city was protected from the harsh winter storms that ravaged southern Dambrath, making it an ideal place for ships to anchor for the season.\nPrastuil was said to be the most beautiful city in all of Dambrath. Splendidly rich villas could be found outside of the city proper.\nA force of 1,000 elite cavalry protected the city. They were aided by numerous wizards and naval support from harboring ships.\nPrastuils population of 30,000â€“50,000 was truly mixed, including crinti, gnolls, halflings, arkaiuns, drow, dwarves, and even a few Zakharans\nWarchief Herald Markin, a loyal servant of Duchess Merial Luenath, ruled Prastuil."
