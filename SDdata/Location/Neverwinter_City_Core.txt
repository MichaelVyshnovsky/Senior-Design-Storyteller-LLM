The '''City Core''' was one of the districts of [[Neverwinter]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The City Core was connected to all the other districts of Neverwinter, and it was also the district where the city gates were located.

==History==
===Plague and War===
During the city's struggle with the [[Wailing Death]] in [[1372 DR]], the City Core was badly damaged during the war against [[Luskan]].

===Eruption===
When [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted in [[1451 DR]], bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, most of the City Core was left untouched by the pyroclastic flow. When [[Dagult Neverember]] began his efforts to rebuild Neverwinter, in the late years of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], he fused the City Core, the [[Peninsula District (Neverwinter)|Peninsula District]], and the Merchant Quarter into only one area. Eventually, the survivors of the cataclysm renamed this new area the [[Protector's Enclave]].
