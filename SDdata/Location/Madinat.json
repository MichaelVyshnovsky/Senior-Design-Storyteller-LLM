        "mainbody": "adinat, or the Round City, was the name of the main sector of the city of Dhaztanar in Semphar.\nMadinat sat next to the harbor of Furdah Rustauk. It was considered to be the heart of Dhaztanar. As the nickname of the Round City implied, Madinat formed a perfect circle. \nSurrounded by a moat and a strong outer and inner wall, Madinat was the most fortified section of the city. An open courtyard stretched behind the outer walls until it reached a third inner wall. This wall protected the houses of notable citizens, gardens, temples, and the palace of the caliph.\nFour gates in the walls, known as the Grand Bab, led to the Caliphs palace, the Dar al-Kalif."
