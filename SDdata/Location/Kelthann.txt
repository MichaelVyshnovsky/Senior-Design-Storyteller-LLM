'''Kelthann''' was an island in the [[Pirate Isles]].

It had few true pirates, owing to its close proximity to [[Sembia]], but it acted as a smuggling port, where goods could be transferred freely between parties without regulation or taxation. The [[human]] and [[halfling]] natives here worshiped [[Grumbar]].
