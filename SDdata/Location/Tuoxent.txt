'''Tuoxent''', the '''Seventh City of the Sword''', was one of the member cities in the confederated empire of [[Jhaamdath]].

==Geography==
The city of Tuoxent was on the western frontier of Jhaamdath's core below the [[Deepwing Mountains]].

==History==
Tuoxent was founded in {{Yearlink|-5250}}, as the seventh of the realm's major cities. It was paired with the construction of its twin city [[Hollinth]] that same year.

Jhaamdath entered into a short period of imperialistic expansion in the {{YearlinkName|-276}}, which resulted in the deforestation of the [[Chondalwood]] and the slaughter of the [[Nikerymath]] [[elves]]. The elves responded in the {{YearlinkName|-255}}, by casting a [[High Magic]] ritual that caused a huge wave from the [[Inner Sea]] to wash over the heartlands of Jhaamdath, all the way to distantly inland Tuoxent. The cities were drowned in the new [[Vilhon Reach]], and Tuoxent became a sunken ruin imbued with stray [[psionic]] energy from its lost relics.

The sunken realm of Jhaamdath was suddenly revealed by lowered sea levels following the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. The situation was then returned to its previous state in [[1486 DR]] by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]].
