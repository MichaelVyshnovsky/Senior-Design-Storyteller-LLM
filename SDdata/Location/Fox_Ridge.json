        "Geography": "The ridge was north of the temple of [[Chauntea]] and south of [[Storm Silverhand|Storm's]] Farm. The north side of Fox Ridge was a cliff about the height of an average human male. This cliff-side was pockmarked with cavern entrances ranging from burrows to small caverns.",
        "Rumors and legends": "It was said the caves on the north side of Fox Ridge led to an old tomb dating to before the times when Shadowdale was ruled by the [[drow]]. These caverns were used by [[adventurer]]s as a hiding place for weapons, [[gold]], food, and former comrades. Further past the tomb was a great cavern known as the [[Grinding Gulf]] where flying boulders cascaded in magical vertical dances.",
        "History": "Fox Ridge was named for the abundance of [[fox|foxes]] living here.",
