        "Background": "It was believed that there were at least different six entrances to this cave, located in various points of the Howling Mountains. Some also believed that the gemstones were in fact the severed fingers of a [[primordial]], because the gemstones moved on their own accord.",
        "History": "The cave was named for Glae Dorn, the presumed [[dwarf]] that first found the cave in ancient times.",
