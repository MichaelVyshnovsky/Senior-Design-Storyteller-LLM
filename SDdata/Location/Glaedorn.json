The cave was full of rich veins of metal ores and huge gemstones.\nIt was believed that there were at least different six entrances to this cave, located in various points of the Howling Mountains. Some also believed that the gemstones were in fact the severed fingers of a primordial, because the gemstones moved on their own accord.\nThe cave was named for Glae Dorn, the presumed dwarf that first found the cave in ancient times.\nCategoryLandmarks\nCategoryLocations on the Howling Mountains\nCategoryLocations in Fimbrul\nCategoryLocations in Laerakond\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations on Abeir\nCategoryLocations\n1ig70ha01iksyr0rlzdjwnyh3t6d5m5"
