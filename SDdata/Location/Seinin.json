        "mainbody": "'''Seinin''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. Its people made their living as fishers.",
        "Description": "Seinin was a particularly dirty and depressing village. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.\n\nThe people of Seinin were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. The village had a population of about 475 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.",
        "Geography": "Seinin was located on the [[Sea of Patience]] on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of the island of [[Tsukishima]]. It was located near the [[Momoben Forest]].",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a ''shoya'', typically a minor [[samurai]], and Seinin was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed. The ''shoya'' of Seinin after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was [[Toi Jujishiki]], who was a lazy man.",
        "Trade": "Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Seinin had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. The people were fishers, but there is no evidence that they traded in fish.\n\nThe village collected a \"visitor's tax\" of 1 [[yuan]] per person to enter. The cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 4 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 3 [[tael]] to sell.",
        "Defenses": "About 48 citizens of Seinin served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.\n\nThe village also was home to a band of [[Wa-an dictionary#K|''kabukimono'']], a group of retired warriors and [[ronin]] wearing colorful uniforms and calling themselves the [[Soldiers of Iron]]. The Soldiers of Iron had free reign to behave as they pleased in the village and often caused problems, especially when their members got drunk.",
        "Religion": "Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Seinin were strict followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]]. They were usually strongly opposed to anyone visiting their village who would not demonstrate devotion to the Path by making a donation to a shrine, reciting a prayer, or spitting on the symbol of [[Chauntea]], who was considered a heretical faith.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Abutsu]], a widow in the village who was witness to the murder of [[Toshi]].\n* [[Cho]], a man who moved into Toshi's old ''minka'' after her murder.\n* [[Ichi Krijiku]], the leader of the Soldiers of Iron.\n* Toshi, the ex-wife of samurai [[Osari Minhiro]].",
        "History": "Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]] began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.\n\nAs part of his plan, Za-Jikku sent servants dressed in golden robes to pay members of the Soldiers of Iron to kill several of the villagers and hand over their bodies to Za-Jikku for transformation."
