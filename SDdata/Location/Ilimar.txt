'''Ilimar''' was a long-ruined [[sarrukh]] city from the time of the empires of [[Isstosseffifil]] and [[Mhairshaulk]].

==Geography==
The ruins of Ilimar were magically split by a portal in the center into two sections, each located in a different part of [[Faer√ªn]]. on the eastern slopes of [[Muaroghal]], the mountains in eastern [[Halruaa]].

==Geography==
The city was overgrown and ruined.

==Inhabitants==
The northern section of the ruins was haunted by [[giant spider]]s and controlled by [[lamia noble]]s, who were descendants of the infamous lamia ruler of [[Westgate]], [[Nessmara]].

The southern ruined city was fearfully guarded by a group of [[spirit naga]]s The [[lizardfolk]] of the Great Swamp worshiped these nagas as gods

==History==
The city was originally constructed by the sarrukh, one of the [[creator race]]s, by a minor clan responsible for providing slaves to the empires of Isstosseffifil and Mhairshaulk.

Buried within the southern ruins of Ilimar were three sarrukh who had been hibernating since before the [[drow]] conquered [[Dambrath]]. These sleeping sarrukh were venerated as gods by the spirit nagas, who anxiously awaited the awaking.

In the {{YearlinkName|1231}}, an adventuring band called the [[Talons of Timindar]] unexpectedly discovered ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a moon-shaped [[spellbook]] sacred to [[Mielikki]], within the ruins of Ilimar, after battling the [[naga]]s, [[lamia]], and spiders. Oddly, they found it hovering in the air in the middle of a tower-top room that was scorched by flame, with broken windows and broken bodies all around, as if blasted by an explosion, possibly a ''[[fireball]]'' spell.
