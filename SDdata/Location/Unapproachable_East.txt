The '''Unapproachable East''' was a region of [[Northeast Faerûn|northeast]] and [[east Faerûn]]. The boundaries were usually defined as [[Easting Reach]] in the west, [[Sunrise Mountains]] in the east, [[Wizards' Reach]] in the south, and the [[Icerim Mountains]] in the north, right up to the [[Great Glacier]]. The region was bordered to the south by the [[Old Empires]], and to the north by the [[Cold Lands]]. To the northeast was the [[Hordelands]].

==Realms==
===Aglarond===
{{Main|Aglarond}}
Aglarond was an autocratic kingdom in the southwestern-most part of the Unapproachable East, with the capital of [[Velprintalar]]. It was a peninsula bordered on the west by the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and Altumbel and on the east by Thay. Most of its land was covered by the [[Yuirwood]]. Filled with magic and mystery, it was ruled by one of the most potent spellcasters of the Realms, the [[Simbul]]. In the north were the [[Dragonjaw Mountains]]. The population was mostly [[humans]], who made up the nearly 1.3 million inhabitants, though one-third were [[half-elves]] and a fair number of [[elves]].

Aglarond was once constantly fending off attacks from Thay, but a cease-fire led to brisk trade between the two nations around [[1372 DR]].

===Altumbel===
{{Main|Altumbel}}
Altumbel was a "sub-peninsula", that is, a peninsula's peninsula or cape, located at the western end of the peninsula of Aglarond. Its capital was [[Spandeliyon]], and the reclusive inhabitants distrusted non-humans. Its economy was mostly fishing.

===The Great Dale===
{{Main|The Great Dale}}
The Great Dale was governed by a [[druid]]ic hierarchy, under the rule of the [[Nentyarch]]. It was a human land of 200,000 inhabitants.

===Impiltur===
{{Main|Impiltur}}
Impiltur was a kingdom of 1,200,000 inhabitants, mainly humans, but also [[dwarves]] and [[halflings]], who were ruled by the regent queen [[Sambryl]] from the capital of [[Lyrabar]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

===Rashemen===
{{Main|Rashemen}}
Rashemen was a land of 650,000 people, almost all humans. It was ruled from the capital of [[Immilmar]], where the ruler called the [[Iron Lord]] resided, but the true power in Rashemen were the famous [[Witches of Rashemen]]. In addition to the witches, Rashemen was also known for its berserker warriors and spirits that protect the land.

===Thay===
{{Main|Thay}}
Thay was a magocracy of the dreaded [[Red Wizards]]. The coastal part of Thay was the [[Priador]]. Thay was constantly warring with its neighbors. Thayans were infamous for being [[slaver]]s, a practice illegal in other lands.

===Thesk===
{{Main|Thesk}}
Thesk was a region consisting of 850,000 people, inhabited by [[humans]], [[gnomes]], and [[orcs]], with no official capital, though the city-state of [[Phsant]] commonly filled that role. It was economically dependent on the city-state of [[Telflamm]] and [[Kara-Tur]]an goods shipped from the far east.

Telflamm was a large city-state and a port. Its approximately 23,500 inhabitants were under the rule of a "merchant prince", though behind the scenes it was the [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm]], a thieves guild, that ran the city.

===Ashanath===
{{Main|Ashanath}}
Ashanath was a minor kingdom east of the Great Dale and Thesk, south of [[Narfell]] and north of Thay. Its capital city [[Shandaular]] was destroyed in {{Yearlink|-946}}.<ref> Despite its fertile lands, it was mostly unsettled.
