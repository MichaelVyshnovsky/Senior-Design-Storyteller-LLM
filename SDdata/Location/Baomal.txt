'''Baomal''' was the capital city of [[Hmurrath]], a [[merfolk]] empire on the [[Hmur Plateau]] beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==History==
Baomal fell to ruin after the fall of the Hmurrath empire in {{YearlinkConvert|820|TS}}.<ref><ref group="note" name="date">It's erroneously stated on page 139 that Hmurrath somehow both fell in {{YearlinkConvert|794|TS}} and during the [[Fifth Ser么s War]], both unrelated to the Hmurrath Civil Wars that were the [[Tenth Ser么s War]]. Because of this, the end date of the Tenth Ser么s War can be considered the more accurate one. Over the years various scavengers and [[engineer]]s from farms or villages in the surrounding area would pick away at the city's [[coral]] and stone structures, seeking to repurpose the materials for their own settlements. By {{YearlinkConvert|1440|TS}}, very little of the once proud capital remained as a result of this practice.
