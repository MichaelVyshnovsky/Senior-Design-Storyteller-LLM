        "mainbody": "The '''Akanal''', also known as the '''Akanul''' and the '''Akanul Plains''', was a stretch of land in southwestern [[Chessenta]], famed as being among the most fertile farmland anywhere in the [[Realms]].<ref>",
        "Geography": "The Akanal comprised the peninsula between the [[Akanamere]]'s western and southern arms and the lands around the lake's southern shore.  The east and south were bordered by the [[Hills of Maerth]].",
        "Government": "''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], the settlements of the Akanal paid tribute to the city-state of [[Akanax]] on a regular basis.",
        "Trade": "The Akanal boasted incredibly fertile and productive farmland, and was the best in Chessenta and the [[Old Empires]] and among the finest in all of [[Faerûn]]. The lands around the Akanamere were planted with cash crops in large plantations. Their produce was shipped to Akanax and [[Soorenar]], and from there to [[Airspur]], [[Cimbar]], and [[Reth]], and all in all provided more than half of Chessenta's food supply.",
        "History": "The Akanal and surrounding foothills were the prehistoric homeland of the [[Turami]] people whilst they were still tribal hunter-gatherers.\n\nTwo decades after its founding around {{Yearlink|-5800}}, the empire of [[Jhaamdath]] maintained outposts in the Akanal, marking its easternmost edge. After its southern and western expansion was halted in {{Yearlink|-5005}}, Jhaamdath pushed east into the Akanal, meeting and absorbing the Turami there as an underclass of laborers and field hands.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1504}}, the forces of [[Unther]] broke through Jhaamdath's Akana frontier and, by {{Yearlink|-1499}}, they controlled the Akanal and the empire's eastern half. This continued until a Jhaamdathan counterattack in {{Yearlink|-1069}}, and it remained a Jhaamdathan possession until the empire's collapse in the {{YearlinkName|-255}}.\n\nBy the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the lands of the Akanal had been cultivated for hundreds of years, and they had been fought over just as long. In fact, a good number of the conflicts fought in Chessenta were actually waged over control of the Akanal and access to its produce.",
        "Notable Locations": "It was ringed by the towns of [[Gaj]], [[Villon]], and [[Oslin]]."
