        "mainbody": "The '''Dwarven Valley''' was a deep rift in [[Icewind Dale]], located along the southern slopes of the mountain called [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. Within the valley was a complex network of tunnels, subterranean passages and mines that composed the home of the dale's dwarves, particularly those from [[Clan Battlehammer]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Geographical Features": "The valley held two dwarven halls, dug into the western and eastern walls. Each holding comprised their respective living quarters, dining areas, storerooms, armories,\n\nBeyond the dwarfholds was a vast tunnel system that continued out into a number of mines. Some of these were abandoned, as the valuable ore found within had been entirely dug up.",
        "History": "In the midâ€”14{{th}} century [[DR]], the dwarves of the valley managed to draw the [[wizard]] [[Akar Kessell]] and his forces within their southern tunnels. They proceeded to collapse the tunnels on them all, killing many and stopping their invasion of Icewind Dale.\n\nIn the years that followed, many of the dwarves from Clan Battlehammer left the valley and re-settled in the home of their lineage.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the community of dwarves was divided into two factions. Those that followed the community's long-standing leader, [[Stokely Silverstream]], and those under the influence of [[Baerick Hammerstone]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* Cragdrop: This precarious switchback, at the northern mouth of the valley, led up to the tundra of Icewind Dale.\n* [[Battlehammer Hold]]: Named after their ancestral clan, these halls in the valley's western wall housed about 80 dwarves.\n* [[Halls of Black Ice]]: Located on the opposite side of the rift, these passageways held the stores of ''black ice'' found by Hammerstone's dwarves.\n* Temple: Located in the eastern hold, this sacred place venerated the four major deities of the [[Morndinsamman]]: [[Moradin]], [[Berronar Truesilver]], [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], and [[Dumathoin]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to the dwarves of the hall, dark forces dwelled within the valley's southern tunnels. The [[undead]] Akar Kessel' remained within, having raised a small horde of dwarven [[zombie]]s."
