Gapapurang was a town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.
Gapapurang produced weapons, armor pieces, and custom metalwork such as winches and hoisting collars used in construction. There were supplied to the capital Ranguri and the temples of the Lords of Creation. The city was home to a number of metalworking guilds and foundries, many of which were subsidized by the temples.
Many of the gems mined at Patayang were transported through Gapapurang to Ranguri.
In the midâ€“14 century DR, Gapapurang was plagued by nat spirits, which originated from Visrana.
