Sumuk Island was an island within the Golden Gulf of interior Zakhara.
Sumuk Island sat approximately  offshore due west of the mainland near the city of Itiraf and the Cities of the Pantheon region. Sumuk Island was  long and  wide. Two smaller islands lay off of its north shore. Coral reefs surrounded these unamed islands. An ancient ruined mosque was located on the southeast coast of Sumuk Island in 1367 DR.
