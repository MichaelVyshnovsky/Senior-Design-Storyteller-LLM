        "mainbody": "'''Carcathen''' was a small western island in the [[Nelanther Isles]]. The shoreline was riddled with caves and there were no noticeable ports on its shores. The naval approach island was rather treacherous, so many sailors of the region avoided going here. A winding path between the north and east shores could easily lead a less skilled captain to run their ship aground.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "A single port is known only to the pirate captains of the region. The port is hidden inside a massive cavern hidden by an illusion-cloaked entrance.  The port has enough room for four large ships to dock. [[Raurivyl Ornshield]], along with his crew of the [[Scimitar of Fire]], used the port as a hideout for a few months in [[1370 DR]]."
