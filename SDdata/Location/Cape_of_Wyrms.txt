The Cape of Wyrms, also called Wyrmtail, or simply the Tail, in the ages past, was a small peninsula in the Vilhon Reach region.
The Cape of Wyrms was located at the long outcropping at the northern end of the Akanapeaks, north of the city-state of Reth and northwest across the mountains from Airspur.
Before the 14 century DR, the peninsula was just known as the Tail, until the early 1300s DR. During that time, many sea caves of the Tail hid clutches of black dragon eggs, that, eventually hatched and black dragon youths exploded into a conflict. The wyrms fighting extended into the surrounding territories, and locals started calling the promontory the Cape of Wyrms.
