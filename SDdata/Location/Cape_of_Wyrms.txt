The '''Cape of Wyrms''', also called '''Wyrmtail''', or simply '''the Tail''', in the ages past, was a small peninsula in the [[Vilhon Reach]] region.

==Description==
The Cape of Wyrms was located at the long outcropping at the northern end of the [[Akanapeaks]], north of the city-state of [[Reth]] and northwest across the mountains from [[Airspur]].

==History==
Before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the peninsula was just known as the Tail, until the early 1300s DR. During that time, many sea caves of the Tail hid clutches of [[black dragon]] [[egg]]s, that, eventually hatched and black dragon youths exploded into a conflict. The wyrms' fighting extended into the surrounding territories, and locals started calling the promontory the Cape of Wyrms.
