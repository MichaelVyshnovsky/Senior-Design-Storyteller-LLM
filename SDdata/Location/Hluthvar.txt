'''Hluthvar''' ({{Pronounce|heh|LUTH|var|refs=}}) was a walled town on the [[Dusk Road]] in the [[Sunset Vale]], east of the [[Reaching Woods]] and west of the [[Sunset Mountains]].

==History==
Hluthvar was named for a local warrior-hero. It has been said to lie in the shadow of the Darkhold and has long been seen as more of a fortress against the Zhentarim than an actual trading town.
