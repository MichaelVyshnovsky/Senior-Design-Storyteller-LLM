Hluthvar () was a walled town on the Dusk Road in the Sunset Vale, east of the Reaching Woods and west of the Sunset Mountains.
Hluthvar was named for a local warrior-hero. It has been said to lie in the shadow of the Darkhold and has long been seen as more of a fortress against the Zhentarim than an actual trading town.
