        "mainbody": "The Plaguechanged Warrens, also known as the Spellplague Caverns, were a series of subterranean tunnels located in the Chasm of Neverwinter.\nThe Plaguechanged Warrens were a honeycomb of tunnels connected to breeding pits, used by the Abolethic Sovereignty to create plaguechanged horrors by using the Symphony of Madness. The tunnels also connected the Twisted Fane with the Cauldron of Blue Fire.\nThe Warrens were home to thousands of plaguechanged creatures.\nAt some point in the late years of the 15 century DR, the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge had to descend into the Warrens to search clues about the Cloaked Ascendancy."
