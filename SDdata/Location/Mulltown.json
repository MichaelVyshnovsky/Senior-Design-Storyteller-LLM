        "mainbody": "Mulltown was a small village in Impiltur which was popular among travelers. It was the first Impilturian stop along the Merchants Run headed south from Damara.\nSituated just east of the Rawlinswood, Mulltown was ideally located to provide commercial support for the larger city-states of Impiltur.\nThe village was well-defended to provide security for overnight visitors and traveling merchants. Soldiers from Ilmwatch would regularly patrol the days-long route from the Easting Reach to Mulltown in order to keep it and the other towns along Merchants Run safe.\nFine inns and skilled smithies were common features in the village, helping to cater to the many travelers who passed through."
