Dragonscar Gorge was a treacherous and monster-infested area within the Frozenfar. It was known as a path through the North, but one which was travelled only by the desperate or foolhardy.
The Gorge was bitingly cold, so much that the cold was said to be elemental in nature. The terrain was rough and full of rubble, with evidence of mighty giant ruins poking through the permanent snows. It appeared desolate and empty, but this belied the many monsters who dwelt there.
It was said that the Gorge was carved by mighty battles between frost giants and white dragons in the distant past. These battles were triggered when the giants constructed Thrymstone, a massive fortress intended to challenge the local dragons directly. According to legend, the fortress was built by a frost giant known as Shattercrown with the aid of the giant god Thrym. At the climax of the Dragonscar Gorge war, the two sides were nearly wiped out when the white dragons exhausted their strength to create an avalanche so massive that it destroyed Thrymstone and left it lost beneath the snows. Its existence soon became regarded as a legend.
In the late 15 century DR, Shattercrown began a single-minded campaign to reclaim Thrymstone. He and his giants coerced the Frosthunger Horde (consisting of goblins, bugbears, and gnolls) to seize the Gorge and excavate the ancient fortress. After years of hard labor, a large contingent of the Frosthunger Horde attempted to escape from the giants, resulting in them pouring into the neighboring Shimmersky Valley where their attacks drew the attention of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep, who sent adventurers to investigate. At the same time, the efforts to reclaim Thrymstone attracted the attention of Kovanyrach, a powerful white dragon descended from the dragons who originally destroyed the fortress. Kovanyrach accomplished the rare feat of organizing his fellow white dragons in the region to stop Shattercrowns ambitions. When word of the impending clash between the frost giants and white dragons reached Laeral, she feared their battles could draw in other giants and mightier dragons, eventually spiraling out of control and threatening Faer√ªn more widely. She thus ordered her adventurers to intercede, and so they drove off Kovanyrach outside of Thrymstone, thus allowing the giants to finish excavating the main gates and finally gaining access to the fortress. However, the adventurers pursued them and defeated Shattercrowns lieutenant, Horrengar, before confronting and defeating Shattercrown himself. The remaining white dragons then chased the surviving giants into the far reaches of Draginscar Gorge as the Frosthunger Horde scattered.

Dragonscar Gorge was too inhospitable to host any permanent settlements. Even so, some bandits and raiders were known to operate out of the area, most notably the Frosthunger Horde, a force of goblinoids and white-furred gnolls. The local goblins and bugbears were pale, and were often led by shamans known as Chillsparkers.
The Gorge was also home to many hostile monsters, including snowy owlbears, ice mephits, bheur hags, and white dragons. It was also the main hunting grounds of the Wintergnaw pack of winter wolves. The presence of these many hostile inhabitants prompted most travelers to avoid the area by passing through nearby Shimmersky Valley.
