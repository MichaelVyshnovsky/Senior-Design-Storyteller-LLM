The Gates of Sule were twin pillars of stone near the southern edge of Raurin, close to the Dustwall Mountains. The Sandvoyagers Track passed between these monoliths.
Apparently natural, the two rocks rested on each other, slanted at odd angles they were pockmarked, eroded by the environment. The pillars carried an inscription cursing those who entered unbidden. However, there were sinkholes on both sides of the gap between the stones those who tried to go around them were in deadly risk of being sucked under the sand.
