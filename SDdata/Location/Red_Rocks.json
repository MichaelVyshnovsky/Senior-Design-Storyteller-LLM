        "Description": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The waters around the rocky islets were home to a diverse population of [[fish]] and shellfish. Many of these were prized in Waterdeep, so fishers in small boats braved these waters to harvest them."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "All manner of nasty aerial creatures dwelt atop and alongside the Red Rocks, several shrieks of [[harpies]] and swoops of [[peryton]]s, and at least one known [[manticore]]. The waters below were home to a pack of [[seawolves]].",
        "History": "Throughout the centuries, the Red Rocks were responsible for the sinking of countless ships. Most sailors of larger ships steered well clear of their location.\n\nA local legend claimed that the fortress known as [[Black Logan's Keep]] on one of the islets was built by one [[Black Logan]], supposedly a peer of an early warlord of Waterdeep, but it wasn't specified which. The two came into conflict, Black Logan escaped to his island keep, and the warlord's army laid siege to it for over a year. Finally, Black Logan suffered [[heartstop]] and died and his troops tossed the body off the wall as a sign of surrender.\n\n''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], the manticore of the Red Rocks allied with the seawolves to make the northern isles their hunting grounds, forcing fishermen to avoid that area entirely.\n\nAbout a year before the set of rules that governed the various [[giant]] races known as the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] was abolished, ''circa'' [[1485 DR]], the corpse of the [[storm giant]] Queen [[Neri]] was discovered amongst the Red Rocks by Imperator [[Uthor]]. The queen's death was greatly upsetting to the royal storm giant family, especially King [[Hekaton]], and set in motion a series of events that altered the giant populations of [[the North]].",
