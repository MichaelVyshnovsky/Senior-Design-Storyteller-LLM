The '''Dang Caverns''' were a series of caves lying beneath the northeastern [[Ziyero Ridge]] in [[Koryo]].

==Description==
The caverns were vast and extensive with hundreds of levels. They were also hundreds of ways to enter them, or to exit them.<ref group="note">The text refers only to a single tunnel, but also mentions hundreds of entrances, so this is assumed to be in error and that there are multiple tunnels.

==History==
According to legend, the entire [[Han people|Han clan]] sought shelter in the vast Dang Caverns when the [[Kanko]] volcano rose up out of [[Kang Bay]] and erupted, raining fire over the land.

The [[wizard]] [[Cho Lu-k'u]] died in the Dang Caverns and cursed the tunnels, seemingly leading to the monsters that lurked there.The text states only that Cho Lu-k'u cursed the tunnel ''and'' it harbors monsters. There is no direct cause-and-effect relation between these statements, but their proximity implies a connection.

Around [[1350 DR]], the [[king of Silla]] and former emperor of Koryo abdicated his throne amidst a naval catastrophe. He and his most loyal supporters escaped to the Dang Caverns.

==Inhabitants==
The tunnels were reported to be home to evil monsters that hid from the light.

At times, however, regular [[Koryoan]] [[human]]s were more likely to dwell in the caverns. In prehistoric times, the Han people sheltered there, and later, in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ex-king of Silla and his supporters made a base there. Often, brigands also hid in the caves to avoid the authorities.
