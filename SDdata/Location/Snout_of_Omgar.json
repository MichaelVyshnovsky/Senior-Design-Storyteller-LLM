        "mainbody": "The Snout of Omgar was an island off the southeastern coast of Chult. In the late 15 century DR, it was predominantly inhabited by tortles.\nThe northwest portion of the island was relatively flat and covered by rain forest. The forest ended at grassy hills at its northern tip, which ended at the crag of High Horn and was the site of several shipwrecks, while its eastern and western coasts were marked by sandy beaches. The southern portion of the island was mountainous and marked by volcanoes and caves.\nBefore the Spellplague, the Snout of Omgar was a mountainous peninsula within Samarach. With the violent changes brought by the Spellplague, a narrow strait formed between the mainland and the Snout, separating it from Chult and turning it into a large island.\nSoon after the islands formation, tortles living nearby claimed it as their domain, taking advantage of the natural protection offered by the strait against predators.\n* Ahoyhoy, the only settlement on the island, inhabited by tortles.\n* Dangwaru, or the Typhoon Palace, a dilapidated, haunted palace built by the tortles for the crew of a wrecked ship.\n* High Horn, a statue depicting a famous tortle.\nThe original peninsula was named after the great sea serpent Omgar."
