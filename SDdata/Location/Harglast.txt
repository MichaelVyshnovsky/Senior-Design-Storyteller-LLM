'''Harglast''' was a spartan stone city and one of the [[Windrise Ports]] of [[Laerakond]].

==Government==
Harglast was ruled by a Lord Merchant. In [[1479 DR]], the Lord Merchant was the [[dragonborn]] [[Belror Tethel]].

==Economy==
Stonecrafts and dried figs were the major local exports.

==Architecture==
Harglast was mostly composed of stone buildings made by [[dwarves]], that had an sturdy and practical appearance. The city also had an extensive network of catacombs, [[sewer]]s, and secret passages that served as sanitation, avenues for efficient troop movement, and covert meeting locales. Some of the deepest catacombs were connected to the [[Abeiran Underdark|Upperdark]].

==Inhabitants==
Harglast's population was mostly made up by dragonborn and dwarves, with a minority of humans.

==Culture==
===Religion===
Religion was uncommon in Harglast, like in the rest of the Windrise Ports, and the following of minor cults dedicated to the [[Dawn Titans]] or to [[dragon]]s, as well as general superstition, were more universal than worshiping the [[gods]], that were a novelty introduced in [[Laerakond]] since the [[Blue Breath of Change]].

However, thanks to their cosmopolitan nature and their trade with Faer√ªn, the cities of the Windrise Ports were more open to the concepts of religion and the gods than other places of Laerakond. Although there was no preferred religion among the inhabitants of Harglast, the most influential religions established in the Windrise Ports were the faiths of [[Bahamut]], [[Sune]], [[Tempus]], [[Tiamat]], [[Umberlee]], [[Valkur]], [[Vergadain]], and [[Waukeen]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|50-52}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Building the Pyre|41}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|52}}
