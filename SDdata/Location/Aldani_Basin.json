        "mainbody": "The Aldani Basin was a huge, swampy drainage basin in the middle of the jungles of Chult.\nThis upland basin was surrounded on all sides by high plateaus and had multiple secluded lakes where its waters gathered. The central region of the basin was swampland, surrounded by thick foliage. The basin was large enough to be seen with the naked eye as a gap in the jungle canopy from 20 miles away if one stood atop the Firefinger, a 300-foot tall natural rock formation.\nThe Aldani Basin The basin was a favored feeding ground for all kinds of dinosaurs and biting insects.\nThe basin received its name from the Aldani, \"lobsterfolk\", living there and in the two major rivers flowing from it. At one time, they lived in the rivers, but in later years, they had retreated back to the lakes.\nThe village of Mbala sat on one of the high plataus overlooking the basin from the northwest. After the Spellplague, an earthmote known as the Heart of Ubtao floated around two hundred feet above the basin, which could only be seen through the marsh fog at rare times when the sky was clear.\nA few miles north of the Aldani Basin, along the River Soshenstar, was the location of Camp Vengeance, a small settlement established by the Order of the Gauntlet.\nMany Chultans had been told stories of the aldani that lived in the rivers of the basin, but by the late 15 century DR, no reliable witnesses had spotted any for decades, and it was believed by most that the race was extinct.\nIn the 15 century, an acolyte of Savras began receiving visions of red-robed wizards operating out of a secret base in the basin."
