        "mainbody": "'''Iyrandrar''' (also seen as '''Lyrandrar'''<ref group=\"note\">The cited source uses Lyrandrar in the subheading of the article but all other occurrences of the proper name use a capital <code>I</code> and not a capital <code>L</code>. Therefore, the subheading is probably a typographical error.) was a realm of isolationist [[gold elves]] in the [[Chondalwood]], ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].{{Cite dragon/267/The New Adventures of Volo: Onward!|81-82}}",
        "Geography": "Iyrandrar was located in a branch of the Chondalwood that jutted between the [[Maerthwatch]] mountains to the north and west, and the [[Adder Peaks]] to the southeast.",
        "Government": "The seat of government was a council called the [[Ardreth]], made up of about twelve individuals from the nobility, or Elder Lords. The Lord Speaker of the Ardreth was traditionally an old male [[warrior]] that was famous for past deeds. He was just the mouthpiece for the Ardreth, not a serving member. The Lord Speaker's other role was as a judge in matters that were not otherwise settled by duels to the death. Below the nobility were the Lords that held sway over an enclave, garrison, or settlement within Iyrandrar.\n\n[[File:Dragon267-Ron Spencer-Iyrandrar-banner.png|thumb|right|300px|''The coat of arms of Iyrandrar.'']]\nThe heraldry of Iyrandrar was a gold field with a horizontal brown tree limb sprouting green buds or leaves to the left. To the right the branch changed to a black [[falcon]]'s claw with grasping talons.",
        "Trade": "Iyrandrar had very little contact with the outside world, but a few individuals did trade [[rubies]] and [[sapphire]]s from their [[gem]] mines for hardware and other objects made of metal for the colony.",
        "Defenses": "Mounted patrols at least thirty strong zealously guarded the border of this realm. They were equipped with [[dart]] guns, [[sword]]s, and included powerful [[wizard]]s that typically relied on their spells rather than [[magic item]]s. Iyrandrii were known to hunt even other [[elves]] that dared to intrude uninvited.\n\nEveryone carried a dart gun, even children and youths, and they were used to hunt small game. The darts were dipped in a venom that caused paralysis.",
        "Society": "It was primarily the elders who were xenophobic, living easy lives of luxury. The younger generation were actually sent out to explore [[Faerûn]] for a time and learn about \"the world outside\". They were expected to come back with new knowledge, ideas, and items, mundane and magical."
