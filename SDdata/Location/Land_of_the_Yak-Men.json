        "mainbody": "The Land of the Yak-Men was the term for the geographical region controlled by the Yikarian Empire in 1367 DR.\nThe southwestern arm of the World Pillar Mountains extended south into Zakhara from the junction of the continents of Faer√ªn and Kara-Tur with the Land of Fate. Most, if not all, of this arm of the vast mountain range fell under the domain of the Yikarian Empire. Additionally, their reach extended down the slopes of the mountains into the far northeastern reaches of Zakhara at the border with Konigheim and the Utter East.\nFrom a Zakharans standpoint, the Land of the Yak-Men abutted the forbidding desert wasteland known as the Haunted Lands. Due east it abutted the Jungle of Monsters.\nIn addition to the yak-folk who dominated the land, several other creatures could be found wandering the terrain. These included snow leopards, yetis, mountain goats, musk oxen, and even a few humans.\n* Nathong\n* Lipo\n* The Gate of Heaven"
