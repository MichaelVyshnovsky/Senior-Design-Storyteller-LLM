Additionally, their reach extended down the slopes of the mountains into the far northeastern reaches of Zakhara at the border with [[Konigheim]] and the [[Utter East]].\n\nFrom a [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan's]] standpoint, the Land of the Yak-Men abutted the forbidding desert wasteland known as the [[Haunted Lands]].
