        "mainbody": "Its name came from huge quantities of wheat fields found throughout the land.\nThis land was once known for its vast wheat fields, but in 1385 DR the Spellplague came, and Var the Golden sank beneath the waves. By 1479 DR, this area was a drowned land of silt-covered fields and ruined towns and villages. The ruins were stalked by its insane former ruler, Anwir Dupretiskava.\nThe capital was Pyratar. The city of Zelpir was a famed crafts spot. The \"mouth\" linking Var to the Great Sea was the Sunstrait through the city Myrmyr. The Isle of Ships resided to Vars northeast. The city of Vaelen beyond Vars most northwest hosted a Shou Town. The Curna Mountains isolated most of Var from the lands of Southeast Faer√ªn.\nOther locations were Des and Durgach."
