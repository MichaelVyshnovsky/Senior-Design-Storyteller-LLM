        "mainbody": "The Forest of Wyrms, known as Sskowlynraa by the yuan-ti, was a dark and dangerous forest found in the Western Heartlands.\nThe air in the forest was cool and damp, and mists covered some areas of the ground. \nThe Forest of Wyrms was located between the Serpent Hills and the Trielta Hills, just south of the Winding Water river.\nIt contained many pines and tall redwood trees, some with trunks more than  in diameter. There was not much vegetation on the forest floor and the terrain was mostly smooth. Helmthorn brush grew dense in the forest.\nBefitting its name, the forest was home to great many species of poisonous and constrictor snakes.\nThe forest was once part of the elven realm of Shantel Othreier.\nCirca the midâ€“14 century DR. adventurers and Harpers sometimes journeyed into the forest to battle the lich at Lyrans Hold.\nAn ancient sarrukh city within the forest once held an artifact known as the Naja Fountain.\n* Lyrans Hold was a warded tower created by the wizard Lyran.\n* Ssthartissssun, one of the most ancient set of ruins in all the Realms.\n* Thlohtzin, the former fortress of a lich that was then taken over by yuan-ti.\n* The lair of Tharaskalagram, a red dragon that lived in a small volcano.\nThe forests name was derived from the population of green dragons who inhabited the eastern side of the forest. They tended not to stray too close to the western side because of the proximity of Soubar and the likelihood of encountering adventurers nearby, but some younger or bolder dragons were found in this area. Dragon slayers ventured into the forest to hunt these great beasts,\nOther creatures are also known to lair within the forest, including giant rhinoceros beetles, hill giants, sword spiders, stirges, behirs, hydras, and wyverns.\n* Agyrtclughwaur, the green wyrm.\n* Rylatarralahtyma, the mature female red dragon.\n* Morentherene, the green dragon half-sister of the half-dragon Ziatar.\n* Terpenzi, a great dark naga that led a population of ophidians in the forest circa the fall of Netheril.\n* Ralionate, an ancient green dragon apparently not aligned with the yuan-ti, made this forest her lair."
