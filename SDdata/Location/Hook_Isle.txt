'''Hook Isle''' was a hook-shaped island that was part of the [[Nelanther Isles]], located south of the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]]. The island was southeast of [[Nemessor]] and just to the north of [[Thordentor]].

==Notable Locations==
The [[Bay of Skulls]] was the bay near the center of the island that gave the island it's noticeable crescent or hook shape.

==History==
In [[1360 DR]], the [[Wyrmskull Throne]] was discovered here briefly by pirates taking shelter in the Bay of Skulls. It was lost again shortly after.
