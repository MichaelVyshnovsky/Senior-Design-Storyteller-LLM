Fox Ridge was a rise of ground on the east side of the Ashaba in Shadowdale.
The ridge was north of the temple of Chauntea and south of Storms Farm. The north side of Fox Ridge was a cliff about the height of an average human male. This cliff-side was pockmarked with cavern entrances ranging from burrows to small caverns. 
It was said the caves on the north side of Fox Ridge led to an old tomb dating to before the times when Shadowdale was ruled by the drow. These caverns were used by adventurers as a hiding place for weapons, gold, food, and former comrades. Further past the tomb was a great cavern known as the Grinding Gulf where flying boulders cascaded in magical vertical dances.
Fox Ridge was named for the abundance of foxes living here.
