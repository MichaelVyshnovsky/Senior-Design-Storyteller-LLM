        "mainbody": "The '''Dragonwall''' was a giant wall located on the eastern edge of the [[Quoya Desert]] along the border with [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "Thousands of miles long, the wall was built with brick and stone. The spirit of the [[dragon]] [[Pao Hu Jen]] inhabited the wall, making it invulnerable to anything but magical siege weaponry.\n\nThe dragon's spirit could be freed through sacrifice. When freed, the wall crumbled and had to be rebuilt. The dragon could be talked with if the proper communication magic was used.\n\nThe wall was protected by a large number of men and fortifications, along with infrequent patrols. A one-man guard tower with a signal fire was placed every mile, every {{SI|10|mi|k}} was a blockhouse with 100 men, and every {{SI|50|mi|k}} was a gate house with 1,000 men. Most of these men were poorly trained, and corruptly led, as the strength of the dragon wall had lulled Shou Lung into believing they were invulnerable.\n\nIt was the only artificial structure on [[Toril]] that could be seen from [[wildspace|space]].",
        "History": "The Dragonwall was breached by the [[Tuigan Horde]] in [[1359 DR]] near [[Lo Tu]]. The Tuigan armies were then able to march into [[Ching Tung]] in Shou Lung.\n\nIn [[1385 DR]], the Dragonwall was destroyed during the [[Spellplague]] and the spirit of Pao Hu Jen was released from its imprisonment."
