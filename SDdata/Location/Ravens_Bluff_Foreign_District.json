The Gardens first appear in ''Nightwatch in the Living City'', prior to which there were no mentions of any sort of Foreign ward in the city. They are both described as areas with tall stone walls that house dignitaries. And in the module ''Vengeance'', on a chart of distances between \"districts\" within the city, the Gardens were included whilst the Foreign District was not. This same chart also showed the Gardens as being similarly adjacent to the Harbor and Temple districts. was a quiet, walled-off region of the city that was home to the embassies and consulates of a number of foreign nations and powers.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The main feature of the district was [[Daren's Ring]], a circular road that enveloped [[Ring Park]] and extended to [[Fireleap Lane]] which continued eastward into the city. The roads that curved away from the Ring were nameless ornate topiaries and decorative lawns that were quite appealing, despite the lack of passers-by to appreciate the tranquil scenery."
        },
        "Law & Order": "The district was heavily patrolled by members of the the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] and the [[Griffon Guard]]. It was notably the only district in the city to lack a district barracks for the City Watch. Additionally, each of the embassies within its walls were staffed with their own guards.\n\nThe embassies within the district represented the native soil and the laws of their home countries, thus allowing for people to be punished under each diplomats' respective laws.{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|13}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Eye of Horus|4}} In some cases, this could mean that entering an embassy without an invitation could be punishable by death.\n\nNon-residents of the district generally had to have some form of invitation in order to enter.",
        "History": "Back when it was known as the Gardens, the first embassies to be set up in the district were meant to be only temporary housing for diplomats traveling to Ravens Bluff to open up new trade routes.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Gardens\" />",
        "Notable locations": {
            "Embassies": "The foreign district held a number of embassies from which representatives of nations around [[Faerûn]] would conduct their business within the city.\n*[[Calaglara]]: The embassy house of [[Calimshan]] looked like an enlarged child's toy castle.\n*[[Cormyr House]]: The impressive consulate of the [[Cormyr|Forest Kingdom]] was located on the southern side of the ward, next to the house of [[Kile|Sir Kile the Ox]].\n*'''Embassy of Aglarond:''' The embassy of [[Aglarond]].\n*[[Embassy of Amn]]: A palatial manor whose design evoked the opulence of the ''[[Athkatla|City of Coin]]''.\n*[[Embassy of Chessenta]]: The beauty of this pink-marble, domed structure was heightened by its lush gardens.\n*'''Embassy of Evereska:''' The embassy of [[Evereska]].\n*'''Embassy of Evermeet:''' The embassy of [[Evermeet]].\n*[[Embassy of Impiltur]]: This welcoming diplomatic office was centered within the region just on the south side of Daren's Ring.\n*'''Embassy of Lantan:''' The embassy of the island nation of [[Lantan]].\n*'''Embassy of the Moonshaes:''' The embassy of the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n*[[Embassy of Mulmaster]]: The Mulmastrans within this uninviting stone building seemed to rebuff visitors as it always stationed guards on its grounds and never hosted revels.\n*[[Embassy of Procampur]]: Scores visitors and many revels were hosted within the embassy of the nearby [[Procampur|city-state]] of [[the Vast]].\n*'''Embassy of Rashemen:''' The embassy of [[Rashemen]].\n*[[Embassy of Sembia]]: This imposing building was secluded in the northwest section of the district, not too far from the home of [[Elvira|Elvira of Startree]].\n*[[Embassy of Tantras]]: The consulate of the [[Tantras]], a rival city-state of the Bluff, was a diminutive castle that stood in defiance to city officials and the town watch.\n*[[Embassy of Thay]]: Even the [[raven]]s flying through the city avoided this sinister, and deceptively unprotected structure.\n*[[Embassy of Turmish]]: This converted mansion was highlighted by a number of statues of valorous heroes wrestling creatures like [[peryton]]s and [[manticore]]s.\n*[[Embassy of Zhentil Keep]]: The guards who protected this dark, foreboding stone building were known to attack first and ask questions later.\n*[[Waterdeep House]]: This ostentatiously-designed structure well-represented the beauty of the ''City of Splendors'' in [[West Faerûn|the west]].",

            "Residences": "*[[Hark the Herald]]: The [[Onder]] [[halfling]] family called this small stone tower their home."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "Due to the highly sensitive nature of the business conducted by the diplomats and foreign agents within the area, Ravenians were encouraged not to wander and explore its peaceful roads. This left the district as being rather lacking in activity within its clean and placid streets, save for patrols of the City Watch.  Several [[adventurer]]s kept their homes within the large and impressive buildings found in the district, but they by and large kept to themselves.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "Some individuals that lived in the district that weren't adventurers included the following.\n*[[Anna Geden]]\n*[[Delila Rosebud]]\n*[[Elvira of Startree]]\n*[[Gideon Sagson]]\n*[[Kile the Ox]]\n*[[Loki Spellsinger]]\n*[[Rogan the Confused]]\n*[[Talin Brewmaster]]"
