        "mainbody": "Foreign Quarter  Foreign Section  Outlander District  Outlander Town\nThe Foreign District of Ravens Bluff, formerly known as the Gardens of Opulent Splendor or simply the Gardens,While no source exists that outright confirms that the Gardens and Foreign District are the same location, it can be inferred. The Gardens first appear in Nightwatch in the Living City, prior to which there were no mentions of any sort of Foreign ward in the city. They are both described as areas with tall stone walls that house dignitaries. And in the module Vengeance, on a chart of distances between \"districts\" within the city, the Gardens were included whilst the Foreign District was not. This same chart also showed the Gardens as being similarly adjacent to the Harbor and Temple districts. was a quiet, walled-off region of the city that was home to the embassies and consulates of a number of foreign nations and powers.\nIt was located on the western side of the Bluff, just within the tall stone wall that partitioned it from the docks and the Altarside neighborhood of the Temple District. It stood within a ten minute walking distance of Crows Foot and the Temple District.\nThe main feature of the district was Darens Ring, a circular road that enveloped Ring Park and extended to Fireleap Lane which continued eastward into the city. The roads that curved away from the Ring were nameless ornate topiaries and decorative lawns that were quite appealing, despite the lack of passers-by to appreciate the tranquil scenery.\nThe district was heavily patrolled by members of the the City Watch and the Griffon Guard. It was notably the only district in the city to lack a district barracks for the City Watch. Additionally, each of the embassies within its walls were staffed with their own guards.\nThe embassies within the district represented the native soil and the laws of their home countries, thus allowing for people to be punished under each diplomats respective laws. In some cases, this could mean that entering an embassy without an invitation could be punishable by death.\nNon-residents of the district generally had to have some form of invitation in order to enter.\nBack when it was known as the Gardens, the first embassies to be set up in the district were meant to be only temporary housing for diplomats traveling to Ravens Bluff to open up new trade routes.\nEmbassies The foreign district held a number of embassies from which representatives of nations around Faer√ªn would conduct their business within the city.\n*Calaglara The embassy house of Calimshan looked like an enlarged childs toy castle.\n*Cormyr House The impressive consulate of the Forest Kingdom was located on the southern side of the ward, next to the house of Sir Kile the Ox.\n*Embassy of Aglarond The embassy of Aglarond.\n*Embassy of Amn A palatial manor whose design evoked the opulence of the City of Coin.\n*Embassy of Chessenta The beauty of this pink-marble, domed structure was heightened by its lush gardens.\n*Embassy of Evereska The embassy of Evereska.\n*Embassy of Evermeet The embassy of Evermeet.\n*Embassy of Impiltur This welcoming diplomatic office was centered within the region just on the south side of Darens Ring.\n*Embassy of Lantan The embassy of the island nation of Lantan.\n*Embassy of the Moonshaes The embassy of the Moonshae Isles.\n*Embassy of Mulmaster The Mulmastrans within this uninviting stone building seemed to rebuff visitors as it always stationed guards on its grounds and never hosted revels.\n*Embassy of Procampur Scores visitors and many revels were hosted within the embassy of the nearby city-state of the Vast.\n*Embassy of Rashemen The embassy of Rashemen.\n*Embassy of Sembia This imposing building was secluded in the northwest section of the district, not too far from the home of Elvira of Startree.\n*Embassy of Tantras The consulate of the Tantras, a rival city-state of the Bluff, was a diminutive castle that stood in defiance to city officials and the town watch.\n*Embassy of Thay Even the ravens flying through the city avoided this sinister, and deceptively unprotected structure.\n*Embassy of Turmish This converted mansion was highlighted by a number of statues of valorous heroes wrestling creatures like perytons and manticores.\n*Embassy of Zhentil Keep The guards who protected this dark, foreboding stone building were known to attack first and ask questions later.\n*Waterdeep House This ostentatiously-designed structure well-represented the beauty of the City of Splendors in the west.\nLandmarks\n*Watchful Defender The ever-vigilant protector of the foreign district was \"Simon\", a 12-foot-tall granite statue that stood in defiance of \"Castle Tantras\".\nResidences\n*Hark the Herald The Onder halfling family called this small stone tower their home.\nDue to the highly sensitive nature of the business conducted by the diplomats and foreign agents within the area, Ravenians were encouraged not to wander and explore its peaceful roads. This left the district as being rather lacking in activity within its clean and placid streets, save for patrols of the City Watch.  Several adventurers kept their homes within the large and impressive buildings found in the district, but they by and large kept to themselves.\nSome individuals that lived in the district that werent adventurers included the following.\n*Anna Geden\n*Delila Rosebud\n*Elvira of Startree\n*Gideon Sagson\n*Kile the Ox\n*Loki Spellsinger\n*Rogan the Confused\n*Talin Brewmaster"
