        "mainbody": "Sumbur Rock was the largest among the sparsely-populated fishing hamlets on Cloak Bay, southwest of the Cloakwood.\nSumbur Rock stood on Cloak Bays shores, on the western side of the Fang that separated Cloak Bay from Borlyth Bay. By the 14 century DR, Sumbur Rock was an overgrown collection of single-store cottages reinforced with timber wood and scavenged marine wrecks. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in Eldelorr.\nInhabitants of Sumbur Rock survived by salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for crabs, silverfins, and laethe, a species of eel-like creatures.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Sumbur Rock, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14 century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster attacks."
