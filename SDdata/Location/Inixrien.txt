'''Inixrien''', the '''Tenth City of the Sword''', was one of the twelve major cities in the imperial heartlands of ancient [[Jhaamdath]] during [[the Founding Time]].

==Geography==
The Tenth City was far east of the capital [[Naarkolyth]] on the south side of the [[Bay of Jhaamdath]]. After its destruction, the ruins lay in the [[Selmal Basin]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
Inixrien was founded in {{Yearlink|-4620}}, as the tenth of the realm's Cities of the Sword.

By {{Yearlink|-1504}}, the empire's long-running struggle with [[Unther]] led to the Untheric conquest of the [[Akanal]] region and Jhaamdath being invaded directly. Inixrien was attacked, and despite the defense by the heroic [[Hlath (hero)|Hlath]] the city was taken, with much of eastern Jhaamdath taken by {{Yearlink|-1499}}. This conquest was held until {{Yearlink|-1069}}, when Jhaamdath's counter-conquest reclaimed much of what had been lost.

In the year of {{Yearlink|-276}}, Jhamdaath began a campaign of regional expansion that led to a brutal war with the [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]]. In response, the {{Yearlink|-255}} saw the elves use a [[High Magic]] ritual to destroy the heartlands of Jhaamdath with a great wave from the [[Inner Sea]]. The massive movement of water created the Vilhon Reach and sank Inixrien like the rest of the realm, and its [[psionic]] artifacts were buried in the sea floor where their emanations affected the nearby sealife.

Sunken Jhaamdath was later revealed by the dropping of sea levels after the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. The lands and ruins were once again submerged in [[1486 DR]] by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]].
