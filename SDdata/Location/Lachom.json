        "mainbody": "'''Lachom''' was a free city in the valley between the [[Deepwing Mountains]] and the [[Cloven Mountains]].",
        "Description": "Lachom was a peaceful city that worked the bountiful fields between Deepwing and the Cloven Mountains.",
        "Government": "Lachom was ruled by the Mayor. As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, [[Turien Battlewake]] held the title.",
        "Trade": "After gaining independence, Lachom cut all ties with Chondath, having no diplomatic presence nor trade relations. [[Surkh]], the so-called \"City of Lizards,\" was a trade partner of Lachom. However, the two city-states shared no other relations. Lachom's disdain for [[Arrabar]] was so strong, the city sought to trade with the [[lizardfolk]] from the neighboring town of [[Surkh]]. It was a common attitude that Surkh was more trustworthy than Chondath.",
        "Culture": "Like most free cities of the Vilhon Reach, Lachom celebrated the annual festival that celebrated the shattering of Chondath - the [[Rotting Dance]]. The festival was held every year on [[Higharvestide]]. Citizens of Lachom threw wild celebrations, possibly the most energetic celebration in the whole Vilhon Reach. Preparations for the festival took some time, but the entire city was gathered around large bonfires when the celebrations started. Inhabitants of Lachom formed circles around the fires as [[drum]]s played through the night. The first ceremony was the attendees tossing red-colored wooden chips into the fire. These bloodied chips represented much-hated Chondath. Following the chips, townies tossed rotten eggs and vegetables into the roaring flames to signify the rebirth of the Vilhon Reach after the Chondathan civil war. After the ceremony was over, wild parties erupted across the city, lush with [[ale]], [[wine]], and fresh fruit.",
        "History": "The city of Lachon was established in the {{YearlinkName|260}}, fueled by a goldrush in the [[Deepwing Mountains]]. Lachon served as a trading outpost that outfitted caravans of precious metals and attracted miners from the surrounding lands. Shortly after Lachon was established and before the town had a chance to build walled defenses, the city was effortlessly taken over by [[Chondath]].\n\nFrom [[900 DR]] through [[902 DR]], the Chondathan civil war, later named the [[Rotting War]], consumed the nation. The conflict's grand finale unleashed a deadly magical plague that decimated Chondathan armies. The survivors took the plague home, spreading death. The devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured Arrabar's loss of influence. All the cities of Chondath, apart from [[Iljak]] declared independence, becoming city-states. By the {{YearlinkName|1044}}, Lachom was completely independent from its former overlords. While Chondath futilely attempted to reclaim its territories by using armies to harass and strangle the trade along with other city-states, Lachom fortified and amassed defenses to ensure future independence.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a group of Deepwing Mountains [[fire giant]]s, led by [[witch doctor]] [[Kinondra]], started menacing the city and burning down farms outside the city walls. Mayor Turien Battlewake put out a call for adventurers brave enough to end the fiery-red menace. Unbeknownst to the dwarven Mayor, the fire giant raiders were lackeys of the ruler of Arrabar at the time - Lord [[Simon Dessino]]. Lord was attempting to show Lachom that the city needed protection and alliance with Arrabar. He was ready to order his giants to attack the city and deal several humiliating defeats that would have Lachom no choice but to ally with Simon Dessino's city and the nation of Chondath.",
        "Notable Locations": "Lachom had several places of worhip: a large temple of [[Silvanus]], a shrine to [[Helm]], the Vigilant One; and a minor shrine to [[Lliira]].",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Fildar]] of Lachom, a [[rogue]] adventurer who came to posess the artifact known as ''[[The Mighty Rune of the Master]]'' in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
