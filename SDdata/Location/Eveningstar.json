        "mainbody": "Eveningstar was a small unwalled farming town of about fifty buildings in Cormyr.\nthumb|right|250px|Map of Eveningstar, circa 1372 DR.\nIt was located roughly  west of Arabel,\nEveningstar was a pastoral village surrounded by fields and orchards situated in an elbow of the Starwater River just north of the Kings Forest (known by locals as the \"Shadowood\") in Cormyr. It stood at the intersection of the High Road, which ran west to High Horn and east to Arabel, and the Starwater Road (known by locals as the \"Suzail Road\" or \"Southrun\"), which ran south to the village of Dhedluk in the Kings Forest. Immediately to the north of Eveningstar was the Eveningstar Gorge, or the Starwater Gorge. The gorge, formed by the Starwater River as it flowed down from the Storm Horn Mountains, provided relatively easy access to the Helmlands and the Storm Horns and was the only significant break in the limestone Stonecliff that ran from Tyrluk to the west to just short of Arabel.\nThe whole region around the village was known as the \"Evening Lands\" in bardic tales and sages histories.\nEveningstar was an agricultural community producing primary products such as milk, eggs, poultry, mutton, carrots, beans, and parsnips, as well as value-added goods such as cheese, parchment, wool, and wine all of which were sold at a weekly farmers market. Eveningstar was also a popular stopover for frequent overland caravans, who patronized the local farmers and businesses. The most important business in town was the Lonesome Tankard tavern and inn, famous in Cormyr as one of the best places to eat, drink, and stay the night.\nIn 1368 DR, Eveningstar, along with Espar, Tyrluk, and Waymoot, was plagued by rogue dragons.\nLike most of the settlements in this region, it suffered badly in the Goblin War of 1370 DR.\n* Lonesome Tankard\n* Golden Unicorn\n* Hall of Heroes\n* Welcoming Hand, an inn destroyed during the Goblin War and rebuilt quite quickly after.\n* House of the Morning, the large temple to Lathander that added to the Eveningstars importance in the region."
