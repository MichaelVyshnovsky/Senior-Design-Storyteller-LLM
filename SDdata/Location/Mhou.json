        "mainbody": "Mhou was a town in Laothan in Malatra.\nThe town was located in the far northwest of Laothan, on the border with Tu Lung, opposite the Wepeng Garrison.\nMhou existed only to serve as a stronghold against Tu Lung.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, Mhou enjoyed hardly any external, legitimate trade.\nThe town did have a criminal trade, however, operated by local yakuza. People of Mhou undertook covert raids into Tu Lung, where they would not only steal livestock but occasionally women for slavery and prostitution. They sold their victims to certain nobles of the Nuyen clan or trafficked them via caravans southward, even to Kataburi in the neighboring Kuong Kingdom."
