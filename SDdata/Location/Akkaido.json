        "mainbody": "Akkaido was a major port city of the island of Tsukishima, Wa, that catered to both sea-faring\nThe citys most prominent feature was its harbors that held several hundred vessels, both fishing and mercantile.\nAkkaido was built on the hilly southern shores of Tsukishima. The lands that became Akkaido were known for being natural harbors of the Sea of Patience.\nIn 1754, the nation of Wa was forced to cut most of its international trade under the rulership of Shogun Matasuuri Nagahide. Despite its centuries-long international trade, Akkaido became the only trade port of Wa open to foreign merchants. All international imports were strictly regulated and placed under imposed limits. Despite that, the citys busy trade brought dozens of ships filled with exotic goods on a daily basis. The main consumers of expensive imported goods were upper-class inhabitants of Wa.\nAnother major industry in Akkaido was fishing. The lions share of the industry belonged to large fishing companies, while numerous smaller fishing vessels belonged to individuals. The biggest of the companies belonged to the Jejima family. Their eight large tuna fishing boats sailed along the coast with a net stretched between two vessels, scooping up the Sea of Patiences abundant catch.\nThe shipbuilding industry in Akkaido was renowned for its speed and quality. The city was considered to be home to the best shipbuilders in Wa. Small fishing boats were built in a week, larger net-fishing vessels took a month, large trade ships were constructed in five months, and warships took from four to six months.\nAkkaido had a high academic population, attracted to the port city for its exposure to outsiders and foreign cultures. Just like with trade, intellectual exchange was strictly regulated. Permissions to interact with foreign cultures and sciences had to be acquired from Was Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, a high level of unsanctioned intellectual exchanges was suspected as the number of students that desired to study under willing outlanders was much higher than the allowed supply of permits from the Ministry.\nRegular boat races were events of note in Akkaido.\nThe defenses of Akkaido were centered on the citys harbors, which could hold up to 500 vessels. Some of them were well-armed patrol ships that regularly traversed coastal areas and  into the waters of the Sea of Patience.\nAkkaido was a long-standing busy port city of Wa. It was famed for trade with the nations of Kara-Tur. In , however, a new shogun came to power, Matasuuri Nagahide. With a swift rollout of xenophobic laws, all international trade in the nation was severed, and all foreign merchants were ordered to leave. Those who stayed were executed. Akkaido was the only exception from the sweeping rule, allowing the import of international goods under the strict control of the citys daimyo. As of , the daimyo was Matasuuri Ieysuna.\nAt some point in his youth, Jejima Tyo, Ieysunas cousin, fished out a ningyo king. The man was furious at the fisherman, but Tyos masterful negotiation quelled the sea creatures wrath. The ningyo king was convinced to become Jejima Tyos partner. This alliance made Tyo the most profitable fishing businessman in Akkaido, always having access to the most numerous schools of tuna in the Sea of Patience. Tyo used an enchanted biwa of charm to ensure maximum catch.\nAnother event of note was the \"unfortunate deaths\" of all 140 individuals who were involved in the creation of the tsunami and the locust space-faring ships. An emperor-sanctioned bill announced the team of inventors had perished in a \"freak greek fire explosion\" in Akkaidos harbors.\n*Golden Fox Martial Arts School, a martial arts school that antagonized the yakuza before 1374 DR.\n*Jejima Horoto, a cousin of Akkaidos daimyo Matasuuri Ieysuna, and the wealthiest importer of goods in the nation circa 1336 DR.\n*Jejima Tyo, Jejima Horotos brother who owned a small fleet of eight fishing ships circa 1336 DR."
