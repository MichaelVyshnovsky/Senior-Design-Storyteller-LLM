        "mainbody": "The '''Dalelands''', also referred to as '''the Dales''', was a region in [[north Faerûn]] of dense forests and bountiful, rolling farmlands. It comprised a loosely-organized group of countries called ''dales'' that were as diverse as they were independent.\n\n{{quote|''The people of the Dales didn’t survive so near dangers like the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Myth Drannor]] by being trusting. We go through life with our eyes open.''|[[Whitlock Brandish]]}}",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "* [[Arch Wood]]: Rumored to be haunted, this dark, dense forest was full of [[oak]], [[ash]] and [[elm]] and home to ferocious [[owlbear]]s. Its trees spanned the borders of Archendale, Deepingdale and Tasseldale and played a major role in the lives of their people, both socially and economically. Woodcutting was almost always prohibited, despite the constant pleas of Archendale during the annual Dales Council.\n\n*[[River Ashaba]]: This massive river flowed from the [[Storm Horns|Storm Horn mountains]], through nearly half the dales, over [[Feather Falls (waterfall)|Feather Falls]] and into [[the Scar]] before emptying into the [[Dragon Reach]] fjord off the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. A number of villages and towns, including [[Feather Falls (village)|Feather Falls]], [[Chandlerscross]], and [[Scardale Town]] rested on or straddled this river and attributed at least part of their economy to its prominence throughout the dale, especially [[Featherdale]].\n\n* [[Thunder Peaks]]: These massive mountains spanned the southern border of the dales, separating them from the nation of Cormyr. They were rich in [[copper]] and [[iron]] and mostly uninhabited, save for a few tribes of [[hobgoblin]]s, [[hill giant]]s, and the family of [[wyvern]]s who took roost in one its tallest peaks. The mountains received their names from the year-round thunderstorms"
        },
        "Culture": "While the various dales shared a similar culture, alike lifestyles and aligned relationships with nearby powers, they were not a unified nation like nearby [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]]. Each dale was an independent territory with its own unique government, military, industry and culture. However, the people were largely independent, self-reliant and had collectively enjoyed an age-old alliance with the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthyr]], in thanks to the [[Dales Compact]].\n\nTravelers visiting the Dalelands might see the folk as reserved, suspicious They were a quiet people who typically preferred to remain civil, silent and deliberate about someone's character until they were well enough known to be accepted as a friend, or even an ally. Once this trust was earned, friends of the Dalesfolk would find them to be quite open and generous.\n\nFarming, craftsmanship and commerce were all highly valued throughout the dales.",
        "Government": "First and foremost the Dalelands were a loose confederation of small towns. or a republic led by groups such as the [[Swords of Archendale]].\n\nHowever, representatives from each dale would meet together once a year in [[Midwinter]] to discuss issues related to trade, relations with other nations, and inter-border disputes at the [[Dales Council]].",
        "Trade": "Trade was an important, and often unifying, force among the various dales. The main exports of the Dalelands were raw products and materials, such as timber and seafood from Archendale, livestock, cheese and grain from [[Battledale]], or [[copper]] from [[High Dale]].  The Dalelands were essentially considered the breadbasket of the [[Western Heartlands]].\n\nThe exception to this dynamic was [[Tasseldale]], which was a land of primarily craftsmen and traders, taking a cue from their neighbor Sembia, and primarily exported fine goods like pottery and textiles. Conversely, these fine goods, including metalwork, jewelry and finished products like paper, glassware and clothing were usually highest in demand within the other dales. These goods were procured from nearby cities such as [[Arabel]], [[Suzail]] and [[Marsember]] in Cormyr, [[Hillsfar]] from the [[Moonsea]] region and [[Selgaunt]] and [[Ordulin]], when it was still a city of Sembia.\n\nIn addition, the Dalelands acted as a crossroads of trade. Although their people cared little for foreign affairs, their strategic location between other powers in the region was undeniable.\n\nThe Dales were famous for a strong-willed breed of working pony, called the [[Dales pony]]. On average they cost 120 [[gp]].",
        "Relations": "Considering how the Dalelands were located at a crossroads between a number of different powerful human nations, city-states and even the renewed kingdom of the elves the fact their lands were brought to the attention of a several of the Realms' most influential powers came as little surprise. Among these groups were:\n\nThe elves of [[Cormanthyr]] north of the Dalelands helped forge a friendship and fledgling alliance of nations long before the people of the Dales were a semblance of an impactful society. Even though the Dales Compact did not stand for centuries between its initial iteration and its reformation in the 15{{th}} century,\n\nThe typically secretive group of benevolent spies and agents known as the [[Harpers]] shared an similar outlook of the world with the Dalesfolk. The Harpers could operate more freely in the dales than they could usually get away with. They also counted many local leaders among their ranks including [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], [[Storm Silverhand]] and even [[Elminster]], who was famously known as the Sage of Shadowdale.<ref> Shadowdale indeed was home a great number of Harpers.\n\nThe [[Zhentarim]] were arguably the most infamous and deadly of groups that the Dalelands would collectively declare as their enemy. Throughout the ages, the Zhentarim have spied on, maneuvered against, raided and outright invaded the dales, resulting in no small feat of the outright destruction of [[Teshendale]], and intermittent occupations in Shadowdale and Daggerdale.<ref name=GHotR-p137>\n\nAlong with these larger groups the Dalelands were home to a few more localized ones such as the [[pegasi]]-mounted [[Flying Auxiliary]] that guarded High Dale, the [[Silver Ravens]] of Sembia who led operations from Scardale Town, and the [[Stellar Fellowship]], an adventuring society based out of [[New Velar]].",
        "History": {
            "Origins": "The smattering of [[human]] settlers that huddled in small villages at the edges of Cormanthor and [[Cormanthyr]]ian led by [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] came to an agreement known as the Dales Compact. The conditions of this pact gave the future-Dalesfolk non-forested, and non-elven claimed areas of land on which to settle and ceased any and all logging efforts deeper into the forest. Furthermore, the [[Standing Stone]] was erected as a monument to this new alliance between elf and man.\n\nOne of the most famous milestones in Harper lore occurred in the [[Dancing Place]] within High Dale on [[Flamerule 26]], in the {{YearlinkName|720}}. The [[Gathering of the Gods]] was a widely-celebrated event where good-aligned deities spoke directly through their respective priests on [[Toril]]. This event led to the reformation of the Harpers, which was all but wiped out some six years prior.\n\nIn response to the growing threat of [[orc]]ish tribes near the Dalelands, [[Aencar Burlisk]] was the Warlord of [[Battledale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1030}}. Over the next decade he would declare himself as King of the Dales, unite the Dalelands to defeat the common threat, The Dalelands were split into independent communities that maintained somewhat an alliance<ref name=GHotR-p156> through the [[Dales Council]].",
            "Civil Wars": "When the [[Dusk Lord]] of [[Sessrendale]] was suspected of corrupting the Dalelands with [[necromancy|dark magic]] and pillaging caravans with monsters and evil marauders, the Dalesfolk of Archendale took action. The [[first inter-dale war|first civil war]] took place over three weeks in the {{YearlinkName|1232}}, when the forces of Archendale assailed, and eventually annihilated the Dusk Lord and his mages. The [[Swords of Archendale|Three Swords]] then salted the earth of the dale so that nothing more could grow from its soil.\n\nThe [[Second inter-dale war|second war-between-dales]] fell under attempts of the Lord of [[Scardale]], [[Lashan Aumersair]] to reunite Dalelands under a common banner in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}. His forces managed to defeat Featherdale, Battledale and Harrowdale but were eventually stopped at Mistledale by a coalition of Dales powers and united soldiers from Cormyr, Hillsfar, Sembia and even [[Zhentil Keep]]. This defeat resulted in over a decade of occupation and influence from the governments of these respective powers.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, The Dales Compact was renewed between the [[Seiveril's Crusade|crusading]] [[Seiveril Miritar]] of [[Evereska]] and the untied lands of Battledale, Deepingdale, Mistledale and Shadowdale.<ref name=GHotR-p155>\n\nThe [[Cormanthor War]] of the same year resulted in the invasion of Battledale and Shadowdale but ended with a hopeful outlook for the latter. Lord [[Mourngrym Amcathra]] was freed and lordship of the dale was passed on to [[Alazar Falconhand]].<ref name=GHotR-p158>",
            "Conflict with Sembia": "Throughout 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Dalelands had become a focal point for several neighboring nations, all vying for control over its land and people. Tasseldale was overrun, Featherdale was annexed and the government of Archendale was discovered to have betrayed their people to Sembian coin."
        },
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Fallen dales": "* [[Moondale]]: One of the first dales to join the Dales Compact, Moondale expanded rapidly and the booming nation readily allied itself with the Sembia. They were peacefully annexed by the merchant nation\n\n*[[Sessrendale]]: Founded in [[880 DR]], this country spanned the eastern face of the Thunder Peak mountains, living under the rule of the [[Dusk Lord]]. They were destroyed by the superior forces of Archendale during the [[Sessrendale War]] in [[1232 DR]].\n\n* [[Tarkhaldale]]: Also known as the ''Lost Dale'', this remote land slowly declined, falling afoul to [[orc]]ish and [[goblinoid]] tribes for decades. In [[1360 DR]] the dale came to be the home to the [[saurial]]s, a [[Scalykind domain|scalykind]] race that had been recently transported to [[Toril]].\n\n* [[Teshendale]]: The northernmost dale was over-run by an [[orc]] army, under influence of the Zhentarim, in [[1316 DR]]."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to their verdant valleys, that were rich with wheat, oat, and a variety of vegetables; the Dalelands were abundant with wildlife including game, fish and fowl. Sheep, pigs and cattle were often raised in the farmlands and the fields and forests were rich with rabbits, [[deer]], [[bear]]s and even woodchucks and porcupines. \n\nRegions located further out from settlements, along the fringes of the dales, contained [[troll]]s and bands of [[bugbear]]s."
