        "mainbody": "ltabbar was a tharch of Thay that encompassed the majority of the northern Thayan plateau, between the First and Second Escarpments. Its territory included the western shores of Lake Thaylembrar and the lands just west of the River Thay.\n* Eltabbar The shining capital of Thay for many years,\n* Lake Thaylembrar\n* Ancient Nar ruins in the more remote parts of the tharch, which were home to demons.\nWhile the eruption of volcanoes in Thaymount during the Spellplague of 1385 DR caused desolation across the entire nation, the weather and climate of Eltabbar had largely been normalized and protected by magical means as of the year 1479 DR. The finite number of agricultural farms within the tharch supported the living population of Thay during the latter half of the 15 century."
