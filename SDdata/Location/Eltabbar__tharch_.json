Its territory included the western shores of [[Lake Thaylembrar]] and the lands just west of the [[River Thay]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Eltabbar]]: The shining capital of Thay for many years,\n* [[Lake Thaylembrar]]\n* Ancient [[Nar]] ruins in the more remote parts of the tharch, which were home to [[demon]]s.",
        "History": "While the eruption of volcanoes in [[Thaymount]] during the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] caused desolation across the entire nation, the weather and climate of Eltabbar had largely been normalized and protected by [[magic]]al means as of the year [[1479 DR]]. The finite number of agricultural farms within the tharch supported the living population of Thay during the latter half of the 15{{th}} century."
