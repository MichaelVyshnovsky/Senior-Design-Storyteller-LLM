Apprentice Row was an area in the city of Neverwinter prior to the mid&ndash15 century DR.
Apprentice Row was located in or adjacent to the Arcanist Quarter in the southeastern portion of the city.
Before the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the , the large number of powerful wizards and other spellcasters who congregated at the Arcanist Quarter led the area to become attractive to those who wished to learn from them. The result was a neighborhood of rundown apartments and cheap taverns catering to these aspiring mages.
A motley mix of would-be mages from all social classes rubbed elbows in the tenements and taverns of Apprentice Row. These young spellcasters worked tirelessly to hone their craft and attract the attention of a powerful master to take them on as apprentice.
