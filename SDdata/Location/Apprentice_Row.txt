'''Apprentice Row''' was an area in the city of [[Neverwinter]] prior to the mid&ndash;15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
Apprentice Row was located in or adjacent to the [[Arcanist Quarter]] in the southeastern portion of the city.

==History==
Before the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, the large number of powerful [[wizard]]s and other [[spellcaster]]s who congregated at the Arcanist Quarter led the area to become attractive to those who wished to learn from them. The result was a neighborhood of rundown apartments and cheap [[tavern]]s catering to these aspiring mages.

==Inhabitants==
A motley mix of would-be mages from all social classes rubbed elbows in the tenements and taverns of Apprentice Row. These young spellcasters worked tirelessly to hone their craft and attract the attention of a powerful master to take them on as apprentice.
