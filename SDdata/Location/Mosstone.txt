Mosstone was a walled caravan-stop town in Tethyr on the Trade Way near the Wealdath forest. The residents referred to themselves as Mosstonians.
Mosstone was a walled settlement, like so many others along the Trade Way, offering the weary caravaners safety from trolls of Muranndin and comfort on their long journey. Mosstone was the first civilized stop past monster-infested Muranndin to the north.
The town was famous for its unlikely communal nature and governance. Most public tasks, like wall repair, were voluntarily done by the skillful and capable residents who were rewarded by the community with heartfelt thanks and goods and services.
Many buildings within the city walls were rustic cottages. The town was cool, damp, and shady. Most of the buildings had their own fresh springs in their cellar. The building walls and surfaces were often cleaned to keep various molds at bay.
The street known as the Rimmons Lane led through Mosstone and was used by entering and leaving traders. Just outside the towns walls on the spot that assembled and dispersed the moving caravan traffic stood the Drovers Last Drink where travelers could quickly grab a drink before embarking on their journey up or down the Trade Way.

Mosstone was founded in 687 DR
In 1347 DR, terror came to the Mosstone and the entire region when a green dragon emerged from the deepest eastern parts of the Forest of Tethir. The creature plagued the Trade Way, devouring caravans that traveled along the route and praised a small village north of Mosstone. The beasts presence was disturbing the trade, and the Archdruid of Mosstone placed a bounty on the wyrms head. The adventuring company known as the Company of Eight answered the call, becoming the towns heroes and life-long allies.
In 1364 DR, the rich pipeweed farm to the south of Mosstone was attacked by Wealdaths wild elves in retaliation for the farmers using their kin as slaves. The elves torched the farms barns and slaughtered the owners family as well as most of the farmhands.
In 1367 DR, Zaranda Star became acquainted with the Company of Eight while investigating a series of murders in Mosstone. The towns rangers were slain by a pack of wereboars. Zaranda and the Company of Eight became fast friends and fought for the same goals of law and equal responsible governance in the lands of Tethyr. Later, on Higharvestide, Zaranda Star was blessed by the Archdruid of Mosstone during a ceremony in Port Kir with the forest and coastal Tethyrians accepting her regency.
In the month of Eleint, 1369 DR, the Archdruids Grove of Mosstone became the site of the Interregnum Tribunal. Seventeen nobles who were imprisoned during the Reclamation Wars were moved from Cloister of St. Ramedar on the Starspire Peninsula to Mosstone for the proceedings.
A year later, in the month of Eleint, 1370 DR, following the fall of Imnescar and Trademeet to the "Sythillisian Empire," elves of Noromath and defenders from Mosstone were attempting to hold the invaders off the Tethyrian portion of the Trade Way.
By 1370 DR, Arkaneus Silvermane was the reigning Archdruid of Mosstone and represented its inhabitants in the court of Queen Zaranda Star Rhindaun and King Haedrak Rhindaun III as one of the five major emissaries.
In 1449 DR, a strange "Sword of Spells" started seemingly random daring and stabbing wizards in Zazesspur, and a tenday after, two more in Velen and one in Mosstone. Locals were investigating strange murders. The murdered wizard in Mosstone was a hireling of the Oromanche trading family.
Local legends stated that each Archdruid of Mosstone entered the forest at the end of their lives and became an oak tree within Old Oak Dell, merging essence with the Great Oak.
It was widely believed that the living trees within the Dryads Dreams festhall actually had dryads living in them.
Unlike many other settlements found throughout the Dragons Neck Peninsula, Mosstone had no ghosts. Some believed this was due to a lack of strife. Some said it was because of Mosstones balance with nature, while others assumed that the undead were simply spooked by the sheer number of druids in the area.
* Great Oak of Mosstone the center of the Archdruids Grove of Mosstone that served as the secondary place of druidic worship. The grove itself housed only three buildings. The biggest building made of stone was the Archdruids residence that housed living quarters for his small staff, a large meeting hall used for town gatherings, and the Interregnum Tribunal. Two smaller wooden houses were the druids library and the seminary.

*Dryads Dreams the only festhall in town that also offered inns services to its guest. The interior and furniture were magically shaped out of trees, and the inn had three living trees inside it. In the 14 century DR, the owners, Hlargrim Sturnshons nine daughters worked the inn, dressed as dryads.

*Uncrimmons Trophies & Sundries the store that dealt in exotic monster parts and spell components. The shopkeep of the store was a secret doppelganger named Ardreth Ulnshoor who served the mysterious Uncrimmon in the 14 century DR.
*Drovers Field the enclosure on the north-eastern side of the town that housed caravaners oxen while the traders and guards rested and took care of business within Mosstone. The Drovers Field location was strategically placed, so the sea winds kept the smell of beast manure out of the city. The Field was guarded nightly to protect the beasts of burden from the unwelcomed attention of wolves and other predators.
Apart from hard-working, kind townsfolk and the members of Mosstones druidic circle, the town was home or the base of operations for adventures and foresters. These individuals were often capable warriors, wizards, and rangers, who offered Mosstone additional defenses on top of the many druids found in the area. By 1372 DR, the number of druids associated with the Mosstone circle was almost two hundred.
