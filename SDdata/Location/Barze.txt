'''Barze''', known as '''the Fallen Kingdom of Barze''' as of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], was an ancient kingdom in the [[Moonsea North]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|79}}{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Geography==
The kingdom was located north of the [[Moonsea]] and west of what later became known as [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} It sat in a fertile dale between two arms of the West [[Galena Mountains]], and was bordered by the [[Vercy Wood]] to the west. 

==History==
Barze was founded by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Barze (person)|Barze]] in the {{YearlinkName|-456}}. The previous year (the {{YearlinkName|-457}}), he had traveled with his followers from the [[Negarath|Negarath Enclave]] in [[Netheril]], fleeing persecution. He named his new nation after himself.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48-49}}

The Kingdom of Barze lasted from −456 DR to {{Yearlink|-357}}. That year, the kingdom pledged its support to an alliance with the forces of [[Horreb]], [[Varm]], [[Flindyke]], [[Mount Akoro]], and [[Forharn]] to defeat [[Maram of the Great Spear]]. This expedition was led by the [[Dead Three|Dark Three]], and while it succeeded at driving back the [[primordial]], merely 1 in 25 members of the alliance survived to return home. The kingdom of Barze fell after the sorcerer-king Barze was assassinated by "one hailed as a hero", who was suspected to have been one of the Dark Three, [[Bhaal]].

Shortly after Barze's death, the kingdom was conquered by the [[Twisted Ones]] and their ruler, the general [[Tyranthraxus]]. Tyranthraxus ruled cruelly, laying waste to the land and slaying the remaining princes of Barze and the lands of Horreb and the [[Vane]] to the south, until he was imprisoned in a vial of shining water and sunk beneath [[Lake Longreach]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|80}}

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the story of the kingdom's founding was the subject of a chapter in a book called ''[[The Great Diaspora of Netheril]]''.
