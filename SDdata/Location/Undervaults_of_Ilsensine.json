        "mainbody": "The district of [[Oryndoll]] known as the '''Undervaults of Ilsensine''' was deep beneath the [[Ring Caverns (Oryndoll)|Ring Caverns]] and could not be walked to. The only ways to reach the Undervaults were either through [[Teleport|teleportation]] or other similar spells or [[psionic]] disciplines or digging. The Undervaults were all connected together in an interlocking pattern.",
        "Description": "This area housed Oryndoll's temples and its stores of knowledge, which rivaled what was held in [[Candlekeep]]. This section of the city was essentially an [[illithid]]-only library, with lore stored in Thought Basins filled with water and encephalic fluid that was psionically imprinted with millions of pieces of lore, instead of books. It could be read only with ''[[detect thoughts]]''/''[[ESP]]'' or other mind-reading powers. The library was cataloged in [[qualith]] writing on the wall above every basin. Without being able to read qualith, the contents of a basin could not be ascertained, and a non-illithid would only be able to gain random, even unintelligible information from the pools. In any case, non-illithids caught in this section of Oryndoll were killed on sight.",
        "Inhabitants": "The city's elder brain, the [[Encephalithid]], resided within the [[Grotto of Sacred Thoughts]]. This was also where the [[deity]] [[Ilsensine]] manifested during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]].",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Cenotaph of Maanzecorian]]: This was once a small house of worship in the Undervaults of Ilsensine.\n* The [[Grotto of Sacred Thoughts]]: This was a vast natural cavern in the heart of the Undervaults of Ilsensine."
