'''Asbravn''' ({{Pronounce|az|BRAH|ven|refs=}}) was a small town found in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Geography==
Asbravn lay in a shallow valley in between the [[Dusk Road]] and the [[Uldoon Trail]].

==Description==
Asbravn had lush farms, wood lots, well-kept barns, drainage ditches, ponds, and an air of tranquility. 

A dilapidated temple to [[Ilmater]] faced the market, which was ringed by swap shops, a cooper and cratemaker, a wagonworks. The town also included shrines to [[Lliira]], [[Lathander]] and [[Waukeen]] though the later was  abandoned by priests and was used as a playground by children. The [[Tankard and Sheaf]] was a popular tavern and the [[Board Laid Bare (Asbravn)|Board Laid Bare]] was a local inn.

==Activities==
The town served as the market center of the southern Vale farmers. Here, they did their trading with each other and with traveling merchants from the cities, where others made a profit from their food. Buyers from [[Berdusk]] and [[Iriaebor]] came to the market each day. It was a common rumor that the market of Asbravn filled bellies all along the [[Chionthar]].

Another not-quite-so troubling event was that a farmer was planning to breed long-horned horses. The only relic of its long past was an old, stout, cracked stone pillar, surmounted by crumbling horse heads. This pillar came from when the town was a city, [[Urdrath]] of the Horsemen. The Horsemen moved from [[Tunland]] long ago when they were nomads. Urdrath buried their dead in catacombs beneath the streets where unwary people now pass.

==Defenses==
The [[Riders in Red Cloaks]], police and defenders, were well-known. A few experienced warriors, occasionally bolstered by mages and priests, and local volunteers were sponsored by Iriaebor to safeguard the market and surrounding roads. They patrolled in mounted dozens and often had to battle bandits, trolls, orcs, bugbears and predatory monsters in the southern [[Sunset Mountains]]. 

The [[Zhentarim]] gave the Cloaks a hard time with poisonings and well-paid mercenary ambushes. In almost every family, there was one who was chosen to be a Rider. Once, they offered a post to any warrior, with archers being particularly sought after. They got a pay rate of ten gold pieces per week. After a while, Abject Supplicant [[Asgar Tellendar]] started insisting on questioning applicants with the aid of the [[Harpers]].
