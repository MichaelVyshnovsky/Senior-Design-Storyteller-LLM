        "mainbody": "'''Westwood''' was a forest on the [[Sword Coast North]] on the eastern edge of the [[Sword Mountains]].",
        "Geography": "The closest settlement to Westwood was [[Kheldell]], which sat on the northwestern edge of the wood at the bottom of the Sword Mountains. [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]] lay to the south of Westwood.\n\nWestwood was part of a group of forests that were referred to by some as the [[Other Woods]] and others as the [[Moonwoods]]. The forests in this group were [[Lurkwood]], [[Southkrypt Garden]],<ref group=\"note\">Both sources use this name of a dwarven ruin but it is assumed to mean the [[Kryptgarden Forest]] in which it was located. [[Southwood]], [[Moonwood]], and Westwood.",
        "History": "Some sages claimed that Westwood was once as vast as the [[High Forest]] and stretched as far north as [[Yartar]] and as far south as the [[Delimbiyr Route]].\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-4420}}, the dwarven realm of [[Besilmer]] was founded. The western edges of Besilmer's territory ended at Westwood.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1100}}, the remnants of the [[elf|elven]] empire of [[Illefarn]] splintered into the independent realms of [[Ardeep]], [[Iliyanbruen]], and [[Rilithar]]. Rilithar settled Westwood and [[Kryptgarden Forest]].\n\nSages claimed that Westwood had been shrinking after the destruction of [[Netheril]].\n\nSome time between [[936 DR]] and [[941 DR]], the [[Battle of Westwood]] took place. This battle was part of the [[Orcfastings War]]. During the battle, [[King Uruth]] was killed<ref name =\"CoS:W-8\"> while wielding the ''[[Ettin Axe of Uruth]]''.<ref name =\"CoS:W-147\">\n\nAround [[1370 DR]], a group of druids known as the [[Dusk Circle]] lived in the Westwood. These druids directed the lumberjacks of Kheldell as to when and where they could chop trees.<ref name =\"VGttN-50\"/>",
        "Notable Locations": ";Elven Castle\n:As of 1370 DR, rumor had it that there was a ruined [[elf|elven]] castle at the center of Westwood. The ruins supposedly held [[magic]] and were inhabited by [[owlbear]]s and [[treant|wild tree]]s. The route to the ruin was supposedly marked by floating [[moonglow]] symbols that were only visible at night.\n\n;Shrine of Mielikki\n:As of 1370 DR, there was a hidden shrine to [[Mielikki]] in Westwood. Only rangers were guided to the shrine. Those who left certain offerings at the altar were rewarded with either healing spells or curses depending on their alignment."
