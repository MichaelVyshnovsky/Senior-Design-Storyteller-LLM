        "mainbody": "Bedlam was a large gate-town leading to Pandemonium from the Outlands. \nThe gate-town was divided into three parts. The lowest part of the town, called Gatemouth, was found on the lower slope of the hill upon which Bedlam was built. From here, eight large boulevards begin their rise to the rest of the gate-town. The architecture in this part of Bedlam was mishmash of chaotic designs, filled with unnaturally curved walls and corners that seem to alter reality itself. The upper part of Bedlam, called the Citadel district, was located further up the hill. The architecture in this part of the gate-town was far less chaotic and was home to the upper class of Bedlam. Dividing Citadel and Gatemouth was Midtown. This wide district was home to most of the inns and taverns found in Bedlam.\nThe gate to Pandemonium was located in Gatemouth. It was found within a very tall tower made from obsidian. The tower was as tall as Maurash and topped with a large hand reaching for the sky. Along the base of the tower were six entrances called blastgates. From these archways of iron and stone a constant, foul smelling wind blew across the gate-town.\nBedlam was built on the slopes of Maurash, a hill made of volcanic stone.\nBedlamites were known for being malevolent and spiteful. Anyone who spent more than a few days in Bedlam tended to display symptoms of extreme anxiety and narcissism, as well arguing with voices whose origin was unknown, compelling an individual to break free from reason and sanity.\nDuring the reign of King Azoun Obarskyr IV, a half-elven paladin of Oghma from Cormyr was dispatched on a mission to explore the planes of existence beyond Toril. The paladins name was Ambran the Seeker, and excerpts from his journal still survive to this day. In the final volume of the journal, he described arriving in Bedlam and his time there.\nSome Bedlamites held that the massive tower around the gate was formed as the result of some long-forgotten god unsuccessful attempt to escape Pandemonium. Others claimed the tower was a piece of art crafted personally by either Cyric, Hruggek or Zeboim."
