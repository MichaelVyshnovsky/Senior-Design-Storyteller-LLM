        "Description": {
            "Gates": "The gate to Pandemonium was located in Gatemouth. It was found within a very tall tower made from [[obsidian]]. The tower was as tall as Maurash and topped with a large hand reaching for the sky. Along the base of the tower were six entrances called blastgates. From these archways of [[iron]] and stone a constant, foul smelling wind blew across the gate-town."
        },
        "Geography": "Bedlam was built on the slopes of Maurash, a hill made of volcanic stone.",
        "Inhabitants": "Bedlamites were known for being malevolent and spiteful. Anyone who spent more than a few days in Bedlam tended to display symptoms of extreme anxiety and narcissism, as well arguing with voices whose origin was unknown, compelling an individual to break free from reason and sanity.",
        "History": "During the reign of King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], a [[half-elven]] [[paladin]] of [[Oghma]] from [[Cormyr]] was dispatched on a mission to explore the [[planes of existence]] beyond [[Toril]]. The paladin's name was [[Ambran|Ambran the Seeker]], and excerpts from his journal still survive to this day. In the final volume of the journal, he described arriving in Bedlam and his time there.{{Cite dragon/204/The Plane Truth Part II: A Journey to the Outlands}}{{Cite dragon/205/The Plane Truth Part III: The Transformation}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some Bedlamites held that the massive tower around the gate was formed as the result of some long-forgotten [[deity|god]] unsuccessful attempt to escape Pandemonium. Others claimed the tower was a piece of art crafted personally by either [[Cyric]], [[Hruggek]] or [[Zeboim]]."
