Deadstone Cleft was a dead-end canyon in the foothills of the Graypeak Mountains in the Savage Frontier. Populated by stone giants, they believed the canyon was sacred site to their god Skoraeus Stonebones. It was held an ancient temple to him and a a magical stalactite, the Steinfang.
Deadstone Clefts first thane was the stone giant known as the Skodkong, or "Fog King".
Some time after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, Deadstone Cleft was inhabited by the stone giant Thane Kayalithica and her clan. The giantess used the sacred site as her lair, launching raids to destroy various settlements and structures around the area in order to please her god. By this time, many stone giants avoided the cleft, believing it to be a haunted place. Kayalithica had also forged an alliance with the Blue Bear Tribe, and a number of the barbarians lived in caves in and around the cleft at this time.
