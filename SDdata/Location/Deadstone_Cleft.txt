'''Deadstone Cleft''' was a dead-end canyon in the foothills of the [[Graypeak Mountains]] in the [[Savage Frontier]]. Populated by [[stone giant]]s, they believed the canyon was sacred site to their god [[Skoraeus Stonebones]]. It was held an ancient temple to him and a a magical stalactite, the [[Steinfang]].

==History==
Deadstone Cleft's first thane was the stone giant known as the [[Skodkong]], or "Fog King".

Some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] of [[1485 DR]], Deadstone Cleft was inhabited by the stone giant Thane [[Kayalithica]] and her clan. The giantess used the sacred site as her lair, launching raids to destroy various settlements and structures around the area in order to please her god. By this time, many stone giants avoided the cleft, believing it to be a haunted place. Kayalithica had also forged an alliance with the [[Blue Bear Tribe]], and a number of the barbarians lived in caves in and around the cleft at this time.
