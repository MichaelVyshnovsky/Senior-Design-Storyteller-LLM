The Cimarine Isles were an archipelago located in the Sea of Swords off the Sword Coast west of Candlekeep.
Circa 1479 DR, they were populated by watersoul genasi and trade settlements from Amn. The city of Branestria on the western island, inhabited by watersoul genasi and partially submerged, traded with Baldurs Gate and some smaller settlements.
