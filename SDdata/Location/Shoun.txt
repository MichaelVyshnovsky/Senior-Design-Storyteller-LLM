'''Shoun''' was a settlement in the [[halfling]] realm of [[Luiren]].

==Geography==
Shoun was located on [[Luirenstrand]] on the coast of the [[Great Sea]] in eastern Luiren. Shoun was the port nearest to [[Passion Island]]. It was the terminus from a road leading to [[Beluir]], as well as the beginning of a trail leading to [[Ormpe]] in [[Estagund]].

==Inhabitants==
[[Melino Richtoes]] was the mayor of Shoun in [[1367 DR]].

==History==
Shoun was founded by halflings in [[116 DR]]. The settlement sported a host of bakeries, eventually giving rise to the phrase "fat as a Shounite" throughout Luiren. Additionally, famous dairies were supplied by goats, which were kept north of the city. It was even rumored that [[Luiren spring cheese]] originated here.
