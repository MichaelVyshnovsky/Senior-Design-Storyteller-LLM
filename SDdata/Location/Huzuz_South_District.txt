The South District was a district of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The South District was found in the Peoples Quarter and covered much of the southern portion of Huzuz. The Enlightened Way ran along the western edge of the South District, separating it from the Peasants District. Along the eastern edge ran the Pilgrims Route, bordering the Affluent District and Pilgrims District. The Pilgrims District also formed much of the northern boundary of the South District.
Visitors to the South District had access to a wide array of services from vendors and entertainers.
