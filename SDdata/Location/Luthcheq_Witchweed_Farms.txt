The Witchweed Farms was a large site dedicated to growing witchweed located in the city of Luthcheq in Chessenta during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The Witchweed Farms occupied a large walled enclosure of land approximately a quarter of the size of the rest of Luthcheq.
The plot of land contained many separate buildings. The plot was accessible only by a single gate situated near the the Burning Mage inn.
