        "mainbody": "Tall Trees was a northeastern section of the High Forest in northwest Faer√ªn. It was believed to contain the oldest trees in the High Forest.\nThe Tall Trees area was a remnant of Teuveamanthaar, capital of the long-ago elven realm of Eaerlann, which fell when the elves retreated to Evermeet.\nAround 1358 DR, the region was held by the Druids of Tall Trees, who were devotees of Mielikki. Their aim was to protect the Tall Trees forest."
