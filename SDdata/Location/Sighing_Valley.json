        "mainbody": "The Sighing Valley was a canyon that ran through the southern stretch of the Sumber Hills in the Dessarin Valley. It earned its name from the whipping winds that created a sighing sound as they passed by the canyons features.\nThe Sighing Valley comprised a wide canyon floor dotted with a number of tors, rocky spires, and mesas. Winding between these features was a rather small waterway known as the Lost River.\nOne of the more notable features of the Sighing Valley was Feathergale Spire,\nThe canyon was home to a couple of semi-intelligent races, gnolls and aarakocra."
