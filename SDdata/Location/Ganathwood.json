        "mainbody": "The Gannathwood was a small forest found in the northern regions of Murghôm and Mulhorand.\nThe forest was situated along the west side of the valley split by the River Murghol as it flowed between the southern edge of the Sunrise Mountains and the western edge of the Mountains of Copper.\nGannathwood served as a border of sorts, as Mulhorand had no towns nor outposts to the east of Ganathwood or the Fields of Ganath.\nGannathwood was a minor source of wood for Mulhorand, exporting it to Thay. Gannathwoods willow vines were used in creation of wands of sleep , while cedars and beech were logged for export.\nGanathwood was the home of an ancient elven society that shared their heritage with the elves of Yuirwood who were long dead by 1369 DR. The edges of the wood held a group of escaped Thayan and Mulhorandi slaves that over the course of years became savage, surviving on marauding villages of Murghôm. Some of these almost feral individuals entertained thoughts of conquering the capital of Mulhorand, Skuld."
