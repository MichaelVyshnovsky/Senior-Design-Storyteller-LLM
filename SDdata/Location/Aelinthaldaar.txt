Aelinthaldaar was the capital city of Illefarn, an ancient elven civilization in northwest Faer√ªn. The city was located where Waterdeep would later stand.
The city was founded circa  and stood for some seven thousand years.
However, the elves destroyed their own city in  when they retreated to Evermeet. The coronal of Illefarn ordered the whole city razed with elven high magic, leaving very little behind to indicate it had ever been there.
The elves of Aelinthaldaar created a magical effect, or mythal, known as the Melairshield, which prevented the plateau from collapsing, regardless of activities below the surface. It remained in effect into the 14 century DR.
All that physically remained of Aelinthaldaar were crypts below the Pantheon Temple of the Seldarine in Waterdeep.
