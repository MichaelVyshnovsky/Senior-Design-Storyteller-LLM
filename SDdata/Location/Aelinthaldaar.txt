'''Aelinthaldaar''' was the capital city of [[Illefarn]], an ancient [[elf|elven]] civilization in [[northwest Faerûn]]. The city was located where [[Waterdeep]] would later stand.

==History==
The city was founded ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-8500}} and stood for some seven thousand years.

However, the elves destroyed their own city in {{Yearlink|-1100}} when they [[retreat]]ed to [[Evermeet]]. The coronal of Illefarn ordered the whole city razed with [[elven high magic]], leaving very little behind to indicate it had ever been there.

==Legacy==
The elves of Aelinthaldaar created a magical effect, or ''[[mythal]]'', known as the [[Melairshield]], which prevented the plateau from collapsing, regardless of activities below the surface. It remained in effect into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

All that physically remained of Aelinthaldaar were crypts below the [[Pantheon Temple of the Seldarine]] in Waterdeep.
