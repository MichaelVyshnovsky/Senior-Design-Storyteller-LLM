The Lair of the Unspeakable was a secret yikarian location nestled deep beneath the Court District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The lair was actually a large artificially-made cavern located underground.
Continual light spells were used to illuminate much of the cavern.
This lair was the hideout of the Unspeakable, a yak-man high priest of considerable power. The Unspeakable had a group of dao servants dig out his lair in under a week.
The Unspeakable used this cavern to store the bodies of both himself and the Watcher. The bodies were cared for and guarded by other servants of the Unspeakable in addition to a pair of dao.
Three other yak-men, called the Harvester, the Guardian, and the Destroyer, also used the cavern.
