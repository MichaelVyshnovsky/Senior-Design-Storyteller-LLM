'''Srelanat''' was an important trade town in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]]. It stood on the mouth of the [[Ranu River]] at the terminus of the [[Srelanat Road]].

==Economy==
The town was home to the oldest and most productive [[emerald]] mines in southern Malatra. These mines were found on temple land, and thus they and the town were tightly controlled by the priesthood under Priest [[Kalivan]] ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].

With such riches, there was much crime and [[Kuong_Kingdom#Society|jinyan]] flourished here. The town was the center of a widespread [[gem]] smuggling network.
