The local dzong-pon (sheriff or district official) was her puppet, while the warriors of Pim Tung were her men. \nThe sign of Pim Tung was a burning arrow, which marked the representatives of the town.\nThe warriors of Pim Tung were adorned with the burning arrow and tied their scabbards to their belts with a distinctive red cord. Holangs men were common in Motra and Joya and bluntly interrogated anyone who passed through Pim Tungs lands."
