        "mainbody": "County\nCarrelath Barony was a part of the monarchy of Erlkazar encompassing the territory of the Kuldin Peaks.\nThe Kuldin Peaks contained garrisons for Erlkazars army. The troops guarded the gap in the Iltkazar Range and defended the headwaters of the Shining Stream. In addition, Carrelath contained a few small mining villages and religious sites.\nThe barony was the westernmost of Erlkazars five baronies. It bordered Impresk in the north, Shalanar in the east, and Tanistan in the south.\nThe entire territory was foothills, passes, or mountains of the Kuldin Peaks.\nWhile in name ruled by a baron, in truth the true power rested in the hands of a shield dwarven priest, as had been the case since the time of Shanatar.\n Golconda  This mining village contained an old Calishite fortress from the Third Age of Calimshan.\n Ravimors Cave  This cave south of Tibold contained a rift thought to descend all the way to Deep Shanatar.\n Tibold  This mining town was the location of the barons home and was built atop dwarven ruins.\nThe area had been settled since the time of Shanatar. In fact, the town of Tibold was the oldest continuously occupied location in the Lands of Intrigue, founded some 2,600 years before the start of the Dalereckoning.\nBefore the Tethyrian Interregnum, the area was one of the counties of Tethyr."
