It consisted of three towers, each standing three stories tall. These caverns, along with the three structures within them, were collectively known as the Keeper Enclave, the headquarters of The Keepers.\nLochlord Gideonaâ€™s personal quarters are located in the southern tower, where she oversees the operations of the Keepers and manages the defense of the enclave.\nThe Keeper Enclave was as a formidable fortress, with its water approaches guarded by charmed merrow and its land routes defended by guards, monsters, and undead creatures that patrolled both the land and the towers of the Keepers.\nThe northwest tower was fortified by nine guards, including one spellcaster, while the southern and eastern towers each had thirteen guards. The guards were equipped with chain mail and long swords, but their primary role was to operate the ballistae that defended the enclave. Light and medium ballistae are mounted on the roofs of all three towers, one of each on the northwest tower, and one light and two medium ballistae on the other two."
