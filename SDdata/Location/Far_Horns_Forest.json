        "mainbody": "The '''Far Horns Forest''' was a massive forest that covered much of [[north Faerûn]] during the time of [[Netheril]]. It once made up much of the western and southern frontier of Netheril, but over time was much reduced in extent until it was broken up into smaller remnant forests.",
        "Description": "The Far Horns were named for the region's ability to carry sounds long distances. It was possible for a man standing on the [[Greypeak Mountains]] to blow a [[horn]] and have it heard as far away as [[the Flats]], while other noises from the forest floor could be carried many miles away as the local twisted air currents aided in their transmission.",
        "Geography": "The Far Horns once stretched between the [[High Forest]] and the expansive plains of Netheril, reaching from the foothills of the [[Barren Mountains]] in the north almost to the [[Bodensee River]] and [[the Hollow]] in the south. In the north, it bordered on the [[Rengath ancestral lands]], while towards the south it met the Greypeak Mountains, the [[Purple Mountains]], the Flats, and [[the Moss]], as well as the [[Angardt ancestral lands]].\n\nThe forest surrounded much of the upper [[Winding Water]] as it flowed out of the Moss, and also served as the origin for the [[Sunderiver]] and [[Moray River]], two tributaries of the [[Zweihaus River]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[Thundercall]] [[orc]]s lived in the northern parts of the forest and were infamous for their fearsome warhorns, but were kept from being a threat by aggressive patrols from [[Unity]]. Another tribe, the [[Greenhaven]] orcs, lived in the central reaches of the forest near the Moss. They raided the nearby Netherese settlements and used flaming [[arrow]]s to hunt the [[troll]]s in the Moss, until they were destroyed by the vengeful trolls. Those trolls in turn used the Far Horns as their hunting ground.\n\nMany [[gnome]]s who had escaped from the slavery of [[Netheril]] ended up settling in the Far Horns, with [[forest gnome]]s consolidating in the later [[Far Forest]]. [[Wood giant]]s, [[satyr]]s, and [[nymph]]s also lived within the forest.",
        "History": "[[File:Netheril goblins.png|thumb|''Goblins lurked in the shadows.'']]\nThe city of Unity was founded within the edge of the forest in {{yearlinkConvert|614|NY}}, becoming a military base for fighting against local [[goblin]]s and other threats.\n\n{{yearlinkConvert|1014|NY}} saw the founding of [[Westwendt Village]] near the [[Mines of Dekanter]], serving as a central market with the elves of [[Illefarn]] and [[Eaerlann]], and the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]].\n\nDuring the Silver Age of Netheril ({{yearlink|-2758}} to {{yearlink|-2208}}), the Greenhaven orcs were wiped out by the furious trolls they had hunted.\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Netheril ({{yearlink|-2207|}} to {{yearlink|-1206}}), orcs, goblins, and [[kobold]]s began aggressively attacking Westwendt, leading to an extended period of war for the town and the surrounding area.\n\nThe city of [[Wreathe]] was founded in {{yearlinkConvert|1714|NY}} at the foot of the Purple Mountains, and became a frontier mining town famed for the hunting opportunities in the nearby wilderness.\n\nA [[beholder]] [[spelljammer]] crash-landed near Westwendt in {{yearlinkConvert|3023|NY}}, causing a large fire that destroyed much of the local forest.\n\n[[File:Wreathe blue dragon attack.png|thumb|300px|''Brightstrike's children removed Wreathe from the map.'']]\nWreathe was attacked in {{yearlinkConvert|3315|NY}} by three ancient [[blue dragon]]s, the children of [[Brightstrike]]. Seeking revenge for their mother's slaying hundreds of years earlier, the wyrms slowly destroyed the city over a period of days.\n\nThe bandit lord [[Olostin]] sited himself in [[Dread Keep]] and began raiding western Netheril in {{yearlinkConvert|3348|NY}}, starting with a gruesome attack on Unity. He was finally slain in {{yearlinkConvert|3382|NY}}, and was discovered to have been working with the [[phaerimm]].\n\nThe [[archwizard]] [[Karsus]] established his [[Eileanar|enclave]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3185|NY}}, and proceeded to hover over the Far Horns during the winter months, much to the displeasure of the locals.\n\nWith the spread of the [[Anauroch]] desert caused by the phaerimms after {{YearlinkConvert|3398|NY}}, the folk of Low Netheril migrated away in search of more liveable lands, with many moving into the Far Forest. Within a few centuries the combination of deforestation and desertification had severely reduced the forest and fragmented it into the [[Forgotten Forest]], [[Northdark Woods]], [[Forest of Wyrms]], [[Weathercote Wood]], and Far Forest, with the empty ground between them becoming the [[Fallen Lands]], the [[Lonely Moor]], and [[Pelleor's Prairie]]. These Netherese settlers pressed on the traditional lands of [[Najara]] and even colonized the eastern [[Serpent Hills]], forcing the native [[ophidian]]s and [[lizardfolk]] into retreat.{{Cite interactive atlas|B1cNEIc}}{{Cite interactive atlas|B1aSEIC}}\n\nA horde of [[fiend]]s attacked [[Unity]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3499|NY}}, leading to a three-year war that had Karsus himself leading a counter-attack that banished or slew the extra-planar invaders. In the same year, fiends attacked Westwendt and razed it to the ground. The use of [[heavy magic]] during the conflict by Karsus's forces led to magically-mutated monsters and other oddities emerging from the forest in {{yearlinkConvert|3514|NY}}.\n\nThe fall of Netheril in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}} saw the exodus of the entire surviving Netherese population, many of them migrating into the [[Backlands]] region and forcing the remaining ophidians to abandon the Serpent Hills entirely and take refuge in nearby [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]] while they regained their strength. The city of Unity survived the Fall, but was slowly depopulated and abandoned as the Anauroch encroached on it over time.",
