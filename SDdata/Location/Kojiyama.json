        "Description": "Kojiyama was located in [[Takako Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. The majestic peak remained snow-capped throughout the year. The [[Imperial Post Road]] ran along the base of Kojiyama, but the mountain's rugged terrain detered most from venturing beyond the road's confines.",
        "Inhabitants": "Kojiyama's unforgiving heights served as a haven for hermits, ascetics, and bandits seeking solitude or evading the world's gaze. The elusive [[Frozen Waterfall Shrine]] was located above the snow-line. The majority of Kojiyama hermits remained oblivious to the presence of this secretive sanctuary.",
        "History": "Kojiyama played a significant role as the last bastion of local resistance during the [[Hojo War]]."
