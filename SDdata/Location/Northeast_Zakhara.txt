'''Northeast [[Zakhara]]''' was in many ways the antithesis to the civilization of the rest of the continent. It comprised the [[Land of the Yak-Men]] with their evil [[Yikarian Empire|empire]] within the [[World Pillar Mountains]] (the Zakharan part of the [[Yehimal]]<ref><ref>) and the untamed expanse of the [[Jungle of Monsters]] towards the [[Foreigners' Sea]]. Together they effectively cut off land travel towards [[Kara-Tur]] in the northeast and east.{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

==Geographic limits==
The region separated three continents: to the [[Southeast Faerûn|northwest]] lay the realm of [[Konigheim]] of [[Faerûn]]'s [[Utter East]], to the north lay the [[Kingdom of Nix]] and beyond to the north and northeast the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]] of [[Kara-Tur]]. To the east, the Sempadan Forest stretched into the eastern continent, while northeast Zakhara ended at the shores of the Foreigner's Sea in the southeast. Towards the [[East Zakhara|south]], it was bordered by the territory of Zakhara's [[Cities of the Ancients]], to the [[Interior Zakhara|southwest]] it fell towards the desert of the [[Haunted Lands]], and to the [[North Zakhara|west]] it touched the lands around the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Utaqa]] and the [[Great Sea]].

==Land of the Yak-Men==
{{Main|Land of the Yak-Men}}
The [[yak folk]] controlled their petty empire from their cities on the heights of the World Pillar Mountains, seeing all other inhabitants of the rugged land as their subjects or slaves. Their domain, organized into eight provinces, was ruled from the capital city of [[Nathong]] by the [[Emperor of the Lotus Throne|Lotus Emperor]], but ultimately it was a theocracy where all authority derived from the yikaria's [[Faceless God]].

==Jungle of Monsters==
{{Main|Sempadan Forest}}
This vast forest was rarely traveled with only a few settlements at the fringes<ref> (and none in the center) known to the outside world. Its fierce denizens were dangerous enough to mount attacks on their well-organized yikarian neighbors.<ref>
