The Quarters of the Unclean was the name of the poor sector of the city of Dhaztanar in Semphar.
This district of the city lay in the east with much of it bordering the northern shore of the Tarkhold River.
This quarter lay outside of the protective walls of the city. It was crowded with small hovels that leaned against each other for support. Tiny walkways were present but were easily congested. Thieves could easily disappear within the cramped confines of the Quarters of the Unclean.
