Jethaere was a Netherese enclave.
To its inhabitants, or at least Evaereol Rathrane, Jethaere was a refuge for those who truly loved magic, rather than seek it for power. However, it had suffered great losses fighting the Phaerimm some of its mages fled rather than perish.
Jethaere wasnt amongst the cities whose remains were identified after the Fall of High Netheril.
