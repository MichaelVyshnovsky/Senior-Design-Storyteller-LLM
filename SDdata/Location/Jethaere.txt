'''Jethaere''' was a [[Netherese]] enclave.

==History==
To its inhabitants, or at least [[Evaereol Rathrane]], Jethaere was a refuge for those who truly loved magic, rather than seek it for power. However, it had suffered great losses fighting the [[Phaerimm]]; some of its mages fled rather than perish.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|199|12}}

Jethaere wasn't amongst the cities whose remains were identified after the Fall of High Netheril.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Evaereol Rathrane]]
