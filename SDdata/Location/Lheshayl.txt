Hunting was a popular pastime in Lheshayl, attracting ambitious hunters from other regions during its many "official" hunting seasons, enforced by the Emerald Enclave. The hunting seasons usually were scheduled for late summer and autumn with an emphasis on Eleint, Marpenoth, and Uktar.

The  brought a series of attacks by an increased population of saber-toothed tiger. The citizens of Ormath and Lheshayl and patrols of the Shining Plains were the targets. These deadly attacks completely devastated several trade caravans, and entire patrol parties were gone without a trace. The tiger attacks were stopped by the mercenary companies of the Shining Plains, securing profitable trade with Hlondeth.

Eventually, Lheshayl adopted a semi-official policy to make sure to drive animals into the Rushing Hills to avoid further attacks.
Circa the , Lheshayl became plagued by horse thefts and slaver abductions. Travelers who fell victim to the slavers were sold off in the city of Nimpeth. The Chief was more concerned with horse-stealings and cared little for the abductions.
