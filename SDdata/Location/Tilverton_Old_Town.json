        "Description": "The Old Town sat atop a large knoll that stood out from the plains of [[Tilver's Gap]]. It could be accessed by the [[Cormyr Stairs]], [[Market Stairs]], [[Tilver Stairs]], or [[Upper City Gate]]. It was a gardenlike maze of streets that wound between widely-spaced, well-appointed buildings, with the ruins of [[Tilver's Palace]] looming above it all. New construction was illegal in the Old Town, only permitted on an individual basis by a special vote of the ruling Council.",
        "History": "The Old Town started as Tilver's Palace, the castle home of the [[archmage]] [[Tilvara]]. A small trading settlement of [[human]]s and [[elf|elves]] grew up around and underneath it, ultimately outliving Tilvara. While the old prestigious buildings of the Old Town sat atop the knoll, campgrounds and cattleyards spread out on the plains below. While the lower city was much transformed by the efforts of [[Cormyr]] following annexation in [[1356 DR]], the Old Town went almost untouched.\n\nWhen Tilverton was destroyed in [[1372 DR]] and transformed into the [[Black Crater]], the Old Town was the last area to be subsumed by [[shadowstuff]] as the bulk of the knoll briefly kept it above the disaster."
