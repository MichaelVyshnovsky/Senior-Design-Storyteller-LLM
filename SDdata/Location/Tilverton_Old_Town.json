        "mainbody": "he Old Town of Tilverton was the oldest and most prestigious part of the city.\nThe Old Town sat atop a large knoll that stood out from the plains of Tilvers Gap. It could be accessed by the Cormyr Stairs, Market Stairs, Tilver Stairs, or Upper City Gate. It was a gardenlike maze of streets that wound between widely-spaced, well-appointed buildings, with the ruins of Tilvers Palace looming above it all. New construction was illegal in the Old Town, only permitted on an individual basis by a special vote of the ruling Council.\nThe Old Town started as Tilvers Palace, the castle home of the archmage Tilvara. A small trading settlement of humans and elves grew up around and underneath it, ultimately outliving Tilvara. While the old prestigious buildings of the Old Town sat atop the knoll, campgrounds and cattleyards spread out on the plains below. While the lower city was much transformed by the efforts of Cormyr following annexation in 1356 DR, the Old Town went almost untouched.\nWhen Tilverton was destroyed in 1372 DR and transformed into the Black Crater, the Old Town was the last area to be subsumed by shadowstuff as the bulk of the knoll briefly kept it above the disaster."
