Threlloch was a Northlander settlement on the island of Canthrell in Norheim in the Moonshae Isles.
Threlloch was located near the center of the island on the southeastern shore along the Sea of Moonshae which sheltered the settlement from the harsh storms that rolled in from the Trackless Sea. It was the only settlement on Canthrell.
