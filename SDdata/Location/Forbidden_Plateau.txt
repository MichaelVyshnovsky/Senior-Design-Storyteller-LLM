The Forbidden Plateau was a high plateau lying beside a glacier in the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains of the Yehimal, in the Utter East of southeast Faer√ªn. It was the site of the Kingdom of Nix.The geographic location of Nix is determined by comparing the game map of Blood & Magic with standard maps of the region.
The only way to reach it was through the elusive Phantom Pass, but even then, Nix only appeared once a year, around harvest-time. Vanesci Hamlet, a human settlement, lay near the entrance in Konigheim, many miles from Nix.
The almost-alien landscape around Nix was covered in slabs of gray stone and greenish swamps dotted with ponds. The trees were weirdly formed, with tendril-like branches and above-ground roots.
