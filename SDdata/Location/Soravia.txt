The '''Duchy of Soravia''' was the newest of the [[Damara]]n provinces as of [[1357 DR]].

==Geography==
Soravia initially only occupied the valleys along the southern section of Damara's three rivers. It was not until the defeat of [[Zhengyi]] when the duchy expanded to include all lands west of [[Brandiar]] and north of [[Polten]] and [[Morov]], covering roughly half of Damara.

==Description==
Soravia was similar in size to [[Carmathan]] when initially founded. However, after the defeat of the Witch-King's forces, the duchy swelled to become the largest region of Damara.

Much of the landmass of Soravia was covered with barren tundra and open grasslands.

==History==
The Witch-King created the duchy to serve as a strategic buffer between his forces and those of other populous regions in Damara.

==Inhabitants==
Soravia was home to 12,000 Damarans with [[Kinbrace]] as the capital. All Soravians fiercely valued their independence.
