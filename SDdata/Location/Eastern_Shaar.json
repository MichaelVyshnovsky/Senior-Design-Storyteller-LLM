        "mainbody": "The '''Eastern Shaar''' was an eastern extension of the [[Shaar]], separated by the [[Landrise]]. Compared to the fertile grasslands of its western counterpart, the Eastern Shaar was a relative wasteland.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] led to the formation of the [[Underchasm]], these roles were reversed, as the canyon cut the Western Shaar off from all sources of fresh water, turning the region from a savannah into a desert. The Eastern Shaar, however, still had rivers flowing in from the [[Unthangol Mountains|Unthangol]] and [[Toadsquat Mountains]], and even gained a more moderate climate due to the now-nearby [[Gulf of Luiren]].\n\nAs of [[1479 DR]], [[Okoth]], a reawakened realm of the [[sarrukh]], lay directly south of [[Azulduth]] (the [[Lake of Salt]]), and the [[Gulf of Luiren]], which was a realm named [[Luiren]] before the [[Spellplague]], lay to the south of Okoth. The eastern portion of the Eastern Shaar was called the [[Beastlands]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "Like its western counterpart, the Eastern Shaar was home to wild [[horse]]s. Populations of [[Shaaran zebra]]s roamed here, and the [[gold dwarf|gold dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]] spread [[hammer pony|hammer ponies]] throughout the region via the markets of [[Hammer and Anvil]].\n\nAlthough found in other parts of [[Toril]], [[beguiler]]s were most common in the dry plains of the Eastern Shaar. Other local creatures included [[baboon]]s, [[badger]]s, [[bat]]s, [[bison]]s, [[black bear|black]] and [[brown bear]]s, [[boar]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[darkenbeast]]s, [[flying snake]]s, [[giant ant]]s, [[giant eagle]]s, [[giant fire beetle]]s, [[giant praying mantis]]es, [[giant stag beetle]]s, [[giant wasp]]s, [[griffon]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[hyena]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[lion]]s, [[lynx]]es, [[monitor lizard]]s, [[monstrous scorpion]]s, [[night hunter]]s, [[nyth (creature)|nyths]], [[peryton]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[sinister]]s, [[viper]]s and [[wyvern]]s."

        "History": "Sometime in the last 6 millennia before [[Dalereckoning]], at a time when [[Jhaamdath]] still stood to the northwest of the Eastern Shaar, a pitched battle between [[yuan-ti]] and [[giant]]s took place at the [[Lorrift]]. The event came to be known as the [[Rain of Flying Snakes]], as the yuan-ti summoned thousands of [[snake]]s from the empty sky to land on the giants' heads. This gambit did not end up winning the serpentfolk the fight, as the snakes that survived their fall turned on their summoners and ensured the victory of the opposing force.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Shaar Battles during Jhaamdath}}",
        "Inhabitants": "The largest and most well-known human tribes of the Eastern Shaar included the [[Cheetah Tribe]], who lived in the grasslands between the Unthangol Mountains, the Great Rift, and the Council Hills; the [[Hyena Tribe]], whose domain lay between the Council Hills, the [[Riftwood]], and the [[Sharawood]]; and the [[Rhinoceros Tribe]], whose home was between the [[Great Rift]], the [[Landrise]], the [[Chondalwood]] and the [[Forest of Amtar]].\n\nA number of bandit tribes were also known, chief among them the horse-riding [[Grey Ghosts tribe]] led by [[Furifax]]. Based out of [[Bandit City]] to the south of Unthangol Pass, this group exerted great influence over the small trading towns between [[Hardcastle]] and [[Azulduth]].\n\nBesides humans, the Eastern Shaar was also inhabited by tribes of [[gnolls]],{{Cite organized play/LFR/Marauder's Spear|4}}\n\nThe Eastern Shaar was also home to a number of [[Crinti]] runaways from Dambrath, who typically either kept to the wilderness or sought refuge among the gold dwarf towns around the Great Rift."
