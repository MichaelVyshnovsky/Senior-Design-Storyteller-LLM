Thus it is not always clear which mentions of \"Ithmong\" pertain to the one in Tethyr and which to the one in Lapaliiya. However, the Tethyrian Ithmong is more well known and better detailed. was a metropolis and the capital of [[Tethyr]].\n{{TOC limit}}",
        "Geography": "It lay on the [[River Ith]]. Its central location ensured that the queen's armies in [[1479 DR]] were never more than five days' hard ride from any trouble in her domain.",
        "Description": "The city included a scenic river walk paved with red bricks and decorated with [[lilac]] and [[honeysuckle]] and flanked with [[willow]] trees.",
        "Layout": "[[File:Darromar map.png|thumb|right|300px|''A map of the city, showing its four quarters.'']]\nThe city was divided into quarters by the River Ith (east&ndash;west) and the [[Ithal Road]] (north&ndash;south), with the [[Ithal Bridge]] in the center. Clockwise from the northwest quarter to the southwest quarter were:\n* [[Darromar/Royal Quarter|The Royal Quarter]],\n* [[Darromar/Black Quarter|The Black Quarter]],\n* [[Darromar/Caravan Quarter|The Caravan Quarter]], and\n* [[Darromar/Temple Quarter|The Temple Quarter]].",
        "Government": "The city was formerly ruled by a council, but [[Queen Zaranda]] felt that it was necessary to have one person in charge at the top. This position was held by the Lord-Mayor [[Ternan Grannox]] in [[1370 DR]]. It was a position that was appointed or elected once every three years. In truth, however, Ternan's Consort [[Brenna Grannox]] dictated her husband's every move, manipulating him with lies that resulted in some improper treatment of her social and/or political foes.",
        "Military": "The city watch had around 200 members, but the army of Tethyr, a further 5,000, was garrisoned in this city when not on duty or assigned elsewhere.",
        "History": "The settlement began as a [[Calimshan|Calishite]] frontier garrison town named '''Calimaronn''' until it was sacked in the [[Battle for Calimaronn]] by [[Tethyrian]] tribes led by Chieftain [[Mong Ithal]] of [[Clan Ithal]]. The town was named Ithmong from thenceforth."
