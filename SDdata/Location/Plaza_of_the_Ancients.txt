The Plaza of the Ancients was an open courtyard found in Muluk, the City of Kings, in 1367 DR.
This public square featured two extraordinary monuments honoring two of Muluks greatest historical rulers—Amakim ibn Issad and Aswar al-Mutiq.
Many pilgrims traveling from Muluk to Huzuz would begin their arduous journey from the Plaza of the Ancients.
