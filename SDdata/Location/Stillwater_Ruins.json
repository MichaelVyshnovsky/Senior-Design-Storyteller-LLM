        "mainbody": "Stillwater Ruins was the remnant of the area of Myth Drannor once called Stillwater Shrine that housed one of the entrance gates that led into the areas surrounding Castle Cormanthor.\nOne of the citys many fountains filled with healing waters laid to the east of the main gate. The fountain still retained its magic long past the citys destruction in the Weeping War.\nthumb|220x220px|The healing water fountain of Stillwater Ruins.\nThe area had one of the entrances to the Dwarven Dungeons, protected by a glyph and a word of power. A drawbridge led to the Windrider Glade from Stillwater.\nIn its ruined state, this area was overgrown with grass with destroyed towers, shrines, and other structures littering the grounds.\nIn 1369 DR, the Stillwater Ruins gate was the landing point for the adventuring groups sent by Elminster to stop the corruption and occupation of the city by the Cult of the Dragon.\nThe first expedition, led by Athan, was ambushed by Pelendralaar who scattered and captures survivors. Sometime later, the second group of adventurers from Phlan stepped from the gate.\nIn 1369 DR this area of the ruins served as a shelter for Faeril and Beriand, the survivors of Athans party.\nHalfling trader and scavenger named Nottle parked his magically warded wagon in the Stillwater Ruins, doing business with the adventurers and the Cultists that passed through the gates.\nThe area was not safe, especially after dark. The Stillwater Ruins were plagued by the undead created by the pool of radiance, raised by the Cultists, as well as the orcs that feuded over territory with the Cult."
