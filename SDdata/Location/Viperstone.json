        "mainbody": "'''Viperstone''' was a small hamlet on the shores of the scenic [[Firedrake Bay]], along the [[Firedrake Road]], in [[Tethyr]]. It was best known for its dealings with [[Calishite]] [[alchemist]]s.",
        "Description": "The small village was one of many hamlets that were sprinkled along the minor trade route of the Firedrake Road, which bent along the [[Firedrake Shores]], through the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]], and reached the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]]. Viperstone was among the more notable hamlets, along with its closest southern neighbor, the hamlet of [[Rock Orchard]].\n\nThe hamlet's name came from the abundant population of [[venom|venomous]] [[snake]]s found sunning on the nearby rocks. This regularly brought a number of alchemists from the land of [[Calimshan]], who gathered baskets full of the dangerous creatures at a time."
