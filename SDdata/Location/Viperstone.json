        "mainbody": "iperstone was a small hamlet on the shores of the scenic Firedrake Bay, along the Firedrake Road, in Tethyr. It was best known for its dealings with Calishite alchemists.\nThe small village was one of many hamlets that were sprinkled along the minor trade route of the Firedrake Road, which bent along the Firedrake Shores, through the Dragons Neck Peninsula, and reached the Dragons Head Peninsula. Viperstone was among the more notable hamlets, along with its closest southern neighbor, the hamlet of Rock Orchard.\nThe hamlets name came from the abundant population of venomous snakes found sunning on the nearby rocks. This regularly brought a number of alchemists from the land of Calimshan, who gathered baskets full of the dangerous creatures at a time."
