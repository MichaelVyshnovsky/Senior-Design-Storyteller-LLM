'''Blackstone''' was a small mining town located in the kingdom of [[Callidyrr]] on the island of [[Alaron]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
Blackstone was nestled on the far southwestern end of the [[Fairheight Range]] in northern Callidyrr overlooking the border with [[Gnarhelm]]. The town served as the start for the western branch of the [[High King's Road]].

==Description==
The road leading to Blackstone from [[Caer Callidyrr]] was well-maintained and paved with white granite. Blackstone appeared to be more of a collection of provision shops, with housing added as an afterthought. Black smoke from the nearby mines permeated the valley where Blackstone was located.
