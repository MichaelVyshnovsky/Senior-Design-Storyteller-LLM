        "mainbody": "oktil was a village in the East Reaches of Cormyr.\nNoktil was a small, unchanging village of about 50 buildings.\nThe village lay along the Immerflow, about halfway between Masoners Bridge and the Wyvernwater. It was only a short distance from the Hullack Forest.\nNoktil was administered from Arabel by the lord of Arabel.\nNoktil was renowned for its bread and wood production, which was exported across Cormyr, but most of its trade was with Immersea. Three waterwheels on the Immerflow powered an assortment of flour mills, and the bakers of Nokil produced enough bread to send all across Cormyr. \nThe wood was springy and malleable when green and extremely strong when dried, reputed to be the strongest in Cormyr. Bows made with the wood had a terrifically hard pull, and were able to launch missiles with incredible range and power. The shafts of quarrels and arrows made with the wood were especially lethal, and reputed to be as strong as iron. Other bespoke woodworking products were exported to Suzail, custom ordered by the wealthy nobility there.\nThe village had a single inn and an equipment shop, which traded in farm tools more than adventuring tools. Adventurers and explorers arrived in the village every spring to prepare expeditions into the Hullack Forest, which the locals did not appreciate due to the risk of a dangerous entity being roused and emerging from the forest.\nThe village had no walls or other built defenses, and had a volunteer militia of locals who were primarily archers. Equipped with their masterwork bows, the militia had a reputation for exceptional accuracy despite not being professional soldiers.\nAround 1367 DR, rumor had it that a master elven archer dwelt in Noktil, teaching the locals to craft their impressively strong bows and training their militia in expert archery techniques. The villagers refused to comment on such matters."
