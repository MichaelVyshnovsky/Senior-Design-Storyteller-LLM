The Glacier of the Dragon was a large glacier located within A-Ling Shan and Katakoro Shan of the Yehimal.
This glacier had the shape of a serpent if viewed from above, making many believed that this was where its name orginated.
White dragons used the Glacier of the Dragon as a site for a major breeding ground. Miles of honey-combed chambers could be found beneath the surface of the glacier, many used as rookeries for the dragons.
In order to increase the protection of their young, the white dragons allowed the presence of other dangerous creatures such as yeti, cave bears, snow leopards, and greater oni.
