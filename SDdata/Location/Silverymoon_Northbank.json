        "mainbody": "Northbank was the heart of the city of Silverymoon, located north of the River Rauvin.\nNorthbank was the older of the two main sections of the city, linked to the newer Southbank by the famous magical Moonbridge.\nBeneath the district was a sewer system, flushed by the waters of three built-over streams that emptied into the River Rauvin.\nNorthbank&mdashand the settlement now known as Silverymoon&mdashbegan as an inn established in 447 DR as the Moonsilver Inn. By 459 DR, the logging camp built around the inn became Silver Village. The village became Silverymoon Town in 574 DR and took on its first mayor. The first walls of the city were constructed in 637 DR. By 734 DR, the city had grown to be overcrowded, and the walls were torn down, and new ones were built that almost doubled the area of the city. These walls marked the borders of Northbank for centuries afterward. Sometime around 1372 DR, the walls on the east were expanded outwards to make more room for further construction on the High Palace and Star Court.\n* Adbar Trading Coster\n* The Hammer and the Helm\n* A Handful of Stars\n* The High Palace\n* House of the Harp\n* The Map House\n* Optyms Blade\n* The Stagstand\n* Star Court\n* Sundabar Commons\n* The Shining Scroll\n* The Wyrmworks\n* Bright Blade Brandished\n* The Dancing Goat\n* The Golden Oak\n* Helmers Wall\n* Wayward House\n* Athenaeum of Philosophy, a temple dedicated to Dugmaren Brightmantle.\n* Everdusk Hall, a temple dedicated to the whole Elven pantheon.\n* Fortune Hall, a temple dedicated to Tymora.\n* The Halls of Inspiration, a temple dedicated to both Milil and Oghma.\n* The House Invincible, a temple dedicated to Helm.\n* Rhyesters Matins, a temple dedicated to Lathander.\n* Silverglen, a grove and temple dedicated to Silvanus.\n* The Temple of Silver Stars, a temple dedicated to Sel√ªne.\n* The Tower of Balance, a temple dedicated to Mystra."
