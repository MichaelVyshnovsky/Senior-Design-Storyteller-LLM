        "mainbody": "The North Country of Rashemen was the northernmost region of the magocratic nation, isolated from its larger towns and fishing villages.\nDespite the clear distinction between the two, the region was not so different from the Central Plains to the south.\nIt composed over half of Rashemens overall geographical territory, incorporating a stretch of the Endless Wastes and the stretch of land just south of the Icerim Mountains.\nThe region was dotted with ancient ruins originating from ancient Raumathar and Narfell.\nSpeaking to most Rashemaar people, outlanders might believe that the North Country was an entirely separate country from the Central Plains.\nLocal legends spoke of brave Rashemaar nobles that ventured into the regions ruins and returned with fantastic riches and even magical items.\nNot many Rashemaar lived in the North Country by choice, those doing so banded together in scattered farmsteads that were invariably formed around the local ruins."
