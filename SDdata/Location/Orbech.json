        "History": "Orbech was founded in the {{YearlinkName|260}}, as a frontier town on the border of [[Chondalwood]] along with Timindar.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|267}}, Orbech and Timindar were destroyed in the [[Battle of Fallen Trees]]. The short but deadly war was waged by the [[elves]] of Chondalwood and the [[Emerald Enclave]] as retaliation for logging. A few inhabitants of Orbech survived and fled to the city of [[Shamph]], bearing a dire message from the elves: \"Advance no further into our homeland.\" In response, Chondath assembled an army of 10,000 and marched into the Chondalwood in retaliation for the massacre. The following battle became known as the [[Crushed Helm Massacre]] of Chondath.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], only a few stone structures remained among the rubble as a grim monument to the conflicts of the past. Most folk chose to avoid the destroyed village apart from some reckless adventurers, and most of the ruins were picked clean by years of scavengers. The ruins were rumored to be haunted, with local sages knowing that the [[ghost]] stories were more than just tall tales."
