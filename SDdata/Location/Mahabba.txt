'''Mahabba''', also called the '''City of Charity''', was a major city found within the [[Pantheist League]] of [[interior Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
Mahabba was founded along the banks of [[Al-Musammas River]] in the south-east of the Pantheist League at the edge of [[Al-Sayaj Mountains]] bordering the area of the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]].<ref>

==History==
Mahabba was the latest to join the Pantheist Cities, and though centuries passed, military forces kept occupying the city against the rebellions of the pre-Pantheon cult of the goddess [[Bala]]. Because of the resulting oppressive atmosphere, Mahabba recently was called the '''City of Silence''' more often than its former title, the City of Charity.

==Activities==
Mahabba was a closed society, especially compared to its closest Pantheist neighbor [[Hudid]], occupied by its own military forces in an attempt to quickly quell any heretical [[Bala|Balanite]] uprisings. Armed checkpoints and patrols were a frequent site in the city. Caliph [[Mogan bin Ahmed]] was assassinated by Balanites in [[1360 DR]]. The Balanite threat was so real that even the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]] urged Mahabba's caliph to end the heresy by either negotiations or the sword.

Mahabba's moniker of the "City of Silence" came about since music was rarely played after the uprisings began. After all, Balanties were believed to spread their evil lies through music. [[Bard]]s were rarely welcomed in Mahabba. Even [[rawunin]] often reported to the local guard when entering the city to acquire armed bodyguards during their stay.

==Inhabitants==
Most of the city's residents were ashamed of their unenlightened past. Many natives were fearful by nature, both of strangers and even their own rulers.

Mahabba's caliph in 1367 DR was [[Ma'mum al-Sahnan]].

==Defenses==
The [[Sword of the True Gods]] kept 4,000 soldiers and 1,000 cavalry stationed in Mahabba. The city also maintained a watch of 2,000 guards and 50 clerical reserves. Mahabba did not have a formal navy as of 1367 DR. Before the rebellion Mahabba frequently sent long-ranging patrols beyond its walls.
