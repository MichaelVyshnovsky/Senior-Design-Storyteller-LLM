'''Hazamarch''' was one of the [[Golden Marches]] of [[Tethyr]]. It was an agriculturally focused county and struggled with competing monster populations.

==Description==
Monster hunters and adventurers were very welcome in Hazamarch. A high population of monsters lived in the area, particularly [[goblinoid]]s, and there were few settlements to produce troops to keep them at bay or trade roads for such troops to patrol.

Hazamarch produced [[barley]], millet, and [[cattle]].

==Geography==
County Hazamarch was located in the northeast of Tethyr. It was bordered on the west by county [[Varyth]] of the [[Crown Lands]]. To the north and east were [[Valashar (county)|Valashar]] and county [[Morninggold]] on the other side of the [[River Ith]]. The River Ith also formed the southern border, and on the other side was the [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|duchy]] of [[Suretmarch]].

The most interesting geological feature in Hazamarch was the [[Gorge of the Fallen Idol]], a steep-walled canyon carved by the River Ith as the river turned west to flow toward the sea.

==Government==
In [[1370 DR]], the moody [[paladin]] of the [[Order of the Silver Chalice]] and Marchlord of Tethyr, [[Rikos Dughol]], was the count of Hazamarch. His fortress was [[Iltarghal Keep]].

==Notable Locations==
; [[Chevangard]] : A temple of [[Helm]] in [[Survale Ford]] dedicated to the hero [[Chevan]].
; [[Gorge of the Fallen Idol]] : A canyon where an ancient monolith to the old [[hobgoblin]] deity [[Nomog-Geaya]] once stood.
; [[Survale Ford]] : A town on the River Ith dedicated to [[Helm]] and the only place east of [[Darromar]] where one could safely cross the river.
