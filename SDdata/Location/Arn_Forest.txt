The Arn Forest was a forest on the edge of the Silver Marches.
The Arn Forest was an area of pine forests and swamps, which did not see many visitors. On the edge of the forest stood Graevelwood, a small hidden settlement of rock gnomes. The western area of the forest was very rainy and marshy, unlike the eastern side. It was infested by several bands of kobolds and various ruins could be found inside that dated back to the ancient empire of Netheril.
It was located south of Ascore between Anauroch and the Nether Mountains.
The eastern region of the forest had scrub pines.
