Durmista was a duchy of Tethyr only in name. It was the eastern half of the  elven territory of the great Wealdath forest.
The name "Durmista" was Elvish for "Forest of Twilight". Its former name was briefly Suldusk after the name of its native wild elven tribe however, it was renamed Durmista by Lord Rhothomir, the Treespeaker of the Wealdath.
The official borders of Durmista placed it east of its sister duchy Noromath, south of Amn, and north of the Starspire Mountains. It shared borders with Spellshire, Varyth, and Rivershire. Notably, the elves cared little for such human distinctions.
In 1370 DR, Mirthal Aendryr was the official representative of the Suldusk tribes to the queen. Mirthal usually lived at Suldanessellar, but when he had to host a human noble, he would use the old safe house of the Company of Eight, The Eights Tree as his ducal stronghold.
The only true settlement within the eastern part of the forest was found in Suldanessellar.
