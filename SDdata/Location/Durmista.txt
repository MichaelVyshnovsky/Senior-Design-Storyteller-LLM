'''Durmista''' was a [[wikipedia:en:Duchy|duchy]] of [[Tethyr]] only in name. It was the eastern half of the  [[Elf|elven]] territory of the great [[Wealdath]] forest.

==Etymology==
The name "Durmista" was [[Elven language|Elvish]] for "Forest of Twilight". Its former name was briefly '''Suldusk''' after the name of [[Suldusk|its native wild elven tribe]]; however, it was renamed Durmista by Lord [[Rhothomir]], the [[Treespeaker]] of the Wealdath.

==Geography==
The official borders of Durmista placed it east of its sister duchy [[Noromath]], south of [[Amn]], and north of the [[Starspire Mountains]]. It shared borders with [[Spellshire]], [[Varyth]], and [[Rivershire]]. Notably, the elves cared little for such [[human]] distinctions.

==Government==
In [[1370 DR]], [[Mirthal Aendryr]] was the official representative of the [[Suldusk]] tribes to the [[Zaranda Star|queen]]. Mirthal usually lived at [[Suldanessellar]], but when he had to host a [[human]] noble, he would use the old safe house of the [[Company of Eight]], [[The Eight's Tree]] as his ducal stronghold.

==Notable Locations==
The only true settlement within the eastern part of the forest was found in Suldanessellar.
