        "mainbody": "ngelhead Mine was a mine found in the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR. It was likely named for the enormous statue of an angelic being found within its depths.The source of the name is unknown its assumed to be one of the statues, such as that shown on this page.\nthumb|right|350px|The interior of Angelhead Mine.\nThe mine lay beneath the hills just inland from Raven Cliff Beach, a short distance away from Cragmire Keep and Cragmire Barrow and just off the High Road north of Neverwinter.\nThe mine had several entrances standing amongst the hills.While several mine entrances appear in the Blackdagger Ruins zone in Neverwinter, only one of them is accessible as Angelhead Mine. Its assumed these are all part of the same mine. These were supported with high arches built into sturdy stone walls, with wooden pillars and a shelter out the front. Each arch was secured with a portcullis to bar entry.\nthumb|right|The runestone outside Angelhead Mine.\nFound lying amongst the rocks outside the main mine entrance was a runestone inscribed with runes of an unknown script and language. A translation read \"with a heavy pick slung over his shoulder the bearded miner heads deep into the earth in search of precious metals and gemstones the quintessential dwarf\".The runes are actually written in Elder Futhark, the oldest form of Norse and Germanic runes, which are presumed not to exist in the Realms.\nInside, the mines were a series of chambers hewn from the stone, with low ceilings and winding passages. Wooden supports lined the walls and ceilings, and wall-mounted torches and lanterns hanging from chains provided lighting. Scattered around was mining equipment, chains, barrels, and chests.\nAll around the mine, massive statues were being dug out of the rock, often found in odd orientations or with only a single body part visible. A head, a hand, a whole figure, or a beast all emerged from the rock. These were covered in timber scaffolding to keep them safe.\nThe mining efforts in Angelhead were led by forewoman Mira Thamros and owned by the dwarven merchant Melkhor Goldseeker. Melkhor made an agreement with the local Blackdagger Bandits, offering them a large portion of his profits in exchange for protection from their raids.\nthumb|right|250px|Part of a massive statue, possibly the \"angel head\".\nthumb|right|250px|The upside-down statue of a winged lion suspended from a ceiling.\nThe source of the statues and ruins in the mine, or how they got there, is unknown.That is, no explanation is given in Neverwinter. It may be a normal ancient ruin buried over time, the Spellplague spontaneously transporting these things underground, or a site buried in the Mount Hotenow eruption of 1451 DR. Taggots quest suggests a connection to Delzoun.\nThe mines were opened in the late 1470s DR by dwarf merchant Melkhor Goldseeker. However, they were in the territory of the Blackdagger Bandits, who demanded a large cut of the profits to leave them alone. Otherwise, they cared little for mining and the mines had no other value to them.\nThen, in the , Melkhors miners unearthed ancient ruins, statues, and the great stone head after which the mine was named. Learning of this and thinking they could find treasure too, the Blackdaggers reneged on their agreement with Melkhor and sent Krag Foultooth, the leader of their gnoll forces, to attack the mind, capture and enslave the miners, and take whatever treasure could be found for themselves. Krag took the forewoman Mira Thamros, Melkhors niece, hostage in order to ensure he would not disrupt their operations. Meanwhile, the Blackdaggers raided Melkhors wagons and bandit leader Marion Hexbane sent some of her men to the Broken Crown inn to apply their new leverage on Melkhor.\nthumb|right|The miners upon freed.\nFearing his business ruined and niece threatened, Melkhor gave up hope until an adventurer sent by Xalliana to investigate came to him. He admitted what had happened and asked the adventurer to check the wagons and go to the mining base camp to learn what had happened. There, a caravan guard and survivor of the attacks named Sergeant \"Dusty\" Yates explained what had happened and sent them to free the captives and recover the mine for her employer. The adventurer delved into the mines, slew the Blackdagger bandits along with their leader, and freed the miners and forewoman and ensured Mira made it out of the mines safe and sound.\nMeanwhile, the dwarf adventurer Taggot Ironshroud was searching caves in the area for relics from the ancient dwarven kingdom of Delzoun. He wished to retrieve them in order to preserve dwarven culture, rather than make a profit of them like the avaricious Melkhor."
