'''Alpuk''', also called the '''Central Basin''', was the largest of the three regions of the [[Great Glacier]] and the home of the [[Iulutiun]] people.

==Geography==
The Great Glacier was naturally divided into three regions. The largest region was Alpuk, located in the southwest and bordered by the [[Uppuk River]] in the north, the [[Tuutsaas Chain]] in the west, the [[Lugsaas Chain]] in the south, and the [[Keryjek Ridge]] in the east. The region of [[Angalpuk]] was to the east, and [[Nakvaligach]] to the north.

Alpuk encompassed the two largest seas in the Great Glacier, the [[Nakalpgotak Sea|Nakalpgotak]] and the [[Lugalpgotak Sea|Lugalpgotak]]. The mysterious mountainous region known as [[Novularond]], home of [[frost giant]]s and [[Arctic dwarf|arctic dwarves]], was also within its borders.

Most of the land was at a low elevation, but the ground was rough and occasionally contained rolling hills.

Average temperatures in Alpuk ranged from {{SIrange|-30|35|F|long=yes}}.

Only {{SIrange|5|8|in|c|long=yes}} of precipitation fell on Alpuk per year on average.

The ice depth over much of Alpuk was between {{SIrange|200|500|feet|long=yes}}, though it thinned to as little as {{SIrange|5|10|ft|long=yes}} in some areas.

==Flora & Fauna==
Wild [[caribou]] herds lived in the hills and mountains of Alpuk, though not nearly in the large numbers seen east in Angalpuk. The strange creatures known as "walrus dogs", or [[kupuk]], lived wild in Alpuk and were often tamed by the [[Ulutiun]]s.

Two monsters lived in Alpuk that caused fear among its people&mdash;[[white dragon]]s and the bizarre centipede-like [[tirichik]].

Very little vegetation grew in Alpuk. A few exceptions were [[mikka]], a mint-flavored, black lichen growing near streams, and [[Seal berry|seal berries]], found on the shore of the Lugalpgotak Sea.

==History==
Alpuk was first settled by [[human]]s in {{Yearlink|-1648}} by hunters and explorers from [[Sossal]], who were ambushed by a tirichik and then lost. They eventually found their way to the Lugalpgotak Sea and settled around its shores.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Ahtitlak]] : This small village had a strange bond with [[remorhaz]], having learned even how to ride them.
; [[Imajuvisik]] : A small village of skilled hunters.
; [[Jukum]] : The second-largest settlement in Alpuk.
; [[Keryjek Ridge]] : The eastern border of Alpuk.
; [[Lilinuk]] : The largest settlement on the Great Glacier.
; [[Lugalpgotak Sea]] : The largest body of water on the Great Glacier.
; [[Uppuk River]] : The largest river of the Great Glacier and the northern border of Alpuk.

==Inhabitants==
The primary inhabitants of Alpuk were the Iulutiun tribes, descendents of the first settlers from Sossal.

Arctic dwarves, known as ''Innugaakalikurit'', and frost giants also lived in Alpuk.
