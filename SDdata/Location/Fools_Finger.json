        "mainbody": "The Fools Finger, also seen as Fools Finger,\nIt was situated somewhere on the northern side of the range, some three days by foot from Shining Falls. It was a marker of the unofficial boundary between the Delimbiyr Vale and the wild, monster-plagued Fallen Lands beyond.\nStanding at a lean, it was a massive pillar of stone formed of an unidentified magical stone that radiated cold and had a rosy red glow. The surface was crumbling, possibly because of the souvenir hunters.\nAround 1372 DR, Hendris Teinel of the Scarlet Shield inn in Loudwater promised free meals nightly to any adventurer who could bring him back a piece of the Fools Finger obelisk. Despite the quality of the Scarlet Shields food, many adventurers took him up on this for the sake of a ready source of food, luring many into the dangerous mountain territory and almost as many made it back with one of the stones. These he carved into small shields and sold to merchants leaving for Waterdeep. Apparently they were quite popular there among adventurers and nobles, who used them to make their drinks cold and glow. However, Hendris required them to be at least as big as his own, sizeable, big toe.\nIts unknown for certain what the Fools Finger was or where it came from, but it was commonly believed to be an artifact of the fallen empire of Netheril, perhaps a part of one of its flying cities.\nIn Eleasias of the , adventurers returning from Fools Finger with some stones for Hendris met others returning from a failed effort to find Iirikos Stoneshoulders lost dwarven complex, and still more patrolling the road between Loudwater and Shining Falls. Near Tanglefork Woods, they rescued Blaz Merrymar from being tortured by Skars bandits."
