'''Gravenhollow''' was a mystic library in the [[Underdark]]. It was a serene repository of knowledge set within the chaotic underworld of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Geography==
Gravenhollow's location was to the west of the [[Wormwrithings]]. It was {{SI|120|miles|long=yes}} from [[Gauntlgrym]] and {{SI|360|miles|long=yes}} from [[Mantol-Derith]]. 

==Description==
Gravenhollow was carved out of a titanic [[geode]] imbued with ''[[faerzress]]''.

The library was a peculiar building for many reasons: it was outside the normal time of [[Toril]], everybody inside it understood all languages, it was bigger on the inside, it prevented works of [[magic]] except [[divination]], and nobody could find it without its keeper's will.

A very peculiar trait of Gravenhollow was that it "remembered" all who had walked its halls, as well as those who would visit the library in the future. People exploring the library found apparitions constantly flicking in and out of existence around them. These were the echoes of those who had come or would come to Gravenhollow in search of knowledge.

==History==
Nobody knew who built Gravenhollow, but it was known to have existed since the dawn of [[giant-kin]].
