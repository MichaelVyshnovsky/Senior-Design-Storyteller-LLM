'''Obelner's Well''', or simply '''the Well''',<ref group="note" name="Name" /> was a town in [[Turmish]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/106/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Endless Treasures in Turmish|8}}{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|24}}

==Geography==
It lay on the northwestern coast of Turmish, on the shore of the [[Inner Sea]], some way southeast of [[Alaghôn]] and just north of [[Jathrin's Jump]] and [[Karthoon]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/105/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: More Fabled Treasures of the Land of Turmish|7,9}}

==Description==
Although known to be a beautiful and peaceful place around [[1360 DR]], in older times, Obelner's Well had a bad reputation as a rowdy and lawless haven for criminals. It was a place where pirates docked, smugglers traded contraband, where dodgy outfitters and nimble strumpets serviced them or robbed them, where [[poison]]s could be purchased in the open, and where bodies could be found in the streets. Fortunately, it had all settled down, with any misdeeds now going on behind the scenes and only wild stories being told.

==Rumors & Legends==
Many smugglers either died in the Well or left in a hurry, so people supposed they left a lot of their coin and contraband behind in their stashes. In particular, local stories claimed there were "chests full of [[gold]]" and other treasures in a complex of rooms buried underground, which would be accessed by climbing down the deep well the town was named for. These "rooms beside the well", as they were called, existed, but were concealed behind a permanent [[illusion]] of solid stone partway down the shaft. The rooms were supposedly defended by a monster could turn invisible and use other [[magic]].
