        "mainbody": "'''Uluvin''' was a sleepy crossroads town located in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the [[Savage Frontier]]. It was a sparsely-populated settlement with a few scattered trees and dusty roads. The village was avoided by most travelers and merchants as it offered little in the way of trade beyond a few street peddlers.",
        "Geography": "The village was a cross-roads for several trails, including the [[Iron Road]] and the [[Secomber Trail]], along with trails that led along the [[Unicorn Run]] into the [[High Forest]] and the [[Stronghold of the Nine]].<ref>",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[Dracorage mythal]] affected all the dragons of [[Faer√ªn]], including the [[drow-dragon]] [[Nurvureem]]. She unleashed devastation upon the town and its citizens. Many of the dead residents were raised as [[undead]].\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the village had been repopulated. Around the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, a group of [[hill giant]]s ransacked the town, destroying much of it and tearing down the [[Black Bull's Tail]] inn. The residents of Uluvin left to hide in the nearby forest.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Black Bull's Tail]]: A lone roadhouse that offered middling fare to passers-by.\n* [[Where the Maiden Dances]]: This well-served inn had a conscientious staff and well-cared-for guest rooms.",
        "Inhabitants": "The town was home to a number of farmers and ranchers, among them the teenagers [[Albie Grizlow]] and [[Leshonna Daar]]."
