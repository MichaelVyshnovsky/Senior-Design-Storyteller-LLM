        "mainbody": "The mines of '''Tethyamar''' were once home to one of the greatest [[dwarf|dwarven]] communities in [[north Faerûn]].",
        "Geography": "The mines of Tethyamar were very deep, following the long vertical veins of ore that lay beneath the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]]. Along these descending ore-veins chains of chambers were constructed that made up the housing, forges, tombs and storage areas of the dwarves of Tethyamar. This design resulted in a far more widespread dwarf hold compared to others of its kind.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/Mines of Tethyamar}}",
        "Trade": "Early trade in Tethyamar was primarily with its nearest neighboring realms. These included [[Anauria]], [[Asram]], [[Avaeraether]], [[Cormanthyr]] and [[Hlondath]]. After a few centuries its trading connections had expanded to include [[Cormyr]], [[Hlontar]], [[Myth Drannor]], [[Merrydale]], [[Northkeep]] and [[Teshar]].\n\nWith their forged goods, ore and riches, Tethyamar prospered from its ever-growing trade until the founding of [[Flostren's Hold]] in [[747 DR]]. After Flostren's Hold under the sway of a consortium of wizards, known as the [[Zhentarim]], fierce competition between the two mining nations erupted.",
        "Defenses": "Due to Tethyamar's scattered design, the Kingdom was much harder to defend as enemies could target isolated areas easily. However the dwarves tended to be much more self-reliant and hardy because of the far-flung nature of their home.",
        "Culture": "In Tethyamar culture it was common for dwarves from many different clans to live and work together. Thus comportment and solidarity as a \"Tethyamar dwarf\" tended to be more important than bloodlines or heritage.",
        "History": {
            "Early history": "Located in the northern [[Desertsmouth Mountains]], these wondrous mines and caverns were founded in the {{yearlinkName|-145}} by [[Roryn]], blood of [[Thordbard]], of the [[Iron House]] of fallen [[Oghrann]].  Generations of dwarfs carved out magnificent halls and looted the earth of her valuables, selling them to [[humans]] and [[elves]], sending rafts of riches down the [[River Tesh]] to the [[Moonsea]] and beyond. \n\nDuring this early period, Tethyamar was continually beset by attacks from [[orcs]], [[hobgoblins]] and [[ogres]] as they carved out their kingdom. Despite their resilience Tethyamar briefly fell to orcs from the [[Dragonspine Mountains]] in {{YearlinkName|-88}} before the dwarves reclaimed their halls in {{YearlinkName|-86}}. This close defeat caused the Tethyamar dwarves to sponsor the construction of the fortress-city [[Rulvadar]], to protect against further attacks.",
            "Fall of Tethyamar": "Tethyamar perished however in the {{yearlinkName|1104}}. After more than a decade of resistance, Tethyamar was entirely overwhelmed by legion of [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s, along with their vicious [[barghest]] beasts and [[demon]]ic allies. This invading force was led by the self-proclaimed [[Great Hlundadim]] leader of the old [[goblinoid]] kingdom that [[Hlundadim|bore his name]]. \n\nThe surviving dwarves of the Iron House fled to the dwarven communities of the [[Far Hills]] and [[Storm Horns]] of [[Cormyr]]. Of the royal family, only the king's youngest son, [[Ghellin]] had survived.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1364}} [[Borlin]], blood of Ghellin, mustered a dwarf army known as the [[Mithril Legion]] to reclaim Tethyamar for the Iron House, but the force was defeated.  \n\nGhellin died in exile, reportedly in the [[Far Hills]], of a wasting [[disease]] that resisted all medicinal and [[cleric]]al cures. \n\nNevertheless, dwarves in the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] continued to speak of and work towards the day when “the king shall take his throne again.”\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Zhentarim]] under the command of [[Kara Chermosk]] occupied one of the upper fortresses of Tethyamar and reopened mining operations."
