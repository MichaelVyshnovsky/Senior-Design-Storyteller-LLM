Culmaster was a satellite city of Telflamm, and through that affiliation, Culmaster kept its independence from the nation of Thesk.
Culmaster stood on the road that connected the city of Telflamm in the north and Thassalra in the southeast, east of Cape Dragonsfang and north of the Dragonjaw Mountains.
The pirates of the Sea of Fallen Stars established black markets that dealt in food and shelter during the Tuigan invasion of Yamun Khahans forces in the mid 14 century DR, taking advantage of the damage dealt to Telflamms economy and the shortage of food. This eventually led to Culmaster becoming a pirate safe harbor of sorts by 1359 DR.
Culmaster was annexed by the newly-established royal city-state of Telflamm in the , becoming a part of a single nation ruled by the grand prince.
