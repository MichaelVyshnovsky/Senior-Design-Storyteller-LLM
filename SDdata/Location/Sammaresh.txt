'''Sammaresh''', known as the '''City of Dancing Dolphins''', was a city in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
It stood at the western end of the [[Lapal Way]], and marked the westernmost settlement of Lapaliiya. It was huddled between three low hills that gave out onto a wide sandy beach at the eastern side of the [[Dolphingulf]],

==Population==
Sammaresh was home to 21,912 people in [[1373 DR]].

==Economy==
The people made their living off the sea, by fishing and collecting [[emerald oyster]]s for their rare and valuable [[pearl]]s. As the bay was so shallow, the city's docks stretched almost half a mile (800 meters) out to sea, where the water was sufficiently deep for a ship's draft. [[Aquatic elves]] living among the undersea hills in the bay also often went to the markets of Sammaresh to trade rare treasures of the sea.

==Government & Religion==

The ruler of Sammaresh sat upon the Mantimera Throne (named for the [[mantimera]]).{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|96}} ''Circa'' 1373 DR, the city was ruled by Lady [[Ilnara Mremman]].

The rulers were traditionally advised by the [[Whispering Serpent]], thought to be the [[ghost]] of a [[couatl]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}

The civic deity of Sammaresh was [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden. The people regularly made pilgrimages to the [[Abbey of Tharynd]], just over the border in the [[Tashalar]].
