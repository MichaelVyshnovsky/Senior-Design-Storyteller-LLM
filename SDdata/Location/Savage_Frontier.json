        "mainbody": "The '''Savage Frontier''' was the region of [[northwest Faerûn]] north of the [[Delimbiyr|Delimbiyr River]], excluding the [[Sword Coast North]], the [[High Forest]] and the former nation of [[Luruar]], also known as the [[Silver Marches]]. In contrast to the civilized cities found to the south and west, the Savage Frontier comprised rural farmsteads and rough settlements of miners and loggers.\n\nIt was a temperate land, with rugged landscape that was rich with natural resources.\n\n{{quote|The North has sinfully warm days late in the year, which some call elf summers, that merely bulwark the wary for the inevitable chills of winter to come.|An excerpt from ''[[My Travels]]''}}",
        "Geography": "Generally speaking the Savage Frontier comprised three greater regions: the expansive [[Delimbiyr Vale]] that encompassed its [[Delimbiyr River|namesake river]] along the eastern and southern borders of the High Forest; and the lowlands of the [[Dessarin Valley]], that bordered the western trees of the High Forest.",

That realm was located in the region that was later known as the Delimbiyr Valley.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|705}}, the [[mage]]s of the [[Covenant]] orchestrated the unity of the region's Uthgardt barbarians.

            "Humanoids": "The Savage Frontier was a racially diverse region. However, small towns and villages dominated by humans tend to have few if any non-humans. Most dwarves, elves, and halflings preferred to live in their own settlements, far from human-claimed lands.\n\n;Elves\n:\n:[[Sun elf|Sun]] and [[moon elves]] lived among human settlements. The wood elf tribes of the neighboring [[High Forest]] made little contact with the outside world.\n\n;Halflings\n:\n:[[Strongheart halfling]]s in the Savage Frontier frequently had homesteads hidden off the beaten paths through the valleys. Small populations of [[lightfoot halflings]] could be found in most human-dominated settlements.\n\n;Humans\n:\n:There was no unified human nation in the Savage Frontier. The various towns, city-states, and roaming barbarians traded but also frequently came into conflict. While any human ethnicity could have been encountered in the Savage Frontier, the majority were of [[Illuskan]], [[Tethyrian]], [[Uthgardt]], and [[Chondathan]] descent.{{fact}}\n\n* Chondathan: Slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair ranging from almost blond to almost black and green or brown eyes. Those dwelling in the Savage Frontier were more likely to have blue eyes and a fair complexion. A small number of Chondathans migrated into the region from [[Sembia]] after the {{YearlinkName|913}}.\n\n* Illuskan: Also called Northlanders or [[Northmen]], Illuskans were typically tall, fair-skinned folk with blue or gray eyes. Those living in the Savage Frontier were prone to raven-black hair; indicating significant [[Netherese]] heritage. Illuskans were considered barbarians in spite of founding the cities that would become Luskan, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep.\n\n* Tethyrian: Tethyrians were of mixed ancestry including [[Calishite]], Chondathan, Illuskan, and Low Netherese. They tended to be of medium height and build, with dusky hued skin, brown hair, and blue eyes. Their skintone tended to be more fair the farther north one traveled. Tethyrians emigrated to the [[Dessarin Valley|Dessarin river valley]] after the {{YearlinkName|697}}. \n\n* Uthgardt Barbarians: The Uthgardt were a black-haired and blue-eyed folk descended from a mixture of Northmen, Netherese, and a few savage tribes. They were superstitious with a paranoid dislike of magic. The [[Elk tribe|Elk]], [[Gray Wolf tribe|Gray Wolf]], Griffon, and [[Thunderbeast tribe]] claimed territory in the Savage Frontier."
