        "mainbody": "Ieirithymbul was little-known to the outside world. Even in Leilon, folk knew only that gnomes lived in the mountains and came to trade sometimes. They knew the names of the three peaks, but didn't know who or what \"Felrenden\" referred to.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The valley shared its name with the stream the flowed though it. The [[Felrenden (stream)|Felrenden stream]] eventually disappeared into a sinkhole known as [[Braeder's Pit]]."
        },
        "History": "The gnomes of Ieirithymbul were once quite active, even aggressive, in their patch of the Sword Mountains, but over the years they dwindled. They might have been destroyed or driven out by monsters or rival miners long before the 1360s DR, if not for the coming of Palarandusk.\n\nAfter protecting [[Neverwinter]] for some time, and later becoming gravely wounded, Palarandusk had desired to retire yet still serve as a guardian of some community of hard-working honest people who lived close to the land in an isolated place, yet still close to a bustling city. Weary of ambitious [[human]] mages, Palarandusk took a liking to gnomes, the Forgotten Folk of [[Faer√ªn]], and to Ieirithymbul. With his magic, Palarandusk summoned lone gnome elders out of town to meet with him, then revealed his true nature and asked to be allowed to live in the area in exchange for his protection. Awed and moved, they all accepted the Unseen Protector as he came to be known.\n\nOver the years, Ieirithymbul had suffered attacks by [[orc]]s and the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Forgebar]], but each time they were defeated by Palarandusk. By the 1360s DR, three times the Forgebar dwarves had attacked and three times Palarandusk nearly wiped them out.",
        "Defenses": "The settlement was guarded by the gold dragon Palarandusk, known to the inhabitants as the \"Unseen Protector\". He acted swiftly when any gnome was threatened. He tended to escort them when outside the village.",
        "Inhabitants": "{{fq\n| text   = ...a shameful, sleepy shadow.\n| source = A gnome elder's assessment of Ieirithymbul's decline\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nThe village had a population of perhaps 400 adults, at most.\n\nPalarandusk watched over the Ieirithyn gnomes with care and close attention, monitoring them and making sure they came to no harm with the habits of a worried sheepdog. He generally just drifted from one gnome to the next, checking up on them and updating his overview of their activities and locations in the valley. He particularly liked to listen in on arguments, feasts, and other events where the usually reticent gnomes talked freely about their goals, personal views, or opinions. Generally, he escorted them when they went to the edge of the Felrenden valley for their work and when they left the valley to trade with the outside world. He followed Ieirithyn gnome traders all the way to their trademoots and into Leilon.",
        "Trade": "There were rich [[copper]] and [[iron]] lodes in the area and a significant deposit of [[coal]] by the Pit. The gnomes engaged in prospecting and mining, herding [[sheep]], and gathering edible flowers.\n\nA band of gnome traders from Ieirithymbul visited Leilon about once a month, weather permitting. They also went to the [[High Road]] for trademoots. On rare occasions, wizards aware of Palarandusk came to the village hoping to trade [[spell]]s.",
        "Reputation": "{{fq\n| text   = ...[gnomes] somewhere in the mountains, and it's not wise to make trouble with them.\n| source = An inhabitant of Leilon\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nIeirithymbul was little-known to the outside world. Even in Leilon, folk knew only that gnomes lived in the mountains and came to trade sometimes. They knew the names of the three peaks, but didn't know who or what \"Felrenden\" referred to.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Palarandusk did well at concealing his nature, fooling [[bard]]s and [[sage]]s alike into thinking he was anything but a dragon. The majority thought him to be a local guardian spirit keeping the Ieirithyn from harm. Other theories held he was a gnome [[wizard]] who could project himself out-of-body in an invisible flying ghostly form called a \"send-forth\" while retaining the use of his senses, speech, and ability to cast powerful spells. Ideas that posited a connection with a dragon were dismissed as absurd, sightings by humans were rare, and few scholars could accept or understand Palarandusk strange state of existence. [[Volothamp Geddarm|Volo]] learned of the appearance of a dragon somehow but misinterpreted it as the [[illusion]] of a powerful spellcaster. The renowned dragon expert [[Velsaert]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] was barely aware of his existence. Only a few folk, mostly great wizards such as [[Elminster]], knew the truth of Palarandusk and of course the Forgebars were well aware of the aged gold dragon that slaughtered them. And the gnomes too, obviously.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "Two of the mountain peaks were named for past heroes&mdash;[[Ardabad]] and [[Pheldaer]]. Another famous name among the Ieirithyn was [[Braeder]]&mdash;somehow associated with the sinkhole that swallowed the Felrenden stream."
