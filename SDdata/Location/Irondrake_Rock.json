        "mainbody": "rondrake Rock was a valley with a rocky spire in the Stonelands until the midâ€“14 century DR.\nFormerly, Irondrake Rock was a straight spire visible from afar in the Stonelands. Around it was a grassy meadow with rocky, sheer walls, forming a valley where the ground level rose closest to the spire, giving it a vaguely funnel-like shape. After 1357 DR, the eponymous rock had been reduced to a puddle of melted stone.\nThere was a grotto at the base of the spire. At the top of the spire was a portal to a section south of Stone Stand, within the High Forest.\nOnce, there were tall grass, weeds, and wild flowers in the meadow and birds nested Irondrake Rock. A dragon was said to have once made its lair here, after which the spire was named, according to Mirt.\nIn the , Shandril Shessairs party, led by Mirt, came to Irondrake Rock, where the moneylender sought the hidden portal. While they camped, they were assaulted by the Zhentarim forces of Gathlarue, including her two apprentices, Tespril and Mairara. The rock formation was destroyed during the fight. Delg Ironstar also perished in the valley. Since then, another name for the valley was Delgs Dell."
