The Saiyaddar was the region of Anauroch considered to be the "hunting grounds" of the Bedine people.
The lush grasslands were said to be about  across east to west, and about 50  north to south.
The Saiyaddar was centrally located in the region of Anauroch known as the Sword, south of the Wall of Fallen Djinn mountains and west of the ruins of Orofin.
Alaghs Pass allowed for passageway between the Saiyaddar through the mountains to the Hills of Scent to the north.
In contrast to much of the rest of the desert, the Saiyaddar was lined with natural springs that gave life to an abundance of plant life including tall grasses and many trees.
It was the one location in all of Anauroch that was home to the greatest number of wild gazelles. Other animals found within included hares, onagers, snakes, and a variety of birds.
Knowledge of the Saiyaddar was kept secret by the people of the Bedine, and never claimed by any single tribe.
