'''Chalsembyr''', also known as the '''High Seat''', was a realm located in the lands that later came to be known as the [[Border Kingdoms]], in [[South Faerûn|southern]] [[Faerûn]]. The kingdom existed over a millennia before the [[Era of Upheaval]], during the years of the [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]]. It was perhaps most well known for one of its rulers, the mortal [[Torm]], who ascended to [[deity|godhood]] and later joined [[Tyr]] and [[Ilmater]] to form [[the Triad]].

==History==
Many [[church of Torm|followers of Torm]] sought out the ancient ruins of Chalsembyr in the centuries following its collapse. In fact, some orders of Tormish knights were solely dedicated to this task.

Some Tormish scholars believed that discovering the realm, and learning more about his life as a mortal man, would grant them a place at Loyal Fury's side as a celestial servant. Yet others believed that Torm would always refuse to reveal any information about his life on [[Faerûn]], and believed the search for Chalsembyr to be a divine game and fruitless, yet essential, test of their faith.

One of the most famous [[paladin]]s to undertake was [[Bertold|Bertold the Seeker]], who was granted the [[holy avenger]], ''[[Chalsembyr's Heart]]'' from the [[House of the Hand]] in [[Procampur]], to aid him on his quest.
