The '''Citadel of Ice and Steel''' was the center of all major [[djinni]] activity within the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].

==Geography==
This citadel was actually a gigantic chunk of elemental ice and [[Earth (element)|earth]], smoothed over time by the winds into a nearly perfect oval. The [[Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim|Great Caliph's]] palace was located in the center.

The entire citadel was constantly free-falling, based on the caliph's will. Thus, the only kind of movement possible within the citadel was flight.

Any creature incapable of flight or hovering was constantly buffeted by wind from djinn guards while they were in audience with the Great Caliph.

==Government==
The Great Caliph and his court issued decrees and collected taxes, but the citadel did not produce tangible products.

==Defenses==
The noble djinn had several elite military organizations that they could call upon if the Court of Ice and Steel was threatened, including:
* [[Teeth of the Wind]]
* [[Azure Legion]]
* [[Monsoon Legion]]
* [[Silver Turban Legion]]

==Inhabitants==
Djinn and [[noble djinni|noble djinn]], along with elemental servants of air inhabited the citadel.

==Rumors and Legends==
The djinn claimed to have overthrown [[Imix]], the Prince of Elemental Evil, and claimed the citadel for their own.
