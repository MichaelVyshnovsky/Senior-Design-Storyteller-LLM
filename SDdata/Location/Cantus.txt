'''Cantus''' was an independent city during the time of ancient [[Netheril]].

==Geography==
The city was built on the coast of the [[Narrow Sea]] on the [[Bay of Ascore]], south of [[Ascore]] itself.

==History==
During the early period of Netheril, the city of Cantus attempted to act as the middleman in trade between the [[Netherese]] and the [[goblin]]s of the [[Barren Mountains]] and [[Cold Forest]]. Despite their best efforts, the Netherese were uninterested in the offerings of crude [[leather armor]], [[sparrow]] [[jerky]], reptile-skull [[helmet]]s, totems, and medicine pouches. Feeling slighted by the empty promises, the goblins razed Cantus in {{yearlinkConvert|918|NY}}, leaving it empty until they themselves settled it around {{yearlinkConvert|978|NY}}.

During the great attack on Netheril in {{yearlinkConvert|1048|NY}}, goblins fleeing the battles came to hide in Cantus, coming into conflict with those who already lived there. After both sides exhausted each other, the [[dwarves]] of Ascore and the [[human]]s of [[Orbedal|Sanctuary]] swept down on the survivors and finished them off, leaving Cantus an empty ruin.
