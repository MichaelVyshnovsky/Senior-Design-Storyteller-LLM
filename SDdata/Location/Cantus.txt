Cantus was an independent city during the time of ancient Netheril.
The city was built on the coast of the Narrow Sea on the Bay of Ascore, south of Ascore itself.
During the early period of Netheril, the city of Cantus attempted to act as the middleman in trade between the Netherese and the goblins of the Barren Mountains and Cold Forest. Despite their best efforts, the Netherese were uninterested in the offerings of crude leather armor, sparrow jerky, reptile-skull helmets, totems, and medicine pouches. Feeling slighted by the empty promises, the goblins razed Cantus in , leaving it empty until they themselves settled it around .
During the great attack on Netheril in , goblins fleeing the battles came to hide in Cantus, coming into conflict with those who already lived there. After both sides exhausted each other, the dwarves of Ascore and the humans of Sanctuary swept down on the survivors and finished them off, leaving Cantus an empty ruin.
