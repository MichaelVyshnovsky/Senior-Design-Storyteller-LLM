Fraasz was a duergar city located deep under the Sunrise Mountains in eastern Rashemen. 
The city was originally located in a vault beneath Thay but earthquakes caused by the Spellplague nearly destroyed the old city and the duergar relocated.  Fraasz was relatively isolated and faced no real threats from rival cities.
