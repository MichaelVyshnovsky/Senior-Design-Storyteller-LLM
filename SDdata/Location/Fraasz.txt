'''Fraasz''' was a [[duergar]] city located deep under the [[Sunrise Mountains]] in eastern [[Rashemen]]. 

==History==
The city was originally located in a vault beneath [[Thay]] but earthquakes caused by the [[Spellplague]] nearly destroyed the old city and the duergar relocated.  Fraasz was relatively isolated and faced no real threats from rival cities.
