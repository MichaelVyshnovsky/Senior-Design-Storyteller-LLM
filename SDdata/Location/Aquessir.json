        "mainbody": "'''Aquessir''', also known as '''Shadowtop Borough''', was a floating city of [[Netheril]]. Noted for its inhabitants' friendly disposition towards outsiders, as well as being the original home of the malevolent ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', Aquessir was destroyed in {{Yearlink|-342}} when the city's ''[[mythallar]]'' failed.",
        "Geography": "Aquessir was most commonly found floating near [[Shadowtop Alp]], which overlooked the [[Janick river]].",
        "Description": "Unlike most other Netherese enclaves, the inhabitants of Aquessir were happy to participate in trade with outsiders, particularly [[elves]]. Although Aquessir was home to many arcane researchers, the creation of quasi-magical items was never popular within the enclave.",
        "History": "The city was founded by the [[archwizard]] [[Trebbe]] in {{Yearlink|-2267}}. Trebbe ruled Aquessir until he died in {{Yearlink|-2237}} while finishing his work on the artifact known as the ''Crown of Horns''. The ensuing explosion leveled an entire city block, and the artifact was subsequently lost.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1423}}, the archwizard [[Requiar]] seized power in Aquessir. Having found the ''Crown of Horns'', Requiar used the artifact to stage a bloody coup that left thirty inhabitants dead. By {{Yearlink|-1208}}, the ''Crown'' had driven Requiar insane, and as a result he was overthrown and killed. After his death, the ''Crown of Horns'' vanished yet again.\n\nAn extensive search for the ''Crown of Horns'' was conducted, but the artifact eluded all efforts to find it. The archwizard [[Eliam]], who ruled Aquessir at some point between {{Yearlink|-1205}} and {{Yearlink|-697}}, even hired [[Adventurer|adventuring]] groups to search the [[Border Forest|Eastern Forest]], but to no avail.\n\nThe ''Crown'' finally resurfaced in {{Yearlink|-644}}, when it was found by the ambitious archwizard [[Shadelorn]]. Shadelorn wanted to use the artifact to aid his experiments on creating a stronger ''mythallar''. His research was finally successful in −342 DR. However, unbeknownst to Shadelorn, the ''Crown of Horns'' was eager to avenge its defeat hundreds of years earlier, and had subtly altered Shadelorn's experiments. When the new ''mythallar'' was activated, it absorbed every spell, magical item, and magical effect in a 20-mile radius. Anyone caught within the radius with magically extended lifespans collapsed in piles of ash, and Aquessir itself plummeted into the Janick river.",
        "Notable inhabitants": "* [[Trebbe]], the archwizard who founded Aquessir and created the ''Crown of Horns''.\n* [[Requiar]], a ruthless archwizard who ruled the enclave for hundreds of years.\n* [[Eliam]], ruling archwizard.\n* [[Shadelorn]], an archwizard who unwittingly destroyed the city by involving the ''Crown of Horns'' in his experiments.\n* [[Shenandra]], an archwizard who worked towards nullifying certain [[phaerimm]] spells. Although her experiments were eventually successful, Aquessir was destroyed the very moment she completed her work."
