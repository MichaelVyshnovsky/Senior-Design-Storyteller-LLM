The area was covered in oak trees, and the hilltops were dotted with patches of razorgrass.

Besides them and other insect species, these hills were largely devoid of birds and small woodland creatures, having been wiped out by the forests monstrous inhabitants.
Trolls were the most predominant creature in this region, Many of them and allied creatures lived in caverns deep beneath its peaks.

Local rumors claimed that a drow city once stood beneath these hills, but that the drow destroyed all access to it once the area became overran by trolls.
