        "mainbody": "Kazayama was a mountain located in Kozakura.\nKazayama was situated on the border between Iwari and Fukudo Provinces on the island of Shinkoku.  Once a lofty and snow-capped summit, Kazayama now exhibited a dished-out shape, a peculiar aftermath of a magical confrontation.\nThe slopes of Kazayama bore the remnants of curious glasslike stone and obsidian, a result of the mountains magical destruction. The locals utilized these glassy rocks to craft knives and decorative items, and it was rumored that such artifacts possessed an affinity for enchantment, boasting arcane magical properties.\nKazayama was also known as Broken-Dish Mountain due to a duel between the wu jens Chu Tei Zao and Goboro the Lame in , which resulted in the mountains peak being ravaged by their magical clash."
