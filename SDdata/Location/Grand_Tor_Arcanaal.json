According to estimates by Eadraani, it was approximately  from the nation of Turmish.\nLike all settlements of Olleth, the central fixture for which the Grand Tor was named was an impressive wizards tower in which the ruler resided.\nThe Grand Tor Arcanall was the seat of power for the Arcanum of Olleth and was where its ruler, the Grand Arcane, reigned from. The latest in this line of rulers, Szyzthus, was never seen outside his tower.\nIn addition to morkoth, various enslaved races could be found around the settlement. The bulk of these were largely merrows, followed by locathahs.\nSometime around , the Arcanum of Olleth was founded along with its Nine Towers.\nOn Flamerule 10, in the , a delegation of morkoth from the Grand Tor Arcanaal met with Iakhovas to receive an offered exchange of slaves in return for the Arcanum of Olleths aid. While their arrangement called for only thirty triton slaves, Iakhovas delivered unto them thirty-four as a gesture of good will."
