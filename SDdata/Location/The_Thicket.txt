The Thicket was a grove lying somewhere deep in the High Forest. It was the lair of followers of Malar, many of them lycanthropes, known as "the children of the Thicket".
In the autumn of , the children of the Thicket attacked the city of Loudwater after a blood-red moon appeared in the sky. For three bloody nights, they raided the city and homesteads, forced people out of their houses, and engaged in frenzied hunting and slaughter, before finally slaying the then Green Regent, Galaer Grasswave. After that, they melted back into the woods.
