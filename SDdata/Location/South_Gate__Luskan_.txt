The South Gate of the city of Luskan was the means of entry to the city from the southern bank.
Flanked by two formidable towers known as the Twin Teeth, the towers were two of more than a dozen along the southern wall, and, around 1370 DR, it was customary to decorate them with body parts of those killed or executed by the Luskan militia. The towers were lit by torches at night to keep the body parts illuminated as a warning.
