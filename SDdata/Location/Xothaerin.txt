'''Xothaerin''' was one of the eight subkingdoms of the [[dwarven]] realm of [[Shanatar]].

==Geography==
The former kingdom was found underneath the surface realm of [[Amn]]. It lay inside of two massive caverns connected by a network of tunnels, with the northern half of the kingdom under the [[Cloud Peaks]] and the southern half below the [[Small Teeth Mountains]]. The southern parts were located under the volcanoes [[Kossuth's Eyes]] and were filled with lava tubes and veins of magma, deep within which a gate to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] existed.

==Inhabitants==
The ruling [[shield dwarves]] belonged to [[Clan Azerkyn]], which had some [[azer]] blood. The other major clans of the kingdom were [[Clan Arjotun]] and [[Clan Blackbanner]]. The realm was famous for being the home of some of the greatest giant slayers in history. The northern part of Xothaerin was also famous for its scholars, who were considered to be some of the greatest minds in Shanatar. Due to their affinity of fire and heat, Clan Azerkyn lived in the southern part of the kingdom.

As of {{Yearlink|1372}}, the northern part of the ruined kingdom was home to several tribes of [[fomorian]]s while the southern caverns were home to an aggresive tribe of [[tlincalli]] from [[Maztica]]. The tlincalli tribe founded a realm called [[Oaxaptupa]] within the caverns and tunnels of southern Xothaerin. Also found throughout the vast network of caves and tunnels were small communities of [[giant]]s and [[troll]]s. [[Fire elemental]]s and [[salamander]]s were known to inhabit the southern area and there were reports that an [[efreeti]] made its home there as well.

==Economy==
The [[Elementalist|pyromancers]] of Clan Azerkyn crafted fine magical armor and weapons.

==History==
After the fall of Shanatar, it was rumoured that the dwarves of Clan Azerkyn emigrated to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

==Religion==
The dwarves of Xothaerin worshiped [[Sharindlar]] as its patron deity.
