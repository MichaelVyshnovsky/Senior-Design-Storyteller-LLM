        "mainbody": "he Caravan Quarter of Daggerford was the area in town that catered to merchants, traders, and other travelers that passed by during their journeys along the Trade Way.\nThe quarter was located on the west side of town, north of the market. The closest entrance from outside the towns walls was the Caravan Gate.\nWith the large number of traders that passed through and many guildhalls, the Caravan Quarter was the site for commerce in Daggerford.\nBusinesses\n* Decorated Man The illusionist Ballick was the proprietor of this tailors shop.\n* Derfs Skin Art While the artists within this shop primarily offered tattoos to their clientele, they also experimented in piercings and decorative scarring.\n* Millers Dry Goods This shop was run by the incomparable Bess Miller, who owned three successful mills in the surrounding lands.\n* Olegs Weaponforge While he was quite skilled at his craft, the half-orc Oleg was often the subject of the towns scorn and ridicule.\n* Cromachs Smithy While it was later relocated to the Money Quarter, the smithy was originally founded by Cromach within the Caravan Quarter.\n* Oryvs Cloth Emporium The cunning merchant Oryv offered a wide variety of fabrics, both locally and foreign-made.\n* Yarth Stowage This massive warehouse was considered to be among the most secure locations within which someone could store their goods.\nHalls\n* Fences Syndicate While it was loosely considered a true guild, this group of neer-do-wells facilitated Daggerfords black market.\n* Leatherworkers Conglomerate All the leather workers from the area surrounding Daggerford could gather here alongside their fellow craftsmen.\n* Physicians Order The guildhall of the towns apothecaries and healers functioned as a hospital of sorts.\n* Scribes Friendship Daggerfordian scribes gathered within this building when they were not busy gathering works from Kryptgarden Scrolls.\n* Sorcellers Encapsulate This organization regulated and guided the arcane spellcasters that took up residence in town.\n* Tailors Federation Although the tailors guild was rather poor, its guildmaster was skilled enough to attract the business of the affluent and noble alike.\n* Tanners Council Before a dedicated tannery was built outside of town, the tanners of Daggerford used their guildhall to ply their craft.\n* Taverners Confederation All of the towns barkeeps, tavern servers, and owners were members of this guild.\n* Thinkers Fraternity This organization was a collective of scholars and theorists that gathered together to share new ideas with one another.\nInns and Taverns\n* Lady Luck Tavern While it was formerly situated in the Money Quarter, the tavern was relocated to much larger building that once housed the Daggerford Inn.\n* Daggerford Inn This dirty inn offered little else beyond fairly restful accommodations.\nPlaces of Worship\n* Fairfortune Hall Although it served Daggerford for many years, this Tymoran shrine never attracted enough followers to justify the creation of an actual temple building.\nWhile many of the folks staying in the Caravan Quarter were merely staying in town for a short time, it did house a significant portion of Daggerfords residents. Its always served as the home for halflings and dwarves, particularly those with no relation to the towns more affluent families.\n14 Century\n* Bohle, the knowledgeable and stealthy half-elf thief\n* Emser, the enigmatic gnome of whom little was actually known\n* Garrick, a Tymoran priest that separated from the Daggerfordian branch\n* Ines, who was rather loud and bumbling for someone with an illicit background\n* Quarenghi, the leader of a cult devoted to the overgod Ao\n* Youatt, a local veterinary healer"
