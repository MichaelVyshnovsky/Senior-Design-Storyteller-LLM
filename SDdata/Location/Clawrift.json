        "mainbody": "The Clawrift was a deep, dark chasm in the center of the drow city of Menzoberranzan.\nThe Clawrift was a deep, claw-shaped rift in the center of the city.\nHouse Oblodras kobold slaves were housed in pens and extensive tunnels and walkways that extended deep into the Clawrift.\nThe Clawrift was surrounded by the district of Duthcloim.\nUntil 1358 DR, House Oblodras compound clung to a cliff face between the two \"fingers\" of the Clawrift. Its compound was small but protected on three sides by the Clawrift and guarded by soldiers on the other side. After the houses fall in 1358 DR, only ruins of the compound remained.\nThe chasm was home to the mercenary band Bregan Daerthes secret headquarters in Menzoberranzan.\nThe Cathlyre was an exotic bird aviary situated against the stalactites of the Clawrifts eastern perimeter.\nThe depths of the Clawrift and its central location meant that it was a ready location for many dangerous pastimes in the city. The dangerous game khaless, which involved levitating over the Clawrift for as long as possible, was played over the Clawrift. Drow priestesses also liked to dangle their lovers over the ledge of the Clawrift while making love to them.\nIn the 15th century DR, the secret headquarters of Bregan Daerthe was attacked by spellscarred illithids. The invading force was ultimately repelled.\nIn 1358 DR, House Baenre and its demonic allies, with the support of Lolth, swept House Oblodra. However, in the meantime, Lolth made a deal with the balor Errtu, who sent demons to aid House Baenre, led by Yvonnel Baenre, and attack House Oblodra. Yvonnel summoned a tentacle from the Abyss to sweep the entire house into the Clawrift. Kyorl remained alive, but Yvonnel banished her into the Abyss to be tortured for eternity by Errtu.\nDuring his time in Menzoberranzan, Artemis Entreri was dangled over the edge of the Clawrift by Berellip Xorlarrin while she made love to him.\nThe tunnels and caverns of the Clawrift were home to thousands, if not more, kobolds, most of which were slaves of House Oblodra. Although the Oblodrans claimed to have only 600 kobolds, the Clawrift was capable of holding ten of thousands more.\nBregan Daerthe had a secret headquarters and safe house in the Clawrift.\nAfter the fall of House Oblodra, undead Oblodran priestesses were believed to haunt the Clawrift as witchlins, stalking the kobolds that lived in the Clawrift."
