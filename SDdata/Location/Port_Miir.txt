'''Port Miir''' was a city located in southeastern [[Anauroch]].

==Description==
The city was a relatively lawless trading hub that served to connect Anauroch and the lands west to those lands east of the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]].

==Geography==
Port Miir was on the southeast shore of [[Lake Miir]] at the foot of the western Desertsmouth Mountains. It was located at the western end of [[Berothir's Trail]].

==Government==
A loosely aligned cabal of [[wizard]]s were nominally in charge of law and order in the city, but it was all they could do to curb the worst excesses of the thieves living there.

==Trade==
Berothir's Trail stretched from Port Miir to [[Shadowdale]], which was the main artery of trade in and out of the city. Port Miir was known for its moneylenders and the numerous caravans entering and leaving town.
