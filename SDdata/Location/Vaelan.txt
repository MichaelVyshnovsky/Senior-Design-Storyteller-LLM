'''Vaelan''' was a huge city in [[Durpar]] in southeast [[Faer√ªn]]. As of {{yearlink|1479}}, it was the last remaining glory of [[Durpar]], and its capital.

==Notable Locations==
The Tower District, Vaelan's central district, held over 100 slender white-plastered towers full of balconies, galleries and promenades; they were home to the city's nobility. It lasted at least until {{yearlink|1479}}.{{cite book/Darkvision|60|7}} Another upscale district was the [[Vaelan/West Gardens|West Gardens]] district, close to the [[Kazrim's Plunge]];{{cite book/Darkvision|62-63|7}} the inhabitants of West Garden paid into a common fund for magical protection.{{cite book/Darkvision|61|7}} The [[Vaelan/Vartown district|Vartown District]], while also upscale, was run-down, with a number of flats for renting. It also hosted some plays satirizing the chakas.{{cite book/Darkvision|96|10}}

There were many piers in Vaelan's harbor, with nine piers reserved for merchant traffic in 1374 DR. Of those, the [[Dolphin Pier]] did not belong singularly to any of the families.{{cite book/Darkvision|60|7}}

==History==
The original city was destroyed in the 10th century [[DR]]. The remains of the original Vaelan were known as [[Old Vaelan]] and were inhabited by [[lycanthropes]] and [[undead]].{{cite book/Shining South|123}}

Vaelantar was reclaimed by the Durpari in {{yearlink|1102}};{{cite book/Shining South|118}} The Council of Durpar decided to move the capital from [[Heldapan]] to Vaelan in {{yearlink|1371}}.{{cite book/Shining South|119}}

==Authorities==
By {{yearlink|1371}}, Vaelan held the seats of the eleven families in [[Durpar]]'s high council, being the capital. A local council ruled the city proper. However, by {{yearlink|1479}}, Vaelan's authority rested almost entirely in the [[Datharathi]] family.

==Inhabitants==
By {{yearlink|1479}}, goblins were part of the armies and population of Vaelan. Most Durpari resented this.
