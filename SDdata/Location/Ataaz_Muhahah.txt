Ataaz Muhaha, meaning Laughing Gorge in the Chultan language, was a canyon on the River Olung in Chult.
The canyon was a deep chasm over 100 feet (30.5 meters) in depth. At one point, it was crossed by the Monkey Bridge.
The gorge was inhabited by troops of monkeys that hooted, howled and shrieked incessantly.
