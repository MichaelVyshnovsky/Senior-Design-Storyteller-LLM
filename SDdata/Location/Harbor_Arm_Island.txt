'''Harbor Arm Island''' was an "island" that sat in the mouth of the [[River Mirar]] in the city of [[Luskan]].

==Description==
The island was a tall, rocky spire that served to shelter [[Whitesails Harbor]] against waves and storms from the south. It was barren and uninhabited.

==Geography==
Harbor Arm Island was the northernmost of the five islands that sat in the mouth of the River Mirar (the others being [[Blood Island]], [[Closeguard Island]], [[Cutlass Island]], and [[Fang Island]]).

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, the island was seized by [[Deudermont]] and his allies as part of their battle to drive [[Arklem Greeth]] and the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] out of the city.
