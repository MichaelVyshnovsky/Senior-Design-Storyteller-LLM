        "Description": "Winding tunnels and caves were scattered throughout the pit.",
        "Activities": "The Pit of a Thousand Voices was reserved for [[holy slayer]]s who committed vile crimes against the doctrines of their order. Holy slayers brought here were lowered into the pit, where a sound like a group of baying hounds and wailing moans greeted them.",
        "Inhabitants": "A [[gibbering mouther]] called [[Al-Bakbuk]] lived within the pit. It consumed anything lowered into the darkness, adding to its ghastly bulk.\n\nA pack of [[ghoul]]s serving [[Akim al-Kalaas]] also lived within the pit, feeding on any scraps of flesh left by the gibbering mouther. The ghouls worshiped a [[living idol]] housed within one of the larger caverns."
