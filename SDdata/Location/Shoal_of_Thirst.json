            "Geographical Features": "Rather than being covered in [[sand]] like the rest of the desert, the great basin was entirely flat and covered in salt. This caused heat from the sun to reflect upward, causing the little rain it received to vaporize and no plant life to grow.\n\nIt was a precarious location to travel across, even for the local [[Bedine]] people and their [[camel]]s, who were quite accustomed to life in the desert."
        },
        "History": "Long before the [[Era of Upheaval]], during the age of ancient [[Netheril]], the area in which the Shoal was situated was once a body of water known as the [[Hidden Lake]].\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1360}}, the witch [[Ruha]], her brother-in-law [[Kadumi]], and the [[Harper]] agent named [[Lander]] famously crossed the Shoal of Thirst twice. They crossed from the [[Well of the Chasm]] in the east to the [[Sister of Rains]] in the west, then crossed the salt flats again to [[Elah'zad]] in the north.\n\nWhen the [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Thultanthar]] returned to north [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the basin was transformed once again. Three Princes of Shade performed a ritual that created a huge storm above the Shoal, and a lake of chilled water formed within the Shoal; the [[Shadow Sea]] remained in the place of the great salt flats."
