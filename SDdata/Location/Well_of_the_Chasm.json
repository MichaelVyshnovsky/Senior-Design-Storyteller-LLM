        "mainbody": "The Well of the Chasm was a deep canyon set within the Scimitar Spires in the desert of Anauroch. Due to the natural source of fresh water found within its depths, it was also an oasis that provided succor to the Bedine people that dwelled in the harsh desert lands.\nThe Well of the Chasm was a vast subterranean valley set over  beneath the sands of the Anauroch. It was accessible by a long, winding canyon that was accessible by a narrow passageway set within the Scimitar Spires. While the entrance to the the Chasm was a mere  in width, the canyon itself varied anywhere from  to  in width.\nThe Chasm itself was set into the bedrock beneath the desert, with a floor of sand that was covered with boulders. A single stream of fresh, opaque water passed beneath a pit set into the sands of the Chasm.\nThe Well of the Chasm was easily defensible due to its form and structure.\nWhen the Zhentarim attempted to coerce and enslave the tribes of the Bedine in the , they met significant resistance when finally reached the Well of the Chasm. Their efforts were halted by the local Razhadi, who were aided in the defense of their home by the neighboring Mahwa tribe. This great victory for the Bedine came to be known as the Battle of the Chasm.\n* Mouth of the Abyss, the name given to the tapered, mountainside entrance of the canyon.\nThe oasis was the home of the Razhadi tribe of the Bedine."
