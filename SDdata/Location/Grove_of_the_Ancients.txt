The '''Grove of the Ancients''' was a hidden grove in the [[Wealdath]] that was considered sacred by the [[elves]] of [[Suldanessellar]].

==Geographic Features==
The Grove of the Ancients was so named for its dominant feature: several massive stones, formed in the shape of [[humanoid]] heads. The stone heads were inhabited by [[spirit#Nature Spirits|forest spirits]], who illuminated their eyes with a blue radiance.

When someone spoke with one of the spirits they responded with a booming voice and the stone heads' eyes caught fire.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Queen [[Ellesime]] directed [[Abdel Adrian]] to travel to the grove so he could learn more about his fate in the greater [[Bhaalspawn crisis]] that afflicted [[Tethyr]]. After he spoke with one of the forest spirits he was confronted by his fellow [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Illasera]]. Their groups fought in a short battle and Abdel slew his divine half-sibling.
