        "mainbody": "hymanthiin, also called the Hidden City of Hope, was a city on the High Moor in the Western Heartlands. It was a reconstruction of the ancient Miyeritari city of Faertelmiir, the Library City of Miyeritar. Rhymanthiin served as a center for magic, knowledge, lore, and the unity of different races.\nThe great boulevards and high walls of Rhymanthiin were clean and straight. They were constructed of massive, pitch-black stone blocks.\nRhymanthiin was located on the High Moor on the exact spot that the Miyeritari city of Faertelmiir once occupied. The High Moor was partly cleansed by this city-raising, and the toxins were redirected into the body of the lich Priamon \"Frostrune\" Rakesk, thus also starting the rejuvenation of the High Moor.\nThe city only accepted those who were \"worthy of her,\" and those with malice in their hearts \"shall not find their way here.\"\nThe city had high walls and was invisible to most outsiders, appearing instead as an empty plain. Within the city, sharns lived within the walls and streets, and could freely emerge to attack any who threatened the city.\nIt was created on the Feast of the Moon in the , through a High Magic Ritual of Myriad and manipulation of the Killing Storms by Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun, Tsarra Chaadren, and Danthra the Dreamer, all of whose souls were within the body of Tsarra Chaadren, and over ninety wielders of the Art. Among the notable participants in the ritual were the three grand mages and many other sharn\n* The Chosen of Mystra Khelben Arunsun, Elminster Aumar, Laeral Silverhand, Alustriel Silverhand, and Alvaerele Tasundrym, the Silent Chosen.\n* Mentor Wintercloak, one of the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor.\n* Ualair the Silent, Grand Mage of Myth Drannor, keeper of Uvaerens Secrets, and master of the NVaelahr of Myth Drannor.\n* High Mage Orjalun of Silverymoon.\n* The elf wizards Darcassan of Windsong Tower and Shalantha Omerdawn.\n* The human Jhesiyra Kestellharp.\n* The gnome Parthar the Valiant, also called Rhymallos the Hidden Eye, an unsung hero of Myth Drannor who took the form of a mezzoloth to infiltrate the Army of Darkness.\n* The wizard Malchor Harpell.\n* Syndra Wands, granddaughter of Khelben.\n* The Tethyrian wizard Lord Gamalon Idogyr, Count of Spellshire, Sage of the Royal Court of Tethyr, and great-grandson of Khelben.\n* Lord Maskar Wands\n* Phaerl Hawksong\n* Luvon Greencloak\n* The bronze dragon Essioanawrath the Elder.\n* The gold dragon Tlanchass.\n* The dragon called the Argentalon.\n* The tiefling mage Tulrun of the Tent.\n* The Mistmaster and his consort Azure.\n* The wizards and former Zhentarim Sememmon and Ashemmi.\n* Maaril, the Dragonmage of Waterdeep.\n* Nain Keenwhistler.\n* The high-ranking clerics of Oghma Fourth Reader Shaynara Tullastar of Candlekeep, Loremaster Cadathlyn of the House of Many Tomes, and Sandrew the Wise, lorekeeper high and ranking priest of the Font of Knowledge in Waterdeep.\n* Kyriani Agrivar, half-elf mistress of Selûnes Smile.\n* Elsura Dauniir.\n* A number of sharn previously three grand mages of Miyeritar—Tkaron, Hamra, and Alunor—and some 80 other citizens.\nThis was all by the design of the Pentad, the five gods Corellon Larethian, Sehanine Moonbow, Dumathoin, Mystra, and Oghma.\nRhymanthiin was largely untouched by the Spellplague of 1385 DR. As of the late 15 century DR, the Hidden City of Hope still stood, hidden within the Feywild and invisible to any outsiders not welcome in the city. It had grown to be roughly the size of Waterdeep, and hosted the largest population of \"redeemed\" drow in Faerûn alongside good folk of all races."
