'''Wyrm's Hamlet''' was a settlement located in the south of the [[Horse Prairie]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
Wyrm's Hamlet laid on the southern end of the [[Snake Road]] that connected the hamlet with the city of [[Elversult]] to the northwest. The town was built on the northern shores of the [[Lake of the Snake]], east of the [[Giant's Run Mountains]]. Just to the east from the town, downstream along the [[River Reddan]] that flowed out of the Lake of the Snake, stood the closest notable settlement to Wyrm's Hamlet, known as [[Smuggler's Bank]].
