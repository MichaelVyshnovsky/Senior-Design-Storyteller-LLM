        "mainbody": "The Village of the Mad Druid referred to a peculiar settlement in the Shadowfell where the residents pretended to be undead.\nIt was a thriving and fully populated settlement despite being located amidst the dangers of the Shadowfell. Unwary travelers were attacked and killed by the villages insnane protector, who was the only thing standing between the inhabitants and inevitable doom.\nThe village lay along the Shadowfell Road between Evernight and Thay.\nShadowborn humanoids populated the village, all of whom pretend to limp and shamble around town while poorly disguised as undead, sometimes comically so. They wore ripped clothing, smeared their faces with makeup and dirt, and occasionally tied bones or raw meat to themselves with twine. When not speaking with each other, they would moan and groan aloud.\nIf asked about their bizarre behavior, they refused to say more than simply that it was necessary to appease their \"protector\", whom they would not name and who did not want them to talk about it.\n* Shalanka, the villages mad protector who dwelt along the Shadowfell Road outside of town."
