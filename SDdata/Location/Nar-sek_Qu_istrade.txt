'''Nar-sek Qu'istrade''' was a neutral meeting ground for the tribes of [[Narfell]] and a defensive location in times of foreign invasions, near where the [[Long Road (Northeast Faerûn)|Long Road]] passed into the [[Giantspire Mountains]].

==Geography==
The site lay on a northeastern spur of the Giantspire Mountains, in western Narfell, south from the [[Giantspire Gap]] and the Long Road. 


==Description==
Nar-sek Qu'istrade, also called '''Horseshoe Canyon''', was a great circular canyon of five square miles (12 square kilometers) of rolling [[grass]], encapsulated by high cliff walls. The single entrance to the canyon was a crack wide enough for two riders abreast, making any approach into the canyon near impossible for anyone the Narfell sought to prevent.

The rear walls of the canyon had shallow caves cut into them to make even more room, although the hardy Nars would sleep out under the open sky and instead put their highly valued horses in the caves. Protected from even the harshest of weather the land could throw at it, Nar-sek Qu'istrade was often used by various Nar tribes as they migrated by. On the worst winter days, it was normal to see several tribes sheltering together. Even those who, on the open grassland, would be fierce rivals, would stay their hands and mingle inside this canyon where an unbroken truce had existed since time immemorial.

Should a tribe be attacked by foreign invaders crossing the Giantspire Mountains, they would attempt to make their way to Nar-sek Qu'istrade where they would light beacons that always sat pre-prepared. These beacons would signal to all Narfell that enemies were near and all tribes, regardless of other loyalties, would rush to defend and unite against the intruders.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the [[Zhengyi|Witch-King of Vaasa]] began amassing his armies along the western banks of [[Icelace Lake]]. In response, the Nar tribes gathered in Nar-sek Qu'istrade and from there ranged up the southern and eastern lakeshores, patrolling and scouting out for any sign of hostile crossing.
