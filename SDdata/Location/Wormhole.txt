The '''Wormhole''' was a secret location within the [[City of Brass]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
By an incredible stroke of luck, or genius, the [[salamander]] population of the City of Brass was able to keep the location of this hideout a secret from the [[efreet]] for ages.

The Wormhole was used as a meeting place by salamanders where they helped escaped slaves and planned to move stolen weapons outside of the city to their salamander kin to help in their constant fight with the efreet.
