}}'''Yeshelmaar''' was a major settlement in the [[Forest of Lethyr]] and the center of civilization in the [[Great Dale]]. It was difficult to distinguish between the town's stonework and the surrounding hillside's volcanic stone. Plantings of trees and green ivy were featured throughout, while elevated walkways and stairways connected the town's spires.
==Inhabitants==

==Structure==
Yeshelmaar was carved into a rocky tor, with a pristine lake of cold water at the foot of the hill.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|106|12}} As of {{yearlink|1373}}, it was an elaborate construction, hard to tell where the natural stone ended and the construction began. Greenery was planted throughout the construction. The main gates were made of iron an stone, leading into a wide square-cut tunnel flagged with granite. Many small side tunnels opened into dark chambers, but the main passage was lit with lamps, with the light of day leaking in. Some of the rooms opened into rooftop gardens, but sheer plunges off the side of Yeshelmaar were common.

The flags of the [[Circle of Leth]] and the [[Nentyarch]] were flown on top of the fortress as of {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|107|12}} Also, there was a [[phoenix]] nest atop the fortress.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|128|13}}

===The Spring Court===
The Spring Court was held in a wide sublevel, with thin shafts leading to the surface; beams of morning light fell into the grotto from there. A pool of crystal water lay at the center of the chamber; with a great throne of pale stone in the middle; the [[Nentyarch]] sat there during meetings. The walls of the chamber had subtle designs of vines, leaves, and such; they appeared to move. The high druids had seats around the pool.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|118-119|13}}

===Skymeadow===
Skymeadow was a garden high on the side of Yeshelmaar. It had a patio of reddish flagstones, surrounded by low benches, themselves surrounded by leafy fruit trees. Outside that circumference, there were flowering mints and more fruit trees. Beyond, there was a landscaped pool with a cool grotto carved into the stone of the fortress. Within the grotto itself, there was a bronze statue of Corellon Larethian.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|131-132|14}}

==History==
The [[Elf|elves]] of [[Lethyr]] established Yeshelmaar in response to raids by the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] and retreated there when forced to abandon the northern [[Riildath]] in {{Yearlink|-1020}}. A feat of elven engineering, it began as a stronghold carved into a tor overlooking a coldwater lake and grew upward, downward, and inward.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|109-110|12}}

In {{Yearlink|1371}}, the [[Nentyarch]], driven from [[Dun-Tharos]] by the [[Rotting Man]], took refuge in Yeshelmaar and established it as the seat-in-exile of the [[Circle of Leth]] and their [[Nentyar hunter]]s.

By {{Yearlink|1479}}, Yeshelmaar was the only major outpost of civilization in the Great Dale, as trade activity along the [[Great Road]] had collapsed.
