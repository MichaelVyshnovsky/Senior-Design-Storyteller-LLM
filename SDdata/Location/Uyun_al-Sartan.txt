}}'''Uyun al-Sartan''', also known as the '''Eyes of the Crab''', was an island in [[Jazayir al-Sartan]].

==Geography==
The islands of Uyun al-Sartan surrounded the bay of [[Batihat al-Saji]].

==Activities==
The island served as a hatchery for [[giant crab]]s infesting the lagoon. Landing on the island was a dangerous venture because the crabs were voracious carnivores that would swarm anything setting foot on the island.
