Uyun al-Sartan, also known as the Eyes of the Crab, was an island in Jazayir al-Sartan.
The islands of Uyun al-Sartan surrounded the bay of Batihat al-Saji.
The island served as a hatchery for giant crabs infesting the lagoon. Landing on the island was a dangerous venture because the crabs were voracious carnivores that would swarm anything setting foot on the island.
