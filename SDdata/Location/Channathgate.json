        "mainbody": "'''Channathgate''' was a community in the [[Channath Vale]] of the [[Shaar]].",
        "Geography": "The settlement sat near the [[River Channath]] at the eastern end of the Channath Vale between the [[Channathwood]] to the north and the [[Swagdar]] and the [[Forest of Amtar]] to the south. It lay along [[Trader's Way]] between [[Rethmar]] to the west and the [[Landrise]] and [[Three Swords]] to the east.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 48: The Road to Khôltar, Part 1}}",
        "Trade": "Channathgate reaped the benefits of caravan trade through the Channath Vale. In addition, farmers on the outskirts of the settlement also traded with the [[ghostwise halfling]]s of the Channathwood.",
        "Relationships": "The community had a tentative relationship with the [[halfling]]s of the Channathwood, who did not permit them to travel into their forest except to forage for [[herbs]] and [[berries]] on the fringes.",
        "History": "After the Shaar was conquered by the [[Shoon Imperium]] in the {{YearlinkName|300}}, several Shaaran towns rebelled in the {{YearlinkName|435}}, including Channathgate. This led to a brutal reprisal known as the [[Seven Burnings]] campaign: between {{Yearlink|438}} and {{Yearlink|440}}, Shoon armies rampaged through the communities of the Shaar, including Channathgate, and killed or displaced many locals. Even so, the Shaar had gained independence from Shoon rule by the end of the {{YearlinkName|451}}.\n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the area around Channathgate faced a number of threats out of the nearby Forest of Amtar. This included a number of bandit groups&mdash;such as those led by the [[ogre mage]] [[Tandith Tornears]] or the [[half-fiend]] [[Tanushk Versix]]&mdash;as well as [[gnoll]]s operating out of the [[Gate of Iron Fangs]]{{Cite web/Steal This Hook/A Place to Call Home}}"
