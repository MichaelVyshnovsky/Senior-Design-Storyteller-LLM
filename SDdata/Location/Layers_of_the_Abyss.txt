The term '''layer of the Abyss''' referred to each of the ever-changing miniature worlds in the chaotic tangle that constituted the [[Abyss]].

The total number of Abyssal layers was not fixed at any given time, due to the ever-expanding and corrupting nature of the plane. If left unchecked, the continued presence of [[demon]]s in a world in the [[Prime Material plane]] could erode the barriers between that place and the Abyss, leading to the opening of one or more [[portal]]s and an ever-growing demonic presence. Over time, the Abyssal influence and the long-term presence of one or more [[demon lord]]s could permanently corrupt that entire world, effectively converting it into a new layer.

Nevertheless, numerous attempts were made to catalog the layers. Some sources placed the number of layers at 666, while the [[Fraternity of Order]] claimed to have cataloged at least 679 layers, of which 141 were considered habitable. Most were accessible via portals from [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 1: Plain of Infinite Portals|Pazunia]], or from the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 4: The Grand Abyss|Grand Abyss]], but many had been sealed away and were no longer accessible. Those were called the "Lost Planes of the Abyss".

==Cosmography==
The Fraternity of Order numbered the layers by order of discovery. For that reason, there was not necessarily a spatial relation between layers of consecutive numbers, or a correlation with depth. Rather, a layer was considered "deep" if it lacked a direct connection with the first layer.

Each Abyssal layer was unique. The only common feature of all layers was their harsh and inhospitable environment, as well as the apparent corroded and decaying state of every feature, a reflection of the entropic nature of the entire plane. Some layers were controlled by one or more [[demon lord]]s, whose natures ended up defining the character of the layer under their domain. [[Deity|Deities]] who claimed [[divine realm]]s in the Abyss and even demon lords were extremely territorial and intolerant of intruders, always making an effort to extend their dominion over their entire layers. For that reason, each layer typically contained a single realm, so it was equivalent to either refer to a particular layer or to the realm therein.

===Layers 1â€“100===
====Layer 1: Plain of Infinite Portals====
{{Main|Pazunia}}
[[File:Pazunia-3e.jpg|thumb|250px|''The landscape of Pazunia.'']]
Also known as '''Pazunia''', the '''Palace of 1,001 Closets''', the '''Plain of a Thousand Portals''', and the '''Plain of Yawning Pits''', this layer was a barren wasteland of scorching winds under a relentless red sun. The surface was marked by massive dark pits: portals that plunged into many, but not all, of the deeper layers. The surface of the layer, cut through by the river [[Styx]], connected to both [[Pandemonium]] and [[Hades]] in different edges. Its air space was ruled by the [[obyrith]] [[Pazuzu]], Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms. The landscape was marked with scattered iron fortresses claimed as fiefs by other [[demon lord]]s, such as [[Aldinach]], the Lady of Change, and [[Baltazo]], a retired general of the [[Blood War]], who claimed smaller domains on the layer as their own.

The layer was home to countless [[mane]] petitioners, who were constantly hunted for food or thrust down the pits into the deeper layers, as well as gangs of [[molydeus|molydei]] that hunted [[demon]] stragglers. There were also a large number of mortal and [[outsider]] merchants and visitors throughout the layer, attracted by the opportunities offered by the layer's countless portals. The largest of these pits was known as the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 4: The Grand Abyss|Grand Abyss]], which was considered a layer in its own right. Some pits worked as two-way portals, but others were only one-way.

====Layer 2: Driller's Hives====
Realm of [[Tharzax]],{{Cite dungeon/123/Salvage Operation|26}} It was inhabited by [[ekolid]]s and hives of enormous insects at constant war with each other. The environment slowly turned visitors into insect creatures, although [[paladin]]s were immune to this effect.

====Layer 3: The Forgotten Land====
{{Main|Forgotten Land (Abyss)}}
This layer drained the memories and identities of any mortal or [[demon]] that set foot on it. It was the realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Zzyczesiya]],, the Ungrasped. The layer itself was said to have originated by a failed attempt to subvert the flow of the river [[Styx]].

The layer was dotted with ancient abandoned cities. It was inhabited by creatures that fed on the life force of victims or on the loose thoughts that permeated the environment, such as [[reason stealer]]s and [[vasuthant]]s. It was also rumored to contain fragments of the ''[[Rod of Seven Parts]]'' or the ''[[Barbatos device]]''; for this reason, [[demon lord]]s such as [[Graz'zt]] and [[Demogorgon]] often sent exploration parties to the layer, led by [[golem]]s.

====Layer 4: The Grand Abyss====
{{Main|Blood Rift}}
[[File:Grand_abyss-3e.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Exploring the Grand Abyss.'']]
Also known as the '''Blood Rift''', The layer itself had no ruler.

In the [[World Axis cosmology]], the tower of [[Khin-Oin]] was located in the Blood Rift. It was an enormous {{SIAdj|21|mi|k|adj=tall}} tower that rose {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} above the city of [[Morglon-Daar]] on Pazunia and whose majority was anchored to the walls of the layer. It was the realm of [[Phraxas]].

The origin of the layer was a subject of debate among sages: some sources claimed that the layer originated from the explorations of the [[obyrith]]s, who cooperated in exploring and perusing the various portals along the walls of the cliff. Others, however, claimed that the rift originated as a catastrophic effect of the battle between [[Demogorgon]] and [[Obox-ob]], and appeared as a scar that permeated the very fabric of the plane. In any case, maps to the various portals along the crevasse were nearly all inaccurate, due to the ever-changing nature of the plane.

The realm contained ancient constructions along its depths, such as towers and bridges, that connected portals that were located in similar heights. These bridges were guarded by a wandering [[klurichir]]. The walls of the canyon were bathed by the toxic [[Blood River]], whose exact course was also ever-changing, and the red mist that rose from the river favored the growth of moss and lichen along the walls. The rift was a constant battleground of demons, and plummeting corpses were not an uncommon sight.

====Layer 5: Wormblood====
Lordship over this layer was contested. The environment infected all visitors with a disease similar to [[mummy rot]] that destroyed their bodies from the inside out within a year. The disease bypassed known magical protection.

====Layer 6: Realm of a Million Eyes====
{{Main|Realm of a Million Eyes}}
Realm of the [[Great Mother]], chief [[goddess]] of the [[beholder]] pantheon. It was inhabited by every kind of beholder and beholderkin, who constantly fought each other.

The layer was a twisting network of tunnels filled with eyes protruding from the walls. The eyes belonged to the Great Mother herself.

====Layer 7: The Phantom Plane====
Also known as '''Kearackinin'''. All portals leading to this layer were sealed. It was the realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Sess'innek]], the Emperor Lizard, worshiped by [[lizardfolk]]. The layer was inhabited by [[lizard king]]s. It was discovered by [[Mordenkainen]].

====Layer 8: The Skin-Shedder====
Realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Volisupula]], the Flensed Marquesse. The layer corrupted the souls of all visitors in a matter of days. The only creatures immune to this effect were [[tiefling]]s.

====Layer 9: Burningwater====
This layer had no ruler. It was an ocean of [[acid]], inhabited by twisted sea creatures.

====Layer 10: That Hellhole====
This layer had no ruler. The only food available in the layer were sentient creatures. It was discovered by the [[dwarf]] [[Gorbin]], who spent only three minutes in the layer, but returned with numerous bite and puncture marks in his [[adamantine]] [[armor]].

====Layer 11: Molrat====
Lordship over this layer was contested. It was an underground land of tunnels in eternal darkness, inhabited by demons that constantly hunted each other by sense of smell.

====Layer 12: Twelvetrees====
{{Main|Twelvetrees}}
[[File:Twelvetrees-3e.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The center of Twelvetrees during a ritual.'']]
This layer had no ruler.

The layer had been the site of a vile [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[ritual]] that involved the sacrifice of twelve [[astral deva]]s who had been tricked into going to the plane for a peace conference. The devas were bound to twelve enormous pine trees around an altar in the otherwise desolate layer, and the ritual infused the entire plane with strong [[evil]] energy that amplified the effects of all evil magic performed there. The deafening screams of the devas could still be heard throughout the layer, under a permanently cloudy and thunderous sky.

Besides the inflow of low-ranking [[demon]] pilgrims who enjoyed a sort of religious ecstasy when visiting, the layer was sparsely inhabited by patrolling [[chasme]]s and [[kelvezu]]s. A detachment of mortal sages from the [[Doomguard]] held a fortress on the layer, near a two-way portal to [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 1: Plain of Infinite Portals|Pazunia]]. Those sages held an alliance with a consortium of [[demon]]s to build [[Ship of chaos|ships of chaos]].

====Layer 13: Blood Tor====
{{Main|Blood Tor}}
This layer contained a vast ocean of red waters. It was characterized by inflicting bad luck on its visitors. It was the realm of two deities: [[Beshaba]], the Maid of Misfortune; and [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen, who dwelt in the depths of the red ocean.

The layer had been the site of an invasion of the Abyss by [[baatezu]], who counted it as one of their greatest successes in the early days of the [[Blood War]].

====Layer 14: The Steaming Fen====
This layer was the realm of the [[Queen of Chaos]].

====Layer 17: Death's Reward====
Realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Abraxas]] the Unfathomable.    

====Layer 21: The Sixth Pyre====
Realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Kardum]], Lord of the [[Balor]]s.

====Layer 23: The Iron Wastes====
{{Main|Iron Wastes}}
Also known as the '''Ice Wastes''', and illuminated by a dim and distant source, similar in brightness to a moon. It was the realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]], the Prince of Wrath.

The layer held an enormous amount of portals leading to a variety of planes, as well as other Abyssal layers. It was inhabited by [[frost giant]]s, [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]], [[mavawhan]]s, a small colony of [[ice archon]]s, and several desperate [[demon]]s. Because of the bitter cold, its inhabitants dwelt mostly in caves.

The plane was also the site of the ancient [[demon lord]] [[Veshvoriak]]'s imprisonment. He was said to possess a profound knowledge of various subjects, available for a price.

====Layer 27: Malignebula====
This layer was an endless expanse of [[acid]] clouds with no solid ground. It was the realm of the Gaseous Lady [[Lissa'aere]] the Noxious. The swirling poisonous mists were also home to [[alu-fiend]]s, [[nabassu]], and [[vrock]]s who formed an army of the Gaseous Lady to defend her realm from trespassers or direct [[baatezu]] threats to the borders of the Abyss.

Some of the acidic clouds could harden into ice occasionally, but would melt after fiends perched on them to rest. It was believed that those who fell far too deep were consumed by Lissa'aere herself.

====Layer 32: Sholo-Tovoth: The Fields of Consumption====
This layer was dominated by pure all-consuming hunger. Random pits spontaneously opened on the ground, dropping creatures in slowly digesting pools; the layer even affected visitors, who started losing taste for food and developed cravings for the flesh of sentient beings. It was mostly surrounded by the [[Gnashing Crags]], a range of mountains that resembled teeth. A second range of similar-looking but upside-down mountains could sometimes be glimpsed from far above the clouds.{{Cite dragon/376/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Turaglas, the Ebon Maw|21-22}} It was the realm of the [[demon prince]] [[Turaglas]], the Ebon Maw.

The layer was inhabited by predatory insects, [[purple worm]]s, [[vrock]]s, and other predators. Forests of flesh-eating trees led to an enormous [[acid]] ocean of gastric juices that eventually drained into the river [[Styx]]. At the bottom of this ocean, Turaglas slept, slowly coming back to consciousness.

====Layers 45â€“47: Azzagrat====
[[File:Azzagrat-3e.jpg|thumb|3000px|''The [[Forest of Vipers]] in the 45{{th}} layer of Rauwend.'']]
{{Main|Azzagrat}}
Also called the '''Triple realm''', Azzagrat spanned the 45th, 46th, and 47th layers of the Abyss:
;Rauwend{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing|34}} : The 45th layer was a windswept steppe with a continual gray sky.
;Shadowsky : The 46th layer had a luminous ground that projected shadows upwards into the sky.
;Voorz'zt : The 47th layer could only be accessed from the previous two; it received light from a blue sun and had purple icy flames.

All three layers were connected by the [[River of Salt]]. Rocks from Rauwend and Voorz'zt could be used to produce the purple [[bathaerel]] powder, a powerful rust-removing substance.{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing|31-32}}

The largest city of the Triple Realm was [[Zelatar]], which was also the location of the [[Argent Palace]], [[Graz'zt]]'s seat of power. It existed on all three layers and attracted visitors in search of obscure magic knowledge.

====Layer 48: Skeiqulac, the Ocean of Tears====
Also known as '''Nerebdian Vast''', this layer was a desert realm that bordered both [[Azzagrat]] and [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 49: Shaddonon|Shaddonon]].{{Cite dragon/360/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince}} It had no ruler, but was coveted by [[Graz'zt]], who wanted to make it his fourth kingdom.

====Layer 49: Shaddonon====
Realm of the [[demon lord|demon lady]] [[Rhyxali]], Queen of [[shadow demon]]s.

====Layer 52: Vorganund====
Lordship over this layer was contested.

====Layer 53: Phage Breeding Grounds====
Realm of [[Urae-Naas]] the [[Slaad]] Lord. It resembled the interior of an endless mass of decaying intestines. The entire layer itself was said to be the corpse of the dead [[primordial]] [[Ramenos]], god of the [[bullywug]]s.

====Layer 57: Torturous Truth====
Realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Alvarez]], the Purging Duke.

====Layer 65: Court of the Spider Queen====
This layer was also under the domain of [[Lolth]].

====Layer 66: The Demonweb Pits====
{{Main|Demonweb Pits}}
This layer was an immense network of webs that folded on themselves to form a single giant spider web. All structures such as buildings and ships hung from the webs as if caught by them. The web created random portals connecting to the [[Prime Material Plane]] that drew in objects. Deep within the web were dungeons, and far beneath those lay the bottomless pits where [[Lolth]] dwelt.

====Layer 67: The Heaving Hills====
Realm of [[varrangoin]]. It was formed of mountainous and swampy terrain and constantly shaken by earthquakes. With each earthquake, the terrain types were inverted and sometimes old ruins were unearthed. It was inhabited by [[froghemoth]]s and [[hezrou]].

====Layer 68: The Swallowed Void====
This layer was abandoned. It was barren and completely airless.

====Layer 69: Gibbering Hollow====
Also known as '''The Crushing Plain'''. This layer spawned an unusually high amount of [[mane]]s. The creatures were densely packed and occupied every bit of space on the layer's surface and underground tunnels, potentially crushing and suffocating any creature who arrived by means of a portal. The layer had been unclaimed until the [[primordial]] [[Ollomegh]] arrived, claiming the layer as his domain and starting to endlessly devour the manes to satiate his equally endless appetite.

====Layer 70: The Ice Floe====
This layer had no ruler. It was a cold plain of thin ice over an ocean of black water with intense undercurrents. The ice could break easily under heavy weight. The cold drained away the life force of all creatures. It was discovered by [[githzerai]].

====Layer 71: Spirac====
{{Main|Spirac}}
This layer was a perpetual wilderness that resisted any attempt at civilization. Its dense fern forests and weeds quickly consumed any buildings until not even their ruins remained. For that reason, the layer had no ruler and served as hunting grounds for [[demon lord]]s seeking game such as [[yeth hound]]s, [[vorr]]s, and [[nightmare beast]]s.

Atop one of the central mountains of the layer, there was a pool that had the power to rejuvenate a mortal that bathed in it. The price was to surrender a part of one's free will to [[Soneillon]], a [[demon lord|demon lady]] who dwelt in the depths of the pool.

====Layer 72: Darklight====
Realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Nocticula]] the Undeniable. Within the layer, the shadows of [[good]] creatures shone brightly, while [[evil]] creatures were shrouded in darkness. The bright creatures were easily hunted down by demons to be sold as slaves or killed.

====Layer 73: The Wells of Darkness====
{{Main|The Wells of Darkness}}
This layer was a rocky plain illuminated by a dim blue sun. It had scattered elevations surrounding pools of a black liquid, connected with one another by marble walkways. At the top of a higher mound, the crumbling fortress of [[Overlook]], inhabited by [[specter]]s and [[wraith]]s, provided a good view of the entire layer.

The realm had no ruler and was used by demon lords as a prison. The black liquid of the pools prevented escape, but allowed some telepathic communication so that the large custodian [[bodak]]s knew that the prisoners were still present. Only four prisoners were known to have escaped: [[Bayemon]], [[Shaktari]], [[Siragle]], and [[Zzyczesiya]].

One particular prisoner was the [[demon lord|demon lady]] [[Shami-Amourae]], the Lady of Delights and former consort of [[Demogorgon]], said to be one of the very few who truly understood his double personality.{{Cite dungeon/148/Wells of Darkness|53}} Shami-Amourae remained imprisoned until an attempted escape.{{Cite dungeon/148/Wells of Darkness|77-80}} She was later presumed dead, and was found to have become a [[vestige]] trapped within the domain of [[Demiplane of Dread#Barovia|Barovia]] in the [[Shadowfell]].

====Layer 74: Smaragd====
This layer was an extremely hot jungle of several layers of emerald canopies of shifting colors and [[poison]]ous fermenting pools under constant [[acid]] rain. It contained the realms of [[Merrshaulk]], [[god]] of the [[yuan-ti]], and [[Ramenos]], god of the [[bullywug]]s,

====Layer 77: The Gates of Heaven====
Realm of the [[demon lord]]s [[Munkir]], the White Guardian, and [[Nekir]], the Black Guardian.

====Layer 79: The Emessu Tunnels====
Realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Anarazel]], the Daring Darkness.

====Layer 81: Blood Shallows====
This layer was a marsh of [[acid]]ic blood-red water under a white sky with blue clouds. The river [[Styx]] ran on the edge of the swamp. The layer had no ruler,{{Cite dungeon/149/Enemies of My Enemy|75-76}}

====Layer 88: Gaping Maw====
[[File:Abysm.jpg|thumb|300px|''The brine flats and jutting rocks of Gaping Maw.'']]
{{Main|Gaping Maw}}
This layer consisted of a vast continent covered in jungle surrounded by an endless ocean and brine flats. It was the realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Demogorgon]], the Prince of Demons, one of the oldest and highest-ranking [[demon]]s in the Abyss.{{Cite dragon/357/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Demogorgon: Prince of Demons|21}}

The jungle portion of the realm, known as the [[Screaming Jungle]], was inhabited by [[troglodyte]]s, [[lizardfolk]], [[hezrou]], [[yuan-ti]], [[dinosaur]]s, [[dire ape]]s, and [[barlgura]]s. It held a two-way portal connecting to the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 90: The Guttering Grove|Guttering Grove]]. Together with [[Layers_of_the_Abyss#Layer_128:_Slugbed|Slugbed]] and [[Layers_of_the_Abyss#Layer_222:_Shedaklah|Shedaklah]], this was one of the layers whose jungles were inhabited by [[threeb]], a type of leech that was the main ingredient of the [[Quelaerel]] sauce.

The ocean portion was inhabited by [[aboleth]]s, [[ixitxachitl]], and [[kraken]]s. Demogorgon's lair was in the palace of [[Abysm]]: two serpentine towers topped with skull-shaped minarets whose bulk extended deep underwater into dark caverns. The deepest of these caverns and the deepest trenches of the ocean were connected with the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 89: The Shadowsea|Shadowsea]].

The entire layer was sometimes referred to by the names of its most prominent features, such as '''Abysm''' and '''Brine Flats'''.

====Layer 89: The Shadowsea====
{{Main|Shadowsea}}
This layer was a deep and perpetually dark ocean. It was the realm of the [[obyrith]] [[Dagon]], Prince of the Darkened Depths, who ruled it from inside an amorphous slimy palace inhabited by giant sea worms and luminescent gliding creatures. The realm was connected to the deepest trenches of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 88:Gaping Maw|Gaping Maw]].

The layer was inhabited mostly by [[wastrilith]]s, who had free rein of the depths, as well as roaming gigantic half-alive shapeless clouds of discolored pollution that stripped the flesh from anything that entered them.

====Layer 90: The Guttering Grove====
This layer was the realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Ilsidahur]],

Demogorgon and Ilsidahur once managed to capture the [[eladrin]] paragon [[Gwynharwyf]], but, due to their constant bickering, she was rescued and escaped, causing a strain in the demons' relations and fear by Ilsidahur of an invasion of his realm by Demogorgon.{{Cite dragon/357/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Demogorgon: Prince of Demons|25}} In fact, some later sources did call this layer the Screaming Jungle,

====Layer 92: Ulgurshek====
Realm of Ulgurshek, who was not a demon lord but a far more ancient entity who had been created even before the [[Great Wheel]] was formed.

====Layer 99: Unnamed====
This layer had no ruler. It consisted of a series of interconnected realms of completely different characteristics.

====Layer 100: The Barrens====
Realm of [[Oublivae]].

===Layers 101â€“200===
====Layer 111: The Mind of Evil====
Realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Sch'thrruppasstt]] (sometimes known as [[Sch'theraqpasstt]]), the Serpent Reborn,{{Cite dragon/151/The Ecology of the Yuan-ti|33}} The layer was a sentient but insane chaotic whirling. It was put in that state when Sch'thrruppasstt attempted to merge his life essence with the plane in an attempt to gain ultimate power and immortality. The process succeeded, fusing the layer and its master's mind into one and making the Serpent Reborn indestructible to all but those with the ability to destroy the entire layer. However, merging with the chaotic plane ruined his sanity and the layer. He could still send out a minor fragment of his psyche that would reform in 111 days if destroyed elsewhere. Magic was nullified on the layer and anyone trapped there was at the mercy of an insane, living dimension. Most planar travelers knew of the danger of this realm and so the Mind of Evil was avoided at all costs.{{Cite dragon/151/The Ecology of the Yuan-ti|34}}

====Layer 113: Thanatos====
{{Main|Thanatos (layer)}}
This layer was a land of ruin and death, with sterile heaths, black forests, and desolate mountains filled with ruins and scattered tombs, inhabited by a variety of [[undead]].

The [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]], the Prince of Undeath, ruled Thanatos from his seat in the [[Everlost]] palace, a castle made of obsidian and bone located in a vast wasteland called [[Oblivion's End]]. Orcus had been temporarily deposed of his post by the [[drow]] goddess [[Kiaransalee]], who took control of the realm for a few centuries until Orcus returned and deposed her, forcing her to flee to the [[Layers_of_the_Abyss#Layer_66:_The_Demonweb_Pits|Demonweb]].

Orcus maintained a second lair in the fortress city of [[Naratyr]], the City of the Dead. It was a quiet, cold and mostly empty city (except for the occasional wandering [[undead]]) surrounded by an icy moat fed by the river [[Styx]]. The city used to be Kiaransalee's winter capital, and was left deserted following the return of the layer's original master. The inner walls of the central castle of bone were made of flesh and decorated with carpets made of hair.

Some sources counted this as layer 333.

====Layer 128: Slugbed====
This layer was a vast expanse of forests, shallow seas, and underground caverns, always covered in fog under a faintly lit sky. It was the realm of the [[demon lord]] [[Lupercio]],

On rare occasions, the sun did shine feebly through the fog on the layer, revealing glimpses of majestic angelic castles on cloud tops, a possible attempt by the [[angels]] to take advantage of Lupercio's slumber in order to convert the layer into a bastion of [[good]].

Together with [[Layers_of_the_Abyss#Layer_88:_Gaping_Maw|Gaping Maw]] and [[Layers_of_the_Abyss#Layer_222:_Shedaklah|Shedaklah]], this was one of the layers whose jungles were inhabited by [[threeb]], a type of leech that was the main ingredient of the [[Quelaerel]] sauce.{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing|32}}

[[File:Drooling_jungle-3e.jpg|thumb|left|275px|''The [[Drooling Jungle]], a forest near the periphery of Hollow's Heart.'']]
Fraz-Urb'luu's realm used to cover the entire layer, until the demon prince was imprisoned for over two centuries in the world of [[Oerth]]. Upon his return, he found the layer to have been destabilized, becoming little more than a featureless flat expanse of white dust under a starless black sky with very few structures scattered on it. Within a few decades of his return he had managed to rebuild part of his realm but, despite having accomplished recreating much of what existed, up to the size of a large continent, the demon lord required a legendary ''[[staff of power]]'' in order to rebuild the realm in its entirety. Without the aid of the staff, progress was slow and by the late 1480s [[DR]] most of the infinite plain remained nearly entirely featureless.{{Cite dragon/333/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Fraz-Urb'luu: Prince of Deception|36-39}}

The demon lord's lair was located at the center of the continent-sized reconstructed area, in the city of [[Zoragmelok]], a circular walled city of [[adamantine]] walls and impossible architecture.

====Layer 177: Writhing Realm====
Realm of the [[obyrith]] [[Ugudenk]] the Squirming King.

====Layer 181: The Rotting Plain====
{{Main|Rotting Plain}}
This layer was the realm of [[Laogzed]], patron god of [[troglodytes]]. Laogzed's personal lair was a cavern complex he constantly prowled searching for things to devour. Whatever he devoured would become one with the plane itself, and so the plains were used by other tanar'ri as a permanent dumping ground.

====Layer 230: The Dreaming Gulf====
{{Main|Dreaming Gulf}}
This layer had no ruler. It was a dark, windy, and phantasmagoric realm that contained floating dreams of [[evil]] [[god]]s of dead pantheons. These dreams were then slowly processed by the Abyss itself and then released on the [[Prime Material Plane]] in the form of [[loumara]] [[demon]]s.

====Layer 241: Palpitatia====

It was the realm of [[Eltab]],{{Cite dragon/355/Volo's Guide: Demon Cults of the Realms|71}} in {{Yearlink|-160}}.

During Eltab's absence, his [[balor]] lieutenants fought constantly for control of the layer. As a consequence of Eltab's summoning and imprisonment, fragments of the layer called [[demoncyst]]s were transported to Northeastern [[FaerÃ»n]], where they lay buried and many remained undiscovered.

====Layer 274: Durao====
{{Main|Durao}}
This layer had no ruler. It was a militaristic layer with iron roads and vast fetid swamps, with military encampments and barracks assembled on the shores of the river [[Styx]].

The layer was discovered by [[Xorna]], a former [[githyanki]] slave of the armanites who managed to escape her captivity.

Gallenshu was once a lush land with over a dozen cities inhabited by [[varrangoin]]s. A map-like painting of the layer from that time period was located in the fortress Overlook in [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 73: The Wells of Darkness|The Wells of Darkness]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/148/Wells of Darkness|73}}

====Layer 380: Hungry Tarns====
This layer was a bleak domain of poisonous fens and black, bottomless lakes previously ruled by the not-quite-dead obyrith lord [[Sertrous]].

====Layer 399: Worm Realm====
{{Main|Worm Realm}}
This layer was entirely made of solid rock, hollowed out into a maze of tunnels and chambers. It was the realm of the [[gnome]] [[god]] [[Urdlen]],

The layer was inhabited by [[gnome]] petitioners, [[mane]]s, [[purple worm]]s, [[hezrou]], and [[umber hulk]]s, who were all infected by a rotting fungal growth. This infectious disease was said to be the result of some past feud between Urdlen and [[Zuggtmoy]].

This layer was one of the least accessible in the Abyss. It was the realm of the [[obyrith]] [[Pale Night]], and a prison for an army of [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]] from [[Arborea]] whom Pale Night trapped there to torture and kill. However, many [[good]]-aligned individuals, such as a [[ki-rin]], [[foo creature]]s, [[moon dog]]s, [[hollyphant]]s, and [[couatl]]s, invaded Androlynne to fiercely defend the captive eladrin and to attempt to free them from Pale Night.

Because of the centuries of genuinely good influence on the plane, Androlynne became a surreally beautiful and alien place, with huge purple clouds that assumed strange shapes and lush vegetation.

====Layer 480: Guttlevetch====
This layer was home to ceaseless hurricanes, bloody beaches, and shipwrecks beyond counting. Guttlevetch was originally the realm of the demon lord [[Zuregurex]], Lord of the Drowned. After a failed ploy by Zuregurex to invade the [[Gaping Maw]], Demogorgon destroyed Guttlevetch, sinking its islands and turning the layer's waters against its ruler. Zuregurex was forced to abandon Guttlevetch and flee to the [[Scalding Sea]], but was rumored to secretly have returned to rebuild his realm.

====Layer 487: Lair of the Beast and Mansion of the Rake====
{{Main|Lair of the Beast and Mansion of the Rake}}
This layer was the interior of a vast, ever-changing baroque palace. It was the realm of the [[vampire]] [[demigod]] [[Kanchelsis]], who enjoyed constantly changing his halls, stairways, and gardens to terrorize visitors.

====Layer 503: Torremor====
{{Main|Torremor}}
This layer was an enormous tangle of pieces of masonry such as bridges, arches, beams, and pinnacles, held together by ropes and chains. It had once been the realm of the demon lord [[Pazuzu]], who imprisoned [[Lamashtu]], the Demon Queen of Monstrous Births, in the prison of [[Onstrakker's Nest]], a building made of bones, earth, and stone within the enormous structure. Even though she was impaled by the building's spire, Lamashtu took control of the layer and made it her realm.

====Layer 507: Occipitus====
This layer incorporated what had once been a part of [[Celestia]], after it was invaded by an army of conquering [[demon]]s. In order to contain the invasion, the [[angels]] detached a portion of the plane and cast it into the Abyss, where it merged with the existing layer of Occipitus. The [[demon lord]] [[Adimarchus]], the Prince of Madness,{{Cite dungeon/107/Test of the Smoking Eye|38-39}}{{Cite dungeon/116/Asylum|60-63}}

Occipitus had an organic appearance, with the ground made of a spongy flesh-like substance; forests of bones-like columns reminiscent of massive rib-bones; and plains of ulcers and cysts sometime still digesting fallen celestials. The layer had the form of a large basin with a mountain-sized skull in its center, and deadly plasms of fire and evil energy filled its sky. The layer contained many places still infused with the power of Celestia, causing fiends to stay away from them.{{Cite dungeon/107/Test of the Smoking Eye|45-55}}

After Adimarchus's disappearance, the layer remained mostly abandoned and had a reputation of being a cursed place, even for demons. Any [[fiend]] who lingered there started suffering from madness and magical illnesses, as the demon lord's madness kept leaking into the layer.

====Layer 518: Melantholep====
This layer inflicted madness on whoever visited it. It was said to be the nesting grounds of the [[chole dragon]]s. It was not known whether "Melantholep" was the name of the layer itself or of some unknown demon prince who ruled over it.{{Cite dragon/344/Planar Dragons|30}}

====Layer 531: Vudra====
This layer was dominated by the [[Bloodsea]], an ocean of [[poison]]ous blood dotted with hundreds of islands overgrown with monstrous tropical plants that only existed there. The very air was poisonous. It was the realm of the giant eight-armed [[marilith]] [[Shaktari]], the Queen of Mariliths. While powerful mariliths ruled many of the islands, Shaktari spent most of the time at the bottom of the Bloodsea, which was connected to the river [[Styx]].{{Cite dragon/359/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Apocrypha|51}}

The native creatures in the layer included [[rakshasa]], [[yuan-ti]], and [[eye-wing]]s.

[[Demogorgon]] held several such pools in the city of [[Lemoriax]] in [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 88: Gaping Maw|Gaping Maw]],{{Cite dragon/341/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Baphomet: Prince of Beasts|24}}

====Layer 566: Soulfreeze====
This icy layer was the realm of [[Aseroth]], the Winter Warlock, who had formerly been an elemental prince that turned into a [[demon]]. It was predominantly a permafrost layer with an advancing glacier, inhabited by [[remorhaz]]es, [[ice archon]]s, and different types of [[demon]]s. The extremely malevolent cold of the layer was said to be capable of freezing creatures' thoughts and emotions.

There was a two-way portal connecting this realm with the [[Frostfell (plane)|para-elemental plane of ice]], but activation of the portal required the destruction of a mortal soul.

====Layer 665: The Void====
A bottomless black void where victims fell until they died from dehydration, or the winds flayed the flesh from their bones. Certain types of magic were dampened, so while spells like ''[[fireball]]'' and ''[[lightning bolt]]'' functioned normally, ''[[feather fall]]'' and ''[[levitate]]'' did not. Although several portals led into this layer, there were no portals leading out.

====The Plains of Rust====
This layer had once been a neglected swamp with intermittent portals to the [[Nine Hells]]. When [[devil]]s discovered this connection, they set up a colony in the poisonous swamp. Upon discovery of this invasion, [[Orcus]] and [[Juiblex]] combined forces to strengthen the poisonous nature of the plane and imbue it with necrotic energy, causing all iron and structures on the layer to decay and crumble, until all that was left was a tightly packed layer of rust and ruins, inhabited by [[undead]] and evil [[construct]]s. The portals to the Nine Hells remained since buried and unusable.
