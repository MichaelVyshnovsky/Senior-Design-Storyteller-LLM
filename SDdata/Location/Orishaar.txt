'''Orishaar''' was an ancient kingdom of [[moon elves]] created during the [[First Flowering]]. 

==History==
The kingdom was a trade partner of [[Aryvandaar]], and this link was a good excuse for the Ilythiiri [[dark elves]] to attack the moon elves and take their land. Around {{Yearlink|-11700}}, the kingdom was destroyed by the Ilythiir kingdom of [[dark elves]] during the second war of the [[Crown Wars]]. As time past, the ruins were engulfed by the [[Duskwood]] and the [[Shaar]].
