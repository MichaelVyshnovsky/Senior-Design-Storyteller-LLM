        "mainbody": "akvaligach, also called the \"Northern Barrens\", was the most dangerous region of the Great Glacier.\nNakvaligach, the smallest of the three regions of the Glacier, was located north of Alpuk, across the Uppuk River.\nUnlike the two \"Basins\", Alpuk and Angalpuk, Nakvaligach was covered with mountainous terrain and treacherous crevasses.\nThe ice depth was usually between 200 and 500 feet (60&ndash150 m), though it thinned to as little as five to ten feet (one and a half to three meters) in central areas. In the northern mountains, the ice layer was nearly a mile (one and a half kilometers) thick. There was very little potable water in the region. \nBecause of the higher altitudes, stronger winds, and distance from the larger seas, the temperatures in Nakvaligach were more severe than anywhere else on the Great Glacier, dropping even as low as 150 &degF (100 &degC) below zero in the northernmost mountains. \nElsewhere, average temperatures ranged from &minus50 &degF (&minus46 &degC) to 15 &degF (&minus9 &degC)) with a daytime average of &minus5 &degF (&minus21 &degC) and a nighttime average of &minus35 &degF (&minus37 &degC). In the month of Flamerule, temperatures might range from &minus20 &degF (&minus29 &degC) to 30 &degF (&minus1 &degC) with a daytime average of 10 &degF (&minus12 &degC) and a nighttime average of &minus10 &degF (&minus23 &degC). \nDuring autumn, (the months of Eleasis through Uktar,) they ranged from &minus55 &degF (&minus48 &degC) to 0 &degF (&minus18 &degC). The daytime average was &minus10 &degF (&minus23 &degC), and the nighttime average &minus40 &degF (&minus40 &degC). \nTemperatures fell as low as &minus95 &degF (&minus71 &degC) in the long winter (from Nightal to Tarsakh) and rarely rose any higher than &minus30 &degF (&minus34 &degC). The average temperatures for winter were &minus55 &degF (&minus48 &degC) during the day and &minus75 &degF (&minus59 &degC) at night. Strong winds could make them temperatures seem even colder.\nFewer than five to eight inches (thirteen to twenty centimeters) of precipitation fell in the region per year.\nDeer, polar bears, and a variety of fish and birds were found in Nakvaligach. Unlike other regions of the Great Glacier, seals did not live here, and the caribou populations were lower,\nThe mukteff, a gold-furred sled dog, was native to Nakvaligach.\nTirichik laired in the most desolate areas of Nakvaligach, deep within its crevasses.\nShort birch, evergreen, or willow trees somehow managed to survive in isolated regions of Nakvaligach, rarely growing more than ten feet (three meters) tall.\nFlame heather was a strange plant unique to Nakvaligach. This yellow and red plant was known to burn very slowly, which made it useful for house fire pits.\nIn 1339 DR, Sharra Frohm the great-great-great-granddaughter of the famous explorer Palus Frohm set out to explore Nakvaligach and complete a second volume of his work Blood and Ice.\n Igotak Sea  This was the largest body of water in Nakvaligach, but it was frozen solid the whole year.\n Kresttet  This village was the largest human settlement in Nakvaligach.\n Olyniak Crevasse  This deep chasm was rumored to have a network of tunnels at the bottom that led to Ulutius resting place.\n The Shakkak Pit  This deep chasm was filled with fairy ice and was a burial ground for white dragons.\nOnly about five percent of the Ulutiun humans living on the Great Glacier lived in Nakvaligach, because of its hostile environment. These people were the Nakulutiuns, and their total population was estimated between 2,500 and 3,750 souls in 1359 DR. The largest (by far) Nakulutiun settlement was Kresttet, which only had a population of 300.\nFrost giants and white dragons lived in the mountains, and both groups kept the Nakulutiuns living in fear with periodic raiding.\nSmall groupings (usually fewer than seven individuals) of yeti also roamed the mountains here. Some of them were subservient to the white dragons."
