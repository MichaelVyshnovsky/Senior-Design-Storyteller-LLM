        "mainbody": "Because of the higher altitudes, stronger winds, and distance from the larger seas, the temperatures in Nakvaligach were more severe than anywhere else on the Great Glacier, dropping even as low as 150 &deg;F (100 &deg;C) below zero in the northernmost mountains. \n\nElsewhere, average temperatures ranged from &minus;50 &deg;F (&minus;46 &deg;C) to 15 &deg;F (&minus;9 &deg;C)) with a daytime average of &minus;5 &deg;F (&minus;21 &deg;C) and a nighttime average of &minus;35 &deg;F (&minus;37 &deg;C).

        "Geography": "Nakvaligach, the smallest of the three regions of the Glacier, was located north of [[Alpuk]], across the [[Uppuk River]].\n\nUnlike the two \"Basins\", Alpuk and [[Angalpuk]], Nakvaligach was covered with mountainous terrain and treacherous crevasses.\n\nThe ice depth was usually between 200 and 500 feet (60&ndash;150 m), though it thinned to as little as five to ten feet (one and a half to three meters) in central areas. In the northern mountains, the ice layer was nearly a mile (one and a half kilometers) thick. There was very little potable water in the region.",

        "Flora & Fauna": "[[Deer]], [[polar bear]]s, and a variety of fish and birds were found in Nakvaligach. Unlike other regions of the Great Glacier, [[seal]]s did not live here, and the [[caribou]] populations were lower,\n\nThe ''[[mukteff]]'', a gold-furred sled dog, was native to Nakvaligach.\n\n[[Tirichik]] laired in the most desolate areas of Nakvaligach, deep within its crevasses.\n\nShort birch, evergreen, or willow trees somehow managed to survive in isolated regions of Nakvaligach, rarely growing more than ten feet (three meters) tall.\n\n[[Flame heather]] was a strange plant unique to Nakvaligach. This yellow and red plant was known to burn very slowly, which made it useful for house fire pits.",
        "History": "In [[1339 DR]], [[Sharra Frohm]] the great-great-great-granddaughter of the famous explorer [[Palus Frohm]] set out to explore Nakvaligach and complete a second volume of his work ''[[Blood and Ice]]''.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "[[Igotak Sea]]": "This was the largest body of water in Nakvaligach, but it was frozen solid the whole year.",
            "[[Kresttet]]": "This village was the largest [[human]] settlement in Nakvaligach.",
            "[[Olyniak Crevasse]]": "This deep chasm was rumored to have a network of tunnels at the bottom that led to [[Ulutiu]]'s resting place.",
            "The [[Shakkak Pit]]": "This deep chasm was filled with [[fairy ice]] and was a burial ground for [[white dragon]]s."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "Only about five percent of the [[Ulutiun]] humans living on the Great Glacier lived in Nakvaligach, because of its hostile environment. These people were the [[Nakulutiun]]s, and their total population was estimated between 2,500 and 3,750 souls in [[1359 DR]]. The largest (by far) Nakulutiun settlement was Kresttet, which only had a population of 300.\n\n[[Frost giant]]s and white dragons lived in the mountains, and both groups kept the Nakulutiuns living in fear with periodic raiding.\n\nSmall groupings (usually fewer than seven individuals) of [[yeti]] also roamed the mountains here. Some of them were subservient to the white dragons."
