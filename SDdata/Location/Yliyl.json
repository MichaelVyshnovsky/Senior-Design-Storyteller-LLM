        "mainbody": "Humans (Bedine)\nYliyl was a minor oasis found in the Sword region of southern Anauroch.\nThe small hollow comprised a small pool of water surrounded by some palm trees and desert shrubs.\nIt was located in an isolated area of The Sword, west of the Hills of Scent.\nThe only notable animals to make their way to Yliyl were desert scavengers like jackals and vultures.\nLong before the Era of Upheaval, an entire tribe of Bedine perished from some unknown disease and were buried in the sands around Yliyl.\nOver the years, stories about the lost Bedine tribe were transformed into something else entirely. As of the midâ€“14 century DR, these tales metamorphized into rumors about great treasure that was buried beneath the oasis."
