'''Tsenviilyq''' was a [[derro]] city in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[High Moor]].<ref group="note" name="identity">Within a Q&A session about the sourcebook ''[[Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark]]'', author [[Eric L. Boyd]] clarified that this location on that book's map was intended to be the same derro city as described (but unnamed) in the sourcebook ''[[Elminster's Ecologies Appendix II]]''.

==Geography==
Tsenviilyq was located in the [[Lowerdark]] region of the Underdark, in a series of caverns known as the [[Sharnlands]].

==Inhabitants==
The people of this city did not venture out onto the surface too often, but when they did it was usually on expeditions to acquire [[slavery|slaves]].

==Rumors & Legends==
* [[Adventurer]]s who had seen the city claimed that the derro waged a war against the local [[illithid]]s for control of the area.
* [[Vincin|Vincin the Gray Druid]] theorized that the derro of this city had likely descended from the former inhabitants of the [[Halls of the Hammer]].
