Tsenviilyq was a derro city in the Underdark beneath the High Moor.Within a Q&A session about the sourcebook Drizzt DoUrdens Guide to the Underdark, author Eric L. Boyd clarified that this location on that books map was intended to be the same derro city as described (but unnamed) in the sourcebook Elminsters Ecologies Appendix II.
Tsenviilyq was located in the Lowerdark region of the Underdark, in a series of caverns known as the Sharnlands.
The people of this city did not venture out onto the surface too often, but when they did it was usually on expeditions to acquire slaves.
* Adventurers who had seen the city claimed that the derro waged a war against the local illithids for control of the area.
* Vincin the Gray Druid theorized that the derro of this city had likely descended from the former inhabitants of the Halls of the Hammer.
