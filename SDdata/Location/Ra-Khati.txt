'''Ra-Khati''' was a country of the [[Hordelands]]. The country was found deep in the heart of [[Katakoro Shan]]. The country was a successor state to [[Anok-Imaskar]] after its demise in {{Yearlink|-1943}}.

==History==
===Ancient History===
Then known as '''Khati''', the land was annexed by the [[Imaskari]] during the height of the [[Imaskar Empire]] ({{Yearlink|-7975}} to {{Yearlink|-6788}}). Through the Middle Kingdoms period ({{Yearlink|-6422}} to {{Yearlink|-4370}}), it was a province of the Upper Kingdom of the empire, encompassing the lands later known as Ra-Khati and [[Khazari]]. These held the cities of [[Einihyi]], [[Gajueh]], [[Medzoa]], and [[Thakos]], which was capital of the eastern empire.

The Imaskar Empire fell in {{Yearlink|-2488}}, but the eastern provinces of Khati and [[Katakoro]] emerged relatively unscathed. Thus, in {{Yearlink|-2487}}, Kujawa claimed the Dragon Throne in Thakos and declared himself Emperor, founding a new realm, [[Anok-Imaskar]], with Khati at its heart. Kujawa died fighting a great [[t'ien lung]] [[dragon]] in {{Yearlink|-1943}}. His death led to the empire fracturing into warring states, among them the new independent realm called '''Ra-Khati'''. Thakos would become known as Saikhoi.

==Modern History==
In [[1360 DR]], Raja [[Ambuchar Devayam]] of [[Solon]] led his [[undead]] armies in an easy conquest of Ra-Khati and a number of settlements on the [[Katakoro Plateau]].

==Society==
Ra-Khati was an isolationist nation that feared people from the outside. Anyone who wandered into the nation was given the option to either have their tongues cut out, to remain forever as a citizen, or to be killed, in order to prevent them from telling the outside world about it. Because of this, little was known about the country in the rest of the world.

==Economy==
The country was enormously wealthy in mineral resources. There was no lack of material goods for the average person.

[[Barley]], millet, sheep, and yaks were the things primary grown and raised in Ra-Khati.

Ra-Khati had no trade with the outside world since the destruction of the city of [[Kushk]] by the forces of [[Solon]].

==Government==
Ra-Khati was a theocracy, ruled by the various [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]]s of the monasteries. The leader was the [[Dalai Lama]], the highest priest of the nation.

Each town was overseen by the lama of the town's monastery. The lamas were assisted by the [[sohei]], who handled most of the administrative duties including tax collection, defending the town from monsters, and catching criminals.

The lamas ruled the people fairly, although many of their laws were considered arbitrary and strict.

==Notable Locations==
The most important city in Ra-Khati was [[Saikhoi]], the capital city, which sat between two sacred lakes on a hill.

==Religion==
Ra-Khati followed the [[Padhran religion|Padhran faith]] as the state religion. However, outsiders sometimes reported Ra-Khati followed the [[Path of Enlightenment]] like most of the lands of the east, adding the many [[padhrasattva]] they worshiped as gods of protection to belief system of the Path.''[[Storm Riders]]'' explores Ra-Khati and presents it as following a Buddhism-inspired faith of the [[Padhra]], but ''[[The Horde]]'' merges the Padhran religion with the Path of Enlightenment, a Confucianism-inspired faith (with Buddhism-like elements) presented earlier in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'', and even says that Ra-Khati follows "a version of the Path of Enlightenment". Owing to the ambiguities of these faiths in ''The Horde'' and their very different doctrines and origins, this wiki assumes they are different and that Ra-Khati indeed follows the Padhran faith, or some version of it. It is possible the Padhran faith here is influenced by the Path of Enlightenment.

Every major city in Ra-Khati had a monastery of some size, and each monastery was dedicated to its own padhrasattva. However, there was no fighting between the monasteries, as monks worshiped every padhrasattva.
