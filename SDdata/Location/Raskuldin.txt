'''Raskuldin''' ({{Pronounce|Ras|SKULL|din|refs=}}) was a small realm of [[dwarves]] in the [[Shining Lands]] of [[southeast Faerûn]]. It was home to the [[Darraskh]] clan.

==Geography==
The realm lay beneath the [[Dustwall Mountains]] near [[Durpar]].

==Trade==
As of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Raskuldin performed a great many expeditions into the [[Underdark]] to hunt, slay, and capture various monsters. In particular, they used captured [[deepspawn]] to "farm" livestock, especially [[rothé]] that made excellent roasts.

==History==
The realm was founded by the famous clanless [[adventurer]] [[Raskuldra]] "Axehair".
