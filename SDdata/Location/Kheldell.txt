'''Kheldell''' was a thorp on the northern brim of the [[Westwood]] in the foothills of the [[Sword Coast Spires]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The only way into the small village of log homes was by taking the trail to [[Red Larch]].

The economy of the village centered around logging and the [[horse]]-powered sawmill. As of [[1365 DR]], the leader of the loggers was a [[wizard]] named [[Ghelkyn]] who ''[[levitate]]d'' the cut timber to waiting horse teams who would then transport them to Red Larch for sale.

As of [[1365 DR]] decisions about the town were made by consensus but the most influential people were Ghelkyn and [[Shala Thaeral]], the ''Voice of the Circle''.

The small village was also home to [[Tchandrae Euinwood]], a girl with mysterious powers of [[magic]]al identification.
