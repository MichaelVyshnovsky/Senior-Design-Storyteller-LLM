The bridge was located near the ancient dwarfhold of Fireguard Fortress.
Firecross Bridge was held by the fire giant Grumthrox and the fire archon Immolus in the , when the cult of Maegera came into conflict with the forces of Neverwinter and the dwarves of Clan Hillborn. The two cult leaders were defeated and the Hillborn expedition took control of the bridge.
