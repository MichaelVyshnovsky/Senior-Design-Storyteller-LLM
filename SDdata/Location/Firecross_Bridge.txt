'''Firecross Bridge''' was a great bridge found within [[Mount Hotenow]], originally built by the [[dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]].<ref group="note">While the exact origins of the bridge are not explicitly stated, the matching architecture and close proximity to [[Fireguard Fortress]] suggest that it was built around the same time.

==Geography==
The bridge was located near the ancient dwarfhold of [[Fireguard Fortress]].

==History==
Firecross Bridge was held by the [[fire giant]] [[Grumthrox]] and the [[fire archon]] [[Immolus]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, when the [[cult of Maegera]] came into conflict with the forces of [[Neverwinter]] and the dwarves of [[Clan Hillborn]].{{Cite web/Neverwinter Developer Blog/CTA: Battle for the Bridge}} The two cult leaders were defeated and the Hillborn expedition took control of the bridge.
