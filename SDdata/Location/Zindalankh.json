        "mainbody": "Zindalankh was a coastal city of Murghôm.\nZindalankh sat on the western rim of the Semphar Water within the southern portion of Gbor Nor. \nZindalankh hosted a Shou Town.\nAround the , Martek departed from the city in a caravan headed for Medinat Muskawoon with the intention of stopping Khalitharius.\nZindalankh was a fierce rival of Dhaztanar, which was located on the opposite bank of the Semphar Water in Semphar. Being located at the end of the Road of the Dawn, it controlled trade to the west, just as Dhaztanar controlled trade to the east, and both cities vied for control over the trade in Gbor Nor.\nUltimately, Dhaztanar won the power struggle by lobbying to make the River Rauthenflow navigable by boats, allowing people to bypass Zindalankh, and sail straight from the Inner Sea to Dhaztanars docks, destroying the citys power.\nBy 1359 DR, Zindalankh had shrunk. Its fortunes were gone and its people were poor and destitute. The city became a haven for the pirates of Gbor Nor. People came to the city to sell stolen items, and buy others for far less than their value. Thievery, and the sword, were the only law.\nThough officially under the rule of the Bey of Murghôm, few followed his laws, and only tolerated him for the protection he gave to the city. Were it not for the forces of Murghom stationed there, Semphar would have destroyed the city long before. However, doing so with the Beys men there would have been seen as an act of war, something Semphar wanted to avoid.\n*Ghuldribrand Mroster, Mage Royal of Zindalankh\n*A ruin in the Plains of Purple Dust southwest of Zindalankh held the process which Velsharoon used to become a lich and then ascend."
