'''Havenmere''' was a small village in the [[Thunder Gap]] on the edge of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
The village was very isolated and typically only visited by travelers who got lost. The inhabitants couldn't explain why the village was founded in such a poor location, and didn't care.

==Geography==
Havenmere was on the southern side of Thunder Gap, on the edge of a deep, cold lake also called [[Havenmere (lake)|Havenmere]] between two spurs of the [[Thunder Peaks]]. It was located deep in the Thunder Gap and variously claimed by Cormyr or [[Sembia]].

==Trade==
The village grew struggling crops around the lake where the poor soil was marginally better, and raised bad-tempered [[sheep]] that grazed the nearby slopes.

==History==
[[File:Simon Weems.png|thumbnail|right|250px|''Simon Weems's warm welcome.'']]
A curious event took place in the otherwise unremarkable village one day—a great magical storm swept over the land, tearing at it with lightning, wind, and rain briefly before disappearing. This formed ''[[gate]]s'' that deposited two otherworldly beings, a [[human]] called [[Simon Weems]], and a monstrous creature simply known as the [[Demon (Havenmere)|Demon]]. While the demon ran and hid in the mountains to plot nefarious deeds, Simon was captured by the locals and tied to a stake to be burned, as they thought him to be an evil monster come to destroy the village. Simon was saved from an unfortunate fate by a group of [[adventurer]]s, who took custody of him and spoke with the local man [[Senecus]], who guessed at the true nature of the phenomena and how to resolve it.

The adventurers tracked down the demon and likely captured it and reunited it with Simon. If they were successful, the ''gates'' that brought them to [[Toril]] would have reappeared and sent both of them home, saving Havenmere from any further adventures.
