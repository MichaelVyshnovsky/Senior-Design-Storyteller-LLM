'''Shyr''' was a continent on the planet of [[Abeir]]. It was the equivalent in that world to the [[Toril]]ian continent of [[Faerûn]].

==Geography==
{{main|Shyr (realm)}}
{{See also|Akanûl}}
The only country of this continent known to the sages of Faerûn was the realm of Shyr, of which Akanûl was once part of, until it was exchanged with parts of the lands of [[Chondath]] and western [[Chessenta]], which in turn became part of that Abeiran continent.

For a time, the lands of [[Unther]] were also part of this continent.

==Inhabitants==
Its known inhabitants were [[genasi]] such as [[Karshimis]], who was the last known ruler of the continent before the Spellplague transported Akanûl to [[Toril]].

For a time, the second incarnation of [[Gilgeam]] was also an inhabitant of Shyr.
