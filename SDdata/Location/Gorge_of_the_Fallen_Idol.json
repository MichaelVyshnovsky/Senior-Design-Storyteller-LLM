        "mainbody": "The Gorge of the Fallen Idol, formerly known as the Gorge of Nomog-Geaya the Warrior, was a deep canyon carved by the River Ith in the county of Hazamarch in Tethyr.\nThe gorge was formed at the point where the Idolflow merged with the River Ith, at the southern border of Hazamarch. The cliffs of the gorge contained many caves.\nThe place was formerly the site of a massive idol of the hobgoblin god Nomog-Geaya.\nThe region around the Gorge of the Fallen Idol was once the home of a civilization of hobgoblins or other large goblinoids. By the late 114 century DR, young dragons instead lived in its caves. They took shelter there from older and larger wyrms and took delight in playing pranks on (or enslaving or eating) those who came to use the fallen idol as a place of worship.\nOther monsters seemed to congregate near the Gorge, causing security problems to the county of Hazamarch, even sending attacks against Iltarghal Keep a few times each summer.\nBetween  and , during the Clash at Earthrift (an older name for the gorge), a battle of Shanatar dwarves and their Tethir elven allies against the giants and humans, the dwarves intentionally set off a landslide to fall upon their foes. The falling earth buried alive more than a score of giants, but the destruction also accidentally killed two elven princes. This event triggered the abandonment of their dwarven allies by the elves of the Forest of Tethir, and the tide of the battle turned until the day was ultimately won by the humans and giants. Over the next century from this event, relations between the elves and dwarves continued to deteriorate.\nAround , long before the existence of either Tethyr or Calimshan as a kingdom, No fewer than three separate tribes, led by shaman rulers inhabited the gorge for 1500 years.\nThe dwarves of Shanatar tried several times to defeat the hobgoblin tribes but were never successful, nor were the elves or humans. but only after four separate battles. After its fall, the humans were able to slaughter the goblinoids of the region.\nSome believed that a power still lingered in the remains of the once great idol and claimed it as their own god.\nSome suggested that the Idolflow had a drainage point the led below the surface of the gorge, which was why that river once contained a lake and no longer did."
