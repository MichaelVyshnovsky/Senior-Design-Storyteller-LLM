Zelpir was a small city in Var the Golden in the Shining Lands in 1367 DR.
Zelpir sat on the southwest shore of the Golden Water near Pyratar. Its location as the closest port to Heldapan made it the prime choice for those wishing to ship their wares north.
Known for its production of fine jewelry and mechanical devices, some believed Zelpirs products rivaled those of the Lantannan Gondsmen. Water clocks, mechanical toys, and field glasses were just a few of the wonders that could be purchased here.
Zelpir transported grain via ship or caravan north to Unther and Mulhorand.
Though it only possessed a population of 8,000 inhabitants, Zelpir was growing quickly. However, the merchants were cautious about who they allowed to start a business within their city. All new businesses needed to be licensed and approved by the city council.
