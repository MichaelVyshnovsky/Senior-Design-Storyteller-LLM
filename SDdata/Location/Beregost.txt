'''Beregost''' ({{Pronounce|BEAR|eh|gost|refs=}}) was a town on the [[Coast Way]], halfway between [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Amn]]. It was a popular stop for many visiting merchant caravans, especially those en route to [[Waterdeep]] in the north or to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the east.

==Description==
[[File:Beregost BG.jpg|thumb|''The town of Beregost in the 14{{th}} century DR.''|360x360px]]
In the 14{{Th}} century [[DR]], Beregost was a small town of about forty main buildings, smaller structures placed on the outskirts of town, and larger family states were built outside of the town's borders. The grandest structure in Beregost was the [[Song of the Morning]] temple complex to the east of Beregost's center. Further away stood a ruined shell of an old castle atop a hill of what used to be the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]]. The [[Wizards' Doom Creek]] rivulet streamed off the ruined school's hill and towards the coast, across the Coast Way.

==Geography==
Beregost stood 200 miles away from the border of [[Amn]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] on the part of the [[Trade Way]] known as the [[Coast Way]]. The library fortress of [[Candlekeep]] was Beregost's western neighbor, separated from the Trade Way by the [[Way of the Lion]] that started not far north of the town's edge, about a day's journey on horseback.

One of the more troubling neighboring settlements was the [[Upperdark]] colony of [[illithid]]s – [[Tellectus]], not far from Beregost. However, it was abandoned after an adventurers' raid sometime before [[1370 DR]].

==Government==
In 1368 DR while Beregost's official government was a five-person town council, in reality, the town was run by the governor, [[Kelddath Ormlyr]], who is also the high [[priest]] of Song of the Morning a major temple to [[Lathander]].

The town's temple strictly controlled the expansion of Beregost. It was allowed to grow towards the coastline, away from the ruined school of magic. Throughout the years, rich Amnian families attempted to claim lands around Beregost to strategically place their mercantile operations on the Coast Way.

Beregost owed its independence to historically pleasing any neighbors with big enough armies. If occupied, the town simply waited for the occupants to destroy themselves with time through internal struggles or via battles with other rivals who wanted to claim Beregost as their own.

==Trade==
Beregost was considered a trade settlement, but it received a healthy dose of caravaners and adventurers who helmed caravans to the south – into Amn, [[Tethyr]], and [[Calimshan]].

An especially pleasant blend of [[pipeweed]] was produced in Beregost. [[Sheep]] were let graze the pastures to the west of the town. Other forms of farming were encouraged by the town's government, as well as starting new businesses.

==Defenses==
The town was policed by the guards from the temple – two hundred men-at-arms,

==History==
Beregost began as a small farming village, established some time after the {{YearlinkName|1026}} to support the school of magic run by the [[wizard]] [[Ulcaster]], on the opposite side of the [[Coast Way]]. Tales of [[ghost]]s that haunted the school's ruins caused the town to develop further on the west side of the Coast Way, leaving the hills east open for livestock.

Despite the loss of the school and the worldly travelers it could bring, the settlement of Beregost thrived, growing into a large town and an important trading center.

The {{YearlinkName|1345}} brought an epidemic of the [[Coast Plague]] to Beregost. The [[disease]] was brought to the town via a caravan from [[Murann]], [[Athkatla]], [[Purskul]], or [[Crimmor]] where it ended lives of twenty percent of population.

''Circa'' [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, a malicious merchant named [[Shairksah]] of Beregost crated deadly magical crab-like beasts to threaten his rivals with. Previously, Shairksah's crab monstrosities were used to wreak havoc in Amn, resulting in his banishment from the merchant nation.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] traveled to Beregost where he owned a house under the alias of unsightly [[pox]]-scarred Aldhan. On [[Kythorn 14]], while in Beregost, the [[archmage]] passed the famed ''[[Paalar's Artbook]]'' to a traveling sage [[Ryssik Fharval]], secretly the infamous [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

==Rumors & Legends==
*A magical ''[[gate]]'' connected Beregost to the [[Heralds' Hall]] of [[Swordsmere]]. The location of the gate was known only to the members of the [[Heralds of Faerûn]].
*Beregost's locals feared the ruins of Ulcaster School of Wizardry. It was rumored to be inhabited by restless phantoms of its magic-wielding inhabitants. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] mentioned the ghosts in one of his guidebooks, stating the creature was a [[wizshade]]. Other dangers such as [[trap]]s and ''gates'' that led to part unknown were also present.
