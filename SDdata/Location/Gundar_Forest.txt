The '''Gundar Forest''' was found in [[Estagund]] in the [[Shining Lands]].

==Geography==
The forest lay in the southeast corner of Estagund parallel with the shore of the [[Great Sea]]. The [[River Gundar]] blocked the forest's encroachment in the east and an unnamed road hemmed the forest to the north and west.
