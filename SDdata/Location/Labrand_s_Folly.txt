'''Labrand's Folly''' was a massive subterranean waterway found in the [[Middledark]] beneath the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Geography==
The waterway reached from the tip of [[Cape Talath]] to the [[Thingulph]] in [[Thindol]], covering a distance of approximately {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} underground.

==Description==
Air shafts that reached to the surface were found along the entire length of the passage.

==History==
The waterway was named for its creator, the [[Halruaan]] [[wizard]] [[Labrand]]. In [[336 DR]] Labrand used a powerful [[artifact]] called the [[Crown of the Mountain]] to carve the subterranean complex. It remained unclear as to what Labrand intended with the tunnel's creation, but many speculated he tried to create a shortcut for trade to pass through without having to sail around the entire Chultan Peninsula. If that was the case then Labrand failed miserably since fierce tides raged through the tunnel because of the air shafts, making it impossible for ships to navigate.

==Inhabitants==
A city-state of [[Kuo-toa]] called [[Gathgoolgapool]] was found along Labrand's Folly.
