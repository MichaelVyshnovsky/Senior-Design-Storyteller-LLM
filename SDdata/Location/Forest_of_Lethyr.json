        "History": "The forest was once connected to the Rawlinswood, and together they were known as the [[Riildath]]. The Riildath was home to the [[elven]] realm of [[Lethyr]] until the fair folk were driven into the southern half by the men who would go on to found the [[Narfell|Empire of Narfell]].<ref> The [[Great Glacier]]'s expansion down a valley within its woods split the forest into two and the trees never regrew after the ice retreated back to the north.<ref>\n\nThe Forest of Lethyr, as it came to be known, saw very little settlement for many centuries afterward, though its southern reaches were extensively logged. In [[1371 DR]], however, after being forced out of the Rawlinswood by the [[Rotting Man]], the [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s of the [[Circle of Leth]] took up residence in [[Yeshelmaar]] to defend the forest from outside threats.",
