        "mainbody": "The Shimmerglade was a rocky clearing located within a small copse of pine trees found on the banks of the Icehilt River in Impiltur. The rough basin within the forest marked the location of a famous battle between the Old Sage Elminster Aumar and a group of malaugrym, and had since been magically warded by one of the former magisters of Mystra.\nThe Shimmerglade featured a wide, unnaturally formed crater, surrounded by a scattering of pine trees, many of which were stunted in their growth. The stony basin was the site of a large dead-magic zone that was surrounded by a series of wandering patches of wild magic energy, which appeared to shimmer and ripple through the air.\nA few winters before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, the \"Reborn\" Noum√©a Drathchuld placed an arcane warning over the site, comprising seven floating silver stars in the shape of a hook. When any intelligent creature appeared, it spoke in a firm but gentle tone\nSome sages and experts of arcane lore believed the Shimmerglade held a cache of great magic stowed away by the malaugrym. It was rumored that the legendary artstave of Alithar of ancient Netheril was among the magical items and artifacts stored within the hidden treasure trove. \nMany years before the second death of Mystra, the shadowmaster Ultharos and a handful of their kin lured Elminster to the Shimmerglade in an attempt to murder him. The wise old mage defeated the malevolent shapeshifters in a grand display that forever altered the magical and natural landscape of the region."
