The rough basin within the forest marked the location of a famous battle between the Old Sage [[Elminster Aumar]] and a group of [[malaugrym]], and had since been [[magic]]ally warded by one of the former [[magister]]s of [[Mystra]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}",

            "Rumors": "Some [[sage]]s and experts of arcane lore believed the Shimmerglade held a cache of great magic stowed away by the malaugrym. It was rumored that the legendary ''[[artstave of Alithar]]'' of ancient [[Netheril]] was among the [[Item enchantment|magical]] items and [[artifact]]s stored within the hidden treasure trove."

        "History": "Many years before the [[Spellplague|second death of Mystra]], the shadowmaster [[Ultharos]] and a handful of their kin lured Elminster to the Shimmerglade in an attempt to murder him. The wise old mage defeated the malevolent shapeshifters in a grand display that forever altered the magical and natural landscape of the region."
