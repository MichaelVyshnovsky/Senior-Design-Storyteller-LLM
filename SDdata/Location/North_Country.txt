The '''North Country''' of [[Rashemen]] was the northernmost region of the magocratic nation, isolated from its larger towns and fishing villages.

==Description==
Despite the clear distinction between the two, the region was not so different from the [[Central Plains]] to the south.

==Geography==
It composed over half of Rashemen's overall geographical territory, incorporating a stretch of the [[Endless Wastes]] and the stretch of land just south of the [[Icerim Mountains]].

===Geographical Features===
The region was dotted with ancient ruins originating from ancient [[Raumathar]] and [[Narfell]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Speaking to most [[Rashemaar]] people, outlanders might believe that the North Country was an entirely separate country from the Central Plains.

Local legends spoke of brave Rashemaar nobles that ventured into the region's ruins and returned with fantastic riches and even [[item enchantment|magical]] items.

==Inhabitants==
Not many Rashemaar lived in the North Country by choice, those doing so banded together in scattered farmsteads that were invariably formed around the local ruins.
