        "mainbody": "'''Phandalin''' was a village in the [[Sword Coast North]] It was raided by [[orc]]s in [[951 DR]] and subsequently abandoned. It was eventually resettled in the late 15{{th}} century as a frontier settlement of farmers and prospectors.",
        "Description": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Phandalin was a modest and architecturally boring town of hard-working frontiersfolk built atop the ruins of the old Phandalin. The town quickly grew to about fifty well-maintained structures built of logs and flagstones with three deep wells providing water. The town was dominated by an [[apple]] [[Edermath Orchard|orchard]] on the west side and a ruined [[Tresendar Manor|manor]] atop a hill to the east. The townsfolk would congregate in a small town square and an adjacent town green.",
        "Geography": "Phandalin was located in the [[Lost Hills]] of the [[Sword Mountains]] south of [[Neverwinter Wood]]. It was northeast of [[Leilon]] where the road that ran from the [[High Road]] to [[Triboar]] faded into a [[Triboar Trail|trail]]. This was a region rich with both natural resources and adventuring opportunities.\n\nThe climate was temperate, with an average yearly rainfall of {{SI|18|inches|c|long=yes}}. [[Icespire Peak]] was visible from the town on clear days.",
        "Government": "When Phandalin was reestablished in the late 15{{th}} century DR, at first it had no real functioning government, and the [[Phandalin Miner's Exchange]] began acting as a center of records-keeping for local mining claims. The townsfolk also annually elected a \"Townmaster\" who served as a judge and mediator as well as kept town records. In [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} [[Harbin Wester]] was the perennial Townmaster.\n\nAfter diminished faith in the abilities of a single Townmaster to address threats to the village during the early 1490s DR, the townsfolk instead elected a three-member [[Town Council of Phandalin|Town Council]],{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|6}} originally consisting of Harbin Wester, [[Sildar Hallwinter]], and [[Trilena Stonehill]]. Trilena was eventually replaced by [[Halia Thornton]], who subsequently disappeared. As of [[1496 DR]],{{AI-time}} the townsfolk moved to expand the council from three to five and additionally to elect a mayor.",
        "Trade": "Phandalin was adjacent to land which was good for farming and ranching, and was near enough to Neverwinter Wood to support a woodcutting and logging industry. Most of the wealth, however, was from mining in the nearby Sword Mountains for [[gold]], [[platinum]], ore, timber, skins, and [[cold iron]].",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "Phandalin was originally a farming community It became a member of [[Phandelver's Pact]] ''circa'' the 10{{th}} century DR, giving the town access to the [[Forge of Spells]] and the mining operations in [[Wave Echo Cave]]. By the {{YearlinkName|950}}, Phandalin boasted a large and prospering community of [[human]]s, [[gnome]]s, and [[dwarves]], and thanks to the wonders brought about by the Forge of Spells and Phandelver's Pact, they aspired to eclipse nearby [[Neverwinter]] as a beacon of civilization on the Sword Coast North. The town's cooperative nature was highlighted in the writings of then-mayor [[Mayor Alderleaf|Alderleaf]], entitled ''[[The Wonders of Phandalin]]''.\n\nAt that same time, the nearby orc realm of [[Uruth Ukrypt]] had exhausted their food supply from over-hunting, and so began to raid settlements in the area for supplies. Phandalin was one of these settlements, and in the {{YearlinkName|951}}, it was overrun and then abandoned.\n\nThe town remained abandoned for centuries, with no inhabitants save for monsters and the occasional passing [[ranger]] making camp in one of the more secure structures.",
            "First Resettlement": "By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Phandalin was notable as one of the better preserved ruins along the [[Sword Coast]]. Visitors were cautioned that although the town's three wells still contained water, one was tainted with an undetectable toxin that was fatal to all but orcs and [[half-orc]]s.\n\nThe town was resettled some years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. The small village was a struggling hard-working community, with its most notable resource being mined in the nearby cold iron mines. The industrious man named [[Danley]] assembled a group of tough veterans of the [[Shadow War]] to clean the cold iron mines of their monstrous humanoid inhabitants and resume the cold iron production. The plan came to a halt when two representatives of the so-called \"[[Cold Mining Company]]\" arrived in Phandalin and declared ownership of the mines, and cleared out orcs and other creatures who infested it. Danley's suspicions were peaked as something was wrong about these claims. He suspected the [[Black Network]] or some nearby nation. The \"Mining Company\" refused to employ people of Phandalin and sold the cold iron to some unknown source, never merchant caravans that passed the village. Danley allied with a group of mercenaries who worked for the merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]] to investigate the mines. [[Daniel Merriwether]] and [[Chester Paulson]], the leaders of the operations, were revealed to be magically disguised [[oni mage]]s [[Radbur]] and [[Gromcheck]] and miners â€“ disguised orcs and [[bugbear]]s. The \"Cold Mining Company\" was subsequently closed and claimed by Danley and the folk of Phandalin.",
            "Second Resettlement": "Following the [[Spellplague]], Phandalin once again was in ruins. Beginning around the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, settlers from Neverwinter and [[Waterdeep]] began resettling the ruins of Phandalin once again, and the rebuilt town was well-established by the {{YearlinkName|1491}}.\n\nAround this time, two challenges befell the town. One was a group of bandits known as the [[Redbrands]], or the Redbrand Ruffians, who settled in Phandalin, making their lair under [[Tresendar Manor]]. They committed several terrible acts, such as racketing local businesses, kidnapping over a dozen travelers to sell into slavery, killing the woodcarver [[Thel Dendrar]] for his defiance, and later kidnapping his family. The other challenge was the appearance of [[Cryovain]], a [[white dragon]] who claimed [[Icespire Hold]] as his lair and the region around Phandalin as his territory. The dragon terrorized the town and its neighbors, and further displaced orcs and monsters from of the Sword Mountains who likewise threatened Phandalin's safety. Unimpressed with how the townmaster, Harbin Wester, handled these challenges, the townsfolk restructured their government to include a three-person town council.\n\nSoon after, [[Volothamp Geddarm]] passed through the town and wrote about it in his book, ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]'', causing the area to experience an influx of tourists and adventurers. This led a boom in the town's tourism industry, leading to an explosion of competition between the town's inns and taverns. The influx of tourists not only brought more business into Phandalin, but also led to increased incidents of visiting nobles and hapless thrill-seekers landing themselves in danger with local monsters.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|5}} The town's newfound popularity coincided with the appearance of [[Gavmogon]], a [[beholder]] with access to [[Hollow of dominion|a powerful artifact]] that allowed him to spread madness in the region.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|49}}\n\nOver the next few years, much of the mineral wealth that was expected to flow into Phandalin failed to materialize. The town could go for months with no new income from the mining operations, and efforts to open the ancient mine at Wave Echo Cave were abandoned.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1496}}, the town held its first mayoral election since its resettlement, with Harbin Wester and Sildar Hallwinter competing for the office. At issue in the election were things like the role of [[adventurer]]s in the town's safety&mdash;exacerbated by the arrival of a franchise of the [[Acquisitions Incorporated]] [[adventuring company]]&mdash;and what to do about an unusually intelligent [[ogre]] named [[Stuuzant]] who had begun attacking local livestock."

        "Notable Locations": "[[File:Phandalin.jpg|thumb|300px|''A map of the town ''circa'' 1491 DR.'']]\n;Inns and Taverns\n* [[Stonehill Inn]]: A modest inn that was run by a short, friendly young human man named [[Toblen Stonehill]]. Toblen came from the east of Triboar, seeking opportunity in prospecting like many others. He soon found that he knew more about running an inn than mining, and so he established the inn.\n* The [[Sleeping Giant]]: A rundown, dirty, and dangerous watering hole. It was known for being frequented by a bandit group, the [[Redbrands]]. It was operated by a surly female [[dwarf]] named [[Grista]].\n* [[Danley and Sons Inn]]: The only inn when the town was briefly resettled in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n\n;Shops and Businesses\n* [[Barthen's Provisions]]: The biggest trading post in Phandalin, which stayed open from sunup to sundown. It was run by a lean and balding, middle-aged man with a kindly manner, [[Elmar Barthen]].\n* [[Edermath Orchard]]: An orchard field with the simple cottage of a silver-haired [[half-elf]] named [[Daran Edermath]]. Daran was a retired marshal in the lands of the [[Dragon Coast]]. When he retired, he returned to the Neverwinter region, which was his original home, to grow apples and make [[cider]].\n* [[Lionshield Coster (Phandalin)|Lionshield Coster]]: A weapons and armor supplier owned by the [[Lionshield Coster]]. The master of this post was a sharp-tongued woman named [[Linene Graywind]],\n* [[Phandalin Miner's Exchange]]: A trading post where miners had their finds weighed and paid out. The townsmaster's records were kept here, with responsibility of no local lord. The exchange was run by the [[Zhentarim]], who attempted to slowly take control of Phandalin. Their original agent was Halia Thornton, who was eventually replaced by [[Sharna Quirstiron]].\n* The [[Smithy (Phandalin)|Smithy]]: The local blacksmith was [[Alger Frakk]], who ran this smithy with his apprentice, [[Maza Fieldsalder]].\n* The [[Woodworker (Phandalin)|Woodworker]]: A woodcarving business run by [[Thel Dendrar]] until his death in 1491 DR.\n\n;Temples and Shrines\n* [[Shrine of Luck]]: A small shrine made of stone from the ruins and Phandalin's only temple, dedicated to [[Tymora]]. It was in the care of a zealous young elf and member of the [[Harpers]], [[Garaele|Sister Garaele]].\n* [[Temple of the Coinmaiden]]: A temple that was dedicated to [[Waukeen]] in 1496 DR at the former location of Barthen's Provisions. It was managed by the aloof [[Ditch Fundi]], although the actual temple services were overseen by two acolytes, [[Hesten Jenz]] and [[Mischka Solmen]].\n* Shrine of Waukeen: A small shrine built when the town was briefly resettled in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n\n;Other Locations\n* [[Alderleaf Farm]]: A simple farm that was run by a wise female [[halfling]] named [[Qelline Alderleaf]]. She was long-time friends with the [[druid]], [[Reidoth]].\n* [[Townmaster's Hall]]: A small building that served as the seat of the town government. It also housed a small, but serviceable jail in the cellar.\n* [[Tresendar Manor]]: More of a castle than a manor, this was an ancient building that was abandoned after the orc raids of 951 DR. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the cellars&mdash;once served as a safe haven when the estate was attacked. It also served as a resting place for the deceased members of the [[Tresendar]] family&mdash;were turned into the hideout of the Redbrands. The building was later turned into a guildhall for Acquisitions Incorporated.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Phandalin was home to farmers, woodcutters, trappers, and miners."
