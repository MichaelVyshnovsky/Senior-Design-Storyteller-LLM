'''Maracrath''' was a village located in [[Impiltur]] in the [[Northeast Faerûn]], off the coast of the [[Easting Reach]].

==Geography==
Maracrath was known as one of several overnight stops for caravans that traveled along the [[Merchant's Run]], part of the [[Herald's Road]] that stretched between Impiltur and the [[Cold Lands]]. [[Cairnpur]] was the first caravan stop northwest of [[Ilmwatch]], west of [[Even's Gulf]], the northernmost part of the Easting Reach, followed by Maracrath. The next stop northwest along the Merchant's Run was the settlement of [[Guidodale]], which stood on a crossroad where the road from [[Timbertown]] joined Merchant's Run.

==Defenses==
Maracrath received protection from Ilmwatch's garrison contingents that traveled with merchant caravans between the Cold Lands and the Easting Reach.
