Maracrath was a village located in Impiltur in the Northeast Faer√ªn, off the coast of the Easting Reach.
Maracrath was known as one of several overnight stops for caravans that traveled along the Merchants Run, part of the Heralds Road that stretched between Impiltur and the Cold Lands. Cairnpur was the first caravan stop northwest of Ilmwatch, west of Evens Gulf, the northernmost part of the Easting Reach, followed by Maracrath. The next stop northwest along the Merchants Run was the settlement of Guidodale, which stood on a crossroad where the road from Timbertown joined Merchants Run.
Maracrath received protection from Ilmwatchs garrison contingents that traveled with merchant caravans between the Cold Lands and the Easting Reach.
