It was highly prized for the valuable minerals that lay within the Gorge of Gauros and Sunrise Mountains, and was the site of several battles between the tharchs elite legions, and the forces of nearby Rashemen.\nThe people of Gauros maintained a particular hatred for the Rashemi people, more so than the rest of Thay.\n*Gorge of Gauros\n*River Gauros\nThe Rashemi and Thayan people fought many battles within the tharch of Gauros.\nOn Mirtul 5 1375 DR, Tharchioness Azhir Kren and Tharchion Homen Odesseiron led an ill-fated invasion of Rashemen, that was halted when they were ambushed by Rashemi warriors and witches at the location where the River Gauros crossed the gorge. The Thayan legions faced certain defeat until they were rescued at precisely the right time by the zulkir of necromancy, Szass Tam. In fact, the lich had orchestrated the ambush, interceded as the missions savior and spun the event in the court of public opinion in an effort to gain favor among the Thayan people. \nFollowing Szass Tams withdrawal from the Council of Zulkirs in Mirtul the same year, the legions of Gauros, along with those from Surthay, were among the first to align with the powerful necromancer."
