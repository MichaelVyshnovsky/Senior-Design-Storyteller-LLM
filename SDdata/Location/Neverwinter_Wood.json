            "Geographical Features": "[[File:Neverwinter and vicinity.png|thumb|right|250px|''The map of [[Neverwinter]], Neverwinter Wood, and the [[High Road]].'']]\nThe western region of the Neverwinter Wood was known as the Watcher's Forest, so named for its sacredness amongst the [[Helmite]] priests of the region. It was tended to by his devout followers that lived in [[Helm's Hold]], and even held an entranceway into the subterranean [[Crypts of the Vigilant Eye]].\n\nThe [[Neverwinter River]] ran through an area of the forests. Notable hills and mountains within included [[Berun's Hill]] and [[the Crags]], within which lay the famous [[Mount Hotenow]].<ref>",
            "Flora & Fauna": "Abundant [[whitethistle]] shrubbery grew throughout the Neverwinter Wood. If consumed, the plant was known to give someone the runs. [[Shederran]] were a highly valuable species of trees found only within Neverwinter Wood. They were highly sought after for their use in crafting the highest quality [[bow]]s and [[crossbow]]s."

        "History": "[[File:Neverwinter Wood Drizzl.png|thumb|''Neverwinter River flowing through the Neverwinter Wood.'']]\nThis forest was originally called ''Llewyrrwood'' by the elves of the region, and it came to be a colony for those fair folk of [[Illefarn]]. When [[Aryvandaar]] annexed both Illefarn and the Llewyrrwood in {{Yearlink|-9900}}, many of the residents fled to [[Shantel Othreier]]. Some stayed for a century, living under the yoke of the [[Vyshantaar]] until the queen of the [[Llewyrr]], [[Synnoria (elf)|Synnoria]], led a large force of her people out of their lands and across the [[Trackless Sea]] to the [[Moonshae Isles]], where they established the kingdom of [[Synnoria]] in her honor.\n\nThe Llewyrrwood was occupied once more when the realm of Illefarn was reformed. Circa {{Yearlink|-1100}}, the last [[Coronal]] of Illefarn, [[Syglaeth Audark]], decided to take his people to [[Evermeet]].\n\nAgain, some chose to remain in the Llewyrrwood, and formed the realm of [[Iliyanbruen]]. The elven realm of Illiyanbruen persisted until [[177 DR]] when the last of its [[moon elves]] traveled to Evermeet and [[Ardeep]] in [[Faerûn]],<ref> or left for the [[Feywild]] to form the colony of [[New Sharandar (Feywild)|New Sharandar]].\n\nAs of [[1374 DR]], elves still lived in the wood, though they made up one of the largest cells of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], with other smaller cells operating in the surrounding area.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Neverwinter Wood experienced a mass migration of [[fey]] from the Feywild. Elves and [[fey eladrin|eladrin]] were also drawn to the woods in large numbers and they attempted to re-found Iliyanbruen near the ruins of [[Sharandar|Old Sharandar]]. Though they had to defeat a force of [[dark fey]] to reclaim their ancestral home, they quickly went about establishing the military outpost of [[New Sharandar (Faerûn)|New Sharandar]],<ref name=NCS-p126> around the ''[[Fey Crossing]]'' connected to the greater settlement of the same name in Feywild.\n\nFollowing the rise of [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] as Lord of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the [[wood elves]] of Neverwinter Wood questioned his legitimacy, and in retaliation he ordered clear cutting of the Wood and executions of elves and their allies among the [[Emerald Enclave]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was said that Helm himself spent a single day in the western stretch of the forest during the [[Time of Troubles]], meditating upon his guardianship of the [[Celestial Stairway]].",
