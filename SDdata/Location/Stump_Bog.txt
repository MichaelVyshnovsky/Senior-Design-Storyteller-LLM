The Stump Bog was a bog to the east of the hamlet of Rassalantar.
The foul mire was located just south of Goldenfields, and its waters were fed from the River Dessarin.
A wide variety of monstrously sized animals could be found in this bog, including giant crabs, giant crayfish, giant eels, giant frogs, giant leeches, giant lizards, and giant wasps,
More abnormal creatures to be found in this bog included catoblepas, gas spores, shambling mounds, will-o-wisps, mudmen, and various undead creatures when the sun went down.
Stump Bog was named after the many rotting stumps rising out of the green algae-covered waters.
Over the many years of bloodshed in the North a great deal of bodies were dumped into this dark bog. And many wounded victims of such battles lost themselves in it, fell into its muddy ground, and drowned. Over time it became a popular and convenient site for killers, thieves, and dishonest Waterdhavians to dispose of bodies.
In 1026 DR, after having carried out massive raids on Waterdeep, the orc tribe Black Claw met their defeat here at the hands of Raurlor.
There were many rumors of buried treasure in its murky waters, but fortune hunters needed to beware the many creatures that haunted the dark marsh.
