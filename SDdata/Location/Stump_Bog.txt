The '''Stump Bog''' was a bog to the east of the hamlet of [[Rassalantar]].{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep|14}}

==Geography==
The foul mire was located just south of [[Goldenfields]], and its waters were fed from the [[River Dessarin]].
===Flora & Fauna===
A wide variety of monstrously sized animals could be found in this bog, including [[giant crab]]s, [[giant crayfish]], [[giant eel]]s, [[giant frog]]s, [[giant leech]]es, [[giant lizard]]s, and [[giant wasp]]s,

More abnormal creatures to be found in this bog included [[catoblepas]], [[gas spore]]s, [[shambling mound]]s, [[will-o'-wisp]]s, [[mudmen]], and various [[undead]] creatures when the sun went down.

==History==
Stump Bog was named after the many rotting stumps rising out of the green algae-covered waters.

Over the many years of bloodshed in [[the North]] a great deal of bodies were dumped into this dark bog. And many wounded victims of such battles lost themselves in it, fell into its muddy ground, and drowned. Over time it became a popular and convenient site for killers, [[thieves]], and dishonest [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavians]] to dispose of bodies.

In [[1026 DR]], after having carried out massive raids on Waterdeep, the [[orc]] tribe [[Black Claw]] met their defeat here at the hands of [[Raurlor]].

==Rumors & Legends==
There were many rumors of buried treasure in its murky waters, but fortune hunters needed to beware the many creatures that haunted the dark marsh.
