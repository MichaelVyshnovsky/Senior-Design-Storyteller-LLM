        "mainbody": "Lilinuk was the largest settlement on the Great Glacier.\nLilinuk was located on a plateau south of the Nakalpgotak Sea, about 150 feet (46 meters) above the shore,\nAccess to the village was afforded by a series of ramps of ice that spiraled up to the top of the plateau on which the village was built. North of the plateau, at the shore of the sea within a bay, the village maintained a small fleet of kayaks and larger umiaks. Pens made of ice blocks held herds of caribou and muskoxen for food.\nEverything in Lilinuk was meticulously kept in good condition. Even snowhouses were rebuilt every year. The villagers stored a years worth of food in pits in the ice. Even the dogs and kupuk lived in relative luxury, having their own snowhouses, called jititip, in which to live.\nThe center of the village was a large area with space dedicated for the yearly sukkiruchit festival. It included five communal feasting houses (quaggi) and a large two-domed rewqugi, where visitors could warm themselves by fire.\nLike most large Iulutiun villages, Lilinuk was advised by a village council, or iquemelum.\nLilinuk was famous for the quality of its clothing, kayaks, and dog sleds, and its people were excited to trade. It was also one of the two settlements&mdashthe other being Jukum&mdashwhere the annual sukkiruchit trade fair took place. This festival attracted craftsmen and hunters from all over Alpuk. A typical sukkiruchit would gather over a thousand attendees.\nIn the Year of the Great Flood, year 1790 of the Ulutiun calendar, which corresponds to , a warm summer caused the water levels of the Nakalpgotak Sea to rise, flooding the villages around its shoreline.  Lilinuk, however, was spared, since it was built atop the high plateau.\nAround , a group of citizens of Lilinuk were exiled for plotting to murder the iquemelum. These exiles joined together with similarly banished Angulutiuns from the east and formed the village of Eghagu.\nAround , hunters from Lilinuk discovered the journal of an explorer whose body had been magically turned to ice. The journal described a hidden castle within Mount Okk in the Lugsaas Chain. This castle was supposedly the headquarters of a cabal of evil wizards from Vaasa who were trying to develop new spells of great power and failed.\nLilinuk had a population of about one and a half thousand in . Its people were hard-working and perhaps the most industrious people of the Great Glacier.\nLuftuk was the shrewdest trader of the village, and in , he was the one responsible for organizing the sukkiruchit.\nCategoryVillages\nCategorySmall towns\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryHuman locations\nCategoryLocations in Alpuk\nCategoryLocations on the Great Glacier\nCategoryLocations in Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n0sxwb5vme9shhe6dh96e8kqesoywlhy"
