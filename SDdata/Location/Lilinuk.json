        "mainbody": "'''Lilinuk''' was the largest settlement on the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Geography": "Lilinuk was located on a plateau south of the [[Nakalpgotak Sea]], about 150 feet (46 meters) above the shore,",
        "Description": "Access to the village was afforded by a series of ramps of ice that spiraled up to the top of the plateau on which the village was built. North of the plateau, at the shore of the sea within a bay, the village maintained a small fleet of kayaks and larger [[umiak]]s. Pens made of ice blocks held herds of [[caribou]] and muskoxen for food.\n\nEverything in Lilinuk was meticulously kept in good condition. Even [[snowhouse]]s were rebuilt every year. The villagers stored a year's worth of food in pits in the ice. Even the dogs and [[kupuk]] lived in relative luxury, having their own snowhouses, called ''jititip'', in which to live.\n\nThe center of the village was a large area with space dedicated for the yearly [[Ulutiun dictionary#S|''sukkiruchit'']] festival. It included five communal feasting houses ([[quaggi]]) and a large two-domed [[Ulutiun dictionary#R|''rewqugi'']], where visitors could warm themselves by fire.",
        "Government": "Like most large Iulutiun villages, Lilinuk was advised by a village council, or [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''iquemelum'']].",
        "Trade": "Lilinuk was famous for the quality of its clothing, [[kayak]]s, and dog sleds, and its people were excited to trade. It was also one of the two settlements&mdash;the other being [[Jukum]]&mdash;where the annual ''sukkiruchit'' trade fair took place. This festival attracted craftsmen and hunters from all over [[Alpuk]]. A typical ''sukkiruchit'' would gather over a thousand attendees.",
        "History": "In the Year of the Great Flood, year 1790 of the [[Ulutiun calendar]], which corresponds to {{Yearlink|-760}}, a warm summer caused the water levels of the Nakalpgotak Sea to rise, flooding the villages around its shoreline.  Lilinuk, however, was spared, since it was built atop the high plateau.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|1260}}, a group of citizens of Lilinuk were exiled for plotting to murder the ''iquemelum''. These exiles joined together with similarly banished [[Angulutiun]]s from the east and formed the village of [[Eghagu]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Around {{Yearlink|1340}}, hunters from Lilinuk discovered the journal of an explorer whose body had been magically turned to ice. The journal described a hidden [[Ice Castle|castle]] within [[Mount Okk]] in the [[Lugsaas Chain]]. This castle was supposedly the headquarters of a cabal of evil [[wizard]]s from [[Vaasa]] who were trying to develop new spells of great power and failed.",
        "Inhabitants": "Lilinuk had a population of about one and a half thousand in {{Yearlink|1359}}. Its people were hard-working and perhaps the most industrious people of the Great Glacier.\n\n[[Luftuk]] was the shrewdest trader of the village, and in {{Yearlink|1359}}, he was the one responsible for organizing the ''sukkiruchit''.",
