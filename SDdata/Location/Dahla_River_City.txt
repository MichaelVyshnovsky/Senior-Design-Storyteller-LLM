'''Dahla River City''' was a quiet waterfront village in ancient [[Netheril]].

==Geography==
The town was located east of the [[Shinantra Mountains]] and south of the [[Hidden Forest]], at the point where the [[Dahla River]] entered the western [[Hidden Lake]]. Its closest neighbors were [[Trinity]] to the south and [[Hoyden]] to the north.

==History==
The village was first settled in {{yearlinkConvert|3365|NY}}. The pioneers cleared the area south of town to plant crops and build ranches, and led quiet, isolated lives. In {{yearlinkConvert|3456|NY}}, the [[Dahla River]] flooded and almost destroyed the town, leading to the construction of the nearby [[Whitewater Bridge]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3465|NY}}.

The isolation of Dahla River City was such that their first indication that something was amiss in Netheril was a sudden [[phaerimm]] attack in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}, which destroyed the village. The few survivors fled south into the new wastelands of Netheril, witnessing the aftermath of the battles between the [[sharn]] and phaerimm, with only a handful surviving to join the Netherese successor states thanks to the intervention of a group of [[adventurer]]s.
