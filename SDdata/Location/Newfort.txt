[[File:Newfort Map.jpg|thumb]]
'''Newfort''' was a small hamlet built atop a hill found in the [[Sundabar Vale]], within the [[Old Delzoun]] region of the [[Silver Marches]].

==Description==
The small hamlet comprised about two score wood cottages built around a small stream, built atop a small hill encircled by a wooden palisade.

==Geography==
Newfort was located approximately {{SI|15|mi|k}} east of [[Sundabar]], {{SI|3|mi|k}} south of the [[Fork Road]], in the foothills of the the [[Rauvin Mountains]].

==History==
Newfort was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, by two retired members of the [[Zhentarim]] named [[Trevis Uhl]] and [[Gyreth Ilgarn]]. Trevis took it upon himself to serve as the town's first mayor while Gyreth served as its constable.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Newfort and the settlements of [[Jalanthar]] and [[Quaevarr]] were all terrorized by the [[barlgura]] [[Scauuont]], all within the span of a single week.

By the time of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Newfort had become a way station welcoming any travelers to stay the night in safety.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Hero's Reward]], a cozy tavern that stayed in the town for over a century.
* [[Narm's Exchange]], a trading post owned by the [[Half-orc]] [[Deliyra Narm]].
* Shrine of [[Tempus]], the [[Tempuran]] shrine erected by the bull-headed, ex-[[Zhent]] priest [[Nargroth]].
* Stauvin's Mill, a successful millhouse run by [[Stauvin Stonebrace]], the landowner atop whose land Newfort was originally built.

==Inhabitants==
Because Newfort's founders both had a strong affiliation with the [[Zhentil Keep|Zhent]] armies of the [[Moonsea]], it attracted many people that fled the region following the rise to power of the [[Zhentarim]].

===Notable Inhabitants===
;14{{th}} Century:
* [[Trevis Uhl]], Newfort's first mayor.
* [[Stauvin Stonebrace]], a man considered to be the richest in all of Newfort.

;15{{th}} Century:
* [[Delf Dereldar]], [[half-elf]] tavern owner.
* [[Jorok Narm]], [[half-orc]] constable.
