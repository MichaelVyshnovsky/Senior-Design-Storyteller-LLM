}}The '''Akhlaur Swamp''', also called the '''Swamp of Ghalagar''', was a wetland located west of [[Lake Halruaa]] and [[Halagard]].

==Description==
{{Climate/Shining South/Forest and marsh}}
The swamp covered, as of [[1373 DR]], an oblong area roughly 4000 square miles (6437.3 sq km.). The Swamp of Akhlaur was filled with cypress trees, moss and assortment of fauna including crocodiles and dangerous piranha. Unnatural creatures such as [[undead]] were also present.

[[Laraken]] also inhabited the swamp, making this a dangerous location for any spellcaster.

==History==
The swamp was named for the famed [[conjurer]] [[Akhlaur]]. It was believed he perished here when he was taken to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] by a summoned laraken. The [[portal]] through which he disappeared remained open, allowing a constant flow of water to expand the swamp at a rate of an additional 100 ft. (30 m) per year. [[Akhlaur's Tower]] remained long after his passing.

In 1373 DR, the [[halruaan magehound|magehound]] [[Kiva]] managed to remove the portal from the swamp, successfully halting its advance.

In [[1385 DR]], the south of Halruaa was flooded because of the catastrophic [[Spellplague]], connecting the swamp with the [[Great Sea]].
