        "Name": "The name 'Kryptgarden' arose from the dwarfhold known as [[Southkrypt Garden]], which stood in the north. The forest was itself sometimes called '''Southkrypt Garden'''.

            "Geographical Features": "A portion of Kryptgarden south of [[Phandalin]] was known as the '''Crooked Forest''' because some of the trees there had been bent by ancient creatures that dwelled there to indicate paths through the forest. Following the passage of [[Volothamp Geddarm]] through the area, the forest received more visitors than it had in decades, disturbing a number of [[treant]]s and [[blight]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|?}}\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves - Kryptgarden Forest orifice.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Underdark orifice.

            "Flora & Fauna": "Small game animals lived in the forest, but few larger creatures dwelled within, as they were readily eaten by Kryptgarden's most fearsome predator, the dragon Claugiyliamatar."

        "Activities": "Folk from [[Westbridge]] hunted animals along the eastern edges of the forest during the 1300s [[DR]], but did not dare go deeper than a few hours on foot.

        "History": "During the era of the [[First Flowering]], the forest that later came to be known as Kryptgarden was a part of the ancient [[elven]] realm of [[Illefarn]], which was founded ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-22900}}.

        "Rumors & Legends": "Kryptgarden Forest was reputed to be one of the sources of the evil that lurked in the ruined dwarfhold of Southkrypt, and only the second most powerful of them after the Sword Mountains.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1300s DR, rumors swirled of another dwarven citadel in the hills at the heart of Kryptgarden, but these were unconfirmed.\n\nAt that time, a crazed adventurer was discovered in the plains west of [[Red Larch]], on [[Kheldell Path]]. Supposedly the only survivor of a nine-person [[adventuring company]], he rambled on about a strange citadel in Kryptgarden, one that housed insectoid creatures that walked upright, wielded powerful magic, threw weapons that slew a man at 500 paces, and could camouflage themselves so well they could only be detected by smell and tracking, suggesting it was a supernatural power. Moreover, he had unexplainable burns on his arms and back and had no possessions on him. However, this man was a known to be a lair by [[1370 DR]].\n\nIn the 1300s DR, King Witchthorn had a relationship with the [[Adarbrent]] noble family of [[Waterdeep]]. For decades, the family sent its firstborn child of each generation to pledge an oath to Witchthorn. The children performed an unknown service to the king by their eleventh year and in exchange the family businesses and their homes were protected by secret [[fey]] guardians. This arrangement was unknown to all but the eldest son and daughter of each generation."
