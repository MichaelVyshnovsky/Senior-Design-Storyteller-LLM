"Heaven" was often a byword for the Celestial Empire itself, or for the Celestial Emperor.Discussion of the Celestial Empire and its associated Bureaucracy in Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms mentions that it is based in a realm called "Heaven" or the "Celestial Heavens". Players Guide to Faer√ªn page 165 confirms the Celestial Bureaucracy is based in the plane of the Spirit World. Taken together, these imply that Heaven is a realm in the Spirit World. The Spirit World covers all of the continent of Kara-Tur, as does the sphere of influence of the Celestial Empire, suggesting that Heaven and the Spirit World are coterminous, even one and the same.

The Moon Women of the Lesser Immortals had the great responsibility of maintaining Heaven itself. They refilled the oil lamps in the Sun, polished the crystal orbs of the stars, and steered the motions of the Moon and the constellations. The Ladies of Compassion roamed Heaven to find and alleviate pain and suffering.
