        "Government": "Each port was an independent and self-ruling state, rival to each other but able to cooperate when was needed.",
        "Background": "Tarmalune was the most important city in the Windrise Ports, although it was not very welcoming to outsiders if those individuals were slaves or didn't had enough money to live in a city were money was so important as it was in Tarmalune.\n\nWhereas the other Windrise Ports, although each an independent city, different to each other and with its own feel and character, were all united by three common goals—the pursuit of wealth, their tolerance of outsiders, which the leaders believed was good for commerce; and their disdain for Tarmalune’s prominence.\n\nLikewise, all cities of the Windrise Ports were rivals of those of the [[Dusk Ports]], not only because those cities were also trade ports, and therefore commercial rivals, but also because the Dusk Ports employed [[pirate]]s, a practice frowned upon in the Windrise Ports.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|56}}",
        "Religion": "Religion was uncommon in the Windrise Ports, and the following of minor cults dedicated to the [[Dawn Titans]] or to [[dragon]]s, as well as general superstition, were more universal than worshiping one of the [[gods]], that were a novelty introduced in [[Laerakond]] since the [[Blue Breath of Change]]. Among the major cults of the area were the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]], a cult dedicated to the [[primordial]] [[Achazar]], and the [[Seekers of Scales]], a cult that worshiped [[dragon]]s in general.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|4}}\n\nHowever, thanks to their cosmopolitan nature and their trade with Faerûn, the cities of the Windrise Ports were more open to the concepts of religion and the gods than other places of Laerakond. Among the most influential religions established in the Windrise Ports were the faiths of [[Bahamut]], [[Sune]], [[Tempus]], [[Tiamat]], [[Umberlee]], [[Valkur]], [[Vergadain]], and [[Waukeen]].",
        "History": "The Windrise Ports were originally a territory dominated by the primordial Achazar long before the [[Spellplague]]. Eventually, Achazar fell into a deep sleep and never awoke again, and the Windrise Ports declared themselves free. Dragons shunned the Windrise Ports out of fear of Achazar, who slept in the form of a giant pillar of fire amid Tarmalune, allowing the Windrise Ports to grow in wealth and influence across [[Abeir]].",
