'''Telos City''', also called simply '''Telos''', was the largest and newest city in [[Vaasa]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It served as the realm's capital and the seat of power for the evil [[Warlock Knights]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}}{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|189}}

==Geography==
Telos City sat just north of the cliffs above the [[Beaumaris River]] in the central Vaasan highlands, and just south of the [[Cinnabar Wastes]]. It connected to Vaasa's main road, [[Dead Man's Walk]], via a bridge which spanned the 500 foot (150 meter) deep [[Razack's Scar]] canyon to the south.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} 

The city center was situated inside of a blast crater that was a half-mile (805 meters) across and over {{SI|800|feet|long=yes}} deep.

==Government==
The city and the surrounding realm were overseen by the [[Ironfell Council]], which was comprised of the twelve most powerful landowning Warlock Knights from across Vaasa. They were led in deliberations by the enigmatic [[Voice of Telos]], who served as the absolute ruler of the city.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|276}} The Council convened in the centrally located [[Citadel of the Iron Sky]] for five days each month to consider state matters.

==Culture==
===Social Class===
The Warlock Knights enforced a strict social and racial hierarchy with themselves at the top. Beneath the Knights were the common folk, referred to as serfs.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} Beneath the serfs were the "scamps," a derogatory term for members of smaller races.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}} Finally, at the bottom of the hierarchy were the [[slave]]s.

===Religion===
No [[Deity|gods]] had temples in the city, and the people were not permitted to worship them.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} Instead, veneration of the [[primordial]] [[Telos]] was practiced, with quasi-religious services held in the Citadel of the Iron Sky. This and similar shrines dedicated to Telos were maintained by a sect of powerful warlocks called the [[Luminaries]].

==Defenses==
Telos was as much a fortress as it was a city, with high defensive walls, many protective wards and spells, and a garrison of hardened [[Warlock Knights]]. In addition, a dozen [[Storm giant|storm giants]] loyal to the Voice of Telos watched over the city from a [[cloud palace]] that circled above.

==History== 
When the [[primordial]] [[Telos]] fell from the sky during the [[Spellplague]], the future Voice of Telos was the first to discover the location of its comatose body. With the power gained from this encounter, the Voice founded the Warlock Knights, and at the Voice's behest, Telos City was built atop the impact crater where Telos lay.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|188}} The Warlock Knights would go forth to conquer Vaasa by [[1470 DR]],{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}} and Telos City swelled to become the biggest settlement in Vaasa as the many people displaced by the Knights' conquest ironically found themselves seeking shelter within their oppressors' walls.

==Notable Locations==
Visitors to Telos were forbidden to visit the city center without special permission. 

Areas which were off-limits to visitors included:

*[[Citadel of the Iron Sky]], which served as a defensive castle, the center of government, and the primary site of Telos veneration in the city. It contained separate suites and living quarters for each member of the Ironfell Council. The primordial Telos was said to be buried directly beneath the Citadel. The Warlock Knights mined ''[[ironfell]]'' from the primordial's body, a metal-like substance which was the focus of their powers and the primary material used in making their weapons and armor.

Visitors were permitted free access to locations in the city's outer areas, including:

*[[Iron Flagon]], a mostly reputable tavern.
*[[Red Dog]], a tavern.
*[[Aldermanâ€™s Hall]], a boarding house.
*[[Bronze Windlass]], an inn.
*The [[Scamp Warrens]], a neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of the city that was considered largely lawless and which was occupied mostly by [[humanoids]] of smaller races. It was rumored to be home to a thriving black market in which contraband weapons and armor made from ''ironfell'' could be found.

==Inhabitants==
Many of the city's inhabitants had come to Telos after losing their their homes during the Warlock Knights' conquest of Vaasa. As of [[1480 DR]], the city housed 15,000 people, of which 60% were [[Vaasan]] [[humans]] and 20% were [[Shield dwarf|dwarves]]. The remainder was made up of [[orcs]] and "scamps" (referring mostly to [[goblins]], [[kobolds]], and [[halflings]]), as well as the occasional [[giant]]. The majority of non-humans in Telos were slaves or conscripted soldiers.
