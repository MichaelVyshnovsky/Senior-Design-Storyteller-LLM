        "mainbody": "The '''Cave of the Monkey''' was a cave found within a fertile valley located in the [[Kun-Yen Shan]] mountain range, itself part of the larger [[Yehimal]] mountain range, in the [[Hordelands]]. The cave system was also a [[demiplane]] located between [[Toril]]'s [[Prime Material plane]] and the [[Spirit World]] of the [[Celestial Empire]] and was home to the greater [[spirit]] [[Monkey (demigod)|Monkey]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The valley's lowest slopes were dense with [[oak]] and [[pine]] trees, as well as [[bamboo]] and [[Wikipedia:rhododendron|rhododendron]]. The jungle was home to a number of wild animals such as [[boar]], [[bear]]s, [[leopard]]s, and small [[monkey]]s of many different species, which most numerous around the entrance to the cave."
        },
        "Description": "Stepping foot into the cave mouth placed one inside the demiplane. From the entrance, a winding tunnel led past a number of branches before coming to actual home of Monkey. Otherwise, the cave system extended several miles into the depths of the earth, and included a number of tumbled caverns, sinks, and pits that appeared bottomless. \n\nThis was a series of chambers, each sumptuously furnished with some of the most expensive high-quality furniture, rugs, and painted scrolls hanging on the walls, much of it stolen from around the world and replaced with obvious forgeries. One chamber served as a library, with scrolls from centers of learning across Toril, from [[Shou Lung]] and [[Wa]] to [[Phelzol]] and [[Skuld]] to [[Waterdeep]]. Another was a treasure store, full of valuable artworks and jewelry, also stolen.\n\nAs well as these, the caves held ''[[gate]]s'' leading to other worlds and other [[planes]], even to different Prime Material planes. Some of course were known to connect to sites in the [[Spirit World]], with one to the [[Celestial Emperor]]'s own gardens, a second to his stables, and a third to somewhere in the [[Underworld]]. Many others were to places unknown to mortal sages.",
        "Defenses": "While the cave's treasures and tomes were seemingly unguarded and undefended, Monkey had actually included amongst them various tricks and traps to trouble any would-be thieves. Some were just worthless fakes while others were [[enchanted]] to appear valuable and even magical to every appraisal, only to turn into [[dung]] or offal, simple rags, monkeys, [[snake]]s, [[spider]]s, or dangerous monsters once brought out of the cave in order to embarrass or terrorize the miscreant. Should Monkey himself be present when people arrived, he would sometimes hide or disguise himself to play pranks at their expense. If he was robbed, he would pursue the thieves to retrieve the goods, but rarely was he vindictive \n\nFor added defense and added confusion, Monkey applied many quirks to the gates leading to the Cave of the Monkey. From ''gates'' on the Prime Material plane, one could enter the cave freely, but couldn't leave without knowing a pass-phrase. Conversely, from the [[outer planes]], the gates leading to the cave worked the exact opposite way: one could freely pass into the other planes from the cave, but one could only enter the cave from the other planes by knowing the pass-phrase. This prevented mighty extraplanar beings from entering his home uninvited and prevented mortal trespassers from escaping without a perilous trip into the outer planes. Monkey changed the code phrases regularly, so they could never be reused once known. As a result, the Cave of the Monkey was very difficult to find and almost impossible to escape.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Monkey.PNG|thumb|250px|right|''You'll be lucky, or unlucky, to catch him at home.'']]\nWhile it was the home of Monkey himself, he was rarely actually here as he was invariably out in the world either playing pranks on people or paying penance for them when he went too far. Its main purpose was to allow Monkey to easily travel between planes via the ''gates'' located in the caves. Nevertheless, Monkey preferred his privacy and so he made his home in this remote, hard-to-reach valley. Even when he had his freedom and could wander the planes prior to his banishment<ref group=\"note\" name=\"planes\">While ''The Horde''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Monstrous Compendium entry for Monkey states he is banished to Toril and restricted from traveling the planes, the entry for the Cave of the Monkey in Volume I mentions his travel to the planes and discusses portals in his cave giving him access. This article presumes this refers to the situation prior to his banishment, and that these portals are no longer usable by Monkey at the time of the sourcebook. Monkey preferred to pass some of his time on Toril or elsewhere on the Prime Material Plane.",
        "Reputation": "Although obscure and difficult to locate, the Cave of the Monkey was a key site in the legends of the different religions and faiths of [[Kara-Tur]], as Monkey was closely tied to the teachings of many of them. It was both his dwelling place and his power base."
