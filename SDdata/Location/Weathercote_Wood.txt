'''Weathercote Wood''', also known as the '''Weathercote Forest''', was a forest of the [[Triangle of Trees]], located in the great expanse known as the [[Savage Frontier]].

==Geography==
It was located just west of [[Anauroch]], north of the [[Lonely Moor]], east of the [[Graypeak Mountains]] and south of the [[Fallen Lands]] in the [[Savage Frontier]]. Blue mists and strange lights are often seen in the woods.

==History==
Weathercote Wood has existed from before the rise of [[Netheril]] and continued to endure despite the advancing of the desert of Anauroch.

==Trade==
The [[Black Road]] of the [[Zhentarim]] ran just south of Weathercote Woods.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to the elves, Weathercote wood was full of ''[[gate]]s'' to other worlds, as well as [[wizard]]s that guarded them from casual use. Neither [[spell]]s nor [[psionics]] could penetrate the woods The folks of nearby [[Parnast]] believed that their disappearance was a result of [[elven]] magic.

Some legends claimed that [[Nobanion]] originally entered the Realms through one of the portals in Weathercote Woods.[[Eric L. Boyd]] (January 1995). "Forgotten Deities." ''[[Polyhedron]]'' #115, ''page 21''. TSR, Inc.
