It was a confederation of twelve city-states with shared military and mercantile interests in [[south Faerûn|south]] and [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] during [[the Founding Time]], thousands of years before the [[Era of Upheaval]].\n{{Quote|In truth, everything is a trifle when viewed through the lens of history.

        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "The Twelve Cities were in the stretch of land south of the [[Deepwing Mountains]] and north of the great forest of [[Nikerymath]]. The waters of the [[Deep Wash]] were some ways southwest, while the great [[Bay of Jhaamdath]] opened up eastward into the Sea of Fallen Stars."
        },
        "Government": "While formed as an oligarchy, Jhaamdath's second governing body was the Realms first ''psiocracy'' — a ruling council of influential [[psion]]s and [[psychic warrior]]s known as [[bladelord]]s. This form of governance remained for nearly the entirety of the empire's history, until it was supplanted by a single emperor some 20 years prior to its collapse.\n\nThroughout much of its history, Jhaamdath was a centralized power that exerted firm control over its out outer territories.",
        "Society": {
            "Culture": "Jhaamdath was one of the first cultures that employed a written language and thus played a critical role in the development of [[human]] civilization across [[Faerûn]]. \n\nIn addition to their ability to wield the [[Invisible Art]], the Jhaamdathans as a people were renowned for their swordsmanship."
        },
        "Defenses": "Jhaamdath maintained a standing army and carried out the practice of importing warriors from its outer provinces, such as those that lived throughout great plains later known as [[the Shaar]]. \n\nThe nation engaged in non-traditional means of warfare, namely the use of magically-created diseased and plagues that utilized spells such as ''[[mass contagion]]'' and ''[[plague carrier]]''.",
        "History": {
            "Founding of the Twelve Cities": "Jhaamdath was founded in {{Yearlink|-5800}} when a tribe of human warriors led by the psionic warrior-king [[Jhaam]] united the human settlements north of the [[Nikerymath]]. The First City of the Sword, [[Dhinnilith]],<ref group=\"note\" name=\"First City\">In the ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]'' sourcebook, the First City and capital of Jhaamdath is given as [[Dhinnilith]]. In the ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', Naarkolyth is the city with the same distinctions and Dhinnilith is a protected [[Pocket Plane]] accessible via Naarkolyth's palace. For the purposes of this wiki, the former sourcebook is given precedence with regards to discrepancies and inaccuracies. was founded soon after, in {{Yearlink|-5750}}.\n\nWithin the next thirty years, the [[psion]]ic prophet [[Laszik Silvermind]] offered onto the people of Jhaamdath a divine missive from [[Auppenser]] that directed the growth of the burgeoning nation. The first directive was that slavery would be banned throughout the entirety of the nation. Laszik creates the first of the ''[[udoxias]]'', a powerful device that bestowed onto others psionic powers with a range that extended miles beyond Jhaamdath's First City. \n\nThe oligarchic government was wholly abandoned in favor of the ruling psiocracy in {{Yearlink|-5700}}. Jhaamdathi society underwent rapid transformation as its ordered caste system was put in place and the reverence of Auppenser was declared as its state religion.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|-5330}}, continuous expansion saw six of the empire's great cities built across its lands. Some three centuries later, in {{Yearlink|-5032}}, Jhaamdath entered into a great conflict with the newly-formed nation of [[Mir]] over the lands surrounding the [[Lake of Steam]] and delivered unto it a devastating loss. Mir forced Jhaamdath into abandoning its ambitions when it aligned itself with [[Coramshan]], halting Jhaamdathi expansion in the south and forming the nation of [[Calimshan]] in {{Yearlink|-5005}}. \n\nJhaamdath continued to expand over the next millennia and the remaining Twelve Cities were built during this period, culminating with the construction of [[Mirrindith]] in the {{Yearlink|-4430}}. Jhaamdathi expansion felt resistance in the east as the nation of [[Unther]] grew in power and influence from approximately {{Yearlink|-1500}} to {{Yearlink|-1069}}. Unfortunately Jhaamdathi society languished and its cultural cultural growth became stagnant over this period. Xenophobia became rampant throughout its citizenry, with notable exceptions to those that successfully resisted incursions upon their lands.",
            "Imperial Jhaamdath": "In {{YearlinkName|-276}}, a new and dominant force emerged in Jhaamdath, as the powerful [[metamind]] [[Dharien]] overthrew nation's bladelords and declared himself emperor of Jhaamdath. The imperial Jhaamdathi forces aggressively expanded their reach, rapidly moving south, west, and north in the lands around the Sea of Fallen Stars. Jhaamdath rapidly expanded its navy with the construction of a great many ships, utilizing tons of timber stripped from the forests of the [[Chondalwood]]. The Jhaamdathi military was ruthless against those that opposed; while its other forces hunted down and slaughtered the [[elves]] of the forest that dared oppose their expansion, namely those in [[Nikerymath]] that bravely and desperately fought to defend their forest home.\n\nDesperate in the face of utter annihilation, the elves of the region turned to [[elven High Magic]] to rid themselves of their psionicist oppressors. In the {{YearlinkName|-255}}, they called forth a cataclysmic tidal wave from the Jhaamdath Bay, instantly destroying all of the Twelve Cities of the Sword.\n\nWhile some isolated towers and keeps built atop higher ground escaped the destruction, they eventually sank due to the altered seascape. The only remnants of Jhaamdath that survived untouched were those graveyards and outposts built far from the Twelve Cities,\n\nThe basin floor beneath the Vilhon Reach was littered with the ruins of Jhaamdath. Psionic power slowly leaked from the countless number of psionically enchanted magical items, corrupting local flora and fauna and creating new oddities such [[phrenic creature]]s. The sunken cities came to be inhabited by [[koalinth]]s, [[sea hag]]s, and [[scrag]]s who, along with the depth of the Reach, prevented most exploration.",
            "Legacy": "Immediately following the empire's fall, its cities and nearby surrounding lands fell into utter chaos and complete lawlessness. The mayhem became so destructive it required intervention by [[Tyr|Arrtyr]] the Lord of Justice. Arrtyr and his host of ten-score champions pacified the lands and destroyed the lesser deity [[Valigan Thirdborn]], the former advisor to Emperor Dharien, in what came to be known as the [[Procession of Justice]].\n\nSome of the scattered survivors of Jhaamdath's traveled to lands north and east of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Descendants of the great Jhaamdathi exodus formed the city-state of [[Iljak]] along the region of the Vilhon Reach some 150 years later, and the founding of the nation of [[Chondath]] would follow approximately a hundred years later.\n\nOver 1500 years after Jhaamdath's collapse, the landscape of what came to be known as the [[Vilhon Wilds]] changed drastically following the catastrophic events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}. As water levels in the region receded, the spires of the Twelve Cities emerged above the sea for the first time in over a millennium, and the ruins of Jhaamdath were once again accessible to those that sought them."
