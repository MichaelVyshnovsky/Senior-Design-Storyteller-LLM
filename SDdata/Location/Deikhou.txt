Deikhou was a town in Laothan in Malatra, lying on the coast of the Eastern Sea.
The people here manufactured ceramic goods, including pottery and tiles, which were traded across Laothan in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The town was also home to small school of magic that trained wu jen under its master, Hueng.
In 1356 DR, a Kuong temple sohei tried to assassinate Hueng. The attempt failed and the assassin died.
