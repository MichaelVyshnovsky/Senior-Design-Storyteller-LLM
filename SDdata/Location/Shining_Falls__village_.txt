'''Shining Falls''' was a [[halfling]] village in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It was preceded by many [[human]] and [[elf]] settlements on the same site.

==Geography==
It lay on the northern bank of the [[River Delimbiyr]], between it and the [[High Forest]] and downriver of the [[Shining Falls]], the breathtaking {{SIAdj|120|foot|long=yes|adj=high}} waterfall after which Shining Falls was named. These were a magnificent sight from the village. It was linked to the city of [[Loudwater]] by a road.

==History==
Occupation of the site began with the Granite Tower, which the master [[dwarf]] builder [[Iirikos Stoneshoulder]] built for an [[Illuskan]] [[wizard]] named [[Silifrey the Spraystrider]]. He ignored the warnings of his [[elven]] friends, who'd heard Silifrey practiced dangerous dark [[magic]], and quickly finished his task using summoned [[elemental]]s. But he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was dead within a month after moving in.

Afterward, several settlements grew up around the Granite Tower over the centuries, with nearly half-a-dozen [[human]] communities and at least two [[elven]] ones. But, without fail, every one of them suffered the mysterious disappearance of nearly all its residents, with the reason for or connection between these disappearances unknown.

The latest known was that of the elven colony of '''Thelthin'dul'''. The elves sent caravans between [[Loudwater]] and Thelthin'dul, which were escorted by the Fengrath family of mercenaries. The last caravan, some time before [[1272 DR]], returned and discovered all of the citizens had vanished. The few remaining elves in the caravan refused to ever come near the place, so the fearless Fengraths moved into the Granite Tower and declared themselves rulers of the renamed town. No one contested their claim.

The new ruler, Gauntlet Walenburh Fengrath, invited [[strongheart halfling]]s to settle the village in the 1280s DR. They came and they flourished, heedless of stories of curses and ghosts.

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, in the High Forest near the [[Dire Wood]], trappers returning from upriver clashed with patrols of "[[wild elf|savage elves]]" said to be serving a "[[Green King|Forest King]]".<ref>{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/"Extermination" Plot Recap}} Meanwhile, Gauntlet Deogol was more concerned with hiring [[adventurer]]s to uncover the legendary dwarven caves behind the Shining Falls waterfall.

Some time after [[Shieldmeet]] that year, Gauntlet Deogol went missing for at least a month, his fate and whereabouts unknown. Around the same time, a grim band of adventurers passed through Shining Falls on their way to the [[Fallen Lands]]; they numbered 12–15 humans, mostly warriors with one wizard. Any connection between them is unknown.<ref><ref group="note">The reason for Deogol Fengrath's disappearance is not covered within the remaining [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] materials. It may be in the subsequent module, the unreleased "[[Into the Fallen Lands]]".

==Population==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the town had a population of 578, including 540 [[halfling]]s, many of them [[strongheart halfling]]s, and 38 [[human]]s, who included the Fengrath family.

==Government==
Since its founding, Shining Falls was ruled by members of the [[Fengrath]] family, from its founder, [[Walenburh Fengrath]], to her great-grandson, [[Deogol Fengrath]]. They adopted the traditional local title of [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlet]] and dwelled in the Granite Tower with their family, servants, and guards, who tended also to be family. ''Circa'' 1372, Deogol Fengrath ruled with a light hand, preferring to leave the day-to-day running of things to his sheriff so that he could concentrate on his magic in peace.

==Defense==
Defense of the town, and even some governance, was in the hands of the Sheriff, who around 1372 DR was [[Vendal Viccstray]]. He was served by Sergeants [[Hethat Deegrell]], [[Jren Prencertal]], and [[Nemmet Viccstray]] and forty guards. They wore a uniform of green beret, striped yellow-and-green blouse, leather [[breeches]], and [[studded leather]] armor, and were armed with halfling-sized [[longsword]]s and [[light shield]]s, [[sling]]s and [[bullet]]s and rode [[war dog]]s. In the event of trouble or crime, the people of Shining Falls made a hue and cry that brought the town guard riding in on their war dogs.

==Trade==
The village had a number of trappers. They usually took [[rabbit]], so this was the main meat for the village.

[[Blaz Merrymar]] of Merrymar's Merchandise had exclusive deals with all crafters in town so that only he could sell their wares to outsiders. His reasonable commissions and prices made this monopoly profitable for all.

==Description==
The village was laid out rather like a wagon wheel if viewed from above, with roads running in concentric circles forming the wheel and occasional roads coming from the center as its spokes. At the very center was the Granite Tower, taking the role of the axle. Standing {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} tall and bedecked with carved monsters, and considered either a work of art or an eyesore, it dominated the settlement.

The buildings themselves were for the most part single-story, stout houses of a [[Wikipedia:Ranch-style house|rambler style]] that northern strongheart halflings preferred, built to accommodate the predominantly halfling population. A few of Thelthin'dul's elven tree-houses remained and were repurposed by some of the more daring halflings. Otherwise, the rest of the buildings consisted of grain silos and barns.

Shining Falls shared some attributes with Loudwater. It was a lush garden town with small copses of various trees—[[ash]], [[birch]], [[oak]], and a few [[blueleaf]]s—scattered around, but these were overshadowed by the woodlands of the High Forest that spread to the northwest. Just north of the village, within the forest boundary, was the Hearthcircle of Yondalla.

===Notable Locations===
* [[Granite Tower (Shining Falls)|Granite Tower]]: Seat of power of the Fengraths
* [[The Ale and Rabbit]]: Shining Falls' only inn
* [[Merrymar's Merchandise]]: The only general goods store
* [[Hearthcircle of Yondalla]]: A sacred grove to [[Yondalla]] and the center of worship for the village

==Rumors & Legends==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, folk feared that the Granite Tower was cursed or still haunted by the vengeful spirit of Silifrey the Spraystrider, and moreover that she sometimes went on rampages and was the cause of the disappearances. Legends added hidden tunnels beneath the tower and village that housed the [[undead]] [[skeleton]]s of all those who'd vanished over the years. The halflings scoffed at such stories.
