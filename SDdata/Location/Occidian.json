The orcs managed to overrun the northland plains and plunged deep into the forests. Many circles of High Magi had bonded with their brothers and sisters in the tower of Occidian so when the orcs broke the wards and destroyed the tower, a magical backslash killed many of the High Magi in other cities like Sharlarion.\ndeOccidian\nCategoryCities\nCategoryRuined settlements\nCategorySettlements\nCategoryElven locations\nCategoryLocations in North Faer没n\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faer没n\nCategoryLocations in Faer没n\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nn98nduu1zvjx1chxi32hihkubj4jf4j"
