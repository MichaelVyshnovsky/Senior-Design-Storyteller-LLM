Daerlun was a large city in Sembia.
As of , the city was run by an elderly merchant named Halath Tymmyr, although he was a puppet for the evil commander of the guard, Allathast, who was a member of the Cult of the Dragon.
Circa , Daerlun came under the control of the Netherese Empire along with the rest of Sembia, The city declared itself a neutral independent city-state in the , rather than be absorbed by Cormyr or stay under the direct influence of Sembia.
Daerlun was the most heavily fortified city in Sembia, and boasted the tallest curtain wall on all of Toril. This  wall was made of magically hard obsidian and was erected by the Netherese Empire in the .Canon material does not provide an exact date for when the Netherese raised Daerluns wall, but Brian R. James, one of the authors of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide in which the wall is discussed, clarified in a [http//archive.today/2024.10.31-023313/https//x.com/brianrjames/status/1621036856 Tweet] that it was built in 1382 DR. It was garrisoned by a massive army of conscripts from across Sembia, who drilled on massive parade grounds near the citys markets. 
Patrols out of Daerlun&mdashmounted on flying griffons or veserabs&mdashranged as far as the Vast Swamp, the Thunder Peaks, and the southern Dales.
The city had a bustling marketplace and a wealthy trade quarter.
As of the mid-14 century DR, Daerlunian linen sold for around 8 sp per square yard, while Daerlunian wool sold for between 9 sp and 2 gp per square yard depending on the weight of the fabric. The city imported such commodities as parchment, wine, and wool from Eveningstar in Cormyr.
The evil semi-religious organization, the Cult of the Dragon, had a presence in Daerlun as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, but preferred a secretive approach, using the city as a place to store armaments and to treat wounded members. The commander of the city guard, Allathast, used the elderly merchant Halath Tymmyr as a puppet to rule the city.
In the , the city prepared defenses against a possible Shadovar and Sembian invasion. Rumors abounded in the city about gods, war, and natural disasters.
