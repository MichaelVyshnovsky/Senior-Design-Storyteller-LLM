'''Daerlun''' was a large city in [[Sembia]].

==Government==
As of {{Yearlink|1368}}, the city was run by an elderly merchant named [[Halath Tymmyr]], although he was a puppet for the evil commander of the guard, [[Allathast]], who was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

''Circa'' {{Yearlink|1480}}, Daerlun came under the control of the [[Netherese Empire]] along with the rest of Sembia,{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|61}} The city declared itself a neutral independent city-state in the {{YearlinkName|1439}}, rather than be absorbed by Cormyr or stay under the direct influence of Sembia.

==Defenses==
Daerlun was the most heavily fortified city in Sembia, and boasted the tallest curtain wall on all of [[Toril]]. This {{SIAdj|500|foot|long=yes|adj=tall}} wall was made of [[magic]]ally hard [[obsidian]] and was erected by the Netherese Empire in the {{YearlinkName|1382}}.[[Canon]] material does not provide an exact date for when the Netherese raised Daerlun's wall, but [[Brian R. James]], one of the authors of the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' in which the wall is discussed, clarified in a [http://archive.today/2024.10.31-023313/https://x.com/brianrjames/status/1621036856 Tweet] that it was built in 1382 DR. It was garrisoned by a massive army of conscripts from across Sembia, who drilled on massive parade grounds near the city's markets. 

Patrols out of Daerlun&mdash;mounted on flying [[griffon]]s or [[veserab]]s&mdash;ranged as far as the [[Vast Swamp]], the [[Thunder Peaks]], and the southern [[Dales]].

==Trade==
The city had a bustling marketplace and a wealthy trade quarter.

As of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], Daerlunian linen sold for around 8 [[sp]] per square yard, while Daerlunian wool sold for between 9 sp and 2 [[gp]] per square yard depending on the weight of the fabric. The city imported such commodities as [[parchment]], [[wine]], and [[wool]] from [[Eveningstar]] in Cormyr.

==History==
The evil semi-religious organization, the Cult of the Dragon, had a presence in Daerlun as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, but preferred a secretive approach, using the city as a place to store armaments and to treat wounded members. The commander of the city guard, Allathast, used the elderly merchant Halath Tymmyr as a puppet to rule the city.

In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, the city prepared defenses against a possible [[Shadovar]] and Sembian invasion. Rumors abounded in the city about gods, war, and natural disasters.
