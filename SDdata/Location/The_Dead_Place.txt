'''The Dead Place''' was a stretch of forest near [[Starmantle]] that was briefly cleared of most wildlife in the {{yearlinkName|767}} by the actions of [[Saeraede Lyonora]].
{{quote|Aye, them as goes in comes not out. There's nary a squirrel or chipmunk 'tween [[Oggle's Stream]] and [[Rairdrun Hill]], just this side of Starmantle. We go by boat, now, if'n we have to. No one takes the road, nor goes through the woods, neither. A [[tenday]] an' some back, some fancy adventuring band...an' not the first one, neither...hired by the High Duke hisself went in... and came not out again. Nor will they, or my name's not Jalobal...which, a-heh, 'tis. Mark you, they'll not be seen again, no. I hear there's another band of fools yet, jus' set out from Starmantle ...|[[Jalobal]], of [[Ripplestones]]}}

==Geography==
The area contained a ruined town that had since become mounds and thickets, with especially large [[shadowtop]] trees.

===Flora & Fauna===
Saliently, the area was briefly cleared of any wildlife larger than mice in 767 DR.

==Government==
The area was at the time within the formal territory of the High Duchy of [[Langalos]], which was centered in Starmantle.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|644|12}}

==History==
The area had a name to humans, but it had been forgotten by the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|713-714|18}} After winter in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, all wildlife, livestock, and people passing through the area were slain and mysteriously disappeared, leading Duke [[Horostos]] of Langalos to send [[adventurer]]s such as the [[Frostfire Banner]] to investigate.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|653-655|12}} this mist was the undead sorceress Saeraede Lyonora.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|676|14}} The area slowly expanded to engulf a local town, [[Ayken's Stump]], prompting action from the [[Harpers]], who vowed to the Duke they'd report on the location, once the Duke could no longer find adventurers or mercenaries to investigate through his agents in [[Reth]] and [[Westgate]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|674-675|14}}

After [[Elminster Aumar]] left Ripplestones that year during his long quest to cache away [[enchanted]] items as a [[Chosen of Mystra]], he took the road to Starmantle, going straight through the Dead Place, despite warnings from locals. [[Ilbryn Starym]], an elven wizard who was pursuing him, was also led towards that place in Ripplestones,{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|701-703|17}} An ambushing force of [[Sharran]] priests, in turn, also followed Elminster to that place, after learning of his location through scrying and agents, forcing local woodsman [[Uldus Blackram]] to guide them.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|691-692|16}} Elminster, in turn, came into conflict with another party of adventurers investigating the zone, only to be lured to the Keep by Saeraede Lyonora.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|693-695|15}}

Along the way, Ilbryn Starym came into conflict with a party of adventurers and killed them all, and then with the Sharran priests, whom he fled from after learning about the ruins;{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|696-699|17}} the released sorceries also drew the attention of the elven mage [[Starsunder]] and his momentary guest, [[Umbregard]] of [[Galadorna]], who teleported from Tangletrees to investigate.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|715-716|18}}

==Notable Locations==
