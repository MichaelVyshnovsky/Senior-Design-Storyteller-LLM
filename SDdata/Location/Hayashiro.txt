'''Hayashiro''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Hayashiro was once a small yet thriving village.

==History==
In {{yearlinkConvert|1428|KY}}, creatures descending from the nearby mountains led a devastating attack on the village. During a violent nocturnal raid, the invaders massacred the inhabitants, plundered the properties, and ignited fires across the village. The onset of a midnight rainstorm prevented the complete destruction of the village by preserving a few buildings.

Despite the widespread ruin, two individuals miraculously survived the massacre: a young boy and a man who had been absent from the village that fateful night. Having formed a bond in the aftermath, they resided together in one of the surviving, albeit damaged, dwellings as of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}.
