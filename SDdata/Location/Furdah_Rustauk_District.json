        "mainbody": "The '''Furdah Rustauk District''' was district in [[Dhaztanar]], [[Semphar]] that lay along [[Gbor Nor]] and including the harbors.",
        "Description": "The walls surrounding Furdah Rustauk were the oldest in the city, sitting in a state of disrepair. Mud brick was used in their construction, which weathered over time.\n\nThe entire southwestern section of Furdah Rustauk touched the shore of Gbor Nor. Much of the northern border of the district abutted the walls of the vast [[Madinat]]. Both the northwest and northeast corners of the district bordered the [[Shari-Souk District]].\n\nMany canals ran from the harbor to the rest of the city, feeding small boats that carried cargo and passengers from the larger ships that sat at anchor.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Palace of the Chief Examiner]]\n* The [[Great Hospital]]\n* The [[Bridge of the Straw Merchants]]\n* The [[Little Gate]]\n* [[Street of the Murgh√¥m Merchants]]\n* The [[Caliph's Orphanage]]\n* The [[Prison of the Southern Gate]]\n* The [[Gardens of Markharh]]\n* The [[Tower of Blessed Strength]]"
