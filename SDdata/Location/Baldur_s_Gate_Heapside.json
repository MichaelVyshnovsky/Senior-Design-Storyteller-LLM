        "mainbody": "Heapside was a large district in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate that included the portion of the city northeast of Gray Harbor. It was bordered by the Old Wall of the city to the north, the Steeps to the west and Eastway to the south.\nThe name Heapside originally referred to the entirety of what came to be known as the Lower City of Baldurs Gate. This changed following the events of the Tax Revolts, when the terms \"Upper City\" and \"Lower City\" came into use and replaced \"Old Town\" and \"Heapside\".\nBusinesses\n* Baldurs Mouth Housed in a narrow five-story building with the words \"Baldurs Mouth\" printed vertically down the front, this news carrier disseminated the news of the day by means of town criers and broadsheets that were printed by mechanical scribes.\n* Candulhallows Funeral Arrangements A family-business that both aided in the care of deceased Baldurians and occasionally sold corpses\n* Sorcerous Sundries One of the most visually-stunning buildings in the city, this shop specialized in magical components, along with other services provided by its proprietor.\nTaverns and restaurants\n* Blushing Mermaid This tavern was infamous across the Sword Coast as a gathering place where the lowliest of dregs could conduct their shady dealings.\n* Splurging Sturgeon Formerly a struggling tavern, the Sturgeon was reformed as a seafood restaurant that offered a wide-range of tasty dishes featuring nearly anything that was fished from local waters.\nTemples\n* Shrine of the Suffering The Baldurian shrine to Ilmater was small and rather unremarkable, however its attendants catered to the most destitute of the Gates residents."
