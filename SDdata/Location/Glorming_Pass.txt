'''Glorming Pass''' was a major pass through [[Earthfast Mountains]] in [[the Vast]], linking the northern and southern halves. The [[North Road]] ran through it to connect [[Sevenecho]] and [[Dragon Falls]]. It was a wild and dangerous place, prone to [[orc]] ambushes and haunted by [[The Phantom Knights]]. <ref group="note">Based on maps and descriptions in [[Dungeon magazine 75|"Into the Nest of Vipers"]], the Glorming Pass may also include the land between [[Brynwood]] and [[Adhe Wood]].

==History==
The pass was named for [[Glorming]], a local orc chieftain who died fighting in the pass.

At the close of [[1368 DR|the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], the [[Vipers]] bandits began raiding merchant caravans going through the Glorming Pass. They soon made a fearful reputation for themselves by the beginning of [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}} <ref group="note">As "Into the Nest of Vipers" is an adventure module, its conclusion is officially unresolved. Successful completion would see the Vipers banditry ended in early [[Eleint]], 1368 DR. As mentioned above, the Vipers bandits may have specifically raided the area between Brynwood and Adhe Wood.

==Inhabitants==
[[Orc]]s were highly populous in the mountains on either side of the pass, dwelling in cavern-lairs.

Various kinds of monsters were also found in numbers.

==Usage==
Orcs frequently patrolled the pass and monsters of various kinds were commonly sighted. However, despite being so dangerous, the Glorming Pass saw a great deal of traffic along the North Road, as it was one of only two major passes linking the Vast. It was recommended that merchants not risk passage without sufficient numbers to defend themselves. It still had less locations for ambushes or deliberate rockfalls than [[Elvenblood Pass]].

==Rumors and legends==
[[The Phantom Knights]] haunted Glorming Pass, usually seen galloping their similarly spectral mounts the full length of the pass. Their origins were unknown.

[[Riliyyn Scantshar]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] theorized that some evil entity, likely a [[wizard]], a [[lich]], or possibly even an [[alhoon]], dwelled in nearby parts of the Earthfast Mountains. She also believed that it kept a [[deepspawn]] in the area to spawn creatures that would discourage explorers from finding its lair. According to other [[sage]]s, the deepspawn guarded a fortress that housed a ''[[gate]]'' to some other world, such as the [[demiplane]] of [[Ravenloft]].This deepspawn may be related to those mysteriously deposited in a number of old ruins throughout the Vast ''circa'' [[1370 DR]], mentioned on page 158 of ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]''.

It was generally supposed that the local orcs must have amassed an impressive amount of treasure from their victims over the ages, hoarded within their nearby lairs. It was also thought that whatever force had left the deepspawn behind possessed powerful magic.
