        "mainbody": "Druths Pillar was a hollow pillar in the Haunted Wing of Castle Obarskyr.\nThe pillar had the appearance of three pillars fused together. Also, it could swing wide open, revealing a hollow space. It was the only pillar of its design in the whole haunted wing of Castle Obarskyr.\nThe triple pillar was once the endpost of War Wizard Jereth Ardruths closet.\nIn , the death knight Targrael, once a highknight of Cormyr, had sought the pillar under the belief that Jorunhast may have hidden Salember Obarskyrs \"marcher in blue flame\", which she believed may be a blueflame item, in there, based on a note unearthed by five sages working in the palace basements, poring over old records. Those mages were Loagranboydar, Orkrash, Garendor, Wyshbryn, and Argrant.\nTargrael was also aware of a note from Palaghard to a lover, making an oblique reference that the pillar, \"Druths Pillar\" to him, could be opened to reveal a space big enough to hide in. While heading for the pillar, she was attacked by the ghost of the ancient regent, Alusair Obarskyr, before reaching it."
