        "Description": "The pillar had the appearance of three pillars fused together. Also, it could swing wide open, revealing a hollow space. It was the only pillar of its design in the whole haunted wing of [[Castle Obarskyr]].",
        "History": "The triple pillar was once the endpost of [[War Wizard]] [[Jereth Ardruth]]'s closet.\n\n{{quote|''The three pillars safeguard the most perilous.''|[[Jorunhast]], note}}\n\nIn {{yearlink|1479}}, the [[death knight]] [[Targrael]], once a [[highknight]] of [[Cormyr]], had sought the pillar under the belief that [[Jorunhast]] may have hidden [[Salember Obarskyr]]'s \"marcher in blue flame\", which she believed may be a [[blueflame item]], in there, based on a note unearthed by five sages working in the palace basements, poring over old records. Those mages were [[Loagranboydar]], [[Orkrash]], [[Garendor]], [[Wyshbryn]], and [[Argrant]].\n\n{{quote|''If you need to hide, Druth's Pillar swings wide.''|[[Palaghard]] Obarskyr, note to a lover}}\n\nTargrael was also aware of a note from [[Palaghard]] to a lover, making an oblique reference that the pillar, \"Druth's Pillar\" to him, could be opened to reveal a space big enough to hide in. While heading for the pillar, she was attacked by the [[ghost]] of the ancient regent, [[Alusair Obarskyr]], before reaching it."
