        "Geography": "Norheim was located in the northwestern region of the Moonshae Isles. The island of [[Norland]] was located to Norheim's southwest, and the kingdom of [[Gnarhelm]] in northern [[Alaron]] was located to the southeast. The [[Korinn Archipelago]] was found due east of Norheim. Norheim's islands formed the northern boundary of the [[Sea of Moonshae]].\n\nThe major islands of Norheim included [[Giantspine]], [[Canthrell]], [[Llorgh]], and [[Graygruun]]. The largest island, Giantspine, was the base of power in Norheim where the king ruled from [[Hammerstaad]]. Another half-dozen unnamed islands were located within Norheim's boundaries as well.",
        "History": "The vast majority of land on Norheim's islands consisted of rocky terrain, forcing the Northlanders to rely heavily upon the outside world for their survival. The people of Norheim were a seafaring breed as a whole, though a minority did grow [[barley]] or wheat or tended [[sheep]]. Raids from Norheimers into the lands of the [[Ffolk]] brought back just as much food as they did treasure.",
