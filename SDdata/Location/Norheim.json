        "mainbody": "Norheim was a Northlander kingdom within the Moonshae Isles that consisted of several islands.\nNorheim was located in the northwestern region of the Moonshae Isles. The island of Norland was located to Norheims southwest, and the kingdom of Gnarhelm in northern Alaron was located to the southeast. The Korinn Archipelago was found due east of Norheim. Norheims islands formed the northern boundary of the Sea of Moonshae.\nThe major islands of Norheim included Giantspine, Canthrell, Llorgh, and Graygruun. The largest island, Giantspine, was the base of power in Norheim where the king ruled from Hammerstaad. Another half-dozen unnamed islands were located within Norheims boundaries as well.\nThe vast majority of land on Norheims islands consisted of rocky terrain, forcing the Northlanders to rely heavily upon the outside world for their survival. The people of Norheim were a seafaring breed as a whole, though a minority did grow barley or wheat or tended sheep. Raids from Norheimers into the lands of the Ffolk brought back just as much food as they did treasure.\n* Hammerstaad\n* Seawolf\n* Threlloch\n* Dalheim\n* Greystaad\n* Rottesheim"
