        "mainbody": "The '''Sunlit Wetlands''', also known as the '''Putrid Bog''', was a stretch of wilderness situated along the northern bank of the [[River Chionthar]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]]. While it first appeared as a wild but beauteous bit of nature, it was truly a place of dread and misery, home to malevolent [[dark fey]] creatures and evil [[magic]].",
        "Description": "At first glace, the wetlands appeared as a serene and perhaps overgrown fen, ideal as a place to rest. This was merely an illusion however, as they were in fact a foul and deadly swamp full of peril.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "[[File:Willow.png|thumb|right|300px|The large [[willow]] tree atop the islet of the swamp.]]\nThe swamp was difficult to navigate, with few muddy pathways winding through murky waters dotted and twisting vines. Dead and rotting trees choked off passageways as overgrown root systems sprang up over the mud and rock.\n\nA rudimentary set of docks and wooden walkways were built around the southern end of the wetlands, with a bridge that extended out to a small islet in the southern waters. A single massive [[willow]] tree grew within the islet, the base of which was encircled with stone slabs inscribed swirling, almost pictographic designs. Several crumbling stone [[menhir]]s encircled the willow, their origin unknown.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "A small flock of sheep grazed across the wetlands, innocently \"baah-ing\" at anyone that stopped close to them. These seemingly adorable sheep were in fact vicious [[redcap]]s with powerful [[illusion]] magic placed over them.\n\nLarge barbed bulrush plants dotted the wetlands, with tantalizing [[apple]]s that were ripe for the taking. The apples left an upset feeling in the stomach of anyone daring enough to bite into them.\n\nse plants left gaping wounds to anyone plucking the fruit not dexterous enough to avoid their barbs. If not treated properly in short order, these wounds could easily turn to rot."
        },
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the islet with the standing stones served as a secret dead drop site for the [[Shadow Druids]]. It was used by the druid [[Kagha]] to communicate with others of her order during her infiltration of the [[Emerald Grove]] enclave to the northeast.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Riverside Teahouse]], the quaint and charming abode of the manipulative and hate-filled [[green hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Several [[wood woad]]s and a pair of ancient [[mud mephit]]s made their home in the area around the great willow tree."
