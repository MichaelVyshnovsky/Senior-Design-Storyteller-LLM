        "mainbody": "The Tannath Gap, often called just The Gap, was a forested highland between the Tannath Mountains and the rest of the Dragonjaw Mountains, around the River Umber, opposite Singing Sands.\nThe Gap was a narrow forest with damp, soft soil. The climate was cool and pleasant, and the River Umber wound down the middle of the Gap. \nThe area was covered with blue-needle pine and fir. The largest mammal seemed to be deer there were raccoons, foxes, opposums, badgers and squirrels. Otters and beavers lived in the bodies of water, and birds such as hawks, herons and crows were present as well. The predators included cougars.\nThere were few enchanted creatures in the Gap griffons from the Tannath Mountains flew over at some times. Cath shee, believed to be descended from the original elven inhabitants, were also known to exist there as of . It was believed monsters had been hunted to extinction in the region.\nAs of , the River Umber had become a major trade road in the region. People downstream on Aglarond preferred not to fish there, distrusting the Thayans upstream.\nThe Aglarondans rarely patrolled the Gap, believing the terrain to be sufficiently disuassive to most invaders.\nHunters claimed to have killed a \"globular\", possibly a deepspawn, some years before in .\nIn , an Aglarondan force returned to Aglarond through the Gap after pushing an enemy Thayan force out of Shyvar Pass in order to flank another Thayan force as it attacked Emmech.\nIn , Vunmal Murn of Phsant fomented a rivalry between her home city and Aglarond over the Tannath Gap.\nA small clan of werefoxes was believed to be hunting in the woods as of .\nWoodcutters and hunters lived along the piedmont, making their homes in small cottages."
