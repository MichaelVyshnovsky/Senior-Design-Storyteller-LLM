            "Flora & Fauna": "The area was covered with [[blue-needle pine]] and [[fir]]. The largest mammal seemed to be [[deer]]: there were [[raccoon]]s, [[fox]]es, [[opposum]]s, [[badger]]s and [[squirrel]]s. [[Otter]]s and [[beaver]]s lived in the bodies of water, and birds such as [[hawk]]s, [[heron]]s and [[crow]]s were present as well. The predators included [[cougar]]s.\n\nThere were few enchanted creatures in the Gap; [[griffon]]s from the [[Tannath Mountains]] flew over at some times. [[Cath shee]], believed to be descended from the original [[elven]] inhabitants, were also known to exist there as of {{yearlink|1368}}. It was believed monsters had been hunted to extinction in the region."

        "Trade": "As of {{yearlink|1372}}, the River Umber had become a major trade road in the region. People downstream on Aglarond preferred not to fish there, distrusting the [[Thay]]ans upstream.",

        "History": "Hunters claimed to have killed a \"globular\", possibly a [[deepspawn]], some years before in {{yearlink|1368}}.\n\nIn {{yearlink|1365}}, an [[Aglarond]]an force returned to Aglarond through the Gap after pushing an enemy Thayan force out of [[Shyvar Pass]] in order to flank another Thayan force as it attacked Emmech.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|147}}\n\nIn {{yearlink|1479}}, [[Vunmal Murn]] of [[Phsant]] fomented a rivalry between her home city and [[Aglarond]] over the Tannath Gap.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|182}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "A small clan of [[werefox]]es was believed to be hunting in the woods as of {{yearlink|1368}}.",
