The Dolsel Gap was a mountain pass found between Tashalar and Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
Located along the southern region of the Hazur Mountains, the gap allowed passage between Thindol and Tashalar. The dense Black Jungles encroached upon the Dolsel Gap but gave way to the Guthland.
Dolsel Gap was covered with dense jungle that was perpetually cloaked with mist.
Dolsel Gap was heavily patrolled on both ends as it was the only navigable land route that connected the Thindol Basin with the Black Jungles. Vigilant Thindolese patrols refused entry for anyone passing into Thindol through Dolsel Gap, and the Jennestas did the same for anyone attempting to enter the Black Jungles.
Troops of baboonlike gambols roved in the area as well.
Untold centuries before the 1300s DR, yuan-ti sacrificed Lapal slaves in a vile ritual. Their tortured spirits rose as crimson deaths haunting the Dolsel Gap, where they preyed on all sentient beings, humans and serpentfolk alike, but targeting especially yuan-ti.
