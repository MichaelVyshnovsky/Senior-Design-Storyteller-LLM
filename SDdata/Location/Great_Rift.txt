The Great Rift was the traditional home of Faerûns gold dwarves, though there was also a human city nearby, called Khôltar, until the Spellplague of 1385 DR. The country of 1,300,000 dwarves, gnomes, halflings, and humans was nominally ruled by a monarchy, but actually by a council of clan elders named the Deep Lords, from the capital of Underhome.
"There is a difference between a Dwarf and a pick-axe" was a saying in the Great Rift. It meant that a good king didnt use his people like tools. 
When the Spellplague hit in 1385 DR, the western half of the Great Rift collapsed into the Underdark, forming an enormous canyon called the Underchasm. What remained of the Great Rift became known as East Rift. Underhome was destroyed in the cataclysm and the capital was moved to Eartheart.
During the Second Sundering in 1486 DR. the quest of the four chosen (Kleef Kenric, Malik el Sami, Joelle Emmeline and Arietta Seasilver) to deliver the Eye of Gruumsh to Grumbar for Luthic and to stop Shar restored the canyon to its former earthly land before the Spellplague.
