'''Mortonbrace''' was a largely disregarded neighborhood in the [[Uptown District (Ravens Bluff)|Uptown District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. It was a dreary region of relative affluence, mostly known for being the locale that held the city's grand [[Coliseum (Ravens Bluff)|coliseum]].

Many of its residents sought a home in Mortonbrace for the sake of anonymity as few visitors and Ravenians came to visit for business or pleasure. Despite that common misconception, there were a fair number of attractions to be found in Mortonbrace.
