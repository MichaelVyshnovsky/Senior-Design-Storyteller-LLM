The '''Watchwall''' was a massive, magically engineered length of stone wall, stretching from the fortress city of [[Glarondar]] to the slopes of [[Umbergoth]], thus extending the defensive barrier of the [[Dragonjaw Mountains]] another fifteen miles, up to a rock-like fortification containing one-third of [[Aglarond]]'s armed forces. It was constructed by the [[galeb duhr]] living in [[Tannath]] and Undergoth in [[1085 DR]].
