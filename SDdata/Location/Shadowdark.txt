The '''Shadowdark''' was an underground domain of the [[Underdark]] situated in the [[Deep Wastes]] just beneath [[Shadowdale]].

==Geography==
Covering a 120-mile area of the [[Upperdark]], the Shadowdark was largely centered around the village of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]]. Riddled with tunnels, springs, lakes and even geothermal locations, the Shadowdark made a number of connections with surface locations around the dale and gave ample places for the [[drow]] in the area to hide.
