The sewers of Selgaunt were a sanitation system of tunnels beneath the eponymous Sembian port city.
The sewage throughout the system coursed northeast, through rusty grates beneath its wharves,
The ceilings of the tunnels were vaulted. In some areas they were high enough for a human to walk properly across its cobblestone walkways, or crawl to navigate through them during periods of low tide.
While some areas of the sewers sported ensconced lamps that let off an eerie green glow, or lantern. The sewers were also permeated by a rank odor of waste, organic decay, dung, and goldflow, as was typical of sewer systems.
In addition to standard sewer wildlife such as rats and giant rats, tales abounded in Selgaunt of dire creatures lurking within its sewers. These included such things as ghouls, flesh dissolving slimes, and algoids.
* An unnamed Harper safehouse in the citys Warehouse District.
* The Hunting Gardens of the Hulorn were connected to the sewers, by a fountain, the centerpiece of the gardens, separated by a grate that could be pushed up from below. It was not uncommon for teenagers to sneak into the Hunting Gardens through the sewers, dared by their friends to bring back some rare flower or another as proof of their trespass.
* The guildhouse of the Night Knives, formerly a trading office and storehouse for the Six Coins Trading Coster, had a concealed trapdoor in its lower level that granted the  access to the citys old sewer system.
* An alley off of Stevedores Way had a secret entrance to the sewers in the form of a well with an affixed ladder and special lock mechanism that had been established by the Harpers. It was roughly a  descent from the well to the tunnels below.
* In an alley off of Winding Way stood a dry common well, dug by the Night Knives, that provided access to the sewers  below. The area it dropped down into branched off into three directions and blocked off from the main tunnels.
* The Harpers, like other covert organizations in Selgaunt, used the sewers to navigate the city beneath the notice of the Zhentarim.
* The Night Knives, the local thieves guild in the 14 century DR, had a number of entrances to the sewers and regularly patrolled their areas to keep them clear of unwanted intruders.
* The Shadowblades, a group of Maskarran thieves, once operated in the sewers and maintained a shrine to Mask there until it was discovered by agents of the Zhentarim as they were making inroads into Selgaunt.
It was not uncommon to find Selgauntian beggars and destitute to take shelter in the warmth of the sewers, occasionally perishing therein and becoming food for the local rats.
Despite the existence of the sewer system, Selgauntians continued to pour their waste out in chamberpots for collection by nightsoil wagons well into the late 14 century DR.
Around , thieves Erevis Cale and Jak Fleet fled down the secret entrance off of Stevedores Way to escape from Zhent agents that were after them. Erevis was suspicious of Jaks knowledge of how to access the secret entrance, but before they could come to blows they ran into Jaks fellow agents and he was forced to reveal to Erevis that he was a member of the Harpers. The two friends managed to reconcile and continue their travel through the sewers.
Larajin, a half-elf servant of the Uskevren family, often snuck into the Hunting Gardens of Hulorn whenever she needed to clear her head. But one night when she was planning to go, in the winter of 1370 DR, the dwarf Kremlar offered her thirty ravens if she could retrieve a rare flower by the name of Selunes Kisses. She would manage to access the Hunting Gardens with ease, but while there discovered an injured tressym and Andeth Ilchammar, the Hulorn of Selgaunt, whose body had been transformed by dark magics. Fearful of being caught, Larajin waited until he was out of sight before fleeing from the scene and vowing to return the next morning for the tressym.
The next night she returned with Talbot Uskevren, who had insisted upon accompanying her after hearing her recount. from beaks, serpent tongues, human-like hands, hooves, feathered wings, horns, and even a tiny human head in one case. The two ran feverishly through the dark sewage as the ravenous swarm pursued them, grasping at them, gnawing at their clothes. With luck, the two managed to escape from the depths.
A year later around Deepwinter, Erevis Cale came across a pile of rotting corpses at the base of the ladder leading up into the Night Knives guildhouse. Numbering around fifteen to twenty, the entangled mass of corpses were being feasted upon by giant rats. It took Cale little time to recognize the corpses as all members of the Night Knives,
By Uktar 11, in the , unrest across Sembia left the possibility of a civil war looming as a certainty over the new Hulorn of Selgaunt, Thamalon Uskevren II. Wanting to prepare his city against the army of Countess Mirabeta Selkirk, Thamalon had engineers supervise wide-scale renovations of the citys defenses, which included securing Selgaunts sewer grates.
