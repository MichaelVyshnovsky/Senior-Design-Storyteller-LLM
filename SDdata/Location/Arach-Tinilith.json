        "Structure": "The complex -- the largest of the Academy -- was located on the northern side of the [[Tier Breche]] cavern and was shaped like a spider. The \"cephalothorax\" of the spider housed the grandest chapels, the holiest altars, and the quarters of the senior priestesses. The crowning gem of the complex was the main chapel, carved from a single mass of black stone. Inside, seats surrounded a circular platform that held a statue of a spider with the head of a drow female.\n\n[[File:Arach-Tinilith.png|thumb|left|''The exterior of Arach-Tinilith.'']]\nThe Mistress of the academy had an office on the highest level that had a tapestry depicting Lolth looming over a sacrificed surface elf.\n\nThere were dungeon-like kitchens located in the lower levels. Slaves, such as the [[ogre]] slave [[Chirank]] in [[1361 DR]], were employed there.\n\nA small library was located somewhere in the complex.",
        "History": "Arach-Tinilith was founded as part of [[Tier Breche]], [[Menzoberranzan]]'s educational institution as [[House S'sril]]'s literal last act, in order to standardize [[Lolth]]'s teachings and produce [[cleric]]s of any meaningful quality. [[House S'sril]] was one of Menzoberranzan's founding Houses, though a total lack of heirs and inheritors led to the house's extinction. Before the founding, it was normal in Menzoberranzan for each House to teach only their own children. House S'sril, seeing that this practice led to numerous different interpretations of [[Lolth]]'s teachings, believed that the founding of Arach-Tinilith would increase the quality of clerics and divine spell casters in [[Menzoberranzan]].\n [[File:Arach-Tinilith.jpg|thumb|The great chamber of worship inside Arach-Tinilith.]]\nIn [[1372 DR]], the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, [[Quenthel Baenre]], was attacked at the school by a number of demons intending to assassinate her. A number of novice priestesses and even instructors led by [[Drisinil Barrison Del'Armgo]] believed that Quenthel had lost the favor of Lolth, and thus they planned to murder her. Quenthel discovered their plot and summoned hordes of spiders to kill them and demonstrate that she was in her goddess's favor (although that was during the [[Silence of Lolth]]). In truth, unbeknownst to her, the demons had been sent by her brother, [[Gromph Baenre]], the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]].\n\nIn [[1469 DR]], members of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] infiltrated and tampered with the graduation ceremony. It caused a large number of [[demon]]s to be summoned, who then ran amok causing heavy damage, not only to the temple's structure but also in a lot of lives.",
