        "mainbody": "The '''Gauntlet of Shar''' was an enormous underground temple dedicated to the dark goddess [[Shar]] and a training ground for the [[Sharran]] faithful. It was the birthplace of the elite Sharran force, the [[Dark Justiciars]].\n{{Quote|It speaks of the ordeals to be overcome, and of the armor-clad fist of Lady Shar that would embrace the worthy. Survive the crushing gauntlet, and be embraced by the Nightsinger at its very core.|[[Shadowheart]].}}",
        "Location": "The Gauntlet of Shar lay in an [[Underdark]] cave beneath the [[Thorm Mausoleum]], which was located in northwest corner of the town of [[Reithwin]]. The entrance was hidden behind a mural describing the tragic life and loss of [[Ketheric Thorm]]. A platform elevator in the shape of a Sharran disk would take the visitors from the surface world to the dark depths.\n\nAn alternative entrance to Gauntlet of Shar was using the platform elevator in the [[Grymforge]]. However, this passage was sealed and destroyed when orthon [[Yurgir]] came to slaughter the dark justiciars.",
        "Function": "The Gauntlet of Shar was the sacred crucible for determining the most faithful Sharrans, those who wanted to fully dedicate themselves to Shar and become her implements in inflicting the goddess's wrath upon enemies and in restoring her eternal darkness.\n\nThe initiates would undergo several trials to test their strength, wisdom, and flexibility. With each success, they would be granted an umbral orb to unlock the path forward. When they were deemed worthy in every trial, the initiate would use the orb to unlock the way to the inner chamber of the temple. In there, they would make their final preparations and make the most glorious sacrifice in Shar's name to ultimately become a Dark Justiciar.",
        "History": "The temple was built at Ketheric Thorm's command when he served as Shar's [[Chosen]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. After Ketheric turned his faith from [[Selûne]] to Shar, he and his advisor [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]] deceived Ketheric's former colleague [[Aylin]], the immortal daughter of Selûne, into going into the [[Shadowfell]]. They trapped Aylin with infernal chains and a soul cage. Aylin became a ritual sacrifice to Shar for the completion of faithful Sharran transformation into Dark Justiciars. The Gauntlet of Shar was built up around Aylin's prison and Aylin was killed and revived to be killed again for years.\n\nWhile the Dark Justiciars were fighting an alliance of [[Harpers]] and [[Emerald Grove]] [[druid]]s on the surface world in the later 14{{th}} century DR, an [[orthon]] mercenary [[Yurgir]] came to the temple to kill the remaining Dark Justiciars by the terms of a contract. All the inhabitants of the Gauntlet of Shar were slaughtered except a Dark Justiciar named [[Lyrthindor]], who escaped with help from [[Raphael]]. Yurgir couldn't find the last Dark Justiciar, nor could he leave the temple without breaking the contract. So Yurgir made his lair within the empty temple. After that, the temple was abandoned and fell into ruin for the next century with the later coming of the [[shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]] .\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Balthazar was tasked by Ketheric Thorm with retrieving the Nightsong to secure Ketheric's immortality while Ketheric served as the general of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Balthazar and his undead servants managed to get into the long-abandoned temple, but they were prevented from venturing forward by Dark Justiciar ghosts manifested from the Shadowfell.",
        "Inhabitants": "* [[Yurgir]], an [[orthon]] who was contracted by [[Raphael]] to slaughter every Dark Justiciar, but was trapped within the temple by the terms of the unfinished contract.\n* [[Nessa (displacer beast)|Nessa]], Yurgir's [[displacer beast]].\n* [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]], the necromancer advisor of Ketheric Thorm who came to retrieve the [[Nightsong]].\n* [[Flesh]], Balthazar's meat [[golem]]. \n* [[Lyrthindor]], the last Dark Justiciar who escaped from Yurgir by turning into a swarm of [[rat]]s.\n* [[Aylin|Nightsong]], the immortal daughter of Selûne who was trapped in shadowfell and made as a sacriface for dark justiciars."
