        "mainbody": "Lionheart was the secret command base of the Council of Admirals of the Elven Imperial Navy. While its location was changed every few years to avoid attacks from enemies, it was sometimes located near one of the asteroids of Garden in Realmspace.\nLike many elven bases of wildspace, Lionheart was composed of a ring of elven armada class spelljammers whose wings were fused together. The entire ring of armadas shared the same gravity plane and air envelope (atmosphere). Crops were grown on the upper platform formed by the ring of wings, and these replenished the air and provided food for the bases inhabitants. Lionheart was one of the largest such bases.\nAt the center of the ring of armadas was a disk-shaped structure that contained the blue and silver meeting chamber of the Council of Admirals.\nLionheart was controlled by the Council of Admirals, who were themselves headed by the Grand Admiral.\nIn 1362 DR, Vallus Leafbower and the current Grand Admiral here discussed what to do with Teldin Moore, the bearer of the Cloak of the First Pilot.\n* Serin Ghar"
