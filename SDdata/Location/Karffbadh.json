        "mainbody": "City\nKarffbadh was the capital of one of the satrapies of the ancient Jhothûn Empire of giants.\nThe city of Karffbadh once sat on the tip of a penisula extending west from what would later be called Icewind Dale.\nWhile once a great city, by 1372 DR, all that remained was a shrine of five green standing stones. These stones acted as a portal to Choshein, a sister city of the Empire, and to the capital of Jhothûn. Activating the portal required simply touching one of the stones. The default destination was Choshein, but one could travel to the city of Jhothûn by speaking its name. When activated, a web of green energy appeared among the stones, and persons could step into this web of energy to be transported to one of the other cities. When the destination was changed to Jhothûn, the web was purple in color. As late as 1372 DR, the portal was still functioning, yet its power was dangerously weak, and it could only be activated once a day. Sometimes, it flickered just as one was stepping into the energy web, which would cause the user to plummet into a sinkhole located in the middle of the stones.\nKarffbadh was once ruled by a satrap, who served the emperor of Jhothûn with the assistance of the princes of Jhothûn, who were each qorrashi advisers.\nKarffbadh , along with Choshein, Gharreil, and Jhothûn, was one of the four major cities of the Jhothûn empire.It is suspected that Jhothûn was itself a part of the empire of Ostoria, but this is never directly stated. It was the capital of the western province.\nThe city was once populated by the ancestors of the frost giants, who, with the help of the qorrash, developed great magics, even shaping the weather to remain cold to their liking.\nIn 1372 DR, an evil orc druid, Thurghom, and his dire polar bear companion, Bahgkôm, guarded the portal, believing it to be a holy site."
