        "mainbody": "Treeroot was a small gnome village in Faer√ªn.\nTreeroots history was largely uneventful, apart from a period of time, sometime before 1372 DR, when the village faced trobles from goblin raids. Thankfully, the gnomes of Treeroot eventually laid their hands on a crudely-crafted enchanted club - the Big Board with Nail. The weapon bore magics that made it very effective against goblinoid opponents. For a long while, the club served as a symbol of leadership for the folk of Treeroot. The weapon was eventually lost in a bloody goblin raid on the village."
