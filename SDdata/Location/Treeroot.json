        "History": "Treeroot's history was largely uneventful, apart from a period of time, sometime before [[1372 DR]], when the village faced trobles from [[goblin]] raids. Thankfully, the gnomes of Treeroot eventually laid their hands on a crudely-crafted [[enchanted]] [[club]] - the ''[[Big Board with Nail]]''. The weapon bore magics that made it very effective against goblinoid opponents. For a long while, the club served as a symbol of leadership for the folk of Treeroot. The weapon was eventually lost in a bloody goblin raid on the village."
