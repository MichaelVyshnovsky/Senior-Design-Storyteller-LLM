The '''Clothiers' District''' was the center for all industry revolving around cloth in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Located within the [[Clothiers' Quarter]], this district was by far the most aromatic part of Huzuz. Harsh smells from tanneries and boiling [[dye]]s infused the air of the Clothiers' District with their pungent aroma. 

The [[Agricultural Promenade|Farmers'Road]] and [[Clothiers' Way]] ran north to south along the east side of the Clothiers' District, separating it from the [[Peasants' District]]. A small section of the [[Road to Enlightenment|Enlightened Way]] touched the southern section of the Clothiers' District. To the north sat the [[Northwest District]].

==Activities==
Cloth, silk, and [[linen]] was produced in this district then sold to tailors or embroiderers who made finished products.

==Notable Features==
Many prominent merchant houses owned property within the Clothiers' District, including:

* the [[House of Al-Kamari]]
* the [[House of Al-Thuria]]
