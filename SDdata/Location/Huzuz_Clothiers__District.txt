The Clothiers District was the center for all industry revolving around cloth in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Located within the Clothiers Quarter, this district was by far the most aromatic part of Huzuz. Harsh smells from tanneries and boiling dyes infused the air of the Clothiers District with their pungent aroma. 
The FarmersRoad and Clothiers Way ran north to south along the east side of the Clothiers District, separating it from the Peasants District. A small section of the Enlightened Way touched the southern section of the Clothiers District. To the north sat the Northwest District.
Cloth, silk, and linen was produced in this district then sold to tailors or embroiderers who made finished products.
Many prominent merchant houses owned property within the Clothiers District, including
* the House of Al-Kamari
* the House of Al-Thuria
