        "mainbody": "sagang was a city in Tabot.\nIt stood in northern Tabot, just south of the Kun-Yen Shan, between the forests and river there. A road ran west to Shentsa.\nWhen soldiers of Shou Lung invaded Tabot in , the priests and the barbarians were forced to ally against them. Led by the great sohei Ramara and Baron Ohn of Han Chao, they repelled the Shou in the Battle of Tsagang.\nAfterward, Ohn and Ramara negotiated for ten days and established the Peace Land Treaty between the tribes and the monks. It legitimized the monks hermitages (now mountain keeps) and gave them a role in the defense of the lowland tribes and thereby cemented land and peace. Together, they founded a new city—Tsagang—at the place of their victory and founded the new nation of Tabot. All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word."
