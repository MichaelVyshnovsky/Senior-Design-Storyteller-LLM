        "Geography": "It stood in northern Tabot, just south of the [[Kun-Yen Shan]], between the forests and river there. A road ran west to [[Shentsa]].",
        "History": "When soldiers of [[Shou Lung]] invaded Tabot in {{YearlinkConvert|646|SY}}, the priests and the barbarians were forced to ally against them. Led by the great sohei [[Ramara]] and Baron [[Ohn]] of [[Han Chao]], they repelled the Shou in the [[Battle of Tsagang]].\n\nAfterward, Ohn and Ramara negotiated for ten days and established the [[Peace Land Treaty]] between the tribes and the monks. It legitimized the monks' hermitages (now mountain keeps) and gave them a role in the defense of the lowland tribes and thereby cemented land and peace. Together, they founded a new city—Tsagang—at the place of their victory and founded the new nation of Tabot. All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word."
