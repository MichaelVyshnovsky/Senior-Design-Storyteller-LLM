'''Balanzia''' was a dead city in [[T'u Lung]].

Founded in [[422 DR]], Balanzia was once one of the largest cities in all [[Kara-Tur]], thanks to its easy access to [[Zastrasai Bay]] and the [[Straits of Va'shung]], as well as its great sea wall and its magnificent towers. However, in [[1118 DR]], a wandering wise man named [[Loarru|Loarru the Just]] came to Balanzia, advising that the city would fall, but nobody listened. However, during the invasions by Shou Lung forces, the walls were weakened step by step until in [[1153 DR]] the great [[Shou]] [[wu jen]] [[Moia Chun]] opened the final hole in the wall. The people went insane with fear and in less than a month the city became deserted.<ref>
