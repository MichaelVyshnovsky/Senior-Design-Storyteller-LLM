It was inhabited by wild tribes of [[humanoid]]s such as [[orc]]s and [[ogre]]s that were constantly at war with one another.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: The Tribes of Thar}}",

            "Climate": "Thar was bleak and windy, and was highly unsuitable for growing crops."

        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Some areas of Thar held rich deposits of [[gem]]s.",

Above them in the food chain were smaller predators such as [[fox]]es and [[wolves]], along with predatory birds like [[kestrel (bird)|kestrels]], [[shrike]]s, [[falcon]]s, and the magnificent [[steppe eagle]].\n\nIt was the home of the [[Tharurr]] breed of [[horse]], the name meaning \"Thar's horse\" in the [[giant language]]."

        "Society": {
            "Religion": "The worship of [[Vaprak]] was predominant among the ogre tribes of Thar, as they believed tolerating his cruelty would allow them the strength to rule over the land once more.",

        "Trade": "Despite its reputation as a dismal wasteland, a number of important caravan routes crisscrossed across the plains of Thar. Adventurers, scouts, and guides were regularly found accompanying these caravans to ensure safe passage.",
        "History": "From {{YearlinkName|-981}} to {{YearlinkName|-350}}, the region that would eventually be known as Thar was part of the [[minotaur]] kingdom of [[Grong-Haap]], ruled by [[Haask, Voice of Hargut]], during which time the region enjoyed a comparatively high level of civilization.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep}}\n\nLater, [[Vorbyx]] founded the ogre kingdom of Thar.\n\nThe Tharkuls of the realm, referred to by outsiders as ogre-kings, would continue to rule over the land for nearly 1500 years.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|400}}, the [[Dark Alliance]] of malevolent [[humanoid]]s from Thar attacked and destroyed [[Northkeep]], sinking it below the waves of the [[Moonsea]].\n\nThe [[elven]] [[archmage]] [[Abarat]] began construction of his ivory tower in Thar during the {{YearlinkName|669}}, with the hopes that it would serve as a bulwark against the malevolent forces of the lands beyond. \n\nThe terrible [[Battle of the Masks]] brought out on the plains of Thar in the {{YearlinkName|1259}}, between the [[Masked Wizards of Ankhalus]] and the [[Zhentilar]].\n\nThe human kingdom of Thar was established in the {{YearlinkName|1288}}, when [[Beldoran]] slew [[Maulog]] the last Tharkul of the ogre kingdom of Thar. The human kingdom fell after a mere 15 years, in the {{YearlinkName|1303}}, after an army of ogres threatening the [[Citadel of the Raven]] were re-routed to sack [[Phlan]] by the [[Zhentilar]].\n\nWhen the [[Flight of Dragons]] occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, many rampaging [[dragon]]s flew south from Thar and wreaked havoc on the lands of the Moonsea.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[lich]] [[Aesperus]] controlled the undead of eastern Thar. Around that same time, the [[orog]] warlord [[Larga Bloodhand]] rose to some level of prominence, at least until she angered the [[red dragon]] [[Throstulgrael]] and became stranded by her minions.{{Cite adventurers league/Raiders of the Twilight Marsh|20}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Legends stated that the great lost kingdom of ogres was formed by the legendary Vorbyx, who united many tribes together and enslaved the land's orc population.
