The '''Chultengar''' referred to a branch of the main jungle of [[Chult]] that encroached on [[Thindol]] and [[Samarach]].

==Geography==
The Chultengar lay between the [[Luo Peaks]] in the north and the [[Sanrach Mountains]] to the south. The rain forest swept east to the doorstep of [[Narubel]].

==Inhabitants==
Tribes of [[pterafolk]], each ruled by a single [[spirit naga]], were the dominant lifeform within the Chultengar. Other species present included [[wild dwarves]], [[wyvern]]s, and [[batiri]].

==Activities==
The spirit nagas met with three [[ha-naga]]s on a yearly basis somewhere within the dense Chultengar. They called themselves the [[Conclave of Spirits]].
