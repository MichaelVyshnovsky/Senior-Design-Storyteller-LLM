Beldargan was a small town in the southern Border Kingdoms in the midâ€“14 century DR. It was an independent city-state completely surrounded by the Barony of Blacksaddle.
The town was located on the northern edge of the Shaar, in the southwest section of the Border Kingdoms. The town was built on the slopes of Beldargans Mount, a hill that rose  out of the surrounding grasslands. Geothermal springs were found on Beldargans Mount, and a network of caverns was found underneath, some deep enough to connect to the Underdark.
The town was governed by all landowners in the town, as a council. They held council in the towns keep, Beldargs Folly, a single square tower located on the summit of the Mount.
Beldargan maintained many orchids of green apples, which provided the town with several export items. Wine and a potent cider were made from the apples, and an apple sauce was sold locally. Roughly 300 of the towns residents lived in the Horn Meadows, the grasslands surrounding the town. They lived on farms and many were sheepherders.
There was a single inn located in the town, The Drowned Witch, found on the eastern side of Beldargans Mount. It was owned and run by Enderl Dalvin and served as not only the towns inn, but as a barn for the towns mounts and a rooming house for hired mercenaries.
The town was surrounded by a thick, tall ring of thorny hedge maze, with three gates that allowed access to the town. These gates were heavily fortified, with drop spikes and arbalests. In exchange for tax forgiveness, a militia was maintained by up to forty of the towns households. During periods of increased raids from the Shaar, or when Blacksaddle harassed the townsfolk, mercenaries were hired.
