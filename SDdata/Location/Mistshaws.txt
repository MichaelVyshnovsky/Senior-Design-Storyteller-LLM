Mistshaws was one of the "Royal Keeps" of Eskorn in Laerakond.
Located near Hargleth Forest, Mistshaws was renowned for its talented singers, minstrels, and instrument-makers. Hunting for sport and food in the forest was particularly good near Mistshaws, and its local hunters often hired adventurers to deal with monster problems or outlaws.
As of 1479 DR, Mistshaws had become a center of vandalism and banditry, and the locals often accused the wealthy families of hiring outsider bandits and ruffians, although there was no solid proof to back those claims.
