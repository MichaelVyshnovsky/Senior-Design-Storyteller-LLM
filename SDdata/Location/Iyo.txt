'''Iyo''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Iyo was a modest farming village of a hundred buildings, predominantly serving as a community of cultivators for the [[Tsu family|Tsu]] estate, within which it was located. 

==Trade==
The village sustained a limited number of craftsmen, with the majority being carpenters.

==Government==
As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the zussho of the [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']] was [[Otsabe Kanchi]].

==Defenses==
Otsabe Kanchi commanded a small group of two [[samurai]] retainers and ten [[bushi]]. Notably, the loyalty of these men lay with Otsabe Kanchi personally, rather than with the Tsu family. This arrangement underscored the individual influence and authority held by Kanchi within Iyo.
