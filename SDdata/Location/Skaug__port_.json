        "mainbody": "Skaug was a harbor town on the island of Skaug in the Nelanther Isles and was one of the few permanent settlements in the island chain.\nThe port was home to the largest dockyards in the island chain. Able to handle forty visiting ships, the port welcomed and catered to pirates and privateers. In addition, the fifteen ships that made up the Skaug Corsairs always had a place at port as the citys primary defenders.\nIt was founded by Captain Skaug around 1170 DR using the stolen lumber and supplies carried in his three ships.\nIn the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, during an event known as Halasters Higharvestide a juggernaut formed from shipwrecks by wild magic terrorized the port.\nA few notable locations, mostly taverns, existed on the island as of 1370 DR\n* The Crows Nest Cliffs Watch points on several nearby islands were manned by scouts, each watching over a sea lane that led towards Skaug. Blowing the magical horns equipped there also sounded the larger horn located in the city. Different signals gave early warning to the port on ships closing in on the port.\n* The Corsairs Docks The private docks of the Skaug Corsairs, separated from the main docks of the island.\n* Maliceprow Manor The largest building on the island. Set into a hill on the east side of the port, the manor was fortified with stone walls and a gate. The manor consisted of a main house, stables, servants quarters, guest house, and armory. Each of the buildings was constructed out of stone, a rare building material for the island.\n* Asavirs Launch A well-kept inn and festhall that started inside of the hull of a beached ship. Additional floors were built up between the masts.\n* The Apple Barrel A tavern that specializes in the apple brandy distilled at the attached Appleheart Distillery.\n* The Crossbows A three-story gambling hall, boarding house, and festhall.\n* The Keelhaul A popular tavern with no-nonsense clientele. Troublemakers were seized by bouncers and patrons and thrown into a central well that magically propelled them out of the building and into the harbor nearly  away.\n* The Gibed Sail A filthy tavern with worse drinks."
