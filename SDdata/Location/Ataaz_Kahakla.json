        "mainbody": "Ataaz Kahakla, meaning Gorge of Death in the Chultan language, was a canyon on the River Tath in Chult.\nRanging in height from 50 to 200 feet (15 to 60 meters), the cliff face was lined with many rows of coral. Although dead, the coral kept its colors, making for a multicolored display that seemed as if the cliff was underwater. Amidst the coral were also whole skeletons of sea creatures, including giant sharks and plesiosaurs. It was an awe-inspiring sight.\nThe River Tath passed through Ataaz Kahlaka as it turned sharply west to empty into Jahaka Bay between the Mistcliff Mountains to the north and the Kobold Mountains to the south.\nThe jungle along the gorge was home to dinosaurs, including triceratops, as well as massive flocks of parrots. The waters were home to crocodiles.\nPacks of pterafolk were known to attack travelers within the gorge.\nNear the northern exit of the gorge dwelt the \"guardian of the river\" a particularly ornery plesiosaur which tried to prevent anyone from crossing."
