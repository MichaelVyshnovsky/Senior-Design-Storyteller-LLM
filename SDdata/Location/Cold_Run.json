        "mainbody": "The Cold Run was a large stretch of frigid tundra that ran from the mouth of the Iceflow to Icewind Dale.\nThe region, which spanned from the Iceflow up to Icewind Dale, was almost always deadly cold. However, in the peak of summer, the Trackless Sea often brought fairly warm winds.\nLong ago, part of the Cold Run was struck by either a heavy meteor strike or the lava of a volcanic eruption. This formed a huge crater, which was filled with rich ore. Miners moved in to the area and established Fireshear.\n* Ironmaster\n* Fireshear\n* Auckney\nThe native inhabitants of the region were the Ice Hunters. When the Northlanders \narrived in the region, their expansion drove the natives even further up the Cold Run.\nTundra yetis were known to roam around the Cold Run, as well as wolves and reindeer."
