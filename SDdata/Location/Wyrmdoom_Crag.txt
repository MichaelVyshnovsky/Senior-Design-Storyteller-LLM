'''Wyrmdoom Crag''' was a [[goliath]] settlement nestled within the [[Spine of the World]] mountains in [[the North]]. It was home to the warm and outgoing [[Thuunlakalaga]] clan.

==Description==
The caverns of Wyrmdoom Crag were carved within a tall mountain, with a cave mouth that faced the north.

Wyrmdoom Crag featured a central sleeping chamber, encircled by a number of caves that served other functions. The settlement's leader, [[Ogolai Thuunlakalaga|Chief Ogolai]], and a few other venerated warriors had private chambers that branched off to the east.

"The Crawl" was a chamber that featured a small tunnel with walls that were inscribed with a number of [[rune]]s, an important site for goliaths that were about to come of age.

In the innermost chamber of Wyrmdoom Crag was a wide and open feasting hall.

==Geography==
It was located among the western slopes of the Spine mountains, some ways southwest of the [[Reghed Glacier]].

==Government==
As with other goliath settlements, Wyrmdoom Crag was led by a single chieftain.

==Relations==
The Thuunlakalaga goliaths were very welcoming to outsiders, save for the goliaths of the [[Akannathi]] clan.

==History==
Shortly after the settlement's founding, a [[white dragon]] called [[Stygiarus]] assaulted the goliaths at their home. Unfortunately for the dragon, it greatly underestimated the clan's strength and was defeated and slain.

==Rumors & Legends==
Word about Stygiarus's death and remains spread as far away as the [[Ten Towns]]. The scholar [[Dannika Graysteel]] sought out these [[dragon]] bones for the formulation of a potent stew with magical properties.

==Inhabitants==
In addition to the goliaths, a small number of [[chwinga]]s dwelled in and around the caves of the crag.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Aruk Thundercaller Thuunlakalaga|Aruk Thundercaller]], the clan's healer.
* [[Kapanuk]], a young hunter who was lost by his people.
* [[Sikki-kree]], an [[aarakocra]] who was sheltered by the goliaths after being caught in a blizzard.
