'''The Hinjaz''' was a stone formation in [[Raurin]], not tall enough to be mountains, but taller than any other hills. They were impassable from the ground.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|31}}

==Overview==
The black rock grew too hot, even for the best of climbers, and the wind continuously scoured the stone peaks with sand. The [[Durpar]]i airlancers' [[pegasi]] often used the updrafts created by the excessive heat to gain altitude around the Hinjaz.
