        "mainbody": "he Sargauth Enclave was the name some scholars used for the Netherese outpost on the third level of Undermountain, but the actual name of this place was lost over time.\nIt was created around  by an order of powerful wizards from Netheril to serve as a safe haven for conducting magical experiments, but after a decade it had grown into a city of about 1 square mile (2.6 square kilometers). The River Sargauth flowed through this magical place and it was the only route to the outside world, through the South Seacaves.\nWhen the archmage Karsus caused the fall of Netheril in the , there was a powerful surge of magic into the Enclave and the protective mythal-like Mantle malfunctioned. The enormously high ceilings of its caverns were supported by the Mantle instead of columns or pillars, and the disruption of this magic caused a collapse that destroyed and engulfed about two thirds of the enclaves structures. Anything left uncovered was vaporized, but the skulls of thirteen of the wizards would survive, magically transformed into the Skulls of Skullport."
