        "History": "It was created around {{Yearlink|-800}} by an order of powerful [[wizard]]s from [[Netheril]] to serve as a safe haven for conducting magical experiments, but after a decade it had grown into a city of about 1 square mile (2.6 square kilometers). The [[River Sargauth]] flowed through this magical place and it was the only route to the outside world, through the [[South Seacaves]].\n\nWhen the [[archmage]] [[Karsus]] caused the fall of Netheril in the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, there was a powerful surge of [[magic]] into the Enclave and the protective ''[[mythal]]''-like [[Mantle (Sargauth)|Mantle]] malfunctioned. The enormously high ceilings of its caverns were supported by the Mantle instead of columns or pillars, and the disruption of this magic caused a collapse that destroyed and engulfed about two thirds of the enclave's structures. Anything left uncovered was vaporized, but the skulls of thirteen of the wizards would survive, magically transformed into the [[Skulls of Skullport]]."
