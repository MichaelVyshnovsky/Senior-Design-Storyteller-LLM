        "mainbody": "'''Ahtitlak''' was a village located in the [[Alpuk]] region of the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "Unlike most [[Ulutiun]] settlements, the residents of Ahtitlak did not live within [[Ulutiun dictionary#M|minikitaks]] or [[Snowhouse|snowhouses]]. In fact, the hardy villagers did not use any sort of structure to sleep in. Instead, they slept in the cavern around a large communal fire, using wolf-skins as bedding.",
        "Geography": "Ahtitlak was located in the south-eastern corner of Alpuk, entirely within a massive cavern along the western tip of the [[Lugsaas Chain]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81-82}}",
        "History": "Around [[359 DR]], the [[Ulutiun dictionary#U|urit]] of a community in [[Nakvaligach]] received a [[Ulutiun dictionary#K|kaiurit]]. The edict commanded the small village to migrate far to the south, where they were told a physical manifestation of [[Ulutiu]] would appear. When they arrived at their destination, they discovered a massive cavern inhabited by remorhazes. Since the villagers had never heard of or seen remorhazes before, they assumed the remorhazes were the physical manifestation of Ulutiu and decided to settle within the cavern.\n\nThe remorhazes began killing the villagers, decimating their population. Despite this, the villagers continued to offer food and water to the remorhazes, even protecting them from predators such as [[tirichik]]. Gradually, the remorhazes began to trust the villagers and a bond was formed, which held ever since.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Glacier had continued its centuries-long retreat northward, freeing Ahtitlak from the ice for the first time.",
        "Inhabitants": "The villagers of Ahtitlak were harsh and did not trust outsiders, even other Ulutiuns. They attacked anyone trespassing in their territory without mercy. They were unique among residents of the north, in that they had a peaceful and symbiotic relationship with the [[remorhaz]], who shared their cavern with them. \n\n[[File:Ahtitlak Resident.png|alt=A resident of Ahtitlak attacking with a remorhaz companion.|thumb|''A resident of Ahtitlak attacking with a [[remorhaz]] companion.'']]\nThe remorhazes treated the villagers as trusted companions, defending the village and its residents. The villagers provided food and water, treated any wounds a remorhaz received with a special poultice, and built fires to keep their eggs warm. The villagers developed a unique saddle made from leather that allowed them to ride the remorhazes, which allowed them to patrol their territory."
