The River Quarter, also known as the Rivermans Quarter, was one of the wards that made up the small riverside town of Daggerford. It was home to a number of long-standing businesses and guildhalls, as well as the personal residence to those residents that worked at the Delimbiyr River docks.
This quarter of Daggerford was located on the southern side of town, between the Drill Field and the towns stables.
On the southeastern side of Rivermans Quarter was the River Gate. Just beyond the gate was Tyndals Bridge, which was named after the legendary Tyndal who originally built the towns Ducal Castle. Over the bridge and across the moat was the towns somewhat small port, which included a few docks and some waterfront structures.
Ships traveling upriver along the Delimbiyr often stopped at Daggerford to unload their cargo. Dockworkers spent much of their time transferring these goods so they could be moved north or south along the High Road.
Other vessels merely passed through town, en route to the many small holds located along the banks of the river, or further down to the town of Secomber.
