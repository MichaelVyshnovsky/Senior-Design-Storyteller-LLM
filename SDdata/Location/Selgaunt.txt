"Coinheads" (derogatory by Urmlassans)
Selgaunt (), formerly known as Chancelgaunt, was a large merchant port on the Sea of Fallen Stars and the capital of the nation of Sembia following the destruction of Ordulin in the late 14 century DR.
The city earned its newer name following the death of the great Sembian merchant-king Selgar, who had been interred beneath an ornate sepulcher within the city.
Selgaunts most notable feature was the design of its impressive buildings and intricately decorated homes. The city was teeming with grand castles, temples, brownstone tallhouses, marketplaces, emporia, and beautiful mansions. All were surrounded by parks, topiaries, statuary, decorative pools, and a wide variety of complex fountains. The citys crown jewel was the Palace of the Hulorn, with its numerous spires seen from afar. The Hunting Garden was the Hulorns private wildlife preserve enclosed by tall, well-guarded walls. It was only accessible to the Hulorn, the royal family, and guests of the Palace. Appropriately, the luxurious mansions of the citys old noble families, referred to as the Old Chauncel, were built in the district that surrounded Hulorns Palace. Many of the grand structures in Selgaunt were built using imported quarried Yhauntan stone.

Possibly the wealthiest city on all of Sembia, Selgaunt was an exciting metropolis that featured the high fashions, pageantry, and brashness that was so often found in the Eastern Heartlands. The Selgauntans viewed themselves as the epicenter of sophistication and saw their city as the heart of civilization in all the planes of existence.
Selgaunt had a rich and active community of artists, dancers, and musicians. New performances of plays, highlighted by
choreographed dances and choral arrangements, were regularly put on within the city. Paintings, sculptures, and carved statues were readily available throughout the city, were highly prized, and often exported in trade with other cities.
Music was especially prevalent throughout the city, as most Selgauntans could artfully sing and whistle complex melodies. Live performances could often be found in taverns, inns, and the houses of noble families. Glaurs, zulkoons and thelarrs were popular instruments during the mid-14 century. Nobility of Selgaunt had constantly changing fashions. Events such as pastorales were popular summer activities. One year, pastorales consisted of noblewomen dressed in what they thought were commoners clothing. They played pretend to be simple rustics at lavish farms while listening to minstrels performing songs about the countryside and manual labor.
To keep track of time, Selgaunt employed a small army of hour-callers who loudly proclaimed hours on the city streets. Additionally, Milils Temple of Song had a huge bell that tolled hourly.
Sembia, Selgaunt especially, was a capital of fashion and luxury. Women of noble birth could be seen wearing sophisticated coiffures with dyed highlights of striking colors, assembled by the best hairdressers of the city. Even the simplest clothes in design were created using the finest cambric and sarcanet. Red lips dyed with fucus was a fashionable type of make-up.
Selgauntans, especially the rich and noble, were quite fond of imported wines, such as Berduskan Dark and Arabellan Dry. Domesticated fowl was a part of local food culture, luxurious dishes such as nut-roasted goose were served at the nobles social events. Foods, fried in red pepper oil, were quite common. Fruit like sunmelon and grape were consumed as well. Grapes were dried into raisins, while sunmelon rind was a food found in taverns and served along with many other small bite-sized treats, such as ruth-balls. Among simpler foods, Selgauntans ate chicken stews, breads, and huge amounts of soft sharp goat cheese.
Selgauntans cookery had one curious quirk. The term "dice" was used to describe a uniform shape and quantity of butter, while it was referred to kitchen knifework in other parts of the world. Dice meant a cube of butter of the same shape and size as the gaming dice. To accommodate this measurement system, most butter sold in Selgaunt was packaged in long fingers, pre-marked for ease of measuring and cutting.
The citizens of Selgaunt saw those from the Sword Coast in the west, northerners from the Dalelands and North Faer√ªn, and that southern-folk from the Dragon Coast down to the Lands of Intrigue as filthy, barbarous savages. They thought worse of the people of Calimshan, as they were pretentious on top of everything else. They saw the kingdom of Cormyr as adorable country bumpkins who, despite their "royal" family, lacked proper breeding and sophistication.
They even looked down on the other cities of Sembia as disadvantaged, depressing collectives Ordulin was unfortunately insignificant, full of small-time merchants who were too busy counting their meager coins, and Saerloon was a tired, apathetic city that was well past its prime.
The combined city guard/armed forces were known as Scepters. They were 9,000 strong during the mid-14 century and maintained a strong fleet of three dozen ships. Scepters were outfitted in black leather armor, green cloaks, and silver-hilted swords.
