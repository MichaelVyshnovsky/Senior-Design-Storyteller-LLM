        "Government": "In the mid–14{{Th}} century [[DR]], Ilinvur comprised about 6000 residents and was governed by a [[Wizard|mage]] installed jointly by [[Melvaunt]] and [[Thentia]] who was assisted by twenty heavily armed Keepers of the Peace. In the event of a major [[orc]], [[flind]], or [[ogre]] attack, the leader could report to Melvaunt and Thentia via ''[[crystal ball]]''.\n\nIn the late–15{{Th}} century DR, the settlement comprised  only 250 residents—mostly [[human]], with several dozen [[dwarves]] and a family of [[gnomes]]. The village then existed under the protection of [[Phlan]] and was governed by a diarchy, with one leader responsible for defense and the other for administration. The settlement had no formal military, but could raise a militia from among the community in times of need.",
        "Trade": "[[File:Dungeon177-Ilinver-Mike Schley.png|thumb|''Map of Ilinvur and vicinity, ''circa'' 1480 DR.'']]\nIlinvur's main export was metal mined from the [[West Galena Mountains]], which was smelted into bars and loaded onto caravans of [[rothé]]-pulled sledges for transport elsewhere, usually to be traded for food.\n\nBy nature of the settlement's location between the [[Moonsea]] to its west via the [[Ilinvur Trail]], [[Vaasa]] to its east via [[Garumn's Climb]], and the [[Great Glacier]] and far-off reaches of the [[Moonsea North]] to the its north via the [[Way of the Powrie]], Ilinvur was a crossroads and stopover for adventurers and merchants excited to seek and to sell treasures from these disparate places.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81-82}}",
        "History": "Ilinvur spent much of its existence as a client to powers on the Moonsea, including Melvaunt, Thentia, and Phlan. After the rise of the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]] in the 15{{Th}} century DR, the settlement saw increased trade flowing to and from the east, but the people remained wary of the intentions of the Warlock Knights.\n\nIn the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, the town and the surrounding country underwent waves of attacks from [[barbarian]]s and [[elemental]]s originating out of the [[Tortured Land]]s. Much of the village was burned down and effectively abandoned, with many of its people seeking refuge by fleeing east to [[Avang]] or south towards Phlan.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|49}}",
        "Notable Locations": "As of 1480 DR, the town was a small collection of two-story bungalows spread out around the town square. Most shops and merchants operated out of stalls in the town square, which had been built around a great fire pit that kept the merchants warm in the cold northern climate.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|69}} An establishment called [[The Pick]] was the village's only inn and served also as its sole tavern. No temples existed within the settlement, but shrines could be found dedicated to [[Bane]], [[Gond]], [[Tempus]], and [[Selûne]]."
