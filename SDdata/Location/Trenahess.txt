'''Trenahess''' was a [[human]] village in [[Cormanthor]], about {{SI|80|miles|k|long=yes}} west of [[Myth Drannor]], on the banks of the [[River Ashaba]].

The [[green dragon]] [[Verthandantalynx]], also called Verdant Cloud, lived in the area and the people of Trenahess worshiped him, nicknaming him "Little Verthie". The villagers offered up visitors and treasures to Little Verthie, who defended them from monsters and other communities.

==History==
On [[Uktar 13]], the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the Verthandantalynx was affected by the [[Rage of Dragons]] and attacked the village, laying it to waste.{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|71}}
