        "mainbody": "The Central Plains was a more-temperate region of Rashemen in the center of the cold and inhospitable country. It housed a scattering of homesteads of the Rashemaar people.\nThe atmosphere of the plains varied wildly depending on the time of year. Its beautiful was highlighted by vibrant wildflowers during the summer months, contrasted with the bare, snow-covered scenery that appeared in winter.\nLike the weather, the various species of animals that appeared in the plains differed greatly depending on the season. During the warm months all manner of critters such as mice and voles ran across the grassy plains, along with predatory animals like foxes, coyotes and wolverines.\nDuring the coldest time of year, droves of reindeer and caribou journeyed across the snow, drawing out wolves from the nearby High Country. On rare occasions, ice trolls and even white dragons ventured down from the cold peaks to raid the human settlements."
