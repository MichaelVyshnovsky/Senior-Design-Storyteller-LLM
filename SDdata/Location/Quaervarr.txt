Quaervarr (also spelled Quaervaar located in the southern part of the Moonwood near Heralds Holdfast. 
Quaervarr started out as a logging camp, but grew to be a small town that both tended and logged the trees of the Moonwood with great care.
In Silverymoon it is joked that Quaervarr is valuable in the alliance just to preserve its fine inn, the Whistling Stag.
