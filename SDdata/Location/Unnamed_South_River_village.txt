This village was a small [[elf|elven]] settlement located along the [[Tun River]] in the [[Tunlands]] of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
This unnamed elven village stood on the southwestern shores of the Tun River, west of [[Skull Crag]] and just south of the [[Tun Marshes]]. The river brought a cool refreshing breeze to the town, as well as giant crocodiles from upstream. The local population was known for its sharpshooting skills, with regular archery competitions taking place, open exclusively to the residents.

==History==
In the early 1360s [[DR]], the elven village became the target for the [[lizarfolk]] tribe, allied with a group of young [[black dragon]]s. The village started being attacked by the scaled forces from the nearby Tun Marshes. Subsequently, the monsters dealt some significant damage to the town, leaving it in a bad state of disrepair and vulnerable to continued assault. Despite their best attempts, elf and human archers failed to stop the attackers while the defenders slowly mounted the losses. A band of adventurers who were aiding Skull Crag in the time of need arrived just in time to stand with the village's defenses against yet another lizardfolk, dragon, and [[giant crocodile]] assault. Once the village was safe, the group ventured into the swamp in search of the lizardfolk camp{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}}

==Notable Locations==
The village had a trader of various goods, including some elven magic times, a humble but busy tavern, and a boathouse, closed to outsiders. Those unwise to break in were faced with elven [[ghost]]ly spirit guardians. The village had at least one shrine open to visitors, dedicated to the goddess [[Lliira]]. The town's harbor was littered with fishing boats and fishers who used [[net]]s to haul in the catch.

The town was also the site of the Grove of the Holy Ones, a local landmark where the benediction of the gods ceremony took place. Locals sold tickets to the event..

==Inhabitants==
The village was a mostly elven settlement, inhabited by some [[bow]]-wielding humans. The elven population kept a tight social group, while some inhabitants thought the south river region was not the same since the [[hin]] had left across the mountains.
