'''West [[Zakhara]]''' was a giant peninsula that contained the arid plateau of the [[High Desert]], populated by nomadic tribes, in the north, and the wealthy [[Pearl Cities]], centers of trade, in the south.<ref>

==Geography==
The only land connection to the rest of the Land of Fate lay towards the [[North Zakhara|north]], where the edge of the [[Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue]] met the area around [[Qudra]]. Otherwise, west Zakhara was surrounded by water: the [[Great Sea]] with the mysterious land of [[Akota]] to the west, the [[Crowded Sea]] with the archipelagos of [[Al-Sartan]] and [[Nada al-Hazan]] to the [[Southwest Zakhara|south]] and [[South Zakhara|southeast]]. Towards [[interior Zakhara]], the [[Golden Gulf]] and the [[Cities of the Pantheon]] beyond lay to the east, [[Suq Bay]] and the [[Cities of the Heart]] to the northeast. [[Al-Tariq Channel]] and the [[Sea of Caravans]] were the waters to the north.

Except at the Cities of the Pearl, the borders of west Zakhara were made even more pronounced by a series of elevations, [[Al-Suqut Mountains]], the Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue, the [[Spine of the Dog]], and a long ridges of hills along Suq Bay.

==High Desert==
{{Main|High Desert}}
One of Zakhara's two large deserts, the High Desert provided enough vegetation for a number of [[Al-Hadhar]] tribes to raise their livestock, though they had to stick to oases and wells during the height of summer. The central [[Genies' Anvil]] was forbidding even for these hardy nomads, it was the domain of [[House of Sihr|a tribe]] of [[jann]].<ref>

==Pearl Cities==
{{Main|Pearl Cities}}
Beyond the [[Range of the Marching Camels]] to the south lay the Cities of the Pearl along the western shores of the Golden Gulf and the Crowded Sea. Trade, mainly in luxury goods, was paramount here, giving rise to many rich merchants but also leaving large parts of their population pennyless.

The young City of Wonders, at the mouth of [[Al-Malja River]], had a frontier location and attitude as the westernmost of the Pearl Cities. It's wealth was based on growing and trading [[coffee]] and other luxury products.<ref>

===Gana===
{{Main|Gana}}
The City of Riches, located where [[Al-Sabiya River]] flows into [[Gana Bay]], is indeed rich from their produce of [[pearl]]s and [[frankincense]]. It is also famous for the [[Festival of the Pearl]], raucously celebrated each year.<ref>

===Jumlat===
{{Main|Jumlat}}
The crowded City of Multitudes, at the mouth of [[Al-Fatir River]], depended heavily on pearl diving for its income. Only a small class reaped the profits, leaving many of the inhabitants in poverty.<ref>

===Sikak===
{{Main|Sikak}}
The City of Coins, at the mouth of [[Al-Nuhas River]], gained its wealth by fishing the teeming sea between its mainland coast and [[Maribar Island]]. Its people were informal as far as appearences were concerned, but distrustful of foreigners.<ref>

===Tajar===
{{Main|Tajar}}
The City of Trade, at the mouth of [[Al-Adib River]], lay at the crossroads of a number of different areas of Zakhara, and haggling and trade of the widest variety of goods defined the life of its inhabitants.<ref><ref>
