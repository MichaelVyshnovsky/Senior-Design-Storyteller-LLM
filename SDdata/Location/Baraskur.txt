'''Baraskur''' was the mountainside stronghold of the [[Ripped Gut]] [[orc]] tribe during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The cavernous fortress of Baraskur was built in memory of a great [[orc]] [[Baraskur (orc)|hero]]. It stood on a slope of the [[Nether Mountains]] at the end of a rough path that flanked a precipice. The fortress was located on the southern flank of the [[Orcsblood Peak]] between [[Deadsnows]] and [[Sundabar]].

==Inhabitants==
Orc raiding parties from Baraskur infested [[Moon Pass]], [[Turnstone Pass]], and [[Fork Road]].

The orcs were haunted by the [[ghost]] of [[Aumathra]], a [[human]] [[sorcerer]] that cohabited with the Ripped Gut orcs centuries before the [[Time of Troubles]]. When her spirit was restless, it would possess the body of women who had been gathered by the orcs. They would select someone that both shared her physical likeness, as well as her talent for [[arcane]] spellcasting. In the time that she chose to possess her host bodies, Aumathra would command the Ripped Gut orcs as if they were her slaves.
