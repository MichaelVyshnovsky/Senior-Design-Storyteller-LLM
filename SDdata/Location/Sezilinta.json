        "mainbody": "ezilinta was a large city in Durpar in the Shining Lands in 1367 DR.\nThis city was located on the northern coast of the Golden Water about halfway between Adamas Tooth and the eastern edge of the Giants Belt Mountains.\nSezilinta possessed docks, but they were much smaller than those of the other cities found on the Golden Water.\nSezilinta was home to 17,000 inhabitants. Given the close proximity to the extensively-mined Giants Belt Mountains, many metalworkers could be found in Sezilinta, processing mined iron and silver ore. Plenty of farm workers and weavers were kept busy with the large cotton fields found north of the city, producing flax and refining it into linen."
