        "mainbody": "he main Westfront holding cell was a jail cell in Castle Obarskyr.\nIt was clean, dry, and well-lit. There were chains from which people could be dangled.\nAfter Storm Silverhand, Marchioness of Immerdusk, Arclath Delcastle, noble heir of House Delcastle, and Amarune Whitewave, a mask dancer, were finally captured by Glathra, they were left in the Westfront holding cell. They were then rescued by a hidden Elminster Aumar, then in the form of a pile of ashes, controlling the War Wizard Welwyn Tracegar and having Mirt procure a carriage to hide the three of them."
