        "mainbody": "The '''Chasm''' was a huge canyon-like crack amid the southeastern district of [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "The Chasm occupied what was once the districts known as the [[Beggar's Nest]] and the [[Arcanist Quarter]], that were destroyed during the cataclysm that followed the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]]. Because of that, the surrounding areas were in utter ruins, a maze of destroyed buildings and clotted streets.\n\nThe Chasm proper was big, covering almost all of the central part that once was the Arcanist Quarter central area, and many [[earthmote]]s floated amid and around the abyss, some drifting slowly and others bashing against the walls of the Chasm or against each other. The Chasm was also deep, reaching down to a lake located in the [[Underdark]].\n\nThe land within the Chasm proper was warped and twisted because of the [[plagueland]] located below Neverwinter. Storms of elemental energy and other strange phenomena could surge up from the depths without warning at any moment.",
        "Inhabitants": "All manner of [[plaguechanged]] creatures dwelt in the earthmotes and on precipices and caves in the walls of the abyss. In the lake at the deepest part of the Chasm, a cell of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] had their headquarters.",
        "History": "[[File:TheChasm.jpg|thumb|300px|The Chasm, around 1479 DR]]\nDuring the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], when the catastrophe struck Neverwinter, a small plagueland was created in the Underdark below Neverwinter. In the following decades, a branch of the Abolethic Sovereignty became interested in cultivating and studying this plagueland.\n\nWhen [[Ruining|Mount Hotenow erupted]] in [[1451 DR]], bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the Beggar's Nest and the Arcanist Quarter were completely destroyed by the earthquakes that followed the cataclysm. A huge, canyon-like chasm replaced most of the districts, and released the foul energies of the Spellplague, as well as the plaguechanged creatures living there. The survivors of the catastrophe built a [[The Wall (Neverwinter)|wall]] to better protect themselves against the monsters.\n\nThe Chasm was [[magic]]ally sealed around [[1485 DR]], although at such cost to the city's coffers that some of its outer walls still lay in ruins and several of its neighborhoods remained abandoned by [[1491 DR]]. Even as of [[1496 DR]], telltale signs of plagueland, including blue fires and warped reality, could still be observed above the sealed Chasm.",
