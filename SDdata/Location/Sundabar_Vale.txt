Sundabar Vale was a large river valley of the Silver Marches.
Sundabar Vale was the part of the region of Old Delzoun that lay south of the Rauvin Mountains. The Nether Mountains were its southern border. In the east, the valley joined with Adbar Run at the Fork.
Sundabar Vale was a large bowl almost 60 miles in diameter, surrounded by a ring of mountains. The River Rauvin began in the Rauvin Mountains and flowed through the Vale,
The valley was one of the most populated regions of the Marches, especially within the vicinity of Sundabar. It contained many settlements and small keeps, though they thinned out as one traveled east along the Fork Road, and few were located west of the river.
