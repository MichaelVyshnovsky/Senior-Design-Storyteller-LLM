'''Nimlith''' was a small fishing community on the island of [[Evermeet]], consisting of around 200 non-magical wooden structures and inhabited mainly by [[moon elves]] (silver elves).

==Fishing==
The fisherfolk of the town caught [[hake]], [[salmon]], and [[whitefish]] from the waters west of the island.

==Governance==
As of [[1368 DR]], the town was led by Lady [[Ialantha Rumithamal]], a cousin of Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]].

However, as of [[Alturiak]], [[1374 DR]], the town was governed by Lady [[Ammisyll Veldann]], a member of the [[Council of Evermeet]].

==Notable features==
The town was home to the [[Holy Ground]] tavern, and also the mage [[Kavrala Nightsong]].
