        "mainbody": "Electropolis was a major city on the distant world of Pangaea. It was noted for the presence of the Chemcheaux 1 magic shop and its owner, Prismal the Outrageous.\nSome time during the equivalent 13 or 14 centuries DR on Toril, one of the government officials of Electropolis was horribly cursed by Prismal, who had been tricked by his business partner Mortimar, prompting an immediate search for Prismal. While hiding at Chemcheaux 1, Prismal faked his death and handed over ownership of the Chemcheaux business to Mortimar, who then arrogantly revealed his manipulations. Prismal responded by using Prismals revenge on Mortimar, reducing him to a shambling wreck. Seeking a release from his torment, Mortimar falsely claimed that he had cursed the Electropolis official, and was relieved to be executed a few days later. Prismal then publicly emerged and suffered a 60-day jail sentence for faking his death and falsifying government records."
