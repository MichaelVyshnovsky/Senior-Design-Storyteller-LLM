'''Dracowyr''' was an [[mote|earth mote]] that floated five miles above the [[Great Wild Wood]] in [[Murghôm]]. Near the center of the mote was a castle-like building carved into the landscape. Dracowyr was used as a neutral ground where the [[Princes of Murghôm]] and other foreigner [[dragon]]s celebrated meetings and other events relevant to [[dragon]]kind.

As of [[1479 DR]], the mote was guarded by a [[dragonborn]] named [[Ananta]]. 

==History==
In 1479 DR, Dracowyr became the neutral ground of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]''. Dragons reunited there to discuss the rules or to consult Brimstone in affairs related to the game.

==Notable inhabitants==
* [[Ananta]]
* [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]
