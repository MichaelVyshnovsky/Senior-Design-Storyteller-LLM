Dracowyr was an earth mote that floated five miles above the Great Wild Wood in Murghôm. Near the center of the mote was a castle-like building carved into the landscape. Dracowyr was used as a neutral ground where the Princes of Murghôm and other foreigner dragons celebrated meetings and other events relevant to dragonkind.
As of 1479 DR, the mote was guarded by a dragonborn named Ananta. 
In 1479 DR, Dracowyr became the neutral ground of Brimstones xorvintaal. Dragons reunited there to discuss the rules or to consult Brimstone in affairs related to the game.
