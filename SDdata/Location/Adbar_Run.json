        "mainbody": "dbar Run was a large valley of the Silver Marches.\nAdbar Run was the part of the region of Old Delzoun that lay north of the Rauvin Mountains. In the east, the valley joined with Sundabar Vale at the Fork.\nAdbar Run was a wilderness in the truest sense of the word. It contained no permanent settlements between the Cold Vale and the Fork.\nOrcs and goblins from the nearby mountains could sometimes be found here. There was also a chance of running into a rare patrol from either the Red Tiger or Sky Pony Uthgardt tribes."
