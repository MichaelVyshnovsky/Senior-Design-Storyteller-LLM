The '''Teshyllal Wastes''' were the desert wastelands surrounding the ruins of the ancient city of [[Teshyll]].<ref name=EotSS-p79/>

==Geography==
The Teshyllal Wastes were the central region of the [[Calim Desert]]. Howling noises could often be heard over its barren lands, most likely the calls of the spirits of [[Calim]] and [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]], who were defeated and imprisoned there.<ref name=EotSS-p79/>

The Wastes contained a [[fey crossroad]] that linked to [[Herkemon's Hub]] on the western banks of the [[Lake of Steam]].

==History==
Once known as the '''Teshyllal Fields''', the Teshyllal Wastes formerly contained lush and productive farms. The city of Teshyll was at its core, serving as a farmers' market. After the imprisonment of Calim and Memnon in around {{Yearlink|-6100}}, the area grew barren and became one of the most dangerous regions of the Calim Desert.<ref name=EotSS-p79/>

==Notable inhabitants==
The [[undead]] [[blue dragon]] [[Sapphiraktar]] laired below the Teshyllal Wastes.<ref name=EotSS-p79/>
