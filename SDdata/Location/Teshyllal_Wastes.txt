The Teshyllal Wastes were the desert wastelands surrounding the ruins of the ancient city of Teshyll.
The Teshyllal Wastes were the central region of the Calim Desert. Howling noises could often be heard over its barren lands, most likely the calls of the spirits of Calim and Memnon, who were defeated and imprisoned there.
The Wastes contained a fey crossroad that linked to Herkemons Hub on the western banks of the Lake of Steam.
Once known as the Teshyllal Fields, the Teshyllal Wastes formerly contained lush and productive farms. The city of Teshyll was at its core, serving as a farmers market. After the imprisonment of Calim and Memnon in around , the area grew barren and became one of the most dangerous regions of the Calim Desert.
The undead blue dragon Sapphiraktar laired below the Teshyllal Wastes.
