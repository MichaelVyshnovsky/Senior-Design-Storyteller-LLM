Shepherds Valley was a small and obscure community that consisted of halflings and gnomes that existed as early as 881 DR.
Shepherds Valley had its watch broken into Day Watch and Night Watch with the captains of each passing along the item that was the villages main claim to fame, the Helm of the Trusted Defender.
Shepherds Valley was mainly known for the magical helmet usable only by gnomes and halflings that was created there. Eventually, more than four hundred years after it was created, the helmet found its way to an unlikely place, Kuldahar of Icewind Dale.
