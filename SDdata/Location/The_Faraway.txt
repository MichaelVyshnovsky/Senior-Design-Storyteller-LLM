The '''Faraway''' was a great forest in [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].{{Cite polyhedron/98/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: More Hidden Powers of Turmish|25}}{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|24}}{{Cite polyhedron/105/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: More Fabled Treasures of the Land of Turmish|7}}

==Geography==
A vast wood, it spread over much of central western Turmish, at the southeastern foot of the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. A steep slope ran down from the [[Allascar]] valley to the Faraway. The forest's eastern fringe ran close to the village of [[Illowwood]], with its own dense stand of [[shadowtop]] trees.

==History==
During the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]] in the {{yearlinkName|1347}},<ref> several members of the [[Lions' Dynasty|royal family]] escaped [[Tethyr]] and somehow made it to [[The Five Lions]] inn. However, they were followed by rebels, who killed them in the Faraway woods.
