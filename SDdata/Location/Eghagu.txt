'''Eghagu''' was a small village located in the [[Alpuk]] region, within the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
Eghagu was located northeast of the [[Shistak Pass]] in the [[Keryjek Ridge]].

==Layout==
The village was built in the center of a stone ring {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} in height. This wall of stone protected the village, with its crude snowhouses, from the harsh climate common to the [[Great Glacier]].

==Inhabitants==
The village of Eghagu has developed an unsavory reputation due to the activities of its residents. The inhabitants of the village conducted raids on neighboring settlements, stealing [[caribou]] and roamed the countryside as bandits, ambushing travelers. They have even trained [[kupuk]] and [[winter wolves]] to attack targets.

==History==
Around [[1260 DR]], a group of citizens of [[Lilinuk]] were exiled for plotting to murder the [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''iquemelum'']]. These exiles joined together with similarly banished [[Angulutiun]]s from [[Hupik]] and founded the village.
