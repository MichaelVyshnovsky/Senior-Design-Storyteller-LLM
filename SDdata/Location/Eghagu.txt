Eghagu was a small village located in the Alpuk region, within the Great Glacier.
Eghagu was located northeast of the Shistak Pass in the Keryjek Ridge.
The village was built in the center of a stone ring  in height. This wall of stone protected the village, with its crude snowhouses, from the harsh climate common to the Great Glacier.
The village of Eghagu has developed an unsavory reputation due to the activities of its residents. The inhabitants of the village conducted raids on neighboring settlements, stealing caribou and roamed the countryside as bandits, ambushing travelers. They have even trained kupuk and winter wolves to attack targets.
Around 1260 DR, a group of citizens of Lilinuk were exiled for plotting to murder the iquemelum. These exiles joined together with similarly banished Angulutiuns from Hupik and founded the village.
