The '''South Wood''', also known as the '''Southwood''', was a forest within the [[Triangle of Trees]] in the [[Savage Frontier]]. It was one of the satellite woodlands that were collectively called the [[Moonwoods]] by some local folk.

==Description==
The forest was relatively young, but still dim and foreboding. It contained the same varieties of [[tree]]s as the [[High Forest]].

It was a popular stomping grounds for the outdoorsmen of [[Gray Vale]].

==Geography==
The South Wood was nestled into the western region of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] just north of [[Highstar Lake]]. It served as a border between the Gray Vale to the north and the [[High Moor]] to the south.

==History==
During the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[treant]] [[Turlang]] sought to restore the [[High Forest]] to where it reconnected with the South Wood.

==Inhabitants==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, it was populated by a large tribe of aggressive [[goblin]]s. They attacked caravans&mdash;creating an abundance of work for guards and [[adventurer]]s&mdash;and frequently stole everything from supplies to cattle to children from [[Loudwater]] and the outlying farms. Their presence made woodcutting a dangerous risk, but one that some daring lumberjacks still took on.

The forest was home to a group of [[ghost]]s that hunted spectral [[boar]]s that appeared among its trees on certain nights. This event inspired the name of the [[Nighthunt]] inn.
