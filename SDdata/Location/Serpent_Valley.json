        "mainbody": "The '''Serpent Valley''' was a river valley lying east of [[Doegan]] in the [[Utter East]].",
        "Description": "A tortuously winding river snaked through the Serpent Valley, deep amidst the untamed hills. All around, the land was marshy or swampy, leaving islands and patches of firmer ground within the loops of the river. The land was green and fertile.",
        "Inhabitants": "Here, beefy, club-wielding [[troll]]s stood their ground and [[giant snapping turtle]]s lurked in the river. [[Roc]]s also made their great nests by the water.\n\nSome bandits and hardy folk lived in the Serpent Valley, building pleasant-looking thatched roof cottages and farms, but life was rigorous and desperate, with mere survival the top priority.",
        "Reputation": "The Serpent Valley was known as a hard and fearsome place, where bandits laired, the most enduring survivalists made their homes, and only the bravest dared trespass. The river was thought dark and mysterious.",
        "History": "During the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]),<ref group=\"note\">The events of ''Blood & Magic'' are only dated to \"before the [[Time of Troubles]]\" ([[1358 DR]]) in game. It is assumed these are a part of the Bloodforge Wars described in ''[[Faces of Deception]]'' and dated in ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]''. the Serpent Valley was the site of [[bloodforge]] battles waged between [[Rathgar the Raider]], conqueror of [[Doegan]], and [[Aelric the Avenger]], who sought to liberate the realm, in the [[Howl of Vengeance]] conflict.\n\nLater, the Serpent Valley was the hideout and mustering area of the infamous brigand and bloodforge mage [[Wenda Wildeye]]. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] came to put an end to the banditry.\n\n[[Haden Stonehand]] made a home in the Serpent Valley. The leader of the Legendary Campaign, who aimed to unify the Utter East through conquest, returned to challenge Haden in a contest of bloodforge warfare.\n\nFinally, [[Newt Longscar]] mustered and trained a bloodforge army in the Serpent Valley to fight against the advancing leader of the Legendary Campaign. The leader tried to strike first before Newt was fully prepared and established."
