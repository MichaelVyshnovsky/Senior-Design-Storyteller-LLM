Finding him absent in his cottage, they murdered his wife [[Zia]], but not before she hid her infant daughter [[Kira]] in a secret compartment. When Edgin came home, he found Zia dying. The tragic loss led him to quit the Harpers. However, they would soon be joined by [[Holga Kilgore]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref>\n\n[[Naerth Maxildanarr]], a [[rogue]] from Luskan, arrived in Targos ''circa'' [[1487 DR]] and based himself in the Luskan Arms inn. He bought influence among the town's fisherfolk with his [[coin]] and a show of down-to-earth charm, and by [[1489 DR]] had quickly risen to the Speaker's position after the previous person apparently tired of the role.

His agent [[Skath]] meanwhile led the militia.\n\nWhen [[Auril]] the Frostmaiden descended onto Icewind Dale in the {{yearlinkName|1488}}, spreading her unending winter, Naerth, together with the Speakers of Bryn Shander and Easthaven, took the drastic step of holding monthly lotteries to determine who of the inhabitants was to be sacrificed to the Cold Goddess. At dusk before the new moon, the ill-fated person picked in a lottery held that afternoon was stripped off and cast into the freezing tundra to die of exposure. Accusations of rigged lotteries were frequent, but ignored. In any case, those thought to have cheated the lottery were slain by the [[undead]] assassin [[Sephek Kaltro]] with a blade of ice in the heart; a human shipbuilder of Targos was one such victim. Under the tyranny of the goddess, Targos faced the harshest of winters. The bigger boats of the fleet were frozen in the docks, leaving fishing to be done by smaller boats dragged over the ice and limiting the food supply dramatically. \n\nFinally, in the winter of the {{yearlinkName|1489}}, this period of strife culminated in an attack by a rampaging [[chardalyn dragon]], a creature forged out of black ice by [[Xardorok Sunblight]] and unleashed to destroy each of the Ten Towns. With Naerth's personal spy network alerting him to the attacks on the other towns, Targos had time to muster its militia and ready siege weaponry, though invisible [[duergar]] sabotaged these defense and murdered townsfolk. Fortunately, the creature was defeated by a group of adventurers and the efforts of the militias of the Ten Towns.<ref group=\"note\">In ''Rime of the Frostmaiden'', the chardalyn dragon's rampage proceeds depending on PCs' actions, with it destroying towns in sequence. Since Targos appears in ''Honor Among Thieves'' and is the home of the protagonists before, during, and after these events, it could not have been destroyed, and was likely not even attacked. Nevertheless, in the worst-case scenario, Targos's buildings are destroyed, half the people are slain and half escape to Bryn Shander, and the militia makes a last stand in front of the Luskan Arms inn, but does the most damage to the dragon.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves - Targos winter.png|thumb|left|350px|''Edgin and Holga have a frosty return to Targos.'']]\nIn the early 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Targos became the base of a trio of thieves: Edgin Darvis, Holga Kilgore, and later Kira. In Targos, they robbed a pawn shop whose owner they suspected to be a member of the Zhentarim and made a smash-and-grab robbery of a jewelry store, simply breaking the window with a rock and making off with the jewels.",
        "Geography": "The city sat on the southernmost shore of the [[Maer Dualdon]], Paths linked Targos to [[Bremen]] (3 hours on foot), [[Bryn Shander]] (2 hours), and [[Termalaine]] (4 hours), the latter running around Maer Dualdon.",
        "Description": "[[File:Wolf's pelt inn - targos.png|thumb|left|100px|''A view from the Wolf's Pelt Inn to the harbor.'']]\nTargos was a sprawling town with uncluttered streets. The buildings had breathing space, being separated by wide avenues. While the inhabitants were used to the sense of privacy provided by these spacious accommodations, they gave off a feeling of solitude for those not used to the town's life.\n\nThis, however, changed by the mid-1480s DR, when Targos became abuzz with commerce and industry that brought the city's expansion. The newer inhabitants started to construct shacks beyond the city's wooden walls and the town threatened to grow beyond them before long.<ref>\n\nUnlike Bryn Shander, Targos's nights were quiet as the fishers went to bed early, in order to be ready for the next day's early rise. During the day, the Targosans focused on getting the job down and minding their own business, rather than that of everyone else.\n\nThe travel time for a merchant caravan between Luskan and Targos was approximately twenty-one days via the [[Ten Trail]].",
        "Government": "Though Targos and the rest of the Ten Towns were resolutely independent and competitive with one another, they did maintain a council with a spokesperson from each town to manage affairs affecting them all. Typically, in the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the smaller towns would follow the lead of Targos and Bryn Shander.",
        "Symbol": "The heraldic symbol of Targos in the late 15{{th}} century DR was a black ship with a single sail and heading right, on a field of light blue. This was emblematic of how proud Targosans were of their fishing fleet.",
        "Defenses": "[[File:Icewind Dale II artwork.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A battle against goblins on the palisade during the Legion's siege in 1312 DR.'']]\nThe town and much of the harbor was surrounded by a wooden defensive wall, called the palisade. Together with [[Bryn Shander]], Targos was the only other of the Ten Towns to be walled. It had historically protected Targos from both barbarian and [[orc]] raids and other dangers from the wilds. The wall was extended over Maer Dualdon, to form a safe harbor. The timbers used were [[fir]]s from [[Lonelywood]].<ref>\n\nThe town was patrolled and defended by the [[Targos Guard]],This is a range for all ten towns; the specific figure for Targos is unknown. ''circa'' 1358 DR. They were outfitted with [[light armor]] but dwarf-crafted [[weapon]]s. ''Circa'' 1489 DR, it comprised 200 militiamen and 16 veteran soldiers, led by [[Skath]]. ''Circa'' 1312 it was led by [[Shawford Crale]] and ''circa'' 1489 DR by Captain [[Skath]].\n\nEccentric [[gnomish]] tinkerer [[Oswald Fiddlebender]] was briefly an aerial scout for the guard in the early 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Trade": "[[File:Targos docks IWD2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Ships at the docks of Targos on the shores of Maer Dualdon in 1312 DR.'']]\n[[File:Lighthouse of Targos.png|thumb|right|250px|''The lighthouse of Targos.'']]\n[[File:Targos 1312DR.png|thumb|right|250px|''The lighthouse at sunset.'']]\nThe harbor's deep water allowed the construction of vessels that were large for the area. As a result, Targos always enjoyed the largest fishing fleet, the best boats, a safe harbor, the most skilled sailors and fishers, and consequently the greatest catches. It thrived off and dominated the local fishing industry more than any of the Ten Towns. Like most of the Ten Towns, Targos specialized in trading [[knucklehead trout]].\n\nIn the early 1300s DR, it already dominated the local fishing industry and took more knucklehead than any other town. In the late 1400s DR, it faced off competition from Easthaven (whose growth had stolen trade from Targos and Termaline<ref>) by focusing on its strengths in fishing\n\nAlmost everyone in Targos was connected in some way to the fishing industry and the core work of bringing in the knucklehead catches. Specialty craftsmen and traders provided supplies and equipment for fishing and sailing. The [[Dockworker's Guild]] of Targos was active ''circa'' 1485 DR. This was the only guild in the Ten Towns and spoke for the loaders, shipwrights, and warehouse workers. It sought expansion to the other towns to grow Targos's influence.",
        "Relations": "Built on the same lake, Targos and Termalaine were traditional rivals for fishing, oftentimes bitter, with fishers exchanging rude remarks and nasty glares when passing each other in the water and even getting into brawls, on rare occasions even leading to deaths. Disputes over fishing waters, crossed lines, blocked courses, bumped boats, scared fish, and poached catches were all causes for conflict. Their antagonism and suspicion of one another prevented them from cooperating long enough in any effort to improve the Ten Trail south to Bryn Shander.<ref>",
        "History": {
            "14{{th}} Century DR": "{{fq\n| text   = Uncle Oswald said that Maer Dualdon was full of sunsets that day. So many ships coming up the Shaengarne had been set aflame by the goblin hordes that they burned to the waterline in a row like a flock of fiery geese. Some leapt overboard and tried to swim to shore, only to be cut down by orcs when they arrived. Others clung to the hulking infernos and were inevitably consumed in the flames. The rest dropped into the icy deep, snowflakes off death's shoulders as he shrugged over the dale.\n| source = Maralie Fiddlebender's account of the Legion's siege\n| float  = left\n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, gnomish tinkerer Oswald Fiddlebender's airship crash-landed in Targos after setting the northern side of the town ablaze with a collection of [[potion]]s that spilled off his flying ship. After that, together with his niece and assistant [[Maralie Fiddlebender]], the gnome briefly settled in Targos, brewing potions and scouting the valleys of Icewind Dale for the Targos Guard. \n\nLater the same year, Targos was besieged by the [[goblinoid]] forces of the [[Legion of the Chimera]], which sought to destroy the Ten-Towns. The Targos Guard built fortifications outside the town by disassembling buildings in Targos's harbors, but [[goblin]]s infiltrated by breaking into old smugglers' tunnels (which the Targos Guard had previously collapsed) and the basements of houses. The then ruler of Targos, Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]], called for soldiers, mercenaries, and adventurers from Luskan and [[Neverwinter]] to join the defense of the town. But the Legion's forces attacked and burned many of the arriving ships as they sailed up the Shaengarne, with only a few, like the ''[[Wicked Wench]]'', making it safely to port with a group of adventurers from Luskan aboard. With the help of these adventurers, the town rooted out the goblins and survived several waves of attacks on the palisade, and dealt with other internal issues.\n\nIn the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the councilman of Targos was [[Kemp]], who led the town through an assault by the [[Tribe of the Elk]] [[barbarian]]s in the {{yearlinkName|1351}} and the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]] triggered by [[Akar Kessell]] and [[Crenshinibon]] in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}. while others hid and barricaded themselves within their homes, preferring time and the elements to take the lives of the savage invaders. However, a few took up arms and actively fought Kessell's minions. One of these defenders was the \"[[Old Scout]]\", the father of [[Pilot Demitrick]]. He, along with three trusted comrades, carried out guerrilla strikes on Kessell's forces, targeting patrols and supply caravans. After three days of this, to find out who was responsible, Akar Kessell tortured several citizens of Targos, and then captured Pilot's mother to force the Old Scout to surrender himself. Once he had them, Kessell killed them both as an example of his tyrannical will. Eventually, the siege was broken by the [[Companions of the Hall]], who slew the evil wizard and destroyed the Crystal Tower. The Battle of Icewind Dale left Targos with an entire district of the city incinerated and blackened by the killing beam from Kessell's [[Crystal Shard|crystal tower]]. The area was later known as the \"Ash Quarter\". though fortunately missed the ships where they lay in the harbor.\n\nDuring his term as the Speaker, Kemp was distrustful of outsiders and guarded his town's interests greedily. Kemp was still the Speaker of Targos as of [[1364 DR]].\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Wanted: A group of skilled men-at-arms to accompany a merchant into grand adventure in the city [of] Targos in exotic Icewind Dale.
