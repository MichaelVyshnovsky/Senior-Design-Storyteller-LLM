        "mainbody": "Duthcloim, also known as Manyfolk, was a district in the drow city of Menzoberranzan.\nThe district of Duthcloim surrounded the Bazaar and the Clawrift, a huge chasm in the center of the city. Its narrow streets were filled with shops and three-story tallhouses carved from stalagmites. Patrols deterred most open crime.\nDuthcloim was known for being the most colorful, diverse, and tolerant district of the city. It was home to many merchants and family houses (both noble and commoner). Nearly all drow commoners in Menzoberranzan lived in or had originated in Duthcloim. Many noble houses maintained secondary (often secret) houses in the district. Many non-drow lived in this district and were generally treated peaceably by all but noble-born drow, but they were not allowed to openly worship any deity but Lolth.\nDrow living in the neighboring district of West Wall, which had few (if any) shops, preferred to shop in Duthcloim.\n*House Auvryndar\n*House Oblodra Located on a cliff face between two \"fingers\" of the Clawrift.\n* Bluirren Makers of sausages.\n* Darnruel\n* DelHluanter\n* DelYgana\n* DoIlisharr\n* Drael Tuabbar\n* Klendara\n* Queltlarn\n* Ulaver Makers of a sweet green wine.\n* Alessras Couches Massage house.\n* The Black Gloves Massage house.\n* Bluirrens Fine Sausages Butcher.\n* The Cathlyre Aviary to purchase surface-world birds for pets, targets, or fine roasts.\n* Faeeras Floating Plants Exotic plants and flowers from the surface and below.\n* Gaussauns Coins.\n* Jhulayes Legendary Caresses Massage house.\n* Maelchyras Massages Massage house.\n* Nullfein Stables Stables.\n* Orlarbryns House Massage house.\n* The Pampered Drow Massage house.\n* Rhauvais Arms Exotic weapons (especially concealed and envenomed weapons for nobles).
