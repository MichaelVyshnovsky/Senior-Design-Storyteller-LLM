'''Teuveamanthaar''' was the capital of [[Eaerlann]].  

==History==
It was founded in {{Yearlink|-4550}} among the ruins of [[Aryvandaar]] in the northern and eastern sections of the [[High Forest]]. It was built on a steep-sided ridge among tall oak trees. The dwellings were said to be constructed in the trees themselves among the hollows and branches.

In the [[882 DR|Year of the Curse, 882 DR]], Eaerlann fell as a result of the fall of [[Ascalhorn|Hellgate Keep]] to [[demon]]s and this city was abandoned. However, followers of [[Mielikki]], [[druid]]s, took refuge in a fraction of the city and secured it against [[orc]]s and demons. Later, the settlement was known as [[Tall Trees]] and the inhabitants were the [[Druids of Tall Trees]].
