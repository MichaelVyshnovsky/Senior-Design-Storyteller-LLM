Tsarn Tombs was a hilly region near Scornubel, which held an old burial ground.
The region was full of rolling hills, and was bordered on the north and east by a forest. There was a brook close by, and roads to the west that led to the water. One of the hilltops had a number of standing stones, serving as tombs. There were mountains northwest and northeast.
In , Tessaril Winter led Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith to Tsarn Tombs through the Tombgate. Sharantyr later teleported there with a token, and was in turn attacked.
One of the graves had been painted with a message reading "Beware the Dead Walk", not yet weathered beyond legibility as of late .
