Dungar was a small town in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR.
The town stood among rolling hills on the trade route between the coastal cities of Lapaliiya and the Talath Pass to Halruaa.
Around 1373 DR, the town was ruled by members of a local family who claimed descent from the famous bandit lord Felingar.
The civic deity of Dungar was Chauntea.
It was a farming town focused on growing olives and producing wine, with many olive groves and vineyards surrounding the community.
It had a population of 931 people, most of them farmers.
Felingars crypt was buried somewhere under the hills around Dungar. It was said to hide Felingars stolen fortune, namely the dowry of a chansreena (princess) of Ormpur.
