        "Dedryk's ominous statement upon being apprehended}}\nThe caves were used by the [[Wheloon]] escapee [[Dedryk Black]], who had gathered up a sizable cult of [[Sharran]]s that he treated as his flock. Their existence was discovered when a group of Cormyrean hunters stumbled across the cultists in the woods, who fled in a panic and dropped their [[holy symbol]]s of Shar. This drew the interest of the Magistrates [[Abella Toth]], [[Celia Pendrick]], and [[Barthold Moncrief]] in [[Eveningstar]], who investigated from there. Abella Toth in particular hired [[adventurer]]s who had traveled from [[Eberron]] to search the area, and after some intense fighting Dedryk and his closest followers had been captured and prepared for transportation back to Wheloon.": "=Inhabitants==",

Inside, the cave was partially fitted with furnishings, with various gates and traps installed to slow down intruders. It was also fitted with two altars to Shar, with a particularly large cavern serving as the main shrine and focus for their operations.",
