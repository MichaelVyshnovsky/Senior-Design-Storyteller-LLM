        "mainbody": "A secret Sharran hideout was hidden in the foothills of the Cormyrean Storm Horns, home to many Sharrans and the infamous Dedryk Black.\n300px|thumb|A blocked path in the hills.\nThe approach to the hideout was prepared with tree-blocked paths, traps, and groups of Sharran defenders. Inside, the cave was partially fitted with furnishings, with various gates and traps installed to slow down intruders. It was also fitted with two altars to Shar, with a particularly large cavern serving as the main shrine and focus for their operations.\nThe hideout was located some distance east of the Starwater River, in the forested lower foothills of the northern Storm Horns.\n300px|thumb|The entrance of the hideout.\nThe caves were used by the Wheloon escapee Dedryk Black, who had gathered up a sizable cult of Sharrans that he treated as his flock. Their existence was discovered when a group of Cormyrean hunters stumbled across the cultists in the woods, who fled in a panic and dropped their holy symbols of Shar. This drew the interest of the Magistrates Abella Toth, Celia Pendrick, and Barthold Moncrief in Eveningstar, who investigated from there. Abella Toth in particular hired adventurers who had traveled from Eberron to search the area, and after some intense fighting Dedryk and his closest followers had been captured and prepared for transportation back to Wheloon.\n300px|thumb|The main chamber of the hideout.\nThe caves and surrounding hills were home to wild wolves and mountain lions. To support their defenses, Dedryk Blacks followers summoned air and ice mephits to fight alongside them, and kept caged wolves as guard dogs. The Sharrans also kept a large owlbear penned up in the hopes of using it as a weapon, though it proved to have no loyalty for them, only hunger."
