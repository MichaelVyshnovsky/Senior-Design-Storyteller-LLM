'''Hudid''', also called the "'''City of Humility'''", was one of the [[Cities of the Pantheon]]. It was famous for its trade in exotic goods and for featuring the most important university in all of Zakhara.

==Geography==
Hudid was located between [[I'tiraf]] and [[Mahabba]], where [[Al-Jama River]] flowed into the [[Crowded Sea]].<ref>

==Trade==
In addition to trading widely, Hudid produced glass lenses and telescopes. Hudid was a favorite spot for foreign traders to sell their exotic wares.

==Inhabitants==
Renowned for having the greatest university in all of [[Zakhara]], many viziers and even Prince [[Cheddah al-Assad]] came to Hudid for their education.

==Defenses==
The [[Sword of the True Gods]] kept 1,000 soldiers and 500 cavalry stationed in Hudid. The city also maintained a watch of 2,000 guards and 200 clerical reserves. Hudid only had three ships in its navy in 1367 DR, but building new ships was a top priority.

==Rumors & Legends==
The [[Bala|Balanite]] heresy in nearby [[Mahabba]] sparked concern in Hudid. Refugees from Mahabba flooded to Hudid and Mahabba's caliph believed that Hudid was harboring Balanite [[holy slayer]]s and followers. Caliph [[Sajah al-Munsif]] of Hudid refused three requests from Caliph [[Ma'mum al-Sahnan]] of Mahabba to conduct a formal investigation.
