Hudid, also called the "City of Humility", was one of the Cities of the Pantheon. It was famous for its trade in exotic goods and for featuring the most important university in all of Zakhara.
Hudid was located between Itiraf and Mahabba, where Al-Jama River flowed into the Crowded Sea.
In addition to trading widely, Hudid produced glass lenses and telescopes. Hudid was a favorite spot for foreign traders to sell their exotic wares.
Renowned for having the greatest university in all of Zakhara, many viziers and even Prince Cheddah al-Assad came to Hudid for their education.
The Sword of the True Gods kept 1,000 soldiers and 500 cavalry stationed in Hudid. The city also maintained a watch of 2,000 guards and 200 clerical reserves. Hudid only had three ships in its navy in 1367 DR, but building new ships was a top priority.
The Balanite heresy in nearby Mahabba sparked concern in Hudid. Refugees from Mahabba flooded to Hudid and Mahabbas caliph believed that Hudid was harboring Balanite holy slayers and followers. Caliph Sajah al-Munsif of Hudid refused three requests from Caliph Mamum al-Sahnan of Mahabba to conduct a formal investigation.
