        "mainbody": "The '''Uttermost North''', also known as the '''Utter North''', was a freezing region of [[Toril]] that spanned across the northern-most regions of the continent of [[Faerûn]]. It was nearly entirely inhospitable, with only a scattering of [[humanoid]] societies and places of note.",
        "Geography": "From the perspective of the people of [[the North]], the Utter North comprised all the lands north of the [[Spine of the World]] mountains.",
        "Geographic Features": "The predominant feature of the Uttermost North was the vast frozen wasteland of the [[Endless Ice Sea]]. There were only a few scattered points of interest found throughout the region, and some of those only existed as mere rumor or legend.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Landmarks": "* [[Nchaser's Legacy]]: The monolithic tower of the famed 14{{th}}–century [[wizard]] was purported to rest on an impossibly-tall stalactite of ice located atop Toril's northern pole.",
            "Regions": "* [[Valley of Khedrun]]: This local was named after a renowned [[dwarven]] hero."

        "Inhabitants": "Among the arctic wildlife found throughout the Utter North were [[polar bear]]s."
