The Gate of the Bulls was the inner gate leading to the great fortress of Sarahin.
Beautiful mosaics depicting winged bulls, sword-bearing lions, and snakes climbing toward to sun adorned this gate.
Since the Gate of the Bulls was the last checkpoint before Sarahin, six muscled janni were stationed there to question and admit anyone who approached.
The Gate of the Bulls also served as a roost for a group of deadly marrash.
