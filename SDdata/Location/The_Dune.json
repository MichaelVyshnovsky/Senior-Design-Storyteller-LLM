        "mainbody": "he Dune, also called Solitude or the Island of Exile, was a small desert island found in the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR. The island was part of an archipelago called the Deserts Virtues.\nThe Dune was the smallest of the three islands of the Deserts Virtues archipelago, measuring roughly  in diameter. Several smaller islands were located off of the Dunes northeast coast, but these were mostly large sand bars that could disappear with particularly high tides.\nAnyone in the Corsair Domains who ran afoul of one of the corsair captains risked being marooned on this desolate island."
