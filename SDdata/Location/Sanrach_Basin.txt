The Sanrach Basin was a large depression found in Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.
The basin was surrounded on its western, northern, and eastern sides by the enveloping Sanrach Mountains. Much of the basins southern edge was bordered by the mountains as well, with the Great Sea covering the remaining southern portion. The River Samar flowed through the middle of the Sanrach Basin. The basins northern half was covered by the densely forested Samarlogh.
