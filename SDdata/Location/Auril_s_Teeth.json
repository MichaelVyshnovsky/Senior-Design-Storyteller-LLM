        "mainbody": "urils Teeth was a wintry region of far northeastern Faerûn that encompassed the Great Glacier and the lands between the Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. It was named for the goddess of winter, Auril.\nThe land was defined by endless windswept tundra, the massive Great Glacier, and frigid rivers and lakes. It was a polar region of snow and ice, and was incapable of supporting any agriculture. Some scholars noted that this terrain bore more than a passing resemblance to Aurils divine domain, known as the Land Under Eternal Ice.\nAs the Great Glacier melted and receded in the 15 century DR, the edges of the mighty ice sheet became a miles-wide bog marked by streams of runoff from the melting ice.\nAurils Teeth was inhabited largely by nomadic tribes of humans and dwarves, with the only meaningful exception being the realm of Sossal. These nomads largely sustained themselves by hunting reindeer and fish. \nKnown to most as the Great Glacier, Pelvuria was a daunting sheet of ice that was slowly receding as of the 15 century DR.\nThe remote arctic realm of Sossal was wedged between the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea.\nThe Frostfell was a region said to be at the top of the world, and which was infested with monsters unknown to the people of Faerûn. With the melting of the Glacier, passages began to open that allowed the monsters of the Frostfell to menace the land of Damara."
