'''Haatar-Baen''', more commonly called the '''Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen''', was a region of treeless tundra in [[Vaasa]]. The area was almost completely uninhabited as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

==Geography==
Haatar-Baen was a cold, flat plain that sat at the base of the [[West Galena Mountains]] on the southern edge of Vaasa. [[Dead Man's Walk]], the main east–west road through Vaasa, skirted its northern edges, and the trail through [[Gramble's Climb]] passed into Haatar-Baen before turning south into the mountains toward the [[Moonsea]]. The [[Granite Tower]] sat in the mountains overlooking the steppe.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}

===Flora & Fauna===
The only things that grew in Haatar-Baen were short grasses, all of which were poisonous. In fact, any plant that grew in the steppe, whether natural or cultivated, would be poisonous because of contamination in the soil.

Nevertheless, Haatar-Baen was known to be the home of big game animals.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}} It also hosted two competing apex predators: roving clans of [[leucrotta]] and a strange species of large, black cats whose eyes and maws glowed emerald green when they attacked their prey.Although it is not explicitly stated in the ''[[Realmslore]]: Vaasa'' article, the description of these cats is almost identical to that of the [[Beast of Xvim|Beasts of Xvim]] as described in ''[[Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faerûn]]''.

A loose coalition of [[blue dragons]] was said to lay claim across the entirety of southern Vaasa,

==Inhabitants==
Owing to the poisonous soil, the Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen were never the site of much settlement.
