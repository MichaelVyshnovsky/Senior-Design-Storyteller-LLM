        "mainbody": "he town of Red Larch was a waystop on the Long Road seven days north of Waterdeep,\nThe town was located atop a low ridge along the western edge of the Dessarin Valley.\nRed Larch was known for its nourishing, though otherwise non-noteworthy food, called crumblecake. Crumblecakes were made into moist loaves from nuts, chickpea mash, chopped roots and greens, turkey and wildfowl scraps, all baked together.\nAround the , the town had a militia of around 100 skilled archers, mostly younger boys, who trained by keeping predators away from the poultry farm, Mhandyvvers Poultry. This led raiding parties amongst the orcs to avoid the town.\nThe town was named after a small forest stand of red larches that extended along the ridge. The trees, however, were felled by the first settlers in the region, who chose that particular location thanks to a natural water spring that fed into a small pond that could serve as drinking water for burden animals.\nthumb|250px|The Swinging Sword inn (right) and the Helm at Highsun tavern (left).\nIn addition to the sites listed below, as of around 1366 DR, there was a farmers market and a cattle market.\n* Gaelkurs, a used tools shop, barber, and smaller tavern for locals.\n* Ironhead Arms, a weapons shop opened in 1488 DR.\n* Mhandyvvers Poultry\n* Oneshield Quarries\n* Thelorns Safe Journeys, a busy wagon shop.\n* Vallivoes Sundries, a small, homely shop of new and used items.\n* Chansyrl Fine Harness, a workshop founded by Alaglath Chansyrl and run by her granddaughter in the late 15 century DR.\n* Sklaen Jhavander\n* Ogmoth Tarnlar\n* The Red Larch Rambler\n* The Helm at Highsun, a tavern favored by locals to share gossip and relax.\n* Blackbutter Inn\n* Swinging Sword\n* Dran & Courtier\n* Allfaiths Shrine, a non-denominational shrine to all gods."
