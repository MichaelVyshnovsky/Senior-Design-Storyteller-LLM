        "mainbody": "The town of '''Red Larch''' was a waystop on the [[Long Road]] seven days north of [[Waterdeep]],",
        "Geography": "The town was located atop a low ridge along the western edge of the [[Dessarin Valley]].",
        "Trade": "Red Larch was known for its nourishing, though otherwise non-noteworthy food, called [[crumblecake]]. Crumblecakes were made into moist loaves from nuts, chickpea mash, chopped roots and greens, turkey and wildfowl scraps, all baked together.",
        "Defenses": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, the town had a militia of around 100 skilled archers, mostly younger boys, who trained by keeping predators away from the poultry farm, [[Mhandyvver's Poultry]]. This led raiding parties amongst the [[orc]]s to avoid the town.",
        "History": "The town was named after a small forest stand of [[red larch (tree)|red larches]] that extended along the ridge. The trees, however, were felled by the first settlers in the region, who chose that particular location thanks to a natural water spring that fed into a small pond that could serve as drinking water for burden animals.",
