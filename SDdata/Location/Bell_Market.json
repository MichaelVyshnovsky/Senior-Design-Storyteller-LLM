        "mainbody": "The '''Bell Market''' was, as of [[1374 DR]], a market at the center of [[Everlund]], with broad streets leading from it to the various city gates. It took its name from its huge bell, hanging in an open space next to the city barracks, used to warn of incoming attacks. The market's opening hours were between one hour after dawn and one hour prior to dusk.\n\nThe market contained open-air stalls offering baked and fresh produce, livestock and poultry; and permanent stalls offering manufactured goods. The market was surrounded by shops selling trade goods and services."
