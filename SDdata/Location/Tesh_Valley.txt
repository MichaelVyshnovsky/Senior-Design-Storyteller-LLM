'''Tesh Valley''' was the land surrounding the [[River Tesh]] in [[north Faerûn]], from its headwaters in the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]] to its mouth on the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] beside [[Zhentil Keep]].

==Geography==
The upper Tesh Valley, above [[Dagger Falls (waterfall)|Dagger Falls]], was fertile farmland and good hunting grounds claimed by [[Daggerdale]]. It was bordered on the west by the Desertsmouth Mountains, and on the north by the [[Border Forest]]. To the south, the valley extended until the watershed changed to the [[Dagger River]] (the headwaters of the River Ashaba), somewhere around [[Castle Daggerdale]].

The lower Tesh Valley, from Dagger Falls to the Moonsea, was more rocky and untamed. Before the [[Zhentarim]] destroyed it, [[Teshendale]] was a land of miners, foresters, and lumberjacks, with few viable farms.

===Flora & Fauna===
Creatures that could be living in the valley included [[fox]]es, [[marten (creature)|martens]], [[porcupine]]s, and [[otter]]s.{{Cite web/Realmslore/Storm Silverhand's Quieter Days IV: On the Boil, Part 2}}
