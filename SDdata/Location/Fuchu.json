        "mainbody": "Fuchu was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura.\nSituated on a portion of the shoen originally under the shikken of Kozakura, Fuchu enjoyed the unique status of being tax-exempt.\nDespite being just a modest fishing community, the village prospered, its inhabitants enjoying a level of economic well-being uncommon for such small settlements.\nThe tax-exempt status of Fuchu was a recognition of the villages courageous actions during the Hojo War. At that time, the shoen was controlled by the Hojo family. In a bold move, the jito of the shoen rallied the villagers to support the shikken, opposing the Hojo familys rule. This rebellion, although valiant, was ultimately futile, leading to the villages destruction and the near-total massacre of its inhabitants. However, following the conclusion of the war, the shikken acknowledged the villagers loyalty and sacrifice by granting tax exemption to the survivors and their future generations."
