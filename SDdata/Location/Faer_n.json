        "mainbody": "Faerûn ( ) was a major continent on the planet of Toril.As the key setting of the Forgotten Realms, the majority of official Forgotten Realms material covers this continent, and it has had more attention than any other area of the planet.\nThe word \"Faerûn\" was a modified version of \"Faerie\", the name of the homeland of ancient elves. The term was coined by Durothil, prince of Tintageer, Faerie.\nThe continent included terrain that was as varied as any other. Besides the exterior coastline to the west and south, the most dominant feature on the continent was the Sea of Fallen Stars. This was an irregular inland sea that kept the interior lands fertile, connected the west and east regions of Faerûn and served as a major trade route for many of the bordering nations.\nNext in significance was the Shaar, a broad region of grasslands in the south that, together with the Lake of Steam, separated the area around the inland sea from the coastal nations at the southern edge of the continent. To the east, Faerûn was bordered by a vast region of steppes from Kara-Tur, and in the north were massive glaciers (Pelvuria and Reghed) and tundra.\nThe continent included the following geographic regions.The following division of Faerûn by compass directions was developed for organizational purposes on the Forgotten Realms Wiki, and is not closely reflected by descriptions in source text. In particular, terms like \"the North\" and \"the South\" in the sources can be much more wide-ranging in scope, and as ambiguous, than what is defined here.\nthumb|right|200px|Northwest Faerûn\nA region of wilderness, difficult winter weather, orc hordes, and barbarian tribes, this region was generally referred to as \"The North\", which also contained most of the \"Sword Coast North\". It was a mostly untamed region that lay between the large Anauroch desert in the east and the expansive Sea of Swords in the west, north of the High Moor.\nThis area contained\n* High Forest A traditional home of the elves.\n* Frozenfar The frigid north that contained the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, the Spine of the World and the Sea of Moving Ice.\n* Savage Frontier The rugged frontier of the north that attracted farmsteaders and others that chose to live off the land.\n* Silver Marches A confederation of humans, dwarves, and elves, with the city of Silverymoon at its heart.\n* Sword Coast North This dangerous coastal area comprised several great cities, including the metropolis of Waterdeep and the city of Neverwinter.\nthumb|right|200px|North Faerûn\nThis region stretched from the wide Anauroch desert in the west to the eastern edge of the inland Moonsea, in the northern region of the continent.
