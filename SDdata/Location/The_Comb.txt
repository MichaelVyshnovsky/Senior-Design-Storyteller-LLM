The '''Comb''' was an elevation dominating the eastern region of the [[Island of Gardens]] in the [[Genie's Turban]] archiepelago of the [[Corsair Domains]] of [[northwest Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The Comb was completely covered in dense forest. [[Al-Harir River]] originated near the Comb's center, flowing south and spilling over the edge of the Comb in a series of waterfalls near the coast. Several unnamed rivers were also found in the northern region of the Comb.
