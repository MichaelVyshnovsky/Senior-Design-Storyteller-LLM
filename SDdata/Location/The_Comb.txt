The Comb was an elevation dominating the eastern region of the Island of Gardens in the Genies Turban archiepelago of the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR.
The Comb was completely covered in dense forest. Al-Harir River originated near the Combs center, flowing south and spilling over the edge of the Comb in a series of waterfalls near the coast. Several unnamed rivers were also found in the northern region of the Comb.
