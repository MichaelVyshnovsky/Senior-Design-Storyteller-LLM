        "Geography": "This town was located within the [[Alamber Sea]], at the top edge of the [[Pythan Trench]]. Out of Kurrimal's nine towns, it was the closest to the [[Sharksbane Wall]] and [[Serôs]].",
        "Government": "Like all nine of the towns of Kurrimal, this town was governed by a prince of the same name, [[Kiture (character)|Kiture]].",
        "History": "Kiture was founded ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|420|TS}}, though under a different name. In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, when the kingdom of Kurrimal was founded as the successor of Aleaxtis,<ref> this town's name was changed to that of the prince put in charge of governing it.",
        "Inhabitants": "Compared to other towns, Kiture had an unusually high rate of [[malenti]] births. Most malenti spawned in this town were quickly put to death, while some managed to survive to become [[priest]]esses of [[Sekolah]], spies, or [[warrior]]s. However, due to Kitture's brutal elimination of malenti newborns, it was not uncommon for malenti in any three of these groups to go rogue and take up life in Serôs."
