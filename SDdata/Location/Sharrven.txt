'''Sharrven''' was an ancient [[elven]] realm in the southern [[High Forest]]. 

==Description==
The realm was renown for its tolerance, and was made up mostly of [[moon elves]] and [[green elves]].

Sharrven's architecture was likened to that found in [[Silverymoon]]. Many buildings were made of stone and bore massive perches on which a [[dragon]] could alight. 

==Geography==
At its height, Sharrven encompassed the High Forest south of the [[Star Mounts]].

==Government==
The [[Elders of Sharrven]] steered the realm. Much of their focus in the early millennia of Sharrven's existence was dedicated to keeping the ambitions of the [[gold elves]] of [[Siluvanede]] in check, and preventing them from repeating the mistakes of ancient [[Aryvandaar]]. They were known to confer with [[baelnorn]]s located at [[Nithrithvinae's Tomb]]. 

==Defenses==
Sharrven boasted a mighty military which included [[Gold dragon|gold]] and [[silver dragon]] mounts as well as exceptionally powerful [[wizard]]s.

==History==
Sharrven was founded in [[-7600 DR]] by moon elves from [[Evereska]], seeking to escape the overcrowded city, as well as moon elves (and a few [[sun elves]]) from Siluvanede, seeking to counter the overbearing and arrogant nobles of that realm.

As tensions rose between Eaerlann and Siluvanede, the [[Seven Citadels' War]] broke out in [[-4500 DR]]. While Sharrven was at first content to support Eaerlann indirectly while the fledgling realm held its own, eventually the Siluvanedeen began to break into the ruins of Aryvandaar and equip themselves with [[Aryvandaar|Vyshaantar]] weapons.

The fey'ri would have their revenge in [[-2770 DR]] when they launched a surprise attack. They used their powers to create ''[[portal]]s'' to send hordes of monsters directly into and all across Sharrven's territory. The rampaging monsters were eventually subdued by the forces of [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] led by King [[Connar IV]], although some of the beasts continued to propagate in the region for millennia. Regardless, by this time nearly all of Sharrven's settlements had been demolished.

The stretch of the High Forest which the realm once inhabited would continue to be called "Sharrven" into the [[Era of Upheaval]],

==Rumors & Legends==
The [[Srinshee]] claimed to have been raised in Sharrven, although many were unsure if this was the truth as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Notable Locations==
* The fortress of [[Farsilver]], located due north of [[Loudwater]], still stood as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], protected by powerful [[magic]] [[ward]]s. 
* [[Nithrithvinae's Tomb]], a tomb for members of the noble houses of Sharrven containing a twisting maze of family crypts.
