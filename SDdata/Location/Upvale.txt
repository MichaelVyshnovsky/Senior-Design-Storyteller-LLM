[[Upvale]] was the area between [[Tall Trees]] and the [[Far Forest]] in the [[North]].

==Geography==
Upvale was part of a larger region known as the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].

==History==
This region, along the [[Delimbiyr]], used to be an area with many farms and pastures settled by [[human]]s, but subject to frequent raids by [[orc]]s. It eventually fell under the control of [[Hellgate Keep]] until that location was laid to ruins.
