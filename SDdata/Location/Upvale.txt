Upvale was the area between Tall Trees and the Far Forest in the North.
Upvale was part of a larger region known as the Delimbiyr Vale.
This region, along the Delimbiyr, used to be an area with many farms and pastures settled by humans, but subject to frequent raids by orcs. It eventually fell under the control of Hellgate Keep until that location was laid to ruins.
