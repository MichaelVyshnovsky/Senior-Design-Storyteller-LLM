The North Quarter was one of the four quarters of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The North Quarter encompassed the Craft District, Central District, and the Warehouse District, forming most of the northern portion of the city. Visitors often came to the North Quarter for its wide selection of skilled craftsmen. Many traders and prominent merchant families either stored or manufactured their goods here until they were ready for sale in the Grand Bazaar of the Clothiers Quarter. Additionally, the bulk of Huzuzs military was quartered within the North Quarter.
