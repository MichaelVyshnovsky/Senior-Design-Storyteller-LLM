        "mainbody": "'''Ilmwatch''' was a large fortress-town that protected the infamous [[Buzzard Beak Harbor]] and traders of the [[Merchant's Run]], located on the northern end of the [[Easting Reach]], within the [[Farwater]] region of [[Impiltur]].",
        "Description": "Despite its strategic location between Impiltur and [[Damara]], Ilmwatch was not a particularly busy port city.",
        "Activities": "During most months of the year, sea-travel from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] was largely navigable along the [[Great Imphras River]] until the great city of [[Helgabal]]. As such, Ilmwatch only brought in a few ships that unloaded their goods within the fortress. The settlement did see some overland trade, primarily from smaller mercantile operations that only required wagons or horses as a means of conveyance. \n\nIlmwatch was large enough to easily support several hundred troops. Soldiers from the [[Warswords]] were tasked with protecting merchants traveling to and from Damara as well as those who crossed the Easting Reach to [[Uthmere]]. Patrols regularly scouted the surrounding lands and often accompanied merchants traveling along the Merchant's Run and [[Herald's Road]], as they passed closer to the fortress. Their influence extended as far north as Uthmerg to the southwestern local known as the [[Narrows]], where the Herald's Road crossed the [[Bluefang Water]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}",
        "History": "During the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Ilmwatch was governed by [[Heskar Brandosk]]. He led a stalwart defense of the fortress against the influence of the [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm|Shadowmasters]] of [[Telflamm]] and pirates that scoured the coast of the Easting Reach."
