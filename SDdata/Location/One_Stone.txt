'''One Stone''' was an ancestor mound for the [[Golden Eagle tribe|Golden Eagle]], [[Red Pony tribe|Red Pony]], and [[Sky Pony]] [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]] tribes of the [[Moonwood]] in the [[Silver Marches]].

==Description==
Instead of an altar mound at the center of the cairn rings, there was a single massive boulder {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} across and {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} high and covered in precisely engraved tracery. Carved steps ascended the south face to the altar top.

==Rumors & Legends==
One legend told of a god who sealed a passageway from the [[Nine Hells]] with a single rock thrust into the ground. Some wonder if the [[evil]] sealed beneath the stone caused the deaths of the tribes and darker tales said the tribes dwelt under the stone within the portal.

==History==
Originally this mound was worshiped by members of the [[Sky Pony tribe|Sky Pony]], Golden Eagle, and Red Pony tribes, but for reasons unknown the latter two eventually moved on to other places. Years later, [[lycanthrope]]s of [[Claw Hollow]] perpetrated sudden attacks on the Sky Pony tribe during their pilgrimage to this holy place to celebrate their ancestors. Sky Pony barbarians therefore started attacking strangers on sight.
