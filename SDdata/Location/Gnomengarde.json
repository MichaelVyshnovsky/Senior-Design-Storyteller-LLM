        "mainbody": "'''Gnomengarde''' was a tunnel network located in the [[Sword Mountains]] that was home to a small kingdom of reclusive [[rock gnomes]] famous for their [[magical]] inventions.",
        "Description": "The settlement was carved out of the sheer cliffs on either side of a narrow waterfall. This fed a pool in which sat two small islands covered in {{SIAdj|2|foot|long=yes|adj=tall}} blue, green, and purple [[mushroom]]s. The mist and roar of the waterfall blanketed and hid the area from outsiders, but also emanated into the Gnomengarde cave network. Gnomes inside the echoing tunnels had to shout to be heard over the noise unless they had a door or barrier between themselves and the waterfall, and most of said doors had rusted likely because of the waterfall's mists. The tunnels themselves were quite spacious for a gnome, averaging 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide and 7 feet (2.1 meters) high, and were well-lit by lantern light.\n\nThe clan of gnomes who called Gnomengarde home lived quite simply, with simple furniture and amenities made of wood. The exception was their kings, whose bedchambers was richly appointed and whose thrones had been crafted from scrap metal. Most of the larger spaces in the tunnel network were dedicated to food and alcohol preparation or to workshop spaces.\n\nThe entire area was a zone of [[wild magic]].",
        "Geography": "Gnomengarde was located in the north-facing slopes of the Sword Mountains about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of [[Phandalin]].",
        "Government": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Gnomengarde was ruled by King [[Gnerkli]] and his husband, King [[Korboz]]. The gnomes also looked up to and tended to heed the words of whomever was the best of their inventors, and at this time these were [[Fibblestib]] and [[Dabbledob]].",
        "Trade": "The residents of Gnomengarde were consummate tinkerers and crafters of [[magic]] items, which were the main draw for outsiders looking to do business with the gnomes. Such items included ''[[clockwork amulet]]s'', ''[[hat of wizardry|hats of wizardry]]'', ''[[Pole of collapsing|poles of collapsing]]'', and ''[[Wand of pyrotechnics|wands of pyrotechnics]]''.\n\nThe gnomes were largely self-sufficient thanks to the special types of red, green, and purple mushrooms that grew on the islands in the pool beneath their waterfall: the red mushrooms could be processed into fuel for [[lantern]]s and mechanical devices using a complex pressing contraption devised by the gnomes, the green mushrooms could be pulverized into a [[flour]] which could be kneaded and baked into [[bread]], and the purple mushrooms could be fermented inside [[barrel]]s to make [[mushroom wine]].",
        "Defenses": "Two sentries stood watch on a ledge overlooking the only approach to Gnomengarde. Any invader would then need to cross a rope bridge above the waterfall and navigate a room containing two large rotating blade [[trap]]s operated from the opposite side of the room.\n\nIn addition to these physical defenses, every member of the community had some training as a [[wizard]]. They all studied from the same old spellbook, called ''[[Magick of Gnomengarde]]''.",
        "History": "The founders of Gnomengarde imbued the islands in the pool beneath the waterfall with potent magics that caused unique colorful and large mushrooms to grow there, which would serve as the backbone of the settlement's livelihood. Perhaps unintentionally, these magics also created a wild magic zone around the caves.\n\nAround the time of Phandalin's refounding in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Gnomengarde was home to twenty-two gnomes. A few years later, a [[mimic]] arrived in the settlement and developed a taste for gnome flesh, killing and consuming at least two of the inhabitants and nearly killing King Korboz. The attack shook the king so thoroughly that he went mad, imprisoning his husband and himself inside their bedchamber to wait until the [[shapechanger]] either grew bored of eating their subjects or was driven off.\n\nNot long after this incident, the town of [[Leilon]] asked Gnomengarde for magic weapons with which to defend themselves from the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]]. In response, the gnomes invented the ''[[Gnomengarde grenade]]''.",
        "Inhabitants": "During the incident with the mimic in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Gnomengarde was home to exactly twenty [[rock gnomes]], all of whom had some training as [[wizard]]s and were generally friendly to but wary of visitors. They were:\n\n*King [[Gnerkli]], husband of King Korboz and who was imprisoned when Korboz went mad.\n*King [[Korboz]], husband of King Gnerkli and who went mad after being attacked by a mimic disguised as his rug.\n*[[Fibblestib]], one of Gnomengarde's two foremost inventors. His plan to cure King Koboz of his madness was to invent a \"sanity ray.\"\n*[[Dabbledob]], the other of Gnomengarde's two foremost inventors. Her plan to treat King Koboz's madness was to invent a \"straitjacket.\"\n*[[Facktoré]], the deranged inventor and operator of Gnomengarde's autoloading crossbow defense platform.\n*[[Dimble]], responsible for squeezing the red mushrooms to process oil for the gnomes' lanterns and machines.\n*[[Panana]], responsible for rolling and kneading the green mushrooms into bread dough.\n*[[Uppendown]], responsible for shaping and forming the green mushroom dough into bread loaves.\n*[[Joybell]], responsible for the stove on which the green mushroom bread was baked.\n*[[Tervaround]], responsible for fermenting the purple mushrooms to make wine.\n*[[Ulla]], one of Gnomengarde's two sentries. She hailed outsiders in [[Gnome language|Gnomish]].\n*[[Pog]], the other of Gnomengarde's two sentries. He hailed outsiders in [[Common]].\n*[[Anverth]], a male resident.\n*[[Caramip]], a female resident.\n*[[Delebean]], a male resident.\n*[[Jabby]], a female resident.\n*[[Nyx]], a female resident.\n*[[Pallabar]], a male resident.\n*[[Quippy]], a female resident.\n*[[Zook (gnome)|Zook]], a male resident.\n\nFollowing this incident with the mimic, at least two more gnomes had become part of Gnomengarde:\n*[[Bindlemint Mincemower]], a female assistant to Fibblestib and Dabbledob.\n*[[Favora Corehoarder]], a [[priestess]] of [[Garl Glittergold]]."
