'''Carrelath Barony''' was a part of the monarchy of [[Erlkazar]] encompassing the territory of the [[Kuldin Peaks]].

==Description==
The Kuldin Peaks contained garrisons for Erlkazar's army. The troops guarded the gap in the [[Iltkazar Range]] and defended the headwaters of the [[Shining Stream]]. In addition, Carrelath contained a few small mining villages and religious sites.

==Geography==
The barony was the westernmost of Erlkazar's five baronies. It bordered [[Impresk]] in the north, [[Shalanar]] in the east, and [[Tanistan]] in the south.

The entire territory was foothills, passes, or mountains of the Kuldin Peaks.

==Government==
While in name ruled by a baron, in truth the true power rested in the hands of a [[Shield dwarf|shield dwarven]] [[priest]], as had been the case since the time of [[Shanatar]].

==Notable Locations==
; [[Golconda]] : This mining village contained an old [[Calimshan|Calishite]] fortress from the [[Third Age of Calimshan]].
; [[Ravimor's Cave]] : This cave south of [[Tibold]] contained a rift thought to descend all the way to [[Deep Shanatar]].
; [[Tibold]] : This mining town was the location of the baron's home and was built atop dwarven ruins.

==History==
The area had been settled since the time of Shanatar. In fact, the town of Tibold was the oldest continuously occupied location in the [[Lands of Intrigue]], founded some 2,600 years before the start of the [[Dalereckoning]].

Before the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]], the area was one of the counties of [[Tethyr]].
