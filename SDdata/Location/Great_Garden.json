        "Descriptions": "The garden was found deep underground beneath the fortress. It was filled with beautiful flora and a bubbling marble fountain, all of which were real. The pristine blue sky and bird and insect sounds filling the garden were all an elaborate illusion.\n\nThe garden measured roughly {{SI|100|ft}} in diameter, but cleverly designed illusions made it appear endless. The paths traversing the garden had a ''[[maze|maze-like]]'' effect upon occupants. Only those who knew the secret command word were immune to this effect.\n\nThe \"sky\" over the garden mimicked the same cycles that occurred above the fortress. A constant gentle breeze caressed every area of the Great Garden.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Nar-Aidiya]] enjoyed relaxing in the garden when he was able to find time. A [[Tasked genie|tasked]] [[slayer genie]] named [[Mujibur]] served as caretaker and guardian of the garden."
