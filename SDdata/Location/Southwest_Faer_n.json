            "Chult": "{{Main|Chult}}\nThis region of dense jungles lay at the western edge of the Chultan peninsula, where the Shining Sea joined the oceans to the west. It was a swamp-filled land with wild beasts such as [[dinosaur]]s, [[Ubtao]]-worshiping tribes, and wealthy merchant-princes that founded a [[Port Nyanzaru|great city]] that attracted adventurers from across the Realms.",
            "Lapaliiya": "{{Main|Lapaliiya}}\nBefore its destruction, known as the Lapal League, ruled over by hereditary monarchs. It was home to hard-working, yet somewhat barbaric folks that detested serpent-kind and took honor and proper behavior very seriously. Duels were common, as were feuds between families. Each of the cities in this land had a different patron deity whom its residents worshiped above all others.",
            "Samarach": "{{Main|Samarach}}\nThis was a secretive land at the eastern edge of the jungles of Chult about which little was known.",
            "Tashalar": "{{Main|Tashalar}}\nThis coastal land on the southern shore of the Shining Sea was the home to wealthy merchants and craftspeople that dwelled at the edge of the [[Black Jungle]] to the south. The capital city of [[Tashluta]] and the surrounding waters were protected by a strong fleet of ships. Malevolent [[serpentfolk]] like the [[Yuan-ti]] infiltrated the Realms cities, striking out from the surrounding jungles.",
            "Thindol": "{{Main|Thindol}}\nBefore its near-entire destruction, the grasslands of Thindol were home to fleet-footed tribes of [[human]]s and its neighboring mountain ranges were home to clans of [[dwarves]]."
