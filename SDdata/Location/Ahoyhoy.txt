'''Ahoyhoy''' was a fort on the northwest coast of the [[Snout of Omgar]]. It was inhabited by [[tortle]]s.

==Description==
Ahoyhoy was built with large stone walls―adorned with massive [[tortoise]] shells―that formed a multi-tiered stronghold.

==Geography==
The fort was located at the top of a rocky shelf, overlooking a beach. Numerous shipwrecks were strewn across the shore north of the village.

A lone trail connected Ahoyhoy to the Typhoon Palace of [[Dangwaru]].

==Government==
Ahoyhoy had no government. All inhabitants and visitors were expected to behave well. Transgressors would be invited (or taken) out of the settlement by the tortles standing guard at the time.

==Trade==
The settlement had a lively market in which villagers traded with friendly visitors and sometimes with traders from ships anchored offshore. Since the village often received adventurers as guests, there was a variety of adventuring items for trade, as well as unusual items and exotic wild or domesticated [[beast]]s.

Among the animals known to be available in the village were [[baboon]]s, [[axe beak]]s, [[almiraj]], [[flying snake]]s, [[giant lizard]]s, and [[blood hawk]]s. Some merchants even sold valuable spell components, such as [[diamond]]s, and even [[dinosaur]] eggs.

==Notable Locations==
In addition to the marketplace, Ahoyhoy featured a smithy, a pair of egg hatcheries, and a grand amphitheater that was used as a communal gathering place.

==Inhabitants==
The fort was home to a local population of tortles who worked on crafts, fishing or general maintenance of the buildings. It also received tortle visitors who came to the village to trade or to lay eggs.

One notable inhabitant of the fort was [[Mudgraw]], a tortle [[druid]] who sometimes offered his services as a guide to adventurers.

It was also home to numerous [[chwinga]]s.
