        "Geography": "The Batrachi Empires seemed to have included the realms of [[Kolophoon]], [[Boitumelo]], [[Nadezhda]], and [[Zhoukoudien (realm)|Zhoukoudien]].These realms are known only from their appearance on the map above. It is presumed they are all meant to be part of the Batrachi Empires, but only Zhoukoudien has a confirmed connection to the batrachi, but is unknown why this realm shares a name with the leader, Zhoukoudien. At their height, the Batrachi Empires spread across the whole of Merrouroboros,",
        "History": "The Batrachi Empires rose to power ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-33500}}.\n\nThey grew to the height of their power under the wise leadership of [[Zhoukoudien]], the High One. However, their golden age ended abruptly when the High One was killed in battle by [[Omo]], a [[titan]] thane, around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. The batrachi lord [[Bazim-Gorag]] later called Zhoukoudien a fool who unwisely made war against the [[Jotunbrud]] and lost the empire.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-31000}}, the batrachi were losing a war against the titans. In their desperation, they enacted a great summoning ritual that unleashed several once-imprisoned [[primordial]]s. The [[god]]s swiftly opposed the primordials. The primordial [[Asgorath]], the World Shaper in an event called the [[Tearfall]]. Disastrous earthquakes, fires, and windstorms swept across all of [[Abeir-Toril]], erasing whole continents and rearranging the seas. The extreme climate change swiftly led to the end of batrachi civilization."
