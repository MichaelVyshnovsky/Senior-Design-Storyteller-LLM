It is presumed they are all meant to be part of the Batrachi Empires, but only Zhoukoudien has a confirmed connection to the batrachi, but is unknown why this realm shares a name with the leader, Zhoukoudien. At their height, the Batrachi Empires spread across the whole of Merrouroboros,\nThe Batrachi Empires rose to power circa .\nThey grew to the height of their power under the wise leadership of Zhoukoudien, the High One. However, their golden age ended abruptly when the High One was killed in battle by Omo, a titan thane, around . The batrachi lord Bazim-Gorag later called Zhoukoudien a fool who unwisely made war against the Jotunbrud and lost the empire.\nAround , the batrachi were losing a war against the titans. In their desperation, they enacted a great summoning ritual that unleashed several once-imprisoned primordials. The gods swiftly opposed the primordials. The primordial Asgorath, the World Shaper in an event called the Tearfall. Disastrous earthquakes, fires, and windstorms swept across all of Abeir-Toril, erasing whole continents and rearranging the seas. The extreme climate change swiftly led to the end of batrachi civilization."
