        "Rumors": "In Gullykin, information about the ongoings in Durlag's Tower could be purchased for a small price.\n\nThe brewery of Gullykin was known to have great vaults, used both for storing [[cask]]s and growing [[mushroom]]s. Rumors had it that they might be connected to underground store rooms of an ancient merchant house of Firewine Bridge, where many treasures guarded by [[golem]]s still waited to be found.\n\nThe citizens of Gullykin didn't explore the ruins of Firewine Bridge as they believed that doing so invited the misfortune of \"those who died and do not sleep\"."
