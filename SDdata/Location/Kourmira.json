Kourmira sat along the southern bank of the river.\nAs of 1375 DR, much of Kourmira was filled primarily with tents. However, the new Khahan wasted no time in enlisting the aid of the dwarves of Siremun to begin constructing permanent buildings. Many of these buildings were built with precious skystone, causing the structures to shine like jewels.\nHubadai moved quickly to erect stout stone walls around the land allotted for the city to protect against the threat of attack.\nThe Red Wizards of Thay established a merchant enclave in Kourmira in 1374 DR.\nMany of the steppe nomads relocated to the capital, or the area surrounding it, during the frigid winter months to avoid confrontations with gnolls and other beasts who prowled the steppes.\nKourmira was founded in 1367 DR, just four years after Hubadai Khahan established the empire of Yaïmmunahar.\n* The Scarlet Keep\n* The White Spire\n* The Golden Plaza\n* The Red Temple of War, a massive fortress dedicated to the Red Knight. It housed the armory of the city, and hosted the Order of the Red Hound."
