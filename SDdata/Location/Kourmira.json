        "Geography": "[[File:GreatAmber.PNG|thumb|300px|right|''Kourmira and the surrounding region, circa 1375 DR'']]\nThe capital was situated along a strategic spot on the [[Golden Way]] where the [[Winterflow River]] passed through [[Kora Shan]]. Kourmira sat along the southern bank of the river.",
        "Description": "As of 1375 DR, much of Kourmira was filled primarily with tents. However, the new Khahan wasted no time in enlisting the aid of the [[dwarves]] of [[Siremun]] to begin constructing permanent buildings. Many of these buildings were built with precious [[skystone]], causing the structures to shine like jewels.\n\nHubadai moved quickly to erect stout stone walls around the land allotted for the city to protect against the threat of attack.",
        "Activities": "The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] established a merchant enclave in Kourmira in [[1374 DR]].\n\nMany of the steppe nomads relocated to the capital, or the area surrounding it, during the frigid winter months to avoid confrontations with [[gnoll]]s and other beasts who prowled the steppes.",
        "History": "Kourmira was founded in [[1367 DR]], just four years after Hubadai Khahan established the empire of Ya誰mmunahar.",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Scarlet Keep]]\n* The [[White Spire]]\n* The [[Golden Plaza]]\n* The [[Red Temple of War]], a massive fortress dedicated to the [[Red Knight]]. It housed the armory of the city, and hosted the [[Order of the Red Hound]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste}}"
