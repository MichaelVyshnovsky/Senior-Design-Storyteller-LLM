Taerymdoom was a network of natural caves located in the southern borders of the Far Forest in the Savage Frontier.
Those who ventured into these caves said they stretched for several miles underground and were guarded by vargouilles.
Taerymdoom was named for an elf, Taerym, who was slain by a cloaker while trying to investigate the caves. Moreover, even a group of Zhentarim explorers and the Darkblades of Esmeltaran lost their lives to this evil place.
