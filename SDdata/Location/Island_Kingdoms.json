        "mainbody": "The Island Kingdoms were a small group of islands in the far southeast of Kara-Tur, in the Southern Ocean. They included the large island of Bawa, the island chain of Bertan, and the small islands of Panjardu, Rukun, and Sirat. They were home to the human Bavanese, Bertanese, and Bawani peoples.\nThe islands of Bawa created some of the finest wood lacquerwork that depicted fantastical and exotic creatures of bright and pleasing colors. Lacquerwork was exported from Bawa and could be found as far as the markets of Samargol in Samarach.\nThe island was home to the notorious crime lord Aziz-Tagem."
