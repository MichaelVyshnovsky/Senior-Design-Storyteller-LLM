Chethel was a coastal city in the halfling realm of Luiren.
Chethel was located on the coast of Luirenstrand (the Great Sea). Directly to the southeast of the city was the Mortick Swamp.
The city was founded in 47 DR. In 148 DR, the city was half-destroyed by merrow from Mortick Swamp. In 1105 DR, the city received widespread damage from a storm over the Great Sea.
Chethel was one of Luirens main trading cities. Its inhabitants were particularly skilled at shipbuilding.
In addition to halflings, one-tenth of the citys population were elves and half-elves.
