'''Ironmaster Vale''' was a coastal valley in the [[Cold Run]] region of the [[Frozenfar]], where the [[Shaengarne]] river opened up into the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

The valley was named after the [[dwarven]] city of [[Ironmaster]], which was located within its depths.

==Features==
The borders of the valley were marked by a number of stone [[menhir]]s, each of which was inscribed with Ironmaster's coat-of-arms.

==Inhabitants==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], non-dwarves were prohibited from entering the valley's borders.
