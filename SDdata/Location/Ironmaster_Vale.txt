Ironmaster Vale was a coastal valley in the Cold Run region of the Frozenfar, where the Shaengarne river opened up into the Sea of Moving Ice.
The valley was named after the dwarven city of Ironmaster, which was located within its depths.
The borders of the valley were marked by a number of stone menhirs, each of which was inscribed with Ironmasters coat-of-arms.
As of the late 15 century DR, non-dwarves were prohibited from entering the valleys borders.
