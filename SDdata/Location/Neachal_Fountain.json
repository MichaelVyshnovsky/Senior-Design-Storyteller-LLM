Caravans avoided this area due to dangers such as hot springs, and mud pits, many of which were hidden by thin layers of dirt that looked like normal ground.\nThe nomads of the area considered the site holy for being a “nostril of the earth god.”\nThe waters from this area were used as an ingredient in potions that removed curses, due to the minerals found here.\nCategoryLocations on the Old Iron Road\nCategoryLocations in the Katakoro Plateau\nCategoryLocations in the Hordelands\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nfsmoimo5b84hqu2oq3wjw62mvxb281x"
