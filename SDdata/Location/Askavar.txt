'''Askavar''' was an ancient [[Elf|elven]] settlement in the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth|Glimmerwood]].

==History==
The evil [[wizard]] [[Uldoon]] used to send [[fiend]]s from his small realm of [[Torsil]] north of the [[Cloud Peaks]] to prey upon the elves of Askavar.

Askavar was abandoned sometime in the late 5{{th}} century [[DR]], its population leaving for [[Evermeet]] and [[Evereska]].

==Trivia==
A woman named [[Illyra]], a scholar in [[giant]] lore, owned a collection of Askavarian pottery.
