Askavar was an ancient elven settlement in the Glimmerwood.
The evil wizard Uldoon used to send fiends from his small realm of Torsil north of the Cloud Peaks to prey upon the elves of Askavar.
Askavar was abandoned sometime in the late 5 century DR, its population leaving for Evermeet and Evereska.
A woman named Illyra, a scholar in giant lore, owned a collection of Askavarian pottery.
