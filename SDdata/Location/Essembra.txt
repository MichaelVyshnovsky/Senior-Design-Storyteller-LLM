Essembra () was the largest town and center of trade in Battledale, before it was abandoned in the early 15 century DR.
Essembra sat astride Rauthauvyrs Road, and saw a large amount of traffic on that road between Sembia and the Moonsea.
The mansion of Sharburg was located some miles southwest of town.
The town itself was deep in the forest of Cormanthyr the trees of the Elven Court woods hemmed Essembra on all sides. There was a central walled section of the town surrounded by fields, along with of cottages fronting along Ratuthauvyrs Road for a mile or more. Few cross streets or back alleys cut through the town.
According to Volothamp Geddarm, visitors usually found Essembra pleasant, but curiously unimpressive.
Essembra was settled when the Ordulin-Hillsfar road was cut through the Elven Court.
For centuries, Essembra was barely even a hamlet. When Aencar became the Warlord of Battledale in 1030 DR, he declared Essembra to be his seat since it was near his ancestral manor. Aencars chief lieutenant, Ramorth Wyvernblade, took the title of lord of Essembra and built his manorhouse there.
In 1422 DR Sembians allied with Netheril fought forces from Myth Drannor near Essembra.  The battle forced abandonment of the town.
