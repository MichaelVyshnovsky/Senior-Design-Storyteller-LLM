        "Description": "The efreet of Memnonnar burned away much of the forest of the region to clear and settle the land.\n\nThe [[Memnonnar|capital of Memnonnar]] shared its name with the country and straddled the [[River Agis]] at the [[Sea of Swords|sea]]. Most of the cities of Memnonnar were constructed of red brick and filled with citadels, temples, and minarets, with domes inlaid with [[brass]]&mdash;similar in architectural style to the [[City of Brass]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].",
        "Geography": "Memnonnar was located north of the [[River Agis]], south of the [[Sulduskoon River]], and west of the [[Marching Mountains]], along the [[Sword Coast]]. The later cities of [[Memnon]], [[Myratma]], [[Zazesspur]], [[Ithmong]], and [[Shoonach]] all contained ruins from the time of Memnonnar.",
        "Government": "For its entire existence, Memnonnar was ruled by its [[noble efreeti]] founder, the Great Pasha [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The country was populated by [[human]]s, [[efreet]], and [[fire genasi]]. Slaves labored deep underground, mining [[gem]]s and precious metals for their masters. [[Harssaf]]s were also among Memnon's subjects.",
        "History": "The efreeti Memnon arrived on [[Toril]] exactly 1,000 years after the arrival of the [[djinni]] [[Calim]], coming through a magical ''[[portal]]'' called the [[Great Brass Gate]].\n\nIt took 400 years for Memnon to build his cities, because his people remained in hiding from the neighboring [[Calim Caliphates]] to the south.\n\nFor 200 years, skirmishes between the two genie-led nations occurred, primarily along the Agis before outright war broke out&mdash;the [[First Era of Skyfire]].\n\nThe survivors of Memnonnar were hunted down by the elves of [[Darthiir Wood]], who effectively annihilated all traces of Memnonnar within 30 years time. The [[dwarves]] of [[Shanatar]] then moved into the area and built great surface cities over the ruins of the genie cities. None of these dwarven cities survived into modern times, and no scholars knew their names, but the dwarven stonework could still be found in the modern city sewers and roadways. Humans later built over the ruins left by the dwarves.\n\nHarssaf survivors found themselves magically bound to the [[Calim Desert]] and persisted there for millennia.",
