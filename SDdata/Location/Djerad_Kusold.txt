'''Djerad Kusold''' (the ''Fortress of Kusold'' in [[Draconic language|Draconic]]) was a ruined [[dragonborn]] city in [[Melabrauth]].

==History==
Before the [[Blue Breath of Change]], Djerad Kusold was a city that served as home for the slave dragonborn population of Melabrauth.

During the [[Wailing Years]], the dragonborn of Djerad Kusold were able to get enough [[dragonbane amber]] to start a rebellion against their [[dragon]] masters. The city became a fortress for the leaders of the rebellion. The city was later destroyed by [[Melauthaur]] the Undying One, who used powerful [[Dawn Titan]] [[magic]] to swallow Djerad Kusold under the earth.

In the later years of the 15th century DR, many dragonborn [[adventurer]]s risked their lives exploring the jungles of Melabrauth in hopes to find the ruins of Djerad Kusold.
