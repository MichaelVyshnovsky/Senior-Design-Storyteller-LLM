        "mainbody": "The '''Ama Basin''' was the southern part of the land called the [[Northern Wastes]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. This land was called the Ama Basin in honor of the great river [[Ama River|Ama]] that originated here and ended in the [[Celestial Sea]]. Also in these lands were the [[Koryaz Mountains]], which were home to many tribes.<ref>",
        "Geography": "The Ama Basin was a large, mostly unexplored area consisting of woodlands and swamps, rich with game.",
        "History": "It was believed that the least explored part of the Ama Basin's great forests grew on the land that was the site of collapsed expansive mines used in the ancient times.\n\nIn the decades following the [[Spellplague]], several powerful [[oni]]s living in this basin enslaved [[hobgoblin]]s from the nearby [[Land of the Snow Spirits]], posing a constant threat to the [[human]] villages scattered around the region.\n\n[[Spellscar]]s became unusually prevalent among the [[hengeyokai]] of this region. Over time this phenomenon attracted the attention of various sages and [[wu jen]] across Kara-Tur.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Ama Basin was home to the [[Pazruki]], [[Tayanuchi]], and [[Issacortae]] tribes, as well as [[bakemono]],{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|4}}",
        "Notable Locations": "Deep within the Ama Basin lay [[Panjuis]], an ancient [[pixie]] fortress constructed from three massive trees. The fortress was left to rot and decay for hundreds of years after its ruler, the Pixie King [[Teremon]], passed away, and the other pixies left. By [[1359 DR]], it was inhabited by a tribe of bakemono, who were repairing the fortress for their own use."
