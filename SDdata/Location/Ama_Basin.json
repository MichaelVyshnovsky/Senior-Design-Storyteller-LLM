        "mainbody": "The Ama Basin was the southern part of the land called the Northern Wastes in Kara-Tur. This land was called the Ama Basin in honor of the great river Ama that originated here and ended in the Celestial Sea. Also in these lands were the Koryaz Mountains, which were home to many tribes.\nThe Ama Basin was a large, mostly unexplored area consisting of woodlands and swamps, rich with game.\nIt was believed that the least explored part of the Ama Basins great forests grew on the land that was the site of collapsed expansive mines used in the ancient times.\nIn the decades following the Spellplague, several powerful onis living in this basin enslaved hobgoblins from the nearby Land of the Snow Spirits, posing a constant threat to the human villages scattered around the region.\nSpellscars became unusually prevalent among the hengeyokai of this region. Over time this phenomenon attracted the attention of various sages and wu jen across Kara-Tur.\nThe Ama Basin was home to the Pazruki, Tayanuchi, and Issacortae tribes, as well as bakemono,\nDeep within the Ama Basin lay Panjuis, an ancient pixie fortress constructed from three massive trees. The fortress was left to rot and decay for hundreds of years after its ruler, the Pixie King Teremon, passed away, and the other pixies left. By 1359 DR, it was inhabited by a tribe of bakemono, who were repairing the fortress for their own use."
