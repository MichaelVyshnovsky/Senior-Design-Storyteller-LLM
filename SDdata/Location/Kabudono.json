        "Description": "Kabudono, situated to the west of [[Hinomoto]], was one of the three significant islands that lie beyond Kozakuran control but fell within the sphere of Kozakuran influence. This low-lying landmass boasted peaks that resembled enlarged hills rather than towering mountains. Along the coast, from northeast to southwest, stretched the [[Cormorant Hills]], while [[bamboo]] and [[plaintain]] forests covered the southern half of the island.\n\nTo the northwest of Kabudono,  the island of [[Hagurejima]] rose dramatically from the ocean.",
        "Inhabitants": "Kabudono served as the home for fisherfolk, [[wako]] pirates, and the [[hsing-sing]] residing in the southern forests.  Known as a favored mooring spot for wako, it frequently experienced raids by Kozakuran war vessels. The port town of [[Yoetsu]] served as a harbor for the wako."
