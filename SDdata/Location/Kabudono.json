        "mainbody": "abudono was an island located in Kozakura.\nKabudono, situated to the west of Hinomoto, was one of the three significant islands that lie beyond Kozakuran control but fell within the sphere of Kozakuran influence. This low-lying landmass boasted peaks that resembled enlarged hills rather than towering mountains. Along the coast, from northeast to southwest, stretched the Cormorant Hills, while bamboo and plaintain forests covered the southern half of the island.\nTo the northwest of Kabudono,  the island of Hagurejima rose dramatically from the ocean.\nKabudono served as the home for fisherfolk, wako pirates, and the hsing-sing residing in the southern forests.  Known as a favored mooring spot for wako, it frequently experienced raids by Kozakuran war vessels. The port town of Yoetsu served as a harbor for the wako."
