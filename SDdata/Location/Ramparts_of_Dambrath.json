        "mainbody": "he Ramparts of Dambrath were a series of fortified locations along the sharp cliffs of the Hethar Peninsula in southern Dambrath.\nThe Ramparts had two prominent strips. The first ran for 150 miles (241 km) to the west of the most narrow strip of the Hethar Peninsula. The second strip was 100 miles (161 km) long on the eastern side of the narrow portion of the peninsula.\nMounted soldiers patrolled the cliff faces, gazing out to sea for many miles for approaching enemies. All approaching vessels were reported through signal stations that were found every 10 miles (16 km) along the coast.\nThe signal stations communicated magically with each other. This rapid communication allowed for quick assembly of appropriate fighting forces to meet any enemy landing."
