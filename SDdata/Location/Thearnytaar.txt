'''Thearnytaar''' was an ancient kingdom of [[green elves]] created during the [[First Flowering]] in {{Yearlink|-21400}}.

==History==
Thearnytaar was drawn into the [[War of Three Leaves]] against [[Syòrpiir]] and [[Eiellûr]] by the actions of assassins and spies from [[Ilythiir]] in {{Yearlink|-17100}}.

Thearnytaar entered the [[Crown Wars]] by allying with Eiellûr and declaring war against Ilythiir after Ilythiir destroyed [[Syòrpiir]] with fire in {{Yearlink|-11600}}. The [[Sable Wars]], which began in {{Yearlink|-11450}}, were a series of battles during the [[Second Crown War]]. Aided by a few allies from [[Keltormir]] and [[Shantel Othreier]], Eiellûr and Thearnytaar invaded Ilythiir, aiming to reform or conquer the [[dark elves]] before they destroyed any more realms. Over half their forces were wiped out by the dark elves' corrupt magic.

Around {{Yearlink|-11200}}, the kingdom was destroyed by the dark elf kingdom of Ilythiir during the Second Crown War.

As the ages past, the ruins of Thearnytaar were taken over by the [[Thornwood]].
