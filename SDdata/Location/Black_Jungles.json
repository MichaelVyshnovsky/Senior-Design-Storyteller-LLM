        "mainbody": "he Black Jungles were a heavily forested region of southern Tashalar on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn.\nThe Black Jungles were bordered in the west by the Hazur Mountains, in the east by the Lapal Sea, and in the north by the Delphin Mountains. The jungles ran right up to the coast of the Great Sea in the south and a smaller arm of the jungles reach the coast of the Shining Sea in the north. The Tashan Gap, though it was technically a pass between the two mountain ranges, was filled with an arm of the Black Jungles. Several rivers branching off from the Lapal Sea, including the River Amarast and River Lapar, marked the end of the Black Jungles and beginning of the Mhair Jungles.\n* River Chun\n* Pit of Vipers"
