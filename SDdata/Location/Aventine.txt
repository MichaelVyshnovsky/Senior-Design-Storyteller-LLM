Aventine was a svirfneblin city located in the Underdark near Dambrath.
The deep gnomes inhabiting Aventine, and much of the city, was destroyed by drow aided by crinti and arkaiun. Though the drow and crinti did not suffer many casualties during the attack, the arkaiun, or shebali, were nearly wiped out.
Queen Melaniths consort, Sadalar, was killed during the conflict. For their support, the drow awarded the crinti with prime drow males with whom to breed. Melanith selected a new consort from this bunch.
