The Firedrake Shores was the costal region on the Dragons Neck Peninsula that encompassed the eastern shore of Firedrake Bay, County Kargrove, and County Greenshores.
The Firedrake Shores was a relatively sheltered and secluded lush and green region. The inhabitants of the regions lived simple lives in harmony with nature. The Shores were home to many druids, rangers, and foresters. Many outsiders considered the region to be a "rude and rustic backwater," but the locals were just as judgmental of inhabitants of big, crowded, and dirty cities.
Along the shoreline, one could come across small turreted manors and small strongholds often called "toy keeps." Each fiercely protected the forests and their lands.
The Shores gorgeous and peaceful nature was due to Firedrake Bay being protected from winter storms and harsh sea winds by the Dragons Neck Peninsula.
The name "Firedrake" came from the big population of fire drakes that dwelt on the very southern edge of the Firedrake Shores. The warm sun-kissed waters were filled with a cornucopia of fish that bred freely due to little-to-none commercial fishing in the Bay.
The beasts and dangers along the Firedrake Road included ogres, venomous snakes, and human-hating wild elves.
The region was flush with all things green. Many traveling merchants came to this area of the world to purchase seeds and living plants. The local nature-loving population gladly traded these treasures but did not tolerate theft.
Firedrake Shores did not have commercial fishing done however, its rich waters produced enough to feed the locals and passers-through. One of the local seafood delicacies was smoked jaws of fish prepared with wild herbs and berries.
Small hamlets along the Firedrake Road sold such mundane goods as fishing nets, apples, living snakes, wild dogs, and snake venom.
The sea trade was almost non-existent in the region, apart from the traffic that passed through Port Kir. Many vessels were wary of an occasional pirate keel hiding away in Firedrake Bays calm waters.
This region was filled with guardians of its idyllic nature. Apart from druids and rangers, many chartered heroes and adventurers build secluded homes hidden alongside most big roads who were happy to come to natures aid when summoned. Among such group in the late 14 century DR were Knights of the Shore, an aging group of adventuring wizards, the all-female company named the Swords of the Black Opal, and the Men of the Swift Arrow.
The Firedrake Shores region was named and discovered by Calishite explorers sailing along the coasts.
*Mosstone a small green town, part of the County Greenshores, which was home of many druids and a popular caravan stop along the Trade Way.
*Port Kir along with Mosstone, part of the Greenshores that was the home for many sailors and fishers.
*Rock Orchard a hamlet along the Firedrake Road that grew apples.
*Toaketh another hamlet along the Firedrake Road named after wizard Toaketh, the inventor of never dulling Toaketh knife and other magical kitchen cutlery, who was buried there.
*Valtreth one of the hamlets along the Firedrake Road. This small village was only several buildings big and it produced fishing nets.
*Viperstone a small village popular among Calishite alchemists for its abundance of venomous snakes.
*Black Tomb of the Corsair one of the landmarks of the area, this black keep, built out of basalt, was the final resting place of the King Haedrak II, the Corsair Prince. The decaying structure was nestled on a sea cliff to the northeast from Mosstone on the Firedrake Road. The tomb overlooked a small peaceful cove, once used by pirates. By the late 14 century DR, the Black Tomb was damaged, ransacked, and emptied, sometimes inhabited by ogres from the local woods.
*Monastery of St. Domin a cloister of Ilmater that was located along the Firedrake Road, half a day travel to the north from Mosstone. This monastery was inhabited by monks and functioned as an orphanage and a school. Before 1361 DR, this building was a lair of wild dogs, and even earlier - a manor of the baron of County Kargrove.
*Druids Drive the part of the Trade Way that stretched between Mosstone and Port Kir.
*Firedrake Road a difficult "wheel-rut" road, more of a trail, that ran along the Firedrake Bays northern shore, curved south-east, touched Mosstone, and continued on along Dragons Neck Peninsula. Numerous hamlets were sprinkled along the road, many of which were unnamed.
One of the most popular local legends talked about a flying castle that fell out of the sky and was swallowed by the waters of Firedrake Bay in the ancient days. It was believed that the wild fish claimed the castle as their spawning ground. It was theories that this lost treasure was one of the floating Netherese enclaves, but none could confirm it as no sunken castle has been found as of the late 14 century DR.
