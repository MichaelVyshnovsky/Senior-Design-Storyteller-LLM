The '''Firedrake Shores''' was the costal region on the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]] that encompassed the eastern shore of [[Firedrake Bay]], County [[Kargrove]], and County [[Greenshores]].<ref name="VGTBG2-p96><ref name="VGTBG2-p98>

==Description==
The Firedrake Shores was a relatively sheltered and secluded lush and green region. The inhabitants of the regions lived simple lives in harmony with nature. The Shores were home to many [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, and foresters. Many outsiders considered the region to be a "rude and rustic backwater," but the locals were just as judgmental of inhabitants of big, crowded, and dirty cities.<ref name="VGTBG2-p96 />

Along the shoreline, one could come across small turreted manors and small strongholds often called "toy keeps." Each fiercely protected the forests and their lands.<ref name="VGTBG2-p97 />

==Geography==
The Shores' gorgeous and peaceful nature was due to Firedrake Bay being protected from winter storms and harsh sea winds by the Dragon's Neck Peninsula.<ref name="VGTBG2-p98 />

===Flora & Fauna===
The name "Firedrake" came from the big population of [[fire drake]]s that dwelt on the very southern edge of the Firedrake Shores. The warm sun-kissed waters were filled with a cornucopia of [[fish]] that bred freely due to little-to-none commercial fishing in the Bay.<ref name="VGTBG2-p98 />

The beasts and dangers along the Firedrake Road included [[ogre]]s, venomous snakes, and human-hating [[wild elves]].<ref name="VGTBG2-p99 />

==Trade==
The region was flush with all things green. Many traveling merchants came to this area of the world to purchase seeds and living plants. The local nature-loving population gladly traded these treasures but did not tolerate theft.<ref name="VGTBG2-p96 />

Firedrake Shores did not have commercial fishing done; however, its rich waters produced enough to feed the locals and passers-through. One of the local seafood delicacies was [[smoked jaws of fish]] prepared with wild [[herbs]] and berries.<ref name="VGTBG2-p98 />

Small hamlets along the Firedrake Road sold such mundane goods as fishing nets, [[apple]]s, living [[snake]]s, [[wild dog]]s, and snake [[venom]].<ref name="VGTBG2-p99 />

The sea trade was almost non-existent in the region, apart from the traffic that passed through [[Port Kir]]. Many vessels were wary of an occasional pirate keel hiding away in Firedrake Bay's calm waters.<ref name="VGTBG2-p98 />

==Defenses==
This region was filled with guardians of its idyllic nature. Apart from druids and rangers, many chartered heroes and adventurers build secluded homes hidden alongside most big roads who were happy to come to nature's aid when summoned.<ref name="VGTBG2-p96 /> Among such group in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] were [[Knights of the Shore]], an aging group of adventuring [[wizards]], the all-female company named the [[Swords of the Black Opal]], and the [[Men of the Swift Arrow]].<ref name="VGTBG2-p97>

==History==
The Firedrake Shores region was named and discovered by [[Calishite]] explorers sailing along the coasts.<ref name="VGTBG2-p98 />

==Notable Locations==
===Settlments===
*[[Mosstone]]: a small green town, part of the County [[Greenshores]], which was home of many druids and a popular caravan stop along the [[Trade Way]].<ref name="VGTBG2-p100>
*[[Port Kir]]: along with Mosstone, part of the Greenshores that was the home for many sailors and fishers.<ref name="VGTBG2-p97 />
*[[Rock Orchard]]: a hamlet along the Firedrake Road that grew apples.<ref name="VGTBG2-p99 />
*[[Toaketh]]: another hamlet along the Firedrake Road named after [[wizard]] [[Toaketh (person)|Toaketh]], the inventor of never dulling [[Toaketh knives|Toaketh knife]] and other magical kitchen [[cutlery]], who was buried there.<ref name="VGTBG2-p99 />
*[[Valtreth]]: one of the hamlets along the Firedrake Road. This small village was only several buildings big and it produced fishing nets.<ref name="VGTBG2-p99 />
*[[Viperstone]]: a small village popular among Calishite [[alchemist]]s for its abundance of [[poison|venomous]] [[snake]]s.<ref name="VGTBG2-p99 />

===Buildings===
*[[The Black Tomb of the Corsair|Black Tomb of the Corsair]]: one of the landmarks of the area, this black keep, built out of [[basalt]], was the final resting place of the King [[Haedrak II]], the Corsair Prince. The decaying structure was nestled on a sea cliff to the northeast from Mosstone on the [[Firedrake Road]]. The tomb overlooked a small peaceful cove, once used by pirates. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Black Tomb was damaged, ransacked, and emptied, sometimes inhabited by [[ogre]]s from the local woods.<ref name="VGTBG2-p97 />
*[[Monastery of St. Domin]]: a cloister of [[Ilmater]] that was located along the Firedrake Road, half a day travel to the north from Mosstone. This monastery was inhabited by [[monk]]s and functioned as an orphanage and a school. Before [[1361 DR]], this building was a lair of wild dogs, and even earlier - a manor of the baron of County Kargrove.<ref name="VGTBG2-p99 />

===Roads===
*[[Druids' Drive]]: the part of the [[Trade Way]] that stretched between Mosstone and Port Kir.<ref name="VGTBG2-p98 />
*[[Firedrake Road]]: a difficult "wheel-rut" road, more of a trail, that ran along the Firedrake Bay's northern shore, curved south-east, touched Mosstone, and continued on along Dragon's Neck Peninsula. Numerous hamlets were sprinkled along the road, many of which were unnamed.<ref name="VGTBG2-p99>

==Rumors & Legends==
One of the most popular local legends talked about a flying castle that fell out of the sky and was swallowed by the waters of Firedrake Bay in the ancient days. It was believed that the wild fish claimed the castle as their spawning ground. It was theories that this lost treasure was one of the floating [[Netherese]] enclaves, but none could confirm it as no sunken castle has been found as of the late 14{{th}} century DR.<ref name="VGTBG2-p98 />
