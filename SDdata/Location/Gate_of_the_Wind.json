        "mainbody": "he Gate of the Wind, or Bab il-Hawa, was the first gate of the great fortress of Sarahin.\nThe Gate of the Wind appeared as an archway framed by two large carvings of desert giants holding the central portion of the gate aloft.\nOnce beyond the gate, a narrow curving path led to the fortress of Sarahin. Mules and donkeys could easily navigate the path, but horses and larger animals had to be led by hand.\nThe giant carvings of the gate were actually real desert giants who sprung forward to challenge anyone who approached unbidden. They answered to Mamoud ibn Asra and had a deep hatred for all genies."
