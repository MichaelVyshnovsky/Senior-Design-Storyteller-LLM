        "Description": "The Gate of the Wind appeared as an archway framed by two large carvings of [[desert giant]]s holding the central portion of the gate aloft.\n\nOnce beyond the gate, a narrow curving path led to the fortress of Sarahin. [[Mule]]s and [[donkey]]s could easily navigate the path, but [[horse]]s and larger animals had to be led by hand.",
        "Inhabitants": "The giant carvings of the gate were actually real desert giants who sprung forward to challenge anyone who approached unbidden. They answered to [[Mamoud ibn Asra]] and had a deep hatred for all [[genie]]s."
