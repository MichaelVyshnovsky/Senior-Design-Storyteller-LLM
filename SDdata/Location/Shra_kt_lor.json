        "mainbody": "hraktlor was the largest githzerai settlement known and the military capital of their nation, located within the Plane of Limbo.\nShraktlor held the largest known githzerai population in all of the planes, numbering at around 2,000,000 people. Like all other settlements in Limbo, holding it together as a single entity required the psionic concentration of its occupants. \nThe multilayered walls hid a sea of cramped, simple quarters (very much in the ascetic githzerai fashion), though with one broad and open market square present. Foreigners were not allowed to enter the city, and were only allowed to camp outside the city walls in tents. There was no entertainment available within the entire town, and its grim atmosphere extended to the foreign quarter before the walls. The campsites by the gates were always buzzing with rumors of what was happening and was going to happen within the stronghold.\nThe city was designed in such a way that it could serve as the military base for the githzerai and also as a place for them to have to endure a \"last stand\" scenario. There was no strategic need for the city to be built as such, but rather it was created to further reinforce the general mindset of the githzerai culture.\nThe unquestioned leader of the city was the Great Githzerai Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the god-king of the nation. The city served as a way for him to project military power throughout the planes, and as well as a base of operations for raids against the githyanki. The king was served by many generals, who in turn organized the githzerai troops within the city. The generals foolishly believed that the king, preoccupied with his duties as a religious leader, could not fully comprehend the details of the military operations they carried out, which in turn led to a lot of backstabbing and struggle for power within their ranks. In reality, the in-fighting was encouraged by the king, as he believed it would make his position as leader more secure, as well as sharpen the combat instincts of his soldiers.\nDespite it primarily being a military town, it was also home to many religious figures of githzerai society such as the Zerth, whose psionic powers were required to hold the local fabric of Limbo together to keep the city from falling apart.\nShraktlor was a great place for a planar traveler to stock up on weapons and armor, as well as any other supplies that anyone expecting a combat engagement might require.  In the market square, produce grown in stabilized soil was sold, alongside some rare curios. Adventurers had to be careful to not buy too much stock, as suspiciously large purchases could end up in them receiving a less-than-pleasant visit and questioning by the city militia.\nDue to the sheer size of the town, less mundane items were available as well, but finding a merchant selling them would require a more thorough search.\nThe city served as the primary stronghold of the githzerai, and thus held the largest army the nation could muster. The town itself was protected by seven rings of tall and thick granite walls, each adorned with iron gatehouses. Order inside the walls was maintained by militia manned by companies of the military, in rotating shifts. Outside the walls the god-king decided to give this task to a band of mercenaries going by the name of the Foreign Brigade. The contract they signed entailed that every time trouble broke out in the campsites of the foreign quarter, they would have to forfeit a portion of their pay.\nThe city was known to have fallen at least once in its history. Some years before 1369 DR, a Zerth named Dakkon experienced a crisis of faith, while at the same time holding a position as a preacher. His doubt in Zerthimons teachings spread far and wide throughout the city, causing division and discord, which ultimately resulted in the local fabric of Limbo becoming chaotic again. Thus the city fell, and Dakkon was exiled.\nSometime after that fall, however, the city was rebuilt, and by 1492 DR it was known as the military capital of the githzerai once again."
