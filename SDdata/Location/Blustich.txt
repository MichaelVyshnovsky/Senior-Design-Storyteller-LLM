'''Blustich''' was a small [[hamlet]] in southern [[Cormyr]] on the edge of the [[Hermit's Wood]] and the west bank of the [[Wyvernflow]].

==Trade==
The villagers of Blustich spent most of their time hunting, fishing, and farming. They were known for their skill at ''windraising'' dances where they could summon winds strong enough to blow the nuts off [[hickory]] trees, that they then gathered up in baskets.

These dances used log [[drum]]s and gourd [[rattle]]s as instrumental accompaniment. [[Bryn Ohme Thornwood|Some]] were of the opinion that this apparent success at weather control had more to do with knowledge of the natural wind currents from the [[Lake of Dragons]], rather than a "divine response to bad music".  

The villagers harvested local [[mushroom]]s such as [[uttercap]]s, [[khondyn]], and [[thoud]]. These mushrooms were prolific around Blustich but rare elsewhere.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-03 - Mushrooms of Blustich}}
