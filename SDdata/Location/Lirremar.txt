'''Lirremar''', the '''Sixth City of the Sword''', was one of the main cities of [[Jhaamdath]]'s imperial core.

==Geography==
The Sixth City was a few days west of [[Golmuth]] and [[Gharrent]] on the southern foothills of the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. After the destruction of Jhaamdath, the ruins were built upon by the city of [[Hlondeth]].

==History==
Lirremar was founded on Jhaamdath's western frontier in {{Yearlink|-5330}} as the realm's sixth major city. Its foundation was publicly justified by the ongoing wars to the west between [[Coramshan]] and [[High Shanatar]].

Jhaamdath entered into a short era of aggressive imperial conquest in {{Yearlink|-276}}, which resulted in the deforestation of the [[Chondalwood]] and the slaughter of the [[Nikerymath]] [[elves]]. The elves retaliated in the {{YearlinkName|-255}}, by performing a [[High Magic]] ritual that caused a huge wave from the [[Inner Sea]] to wash over the heartlands of Jhaamdath. Though the new [[Vilhon Reach]] cut deep into the interior, the ruins of Lirremar remained above water and were eventually resettled as the port city of Hlondeth in [[50 DR]].

The nearby sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. These momentous changes were rapidly reverted in [[1486 DR]] when the low-lying ruins were submerged once more by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]].
