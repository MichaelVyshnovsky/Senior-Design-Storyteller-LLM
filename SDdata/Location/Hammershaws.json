        "mainbody": "Hammershaws was a village near Felmorel in the midâ€“8 century DR.\nThere was a log bridge crossing a creek.\nIn the , Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, crossed Hammershaws whilst seeking Dasumia, the Lady of Shadows, at the command of Mystra. He found no one in the village, and nothing but picked bones along the main street. Some of the bones inside a house were still sitting as if theyd died in that position. The stone hedges were overgrown, some roofs were collapsed, and there was at least one wolf-like creature lairing inside one of the houses, indicating that the place had been abandoned for some time.\nThough Elminster assumed the killing had been done by the Lady of Shadows, he never got firm confirmation of the fact."
