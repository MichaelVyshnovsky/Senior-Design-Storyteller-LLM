        "mainbody": "he Northwest District was a district of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nThe Northwest District was found in the Clothiers Quarter in the western portion of Huzuz. It was the only part of the city that could be considered a slum. Many fish markets could be found here, selling their catches from Al-Sarif River and Suq Bay. Other less-savory trades such as gambling, smuggling, and slave-trading, also occurred here.\nThe Fishers Road ran along the northeastern border of the district, separating it from the Merchants District and the Grand Bazaar. Most of the eastern border was formed by the Clothiers Way. The Clothiers District lay to the south of the Northwest District.\nMost of the population of this district were commoners, laborers, and petty criminals. The Northwest District was a haven for illicit activities, making the streets unsafe during the night.\n* the North Center\n* the Gate of the Ghost"
