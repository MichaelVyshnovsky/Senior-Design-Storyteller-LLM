'''Brotha''' was a small agricultural village found within the [[Ostel|Barony of Ostel]] in [[Damara]] southwest of [[Heliogabalus]].

==Activities==
The farmland surrounding Brotha was quite productive, helping Ostel maintain their independence from the larger baronies of Damara.

Most of the people of Brotha harbored harsh feelings toward Baroness [[Sylvia]], the ruler of Ostel. They were close allies with the people of [[Brandiar]], who also wished to dethrone their ruler (also a close ally of Sylvia).

==Inhabitants==
[[Tom Haystacks]] was the mayor of Brotha and her 400 inhabitants in 1357 DR.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that Mayor Haystacks attempted to contact the [[Twilight Riders]] to secure their aid in overthrowing Baroness Sylvia.
