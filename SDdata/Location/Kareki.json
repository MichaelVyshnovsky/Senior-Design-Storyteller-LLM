        "mainbody": "'''Karaki''' was a farming community and one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. It was known for being the former home of the famous [[Peachling Girl]].",
        "Description": "Kareki was a more prosperous village than most in the region, because it had good farming.\n\nMost of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as [[Wa-an dictionary#M|''minka'']], built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops. At the center of the village was a little courtyard containing two sculptures, one memorializing the village's founder [[Hoteo]], the other signifying the freedom-fighter [[Oe-Ura]], also known as the Peachling Girl, and her pets.\n\nAs a whole, the people of Karaki were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.\n\nThe hamlet had a population of about 340 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}.",
        "Geography": "Kareki was located along the [[Nanaichi River]] near the western edge of the [[Momoben Forest]] on the western side of the Fochu Peninsula of [[Tsukishima]]. A trail led west from the village to the settlement of [[Utumoi]] on the coast.",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]], and Kareki was no different in this respect. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed. The ''shoya'' of Kareki after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was [[Oshikochi Tanan]].",
        "Trade": "The cost to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'' was 4 [[fen]]. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 4 [[yuan]] to sell.",
        "Defenses": "About 34 citizens of Kareki served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.",
        "Religion": "Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Kareki were followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]]. Unlike the other settlements, however, they did not demand a test of faith from strangers and were more welcoming of those of other faiths.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* Hoteo, the village's founder, who was actually an ambassador from the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]].\n* Oe-Ura, the Peachling Girl.",
        "History": "Kareki was an ancient settlement, being founded as early as around {{YearlinkConvert|770|WY}} by a man named Hoteo, who was in truth sent from the [[Celestial Empire]] to reign in the rebellious [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] [[Za-Jikku]]. Hoteo created a magical [[Copper Hammer of Hoteo|copper hammer]] with which to defeat the dragon, but instead, Za-Jikku defeated Hoteo. The gods transformed Hoteo into a statue, which rose up from the very ground and stood in the middle of the village. It still held the copper hammer for a thousand years.\n\nSometime around {{YearlinkConvert|1750|WY}}, a poor farmer from Kareki was fishing in the Nanaichi River when he discovered a floating peach. The beach burst open to reveal a baby girl. The farmer took the child home to Kareki, and he and his wife raised the orphan. She grew up to be Oe-Ura, a [[river spirit folk]] who became a champion for the poor commoners of the region.\n\nHer fame concerned the [[daimyo]], and he ordered her to be executed. Her parents hid her in Momoben forest, and he had them executed instead.\n\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), the same Za-Jikku who had defeated Kareki's founder began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.\n\nAround the same time, a band of brigands known as the [[Blue Kumi Bandits]] stole the copper hammer from Hoteo's statue\n\nHowever, the hammer ended up at the bottom of a lake in the forest, within a treasure chest, which had fallen into the water when the bandits were attacked by a giant [[carp]] living in the lake.\n\nAlso at about the same time, in an unrelated occurrence, the ''shoya'' nearly died from an allergic reaction to a [[bee]] sting!"
