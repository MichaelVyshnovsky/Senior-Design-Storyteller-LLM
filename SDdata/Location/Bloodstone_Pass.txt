Bloodstone Pass was the only reasonable crossing point through the Galena Mountains in Northeast Faerûn.
The pass acted as a trade route between Damara and Vaasa. Due to the extremely impassable terrain that constituted the majority of the mountain range, the pass was the easiest route and was of great strategic importance to both Damara and Vaasa.
In the 14 Century DR, the Pass was part of Bloodstone Barony, and contained Bloodstone Village (later called Bloodstone City), the Bloodstone Mines, Lake Midai, Waukeshire, Windless, and Virdin. The Beaumaris River flowed through the Pass.
Bloodstone Pass was originally formed only around 1070 DR when the edge of the Great Glacier withdrew to the north. However, the Witch-Kings forces used the pass to invade Damara in 1347 DR, and after his defeat in 1359 DR, the Pass became one of the most impressively fortified places in Faerûn with the construction of the Bloodstone Gates.
The Pass would subsequently become the center of Gareth Dragonsbanes Kingdom of Bloodstone encompassing both Damara and Vaasa, with Bloodstone City as its capital.
In 1469 DR, the Warlock Knights invaded the Pass and razed Bloodstone City, leaving the once lush Bloodstone Valley barren and lifeless.
