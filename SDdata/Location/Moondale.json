        "mainbody": "'''Moondale''' was one of the largest and most prosperous of the [[Dalelands]], located in the southeastern region deep within the expansive forest of [[Cormanthor]].",
        "History": "Moondale was one of the first dales founded after the raising of the [[Standing Stone]] in [[1 DR]]. The dale enjoyed rapid growth and flourishing trade, particularly with the nearby nation of [[Sembia]]. This growing alliance culminated with the peaceful annexation of the people of the dale by Sembia sometime around [[1070 DR]]. Eventually the merchant kingdom founded the city of [[Ordulin]] over the former dale, which quickly grew into a bustling metropolis and was declared Sembia's capital.",
        "Geographical features": "Whereas the Ordulin of 14{{th}} century was separated from the [[Elven Wood]], Moondale existed in the age when the great forest stretched all the way east to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Deep in the forest, Moondale was nestled in a wide valley of grassland."
