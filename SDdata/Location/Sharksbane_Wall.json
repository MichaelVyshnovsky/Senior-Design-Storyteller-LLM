        "mainbody": "The '''Sharksbane Wall''' was a 135 mile (217 km.) long barrier protecting [[Serôs]]. Construction on it began in {{Yearlink|-9845}} to connect the garrison towers among the [[Sharksteeth Mounts]] known as the Pillars of the Trident. It was completed in {{Yearlink|-8938}}. The wall stretched between the [[Akanapeaks]] of northernmost [[Chessenta]] and southwestern most [[Altumbel]], southwest of [[Delthuntle]]. The effort was started by the clergy of [[Deep Sashelas]], [[Eadro]], and particularly [[Persana]]. However, after the tritons slowly stopped contributing to the effort of manning the wall, Persana was replaced by [[Trishina]] as an official god of the Pillars.\n\nThe wall effectively imprisoned the [[sahuagin]] in the southeastern arm of the [[Inner Sea]]. Strong armies could overwhelm defending forces and storm over the wall, but no raiders could slip through casually or unnoticed. Over the nine centuries following its completion, sahuagin west of the Wall were ruthlessly hunted down and exterminated. However, in {{Yearlink|1369}} the megalodon [[Iakhovas]] the Ravager used an unknown artifact to blow a two mile long hole in the Wall.<ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Spellplague]] the top of the wall was submerged at a depth that allowed ships to easily pass over. When the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] receded as a result of the Spellplague, the top of the wall was left 30 feet (9 m.) above the surface.",
