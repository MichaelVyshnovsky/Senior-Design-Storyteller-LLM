}}The '''Swagdar''', or the '''Outlaw Waste''', was a large stretch of land located just northwest of [[Dambrath]].

==Geography==
This rolling grassland was filled with hidden valleys. The Swagdar covered a 150 square mile (390 km<sup>2</sup>) area.

==Inhabitants==
This land comprised the only remaining free place for the [[Arkaiun]]. Small bands gathered together here to raid the countryside of Dambrath and the hated [[crinti]]. Sometimes they even ventured to nearby [[Halruaa]]. Arkaiun raiders were slain if caught, so battles with these people were fierce. If the bandits were able to capture children, they would raise them within their culture.

As of [[1367 DR]], there were several thousand bandits living within the Swagdar, but a single strong leader was yet to arise to unite them.
