Though not technically a single district, the Caravan District referred to the area surrounding each of the gates of Huzuz.
The Caravan District was crowded with inns, taverns, hostels, animal stalls, and caravanserais. 
Mosques were even located in or around the Caravan District so enlightened Zakharans did not need to travel far in order to worship.
The Caravan Districts were designed so that caravan masters and traders could acquire everything needed to load or unload their cargo and enjoy themselves, all within a short vicinity of one of Huzuzs gates.
