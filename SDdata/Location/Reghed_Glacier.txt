The '''Reghed Glacier''' was a glacial wasteland north of the [[Spine of the World]]. The region was so desolate and isolated that few travelers dared to cross near its eastern border, let alone venture atop its icy facade.

The [[Reghedman]] [[barbarians]] of [[Icewind Dale]] took their name from this glacier.

==Geography==
[[File:Reghed Glacier.png|thumb|''The Reghed Glacier.'']]
The Reghed Glacier formed the eastern boundary of [[Icewind Dale]] and was bordered by the Spine of the World to the south. 

To the east of the glacier was a frozen wasteland; beyond that was the enormous [[Endless Ice Sea]] glacier. Sometimes, the Reghed Glacier was confused with the Endless Ice Sea.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Evermelt]]: In contrast to the unforgiving cold, this bubbling spring was a haven of warmth and a sacred location to the barbarian tribes.
* [[Ythryn]]: The ancient enclave of [[Netheril]] came crashing down into the Glacier during [[Karsus's Folly]]. 

==Rumors & Legends==
The Reghedmen barbarians claimed the [[giant]]s of the [[Dawn Age]] created the glacier to mark the edge of their territory.

==Inhabitants==
The Reghed Glacier was home to the white dragon [[Ingeloakastimizilian]], also known as Icingdeath, who was slain by [[Wulfgar]]. Icingdeath's underground lair was located beneath the Evermelt hot springs.

Not much more was known about any other inhabitants that may have dwelled on or within the glacier.
