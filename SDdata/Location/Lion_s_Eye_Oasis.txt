The '''Lion's Eye''' was an oasis found in [[the Sword]] region of [[Anauroch]].

==Description==
The Lion's Eye was said to be the most lush of the oases found in the entirety of the desert.

==Geography==
===Geographical Features===
Within the center of the Lion's Eye was a small lake that was encircled by ascending grasslands that was dotted with wildflowers and large boulders.

A rocky outcropping  on the eastern stretch reached an apex that was referred to as the actual "Lion's Eye". As the winds whipped over the plains they passed through a hole in this rock formation creating a moaning sound that permeated the landscape.

===Flora & Fauna===
The sand dunes that comprised the western area of the oasis were dotted with [[mesquite]] trees that led into a southern stretch of [[acacia]] and [[palm]] trees.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that the lake in the center of the oasis held submerged treasure chests that were filled with an abundance of [[gold]] and glimmering [[gem]]s. Further rumors spoke of [[magic]]al items belonging to ancient civilizations that were protected by some form of underwater monstrosities.

==Inhabitants==
Unlike many oases found in Anauroch, the Lion's Eye was not home to the [[Bedine]] people, but rather a community of [[lamia]]s. They grazed upon their verdant stretch of the desert, hunting any intruders that dare pass over their land.
