The Lions Eye was an oasis found in the Sword region of Anauroch.
The Lions Eye was said to be the most lush of the oases found in the entirety of the desert.
Within the center of the Lions Eye was a small lake that was encircled by ascending grasslands that was dotted with wildflowers and large boulders.
A rocky outcropping  on the eastern stretch reached an apex that was referred to as the actual "Lions Eye". As the winds whipped over the plains they passed through a hole in this rock formation creating a moaning sound that permeated the landscape.
The sand dunes that comprised the western area of the oasis were dotted with mesquite trees that led into a southern stretch of acacia and palm trees.
It was said that the lake in the center of the oasis held submerged treasure chests that were filled with an abundance of gold and glimmering gems. Further rumors spoke of magical items belonging to ancient civilizations that were protected by some form of underwater monstrosities.
Unlike many oases found in Anauroch, the Lions Eye was not home to the Bedine people, but rather a community of lamias. They grazed upon their verdant stretch of the desert, hunting any intruders that dare pass over their land.
