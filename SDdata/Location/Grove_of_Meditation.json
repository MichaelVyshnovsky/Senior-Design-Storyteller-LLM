        "Effects": "It was a great boon to [[elves]] who practiced [[magic]]. Elven [[magic-user]]s with a high degree of intelligence were the only ones who could benefit from the grove. When an elven mage or [[fighter]]-mage meditated in the grove, they were able to advance their abilities further than they would otherwise. However, that elf would have to meditate in the Grove of Meditation for up to six months, morning until evening, every day. After this, the [[Earthmother|goddess]] granted them enough insight to advance themselves. The grove was a reusable resource; an elf could use the grove for as long as they still had something to learn."
