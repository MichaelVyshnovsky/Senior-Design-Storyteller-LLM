Elion was a northern fishing town on the island of Evermeet within the Trackless Sea. 
It was governed by a council elected to settle disputes and maintain order. 
Most of the villagers were fishermen and kept to themselves. While extremely loyal to Queen Amlaruil Moonflower, the town remained neutral in political and military issues.
