'''Skultan''' was a village near [[Daerlun]] in [[Sembia]], ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}}

==Geography==
This village was a short distance north of the [[Way of the Manticore]], east of Daerlun.
Skultan was among the gnome settlements linked through the [[magic]]al transportation network known as the [[Trail of Mists]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}

==Trade==
Skultan was known as a place where illicitly acquired goods could be fenced, coins could be exchanged between [[Cormyr]]ean and [[Sembia]]n currencies, and equipment could be repaired. Wagons, horses, and other trade-related items were bought and sold here in rapid fashion with no questions asked.

Two locations for underhanded dealings, [[The Tumbling Goblets]] and [[The Winking Wemic]], were [[gnome]]-run [[festhall]]s staffed with attractive [[human]] females.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that the [[Purple Dragon]]s of Cormyr looked the other way when it came to back-door transactions at the festhalls, accepting bribes in the form of discounted "services" from those establishments.
