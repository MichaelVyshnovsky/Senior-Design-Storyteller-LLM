        "mainbody": "he Bonedark Hills was the name given by the people of Thesk to a bleak and gray region of badlands in eastern Thesk and western Thay created by the upheavals of the Spellplague. The area was known to the Thayans as the Contested Lands.\nThe land was broken by the rising and eruption of the Thaymount, resulting in scree fields and steep terrain riddled with twisting passes and tunnels. Travel through the area could be difficult and exhausting.\nThe Bonedark Hills were a broad area across eastern Thesk extending into Thays political boundaries down the western base of the Thayan Plateau. Precarious switchback trails led up the jagged, nearly vertical cliffs of the Plateau to Thay proper, with tax stations, guard posts, and arcane siege engines protecting the routes.\nThe region was formed during the apocalyptic events of the Spellplague in the , and left the towns of Nethentir, Nethjet, and Surcross broken. In the century that followed, Thayan forces would begin to fortify these towns, much to the concern of Thesk. By the late 15 century DR, the Thayans&mdashat the behest of Szass Tam&mdashhad begun transforming these forts into Dread Rings and his agents continually tested Thays neighbors borders by raiding villages to capture slaves to work in Thayan mines. Seeking some advantage in this relationship, Thesk founded Echo Village as a trade outpost in hopes that establishing commerce with Thay.\nIn the , the tensions between Thay and Netheril flared and the Netherese enclave of Kolthunral arrived in the area in a surprise attack to deny the Thayans access to the Shadowfell Road, which they were using to further their ambitions at a Dread Ring across Faer√ªn near Neverwinter. Over the following months, the flying city unleashed a bombardment that decimated a large swath of the land, forcing Thay onto the defensive at both Surcross and Veil.\n* The Charnel Fields, a vast plain of death and destruction west of Surcross created by the bombardment of the flying city Kolthunral.\n* The Shadow Veil, a massive and stable rift between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell that extended across the landscape near the town of Veil.\n* Echo Village, a Theskian trading outpost that was butchered by Thayan forces.\n* Nethentir, a Thayan fort as of the late 15 century DR.\n* Nethjet, a Thayan fort as of the late 15 century DR.\n* Relsforin, the lone village to endure within the Charnel Fields.\n* Surcross, a Thayan fort and largest of the communities in the Bonedark Hills as of the late 15 century DR.\n* Veil, a Thayan-occupied village named for the Shadow Veil, which passed through the heart of town.\nThe residents of the area lived mostly in very small and scattered communities.\nAs a border region between Thesk and imperialistic Thay, the Bonedark Hills were patrolled by murderous Thayan soldiers (both living and all manner of undead), including gnolls and orcs. These patrols sometimes rode skeletal steeds or made use of chariots&mdashboth heavy vehicles pulled by undead beasts as well as lighter ones that propelled themselves by magic.\n* Dempharis Sibront, a Red Wizard enemy of Szass Tam and self-proclaimed \"zulkir in exile\" who sought to subvert Thayan authority in the area.\n* Eyeloe, an imp in service to Szass Tam who laired in a cave within the region.\n* Renault Abrecht, the commander of the Thayan forces at Veil as of 1479 DR.\n* Ukulsid, the commander of the Thayan forces at Surcross as of 1479 DR."
