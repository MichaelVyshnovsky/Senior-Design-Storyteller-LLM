        "mainbody": "The '''Bonedark Hills''' was the name given by the people of [[Thesk]] to a bleak and gray region of badlands in eastern Thesk and western [[Thay]] created by the upheavals of the [[Spellplague]]. The area was known to the Thayans as the '''Contested Lands'''.</ref >",
        "Description": "The land was broken by the rising and eruption of the [[Thaymount]], resulting in [[Wikipedia:Scree|scree fields]] and steep terrain riddled with twisting passes and tunnels. Travel through the area could be difficult and exhausting.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Radiant Vessel of Thesk|8}}",
        "Geography": "The Bonedark Hills were a broad area across eastern Thesk extending into Thay's political boundaries down the western base of the Thayan Plateau. Precarious switchback trails led up the jagged, nearly vertical cliffs of the Plateau to Thay proper, with [[tax station]]s, guard posts, and [[arcane siege engine]]s protecting the routes.",
        "History": "The region was formed during the apocalyptic events of the Spellplague in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, and left the towns of [[Nethentir]], [[Nethjet]], and [[Surcross]] broken. In the century that followed, Thayan forces would begin to fortify these towns, much to the concern of Thesk. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Thayans&mdash;at the behest of [[Szass Tam]]&mdash;had begun transforming these forts into [[Dread Ring]]s and his agents continually tested Thay's neighbors' borders by raiding villages to capture [[slave]]s to work in Thayan mines. Seeking some advantage in this relationship, Thesk founded [[Echo Village]] as a trade outpost in hopes that establishing commerce with Thay.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[Shadovar-Thay War|the tensions]] between Thay and [[Netheril]] flared and the [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Kolthunral]] arrived in the area in a surprise attack to deny the Thayans access to the [[Shadowfell Road]], which they were using to further their ambitions at a [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] across [[Faer√ªn]] near [[Neverwinter]]. Over the following months, the flying city unleashed a bombardment that decimated a large swath of the land, forcing Thay onto the defensive at both Surcross and [[Veil (town)|Veil]].",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Geographic Features": "* The [[Charnel Fields]], a vast plain of death and destruction west of Surcross created by the bombardment of the flying city Kolthunral.\n* The [[Shadow Veil]], a massive and stable [[shadow crossing|rift]] between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Shadowfell]] that extended across the landscape near the town of Veil.",
            "Settlements": "* [[Echo Village]], a Theskian trading outpost that was butchered by Thayan forces.\n* [[Nethentir]], a Thayan fort as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Nethjet]], a Thayan fort as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Relsforin]], the lone village to endure within the Charnel Fields.\n* [[Surcross]], a Thayan fort and largest of the communities in the Bonedark Hills as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Veil (town)|Veil]], a Thayan-occupied village named for the Shadow Veil, which passed through the heart of town."
