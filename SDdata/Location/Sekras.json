        "Geography": "Sekras sat along the shore of the [[Blue Sword River]] in close proximity to the border with [[Mulhorand]].",
        "Activities": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, a machine that filtered salt from [[Azulduth]] from the river still operated in Sekras. Only a handful of [[priest]]s of [[Thoth]] understood how it worked.",
        "History": "In the time of ancient Mulhorand, Sekras was known for contributing to the development of new weapon technologies. Between [[-700 DR]] and [[-200 DR]], many advancements were made in the development of Mulhorandi [[sword]]s, such as the [[khopesh]].\n\nSekras was once the center of worship of [[Sebek]], the Lord of Crocodiles. The city thus became infested with [[werecrocodile]]s, prompting [[paladin]]s of [[Osiris]] to eradicate them in the {{YearlinkName|1183}}. Sekras was reduced to ruins during this process, and the [[Lake of Salt]]. The paladins who drove them out went on to found the [[Brotherhood of Those Who Smile in the Face of Death]].\n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ruins were once again notable for the presence of werecrocodiles."
