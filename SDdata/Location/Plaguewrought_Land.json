        "mainbody": "The '''Plaguewrought Land''', also called the '''Plaguewrought Lands''' and the '''Changing Lands''',{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Year of the Ageless One}} was the largest [[plagueland]] in [[Faerûn]] following the events of the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Geography": "The Plaguewrought Land occupied an area south of the [[Vilhon Wilds]] and the [[Chondalwood]] where [[Sespech]] and [[Chondath]] had once stood.",
        "Description": "The Plaguewrought Lands were said to be surreal but breathtakingly beautiful and grand. Inside this plagueland, the ground heaved like waves on the ocean and pieces of land levitated randomly to form [[earthmote]]s. The vegetation was strange and twisted, and could sprout, mature, and then die in a matter of minutes. Most people who travelled into this region were killed very quickly by the [[wild magic]]. Everything within the Plaguewrought Land&mdash;be it land, flesh, or the laws of nature&mdash;was contorted and changeable. It was the only place where [[plaguegrass]] was known to grow.",
        "History": "The border of the Plaguewrought Land remained more or less stable for the decades following the Spellplague. Pilgrims, encouraged by the [[Order of Blue Fire]], often travel to the Plaguewrought Land in the hopes of acquiring a [[spellscar]].\n\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s DR, the Plaguewrought Lands were erased. Many of the settlements in the Vilhon that had been thought destroyed returned to Toril in one form or another.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Q&A 16}}<ref><ref>{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Q&A 16}}<ref group=\"note\">While the fate of the Plaguewrought Land and Vilhon Wilds after the Second Sundering has not been explained, a map of Faerûn in ''Places & Portals'' shows the original terrain of the Vilhon Reach, suggesting it has been undone."
