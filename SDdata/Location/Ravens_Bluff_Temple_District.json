        "mainbody": "The '''Temple District''' of [[Ravens Bluff]] was an important and very wealthy region of the city, home to a great many of its [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|noble families]], [[Merchant houses of Ravens Bluff|merchant houses]],, shops and businesses, and finer mansions and estates. Within its borders were the grand and imposing [[Ravendark Castle]], which overlooked the city's [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]], the city's [[Hangman's Courthouse|courthouse]] and the Realms-famous [[Ravens Bluff Playhouse|Ravenian playhouse]]. \n\nThe district had four distinct neighborhoods. While they were all fairly wealthy and prosperous, each was defined by its own unique characteristics.",
        "Organizations": "The knights of Ravens Bluff had a strong presence within the Temple District. Their main headquarters, the [[Hall of the Raven]], was located in [[Altarside]],",
        "Neighborhoods": {
            "[[Gowntown]]": "This neighborhood was the safest and perhaps the most wealthy neighborhood in the Temple District. The [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] maintained heavy patrols down [[Raphiel Road]] and [[Blacktree Boulevard]] to protect the many [[priest]]s returning to their luxury apartments, such as those in [[Hengelhouse]]. Not even the city's great many adventurers were brazen enough to brandish even holstered [[weapon]]s in this locale.",
            "[[Holyhouses]]": "While not quite as affluent as Gowntown, the Holyhouses neighborhood contained some of the city's most spectacular architecture, featured in the locale's many temples, most notably the [[Silver Halls]] and the [[Tower of Holy Revelry]]. Adding to the luxuriousness and beauty were the many palatial manors and noble estates, such as [[Ondrelspires]] and [[Elderstars]]. The numerous Guildhalls on [[Manycoins Way]] and [[DeVillars Ride]] lent a great amount of wealth and activity to the local hustle and bustle.",
            "[[Swordspoint]]": "A more modest and business-oriented region of the district, Swordspoint featured a great many stores and specialty shops, such as the famous-but-exploded magic shoppe [[Chemcheaux]], and even a [[Elonia's Beauty Shoppe|beauty salon]] that offered tattoos to their clientele. It was an immensely popular destination for sightseers from out of town, who could stroll through the Bluff's [[DeVillars Park|largest city park]], and it was a sprawling shopping plaza of sorts for Ravenian citizens.",
            "[[Altarside]]": "Altarside was perhaps the busiest of the district's neighborhoods, as it housed a massive [[Ravendark Castle|imposing castle]], On the west side of the neighborhood, the massive [[bronze]] Gates of the Watchful Raven opened up to the [[Seaglimpse]] neighborhood in the [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]]."
