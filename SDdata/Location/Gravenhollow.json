        "mainbody": "ravenhollow was a mystic library in the Underdark. It was a serene repository of knowledge set within the chaotic underworld of Faer√ªn.\nGravenhollows location was to the west of the Wormwrithings. It was  from Gauntlgrym and  from Mantol-Derith. \nGravenhollow was carved out of a titanic geode imbued with faerzress.\nThe library was a peculiar building for many reasons it was outside the normal time of Toril, everybody inside it understood all languages, it was bigger on the inside, it prevented works of magic except divination, and nobody could find it without its keepers will.\nA very peculiar trait of Gravenhollow was that it \"remembered\" all who had walked its halls, as well as those who would visit the library in the future. People exploring the library found apparitions constantly flicking in and out of existence around them. These were the echoes of those who had come or would come to Gravenhollow in search of knowledge.\nNobody knew who built Gravenhollow, but it was known to have existed since the dawn of giant-kin."
