'''Pelleor's Prairie''', sometimes called the '''Prairie of Pelleor''', was a large grassland located in the [[Backlands]] of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
The Prairie was a warm, dry, and windy plain of tall [[grass]]es. Both water and shelter were rare on the open grassland. 

==Geography==
The name "Pelleor's Prairie" was given to the grasslands between the [[Battle of Bones]] to the south and the [[Marsh of Chelimber]] and the [[Shaeradim]] to the north. It was bounded to the east by the [[Anauroch]] desert and to the west by the [[Serpent's Tail Stream]]. 

The [[Hill of Lost Souls]] dominated the southeastern reaches of the prairieland, and the soil near the mountain was more volcanic than elsewhere on the prairie.

===Flora & Fauna===
The prairie was home to a wide variety of vegetation, including an incredible number of unique types of grass Wildflowers bloomed in the summer and autumn, creating seas of vibrant colors across the normally green and tan plains. [[bison-gourd]], [[water globe]], [[camel tree]], and [[silver tree]]. Dangerous plants included [[razor grass]], [[squid jail]], [[hooded monk]],

The prairie was home to many types of animals, including [[prairie dog]]s, [[bison]], wild [[horse]]s, [[ant]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and [[snake]]s (including [[giant snake]]s as well as venomous [[dead grass snake]]s and [[reed snake]]s). 

Monstrous fauna of the prairie included [[ankheg]]s&mdash;notably [[lava ankheg]]s found near the Hill of Lost Souls Additionally, [[roc]]s from the [[Greycloak Hills]] and [[Sunset Mountains]] were known to hunt on the prairie, as were [[green dragon]]s from the [[Forest of Wyrms]].

}}Pelleor's Prairie had a mild climate, generally experiencing only short winters beginning in [[Nightal]] with any lingering snow melted by [[Ches]]. The plains most often experienced sunny and dry weather, meaning that [[sun sickness]] and wildfires could be sources of concern year-round, especially during the summer. Temperatures on the prairieland ranged from about {{SI|103|F}} at the hottest to {{SI|15|F}} at their coldest, and the area received about {{SI|32|inches|c|long=yes}} of rain annually, much of which was delivered by savage thunderstorms. These were the result of the mixing of hot desert air from the [[Anauroch]], which arrived usually in [[Mirtul]] to herald the beginning of spring, with moist air from the [[Marsh of Chelimber]] and the [[High Moor]]. These conditions created massive and awe-inspiring thunderclouds that could be seen for miles. 

Wildfires sparked by lightning strikes and fed by the region's winds were one of the greatest hazards of the prairie such that local [[druid]]s had been known to alter the weather to bring rain if they believed the danger of a catastrophic fire to be too high.

==History==
In the time of ancient [[Netheril]], this region was the site of fertile farmlands.

Pelleor's Prairie was named in honor of [[Pelleor|Pelleor the Wanderer]], a [[ghost]] said to have been a soldier who died at the [[Battle of Bones]] who eternally wandered the region trying to find the comrades who left him behind as they retreated.

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the druids of the region observed that the Anauroch desert was slowly expanding and encroaching on the prairieland. They began investigating whether this expansion was natural or [[magical]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Some settlers reported that a hill would occasionally "come alive" and move of its own accord with sufficient speed to destroy their homes. It was unknown whether these "rolling hills" were moved by magic or were perhaps some kind of creature, potentially a large [[earth elemental]] or a massive subterranean [[turtle]].

==Notable Locations==
The most notable landmark was the [[Hill of Lost Souls]], a dormant volcano that sat in the southeast of the prairie.

There were no notable permanent settlements on the Prairie itself, but [[Drawn Swords]] and [[Yarthrain]] lay near its southeastern border.

==Inhabitants==
Pelleor's Prairie was home to a [[druid circle]] that maintained the land and monitored the safety and actions of visitors as well as of the occasional caravans that crossed the plains.

Most [[humanoid]] inhabitants of the prairie dwelt in the west and north, putting distance between themselves and the Anauroch to the east and the Battle of Bones to the south. Life was harsh and resources were scarce&mdash;particularly water&mdash;thus it was somewhat rare to find a settlement of more than one family. Homes were usually made of sod, with some living in structures of [[wood]] where it could be found or simply in tents where nothing better was available.

The Prairie was also home to prides of [[wemic]]s. Individual prides were sometimes no bigger than a mated pair and their cubs. The prides dwelt in the north of the region, and each carved out territory for hunting but also engaged in some small-scale farming.

A near mythical inhabitant of the Prairie was the [[Great White Bison]], a spectral creature said to be the "leader" of all bison in the region.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Mrowl]], a wise wemic who was leader of the [[Rambrowrl]] pride in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Pheszeltan]], the [[Hierophant]] Druid in charge of the prairie in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Tharnn Greenwinter]], a [[half-elf]] druid active in the region in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.
