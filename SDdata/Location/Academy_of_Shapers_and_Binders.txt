The Academy of Shapers and Binders was a magic academy for the Red Wizards of Thay, located on Thaymount in Thay. The school specialized in transmutation magic. Its motto was "Nothing is immutable."
The headmistress was Nefris and among the instructors were Safiya, Djalfi, and Araman. A famous student was Ammon Jerro.
Passing through a small valley, a path with glowing, apparently magical lanterns led the way to the academy. Various walls and hostile Thayan gnolls protected the academy.
The academy was founded by the Founder, a female Red Wizard and lover of the Chosen of Myrkul, Akachi, as part of her plan to free her lover.
Kalach-Cha briefly traveled to The Academy of Shapers and Binders by using a secret portal in the Plane of Shadows in Mulsantir, which was located in Rashemen.
However, just before the Kalach-Cha arrived there to confront the Founder, Araman launched a coup and seized control of the academy, killing many, including the former headmistress of the Academy and the students and teachers loyal to her. However, some classes continued despite the coup, and the corpses that were strewn about the entrance.
