        "Description": "The Keep was a forbidding fortress that earned its name from the inhabitants' tradition of painting the skulls of fallen enemies and comrades with red [[dye]] and haphazardly mounting them in the Keep's great hall. The collection was said to include hundreds of [[human]], [[dwarf]], and [[orc]] skulls, as well as prominently displayed [[Giant|giantkin]] and [[wyvern]] specimens.",
        "Geography": "Bloodskull Keep was quite isolated. It was located in central [[Thar]] northwest of the [[Tormel River]]'s source at [[Bloodmuck]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}",
        "History": "The Keep was originally the home of the Black Spear orc tribe. They were one of the stronger tribes among the [[humanoids]] and [[goblinoids]] of Thar, and from Bloodskull Keep they managed a series of smaller strongholds spread throughout the moorland. Sometime in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Black Spears' chieftain passed away and their [[clerics]] of [[Gruumsh]] seized control of the tribe and the Keep. Shortly after, the Keep was usurped by the [[half-orc]] [[Wertha]], who rallied many of the tribes' warriors against the Gruumshites. Wertha and his faction then adopted the Keep's name, calling themselves the [[Bloody Skull (Thar)|Bloody Skulls]], as they waged a civil war against the Gruumshites holed up in the tribe's outlying strongholds.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Blood Skulls were again one of the most powerful tribes in Thar, and the Keep was ruled by an orc chieftain named [[Mhurren]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Mhurren formed an alliance with [[Kardhel Terov]] of the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]] in order to conquer Thar and cities on the [[Moonsea]]. Mhurren became the leader of a coalition of orcs, goblinoids, and [[ogres]] who sacked [[Glister]] and marched on [[Hulburg]], but he was killed and his army was scattered at the [[Battle of Lendon's Dike]]. With this defeat, the power of Bloodskull Keep was broken, leading to a period of war between the tribes of Thar as they vied to fill the power vacuum."
