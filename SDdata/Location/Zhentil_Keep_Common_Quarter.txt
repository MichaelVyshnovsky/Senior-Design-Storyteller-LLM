The Common Quarter was by far the largest section within the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid–14 century DR.
The Common Quarter dominated much of Zhentil Keep on the northern shore of the River Tesh and the Moonsea. The quarter fully encircled that section of the city, surrounding the smaller Inner Quarter and Harbor District found in the center of the city.

Two main gates allowed access to the Common Quarter via road–the Trail Gate along the Zhentilar Trail to the west, and the Dragon Gate along the Dragon Trail to the east. The Common Quarter was accessible from the south by way of the North Force Gate on the Force Bridge and the North Tesh Gate on the Tesh Bridge.
The vast majority of Zhentil Keeps population lived within the Common Quarter. Buildings here were crowded together to maximize space for the masses and patched together with a network of main streets and smaller broken unnamed roadways.
Zhentilar guardposts, barracks, and armories were situated throughout the entire quarter.
