The '''Common Quarter''' was by far the largest section within the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Common Quarter dominated much of [[Zhentil Keep]] on the northern shore of the [[River Tesh]] and the [[Moonsea]]. The quarter fully encircled that section of the city, surrounding the smaller [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] and [[Zhentil Keep/Harbor District|Harbor District]] found in the center of the city.

==Description==
Two main gates allowed access to the Common Quarter via road–the [[Trail Gate]] along the [[Zhentilar Trail]] to the west, and the [[Dragon Gate]] along the [[Dragon Trail (Zhentil Keep)|Dragon Trail]] to the east. The Common Quarter was accessible from the south by way of the [[North Force Gate]] on the [[Force Bridge]] and the [[North Tesh Gate]] on the [[Tesh Bridge]].

==Activities==
The vast majority of Zhentil Keep's population lived within the Common Quarter. Buildings here were crowded together to maximize space for the masses and patched together with a network of main streets and smaller broken unnamed roadways.

==Defenses==
[[Zhentilar]] guardposts, barracks, and armories were situated throughout the entire quarter.

==Notable Locations==
* The [[High House of the Hunt]]
* The [[Tower of Pain Exalted]]
* The [[Silver Trumpet Inn]]
