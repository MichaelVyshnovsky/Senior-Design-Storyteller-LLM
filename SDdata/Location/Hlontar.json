        "History": "Hlontar was founded by the [[wizard]] [[Alokkair]], who came from one of the [[Netheril#Survivor States|survivor states]] of [[Netheril]] after they had been swallowed by [[Anauroch]]. Alokkair supported the warrior [[Hlonagh]] in subduing rival warlords in the region and founding the kingdom of Hlontar in the [[536 DR|Year of the Laughing Lich, 536 DR]]. Alokkair served as Hlonagh's court wizard for a time. Finally, Alokkair slew Hlonagh and became wizard-king of Hlontar himself. Alokkair's rule was cruel and ruthless.\n\nIn [[569 DR]], Alokkair's three daughters led a rebellion against him. Only the youngest survived, forcing Alokkair into hiding in a secret refuge in southern Hlontarâ€”a cave in the [[Fox Ridge]] of Shadowdale.\n\nAlokkair had long-term plans to reinstall himself as ruler of Hlontar and considered the [[Zhentarim]] to be squatters in his kingdom even in [[1375 DR]]."
