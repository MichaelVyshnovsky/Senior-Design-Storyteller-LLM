Kourmira () was the capital city of the Tuigan empire of Yaïmmunahar in the Hordelands in 1375 DR.
Kourmira was named after the western realm of Cormyr to honor the man who slew Hubadai Khahans father.

The capital was situated along a strategic spot on the Golden Way where the Winterflow River passed through Kora Shan. Kourmira sat along the southern bank of the river.
As of 1375 DR, much of Kourmira was filled primarily with tents. However, the new Khahan wasted no time in enlisting the aid of the dwarves of Siremun to begin constructing permanent buildings. Many of these buildings were built with precious skystone, causing the structures to shine like jewels.
Hubadai moved quickly to erect stout stone walls around the land allotted for the city to protect against the threat of attack.
The Red Wizards of Thay established a merchant enclave in Kourmira in 1374 DR.
Many of the steppe nomads relocated to the capital, or the area surrounding it, during the frigid winter months to avoid confrontations with gnolls and other beasts who prowled the steppes.
Kourmira was founded in 1367 DR, just four years after Hubadai Khahan established the empire of Yaïmmunahar.
