        "mainbody": "Araundordoom was a rather typical doom in the Underdark of Faer√ªn controlled by the once-human lich Araundor.\nLike most lich dooms, Araundordoom was a labyrinthine network of twisted tunnels and cave rooms, with hiding places for magic items. \nAraundor filled pools of water in his doom with poison and snare traps to grab intruders legs. He would hide underwater in such pools or in pools of mud through which they could also be trapped. Araundor avoided placing crushing traps, because liches were not immune to being physically smashed.\nAraundor discovered the passageways and rooms that he claimed as his doom."
