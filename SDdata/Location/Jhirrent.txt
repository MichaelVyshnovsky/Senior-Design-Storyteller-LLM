'''Jhirrent''', the '''Ninth City of the Sword''', was one of the twelve major cities in the imperial heartlands of ancient [[Jhaamdath]].

==Geography==
The Ninth City was northeast of the capital [[Naarkolyth]] on the [[Bay of Jhaamdath]], in the foothills between the [[Aphrunn Mountains]] and [[Orsraun Mountains]]. After its destruction, the ruins lay on the [[Selmal Basin]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
Jhirrent was founded in the {{Yearlink|-4850}}, as the ninth of the realm's core cities.

In the {{YearlinkName|-276}}, Jhamdaath began a campaign of aggressively logging the [[Chondalwood]] and slaughtering many [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]]. In return, the elves performed a grand [[High Magic]] ritual in {{Yearlink|-255}} that caused a huge wave from the [[Inner Sea]] to surge across the imperial core of Jhaamdath and wash away its people and cities. The massive movement of water created the Vilhon Reach and sank Jhirrent like most of the other Cities of the Sword, and its [[psionic]] artifacts were buried in the sea floor.

The sunken cities of Jhaamdath were revealed after the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]] by dropping sea levels, becoming the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. The situation was then returned to its previous state in [[1486 DR]] by the [[Great Rain]] and [[Second Sundering]] that covered them in seawater once more.
