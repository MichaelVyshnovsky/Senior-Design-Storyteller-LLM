        "mainbody": "The '''Dessarin Valley''', also known as the '''Gateway to the North''' by its residents, was a valley region situated between the [[Sword Mountains]] and the [[High Forest]].\n\nThe Dessarin was unlike the rest of the [[Savage Frontier]]. While it was largely unsettled, comprising many scattered, remote villages and farmsteads, the valley was much safer than the surrounding area had been in years past.",
        "Geography": "The region of the Dessarin Valley was bordered on the east by the [[High Forest]] and the [[Forlorn Hills]], and on the west by the [[Long Road]].",
        "Geographical Features": {
            "Mountains and hills": "* [[Dessarin Hills]]: These rugged hills held a number of ancient [[dwarven]] ruins and were home to [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and other fearsome beasts.\n* [[Sumber Hills]]: The badlands located on either side of the [[River Dessarin]] held a number of notable locations, such as the [[Halls of the Hunting Axe]] ruins and the [[Feathergale Spire]] in the [[Sighing Valley]].\n<!--[[Sword Mountains]]-->\n<!--",
            "Forests": "[[High Forest]]:\n[[Kryptgarden Forest]]: Found next to the Sword Mountains, this woodland was home to the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]].\n-->",
            "Rivers and streams": "The valley was named for the great [[River Dessarin]], that flowed from the [[Evermoors]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], to the [[Sea of Swords]] just south of [[Waterdeep]]. It was fed by a number of tributaries, including the [[River Surbrin]], [[Horn Stream]], and [[Gaustar's Creek]].",
            "Wetlands": "* [[Black Maw Bog]]: These wetlands surrounded the area around and underneath the massive [[Ilikur's Bridge]].{{Cite dragon/307/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Haunted Bridge|56}}"

        "History": "In {{YearlinkName|-4420}}, the [[shield dwarf]] kingdom of [[Besilmer]] was founded. Besilmer was a very atypical [[dwarf]] kingdom, built above ground with fields and pastures to support it. For years, Besilmer flourished but then fell under attack by [[giants]] and [[trolls]]. This led to the construction of [[Tyar-Besil]], an underground city. Besilmer fell a century after its construction. Ruins from the kingdom still stood as late as the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], most notably the [[Stone Bridge]] that spanned the Dessarin River; and, although in poor condition, the ruins known as the [[Halls of the Hunting Axe]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|893}}, the [[Knights of the Silver Horn]] discovered the ruins of Tyar-Besil. The knights set up strongholds in the ruins but came under attack by [[Uruth Ukrypt]]. This led to Dessarin Valley being dragged into the [[Orcfastings War]], and the First and Second [[Trollwars]]. By the {{YearlinkName|942}}, all signs of human civilization had been wiped out.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|949}}, the lower area of the valley was the location of a fallen manor for [[the Schooled]], students taught by [[Magister]] [[Caldauvur Maerglauthyn]] until his death in the same year and at the same manor.\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1000}}, following the expansion of [[Waterdeep]], a few small villages started to develop. This led to the founding of [[Red Larch]], [[Yartar]], and [[Triboar]].",
