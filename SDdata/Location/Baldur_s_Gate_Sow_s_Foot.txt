'''Sow's Foot''' was a district in the [[Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was the eastern-most neighborhood located outside of the city walls, nestled in between [[Twin Songs]] and [[Whitkeep]]. The borders between these locales were not well-defined and often the subject of great debate.

There were few, if any, notable locations in this neighborhood.The [[Murder in Baldur's Gate]] DM's screen shows [[Hamhocks Slaughterhouse]] as being in the middle of the Sow's Foot district, but the more recent [[Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus]] explicitly states it is in [[Stonyeyes]].
