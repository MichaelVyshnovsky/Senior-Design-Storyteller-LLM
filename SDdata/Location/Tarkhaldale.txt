Tarkhaldale (), also known as the Lost Dale and the Lost Vale, was considered one of the dales in the Dalelands, despite being located between Anauroch and the Desertsmouth Mountains. It was sometimes unmarked on maps, but was located west of Shadowdale.

In ancient times, Tarkhaldale flourished as a farming and mining community. When the Anauroch desert spread, the region was abandoned to orc and goblin tribes. In 1360 DR, a group of saurials escaped from their imprisonment by the god Moander and made their home in the dale. Later, the Netherese drove the saurials away and took over the dale.
