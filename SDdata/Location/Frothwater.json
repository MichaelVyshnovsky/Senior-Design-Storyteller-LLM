        "Geography": "The city was built at the confluence of the upper [[Hungry River]], near the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]].",
        "History": "Frothwater was founded in {{yearlinkConvert|2714|NY}} by [[Samual Frothwater]], a [[ranger]] who led a group of homesteaders and ranchers away from the settled lands of Netheril. The settlers wished to escape the decadence and tyranny of [[archwizard]]s who ruled Netheril, and built a fairer society on their own terms. With this as a goal, they managed to build a city that had good governance and fair taxation.\n\nThe city came under the gaze of the [[red dragon]] [[Embercoat]] in {{yearlinkConvert|2714|NY}}. Without the aid of the powerful [[arcanist]]s of Netheril, the Frothwater fended for itself for twenty years as the dragon raided it twice a season. The dragon was tracked down and attacked by [[adventurer]]s in {{yearlinkConvert|2734|NY}}, who managed to greatly wound her at the cost of their own lives. The sole survivor [[Reliaz Justmarch]] prepared for the dragon to return, and slew her the next year when Embercoat attacked in the spring.\n\nThe city survived [[Karsus's Folly]], but the expansion of the [[Anauroch]] caused its eventual abandonment in {{yearlinkConvert|3650|NY}}, and the refugees joined with the three [[Lost Kingdoms]]."
