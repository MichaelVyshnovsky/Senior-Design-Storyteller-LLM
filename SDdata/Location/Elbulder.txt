'''Elbulder''' was established as a logging town for [[Sespech]] on the [[River Arran]], south of the [[Chondalwood]].

==Description==
Elbulder was the southernmost settlement among the three cities of the Kingdom of Sespech.

The city was nestled between two tributaries of the River Arran along the [[Old Road (Vilhon Reach)|Old Road]] with a bridge across each.

The name Elbulder, in reality, referred to two locations. The "old" Elbulder was built around a freshwater stream re-routed into pipes as the town's source of drinking water. Eventually, the pipe drained into the River Arran. The growth of the "old" Elbulder was stunted due to the second spring that eventually flowed into a marshy area just outside of town to its east. The Old Road crossed the River Arran via a wagon-ferry. Eventually, "old" Elbulder was abandoned and ruined, following a reckless magical battle that took place in the ages past. The town became plagued by ''[[wild magic]]'', ''[[living spell]]'', and terrifying monsters.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211229021416/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1476010210594590722| title = TheEdVerse on Twitter| accessdate = 28-12-2021| date = 28-12-2021}}

The “new” Elbulder, the town that was known simply as Elbulder in the 14{{th}} century DR, rose further to the east from the marsh, and the Old Road was re-routed to pass through the “new” Elbulder. The new route of the Old Road used a wagon-ferry which, in time, was replaced by two bridges.

==Government==
The ruler of Elbulder was the Mayor. As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the town's Mayor was a retired adventurer [[Gavilon Jostins]].

==Trade==
Elbulder's lumber was sent up River Arran to the [[Vilhon Reach]] and onwards to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. During the [[Rotting War]], the disapproval of the [[Emerald Enclave]] meant that the logging operation could not continue. Because magic boats were used to transport the logs along the river, magic was extremely well received in Elbulder.

Elbulder remained active after the lumbering industry was abandoned. The town was located along the Old Road, between Chondath to the north and the city of [[Torsch]] to the south. The road brought a constant stream of traders, travelers, and adventurers to support Elbulder's economy.

==Culture==
Over the centuries that followed the seizure of lumbering, the woods became a place for hunting, recreation, and solitude. Inhabitants of Elbulder loved listening to the stories of travelers and adventurers who claimed to have survived the dangers of Chondalwood. However, they never took these tales seriously, dismissing them as tall-tales.

==Defenses==
Despite one being a lumbering city, Elbulder never entered an open conflict with the Emerald Enclave nor the [[satyr]], [[elf]], and [[voadkyn]] denizens of Satyrwood.

==History==
[[File:Black Star Gate.png|thumb|''The [[Black Star Gate]] that opened into the "old" monster-infested ruined [[Elbulder‎‎]].''|390x390px]]
Originally established to a flourishing lumbering city that harvested wood from Chondalwood, by the end of the [[Rotting War]] in the {{YearlinkName|902}}, logging operation was almost completely halted. Both the civil war in [[Chondath]] and the threats from the [[Emerald Enclave]] were instrumental.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Baron Thuragar Foesmasher took control of Sespech and asked his former adventuring comrade – [[wizard]] Gavilon Jostins to take up the mantle of Elbulder's Mayor. Shortly after Gavilon's rule started, the Lord of [[Arrabar]] sent a band of soldiers to Elbulder in an attempt to claim the town. Gavilon exercised diplomacy by sending ''[[fireball]]s'' and ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' and sending the Arrabarrans back to Chondath. However, that assault was a mere reconnaissance, followed by a similar brief naval assault.

By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Lord of Arrabar, [[Eles Wianar]], was planning an invasion of Sespech. The first step was a simultaneous land assault on Elbulder from the Old Road and on the city of [[Mimph]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160816191452/http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=fr/fx20020508rt| title = Rand's Travelogue: More of the Vilhon Reach!| accessdate = 28-12-2021| date = 28-12-2021}}

==Rumors & Legends==
An old magic ''[[gate]]'', known as the ''[[Black Star Gate]]'', connected the ruins of "old" monster-infested Elbulder with a tomb-knoll in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]]. The ''gate'' was activated by a piece of [[obsidian]] or [[jet]]. Knowledge of the ''Black Star Gate'' was kept in an old tome at the library fortress of [[Candlekeep]].
