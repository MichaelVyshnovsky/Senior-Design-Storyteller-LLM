        "mainbody": "Buyan was a fishing village in the hinterland of Laothan in Malatra, lying somewhere on the coast of the Eastern Sea near the Parabin Shoals.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, the Seng fishermen here did good business gathering shellfish such as oysters from the shallows, as well as their pearls. In particular, the oyster beds near the Parabin Shoals were known to produce the highest-quality pearls in Malatra. These pearls were traded through Kwang Tre. Even the prejudiced old Kuong nun Ama conceded that the people of Buyan were \"adequate\" pearl-divers, \"for Seng\"."
