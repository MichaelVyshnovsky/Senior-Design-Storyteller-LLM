        "mainbody": "'''Ripplestones''' was a village on the [[Dragon Coast]] between [[Westgate]] and [[Starmantle]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Ripplestones had a bridge on the Westgate side; it was uneven and rough, with a sign on the Ripplestones side. Past the bridge, the main road of the village turned around [[Scorchstone Hall]], a small manor surrounded by a thicket of trees and thorny bushes. The cottages of [[Caladaster]] and [[Baerdagh]] were close to it. There was a tavern, the [[Fair Maid]].",
        "Geography": "The road towards Starmantle went along the coast for some miles.",
        "History": "[[Elminster Aumar]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], went to Ripplestones in the {{yearlinkName|767}}; there, he shared a meal with two local elderly men, Caladaster and Baerdagh, from whom he learned about Scorchstone Hall, where the sorceress [[Sharindala]] had dwelt. Later, the [[elven]] mage [[Ilbryn Starym]] came from Westgate too, pursuing Elminster; he left as soon as he learned where the man was. Three people arrived later, the scholars [[Tabarast]] and [[Beldrune]], accompanied by a [[Azuth|nameless]] [[Harper]] who was also seeking Elminster; they too left after a single meal, accompanied by Caladaster.\n\nDays later, the High Duke of [[Langalos]], [[Horostos]], sent an immense caravan out to see if [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]] would be daunted or somehow stopped by a force of that size. The caravan stopped at Ripplestones, just in time for Sharindala to come to the Fair Maid.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was said that Sharindala still walked the halls of Scorchstone Hall. This was true, but it was also said she was a moaning spirit, when Sharindala was actually mute because of her undeath.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Jalobal]]\n* [[Alnyskawer]]"
