        "Description": "The Gauntlet was one of the few alleyways in Skullport with a name, and was notorious for its high concentration of cutpurses, pickpockets, and brigands. The alley's name reflected the dangers faced by those who passed through, as well as the peril faced by the criminals who operated there. Violence was a daily occurrence, with numerous assaults and murders not only targeting unsuspecting travelers but also the cutthroats themselves.\n\nIn the Gauntlet, those who preyed on others must constantly be prepared to defend themselves, as success in stealing often turned the predator into prey. After a successful theft, the original thief may find themselves pursued by their own peers, as competition for stolen goods was fierce. This alleyway embodied the lawlessness and treachery that defined much of life in Skullport."
