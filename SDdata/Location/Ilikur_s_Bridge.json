        "mainbody": "'''Ilikur's Bridge''', known in the region as the \"Haunted Bridge\", was a monumental construction that spanned the [[Huntinghorn Water]] and [[Black Maw Bog]] between [[Westbridge]] and [[Triboar]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].{{Cite dragon/307/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Haunted Bridge|56}} It was part of the [[Long Road]] that connected [[Waterdeep]] to [[Mirabar]] in the far north.",
        "Structure": "The bridge was made from three massive [[granite]] blocks and spanned the stream and bog in the north-south direction. The two plinths were 60 ft (18 m) from west to east, 20 ft (6.1 m) from north to south, and rose 30 ft (9.1 m) above the ground extending another 10 ft (3 m) below ground. The deck slab was 100 ft (30.5 m) long, 50 ft (15 m) wide, and 12 ft (3.7 m) thick with a slight arch of about 4.0 ft (1.2 m) in the middle relative to the ends. At both ends of the span were 100 ft ramps that sloped down to meet the Long Road.\n\n[[File:HauntedBridge-raid.jpg|thumb|center|650px|''Aerial view of the bridge showing the plinths and the deck slab. Some unfortunate travelers have been attacked by bugbears. The Huntinghorn Water and Black Maw Bog can been seen in the background. Click to enlarge.'']]\nEach ramp was contained between two fitted stone walls that were anchored to a plinth. The space between the walls was filled with rubble, river rock, and gravel built up to form a roadbed 40 ft (12 m) wide plus another 5.0 ft (1.5 m) of guard wall on either side to prevent people, draft animals, and wagons from falling off the edge. These side rails were also made of tightly fitted smooth granite blocks and topped with a sloped capstone rail. The road itself was cobblestone for the entire length of the bridge and ramps. The choice and positioning of the blocks that formed the superstructure allowed water to pass through and drain away which minimized the problems of ice formation, both for travelers and for the long-term damage of countless freeze/thaw cycles.",

            "Bridge Wisdom": "Over the years, by chance, observation, or experimentation, the conditions required to trigger some of the bridge's ''magic mouths'' were discovered. Others were heard without knowing the precise circumstances that triggered them. Here is a small sample of the cryptic messages and their triggers.\n[[File:HauntedBridge-WV.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Mysterious engravings on one cobblestone.'']]\n* If a [[dwarf]] touched any part of the bridge, it said \"Built in pride, rooted in power, six stones here point the way to anvils made to forge great magic but hidden elsewhere. Dismantle and destroy not, or suffer Baraurin's curse.\"\n* If a flying creature got within 60 ft (18 m) of the bridge, it said \"Strike not the work that pleased Ilikur.\"\n* If that creature landed on or hit the bridge, it said \"The dead watch, and mark what you do.\"\n* If an object or dead body (not [[undead]]) struck any part of the bridge, it said \"To the earth, all returns&mdash;but not unheeded.\"\nThere were other sayings triggered by [[elves]], drawing [[magic weapon]]s, or even lighting a [[torch]] or casting a ''[[light]]'' spell while on the bridge."

        "Rumors & Legends": "Plenty of legends surrounded this ancient edifice, the most common being that it was haunted. Investigations by sages, [[wizard]]s, and [[priest]]s turned up no evidence of a haunting, just the bridge's penchant for pontificating for reasons known only to the builders. The many hiding places in the superstructure gave rise to rumors of amazing treasures to be found and was a constant draw for the curious. These rumors spread even beyond the bridge to include the bog beneath and to the east, where wagons from wealthy merchants or carriages from rich nobles were supposedly sunk and waiting to be looted. Some of these stories were proven true, but the bog swallowed some of the looters as well. One particularly persistent legend told of a chest of stolen [[Currency|coins]] and [[gem]]s buried off the north end of the bridge out (some distance in some direction) from the end of the ramp retaining wall. Another version of this legend stated that it was guarded by undead creatures buried with it.\n[[File:HauntedBridge-statue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The stone visage of the buried statue.'']]\n\nOther tales handed down over generations told of a dragon landing on the bridge and then vanishing. This was probably based in fact due to the discovery of the ''portal'' at the south end. Likewise, a ring of wizards standing on the bridge at night surrounded by an eerie glow was a common tavern tale. But the most chilling legend was the story of some treasure hunters digging in the road at the center of the bridge and discovering a [[stone golem]] laying face-up under the roadbed. According to the legend, it sat up and blasted the defilers with ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' so powerful that they were hurled off the bridge, dead and fried in their own grease before the bog could claim them. The golem then gathered the loose stones and reburied itself to await some unknown future purpose. According to [[Elminster]], the truth behind this legend was that the bridge's superstructure contained quite a few stones that were enchanted to shoot lightning when disturbed, and a statue along with the stones from its pedestal were scavenged from a monument in the vicinity as material to build the road. The treasure seekers did dig up the statue and at least one of them got electrocuted, but it was dwarves that repaired the road and started the story of the golem to discourage other vandals. It was said that anyone who broke a stone or carried one off would surely meet a swift end.",
        "History": "The earliest known written records that mention Ilikur's Bridge dated from the mid–6{{th}} century DR and they described the structure as \"old\" even then. Who or what Ilikur was and what hands built the bridge were lost to time. The builders had skill equal to that of dwarven stonemasons of the era, but no known clan claimed the bridge as part of its ancestral works. The reburying of the statue notwithstanding, the Haunted Bridge has needed no repair work in recorded history.\n\nAs of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], [[bugbears]] patrolled the area around the bridge looking for easy targets and organized raids on any travelers that attempted to spend the night above the bog."
