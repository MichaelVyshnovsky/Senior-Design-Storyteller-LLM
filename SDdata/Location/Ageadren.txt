Ageadren was one of the Six Holy Cities of the ixitxachitl nation in the Sea of Fallen Stars known as the Xedran Reefs.
Like all of the chitl cities, Orilidren consisted of a huge warren of tunnels and subcaverns. This included a central entrance to the surface, with passages riddled in traps, and large cavern beneath that site with a great temple to Ilxendren around which the rest of the city grew outward from.
There stood an outbuilding near the temple for the Devitans personal slaves, at least four caverns on the outskirts of the city in which other slaves were kept, two military garrisons, and at least four public shrines on the city outskirts that were deciated to Ilxendren. 
Around the 3 to 9 day of Lifesong, These forces would go on to destroy the two cities supporting temples at Ilramas, Ilkanar, Ilphaeth, and Ilteon were destroyed.
* Ourax worked in Ageadren a decade prior to his ascension to the status of Fifth Vitanar of the Xedran Reefs.
