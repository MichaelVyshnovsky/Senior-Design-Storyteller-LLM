'''Ageadren''' was one of the Six Holy Cities of the [[ixitxachitl]] nation in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] known as the [[Xedran Reefs]].

==Description==
Like all of the 'chitl cities, Orilidren consisted of a huge warren of tunnels and subcaverns. This included a central entrance to the surface, with passages riddled in traps, and large cavern beneath that site with a great temple to [[Ilxendren]] around which the rest of the city grew outward from.

There stood an outbuilding near the temple for the Devitan's personal [[slavery|slaves]], at least four caverns on the outskirts of the city in which other slaves were kept, two military garrisons, and at least four public shrines on the city outskirts that were deciated to Ilxendren. 

==History==
Around the 3{{rd}} to 9{{th}} day of [[Lifesong]], These forces would go on to destroy the two cities' supporting temples at [[Ilramas]], [[Ilkanar]], [[Ilphaeth]], and [[Ilteon]] were destroyed.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Ourax]] worked in Ageadren a decade prior to his ascension to the status of [[Vitanar|Fifth Vitanar]] of the Xedran Reefs.<ref>
