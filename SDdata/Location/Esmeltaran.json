        "mainbody": "Esmeltaran was a large city in central Amn that served as its capital for much of its history. It was famed for its beautiful architecture, opulent resorts, and warm, pleasant weather.\nEsmeltaran was built on the shore of Lake Esmel, a short distance north of River Esmel. All three were named after King Esmel Torlath I, who also ordered the construction of the city. It was located between the Gem Road and the South Road, just north of the Kings Arch bridge, Gambiton, and Five Silvers.\nBecause of the nearby hot springs, Esmeltaran had a markedly warmer climate than most of Amn, and was the only major city that didnt experience freezes and snowfall in winter.\nBefore its capture in 1370 DR, Esmeltaran was ostensibly governed by Pasha Iitriv Gaall. The citys affairs were truly controlled by the three most powerful business interests in the city—the landlord and investor Zaraana Hyrrshas, the Church of Waukeen through Vara Olehm, and the Janyskyvaar Cabal made up of the Nashivaar and Jhanyssek families.\nDuring the 14 century DR Esmeltaran was 99% human, with the rest made up of halflings in one of their rare urban concentrations. This changed massively over the next century, and halflings became the majority demographic in the city.\nThe citys population fluctuated wildly over time as so much of it was temporary, with a permanent core of about 21,000 local residents and 8,000 rural folk from nearby villages who regularly visited for work and trade. Tourists and other guests could double or even triple the total population, especially in winter. Most wealthy families owned a holiday home in or around Esmeltaran, and those who couldnt afford one instead competed on their lavish temporary stays, ensuring they kept ahead in Amns race for prestige and ostentatious luxury.\nCrime in the city was highly regulated by the Shadow Thieves, who controlled the various local gangs. Thanks to an agreement made with the Council of Six, assassination was completely banned within the underworld, and criminal efforts turned towards nonviolent means. The Shadow Thieves directed efforts towards theft and forgery, and specialized in stealing valuable items such as jewellery and documents, then replacing them with forged copies that their owners might never detect.\nEsmeltaran was dominated by tourism for the wealthy, as it was warm in winter, possessed beautiful architecture, and actively put out advertising that ensured it was the most highly-regarded spot in all of Amn. It was filled with boarding houses, inns, festhalls, theaters, clubs, and villas that catered to these visitors, in conjunction with more estates and resorts outside the city such as the Scimitar (these clubs and halls were also often the best place in the region for finding illicit goods). The lake near the city was warmed by underwater hot springs that attracted people to the expensive health spas and lake bathing that made the most of the warm green water and sulfur-tinged air. Recreational boating and fishing was also quite popular among vacationers, and the far-fetched tales of the elusive \"Esmelda\" served as another draw for adventurous sailors.\nIn addition to idle hedonism, the city served as a neutral meeting ground for the competing merchants of Amn, and many rivals came in order negotiate their high-stakes deals in a safe and opulent manner.\nEsmeltaran also served as the main center for trade around Lake Esmel and about the River Esmel, with much of the regions agricultural produce being transported through the city. Many of the wealthy visitors arrived via opulent pleasure barges that passed up and down the River Esmel, with each one a fully equipped luxury accommodation in their own right.\nCommercial fishing was quite lucrative in the area thanks to Lake Esmels calm, safe waters. The deep lake produced a plentiful variety of fish, including the dunchow, which was a favored delicacy in Esmeltarans dining rooms. Despite these advantages, the fishing industry was strongly limited around the city in order to avoid upsetting the vacationers who wished to enjoy the shore.\nTemples and shrines to almost every god in the Realms could be found in Esmeltaran or the surrounding area. Most of them were built in the 12 century DR because of the demands of King Rhinn the Pious, and then fell out of common use once his reign passed. The most popular churches in the city by the 14 century DR were the temples of Lliira, Sune, Tymora, and Waukeen, as well as the shrine of Iyachtu Xvim. Most of the other temples and shrines remained physically intact, but simply lacked attendance beyond a priest or lay follower who tended to it.\nThe landward side of the city was defended by a large stone wall with three main gates. The largest single fortified structure in the city was Dahaundar, the old royal palace.\nIn the 14 century DR, the city had a permanent militia of 750 soldiers. Though a relatively small garrison for such a large and prominent city, it was supplemented by the large armed escorts that caravans and wealthy guests brought along with them. If necessary, the Council Army could provide reinforcements from its nearby postings at Hillfort Ishla and along the Gem Road. In stark contrast, Captain Amlos Xornnag of Ishla rented out his troops to the highest bidder, allowing them to earn a little money while performing demeaning tasks for their betters.\nEsmeltaran was built at the command of King Esmel Torlath I while he ruled from Athkatla. It was only finished in 512 DR after his death, during the second year of King Imnel Is reign. King Imnel had the royal court immediately moved to Esmeltaran and the palace of Dahaundar, and moved the Armory of Nedeheim there as well to ensure its safety.\nThe city was threatened in the , when the Horned Mage raised an army of ogres and sacked Trademeet and Imnescar. Though Esmeltaran was not besieged thanks to the efforts of General Rashturl, the Armory of Nedeheim was shortly after transferred to Murann for safekeeping.\nWhen Amn was reunited under the Council of Six, the capital was moved to Athkatla. Esmeltaran remained a prestigious and important city, with many of the royal and noble structures repurposed as festhalls, inns, resorts, and private mercantile estates.\nWith the growing prosperity of Keczulla, the Council and Lord Pulth Tanislove sponsored a project to link it and Esmeltaran together. The road construction began in 1359 DR, and continued until completion in 1366 DR, creating the Gem Road.\nIn late 1369 DR and early 1370 DR, exiles and refugees from Tethyr arrived in Amn, including the Krimmevol and Basilayer families. They settled in the major cities of the realm, especially Esmeltaran.\nThe , saw the outbreak of the Sothillisian War while Amn was distracted by the secession of Riatavin and Trailstone. Esmeltaran fell to the invaders on Eleasis 9, with the Skullgnasher hill giants and Spearbiter goblins aided by the traitorous Captain Amlos Xornnag of Ishla. They quickly overwhelmed the militia and took control of the Dahaundar and the docks, and Sothillis and Cyrvisnea set about searching for the lost Armory of Nedeheim beneath the old palace.\nThis state of affairs continued until the , when the blue dragon Iryklathagra suddenly destroyed one of the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse and allowed Selûnite crusaders to completely isolate Esmeltaran and cut off its supplies. By autumn of that year the Council Army had managed to successfully assault and recapture the city, and the war effort was focused entirely on Murann.\nBy the late 15 century DR, halflings had managed to become the dominant folk in the city. Many of them were refugees displaced from other regions, and this new population managed to completely revitalize the city by 1479 DR.\nThe city had distinctive and opulent architecture, with much of it dating back to the royal period of Amn and having a strong Calishite Shoon influence.\n* Dahaundar, the former royal palace of Amn.\nDuring the 14 century DR, Esmeltaran was home to over 1,000 taverns, 750 inns, 400 festhalls, and a dozen luxury resorts.\n* Bashful Esmeldas, a festhall and tavern.\n* Black Alarics, a tavern.\n* The Broken Harp, a tavern.\n* Days of Eleint, a tavern.\n* Delosars Pearls, a tavern.\n* The Eye Tyrant, a tavern.\n* The Genies Bottle, a tavern.\n* The Golden Sands Inn\n* Runhaves Masks, a festhall and tavern.\n* Shazzelims Retreat, an inn.\n* Sunes Silk Slippers, a festhall.\n* Veiled Vampiress, a festhall and tavern.\n* The Blazing Swords, adventuring company.\n* The Company of the Firestar, adventuring company.\n* The Shadow Thieves"
