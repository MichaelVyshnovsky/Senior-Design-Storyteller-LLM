Reitheillaethor or Rheitheillaethor () was a wood elf village located within the High Forest in the North. For some of its history it existed as a winter retreat for the forests elves, a place for them to take up seasonal residence before continuing their nomadic ways in the warmer months of the year. By the late 15 century DR however, it became part of something larger, one of the first communities of the High Forest that strove to revive a long-lost elven empire.
The village comprised numerous naturalistic buildings and shelters that appeared to grow out of the roots and trees of the forest floor. Seven outer structures encircled a central, white marble lodge built within the space formed by four great oak trees. 
Smaller, temporary shelters such as huts, lean-tos, and tents surrounded this prominent arrangement, The weirwoods of Reitheillaethor were magically protected against fire. 
The village boasted a sculpture carved by the famous stone giant artist Aris, depicting humans and elves dancing together in celebration and glee.
It was situated on the bank of the Heartblood River, just beyond the borders of the Dire Wood east of the ruins of Karse.
Throughout its history, Reitheillaethor was ruled over by the Lady of the Forest Morgwais Nightmeadow.
The elves of the village maintained an amiable relationship with the nearby treant community.
Guests of the elves were free to enter or leave the village as they wished, provided they did not endanger its safety in any way.
Reitheillaethor elves had the reputation as being expert hunters, foragers, fishers, and craftspeople. They were known to sculpt strong and highly sought-after clay pots that fetched a good price in local markets.
In order to maintain its strong defenses, patrols were assigned to watch over the eastern reaches of the High Forest and keep watch over the nearby Dire Wood.
As of the Era of Upheaval in the late 14 century DR, Reitheillaethor was considered to be one of the elven peoples youngest settlements within the High Forest.
On Ches 1 in the , Rheitheillaethor was attacked by daemonfey and orcs under their control. The combined forces overwhelmed the villages defenses and drove out its guardspeople.
As of the late 15 century DR, Lady Morgwais had united her village with those of Nordahaeril and Teuveamanthaar with the hopes of uniting all the tribes of the High Forest and restoring the kingdom of Eaerlann.
Reitheillaethors residents continually changed with the seasons, as the nomadic forest elves moved in and out of the village from other areas of the High Forest.
