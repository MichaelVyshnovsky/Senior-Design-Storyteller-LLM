        "Geography": "The city of Ammarindar was located primarily in the [[Northdark]] between the [[drow]] cities of [[Menzoberranzan]] and [[Ched Nasad]]. It was located in the region of the ancient [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|dwarven kingdom]] of the same name that also included territory covering the upper [[Delimbiyr Vale]], between the [[High Forest]] and the [[Fallen Lands]].\n\nAmmarindar was located some 250 miles southeast of Menzoberranzan and was linked to the city by dwarven tunnels carved over the Darklake. \n\nThe path through Ammarindar was considered the quickest journey between Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad, but around the year [[1372 DR]], was less traveled because of the danger that lurked there.",
        "Structure": "Originally carved by [[dwarf|dwarves]], the city's tunnels bore many features of dwarven architecture. The city had large boulevards and large chambers, whose walls were inscribed with [[dethek]] [[rune]]s.\n\nAmmarindar had a foundry of black iron and runes. It was located in a huge cavern with pillars carved into the shapes of dragons.",
        "History": "The dwarven nation of Ammarindar was founded before both [[Cormanthyr]] and [[Netheril]] in {{Yearlink|-4100}}. The kingdom, along with [[elven]] [[Eaerlann]], fell to hordes of [[orc]]s and [[demon]]s from [[Hellgate Keep]] in [[882 DR]].\n\nAfter the city's fall, its tunnels in the Underdark were inhabited by [[drow]] from [[Ched Nasad]] and [[beholder]]s from the [[Graypeak Mountains]]. Around [[1220 DR]], the demons of Hellgate Keep drove off the other inhabitants and claimed it for their own.\n\nAfter the fall of Hellgate Keep in [[1369 DR]], a section of Ammarindar was inhabited by the [[cambion]] [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and his [[Scourged Legion]], an army of [[tanarukk]]s.\n\nIn the decade after Vhok's disappearance, the connection between Hellgate Keep and Ammarindar was severed. The Scourged Legion was taken over by a tanarukk known as Warchief [[Ghaarzhvex]]."
