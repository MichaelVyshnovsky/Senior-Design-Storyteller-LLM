The result was a neighborhood of rundown apartments and cheap taverns catering to these aspiring mages.\nA motley mix of would-be mages from all social classes rubbed elbows in the tenements and taverns of Apprentice Row. These young spellcasters worked tirelessly to hone their craft and attract the attention of a powerful master to take them on as apprentice."
