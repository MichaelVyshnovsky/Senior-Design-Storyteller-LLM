'''Prastuil''' was the oldest city in [[Dambrath]].

==Geography==
The city was situated at the mouth of the [[Dolphin's Climb]], where it emptied into the [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]]. The city was protected from the harsh winter storms that ravaged southern Dambrath, making it an ideal place for ships to anchor for the season.

==Description==
Prastuil was said to be the most beautiful city in all of Dambrath. Splendidly rich villas could be found outside of the city proper.

==Armed Forces==
A force of 1,000 elite cavalry protected the city. They were aided by numerous [[wizard]]s and naval support from harboring ships.

==Inhabitants==
Prastuil's population of 30,000–50,000 was truly mixed, including [[crinti]], [[gnoll]]s, [[halflings]], [[arkaiun]]s, [[drow]], [[dwarves]], and even a few [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]]

Warchief [[Herald Markin]], a loyal servant of Duchess [[Merial Luenath]], ruled Prastuil.
