        "mainbody": "orch was a large gate-town leading to Gehenna from the Outlands. \nThe gate-town was divided into two parts. The lowest part was the most dangerous part of Torch. The impoverished and desperate inhabitants lived here. Occasionally, the marsh flooded this section of the gate-town, bring waves of disease and a species of killer frogs, poisonous snakes and giant leeches. The wealthiest and most powerful inhabitants of Torch made their homes in the upper slopes, divided into three sections called Karal, Maygel and Dohin. Connected by towering bridges, the upper part of Torch was walled of from the lower town. A popular past-time of the residents of the upper sections was standing on the bridges and watching the struggles of the residents of the lower town.\nFloating about  in the air, the Gate to Gehenna appeared as a large dark red gemstone. Flying into the gate was the safest course of action, but some brave, or foolhardy, individuals attempted to pass through the gate by dropping down from one of the volcanic spires. Local legend stated that there was a hidden second gate to Gehenna found in the marsh surrounding Torch.\nthumb|300px|A map showing the Torchs location in relation to other gate-towns and the River Maat.\nTorch was built on the slopes of several towering volcanic spires, formed by cooled magma. Some of the spires were still active, occasionally producing inflammable gases and lava flows. The constant light from the ever-present lava was how the gate-town came to be called Torch. The town and the spires were surrounded by a large march filled with water the color of blood.\nThere was a roughly a distance of three to eighteen journeying days between Torch and the River Maat.\nThe closest thing Torch had to a local government was the Council of All. It was, in theory, a council of the inhabitants of the town. Meeting were held in the ruins of an abandoned arena. In reality, the meetings often devolved into large fights, with the council being run by the most wealthy, and powerful, inhabitants.\nIn the , a planeswalking merchantile caravan in Ravens Bluff, a city on the Prime Material world of Toril, was being sponsored by local Ravenian noble Lauren DeVillars and doing business with the gate-town of Glorium, though they had aims to soon start trade missions with both the gate-towns of Torch and Tradegate.\nDue to the ever-present light, Torch never slept. The inhabitants of this gate-town were some of the most dangerous individuals in the Outlands. They were known for their greed and vicious, violent temperament. They held the belief that everything in the Outlands, and beyond, was theirs by right and did not hesitate to do whatever was necessary to possess it. Thankfully, they spent so much time robbing each other that raids on other gate-towns were rare. \nThe gate-town was home to several thieves guilds. The largest six were \n* Gray Orb\n* Kindred of Yoj\n* Severed Hand\n* Brotherhood Janko\n* Tiamats Chosen\n* Fire Lords\nThe thieves guilds were in constant conflict, each desiring to corner the black market. Full-on brawls in the streets were not uncommon. The closest they had to a neutral meeting ground was the Festhall of the Falling Coins, which was run by a Torilian wizard named Badurth."
