        "mainbody": "Jazirat al-Sayyad, or the Hunter, was an elongated island located in the Nada al-Hazan achipelago within the Crowded Sea.\nJazirat al-Sayyad had extremely rocky shores, marking it as dangerous sailing territory for mariners. Stormy swells and whirling waters threatened to shatter any approaching ship against the rocks.\nThis island was the home of the magnificent Sayyad bloodline of horses, making it a tempting destination for brave or greedy sailors. The herds were carefully watched over by herdsman genies who were bound long ago by a powerful shair.\nBuying a horse from the genies often required an extraordinary payment and only buyers possessing admirable qualities were considered."
