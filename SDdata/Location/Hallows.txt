The '''Hallows''' were a stretch of forest that the elves of [[Cormanthyr]] used for revels.

==Description==
Several [[shadowtop]] trees sprung up in the garden, with canopies so thick they blocked out the sun; the only sunbeams visible were from rare clearings. The ground was a "lawn of mosses" in which small [[mushroom]]s were planted. The light came from air-globes that glowed faintly in ruby red, gold, green, or blue as they drifted to and fro. Trays floated under some of the globes.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|193-194|10}}

==History==
In the {{yearlink|241}}, a revel took place in the Hallows in which the recently titled [[human]] [[armathor]] [[Elminster Aumar]] substituted for [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], leading to the explosion in the [[Narnpool]] and his hunt later that evening.
