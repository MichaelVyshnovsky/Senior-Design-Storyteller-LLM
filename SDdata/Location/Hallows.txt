The Hallows were a stretch of forest that the elves of Cormanthyr used for revels.
Several shadowtop trees sprung up in the garden, with canopies so thick they blocked out the sun the only sunbeams visible were from rare clearings. The ground was a "lawn of mosses" in which small mushrooms were planted. The light came from air-globes that glowed faintly in ruby red, gold, green, or blue as they drifted to and fro. Trays floated under some of the globes.
In the , a revel took place in the Hallows in which the recently titled human armathor Elminster Aumar substituted for Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl, leading to the explosion in the Narnpool and his hunt later that evening.
