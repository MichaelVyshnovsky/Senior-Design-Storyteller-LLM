        "mainbody": "'''Scardale Town''' was the capital city of the region of [[Scardale]], although it had lost this distinction for a period of time, and was often served as largest city in all of the [[Dalelands]]. The port city was once the most busy and important in the region, and its population endured war, occupation by armed forces, and a devastating plague.\n\nAfter nearly a century of turmoil, enduring a number of different governments Scardale Town reclaimed its status as the seat of power for Scardale after the [[Sembia]]n takeover in 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. By [[1479 DR]] it had been re-established as the capital of Scardale, albeit as a subjugated realm of [[Sembia]] and, by extension, the [[Netheril|Netherese]] rule of the [[Shadovar]].",
        "History": "After the defeat and disappearance of [[Lashan Aumersair]], following the [[second inter-dale war]] in [[1356 DR]], many Scardalesmen left the city for outlying villages and farms. The government of Scardale, whose seat of power was in Scardale Town at the time, was taken over by an occupying coalition of forces from [[Hillsfar]]. Sembia, [[Zhentil Keep]], and the other dales led a 13-person council.\n\nThe years of the occupation were very detrimental to Scardale Town. Trade was closed for a decade, only being reopened around [[1367 DR]]. Despite the large number of soldiers stationed in the city, banditry was rampant, Some shops and traders remained in the town, most notably dealing in [[prostitution]] and illicit goods,The ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'' saw widespread decreases in populations of settlements and regions over previous editions. This is often unexplained, but in this case may be attributed to Scardale Town's disasters and decline.\n\nFollowing the trauma of war and military occupation, Scardale Town would see the most destructive event in its history in [[1370 DR]] with the outbreak of the [[Shaking Plague]]. Between the deaths caused by the disease and the Scardalefolk leaving the city, the population of the city was again cut in half. The already-crumbling coalition forces were nearly completely wiped out, with the [[Sembia]]n garrison being hit especially hard, with only three individuals surviving. Regardless, the city continued on in anarchy and lawlessness, rampant with gangs, religious cults, and agents of evil organizations. The reformed government, led by Provisional Governor [[Khelvos Dermmen]] in [[Chandlerscross]], wavered between calling the city a loss and formulating a plan to reclaim it for the dale as a whole.\n\nWhen Chandlerscross was sacked by Sembian mercenaries in the {{YearlinkName|1421}}, the capital of Scardale was moved back to Scardale Town.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Forever|52}}",
