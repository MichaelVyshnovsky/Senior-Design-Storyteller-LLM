The forest was bordered by the Strait of Oman and Sea of Moonshae to the north, and by the Strait of Alaron to the east. Much of the Winterglens southern border was framed by the Black Mountains and Cambro Mountains. The Firloch was located near the center of the forest.
A pair of Moonwells were found in the Winterlgen.
