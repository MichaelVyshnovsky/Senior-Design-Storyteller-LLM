'''Meiritin''' was a short-lived [[Halfling|hin]] province in the [[Ralamnish Ridings]] of [[West Faerûn]]

==Geography==
Meiritin was located in an area that later became eastern Amn, among the northern [[Tejarn Hills]] east of [[Lake Esmel]]. Meiritin's eastern border was the kingdom of [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]].

==Government==
Meiritin was an autonomous province in the Calishar Emirates led by a [[wikipedia:Margrave|margrave]].

==History==
The margravate was founded in the [[227 DR|Year of the Raised Banner, 227 DR]]{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|33}} by hin emigrants from the [[Purple Hills]] region of [[Tethyr]] who had been forcibly expelled.

This occurred during the reign of Emperor [[Shoon IV]], who encouraged the formation of the Calishar Emirates, which included Meiritin, because he foresaw that he would be able to exploit such small realms with little effort.

Only four years after its founding, the largest settlement of Meiritin was conquered by the Mad Mage [[Ihundyl]], who then declared himself the ruler of the whole Emirates. Because of other unrest further south, the [[Shoon Empire]] was unable to immediately respond.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|34}}

In [[284 DR]], a population of halflings numbering in the thousands migrated from Meiritin and Tethyr to [[Myth Drannor]].

For much of Meiritin's existence, it was threatened by [[beholder]]s. A famous magical sword known as the ''[[Eyestalker]]'' was crafted for one of Meiritin's lords, and for centuries, a succession of champions of [[Arvoreen]] wielded it against the powerful foes before the weapon was eventually lost. It became a part of the collection of the [[sapphire dragon]] [[Bleucorundum]]{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|66-67}}

In [[491 DR]], a powerful [[Calishite]] nobleman, [[Kadar el Aktorral]], By [[523 DR]], Meiritin effectively ceased to exist.

At this time, some of the refugees from Meiritin joined with [[dwarves]] from [[Dardath]], [[gnome]]s from [[Dolblunde]], and [[elves]] from [[Ardeep Forest]] to form the [[Realm of the Three Crowns]] against the threat of [[orc]] hordes in [[the North]].

In the late 14{{th}} century DR, halfling [[lorefinder]]s often traveled to the ruins of Meiritin to explore their historic home.

Around the same time period, taking advantage of the turmoil caused by the defection of [[Riatavin]] and [[Trailstone]] and the rise of the [[Sythillisian Empire]], the [[Knights of the Shield]] were secretly involved in an attempt to reestablish Meiritin as a puppet margravate under the control of the Knights.

==Notable Locations==
; [[Hyrzashyr]] : This river received its name during the time of this kingdom.
; [[Shimmalshyr]] : This was another halfling-named river flowing through Meiritin.
