        "mainbody": "Gladehap was a small village found along the Way of the Manticore just west of Wheloon in Cormyr.\nGladehap was nestled within a dell known as the Lost Lake because it was in fact the location of a lake during times past.\nNearly a thousand Cormyreans lived within the small community of Gladehap. This village was filled with skilled craftsmen who did not want to bother with the hustle and bustle of the larger cities of the land, making Gladehap a popular spot for wealthy nobles to enjoy brief shopping sprees in the mid-1300s DR. Thus it was a resort town, offering fine accommodations, meals, and drinks. The Merchants Guild sometimes held its Grand Councils here."
