        "Inhabitants": "Nearly a thousand Cormyreans lived within the small community of Gladehap. This village was filled with skilled craftsmen who did not want to bother with the hustle and bustle of the larger cities of the land, making Gladehap a popular spot for wealthy nobles to enjoy brief shopping sprees in the mid-1300s [[DR]]. Thus it was a resort town, offering fine accommodations, meals, and drinks. The [[Merchants' Guild]] sometimes held its Grand Councils here.<ref>"
