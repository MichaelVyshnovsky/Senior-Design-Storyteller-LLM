Its leader was the wizard [[Withegroo Seian'Doo]], who had his own tower, a thirty {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} high stone cylindrical building, from which hung a pennant depicting a pair of hands surrounded by golden stars, on a red background. Its population was around one hundred, of which all the adults were capable of fighting with weapons. The houses were mainly of stone construction with supporting wood.",
