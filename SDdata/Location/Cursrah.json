        "Description": "The city was built in concentric rings, with an outer wall. Within were a famous library and college.\n\nThe city contained its own lake, with a sealed lakehouse said to contain an enslaved [[marid]], who pumped the water from the lake to wherever it was needed in the city.\n\nThe greatest architectural feature of Cursrah was perhaps the massive below-ground aqueduct that stretched through the countryside from the city to the [[River Agis]].",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora and Fauna": "Cursrah was surrounded by a ring of fertile farmland just under ten miles thick that provided [[asparagus]], [[barley]], beans, cabbages, caraway seeds, celery, chick peas, lentils, rye, squash, [[strawberry|strawberries]], and winter melons for the populace. Outside the valley, hilly grasslands surrounded Cursrah, which were populated by such animals as [[antelope]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[zebra]]s. Among these hills, acacia, myrtle, and [[cedar]] trees were scattered. After the [[First Era of Skyfire]], these grasslands began being replaced by yellow sand and barren rock.",
            "Weather": "During the summer, the temperature in Cursrah's valley was almost unbearably hot; in the winter, near-constant drizzle made times dreary."

        "Society": {
            "Government": "Cursrah was ruled by a [[bakkal]], a priest-king, If a bakkal had multiple wives, the first and most important was known as the [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|''sama'']]. It was believed that Calim himself had appointed the royal family to rule, and they were said to have the blood of [[genie]]s.",
            "Clothing": "Among women, simple, tubelike shifts were worn by commoners, by servants, or as nightlothes. Those of the upper class often decorated their eyes with [[wikipedia:Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]].",
            "Religion": "The people of Cursrah worshiped Calim, [[Selûne|the moon]], and their dead ancestors. The dead were buried in well-kept necropoleis. The members of the royal family were always [[mummy|mummified]] and kept deep below the Palace for if ever Great Calim should call upon them for aid.\n\nThe [[cleric]]s and [[priest]]s of Cursrah served as [[Alzhedo dictionary#V|vizars]] and as the city-state's healers, but they were also considered \"keepers of life and death.\" The vizars dressed in dull, brown robes and shaved their heads. Junior-level vizars were known as anatomists. Higher-ranking priests often had brands of [[arcane]] symbols on their skulls or tattoos. It was rumored that the highest-level vizars had their sexual organs removed to become androgynous.",
            "Family": "Among the commoners, people chose their own spouses, but those of royal birth had a duty to marry for the benefit of the city of Cursrah, and such marriages were carefully arranged.\n\nRoyal children were not nursed or raised by their own mothers. In fact, it was not uncommon for a child to have no physical contact with his or her mother after birth.",

        },
        "History": "The great [[noble djinni]] Calim founded Cursrah after the [[Great Arrival]], choosing a formerly barren valley as its location. Slaves from many races, including minor [[genie]]s  and humans, worked to built the city to Calim's design.\n\nThe city existed for roughly 1,500 years.",
