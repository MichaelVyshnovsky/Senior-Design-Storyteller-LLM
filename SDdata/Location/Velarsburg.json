        "mainbody": "'''Velarsburg''' was a small, rustic town located on the western border of the [[Velarswood]], that served as the marketplace for the farmers of northern [[Harrowdale]].",
        "Description": "As the [[Harrow Ride]] extended north from [[New Velar]] it ended in a loop which was located in the heart of Velarsburg. Encircled within this circle road was the massive, muddy market ground full of wells and hitching posts for horses. The outskirts were dotted with small cottages, logging mills, warehouses and several orchards and beds of wildflowers. Due to the risk of wildfires from the mills, only flowers and vines could be planted near the outer regions of town. As such, [[melon]] patches were very abundant in Velarsburg.\n\nThe woodcutters organized nurturing and planting of new \"Green\" as they cut down older trees. These action were supported and aided by the [[elves]] of the local woods. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], logging in the cretan fore-edge areas of [[Cormanthor]] and Velarwood was banned in order to preserve the natural resources.",
        "Culture": "The dalesfolk of Velarsburg were proud to live in such close proximity to the wild monsters and mysterious [[fey]] of the nearby forest. They felt a deep connection with the land, and saw themselves as part of a cycle that would outlive the temporary comings and goings of nearby [[human]] interests such as the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Sembia]]n merchant-lords.\n\nFaiths of [[nature domain|nature]] deities, such as [[Chauntea]] and [[Malar]] were in high veneration within Velarsburg.",
        "Defenses": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Velarsburg received a Watch of ten people, established by the [[Council of Seven Burghers]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211121201059/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_050607-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed May â€“ Jul 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}",
        "History": "The town of Velarsburg began as an accumulation of farms and loggers huts that sprung up around the [[Velar mill]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, lumberman [[Rollim]] and his son [[Baeford]] from Velarsburg were logging not far from the [[Howling Hills]] when they heard a female voice calling for help. They dashed towards the woman only to discover a drying [[drow]] [[priestess]] of [[Eilistraee]]. Before she perished, the cleric told the woodsmen that she was felled in the Realms Below. Later, [[Halisstra Melarn]] interviewed Rollim and his child about the Dark Lady's fate.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Inns and Taverns": "*[[Pushy Pixie]]: This rough-and-tumble bar featured low-brow entertainment for the local farmers and woodsmen.\n*[[Old Stump]]: An expensive inn rich in the atmosphere of the comforts and warmth of home.",
            "Lumber Yards": "*[[Torsyld Logging]]: A large and prosperous lumber yard that exclusively dealt with [[Shadowtop]] wood.\n*[[Black Stars Logging]]: This mill was collectively owned by all the other loggers and companies, excluding the [[Torsyld]] family, within Velarsburg."
