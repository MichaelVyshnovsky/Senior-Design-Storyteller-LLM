        "mainbody": "elarsburg was a small, rustic town located on the western border of the Velarswood, that served as the marketplace for the farmers of northern Harrowdale.\nAs the Harrow Ride extended north from New Velar it ended in a loop which was located in the heart of Velarsburg. Encircled within this circle road was the massive, muddy market ground full of wells and hitching posts for horses. The outskirts were dotted with small cottages, logging mills, warehouses and several orchards and beds of wildflowers. Due to the risk of wildfires from the mills, only flowers and vines could be planted near the outer regions of town. As such, melon patches were very abundant in Velarsburg.\nThe woodcutters organized nurturing and planting of new \"Green\" as they cut down older trees. These action were supported and aided by the elves of the local woods. By the late 14 century DR, logging in the cretan fore-edge areas of Cormanthor and Velarwood was banned in order to preserve the natural resources.\nThe dalesfolk of Velarsburg were proud to live in such close proximity to the wild monsters and mysterious fey of the nearby forest. They felt a deep connection with the land, and saw themselves as part of a cycle that would outlive the temporary comings and goings of nearby human interests such as the Zhentarim and Sembian merchant-lords.\nFaiths of nature deities, such as Chauntea and Malar were in high veneration within Velarsburg.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Velarsburg received a Watch of ten people, established by the Council of Seven Burghers.\nThe town of Velarsburg began as an accumulation of farms and loggers huts that sprung up around the Velar mill.\nIn the , lumberman Rollim and his son Baeford from Velarsburg were logging not far from the Howling Hills when they heard a female voice calling for help. They dashed towards the woman only to discover a drying drow priestess of Eilistraee. Before she perished, the cleric told the woodsmen that she was felled in the Realms Below. Later, Halisstra Melarn interviewed Rollim and his child about the Dark Ladys fate.\n*Temple of the Harvest Moon This massive stone keep, also known as the Moon Tower, was dedicated to the worship of Chauntea.\n*Trader Fine Furs This old, family business of furriers specifically hired adventurers to slay specific monsters for their hides and skins.\n*Pushy Pixie This rough-and-tumble bar featured low-brow entertainment for the local farmers and woodsmen.\n*Old Stump An expensive inn rich in the atmosphere of the comforts and warmth of home.\n*Torsyld Logging A large and prosperous lumber yard that exclusively dealt with Shadowtop wood.\n*Black Stars Logging This mill was collectively owned by all the other loggers and companies, excluding the Torsyld family, within Velarsburg."
