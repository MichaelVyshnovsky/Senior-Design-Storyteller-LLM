Tyathalael was a lush valley located on the elven homeland of Evermeet. The name of the valley translated roughly into common as "the peace attained through the absolute beauty of nature and harmony with ones surroundings."
The valley was located in between the Silver Hills and Eagle Hills along the center of Evermeet. The River Ardulith flowed through the valley for its entire length.
Tyathalael was filled with vineyards, farmsteads, meadows, and groves.
