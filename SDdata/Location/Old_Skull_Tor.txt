The Old Skull Tor  was a large, bare hill shaped like a massive dome just north of the village of Shadowdale.
The tor was a spur of gnarled volcanic granite, so tall that if one stood atop it they could look out over all of Shadowdale.
Beneath the tor were entrances to the Underdark.
Lichen and thick tufts of grass grew out of the many cracks and fissures.
As far as historians had been able to ascertain, this hill never had any religious and/or political importance.
* The tomb of Joadath was located atop the tor, in a hollow at its southwest end.
* On the north side of the hill was a hut that sheep farmers built to give them shelter from the rain and for lambing during the winter.
While no one lived on the tor itself, folk could often be found in the area. Shadowfolk use the tor for activities such as laundry drying and a trysting ground. The tor was also used as a lookout spot and sheep pasture.
The nearby Old Skull Inn derived its name from this hill.
