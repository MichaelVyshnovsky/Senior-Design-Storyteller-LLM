The [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of '''Hafayah''', located along [[Al-Kufr River]], was characterized by the dark colors of its buildings and the dress of its citizens, who were somber, secretive and suspicious toward strangers. Politically the '''City of Secrets''' suffered from the underhanded dealings following the poisoning of the former sultan and most of his family in [[1364 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Land of Fate/Adventurer's Guide to Zakhara|71-72}}
