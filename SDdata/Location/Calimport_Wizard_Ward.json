        "Description": "This ward was full of minarets, most of them [[wizard]]'s towers. Many magical and colorful protective wards and [[Permanent image|permanent illusions]] surrounded nearly 400 villas in Wizard Ward, making this part of the city a strange one to see for many visitors. These magical wards were established by private wizards, each with its own special protections and conditions.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />\n\nThis ward of the city contained more than 1,000 buildings, and at least a third of those buildings were the homes of sages or wizards. Because the typical wizard was introverted and studious, this was one of the least busy wards in Calimport to pass through. The more extroverted [[enchanter]]s and [[illusionist]]s did like to show off their arcane talents, but they were in the minority.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />\n[[File:Wizard Ward location.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''A map of the city of [[Calimport]], with Wizard Ward highlighted in red.'']]\nWizard Ward was bordered by [[Calimport/Quill Ward|Quill Ward]] in the north and by [[Calimport/Maker's Ward|Maker's Ward]] in the east. To the south, most of its border was with [[Calimport/Hook Ward|Hook Ward]], but it also bordered Affar and Bitait Drudachs of Ylar Sabban in [[Calimport/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]].<ref name=Calimport-p29>",
        "Government": "The ruler of the ward was Sultan [[Eli el Beza|Eli yn Adran el Beza]], who was also the [[Caleph Arcane]] of Calimport. He was notable for dressing in the manner of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], complete with bald head and tattoos.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 /> He was also the brother of [[Nur el Beza]] of [[Almraiven]].\n\nSultan Eli required membership in the [[Guild Arcane]] for anyone wishing to live in this ward.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />",
        "Defenses": "The ''[[amlakkar]]'' of Wizard Ward included wizards in their membership, at least two for every ten ''amlakkar'' were found among the officers. They utilized [[Rod of absorption|''rods of absorption'']] and other defensive magical tools to neutralize criminal activity that was magical in nature. Indeed, the presence of such mages in the watch of this ward meant that chaos of the arcane variety was rare in this district than in most others in the city.<ref name=Calimport-pp57-59 />",
