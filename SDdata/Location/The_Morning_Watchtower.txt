'''The Morning Watchtower''' was a watchtower and temple to [[Lathander]] in [[Deadsnows]], led by Morninglord [[Ashnar the Humble]]. A banner flew from its topmost turret depicting the golden sunrise of Lathander the Morninglord.<ref>

==Inhabitants==
Ashnar and five other [[cleric]]s operated the place, while a pair of guards made sure they were protected from harm. Ashnar fostered good relations with [[Kerrilla]] of the [[The Hospice of Marthammor|Hospice]] and the pair were the two most respected people in the village and usually the first people turn to when help was needed. Ashnar was also a bit of a crusader and was not above prodding known adventurers into action.<ref>
