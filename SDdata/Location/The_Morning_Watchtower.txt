The Morning Watchtower was a watchtower and temple to Lathander in Deadsnows, led by Morninglord Ashnar the Humble. A banner flew from its topmost turret depicting the golden sunrise of Lathander the Morninglord.
Ashnar and five other clerics operated the place, while a pair of guards made sure they were protected from harm. Ashnar fostered good relations with Kerrilla of the Hospice and the pair were the two most respected people in the village and usually the first people turn to when help was needed. Ashnar was also a bit of a crusader and was not above prodding known adventurers into action.
