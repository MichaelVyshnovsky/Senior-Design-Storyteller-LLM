Toaketh was a small hamlet on the shores of the scenic Firedrake Bay, along the Firedrake Road, in Tethyr, best known for its Toaketh knives.
The small village was one of many hamlets that were sprinkled along the minor trade route of the Firedrake Road, that bent along the Firedrake Shores, through the Dragons Neck Peninsula, and reached the Dragons Head Peninsula. Toaketh was among more notable hamlets, situated on the crossing of the Firedrake Shores and the road that ran north towards the town of Murann, not far from Khalids Wall.
The village was named after the wizard named Ildabar Toaketh, a recluse who was long dead by the late 14 century DR, with his humble often-plundered tomb being part of the village. Toakeths main claim to fame were its Toaketh knives, special never-dulling small blades created by Ildabar Toaketh. The secret of their creation was kept secret by the craftsmen of the village, and the knives were considered Mystras blessing to all chefs and cooks of the Sword Coast and wider Faer√ªn.
