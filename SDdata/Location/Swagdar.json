        "mainbody": "he Swagdar, or the Outlaw Waste, was a large stretch of land located just northwest of Dambrath.\nThis rolling grassland was filled with hidden valleys. The Swagdar covered a 150 square mile (390 km2) area.\nThis land comprised the only remaining free place for the Arkaiun. Small bands gathered together here to raid the countryside of Dambrath and the hated crinti. Sometimes they even ventured to nearby Halruaa. Arkaiun raiders were slain if caught, so battles with these people were fierce. If the bandits were able to capture children, they would raise them within their culture.\nAs of 1367 DR, there were several thousand bandits living within the Swagdar, but a single strong leader was yet to arise to unite them."
