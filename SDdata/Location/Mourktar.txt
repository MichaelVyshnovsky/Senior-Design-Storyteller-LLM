'''Mourktar''' was an independent city-state, that later became the capital of [[Threskel]], one of the [[Old Empires]] of [[east Faerûn]]. It was previously considered by many to be a part of the confederation of [[Chessenta]], though that belief was not shared by its native residents.

==Government==
Mourktar was ruled by its own king, a member of the dynasty that dated back to the 9{{th}} century [[DR]] when the city freed itself from the grip of imperialistic [[Unther]].

Despite the fact some outlanders believed Mourktar to be a vassal-state to the confederation of [[Chessenta]], its strategic location away from other city-states effectively granted the kingdom its own independence. In fact, Mourktar exerted control over the city of [[Thamor]], whose founders originated from the coastal city.

===Law & Order===
As of the mid–14{{th}} century, the people of Mourktar still abided by the Chessentan [[Code of Enlil]].

===Relations===
Mourktar maintained an adversarial relationship with the sahuagin kingdom of [[Aleaxtis]]. They considered [[Mordulkin]] to be their rivals, especially when it came to trade and commerce. 

==Society==
The people of Mourktar had much in common with the residents of [[Messemprar]], the [[Untheric]] city to the south.

===Religion===
Worship of [[Assuran]], the Lord of the Three Thunders was very strong in Mourktar.

Mourktar was also home to a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell that dated back to the 11{{th}} century DR, whose members served the [[blue dragon|blue]] [[dracolich]] [[Alasklerbanbastos]], also known as the Great Bone Wyrm. While many of these cultists operated out of the Black Lord's Cloak temple of Bane, their true alignment lay with the [[church of Tiamat]] in Unther.

==Trade==
The city housed a grand port that greatly benefited the many farmers, herders, and miners of the region. Mourktar's close proximity to [[Bezantur]] in [[Thay]] and [[Sultim]] in [[Murghôm]] granted it an edge over [[Mordulkin]] in the west.

==Defenses==
As of the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Mourktar maintained an army of 500 soldiers, and mobilized four times as many conscripts from the city's populace.

==History==
Mourktar broke free from the rule of Unther in the {{yearlinkName|823}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, the [[red dragon]] [[Tchazzar]] ascended divinity after the [[Rage of Dragons]] devastated the Realms. In a frantic effort to garner more power for himself, Alasklerbanbastos sought out [[lichdom]] by means of the Dragon Cult in Mourktar.

During the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, King [[Theris]] announced to his subjects that he would soon be dying. As he had no heir to whom he could bequeath his kingdom, Theris called for a [[King's Tournament|grand tournament]] of athletic prowess at the [[Fields of Pryollus]] at the base of [[Mount Thulbane]], While the soldier of Akanax [[Helyos]] came close to victory, no clear victor arose as the winner.

In truth the tournament was sabotaged by [[Kabbarath Telthaug]], that Imperceptor of Bane that installed himself as the Regent of Mourktar until the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, when rule of the city was forcible shared with three younger [[blue dragon]]s, by decree of Alasklerbanbastos, ruler of Threskel. Regent Kabbarath ignored the will of the dragon-king until Mourktar was devastated by the [[vampiric dragon]] [[Jaxanaedegor]] ands several "lesser" [[dracolich]]es. The leaders of Mourktar responded with continued offerings and oblations as acts of acquiescence.

During the [[Untheric Crusade]] of the 1370s [[DR]], templars of Bane from [[Black Lord's Cloak|his temple]] in Mourktar came to the defense of Unther, the nation form which the city had previously declared its freedom. The Black Lord's soldiers marched into [[Messemprar]] and aided in the city's defense against the onslaught of [[Mulhorand]].

Around that same time, sea trade from Mourktar was interrupted by domestic troubles in nearby Unther, pirate activity and even the monstrous [[sahuagin]] from the underground city of [[Vahaxtyl]].

==Notable Locations==
;Temples
* [[Amphitheater of First Thunder]], a grand arena dedicated to Assuran.
* [[Black Lord's Cloak]], the largest temple of Bane in all of [[Faerûn]].

==Inhabitants==
Mourktar was home to a great many mercenaries and merchants, all of whom regularly benefited when conflicts arose in the surrounding lands.
