        "mainbody": "'''Innarlith''' was a city-state located on the eastern tip of the [[Lake of Steam]] in [[south Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "[[File:Lake of Steam 3e.jpg|thumb|''The location of Innarlith on the Lake of Steam.'']]\nThe city was divided into four quarters. The docks were in the first quarter.<ref> The homes of the aristocracy as well as the government buildings were located in the second quarter.<ref> The third quarter contained the craftsmen.<ref> The fourth quarter held many of the poor of the city.<ref>\n\nThe territory of the city-state itself didn't have clear boundaries, but it included land that went as far south as the [[Firesteap Mountains]] and as far north as the [[Nagaflow]].<ref><ref>",
        "Trade": "It was a city where anything could be purchased, though how legal the acquisition might be was another story.",
        "Government": "Innarlith was a city-state that had political control over the surrounding areas，including as far north as the southern edge of the Nagaflow river. The head of the government was called the Ransar. It was ruled by a senate composed of the aristocracy, who held their positions for life. Entry into the senate was attained by paying large sums of money to buy empty seats.<ref> Prior to that, Innarlith was a monarchy, at one point in history, ruled by King [[Padangan]].\n\nPeace in Innarlith was maintained by the High Constables, who were adorned in heavy shining armor and armed with [[mace]]s and [[wand]]s.{{Cite dragon/390/Lord of the Darkways|60-62}}",
        "Climate": "The city often had a bad smell to it, owing to the wind that blew in sulfurous air from the Lake of Steam. Sometimes, however, the wind came from the southeast, and this kept the smell of the lake away from the city.<ref> The lake kept the city damp and warm most of the year.<ref> The winter months tended to have the most rain and sunless days.<ref>",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|319}}, the [[Turmish]] Emperor at the time, [[Shoon VII]], took drastic measures ridding [[Ankhapur]], [[Calimport]], Innarlith, and [[Ithmong]] of crime. He ordered [[oil]] to be poured into the cities' [[sewer]]s, causing the [[Great Fires]] that destroyed the four cities nearly completely with the deathtoll going over three million people.\n\nSometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, a tome of magic known as the ''[[Book of Bats]]'' briefly appeared in the city of Innarlith  before being stolen and taken to the parts unknown.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]] was engaged in a breeding program to produce the mutant offspring of a male [[black dragon]] and female [[fire drake]]s, which he called [[black firedrake]]s, in a nursery underneath the second quarter of Innarlith. However, he had problems finding enough food to feed them. Some of the black firedrakes escaped to the surface and created mayhem and destruction, before being either killed by the city guard or teleported back to the nursery by Marek. Marek eventually transferred his nursery to a pocket dimension that he named the [[Land of One Hundred and Thirteen]].\n\nRansar [[Osorkon]] began a project to construct a canal from the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow river in the {{YearlinkName|1364}}. This would have successfully connected the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the oceans of [[Toril]]. The work of the project was given to a [[Cormyr]]ean engineer named [[Ivar Devorast]].<ref> However, the canal project was vehemently opposed by the Red Wizards of [[Thay]], who feared loss of revenue from their business of creating ''[[portal]]s'' for ships, and Rymüt worked to disrupt the canal. Rymüt lent his black firedrakes to support a coup led by his ally Senator [[Salatis]], which ended with the assassination of Osorkon and the placing of Salatis as the new Ransar of Innarlith. The new Ransar did not end the canal project, however. A product of Rymüt's support of the coup was the construction of a [[Thayan enclave (Innarlith)|Thayan enclave]] in Innarlith. Rymüt succeeded in getting the canal to rely on products sold by the enclave and switching to supporting the project.<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Senator [[Pristoleph]], a very wealthy [[fire genasi]], took control of the city after invading it with an army that he had raised at [[Firesteap Citadel]]. Rymüt betrayed Salatis for Pristoleph and got his black firedrakes to kill Salatis during the siege. Pristoleph then had himself declared the new Ransar.<ref>\n\nAround [[1372 DR]], Ransar Pristoleph cleaned out all rogue dens and monster dens in the [[Firesteap Mountains]] to protect the caravans. Ransar Pristoleph had minor ties to the church of [[Cyric]] through his senechal, a priest of Cyric named Wenefir. <ref>{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Moonstars: The Ankhapur Portal}}\n\nWhile Pristoleph was away on a trip to [[Shou Lung]] the henchmen of Marek Rymut had a magical portal created along the canal, thus ensuring that use of the canal would still fund Thay. Upon the Ransar's return, he was angry at this and tried to get rid of it, but the senate, which had largely fallen under Marek's influence, pressured him to acquiesce to it. In [[1374 DR]], Ivar Devorast, the chief builder of the canal, then detonated a large number of [[smokepowder]] charges along the length of the canal in key points that caused it be destroyed, because he felt the quality of his original vision had been lost.<ref>\n\nPristoleph arrested Devorast, but didn't put him to death. A faction of senators, under the nominal leadership of Senator [[Meykhati]] and under the actual control of Marek Rymut, then led a rebellion against Pristoleph that resulted in open warfare on the streets of Innarlith. After much of the city had been destroyed, Pristoleph agreed to peace terms that included him stepping down as Ransar. Pristoleph then went to address the senate at the [[Chamber of Law and Civility]] to give his resignation speech. However, during the speech he departed from the agreed upon speech to accuse the senate of being puppets to a foreign power. He then used his abilities as a [[fire genasi]] to cause the lights and candles in the room to burn the audience, who quickly scrambled out of the room. He himself escaped with the help of his [[wemic]] mercenaries and continued the war for another few months. His faction emerged victorious in the struggle and he exiled or executed all of his opponents, thus securing his control over the city-state and he ordered for the canal to be completed according to the original plan.<ref>",
