        "mainbody": "The '''Dragon Coast''' was the name given to the region along southern shore of the [[Dragonmere]], and the lands west of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Its city-states and pirate outposts served as confluence of several great cultures, from the archaic [[Old Kingdoms]] to the east, the profitable and deadly lands of the [[Vilhon Reach]] to the south, and the progressive and independent realms of the [[Western Heartlands]]. It was a place of intrigue and danger, where profit and lucrative opportunities abounded, for [[adventurer]]s, merchants and criminals alike.\n\n{{Quote|Everyone has a price. But the price is more reasonable on the Dragon Coast.|Saying in [[Sembia]].}}",
        "Description": "The coast has nearly always been an unrestrained land of free commerce and independent city-states, or as some may say, a places of lawlessness and piracy. The people that called these city-states their homes had little to no sense of greater identity, or national pride, but lived as solitary forces unto themselves.",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical features": "In the western stretch of the Dragon Coast, the [[Tun River]] flowed into the Dragonmere, forming the [[Gritstone Moorland]]s in between a series of hills north of the [[Overmoor Trail]]. Just east of these landmarks were the [[Castaway Coast]] and the [[Skeleton Shore]], the two coasts that made up the southern shores of the Dragonmere, the [[Horse Prairie]],{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}} along with the northern slopes of the [[Giant's Run Mountains]], and the nearby [[nameless swamp (Dragon Coast)|nameless swamp]].\n\nThe central area of the coast was highlighted by vast stretches of flatlands and interconnected bodies of water. Rainwater ran down from the Giant's Run peaks to the [[Lake of the Snake]], east along the [[River Reddan]] into [[Redwater (lake)|Redwater lake]], before emptying out into the sea. The lands north of these waterways was known as the [[Bleached Bones Flats]], and the diminutive river east of [[Westgate]] was called the [[River Thunn]]. \n\nA bit further east was the [[Long Arm Lake]], fed by the [[Wet River]]; and to its east, the [[Gulthmere Forest]]. The [[North Cedar River|North]] and [[South Cedar River]]s river that flowed north along [[Orbrekh]] and [[Orsraun Mountains]] respectively, through the forest to [[Starmantle Bay]].",
            "Flora & Fauna": "The wetlands of the coast were home to the [[red bog flower]]s. The leaves of these flowers were quite valuable in the illicit [[drug]] trade, selling for as much as 300 [[gp]]."

        "Government": "{{Quote|[[Waterdeep]] without [[Guilds of Waterdeep|guilds]] or (the) [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]].|[[Gulkyn Drouthe]]'s description of the Dragon Coast.}}\nUnlike nearby nations that formed from groups similarly-aligned cities, such as [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]], the powers of the Dragon Coast never came together under a common cause to form a single nation. As such the coast had no centralized governing body, but rather a collection of self-serving city-states.\n\nMost often, the individual city-states were each governed by some form of council of merchants, often of less-reputable dispositions.",
        "Trade": "The Dragon Coast was known first and foremost as a haven for smugglers and other folks dealing in illicit goods. Those merchants that chose to conduct their business in the region were not the type to cooperate with one another for the greater good, rather only look out for their own interests. \n\nThe [[Trueshield Trading Priakos]] maintained their headquarters and conducted their business predominantly on the Dragon Coast.",
        "Defenses": "While there was no shared military force on the Dragon Coast, individual territories or cities were often defended by mercenary groups and those individuals who took it upon themselves to serve as a local protectorate.",
        "History": "Thousands of years before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the Dragon Coast was considered to be part of the far-reaching [[Jhaamdath]] empire.\n\n[[Sage]]s of Faerûn differed as to how they believed the Dragon Coast earned its name, more specifically as to which ''actual'' [[dragon]] inspired the name.\n\nIn the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], the king of Westgate [[Verovan]] attempted to unite the various factions of the coast, but was assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}.\n\nAfter the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars dropped dramatically, following the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, coastal towns like [[Ilipur]] and [[Pros]] were abandoned and left to ruin.\n\nDuring the majority of the 15{{th}} century DR, the kingdom of [[Cormyr]] embarked upon a campaign of expansionism, taking hold of several towns and cities along the Dragon Coast, including Proskur in the {{YearlinkName|1405}}, and Teziir sometime later. Westgate managed to remain independent in the face of growing Cormyrean power.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Landmarks": "* [[Blacknight Manor]], personal residence of [[Indrith Shalla]].\n* [[Ginger Palace]], the 14{{th}} century embassy of the empire of [[Shou Lung]].\n* [[Stormwatch]], the 15{{th}} century domain of [[Orbakh]], the Night King of Westgate.",

            "Nations": "* [[Nathlan]], an independent realm known as the \"Eastern Nation of the West\".",
            "Roads": "Referred to by some scholars as the \"crossroads of Faerûn the Dragon Coast featured a number of important trade routes and roads, including:\n\n* [[Grand Ride]], the road that connected Westgate with Reddansyr and the greater Trader's Road.\n* [[Overmoor Trail]], path across the Gritstone Moorland from Elversult to Proskur.\n* [[The Plunge]], the small road from Elversult to the ruins of [[Ilipur]].\n* [[Snake Road]], the road south from Elversult to [[Wyrm's Hamlet]] on the [[Lake of the Snake]].\n* [[Trader's Road]]. the expansive trade route that crossed the coast, all the way from [[Iriaebor]] to Starmantle.{{Cite web/More Lake of Steam and Dragon Coast}}\n* [[Turnstone Road]], the road from Elversult to the former town of [[Pros]]."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The Dragon Coast attracted a host of cutthroat pirates, secretive associations, criminal organizations, and other groups that operated on the fringes of lawful society. Included among these groups were the [[Night Masks]] led by [[Orbakh]], the [[Fire Knives]] assassins, and the druids of the [[Fellowship of the Purple Staff]],\n\nMany [[tiefling]]s found a home on the Dragon Coast, finding the region to be the place where they could truly thrive, as did small communities of [[Half-elf|half-]][[aquatic elves]]."
