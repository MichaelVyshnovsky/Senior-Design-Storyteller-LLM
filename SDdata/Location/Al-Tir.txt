Al-Tir, also called the Bird, was a small island in the Great Sea off the coast of north Zakhara around 1367 DR.
The island was located approximately  northwest of the city of Liham. Several smaller unnamed islands were found just offshore of the Bird. A small landrise was found near the center of the island and the northwest corner was lightly forested. Al-Tir was approximately  long and  wide.
Both the corsairs of the Corsair Domains and representatives of the Free Cities of Zakhara attempted to claim al-Tir, with neither side able to establish permanent occupancy.
