'''Al-Tir''', also called the '''Bird''', was a small island in the [[Great Sea]] off the coast of [[north Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Geography==
The island was located approximately {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} northwest of the city of [[Liham]]. Several smaller unnamed islands were found just offshore of the Bird. A small landrise was found near the center of the island and the northwest corner was lightly forested. Al-Tir was approximately {{SI|60|mi|k|long=yes}} long and {{SI|30|mi|k|long=yes}} wide.

==Activities==
Both the [[Corsair Council|corsairs]] of the [[Corsair Domains]] and representatives of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] attempted to claim al-Tir, with neither side able to establish permanent occupancy.
