'''Gogal Pass''' offered a viable land route through [[Al-Yabki Mountains]], connecting two of the [[Pearl Cities]] of [[Zakhara]]â€”[[Gana]] in the west and [[Jumlat]] in the east.

==Description==
Located approximately {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} northwest of Jumlat, Gogol Pass was an important geographical feature of the Pearl Cities, allowing travel by land from the eastern coastal cities and Gana on the western side of the mountains.

The pass cut through the southern third of the mountain range for {{SI|30|mi|k|long=yes}}, opening in the west to a splendid view of [[Al-Sabiya River]] in the distance. The ruins of the fortress of [[Krak al-Shidda]] were nestled into the cliffs near the western entrance of the pass.

==Notable Locations==
* Krak al-Shidda
