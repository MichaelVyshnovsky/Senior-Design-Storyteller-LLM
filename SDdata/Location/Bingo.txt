Bingo was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura.
Nestled beneath Pine Tree Mountain, Bingo served as a crucial hub at the base of a major agricultural valley. It was the administrative center for the Niwa shoen.
Bingo served as a collection point for the rents and taxes gathered from the upper reaches of the mountains. To facilitate this, two large godowns were constructed within the village, vigilantly monitored by a sentry. Primarily stocked with rice, these godowns also stored a variety of other commodities, including cloth, tea, iron ore, and even traces of gold and silver ore. Among the underworld and societal outcasts, there were whispers that these godowns concealed even greater treasures.
As of , the villages jito was Naoki Katasube. Residing in opulence, he was surrounded by twenty servants. Known for his indolence and extravagant spending habits, Katasube showed a preference for luxury over confronting the perils that threatened his domain.
A contingent of one samurai and thirty bushi was stationed in Bingo. Naoki Katasube kept them in the dark about his illicit endeavors, maintaining a facade of legitimacy while engaging in corruption behind the scenes.
