'''Bingo''' was a village located in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Nestled beneath [[Pine Tree Mountain]], Bingo served as a crucial hub at the base of a major agricultural valley. It was the administrative center for the [[Niwa clan|Niwa]] [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']].

==Trade==
Bingo served as a collection point for the rents and taxes gathered from the upper reaches of the mountains. To facilitate this, two large [[Kozakuran dictionary#G|''godowns'']] were constructed within the village, vigilantly monitored by a sentry. Primarily stocked with [[rice]], these godowns also stored a variety of other commodities, including cloth, [[tea]], [[iron]] ore, and even traces of [[gold]] and [[silver]] ore. Among the underworld and societal outcasts, there were whispers that these godowns concealed even greater treasures.

==Government==
As of {{yearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, the village's [[jito]] was [[Naoki Katasube]]. Residing in opulence, he was surrounded by twenty servants. Known for his indolence and extravagant spending habits, Katasube showed a preference for luxury over confronting the perils that threatened his domain.

==Defenses==
A contingent of one [[samurai]] and thirty [[bushi]] was stationed in Bingo. Naoki Katasube kept them in the dark about his illicit endeavors, maintaining a facade of legitimacy while engaging in corruption behind the scenes.
