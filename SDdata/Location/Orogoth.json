It served as their headquarters for their dark magical experiments and efforts to gain control over dragons and to assume dragon shape. as well as of a titanic civil war in  during which the family seemingly wiped itself out.\nIn the , yuan-ti from Ssthartissssun raided the ruins and accidentally awoke a powerful black dragon known as \"the Old One\". Despite repeated incursions by the yuan-ti, the ruin henceforth became the home and lair of this Old One and his descendants, who claimed to be the last scions of the ancient Orogoth family. \nBy the , the Old One had enslaved several tribes of ophidians and had recruited Netherese wizards fleeing the fall of Anauria,\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the reputation and mystique of Orogoth suddenly exploded. The ruin of became well-known among treasure seekers throughout the Sword Coast, with Amnian adventurers and merchants becoming particularly enamored with tales of hidden caches of gems collected by the powerful ancient family. This fame was such that the ruin was mentioned in every guide to the area, and even children heard tales of it. However, those who visited were killed, sent fleeing, or were transformed into beasts.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the Old One and his descendants continued to lair in Orogoth.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the villa was home to the black dracolich Calathanorgoth&mdashbetter known as The Old One&mdashand his living great-grandson, Wastirek, along with Wastireks mate Vilholin and their children, Awsidorg, Woklef, Cheleen, and Kasidikal.\nNon-dragon inhabitants included human wizards descended from the Netherese recruited by Calathanorgoth centuries prior, many of whom studied ancient magic and collaborated with Halruaas wizards. In addition, the villa was the headquarters of the largest ophidian tribe in the High Moor, appropriately calling themselves the Tribe of the Old One. Owing to experiments with ophidian eggs, House Orogoth created a means to manufacture half-dragon versions of the creatures. As of the 1370s DR, the Tribe of the Old One was led by a half-black dragon ophidian named Abreauth."
