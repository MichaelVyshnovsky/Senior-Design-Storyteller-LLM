Individual colleges within the university system focused on particular specialties.\n\nThe university did not have a single location in the city, but its individual institutions were found on both sides of the [[River Rauvin]]. However, several of the schools were clustered together in a [[Southbank]] campus, where fourteen buildings were originally set aside for university use. These buildings included the original locations of the [[Lady's College]] and [[Miresk's School of Thaumaturgy]].\n\nThe university was in part funded by Alustriel herself, who sponsored promising students' tuition and the private research projects of various faculty members.",
