'''Caer Callidyrr''' was the walled as well as the [[Kingdom of Callidyrr]], Its castle was constructed from [[alabaster]] and it was the tallest man-made structure in the Moonshaes. It was inhabited by the monarchy of the [[Ffolk]].

{{quote|The miracle of Caer Callidyrr's construction was only slightly diminished when I learned that it is a relic from a prior age – the only real Golden Age of the Ffolk when their lands were united under the banner of the High King, Cymrych Hugh. As I journeyed across the isles, to Corwell, and then to Moray, I never saw another structure that could hope to rival the palace of the High King.|An excerpt from ''[[Travels Along the Sword Coast]]''}}

==Description==
[[File:Caer Callidyrr city.png|thumb|''A map of the City of Callidyrr showing the [[Castle Quarter]], the [[Forest Quarter]], the [[Plains Quarter]], and the [[Dock Quarter]].''|380x380px]]
Caer Callidyrr was a city that stood in the shadows of the castle that shared the city's name – Caer Callidyrr. Its spires, had numerous paved roads, alleys, and stairways that webbed its four quarters surrounding the great open square – the [[Market Square (Callidyrr)|Market Square]], located below the towering castle.

Like many other cities, Callidyrr had slums.

The city's harbor in Whitefish Bay was protected by the breakwater and a seawall created by the [[druid]]s.

Underneath Caer Callidyrr laid a network of storm sewers that drained through the seawall

==Geography==
The City of Callidyrr had two major roads that crossed its quarters and stretched beyond. The Fairheight Road ran from the city's Market Square northwest along the fortress's side and reached the [[Fairheight Mountains]]. The High King's Road was the second major road and an important highway of the isle of Alaron that ran south.

==Government==
Just like the entirety of the Kingdom of Callidyrr, the city of Caer Callidyrr was ruled by His Highness, High King Sovereign of Callidyrr and monarch of all the lands of the Ffolk. King [[Reginald Carrathal]] held the title ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1346}} and after the rebellion of the same year, the Crown of the Isles was claimed by [[Tristan Kendrick]].

==Culture==
[[File:CaerCallidyrr.png|thumb|''A 14{{th}} century [[DR]] map of Caer Callidyrr fortress.''|380x380px]]
The Ffolk inhabitants of Caer Callidyrr were generally considered to be friendly and accustomed to the visitors from across the [[Sword Coast]]. The city was a bright and cheerful setting of busy markets, fabled weaponsmiths, and abundant entertainment of musicians, [[minstrel]]s, and [[bard]]s. The city streets were always hosting musicians performing their music for the citizens daily, making many guests mistakingly confuse an ordinary day for a festival. The music typically consisted of Ffolk bards, Waterdhavian minstrels, and pipe players of Calimshan. It was virtually impossible to avoid ever-present singing and music. Its many taverns were relatively quiet, pleasant, and clean, which was not typical for similar port cities.

Unlike music, magic was somewhat rare in Caer Callidyrr.

==Trade==
The city was a busy, bustling hub of trade and barter. It was the biggest and the wealthiest city of the Moonshaes, with a small flotilla of fishing vessels entering and leaving the bay daily. The city's shipyards constructed sturdy seafaring vessels, and docks provided anchorage to many trade [[galleon]]s and [[longship]]s. Mechanical pulley-operated cranes were seen rising above the water, transporting catch to nearby canneries that dotted the shores.

Caer Callidyrr had busy naval trade routes that connected it to several important trade hubs. The route to [[Waterdeep]] was a journey of about eight days, and the Ffolk merchant sold their fine [[steel]], buying [[oil]], [[spice]]s, and cloth from the inhabitants of [[north Faerûn]]. The route to [[Calimport]] provided the Moonsaes with [[silk]]s, fine fabrics, spices, [[parchment]], and [[horse]]s while supplying Calimport with steel and [[weapon]]s. Within the [[Sea of Moonshae]], Caer Callidyrr sold fine weapons to [[Corwell]] and bought [[ale]]s, [[sheep]]and horses, and able-bodied workers, while [[Moray]] bought weapons and steel and sold [[ore]]s and [[coal]]. Lastly, the isle of [[Mintarn]] bought lumber from Caer Callidyrr.

Caer Callidyrr was known for producing and exporting thick [[Callidyrr mead]]. Valuable illicit trade goods found on the streets of Callidyrr after dark included [[Calishite]] [[ginyak weed]] as well as able-bodied slaves from [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]].

==Defenses==
The city was protected by the [[Scarlet Guard]], the mercenary company loyal to the High King. The Guard was split into four brigades, each overseeing its quarter of Caer Callidyrr. Each brigade, in turn, was split into individual companies, each of which had its own insignia that was flown in streaming pennants atop the Callidyrr castle. Their uniform consisted of bright red [[cloak]]s and [[helmet]]s topped with tall red plumage. The first three brigades consisted of [[human]] veterans and mercenaries. The fourth brigade, however, possessed an awe and terror-inspiring reputation – the [[ogre]] brigade.

The [[Callidyrr dragoons]] were famed defenders of the realm and the capital city in the 15{{th}} century DR, founded by the High Queen [[Alicia Kendrick]], when the Moonshaes were plagued by [[Amn]]ian invaders, ravaging [[lycanthrope]]s, and [[giant]]s. Their ranks were filled from the acomplished members of the High King's elite guard. They were not part of the kingdom's army but served as special agents of the crown.{{Cite dragon/405/Heroes of the Moonshaes|405}}
