Galadorna, also styled The Unicorn Kingdom, was a kingdom in the Wizards Reach until the midâ€“8 century DR.
Galadorna was in the Wizards Reach, centered around Nethrar it did not extend all the way to Laothkund.
A king reigned in Galadorna. There were a number of barons under him among those barons were Tholone, Hothal, Maethor, Feldrin, and Belundrar.
Galadorna had mines of iron and silver.
Each baron of Galadorna had significant retinues and all of them contributed to the kingdoms defense.
During the reign of King Baerimgrim, the self-styled Lord Tholone, one of the barons, had been ignoring court decrees since approximately .
One bright summer day in the , about a year after the king was gravely injured by the green dragon Arlavaunta, King Baeringrim held a meeting with his barons to determine the successor they chose Tholone to be the next king. However, both men were slain by Nadrathen, a Chosen of Mystra, who crowned himself king in their place. After his fellow Chosen, Elminster, stopped him, the Banite sorceress Dasumia slew Nadrathen and took over as Queen of Galadorna.
Under her reign, Galadorna became rife with feuding mages and was chaotic yet wealthy.
The Unicorn Kingdom was ultimately destroyed by the Lords of Laothkund, within a tenday of the Queens disappearance, very likely within the year.
