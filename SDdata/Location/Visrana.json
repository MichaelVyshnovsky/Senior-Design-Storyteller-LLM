        "mainbody": "Visrana was a ruined city within the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.\nThe ancient and decaying ruins of Visrana were discovered by Kuong soldiers in service to the temple of the Lords of Creation. Exploring the long-sealed tombs, they inadvertently unleashed spectres and other wicked creatures. Thereafter, they abandoned the city to the jungle once more, and the Priest-King of the day forbade any exploration of the ruins or their surroundings, and only the courage or the foolish tried. The nat of Visrana went on to plague Gapapurang.\nBy the midâ€“14 century DR, the ruins and jungles around were haunted by spectres, nat, and other supernatural creatures."
