'''Taitung''' (also written as '''Tai Tung'''

==Geography==
It stood on the [[Ch'ing Tung River]], near the southern end of the [[First Emperor's Canal]] and the northern end of [[Second Emperor's Canal]]. It also stood at the crossroads where the [[Kuan Postroad]] met the [[the Road of 7 Drunkards]], between the [[Bridge of Taitung]] and [[Spectre's Bridge]], and where the [[Kaifeng Highway]] (which followed the canal) joined the [[Spice Road]].

==Description==
It was a major city ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

==Notable Locations==
The emperor of Shou Lung had a [[summer palace]] here, which included the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

There were many docks on the river and canal. 

==Trade==
Many caravans traveling the Spice Road started or ended at Tai Tung.<ref>

==History==
After [[Yamun Khahan]] and the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] breached the [[Dragonwall]] on [[Tarsakh 19]], {{YearlinkConvert|2609|SY}}, they rode across the [[Plain of Horses]] for Tai Tung, sacking [[Lo Tu]] on the way. Minister of War [[Kwan Chan Sen]] led an army out of Tai Tung to face them, but was defeated at the [[Battle of the Sorghum Field]] on [[Tarsakh 30]] and the survivors regrouped and returned there. The emperor's summer palace was repurposed as a temporary command center for waging the war, Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] came in person to grant command to General [[Batu Min Ho]]. The armies camped in a meadow several miles outside the city, as they were too many to be accommodated in the city itself.

At the close of the war, Yamun's envoy and Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] met in the summer palace of Tai Tung and signed a peace treaty, before the Tuigan departed on [[Eleint 9]].
