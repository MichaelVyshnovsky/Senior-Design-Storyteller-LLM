Cathyr (also seen as Cathtyr) was a metropolis and the capital city of Dambrath. It was formerly known as Shantil.
Cathyr sat in a small bay on the far eastern end of Dambrath. It marked the final southern stop of the Traders Way. The inner city was crowded and bustling. At the center of the city sat the queens palace which was surrounded by broad green parks. The wealthy lived in two or three story town houses on the west side, while most of the poor huddled together in the eastern sections of the city closer to the docks. Some lived outside the city walls in hovels that reached southward along the coast.
Cathyr had a garrison of 2,000 troops to keep order and defend the city from invaders and monsters. Cathyr also had a fleet of 12 warships, half closely defended the port while the other half patrolled the waters near the city out to sea.
