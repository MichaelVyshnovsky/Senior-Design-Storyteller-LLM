        "mainbody": "Sunset Hill was a thinly spread-out hamlet in Cormyr, built around a famously haunted hill of the same name.\nThe name \"Sunset Hill\" originated from beautifully golden hue sunsets that glistened and reflected off the haunted hill. The golden tingle was held on the hills slopes long after the evening gloom swallowed the surroundings. One could think that a fortress could stand atop Sunset Hill however, there was nothing but grazing sheep. At some point in its past, the hill was a location of gallows, long gone by the 14 century DR. The hills dark history was the reason for its famous or infamous hauntings. On an occasional night, ghostly apparitions of hanging bodies flickered into existence atop Sunset Hill.\nThe hamlet and its surroundings were lush grass-covered hills. Three large ponds were located at the namesake hills base. The hamlets cottages were scantly scattered across the ponds shores and the hills base. Sunset Hill could be called a settlement, but it lacked any form of government.\nSunset Hill was located east of the small shepherd town of Bospir. Not far south of Masoners Bridge across the Immerflow, just on the rivers mouth on the Wyvernwater lake. The hamlet also was connected to the city of Immersea and the East Way through the Immer Trail.\nSunset Hills shepherd believed that when its apparitions formed at night, any sheep still grazing in the area were cursed, transforming into monstrous beings with leathery wings known as dark horrors. These flying monsters were believed to attack and carry off straggling sheep and folk, only to transform back into normal sheep come the morning."
