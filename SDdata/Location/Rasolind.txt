'''Rasolind''' was a village located in the country of [[Mulhorand]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|B1dlc}} 

==Geography==
Rasolind was a coastal town located approximately {{SI|5|mi|k|long=yes}} south of [[Neldorild]] in western Mulhorand along the southeastern coast of the [[Alamber Sea]].

==Activities==
Rasolind served as a supply station for Mulhorand's fishing fleet that was based in [[Delgora]] further south down the coast. The village sprung to life after an influx of wealthy inhabitants in Neldorild forced the dockworkers, and others associated with the fishing industry, from their city.
