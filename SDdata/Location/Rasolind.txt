Rasolind was a village located in the country of Mulhorand during the midâ€“14 century DR. 
Rasolind was a coastal town located approximately  south of Neldorild in western Mulhorand along the southeastern coast of the Alamber Sea.
Rasolind served as a supply station for Mulhorands fishing fleet that was based in Delgora further south down the coast. The village sprung to life after an influx of wealthy inhabitants in Neldorild forced the dockworkers, and others associated with the fishing industry, from their city.
