The '''Trades Ward''' was one of the seven wards of the city of [[Waterdeep]]. It was the main shopping district of Waterdeep and housed many of the city's guildhalls. 

==Geography==
The ward was bounded in the south by the [[Southern Ward of Waterdeep|Southern Ward]], in the west by [[Castle Ward]], in the north by [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] and the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]] and in the east by the [[Trollwall]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], over the course of a [[tenday]] and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of [[ghost]]ly sightings that left many citizens, scribes, and members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] confused. Some speculated if a [[wizard]] experimenting with [[illusion]]s may have been the cause. Others speculated it was a wizard seeking to harm local businesses, drive down local property values, or simply spread fear&mdash;though all who put forward these theories admitted to having nothing to backup their claims.

Some interpreted the apparitions as being a message &mdash; [[Sambral|Sambral the Soothsayer]] would claim the dead were warning Waterdhavians of impending battles from underground invaders, [[Sheireera|Sheireera of the Prophecies]] would claim that it was the dead crying out against immorality and lawlessness in Waterdeep, and [[priest]] [[Thalomaun]] of the [[Church of Lathander]] would make a proclamation on [[Virgin's Square]] that it was a sign from the dead for the living of the affected neighborhoods to do away with old businesses and make way for new ones.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Ghost Sightings}}
