'''Murbant''' was a previously-independent coastal settlement that came under the control of [[Thay]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], under the greater tharch of [[Priador]]. It was located on the northern shore of the [[Alamber Sea]],

==Description==
Great slave plantations and freeholds encompassed the lands surrounding Murbant. They were occasionally assaulted by monsters that were kept on the estates of [[Red Wizards]].

The people of Murbant made their living as fishermen and smugglers. After Thay took control of the town, the citizens paid their taxes to Thayan officials but were largely ignored by the ruling [[tharchion]].

==History==
When Murbant was an independent city, it maintained a [[Cities of the North Coast|loose alliance]] with coastal cities of [[Delthuntle]], [[Escalant]], [[Laothkund]], [[Lasdur]], [[Nethta]], [[Taskaunt]], [[Teth]], and [[Thasselen]], a number of which extended west into the [[Wizards' Reach]].

The town was seized by Thay during the [[Salamander War]] in the year [[1357 DR]].
