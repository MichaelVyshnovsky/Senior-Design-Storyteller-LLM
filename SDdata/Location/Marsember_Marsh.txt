The '''Marsember Marsh''' was an area of marshland that stretched along the northern shore of the [[Dragonmere]] for several miles, occupying the mouth of the [[Starwater River]]. It was inhabited by [[lizardfolk]], but when a war broke out, most were slain, and the area was taken over by [[will-o'-wisp]]s and other creatures. It eventually became the site of the city of [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]].
