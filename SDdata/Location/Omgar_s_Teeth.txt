'''Omgar's Teeth''' was a rocky patch of reefs and shallows along the eastern shores of [[Samar Bay]], across from the [[Snout of Omgar]]. The Teeth were to the south of [[Samargol]], the capital of [[Samarach]], the Hidden Kingdom.

==Description==
The Teeth was a sandy beach with perilous jagged rocks sticking out of the shores and from the waters. [[Palm]] trees grew in abundance along the shore, and the land was regularly raided by local [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s in search of shipwrecks, lost cargo, and survivors. Sporadic bands of [[gnoll]]s, [[orc]]s, and wandering [[undead]] were known to appear there. Patrols of Samarach regularly passed along Omgar's Teeth.

==History==
[[File:Omgar's Teeth map.png|thumb|''A map showing location of Omgar's Teeth, across the bay from the [[Snout of Omgar]].''|285x285px]]
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a merchant vessel that traveled from the [[Sword Coast]] to Samarach was caught in a deadly storm off the shores of the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. The cracked remnants of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' were tossed onto the sharp rocks of Omgar's Teeth and several survivors of the wreck reached the safety of the shores in a small boat. Among the survivors were the renowned writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] and several [[adventurer]]s and sailors of the ''Vigilant''. Soon after the wreck, Omgar's Teeth became a site of the battle between the survivors of the crash and several bands of man-eating Batiri led by [[Clawkeeper Kzheemoc]], [[Ghzermag the Wild]], and [[Shoudul of the Skulls]].
