Idol Island was an island on the mudflats just off the town of Leilon.
The island was uninhabited but covered in ancient and mysterious ruins.
Idol Island sat out in the marshland off Leilon that extended to the Sea of Swords. The island was located just beyond Quayside, the towns harbor.
The locals would hear ominous whispers from the island at night, and it was rumored that anyone brave enough to spend the night there would experience prophetic dreams.
