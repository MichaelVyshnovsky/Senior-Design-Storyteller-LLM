As of {{yearlink|1373}}, she was ferociously fighting the [[Shadowmasters]] of [[Telflamm]]. She financed her government by charging 1% of the value of any cargo brought into the city by wagon, a tax entirely paid by traders. She was a guild favourite.",

            "The Seer's Eye": "This storefront had several adventurers offering their services as spell users. They included clerics both evil and good under the proprietor, a former [[red wizard]] named [[Hamal Kom]].

It was hidden from view down a tight alley, its dome slightly protruding from beneath an unkempt grassy courtyard. Near it, broad stone stairs descended nine steps to a door. The dome was full of holes, which allowed sunlight down into the room. The structure had its inner walls lined with bookshelves, a desk in the middle, and numerous strange objects were hung from the ceiling.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|49-51|6}}"

        "Temples": "The only temple of note, that wasn't kept by a single priest attending only to the faithful, was a temple to [[Shaundakul]] built by [[Shanton Gallidy]], the Lady's cousin. Despite the community's size, the temple was the largest in the East."
