He was approached by several former students of Trothas Helegaras, the ruler of Daggers Point, who volunteered to aid Falious in taking control of the criminal city. However, these students turned out to be double agents in Helegarass employ. They betrayed Falious, cast a powerful disintegrate spell on Tanathrass mythallar, and escaped using contingency. Tanathras plummeted into the side of the Dagger Mountains and was destroyed.\n*Falious, ruler of Tanathras around the time of its destruction."
