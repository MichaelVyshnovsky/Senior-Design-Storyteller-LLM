        "mainbody": "'''The Wide''' was a district in the [[Upper City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] that served as a vast open-air marketplace and plaza. It was a place where Baldurians and outsiders alike could gather together to gossip, trade, debate politics and discuss issues of the day, or otherwise conduct their business within the city. Its reputation as a market and public forum was well-known across [[Faerûn]], as far away as the nation of [[Thay]].",
        "Geography": "The Wide was one location in Baldur's Gate that housed a passageway leading down to the [[Undercellar]].",
        "Description": "The main attraction of the Wide were the vast number of temporary stalls and booths that were operated by merchants, artists, artisans, fortune-tellers, [[hedge wizard]]s, [[sage]]s—or whomever had a service or good to sell within Baldur's Gate. A great variety of commodities were offered within, from textiles and [[spices]] from the [[Shining South]] to locally-made tools or silk from foreign lands. These stalls often featured brightly-hued awnings that caught the eye, and their purveyors offered prices that were lower than anywhere else it the city.\n\nTables were set up between the stalls, upon which folks could sit and take a brief reprieve from the bustle of the crowds.\n\nThe typically musky smell that permeated the Gate was masked by the scent of spices, tobacco and roasted meats that were prepared nearby.",
        "Governance": "Management of the Wide was left to its [[Bailiff of the Wide|Bailiff]], a thankless job that was bestowed upon any individual capable enough and willing to coordinate the needs of the marketplace. They established which market stalls could be placed in which location, settle disputes, and keep record of each and every partition of sanctioned market space within the Wide.\n\nRegulation of the Wide was reinforced by members of [[the Watch]].",
        "Activities": "[[File:The Wide.jpg|250px|thumb|''The Wide at night.'']]\nBefore dawn, the Bailiff and their assistants met at the [[Beloved Ranger]] to discuss which vendors were allowed what space in the Wide, a process that included a complex algorithm dependent on vendors' history in the city, the goods they offered, the demand of the city's crowds, and previous history as a merchant. While bribes of [[gold]] were typically turned down by most bailiffs, but not all of them, donating extra goods during \"routine inspection\" often led to preferential placement.\n\nAt first light, many servants and liveries lined up outside the Wide to await arrival of the merchants. The finest and freshest goods were purchased by those working for the city's wealthiest residents.\n\nTo manage deliveries through the crowds of the Wide, young couriers wore tall poles strapped to their torsos, atop which were strapped their parcels. These \"pole-carters\" were offered significant protection from thieves while in the market.\n\nJust before dusk, as the last of the merchants' goods were transported to their destinations, [[the Watch]] began to clear the wide of bystanders.",
