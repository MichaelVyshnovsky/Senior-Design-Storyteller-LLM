        "mainbody": "sarem, literally meaning Empire of Arem, was the nation of shalarin in Serôs beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nAsarem spanned much of the northeastern Sea of Fallen Stars, reaching from the Hmur Plateau and abyssal plains east of the Pirate Isles and north of the Whamite Isles, to the Caverns of Khinas and shores of the Great Dale in the Easting Reach. It was the largest nation beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars upon its founding and through at least the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe empire comprised four kingdoms the breadbasket of Esdaan on the Poioa Plateau south of Impiltur, the military powerhouse of Espurr between the Bymmal Trench and the Paolin Reef west of Thesk, the rich and opulent religious center of Esrath east of the Pirate Isles, and the art and smithing center of Esroch in the Easting Reach.\nThe empire was organized as a feudal system with an eadar (emperor) at the top. The eadar was sheltered and distant from the day-to-day affairs of the empire, While the eadar was the nominal ruler of this confederation of kingdoms, they shared power with the finars and their commands were not absolute.\nThe capital city was Usrath, located within the kingdom of Esrath, where the Great Palace of Ritapanal was located. Each of the other three kingdoms capitals also contained an imperial palace adjacent to the royal palace.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Asarem had been ruled for over a century by its 22nd eadar, the then elderly and sickly Riolacon. His heir was Riolakirk, a young ranger. \nThe empire held a seat at the Nantarn Council alongside the other notable nations of Serôs.\nEsdaan was the center of agriculture in the empire, harvesting 80% of all of Asarems food from their abundant fields of kelp, sponge, and sea urchin. They were also a major exporter, and provided approximately a quarter of Myth Nantars food and similar amounts to other allies of the shalarins. Espurr also had a sizeable amount of farmland, although that kingdom was perhaps better known for the hunting in its wildernesses.\nEsroch was the center of crafting, producing artistically carved coral and jewelry, as well as weapons, armor (including the shalarins famous silverweave and pearl armors), and other metalwork. \nAsarem was a highly structured and traditionalist society with a strict caste system The Protectors were mostly located in Espurr, and their equivalents in Esrath were sometimes called the Warriors.\nEach of the four kingdoms could be said to have its own unique subculture Esdaan were more laid back and less interested in politics Espurr was the most militant as well as the historic center for arcane magical study, having produced the largest number of shalarin Dukars Esrath was opulent and traditional, and was the center of religion in the empire and Esroch was the most industrious of the kingdoms as well as the center of shalarin art and music.\nAsarem used the Serôsian calendar.\nBuildings in Asarem were often square and made from hydrozoan wood reinforced with kelp and pearl. Roofs were tiled with seashells. In the cities, coral and stone were also common construction materials, with brilliant white star coral used exclusively to build the four imperial palaces. Domes and towers were common motifs on more extravagant buildings.\nAt great depths, Asarem settlements were often lit by lucent coral. \nThe city of Usrath in Esrath was where the highest concentration of shalarin temples was located, owing to that city being where the Wildtide Gate was located. In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, worship of Deep Sashelas (Rideashela) was becoming increasingly popular.\nFollowing the Fifth Shalarin Passing, some shalarin of Asarem returned to the worship of their silent ancestral gods, and in particular turned away from Umberlee (Rideabrela) to do so. At the same time, a cult of Dagon known as the Cult of Corynactis began to take root in the empire.\nThe Asarem military was outfitted largely by troops from Espurr, who defended not only their own borders but those of Esdaan and Esroch as well. Their standing army was known as the Knights of Espurr and comprised not only warriors but rangers and wizards. The kingdom maintained a Military Academy at Uscurn.\nOver the course of its existence, Asarem had been both allies and enemies with nations of nearly every other race in Serôs&mdashincluding the merfolk, sea elves, ixitxachitls, merrow, koalinth, sahuagin, and tritons&mdashoften existing at best in a state of tense neutrality. However, as of the , they had joined with many of these races as part of the Nantarn Alliance in an effort to create a stable peace. Owing to the closer ties to the tritons that this alliance afforded, the Asarem military gained access to the tapal in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nWhile the term \"Asarem\" may have been used to refer to the shalarin lands in Serôs much earlier, the realm itself was formed in the , shortly after the Third Shalarin Passing, during which the kingdoms of Esdaan and Espurr were founded by newly arrivedf shalarin from the Sea of Corynactis. These fledgling shalarin kingdoms united with the more established shalarin kingdom of Esrath to form the Asarem empire under the first eadar, Riaratup.\nAsarem fought alongside Hmurrath in the Eighth Serôs War (&ndash) against the ixitxachitls of Paolan Reef.\nFollowing the end of the Ninth Serôs War (&ndash), Asarem worked with the merfolk and Dukars of Serôs in hopes of creating a treaty to prevent future genocidal conflicts. In the , they were party to the drafting of The Laws of Battle.\nDuring the Tenth Serôs War (&ndash), Asarem found themselves at war simultaneously with the merfolk and sea elves.\nIn the , following the Fourth Shalarin Passing, Esroch was founded by the latest wave of newcomers from the Sea of Corynactis as the fourth kingdom of Asarem, and the empire achieved the geographic size that it would maintain for the next several centuries, save for a brief period of expansion of Espurr under the rule of its 60th finar, Rialatarl, between the , and the .\nDuring the Eleventh Serôs War (&ndash), Asarem allied with the merrow, koalinth, and merfolk peoples against the sea elves of Keryvyr, Naramyr, and SeluMaraar. This was during the reign of the 17th eadar, Riarakos.\nIn the , Riolacon became the 22nd eadar at age 116.\nIn the , an assassin cut short the 78 year rule of Espurrs 61st finar, Rialaporath, and the Espurr royal seat was usurped by Riyrakrin IX. The usurpers rule lasted one month before he was executed by the Espurr military, and the rightful heir, Rialasord, became the 62nd finar of Espurr. However, this began an 80 year feud between the ruling Ala clan and the usurper Yra clan, who had been the kingdoms historic rulers. Both Rialasord and her heir, Rialatarl II, would be assassinated. Finally, Rialavor, the 64th finar of Espurr, ended the feud by decimating the Yra clan and exiling the survivors.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in the , aggressive magical currents appeared in Asarem, and strangled Finar Rialavor.\nThe shalarin did not at first participate in the Twelfth Serôs War in the , however they did join an alliance with the merfolk of Voalidru and the tritons of Pumana amid concern about the intentions of the evil armies of Iakhovas. Then, on Eleint 2, they entered the war in response to an attack by Iakhovass sahuagin on three hatcheries in Esrath which resulted in the deaths of over one thousand unhatched shalarins. Also lost in this attack was Riolasur, the heir of Eadar Riolacon.\nAfter the end of the war on Uktar 12 of 1369 DR,While the Sea of Fallen Stars sourcebook (p. 75) states that Riolacon was assassinated in 1370 DR, the novel Queen of the Depths features Riolacon alive and still serving in his capacity as eadar as of 1373 DR.\nFollowing the Fifth Shalarin Passing in the , the Wildtide Gate did not close as it normally did, leaving Asarem linked to the Dagon-worshiping shalarin civilization in the Sea of Corynactis. Keeping the open portal a secret while also combating the rise of the Cult of Corynactis within their own realm became the new priority.\nIn the , Asarem suffered from dragon attacks owing to the Rage of Dragons that year, and joined their allies to face a flight of dragons at Myth Nantar. In exchange for securing powerful weapons for this battle from a shalarin priestess of Umberlee, Tualaketh, the eadar was forced to swear that all of Asarem would pay homage at Umberlees temples once each tenday through the .\n*Usdaan, capital of the kingdom of Esdaan.\n*Uspurr, capital of the kingdom of Espurr.\n*Usrath, capital of the kingdom of Esrath and of the whole empire.\n*Usroch, capital of the kingdom of Esroch.\n*Riolacon, the 22nd eadar of Asarem, and ruled the empire from the late&ndash11 century DR through the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
