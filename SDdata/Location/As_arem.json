        "mainbody": "'''As'arem''', literally meaning '''Empire of Arem''', was the nation of [[shalarin]] in [[Serôs]] beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].",
        "Geography": "As'arem spanned much of the northeastern Sea of Fallen Stars, reaching from the [[Hmur Plateau]] and abyssal plains east of the [[Pirate Isles]] and north of the [[Whamite Isles]], to the [[Caverns of Khinas]] and shores of the [[Great Dale]] in the [[Easting Reach]]. It was the largest nation beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars upon its founding and through at least the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nThe empire comprised four kingdoms: the breadbasket of [[Es'daan]] on the [[Po'ioa Plateau]] south of [[Impiltur]], the military powerhouse of [[Es'purr]] between the [[Bymmal Trench]] and the [[Paolin Reef]] west of [[Thesk]], the rich and opulent religious center of [[Es'rath]] east of the Pirate Isles, and the art and smithing center of [[Es'roch]] in the Easting Reach.",
        "Government": "The empire was organized as a feudal system with an eadar (emperor) at the top. The eadar was sheltered and distant from the day-to-day affairs of the empire, While the eadar was the nominal ruler of this confederation of kingdoms, they shared power with the finars and their commands were not absolute.\n\nThe capital city was [[Us'rath]], located within the kingdom of Es'rath, where the Great Palace of [[Ri'ta'panal]] was located. Each of the other three kingdoms' capitals also contained an imperial palace adjacent to the royal palace.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, As'arem had been ruled for over a century by its 22nd eadar, the then elderly and sickly [[Ri'ola'con]]. His heir was [[Ri'ola'kirk]], a young [[ranger]]. \n\nThe empire held a seat at the [[Nantarn Council]] alongside the other notable nations of Serôs.",
        "Trade": "Es'daan was the center of agriculture in the empire, harvesting 80% of all of As'arem's food from their abundant fields of [[kelp]], [[sponge]], and [[sea urchin]]. They were also a major exporter, and provided approximately a quarter of [[Myth Nantar]]'s food and similar amounts to other allies of the shalarins. Es'purr also had a sizeable amount of farmland, although that kingdom was perhaps better known for the hunting in its wildernesses.\n\nEs'roch was the center of crafting, producing artistically carved [[coral]] and jewelry, as well as weapons, armor (including the shalarins' famous [[Silverweave armor|silverweave]] and [[pearl armor]]s), and other metalwork.",
        "Culture": {
            "Architecture": "Buildings in As'arem were often square and made from [[hydrozoan]] wood reinforced with [[kelp]] and [[pearl]]. Roofs were tiled with seashells. In the cities, coral and stone were also common construction materials, with brilliant white [[star coral]] used exclusively to build the four imperial palaces. Domes and towers were common motifs on more extravagant buildings.\n\nAt great depths, As'arem settlements were often lit by [[lucent coral]].",
            "Religion": "The city of Us'rath in Es'rath was where the highest concentration of shalarin temples was located, owing to that city being where the ''[[Wildtide Gate]]'' was located. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, worship of [[Deep Sashelas]] (Ri'dea'shela) was becoming increasingly popular.\n\nFollowing the [[Fifth Shalarin Passing]], some shalarin of As'arem returned to the worship of their silent ancestral gods, and in particular turned away from [[Umberlee]] (Ri'dea'brela) to do so. At the same time, a cult of [[Dagon]] known as the [[Cult of Corynactis]] began to take root in the empire."
        },
        "Defenses": "The As'arem military was outfitted largely by troops from Es'purr, who defended not only their own borders but those of Es'daan and Es'roch as well. Their standing army was known as the [[Knights of Es'purr]] and comprised not only warriors but [[ranger]]s and [[wizard]]s. The kingdom maintained a [[Military Academy (Es'purr)|Military Academy]] at [[Us'curn]].\n\nOver the course of its existence, As'arem had been both allies and enemies with nations of nearly every other race in Serôs&mdash;including the [[merfolk]], [[sea elves]], [[ixitxachitl]]s, [[merrow]], [[koalinth]], [[sahuagin]], and [[triton]]s&mdash;often existing at best in a state of tense neutrality. However, as of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, they had joined with many of these races as part of the [[Nantarn Alliance]] in an effort to create a stable peace. Owing to the closer ties to the tritons that this alliance afforded, the As'arem military gained access to the [[tapal]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "While the term \"As'arem\" may have been used to refer to the shalarin lands in Serôs much earlier, the realm itself was formed in the {{YearlinkName|-51}}, shortly after the [[Third Shalarin Passing]], during which the kingdoms of Es'daan and Es'purr were founded by newly arrivedf shalarin from the [[Sea of Corynactis]]. These fledgling shalarin kingdoms united with the more established shalarin kingdom of Es'rath to form the As'arem empire under the first eadar, [[Ri'ara'tup]].\n\nAs'arem fought alongside [[Hmurrath]] in the [[Eighth Serôs War]] ({{Yearlink|319}}&ndash;{{Yearlink|321}}) against the ixitxachitls of Paolan Reef.\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Ninth Serôs War]] ({{Yearlink|653}}&ndash;{{Yearlink|656}}), As'arem worked with the merfolk and Dukars of Serôs in hopes of creating a treaty to prevent future genocidal conflicts. In the {{YearlinkName|660}}, they were party to the drafting of ''[[The Laws of Battle]]''.\n\nDuring the [[Tenth Serôs War]] ({{Yearlink|709}}&ndash;{{Yearlink|750}}), As'arem found themselves at war simultaneously with the merfolk and sea elves.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|916}}, following the [[Fourth Shalarin Passing]], Es'roch was founded by the latest wave of newcomers from the Sea of Corynactis as the fourth kingdom of As'arem, and the empire achieved the geographic size that it would maintain for the next several centuries, save for a brief period of expansion of Es'purr under the rule of its 60th finar, [[Ri'ala'tarl]], between the {{YearlinkName|1135}}, and the {{YearlinkName|1204}}.\n\nDuring the [[Eleventh Serôs War]] ({{Yearlink|936}}&ndash;{{Yearlink|942}}), As'arem allied with the merrow, koalinth, and merfolk peoples against the sea elves of [[Keryvyr]], [[Naramyr]], and [[Selu'Maraar]]. This was during the reign of the 17th eadar, [[Ri'ara'kos]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1245}}, Ri'ola'con became the 22nd eadar at age 116.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1278}}, an assassin cut short the 78 year rule of Es'purr's 61st finar, [[Ri'ala'porath]], and the Es'purr royal seat was usurped by [[Ri'yra'krin IX]]. The usurper's rule lasted one month before he was executed by the Es'purr military, and the rightful heir, [[Ri'ala'sord]], became the 62nd finar of Es'purr. However, this began an 80 year feud between the ruling [[Ala]] clan and the usurper [[Yra]] clan, who had been the kingdom's historic rulers. Both Ri'ala'sord and her heir, [[Ri'ala'tarl II]], would be assassinated. Finally, [[Ri'ala'vor]], the 64th finar of Es'purr, ended the feud by decimating the Yra clan and exiling the survivors.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, aggressive magical currents appeared in As'arem, and strangled Finar Ri'ala'vor.\n\nThe shalarin did not at first participate in the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, however they did join an alliance with the merfolk of [[Voalidru]] and the tritons of [[Pumana]] amid concern about the intentions of the evil armies of [[Iakhovas]]. Then, on [[Eleint 2]], they entered the war in response to an attack by Iakhovas's sahuagin on three hatcheries in Es'rath which resulted in the deaths of over one thousand unhatched shalarins. Also lost in this attack was [[Ri'ola'sur]], the heir of Eadar Ri'ola'con.\n\nAfter the end of the war on [[Uktar 12]] of 1369 DR,While the ''[[Sea of Fallen Stars (sourcebook)|Sea of Fallen Stars]]'' sourcebook (p. 75) states that Ri'ola'con was assassinated in [[1370 DR]], the novel ''[[Queen of the Depths]]'' features Ri'ola'con alive and still serving in his capacity as eadar as of [[1373 DR]].\n\nFollowing the Fifth Shalarin Passing in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the ''Wildtide Gate'' did not close as it normally did, leaving As'arem linked to the Dagon-worshiping shalarin civilization in the Sea of Corynactis. Keeping the open ''[[portal]]'' a secret while also combating the rise of the Cult of Corynactis within their own realm became the new priority.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, As'arem suffered from [[dragon]] attacks owing to the [[Rage of Dragons]] that year, and joined their allies to face a [[flight of dragons]] at Myth Nantar. In exchange for securing powerful weapons for this battle from a shalarin priestess of Umberlee, [[Tu'ala'keth]], the eadar was forced to swear that all of As'arem would pay homage at Umberlee's temples once each [[tenday]] through the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.",
