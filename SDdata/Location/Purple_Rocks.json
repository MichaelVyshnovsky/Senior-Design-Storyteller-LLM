        "mainbody": "The '''Purple Rocks''' were an archipelago in the [[Trackless Sea]] located west of Gundarlin beyond the warm water of [[The River]].  They appeared as rocky outcroppings, but verdant valleys were sheltered from the storms behind their sparse forested peaks.",
        "Description": "Under stormy skies, the islands acquired a dark, purplish hue. It was this feature they were named for.",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[dragon]] [[Galadaeros]] considered the Purple Rocks its territory, and it was believed that [[Flamehome Isle]], as he called its lair, was actually one of these two islands.{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Galadaeros, \"Sunset Flame\"}}",
        "Islands": "* [[Trisk]] (western)\n* [[Utheraal]] (eastern)",
        "Climate": "The Purple Rocks, along with [[Tuern]], [[Gundarlun Island|Gundarlun]] and [[Ruathym]], live at the mercy of far harsher sea storms than those on the mainland, and have a winter spanning nearly eight months a year. The ''[[Auril]]sbreath'' (as the islanders called the bitter and constant winter winds), froze everything not built on the lee side of the islands. When not frozen by the ''Aurilsbreath'', the islands were shrouded in a dense fog that lasted through the day, and its summers were even cooler than subarctic ones.",
        "Society": "Here, like in rural communities all over [[the North]] and other outer islands like [[Tuern]], magic use was punishable by death. People of the Purple Rocks appeared to worship [[Tempus]] (called ''Tempos''), [[Auril]] and [[Umberlee]], the usual Northman deities, but their idols of those gods all showed many tentacle-like arms.\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the people of Utheraal and Trisk were dominated by the [[kraken]] [[Slarkrethel]].",
        "History": "The Rocklanders, or the people of the Purple Rocks, were originally a colony from [[Gundarlun Island]]. Later, both the western island Trisk and its eastern neighbor Utheraal grew into independent island-nations, with the later paying Trisk a steep sum of gold to avoid war. This situation ended abruptly in the [[1368 DR]], when the [[longship]]s of King [[Selger]] landed upon the shores of Utheraal and the battle for control of Vilkstead took place, resulting in the deaths of King [[Bromm]] and 200 of the island's best warriors.",

                "Ulf of Thuger": ":The capital city of the nation of Trisk. Its inhabitants fished and farmed barely enough to put food in their mouths, and additional needs were satisfied by piracy on other Northmen and pirate ships. Their main activity was recording and cataloging the flux of information that filtered into the island through the [[Kraken Society]] spy network. In [[1361 DR]], King [[Selger]] dwelt here as the nominal ruler of Trisk."

                "Vilkstead": ":With richer fishing water than its neighbor, the throne city of Utheraal had enough catches to satisfy its own needs and make a living by exporting large amounts of dried, smoked, [[salt]]ed, and pickled fish to [[Gundarlun Island|Gundarlun]], which in turn shipped it to cities all across [[Faer√ªn]]. It also produced a pungent, salty, herbal goat cheese called [[Vilksmaarg]], popular in [[Sword Coast]] taverns."

                "Ascarle": ":''The Sunken City'' was an underwater elven city as large as [[Waterdeep]]. Destroyed by the [[drow]], it lay in ruins off of Trisk's northern shore, where it was used by [[Slarkrethel]] as headquarters for the [[Kraken Society]]."
