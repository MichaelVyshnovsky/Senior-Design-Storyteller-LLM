        "mainbody": "Anaxadren was one of the Six Holy Cities of the ixitxachitl nation in the Sea of Fallen Stars known as the Xedran Reefs.\nLike all of the chitl cities, Orilidren consisted of a huge warren of tunnels and subcaverns. This included a central entrance to the surface, with passages riddled in traps, and large cavern beneath that site with a great temple to Ilxendren around which the rest of the city grew outward from.\nThere stood an outbuilding near the temple for the Devitans personal slaves, at least four caverns on the outskirts of the city in which other slaves were kept, two military garrisons, and at least four public shrines on the city outskirts that were dedicated to Ilxendren.\nAnaxadren was located in the western reaches of the Xedran Reefs, standing to the east of the Haunted Plains and the ixitxachitl village of Ilsaadya.\nAround the 14 century DR this city was led by Devitan Ersaqav.\nAround , the Twelfth Ser√¥s War raged across the Sea of Fallen Stars. During this period Anaxadren faced minor attacks by the sahuagin forces of Iakhovas, but these were easily repulsed. The city went largely unaffected by the Twelfth War, due to it being located far from the fields of conflict. Following the Twelfth War, the ixitxachitl that inhabited the city were gripped with a wave of religious passion."
