The '''Shrieking Chasm''' was a seemingly bottomless chasm located beneath the [[Howling Mountains]] in [[Relmaur]], [[Laerakond]].

==Background==
The sounds that emerged from the chasm were so terrible that many believed the Shrieking Chasm was the prison of a mad [[primordial]] who betrayed its kin to the [[gods]] during the [[Dawn War]]. The inhabitants of Relmaur preferred to avoid the chasm for that reason.
