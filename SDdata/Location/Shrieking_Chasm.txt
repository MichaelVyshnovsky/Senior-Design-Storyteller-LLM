The Shrieking Chasm was a seemingly bottomless chasm located beneath the Howling Mountains in Relmaur, Laerakond.
The sounds that emerged from the chasm were so terrible that many believed the Shrieking Chasm was the prison of a mad primordial who betrayed its kin to the gods during the Dawn War. The inhabitants of Relmaur preferred to avoid the chasm for that reason.
