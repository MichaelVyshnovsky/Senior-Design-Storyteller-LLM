        "mainbody": "Hilltop was a tiny village nestled in the southern foothills of the Nether Mountains in the Silver Marches in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe trail to Hilltop branched off the trail between Everlund and Sundabar, between Lhuvenhead and Jalanthar, which were the nearest communities. To the east of Hilltop was the village of Blumberg and far to the west, down the River Rauvin was Everlund. It was described as a very inhospitable land due to its cold climate and potential hazards, such as roaming monsters around the area.\nThe area was governed by the elected mayor, Veraunt Shuttlescomb, around the early 1370s DR. Although falling within the boundary of Luruar, it was not one of the signatories of the League of the Silver Marches, being too small.\nThe so-called Free Towns of Hilltop, Newfort, Winter Edge, and others were founded by ex-soldiers of Zhentil Keep whod retired in disgust and wished a new life. However, being distrusted by neighboring towns for their origins, they made their own settlements such as these.\nIn a particularly cold Kythorn of the , Hilltop was attacked by a large group of kobolds. Casualties were relatively light, with only a few militiamen and two civilians killed in exchange for dozens of kobold dead. Neighboring Blumberg was sacked by gnolls on the same day as the Hilltop kobold attack. Drogan Droganson, however, the one who could likely do the most to repair the damage to the village, was poisoned in the attack and incapacitated, leaving his eldest apprentice to try and solve everyones problems. This apprentice would go on to do great things like destroying the Netherese flying city of Undrentide and defeating the Valsharess and Mephistopheles.\nHilltop won second place in the \"Communities in Bloom\" competition, losing to Blumberg. It is unknown if there were any other entrants.\nThe main point of interest was Drogan Drogansons adventuring school.\nWhilst the town was not of notable size, Drogans school accommodated many adventurer students in its time including Xanos Messarmos, Mischa Waymeet and Dorna Trapspringer, and the one known as Drogan Drogansons pupil.\nMerchants in the town included the tavernmaster Lodar and his chef Mara, the blacksmith Fiona, and herbalist Farghan. The local priest, Gilford, also provided his services to the town.\nHol Halstrom lived in the village before his corpse was found and his death linked to a self-proclaimed prophet Piper."
