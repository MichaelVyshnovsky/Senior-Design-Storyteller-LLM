        "Description": "Athanar was an [[aarakocra]] [[spelljamming]] port. Like all land masses within the atmosphere of Coliar, Athanar was a floating island, one of many thousands.\n\nThe port contained several structures. A stream flowed through the town and poured off the edge to fall to unfathomable depths.",
        "Government": "[[File:Athanar Congress Building Interior-PoR.png|thumb|right|''An [[aarakocra]] sits at a desk in the Congress building of Athanar.'']]\nThe aarakocra of Coliar maintained democractic governments. On Athanar, that government's business was centralized at the Congress building.",
        "Trade": "Athanar charged a moorage fee of 125 [[gold piece]]s and an exorbitant air tax of 200 gold pieces. An additional cargo tax was also charged, which was based on the amount of cargo being carried by mooring [[spelljammer]]s.",
        "Religion": "[[File:Shrine of Syranita Interior-PoR.png|thumb|right|''A shrine to [[Syranita]] on Athanar.'']]\nThe islanders of Athanar were known to revere the god [[Syranita]], and the port contained at least one shrine dedicated to her.",
