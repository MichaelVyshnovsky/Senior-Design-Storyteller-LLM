The '''Realm of Bleeding Trees''' was found between the cites of [[Ajayib]] and [[Gana]] in the [[Pearl Cities]] region of [[west Zakhara]].

==Geography==
The Realm of Bleeding Trees hugged the curving coastline at the southern edge of the [[High Desert]], beginning north of [[Al-Malja River]].

==Description==
This barren wasteland would be good for little else were it not for the [[wikipedia:frankincense|frankincense]] trees found here.<ref name=LoF.AGtZ-p88">

==Activities==
Members of the [[House of Dubb]] collected prized aromatic gums from the trees here to trade with the residents of Ajayib.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p38">
