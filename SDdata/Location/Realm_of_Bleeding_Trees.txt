The Realm of Bleeding Trees was found between the cites of Ajayib and Gana in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara.
The Realm of Bleeding Trees hugged the curving coastline at the southern edge of the High Desert, beginning north of Al-Malja River.
This barren wasteland would be good for little else were it not for the frankincense trees found here.
Members of the House of Dubb collected prized aromatic gums from the trees here to trade with the residents of Ajayib.
