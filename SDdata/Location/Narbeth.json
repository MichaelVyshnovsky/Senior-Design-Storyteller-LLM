        "mainbody": "arbeth was a realm of gold elves that occupied the northeast edge of the Shalhoond in southern Taan circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nNarbeth claimed the edge of the Shalhoond forest east of Khopet-Dag (aka the Spiderhaunt Peaks)See this discussion for the consensus on locations being placed in east Faer√ªn, the Hordelands, and Kara-Tur.\nThis realm was a kingdom long ruled by House Raryndur. As of 1370 DR, the ruler was Great King Aumanas Raryndur.\nThe elves of Narbeth had very little contact with the world outside their borders, except when protecting those borders.\nThe Narbathans were not as haughty as most of their high elf kin. Although somewhat reclusive, they had a broader sense of humor and were content in their idyllic home. Their favorite pursuit was hunting on foot in the forest, often led by the Great King. They made (and enjoyed) a strong wine from berries found in the forest.\nThe throne of Narbeth was held by House Raryndur for millennia. As of 1372 DR, there were no other serious contenders for the throne since a conflict with House Oumryn resulted in the apparent elimination of the Oumryndar sometime in the distant past.\nBecause of the speed at which they can move through the forest in pursuit of prey, some sages claim the people of Narbeth can dimension door at will. The abundance of monsters in the Shalhoond, coupled with the Narbathan love of hunting, has led to rumors of deepspawn inhabiting the forest and the conjecture that the Narbathans put them there in order to have an endless supply of game."
