'''Tanistan Barony''' was a part of the monarchy of [[Erlkazar]] encompassing the [[Plains of Pehrrifaal]].

==Description==
This barony was responsible for the defense of the country's southern borders. It had four small [[human]] villages and also some non[[human]] ones in the mountains. In fact, the barony had an alliance with the [[Shieldbreaker Ogres]] in the region, in order to maintain peace with other monstrous races living in the [[High Peaks]].

==Geography==
Located in the southwest corner of Erlkazar, Tanistan was bordered by the [[Omlarandin Mountains]] on the west, the [[Kuldin Peaks]] on the north, and the High Peaks of the [[Cloven Mountains]] on the east. It shared borders with baronies [[Carrelath]], [[Shalanar]], and [[Ahlarkhem]].

The Plains of Pehrrifaal, named after a local warrior, took up most of the land of this region. [[Barley]], millet, and [[grape]]s were grown here. The foothills of the Omlarandins and the High Peaks were lightly forested, and the scouts followed [[Elf|elven]] practices of using trees as lookout towers.

==Government==
In [[1370 DR]], the barony was ruled by a [[Half-elf|half-elven]] woman named [[Laxaella Bronshield]]. She kept busy maintaining the borders not just of her own barony but those of neighboring Ahlarkhem as well. Her estate manor in [[Five Spears Hold]] was called [[Praskallest]] and was used as an army garrison.

==Notable Locations==
; Five Spears Hold : This mining town was the third largest settlement in Erlkazar and also a garrison for the army.
; [[Pehrrifaal Garrisons]] : These four keeps along the southern border also served as temples for one of the four gods [[Helm]], [[Tempus]], [[Torm]], and [[Tyr]].
; Praskallest : The baroness' manor was the former estate of the Count of [[Carrelath]] in the days when Erlkazar was a territory of [[Tethyr]].
; [[Rivernshield]] : This [[ogre]] village was the home of Tanistan's allies, the Shieldbreaker Ogres.

==Plots & Rumors==
In 1370 DR, the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]] had a double agent hidden among the scouts of one of the army garrisons. He was trying to gain the favor of the baroness in order to sell information to [[Mintar]].
