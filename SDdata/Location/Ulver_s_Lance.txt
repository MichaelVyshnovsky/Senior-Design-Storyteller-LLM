Ulvers Lance was a quiet little town in Turmish in the Vilhon Reach.
It stood in central Turmish, on a trail between Xorhun and Quorngar.
Quaint little village, Ulvers Lances main industry was cart-building and woodcarving.
The namesake of Ulvers Lance was a hero named Ulver who kept the Halondar safe from bugbears, orcs, goblins, and other monsters who raided merchant caravans in the nations early years.
In the late-14 century DR, inhabitants of Ulvers Lance cared little of the old hero. Instead, they cared about an unknown thief plaguing the town. That individual visited sleeping villages and took just a few coins each time. The locals thought the thief had some magical means of making folk fall asleep or even ways of moving through solid walls. Circa 1360 DR, a local woodsman claimed to have fallen into a cellar of a burned down house at Lances edge. He discovered numerous boxes, chests, and urns filled with the towns stolen coins. The woodcutter bragged about the find at a tavern and spent looted coin generously. The next morning, his decapitated corpse was discovered in a secluded alley. Townsfolk tried to claim the said treasure but discovered the burnt-out houses cellars empty. The treasures fate was unknown however, coin thefts continued.
Shrines to Silvanus, the Forest Father, and to Tyr, the Even-Handed, could be found in the town.
