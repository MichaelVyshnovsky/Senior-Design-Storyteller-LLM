        "Description": "The Grand Duchy's territories laid in a wide-open calm valley of endless farmlands, numerous winding roads, all sprinkled with outcroppings of tiny forests. The Duchy ended to the east at sporadically forested hills. Uncharacteristically for the Border Kingdoms, the Grand Duchy of Shanta was a land of visual and architectural order, and authority. The village of Shantal stood at the very center of the farmlands, with the [[Duchal Towers]] looming over town's cottages and homes all surrounding the Towers in an orderly circle. Shantal was surrounded by roads, orchards, and vegetable gardens. Each cottage had its own plot of lush green fertile land, arranged akin to spokes of a wheel.",

        "Defenses": "The township of Shantal was constantly protected by patrolling [[horse]]back [[Vigilant Bailiffs]], a group of experienced [[warrior]]s carrying [[sword]]s, [[javelin]]s, [[crossbow]]s, and [[nets]]. However, even without Vigilants, local folk all appeared to be strong and professionally armed, and, in fact, they were retired warriors themselves.\n\nAll visiting [[arcane]] spellcasters traveled land with Vigilant Bailiffs escorts and there are no [[cleric]]s or [[wizard]]s among the inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Shantal.",
        "History": "The Grand Duchy of Shantal was a relatively young territory of the Border Kingdoms, established only three generations before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. [[Pelindar Slendyn]] was the unwitting founder of the Duchy. Pelindar served the [[archmage]] named [[Arcanauh]] who perished in a dazzling magical duel that also took the life of the mage's bitter rival â€“ [[Thayan]] [[sorceress]] [[Ithcatra Llumen]], and raised Pelindar's [[Red Tower]]. The township of Shantal was built where the Red Tower once stood and now Duke Pelindar outlawed all magic in the Grand Duchy.\n\nPelindar's son, [[Thaerin Slendyn]], was the next to take the reins of rulership and he continued anti-magical laws instated by his father. The magic duel left behind a legacy of unique after-effects that attracted spellcasters to the Grand Duchy. The Grand Duke who reigned in the late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Orsarr Slendyn]], saw the need in establishing the office of [[Official Mage]] to deal with curious spellcasters still being attracted to the site of great wizardly battle. Orsarr Slendyn was a reluctant leader who retired from his adventuring days following the death of his father.",
