        "mainbody": "The Grand Duchy of Shanta was the so-called Heart of the Border Kingdoms, named as after its position in the center of the western Border Kingdoms and renowned for its natural beauty and eccentric politics.\nThe Grand Duchys territories laid in a wide-open calm valley of endless farmlands, numerous winding roads, all sprinkled with outcroppings of tiny forests. The Duchy ended to the east at sporadically forested hills. Uncharacteristically for the Border Kingdoms, the Grand Duchy of Shanta was a land of visual and architectural order, and authority. The village of Shantal stood at the very center of the farmlands, with the Duchal Towers looming over towns cottages and homes all surrounding the Towers in an orderly circle. Shantal was surrounded by roads, orchards, and vegetable gardens. Each cottage had its own plot of lush green fertile land, arranged akin to spokes of a wheel.\nThe township of Shantal was constantly protected by patrolling horseback Vigilant Bailiffs, a group of experienced warriors carrying swords, javelins, crossbows, and nets. However, even without Vigilants, local folk all appeared to be strong and professionally armed, and, in fact, they were retired warriors themselves.\nAll visiting arcane spellcasters traveled land with Vigilant Bailiffs escorts and there are no clerics or wizards among the inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Shantal.\nThe Grand Duchy of Shantal was a relatively young territory of the Border Kingdoms, established only three generations before the late 14 century DR. Pelindar Slendyn was the unwitting founder of the Duchy. Pelindar served the archmage named Arcanauh who perished in a dazzling magical duel that also took the life of the mages bitter rival â€“ Thayan sorceress Ithcatra Llumen, and raised Pelindars Red Tower. The township of Shantal was built where the Red Tower once stood and now Duke Pelindar outlawed all magic in the Grand Duchy.\nPelindars son, Thaerin Slendyn, was the next to take the reins of rulership and he continued anti-magical laws instated by his father. The magic duel left behind a legacy of unique after-effects that attracted spellcasters to the Grand Duchy. The Grand Duke who reigned in the late 14 century DR, Orsarr Slendyn, saw the need in establishing the office of Official Mage to deal with curious spellcasters still being attracted to the site of great wizardly battle. Orsarr Slendyn was a reluctant leader who retired from his adventuring days following the death of his father."
