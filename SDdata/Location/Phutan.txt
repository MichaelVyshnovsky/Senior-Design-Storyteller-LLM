'''Phutan''' was a small kingdom in [[Kara-Tur]], neighboring [[Tabot]]. Its capital city was '''Bhutan'''.{{Cite interactive atlas|?}}<ref group="note">The place is called only "Phutan" in ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' Volume I, but only "Bhutan" appears on all maps of the region. While this could be an error or variation in spelling, there is no actual contradiction: the maps specifically label the city as "Bhutan", not the country.

==Geography==
Phutan occupied a wedge of land between the [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]] to the north and the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]] to the southwest. To the southeast was the border with Tabot, leaving it quite locked in.

==Relations==
The [[monk]]s of Tabot, no friends to Phutan, saw it as lawless land that gave sanctuary to outlaws from Tabot, [[T'u Lung]], and [[Shou Lung]], and that its "heathen king" decreed lamas and holy men be killed on sight. There were constant conflicts between the Phutanese and the Tabotans at [[Hoshki Gompa]] and [[Buchan Do Gompa]] over the border.

==History==
===Prehistory===
[[File:Tabotan moon woman and tiger men.jpg|thumb|250px|''The moon woman transforming white tigers into men.'']]
Phutan shared its early past with Tabot. Originally, the land was the domain of barbarian kings and tribal chiefs with their own noble class. They built cities in the lowlands and followed a heathen faith. In their founding myth, millennia previously, the [[moon]] descended to the earth one night in the form of a beautiful woman. As she wandered through the night, all the white [[tiger]]s of the land gathered at her side and were entranced by her. She touched her hand to the foreheads of nineteen of them and they were transformed into human men of strength and intelligence. After the moon women returned to the sky, the new men performed heroic deeds and founded the various clans. One of these clans founded Phutan, the others the various kingdoms of Tabot.

But unlike Tabot, Phutan seems never to have been occupied by the exiled [[Shou]] monks and their monasteries between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, nor to have fallen under the sway of the High Lord of Oceans in {{YearlinkConvert|2318|SY}}.The history of Phutan and its split from Tabot is unknown, but its lack of religious sites on the map, different faith, and conflicts suggest this account.

===Modern History===
In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Buchan Do lamas reported a Phutanese army assembling at the border. Tabot went on a war footing, mustering soldiers in the area and ordering conscription in a few towns, hiring mercenaries, and accepting volunteers from among the temple guards.<ref name="KT77" >
