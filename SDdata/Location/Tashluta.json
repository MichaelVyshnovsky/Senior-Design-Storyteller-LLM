The welcoming disposition of the majority of Tashlutans was complemented by their propensity for being multi-lingual. A common source of amusement for Tashlutans was to play lighthearted pranks upon the many people that visited their city, often involving some of their particularly spicy foods.\nAs a result of the circumstances around Tashalars founding and its conflict with the yuan-ti many residents of the capital had a distinct phobia of snakes and serpents. Nearly every type reptile found in the city were killed on sight.\nThe capital was located situated in the center of the Tashtan Coast within the fertile stretch of land known as the Tashalar Basin,\nTashluta was built atop the ridge and inner slope of a volcanic caldera, called the Tashalar Basin, that was partially flooded by the waters of the Shining Sea. The volcanic crater formed a natural harbor for the citys fleet of ships.\nThe narrow isle of Stormwall extended out from the sea at the edge of the harbor, shielding the bay from storms coming landward from the sea.\nSince its founding, Tashluta has been ruled by an oligarchy.\nTashluta was the home of the expansive trade consortium known as the Rundeen.

After gaining their independence, in the , Tashlutas oligarchs banded together and formed the Confederation of Tashtan, a declaration that outlined the lands over which the free nation would have dominion.\nIn the , Tashluta and the other Tashalan cities came under control of the Shoon Imperium shortly after the empire completely destroyed the belligerent Lapaliiyan city of Untisczer. The occupation of the city lasted for over 150 years, until the Shoon viceroy of Tashluta and his wife were slain during the collapse of the empire. After the initial military campaign, many of the citys residents left their home for other lands such as the Sanrach Basin in Thindol.\nDespite their great victory against the yuan-ti centuries before,\nFortresses\n* Murder Hall, an abandoned castle that was taken over by Dark Cleric Othorgor and his fellow devotees of Bhaal.\n* Stormwall Keep, the broad naval fortress that was built atop Stormwall Isle.\nTemples \n* House of Nights Embrace, the most distinguished temple of Talona in all the Realms.\n* House of the All-Seeing Orb, a temple of Savras that was considered one of the most well-regarded of its kind during the 14 century DR."
