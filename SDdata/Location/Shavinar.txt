'''Shavinar''' was a short-lived realm located on the [[Sword Coast]], founded to defend against [[troll]] attacks, only to be destroyed by those trolls.
==Geography==
At it's largest, Shavinar was bordered by the [[River Chionthar]] in the south and the [[Troll Hills]] in the north. It's eastern border was eighty to a hundred miles inland from the coast.

==Government==
Shavinar was an absolute monarchy, though the nation's first monarch did not style himself as such. The rulers of Shavinar were largely hands-off leaders, either devoting themselves to the defense of the Realm, or to self-indulgence. Citizens paid taxes (if they bothered to register), but many obeyed laws only when directly under observation by law enforcement.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-03-26 - Baldur's Gate History}}

==Trade==
Noted trade in Shavinar appeared to largely take place with pirates, smugglers and unscrupulous merchants from [[Calimshan]] and [[Tashalar]] via the realm's port on the Chionthar.

==Defenses==
Although several hillforts were built and manned to protect the realm early in it's history, they were swiftly abandoned due to incompetence and greed.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|227}}, an intelligent and mighty adventuring warrior named [[Orluth Tshahvur]] attempted to unite the farms and ranches near the mouth of the River Chionthar in a mutual defense agreement to protect them against roaming monsters, frequent raids by trolls coming from the north and outlaws coming from the south. Tshahvur built a keep, that would come to be called [[Gaeth]], near a fishing village (that would later grow to become [[Baldur's Gate]]), and recruited a shipwright, fleeing persecution in Calimshan, to build him a fleet of ships. That nearby fishing village soon became a free port and a haven for pirates and smugglers.

Orluth fought what seemed like constant battles against trolls for the rest of his life, but also established many defensive hillforts that watched over and guarded all of the territory between the Troll Hills and the north bank of the River Chionthar, up to four days ride inland from the coast, establishing the recognized borders of Shavinar.

Lord Tshahvur died in the {{YearlinkName|242}}, leaving his son, [[Arlsar Tshahvur|Arlsar]], to rule over the realm. Arlsar pronounced himself King of Shavinar, abandoning his father's title of Lord and proceeded to also abandon most of the realm's hillforts, refusing to train or hire new warriors to replace those who fell in battle. King Arlsar preferred to spend the money he saved by doing this on women, siring numerous bastards as a result. All the while attacks from trolls and outlaws saw Shavinar shrink to an area of only forty miles wide.

Criminal [[Calishite]] and [[Tashalan]] merchants murdered King Arlsar in the {{YearlinkName|256}} and a power struggle ensued, as numerous power brokers tried to install one of the king's many children as the realm's new ruler, murdering those in their way. During this time, the longest-lived King of Shavinar was the handsome and charming [[Raulovan Tshahvur]], who managed to remain in power for four whole months.

Eventually, a local [[wizard]], tired of all of the strife, used magic to kill every single one of the power brokers, and all but one of Arlsar's heirs, the youngest son, [[Kondarar Tshahvur|Kondarar]]. King Kondarar, like his grandfather, was a powerful warrior, and spent most of the rest of his life battling monsters.

However, in the {{YearlinkName|277}}, troll attacks overwhelmed the nation and destroyed it.
