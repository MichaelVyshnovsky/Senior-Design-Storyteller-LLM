'''Keczulla''' (pronounced "ZUH-lah" by the locals, ''not'' "KEK-zuh-lah") was a settlement located in [[Amn]] and to the northeast of [[Esmeltaran]].

{{quote|''There is only one deity worshiped in Keczulla&mdash;[[Tymora]], who grants wealth to the lucky&hellip; You've never heard of Keczulla? Well, it's a town governed by greed. The gem mines lie at the center of all theological and political activities within the town.''|[[Raegen Brunegar]]}}

==Description==
The city of Keczulla was a prosperous city that was the home of diverse and rich mining industry. The town stood on the the [[Eshpurta Road]], to the east from [[Amnwater]] and west of [[Eshpurta]].

The city was separated into four districts and eight wards. The Emerald District housed the Mithral & Platinum Wards; Sapphire District held the Gold & Electrum Wards; Jade District was home to the Silver & Bronze Wards; and Agate District was where the Copper & Harbor Moon Districts could be found. The wards' and districts' status and prestige were determined by the price of their namesakes. The districts and wards were separated by stone arches with inserted keystones of gems and ingots above the districts' carved names. The arcs were always guarded, and anyone defacing them or removing the keystones was executed with prejudice.

Keczulla was known for the blistering sun heat that reached its peak in highsun, especially harshly felt during the markets.

Even though Keczulla was a town of wealth, its streets had their share of poverty. Merchant families of the town generously financed orphanages for the city's parentless children as a way to show off their wealth and status. However, many of the kids stayed untamed by civilization, turning to feral existence.

==Government==
The Keczulla was ruled by a Council of Elders, representatives of the richest and most influential families in the city. The managerial duties were handled by [[Tarkas Thallavv]] the Gemayor ''circa'' [[1370 DR]]. He controlled the accounting, managed the city's needs, and was the public face of the government. However, the true leader was Lady [[Lhynvor Tanislove]], who held the most power and respect in the city. She did support Tarkas's management and recognized his skill.

==Trade==
[[File:Amn map.jpg|thumb|''A map of Keczulla and the surrounding area.''|420x420px]]
Keczulla's gem mines were at the center of the town's culture, religion, and trade. The town's production of a significant number of precious stones and [[gem]]s led to the Elders commissioning a unit dedicated exclusively to protecting the town's livelihood&mdash;Keczulla's [[Gem Guard]].

Apart from gem mining, Keczulla had [[electrum]] mines outside of the city, [[iron]] mines, [[salt]] mines, among many others.

Other businesses flourished in Keczulla. The city was flush with inns, taverns, shots, craftsmen, wainwrights, and mercenaries.

==Defenses==
Apart from the [[Gem Guard]], the city had a garrison of 1000 able-bodied defenders, with 200 of them being trained cavaliers. Keczulla's troopers were charged with keeping the Eshpurta Road safe on the stretch between Amnwater and halfway to the town of Eshpurta.

The Gem Guard was tasked with defending the city's mines and act as the guard within Keczulla's walls. The Guard numbered around 500 members. The leader of the Guard was the Jewelieutenant and the squares were helmed by Captains.

==History==
[[File:Keczulla.jpg|thumb|''A gem merchant from Keczulla appraising a glittering specimen.''|400x400px]]
The city was founded in [[575 DR]], as a minor mining town during the gold rush that swept Amn. The wealthy [[Keczull]] family were the driving force behind the settlement of the land.

Keczulla had existed as a mining town until the mineral vein that fueled the community was exhausted in [[755 DR]]. With the death of the mining industry, the town started shrinking, eventually becoming virtually deserted.

Keczulla was resettled in [[1242 DR]] who cleared the site off of [[troll]]s and other monstrous creatures. The town became a traveling and caravan stop for those who traversed the [[Eshpurta Road]].

The rejuvenated mining city blossomed, swelling with a population that reached 42,000 soils by [[1357 DR]]. The town's reputation was reinforced by regular "dirt to [[diamond]]s" stories that emerged from Keczulla every year to so.


In [[1345 DR]], Tessurch [[Quorl Vemmil]] of Amn attempted to wrestle power from the [[Meisarch]], the leader of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]]. Quorl instrumented a deadly [[consumption]] (an angry mob, tipped off by the Meisarch's agents).

In [[1355 DR]], a local Keczullan merchant [[Pulth Tanislove]] purchased a set of papers from heirs of a recently passed hermit who lived on the edges of town. The merchant discovered research on a long-lost gem mine and eventually found its location. By [[1357 DR]], he was the owner of a rich [[ruby]] mine and used his new wealth to buy land on the [[Ridge]] north of Keczulla, where he discovered even more rich gem veins. This mining company, the [[Tanislove Mines]], was the largest and the most prosperous mining organization in Amn.

''Circa'' 1357 DR, a merchant from Keczulla, [[Andruth Pearlseeker]], accidentally created a fad among Amnian nobles. Andruth's shipment of [[egg]]s got delayed, allowing the half hatch into strange small blue flightless [[bird]]s. The merchant quickly found demand for the animals among the upper echelons of Amnian society. Andruth made a fortune, selling every bird out of 23,000 for 150 [[danter]]s each.

In [[1366 DR]], the [[Gem Road]] that connected Keczulla and [[Esmeltaran]] was completed with the funding from the Council of Six and Lord [[Pulth Tanislove]].

By [[1370 DR]], Amnian families exiled from [[Tethyr]] for their kin's crimes, settled in the cities of Esmeltaran, Keczulla, and Eshpurta.

==Rumors & Legends==
One unnamed mining company, among many in Keczulla, was rumored to have discovered a vein of [[adamantine]] and secretly transported the metal to [[Athkatla]].
