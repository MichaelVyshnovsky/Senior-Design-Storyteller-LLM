        "mainbody": "alanzia was a dead city in Tu Lung.\nFounded in 422 DR, Balanzia was once one of the largest cities in all Kara-Tur, thanks to its easy access to Zastrasai Bay and the Straits of Vashung, as well as its great sea wall and its magnificent towers. However, in 1118 DR, a wandering wise man named Loarru the Just came to Balanzia, advising that the city would fall, but nobody listened. However, during the invasions by Shou Lung forces, the walls were weakened step by step until in 1153 DR the great Shou wu jen Moia Chun opened the final hole in the wall. The people went insane with fear and in less than a month the city became deserted."
