Calling themselves the [[Seven Satraps]], they raised a small army and with it held the city of Schamedar under siege for nearly a year, until they were finally able to drive the Cult out of the city and into hiding.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Era of Skyfire]], the [[Calim Desert]] expanded so far east that its sands encompassed the plains until the River."
