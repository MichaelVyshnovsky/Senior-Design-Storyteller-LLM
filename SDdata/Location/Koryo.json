        "mainbody": "Formerly known as '''Choson''', the '''Empire of Koryo''', commonly known simply as '''Koryo''', was an association of three kingdoms—[[Silla]], [[Koguryo]], and [[Saishu]]—on the southern end of the [[Koryo Peninsula]] in [[Northeast Kara-Tur|northeast]] [[Kara-Tur]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were home to the [[Koryoan]] people, a proud, exuberant, and fearless folk who were keenly defensively minded.{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|63}}",
        "Names & Etymology": "The land was formerly known as \"Choson\", a name that translated to \"morning calm\". After King Wanang Sun reformed the Sillan Empire into the Empire of Koryo, the land became known as simply \"Koryo\".Like many sites in Koryo, Choson and Koryo share names with real-world counterparts in [[Wikipedia:Names of Korea|Korea]]. \"Choson\" comes from [[Wikipedia:Joseon|Joseon]] (also written \"Chosŏn\"), the name of a medieval Korean kingdom, and still the Korean name for [[Wikipedia:North Korea|North Korea]]. A translation of \"Joseon\" can yield \"morning calm\", giving rise to an English nickname, \"The Land of the Morning Calm\". Similarly, \"Koryo\" comes from [[Wikipedia:Goryeo|Goryeo]] (also written \"Koryŏ\"), the name of another medieval Korean kingdom, from which the English name \"Korea\" ultimately derives.<ref group=\"note\">It is unknown where the name \"Koryo\" comes from within the setting. It may come from the subkingdom of [[Koguryo]] (itself named for the real-world [[Wikipedia:Goguryeo|Goguryeo]] (also written \"Koguryŏ\", from which Goryeo was named) or from the [[Koryo Peninsula]] named in ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'', pages 13 and 19. The Koryo Peninsula appears to share a name, but not a geographic connection, with the [[Koryaz Mountains]] in greater Kara-Tur.",
        "Language": "Koryoans spoke the [[Koryo language]],{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} which descended from the ancient [[Han language]], with many loanwords from [[Wa-an language|Wa-an]] and [[Kao te Shou]] borrowed over centuries. Owing to its similarities with other languages, it was easy to find Koryoan translators for many languages, though few learned [[Kozakuran language|Kozauran]], owing to enmity between the peoples.",
        "Environment & Geography": {
            "Climate": "Koryo was a cold, northern land. The winter months were particularly stormy and bitterly cold.",
            "Geographic Features": "[[File:Koryo KTCS map.jpg|thumb|400px|right|''A map of Koryo and the provinces of Saishu, Koguryo, and Silla, depicting their mountains, islands, and forests.'']]\n;Mountains\n: [[Vorkani Mountains]] • [[Wei Do Peak]] • [[Zigero Range]]\n;Bays\n: [[E'Tyon Bay]] • [[Kang Bay]] • [[Mo'ki Bay]]\n;Seas\n: [[The flaming seas]] • [[Straits of Koryo]] • [[Dragon's Teeth]] • [[Yellow Sea]]\n;Islands\n: [[Kanko]] • [[Quelpart]] • [[Saishu]] • [[Su'un]]\n;Forests\n: [[Quang Muku Forest]]\n;Rivers\n: [[Hoparatu River]] • [[Malu River]] • [[Tumen River]]\n;Other\n: [[Dang Caverns]] • [[Koryo Peninsula]] • [[Naktong Moors]]"
        },
        "Government": {
            "Relations": "The Koryoans seemed to be always holding off and repelling Kozakuran invaders, but had launched at least one attempted invasion of Kozakura themselves under the king of Silla.The wars between Koryo and Kozakura are not mentioned at all in the Kozakuran chapter of ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'', nor in any other source to deal with Kozakura, so the cause and nature of these conflicts are unknown.\n\nKoryo's defenders also regularly beat back invasions by the wild tribes of the northern Koryo Peninsula.\n\nShou Lung made no serious attempts to expand its empire into Koryo, finding the mountainous terrain too rough and difficult, In the mid-1300s [[DR]], Shou Lung considered Koryo to be a collection of petty kingdoms that were tributary states of the empire. In Shou Lung, at least, it was said that when the emperor stamped his foot in [[Kuo Te' Lung]], the earth trembled in Koryo. Some of Shou Lung described the Koryoans as \"unlearned savages\", an attitude perhaps more telling of the Shou than of Koryo.\n\nKoryo was on peaceful terms with neighboring [[Wa]], with [[Wanese]] traders and their currency seen in [[Ansong]] and [[Tu Pe]]. Meanwhile, Koryoan merchants, sailors, workers, and dignitaries appeared in [[Nakamaru]] in Wa.",
            "Defenses": "Always guarding against invasion, Koryo was battle-ready and its defenses strong against external threats. The kingdom's fleet was based out of the fortress at [[Quelpart]], off the coast of Tu Pe. The city itself was particularly well-defended, and could muster sizeable armies without resorting to conscription. Mounted forces patrolled the coasts on the lookout for invaders."
        },
        "Economy": "The Koryoans adopted the Shou Lung model for currency, using the [[copper]] [[fen]] and [[yuan]], the [[paper]] [[ch'ao]], and the [[silver]] [[tael]] and [[ch'ien]]. In exchange rates, Koryoan currency was worth half the amount of Shou currency, but was equal to Wa's currency. The coin of Kozakura was not even treated as legal tender.",
        "People": "[[File:Crow Dz Pong.jpg|thumb|right|''The Koryoan wu jen and pirate [[Crow Dz Pong]] running across the waves at a ship.'']]\nThe [[Koryoan]] people tended to have black hair and high cheekbones, and had moderate heights and builds; they most closely resembled the people of [[Chukei]] province in northern [[Shou Lung]]. They were sometimes nicknamed \"Cold Koryoans\".\n\nThey were a proud folk, known to be fearless in a fight and exuberant in a celebration. However, the people were molded by a history of war and invasion and of living under threats of such. They were always alert, but tended toward xenophobia, preferring to trust a fellow Koryoan over a stranger. It wasn't unknown for one to wrongly blame a foreigner for some crime, rather than suspect or doubt one of their own people.",
        "Culture": {
            "Religion": "Koryo lay within the sphere of godly influence of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy of Kara-Tur]], and so fell within the dominion of the [[Celestial Emperor]] and the [[Nine Immortals]]. As a result, the [[Spirit World]] was present in Koryo, and replaced the [[Astral Plane]] there. A spirit representative of the Celestial Empire would appear beside King Wanang Sun to consecrate his rule under their guidance in the annual ceremony on [[Wei Do Peak]]. Numerous local spirits were found within Koryo, such as the [[Cosalla Huin To]] in the [[Quang Muku Forest]] and the frightful spirits of the deep pits of [[Dang Caverns]].\n\nThere were also some itinerant shukenja of [[the Way]], such as the holy man [[Korax (shukenja)|Korax]] of [[Manchar]].",
            "Classes": "[[File:Xithiaz Jui.jpg|thumb|right|''The wu jen [[Xithiaz Jui]] transforming into a bird and taking off.'']]\nKoryoan adventurers were often [[fighter]]s.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Eastern Classes}} Koryo was also home to [[wu jen]]{{Cite dragon/404/Class Acts: Runepriest: Shan Zi of Kara-Tur|2}}\n\nThere were also a number of [[ninja]]. They trained at certain do jang (martial arts schools) that taught ninja techniques and were shunned and considered dishonorable by the wider community. These ninja gathered into brotherhoods, sometimes called \"night brotherhoods\" or \"nameless ones\". Parents used them as boogeymen to get their children to behave. They engaged in theft, assassination, and kidnapping, and battled each other over dark secrets, leaving their bodies in the streets. They were whispered to have strange powers, to climb like a spider or be unable to feel heat or cold, and they used [[green sleeping dust|sleep powders]] to knock out their targets. There were many different night brotherhoods in Koryo, like the [[Soretyo]], the [[Vi'oontu]], and the [[Panthers of Xi]].\n\nSome Koryoans could follow the paths of the [[bear warrior]], [[blade dancer (Oriental Adventurers)|blade dancer]], [[henshin mystic]], [[ninja spy]], [[shapeshifter]], [[shintao monk]], [[tattooed monk]], [[weapon master]], [[witch hunter]], or [[yakuza]]."

        "History": {
            "Prehistory": "Legend told that after the creation of the land of Kara-Tur, the gods themselves handed down the [[Han language]] to the [[Han people]].\n\nHan magicians crafted a number of legendary vessels of power, each of which would play an important role in later Koryoan history. The ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'' were ten vessels that each bestowed great and strange powers to those who used them. These became separated over the centuries and some were lost. Another was the [[Hu'i Wing]], a huge brazier that granted visions of the future.\n\nThe Han people once fled invasion by the forces of [[Shou Lung]]. Much later, it was told that they'd hidden a great hoard of [[jade]] somewhere in the [[Sillan Mountains]].<ref group=\"note\">This Shou invasion could have occurred at any time after the [[First Age of Shou Lung]] in {{Yearlink|-2487}}, or more likely, the ascendancy of the first emperor in {{Yearlink|-1250}}.\n\nWhen the [[Kanko]] volcano rose up out of [[Kang Bay]] and erupted, it was said that the very skies over Koryo caught fire.Hypothetically, this eruption could have ended Han culture and civilization, as suggested by the destruction of Old Bejung. However, it is also possible that the \"Han clan\" surviving in Dang Caverns founded the subsequent Han culture.<ref group=\"note\">For simplicity, these eruptions of Kanko have been merged; the intent behind the sourcebook was likely that these were part of a single event. Nevertheless, it is possible that Kanko erupted multiple times.\n\nAn ancient civilization once stood in the [[Quang Muku Forest]], remembered only in local myths of a lost city of temples and men who stood 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ancient people lived on as forest-dwelling tribes, known to the Koryoans as savages and strange cannibals.\n\nOne branch or descendants of the Han were the Chinhan people. History recorded them as the last to hold the [[Coiled dragon (chalice)|''coiled dragon'']], the greatest of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', in around the 7{{th}} century before [[Dalereckoning]].It is unknown who the Chinhan people are, but, by context and similar name, it is assumed they are a branch or descendants of the Han people. The date can be estimated from the statement that the ''coiled dragon'' \"has been lost for 2000 years\" by the setting date of around [[1357 DR]].\n\nThe descendants of the Han people became the Koryoans, who founded the three kingdoms of Koryo. An offshoot branch of this mainland people were thought to have settled the island realms of [[Wa]] and [[Kozakura]], lying to the south of the Koryo Peninsula, in ancient times.",
            "Early history": "[[File:Wo-ha Ui-jung.jpg|thumb|right|''A Koryoan woman with three vessels of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung''.'']]\nDuring the heyday of the trade city of [[Balanzia]] ([[422 DR|422]]–[[1153 DR]]) in [[T'u Lung]] in southern Shou Lung, \"Cold Koryoans\" from the far north were regular visitors, coming to trade.\n\nIn Koryo's history, great noble houses and kingdoms have been known to be brought low by a certain love potion from the [[Quang Muku Forest]]. Under its effects, Queen [[Ki Hiar]] of the kingdom of [[Saishu]] fell in love with a pirate from [[Wa]], and Prince [[Du-yang]] of the kingdom of [[Silla]] was slain by the jealous husband of a plotting woman.\n\nThe famed general [[Huat Rhu]] of the kingdom of [[Koguryo]] once led his forces into the [[Naktong Moors]], and they were never seen again.\n\nIn the year Koryo 812, the hero [[Niofu Sangto]] defeated the Kozakuran navy at the [[Battle of Wui Eyong]], with the aid of the ''[[sitting dog]]'' of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung''.\n\nIn [[925 DR]], [[Won Kwang]] established the famous [[Do Jang of Won Kwang]] in [[Pyong Do]], teaching martial arts, warfare, courtly skills, and other matters.This is \"432 years ago\" from an assumed date of 1357 DR, or several years before.\n\nKozakuran forces once ruled the Koryoan city of [[Karak]] and built a subterranean fortress beneath the city. Some ten generations before 1357 DR, these Kozakurans stole the [[Hu'i Wing]], a sacred relic in the town of [[Goisho]], and carried it off to Karak, where they built it into the fortress.\n\nAround the year 1200 by Koryoan reckoning, a great many refugees fled Karak by [[junk]]s, journeying down the coast to the city of [[Tu Pe]]. They moored their ships at the Long Pier, creating a neverending traffic jam that grew into a veritable \"floating city\".It seems likely these refugees fled the Kozakuran occupation of Karak.",
            "Modern history": "In the early 14{{th}} century, Silla was at war with both Koguryo and Saishu. Instrumental in Silla's campaign was General [[Wanang Sun]], a master of strategy who, even as he aided the [[king of Silla]] in overcoming the other kingdoms, plotted to become king himself and lay the foundation for a more secure and prosperous realm.\n\nIn the 1330s [[DR]], the king of Silla conquered the rival kingdoms of Koguryo and Saishu, unifying the whole land of Choson into the [[Sillan Empire]] and defending against all threats.This is \"15 years before\" a point \"several years ago\" from 1357 DR. However, the Sillan king proved to be a tyrant, inflicting crippling taxes and martial law on Saishu, occupying it with Sillan troops. However, Wanang Sun protected Dan Zor, king of Saishu, even arranging a marriage between their families.\n\nOver the next fifteen years, the king of Silla began to plot an invasion of Kozakura, and in secret assembled a fleet of ships for the purpose.\n\nAround [[1350 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">\"Several years\" before 1357 DR. the king of Silla ordered \"nameless ones\" to kidnap the teenaged children of [[Meo Yungdo]], a noble of [[Xai Chung]]. His reason remains unknown; it may have been leverage against Yungdo, or in cruel revenge over some perceived offense. [[Meo Cha]] and [[Meo Li]] managed to escape, and stowed away on a ship that, rather than being bound for Xai Chung, was in fact part of the king's own secret invasion fleet, now underway for Kozakura. Ultimately, a tsunami wrecked the whole armada, and the Meo children were washed ashore, alive and well, in Shou Lung.\n\nThis catastrophe saw the end of the king of Silla's reign; he abdicated and fled. In his place, General Wanang Sun seized the throne, becoming king and reforming the Sillan Empire into the [[Empire of Koryo]]. He welded the old factions of Choson into a unified nation. He granted Dan Zor governorship on Saishu, lifted the martial law, and cut taxes, winning the support of both Zor and the Saishu people.\n\nHowever, the former king of Silla and his most loyal supporters escaped to the [[Dang Caverns]].\n\nBy [[1357 DR]], Koryo was at war with Kozakura. Karak was at the center of an ongoing war for territory between the kingdom of Koryo and advance forces of Kozakura. The war left many innocent people injured, and around a thousand people fled north to [[Singye]] and camped outside that city. One morning, the bodies of fifteen black-clad [[ninja]] were discovered in the streets of Karak, and they were seen as evidence of Kozakuran encroachment. King Wanang Sun considered dispatching more soldiers to the area. The city of Tu Pe kept vigilant with patrols along the southern coast to Karak to watch out for invaders."
