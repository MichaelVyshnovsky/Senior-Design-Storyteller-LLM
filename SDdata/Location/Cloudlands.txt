The '''Cloudlands of Avaeraether''' were a fabled kingdom in the sky, said to have once existed above the [[Stonelands]].

==History==
According to [[Elminster]]'s research, if the Cloudlands did in fact once exist then it would have been roughly 1,500 years prior to the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Avaeraether maintained trade links with the nearby realm of [[Tethyamar]], buying metals from the [[dwarf|dwarves]].

==Myths & Rumors==
The legends claimed that one day the [[mage]] rulers of the [[Netherese]] cities of [[Asram]] and [[Anauria]] discovered the Cloudlands and sought to conquer them, believing they could act as a safehaven from the ever-expanding [[Anauroch]] desert. Their efforts ultimately destroyed the kingdom and the enchantments of its clouds, causing its cities and fortresses to fall and become the many large rock formations that dot the plains of the Stonelands.

Of those who believed in these legends, some thought that some of these enchanted castles in the sky still existed hidden in the clouds, inhabited by the sky-dwelling creatures seen in the Stonelands. Others claimed that lingering spells from this fabled war were the cause of the region's frequent terrible storms.

==Inhabitants==
Legends said that the Cloudlands were home to [[asperii]], [[cloud giant]]s, [[giant eagle]]s, [[mist dragon]]s, [[pegasi]], [[silver dragon]]s, [[storm giant]]s, and [[sylph]]s. They were also said to be home to a race of winged, elf-like beings. All of these creatures were said to have lived in harmony and only descended to the surface when they needed to gather or trade food or other necessities. They generally avoided nearby [[human]] kingdoms, especially Asram.

The giants in particular were said to frequently take stone from the surface, using it to build the Cloudlands' many cities and fortresses.
