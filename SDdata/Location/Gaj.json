        "mainbody": "'''Gaj''' was a market town mostly inhabited by hard-working [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s, located to the southwest from the [[Blade Kingdoms]], on the westernmost foothills of the [[Maerthwatch]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].",
        "Description": "As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Gaj was an unwalled settlement that housed numerous crafters, and areas surrounding it were farmed land.",
        "Government": "The town was ruled by an elected council of twelve called the Luth. The council members all were senior crafters. The Luth commanded the town's Gajmar, the title given to the leader of Gaj's town watch. The watch consisted of [[cudgel]]-armed \"trusties\" and spies who kept an eye on visitors and outsiders, as well as spellcasters who watched over outsider [[mage]]s, adventurers, and other notable powerful individuals. The town watch prevented gangs and criminal organizations from forming in Gaj and stopped thefts, blackmail, and arson.",
        "Trade": "Being a major trade settlement, Gaj's industry was based around its shallow [[copper]] and [[silver]] mines with an occasional [[gold]] vein. The dwarven inhabitants worked the mines while gnomes manned the town's smelters and foundries. Gaj produced copper wire grips for tolls and weapons, wire jewelry mounts and handles, teapot handles, and other such items. These products were exported to coastal [[Chondath]] and [[Chessenta]]. In turn, Gaj imported clothing, woven textiles, and fine [[wine]].\n\nThe town was fed by its farms that produced [[goat cheese]], [[milk]], [[mutton]], and vegetables. Gaj also produced lower-quality wines and [[ale]]s, both sour-tasting. The town's cuisine consisted of a variety of soups and stews with [[leek]]s, [[marrow]]s, [[dilvarren]]s, [[roast goat]], [[goat milk]], and [[redroot]]. Gaj's specialty [[bread]]s were [[barley bread]]s and [[nutbread]]s, with [[walnut]]s—nicknamed \"brains\"—being prevalent.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Lhlarauna Dashard Umurr]], the retired adventurer and the Gajmar ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1354}}."
