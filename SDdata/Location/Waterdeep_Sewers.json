        "mainbody": "he sewers of Waterdeep were a sanitation system of tunnels beneath the city that connected to most locations throughout Waterdeep, including its dungeons.\nThe depth of these sewers varied across Waterdeep, One reason for this was Mount Waterdeep and the plateau the northern portion of the city was built upon. Another was that the varied sizes and areas in which the sewer network was constructed at were both deliberate design decisions, made in order to optimally account for the ocean tides.\nThe tunnels of this sewer system did not match up with the routes of the citys streets above them by the 14 century DR. This was partially due to the ever changing layout of Waterdeep, but also because the sewers layout was dictated in part by where Mount Waterdeeps springs rose and flowed down to the sea.\nThe Field Ward, the harbor islands, and the heart of Mount Waterdeep were the only areas in the city that the sewers did not run beneath.\nRefuse, as well as air, were brought down into the sewers by numerous feeder pipes scattered throughout the city. These pipes measured less than  in diameter.\nThe sewer network operated on a system of tidal flushing, and were flushed out by those same tides. The sewer also received water from its upper levels by means of street runoff of rain and the frequent coastal fog, These places were purposely difficult to access, as the sewer networks designers sought to hamper the movements of less desirable visitors from the sea and to prevent the sewers from being used by criminals as an underground highway.\nDue to the great size of Waterdeep, there were concerns that the tidal flushing system could lead to the citys harbor becoming a cesspool. To ensure this didnt occur, Ahghairon and other mages bound spells into the citys wards and bound some elementals. In conjunction with the deliberate design decisions made for the sewers size and layout, these assisted the flows of water in carrying away sewage.\nSome of the more powerful spells that Ahghairon bound into the sewers involved mass teleporting waste straight to the Rat Hills. These spells continued to be renewed over the years by members of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors.\nSome areas of the sewers featured doors that would close upon water entering from certain passages, which ensured that flooding did not occur. Other areas had pressure plates that would close doors once water stopped flowing over them, thus preventing backwash.\nthumb|150px|With no lighting available in the sewers, Tertius Wands and Onyx the Invincible have to resort to holding a lantern as they follow their arrow of direction.\nThe ceilings, floors, and walls all throughout the sewer system were made of masonry, There was little to no lighting within the sewers and a terrible stench pervaded the entire network.\nGratings in the sewers were all made of iron and were quite thick. Some were permanently set into the stone walls, while others could swing open on pivots. By the 14 century DR, many of these grates were suffering from rust.\nOne of the two oldest parts of the sewers was a large semicircular channel, which ran around the inland side of the spur of Mount Waterdeep that jutted out into the Castle Ward. Waste from the North Ward and Sea Ward drained through this channel. The other oldest structure was two trunk sewers, which drained waste from the Trades Ward and Southern Ward. Both structures emptied out into Deepwater Harbor.\nThe passages of this sewer network had no names, thus directions tended to be given in terms of entry points and paces. Those who worked in the sewers were known to navigate passages by laying down boards as temporary bridges or by vaulting across ledges with  catchpoles. The latter of which were carried in order to reach below the water and clear debris from gratings.\nthumb|273px|Tertius and Onyx have a moment of rest on a passage ledge, having defeated a giant crocodile.\nPassages were denoted as being either one of two types based on their size, primary and secondary. Primary passages were easily navigable. They measured  across and had parallel,  wide, walkway ledges that lacked rails. Secondary passages were smaller, requiring human-sized creatures to crawl or swim their way through. They measured  and had a single  wide ledge on one of their sides, usually the more easterly or southerly side.\nPrimary passages were far more common in the northern parts of the citys sewers, while secondary passages were prevalent in the areas beneath the Dock Ward.\nBesides these two types there were many older, smaller passages that had over time been put out of service and walled up by the 14 century DR.\nSome areas of the sewers featured stone portals, a network built by an old dwarven kingdom to quickly move about. These required special enchanted stone items to activate, which took a variety of forms. These included daggers, gemstones, holy symbols, medallions, necklaces, orbs, rings, and scepters.\nSome areas featured teleportation pads that were constructed by the sewer networks designers. These would teleport people to the surface, acting as an emergency exit for sewer workers in the case of flooding or other hazards. When broken, they would only teleport people elsewhere within the sewers.\nThe sewer network notably featured connections to the dungeon complex under Castle Waterdeep, Many such links were kept operable and secret by the many guilds and shady organizations that operated in the city.\nConnections with Undermountain in particular featured heavily in the citys tavern lore. \nDungeon Level This first level of Undermountain had a tight winding crawl space, the Grim Passage, that ended at a secret door high above the headless relic known as Grim Statue. This was entered by means of a hidden door in the sewer passage beneath Slide Alley. This sewer passage paralleled the docks north of Sail Street, branched near Mirts Mansion, and linked up to a junction room (SF48). The Grim Passage itself wound and twisted through the rat-infested remnants of old, filled-in and forgotten cellars and disused privy chutes, until curving into a dead end where the hidden door above the statue laid. The drop down to the Grim Statue was roughly .\nFireplace Level This complex of rooms within the Dungeon of the Crypt was connected to the midden of the Grinning Lion and a junction room in the sewers beneath it (SF31) by means of a secret staircase.\nLost Level This sixth level of Undermountain was connected to the sewers by means of a portal that was visible only on the night of a full moon in the month of Flamerule.\nthumb|273px|A creature reaches up through a streets sewergrate.\nThere were a great deal of creatures that inhabited this sewer network, far more than could logically be expected to find enough food to survive. Many of these creatures entered the sewers by means of the Dungeon of the Crypt and Undermountain. There were also a wide variety of fungi and oozes that lived in the sewers, with there being a small chance of an ooze crawling its way up the privy pipes of the sewers.\nAdventurers, Such groups sometimes hired Cellarers to guide them through the sewers at the cost of 20 gold pieces a day, but such guides never carried weapons and would stick to only traveling the primary passages.\nExplorers of the sewers risked exposure to sewer plagues. The waters were generally tainted with blinding sickness and any open wounds ran the risk of being contaminated with filth fever.\nthumb|Some of the sewers inhabitants and unwitting adventurers.|335x335px\nAround 1357 DR\nThe creatures most commonly encountered within the sewer network around 1357 DRWaterdeep and the North states on page 14 that the news provided in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set, \"...is current [to this book] as of early Mirtul, in the Year of the Prince.\" included huge centipedes, a colony of green slime, a colony of yellow mold, mites, rats and giant rats, rot grubs, and scum creepers.\nThe creatures less commonly encountered in the sewers around this time were boggles, galltrits, giant bats, giant centipedes, giant ticks, huge spiders, jackalweres, large pedipalps, mongrelmen, skeletons, stirges, wererats, kobolds, and kuo-toa.\nAnd finally, the creatures only rarely encountered in the sewers around this time were cambions, giant bloodworms, cave fishers, crocodiles, executioners hoods, giant slugs, gibbering mouthers, gorbels, grells, lurker aboves, mimics, neo-otyughs and otyughs, obliviaxes, shadows, shadow demons, shambling mounds, slicer beetles, stunjellies, tentamorts, tunnel worms, vargouilles, and xorns.\nAround 1368 DR\nThe creatures most commonly encountered within the sewer network around 1368 DR included bats, crocodiles, giant leechs, otyughs, megalo-centipedes, mongrelmen, ochre jellies, osquips, rats and giant rats, rot grubs, skeletons, slithering trackers, stirges, stun jellies, tunnel worms, yellow molds, and zombies.\nThe creatures less commonly encountered in the sewers around this time were broken ones, brown mold colonies, cavefishers, gremlins, sewerms, shriekers, giant spiders, giant and huge centipedes, gray oozes, green slimes, and russet mold colonies.\nAnd finally, the creatures only rarely encountered in the sewers around this time were carrion crawlers, cave fishers, deepspawn, common feyrs, giant slugs, gorbels, green hags, grells, gulguthydrae, jackalweres, living walls, lurkers, mimics, shambling mounds, and sinisters.\nAround 1372 DR\nThe creatures most commonly encountered within the sewer network around 1372 DR included bats, bloodbloaters, carrion crawlers, centipedes, chokers, eyeballs, common feyrs, flotsam oozes, gray oozes, gricks, lurkers, meazels, merfolk, mimics, ochre jellies, osquips, rats, sewerms shadows, shriekers, skum, spiders, splinterwaifs, stirges, twig blights, violet fungi, wasps, wererats, green slimes, brown molds, and yellow molds.\nThe creatures only rarely encountered in the sewers around this time were aboleths, beholders, breathdrinkers, chuuls, crimson deaths, cursts, crocodiles, darkmantles, darktentacles, deepspawn, drowned ones, ghaunadans, gibbering mouthers, greater feyrs, greenvise, grells, gulguthydrae, kelp anglers, leechwalkers, lifeleech otyughs and normal otyughs, mongrelfolk, moonrats, mudmaws, ocularons, plague ants, plague spewers, shambling mounds, sinisters, swamp striders, wights, will-o-wisps, wraiths, yellow musk creepers and zombies, magerippers, and rylkar.\nSome areas connected between primary passages, known as junction rooms, were square in shape. They measured  by , were  tall, and had a sitting ledge near their ceiling.\nEntrances into the sewer network were known as surface shafts. They measured  in diameter, were typically spherical in shape, and had iron rungs set in the walls for use as ladders. They were capped by covers made either wholly of metal or of metal-banded wood. These covers were known as \"manholes\" or \"person access covers.\"\nThe surface shafts and junction rooms of this sewer network (as labeled on the map above) could be found at the following locations\nSF1 A surface shaft underneath trees in the interior of the block northwest of the shrine to Silvanus within the Shrines of Nature.\nSF2 A surface shaft in the northernmost corner of Sabbars Alley.\nSF3 A surface shaft in the center of Shank Alley.\nSF4 A surface shaft south off the Street of Glances and just south of the tree in Sniff Alley.\nSF5 A surface shaft in the central stand of trees in the southern end of Heroes Garden, Halfway down this shaft was a secret entrance leading to the Catacombs of Yintros.\nSF6 A surface shaft under a lone tree in the alleyway west of Eltorchul Villa, south of Ivory Street and north of Pharras Alley.\nSF7 A surface shaft in the mouth of an alleyway opening north off Chasso’s Trot, just west of Sul Street.\nSF8 A surface shaft in a cul-de-sac due south of Jhansczil Villa.\nSF9 A surface shaft underneath a tree, in an alleyway just south of Brossfeather Villa.\nSF10 A surface shaft just south of the Ilitul Villa, at the northern end of a dead alley opening off Grimwald’s Way.\nSF11 A surface shaft just west off Mendever Street, in the easternmost cul-de-sac that opens off the alleyway bounding Nesher Villa.\nSF12 A surface shaft in an alleyway just west of the gates of Manthar Villa, off Delzorin Street, between Sul Street and Shield Street.

This is because their primary concerns were keeping the sewers of the city functional and safe, with guild members being engaged in constant small repair jobs in the sewers, such as on plumbing in old buildings. They also possessed maps of the sewers, but they never sold them.\nCity Guard In the late-14 century DR, it became the duty of the City Guard to police the sewers.\nCity Watch Up until the late-14 century DR, it was the duty of the City Watch to police the sewers. After this authority switched over to the City Guard, watchmen rarely ever entered the sewers. Only doing so if pursuing a suspect or when they discovered sewer tunnels that connected with cellars. All Watch captains possessed keys to the sewer access points of their assigned ward.\nConfluence The lower status members of this secret society used secret passages within the sewers to enter Tespergates, their organizations base of operations, by means of the villas cellars.\nCult of the Rat A beast cult that worshiped Sneel, the lesser deity of rats, lived and operated in secrecy in the sewers throughout the 14 and 15 centuries. Many of its members were individuals who allowed themselves to be afflicted with the wererat form of lycanthropy. They often had offerings to Sneel in their warrens, meant to try and earn his favor.\nDungsweepers Guild This guild normally did not work on the sewer system, but for security reasons the city reserved the right to contact the guildmaster and hire members to help in such work.\nGuild of Watermen Members of this guild knew various spots where the sewer system emptied into the harbor.\nMerfolk Living within Deepwater Harbor, these people regularly patrolled the areas where the sewers emptied. They would use pole mounted catch-nets to scoop up and gather any debris they found into large tow-globes, which they then used to transport the debris far out to sea.\nPlague Rats This elite organization of thieves and assassins operated mainly under the cover of darkness in this sewer network and the Dock Ward.\nSavants of the Dark Tide This aboleth-led criminal organization had its base of operations within this sewer network and mainly operated within it.\nUnseen This secret society operated out of both the sewers and Rat Hills for decades, but following the Rat Hills Conflagration they began having their main meetings within secret rooms in the sewers. Their leader, Hlaavin, also kept many safe houses within the sewers.\nXanathars Thieves Guild This guild had safehouses scattered throughout the sewers, hidden by secret doors. Tunnels were often marked with the symbol of the guild in yellow chalk, helping to guide members to the safehouses. Every few days these were erased, either by members of the guild or by the Dungsweepers Guild. The guild also utilized some of the stone dwarven portals that were scattered around the sewers.\nThese sewers were built over the course of many generations, dating as far back as 1162 DR. As far back as this date, there existed three levels to the sewer system.\nDuring the days of Ahghairon, a number of Underdark creatures tried to invade the sewers and Waterdeep proper by means of a portal within Undermountain, which he put an end to by means of the gatewarp spell.\nAt some point a group of dwarves established a kingdom beneath the sewers, which eventually fell into ruin and became a mere legend on the surface. Their ruins were later discovered by the archeaologist Wently Kelso.\nIn 1208 DR, in the month of Kythorn, some unauthorized construction was discovered on the second level of the sewers.\nAfter securing a stronghold in 1262 DR (that would later be renamed the Citadel of the Bloody Handy), the Shadow Thieves constructed for it two links to the sewers of Waterdeep.\nIn 1280 DR, in the month of Mirtul, some trapped sewer gas was cleared from an area on the third sewer level. A year later, on the month of Kythorn, a cistern area was added to the second level of the sewers. And in 1292 DR, on the month of Tarsakh, flood control gates on the second level were repaired and additional ones were installed.\nIn 1298 DR, the Shadow Thieves were driven out of the city and the Lords of Waterdeep had the citadels two passages to the sewers garrisoned by the City Guard. From then on they were occasionally employed by high-ranking occupants of Castle Waterdeep when a discreet exit was desired.\nSome time in the late 1350s DR, on Mirtul 15, twelve tanystropheus eggs ordered by Phalantars Philtres & Components hatched and escaped into the sewers via a garbage chute. That night a crew of Cellarers were attacked by the young dinosaurs while laying a large, heavy length of pipe. One member was killed, while two others were badly mauled. Frustrated by this, the guild offered a reward of 200 gold pieces for their capture (dead or alive), while Phalantar Orivan himself offered 500 gp for live specimens and 100 gp for dead ones. By the end of Uktar, it was assumed that any tanystropheuses not recovered were dead from the winter weather.\nAround this decade, false and terribly inaccurate maps of the sewers were being sold by people trying to pass themselves off as Cellarers.\nIn 1355 DR, in the months of Ches and Tarsakh, flood control blocks were proposed for some areas of the upper sewer level.\nIn 1357 DR, a man from Luskan by the name of Neruudan set about making a smuggling ring in Waterdeep. To that end, he hired an evil mage to clear out the upper sewers. The mage put a giant crocodile in the sewers, with his quasit familiar riding upon its back and directing the beast, killing members of the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild until they began to refuse to do work. However, Neruudan was unaware of the sewers use as a highway by locals and their wide selection of dangerous fauna, which eventually lead to the downfall of his plans.\nIn 1358 DR, during the Time of Troubles, the mortal avatar of Myrkul opened a portal between Hades and the Prime Material plane. Hoards of undead came rushing out through the sewers and up into the Dock Ward. The guardsman Ylarell tracked these undead and in the process was slain by Myrkul. Five Cellarers also became lost in the sewers during this time, having been transformed into cursts that continued to patrol the sewers for decades.\nIn the wake of Myrkuls destruction a deathshrieker was created in the sewers beneath what later became known as Cynosure. It would stalk the sewers for over a decade.\nAlso during this year, on Marpenoth 7 an adventuring band received orders from the Lords of Waterdeep to travel into the citys sewers to put an end to the ongoing plans of Xanathar. which included several notes on the hazards and creatures they could expect to encounter. Secretly aided by another beholder,\nIn Eleint, 1367 DR, new creatures began to be encountered in the sewers by members of the Plumbers Guild, such as sewerms. Some of these new creatures originated from the Rat Hills, such as gulguthydrae, having fled into the sewers following the Rat Hills Conflagration.\nIn 1369 DR, during the event known as Halasters Higharvestide, a number of creatures crawled out from the sewers and terrorized the people of Waterdeep. Following this event, the guard station located near the northern entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand became primarily concerned with guarding against the living spells that still remained after Halasters Higharvestide.\nThat same year the city faced an attack by the forces of Iakhovas. In the wake of that repelled invasion a number of sea creatures escaped into the sewer system, with some of them, like the malenti Laaqueel, having been led into the sewers through a surface shaft at Coin Alley by Iakhovas himself.\nAmong the dozens of aboleths that fought in the army of Iakhovas there was one trio, hailing from the Swordsea Depths, who had joined in this assault for the sole purpose of using the chaos to sneak their way into the citys sewer system. Within the sewers the would-be Savants of the Dark Tide established a lair, then over time gradually enslaved members of the Cellarers’ & Plumbers’ Guild and transformed rogues into skum servitors.\nAround 1372 DR, the doomsphere Xliiqil began stalking the sewers, trying to learn what happened to the Company of Crazed Venturers who had slayed it decades prior. Also around this time, eyeballs and lurking stranglers roamed the sewers on behalf of Xanathar. After the event known as the Silence of Lolth began in Eleasis 28, some drow fled into the depths of the Lowerdark and displaced the rylkar, a rat-like species to known to only a few Underdark experts. Moving to higher subterannean depths, the rylkar began infesting sewers in Faerûn, including the Sewers of Waterdeep.\nIn 1385 DR, the Spellplague hit Toril and caused all of the Walking Statues of Waterdeep to become animated and wreak havoc across the city. The Blackstaff at the time, Tsarra Chaadren, turned the ground to mud underneath a statue known as the God Catcher. It sank partway into the ground, one of its legs penetrating a sewer line. Once the statues became immobile the God Catcher remained where it had sunken and was eventually converted into a tenement building, while its leg was hollowed out to create an access point to the sewer system.\nAround In the late 15 century DR, a number of dwarves attempting to dig larger homes for themselves in Undercliff inadvertently breach Waterdeeps sewers in the process.\nIn , shortly after Mistshore was largely destroyed in a massive fire, Xanathar had some areas of the sewer network diverted in order to give his organization more space, which resulted in a large daily influx of sewage into Deepwater Harbor. Merfolk who lived nearby made attempts to clean the area, but were slaughtered by an undead eye of the deep under Xanathars command. Eventually, Laeral Silverhand intervened &mdash the meddlings of Xanathar were undone, the eye of the deep was slain, and harbor waters were revitalized.\nIn 1492 DR, Jeryth Phaulkon sent awakened rats into the sewers to search for Xanathars hidden lair, eventually discovering a secret spiral stairwell in the sewers beneath the Castle Ward.\n* Some rumors claimed that the cellars of some of the City Watchs guardposts contained secret entrances to the sewers.\n* Some claimed that members of the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild could purposely cause the sewers to back up and overflow into certain buildings as an intimidation tactic.\n* The Cliffwatch Inns cellars were rumored to have secret passages to the sewers.\n* There were persistent rumors that Uluryk Malogh made an extensive map of the citys cellars and sewers, detailing all their various barriers, locks, and traps.\n* Around the mid-14 century DR, there were rumors circulating that Xanathars Thieves Guild had trained guard rats roaming the sewers and that slavers dwelling within the uppermost rooms of Undermountain creeped out into the sewers at night to kidnap unsuspecting Waterdhavians."
