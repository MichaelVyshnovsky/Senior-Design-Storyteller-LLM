        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|-1399|TS}}, a massive horde of [[merrow (ogre)|merrows]] and [[koalinth]]s invaded the [[Hmur Plateau]], igniting what would become known as the [[Fourth Serôs War]]. Their numbers too great to be overcome, they overran the Plateau and brought about the fall of the [[Republic of Tivaan]]. Feeling desperation, a mermaid stole a powerful [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Emerald Eye of Kyron]]'' from one of the towers of the [[Dukars]] of [[Myth Nantar]], believing it could drive away the invaders. However, she became corrupted by the ''Emerald Eye'', taken over by \n\nWith her mind corrupted by the ''Emerald Eye'', the mermaid imposed herself upon the invaders. She proclaimed them to be the [[Second Kingdom of Kyron]] and became their leader in a continued conquest of the Hmur Plateau. The war would eventually come to an end in {{YearlinkConvert|-1396|TS}}, with the possessed mermaid killed and the ''Emerald Eye'' taken back into the custody of the Dukars. The mermaid's body would be buried in the Plains of Duna, subsequently renamed the [[Haunted Plains]], and the Kingdom of Thalvan would be founded by King [[Darmox]] as the successor to the Republic of Tivaan.It is never stated within either of the primary sources, ''Sea of Fallen Stars'' and ''Grand History of the Realms'', what the \"Second Kingdom of Kyron\" was. In its summary of the [[Serôs Wars]] on page 153, ''Sea of Fallen Stars'' states that the Fourth Serôs War's belligerents were the \"Second Kingdom of Kyron vs. koalinth and merrow hordes.\" This would seem to imply that the Republic of Tivaan was this \"Second Kingdom of Kyron\", however, it seems unlikely that the republic that rebelled against Kyron's rule would take such a name for themselves and is contradicted by the text on the two cited pages stating that the destruction of the Second Kingdom of Kyron adversely affected the Serôsian population of koalinths&mdash;if koalinths were in opposition to this Second Kingdom, then its destruction would logically be advantageous to them. This leaves the conclusion that the \"Second Kingdom of Kyron\" must refer to the collective forces under the mermaid corrupted by the ''Emerald Eye'' and the spirit of King Kyron within it.\n\nThe [[Aryselmalyr Empire]], having over the past century subjugated the merfolk of Serôs under the reign of [[Coronal]] [[Essyl Merynth]], promised Thalvan protection under its new leader, the kindly Coronal [[Vaeqiis]]."
