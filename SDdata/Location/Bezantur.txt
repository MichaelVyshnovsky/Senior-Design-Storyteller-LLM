Bezantur, also known as the City of a Thousand Temples, and the Citadel of Thieves, was a foreboding but prosperous port city located at the southern coast of the Thayan tharch of Priador. It was as diverse a place that could be found in the nation, a religious hub for those oppressed by the centuries-long rule of the Red Wizards and their strict adherence to the worship of magic above all else. 
Though it lacked the joy and hope offered by the great metropolises of western Faerûn, it was the heart and soul of Thay, famous for its great harbor that opened up into the Alamber Sea.

Bezantur was enclosed within massive, black walls that loomed over its outer streets. The slums of Bezantur stuck to these walls and spread beyond their protection, in a grouping of shacks and inter-connected shanties known as Market Town. The stench of the unwashed masses combined with burning refuse, roaming livestock and open sewer grates permeated this area and wafted well into the city proper.
The famed harbor of Bezantur was nearly always packed to the brim with ships unloading their goods in and out of the city. Due to the lack of "official" taxes, Guild of Foreign Trade inspectors, along with their thieves guild counterparts, were often found taking their cut of Bezanturan imports. While sharks, giant eels and octopuses inhabited the waters beneath the docks, sahuagin and even lacedons were known to come ashore and wreak havoc. The harbor waters were known to be rich with wealth, thrown there as tributes to Umberlee by the inhabitants of the city. It was said that anyone fool enough to helm themselves to those riches would suffer death by drowning, regardless of how far they fled.
Most of Bezanturs more reputable buildings, along with many of its temples, could be located in the heart of the city, at the end of the High Road just beyond the North Gate. The southwest quarter was a labyrinthine maze warehouses, often used to arrange clandestine meetings and conduct illicit business,
Crime was rampant throughout Bezantur. Mighty thieves guilds conducted their operations without a care of repercussion from the authorities, thanks to their systematic bribery of Thayan officials. The gnolls and goblinoid creatures that served in the legions would regularly attack visitors in the open streets and were seldom thwarted by guards or constabulary.
Bezantur was vital to the Thayan economy, as it controlled the majority of Thay sea trade across the Alamber Sea. The neutral waters of the Alamber served as the primary route between Thay, Mulhorand, Unther,,Tymanther and High Imaskar. Just about anything, or anyone, was available for purchase within the city.
During the reign of tharchion Mari Agneh, taxes were completely eliminated in the city of Bezantur.
The city housed the headquarters of the Guild of Foreign Trade, overseen by the ambitious and adept transmuter, Samas Kul, who ascended to the rank of zulkir.
Many different gods were worshiped in the great temples of Bezantur, and it served as a religious center for the faithful whose worship was otherwise forgotten throughout Thay. Amongst the people of the city, the most popular deities were said to be Mask and Umberlee.
Temples dedicated to the dark gods, such as Talos, Loviatar, Beshaba, the ancient Netherese deity Garagos, and even the often-shunned Gargauth were prominent in Bezantur, along with those devoted to faiths that were long-forgotten following the Time of Troubles such as Bhaal and Leira. The non-human faithful of Thay were fairly well represented, as the city had sanctuaries devoted to the Orc pantheon, Juiblex, and even Lolth, the Dark Mother of the drow.
Worship of the so-called "good" deities, like Chauntea, Sune and Mielikki, could be found in the city, though they were much harder to locate. Their respective clergies were regularly driven out of Bezantur by the followers of more-prominent faiths.
While the city hosted major temples to Azuth and Mystra prior to the Time of Troubles, open veneration of these gods was strictly forbidden following that event. The Red Wizards considered themselves guardians of the magic they hoarded, and abhorred any being, mortal or divine, who sought to disseminate the secrets of the Art.
Bezantur was a city with over two millennia of history by the 14 century DR. It was originally a bustling port city of Raumathar known as Kensten until it was taken over by the Red Wizards, renamed Bezantur, and established as its own tharch within the fledgling magocracy of Thay.
Kensten was founded by the Raumathar Empire for its location as a port on the Alamber Sea. It developed slowly due to its distance from the empires core territories,
In the , during the climax of the Great Conflagration between Raumathar and Narfell, Raumathari forces mustered at Kensten, prompting a attack by the Nar armies. In response, the Raumathari wizards summoned an avatar of the god Kossuth to defend the city. While the Lord of Flames did destroy the attackers, he then turned his attention to Kensten itself, burning the city and much of the surrounding coastline in retaliation for the Raumatharis audacity to summon him. Both armies were devastated and their respective empires irrevocably weakened, while the only survivors from Kensten were those who fled by boat to the island of Alaor.
Kensten was later rebuilt and repopulated as a holding of Mulhorand in the . The Mulhorandi leaders erected a temple to Kossuth to appease the deity, despite the displeasure of their god-kings. The first high-priest of Kossuth in Kensten was named Bezantur.
When Thay gained independence from Mulhorand in the , Kensten briefly became an independent city-state ruled by a mercantile council. However, it fell to the Red Wizards and was incorporated into Thay in the , after a fortnight-long siege. The invaders were aided by the treachery of Kossuths priests&mdashwho resented the taxation imposed by the council&mdashand the city was renamed to "Bezantur" in honor of the Kossuthan priest. By the , Bezantur had become its own tharch and was developing into Thays mercantile and religious capital. The worship of Kossuth remained one of the citys dominant religious institutions, eventually becoming the de facto official religion within the City of a Thousand Temples.
Following the Salamander War of the , the city was restructured as the capital of the newly-founded tharch of Priador. The previous tharchioness Mari Agneh competed with the ambitious evoker Aznar Thrul for leadership of the new province, but vanished under unknown circumstances. The newly-appointed zulkir Thrul, was awarded leadership over Priador, and made his home in Bezantur.
When undead forces ravaged the tharch of Pyarados, in Kythorn 1375 DR, the people of Bezantur celebrated with great fervor and cheered their apparent savior, the necromancer Szass Tam. It was one of the final insults to Aznar Thrul, that his political rival was celebrated for righting the calamity, which unbeknownst to Thrul, Tam had actually manufactured.
In the , the city of Bezantur was the setting for the final encounter between the legions of the Council of Zulkirs and those of the self-proclaimed regent Szass Tam during the Thayan civil war. The lich used the priests of Bane that were stationed in the town to force the zulkirs to flee aboard vessels to the islands of Alaor. The priests literally burned Bezanturs harbor to ashes in an attempt to destroy the zulkirs vessels as they fled. Szass then proclaimed the towns high priest of Bane, Zekidh Shezim, the new autharch of Bezantur.
