'''Scarred Alley''' was a miserable neighborhood that housed the [[spellscarred]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silent Streets and Vanished Souls|12}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silent Streets and Vanished Souls|13}}

==Geography==
Scarred Alley was located in Baldur's Gate's [[Outer City]] just a few blocks from [[Little Calimshan]].

==History==
As the city of Baldur's Gate had been largely untouched by the [[Spellplague]], the citizens were unaccustomed to those with [[spellscar]]s and regarded them with fear. Thus, they were unofficially quarantined in Scarred Alley. At some point, the [[Order of Blue Fire]] established a mission there to care for the spellscarred. 

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Grand Duke]] [[Valarken]] developed an interest in the spellscarred, believing that their bodies were ideal vessels for [[lycanthropy]]. He worked to subvert both the guards in Scarred Alley as well as the Order of Blue Fire, driving out those who would not cooperate and converting the remainder to his cause. As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, he had used the promise of a better life to buy the loyalty of many of the spellscarred in Scarred Alley, and had replaced all the guards with loyalists and [[lycanthrope]]s.

==Notable Locations==
* A chapter house of the Order of Blue Fire, which was abandoned by that faction by 1479 DR. It comprised several adjacent buildings cobbled together to create a single compound, and included an old ''[[teleportation circle]]'' that connected it to other chapters of the Order.
* A seedy [[tavern]] in front of which locals were known to share a drink.

==Inhabitants==
Scarred Alley was home both to the city's spellscarred citizens as well as spellscarred [[animal]]s.

Notable inhabitants included:
* "[[Cyclops (thug)|Cyclops]]", a local ruffian with a spellscarred eye.
