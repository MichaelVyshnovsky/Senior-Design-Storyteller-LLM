        "Description": "Ishe was dismally cold and was noted as being the last (mostly) civilized stop for those planning to follow the [[Howling Kupuk]] trail north toward the [[Great Glacier]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}",
        "Geography": "The village sat on the windswept westerly ridges of the northern end of the [[Galena Mountains]], just below where they met the eastern end of the [[Lugsaas Chain]]. It lay along the trail that headed north toward the Howling Kupuk pass to [[Frohm's Rest]] and south toward either [[Palischuk]] or [[the High Walk]] to [[Ironspur]].\n\nIshe was the furthest northeastern settlement in Vaasa proper. As of {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the edge of the Great Glacier sat south of the Lugsaas Chain, just a few hours north of the village. Because the Glacier continued to retreat northward over the decades, by the late 15{{Th}} century [[DR]] explorers had to travel to the [[Surykyk Range]] approximately 75 miles (120 km) north of the village to arrive at the edge.",

            "Notable Inhabitants": "In the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, notable members of Ishe included:\n* [[Vurl]], the innkeeper.\n* [[Kahil Brogman]], a guide and conman."
