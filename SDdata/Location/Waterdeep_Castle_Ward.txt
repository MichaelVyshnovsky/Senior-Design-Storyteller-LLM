The '''Castle Ward''' was the central ward of the city of [[Waterdeep]]. It encompassed [[Mount Waterdeep]], [[Castle Waterdeep]], and much of the government of the city, which included the [[Palace of Waterdeep]], occupied by [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], and the residences of many prosperous Waterdhavians. Among these citizens were celebrated retired adventurers such as [[Mirt the Moneylender]].

==Geography==
The ward was delimited by [[Julthoon Street]] to the north, west of [[Shield Street]], and by [[Trader's Way]] between Shield Street and the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]], which delimited the ward's eastern border together with [[Snail Street]]. The southern border of the ward was delimited by [[Shesstra Street]], [[Gut Alley]], [[Belnimbra's Street]], and [[Lackpurse Lane]], until the ward met [[Deepwater Harbor]].{{Template:Cite book/City of Splendors (boxed set)/Adventurer's Guide to the City|18}}

===Geographical Features===
Much of the territory of the Castle Ward was taken up by Mount Waterdeep, which consisted mostly of unused land.

==History==
