The Castle Ward was the central ward of the city of Waterdeep. It encompassed Mount Waterdeep, Castle Waterdeep, and much of the government of the city, which included the Palace of Waterdeep, occupied by Piergeiron the Paladinson in the mid-14 century DR, and the residences of many prosperous Waterdhavians. Among these citizens were celebrated retired adventurers such as Mirt the Moneylender.
The ward was delimited by Julthoon Street to the north, west of Shield Street, and by Traders Way between Shield Street and the High Road, which delimited the wards eastern border together with Snail Street. The southern border of the ward was delimited by Shesstra Street, Gut Alley, Belnimbras Street, and Lackpurse Lane, until the ward met Deepwater Harbor.
Much of the territory of the Castle Ward was taken up by Mount Waterdeep, which consisted mostly of unused land.
The Castle Ward was one of the original wards of Waterdeep, established by Ahghairon in the  together with the Trades Ward, Temple Ward, and Dock Ward.
Mount Waterdeep
 The massive peak around which Waterdeep was built Atop its summit was the Peaktop Aerie, which housed the citys famed Griffon Cavalry, and its sea-facing flank featured 11 triple-catapults armed with rock and flammable pots. Beneath these armaments were the sea caves, which allowed passage for ships to River Sargauth and the undercity of Skullport.
New Olamn
The bardic college was located on the rocky cliffside, in the western edge of the ward, overlooking the Sea of Swords. It was accessible by the cliffside path along Mount Waterdeep, or Mount Melody Walk, the subterranean passageway that was dug through the mountains side.
