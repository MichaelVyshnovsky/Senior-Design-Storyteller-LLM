Treasure hunters scoured the area for hidden caches for decades afterwards.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|21}}\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century DR, an orc bandit named [[Histarack]] discovered the Brotherhood's treasures. He then spread rumors that a new pocket of active [[blue fire]] had erupted in the area to keep the scavengers away. However, the story only served to garner the attention of the [[Order of Blue Fire]] who sent envoys to investigate the town's ruins and reveal the hoax for what it was.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|4}}\n\nBy the late 1480s or 1490s DR the town had been revived and repopulated.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Lord [[Delvon Icespear]] was killed without an heir, leaving the town leaderless for some time."
