'''In'ani''' was a city on the island of [[Saishu]] in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Geography==
In'ani stood on the northern tip of Saishu, facing the [[Yellow Sea]].

==History==
Around [[1357 DR]], a pride of [[sea lion]]s harassed shipping around In'ani. [[Dan Zor]], the leader of Saishu, sought adventurers who would destroy the beasts.

==Inhabitants==
The fishermen of In'ani, along with those of [[Ansong]], were claimed to be the best in the world, having done such things as eliminate the prides of sea lions in the [[Straits of Koryo]] and catch the enormous eel [[Ghartii Nung]].<ref group="note">It is not clear whether the fishermen responsible for these achievements came from In'ani or Ansong, or both settlements.
