'''Crimel''' was a small city in [[Luiren]] in the [[Shining South]].

==Geography==
Crimel was found along the edge of the [[Long Forest]].

==Inhabitants==
Only a thousand people lived in the city. Most of them were directly involved in the logging business given the close proximity to the Long Forest. Priests of [[Yondalla]] ensured that any timber harvest from the forest was done in an appropriate manner.

[[Silvo Carver]] served as mayor of Crimel.

==Armed Forces==
A small force of 50 [[halfling]] [[warders]] protected Crimel. These Warder's were particularly skilled in the ways of the forest.
