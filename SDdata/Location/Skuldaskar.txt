The '''Skuldaskar''' was a forest in the [[Western Heartlands]] between [[Berdusk]] and [[Elturel]].

==Geography==
It lay somewhere between [[Berdusk]] and [[Elturel]]. The [[Skuldask Road]] went through its heart.

===Flora & Fauna===
Per [[Elminster Aumar]], he had seen [[bear]]s, [[forest-cat]]s and [[sleep-spider]]s in the forest, as well as an overturned wagon surrounded by gnawed bones. The flora included [[shadowtop]]s.

==History==
Elminster Aumar was attacked by bandits while riding across the Skuldaskar during the first frosts of the {{yearlinkName|240}}, going from [[Elturel]] to [[Berdusk]]. He found many of the bandits' weapons to have an emblem of a serpent ready to strike. As the bandits struck his horse down, he walked the rest of the way, stopping at the [[Herald's Horn]].

By {{yearlink|1372}}, the Skuldaskar along both sides of [[Skuldask Road]] had been cut down extensively, with some light woods in swamps and heights, all else being tilled farms. The road remained, however.{{Cite dragon/301/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Tatha's Broomworks|74}}
