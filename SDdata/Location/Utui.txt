'''Utui''' was a village in the [[Angalpuk]] region within the [[Great Glacier]].

==Geography==
Utui was located in eastern Angalpuk. The village was surrounded by forests of [[pine]] trees and hilly countryside.

==Layout==
The village was spread out, with each family living within a separate [[Ulutiun dictionary#M|''minikitak'']] at least {{SI|100|ft}} from each other.

==Inhabitants==
Utui had a communal herd of 1,500 [[caribou]]. The communal caribou herd was the only thing the families of Utui collaborated on, otherwise they did not associate with each other and fierce rivalries were common between two separate families. [[Ulutiun dictionary#T|''tupa'']] was common, with the bride moving into the groom's minikitak, but the brides family mourned for several weeks as if they lost a loved one. 

While rivalries existed, violence between families was rare. The rivalries between families manifested as a competition of sorts, each family attempting to craft the finest item. As a result, the village created some of the finest trade good in the Great Glacier. Clothing, [[Ulutiun dictionary#J|''jakerek'']], [[Ulutiun dictionary#R|''rissik'']] and weapons from Utui were highly sought after.

Merchants visiting the village could get a lower price for goods by with flattery, complimenting the families craftsmanship. However, the other families in the village would become offended and ignore the visiting merchant for the duration of their stay.
