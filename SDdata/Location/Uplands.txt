The Uplands was a sparsely populated stretch of farmlands in the realm of Impiltur, located east of the Earthfast Mountains and north of the much more populated region known as the Easting Coast.
The Uplands contained a few large towns and small cities but was most noted for its numerous farming communities known as "thaedars". These collectives saw a number of small farms banding together for mutual protection, easier transportation of goods and a greater shared labor force during the harvest months. Among the most successful and well-known of these groups included the Red Ram, Silver Plough and Three Horns thaedars.
The miners and other laborers of the Uplands led hard lives that often led to heavy drinking rowdy behavior. While this behavior was seldom tolerated, these hard-working folk earned the nation significant wealth, and were a granted a fair amount of leeway by otherwise austere Impilturan constabulary.
Before the Great Glacier receded from northeastern Faerûn the Uplands were dominated by the great hobgoblin realm of Haekrukkha.
