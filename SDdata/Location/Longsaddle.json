        "Geography": "Situated east of the [[Crags]] and west of the [[Evermoors]], Longsaddle sat on an isolated stretch of the Long Road.\n\nThe surrounding area was a vast expanse of grassland that catered to the town's ranchers.",

        "History": "[[File:Longsaddle view.png|thumb|''A view of Longsaddle.''|360x360px]]\nLongsaddle was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1042}}, by [[Shardra Harpell]], an escaped [[Calishite]] [[slave]]. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, two separate sects of the [[Malar]]ite faith wanted to set up churches by the waterfront of a magically created lake. The two churches immediately began fighting each other and the Harpells had to step in. Unfortunately, they couldn't get rid of them so instead they imposed a severe punishment on the more dangerous individuals: transmuting them permanently into harmless [[rabbit]]s.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the forest around Longsaddle was inhabited by [[werewolf]] descendants of [[Bidderdoo Harpell]]. These werewolves were called \"the Bidderdoos\" and although the townsfolk feared them, they provided some measure of protection for the town.\n\nFrom 1479 DR until the end of the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, the reincarnated [[Catti-brie]], under the name of [[Delly Curtie]], dwelt at the [[Ivy Mansion]] in Longsaddle, learning magic from the Harpells.",
