        "mainbody": "Illul was a city on the island of Lantan in the Trackless Sea.Text in the sourcebooks consistently refer to Illul as a city, though The Forgotten Realms Atlas map marks all sites in Lantan as villages, presumably in error. It was the center of the faith of Gond the Wonderbringer in the Realms.\nIt stood on the southern shore of the island, facing the island of Suj over the channel called the Sambar Run.\nThe High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration in Illul was the center of the church of Gond in the Realms. It was a large walled monastery.\nCirca 1370 DR, the monastery was run by High Artificer Danactar, Most Holy Servant of Gond. Danactar was the highest-ranking mortal cleric of the Lord of All Smiths.\nThe techsmiths of the church of Gond were based and trained in Illul at the High Holy Crafthouse."
