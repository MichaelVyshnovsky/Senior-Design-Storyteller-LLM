'''Torich''' was a city of modest size in the [[Sanrach Mountains]] of [[Samarach]], the Hidden Kingdom.

==Description==
Torich was located in Samarach's northeastern corner, in the foothills of the Sanrach Mountains.

==Trade==
Torich's close vicinity to [[salt]] deposits ensured its wealth and growth. The city's salt mines produced salt of the highest quality.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Torich's salt mine was attacked by a tribe of [[firenewt]]s who came from deeper levels. The creatures dragged workers underground and claimed the excavation as the surviving miners fled. Torich's militia was informed of the attack but failed to act in a timely manner. [[Essien]], one of the mine's foremen, was desperate for help against the fiery monsters. Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samargol]] volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation.

==Notable Locations==
*Shrine to [[Waukeen]], a small but prosperous shrine ran by the [[Church of Waukeen]]. It offered to heal free of charge, but any other type of priestly magic or any goods for sale came at a steep cost.
*[[The Broken Pick]], the tavern and inn most popular among Torich's miner population.

==Notable Inhabitants==
*[[Essien]], a foreman from the [[Mines of Selgol]], Torich's salt mines in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
