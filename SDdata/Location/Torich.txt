Torich was a city of modest size in the Sanrach Mountains of Samarach, the Hidden Kingdom.
Torich was located in Samarachs northeastern corner, in the foothills of the Sanrach Mountains.
Torichs close vicinity to salt deposits ensured its wealth and growth. The citys salt mines produced salt of the highest quality.
In the , Torichs salt mine was attacked by a tribe of firenewts who came from deeper levels. The creatures dragged workers underground and claimed the excavation as the surviving miners fled.

Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant SaSani of Samargol volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation.
