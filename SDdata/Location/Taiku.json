        "mainbody": "aiku was a settlement in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.\nTaiku lay on the northern coast of the western peninsula, south of the Straits of Koryo.\nIn the settlement stood Taiku Fountain, which bestowed invulnerability on anyone who bathed in it, lasting for a period of ten days. Needless to say, by 1350 DR, authorities closely guarded the pool to stop it being misused. It was said the bravest heroes of Koryoan history bathed in the fountain and even drank its waters before their biggest battles."
