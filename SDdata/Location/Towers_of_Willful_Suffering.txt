The Towers of Willful Suffering was a temple and abbey complex located in Eshpurta, Amn. In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, it was a quiet, contemplative place with a staff of 16 priests and a community of 48 followers, led by the Revered Mother of the House Heldatha Dhussta. The grounds and architecture were understated and plain, but its mere presence in Amn made it stand out more than opulence and grandeur ever could.
