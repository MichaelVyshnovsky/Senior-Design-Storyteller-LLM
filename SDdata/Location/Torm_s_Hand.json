Folks came from far and wide to celebrate Kylsandrals life, including members of the Hellriders and the Flaming Fist. Notable among the celebrants was Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard, a longtime friend of Kylsandral.\nAs the procession made its way though Torms Hand and up towards the local Tormish church, a hellcyst opened up beneath the village. The local holy house known as the Fortress was pulled down to Avernus in the Nine Hells. The planewalker Emirikol attempted to saved everyone caught in the chaos, using his skyship called the Demonwing, but the final fate of the village and its people was unknown.\n* The Fortress, a fortified temple of Torm, the Faer√ªnian god of loyalty and duty."
