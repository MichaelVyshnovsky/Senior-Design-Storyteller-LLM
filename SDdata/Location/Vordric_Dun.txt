'''Vordric Dun''' was a mining town located in the eastern slopes of the [[Earthspur Mountains]] in the nation of [[Impiltur]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

==Inhabitants==
Vordric Dun miner's were a rough-and-tumble lot that lived hard lives. As a group, they competed with the miners of [[Laviguer]] for the resources located deep beneath the Earthspurs. They brought significant wealth to the Realm of the Sword and the Wand in the form of valuable gems, ore and minerals, among them the rare specimen known as [[bloodstone]], they excavated from their mines.

The town was well-patrolled by the [[Warswords]] of Impiltur. While they enforced the realm's ''"daggerbond"'', which forbade the open baring of weapons upon an individual's person, they afforded the hard-working citizens significant liberties in their daily life.
