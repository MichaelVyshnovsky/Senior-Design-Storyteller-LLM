Great Bhaerynden, Deep Lands or simply the Deeps,Although the terms "Great Bhaerynden" and "Deep Lands" are never explicitly stated to be synonymous, the description of the latter in Dwarves Deep corresponds to the same geographic area. It is described as being "...east of the Shining Sea and south of the Sea of Fallen Stars" and "...fan out beneath the Shaar for many thousands of miles". Furthermore, the very similar "Deepwilds" the given as a dwarven name for Great Bhaerynden in Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting p. 192 and Shining South p. 160. And both sources state that the Deepfall and Wyverncaves are located in Great Bhaerynden, whereas both were previously stated in Dwarves Deep as being part of the Deep Land. was a domain of the Underdark located in the south-central region of Faerûn beneath the vast plains of Shaar.
This region was the first homeland of the dwarves, in a cavern known as Bhaerynden. However, it was later invaded and conquered by the drow when they first ventured into the Underdark in search of a realm of their own, scattering the dwarves and sending them into exile.
Less than two millennia later, for reasons that remained unknown well into the Present Age, and the domed ceilings of its enormous vaults came crashing down. Many scholars suggested the the drow had caused the collapse by weakening the cavern roofs through excessive tunneling and an over-reliance on magic to support the roofs weight. Many gold dwarves on the other hand believed the collapse was the work of their god Moradin, crashing his mighty axe down to destroy Telantiwar.

The drow nobles that survived this disaster gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could before fleeing elsewhere in the Underdark to find a new place to call home.
Following this there was a hectic scramble in the Underdark to lay claim to new territory. Before long dwarves returned to their ancestral homeland and established the Deep Realm, staking their claim on both the Great Rift and much of the surrounding lesser caverns and tunnels. These dwarves would become the ancestors of Faerûns gold dwarves.
When the Spellplague struck Toril in the , great rifts opened up in the Underdark beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars, which in turn caused the collapse of great swathes of land. One of the casualties of this disaster was the Great Rift, whose western half collapsed into the deeper reaches of Great Bhaerynden, creating a huge canyon that was later dubbed Underchasm. Much of the communities in Great Bhaerynden were devastated in the wake of this formation, with numerous outposts and settlements becoming displaced. Many of the remaining drow realms in particular fell to ruin, with some even managing to take control of Underhome.
Gold dwarves lived in the Great Rift and a lot of the adjoining caves. They regularly patrolled the vast caves that were outside of their control. Occasional ambitious gold dwarves would attempt to establish homesteads or mining outposts, but within a year or two dangerous creatures that lurked within the recesses of the Great Bhaerynden would always drive them back.
Drow and half-drow held the cities of Tlindhet and Llurth Dreier. Halflings lived in Deepburrow in Great Bhaerynden. Earth genasi, urdunnir dwarves, and many creatures of elemental earth made their home in Earths End. They were later joined by more genasi, as well as Halruaan ethnic humans, both fleeing from the destruction of Halruaa during the Spellplague. In the Lowerdark reaches of the Great Bhaerynden, it was home to aboleths, cloakers, deepspawn, the mysterious slyth, and horrid wildlife, such as giant spiders and night slugs.
Following the Spellplague, drow clans displaced from Llurth Dreier wandered the Underchasm. These drow were referred to broadly as the "wild drow", a moniker born from their stubborn refusal to cooperate with each other enough to build any sort of major settlement.
Unlike settlements in the Northdark, the cities of this region interacted more closely with the cities above ground.
