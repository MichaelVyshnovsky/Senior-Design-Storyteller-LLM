'''Tyar-Besil''' was the ancient fortress-city of the [[shield dwarf]] kingdom of [[Besilmer]], built around [[−4320 DR]] under the [[Sumber Hills]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. It was eventually overrun by hordes of [[orc]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[giant]]s.

==History==
===Founding and fall===
Although the dwarfs of Besilmer had, in {{Yearlink|-4420}}, settled overground under the leadership of [[Torhild Flametongue]], they suffered constant attack from [[troll]]s and [[giant]]s, which led to the construction of the underground fortress city of Tyar-Besil around −4320 DR.

Torhild Flametongue was killed in combat against a [[hill giant]] at [[Stone Bridge]], and this led to the fleeing of the dwarves in the area, and later, to the complete abandonment of Tyar-Besil by {{Yearlink|-4160}}.

===Rediscovery===
Tyar-Besil was rediscovered in [[893 DR]] by an adventuring company called the [[Knights of the Silver Horn]]. Over the subsequent six years, the adventuring company continued to return to the ruined city, and were able to construct strongholds at the hidden entrances to Tyar-Besil in an attempt to protect it.

When the [[orc]] realm of [[Uruth Ukrypt]] gained power, leading to the [[Orcfastings War]], the First and Second [[Trollwars]], and [[drow]] raids, the human population of the [[Dessarin Valley]] was almost wiped out, and the Knights of the Silver Horn had disappeared. Their former strongholds, protecting the hidden entrances to Tyar-Besil, became known as the [[Haunted Keeps]].

===15th century===
The fortress-city was later used as a base for the four cults of the [[Elder Elemental Eye]] in [[1491 DR]].
