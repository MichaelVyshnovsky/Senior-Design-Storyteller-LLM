'''Leuthilspar''' was the capital of the island of [[Evermeet]] and lay on the east coast, situated at the mouth of the [[River Ardulith]]. An area of grassland known as the [[Greenmeadow]] lay north of the city, across the river. The [[elves]] believed that if Leuthilspar were to fall, it would bring an end to elves on [[Toril]].

==Locations==
===Buildings===
Most buildings were constructed magically, using materials from the ground to "grow" them. Some were made from [[alabaster]] or [[glass]]. Stone buildings were usually crafted from a single piece of rock. Those made from wood had roofs of magically created bark or leaves. Otherwise roofs were typically made from [[rock crystal|crystal]] or [[:Category:gems|gems]], causing them to glitter in sunlight.

Notable buildings included the [[Hall of the Ancients]], the [[Fountain of Stars]], the [[Temple of the Seldarine]], the [[Shrine of the Black Sword]], and the [[Moonstone Palace]]. Taverns included [[The Green Sword]] and [[Throleatha's Public House]].

===Harbor===
Leuthilspar's deep sheltered harbor was filled by the [[River Ardulith]]. It was guarded by the [[leviathan (creature)|leviathan]] [[Hamnuatha]]. A chain could be raised across its entrance to hinder the approach of hostile vessels. Ships docked at piers of wood or stone that were [[magic|magically]] grown upward from the sea bed. Most of the fleet was docked at [[Siiluth]], but there were usually a number of elven ships docked here.

==Infrastructure==
Many of the roads and streets of Leuthilspar were paved with crystal or gems, giving them glittering quality similar to the roofs. The main route through the city was the [[Diamond Road]], a shining smooth surface made from crystal that resembled [[diamond]]s.
