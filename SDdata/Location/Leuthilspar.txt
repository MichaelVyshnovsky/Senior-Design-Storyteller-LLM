Leuthilspar was the capital of the island of Evermeet and lay on the east coast, situated at the mouth of the River Ardulith. An area of grassland known as the Greenmeadow lay north of the city, across the river. The elves believed that if Leuthilspar were to fall, it would bring an end to elves on Toril.
Most buildings were constructed magically, using materials from the ground to "grow" them. Some were made from alabaster or glass. Stone buildings were usually crafted from a single piece of rock. Those made from wood had roofs of magically created bark or leaves. Otherwise roofs were typically made from crystal or gems, causing them to glitter in sunlight.
Notable buildings included the Hall of the Ancients, the Fountain of Stars, the Temple of the Seldarine, the Shrine of the Black Sword, and the Moonstone Palace. Taverns included The Green Sword and Throleathas Public House.
Leuthilspars deep sheltered harbor was filled by the River Ardulith. It was guarded by the leviathan Hamnuatha. A chain could be raised across its entrance to hinder the approach of hostile vessels. Ships docked at piers of wood or stone that were magically grown upward from the sea bed. Most of the fleet was docked at Siiluth, but there were usually a number of elven ships docked here.
Many of the roads and streets of Leuthilspar were paved with crystal or gems, giving them glittering quality similar to the roofs. The main route through the city was the Diamond Road, a shining smooth surface made from crystal that resembled diamonds.
