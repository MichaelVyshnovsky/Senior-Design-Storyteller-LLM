Much of Corwell was covered by the Llyrath Forest. The eastern arm of Corwell included the land between the Cambro Mountains and the Strait of Alaron up to the settlement of Thorndyke.\nCorwell was the first and oldest kingdom of the Ffolk within the Moonshaes Isles. It was founded by a Ffolk hero named Cymrych Hugh, who later became the first High King and moved his capital to Callidyrr."
