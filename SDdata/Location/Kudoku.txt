'''Kudoku''' was a rich town in [[Kozakura]] around [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Kudoku was a wealthy town thanks to its farmers and artisans, until the [[Five Deadly Shadows]] criminal organization arrived. They slowly infiltrated the city, corrupting everything.

When rumors of the corruption reached the ears of the provincial governor in 1479 DR, she sent the magistrate [[Hiro Yun]]. Step by step, Hiro efficiently shut down all the gang's operations and arrested most of it members until only the five leaders remained. At this point, Hiro challenged the assassins but in the end was defeated.{{Cite dungeon/195/The Five Deadly Shadows|1-19}}
