Nathoud  was a fortified town located in the northern region of the Hordelands bordering Rashemen.
Nathoud sat in the hill country at the feet of the southern slopes of the Icerim Mountains.
Wood was used in the construction of Nathoud since stone-working was little known in the region. The buildings of Nathoud were typically two stories tall and had large overhanging eaves with gently sloping roofs. Elaborate carvings decorated most buildings.
The Myir, a clan of Nars, originally built the town when they came to settle, since they could not compete with the fierce Khassadi horsemen of the region.
The Myir of Nathoud were famous for their breeding of the Nathoudi stallion. A yearly horse fair was held in Nathoud. Vendors interested in selling horses during this time needed to apply for a license. Races were held where vendors and horse-breeders could show off their prized animals.
