'''Nathoud ''' was a fortified town located in the northern region of the [[Hordelands]] bordering [[Rashemen]].

==Description==
Nathoud sat in the hill country at the feet of the southern slopes of the [[Icerim Mountains]].

Wood was used in the construction of Nathoud since stone-working was little known in the region. The buildings of Nathoud were typically two stories tall and had large overhanging eaves with gently sloping roofs. Elaborate carvings decorated most buildings.

==Inhabitants==
The [[Myir]], a clan of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]], originally built the town when they came to settle, since they could not compete with the fierce [[Khassadi]] horsemen of the region.

The Myir of Nathoud were famous for their breeding of the [[Nathoudi stallion]]. A yearly horse fair was held in Nathoud. Vendors interested in selling horses during this time needed to apply for a license. Races were held where vendors and horse-breeders could show off their prized animals.
