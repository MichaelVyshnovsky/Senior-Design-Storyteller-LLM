        "mainbody": "The Cavern of the Jackal was a massive temple dedicated to Set, the Defiler of the Dead within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThe Cavern lay beneath the city of Sampranasz in western Mulhorand.\nThe natural cavern extended far below the Alamber Sea. Various tunnels within the cavern were believed to connect to Red Haven in Unther. Massive stone colossi with jackal heads were found at every entrance into the cavern, giving the location its name.\nNearly 1,500 of Sets followers lived within the cave system and horded weapons, armor, and treasures.\nThe stone colossi were actually large animated stone golems that protected the temple from intrusion."
