        "Description": "The city of Rassatan was situated on the steep cliffs of the bowl-shaped Rassatan Bay that gave the settlement its name.\n\nMost buildings and habitats in Rassatan were carved into the walls of the basin. A typical home was a burrow with its entrance on the city's terraced walls.",

        "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Phelpar]], a [[wizard]] who feuded with [[Selvar]] of [[Taruin]], who lived some time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n*[[Redfeyer]], a street performer who ventured into the [[Singing Caverns]] east of Rassatan and barely scraped with his life in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
