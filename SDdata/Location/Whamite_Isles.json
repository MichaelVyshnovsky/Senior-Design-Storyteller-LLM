        "mainbody": "The Whamite Isles was an archipelago of islands in the southern Sea of Fallen Stars. Once the home of a number of warring states, the fun was over when in the , almost everyone who lived there drowned themselves and became undead.\nThe Whamite Isles were located some  southeast of Myth Nantar. They were connected to the lower part of the undersea Lesser Hmur Plateau.\nThe economy of the Whamite Isles revolved around gold, which was mined all over the Isles. They traded with lands in other parts of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Caravans passed through trade routes along the Isles, but were sometimes attacked by pirates.\nBefore disaster struck them, the Whamite Isles were populated with many small nations who sought to conquer each other by whatever means necessary.\nIn early Marpenoth of the , as part of the Twelfth Ser√¥s War, Iakhovas summoned a powerful variant of kelpie to surround the Whamite Isles. The powerful charm powers of the kelpies caused 95% of the inhabitants of the Isles to drown themselves in the ocean, returning as drowned ones. These sea zombies, now a part of Iakhovass army, were sent to attack Voalidru. The Whamite Isles subsequently became the location in the Sea of Fallen Stars with the most undead creatures. \nBy the , after the mass suicide of its inhabitants, the Whamite Isles had become dangerous and the ports of Agenais and Garhunclen were known to be abandoned.  Ships like those from Turmish did not visit the Isles at all. Some feared that visitors to the Isles would also be compelled to drown themselves in the sea of stars. However, many ships sent by the Emerald Enclave from the Vilhon Reach used unknown methods to avoid the danger of the kelpies and staked a claim to the Whamite Isles. \n* Agenais\n* Bolgor\n* The Cold Desert\n* Graubunden\n* Inter Mierionydd\n* Isle Broddick\n* Kloccbarn\n* Land of the Beastly Brigands\n* Penbroc\n* Swil\n* Veldergauttland\n* The Walled City\n* Wolfenbutte\n* Zagrus"
