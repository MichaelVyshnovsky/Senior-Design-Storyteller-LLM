        "Geography": "The Whamite Isles were located some {{SIrange|35|40|mi|k}} southeast of [[Myth Nantar]]. They were connected to the lower part of the undersea [[Lesser Hmur Plateau]].",
        "Economy": "The economy of the Whamite Isles revolved around [[gold]], which was mined all over the Isles. They traded with lands in other parts of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Caravans passed through trade routes along the Isles, but were sometimes attacked by pirates.",
        "History": "Before disaster struck them, the Whamite Isles were populated with many small nations who sought to conquer each other by whatever means necessary.\n\nIn early [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, as part of the [[Twelfth Ser√¥s War]], [[Iakhovas]] summoned a powerful variant of [[kelpie]] to surround the Whamite Isles. The powerful ''charm'' powers of the kelpies caused 95% of the inhabitants of the Isles to drown themselves in the ocean, returning as [[drowned one]]s. These sea zombies, now a part of Iakhovas's army, were sent to attack [[Voalidru]]. The Whamite Isles subsequently became the location in the Sea of Fallen Stars with the most [[undead]] creatures. \n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, after the mass suicide of its inhabitants, the Whamite Isles had become dangerous and the ports of [[Agenais]] and [[Garhunclen]] were known to be abandoned.  Ships like those from [[Turmish]] did not visit the Isles at all. Some feared that visitors to the Isles would also be compelled to drown themselves in the sea of stars. However, many ships sent by the [[Emerald Enclave]] from the [[Vilhon Reach]] used unknown methods to avoid the danger of the kelpies and staked a claim to the Whamite Isles.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Agenais]]\n* [[Bolgor]]\n* [[The Cold Desert]]\n* [[Graubunden]]\n* [[Inter Mierionydd]]\n* [[Isle Broddick]]\n* [[Kloccbarn]]\n* [[Land of the Beastly Brigands]]\n* [[Penbroc]]\n* [[Swil]]\n* [[Veldergauttland]]\n* The [[Walled City]]\n* [[Wolfenbutte]]\n* [[Zagrus]]"
