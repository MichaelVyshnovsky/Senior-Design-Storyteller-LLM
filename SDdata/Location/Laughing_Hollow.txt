The Laughing Hollow was a preternatural valley found in the Delimbiyr Vale region of the Savage Frontier. It was a realm of fey creatures and wild elves.
It was located upriver from Daggerford in the western stretch of the Vale.
The dense trees and shade from the nearby elevations created a near-continuous atmosphere that resembled a days twilight.
Within the Laughing Hollow were a number of welcoming glades and small pools of water.
The region of the hollow was once quarry land used by the dwarves during the time of the Fallen Kingdom.
Rumors stated that there was a hidden passageway beneath the the Laughing Hollow. It was said that it led to an ancient, underground dwarfhold full of treasure.
As of the midâ€“14 century DR, the forests of the hollow were inhabited by a band of wild elves. They were led by an individual known as the King of the Woods.
