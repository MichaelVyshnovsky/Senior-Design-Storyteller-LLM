Earls Bridge was one of the two drawbridges that crossed the Clear Whirl River to Castle Hartwick.
Earls Bridge was the eastern drawbridge to Castle Hartwick. The bridge rested on two flying buttresses. It was not strong enough to carry more than a single full-sized giant at a time.
A small watchhouse carved into the stone of the cliff at the rivers edge contained three halberd-bearing sentries. Two giants from the Giant Guard also manned the bridge.
