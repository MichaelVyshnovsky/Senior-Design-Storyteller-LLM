        "mainbody": "Tegals Mark was the most widely known tassel, located near Rauthauvyrs Road, which served as the de facto capital of Tasseldale. \nWhile Tegals Mark was not particularly large, it was quite a vision. The picturesque town was set between two wooded hills, surrounded by a garden. There were three major landmarks that were visible from the Tasselway road entering the town. These were two large houses on the south-eastern hill and an elven watchtower.\nThe town of Tegals Mark was founded around 1187 DR by the renowned swordsmith named Tegal. His forge, also named \"Tegals Mark\" was the landmark around which the town grew. His apprentices took on the tradition of stamping their blades with his personal \"mark\", a tradition that continued well into the 14 century.\n* Sharburg A re-purposed elven watchtower that served as the seat of power for the Grand Mairshar and housed the Mairshar forces.
