The Pearl Cities were a group of wealthy Zakharan seaports found in west Zakhara. 
The Cities of the Pearl hugged the coast of the Crowded Sea and the western shores of the Golden Gulf in the shadows of the High Desert.
These cities–Ajayib, Gana, Jumlat, Sikak, and Tajar–focused on a lucrative trade mainly in luxury goods, with Jumlats and Ganas production of pearls providing the name for the whole group. Haggling and money-making were as important to the inhabitants as the Law of the Loregiver. While all Cities of the Pearl featured richly decorated manors of the wealthy, the poor inhabitants were an even more common sight in their streets.
Successful merchants here amassed wealth beyond even that of the Caliphs of the Free Cities of Zakhara or elsewhere in the Land of Fate. The small population of wealthy merchants was vastly outnumbered by a population of exploited Zakharans living in poverty. Wealthy Zakharans in the Pearl Cities enjoyed flaunting their success, often holding lavish parties for insignificant reasons. As a whole the people here were said to rival genies in their cunning.
