'''Northeast Faerûn''', referred to in large part as the '''Demonlands''', comprising large portions of the [[Cold Lands]] and [[Unapproachable East]],{{Template:Cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)/A Grand Tour of the Realms|116}} was a remote area of the continent of [[Faerûn]]. It began in the cold, forbidding lands along the great ice sheets and continued south toward the northeastern shores of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It was bordered on the west by the mountain-hemmed land of [[Vaasa]] and stretched east to the vast steppes of the [[Hordelands]].

==Regions==
===Cold Lands===
{{Main|Cold Lands}}
These lands comprised the dry, cold, and sparsely-populated regions surrounding the [[Great Glacier]]. They were largely insulated from the rest of Faerûn and seldom drew in visitors, save for those folks from nearby nations.{{Template:Cite book/Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|11}}
* [[Narfell]]: A land of dry, cold grasslands to the north of the Great Dale, it was bordered on the west by Damara and on the east by [[Rashemen]]. Most of the sparse population were hardy barbarian nomads, struggling to survive in this harsh region. The most notable feature was the large [[Icelace Lake]]. It was said that once a great nation rose here, but it was destroyed in a war with their enemies, the kingdom of [[Raumathar]].
* [[Sossal]]: This small nation maintained good trade relationships with the neighboring lands but remained insulated from the rest of the Realms.{{Template:Cite book/Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|12}}{{Template:Cite book/Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|149}}
Long at war with one another, the two realms of the [[Bloodstone Lands]] united as a [[Kingdom of Bloodstone|single kingdom]] for many years before being thrown into turmoil once again. It earned its name from the ''[[bloodstone|rich veins of ore]]'' that ran through the [[Galena Mountains]].{{fact}}
* [[Damara]]: While it was always a rugged, frozen frontier that beckoned forth many adventurers, the kingdom enjoyed great prosperity for many years until it fell under tyrannical rule during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The capital city of [[Helgabal]], formerly [[Heliogabalus]], lay in the middle of the nation at the confluence of two rivers.
* [[Vaasa]]: The isolated moors, bogs, and tundra of Vaasa were situated just south of the Great Glacier, encircled by the Galena Mountains,. It was perhaps well known for the presence of [[Castle Perilous]], once home of the great [[Zhengyi|Witch-King]].

===Great Dale===
{{Main|Great Dale}}
This coastal land was dominated by the large forests of [[Rawlinswood]] to the north and the [[Forest of Lethyr]] to the south. The [[Great Road]] ran along this gap, starting at the coastal city of [[Uthmere]] on the [[Easting Reach]] of the Sea of Fallen Stars. This was the most populous area of this land, with only scattered settlements further east.{{Fact}}

===Unapproachable East===
{{Main|Unapproachable East}}
* [[Impiltur]]: This prosperous nation located on the west coast of the [[Easting Reach]] existed as a peaceful kingdom for centuries, home to a line of kings and crusaders that repeatedly defended the region from the forces of darkness.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}} Unfortunately it was overrun by [[demon]]ic incursions and plagued with internal strife during the [[Era of Upheaval]]. Following the [[Great Rain]] that accompanied the [[Second Sundering]], Impiltur regained its status as a great trading presence in the northeast, and began to earn back some of its former glory.
* [[Rashemen]]: The cold and wild northern nation in the was home to [[Rashemaar berserkers|famous berserker warriors]] and the powerful, revered [[Wychlaran]]. It was a place of spirits of nature, and a land mostly untamed. Among its scattered settlements were [[Mulptan]], [[Mulsantir]], and the capital city of [[Immilmar]], home to the [[Iron Lord]].
* [[Thesk]]: The "Gateway to the East" was situated on the far western stretch of the [[Golden Way]], the great road that connect the Realms of [[Faerûn]] to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]]. The residents of these confederated settlements enjoyed free trade and little judgement among their people. They were just as welcoming to all human ethnicities, as they were to [[goblin]]s and even [[orc]]s.{{Template:Cite book/Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|13}}

===Hordelands===
{{Main|Hordelands}}
Lying outside Faerûn proper, this vast region of barren steppes stretched far to the east, reaching the distant land of Kara-Tur. It was populated by nomadic horse riders and expert bowmen of the [[Tuigan]] people. The region had no permanent settlements, but served as a trade route between Faerûn and Kara-Tur. It used to be part of the kingdom of [[Raumathar]] and the present-day [[Raumviran]] were believed to descend from the inhabitants of that kingdom.

===Pelvuria===
{{Main|Great Glacier}}
The northernmost stretch of the region housed lands of Pelvuria, known to most as the Great Glacier. A frozen landscape of tundra, ice, snow, and more ice, and the [[Ulutiun]] peoples. 

===Auril's Teeth===
{{Main|Auril's Teeth}}
During the 15{{th}} century DR, the snowy and infertile tundra that comprised Pelvuria, Sossal, and the dangerous lands "at the top of the world"&mdash;known as the [[Auril's Teeth#Frostfell|Frostfell]]&mdash;were referred to by some scholars as Auril's Teeth.
