The '''Easting Coast''' was a region of [[Impiltur]] located south of the [[Earthfast Mountains]], along the southern banks of the [[Easting Reach]], where it opened up into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It was the home of four great city-states whose unification resulted in the founding of the Impilturan kingdom.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

==Description==
The coastline was a verdant and pastoral stretch of land, full of winding streams and creeks that flowed down from the mountains down into the sea. It was ideal for agriculture and rich with orchards and farms that were abundant with cereal crops and plots lined with tubers and other root vegetables. 

The coast was abundant with wildlife and game. A great number of red-striped deer and mountain goals grazed the foothills of the Earthfasts.

==Activities==
Traffic along the [[Royal Road]] was  somewhat busy with trade caravans and traveling vendors. The foothills of the Earthfasts, which continued south to [[Agmoth]] county, were active with merchants and ore-traders that came down from the mines to the north.

==Notable Locations==
In addition to its' great cities the Easting Coast was dotted with pleasant hamlets and farmsteads.

;Regions:
* [[Agmoth|Agmoth County]]: This small stretch of land, nestled in the foothills of the [[Earthfast Mountains]], served as an important locale for ore-merchants who transported their goods from the mines.{{Cite dungeon/137/Man Forever}}

;Cities:
* [[Dilpur]]: This moderately-sized trading city experienced a great population boom during the mid-14{{th}} century, but fell 
* [[Filur]]: The former Impilturan capital was sacked during the [[Prince's Revolt]] in the [[1295 DR|Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR]]. In the following decades it lost most of its prestige but remained a rural summer-home for the royal family.
* [[Hlammach]]: The great sea port of Impiltur was a densely-populated metropolis that was tasked with minting the Impilturan currency.
* [[Lyrabar]]: While the great coastal city of Lyrabar boasted a grand armada and a renowned [[magic]]al academy, it was devastated by the geographical upheaval brought upon by the [[Spellplague]] and struggled to hold on to its former glory after being inundated with criminal organizations and thieves.
* [[New Sarshel]]: Despite being devastated by war, Sarshel was a exemplar of fortitude and forged through difficult years. The merchants of the city led recovery efforts that elevated New Sarshel as an illustrious center of trade, home to many Impiltur's greatest sites and attractions.

;Other settlements:
* [[Klandle]]:{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows}}
* [[Mistrenpost]]:
* [[Moranay]]: This dreary town was rather unremarkable, but had been infiltrated by a coven of [[hag]]s during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Ondle's Spur]]:
* [[Red Bluffs]]: This small village was among the numerous fishing communities of the Easting Coast.
* [[Thelnarm]]: Along with the fishermen from other coastal settlements, the citizens of Thelnarm used small skiffs to fish the waters of the Reach.
