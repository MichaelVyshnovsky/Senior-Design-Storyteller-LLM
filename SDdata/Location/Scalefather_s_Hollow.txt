Scalefathers Hollow was a winding cave found within the Vilebog swamp on Pirates Skyhold.
The hollow comprised a natural cave formation whose tunnels were added onto by non-naturally-occurring influences. Wooden support beams could be found alongside the caves moss-covered walls just as often as massive tree roots that extended underground from the swamp above.
The ceilings of the cave had many openings, allowing streams of water to trickle down from the wetlands, pooling within the cavern floor. A scant few of these holes allowed for columns of light to shine within, providing limited illumination in certain areas.
It was located in the southwest stretch of Vilebog, just west of the crash site of the Magisters Hope skyship.
Scalefathers Hollow was raided by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge in the , while under the employ of Company Yargo mercenary group.
The cave was named after the Scalefather, the shaman of the lizardfolk tribe that made their home within Vilebog swamp.
