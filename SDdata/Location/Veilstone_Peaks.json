        "Description": "The Veilstone Peaks were located to the northwest of [[Cormyr]], approximately {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} west of the [[Farsea Marshes]]. It was a desolate region populated by a handful of impoverished villages.",
        "Geography": {
            "Flora & Fauna": "The region features small woodlands comprised of [[oak]] and [[birch]] trees. The rocky soil in the area was inhospitable to plant life.",
            "Climate": "The Veilstone Peaks region was characterized by its cool and dry atmosphere. Daytime temperatures ranged from the high 60s (about 15–20°C) to the mid-40s Fahrenheit (about 4–9 °C), while nighttime temperatures often fell to the high 30s Fahrenheit (about 3–4°C)."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The villages situated within the Veilstone Peaks were among the poorest in the region, primarily due to their scarce natural resources and their remote location, far from principal trade arteries. Connectivity was primarily through trails, and the villages generally remained insular, with minimal interaction between themselves or with the external world.\n\nA standard village in this area was essentially a cluster of rudimentary homes, constructed from wood and stone, and containing a single room. Additionally, there were a few unassuming shops and storage facilities. Despite their lack of sophistication, the villagers were known for their honesty, amiability, and industrious nature, endeavoring to eke out a living from their diminutive farms.\n\nThe population of these villages was entirely [[human]]. With the notable exception of [[Garnerr]], governance in each village was provided by a constable or sheriff. These officials were elected by the villagers and possessed qualities that distinguished them from their fellow villagers, reflecting their exceptional status."
