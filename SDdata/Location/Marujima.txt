'''Marujima''' was an island located in [[Kozakura]].

==Geography==
Located in the [[Inland Sea]], Marujima was found near the northern coast of [[Miyama Province]].

==Inhabitants==
Marujima was uninhabited. Along the coastal cliffs, sea birds made their nests. Sea turtles made nests on the northern beaches. [[Crab]] and [[lobster]] were found in great numbers around the island and that made Marujima a popular fishing spot for fishermen from Miyama. [[Ningyo]] were often seen in the shallows around the island.
