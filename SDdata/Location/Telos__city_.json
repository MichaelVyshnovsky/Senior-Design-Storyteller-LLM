        "mainbody": "Telos City, also called simply Telos, was the largest and newest city in Vaasa in the late 15 century DR. It served as the realms capital and the seat of power for the evil Warlock Knights.\nTelos City sat just north of the cliffs above the Beaumaris River in the central Vaasan highlands, and just south of the Cinnabar Wastes. It connected to Vaasas main road, Dead Mans Walk, via a bridge which spanned the 500 foot (150 meter) deep Razacks Scar canyon to the south. \nThe city center was situated inside of a blast crater that was a half-mile (805 meters) across and over  deep.\nThe city and the surrounding realm were overseen by the Ironfell Council, which was comprised of the twelve most powerful landowning Warlock Knights from across Vaasa. They were led in deliberations by the enigmatic Voice of Telos, who served as the absolute ruler of the city. The Council convened in the centrally located Citadel of the Iron Sky for five days each month to consider state matters.\nThe Warlock Knights enforced a strict social and racial hierarchy with themselves at the top. Beneath the Knights were the common folk, referred to as serfs. Beneath the serfs were the \"scamps,\" a derogatory term for members of smaller races. Finally, at the bottom of the hierarchy were the slaves.\nNo gods had temples in the city, and the people were not permitted to worship them. Instead, veneration of the primordial Telos was practiced, with quasi-religious services held in the Citadel of the Iron Sky. This and similar shrines dedicated to Telos were maintained by a sect of powerful warlocks called the Luminaries.\nTelos was as much a fortress as it was a city, with high defensive walls, many protective wards and spells, and a garrison of hardened Warlock Knights. In addition, a dozen storm giants loyal to the Voice of Telos watched over the city from a cloud palace that circled above.\nWhen the primordial Telos fell from the sky during the Spellplague, the future Voice of Telos was the first to discover the location of its comatose body. With the power gained from this encounter, the Voice founded the Warlock Knights, and at the Voices behest, Telos City was built atop the impact crater where Telos lay. The Warlock Knights would go forth to conquer Vaasa by 1470 DR, and Telos City swelled to become the biggest settlement in Vaasa as the many people displaced by the Knights conquest ironically found themselves seeking shelter within their oppressors walls.\nVisitors to Telos were forbidden to visit the city center without special permission. \nAreas which were off-limits to visitors included\n*Citadel of the Iron Sky, which served as a defensive castle, the center of government, and the primary site of Telos veneration in the city. It contained separate suites and living quarters for each member of the Ironfell Council. The primordial Telos was said to be buried directly beneath the Citadel. The Warlock Knights mined ironfell from the primordials body, a metal-like substance which was the focus of their powers and the primary material used in making their weapons and armor.\nVisitors were permitted free access to locations in the citys outer areas, including\n*Iron Flagon, a mostly reputable tavern.\n*Red Dog, a tavern.\n*Aldermanâ€™s Hall, a boarding house.\n*Bronze Windlass, an inn.\n*The Scamp Warrens, a neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of the city that was considered largely lawless and which was occupied mostly by humanoids of smaller races. It was rumored to be home to a thriving black market in which contraband weapons and armor made from ironfell could be found.\nMany of the citys inhabitants had come to Telos after losing their their homes during the Warlock Knights conquest of Vaasa. As of 1480 DR, the city housed 15,000 people, of which 60% were Vaasan humans and 20% were dwarves. The remainder was made up of orcs and \"scamps\" (referring mostly to goblins, kobolds, and halflings), as well as the occasional giant. The majority of non-humans in Telos were slaves or conscripted soldiers."
