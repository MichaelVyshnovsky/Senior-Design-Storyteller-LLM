        "History": "Before it was named Wood of Sharp Teeth, it was called Glimmerwood by the [[elves]] of [[Askavar]], who no longer lived there by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nSome time between [[409 DR]] and [[516 DR]], a [[spelljammer]] crashed in this forest and was discovered by [[Eldrus Wands]]. Out of amusement, the [[magister]] preceded to take command of the ship and piloted it into the depths of the [[Lake of the Long Arm]].\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], the [[Twisted Rune]] had placed a magical ''[[gate]]'' in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.\n\nFor a brief period in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the forest was known as the '''Werewoods'''. Former [[Grand Duke]] [[Valarken]] was rumored to live there after his failed coup in [[Baldur's Gate]]. He and his [[lycanthrope]] followers were trying to rebuild Vehlarr.",
