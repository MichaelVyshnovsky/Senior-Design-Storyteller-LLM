        "mainbody": "The Wood of Sharp Teeth, formerly called the Glimmerwood, was a dense forest south of the River Chionthar, southeast of Baldurs Gate and southwest of Scornubel. It was a wilderness except for Durlags Tower on the forests southern edge. Uldoon Trail ran to the south east of the wood.\nThe forest contained the site of the ruined (as of 1374 DR) city of Vehlarr.\nA small logging settlement of Hornhollow stood at the edge of the Wood of Sharp Teeth. At some point before 1312 DR, the village was visited by a senile coughing red dragon that lit it aflame. With the creatures death, the logging operations resumed.\nTwo types of common medicinal herbs could be found growing within the forest maidens milk that was used to suppress cough, and bellows root that caused vomiting.\nBefore it was named Wood of Sharp Teeth, it was called Glimmerwood by the elves of Askavar, who no longer lived there by the 14 century DR.\nSome time between 409 DR and 516 DR, a spelljammer crashed in this forest and was discovered by Eldrus Wands. Out of amusement, the magister preceded to take command of the ship and piloted it into the depths of the Lake of the Long Arm.\nBy 1369 DR, the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.\nFor a brief period in the 15 century DR, the forest was known as the Werewoods. Former Grand Duke Valarken was rumored to live there after his failed coup in Baldurs Gate. He and his lycanthrope followers were trying to rebuild Vehlarr.\nThe forest was home to satyrs, dryads, and a small number of werewolves, and some believe wolfweres also dwelt within.\n* Pallidor the Swift, who contributed to Oral Histories of Faer√ªn."
