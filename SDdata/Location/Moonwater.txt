The Moonwater was a temple of Selûne in the town of Ylraphon in the Vast.
In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR, it was quite a small temple, tended to by only five clerics, including their leader, Catalan Bree.
The Moonwater housed a number of magic items related to the moon, mostly gifted by elves leaving the area in the 14th century DR or dating back to when Ylraphon was an elven city.
