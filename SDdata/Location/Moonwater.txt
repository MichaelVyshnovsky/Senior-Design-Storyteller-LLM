The '''Moonwater''' was a temple of [[Selûne]] in the town of [[Ylraphon]] in [[the Vast]].

==Organization==
In [[1367 DR|the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], it was quite a small temple, tended to by only five [[cleric]]s, including their leader, [[Catalan Bree]].

==Features==
The Moonwater housed a number of [[magic item]]s related to the [[moon]], mostly gifted by elves leaving the area in the 14th century DR or dating back to when Ylraphon was an elven city.
