        "mainbody": "he Rauvin Vale was a valley dominated by the River Rauvin in Luruar.\nThe Rauvin Vale was bordered by the Nether Mountains to the north, the High Forest (Turlangs Wood) to the south, Everlund Pass and the Silverwood to the west, and Moon Pass to the east. The fold-out map included in the Silver Marches sourcebook labels the area between the Nether Mountains and the High Forest the \"Upper Rauvin Vale.\" The same map labels the area along the Rauvin River west of Silverymoon the \"Lower Rauvin Vale.\" However, the sourcebook itself refers only to the \"Rauvin Vale.\" The novel Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf states that Lhuvenhead was the largest settlement in the Rauvin Vale (page 329), indicating that only the area between the Nether Mountains and the High Forest should be considered the Rauvin Vale.\nCommunities of humans, elves, goblins, orcs, and ogres dwelt in the vale. In the 14th century DR, trolls uprooted from their homes in the Evermoors often wandered into the Rauvin Vale in search of new lairs.\nCommon wildlife in the Rauvin Vale were brown bears, deer, elk, roth√©, red tiger, and wolves. Dire bears, dire wolves, dire rats, worgs, wereboars, and werewolves were occasionally spotted.\n* River Rauvin\n* Everlund Pass\n* Silverwood\n* Staunt Pools\n* Striding Giant Rapids\n* Everlund\n* High Hold\n* Hilltop\n* Jalanthar\n* Lhuvenhead\n* Rauvincross\n* Rivermoot\n* Trail between Everlund and Sundabar"
