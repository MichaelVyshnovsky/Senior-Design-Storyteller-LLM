'''Dirs''', or the '''Jaw-Tooth''', was a rocky island located in the [[Nada al-Hazan]] achipelago within the [[Crowded Sea]].

==Geography==
This island was covered with rocky outcroppings and dried [[grass]]es, making in rather inhospitable to humans.

==Inhabitants==
This island was home to a group of skilled hunting [[falcon]]s. These falcons were so prized that they were given as gifts to sultans, caliphs, and even kings beyond the borders of [[Zakhara]].

No settlements were found on the island of Dirs because of the presence of the hunting birds' fierce protectors: the [[maskhi]]. The maskhi only trusted the Ben Nabil family from [[Bandar al-Sa'adat]]. Once per year they were allowed to collect a few of the falcons and train them.
