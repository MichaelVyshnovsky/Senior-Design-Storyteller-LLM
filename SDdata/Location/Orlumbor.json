        "mainbody": "rlumbor () was a small rocky barren island city-state in the Sea of Swords.\nOrlumbors mainland-facing natural harbor was the main populated area of the island. It was built by being cut into the islands rocks in a similar fashion to the homes of its many shipwrights. The settlements buildings were cave-like structures and complexes connected by a complex chain of tunnels and stair flights. The docks and harbors of Orlumbor seemingly were always filled with workers.\nThe settlement was located due west of the Trollbark Forest between Daggerford and Baldurs Gate and 300 miles south of the free city of Waterdeep, on the Sword Coast. Few people visited the city, in part because of its treacherous harbor.\nDespite its size, the island nation was independent and influential, in part due to its skilled, in-demand shipwrights who specialized in salt-water vessels..\nOrlumbor was an unassuming island inhabited by goat-herders, fishers, and some of the most renowned and skilled shipwrights in all Faerûn. The island produced some of the best quality ocean-faring ships in all Northwest Faerûn, found in many places across the region. Many oceanic vessels of the north originated on Orlumbor, and most had been repaired on the island at least once. These ships were known for their sturdy hulls, and construction timeframes varied by the ordered ships size. Small merchant vessels took two months to complete, large trade ships – six months, and a fearsome warship took four months or more to construct.\nOrlumbor was closely allied with the city of Baldurs Gate, owing it much. It also retained its independence thanks to Waterdeeps patronage and protection.\nLong before the 14 century DR, Orlumbor was a wooded island, but it had been all logged by the . Throughout the years, Orlumbor engaged in conflicts with another island nation – Mintarn, before the Tyrant took hold. Orlumbor survived these conflicts through Waterdeeps aid.\nThe  was a tragic year. Orlumbor was home to a hin settlement called Marrduin, and in 310 DR, a creature from the Lower planes, a six-legged monstrosity named Gorathil, decimated the halflings.\nIn the , the skies over Orlumbor exploded in fireworks of a magical battle between the black dragon named Starlaurynguldar and a Magister of Mystra, Ohland Grethgar. The long and spectacular battle resulted in the mutual destruction of both parties.\nIn the , Orlumbor was besieged in a surprise naval attack by ships that flew the flags of Waterdeep. The islands leader at the time – Tulgar Wrighttson, believed that the island fell to a treacherous betrayal by a trusted ally, but with the help of the Heroes of Ascore, it was revealed that the Waterdhavian ships were, in reality, conniving pirates.\nAt one point, closer to the 14 century, Orlumbor had conflicts with Baldurs Gate and the nation of Amn, but by the , Baldurs Gate became a close ally to Orlumbor.\n*Farr Windward, a small settlement with the population strictly limited to outcasts, eccentrics, and their descendants, from many cities of the Sword Coast located southwest of the city-state of Orlumbor.\n*Orlumbor Magic Shop, a simple merchant of magical miscellany.\n*Rojorans House of Arms, one of the city-states shops.\n*Stormhaven House, a temple dedicated to Umberlee, the Bitch Queen that traditionally sent its representatives to Waterdeep to lead the celebrations of the annual Fleetswake.\n*Swinging Hammock, a dockside inn in the city-state of Orlumbor.\n*Temple of Gond, a temple dedicated to Gond Wonderbringer.\n*Temple of Talos, a hidden shrine dedicated to Talos in the city-state of Orlumbor, used by the Kraken-Hosttower-Zhentil alliance in the mid-14 century DR.\n*The Sword Coast Traders, a general shop that specialized in adventuring gear.\n*Tunnels of Orlumbor, a rocky tunnel way that led southwest from Orlumbor, occasionally known to be threatened by the islands rock reptiles, kamfults, vilstraks, ogres, and bulettes.\n*A magical gate hidden in a cave on Orlumbor connected the island to a wooded lot in the city of Neverwinter. The gate was activated by touching carvings of crescent moons in a specific order.\n*Delshara Windhair, a magess known as the Witch of the Waves whose spells swept away entire ships of the attackers from  the Pirate Isles and Luskan in the 14 century DR.\n*Lhammaruntosz, the bronze dragon, also known as The Claws of the Coast, who laired atop mountains in Orlumbors bowl-valley as of the 14 century DR.\n*Starlaurynguldar, a black dragon who called Orlumbor his home before being slain in 1282 DR."
