'''Minsorran''' was a small theocratic realm on [[Lake Weng]] in [[Amn]] known as the '''Lands of Balance''', founded during the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]].{{Cite web/More of Waterdeep and Lands of Intrigue}}

==Geography==
Minsorran was built on the shore of Lake Weng (then called the Lake of Amin) below the [[Cloud Peaks]] at an altitude of {{SI|1500|ft|long=yes}}.

==History==
The region had long been part of the [[Calim Empire]] and its successors, but urban [[human]] settlement only arose in the centuries following [[100 DR]] during which [[Athkatla]], [[Crimmor]], and [[Murann]] were founded.

Minsorran was founded in the {{YearlinkName|300}} during the height of the [[Shoon Imperium]] by the followers of [[Selûne]], [[Shar]], [[Lathander]], and [[Mystra]]. These faithful lived in harmony with each other and respected their collective pantheon as they built a theocracy in [[Minsor Vale]] and three other cities, in an uncommon practice that more resembled the religious governments of [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]] than that of western [[Faerûn]].

In the {{YearlinkName|347}}, the emperor [[Shoon VII]] gave governorship of the region around the Lake of Amin to [[Thealnak]] of [[Memnon]] as a reward for creating the ''[[Codex Thealnakkar]]''. This political development had little effect on the Lands of Balance.

Discontented [[Selûnite]]s broke from Minsor Vale in the {{YearlinkName|390}} and founded [[Myth Lharast]] hundreds of miles away, seeking to worship Selûne in a manner that involved fewer Sharrans.

The collapse of the surrounding Shoon Imperium and the rise of competing successor states in [[450 DR]] had little effect on Minsorran.

Minsorran ceased to exist in the {{YearlinkName|600}} during a harsh midwinter blizzard when the entire population apparently vanished without a trace. The cause was actually the [[white dragon]] [[Icehauptannarthanyx]], who laired in [[Mount Speartop]] and kept his existence secret.

All four cities of the realm fell to ruin, though Minsor Vale was eventually resettled with a small village amid the larger ruins. The other three ruins remained uninhabited.
