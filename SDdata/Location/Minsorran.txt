Minsorran was a small theocratic realm on Lake Weng in Amn known as the Lands of Balance, founded during the time of the Shoon Imperium.
Minsorran was built on the shore of Lake Weng (then called the Lake of Amin) below the Cloud Peaks at an altitude of .
The region had long been part of the Calim Empire and its successors, but urban human settlement only arose in the centuries following 100 DR during which Athkatla, Crimmor, and Murann were founded.
Minsorran was founded in the  during the height of the Shoon Imperium by the followers of Sel没ne, Shar, Lathander, and Mystra. These faithful lived in harmony with each other and respected their collective pantheon as they built a theocracy in Minsor Vale and three other cities, in an uncommon practice that more resembled the religious governments of Unther and Mulhorand than that of western Faer没n.
In the , the emperor Shoon VII gave governorship of the region around the Lake of Amin to Thealnak of Memnon as a reward for creating the Codex Thealnakkar. This political development had little effect on the Lands of Balance.
Discontented Sel没nites broke from Minsor Vale in the  and founded Myth Lharast hundreds of miles away, seeking to worship Sel没ne in a manner that involved fewer Sharrans.
The collapse of the surrounding Shoon Imperium and the rise of competing successor states in 450 DR had little effect on Minsorran.
Minsorran ceased to exist in the  during a harsh midwinter blizzard when the entire population apparently vanished without a trace. The cause was actually the white dragon Icehauptannarthanyx, who laired in Mount Speartop and kept his existence secret.
All four cities of the realm fell to ruin, though Minsor Vale was eventually resettled with a small village amid the larger ruins. The other three ruins remained uninhabited.
