'''Dlusk''' was a small town in [[Aglarond]], near the mouth of the [[River Umber]] on the southeastern shores of the [[Sea of Dlurg]].

==Description==
It was a [[fish]]ing town of narrow streets, busy markets, and weathered [[wood]]en buildings in the typical Aglarondan style. As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, its population was almost one thousand.

==Geography==
Dlusk was built on a major trade way that crossed the entire Aglarondan peninsula's northern side, from the city of [[Emmech]], to [[Ingdal's Arm]] and beyond. Emmech was located northeast of Dlusk, the town of [[Mesring]] – to the southeast, and [[Osker]] – to the west along the shore of the Sea of Dlurg.

==Trade==
Its harbor was filled with over a hundred vessels. It held an annual spring festival that included feasts, parades, performances, and contests, which brought visitors from across Aglarond and neighboring places like [[Thesk]] and [[Chessenta]]. During the festival, the town's inns and taverns were open day and night, entertaining and feeding the festival goers.

Not surprisingly, Dlusk was fed by the bounty of the Sea of Dlurg, one of the most abundant sources of fish across the entire [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

Inhabitants of Dlusk followed the fashion typical for eastern Aglarond. Similarly to the towns of Osker and [[Furthinghome]], [[human]]s of Dlusk bright colors. Their [[tunic]]s and [[trouser]]s were woven and embroidered with black floral patterns of [[vine]]s, [[rose]]s, and more abstract patterns. The jewelry worn in Dlusk was typically [[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[ring]]s, [[circlet]]s, [[necklace]]s, [[earring]]s, and [[bracelet]]s.

==History==
Sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, Dlusk's busy markets were frequented by [[Brenna Graycloak]], a political and a [[Harper]] agent of Aglarond.

==Notable Inhabitants==
*[[Old Gebe]], a colorful personality and a [[mule]] connoisseur, active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
