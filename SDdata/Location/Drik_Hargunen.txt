Drik Hargunen was a duergar city in the Underdark region of Faer√ªn.
The city was built around a natural rock chimney and iron stairways connected the various levels.
The duergar of Drik Hargunen appeared to be more tolerant than many of their kin and allowed some human slavers and traders to live in the city.
In 1480 DR, the duergar of Drik Hargunen devised a rune magic ritual that infected the dwarven god Moradins River of Gold, his tangible link to Toril, and caused the Stoneplague.
