'''Drik Hargunen''' was a [[duergar]] city in the [[Underdark]] region of [[Faer√ªn]].{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|3553}}

==Geography==
The city was built around a natural rock chimney and [[iron]] stairways connected the various levels.

The duergar of Drik Hargunen appeared to be more tolerant than many of their kin and allowed some [[human]] slavers and traders to live in the city.

==History==
In [[1480 DR]], the duergar of Drik Hargunen devised a rune [[magic]] ritual that infected the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[deity|god]] [[Moradin|Moradin's]] [[Moradin's Vein|River of Gold]], his tangible link to [[Toril]], and caused the [[Stoneplague]].{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|4155}}
