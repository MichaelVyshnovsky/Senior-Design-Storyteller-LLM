'''Bormton''' was a village in [[Amn]], lying between [[Trademeet]] and the [[Small Teeth]] mountains.

==History==
[[Revered Brother]] [[Filithan]] of the [[Church of Ilmater]] originally hailed from Bormton. He was involved in the enchantment of the legendary sword ''[[Dornavver]]'' in the [[275 DR|Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR]].

In the first days of [[Marpenoth]] of the [[1347 DR|Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR]], Bormton was burned and razed by people from [[Tethyr]] because they heard a rumor that the village took in some refugees who had escaped the carnage during the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]].

In [[1374 DR]], this village was noted as still being in ruins.
