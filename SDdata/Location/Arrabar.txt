Arrabar was the capital city of Chondath and one of the primary port cities of the Vilhon Reach, known for its crime and corruption. The heraldic symbol of the city was three golden balls on a white background.
The sleepy city was an ancient and sprawling megapolis, though the people kept it tidy, clean, and maintained. One of the most distinctive features of Arrabar was greenery. The city was filled with lush gardens, exotic plants, vines crawling up trellises, and unending hanging pots and planters inside and on the city streets.

The city of Arrabar was a sprawling port megapolis, neatly sectioned into several districts nestled around the central Governor District. The west-most part of the city was the Port District. To the north laid the Warehouse District, Merchants District to the south, and the Living District to the east.
The grandest structure in Arrabar was the Generon, the palace of the Lord of Arrabar, located in the Governor District. It comprised a stately dome that glittered with gold and silver. It was circled by barracks and fortifications, staffed by Lord Wianars personal army.
Another distinction Arrabar had from many other metropolises were numerous canals that honeycombed the Port District and stretched towards neighboring boroughs of the city – the Netherwaters, or simply "Nethers" or "Below" (collective terms that covered the canals, its docks, and the basin). The canals converged on the "turning basin" south of the Warehouse District and stretched to the sea. The canals were used by civilians and boats transporting trade goods and narrowboat barges that transported the citys trash and waste to the Shallows (a monster-infested bay down the coast outside the city). Many of the buildings in the canal-honeycombed district could be described as being on the "waterfront." Some "waterfront" places, such as the sprawling tavern of the Crying Claw had small docks where visitors could leave their boats tied up until they were ready to leave the establishment. With time and Arrabars growth, most canals were roofed over. The "turning basin" had a "light well" atop of it – an opening that was smaller in size than the basin itself. Many of the "waterfront" buildings had deep basements due to rising street levels with time. The canals functioned as storm drains through the city via gratings. The guard of Arrabar policed the canals to ensure no blockage ensued. Clogging of canals cost money to the city and its busy trade for the same reason, fishing from boats, shores, or balconies was forbidden. The Netherwaters had a shady reputation due to some lowlifes and criminals who dwelled there. Because of that, some Arrabarrans disliked talking about the Below.
The rulership of Arrabar was held by the Lord of Arrabar, who was served loyally and unrelentingly by most warriors of Chondath. The lordship expanded to all the cities of Chondath. The seat of power was located in the grand palace of Generon. The rulership of Chondath was held by the Illistine family, after Anthony Illistine united the free cities into the nation of Chondath in 139 DR and ended in 300 DR.
In the late 14 century DR, Lord Eles Wianar House Wianars ambitions were to take control of all the free cities of Chondath and surrounding lands. However, the main obstacle in the Lords way was the Emerald Enclave.
The Lord of Arrabar hosted an annual assembly of representatives from the free-cities of Chondath. The event lasted for an entire week and was used to discuss pressing national matters. The chairperson who helmed each assemble was determined via a lottery. Additional assemblies were held during the times of strife, and representatives of neighboring nations, such as Turmish, were invited.
The manors that belonged to various noble families of Arrabar were located along the outer city walls. Each of the noble families owned a small private army.

*The Night of Ghosts festival was the annual gala ball organized by the Lord of Arrabar.

Thanks to mercenaries, Arrabar was quite strong militarily, and it could pose a threat in any land. Its heavy fortification provided additional defense. The marine ports of Arrabar were well defended by ballistae. Chondathan navy was limited in size, following the war against a wizard Yrkhetep.In the late 14 century DR, the armies of Arrabar were called "under-trained and woefully inadequate for the battle they wish to wage against mighty Sespech." The person who said that, of course, was General Clas Denwith of Sespech.
Arrabars defenses and troops, the Municipal Guard of Arrabar, were broken into numbered squads. The 6 Municipal Guard were considered to be the best of Arrabar. Typical equipment carried by the Municipal Guard included longswords and short bows. These troops considered the undead to be their sworn enemies.
Use of speak with dead spell was a part of the protocol when the Municipal Guard of Arrabar faced with murder cases, including the incidents in which individuals were slain by the members of the Guard. Clergy of the Church of Waukeen were invited to perform the divine ritual.
