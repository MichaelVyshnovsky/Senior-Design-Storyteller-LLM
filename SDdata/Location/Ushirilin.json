        "mainbody": "'''Ushirilin''' was one of the many isolated villages of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].",
        "Description": "As a whole, the people of Ushirilin were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.\n\nUshirilin had a population of about 150 individuals after {{YearlinkConvert|1770|WY}}, but before that time, the population had been over 250. Ushirilin had suffered greatly from attacks from yellow-robed raiders sent by [[Za-Jikku]]. Because of the raids, most of the structures of the village were in ruins.",
        "Geography": "Ushirilin was located at the northern end of the Fochu Peninsula, where it connected to the mainland of [[Tsukishima]]. It sat in the foothills of the [[Jufosu Range|Jufosu Mountains]] on a tributary of the [[Nanaichi River]].",
        "Government": "Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a [[Wa-an dictionary#S|''shoya'']], typically a minor [[samurai]]. The ''shoya'' could call upon a local militia if needed.",
        "Trade": "Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Ushirilin had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of [[Kara-Tur]] or regions beyond. This was true even more so after the raids, as the people's efforts were dedicated almost solely to rebuilding their ruined village.\n\nIt was free to spend the night in one of the small ''minkas'', and the people had a communal kitchen from which they distributed free [[fish]] and [[rice]] to hungry villagers or guests. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 [[yuan]] to sell.",
        "Defenses": "About 15 citizens of Ushirilin served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple [[club]]s or [[spear]]s.",
        "Religion": "Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Awajiga were not particularly religious.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Jobojo Hugvi]], a coffin-maker.",
        "History": "Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed [[Pan lung|coiled dragon]] Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create ''yun ch'i'', the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Ushirilin suffered especially severely from Za-Jikku's raids."
