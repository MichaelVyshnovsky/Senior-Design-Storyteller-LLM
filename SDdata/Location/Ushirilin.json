        "mainbody": "Ushirilin was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa.\nAs a whole, the people of Ushirilin were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.\nUshirilin had a population of about 150 individuals after , but before that time, the population had been over 250. Ushirilin had suffered greatly from attacks from yellow-robed raiders sent by Za-Jikku. Because of the raids, most of the structures of the village were in ruins.\nUshirilin was located at the northern end of the Fochu Peninsula, where it connected to the mainland of Tsukishima. It sat in the foothills of the Jufosu Mountains on a tributary of the Nanaichi River.\nVillages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya, typically a minor samurai. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed.\nLike the other tiny settlements of the region, Ushirilin had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. This was true even more so after the raids, as the peoples efforts were dedicated almost solely to rebuilding their ruined village.\nIt was free to spend the night in one of the small minkas, and the people had a communal kitchen from which they distributed free fish and rice to hungry villagers or guests. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 yuan to sell.\nAbout 15 citizens of Ushirilin served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears.\nUnlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Awajiga were not particularly religious.\n* Jobojo Hugvi, a coffin-maker.\nSometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun chi, the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Ushirilin suffered especially severely from Za-Jikkus raids."
