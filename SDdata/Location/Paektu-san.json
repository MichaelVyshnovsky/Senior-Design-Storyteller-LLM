Like many sites in Koryo, Paektu-san shares a name with a real-world counterpart: [[Wikipedia:Paektu Mountain|Paektu (or Baekdu) Mountain]] in North Korea, where \"-san\" means \"mountain\". However, in Koryo, Paektu-san is denoted on maps as a settlement, not a mountain, and lies on the coast, away from the mountains.",
        "Geography": "Paektu-san lay on the southern coast of the western peninsula, north of the [[Dragon's Teeth]], a series of straits that were impossible to navigate."
