        "mainbody": "aektu-san was a settlement in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.Nothing is known about Paektu-san itself. Like many sites in Koryo, Paektu-san shares a name with a real-world counterpart Paektu (or Baekdu) Mountain in North Korea, where \"-san\" means \"mountain\". However, in Koryo, Paektu-san is denoted on maps as a settlement, not a mountain, and lies on the coast, away from the mountains.\nPaektu-san lay on the southern coast of the western peninsula, north of the Dragons Teeth, a series of straits that were impossible to navigate."
