'''Nalamh''' was a town in [[Laothan]] in [[Malatra]].{{Cite interactive atlas|C2aNElc.FCW}}

==Geography==
It stood amidst the jungles of northern Laothan, at the end of a trail from [[Pursai]].

==Economy==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], more [[silk]] was manufactured here than anywhere else in Laothan. In addition, loggers harvested [[ebony]] and [[teak]] lumber from the jungle. The majority of Nalamh's products were sold within Laothan.

==Legends==
Somewhere in the jungles around Nalamh there would appear a mysterious palace of unknown origin and nature. Some adventurers would explore it, but those who did not leave before it disappeared again would be spirited away with it, never to be seen again.
