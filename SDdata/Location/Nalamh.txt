Nalamh was a town in Laothan in Malatra.
It stood amidst the jungles of northern Laothan, at the end of a trail from Pursai.
In the midâ€“14 century DR, more silk was manufactured here than anywhere else in Laothan. In addition, loggers harvested ebony and teak lumber from the jungle. The majority of Nalamhs products were sold within Laothan.
Somewhere in the jungles around Nalamh there would appear a mysterious palace of unknown origin and nature. Some adventurers would explore it, but those who did not leave before it disappeared again would be spirited away with it, never to be seen again.
