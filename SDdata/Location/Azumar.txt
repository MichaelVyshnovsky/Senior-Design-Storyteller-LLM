'''Azumar''', later known as the '''Necropolis of Azumar''', was a city found in [[Anauria]], one of the three [[Lost Kingdoms|survivor states]] established in [[Anauroch]] after the fall of ancient [[Netheril]]. It was ruled over by the benevolent and selfless Prince [[Hamukai]].

==Description==
The city comprised once-grand stone buildings between which ran winding roads.

==Defenses==
For centuries, Azumar served as the resting place for one of the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]''. It was safeguarded by the [[Consortium of Three]], [[Netherese]] wizards that dutifully served Prince Hamukai.

==History==
Azumar was destroyed by the [[Zikzorishka]], a [[blue dragon]] that sought to seize the ''Nether Scroll'' from Prince Hamukai. The Consortium of Three sealed the prince and the ''Nether Scroll'' away in a tomb deep beneath the city, protected in a state of magical stasis.

Over time it was swallowed up by the sands of the desert. Zikzorishka underwent the transformation to [[lichdom]] and made the ruined city her lair, determined to outwait the obstinate prince.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Mastaba]], the final resting place of Prince Hamukai and lair of Zikzorishka.
