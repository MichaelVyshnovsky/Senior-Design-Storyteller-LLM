Anchoril was a town on the island of Suj, located on its eastern shores, washed with the waters of the Trackless Sea. The closest major settlement to Anchoril was Sujjar, west of Anchoril, built on the Suj-lan bay.
Anchoril was connected to the Lantanna Embassy in Waterdeep via a keyed portal called The Welcome Gates. This two-way portal led to the Visitors Vale just outside of Anchoril. The portal was protected by the key-word "Enjoy" and by Lantanna guards who deterred undesirables via dreaded bureaucracy.
