Striking out from their isolated abbey, the warriors of Haela Brightaxe were very effective in culling the monstrous population of nearby areas like the Serpent Hills, the Battle of Bones, the Forest of Wyrms, and the Marsh of Chelimber.\nBecause most tales confused the Tor of Swords with the nearby Dungeon of Swords in the High Moor, Endar Aglandtor was rarely visited by adventurers.\n* Blade of the Crimson Axe Aglaya Rockfist, leader of Haelas Host circa 1371 DR."
