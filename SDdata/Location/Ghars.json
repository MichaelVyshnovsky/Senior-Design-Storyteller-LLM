        "mainbody": "Jasper, no fan of his home town, described it as an \"unspeakably weary little town\" and \"the dullest spot in Cormyr\"<ref > and just shabby and sleepy.\n\nThe town lacked a good supply of water, instead getting what it needed from wells. During the 1367 drought, a cistern was built on the west side; a huge barrel raised on stilts, it was the tallest structure in town. All available water from wells was taken here.\n\nGhars had a town hall, to which was attached a [[Ghars library|small public library]].<ref>\n\n===Notable Locations===\n;Shops\n: [[Aunsible Durn's smithy]]\n;Inns\n:[[Sheaf of Wheat]] • [[Silver Scythe]] • [[Swamp Rat]]\n;Taverns\n:[[Bold Bard]]",

        "Inhabitants": "''Circa'' 1367 DR, Ghars was home to around 1,200 people.",
        "Government": "Ghars was governed by a mayor; in the mid-1360s DR, this was Mayor [[Tobald]]. He seemed to do little more than kiss babies and cut ribbons to open new stores. The nominal lord of the town was Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]], who was the lord of Wheloon. [[Grodoveth]] served as an envoy between King [[Azoun IV]], Redbeard, and Tobald.",
        "Trade": "Ghars was a market town serving the surrounding farms. Local farmers came to sell their produce here. From there, to ensure they could be sold fresh, fruits and vegetables such as [[radish]]es were taken on fast coaches with frequent [[horse]] changes to have them arrive in [[Marsember]] or [[Suzail]]. In Suzail, they were often marketed as \"Hultail's best\", despite never going through there. [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]], the wealthiest merchant in town, owned a fleet of swift of wagons for this trade.\n\n[[Barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[wheat]] were milled in Ghars and transported more slowly to [[Hultail]], and then to [[Wheloon]] via barge. The grist mill was driven by [[oxen]], owing to the limited water supply. It was also owned by Barthelm Meadowbrock.\n\nGhars was also home to the skilled smith [[Aunsible Durn]], who forged agriculture tools like [[horseshoe]]s, plowshares, and [[scythe]]s, and even various [[polearm]]s. People traveled for miles to purchase his wares, or at the least the tools.\n\nThere was a messenger service for delivering messages.",
        "Defenses": "Owing to the threat of raiders out of the nearby Vast Swamp, Ghars was garrisoned with a sizeable force of the [[Purple Dragons]]. They also served as a police force and were considered unbiased and uncorruptible.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = …so that we can do our bit, if the realm should—gods on their thrones forbid—be invaded.\n| source = One local \"squire\" on his armed workers\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nLocal farmers with a bit of wealth to spare liked to outfit their workers with [[polearm|bill]]s, [[halberd]]s, and [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s from Aunsible Durn. Purportedly, this was to have a militia in the event of attack, but many folk in the area thought this just an excuse to have a rough-and-ready honor guard to parade around while the would-be squires wore their fancy armor at weddings and festivals.",
        "History": "Once a village threatened by raiders from the Vast Swamp, the arrival of a Purple Dragon garrison and sundry other services helped Ghars grow into a market town by the 1360s DR.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, the retired [[War Wizard]] [[Benelaius]] moved into a [[Benelaius's cottage|cottage]] outside Ghars, becoming a subject of much speculation.\n\nBy the start of autumn in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Ghars was suffering a drought, having gone [[tenday]]s without rain. Many wells dried up, crops were meagre, and farmers worried about their finances. Thus, what water remained was stored in a newly built public cistern managed by [[Khlerat]]. Meanwhile, at the arrangement of Barthelm Meadowbrock, Cormyr's [[Merchants' Guild]] was set to hold its Grand Council there, which puffed up local merchants and drew agents of the [[Iron Throne]] and [[Zhentarim]]; the Purple Dragons arrested one of the former and two of the latter in two months. Furthermore, townsfolk (typically farmers returning late from market and patrons leaving the newly opened [[Swamp Rat]] tavern) reported seeing the axe-wielding ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]] in the land east of the town, northwest of the Vast Swamp. It was the talk of the town; some thought it real, others a fake.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = I don't know what was more alarming that autumn in Ghars—the drought, the roving agents of the Zhentarim and the Iron Throne, the ghost, or the upcoming visit of the Grand Council of Cormyr's Merchants' Guild. In retrospect, I guess it was the murders.\n| source = Opening to Jasper's account of events in Eleint, 1367 DR.\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nFinally, on [[Eleint 17]], blacksmith's assistant [[Dovo]] was found murdered and to have been impersonating the ghost all along.<ref> Captain [[Flim]] of the Purple Dragons garrison, Mayor Tobald, and Doctor [[Braum]] examined the scene Meanwhile, townsfolk cleaned up, beautified, and hung banners, [[garland]]s, and wreaths in preparation for the Merchants' Guild visit. That night, the visiting adventuress [[Kendra]] slew the hydra and rescued Jasper from its maws. Finally, Benelaius had Captain Flim and the Purple Dragons round up a number of suspects and escort them to a midnight meeting at his cottage. There, he exposed Mayor Tobald as the murderer of Dovo and Grodoveth as part of an Iron Throne spy ring, using Dovo's Fastred disguise as a cover. Moreover, he revealed Tobald's attempting to assassinate the Merchants' Guild Grand Council—and incidentally the town's entire population—by poisoning the water cistern with [[blackweed]]. This was all to sabotage Cormyr's economy to the benefit of the Iron Throne and [[Sembia]]. The plot was foiled and Tobald escaped into the Vast Swamp, where the real ghost of Fastred caused him to drown. The drought finally broke the next day, [[Eleint 20]], with rain coming heavily.\n\nGhars still stood in [[1479 DR]].",
