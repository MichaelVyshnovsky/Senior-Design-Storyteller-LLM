        "mainbody": "he Docks District of Neverwinter, also called the Neverwinter docks, was the location of the commercial docks of that city. It comprised the western portion of the city between the Protectors Enclave and the Blacklake District. \nThe docks were located on the Bay of Mists at the mouth of the Neverwinter River. It was one of the seedier parts of the city, and the center of the smuggling trade as well as more respectable commerce. Much of Neverwinters original wealth and influence was thanks to its position as one of the few ports on the Sword Coast North.\nThe Docks were operational and busy as of the late 15 century DR, however a portion of the northern section was still in ruins from the eruption of Mount Hotenow, and parts were rotting and half-sunken beneath new construction. This section was known as the swamped docks, and was home to criminals and the destitute, as well as to a tribe of sahuagin.\nDuring the Spellplague of 1385 DR, the Docks District was hard hit by the wild magic. Chunks of land broke away and rose into the sky, forming earthmotes. The surviving residents of the district quickly adapted to their new situation, connecting the low-floating motes to the shore with ropes, chains, and bridges.\nThe eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR, however, proved to be disastrous for the Docks. It destroyed the foundations of these bridges, and the changed currents swamped whole areas of the port with tidal waves, leaving the docks a rotting ghost town. Only a few fishers and the occasional pirate ship made port during the following years.\nWhen Dagult Neverember began to rebuild Neverwinter years later, he made rebuilding the Docks District a top priority. He hired engineers and loggers and ordered them to shop for any usable tree in the Upland Rise to be used to rebuild the docks. By 1479 DR, most of the Docks District was fully rebuilt and operational, once again the heart of commerce of the Jewel of the North.\n*Rusty Als Tattoo & Pawn, a small dockside shop run by Rusty Al in the late 14 century DR.\n*The Golden Apple, a nice enough inn for the area in the late 14 century DR.\n*Twenty in a Quiver, a shop that dealt in weapons, armor, and other goods, run by Jerol in the late 14 century DR.\n* Len-jes, the harbormaster as of 1479 DR.\n* Jimn, the harbormaster in the late 1490s DR.\n* Palas, a notorious halfling bandit in 1479 DR, who had a hideout in the swamped docks."
