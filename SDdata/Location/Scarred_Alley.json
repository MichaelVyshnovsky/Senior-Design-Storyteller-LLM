        "mainbody": "carred Alley was a miserable neighborhood that housed the spellscarred of Baldurs Gate during the 15 century DR.\nScarred Alley was located in Baldurs Gates Outer City just a few blocks from Little Calimshan.\nAs the city of Baldurs Gate had been largely untouched by the Spellplague, the citizens were unaccustomed to those with spellscars and regarded them with fear. Thus, they were unofficially quarantined in Scarred Alley. At some point, the Order of Blue Fire established a mission there to care for the spellscarred. \nIn the late 15 century DR, Grand Duke Valarken developed an interest in the spellscarred, believing that their bodies were ideal vessels for lycanthropy. He worked to subvert both the guards in Scarred Alley as well as the Order of Blue Fire, driving out those who would not cooperate and converting the remainder to his cause. As of , he had used the promise of a better life to buy the loyalty of many of the spellscarred in Scarred Alley, and had replaced all the guards with loyalists and lycanthropes.\n* A chapter house of the Order of Blue Fire, which was abandoned by that faction by 1479 DR. It comprised several adjacent buildings cobbled together to create a single compound, and included an old teleportation circle that connected it to other chapters of the Order.\n* A seedy tavern in front of which locals were known to share a drink.\nScarred Alley was home both to the citys spellscarred citizens as well as spellscarred animals.\nNotable inhabitants included\n* \"Cyclops\", a local ruffian with a spellscarred eye."
