The Isle of Devils was the largest of the Outer Isles of Wa.
"Devils" that had once wandered the mainland were banished here by the Spirit of Wa. A man had to agree to take the place of a devil before it could leave.
The island was under the jurisdiction of Aru Province, which it was nearest to on the mainland, since its establishment in Wa Year 1608 (1190 DR).
It was a forested island off the western coast of Tsukishima.
