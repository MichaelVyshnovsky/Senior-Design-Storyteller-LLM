The '''Isle of Devils''' was the largest of the [[Outer Isles]] of [[Wa]].

"[[Devil]]s" that had once wandered the mainland were banished here by the [[Spirit of Wa]]. A man had to agree to take the place of a devil before it could leave.

The island was under the jurisdiction of [[Aru Province]], which it was nearest to on the mainland, since its establishment in Wa Year 1608 ([[1190 DR]]).<ref>

It was a forested island off the western coast of [[Tsukishima]].
