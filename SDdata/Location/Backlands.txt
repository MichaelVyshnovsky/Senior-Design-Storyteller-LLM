'''The Backlands''' was a region in the [[Western Heartlands]] known for its sparse population, wild nature, and many monsters. It was called the Backlands mainly by those that dwelt on the [[Sword Coast]]. The central grasslands were known as [[Pelleor's Prairie]].

==Geography==
There were no established borders, but the Backlands were generally described as the lands east of the [[Serpent's Tail Stream]], the [[Forest of Wyrms]], and the [[Trielta Hills]], all the way to the edge of [[Anauroch]]. Its southern border was the [[River Reaching]] and the northern edge was usually defined as the southern-most [[Greypeak Mountains]].

==Government==
This region had no government to speak of. In the 1360s DR, there were tribes of [[wemic]]s living on the prairie. In the 1370s DR, hunting parties from [[Najara]] were known to explore the area.

==History==
In the days of ancient [[Netheril]], this region was a great source of food from fertile farms.
