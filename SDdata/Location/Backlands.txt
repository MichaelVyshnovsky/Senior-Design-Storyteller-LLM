The Backlands was a region in the Western Heartlands known for its sparse population, wild nature, and many monsters. It was called the Backlands mainly by those that dwelt on the Sword Coast. The central grasslands were known as Pelleors Prairie.
There were no established borders, but the Backlands were generally described as the lands east of the Serpents Tail Stream, the Forest of Wyrms, and the Trielta Hills, all the way to the edge of Anauroch. Its southern border was the River Reaching and the northern edge was usually defined as the southern-most Greypeak Mountains.
This region had no government to speak of. In the 1360s DR, there were tribes of wemics living on the prairie. In the 1370s DR, hunting parties from Najara were known to explore the area.
In the days of ancient Netheril, this region was a great source of food from fertile farms.
