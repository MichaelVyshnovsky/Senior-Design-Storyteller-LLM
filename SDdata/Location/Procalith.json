        "mainbody": "'''Procalith''' was a city in the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. It had become a ruin by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Technically it was still considered a part of [[Lapaliiya]].",
        "History": "Procalith was founded in {{yearlink|16}}. It was ruled through most of its duration by a succession of kings appointed by the [[Shoon Imperium]] or by the oligarchies of [[Tashalar]].\n\nIn {{yearlink|293}}, the princess [[Nasana Melnuthquel]] was offered the position of [[Magister]] by [[Azuth]], and installed her lover a puppet ruler, leaving the city to carry out her Magisterial duties. She returned in {{yearlink|297}}, having become an indiscriminate killer of mages; she slew her ruler's consort, [[Osalra]], who was a mage of minor power, and died of heartstop on the spot. A courtier, [[Sabral Faryre]], finished off her body and claimed the mantle of the Magister; he immediately slew the then-king, a number of other people at the court, and commanded he be brought a number of people of magical talent he knew of in the city. Once brought to him, they were named his [[Council of Lords and Ladies]], which he meant to rule Procalith with. He was killed within seven days, with his body pierced by a harpoon that went straight through him and the throne too. Though one of his council, Lady [[Mimr√©]], used a spell to burn his body, she was not awarded the mantle of the Magister; instead, she disappeared, as did the throne, which wouldn't be found until two decades later, discarded in an underground chamber of the palace.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|35-36}}\n\nThe city was destroyed in {{yearlink|1142}}, during the [[Rage of Wizards]], by a sorcery-driven storm.",
        "Rumors": "Besides the treasures still left unclaimed in the city, it was believed by some that the ''[[rod of Auglad]]'', a unique rod of [[Netherese]] make once belonging to [[Ilitmur Auglad]], had been hidden in the city by [[Nasana Melnuthquel]], a former [[Magister]]. As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the rod had not been found.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the most important inhabitant of [[Procalith]] was [[Maharishi]], a [[guardian naga]] that lived in the ruined city. Some explorers came to seek the Sage, but some outlaws had also taken residence in the ruin.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "*[[Nasana Melnuthquel]]\n*[[Sabral Faryre]]\n*[[Osalra]]\n*[[Mimre]]\n*[[Maharishi]]"
