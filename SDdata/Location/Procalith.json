It was ruled through most of its duration by a succession of kings appointed by the Shoon Imperium or by the oligarchies of Tashalar.\nIn , the princess Nasana Melnuthquel was offered the position of Magister by Azuth, and installed her lover a puppet ruler, leaving the city to carry out her Magisterial duties. She returned in , having become an indiscriminate killer of mages she slew her rulers consort, Osalra, who was a mage of minor power, and died of heartstop on the spot. A courtier, Sabral Faryre, finished off her body and claimed the mantle of the Magister he immediately slew the then-king, a number of other people at the court, and commanded he be brought a number of people of magical talent he knew of in the city. Once brought to him, they were named his Council of Lords and Ladies, which he meant to rule Procalith with. He was killed within seven days, with his body pierced by a harpoon that went straight through him and the throne too. Though one of his council, Lady Mimr√©, used a spell to burn his body, she was not awarded the mantle of the Magister instead, she disappeared, as did the throne, which wouldnt be found until two decades later, discarded in an underground chamber of the palace.\nThe city was destroyed in , during the Rage of Wizards, by a sorcery-driven storm.\nBesides the treasures still left unclaimed in the city, it was believed by some that the rod of Auglad, a unique rod of Netherese make once belonging to Ilitmur Auglad, had been hidden in the city by Nasana Melnuthquel, a former Magister. As of the late 14 century DR, the rod had not been found.\nAs of the late 14 century DR, the most important inhabitant of Procalith was Maharishi, a guardian naga that lived in the ruined city. Some explorers came to seek the Sage, but some outlaws had also taken residence in the ruin.\n*Nasana Melnuthquel\n*Sabral Faryre\n*Osalra\n*Mimre\n*Maharishi"
