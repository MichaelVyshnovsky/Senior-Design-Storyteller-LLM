        "mainbody": "ynnoria was an ancient elven kingdom hidden in the mountains bordering the Myrloch Vale on Gwynneth, one of the Moonshae Isles.\nIt was covered in a powerful mass illusion spell so that, if viewed from above, it simply looked like a continuation of the surrounding mountains. Overland, there were three mountain passes that lead into the realm, but they were narrow and full of false trails and gorges so that they were very difficult to navigate without a guide or very detailed directions.\nSynnoria boasted only a single real settlement, the city of Chrysalis, Legends among the Llewyrr foretold a resurgence would one day bring them back to dominance of the Moonshaes, but they always doubted this legend until it proved true when the entire island of Gwynneth was taken over by noble eladrin leading to humans being banned from its shores in 1375 DR.\nSynnoria was founded by elves from the Llewyrrwood fleeing the Vyshaan occupation of their homeland in . They named the realm after their queen who had led them over the sea.\nSynnoria was attacked by the Ityak-Ortheel in 1365 DR when Malar and Talos sent it through a portal but the elf-eater was defeated and banished back to the Abyss after it had destroyed Argen-Tellirynd, the Palace of Ages.\n* Mirror Lake a deep blue enchanted lake that had the ability to answer questions posed at dawn.\n* The Grove of Meditation a circle of pine trees that was said to increase the ability of elven magic users to learn powerful spells.\n* Singing waterfalls created by the run-off from glaciers high in the mountains, it was said that the water sang a song of heart-wrenching beauty that could enrapture humans such that they would sit and listen until they died of starvation."
