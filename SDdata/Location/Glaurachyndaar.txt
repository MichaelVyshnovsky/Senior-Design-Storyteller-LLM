'''Glaurachyndaar''' (formerly '''Myth Glaurach''', the '''City of Scrolls''') was a ruined [[Eaerlann]]i city situated on the river [[Starsilver]], a tributary of the river [[Delimbiyr]], in the [[Nether Mountains]]. It was a garden city with ornate buildings and white domes, built on the ruins of an [[Aryvandaar]]an city.

==History==
Myth Glaurach was built on top of the pre-existing ruins of an Aryvandaaran city whose name is presumed to be lost. The city was raided by [[orc]]s in [[864 DR]] and sacked. [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] found the mythal stone of the city buried in a deep pit to protect it from attackers, and she used the magic of the stone to summon [[demon]]s that could remain permanently in [[Faerûn]]. [[Araevin Teshurr]] subsequently restored the mythal and altered it in such a way that it can now withstand fiendish intervention. The daemonfey army fled the ruins in the same year they arrived after losing a battle to an elven army from [[Evermeet]] outside of [[Evereska]]. The leader of the elvish army, [[Seiveril Miritar]] left a contingent of elves to guard the ruins after Sarya left.

==Notable locations==
There were a number of [[portal]]s beneath the grand mage's palace.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}

A shrine dedicated to [[Labelas Enoreth]] – the [[Star Mausoleum]], could be found in Myth Glaurach before the city's fall. The site of worship was visited by Labelas's [[avatar]] on at least one occasion, where he created the ''[[Girdle of Labelas]]'', a holy item later worn by the god's High Priests.

===Mythal===
In its original state, the mythal barred all [[fiend]]s and anyone who had ever eaten the flesh of [[elves]], [[dwarves]] or [[human]]s, but this was destroyed by Sarya Dlardrageth and remains so. Other aspects of the mythal continued to function. It was not possible to cast [[:Category:Acid spells|acid]], [[conjuration]], [[:Category:Death spells|death]], [[:Category:Evil spells|evil]], or [[:Category:Fire spells|fire]] spells within the mythal, and spells that ''[[calm animal]]s'' and prevent weed growth were active.
