        "mainbody": "he Thayan enclave was a Red Wizard enclave in the second quarter of the city of Innarlith on the Lake of Steam. It was established in 1365 DR, following Senator Salatiss seizure of power with Thayan support.\nThe enclave supplied magical items and services to customers in Innarlith. Among these services included the raising of corpses as undead workers for use as laborers for the city-states project to build a canal to connect the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow.\nMarek Rymüt was a clandestine Red Wizard who had been operating as a secret Thayan agent in Innarlith since the 1340s DR. He posed as a wizard who sold magical items and services without any allegiance to the Red Wizards. In 1365 DR, he assisted Senator Salatis in overthrowing Ransar Osorkon, the leader of the city-state, with an army of black firedrakes that he had bred. Following Salatis seizure of power, Salatis agreed to Mareks demand for the creation of the Thayan enclave in Innarlith.\nThis enclave supplied magical items and services for customers. Marek had already gained a near-monopoly on the control of the magic trade in Innarlith even before the establishment of the enclave. After it was established, it was used to supply magical services and items to customers in the city-state.\nSenator Willem Korvan was married to Senator Inthelphs daughter Phyrea in a Cyricist ceremony within the Thayan enclave in 1367 DR. He was later secretly murdered and raised as an undead servant by Marek in the enclave in 1368 DR. \nPhyrea later stole an enchanted flamberge that Marek had used to make Willem into an undead creature from the enclave in 1374 DR. \nSenator Pristoleph became the largest customer of the enclave before his coming to power as Ransar in 1371 DR. However, he later turned against the Thayan presence in Innarlith, leading to him banishing Marek and his allies following their failed attempt to overthrow him in 1374 DR.\n* Marek Rymüt\n* Kurtsson\n* Willem Korvan"
