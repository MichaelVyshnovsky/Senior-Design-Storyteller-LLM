        "mainbody": "To give shelter and aid to travelers, the Turmishans erected small cabins along the roads and trails, in the shelter of trees. Most were small buildings with space for five or six persons, with fireplaces and chimneys, but some included roofed hay pens in which [[horse]]s could be stabled. These were free to use by anyone, but those who did were expected to restock any supplies they did use. Patrols of local militias checked these periodically and stayed in them when the weather was bad. Guesthouses were built and maintained by landowners on their properties, and they included stocks of food and firewood. They usually had friendly notices to guests out front and were as well-built, well-furnished, and well-maintained as one's own house. While vandals and careless guests were an issue, it was a point of pride to keep them in good condition—according to [[Arshen|one guesthouse owner]], \"...a guest house is the sign of a man's good nature in Turmish, so I can't let it get run down.\" Some were built or ornamented in a whimsical or amusing style. The uniquity of guesthouses encouraged idle folk to travel Turmish.\n\nSimilarly, folk dug wells along the main road from Alaghôn to Hlondeth. These were roofed and enclosed, lit by [[candle]]-[[lamp]]s, and were free for use by all. Militia patrols inspected and maintained these, including replacing the candles.\n\n===Archery===\nArchery was commonly practiced in Turmish, with many farmers being quite skilled with a [[longbow]] and proud of it. This was usually used to bring down flying birds for food, but was equally effective in defending homes.\n\n===Calendar & Festivals===\nThe [[Calendar of Harptos]] was followed in Turmish as it was across Faerûn, along with its standard festival days. In addition, the Turmishans observed many local harvest festivals, holy days, and personal rites. The Dancing Ring cult held Dancing Nights on the final night of every month.\n\nOne day out of every nine, or more, Turmishans would take time off work to \"chase the sun\", when they would rest, spend time with family, practice or learn a new skill or magic, or do anything else of personal interest. Promising to do something \"on the ninth day\" usually meant \"when I have time\" or \"I'll get around to it.\"\n\nThere were only two major festivals that were celebrated across Turmish. On these days, all businesses and all but the most vital government offices would shut. These were:\n* The [[Feast of the Moon (Vilhon Reach)|Feast of the Moon]]: Also known as the \"Festival of Lovers\", this joyous occasion was celebrated throughout all of the Vilhon Reach during [[Highsummer]], on the first full moon after [[Midsummer]]. In the 1300s DR, it was a time of drinking, dancing, revelry, and even debauchery. Nevertheless, many couples were already married, married in the week before, or married on the night, for it was customary for newlyweds to consummate their marriages on this night too. Traditionally, lovers had trysts in new and unfamiliar locales, going to a previously arranged place separately along different routes before meeting up. In the 1400s DR, it was more a time for Turmishans to relax and enjoy their rewards and to spend time with friends and family. Turmishan merchants made sure to return home in time.\n* The [[Reign of Misrule]]: On [[Marpenoth 10]], a [[tenday]] after [[Highharvestide]], the citizens of Turmish would break their personal, religious, guild, and mercantile vows and social restraints by engaging in destructively exuberant celebrations, minor civil unrest, breaking things such as furniture and glass, and yelling and fighting with one another in the streets, so long as they didn't kill anyone or cause serious harm or destruction. Monks might break a vow of silence to talk and laugh, priests might break a vow of poverty to steal, and paladins might be rude and get into barroom brawls. Non-natives were prohibited from joining in these revelries, and were not excused for their actions if they did; they might be held liable for damages if caught up in it. It was a vital release of tension and pent-up aggression, allowing people to spill guilty secrets or settle feuds with rivals, neighbors, and family. Naturally, the Assembly of Stars didn't meet on this day. While it lasted no longer than a day, from dawn to dusk, and the memories might last a lifetime, it was a crime to even talk about what anyone did during a Reign of Misrule. Every Turmishan understood the customs of the Reign of Misrule, even children, it was so deeply ingrained in the culture.",
        "Geography": {
            "Climate": "The weather of Turmish was the same as that around the Vilhon Reach, namely sub-tropical and humid. While temperatures could drop in winter months, snow was rare; On occasion, winters were harsh enough to block travel and trade for months and kill livestock left in their fields. Summer months were often very hot and humid, and spring came early. The humidity abated somewhat in autumn. The Turmishans described the climate as \"one with the Reach\", that is, as humid as the sea.",
            "Flora & Fauna": "[[Blueleaf]] trees grew in Turmish, but were fairly rare.<ref> [[Broadleaf]] reeds grew in the waters along the northern coast, forming giantgrass forests.<ref>\n\nWildlife was abundant, with game like [[squirrel]]s in the woods, fish in the streams and pools, and [[bear]]s and [[goat]]s in the mountains.  [[Duck]]s, [[grouse]], [[pheasant]], and other fowl were fed and allowed nesting grounds, and rarely kept in barns. Limited plains and predators in the forests limited herd animals. Once, there were wild Turmish [[ponies]], but they survived only in captive herds in the Perloush.\n\nThere were also monstrous creatures such as [[bulette]]s, [[leucrotta]]s, and [[peryton]]s, as well as hybrids. Some of these were descendants of the experiments of the mage [[Tauthryn|Tauthryn the Mad]]. [[Deepspawn]] were naturally common and could be found in isolated caves in the mountains.\n\nIt wasn't common to keep household pets and [[dog]]s were almost unheard of. However, people would feed fish or birds in their area. Small [[oxen]], [[mule]]s, and domesticated ponies were kept on farms.",

But this was a myth, arising from its crowded neighbors in the Vilhon Reach and the tendency of the Turmishans to travel, especially their mercenaries, compared to more sedentary folk in other lands who thought them displaced for some reason. In 1372 DR, it had a population of 1,693,440 people, with 78% [[human]]s, 9% [[dwarves]], 5% [[halfling]]s, 3% [[elves]], and 2% [[gnome]]s, as well as 1% [[half-elves]] and 1% [[half-orc]]s.\n\nThe Turmishan humans were primarily (95%) of the [[Turami]] ethnicity, with the remainder (4%) being largely [[Chondathan]]. The Turami typically had curly black hair and dark-brown, mahogany-colored skin. They grew tall and muscular, had flattish faces, and were commonly considered beautiful and graceful.<ref><ref> A male Turmishan was typically {{SIrange|6.5|7.5|feet|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SIrange|180|200|lb|k|long=yes}}, with slender builder and well-defined musculature. Some thought they had elven heritage.\n\nWhile most dwarves in the land remained independent in [[Ironfang]] in the Alaoreum Mountains and were suspicious of the humans after past wars, some lived in Gildenglade and Ravilar's Cloak.<ref> [[Shield dwarves]] and [[gold dwarves]] also lived in the Aphrunn and Orsraun Mountains.  [[Moon elves]] and [[wild elves]] lived in Xorhun and Gildenglade, [[rock gnome]]s in Xorhun and Nonthal, and [[lightfoot halfling]]s in Alaghôn and Gildenglade. Half-elves often avoided Xorhun but lived peacefully in Gildenglade.<ref> [[Firenewt]]s dwelled in the mountains.<ref>\n\nIn the 1400s DR, Turmish was regularly visited by those making [[pilgrimage|scar pilgrimages]] to the [[Plaguewrought Land]] to obtain a [[spellscar]]. Moreover, a community of [[kobold]]s settled in Xorhun, joining the [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[gnome]]s, while [[lizardfolk]] resettled [[Morningstar Hollows]] before moving on to the [[Wetwoods]] in the [[Shining Plains]].",
        "Language": "The common tongue was the [[Turmic]] language, which used the [[Thorass]] script.",
        "Government": "By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Turmish was a confederation of three city-states, each of them a democratic republic. The capital, Alaghôn was governed by the [[Assembly of Stars]], also known as the Free Council. Members were chosen in free elections and every citizen, whatever their race, sex, or standing, had a single vote and was in turn eligible for election. In turn, the council would elect from their number a chief speaker, titled the Lord of Turmish{{Cite dragon/181/Pages from the Mages|19}}<ref group=\"note\">The position of Marcrowne is unexplained but implies a monarchical rule of Turmish. This predates development of Turmish as a democratic republic. Taken together, this article presumes 'Marcrowne' is an alternative or older title for the Lord of Turmish. However, it may also be a separate position in the council, a council leader in a city other than Alaghôn, a noble title, or something else. As of {{Yearlink|1370}}, the position had been filled by [[Herengar|Lord Herengar]] for nine years. In elections, candidates were nominated by their peers, rather than putting themselves forward, and terms lasted only three years. This limited, but did not eliminate, the ranks of professional politicians and their political maneuverings. The councilors, known as 'assemblymen', often had to work long hours and travel around the Vilhon Reach. As a result, it was not uncommon for a merchant to nominate and lobby for a rival to get them out of business for a few years and elected to a position they did not really want. Hence, for a few months prior to each election, politicians spent a lot of time praising one another in a reverse popularity contest. It was commonly considered the oddest political system in the Realms.\n\nThe other city-states had similar democratic systems and the country as a whole was well-managed The other cities of Turmish were free to govern themselves however they liked, so long as they paid their share of taxes and followed the laws of the Assembly, but in practice they were left alone to deal with their own issues, with the Assembly focusing on national concerns, namely the economy and defense. The Lord of Turmish had few specific duties; their primary responsibilities were maintaining local and mercenary militias for defense of the realm against pirates and rival nations, keeping the waterways free of pirates, and generally ensuring Turmish's continued prosperity.\n \nAfter the catastrophe of Spellplague, however, by the late 15{{th}} century, the country was driven to the brink of chaos by the competitive and desperate merchant [[coster]]s. In practice, the country was ruled by wealthy merchants, albeit under the watchful eye of the druids of the [[Church of Silvanus]] and the [[Emerald Enclave]].<ref> The head of the Assembly of Stars served as a chief administrator. At times, the Emerald Enclave seemed to wield more power. The country was a full parliamentary democracy, with each city contributing representatives to the Assembly of Stars.",
        "Law & Order": "[[File:Anton Marivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|''Anton Marivaldi, a pirate from Sapra in Turmish.'']]\nThe law of Turmish was based on the [[Code of Enlil]]. According to the letter of these laws, both piracy and smuggling were severe crimes. However, because of Turmish’s fragmented politics, enforcement was lax and punishment was unlikely. Furthermore, there were no extensive customs patrols in Turmish, allowing smugglers to operate widely. Nevertheless, the gnomes cracked down hard on both pirates and smugglers they caught, sometimes without waiting for human law to catch up. Even [[goblinoid]]s were hard on smugglers, even executing them for \"unauthorized\" smuggling, namely, not letting them in on a cut of the profits. It wasn't uncommon for thieves, bandits, and other unscrupulous sorts fleeing the authorities, creditors, or rivals to head to Turmish, thinking to get lost there. Some took up their old ways and were disappointed, others were welcomed by the temples and left only with stories.",
        "Defense & Security": "[[File:Ghost Swords.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Four Ghost Swords militia on patrol.'']]\nWell-organized mercenary companies and adventuring bands operated as local militias in Turmish. These watched and patrolled the borders and scout out the wildernesses, and so discouraged raids and monster attacks from the mountains. Any raid on a settlement was met by a well-organized and determined militia and a population focused on driving off invaders.\n\nSimilarly, the navy was a militia of privately owned vessels that could be commandeered as required to combat pirates. However, this also limited enforcement and led to piracy being overlooked, especially in the aftermath of the conflict with [[Yrkhetep]] in the 1350s DR, with pirate raids occurring in sight of the capital without retaliation.{{Cite adventurers league/Breaking Umberlee's Resolve|26}}\n\nFor security of homes and stables, it was common to use [[sleep-needle trap]]s, which were invented by [[Phindal]] of Gildenglade. [[Stone golem]] guardians and the like were known to have been encountered by treasure-hunters in the ruins of Turmishan cities.\n\nHowever, the most unique protectors of the realm were the [[Ghost Swords]], apparitions of swords that, on moonlit nights, led people to hidden bandits, those in need of rescue, or lost treasure. (They also prevented the creation of similar images of blades anywhere within Turmish, so there were no bogus Ghost Swords.) These inspired the founding of the [[Ghost Swords (militia)|Ghost Swords]], a band of defenders who kept watch for threats to Turmish.",
        "Relations": "Turmish had a strong commercial partnership and alliance with the city-state of [[Hlondeth]] and [[Dediana Extaminos]] of the City of Serpents maintained good relationships.<ref><ref> ''Circa'' 1372 DR, Turmish was peaceable with its neighbors, but wary. While concerned about the rise of [[Chondath]], it was hesitant to provide aid to [[Sespech]] out of worry of provoking Chondath. Turmish did not start wars, feeling that, if nothing else, it was bad for business. For their fair-dealing reputation, Turmishans were welcomed all around the Sea of Fallen Stars.\n\nTurmish embassies in several other nations and city-states, such as the [[Embassy of Turmish]] in [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref>\n\nWhile the wild western mountains of the Orsraun were home to [[goblinoid]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[orc]]s, [[red dragon]]s, and others, raids into Turmish were rare, owing to defense by the Turmishan militias.",
        "Trade": "A strongly mercantile realm, trade and commerce dominated matters in Turmish, but this was balanced by the dictates of the druids of the Emerald Enclave. These limited the cities from growing past a certain size, yet kept the people affluent and only a few being especially rich. On country estates they practiced [[Wikipedia:coppicing|coppicing]], which involved cutting limbs from a living tree but avoiding killing it, so it would regrow in about a decade and producing higher wood yields than otherwise. Coppiced trees were distinctive by their many-trunked forms.<ref>\n\n''Circa'' 1372 DR, the nation exported salt and glass, mostly to [[Procampur]] and [[Tsurlagol]], respectively, in the southern [[Vast]]. Its mercenaries usually traveled to [[Chessenta]] via Chondath. Grains and timber were produced and traded locally within the Reach. Trade and luxury goods were imported from the [[Dragon Coast]]. Metals were also imported. Turmish's food exports made it the breadbasket of the heavily populated Vilhon Reach. Dwarves of the Alaoreum Mountains traded their metals and minerals to Turmish in exchange for Turmishan goods. [[Dice]] carved from [[ivory]] in Turmish was sold in [[Aurora's Emporium]],<ref> as was the [[cheese]] known as [[Turmish brick]].<ref>\n\nMajor sea routes ran from the [[Dragon Coast]] and [[Sembia]] to near the coast of Turmish, where they either proceeded on to the [[Alamber Sea]] or turned more sharply to enter the Vilhon Reach. The strategic location of Turmish gave it the saying \"Turmish is the gateguard of the Vilhon.\"\n\nTurmish was unique in the Vilhon Reach for outlawing the slave trade. Whenever Turmish won the [[Southsand Games]], it freed the slaves it won.",
        "Society": {
            "Classless Society": "As Turmish was a republic, the citizens often took pride in their pragmatism, their lack of elaborate ceremony, and general absence of aristocratic pretensions.<ref> The people of Turmish were generally unconcerned with wealth or status, instead judging an individual's character based on their merits and deeds, and ensuring they had good merits and deeds to be judged by in turn. Accordingly, Turmishans rejected any sense of social classes and special privileges; these were almost unknown in the country, except in Alaghôn, which had contact with cities around the Inner Sea and acquired some bad habits. Not liking oppressive authority, Turmishans followed orders only when those orders made sense, had clear goals, could be done their own way, and allowed them freedom in future. If not, they would alter them, or else depart. Slavery was particularly painful for Turmishans, and they would struggle for freedom even unto madness or death.\n\nThey were usually well-educated, particularly in the areas of agriculture and business. Learned folk were respected and even somewhat admired.",
            "Marriage": "Group marriages were not uncommon,{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Ministry of Art: Ravens Bluff's Newest Government Branch|6}} with the women having a great deal of say. For example, [[Akash]] of the [[House Akash]] business married Akabar, now [[Akabar Bel Akash]], becoming wife and husband. Later, they married [[Kasim]], making her own business a partner of House Akash. They became sister-wives or co-wives and husband. Together, they wanted a third wife, but first sought to expand their business to have more money for the partnership.<ref group=\"note\">''Azure Bonds'' says they wish \"to earn money for the new partner\", but it's unclear if the money is for a marriage or for a business partnership. Furthermore, this merchant family may have additional business-based rules on marriages not followed by regular families.<ref><ref> Akash and Kasim had the power to veto Akabar's choice of wife.<ref> They later married [[Zhara]],<ref> who enjoyed spending time with Akash and Kasim.<ref> Akabar, Akash, and Kasim had four children together.<ref> Among farmers faithful to Chauntea, two males and two females would be inter-married in a single family.\n\nIt was a wedding day tradition to gift a bride with something beautiful, such as flowers, poetry, perfume, jewelry, or ornaments. The type and cost of the gift usually weren't a concern, except in wealthier Alaghôn, where folk had long focused on presenting [[gems]], though they still favored look and size over value. Poorer citizens of Alaghôn typically gave pendants of blown glass, flawed gems, and rainbow or flame-orange-hued earrings. It was common for a married woman to give her wedding day presents to new brides, so some were passed down through the generations. Some of these bridal gifts could have originated as disguised stolen property, enchanted stones, or contained or imprisoned beings and [[lichnee]] life essences.\n\nA married man wore a single [[sapphire]] earring in his left earlobe to indicate his status.",
            "Inheritance Practices": "Turmishans in the countryside had an unusual inheritance practice. Rather than work and cling to their holdings as long as they could, it was common for farmers around the age of 40 or so to leave their farms to their children or inheritors when they reached the age of 20. Some went into semi-retirement and tended to smaller plots or woodlots, and others joined the farmland monasteries that were common across Turmish, but the majority left to pursue the life of a merchant or mercenary. These 'retirees' tended to be patient, calm, and confident in battle or trade, possessing practical experience and the knowledge of having lived a worthwhile life, with their bodies strong from a life of hard work but not broken by overwork. It's likely that the Turmishans' reputation as brave warriors and fair-minded traders came from this unusual inheritance practice.",
            "Merchants": "Turmish was famous for its merchants. They were known to be fair-dealing, close-mouthed, and well-armed, Businesses in Turmish were often family-run affairs, and were dominated by the women in the family, with the men serving as little more than faces and traveling agents for their enterprises. Turmishan merchants often emigrated to [[Battledale]] in the [[Dalelands]], settling there and contributing to its diversity.<ref>",
            "Mercenaries & Warriors": "[[File:Turmishan.png|thumb|left|''A Turmishan warrior displaying her ornate armor.'']]\nTurmish was famous for its mercenaries and warriors, who were known to be courageous, honorable, impartial, articulate, and battle-skilled, and generally intelligent and charismatic. They aided the weak against oppressors, they never backed down from a good cause, and their word was their bond, and they were also excellent hosts and guests according to Turmishan custom. Being so well-respected and liked, Turmishan warriors enjoyed favorable reactions from those they met. They were also skilled in the ways of etiquette. Turmishan warriors were often conspicuous and stood out in a crowd, and were remembered by those they met—discretion or subterfuge were not their forte.  \n\nTurmishan warriors were known to wear beautiful, ornate, and intricately crafted armor. This armor blended both human and elven styles and was adorned with spires, embossing, and raised and fluted curves on the joints and shoulder plates\" / and often had a pointed helm. Often suits of [[splint armor]] with heavy steel [[shield]]s, each set of armor, helm, and shield was decorated in Turmishan style and hence tended to be worth some 20% more than standard. All Turmishan warriors, regardless of their means or rank, kept their armor in excellent condition and adorned with embellishments. Armor was a status symbol in Turmish, and expensive gold inlays or gem adornments were not uncommon. Armor was valued as much as one's beard. Such resplendent armor also aided Turmishan warriors in being well-received.\n\nTurmishan sellswords were so common throughout Faerûn that many people believed that Turmish must be overpopulated, or a place people wanted to escape from. The real reason for their ubiquity was that Turmishans were good soldiers and enjoyed adventure and travel in foreign lands. They typically worked and fought abroad for about seven years until homesickness brought them back.\n\nTurmishan warriors were carefully groomed and often wore [[perfume]]s to cover up the smells of travel, fighting, and general soldiering and armor polish.\" Despite their pleasing fragrance and ornate armor, Turmishan warriors, like their countrymen generally, were unconcerned with fashion.",
            "Adventurers": "Turmish was a country known for producing heroes, with [[adventurer]]s arising from the militias and mercantile families. Restless young Turmishans seeking adventure would often leave home for seven years before returning, often after serving as a mercenary in foreign lands. In turn, Turmish was a popular place to seek adventure in, regardless—or maybe because—of the scarcity of monsters to fight. Instead, ruins and wildernesses to explore and bard tales of lost treasures to seek drew them in.",
            "Wizards": "[[File:Wizard of Turmish artwork.jpg|thumb|250px|''A wizard of Turmish. He's keeping an eye out for you.'']]\nTurmishan wizards [[tattoo]]ed their bodies with images of animals of different kinds. These were thought to give them power and as they glowed brightly when the wizard cast a spell, this might be true. In addition, they had a customary dress of high-quality green-and-black light cloth [[robe]]s, often tied with [[sash]]es weaved with elaborate designs. They also commonly wore [[gold]] jewelry, particularly [[earring]]s and [[Choker (necklace)|chokers]]. Naturally, they also marked their heads with three dots, with some tattooing three blue dots in a row along their foreheads.\n\nWizards, like other educated folk, were respected and admired in Turmish, so Turmishan wizards did their best to earn this respect and admiration from their countrymen, upholding high ethical and moral standards and tending to be of [[good]] nature. Turmishan wizards also gave much advice and their free time to their country. Turmishan wizards, like Turmishan merchants, were famous throughout the Vilhon Reach for being fair and honest, as well as wise, peaceful, and noble. They used their intelligence and magic to collect information to protect their friends and allies and keep away enemies. An accomplished mage such as Akabar Bel Akash would describe himself as \"a mage of no small water\".\n\nAs a result, Turmishan wizards tended to be [[diviners]]. They were talented in using [[divination]] [[spell]]s to gather information, at 50% greater ranges, areas, and durations. They also excelled in the use of [[scrying]] [[magical item]]s such as ''[[crystal ball]]s'', being also able to use ''[[clairaudience]]'' to listen through them.. However, the peaceful nature of Turmishan wizards meant they were even worse at close combat than other wizards, typically not undertaking any weapons training.\n\nTurmishans were known to employ [[Wikipedia:palmistry|palm reading]].<ref>\n\nDuring the [[Wailing Years]] after the Spellplague, Turmishan wizards developed protective spells with a distinctive structure.<ref>"

        "Culture": {
            "Dress & Fashions": "[[File:Turmishan merchant.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''A Turmishan merchant with square-cut beard.'']]\n{{quote|The measure of a man's worth can be seen in the cut of his beard.|Old Turmishan saying}}\nFashions were not followed in Turmish, and they laughed at those who wore something inappropriate or impractical for the sake of fashion in other realms, such as adventurers wearing silk finery in the sewers or bright clothing when trying to be stealthy, or anything gaudy, frilly, or silly. Hence, basic fashions were slow to evolve in Turmish and striped [[robe]]s were traditional. They favored practicality over appearance, and when it was very hot or humid, stripping off not unusual. Yet they had a love of beauty that they displayed in the clothes and armors they wore and in their [[tattoo]]s.\n\nMale Turmishan merchants customarily wore long, square, neatly trimmed beards possibly with a moustache. The phrase \"square as a Turmishan's beard\" or \"square as a Turmian beard\", signifying that a given deal was fair or that a deed was properly or skillfully done, was common throughout the Vilhon Reach. Warriors of Turmish tended to be clean-shaven, so as not to be mistaken as a merchant. By the late 15{{th}} century, the Turmishan square-cut beard was worn by men in general, not only merchants and it was not ubiquitous either. Traditionalists continued to wear the beard, but it was not uncommon for men to go clean-shaven.<ref>\n\nLike much of the Vilhon Reach, all Turmishans shared the custom of painting small dots on their foreheads in colored [[ink]] or [[chalk]] to mark whether an individual could read (one dot), write (two dots), or use magic (three dots). This custom originated with the founding of [[Academia Vilhonus]] in [[Chondath]] in the {{YearlinkName|300}}.{{Cite web/More of the Vilhon Reach}}Some sources say, such as ''Polyhedron'' #98, page 6, say one dot is for religion, in place of writing.",
            "Burying Valuables": "Since Turmishans were known for respecting their land, they often buried valuables, partly as gifts to Chauntea and partly as \"seeds\" to grow future wealth. The burying of [[gold]] and [[gems]] was thought to make the land more fertile, yielding a more bountiful growing season{{Cite web/More of the Vilhon Reach}} and to one day return the riches tenfold. Burying was done as a personal ritual, done at a time meaningful to the one involved, such as on a birthday (one's own or a loved one's), a wedding anniversary, or the anniversary of the first day of one's business. It was usually only a handful of coins or gems, and buried deeper than a plough would turn up again.\n\nHowever, this custom inspired the unprincipled to become treasure hunters and it was considered theft. A stolen treasure was thought to bring misfortune for the next year. Thus, it was frowned upon to be found digging for treasure in Turmish. If the thief wasn't caught and killed by angry farmers or merchants first, then they could expect to be convicted and punished with at least a year of hard labor. For a landowner to kill such a thief wasn't a crime, but self-defense.",
            "Cuisine & Guest Dishes": "The people of Turmish customarily brought a 'guest dish' or 'greetings gift' of good food to share when visiting another's home, whether for business or socializing, as a show of gratitude for the hospitality. The value and flair of the gift varied with the status of the guest; were not expected to spend much and no food was rejected. A peasant might bring a recently hunted squirrel, as meat was preferable. The more well-off would bring a flavored bread or a good [[wine]], whether homemade or simply from their village. For the wealthy, typical greetings gifts ranged from a bottle of vintage [[Nimpeth wine]], to the always popular 'skullcap treat', namely a bowl made from an upturned human skull full of snails.{{Cite polyhedron/101/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Turmish Customers and Festivals|22-23}} The snails were roasted over fires before eating. The skullcap treat was supposedly adopted from the lizardfolk. Once, humans and lizardfolk fought for control of the Halondar swamps before establishing a peace-pact, which was followed by a feast, and for their guest dish, the lizardfolk gave a skull filled with snails. Though at first the Turmishan hosts were horrified, it became famous and was celebrated in a number of ballads.\n\nIn turn, Turmishan nobles of the late 1400s often presented guests with a traditional dish of [[Wikipedia:bread and salt|bread and salt]], in the form of [[sourdough]] [[bread]] and a bowl of [[salt]]. In the town of [[Ayakar]], which was well known for its sourdough, folk greeted visitors with the phrase \"May your bread be sour, and your salt be fresh.\"{{Cite adventurers league/Breaking Umberlee's Resolve|6}}\n\nWildfowl such as ducks, grouse, and pheasant were hunted for food, usually on the wing with a bow. These were usually taken in \"the fall flights\" to stock larders.\n[[File:Turmish_brick-2e.jpg|thumb|right|''A block of Turmish brick cheese.'']]\nSome local [[cheese]]s included [[Turmish brick]], whose reddish color originated from a local wine,<ref> and [[Turmish black]]. Flavored cheese-and-nut breads were made across Turmish.\n\nFrom the overripe and winter-wracked leftover fruit of their vineyards, Turmishans brewed potent fruit liqueurs. A small amount was exported, and was tinted amber or red. The rest stayed in Turmish and usually clear as water, surprising a good few unwary travelers. [[Tea]], meanwhile, was served in distinctive Turmish 'tulip cups'.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Blood in the Water|30}}\n\nSome desserts included the tart [[Turmishite apple and bloodberry pie]]<ref> and [[cranberry cake]].<ref>\n\nFood was never wasted in Turmish. What could still be eaten was dried, fermented, pickled, salted, or smoked and stored for the occasion harsh winter. For this reason, it was normal for people to have root cellars on or near their properties. Fugitives tended to use these as hideouts, but local militias and the members of the Ghost Sword knew to search them.\n\nTurmishan wines were often so full-tasting, they were always consumed on its own with no snacks nor any other food. These wine were an expensive export found in the [[Western Heartlands]] and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].<ref>",
            "Guesthouses": "{{fq\n| text   = Welcome to Erenar's Guest House! Stay here as long as ye'd like, but please:\n* Replenish any supplies you use\n* Chop extra firewood before you leave\n* Clean up after yourself!\n– [[Eranar Whittlestone]]\n| source = The sign at a typical Turmishan guesthouse.\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nTo give shelter and aid to travelers, the Turmishans erected small cabins along the roads and trails, in the shelter of trees. Most were small buildings with space for five or six persons, with fireplaces and chimneys, but some included roofed hay pens in which [[horse]]s could be stabled. These were free to use by anyone, but those who did were expected to restock any supplies they did use. Patrols of local militias checked these periodically and stayed in them when the weather was bad. Guesthouses were built and maintained by landowners on their properties, and they included stocks of food and firewood. They usually had friendly notices to guests out front and were as well-built, well-furnished, and well-maintained as one's own house. While vandals and careless guests were an issue, it was a point of pride to keep them in good condition—according to [[Arshen|one guesthouse owner]], \"...a guest house is the sign of a man's good nature in Turmish, so I can't let it get run down.\" Some were built or ornamented in a whimsical or amusing style. The uniquity of guesthouses encouraged idle folk to travel Turmish.\n\nSimilarly, folk dug wells along the main road from Alaghôn to Hlondeth. These were roofed and enclosed, lit by [[candle]]-[[lamp]]s, and were free for use by all. Militia patrols inspected and maintained these, including replacing the candles.",
            "Archery": "Archery was commonly practiced in Turmish, with many farmers being quite skilled with a [[longbow]] and proud of it. This was usually used to bring down flying birds for food, but was equally effective in defending homes.",
            "Calendar & Festivals": "The [[Calendar of Harptos]] was followed in Turmish as it was across Faerûn, along with its standard festival days. In addition, the Turmishans observed many local harvest festivals, holy days, and personal rites. The Dancing Ring cult held Dancing Nights on the final night of every month.\n\nOne day out of every nine, or more, Turmishans would take time off work to \"chase the sun\", when they would rest, spend time with family, practice or learn a new skill or magic, or do anything else of personal interest. Promising to do something \"on the ninth day\" usually meant \"when I have time\" or \"I'll get around to it.\"\n\nThere were only two major festivals that were celebrated across Turmish. On these days, all businesses and all but the most vital government offices would shut. These were:\n* The [[Feast of the Moon (Vilhon Reach)|Feast of the Moon]]: Also known as the \"Festival of Lovers\", this joyous occasion was celebrated throughout all of the Vilhon Reach during [[Highsummer]], on the first full moon after [[Midsummer]]. In the 1300s DR, it was a time of drinking, dancing, revelry, and even debauchery. Nevertheless, many couples were already married, married in the week before, or married on the night, for it was customary for newlyweds to consummate their marriages on this night too. Traditionally, lovers had trysts in new and unfamiliar locales, going to a previously arranged place separately along different routes before meeting up. In the 1400s DR, it was more a time for Turmishans to relax and enjoy their rewards and to spend time with friends and family. Turmishan merchants made sure to return home in time.\n* The [[Reign of Misrule]]: On [[Marpenoth 10]], a [[tenday]] after [[Highharvestide]], the citizens of Turmish would break their personal, religious, guild, and mercantile vows and social restraints by engaging in destructively exuberant celebrations, minor civil unrest, breaking things such as furniture and glass, and yelling and fighting with one another in the streets, so long as they didn't kill anyone or cause serious harm or destruction. Monks might break a vow of silence to talk and laugh, priests might break a vow of poverty to steal, and paladins might be rude and get into barroom brawls. Non-natives were prohibited from joining in these revelries, and were not excused for their actions if they did; they might be held liable for damages if caught up in it. It was a vital release of tension and pent-up aggression, allowing people to spill guilty secrets or settle feuds with rivals, neighbors, and family. Naturally, the Assembly of Stars didn't meet on this day. While it lasted no longer than a day, from dawn to dusk, and the memories might last a lifetime, it was a crime to even talk about what anyone did during a Reign of Misrule. Every Turmishan understood the customs of the Reign of Misrule, even children, it was so deeply ingrained in the culture."

        "Religion": "Turmishans worshiped a number of gods, including [[Chauntea]], [[Silvanus]],—rival sects of Talos and Bhaelros tended to meet in Turmish and fight for dominance, waging magical battles in Alaghôn's streets at night.\n\nLliira's following in Turmish grew greatly following the [[Time of Troubles]] after [[Waukeen]] went missing. The many merchants of Turmish began to switch their supplications to Lliira, Waukeen's friend and ally, making Lliira's church one of the wealthiest in Turmish and helping it become more accepted. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the Lliiran church had a major temple in Gildenglade.<ref>\n\nDeep in Turmish's countryside were several large temple-farms and garden-monasteries dedicated to Selûne, Chauntea, and Loviatar. They kept little in the way of wealth. Worship took place at outdoor altars, often located in glades, and focused on fertility rites. Popular stories of nude Turmishans running in the fields on moonlit nights were most likely exaggerated, however. A great temple of Loviatar in Turmish was destroyed during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.<ref > Long before, a grand many-spired temple to Selûne stood in the woods between the Alaoreum and Aphrunn Mountains. The priests there created the magical Ghost Swords that protected the realm. But in the early 300s DR, a raiding dragon obliterated the temple and slew the priesthood with it. Nevertheless, the Ghost Swords remained, whether through their magical might, the work of surviving priests through the ages, or the will of the Moonmother herself. Nothing remained of the temple by the 1300s DR, bar legends of deep buried vaults still filled with treasures and [[potion]]s.\n\nAt least three [[hierophant]] druids roamed Turmish's wilderness as of the 1360s DR.\n\nAn ancient cult active in Turmish was the [[Dancing Ring]], which accepted members of all races and faiths. Though mysterious, it was not secretive. Members believed that by holding dances and celebrating key events they could keep the realm of Turmish strong.{{Cite polyhedron/98/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: More Hidden Powers of Turmish|23-25}}",
        "History": "{{main|History of Turmish}}\nBuilt on the ruins of ancient [[Jhaamdath]], the beginnings of Turmish lay in the founding of Alaghôn in the {{YearlinkName|-37}}. Yet it was not until the rise to power of [[Dempster Turmish]] in the {{YearlinkName|132}} and his subsequent expansions that the modern nation was founded.\n\nTurmish alternated between being ruled by merchant families, strong lords, wizard conclaves, and even a dragon. However, following the resignation of dragonslayer-made-king [[Corwin Freas]] in the {{YearlinkName|1248}} and the establishment of the [[Assembly of Stars]], Turmish was governed as a democratic republic.\n\nThe [[Spellplague]] of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, and the ensuing [[Wailing Years]] hit Turmish hard, though they escaped the destruction that befell [[Chondath]] to the south in what became known as the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. The shrinking of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] harmed Turmish's trade, which was bitterly felt in a country so dependent on commerce. Constant raids from [[vampire]]s or [[Erlkazar]] made Turmishans wary of outsiders.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s DR and the concurrent [[Great Rain]], many crops failed in Turmish and famine was widely felt. The Emerald Enclave performed a great ritual that hastened the rains, bringing the Inner Sea to the level it was prior to the Spellplague, and magically restored the farmlands and crops of the country. With its great cities reconnected to the Inner Sea and to trade, along with an agricultural boom, Turmish enjoyed an upturn in fortunes by [[1489 DR]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Turmish was said to be riddled with extradimensional [[safehold]]s.<ref>\n\nSailors of Turmish had several superstitions about the waters around [[Myth Nantar]]. These were not entirely unwarranted, as the area are thought to be cursed and polluted by foul magic. To protect themselves, a crew might paint old runes and symbols on the outer hull to repel evil spirits. Not all captains believed these superstitions, but accepted them to improve crew morale.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Blood in the Water|7}}",
