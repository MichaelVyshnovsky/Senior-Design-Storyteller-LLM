settlement
Borlyth was once a fishing hamlet on Cloak Bay of the Sword Coast North that turned into a monster-infested ruin.
Borlyth stood on a sheltered anchorage immediately west of the Cloakwood, on the land bordering the forest and Borlyth Bay.
By the late 14 century DR, Borlyth was abandoned by its former inhabitants who fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster attacks. The ruined village was infested with monsters and its shipyard was left in ruins.
