Mharartel was a barony in Chessenta during the late 13 century DR.
Mharartel was northeast of Pandrik.
During the late 13 century DR, Mharartel was lightly forested rural lands, with woodlots, and pastures. There was at least one altar to Lathander. As of the turn of the 16 century, the land had turned into a part of Sebakar in the Vast Swamp, south of the River Adder.
As a barony, there was presumably a baron in charge.
Tarnsaera brandy was made in the barony, and there was horse breeding.
By the turn of the 16 century DR, Mharartel was long-vanished.
