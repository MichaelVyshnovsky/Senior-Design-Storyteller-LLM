The Channathwood was a small forest found in the southern Shaar near the border of Lapaliiya.
The forest sat along the southern edge of the Rathgaunt Hills north of the Swagdar running roughly east to west. It lay roughly halfway between the Great Rift in the east and the Shaareach in the west. The Channathwood was the source of the River Channath.
