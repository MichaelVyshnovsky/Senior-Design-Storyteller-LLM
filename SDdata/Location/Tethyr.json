        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "Inland Tethyr was relatively flat, though not without hills. \n\nThe [[Spires of Mir]] covered the southern highlands of Tethyr.\n\nThe [[Forest of Tethir]] was also known as the Wealdath and was located along the [[Trade Way]], south of the [[Small Teeth Mountains]]. In addition to the [[Suldusk]] and [[Elmanesse]] elven tribes, the Wealdath was home to a variety of [[fey]] creatures and other dangers, including [[dragon]]s, [[wyvern]]s, and [[lycanthropes]]. Rumors also claimed the forest hid ''[[portal]]s'' to the world of the [[lythari]], a species of shapechanging elves, though only the lythari knew the ''portals''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> locations and how to activate them.\n\nBarely considered mountains, the foothill area of the [[Omlarandin Mountains]] was known for its rare and prized [[omlar gem]]s. These gems were useful in the [[arcane]] arts and could be worth large sums.\n\nThe [[Snowflake Mountains]] laid at the far eastern edge of Tethyr. The range held some of the tallest mountains in Faerûn and formed a natural border between Tethyr, Amn, the [[Shining Plains]], and the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]]. The area was once the barony of [[Impresk]] within [[Erlkazar]]. The best known locations in the Mountains were the [[Edificant Library]], a place of worship of [[Deneir]] and [[Oghma]], and the childhood home of [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], later called [[Spirit Soaring]].\n\nLower than the Snowflake Mountains, but no less treacherous, the [[Starspire Mountains]] laid in central Tethyr. It is in this range, near the inactive volcano, [[Mount Thargill]], that the few remaining [[dwarves|dwarf]] clans of Tethyr lived.",
            "Climate": "Summers in Tethyr are long and temperate. Inland regions typically experience a wet season of about two weeks with heavy rain."
        },
        "Government": {
            "Village Lords and Harbormasters": "In the [[Lands of Intrigue]], which included the nations of [[Amn]] and Tethyr, smaller settlements and port townships elected their own village lords, mayors, and harbormasters. In larger cities, however, local nobles and other leading families generally had the right to appoint individuals to such positions, and used them to reward investors and other distinguished individuals. Should an election be held, voting rights were granted to stakeholders, businesspeople, property owners, and warehouse or shipyard landlords.\n\nIn all situations, voting took place in person in front of the local herald. Votes were cast vocally and formally witnessed by a group of clergy comprising representatives from all denominations worshipped locally. Candidates for most offices could be any local residents. Votes were counted by pebbles tossed in jars; each stone represented a vote and was put in the appropriate jar as the voter voiced their choice. These voting jars were labeled and safeguarded by the herald and witness priests. Election time could last as long as a [[tenday]], but more commonly lasted for two or three days. All that was needed to win most elections was a simple majority. If tampering was suspected during counting, the new election was held, and local clergy performed the duties of the office until a legitimate winner could be determined.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-09 - Village Lords in Amn and Tethyr}}"

        "Society": {
            "Architecture": "Buildings constructed close to the [[Trackless Sea]] tended to be constructed from stone and brick with tiled roofs that were slanted, because of the heavy rainfall near the coast. Buildings built more inland were more likely to be constructed with [[adobe]] walls with flat roofs."
        },
        "History": "Clan [[Ithal]] was the source of Tethyr's first line of kings, one of the original seven warrior clans during Tethyr's First Age. King [[Darrom Ithal]] unified Tethyr's tribes and was crowned their king in [[-212 DR]].\n\nTethyr fell under the control of the [[Shoon Imperium]] for many years, until [[Strohm I]] slew [[Amahl Shoon VII]] in [[450 DR]]. He founded the [[Strohm Dynasty]], which lasted until the death of King [[Strohm V]] in [[832 DR]], when the kingship passed to his son-in-law [[Tibor Mallorhen]]. The [[Mallorhen Dynasty]] was extinguished in [[841 DR]] when the family was assassinated. Leadership of Tethyr passed to Strohm V's second daughter, Queen [[Alisande]], who began the [[Queens' Dynasty]].\n\nThe Queens' Dynasty ruled Tethyr until [[959 DR]], when a cousin from the male line of Queen Sybille I seized the throne. King [[Mhoaran]] began the [[Lions' Dynasty]]. While this dynasty was marked by much strife, King [[Errilam I]] was known to be a just man and was well loved by his people. After his death during a hunting trip in the Forest of Tethir in [[1277 DR]], rumors spread that the forest's elves had assassinated him, leading to much elvish persecution from then on. The dynasty ended under the reign of King [[Alemander V]] in [[1347 DR]] when [[Castle Tethyr]] burned to the ground during a coup and wiped out the entire royal family. This started the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], in which hundreds of nobles and their families were killed.\n\nThe [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] followed this dark period, which lasted until the end of the [[Reclamation Wars]] in [[1369 DR]] with the crowning of Queen Zaranda Star Rhindaun and King-Consort Haedred III.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Major Cities": "[[Darromar]] was the new capital of Tethyr. This was truly the hub of the nation: it was growing with the influx of mercenaries and monster hunters. Students of the arcane also had a home as there was a small academy for those not desiring to travel south to Calimshan.\n\nDespite its smaller size, the town of [[Mosstone]] was of great importance because of its location on the [[Trade Way]]. Of additional note was its proximity with the forest, which made dealing with its inhabitants especially delicate. A powerful grove of [[druid]]s focused on working with and instructing the townsfolk on the proper care of the forest.\n\nTaking much from their neighbors to the south, [[Myratma]]'s strong resemblance to Calimshan was obvious. This was the main port for agricultural goods to and from the inlands. Due to Calimshan being so near, arcane arts were seldom practiced and never in abundance. Of special note, this was the home of the [[Jaguar Guard]]. These noble warriors were exported from their home in Maztica far to the west.\n\n[[Saradush]] was a metropolis within the land of Tethyr. Once a great bureaucratic center for the city's royal dynasty, Saradush fell into a period of decline following the [[Spellplague]]. Despite this, Saradush became an important waystation for trade involving the area surrounding the Lake of Steam. Given its proximity to several kinds of terrain, along with increased prominence as trade traffic with Riatavin increased, Saradush also became a haven for travelers and adventurers alike.{{Cite web/More of Waterdeep and Lands of Intrigue}}\n\nThe critical city of [[Riatavin]] allowed for trade through the Sea of Fallen Stars. The formerly Amnian city was largely overlooked by Amn's growing trade with Maztica and its [[Council of Six]], which resulted in its secession to Tethyr in [[1370 DR]]. Previously hidden [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s sprang forth in support of the secession, promising to aid against any actions from Amn.\n\nThe coastal city of [[Velen]] was a naval outpost, protecting against the Nelanther pirates. In addition, due to its coastal location, it was also home to a large seafaring and fishing community. It was rumored that [[ghost]]s haunted the city but the people appeared to be largely ignorant or uncaring concerning the hauntings. \n\nThe former capital of Tethyr, Zazesspur was still on many levels the glory of the surrounding cultures. It was cut in two by the [[Sulduskoon River]]. The city was ruled by a council of lords. Similar to Myratma, due to its relative distance to Calimshan, any practicing the arcane arts were lured south with the promise of salary and an easy life."
