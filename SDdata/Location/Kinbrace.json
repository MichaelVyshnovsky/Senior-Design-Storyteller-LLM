        "mainbody": "'''Kinbrace''' was an important farming town found in western [[Soravia]] in [[Damara]].",
        "Geography": "Kinbrace rested on the eastern banks of the [[Galena Snake]] near Soravia's border with [[Morov]]. The town and surrounding communities covered nearly {{SI|25|sq mi|k}} of fertile farming land that was vital for the duchy.",
        "Description": "One feature that made Kinbrace different than most other towns and cities in the [[Bloodstone Lands]] was its lack of a protective wall. Instead, Kinbrace used a series of six strategically placed castles, each controlled by a wealthy landowner, for its defense system. These landowners generally worked together, suffering through the occasional feud, for the collective benefit of the region.",
        "History": "The [[Zhengyi|Witch King]] took advantage of a period of shortsightedness between these wealthy landowners during his invasion of this area of Damara, naming Kinbrace as his capital in Soravia. Zhengyi installed a puppet-king to rule in his stead, who was quickly overthrown with the Witch-King's fall."
