        "mainbody": "inbrace was an important farming town found in western Soravia in Damara.\nKinbrace rested on the eastern banks of the Galena Snake near Soravias border with Morov. The town and surrounding communities covered nearly  of fertile farming land that was vital for the duchy.\nOne feature that made Kinbrace different than most other towns and cities in the Bloodstone Lands was its lack of a protective wall. Instead, Kinbrace used a series of six strategically placed castles, each controlled by a wealthy landowner, for its defense system. These landowners generally worked together, suffering through the occasional feud, for the collective benefit of the region.\nThe Witch King took advantage of a period of shortsightedness between these wealthy landowners during his invasion of this area of Damara, naming Kinbrace as his capital in Soravia. Zhengyi installed a puppet-king to rule in his stead, who was quickly overthrown with the Witch-Kings fall."
