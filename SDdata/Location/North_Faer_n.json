This desert swallowed the human empires and [[Lost Kingdoms|survivor-states]] of this region, remaining sparsely populated by scattered [[Bedine|desert tribes]] for centuries. The Netherese Empire reemerged in [[Faerûn]] during the 15{{th}} century – following the arrival of the [[Thultanthar]] [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] from the [[Shadowfell]] – but once again collapsed as it had millennia prior.",

The most notable of these were [[Melvaunt]] and [[Phlan]] in the north, the former power of [[Zhentil Keep]] in the west, [[Hillsfar]] in the southwest, and [[Mulmaster]] on the southern shore.",
