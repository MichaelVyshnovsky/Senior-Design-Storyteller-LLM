        "Geography": "Esford lay in the [[Dauntir]] region on the south bank of the [[River Esmel]], some distance north of the [[Imnescourse Trail]]. [[Shepherdston]] and [[Harvest House (Amn)|Harvest House]] lay to the west, while [[Esmeltaran]] and [[Gambiton]] were to the east.",
        "Trade": "The village was the last stop for barges on the Esmel on the way from [[Esmeltaran]] to [[Purskul]], and so local farmers often met there to buy goods from the river route. Barter was extremely common, and was even accepted at the village's trade post if coins weren't available."
