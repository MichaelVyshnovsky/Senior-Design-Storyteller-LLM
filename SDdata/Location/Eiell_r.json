        "History": "Eiellûr was drawn into the [[War of Three Leaves]] against [[Thearnytaar]] and [[Syòrpiir]] by the actions of assassins and spies from [[Ilythiir]] in {{Yearlink|-17100}}. \n\nEiellûr entered the [[Crown Wars|second Crown War]] by allying with Thearnytaar and declaring war against Ilythiir after Ilythiir destroyed [[Syòrpiir]] with fire in {{Yearlink|-11600}}. The [[Sable Wars|The Sable Wars]], which began in {{Yearlink|-11450}}, were a series of battles during the Second Crown War. Aided by a few allies from [[Keltormir]] and [[Shantel Othreier]], Eiellûr and [[Thearnytaar]] invaded [[Ilythiir]], aiming to reform or conquer the [[dark elves]] before they destroyed any more realms. Over half their forces were wiped out by the dark elves' corrupt magic.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-11400}}, the kingdom was isolated from its allies and destroyed with fire by the [[dark elves]] of Ilythiir. The Ilythiiri were aided by treacherous [[green elves]] seeking peace through appeasement.  \n\nOver the course of time, the ruins of Eiellûr vanished under the forest canopies of the [[Winterwood]].",
