        "mainbody": "The '''Tor of Swords''' was a [[granite]] upcropping on [[Pelleor's Praire]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. The abbey of [[Endar Aglandtor]], dedicated to the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[deity]] [[Haela Brightaxe]], was dug into a series of caverns at the base of the Tor.",
        "Geography": "The Tor lay next to one of the most northeasterly \"loops\" of the [[Winding Water]], northwest of the [[Hill of Lost Souls]] and south of the [[Marsh of Chelimber]].{{Cite web/Map of Faer√ªn 5th edition}}",
        "History": "The Tor of Swords once marked the northern border of the [[Helbryn]], the hunting preserve of the ancient dwarven kingdom of [[Oghrann]]\n\nAt some point before the {{YearlinkName|1}}, a quintet of [[magic]]al swords associated with the [[Netheril|Netherese]] successor realm of [[Anauria]] was entombed within the hill, hence the name Tor of Swords.\n\nIn time, adherents of Haela Brightaxe dug out the abbey of Endar Aglandtor at the base of the Tor of Swords, which became the headquarters of the militant religious order known as [[Haela's Host]]. Wielding the Tor's fabled Anaurian blades, the swordswomen of the Host kept the monstrous population of the nearby area in check.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Most tales confused the Tor of Swords with the nearby [[Dungeon of Swords]] in the [[High Moor]], causing most [[adventurer]]s to avoid the site.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Endar Aglandtor]], an abbey of Haela Brightaxe and the headquarters of Haela's Host."
