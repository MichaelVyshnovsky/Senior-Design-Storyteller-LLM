        "mainbody": "The Tor of Swords was a granite upcropping on Pelleors Praire in the Western Heartlands. The abbey of Endar Aglandtor, dedicated to the dwarven deity Haela Brightaxe, was dug into a series of caverns at the base of the Tor.\nThe Tor lay next to one of the most northeasterly \"loops\" of the Winding Water, northwest of the Hill of Lost Souls and south of the Marsh of Chelimber.\nThe Tor of Swords once marked the northern border of the Helbryn, the hunting preserve of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Oghrann\nAt some point before the , a quintet of magical swords associated with the Netherese successor realm of Anauria was entombed within the hill, hence the name Tor of Swords.\nIn time, adherents of Haela Brightaxe dug out the abbey of Endar Aglandtor at the base of the Tor of Swords, which became the headquarters of the militant religious order known as Haelas Host. Wielding the Tors fabled Anaurian blades, the swordswomen of the Host kept the monstrous population of the nearby area in check.\nMost tales confused the Tor of Swords with the nearby Dungeon of Swords in the High Moor, causing most adventurers to avoid the site.\n* Endar Aglandtor, an abbey of Haela Brightaxe and the headquarters of Haelas Host."
