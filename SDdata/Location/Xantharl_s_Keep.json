        "mainbody": "Xantharls Keep was a fortified village south of Mirabar. As of 1370 DR, it was home to a population of 475. It was known for its tall stone houses with steep roofs.\nAs its name suggested, Xantharls Keep featured a central keep, its surrounding village and a fortified wall.\nDuring the late 15 century DR, the keeps lordship was served Narbeck Horn, who  in turn reported to the marchion of Mirabar, by means of a sending stone.\nThe keep was protected by 150 defenders, over twice the population of the accompanying village.\nA number of heavy crossbows were mounted upon its outer wall.\nSome time after the War of the Silver Marches, the Frost giant Kaltivar laid siege to the keep with a small army of goblins, hobgoblins, and ogres equipped with goblin-huckers. The giant used the siege as a ruse while he sent a gang of Bugbears to find and capture the wanted shield dwarf criminal Worvil Forkbeard, who was hiding within the Falling Orc inn.\n* The Bear and Black Buckler An inn with beds warmed by bear-pelt covers.\n* The Falling Orc A smoky tavern run by the half-ogre Arzastra."
