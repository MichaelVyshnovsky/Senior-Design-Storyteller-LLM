        "Defenses": "The keep was protected by 150 defenders, over twice the population of the accompanying village.\n\nA number of [[crossbow|heavy crossbow]]s were mounted upon its outer wall.",
        "History": "Some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the [[Frost giant]] [[Kaltivar]] laid siege to the keep with a small army of [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[ogre]]s equipped with goblin-huckers. The giant used the siege as a ruse while he sent a gang of [[Bugbear]]s to find and capture the wanted [[shield dwarf]] criminal [[Worvil Forkbeard]], who was hiding within the [[Falling Orc inn]].",
        "Notable locations": "* [[Bear and Black Buckler|The Bear and Black Buckler]]: An inn with beds warmed by [[bear]]-pelt covers.\n* [[Falling Orc Inn|The Falling Orc]]: A smoky tavern run by the [[half-ogre]] [[Arzastra]]."
