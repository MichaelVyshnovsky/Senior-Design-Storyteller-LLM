The North Center was a ward of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Found in the Northwest District, this ward controlled all trade passing through the River Gate and the Gate of the Ghost. Most of the caravans entering Huzuz passed through the North Center.
A tasked administrator genie named Sandara al-Sahil ran the North Center. She was aided by a large contingent of mamluks of the Valiant.
