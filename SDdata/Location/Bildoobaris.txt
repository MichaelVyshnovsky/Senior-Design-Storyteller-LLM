'''Bildoobaris''', also simply called the '''Trade Fair''', was a large tent city and the unofficial capital of [[Narfell]] as of [[1479 DR]] that dominated the plains of Narfell for one tenday each summer.

==Activities==
Though certainly not a permanent location, the Trade Fair was home to upwards of 30,000 [[Nar]] every summer as members of the various tribes meet on the vast plains. The plains were covered for miles in every direction with thousands of hide tents while the Nar welcomed merchants from the west to trade goods. This was the only time of the year when foreigners were welcomed in Narfell. The festival was the largest and most important holiday in all of Narfell, with even the cruelest and most fierce Nar tribes joining the drinking, feasting, and trading that happened over the tenday.
