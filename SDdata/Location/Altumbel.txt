'''Altumbel''' was a secluded nation of fishermen and merchant-pirates located on the peninsula that extended into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. By choice, its people became isolationists and had little relations with nearby [[Aglarond]] or other neighboring countries.

==Geography==
The county neighbored Aglarond to the east and included the [[Archipelago of Altumbel|Thousand Swords]] among its territory.

===Geographical Features===
Altumbel's harsh landscape was dotted with temperate, wind-swept valleys that were not suitable for farming. There were no forests in the region. 

The coastline was shrouded in fog, obscuring a rocky descent into the sea. The cold waters were rich with sea life.

Off the coast, the rocky archipelago comprised similarly barren isles that were little more than floating rocks.

==Government==
Altumbel was governed by a Ruling Council that met in the capital city of [[Spandeliyon]]. Each of the nation's settlements each sent one representative to attend council meetings.

While many outsiders failed to make the distinction,

==Trade==
Throughout their history  the people of Altumbel were fishermen through and through. 

The names of their seafaring vessels were based on the goods they carried, like ''Spicesail'' or ''Timberhold''.

The [[Smokeflower House]] trading house originated in Altumbel. They moved goods to and from the cities of [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Tsurlagol]], and [[Procampur]].

==History==
When [[Jhaamdath]] was destroyed in the {{YearlinkName|-255}}, some of its peoples migrated to the region that would later be known as Altumbel. By the {{YearlinkName|250}}, they had settled many of the islands that composed the Thousand Swords archipelago.

In the {{YearlinkName|163}}, the region of Altumbel was "officialy established" as part of the [[Unther]]ite Empire. The settlers were only some meager pirates and those who sought to live far removed from others. Some people from the nation of [[Impiltur]] also emigrated to Altumbel around this time.

The country of Aglarond arose when the war between the local humans and the [[half-elves]] of the [[Yuirwood]] finally ended in the {{YearlinkName|1065}}. Those disgruntled humans who refused to live peacefully with the elves traveled west to the end of the peninsula, and founded the independent nation of Altumbel.

Around the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Sons of Hoar]] began to garner a significant following in Altumbel.

In the days immediately prior to the [[Spellplague]], the [[Simbul]]'s harsh punishment of pirates had put lie to the nickname of the City of Pirates.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Spandeliyon]], the capital of the region, was once known as the City of Pirates.
* [[Urbryur]], a gnomish village whose main export was [[chalk]]{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}}

==Inhabitants==
The Altumbellan people were highly suspicious of outsiders. Approximately one third of their numbers lived scattered among the Thousand Swords.
