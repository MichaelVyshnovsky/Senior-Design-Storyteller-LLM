        "mainbody": "The '''Thayan Plateau''', also known as the '''Plateau of Thay''', was the region within the [[Thay|nation]] in the [[Unapproachable East]] that encompassed the raised lands above the cliffs known as the [[First Escarpment]], set around the further-elevated mesa known as [[High Thay]]. While it was an idyllic homeland for the ruling [[wizard]]s up until the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], war and magical disaster left it a barren dystopia just a few mere decades later.",
        "Description": {
            "15{{th}} Century": "{{sectstub}}"
        },
        "Weather": "Throughout the existence of Thay, the [[Red Wizards]] developed great, complex spells that changed the weather atop the nation's grand plateau. The typically cold weather was altered to a more moderate range and rain regularly fell over the previously dry landscape.",
        "Economy": "The goods produced throughout the southern plateau were shipped across [[east Faerûn]] and as far north as the [[Vast]]. The grains of Thay provided much of the food consumed in the nations of [[Chessenta]], prior to its destruction, [[Impiltur]], the Vast and [[Wizards' Reach]].",
        "History": "During the [[War of the Zulkirs]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Szass Tam]] employed tactics that left much of the Thayan Plateau plagued by drought, famine and disease. Its land and waters were flooded, dessicated and even poisoned, leaving a desolate badlands dotted with few remaining verdant locales that had been protected by [[magic]].\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]] in [[1485 DR]], the Plateau of Thay ascended thousands of feet above its previous height. This catastrophic event erupted the volcanoes of [[Thaymount]], which in turn melted the peaks' glaciers. Flaming earth, stone and other debris fell from the mountains and wreaked destruction upon the already ravaged plateau, while volcanic toxic fumes poisoned the ash-filled skies.",
        "Notable Locations": "Many of Thay's greatest cities and keeps were located atop the Thayan Plateau. It contained much of the nation's central dominant tharchs including [[Eltabbar (tharch)|Eltabbar]], [[Delhumide (tharch)|Delhumide]], [[Pyarados (tharch)|Pyarados]] and most of [[Lapendrar]]. The southern half of the plateau was quartered by the nation's main trade routes: the [[High Road (Thay)|High Road]], which ran north-to-south, and the [[Eastern Way]], which stretched from [[Nethjet]], west of the plateau, east towards the [[River Thazarlm]]. \n\nAfter the Spellplague, the previously vibrant arteries of commerce were largely destroyed and became irrelevant to the Thayans of the 15{{th}} century. \n\n{{sectstub}}"
