The '''Shadowfire Cavern''' was a vast lava chamber found within [[Mount Hotenow]] in the [[Crags]] mountain range on the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Description==
Despite its name, Shadowfire Cavern was well-illuminated by flowing streams of magma and luminescent crystal formations.

==History==
[[File:Magma Elemental.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[magma elemental]] of Shadowfire Cavern.]]
The [[dwarven]] prospector [[Khalek]] became trapped within Shadowfire Cavern in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, while he was investigating growing geothermal pressure that was forming within. The culprit of this anomaly was a particularly powerful [[magma elemental]] under control of [[Ignazar]], general of the [[cult of Maegera]].

==Inhabitants==
A number of fiery [[elemental]]s, including [[fire archon]]s and at least one magma elemental laired within the cavern. [[Fire giant]]s loyal to [[Gommoth]] were known to roam within its depths as well.
