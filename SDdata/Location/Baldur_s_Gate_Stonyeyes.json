        "Description": "The neighborhood was home to a large community of [[half-orc]]s, many of whom worked as porters. They helped in transporting goods to and from caravans coming to Baldur's Gate, as their pack animals were not allowed within the city walls.",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[Bloody Hands]] gang was the most prominent criminal organization that operated within Stonyeyes, during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], under the leadership of [[Nine-Fingers]] and [[the Guild]]. Additionally, the [[Cult of the Dead Three]] also had a presence, infiltrating local businesses and commiting murders in the name of their dark gods.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Garynmor Stables and Menagerie]]: The renowned Baldurian animal-keepers maintained one of their stables in this neighborhood.\n* [[Hamhocks Slaughterhouse]]: Conversely this butchery reeked of animal blood and drove away local livestock."
