        "mainbody": "Labrands Folly was a massive subterranean waterway found in the Middledark beneath the Chultan Peninsula.\nThe waterway reached from the tip of Cape Talath to the Thingulph in Thindol, covering a distance of approximately  underground.\nAir shafts that reached to the surface were found along the entire length of the passage.\nThe waterway was named for its creator, the Halruaan wizard Labrand. In 336 DR Labrand used a powerful artifact called the Crown of the Mountain to carve the subterranean complex. It remained unclear as to what Labrand intended with the tunnels creation, but many speculated he tried to create a shortcut for trade to pass through without having to sail around the entire Chultan Peninsula. If that was the case then Labrand failed miserably since fierce tides raged through the tunnel because of the air shafts, making it impossible for ships to navigate.\nA city-state of Kuo-toa called Gathgoolgapool was found along Labrands Folly."
