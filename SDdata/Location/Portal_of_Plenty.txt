The Portal of Plenty,  also known as Chaunteas Blessing, was a portal connecting a Chauntean shrine in Archendale to a different world. It was used by the followers of the Earthmother to trade agrarian goods and knowledge with this worlds inhabitants.
The portal could be found in a shrine dedicated to Chauntea, located in a village of Archendale. It was known by many across the Dales, but outsiders believed the shrine to be a regular center of worship.
The portal was  wide and about  high. It was flanked by a pair of columns engraved with images of farming and of worship.
The portal could be activated for 6 seconds by touching a stock of wheat against the carvings on the columns. Once activated, anyone or anything could pass through.
During the midâ€“14 century DR, Chauntea granted a vision to some of her followers inhabiting another world, causing them to visit Toril. They arrived in Archendale, where they discovered that the local farmers worshiped the same goddess as they did, only using a different name. Consequently the Portal of Plenty was built to connect both worlds, allowing the faithful to trade agrarian goods and knowledge between worlds. This caused Archenfolk to acquire agricultural knowledge far ahead of their time.
However, in the early 1370s DR, the community of the other world was decimated by the assaults of a lich lord leading undead and fiendish armies. Monsters consequently started spewing from the portal, until a wizard was hired to close it using the gate seal spell. The spell was later dispelled, leading the Dalesfolk to believe a traitor was in their midst.
Some sages believed that the lich lord was trying to conquer Archendale as a stepping stone to attacking the rest of the Realms.
