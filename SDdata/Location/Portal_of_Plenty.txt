The '''Portal of Plenty''',  also known as '''Chauntea's Blessing''', was a [[portal]] connecting a [[Chauntean]] shrine in [[Archendale]] to a different world. It was used by the followers of the Earthmother to trade agrarian goods and knowledge with this world's inhabitants.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Harvest Gods:The Portal of Plenty}}

==Location==
The portal could be found in a shrine dedicated to [[Chauntea]], located in a village of Archendale. It was known by many across the [[Dales]], but outsiders believed the shrine to be a regular center of worship.

==Structure==
The portal was {{SI|8|feet|long=yes}} wide and about {{SI|9|feet|long=yes}} high. It was flanked by a pair of columns engraved with images of farming and of worship.

==Activation==
The portal could be activated for 6 seconds by touching a stock of [[wheat]] against the carvings on the columns. Once activated, anyone or anything could pass through.

==History==
During the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Chauntea granted a vision to some of her followers inhabiting another world, causing them to visit [[Toril]]. They arrived in Archendale, where they discovered that the local farmers worshiped the same goddess as they did, only using a different name. Consequently the Portal of Plenty was built to connect both worlds, allowing the faithful to trade agrarian goods and knowledge between worlds. This caused [[Archenfolk]] to acquire agricultural knowledge far ahead of their time.

However, in the early 1370s DR, the community of the other world was decimated by the assaults of a [[lich]] lord leading [[undead]] and [[fiend]]ish armies. Monsters consequently started spewing from the portal, until a [[wizard]] was hired to close it using the [[gate seal]] spell. The spell was later dispelled, leading the Dalesfolk to believe a traitor was in their midst.

Some sages believed that the lich lord was trying to conquer Archendale as a stepping stone to attacking the rest of the Realms.
