The '''Akanamere''' was a large freshwater lake,

==Description==
The Akanamere was a lake rich with fish, while its shores were some of the richest farmlands in [[Faerûn]].

==Government==
A kingdom of [[nixie]]s could be found underneath the waters of the Akanamere. The peaceful creatures engaged in trade with the humans of the Blade Kingdoms and were allied with them during the reign of Princess [[Krrrr-poka]]. Nixie political dignitaries were guests during the annual celebration of the [[Festival of Blades]]. Nixies of Krrrr-poka's kingdom aided fishing city-states of [[Zutria]] and [[Lomatra]] by driving schools of fish into fishing nets and guarding them against hungry [[pike (fish)|pikes]], common within the lake. Nixies received [[dried beef]] and squeeze bulbs filled with wine in exchange.

==Trade==
[[File:Akanamere.png|thumb|''A map of the Akanamere circa mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].''|350x350px]]
The Akanamere produced a rich catch of fish to the cities on its shores and the nixie population that dwelt in its waters. [[Eel]]s, [[stone crab]]s, and [[druth]] were the most common catch. Fresh fish was often sun-dried for storage or trade, and crab was stored in [[salt]]-filled [[barrel]]s. Dried fish was often used in stews and soups, shredded, and cooked in water. The Akanamere's eels were known for their nutty flavor, while flatfish had a distinct smoky taste that resembled [[pig]] [[bacon]]. Among other fish that was fished from the lake and traded by nixies were [[blowfish]], [[hogfish]], and [[singing fish]].

Apart from fish, the Akanamere served as the main source of freshwater for the western part of the nation of [[Chessenta]].

While the underwater inhabitants of the Akanamere traded with surface dwellers, the [[humanoids]] who inhabited the lake's shores used its waters for trade. The waters of the Akanamere held numerous trade sea routes between the local cities, as well as ships that traveled from afar via River Akax and the Bay of Chessenta.

==History==
Shortly before the opening of the [[Orcgate]], in [[-1076 DR]], a [[wizard]] [[Shan the Golden]] of the [[Great Rift]], discovered an ancient tomb underneath the waters of the Akanamere. There, Shan discovered the artifact known as the ''[[Sunphelm of Shandaular]]''.

A conflict consumed the Blade Kingdoms in the {{YearlinkName|1217}} and lasted until the {{YearlinkName|1218}}. The north-western shores of the Akanamere were lit ablaze by mercenary armies of [[Ugo Svarézi]]. The war badly damaged the city of [[Sumbria]], [[Kirenzia]] was torched and almost completely destroyed, while [[Zutria]] was attacked and conquered. The grand battle that concluded the [[Blade Wars]] took place at the gates of [[Lomatra]]. Nixies of Princess Krrrr-poka's kingdom joined the fray against an overwhelming force. Despite all odds, Lomatra defeated the invading armies and Ugo Svarézi – killed, further solidifying the relationship between the Blade Kingdoms and nixies of the Akanamere.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the eastern shores of the Akanamere became a field of battle between [[Cimbar]] and [[Akana]]. The conflict lasted for several months until the was moved south, further into [[Chessenta]].

The late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] brought a number of raids by [[troglodyte]] tribes of [[Traaskl Thorog]], led by [[Drukkul]]. Traaskl Thorog, or Middle Darklands of the [[Underdark]] located underneath Chessenta, was the origin of the strategic raids. Troglodyte of Chief Drukkul attacked lands between the Akanamere to the [[River Adder]], never striking the same area more than once per year.

In the calamity of the ''[[Spellplague]]'' that ravaged [[Toril]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the majority of the Akanamere was drained, turning the once-great lake into a shadow of its former self. The receding waters left the land to be reclaimed by wilderness. Its shores lost the nations that once stood there and were replaced with [[Akanûl]], pulled by the calamity from the world of [[Abeir]].

With ''Spellplague's'' end and the goddess of magic [[Mystra]]'s return that started in the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, the lands of Vilhon Reach were returned to Toril and the Akanamere reclaimed its waters, returning to its former size.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200224175103/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1231995991613673472| title = TheEdVerse on Twitter| accessdate = 27-12-2021| date = 27-12-2021}}

==Notable Locations==

*[[Akanamere Tomb]], an ancient burial pyramid located at the center of the lake, magically protected from water. Following the ''Spellplague'', the long-hidden entrance was open to ambitious adventures.

==Inhabitants==
Apart from a nixie kingdom, the waters of the Akanamere were inhabited by [[vodyanoi]] and [[lizardfolk]] tribes dotted the lake's shoers, as well as cities of the Blade Kingdoms and Chessenta. An occasional privateer ship can be seen sailing across the lake. [[Mudmen]] were reported seen in the Akanamere, brought to life by a magical flow of water that originated somewhere within the lake.

The northern shores often saw [[orc]]ish raids on cattle and [[sheep]] herders; however, they did not engage with [[human]] settlements. However, many peaceful members of the [[Flaming Spike]] tribe moved to [[Airspur]] and set to pursue mercantile careers.
