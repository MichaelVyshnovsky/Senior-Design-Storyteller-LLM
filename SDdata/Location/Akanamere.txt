The Akanamere was a lake rich with fish, while its shores were some of the richest farmlands in Faer√ªn.
A kingdom of nixies could be found underneath the waters of the Akanamere. The peaceful creatures engaged in trade with the humans of the Blade Kingdoms and were allied with them during the reign of Princess Krrrr-poka. Nixie political dignitaries were guests during the annual celebration of the Festival of Blades. Nixies of Krrrr-pokas kingdom aided fishing city-states of Zutria and Lomatra by driving schools of fish into fishing nets and guarding them against hungry pikes, common within the lake. Nixies received dried beef and squeeze bulbs filled with wine in exchange.
