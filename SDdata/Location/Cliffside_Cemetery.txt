The '''Cliffside Cemetery''' was the largest graveyard in [[Baldur's Gate]], located in the [[Outer City]] district of [[Tumbledown]], just west of [[Dusthawk Hill]]. It served as the final resting place for those Baldurians not wealthy or influential enough to be interred beneath an ancestral crypt or a temple of their choosing.

==Description==
Cliffside was composed of a labyrinthine network of headstones, tombs, sepulchers, and mausoleums, of varying size and grandeur. Collectively, it held the remains of a wide variety of individuals, from Baldurian citizens to wealthy merchants and even pirates.

==Defenses==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Gravemakers]] crew watched over the dead of Cliffside. They preserved their dignity by guarding them from grave-robbers, [[necromancer]]s, and unscrupulous followers of [[Myrkul]]. Unfortunately, they were also forced to protect the city from [[undead]] as bodies were periodically raised, despite their best efforts.

==History==
Long before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the land the cemetery was built upon actually housed the estate of the wealthy [[Szarr]] merchant family. After their downfall, the family's estate was turned into a massive public graveyard.
