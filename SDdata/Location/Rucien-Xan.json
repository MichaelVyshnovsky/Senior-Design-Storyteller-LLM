        "mainbody": "'''Rucien-Xan''' was a hidden [[elven]] city, allegedly, located somewhere in the [[Chondalwood]], the capital for the [[elf|elven]] realm of [[Nikerymath]].",
        "Description": "By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Rucien-Xan was a well-known legend across the Reach. Stories of elves and their wars with humans were told to children by their mothers. However, the existence of the city was doubted by many cynics who pointed out that even before the [[Retreat]], there was virtually no evidence of Rucien-Xan's existence.",
        "Defenses": "Rucien-Xan was often thought to be a mythical city undiscovered by numerous adventurers throughout its history. However, the hidden realm was veiled by [[Sehanine Moonbow]]. Even though the goddess rarely bothered herself with the events on [[Toril]], she personally weaved [[illusion]] magics that shrouded hired elven retreats, such as fabled [[Evermeet]], [[Myth Dyraalis]], and Rucien-Xan. Sehanine also took on the role of a guide and protector of the elves who traveled to the hidden cities.",
        "History": "The mythical hidden elven city of Rucien Xan was founded by refugees from [[Sy√≤rpiir]] in [[-6500 DR]]. The city became the first settlement of [[Nikerymath]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|-276}}, [[Jhaamdath]] clashed with the elven kingdom of Nikerymath. The nation was devastated, and the only city left standing was Rucien Xan. The kingdom's population lost nine-tenths of its elves. This forced the surviving elves to seek retribution. The Coronal and four High Mages became the oldest surviving elves from Rucien Xan, with all other citizens being under a century old. The High Mages of Rucien Xan retaliated in the {{YearlinkName|-255}}. The elves summoned grand magics that caused deaths of more than 60,000 [[human]]s and formed what would later become known as the [[Vilhon Reach]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|139}}, the forest of Chondalwood began being aggressively lumbered by the newly established [[Chondath]]an logging town of [[Shamph]]. Chondath, under the leadership of Lord [[Anthony Illistine]], delved deeper into Chondalwood, burning an even city of [[Ariel-than]] to the ground. Few elves survived, but they found refuge in Rucien Xan, the city considered a myth by most and undiscovered by outsiders.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the [[Moonstars]] did have an agent in Rucien-Xan, though obviously this was a closely guarded secret. [[Nuvian Eyes-Ashen]], the [[Crusader]] of [[Sehanine Moonbow]], was the regional agent for the Vilhon Reach and [[Shining Plains]] regions. ''Circa'' that year, an adventuring group led by [[Adamar Session]], [[bard]] of [[Starmantle]], spent six months searching for the mythical city of Rucien-Xan. Eventually, the troupe gave the attempts up,  finding no traces of it."
