        "mainbody": "ucien-Xan was a hidden elven city, allegedly, located somewhere in the Chondalwood, the capital for the elven realm of Nikerymath.\nBy the 14 century DR, Rucien-Xan was a well-known legend across the Reach. Stories of elves and their wars with humans were told to children by their mothers. However, the existence of the city was doubted by many cynics who pointed out that even before the Retreat, there was virtually no evidence of Rucien-Xans existence.\nRucien-Xan was often thought to be a mythical city undiscovered by numerous adventurers throughout its history. However, the hidden realm was veiled by Sehanine Moonbow. Even though the goddess rarely bothered herself with the events on Toril, she personally weaved illusion magics that shrouded hired elven retreats, such as fabled Evermeet, Myth Dyraalis, and Rucien-Xan. Sehanine also took on the role of a guide and protector of the elves who traveled to the hidden cities.\nThe mythical hidden elven city of Rucien Xan was founded by refugees from Sy√≤rpiir in -6500 DR. The city became the first settlement of Nikerymath.\nBy the , Jhaamdath clashed with the elven kingdom of Nikerymath. The nation was devastated, and the only city left standing was Rucien Xan. The kingdoms population lost nine-tenths of its elves. This forced the surviving elves to seek retribution. The Coronal and four High Mages became the oldest surviving elves from Rucien Xan, with all other citizens being under a century old. The High Mages of Rucien Xan retaliated in the . The elves summoned grand magics that caused deaths of more than 60,000 humans and formed what would later become known as the Vilhon Reach.\nIn the , the forest of Chondalwood began being aggressively lumbered by the newly established Chondathan logging town of Shamph. Chondath, under the leadership of Lord Anthony Illistine, delved deeper into Chondalwood, burning an even city of Ariel-than to the ground. Few elves survived, but they found refuge in Rucien Xan, the city considered a myth by most and undiscovered by outsiders.\nBy the , the Moonstars did have an agent in Rucien-Xan, though obviously this was a closely guarded secret. Nuvian Eyes-Ashen, the Crusader of Sehanine Moonbow, was the regional agent for the Vilhon Reach and Shining Plains regions. Circa that year, an adventuring group led by Adamar Session, bard of Starmantle, spent six months searching for the mythical city of Rucien-Xan. Eventually, the troupe gave the attempts up,  finding no traces of it."
