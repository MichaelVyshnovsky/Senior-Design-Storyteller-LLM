        "mainbody": "'''Lheshayl''' was a small city in the [[Shining Plains]] that prided itself on its cavalry and [[horse]] export.",
        "Geography": "The city sat on the southwestern side of the Shining Plains and was the only city on the west side. [[Rushing Hills]] laid to he the south-west of Lheshayl.",
        "Government": "A long line of chiefs ruled Lheshayl, and in [[1372 DR]], the city was led by Chief [[Entawanata]]. [[Assam]] was governed by a ruling council that consisted of representatives from Lheshayl and [[Ormath]]. Lheshayl had aspirations for sole control. However, it took no actions that could anger Ormath.",
        "Trade": "[[File:Lheshayl.png|thumb|''The city of Lheshayl and one of its famous [[Plainsteed]]s.''|617x617px]]\nThe small city produced high-quality horses - the [[Plainsteed]]s, as well as [[Riatavin]] and [[Saradush]] to the east.\n\nAgriculture was a small industry in Lheshayl, limited to several farms that grew [[wheat]] and [[rice]].\n\nHunting was a popular pastime in Lheshayl, attracting ambitious hunters from other regions during its many \"official\" hunting seasons, enforced by the [[Emerald Enclave]]. The hunting seasons usually were scheduled for late summer and autumn with an emphasis on [[Eleint]], [[Marpenoth]], and [[Uktar]]. Occasionally, depending on the winter, spring hunting seasons were announced to cull the population of herd animals. Individuals who violated the hunting seasons were themselves hunted by the local [[druids]] and non-human tribes of the Shining Plains.",
        "Culture": "Following the battle on the [[Field of Tears]], Chiefs of Lheshayl attended the annual commiserating crimony that took place on the [[Hill of Memories]].",
        "Defenses": "Lheshayl was protected by a sizable cavalry known as Riders, the biggest cavalry of the region with [[Sespech]] being the second largest. Even though Lheshayl's Riders were proud and well-trained cavalry, they showed vulnerability when forced to battle on foot.",
        "History": "The {{YearlinkName|150}} was the beginning of the period of the history of the [[Vilhon Reach]] called the [[Calmwaters]], for the economic growth and lack of any disasters or wars. During the Calmwaters, Lheshayl grew in size, becoming the center of civilization and trade in the Shining Plains. The export of horses from the Shining Plains began with supplying a mercenary army stationed in Ormath.\n\nFrom [[230 DR|230]] to [[239 DR]], King [[Dalagar|Dalagar \"Longwalker\"]] of [[Andlath]] supervised construction of the [[Tethir Road]] that blessed Lheshayl with trade connections to Turmish, [[Athkatla]], Ormath, Murann and other centers of trade.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|326}} a dispute between grazing rights between Ormath and Lheshayl escalated. Twenty-five thousand men - the armies of the two city-states fought a vicious battle for over a week on the Field of Tears too, but before it could be concluded, the [[wemics]] of the [[Tenpaw]] tribe attacked and drove both armies from the battlefield.\n\nThe {{YearlinkName|640}} brought a series of attacks by an increased population of [[saber-toothed tiger]]. The citizens of Ormath and Lheshayl and patrols of the Shining Plains were the targets. These deadly attacks completely devastated several trade caravans, and entire patrol parties were gone without a trace. The tiger attacks were stopped by the mercenary companies of the Shining Plains, securing profitable trade with [[Hlondeth]].\n\nThe [[Rage of Dragons]] of the {{YearlinkName|1018}} served a blow to the city of Lheshayl. The flight destroyed many of the city's structures with its inhabitants hiding in the basements of their torched homes all through the summer of that year.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Lheshayl attempted to drive the [[thri-kreen]] [[Krakk't]] tribe from the Rushing Hills to the south-east from the city. They planned to cut thri-kreen's food supply by stopping animals from wandering into the Rushing Hills. This only caused the Krakk't thri-kreen to start attacking caravans that traveled through the northern parts of the Hills. Eventually, Lheshayl adopted a semi-official policy to make sure to drive animals into the Rushing Hills to avoid further attacks.\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Lheshayl became plagued by horse thefts and slaver abductions. Travelers who fell victim to the slavers were sold off in the city of [[Nimpeth]]. The Chief was more concerned with horse-stealings and cared little for the abductions.",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Inns & Taverns": "*[[Bit & Bridle]], one of the two popular inns that catered to travelers in Lheshayl.\n*[[Chief's Rest]], the most expensive inn in Lheshayl.\n*[[Saddle of the Plains]], along with the Bit & Bridle, a popular inn in Lheshayl.\n*[[Sugarcane]], a small seedy tavern located in the lower-class area of the city.",
