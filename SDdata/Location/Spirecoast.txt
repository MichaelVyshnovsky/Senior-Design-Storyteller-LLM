Spirecoast was an ancient Netherese outpost built in the Sword Mountains during its early period of expansion.
The outpost was located within the foothills of the southern Sword Mountains, west of what would become the Westwood.
Spirecoast came about during Netherils Silver Age ( to ), when the Terraseer directed Netheril to explore its western frontier. Reported among the first promising sites in , alongside Old Owl Well and Kryptgarden Falls, Spirecoast served as a caravan stop, watering station, and fortified watchpost amid Netherils westward expansion. Secured with warriors and overseen by arcanists, it was equipped with crystal balls that were used to spy on the surrounding area, especially the nearby elves of Illefarn. The outpost was also fitted with a mythallar that powered quasimagical items, but the need for expeditions to venture further and further afield caused the creation of some of Netherils first proper magical items that could be used anywhere.
