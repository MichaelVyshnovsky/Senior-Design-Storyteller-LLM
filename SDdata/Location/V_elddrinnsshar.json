        "mainbody": "'''V'elddrinnsshar''' was a [[drow]] city located on a mile wide island in the centre of the [[Moondeep Sea]]. The city's name seems to be composed of two drow words that have been given translation (Veldrin and shar meaning concealment and mind respectively) and thus the name could mean Concealed Mind or some variation there upon.",
        "History": "Like most drow cities, it was dominated by the clergy of [[Lolth]], but even her divine magic couldn't protect her subjects from the [[Ascomoid Plague]]. The last inhabitant died in [[1278 DR]] and nothing was heard of the place until ten years later when [[duergar]] looted whatever remained.\n\nIn [[1337 DR]] a priestess of [[Kiaransalee]] named [[Larynda Telenna]] brought with her a group of acolytes who aided her in constructing the [[Acropolis of Thanatos]] in the ruins of the city. The black marble temple attracted a thousand more of the faithful and since then, it has been used as a base from which to launch attacks on the [[Cult of the Goat's Head]], a group dedicated to [[Orcus]] that inhabited [[Vaasa]] above them. Little do the drow know, but without them, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] may not have been able to defeat [[Zhengyi]] as readily as he did.\n\nIn [[1377 DR]] the [[Darksong Knights|Darksong knight]] [[Cavatina Xarann|Cavatinna Xarann]] led an expedition to the Acropolis of Thanatos in an effort to discover the cause for the augmentation of the [[Faerzress]]. Discovering that the massive amounts of voidstone the [[Crones of Thanatos]] were accumulating was the cause, the expedition managed to erase [[Kiaransalee]]'s name from everyone's mind and the voidstone was neutralized.All the remaining undead that populated the island and still survived after Kiaransalee's disappearance were destroyed by the forces of the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].",
