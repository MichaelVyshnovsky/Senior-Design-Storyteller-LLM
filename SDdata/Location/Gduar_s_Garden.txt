Gduars Garden was a small cavern covered in fungi. A fungal treant named Gduar kept watch over it the aberration was in possession of the Third Imaskarcana. 
It was a small cavern where the creature cultivated fungi, often sending animate monsters to acquire live prey for it. The fungi in the zone made for a beautiful display, with glowing fungal caps, and a bioluminescent haze of digestive spores. Anyone in the area with those spores would be slowly killed by them. 
Gduars Garden was in the upper reaches of the Darklands, beneath the Chondalwood. 
Amongst other monsters, there were gelatinous cubes, shambling mounds, tendriculos, and a gray ooze. The deepest part of its lair, Gduars lair, overlapped with a powerful earth node. Gduar kept a small amount of loot, including the Third Imaskarcana. 
Gduar sent the animate fungi in the cave out to hunt for meat from time to time. One of the shambling mounds was infused with violet fungus, which changed its abilities somewhat.
