'''Gduar's Garden''' was a small cavern covered in fungi. A fungal [[treant]] named [[Gduar]] kept watch over it; the aberration was in possession of the ''[[Third Imaskarcana]]''. 

==Description==
It was a small cavern where the creature cultivated fungi, often sending animate monsters to acquire live prey for it. The fungi in the zone made for a beautiful display, with glowing fungal caps, and a bioluminescent haze of digestive spores. Anyone in the area with those spores would be slowly killed by them. 

==Geography==
Gduar's Garden was in the upper reaches of the [[Darklands]], beneath the [[Chondalwood]]. 

==Inhabitants==
Amongst other monsters, there were [[gelatinous cube]]s, [[shambling mound]]s, [[tendriculos]], and a [[gray ooze]]. The deepest part of its lair, Gduar's lair, overlapped with a powerful [[earth node]]. Gduar kept a small amount of loot, including the ''[[Third Imaskarcana]]''. 

Gduar sent the animate fungi in the cave out to hunt for meat from time to time. One of the shambling mounds was infused with [[violet fungus]], which changed its abilities somewhat.
