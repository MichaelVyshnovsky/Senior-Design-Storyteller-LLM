'''Nora-ko''' was a lake located in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
Nora-ko was located in [[Miyama Province]] on the island of [[Shinkoku]]. It was known for its unfathomable depth. The lake was so deep it extended into a vast subterranean realm, connecting with an intricate network of underground rivers and seas.  From these dark depths, nightmarish and monstrous beings had been known to emerge, instilling an evil reputation upon the lake, which understandably discouraged the local peasants, such as the residents of [[Ibara]], from venturing onto its waters for any reason.

==History==
[[Amaterasu]] once hurled a flaming coal into the lake. Shortly after, the mysterious island of [[Norijo]] arose.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Rowboat Shrine]]
