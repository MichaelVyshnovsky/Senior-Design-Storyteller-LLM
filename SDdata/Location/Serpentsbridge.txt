The '''Serpentsbridge''' was found northwest of the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]], set in between the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]] and [[Castle Daggerdale]], in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]]. It provided a passage, 50 feet (15 meters) over the mighty [[River Ashaba|Ashaba river]] along the [[Tethyamar Trail]].

At first glance, the bridge appeared to be a normal, albeit weathered, stone bridge. Upon closer inspection one could see indents and ridges in the stone, which appeared to move as it if were a writhing mass of [[snake]]s. Despite its appearance, the bridge was perfectly safe to cross.
