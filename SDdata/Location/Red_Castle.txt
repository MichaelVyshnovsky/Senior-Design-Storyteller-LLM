'''Red Castle''' was a stronghold of [[goblins]] and [[hobgoblins]] in [[Thar]]. It was home to the [[Red Claws]] tribe.{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: The Tribes of Thar}}

==Description==
The castle was built out of a massive ruined [[ogre]] fortress, and so the doorways, stairwells, and ceilings were far too large for the [[goblinoids]] who had come to inhabit the ruin during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. This led them to construct their own network of stairs and mezzanines within the existing rooms out of stone and timber.

==Geography==
Red Castle was located in southwestern Thar. It was west of the [[Tormel River]] and about 20 miles (32 kilometres) north of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] coast where the road between [[Phlan]] and [[Melvaunt]] lay.

==Defenses==
The walls of the ruined fortress were massive and the Red Claws were one of the larger goblinoid tribes in Thar. A pack of [[worgs]] prowled the trails leading to the Castle.

==History==
The original structure was built in the ancient days of [[Vorbyx]]'s [[orc]] and ogre kingdom of Thar.

During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century, it was occupied by the Red Claws, who dubbed it "Red Castle." Led by the warlord [[Hashrad]], the tribe took advantage of the Castle's proximity to the road to extract tolls and bribes from caravans travelling along the northern coast of the Moonsea.
