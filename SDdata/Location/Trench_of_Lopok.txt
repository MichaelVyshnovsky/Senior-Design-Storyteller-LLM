The '''Trench of Lopok,''' was one of three deep ocean trenches in the undersea realm of [[Serôs]].

==Etymology==
The name of this trench was derived from the [[locathah language|locathah]] word for [[kraken]].

==Geography==
This deepwater trench ran from north to south in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and was located west of the underwater [[Mountains of Volar]]. It like the other three trenches of the Inner Sea were considered to be part in the Underdeep Depth, a depth so deep and frigid that sunlight never reached it.

The Trench of Lopok had a steep decline to the bottom of the sea, its sides descending into a near vertical slant. Though attempts were made to determine its depth by plumbing lines, which found ground at no more than {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} beneath the sea floor, the trench's true depths were unknown.

==History==
''Circa'' [[-10400 DR]], a triton architect known as [[Vodos]] swam into the Trench of Lopok and was never seen again.

In {{YearlinkName|-9833}}, the [[First Serôs War]] ended with the fall of a major sahuagin kingdom within this trench.

In {{YearlinkName|-3309}}, krakens emerged from this trench and wrecked the [[Numosi]] and [[Jhimari]] schools of the [[Dukars]].

In {{YearlinkName|-1530}}, [[Coronal]] [[Essyl]] of [[Aryselmalyr]] sent agents on an expedition into the Trench of Lopok. They came back alongside three [[fiendish]] kraken servants of [[Dagon]], who carried an [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Emerald Eye]]''.

In {{YearlinkName|-788}}, [[Vaequiis II]] of Aryselmalyr launched the [[Fifth Serôs War]] against the [[shalarin]] kingdom of [[Es'krin]] and formed an alliance with a pair of krakens from the trench, [[Borapalys]] and [[Rylurkarth]].<ref name=GHR-p40>

Around the late 1360's [[DR]], the kraken [[Slarkrethel]] was having members of his organization the [[Kraken Society]] construct a [[krakengate]] within the trench.

==Inhabitants==
Clustered around the upper cliffs entrance of this trench were three [[triton]] kingdoms &mdash; [[Ahlorsath]], [[Pumanath]], and [[Vuuvaxath]]s &mdash; known collectively as the [[Triton Protectorates]]. Ahlorsath rested directly on its eastern cliff edge, The Triton Protectorates worked collectively to guard the trench from those who sought to delve its depths and the evils that sought to escape it. When questioned, tritons would vaguely refer to the latter threat as "[[Those Who Sleep Below]]" and that it was their sacred duty to guard against them.

The two species that were known for certain to dwell within its depths were krakens and [[morkoth]]s. But if morkoths were ever spotted trying to enter the trench, tritons would make certain they were slain. And prior to the First Serôs War, a kingdom of sahuagin also lived within its depths.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was alleged by some that morkoths and [[kuo-toa]]s first arose from this trench. This lead speculation of the existence of dark gods dwelling within the trench's depths. Both groups did believe that the gods of their ancient myths were imprisoned within its depths, but were guarded by the tritons.

The early morkoth theocracies within Serôs believed that their gods slept within its depths and that only fervent prayer could one day awaken them.
