        "mainbody": "e [[Gray Harbor]] of Baldur's Gate was one of the largest, busiest and most popular ports-of-call found on the western coast of Faerûn, handling a wide variety of cargoes that rivaled even the sprawling ports of [[Calimshan]]. Due to the fact trade was not tied to any individual's [[Alignment|moral alignment]], anyone conducting business in a non-harmful manner was welcome to trade in the city. By virtue of this tolerant outlook, Baldur's Gate had become the greatest center of trade along the entire Sword Coast in the 15{{th}} century, out-competing both Waterdeep and Amn. \n\nFor years, Baldur's Gate minted its own [[silver]] [[trade bar]]s, the most common variety of which was a 1 lb (0.5 kg) bar worth 5 [[gp]]. More importantly, the city also set the value for this form of currency and regulated its use in trade.\n\n[[File:Bg street stalls.png|thumb|373x373px|''Market stalls in Baldur's Gate.'']]\nBaldur's Gate sponsored nearly 90 professional guilds, from seafarers and financiers from the Upper City, to loremasters, brewmasters, metalworkers and nearly every skilled tradesperson in between. While the honest and once-powerful mercantile guild known as the [[Merchant's League]], previously dominated trade in the city, it was banned by the Council of Four and forced to operate in secret. Similarly, the secretive collective of noble-merchants known as the [[Knights of the Shield]] operated in an unofficial capacity.

The market attracted the best textile weavers, seamsters, and gown makers, including [[Xanda Pennywell‎]] of [[Liam's Hold]].\n\nAs of the mid-1300s DR, stone was usually imported from [[Mirabar]] via [[Luskan]] for use in construction, having been magically transported from up north. This feat of arcane conveyance was quite expensive.",
        "Geography": {
            "Weather": "The region surrounding Baldur's Gate received an abundance of drizzling rain and sleet with frequent-occurring fog that rolled through the city's streets. This excessive precipitation was well-mitigated with an advanced water system where underground basins collected the run off rainwater, maneuvering it through subterranean aqueducts that emptied it into massive cistern beneath the [[Temples District]].\n\nDespite the city's engineering and cleanliness, this continual rain led to regular growth of mildew accompanied by a musky smell that permeated the city's cellars."
        },
        "Society": {
            "Customs": "Unlike other cosmopolitan cities, Baldur's Gate was home to few formal festivals and gatherings. In addition to celebrating  [[Highharvestide]] in autumn, Baldurians celebrated ''The Breaking'' every spring, marking the day when the last hunks of ice broke away from the Gray Harbor, freeing it for safe trade. They also held public celebrations for [[Returning Day]], which commemorated Balduran's return to his home city following his famous expedition across the [[Trackless Sea]].\n\nEvery so often, Baldurians would gather together on a street around a grouping of crates, barrels and other impromptu seating to share stories and tales with one another. These ''cobble parties'', so named for the cobblestone roads on which they were hosted, were marked by special \"rose-red\" torches that could be purchased from the [[Felogyr's Fireworks|local fireworks shop]].",
            "Religion": "Like most great cities, Baldur's Gate had many places of worship scattered across its districts. For instance, [[Twin Songs]] accepted all faiths and hosted a great diversity of temples and shrines dedicated to nearly every deity. Even shrines devoted to the worship of [[Evil domain|evil]] powers, such as [[Bane]] and [[Bhaal]], were tolerated by the city's [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers. \n\nDespite the city's inclusiveness, three deities predominated the worship of Baldurian citizens. For favor and safety at sea, the veneration of [[Umberlee]] has been a mainstay throughout their history. The favor of [[Tymora]] was often sought for greater wealth and prosperity with regard to trade, gambling and mercantile endeavors. Lastly, as continual expression of gratitude for the technological blessings bestowed upon the city, the worship of [[Gond]] was widespread, even beyond his temple and museum.\n\nIn addition to the myriad of religious groups that flocked to the city's temples, a number of small cults and esoteric societies kept their home within the Gate.",
            "Demonym": "People and things from Baldur's Gate were known as \"Baldurian\".{{Cite polyhedron/74/The Everwinking Eye: Words To The Wise}} The term \"Balduran\" was ''never'' used—misusing the founder's name even like this was a grave insult to his memory and the city alike.",
            "Heraldry": "[[File:Baldur's_gate_coat_of_arms-5e.jpg|thumb|220px|''The coat of arms of Baldur's Gate.'']]\nThe city's coat-of-arms was a single ship, with raised sails, floating across still waters in front of a clear blue sky. While the ship represented both the city's role as a trading hub and its founder, Balduran, the calm sea signified its peaceful neutrality and the sky its promising future."
        },
        "Government": {
            "City Officers": "The Council of Four were served by five deputies, city officials that oversaw their subordinate bureaucrats and maintained the daily needs of Baldur's Gate. Their titles and responsibilities were as follows:\n\n* [[Harbormaster]]: Managed operations of the [[Gray Harbor]], assigned tariffs and taxes on imported goods, and maintained the records of all goods shipped in or out of the city\n* [[High Constable and Master of Walls]]: Castellan of the [[Watch Citadel]]\n* [[Master of Drains and Underways]]: Maintained operations of the city's drains, [[Baldur's Gate/Sewers|sewers]], waterways and aqueducts\n* [[Master of Cobbles]]: Oversaw construction and maintenance of all city roads, bridges and non-water-related, stone infrastructure\n* [[Purse Master]]: Collected taxes, invested city funds, directed payment to city officials,",
            "Taxes": "Historically, the Baldurian people had a complicated relationship with taxation at the hands of city officials. Excessive gate tolls incited a transformative revolution in the city in its formative years, By the 15{{th}} century, city officials collected tolls from passersby at nearly every cite gate, through a vast, far-reaching bureaucracy that was constantly under threat of corruption.",
            "Laws": "[[File:Baldur's Gate CLB.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''[[Baldur's Gate (gate)|Baldur's Gate]], the actual gate the city was named after.'']]\nThe government of Baldur's Gate maintained a strict and complex legal code that consisted of a series of regulations, official decrees, and treatises that were nigh incomprehensible for anyone but the city's barristers and some patriars. By and large, laws favored these individuals along with foreign diplomats, the Flaming Fist, and members of the Watch. Citizens of the city proper and those living in the Outer City were afforded far fewer considerations. Some of the local laws included citizen and consumer-friendly ''Public Health Act'' and the ''Civilian Protection Order'' and their violation, determined by consumer complaints, was investigated by the agents of the Council of Four. Targets of such investigations were ordered not to interfere and not to leave the Gate or be held in contempt of the Council. That being said, anyone who obeyed the laws could walk freely through the city's streets.\n\nAnyone caught in the act of breaking the law was immediately apprehended and punished, either by the Watch or the Flaming Fist. Typically, the punishment fit the crime. Lesser crimes, such as violence or thievery, warranted a public whipping or removal of a finger. Those who broke agreed-upon contracts were sentenced to forced labor while disturbing the peace or public lasciviousness led to public shaming by night in the stocks.\n\nThe city of Baldur's Gate issued hostelry licenses to proprietors of inns and taverns within the city walls. Lodging business could not legally operate without said license.",
            "Crime": "[[File:Criminals.png|thumb|373x373px|''Criminals in action in Baldur's Gate.'']]\nThroughout its history, various thieves guilds had risen and fallen in Baldur's Gate, including the one led by [[Alatos Thuibuld]], [[the Guild]], led by [[Astele Keene|Nine-Fingers]] emerged as the predominant thieves' organization in Baldur's Gate. Nearly all of the smaller gangs of the Outer and Lower City regions owed at least some obedience to this influential organization.",
            "Foreign Relations": "Throughout its history, Baldur's Gate had little stake in the affairs of others. For the most part, the city was respected as a neutral power, that never involved itself with the politics and conflicts that arose between the other states of the Sword Coast and the Western Heartlands. Perhaps more importantly, Baldur's Gate, while undoubtedly a rich prize, was so well-defended by its massive walls and well-trained Flaming Fists soldiers that few ever seriously considered invading and occupying the city.\n\nHistorically, Baldur's Gate has had a long enmity with its southern neighbor, [[Amn]], which nearly resulted in war during the iron crisis of the 1360s. Over the next century however, the only major threats to Baldur's Gate were the pirates operating out of the ruins of [[Luskan]] or the merchants of Waterdeep, who resented the city's continually-growing wealth and power."

        "Defenses": {
            "Military": "While the Fist always kept a strong contingent within the city's walls, they doubled as the city's standing army and were free to hire themselves out in external conflicts as long as they were never aligned against the city. After a century of serving as defenders of the city, they had become so entwined with the fate of its well-being, they operated as the ''de facto'' police force for domestic concerns and its bulwark for threats from abroad.\n\nIn addition to the 1,700-plus soldiers of the Flaming Fist, the Grand Dukes commanded a navy of a half dozen ships with crews of at least 40 men each."
        },
        "History": {
            "Founding": "Long before the land was settled, the lee of the plateau where Baldur's Gate would one day stand was known as [[Lok's Fist]]. It was ruled by a [[hill giant]] named [[Lok]]. Only after his death, sometime before the [[0 DR|Year of the Rising Flames, 0 DR]], the first fisher settlement sprung into existence – the village of Loklee. It was believed that at some point prior to the [[-359 DR|Year of Boiling Moats, -359 DR]], the then mortal Bhaal performed his first murder in a back-alley of this very region of Faerûn, the blood from which eventually formed into the dagger ''[[Bloodthirst]]''.\n\nWith time, the harbor-settlement that came to be known as Baldur's Gate became a well-hidden meeting place for pirates, scavengers and \"ghost lighters\". These naer-do-wells used lights to trick ships sailing through the foggy coast, running them aground before pilfering their goods. After looting what they could, they sailed up the River Chionthar to the small bay, to their secluded haven called '''Gray Harbor'''. By the {{YearlinkName|204}}, Gray Harbor and the village of Loklee that supported it were well known as a port of call for ships from across the Sword Coast. The settlement had a shipyard and visitors' wharves.\n\nIn olden times, the seafaring hero [[Balduran]] returned home to Gray Harbor, from a voyage to the far-off continent of [[Anchorome]], far beyond the [[elven]] isle of [[Evermeet]]. He had accumulated great wealth on this journey. After hiding some of his riches away in hidden caches, he ordered a great granite wall to be built for the protection of his home. Soon after, Balduran set sail on a second voyage to the continent and subsequently vanished, never to return.\n\nAfter Balduran vanished, sometime in the mid-1000s DR, local farmers took control of the wall's construction and used it to protect their own holds and farmsteads, rather than the harbor. Nearby townsfolk and other outsiders flocked to the fledgling town for protection and the hamlet swelled in size. The walled region of Gray Harbor came to be known as \"Old Town\", while newly-constructed buildings, between the southern wall and the harbor, were built in the portion thereafter known as \"Heapside\". And by the {{YearlinkName|446}}, the settlement was a city widely known as Baldur's Gate. Some scholars said that the name \"Baldur's Gate\" was already in existence sometime before the {{YearlinkName|300}}.",
            "Tax Revolt": "The division of the town by its great wall created a schism between the landowners of Old Town and Balduran's former associates, the captains and other seafarers of Gray Harbor. The Old Towners taxed the carts coming north from the harbor, through [[Baldur's Gate (gate)|Baldur's Gate]], which led to the ire of the seamen and their eventual refusal to pay.\n\nAs their anger turned to action, the smugglers, pirates and merchants of Heapside breached Baldur's gate and stormed Old Town by force. Just before they laid siege to the keep of High Hall, the four most-senior sea captains argued for the farmer-lords' surrender. After a quick vote, a truce was struck between the two parties and the retired captains were installed as leaders, jokingly known as \"Dukes\", of the rapidly-growing city that was earnestly renamed Baldur's Gate.",
            "Expansion": "Following the founding of the nation of Amn, trade skyrocketed in Baldur's Gate and the city expanded. This propensity secured the renewed connection between Old Town, which came to be known as the Upper City, and Heapside, now called the Lower City. The fate of all Baldurian citizens were entwined as one, a significance that was reflected in the expanded construction of the city wall. The bluffs of the Lower City were protected by two extensions of the Old Wall that continued south to the northern shores of the River Chionthar.\n\nThe city became the most powerful force in the Western Heartlands and despite its neutrality, joined the Lords' Alliance. The city was only recorded to have been called upon by the Alliance once, in the [[1235 DR|Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR]], when the [[Black Horde|eponymous legion]] of [[orc]]s attempted to invade. They sent their top military general, [[Eldrith the Betrayer|Eldrith]], to drive them off. While she achieved victory at first, she eventually betrayed Baldur's Gate and was killed in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]] by Baldurian forces.",
            "14{{th}} Century": "[[File:Baldur's-Gate-city-map.png|thumb|right|250px|''Pre-Spellplague city map.'']]\nThe [[Flaming Fists]] began operating in Baldur's Gate in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok Anchev]] orchestrated [[Iron crisis|a major conspiracy]] to send the city to war with [[Amn]]. The plan failed and within two years all Bhaalspawn were killed due to the actions of the future Grand Duke, [[Abdel Adrian]].\n\nLater that year, the city was nearly overwhelmed by the scores of refugees that were displaced from their homes by the [[War of the Shining Crusade|conflict]] surrounding the [[Caelar Argent|Shining Lady]] and her [[Shining Crusade|crusade]]. The Flaming Fist joined with nearby armies to form a [[Coalition]] that met the rising threat at [[Dragonspear Castle]].\n\nA group known [[Xantam's Guild]] moved into Baldur's Gate early in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]]. Three adventurers, [[Vahn]], [[Kromlech]], and [[Adrianna]] arrived and thwarted the guild's plans in the city. Joined by the [[Harpers]], they discovered the thieves guild to be only part of a larger plot involving [[Eldrith|Eldrith the Betrayer]] and her dark alliance.\n\nIn the [[1385 DR|following decade]], Faerûn suffered the [[Spellplague]], a cataclysmic event that reshaped both civilizations and the land itself. Fortunately, Baldur's Gate was unharmed from the effects of the blue fire that rained from the sky. As it was known throughout Faerûn as an \"open city\", the Gate became a haven for a great number of refugees that fled the destruction that wracked the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Within a matter of years, the population of the city tripled. Mercifully, the city was able to support itself following these years of intense growth and expansion.",
            "Mid 15{{th}} Century": "During the mid-1400s, the Grand Duke [[Valarken]], General [[Ikhal]] and the [[Band of the Red Moon]] attempted to usurp the leadership of Baldur's Gate. The failure of his attack led to the reformation of the Baldurian government, with the newly-formed Parliament of Peers offerring assistance to, and electing the members of, the Council of Four.\n\nBy the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR]], Baldur's Gate was Faerûn's most powerful and important city, and it was once again stable. At this time, it was no longer bothered by Valarken and Amn. It maintained a positive relationship with the nation of [[Elturgard]] and the other powers of the Western Heartlands. However, the expansion proved to turn the city on its heels, threatening to send it into civil war.",
            "Murder in Baldur's Gate": "While making a public speech on Returning Day, in the [[1482 DR|Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR]], Grand Duke Abdel Adrian was attacked by a man named [[Viekang]], the only other remaining Bhaalspawn. Although it was unknown who emerged as the victor, it was known that both men died—one at the hands of his mortal sibling, the other after having transformed into the [[Slayer]], an avatar of the long-dead Bhaal. \n\nThe remaining Council of Four blamed the Grand Duke's death on agents of [[the Guild]], the city's most prevalent thieves' group, and enlisted a group of adventurers help investigate the tragedy.<ref group=\"note\">While [[Murder in Baldur's Gate]] offers three paths in its adventure, the journey involving [[Torlin Silvershield]] was confirmed as canon in the [[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]. Shortly after, the city experienced a sudden spike of criminal activity including robberies and vandalism, which caused the Flaming Fist to crack down on some shadier establishments in the Lower City and Outer City regions. As the Baldurian Parliament responded by passing bewildering sumptuary laws, stating that citizens had to wear attire befitting their station,\n\nDespite the best efforts by the adventurers, the Watch and the Flaming Fist, whose leadership was assumed by [[Ulder Ravengard]], the city erupted into chaos. As city workers went on strike and the Upper City was placed on a lockdown-curfew at mid-afternoon, the merchant-class of the Lower City became incensed and unruly. As Outer City residents protested against the city officials, petty vandalism escalated to arson and even kidnappings. In response, the free press of the city, known as [[Baldur's Mouth]] was shut down and the new leader of the Fist instituted a series of illegal tribunals.\n\nAfter a group of Outer City residents clashed with a contingent of Flaming Fist soldiers in the district of [[Norchapel]], riots erupted throughout the Lower and Outer City regions. After an explosion erupted in [[Bloomridge]], the city was placed under martial law. The adventurers hired by the Council discovered the chaos in the city was a result of the  Grand Duke Torlin Silvershield's plot to destroy the corrupted Baldurian Parliament, in a dramatic immolation of stockpiled [[smokepowder]], and sever the Guild's subversive influence over Baldurian officials. He revealed himself as the [[Chosen]] of the re-ascended god of murder, Bhaal, before he was slain by the adventurers of Baldur's Gate.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Baldur's Gate was caught up in the plot of an [[illithid]] [[elder brain]] named [[the Absolute]] and [[Cult of the Absolute|its cult]]. The cult marched on the city, while the brain, now a \"netherbrain\" due to its empowerment by the [[Crown of Karsus]], burst from a cave system underneath the city, destroying large portions of multiple districts, though the upper city was affected most. The siege by the Cult of the Absolute ended when a group of heroes climbed the brain and either destroyed or dominated it."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Since the days of Balduran himself, tales of the wealth he brought back from across the Sea of Swords were prevalent throughout the city.

            "Underground": "Beneath the streets of the city was a sprawling, underground festhall known as the [[Undercellar]]. Dank cellars, twisting corridors and cramped tunnels composed its extensive network that stretched beneath nearly every corner of the Upper City region. Entrances into this secretive domain were numerous, but well-controlled, either by private, mercantile or criminal enterprises.\n\nEven deeper underground, beyond the Undercellar, was a series of subterranean tunnels and caves. Within one of the vast caverns were the ruins of an old settlement that came to be known as the [[Undercity]]. By the 14{{th}} century only one structure remained amongst the decrepit foundations and [[undead]]-infested streets. This was an old [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|temple of Bhaal]] that was once reclaimed by the Bhaalspawn Sarevok.\n\nThese tunnels extended further down, under the surface of Toril, going so far as to connect to the [[Underdark]]. One of these natural formations opened up into the ''Wizard Cave'', an expanse that housed the tower of a [[wizard]] that went missing during the mid-15{{th}} century.",

            "Population": "The population of Baldur's Gate was always dominated by [[human]]s, though other races such as [[elves]], [[dwarves]], and to a lesser extent some [[drow]], settled within the city and were not looked upon differently. The older districts of the Upper City and Lower City were quite diverse, while newer neighborhoods and those of the Outer City saw some homogenization along ethnic and racial lines. While no race was outright banned, more-monstrous [[humanoid]]s such as [[troll]]s, [[ogre]]s and [[orc]]s were a rare sight indeed.\n\nAs anyone was welcome to visit or conduct business in The Gate, its population continually swelled as the city's geographical size grew well beyond its walls. How the city did not collapse upon itself, was unfathomable to many.",
            "Demographics": "Adventurers were a welcome presence in the Gate, many of whom came from the far corners of [[Toril]] to seek opportunities for fame, fortune or whatever alluring endeavour presented itself. Even those from unlikely walks of life found themselves enticed by the stories that filled the city's taverns and inns, giving in to the temptation of thrill and excitement.\n\nMany lower and working-class individuals lived in the streets of the Lower and Outer City regions. While low-skilled laborers and dock-workers ensured goods arrived to their destinations in the Gray Harbor, tradesfolk such as tanners, smiths, garment-makers and the like produced their goods throughout the city. The industry of these laborious individuals drove the economy of the greatest mercantile power of the Sword Coast.\n\nThe merchants of Baldur's Gate were famous across the Realms for their heroic work ethic, keen sense of business and outright gumption.\n\nThe wealthy patriar families were the nobility of the Upper City. While their lives were viewed as the epitome of luxury and opulence, many were civic-minded benefactors that genuinely strived to improve their home city.",
            "Animals": "While cats were abundantly found throughout the city, as they were used to eliminate vermin from cargo ships, dogs were not a common sight by any stretch. Livestock, such as horses, cows, goats and like, were prohibited from the city proper, relegated to the paddocks and pens of the Outer City. The city's law forbade animals bigger than a [[peacock]] to gain entrance into the city. Some considered that regulation to be archaic."
