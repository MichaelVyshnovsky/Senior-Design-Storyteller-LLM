        "mainbody": "'''Wyvernhunt''' was a shepherding community in the western foothills of the [[Storm Horns]] mountains of [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Scattered across a high meadow slope were various boulders and tiny stone cottages, some of which no more than walled-up caves. There were some sixteen families in all and the shepherds roamed the landscape with their flock of [[goat]]s.\n\nThere was a deep well, called the Deepwell, that held clean, fresh water. Around it was a market, called the Deepwell Market. Here was hung a bell for buyers at the market, called the Buyer's Bell.",
        "Trade": "From their animals, the folk here produced raw wool and goat's milk [[cheese]]. When merchants arrived in Wyvernhunt from the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] and wished to buy, they rung the Buyer's Bell and the villagers raced each other down to the market to sell their animals, wool, or cheese.",
        "Notable Locations": "Nearby on the slopes lay [[Wyvernhunt Keep]], an abandoned brigands' stronghold, and several fields up the slope above the hamlet stood [[Spear Rock]], a shrine to [[Tempus]], which was clearly visible. Several [[copper]] mines lay further up in the hills; once the area was plagued by [[wyvern]] aeries, hence the name, but they were rare by the 1360s [[DR]], making the mines safer.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to local legend, a [[werewyvern]] bandit named [[Black Shaernauba]] menaced travelers on the road. Supposedly she'd murdered [[Purple Dragons]] who tried to establish an outpost and people who tried to build inns in the area, but [[Volothamp Geddarm]] thought this unlikely, as Cormyr's Purple Dragons and [[War Wizards]] wouldn't be deterred by one bandit, even if a werewyvern, if they'd been serious."
