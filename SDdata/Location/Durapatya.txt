Durapatya was a town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.
When Priest-King Vishnan IV discovered a spring that produced elixir of youth, he established a temple and town nearby to give thanks to the Lords of Creation.
Durapatya was a small town constructed around the temple.
By the midâ€“14 century DR, the magic of the spring had faded, yet pilgrims and others seeking cures still flocked there.
