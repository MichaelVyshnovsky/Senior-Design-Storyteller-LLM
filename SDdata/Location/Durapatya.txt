'''Durapatya''' was a town in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]].

==History==
When Priest-King [[Vishnan IV]] discovered a spring that produced ''[[elixir of youth]]'', he established a temple and town nearby to give thanks to the [[Lords of Creation]].

==Description==
Durapatya was a small town constructed around the temple.

==Activities==
By the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the magic of the spring had faded, yet [[pilgrim]]s and others seeking cures still flocked there.
