Lemontree Alley was an alley in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.
Lemontree Alley opened off the Shadows Alley. It was situated north of Cage Street, along the first block of buildings east of Piergeirons Palace.
This alley was crowded with the lemon trees from which its name was derived, brought over by a local wizard some time prior to 1363 DR. This same wizard also placed a permanent spell on the alley, making it perpetually warm enough to be a suitable climate for the tropical trees.
Some time prior to 1363 DR, Narthindlar set a zombie bear in the alley to act as a guardian over its lemon trees. The zombie was largely docile and would sit quietly underneath one of the trees. It was only known to become hostile whenever someone attempted to hurt the lemon trees or steal from them, but even then the creature would not go out of its way to harm the offender unless necessary.
Narthindlar himself was often known to be found in the alley, sitting on one of its many benches, smoking tabacco while contemplating life. The alley was also known to be a popular spot among diplomats for discrete discussion.
An entrance to the sewers of Waterdeep was located at the intersection of the alleyways Lemontree and Shadows.
