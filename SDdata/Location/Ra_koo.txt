'''Ra'koo''' was a village in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. It lay north of the city of [[Koje]].

Folk there discovered and disturbed a burial site of the ancient [[Han people]], and brought a curse upon themselves. By [[1357 DR]], it was impossible for any person, not even children, to sleep within the village. The sleepless villagers grew weak and desperate for anyone who could lift their curse or find the cause of their condition.
