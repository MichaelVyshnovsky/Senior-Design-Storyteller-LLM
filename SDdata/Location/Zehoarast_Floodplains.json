        "Geography": "The Zehoarast Floodplains encompassed the lowlands between the [[River Esmel]] and the [[Small Teeth]] west of the [[Trade Way]]. The greater region of [[Zehoarastria]] was named after these plains.",
        "Description": "The floodplains were formed by the overflow from the [[River Specie]] and the [[Imnestream]] in the spring. Because of the constant flooding, no settlements were found here; however, when the land was dry, local shepherds and prospectors searched the land for nuggets of [[gold]] and [[silver]] that came down from the [[Small Teeth]] to the south. The plains were covered with swampy terrain, and [[quicksand]] could be found there.",
