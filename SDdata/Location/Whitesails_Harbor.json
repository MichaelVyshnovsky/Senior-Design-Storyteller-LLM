        "mainbody": "Whitesails Harbor was a harbor located on the shore of Luskans North Bank. It was one of the two harbors in the city, the other being Dragon Beach.\nWhitesails was a busy port. It was well-defended, and the main part of the harbor was only usable by Luskanite ships. It was well-known as a haven for pirates, although it was considered rude for foreigners to say so.\nWhitesails was sheltered from the waves and storms of the Trackless Sea by a breakwater extending from Harbor Arm Island, however the northernmost part of the harbor was more exposed to the elements and was known as the Open Shore. This section was the only place in the city where foreign vessels were allowed to dock.\nGuard towers at the end of the breakwater and on Harbor Arm Island were garrisoned with Luskanite troops with orders to fire on any unauthorized people or vessels attempting to enter the harbor.\nAt some point in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Luskan navy&mdashwhich swore loyalty to the High Captains of Luskan&mdashbecame based out of Whitesails Harbor after previously having operated out of Dragon Beach. At this time, Whitesails was one of the most dangerous places in Lusakn, especially for visitors to the city. This was in part because the harbors guards were paid for every \"intruder\" they hit with their arrows, leading them to sometimes fire into the neighboring Mirabar District in hopes of hitting someone.\nIn the , when Deudermont led an effort to unseat the Arcane Brotherhoods grip on Luskan, a major turning point came when the pirates of Whitesails decided to join his attack on the Host Tower of the Arcane by helping to resupply his ships with ammunition. This was arguably the moment that helped High Captain Kurth to realize that the Brotherhood had truly lost the support of the people of Luskan, leading him to side with Deudermont.\nthumb|left|A ship moored at the Open Shore.\n* Fishbone Tavern, located a few blocks inland from the Open Shore.\n* The Open Shore, where foreign ships and fishing boats docked.\n* Peg and Hook, a shop specializing in prosthetics.\nThe harbor was home to not only pirates but fishers and laborers, as well as to businesses catering to them.\nNotable inhabitants as of the late 15 century DR included\n* Arla Razortongue, owner of the Peg and Hook.\n* Fryer, the owner of the Fishbone Tavern.\n* Rakeem, a professional snitch.\n* Velos, a professional pirate.\n* Zurb, the bouncer at the Fishbone Tavern."
