        "mainbody": "aramuri was an island located in Kozakura.\nTaramuri was located to the southeast of Obakuto. This low-lying island was encircled by an expansive coral reef. Approaching the island proved challenging for vessels with a deeper draft, limiting access to fishing boats.\nTaramuri was exclusively inhabited by monkeys and su-monsters. The su-monsters residing on Taramuri possessed such ferocity that they have effectively deterred fishermen from establishing a village on the island or venturing into its interior. \nAncient scrolls attributed to the sage Chong Pui alluded to the existence of magical pools somewhere on the island, yet no firsthand verification of their presence has been made within living memory."
