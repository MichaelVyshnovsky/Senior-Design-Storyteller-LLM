        "Geography": "Halendos was located along the edge of the meadow [[Halendos]], It was roughly a day's journey away from [[Veltalar]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|4}}",
        "Description": "The buildings in Halendos were made of wood, all painted in bright forest colors. Each of the houses seemed to have their own garden and many had sod roofs from which flowers and vines grew.",
        "Trade": "Most of the inhabitants of this village were farmers and herders, with a few being shopkeepers.",
        "History": "This village was built on the same site as an old [[human]] city, that was burned to the ground during the war between humans and the [[half-elf|half-elven]] descendants of the [[Yuir]].\n\nIn [[1479 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki. the normally docile [[fey]] and wildlife near the village started to act more violent.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|5}} A trio of half-elven farmers went on to hire a group of [[adventurer]]s to investigate this change in behavior, who found it to be a side effect of the [[Cult of Voldini]]'s activities.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Horse and Cart]], the village's resident inn where outsiders stayed.",
        "Inhabitants": "Those who inhabited Halendos were largely human, though there were some half-elves. All who lived in the village were strongly influenced by the Yuir half-elves and the mystical, fey nature of the area in which they lived. Many had inherent magical abilities or were subjected to prophetic dreams. And a higher proportion of children grew up to be [[wizard]]s. Overall there was a laid back atmosphere with care for the local environment.\n\nThe [[Simbul]] was known to visit this village, usually disguised as a farmer or trader, in order to hear of its residents' prophetic dreams and searching for magically talented people to take on as apprentices. One such prophesy was said to have warned her of a [[Thay]]an plot against Aglarond."
