        "Description": "These dark and silent forests were shunned by [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[humans]] and [[orcs]], as an ancient evil power lurked in the dark under the foliage. Many cruel [[Plant creature|plant monsters]] infested the woods, such as [[assassin vine]]s, [[dark tree]]s, [[shambling mound]]s, and [[tendriculos]]es.\n\nThe Night Trees were defended by an [[evil]] [[druid]] known as the [[Tree Slaker]], who often placed insidious traps to catch intruders. When the Tree Slaker captured someone, he usually bound the victim to a nearby tree and drained the blood out of them to satisfy the dark and thirsty spirit of the forest. By [[1372 DR]], the Tree Slaker had gathered some acolytes, fellow druids and wicked [[ranger]]s eager to sacrifice creatures to please their master.\n\nIn the northern area of the forest stood a mysterious square tower covered by vines. According to legends, it was an ancient temple dedicated to [[Chauntea]] that had been corrupted by the evil presence of the Night Trees. Adventurers who tried to reach the tower found the plant monsters and the Tree Slaker blocking their way."
