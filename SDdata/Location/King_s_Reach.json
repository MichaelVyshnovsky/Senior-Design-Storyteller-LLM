        "mainbody": "'''King's Reach''', also called the '''High Reach''', was a town in [[the Vast]], lying by the [[River Vesper]] on [[North Road]] between [[Swords Pool]] and [[Three Trees Pass]], at the intersection with the [[Long Reach]] trail from [[Sendrin]].",
        "Description": "King's Reach was a fortified town located near the River Vesper, at a crossing that was the highest navigable point upstream. Beyond this point, the river was a series of cascades and falls. It was a wealthy community and a center of trade, mining and prospecting in the surrounding mountains.",
        "Trade": "Many prospecting expeditions set out from and returned here, often by circuitous and secret routes to protect their claims and finds. Almost every person in King's Reach attempted prospecting for gold at least once in their life, seeking to strike it rich.\n\nMore successful were the traders who met them in Three Trees Pass in the summer, selling food, supplies and equipment and buying ores and nuggets. The ores and metals came down to King's Reach to be smelted or worked, and the goods came by barge up the Vesper to be sold.\n\nWith all the ore coming in, King's Reach was the biggest centre of smelting in the Vast, and produced many trade-bars of [[iron]] and [[silver]], palm-ingots of [[copper]] and [[nickel]], and lesser quantities of [[gold]] and [[zinc]]. These were kept in secure stronghouses and heavily guarded by alert and ready crossbow-wielding guards. They were a common target for bandits and [[orc]]s, but easier pickings were the [[mule]]-trains bearing ore in and metal out. Caravan guards were in high demand.\n\nThere were a couple of small [[inn]]s and [[tavern]]s, though none had any great reputation beyond the town. They were frequently bought and sold as proprietors left to join the gold rush and former prospectors retired.\n\nA shrine of [[Tymora]] lay in the town. This was administered by the [[Gates of Good Fortune|temple]] in [[Mulmaster]], which regularly sent a priest to tend the shrine and the needs of the people.",
        "History": "There were various explanations for the name of King's Reach, but sages agreed that the oldest and most likely story was that this was the spot where [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]] of [[Roldilar]] declared that [[human]]s would reach this far and no further into dwarven lands. The name remained even after the fall of Roldilar in [[649 DR]]. The nickname \"the High Reach\" was later applied to distinguish the town from the [[Dragon Reach]].\n\nThroughout its history, King's Reach was a base for prospectors and miners operating in the neighboring [[Troll Mountains (the Vast)|Troll Mountains]] (until they were worked out), [[Giantspike Mountains|Giantspike]] and [[Earthspur Mountains]]. These miners were originally dwarves, but over time they became predominantly human.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Carriage Works]], a wheelwright's shop that serviced merchants' wagons and caravans as well as offered wagon rentals.\n* [[Glassee Tavern]], a tavern that offers food and drink from its vineyards outside of town, frequented by local laborers and dock workers.\n* [[The King's Ride Inn]], the inn of a better quality in the settlement that catered to traveling merchants.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Good, the Undead, and the Ugly|13-14}}\n* [[The Ports View Inn]], a common man's inn and tavern run by the proprietor and his two daughters in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Sylvian Stables]], stables that sold and bought quality horses for high prices.\n* [[Vibros Blacksmithy]], a smithy that sold quality masterwork items forged by its kind yet monotonous proprietress in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Weave's General Store]], a general store that did good business with travelers and adventurers."
