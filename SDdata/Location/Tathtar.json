        "mainbody": "'''Tathtar''' was a small kingdom in the vicinity of the [[Deepwash]], occupying territory in the [[Deepwing Mountains]], [[Cloven Mountains]], and the [[High Peaks]].",
        "History": "It was founded in [[227 DR]] apparently as a human realm, though some accounts mentioned it as being mixed [[human]] and [[dwarf|dwarven]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|56}}\n\nFor the decade following [[230 DR]], Tathtar attempted to expand into eastern [[Tethyr]]. The [[Tathtar Wars]], as they were called, were a cause of irritation for Emperor [[Shoon IV]]. The wars finally came to an end as the result of peace treaties.\n\nUpper Tathtar was destroyed in [[293 DR]] when it was overrun by an [[orc]] horde commanded by chieftain [[Thaurgarl|Thaurgarl \"Greatmaw\"]]. Lower Tathtar survived the conflict.\n\nLower Tathtar was to survive for almost 500 years more. In [[731 DR]], its armies once again sought to control regions east of Tethyr, specifically the wilderness that once was [[Elestam]]. They were repelled by King [[Strohm II]], who then officially re-instituted Elestam as part of Tethyr. His successor, [[Strohm III]], continued battling Tathtar throughout his reign.\n\nLower Tathtar was finally destroyed in [[796 DR]] who was herself a citizen of the kingdom. By as late as [[1370 DR]], monsters and brigands dwelt in the eastern ruins of the kingdom.",
        "Geography": "The capital of Tathtar was disputed, sometimes thought to be [[Tulhaspyr]],{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|56}} at other times [[Dajaan]],\n\nMuch of the remnants of Lower Tathtar would become inhabited by [[Sala-min]] Lion Warriors, centered on the ruins of Saalirk, which also held numerous creatures, both magical and [[undead]] placed there by Shyressa, who made it her home. [[Wyvern]]s from the Cloven Mountains were also noted to inhabit what remained of the crumbling ruins of the region.\n\nUpper Tathtar lay mostly in the Deepwing Mountains, most noted for its flying predators such as [[griffon]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[manticore]]s, [[red dragon]]s, and wyverns<ref>"
