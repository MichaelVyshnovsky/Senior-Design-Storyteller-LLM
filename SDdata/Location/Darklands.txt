The Darklands were located underneath the heart of Faer√ªn and formed an important domain of the Underdark.
Located above the Darklands was the Dragon Coast, portions of the Orsraun Mountains, Turmish, and Chessenta. This vast subterranean realm stretched all the way from Cairnheim in the west to Traaskl Thorog in the east.
The great duergar city of Dunspeirrin was the most powerful stronghold in the region. However, the duergar controlled only a relatively small part of the Darklands, owing to the sheer size of the region.
