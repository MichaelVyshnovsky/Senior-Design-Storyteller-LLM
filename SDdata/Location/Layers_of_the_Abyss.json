When [[devil]]s discovered this connection, they set up a colony in the poisonous swamp. Upon discovery of this invasion, [[Orcus]] and [[Juiblex]] combined forces to strengthen the poisonous nature of the plane and imbue it with necrotic energy, causing all iron and structures on the layer to decay and crumble, until all that was left was a tightly packed layer of rust and ruins, inhabited by [[undead]] and evil [[construct]]s. The portals to the Nine Hells remained since buried and unusable.\n\n====The Spires of Rajzak====\nThis layer was a vast desolation of canyons and rocky spires. It was inhabited by masses of rampaging [[demon]]s and its maddened demon lord known as [[Rajzak]]. He was said to have once been a beautiful demon lord who was transformed into a bestial creature after a conflict with [[Graz'zt]]. The [[Bastion of Hate]] was located on this layer.\n\n===Xulregg===\nA hot and humid forest of giant [[tree]]s, rotting mulch, and swamps of boiling muck, centered around the Gorewood tree.
