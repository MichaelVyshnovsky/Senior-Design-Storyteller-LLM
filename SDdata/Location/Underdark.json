In the Feywild, there existed the [[Feydark]]; In the Shadowfell, there existed the [[Shadowdark]].\n\n{{quote|Absence of light results in darkness. So, what results from the absence of [[Good]]?

            "Domains": "The Underdark was not one giant cavern under [[Faerûn]], but rather many huge networks of caverns and caves. As a result, it was not always possible to travel from one end of the Underdark to the other. The Underdark was divided into several domains that were similar to continents of the world above. While it was possible to travel from one place to another within a domain, separate domains tended to have very few passages linking them. The major domains of the Underdark were the [[Buried Realms]], the [[Darklands]], the [[Deep Wastes]], the [[Earthroot]], the [[Glimmersea]], [[Great Bhaerynden]], the [[Northdark]], and [[Old Shanatar]]."

The war was ended by drow magics that lit the tunnels with fires so hot they melted rock and flooded the portion of the Underdark that connected dwarves and drow who resided in the Maztican Underdark with their eastern kin. The Underdark passages between the two continents were believed to be lost legends, gone, and forgotten by inhabitants of Faerûn.",

        "Environment": "[[File:Underdark 3e map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A map of Faerûn's whole Underdark.'']]\nThe Underdark's environment varied vastly from the surface world, making adventuring through it a dangerous expedition. Just like when trekking through a desert, adventurers traversing the Underdark's passages needed to be well prepared.\n\nThe Underdark was mainly without any source of light save for the occasional luminous rocks or [[fungus|fungi]]. Large portions of it were also without food or water, making well-stocked food supplies a must-have when exploring uncharted terrain underground.\n\nLack of light combined with a tomb-like silence made traveling something only for the strong-hearted. The nerve-wracking silence made even experienced adventurers grow agitated.\n\nJust like deep dungeons, the air could grow stale and even poisonous in the Underdark. It could contain explosive gases from underground volcanic activity or other deadly gases bubbling out of deep fissures in the rock. Bad air and poisonous fumes could collect in portions of tunnels and caves more or less isolated from the main vaults and caverns. Siphon-like tunnels holding water could also trap these gases for a long time.",
        "Climate": "[[File:Underdark 2650 2.jpg||thumb|right|300px|''Fungi of the Underdark.'']]\nThe temperature underground varied according to depth and the proximity of thermal activities in the area.

        "Ecology": "Plant life and animal life could be as varied underground as on the surface, ranging from small insects to [[hook horror]]s or [[shadow dragon]]s, which set up their realms deep down. Anything could be expected. Plant life was unable to utilize sunlight as a source for energy, and thus took on strange forms adapted to life underground. Many fungi were also found underground. Being unable to digest normal nutrients most of the time, they relied on absorbing ''[[faerzress]]'' for their energy. The basis of the Underdark food chain were [[magivore]]s: [[coral]]-like organisms that likewise fed off ''faerzress''.<ref name=FRCG-p218\">\n\nSome dangerous flora of the Underdark were the exploding [[bibberbang]]s."
