        "mainbody": "The City Square, which was also called the Gathering, was a paved plaza located in Zhentil Keep during the late 14 century DR.\nThe City Square was located in south Zhentil Keep in the central section of the Foreign Quarter on Zhent Avenue. \nSix stone benches lined the perimeter of the square facing a statue of an unknown bureaucrat in the squares center. Stocks and pillories were also found here to be used to punish criminals. A pair of enchanted lanterns kept the City Square illuminated at all times. Their enchantment allowed them to burn for a full month before their flask of oil needed to be changed. Since the square was usually quite crowded, opportunistic bards performed here hoping to catch the attention of an innkeep or tavern owner.\nAs its name implied, the Gathering was a favorite spot for citizens of Zhentil Keep to lounge. Clever produce vendors sold rotten wares which citizens could use to pummel criminals locked in the stocks. Clergy of Loviatar performed public floggings here as well.\nAn old man named Sanamun played competitive chess here for 1 gp per game."
