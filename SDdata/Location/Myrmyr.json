That \"mouth\" was called the Sunstrait and it linked the Golden Water with the Great Sea.\nThis small city helped protect the Golden Water from pirates and raiders, ensuring they were able to ship large quantities of grain through the Shining South. The grain fields of Myrmyr were second only to those of Pyratar.\nThe nearby Ship Isle bustled with activity from ship yards owned by the Sholapur chaka.\nMyrmyr hosted a population of 10,000 residents."
