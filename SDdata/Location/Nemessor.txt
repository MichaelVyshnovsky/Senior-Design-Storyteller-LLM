'''Nemessor''' was a small island located in the [[Nelanther Isles]].

==Description==
Unlike many of the other islands in the region, freshwater springs and fertile soil were present here. Fertile soil allowed fruit to grow in abundance and so the island had the potential to support civilized life. However, dangerously strong winds and summer storms made it difficult to simply navigate to the island.

==Notable Locations==
The high hills around the cove helped to protect its only settlement, [[Black Skull Cove]], located on the eastern side of the island. The high surrounding hills helped to protect the settlement and docks from the strong winds and storms. It was home to the 600–900 individuals making up the [[Black Skull]] clan. Sailors, refugees, and escaped slaves from [[Tethyr]] and [[Calimshan]] founded this city. Due to the dangers in navigating to the island, the sailors of the Black Skull Clan were some of the best in the region. As many as a quarter of the clan's members were pirates by trade.

Largely collapsed dwarven caves and tunnels, which were once a part of [[Deep Shanatar]], could be found beneath island and were occupied by monstrous creatures. Prior to the destruction of the tunnels during the fall of Shanatar, it would have been possible to walk from Nemessor to [[Zazesspur]] entirely underground.

One of the [[Sea Towers]] that were present throughout the region was located on the northeast side of the island. It was built on the cliffs that rose {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} above the sea below.
