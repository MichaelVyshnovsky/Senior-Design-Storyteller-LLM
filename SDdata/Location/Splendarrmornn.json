        "Description": "The royal city consisted of a massive, central vault with vast halls that extended outward through the caverns beneath the Greypeaks. These chambers were connected by a network of tunnels that had stone paths that resembled subterranean roads. The only entrance that linked the royal caverns to the surface of [[Toril]] was located behind the [[Shining Falls]], far above the waters of the [[Delimbiyr|Delimbiyr river]].\n\nIt featured massive, striking gates that were made of pure, black [[adamantine]].",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Adamantine Palace]]: The royal castle of the dwarven kings and queens of Ammarindar was built entirely out of [[adamantine]].",
        "History": "The city fell with the rest of Ammarindar when the [[demon]]ic forces of [[Ascalhorn]] devastated the lands of the North in [[882 DR]]. Much of the wealth of the royal city was plundered by the [[Scoured Legion]] in [[1220 DR]] when they took over the ruins of Ammarindar and established their [[Ammarindar|underground city]].{{Cite web/The Shadow Path: The Unspoken Hall}}\n\nThe existence of these demonic orcs in Splendarrmornn was discovered by the [[Harpers]] some time in the 13{{th}} or 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].\n\nIn the year [[1372 DR]], the ruins of Splendarrmornn were taken over by a group of several hundred [[orog]]s, under the charge of their leader [[Ufarskaddun]]. After discovering a few [[tanarukk]] within the royal caverns, he ordered the execution of the remaining abominations, unaware of the power of the Scoured Legion."
