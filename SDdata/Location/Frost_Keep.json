        "mainbody": "rost Keep was a frost giant fortress located in the Frozenfar.\nThe Frost Keep, as per its name, was constructed from glacial frost and ice.\nThe fort was situated to the north of the Ice Lakes and just south of the Spine of the World. To the southeast of Frost Keep was Raven Rock, an ancestral mound to the Uthgardt people. Black Raven River flowed close-by the keep.\nAs of the 14 century DR, humans of the Savage Frontier had been attempting to overtake the fortress for decades. However, the frost giants had successfully defended Frost Keep. They were known to disrupt trade caravans along the Northern Means to the southwest. As well as selling the stolen wares and using the magic to empower themselves, they would cook and eat the tradesmen as well as their animals.\nThe fort was inhabited by seventeen frost giants, one of which was a powerful leader that commanded the others."
