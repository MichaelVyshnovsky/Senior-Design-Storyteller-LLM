            "Mercenarism": "Due to the large number of [[mercantile company|trade costers]] located in town, Archenbridge was a good place for [[mercenaries]] and other men-at-arms to find work as caravan guards. As such, many sellswords came in town looking for work."

            "Religion": "The main worship in Archenbridge was dedicated to [[Lathander]] (the patron deity of the city) and to [[Chauntea]], whose clergy was the most influential in the region. Veneration of [[Tempus]] was also important, especially amongst the [[Archenriders]].",

No less than 180 mounted soldiers were stationed in [[Swordpoint]], ready to intervene in case of Sembian attack. During peacetime, soldiers patrol the city in 10-man units.\n\nThe town also operated a militia, which seconded the military. It was mostly composed of army veterans, and of young people preparing for regular service.\n\nWhen the need arose, [[Archendale]] traders also hired [[mercenaries]] and spellcasters to defend their goods and employees. The [[Swords of Archendale]] had the authority to appropriate those hires for common defense in time of need.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1100 DR]], a [[dwarven]] [[engineer]] named [[Naiden Stonewright]] constructed a stone bridge near a small village located around [[Arkhen Ford]]&mdash;previously the only way to cross the [[River Arkhen]] in the area. The village grew and prospered as the traffic of travelers and merchants increased and eventually became known as ''Archenbridge'', the largest metropolis of the Dales. \n\nMost of the bridge itself was largely destroyed during the {{YearlinkName|1293}} due to a severe flood. It was rebuilt using a large span of wood on the original Dwarven buttresses, which still carried lingering magical enchantments from centuries before.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century, craftsmen from town were kidnapped and brought to a ruined estate of [[House Keleidsa]] in the [[Arch Wood]], approximately {{SI|20|miles|k}} northeast of town. They were asked by [[drow]] to restore the place to its former glory, and were mercilessly slain afterwards.{{Cite dungeon/121/Secrets of the Arch Wood|67-79}}\n\nDuring the {{YearlinkName|1440}}, the town repelled a large [[mercenary]] army sent by [[Sembia]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Forever|52}} The [[Swords of Archendale]] lost rulership when they were discovered to be consorting with the attackers.",

            "Angelic battle": "It was said that ''circa'' [[1295 DR]] a [[planetar]] serving [[Tyr]] tracked a [[blackguard]] of [[Gargauth]] outside of Archenbridge. The ensuing battle pitted the antipaladin and a [[pit fiend]] against the angel, which paid the ultimate price in order to destroy its opponents. The [[Chapel of Resounding Justice]] was built on the site of the battle, and it is said that the statue decorating its courtyard are the petrified remains of the deceased planetar.",

It was said that she laid her hand on the [[Flame of the Spirit]], a magical artifact sacred to the faith of [[Tymora]] rumored to be cursed by a [[red dragon]].\n[[File:Aurumvorax 3e.png|thumb|left|150px|''Aurumvorax attacks were reported in the region.'']]",
            "Haunted Hollow": "The hill of [[Grave Hollow]] was said to be the tomb of an unknown warrior. According to the locals, anyone trying to dig into the Hollow or lighting a fire in the glen would bring forth moaning [[spirit]]s&mdash;and anyone foolish enough to continue this endeavor would be subject to a terrible curse. Those rumors were encouraged by the owners of the grand mansions along the River Way, trying to discourage [[adventurer]]s and other undesirables from camping in their backyard.",
            "Missing woodsmen": "People of Archenbridge had many dark tales to tell of woodsmen who ventured into the [[Arch Wood]] and never returned. Some said that those disappearances were linked to the lost ruins of an old [[elven]] [[wizardry]] school, whereas others believed the wood itself hated and hungered after [[human]]s.",
            "Treasure caches": "According to rumors, several successful merchant families stored their riches in caches hidden in vaults or crypts under their manors. This included the [[Baulaukiir]]s, the [[Ithrymm]] and the [[Tantal]]s."
