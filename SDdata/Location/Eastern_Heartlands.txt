The Eastern Heartlands, sometimes merely called the Heartlands, was a vast region in central and northern Faerûn.
The Eastern Heartlands comprised various smaller regions, nations and city-states, including the Dragon Coast, Cormyr, Sembia, Cormanthyr, the Dalelands, the southern stretch of the Moonsea, and Vesperin. The humans of the Eastern Heartlands shared a common culture and language.
After the Fall of Netheril, the survivors of three eastern Netherese cities, Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath, gradually migrated and settled in what is now the Eastern Heartlands.
War engulfed much of the Eastern Heartlands during the 15 century DR, when lost flying city of Thultanthar appeared over the Anauroch desert and signaled the return of the Netheril empire. The conquering Netherese subjugated the nation of Sembia and some of the Dalelands, while engaging in a decades-long war with Cormyr and the renewed city of Myth Drannor  that continued until the calamity known as the Second Sundering reshaped all of Faerûn.
Far-reaching and influential groups operated throughout the cities and rural areas of the Eastern Heartlands, including the Harpers, the Zhentarim, and to a lesser degree the Red Wizards of Thay,
Nagas were known to inhabit the Eastern Heartlands.
The great empire of the elves known as Cormanthyr experienced periods of great turmoil and profound glory over the millennia
