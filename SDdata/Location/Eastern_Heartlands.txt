The '''Eastern Heartlands''', sometimes merely called the '''Heartlands''', was a vast region in [[Interior Faerûn|central]] and [[north Faerûn|northern]] [[Faerûn]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Description==
The Eastern Heartlands comprised various smaller regions, nations and city-states, including the [[Dragon Coast]], [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], [[Cormanthyr]], the [[Dalelands]], the southern stretch of the [[Moonsea]], and [[Vesperin]]. The [[human]]s of the Eastern Heartlands shared a common culture and language.

==History==
After the [[Netheril|Fall of Netheril]], the survivors of three eastern [[Netherese]] cities, [[Anauria]], [[Asram]], and [[Hlondath]], gradually migrated and settled in what is now the Eastern Heartlands.

War engulfed much of the Eastern Heartlands during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], when lost [[Netherese enclave|flying city]] of [[Thultanthar]] appeared over the [[Anauroch]] desert and signaled the return of the [[Netheril]] empire.{{page needed}} The conquering Netherese subjugated the nation of Sembia and some of the Dalelands, while engaging in a decades-long war with Cormyr and the renewed city of [[Myth Drannor]]  that continued until the calamity known as the [[Second Sundering]] reshaped all of [[Faerûn]].

==Inhabitants==
Far-reaching and influential groups operated throughout the cities and rural areas of the Eastern Heartlands, including the [[Harpers]], the [[Zhentarim]], and to a lesser degree the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]],
