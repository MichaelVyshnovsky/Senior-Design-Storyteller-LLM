        "mainbody": "The '''Old City''' of [[Port Nyanzaru]] was a run-down ward located on the outside of the settlement's outer walls. Unlike the slums of [[Malar's Throat]] or [[Tiryki Anchorage]], it was rather safe from crime.",
        "Description": "The ward comprised three, crumbling and [[vine]]-covered ancient ziggurats that loomed over a haphazard sprawl of ramshackle huts and longhouses constructed with [[bamboo]] and thatch alongside the occasional tent.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|7}}{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|15}} These shantytown homes and shops were even built up onto the stepped terraces of the ziggurats, and were full of bamboo signs advertising labor and crafts.\n\nThose entering the Old City left the [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]] through a southwest-facing gate and followed a central roadway between the two larger ziggurats to behold [[Executioner's Run]], a long, stone-lined pit flanked by the third, smaller ziggurat. The main road split to pass on either side of the Executioner's Run.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|33-34}}",
        "Trade": "While both Malar's Throat and Tiryki Anchorage were better known for their black markets, it was also possible to find a black market buyer or seller in the Old City by asking the right questions to the right people. Such black market dealings were harshly punished by law.",
        "Government": "While the Old City was nominally controlled by the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] of Port Nyanzaru proper, the district was actually run by a number of \"beggar princes\", so named in mockery of the high-and-mighty merchant princes. These criminal leaders had no formal authority, but held sway over local criminals and residents by means of financial debts, blackmail, calling in favors, and the use of enforcers. They operated in anonymity and their actual ranks changed repeatedly, but even so, they tended to be much more efficient leaders than the merchant princes.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[Zhentarim]] spymaster named [[Pock-Marked Po]] had become one of the beggar princes.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|3}}",
        "Defenses": "Because it lay outside of Port Nyanzaru's defensive walls, the people of the Old City relied on the volunteer [[Citizens' Brigade]] to keep them safe. In case of attack, a [[horn]] was sounded and [[bell]]s were rung from the Beggars' Palaces",
        "Notable Locations": {
            "Buildings": ":;[[Beggars' Palaces]]: The ward's two larger ziggurats served as the headquarters of Old City's beggar princes.\n:;[[Holdup|The Holdup]]: A [[tavern]] that was popular among [[adventurer]]s.",
            "Landmarks": ":;[[Executioner's Run]]: This stone-paved pit was used for capital punishment and entertainment. Criminals were thrown into the pit with dangerous beasts, such as [[panther]]s or [[velociraptor]]s, and forced to run across its length to stay alive. Crowds gathered along the sides of the pit and gambled on the fate of those that were being punished.\n:;[[refuse pit (Port Nyanzaru)|Refuse Pit]]: A few [[otyugh]]s at the bottom of this sinkhole, along with vermin and [[undead]], consumed the garbage, rancid waste, and corpses that were dumped within."
        },
        "History": "None remembered the civilization that had built the ancient ziggurats that dominated the Old City.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|32}}\n\nDuring the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} a strange series of disappearances struck the Old City in which people would hear the \"[[Call of the Dead]]\"&mdash;causing them to mumble to themselves about [[Viplo|\"Death\"]] summoning them&mdash;before vanishing and sometimes reappearing as a [[zombie]] days later. These events led [[Alastar Bol]], a representative of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] in Port Nyanzaru, to send a [[priest]] named [[Derio]] to investigate.\n\nFollowing the end of the death curse, undead began to proliferate in the refuse pit, and soon threatened the folk of the Old City.{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|3}} This was caused by a [[wight]] [[necromancer]] named [[Jaru Tasca]], who plotted to use a piece of the [[Cyst]]&mdash;a powerful [[necromantic]] mass of flesh&mdash;to transform Port Nyanzaru's residents and [[adventurer]]s into undead. Her minions would rise from the refuse pit to capture victims and return them to her secret base in the catacombs beneath the Old City.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|3}}",
