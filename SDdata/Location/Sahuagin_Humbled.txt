The [[Walking Statue of Waterdeep]] known as the '''Sahuagin Humbled''' was originally the only Walking Statue visible in [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
This Walking Statue was a {{SIAdj|90|ft|adj=tall}} stone colossus. It was one of a set of eight such [[construct]]s in Waterdeep.

==Location==
The statue was positioned on [[Gull Leap]] at the western end of [[Julthoon Street]] in Waterdeep by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] (the creator of the statue and most of its brethren) to help defend the city.

==History==
After defending the city from a [[sahuagin]] invasion in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Khelben reshaped the statue into the image of a sahuagin, moved it to the base of [[Mount Waterdeep]], and had it pose down on one knee showing reverence toward the [[House of Heroes]] on the far side of the [[Field of Triumph]] to the north.
