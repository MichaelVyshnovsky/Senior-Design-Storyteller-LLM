        "mainbody": "wanmays Glade was a portion of the Wealdath forest located in its southern reaches.\nThis region of the forest included the Nebulae Pool and the Calathalureenteir stream from which it was fed.\nHuman merchants were forced to conduct their business with the elves on the banks of the Calathalureenteir. They were not allowed any further into the forest.\nThe region earned its name from the old fire than ravaged this area of the Wealdath. It reduced the thicket of trees to an open glade in the middle of the forest.\nPerhaps most notable landmark of Swanmays Glade was the elven treetop city of Suldanessellar.\nThe resident elves kept way many who tried to intrude on their land. They were more tolerant of humans and extremely discriminatory towards goblins.\nDespite its name the region was not known to house any actual swanmays."
