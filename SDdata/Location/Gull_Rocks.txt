The '''Gull Rocks''' were a small cluster of islands and the westernmost point charted on most maps of the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Description==
The islands themselves varied in size, with most being smaller than a [[ship]] and able to fit only three standing people on them, and the largest being almost {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} across. The islands were completely barren and were covered in [[guano]] from the local [[seagull]] population. The thousands of birds frequently perching on these rocks were what gave the archipelago its name. The tallest point of the Gull Rocks was about {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} above sea level.

==Geography==
The Gull Rocks were located about {{SI|500|mile|k|long=yes}} south-west of the westernmost point of the [[Moonshae Isles]], within approximately a [[tenday]] or two worth of sailing (depending on the speed of the ship). The island of [[Caerwich]] was located around another 500 miles south-west from Gull Rocks.

==History==
''Circa'' [[-1000 DR]], the Gull Rocks, along with [[Gundarlun]], [[Mintarn]], the [[Purple Rocks]], [[The Teeth (Trackless Sea)|the Teeth]], [[Tuern]], [[Umukek]], the [[Wave Rocks]], and the [[Whalebones]], were colonized by the [[Illuskan]] people of [[Ruathym]], later becoming known as the [[Northmen]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

In the {{yearlinkName|1364}}, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his friends landed on the Gull Rocks when traveling to Caerwich on board the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'', piloted by Captain [[Deudermont]], in order to perform repairs and help the crew with their sea sickness. The wizard [[Harkle Harpell]] employed his magic to gain the assistance of the local seagull population to aid them in their search for the aforementioned island.
