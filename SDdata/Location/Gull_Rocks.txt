The Gull Rocks were a small cluster of islands and the westernmost point charted on most maps of the Sea of Swords.
The islands themselves varied in size, with most being smaller than a ship and able to fit only three standing people on them, and the largest being almost  across. The islands were completely barren and were covered in guano from the local seagull population. The thousands of birds frequently perching on these rocks were what gave the archipelago its name. The tallest point of the Gull Rocks was about  above sea level.
The Gull Rocks were located about  south-west of the westernmost point of the Moonshae Isles, within approximately a tenday or two worth of sailing (depending on the speed of the ship). The island of Caerwich was located around another 500 miles south-west from Gull Rocks.
Circa -1000 DR, the Gull Rocks, along with Gundarlun, Mintarn, the Purple Rocks, the Teeth, Tuern, Umukek, the Wave Rocks, and the Whalebones, were colonized by the Illuskan people of Ruathym, later becoming known as the Northmen.
In the , Drizzt DoUrden and his friends landed on the Gull Rocks when traveling to Caerwich on board the Sea Sprite, piloted by Captain Deudermont, in order to perform repairs and help the crew with their sea sickness. The wizard Harkle Harpell employed his magic to gain the assistance of the local seagull population to aid them in their search for the aforementioned island.
