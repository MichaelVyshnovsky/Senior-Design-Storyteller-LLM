'''Fryndul''' was a [[gnome]] village in the southern [[Shaar]] ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==Geography==
Fryndul was located on the [[Trader's Way]] east of [[Kormul]] in the southern region of the Shaar, sometimes called the [[Shaareach]] or the [[Channath Vale]]. It was described as "just east of the bridge" or the [[River Talar]], depending on the map being consulted.

The dwellings were mostly constructed from earth with stone reinforcements. From the road, the village appeared to be a group of burial mounds overgrown with vines in a sparsely wooded area.

==Trade==
This village produced some of the finest cut [[gem]]s in the region, especially [[emerald]]s, [[sapphire]]s, and [[amber]]s of large size. They depended on word-of-mouth to bring discreet customers to their door. The folk of Fryndul did not mine the raw gems; they traded for them with their cousins, the [[svirfneblin]].{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}}

==Defenses==
Fryndul appeared to be an abandoned burial site with earthen tombs haphazardly strewn about. The residents discouraged casual exploration of their village by maintaining this haunting landscape and adding ''[[illusion]]s'' of [[giant spider]]s living and stalking around the mounds.

==History==
Sometime around the [[1330 DR|Year of the Marching Moon, 1330 DR]], the craftsfolk of Fryndul revealed to the outside world a unique work of nature and art known as the [[Emerald Leaf]]. It was a massive accretion of emerald as big as a seat cushion that they skillfully cut to resemble an [[oak]] leaf and it was offered for sale to the highest bidder. Reportedly, a [[Waterdhavian]] noble outbid a [[Calishite]] satrap and bought the Emerald Leaf for seven million [[gold piece]]s.
