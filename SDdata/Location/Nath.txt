The '''Nath''' was a region in northeastern [[Halruaa]].

==Geography==
Located at the junction of the [[Nathaghal Mountains]] and [[Muaraghal Mountains]], the Nath was a large basin used by Halruaans to herd livestock.

The Nath sat roughly {{SI|500|ft}} above the rest of Halruaa, allowing for slightly cooler temperatures and moderate rainfall.
===Flora & Fauna===
Herds of wild [[rothe]] and [[aurochs]] teemed on the plains of the Nath, providing an excellent food source for the country.
