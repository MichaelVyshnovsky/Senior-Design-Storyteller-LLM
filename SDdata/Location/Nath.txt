The Nath was a region in northeastern Halruaa.
Located at the junction of the Nathaghal Mountains and Muaraghal Mountains, the Nath was a large basin used by Halruaans to herd livestock.
The Nath sat roughly  above the rest of Halruaa, allowing for slightly cooler temperatures and moderate rainfall.
Herds of wild rothe and aurochs teemed on the plains of the Nath, providing an excellent food source for the country.
