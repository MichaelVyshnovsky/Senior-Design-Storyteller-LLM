        "mainbody": "Claw Hollow was one of the People of the Black Blood hideouts in the Silver Marches.\nClaw Hollow was located in the northern reach of the Moonwood. This tribe marked its territory with splashes of \"blood-wine\", which consisted of both boiled wine and blood of their kills.\nAround the forest, there were a dozen or so shelters belonging to the tribe.\nThe refuge also acted as a rally point. Here, the lycanthropes treated their wounded and sick kin. They also used this place as a safe-zone when the Knights in Silver were out hunting them in the forest. Often, nearly half of the tribe was away from the settlement, busy hunting in the nearby woods.\nThe stronghold of the tribe was built within two rings of stockades, erected around a rocky promontory and a network of underground caverns. The People defended Claw Hollow with crossbows equipped with poisoned darts, javelins and stones.\nIn the bottom of a well, there was a great natural cave, full of junk and feces, where a trapped otyugh dwelt. The otyugh was captured and imprisoned several years before. The monster couldnt escape so it was fed with all the creatures that were thrown into the depths of the well.\n* Bloodmaster Jarthon Drael\n* Kuldus Droum\n* Sarissa Duncastle"
