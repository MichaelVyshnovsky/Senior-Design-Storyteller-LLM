'''Oghrann''' was a dwarven realm founded on and under the [[Plains of Tun]], in [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] during the [[Age of the Proud People]]..

The sigil of Oghrann was a hunting horn encircled by a six-pointed star.

==Geography==
At its height, Oghrann surrounded the valley of the [[River Tun]], extended into the [[Sunset Mountains]] in the west and underneath the [[Storm Horns]] in the east. It skirted [[Boareskyr's Forest]], referred to by the dwarves as ''Wurgymvudd'' or "Ugly-Wood". The lands to the northwest, known at the time as the [[Helbryn]], were also claimed by Oghrann as a hunting reserve, but settlement of those lands was forbidden since the time of King Thordbard..

==History==
Oghrann was founded in the wake of the fall of [[Shanatar]], by the realm's first and most legendary warrior-king, [[Thordbard Firebeard]], in {{Yearlink|-5125}}.

Oghrann lasted until shortly after [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] was abandoned, continuing on until the year {{Yearlink|-3770}}. [[Disease]] and attacks from [[monstrous humanoid]]s, such as [[lizard men]], [[bugbear]]s and [[wemic]]s, spelled the end of the realm and its 7,000-odd survivors fled to the [[Far Hills]] to the west.
